Since 1929, the dominant party of Mexico, the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)]] forged ties with various groups in order to gain political influence. Among them were the drug traffickers. The ties between the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] and the drug lords became so close that the PRI even went so far as to have an alliance with the drug traffickers and sanctioned their activities. \n\nThe beginning of the [[Mexican Drug War]] in 2006 was the first time any significant government effort took place to fight the drug cartels in Mexico and was initiated by Mexico's newly elected president, [[Felipe Calder\u00f3n]]. Calder\u00f3n's predecessor, [[Vicente Fox]], who was elected in 2000, marked the first time Mexico had a president who was not from the PRI.\n\nHowever, despite Calder\u00f3n's efforts, the PRI was returned to power in 2012 with the election of [[Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto]].\n\nDuring the court hearing for the most wanted cartel leader, [[Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n]], it was alleged that former president [[Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto]] had accepted a $100 million bribe from the drug kingpin.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/15/el-chapo-trial-100m-bribe-former-mexican-president-pena-nieto-witness}}</ref>\n\nOn December 1, 2018, Mexico elected a new president, [[Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador]] (AMLO).

Since medieval times, the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of [[Jerusalem]] has been divided into [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish]], [[Muslim Quarter|Muslim]], [[Christian Quarter|Christian]], and [[Armenian Quarter|Armenian]] quarters.\n\nMost population data pre-1905 is based on estimates, often from foreign travellers or organisations, since previous census data usually covered wider areas such as the [[Jerusalem District]].<ref>Usiel Oskar Schmelz, in [https://books.google.com/books?id=sdYUAAAAIAAJ Ottoman Palestine, 1800\u20131914: Studies in Economic and Social History], Gad G.

Between 1838 and 1876, a number of estimates exist which conflict as to whether Jews or Muslims were the largest group during this period, and between 1882 and 1922 estimates conflict as to exactly when Jews became a majority of the population.\n\nIn 2016, the total population of Jerusalem was 882,700, including 536,600 Jews and 345,900 others (including 319,800 Muslims, 15,800 Christians and 10,300 unclassified).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jerusaleminstitute.org.il/.upload/yearbook/2018/shnaton_C0918.pdf|title=Table III/9 - Population in Israel and in Jerusalem, by Religion, 1988 - 2016|date=2018|website=www.jerusaleminstitute.org.il|access-date=2019-05-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190510005511/http://www.jerusaleminstitute.org.il/.upload/yearbook/2018/shnaton_C0918.pdf|archive-date=2019-05-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2003 the population of the Old City was 3,965 Jews and 31,405 \"Arabs and others\" (Choshen 12).\n\n==Overview==\n{{Jerusalem large}}\nJerusalemites are of varied national, ethnic and religious denominations and include European, Asian and African [[Jews]], [[Palestinians|Arabs]] of [[Islam in Palestine|Sunni Shafi\u2018i Muslim]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem|Melkite Orthodox]], [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkite Catholic]], [[Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem|Latin Catholic]], and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] backgrounds, [[Armenians]] of the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem|Armenian Orthodox]] and [[Armenian Catholic Patriarchal Exarchate of Jerusalem and Amman|Armenian Catholic]] , [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] largely of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] and [[Syriac Catholic Church]], [[Maronites]], and [[Copts]].<ref name= Aghourian>[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=cache:yLKDlns7B-0J:t.aghourian.googlepages.com/finaldraft.doc Final draft] {{dead link|date=May 2015}}</ref> Many of these groups were once [[Immigration|immigrants]] or [[pilgrim]]s that have over time become near-[[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] populations and claim the importance of Jerusalem to their faith as their reason for moving to and being in the city.<ref name=Aghourian/>\n\nJerusalem's long history of conquests by competing and different powers has resulted in different groups living in the city many of whom have never fully identified or assimilated with a particular power, despite the length of their rule. Though they may have been citizens of that particular kingdom and empire and involved with civic activities and duties, these groups often saw themselves as distinct national groups (see Armenians, for example).<ref name=Aghourian/> The Ottoman [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]] system, whereby minorities in the [[Ottoman Empire]] were given the authority to govern themselves within the framework of the broader system, allowed these groups to retain autonomy and remain separate from other religious and national groups.

From this it appeared that the fixed residents, more than one half of whom are Mohammedans, are about eight thousand; but the continual arrival and departure of strangers, make the total number of those present in the city from ten to fifteen thousand generally, according to the season of the year. The proportion which the numbers of those of different sects bear to each other in this estimate, was not so easily ascertained. The answers which I received to enquiries on this point, were framed differently by the professors of every different faith. Each of these seemed anxious to magnify the number of those who believed his own dogmas, and to diminish that of the professors of other creeds. Their accounts were therefore so discordant, that no reliance could be placed on the accuracy of any of them. The Mohammedans are certainly the most numerous, and these consist of nearly equal portions of Osmanli Turks, from Asia Minor; descendents of pure Turks by blood, but Arabians by birth; a mixture of Turkish and Arab blood, by intermarriages; and pure Syrian Arabs, of an unmixed race. Of Europeans, there are only the few monks of the Catholic convent, and the still fewer Latin pilgrims who occasionally visit them. The Greeks are the most numerous of ail the Christians, and these are chiefly the clergy and devotees. The Armenians follow next in order, as to numbers, but their body is thought to exceed that of the Greeks in influence and in wealth. The inferior sects of Copts, Abyssinians, Syrians, Nestorians, Maronites, Chaldeans, &c. are scarcely perceptible in the crowd. And even the Jews are more remarkable from the striking peculiarity of their features and dress, than from their numbers, as contrasted with the other bodies.}}</ref>\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1824 || 6,000 || 10,000 || 4,000 || 20,000 || Fisk and King, Writers || <ref>Fisk and King, 'Description of Jerusalem,' in ''The Christian Magazine'', July 1824, page 220.

All of this directly influenced the expansion of Jerusalem beyond the city walls. From the mid-1850s to the early 1860s, several new buildings rose outside the walls, among them the mission house of the English consul, [[James Finn]], in what came to be known as Abraham\u2019s Vineyard ([[Kerem Avraham]]), the [[Jerusalem University College|Protestant school built]] by Bishop [[Samuel Gobat]] on Mount Zion; the [[Russian Compound]]; the [[Mishkenot Sha'ananim|Mishkenot Sha\u2019ananim]] houses: and the [[Schneller Orphanage complex]].

In addition, the number of Jewish immigrants from abroad choosing to settle in Jerusalem steadily increased. By 2010, there was a higher Jewish than Arab growth rate. That year, the city's birth rate was placed at 4.2 children for Jewish mothers, compared with 3.9 children for Arab mothers. In addition, 2,250 Jewish immigrants from abroad settled in Jerusalem.

From this it appeared that the fixed residents, more than one half of whom are Mohammedans, are about eight thousand; but the continual arrival and departure of strangers, make the total number of those present in the city from ten to fifteen thousand generally, according to the season of the year. The proportion which the numbers of those of different sects bear to each other in this estimate, was not so easily ascertained. The answers which I received to enquiries on this point, were framed differently by the professors of every different faith. Each of these seemed anxious to magnify the number of those who believed his own dogmas, and to diminish that of the professors of other creeds. Their accounts were therefore so discordant, that no reliance could be placed on the accuracy of any of them. The Mohammedans are certainly the most numerous, and these consist of nearly equal portions of Osmanli Turks, from Asia Minor; descendents of pure Turks by blood, but Arabians by birth; a mixture of Turkish and Arab blood, by intermarriages; and pure Syrian Arabs, of an unmixed race. Of Europeans, there are only the few monks of the Catholic convent, and the still fewer Latin pilgrims who occasionally visit them. The Greeks are the most numerous of ail the Christians, and these are chiefly the clergy and devotees. The Armenians follow next in order, as to numbers, but their body is thought to exceed that of the Greeks in influence and in wealth. The inferior sects of Copts, Abyssinians, Syrians, Nestorians, Maronites, Chaldeans, &c. are scarcely perceptible in the crowd. And even the Jews are more remarkable from the striking peculiarity of their features and dress, than from their numbers, as contrasted with the other bodies.}}</ref>\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1824 || 6,000 || 10,000 || 4,000 || 20,000 || Fisk and King, Writers || <ref>Fisk and King, 'Description of Jerusalem,' in ''The Christian Magazine'', July 1824, page 220.

Here, the former explains most of the 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness and planet thermal emission contributes to much of the 0.8&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness. Their non-detections with ground-based infrared data suggested that Fomalhaut b had to be less massive than about 3 Jupiter masses.\n\nHowever, Fomalhaut b should be detectable in space-based infrared data if its mass is between 1-3 Jupiter masses.

Finally, researchers analyzing September\u2013October 2011 [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA) data for Fomalhaut's debris ring suggested an alternate hypothesis: that the ring could be shaped by much smaller, shepherding planets, neither of which needed to be Fomalhaut b.<ref name=\"Boley2012\">{{Cite journal |title=Constraining the Planetary System of Fomalhaut Using High-resolution ALMA Observations |first=Aaron |last=Boley |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=2012 |arxiv = 1204.0007|bibcode = 2012ApJ...750L..21B |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/750/1/L21 |volume=750 |pages=L21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=36681 |title=ALMA Reveals Workings of Nearby Planetary System |accessdate=2012-04-18}}</ref>  These results invoked skepticism about Fomalhaut b's status as an extrasolar planet.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20945-new-doubts-about-poster-child-of-exoplanets.html |author=Lisa Grossman |title=New doubts about 'poster child' of exoplanets |journal=New Scientist |publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd. |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yudhijit Bhattacharjee |title=Celebrated Exoplanet Vanishes in a Cloud of Dust-Or Maybe Not |journal=Science |page=515 |volume=335 |date=3 February 2012 |bibcode = 2012Sci...335..515B |doi = 10.1126/science.335.6068.515 |issue=6068}}</ref>\n\n==Recovery, independent confirmation by Hubble and further additional findings==\nOn October 24, 2012, a team led by Thayne Currie at the [[University of Toronto]] announced the first independent recovery of Fomalhaut b and revived the claim that Fomalhaut b identifies a planet.<ref name=\"Currie\"/> They reanalyzed the original Hubble data using new, more powerful algorithms for separating planet light from starlight and confirmed that Fomalhaut b does exist.

They considered two models to explain the SED: (1) a large circumplanetary disk around a massive, but unseen, planet and (2) the aftermath of a collision during the past 100 years of two Kuiper belt objects of radii about 50&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\nSubsequent Hubble data obtained in 2010 and 2012 with the [[STIS]] instrument by [[Paul Kalas]] and collaborators again recovered Fomalhaut b<ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>.   However, analysis of Fomalhaut b's astrometry showed that the object has a high eccentricity (e = 0.8), its orbit (projected on the sky) crosses the plane of Fomalhaut's debris ring, and thus it is unlikely to be the object sculpting the debris ring's sharp inner edge.  Fomalhaut b's high eccentricity may be evidence for a significant dynamical interaction with a hitherto unseen planet at a smaller orbital separation.\n\nThe revival of the claim that Fomalhaut b is (possibly) a planet after it had been discounted led some to nickname the object a \"zombie planet\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/fomalhaut-exo.html|work=NASA |title= New Study Brings a Doubted Exoplanet 'Back from the Dead'|accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> although this is a non-technical term used in press material and does not appear in any peer-reviewed manuscript.\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n\nAssuming that Fomalhaut b's orbit is in the same plane as the debris disk located exterior to it, it orbits [[Fomalhaut]] at a distance of approximately {{convert|115|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}}.

Fomalhaut b appears to be moving at about 4 kilometers per second.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>  While it is unclear whether Fomalhaut b's orbit will make it cross the debris disk or cross the debris disk only in projection (i.e. it is not orbiting in the same plane as the disk), its orbit is not completely nested within the debris disk<ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>.\n\nAt the optical wavelengths at which Fomalhaut b is detected, it is only about 2.7\u00d710<sup>\u221210</sup> times as bright as the star and is the faintest (intrinsically) extrasolar object yet imaged.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/>  The shape of its spectrum, as determined from measurements obtained at 0.4&nbsp;to&nbsp;0.8&nbsp;\u03bcm, appears similar to that of its host star, suggesting that the emission identifying Fomalhaut b is completely due to scattered starlight<ref name=\"Currie\"/>.  Although the initial discovery paper for Fomalhaut b suggested that its optical brightness may be variable due to [[planetary accretion]], later reanalyses of these data fail to find convincing evidence that Fomalhaut b is indeed variable,<ref name=\"Currie\"/><ref name=\"Galicher\"/> <ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>thus eliminating evidence for planetary accretion and also for a 'transient' dust cloud.\n\nIn order for Fomalhaut b to be detectable at optical wavelengths, it must have an emitting area much larger than the physical size of a planet,<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/> a fact further strengthening the case that what we see as Fomalhaut b is not light coming from a planetary atmosphere.  A circumplanetary ring system is large enough to scatter enough starlight to make Fomalhaut b visible only if it has a radius between 20 and 40 times that of Jupiter's radius.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/>  A spherical cloud of dust with a radius of {{convert|0.004|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}} can make Fomalhaut b visible.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>  Fomalhaut b appears as an unresolved point source in the highest-quality data (at 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm) which would suggest that its projected emitting area cannot be larger than about 0.25 AU, about 1/4th of the Earth\u2013Sun distance.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/><ref name=\"Currie\"/> However, it may be resolved at slightly longer wavelengths, which would indicate that its emitting area is larger.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\nThe mass of Fomalhaut b, if a planet, is highly uncertain.  Infrared non-detections suggest that Fomalhaut b cannot be more massive than 2 times [[Jupiter mass|Jupiter's mass]]<ref name=\"Currie\"/><ref name=\"Janson2012\"/> but a lower limit on the mass depends on uncertain details for the nature of Fomalhaut b, its circumplanetary environment, and the existence of other planetary-mass bodies in the system.  Models of Fomalhaut b sculpting the star's debris disk give a mass 0.5 times that of Jupiter.  Models for Fomalhaut b assuming it is surrounded by a swarm of planetesimals imply that it could be much lower mass (10\u2013100 times the [[Earth mass|mass of Earth]]).<ref name=\"Kennedy2011\"/>  If Fomalhaut b is instead one of two shepherding planets that together confine the debris disk into a narrow ring,<ref name=\"Boley2012\"/> it could be anywhere between several times the mass of [[Mars]] to slightly more massive than Earth.\n\nIf Fomalhaut b is a gas giant like Jupiter or Saturn, it probably formed several million years after the host star itself was formed, making it roughly 450 million years old.<ref name=\"Mamajek2012\">{{Cite journal |title=On the Age and Binarity of Fomalhaut |first=Eric |last=Mamajek |journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters|date=2012 |arxiv = 1206.6353|bibcode = 2012ApJ...754L..20M |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/754/2/L20 |volume=754 |pages=L20}}</ref>  Alternatively, if it is a transient dust cloud it must be extremely young,<ref name=\"Currie\"/> perhaps having formed within the last few centuries.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\n== Other planets orbiting Fomalhaut ==\n\nFomalhaut b is orbiting its host star at a wide separation, where forming massive planets is difficult.

Finally, researchers analyzing September\u2013October 2011 [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA) data for Fomalhaut's debris ring suggested an alternate hypothesis: that the ring could be shaped by much smaller, shepherding planets, neither of which needed to be Fomalhaut b.<ref name=\"Boley2012\">{{Cite journal |title=Constraining the Planetary System of Fomalhaut Using High-resolution ALMA Observations |first=Aaron |last=Boley |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=2012 |arxiv = 1204.0007|bibcode = 2012ApJ...750L..21B |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/750/1/L21 |volume=750 |pages=L21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=36681 |title=ALMA Reveals Workings of Nearby Planetary System |accessdate=2012-04-18}}</ref>  These results invoked skepticism about Fomalhaut b's status as an extrasolar planet.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20945-new-doubts-about-poster-child-of-exoplanets.html |author=Lisa Grossman |title=New doubts about 'poster child' of exoplanets |journal=New Scientist |publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd. |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yudhijit Bhattacharjee |title=Celebrated Exoplanet Vanishes in a Cloud of Dust-Or Maybe Not |journal=Science |page=515 |volume=335 |date=3 February 2012 |bibcode = 2012Sci...335..515B |doi = 10.1126/science.335.6068.515 |issue=6068}}</ref>\n\n==Recovery, independent confirmation by Hubble and further additional findings==\nOn October 24, 2012, a team led by Thayne Currie at the [[University of Toronto]] announced the first independent recovery of Fomalhaut b and revived the claim that Fomalhaut b identifies a planet.<ref name=\"Currie\"/> They reanalyzed the original Hubble data using new, more powerful algorithms for separating planet light from starlight and confirmed that Fomalhaut b does exist. They also provided a new detection of Fomalhaut b at 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m.\nThey modeled the optical detections and infrared upper limits for Fomalhaut b, showing that Fomalhaut b's emission can be completely explained by starlight scattered by small dust and arguing that this dust surrounds an unseen planetary-mass object.   Thus, they consider Fomalhaut b to plausibly be a \"planet identified from direct imaging\" even if Fomalhaut b is not, strictly speaking, a directly imaged planet insofar as the light does not come from a planetary atmosphere.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>\n\nA second paper made public a day later and led by Raphael Galicher and Christian Marois at the [[Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics]] also independently recovered Fomalhaut b and confirmed the new 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m detection, claiming the spectral energy distribution (SED) of Fomalhaut b cannot be explained as due to direct or scattered radiation from a massive planet. They considered two models to explain the SED: (1) a large circumplanetary disk around a massive, but unseen, planet and (2) the aftermath of a collision during the past 100 years of two Kuiper belt objects of radii about 50&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\nSubsequent Hubble data obtained in 2010 and 2012 with the [[STIS]] instrument by [[Paul Kalas]] and collaborators again recovered Fomalhaut b<ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>.   However, analysis of Fomalhaut b's astrometry showed that the object has a high eccentricity (e = 0.8), its orbit (projected on the sky) crosses the plane of Fomalhaut's debris ring, and thus it is unlikely to be the object sculpting the debris ring's sharp inner edge.  Fomalhaut b's high eccentricity may be evidence for a significant dynamical interaction with a hitherto unseen planet at a smaller orbital separation.\n\nThe revival of the claim that Fomalhaut b is (possibly) a planet after it had been discounted led some to nickname the object a \"zombie planet\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/fomalhaut-exo.html|work=NASA |title= New Study Brings a Doubted Exoplanet 'Back from the Dead'|accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> although this is a non-technical term used in press material and does not appear in any peer-reviewed manuscript.\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n\nAssuming that Fomalhaut b's orbit is in the same plane as the debris disk located exterior to it, it orbits [[Fomalhaut]] at a distance of approximately {{convert|115|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}}.

Fomalhaut b appears to be moving at about 4 kilometers per second.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>  While it is unclear whether Fomalhaut b's orbit will make it cross the debris disk or cross the debris disk only in projection (i.e. it is not orbiting in the same plane as the disk), its orbit is not completely nested within the debris disk<ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>.\n\nAt the optical wavelengths at which Fomalhaut b is detected, it is only about 2.7\u00d710<sup>\u221210</sup> times as bright as the star and is the faintest (intrinsically) extrasolar object yet imaged.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/>  The shape of its spectrum, as determined from measurements obtained at 0.4&nbsp;to&nbsp;0.8&nbsp;\u03bcm, appears similar to that of its host star, suggesting that the emission identifying Fomalhaut b is completely due to scattered starlight<ref name=\"Currie\"/>.  Although the initial discovery paper for Fomalhaut b suggested that its optical brightness may be variable due to [[planetary accretion]], later reanalyses of these data fail to find convincing evidence that Fomalhaut b is indeed variable,<ref name=\"Currie\"/><ref name=\"Galicher\"/> <ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>thus eliminating evidence for planetary accretion and also for a 'transient' dust cloud.\n\nIn order for Fomalhaut b to be detectable at optical wavelengths, it must have an emitting area much larger than the physical size of a planet,<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/> a fact further strengthening the case that what we see as Fomalhaut b is not light coming from a planetary atmosphere.  A circumplanetary ring system is large enough to scatter enough starlight to make Fomalhaut b visible only if it has a radius between 20 and 40 times that of Jupiter's radius.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/>  A spherical cloud of dust with a radius of {{convert|0.004|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}} can make Fomalhaut b visible.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>  Fomalhaut b appears as an unresolved point source in the highest-quality data (at 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm) which would suggest that its projected emitting area cannot be larger than about 0.25 AU, about 1/4th of the Earth\u2013Sun distance.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/><ref name=\"Currie\"/> However, it may be resolved at slightly longer wavelengths, which would indicate that its emitting area is larger.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\nThe mass of Fomalhaut b, if a planet, is highly uncertain.  Infrared non-detections suggest that Fomalhaut b cannot be more massive than 2 times [[Jupiter mass|Jupiter's mass]]<ref name=\"Currie\"/><ref name=\"Janson2012\"/> but a lower limit on the mass depends on uncertain details for the nature of Fomalhaut b, its circumplanetary environment, and the existence of other planetary-mass bodies in the system.  Models of Fomalhaut b sculpting the star's debris disk give a mass 0.5 times that of Jupiter.  Models for Fomalhaut b assuming it is surrounded by a swarm of planetesimals imply that it could be much lower mass (10\u2013100 times the [[Earth mass|mass of Earth]]).<ref name=\"Kennedy2011\"/>  If Fomalhaut b is instead one of two shepherding planets that together confine the debris disk into a narrow ring,<ref name=\"Boley2012\"/> it could be anywhere between several times the mass of [[Mars]] to slightly more massive than Earth.\n\nIf Fomalhaut b is a gas giant like Jupiter or Saturn, it probably formed several million years after the host star itself was formed, making it roughly 450 million years old.<ref name=\"Mamajek2012\">{{Cite journal |title=On the Age and Binarity of Fomalhaut |first=Eric |last=Mamajek |journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters|date=2012 |arxiv = 1206.6353|bibcode = 2012ApJ...754L..20M |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/754/2/L20 |volume=754 |pages=L20}}</ref>  Alternatively, if it is a transient dust cloud it must be extremely young,<ref name=\"Currie\"/> perhaps having formed within the last few centuries.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\n== Other planets orbiting Fomalhaut ==\n\nFomalhaut b is orbiting its host star at a wide separation, where forming massive planets is difficult.
