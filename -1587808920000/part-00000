The most formal is a '''government''', a body whose sole responsibility and authority is to make binding decisions in a given [[geopolitical]] system (such as a [[sovereign state|state]]) by establishing [[law]]s. Other types of governing include an organization (such as a [[corporation]] recognized as a legal entity by a government), a socio-political group ([[chiefdom]], tribe, [[gang]], family, [[religious denomination]], etc.), or another, informal [[social group | group]] of people. In [[business sector | business]] and [[outsourcing]] relationships, [[Governance Frameworks]] are built{{by whom?|date=September 2018}} into [[relational contract]]s that foster long-term collaboration and innovation.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nGovernance is the way rules, norms and actions are structured, sustained, regulated and held [[accountability |accountable]].{{cn|date=September 2018}} The degree of formality depends on the internal rules of a given [[organization]] and, externally, with its [[business partner]]s. As such, governance may take many forms, driven by many different motivations and with many different results. For instance, a government may operate as a [[democracy]] where citizens vote on who should govern and the [[Public good (economics)|public good]] is the goal, while a [[non-profit organization]] or a [[corporation]] may be governed by a small [[board of directors]] and pursue more specific aims.\n\nIn addition, a variety of external actors without decision-making power can influence the process of governing. These include [[lobbying |lobbies]], [[think tanks]], [[political parties]], [[non-government organizations]], community and [[Media (communication) | media]].\n\n==Origin of the word==\n{{Disputed section|Origins of the word|date=August 2016}}\nLike ''government'', the word ''governance'' derives, ultimately, from the Greek verb kubernaein [''kubern\u00e1o''] (meaning ''to steer'', the metaphorical sense first being attested in [[Plato]]). Its occasional use in English to refer to the specific activity of ruling a country can be traced to early modern England, when the phrase \"governance of the realm\" appears in works by [[William Tyndale]]<ref name=\"TyndaleFrith1831\">\"When the king's grace came first to the right of the crown, and unto the governance of the realm young and unexpert...\" {{cite book|author1=William Tyndale|author2=John Frith|title=The works of Tyndale|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_8qoMAAAAIAAJ|year=1831|publisher=Ebenezer Palmer|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_8qoMAAAAIAAJ/page/n367 452]}}</ref> and in royal correspondence between [[James V of Scotland]] and [[Henry VIII of England]].<ref>\"We have put all our confidence, has als actyflie with ye help of our derrest Modir takin on Ws ye governance of our Realme\": {{cite book|title=State Papers: King Henry the Eighth; Part IV.|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hs0_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA95|year=1836|publisher=Murray|page=95|chapter=Letter of James V to Henry VIII}}</ref> The first usage in connection with institutional structures (as distinct from individual rule) is in Charles Plummer's ''The Governance of England'' (an 1885 translation from a 15th-century Latin work by [[John Fortescue (judge)|John Fortescue]], also known as ''The Difference between an Absolute and a Limited Monarchy''). This usage of governance to refer to the arrangements of governing became orthodox including in [[Sidney Low]]\u2019s seminal text of the same title in 1904 and among some later British constitutional historians.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://courtingthelaw.com/2015/11/09/commentary/the-concept-of-good-governance-in-modern-world-and-governance-by-caliphs-of-islam-part-i/|title=The Concept of Good Governance in Modern World and Governance by Caliphs of Islam \u2013 Part I|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the use of the term ''governance'' in its current broader sense, encompassing the activities of a wide range of public and private institutions, acquired general currency only as recently as the 1990s, when it was re-minted by economists and political scientists and disseminated by institutions such as the [[United Nations|UN]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[World Bank]].<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/governance/docs/doc5_fr.pdf \u00c9tymologie du terme \"gouvernance\"], document prepared by the [[European Commission]].</ref> Since then, the term has steadily gained increasing usage.\n\n==Types==\nGovernance often refers to a particular level of governance associated with a type of organization (including public governance, global governance, non-profit governance, corporate governance, and project governance), a particular 'field' of governance associated with a type of activity or outcome (including environmental governance, internet governance, and information technology governance), or a particular 'model' of governance, often derived as an empirical or normative theory (including regulatory governance, participatory governance, multilevel governance, metagovernance, and collaborative governance).\n\nGovernance can also define normative or practical agendas. Normative concepts of fair governance or good governance are common among [[Politics|political]], [[public sector]], [[Volunteering|voluntary]], and [[private sector]] organizations.\n\n===Governance as process===\n{{Unreferenced section|date = December 2013}}In its most abstract sense, governance is a theoretical concept referring to the actions and processes by which stable practices and organizations arise and persist.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qlZoDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36&dq=In+its+most+abstract+sense,+governance+is+a+theoretical+concept+referring+to+the+actions+and+processes+by+which+stable+practices+and+organizations+arise+and+persist.#v=onepage&q=In%20its%20most%20abstract%20sense,%20governance%20is%20a%20theoretical%20concept%20referring%20to%20the%20actions%20and%20processes%20by%20which%20stable%20practices%20and%20organizations%20arise%20and%20persist.&f=false|title=New Humanism and Global Governance|last=Lijun|first= Yang |last2 =Wei|first2=Shan|date=1998-08-14|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9789813236196|language=en}}</ref> These actions and processes may operate in formal and informal organizations of any size; and they may function for any purpose, good or evil, for profit or not. Conceiving of governance in this way, one can apply the concept to [[State (polity)|states]], to [[corporation]]s, to [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]]s, to [[NGO]]s, to partnerships and other associations, to business relationships (especially complex [[outsourcing]] relationships), to [[project team]]s, and to any number of humans engaged in some purposeful activity.\n\nMost theories of governance as process arose out of [[neoclassical economics]].<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://science.jrank.org/pages/9055/Economics-Major-Theories.html|title=Economics \u2013 Major Theories |website= science.jrank.org|language=en|access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref> These theories build deductive models, based on the assumptions of modern economics, to show how rational actors may come to establish and sustain formal organizations, including firms and states, and informal organizations, such as networks and practices for governing the commons. Many of these theories draw on [[transaction cost]] economics.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Williamson|first= Oliver E. |date = 1979|title = Transaction-Cost Economics: The Governance of Contractual Relations|journal = Journal of Law and Economics|volume = 22|number = 2 |url = https://www.business.illinois.edu/josephm/BA549_Fall%202010/Session%203/Williamson%20%281979%29.pdf|pages = 233\u2013261 |jstor = 725118 |doi=10.1086/466942}}</ref>\n\n===Public governance===\n{{main|Public administration}}\nThere is a distinction between the concepts of governance and [[politics]]. Politics involves processes by which a group of people (perhaps with divergent opinions or interests) reach collective decisions generally regarded as binding on the group, and enforced as common [[policy]]. Governance, on the other hand, conveys the [[Public administration|administrative]] and process-oriented elements of governing rather than its antagonistic ones.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Offe | first1 = Claus | year = 2009 | title = Governance: An \"Empty Signifier\"? | url = | journal = Constellations | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 550\u201362 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8675.2009.00570.x }}</ref> Such an argument continues to assume the possibility of the traditional separation between \"politics\" and \"administration\". Contemporary governance practice and theory sometimes questions this distinction, premising that both \"governance\" and \"politics\" involve aspects of [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[accountability]].\n\nIn general terms, public governance occurs in three broad ways:\n* Through networks involving [[public-private partnership]]s (PPP) or with the collaboration of community organisations;\n* Through the use of [[Market (economics)|market]] mechanisms whereby market principles of competition serve to allocate resources while operating under government regulation;\n* Through top-down methods that primarily involve governments and the state [[bureaucracy]].\n\n===Private governance===\nPrivate governance occurs when non-governmental entities, including private organizations, dispute resolution organizations, or other third party groups, make rules and/or standards which have a binding effect on the \"quality of life and opportunities of the larger public.\"  Simply put, private\u2014not public\u2014entities are making [[public policy]]. For example, insurance companies exert a great societal impact, largely invisible and freely accepted, that is a private form of governance in society; in turn, reinsurers, as private companies, may exert similar private governance over their underlying carriers.<ref>{{cite journal|first = Marcos |last = Mendoza|title = Reinsurance as Governance: Governmental Risk Management Pools as a Case Study in the Governance Role Played by Reinsurance Institutions|volume = 21|journal = Conn. Ins. L. J.|pages = 53, 68\u201370|date = 2014|ssrn = 2573253}}</ref> The term \"public policy\" should not be exclusively associated with policy that is made by [[government]]. Public policy may be created by either the private sector or the public sector. If one wishes to refer only to public policy that is made by government, the best term to use is \"governmental policy,\" which eliminates the ambiguity regarding the agent of the policy making.\n\n===Global governance===\n{{main|Global governance}}\nGlobal governance is defined as \"the complex of formal and informal institutions, mechanisms, relationships, and processes between and among states, markets, citizens and organizations, both inter- and non-governmental, through which collective interests on the global plane are articulated, right and obligations are established, and differences are mediated\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thakur|first1=Ramesh|last2=Van Langenhove|first2=Luk|title=Enhancing Global Governance through Regional Integration|journal=Global Governance|date=2006|volume=12|issue=3 July, September|pages=233\u201340|doi=10.1163/19426720-01203002}}</ref> In contrast to the traditional meaning of \"governance\", some authors like [[James Rosenau]] have used the term \"global governance\" to denote the regulation of interdependent relations in the absence of an overarching political authority.<ref>James N. Rosenau, \"Toward an Ontology for Global Governance\", in Martin Hewson and Thomas Sinclair, eds., ''Approaches to Global Governance Theory'', SUNY Press, Albany, 1999.</ref> The best example of this is the international system or relationships between independent states. The term, however, can apply wherever a group of free equals needs to form a regular relationship.\n\n===Governance Analytical Framework===\nThe Governance Analytical Framework (GAF) is a practical methodology for investigating governance processes, where various stakeholders interact and make decisions regarding collective issues, thus creating or reinforcing social norms and institutions. It is postulated that governance processes can be found in any society, and unlike other approaches, that these can be observed and analysed from a non-[[normative]] perspective. It proposes a methodology based on five main analytical units: problems, actors, norms, processes and \"nodal points\". These logically articulated analytical units make up a coherent methodology aimed at being used as a tool for empirical [[social policy]] research.<ref name=\"Hufty 2011\"/><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hufty |first=Marc |title=Governance: Exploring four approaches and their relevance to research.

Both responsibilities relate to fiduciary responsibility that a board of trustees (sometimes called directors, or Board, or Management Committee\u2014the terms are interchangeable) has with respect to the exercise of authority over the explicit actions the organization takes. Public trust and accountability is an essential aspect of organizational viability so it achieves the social mission in a way that is respected by those whom the organization serves and the society in which it is located.\n\n===Corporate governance===\n{{main|Corporate governance}}\n[[Corporation|Corporate organizations]] often use the word ''governance'' to describe both:\n# The manner in which [[Board of directors|board]]s or their like direct a corporation\n# The laws and customs (rules) applying to that direction\n\nCorporate governance consists of the set of processes, customs, policies, laws and institutions affecting the way people direct, administer or control a corporation. Corporate governance also includes the relationships among the many players involved (the [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]) and the corporate [[goal]]s. The principal players include the [[shareholder]]s, [[management]], and the [[board of directors]]. Other stakeholders include employees, suppliers, customers, banks and other lenders, regulators, the environment and the community at large.\n\nThe first documented use of the word \"corporate governance\" is by Richard Eells (1960, p.&nbsp;108) to denote \"the structure and functioning of the corporate polity\". The \"corporate government\" concept itself is older and was already used in finance textbooks at the beginning of the 20th century (Becht, Bolton, R\u00f6ell 2004).\n\n===Project governance===\n{{main|Project governance}}\nProject governance is the management framework within which project decisions are made. Its role is to provide a repeatable and robust system through which an organization can manage its capital investments\u2014project governance handles tasks such as outlining the relationships between all groups involved and describing the flow of information to all [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]].\n\n===Environmental governance===\n{{main|Environmental governance}}Governance in an environmental context may refer to:\n\n* a concept in [[political ecology]] which promotes [[environmental policy]] that advocates for [[Sustainability|sustainable]] human activity (i.e. that governance should be based upon environmental principles).\n* the processes of decision-making involved in the control and management of the environment and [[natural resource]]s. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), define environmental governance as the \"multi-level interactions (i.e., local, national, international/global) among, but not limited to, three main actors, i.e., state, [[Market (economics)|market]], and civil society, which interact with one another, whether in formal and informal ways; in formulating and implementing policies in response to environment-related demands and inputs from the society; bound by rules, procedures, processes, and widely accepted behavior; possessing characteristics of '[[good governance]]'; for the purpose of attaining environmentally-[[sustainable development]].\"\n\n===Land governance===\nLand governance is concerned with issues of land ownership and tenure. It consists of the policies, processes and institutions by which decisions about the access to, use of and control over land are made, implemented and enforced; it is also about managing and reconciling competing claims on land. In developing countries, it is relevant as a tool to contribute to equitable and sustainable development, addressing the phenomenon that is known as \u2018[[land grabbing]]\u2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.focusonland.com/property-rights-issues/land-governance-and-law-1/|title=Focus on Land|website=Focus on Land|language=en|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref><ref>[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTARD/Resources/335807-1194987153844/UNHABITATFricska.ppt Policy Paper: Good Land Governance]. Global Land Tool Network, no date.</ref> The operational dimension of land governance is [[land administration]].\n\nSecurity of land tenure is considered to contribute to poverty reduction and food security, since it can enable farmers to fully participate in the economy. Without recognized property rights, it is hard for small entrepreneurs, farmers included, to obtain credit or sell their business<ref>[[Hernando de Soto Polar|De Soto, Hernando]]. [http://www.basicbooks.com/full-details?isbn=9780465016150 The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else]. New York: Basic Books. 2000</ref> \u2013 hence the relevance of comprehensive land governance.\n\nThere is constant feedback between land tenure problems and land governance. For instance, it has been argued that what is frequently called '[[land grabbing]]', was partly made possible by the [[Washington Consensus]]-inspired liberalization of land markets in developing countries. Many land acquisition deals were perceived to have negative consequences, and this in turn led to initiatives to improve land governance in developing countries.<ref name = kaag>Mayke Kaag and Annelies Zoomers: [https://www.zedbooks.net/shop/book/the-global-land-grab/ The global land grab: beyond the hype], Zed Books, 2014</ref>\n\nThe quality of land governance depends on its practical implementation, which is known as [[land administration]]: \u2018the way in which rules of land tenure are made operational\u2019. And another factor is accountability:  the degree to which citizens and stakeholder groups are consulted and can hold to account their authorities.<ref name = kaag/>\n\nThe main international policy initiative to improve land governance is known as the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security (VGGT),<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.fao.org/nr/tenure/voluntary-guidelines/en/ |title = Voluntary Guidelines on Tenure|work = Governance of Tenure|publisher = Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations}}</ref> endorsed by the [[Committee on World Food Security]] (CFS).\n\n===Internet governance===\n{{main|Internet governance}}Internet governance was defined by the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] as \"the development and application by Governments, the private sector and civil society, in their respective roles, of shared principles, norms, rules, decision-making procedures, and programmes that shape the evolution and use of the [[Internet]].\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wgig.org/docs/WGIGREPORT.pdf|title=Report of the Working Group on Internet Governance|date=June 2005|access-date=2018-12-12}}</ref> Internet governance deals with how much influence each sector of society should have on the development of the Internet, such as to what extent the state should be able to censor it, and how issues on the Internet, such as cyber-bullying, should be approached.\n\n===Information technology governance===\n{{main|Information technology governance}}\nIT governance primarily deals with connections between business focus and IT management. The goal of clear governance is to assure that investment in IT generates business value and mitigates the risks that are associated with IT projects.<ref>{{cite web | last = Smallwood | first= Deb | work= Tech Decision CIO Insights | title = IT Governance: A Simple Model | date = March 2009 | url = http://www.ebizq.net/blogs/insurance/2009/02/it_governance_a_simple_model.php\n| accessdate = }}</ref>\n\n=== Blockchain governance ===\n[[Blockchain|Blockchains]] offer a novel way to enforce agreements and achieve cooperation and coordination. The main technical features of blockchains support transparency and traceability of records, information immutability and reliability, and autonomous enforcement of agreements. As such, blockchains will affect traditional forms of governance\u2014most notably, contractual and relational governance\u2014and may change the way to organize collaborations between individuals and between organizations. Blockchain governance relies on a set of protocols and code-based rules. As an original governance mode, it departs from an enforcement through the law (as in contractual governance) or through the value of future relationships (as in relational governance).\n\n===Regulatory governance===\n{{main|Regulatory governance}}\nRegulatory governance reflects the emergence of decentered and mutually adaptive policy regimes which rests on regulation rather than service provision or taxing and spending.<ref>David Levi-Faur, \"Regulation & Regulatory Governance\", in David Levi-Faur, Handbook on the Politics of Regulation, Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, 2011, pp. 1\u201320.</ref> The term captures the tendency of policy regimes to deal with complexity with delegated system of rules. It is likely to appear in arenas and nations which are more complex, more global, more contested and more liberally democratic.<ref>Braithwaite, John, Cary Coglianese, and David Levi\u2010Faur. \"Can regulation and governance make a difference?.\" Regulation & Governance 1.1 (2007): 1\u20137.</ref> The term builds upon and extends the terms of the regulatory state on the one hand and governance on the other. While the term regulatory state marginalize non-state actors (NGOs and Business) in the domestic and global level, the term governance marginalizes regulation as a constitutive instrument of governance. The term regulatory governance therefore allows us to understand governance beyond the state and governance via regulation.\n\n===Participatory governance===\nParticipatory governance focuses on deepening democratic engagement through the participation of citizens in the processes of governance with the state. The idea is that citizens should play a more direct roles in public decision-making or at least engage more deeply with political issues. Government officials should also be responsive to this kind of engagement. In practice, participatory governance can supplement the roles of citizens as voters or as watchdogs through more direct forms of involvement.<ref>[http://www.ids.ac.uk/publication/triumph-deficit-or-contestation-deepening-the-deepening-democracy-debate 'Triumph, Deficit or Contestation?

Emerging thinking about contract governance is focusing on creating a governance structure in which the parties have a vested interest in managing what are often highly complex contractual arrangements in a more collaborative, aligned, flexible, and credible way.<ref>Unpacking Outsourcing Governance: How to Build a Sound Governance Structure to Drive Insight Versus Oversight|[http://www.vestedway.com/vested-library/]|2015|Vested Way|accessed 17 August 2016</ref> In 1979, Nobel laureate Oliver Williamson wrote that the governance structure for a contract is the \"framework within which the integrity of a transaction is decided\", adding further that \"because contracts are varied and complex, governance structures vary with the nature of the transaction.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Oliver|date=1979-10-01|title=Transaction-Cost Economics: The Governance of Contractual Relations|url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/jle/vol22/iss2/3|journal=Journal of Law and Economics|volume=22|issue=2|pages=233\u2013261|doi=10.1086/466942}}</ref>\n\n===Multi-level governance===\n{{main|Multi-level governance}}Multi-level governance is the concept and study of the fact that many intertangled authority structures are present in a global political economy. The theory of multi-level governance, developed mainly by [[Liesbet Hooghe]] and [[Gary Marks]], arose from increasing [[European integration]], particularly through the [[European Union]]. [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso]], former [[President of the European Commission|President]] of the [[European Commission]], has stated that \"the multilevel system of governance on which our European regional policy is based provides a key boost to the Union's competitive edge\" and that, in times of economic crisis, \"multilevel governance must be a priority.\"\n\n===Metagovernance===\n\"Metagovernance\" is the \"governing of governing\".<ref>Kooiman, J. ''Governing as Governance''. Sage publications 2003. p. 170.</ref> It represents the established ethical principles, or 'norms', that shape and steer the entire governing process. It is important to note that there are no clearly defined settings within which metagoverning takes place, or particular persons who are responsible for it. While some{{Who|date=January 2012}} believe metagovernance to be the role of the state which is assumed to want to steer actors in a particular direction, it can \"potentially be exercised by any resourceful actor\"<ref>Sorensen, E.

Despite their different sources, both seek to establish values in such a way that they become accepted 'norms'. The fact that 'norms' can be established at any level and can then be used to shape the governance process as whole, means metagovernance is part of both the input and the output of the governing system.<ref>Kooiman, J. ''Governing as Governance''. Sage publications 2003. p. 171.</ref>\n\n===Collaborative governance===\n{{Main|Collaborative governance}}\nA collaborative governance framework uses a relationship management structure, joint performance and transformation management processes and an exit management plan as controlling mechanisms to encourage the organizations to make ethical, proactive changes for the mutual benefit of all the parties.<ref name=\"Vitasek\">{{cite book|last=Vitasek|first=Kate|display-authors=etal |title=The Vested Outsourcing Manual|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0230112681|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n=== Security sector governance ===\n{{Main|Security sector governance and reform}}\nSecurity sector governance (SSG) is a subpart concept or framework of security governance that focuses specifically on decisions about [[security]] and their implementation within the [[National security|security sector]] of a single state.

In the case of a [[business]] or of a [[non-profit organization]], for example, good governance relates to consistent management, cohesive policies, guidance, processes and decision-rights for a given area of responsibility, and proper oversight and accountability. \"Good governance\" implies that mechanisms function in a way that allows the executives (the \"agents\") to respect the rights and interests of the [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] (the \"principals\"), in a spirit of [[democracy]].\n\n===Good governance===\n{{Main|Good governance}}\nGood governance is an indeterminate term used in international development literature to describe various normative accounts of how public institutions ought to conduct public affairs and manage public resources. These normative accounts are often justified on the grounds that they are thought to be conducive to economic ends, such as the eradication of poverty and successful economic development. Unsurprisingly different organizations have defined governance and good governance differently to promote different normative ends.\n\nThe [[World Bank]] defines governance as:\n{{quote|the manner in which power is exercised in the management of a country's economic and social resources for development.<ref>World Bank, [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/03/07/000090341_20060307104630/Rendered/PDF/34899.pdf Managing Development \u2013 The Governance Dimension], 1991, Washington D.C., p. 1</ref>}}\n\nThe [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] project of the World Bank defines governance as:\n{{quote|the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/1740479-1150402582357/2661829-1158008871017/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf |title = A Decade of Measuring the Quality of Governance|date = 2006|publisher = The World Bank}}</ref>}}\n\nThis considers the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced; the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound policies and the respect of citizens and the state of the institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them.\n\nAn alternate definition sees governance as:\n{{quote|the use of institutions, structures of authority and even [[collaboration]] to allocate [[Resource (economics)|resources]] and coordinate or control activity in society or the economy''.<ref>Bell, Stephen, 2002. Economic Governance and Institutional Dynamics, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, Australia.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to the [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s Regional Project on Local Governance for Latin America:\n\n{{quote|Governance has been defined as the rules of the political system to solve conflicts between actors and adopt decision (legality). It has also been used to describe the \"proper functioning of institutions and their acceptance by the public\" (legitimacy). And it has been used to invoke the efficacy of government and the achievement of consensus by democratic means (participation).<ref>This is a very widely cited definition, as in [http://info.publicintelligence.net/ISAFgovernance.pdf Applebaugh, J. (rapporteur), \"Governance Working Group\", power-point presentation, National Defense University and ISAF, 2010, slide 22].</ref>}}\n\n===Measurement and assessment===\n\nSince the early years of the 2000s (decade),{{When|date=January 2012}} efforts have been conducted in the research and international development community to assess and measure the quality of governance of countries all around the [[world]]. Measuring governance is inherently a controversial and somewhat political exercise. A distinction is therefore made between external assessments, peer assessments and self-assessments. Examples of external assessments are donor assessments or comparative indices produced by international non-governmental organizations. An example of a peer assessment is the [[African Peer Review Mechanism]]. Examples of self-assessments are country-led assessments that can be led by government, civil society, researchers and/or other stakeholders at the national level.\n\nOne of these efforts to create an internationally comparable measure of governance and an example of an external assessment is the [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] project, developed by members of the World Bank and the [[World Bank Institute]]. The project reports aggregate and individual indicators for more than 200 countries for six dimensions of governance: voice and accountability, political stability and lack of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, [[rule of law]], control of corruption. To complement the macro-level cross-country Worldwide Governance Indicators, the World Bank Institute developed the [[World Bank Governance Surveys]], which are country-level governance assessment tools that operate at the micro or sub-national level and use information gathered from a country's own citizens, business people and public sector workers to diagnose governance vulnerabilities and suggest concrete approaches for fighting corruption.\n\nA Worldwide Governance Index (WGI)<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article469 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144807/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article469 | url-status = dead | archive-date = 4 October 2011 | title = World Governance Index 2009 Report | publisher = World Governance | accessdate = 3 February 2013 }}</ref> was developed in 2009 and is open for improvement through public participation. The following domains, in the form of indicators and composite indexes, were selected to achieve the development of the WGI: Peace and Security, Rule of Law, Human Rights and Participation, Sustainable Development, and Human Development. Additionally, in 2009 the Bertelsmann Foundation published the [[Sustainable Governance Indicators]] (SGI), which systematically measure the need for reform and the capacity for reform within the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) countries. The project examines to what extent governments can identify, formulate and implement effective reforms that render a society well-equipped to meet future challenges, and ensure their future viability.<ref>{{cite book | chapterurl = http://www.sgi-network.de/index.php?page=mission  | accessdate = | last = Empter  | first1 = Stefan  | first2 = Josef | last2 = Janning  | chapter=Sustainable Governance Indicators 2009 \u2013 An Introduction | editor-first  = Bertelsmann | editor-last = Stiftung | year = 2009| title = Policy Performance and Executive Capacity in the OECD | location = G\u00fctersloh | publisher = Verlag Bertelsmann Stiftung}}</ref> Section 10 of the [[Government Performance and Results Act]] (GPRA) Modernization Act requires U.S. federal agencies to publish their strategic and performance plans and reports in machine-readable format.\n\nThe International Budget Partnership (IBP) launched the Open Budget Initiative in 2006 with the release of the first Open Budget Survey (OBS). The OBS is a comprehensive analysis and survey that evaluates whether central governments give the public access to budget documents and provide opportunities for public participation in the budget process. To measure the overall commitment to transparency, the IBP created Open Budget Index (OBI), which assigns a score to each country based on the results of the survey. While the OBS is released biannually, the IBP recently released a new OBS Tracker, which serves as an online tool for civil society, the media, and other actors to monitor in real time whether governments are releasing eight key budget documents. The Open Budget Index data are used by the [[Open Government Partnership]], development aid agencies, and increasingly investors in the private sector as key indicators of governance, particularly fiscal transparency and management of public funds.<ref>Castro, Michael, 12 September 2013, [http://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/michael-castro/2013/09/12/open-budgets-key-open-government-next-steps-ogp-countries#sthash.cFZvst8q.dpuf Open Budgets Key to Open Government: Next Steps for OGP Countries] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221183910/http://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/michael-castro/2013/09/12/open-budgets-key-open-government-next-steps-ogp-countries#sthash.cFZvst8q.dpuf |date=2016-12-21 }}, retrieved 2 December 2014</ref> Examples of country-led assessments include the Indonesian Democracy Index, monitoring of the Millennium Development Goal 9 on Human Rights and Democratic Governance in Mongolia and the Gross National Happiness Index in Bhutan.\n\nSection 10 of the [[Government Performance and Results Act]] Modernization Act (GPRAMA) requires U.S. federal agencies to publish their performance plans and reports in machine-readable format, thereby providing the basis for evaluating the quality of their performance of the governance functions entrusted to them, as specified in their strategic objectives and performance indicators.

The most formal is a '''government''', a body whose sole responsibility and authority is to make binding decisions in a given [[geopolitical]] system (such as a [[sovereign state|state]]) by establishing [[law]]s. Other types of governing include an organization (such as a [[corporation]] recognized as a legal entity by a government), a socio-political group ([[chiefdom]], tribe, [[gang]], family, [[religious denomination]], etc.), or another, informal [[social group | group]] of people. In [[business sector | business]] and [[outsourcing]] relationships, [[Governance Frameworks]] are built{{by whom?|date=September 2018}} into [[relational contract]]s that foster long-term collaboration and innovation.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nGovernance is the way rules, norms and actions are structured, sustained, regulated and held [[accountability |accountable]].{{cn|date=September 2018}} The degree of formality depends on the internal rules of a given [[organization]] and, externally, with its [[business partner]]s. As such, governance may take many forms, driven by many different motivations and with many different results. For instance, a government may operate as a [[democracy]] where citizens vote on who should govern and the [[Public good (economics)|public good]] is the goal, while a [[non-profit organization]] or a [[corporation]] may be governed by a small [[board of directors]] and pursue more specific aims.\n\nIn addition, a variety of external actors without decision-making power can influence the process of governing. These include [[lobbying |lobbies]], [[think tanks]], [[political parties]], [[non-government organizations]], community and [[Media (communication) | media]].\n\n==Origin of the word==\n{{Disputed section|Origins of the word|date=August 2016}}\nLike ''government'', the word ''governance'' derives, ultimately, from the Greek verb kubernaein [''kubern\u00e1o''] (meaning ''to steer'', the metaphorical sense first being attested in [[Plato]]). Its occasional use in English to refer to the specific activity of ruling a country can be traced to early modern England, when the phrase \"governance of the realm\" appears in works by [[William Tyndale]]<ref name=\"TyndaleFrith1831\">\"When the king's grace came first to the right of the crown, and unto the governance of the realm young and unexpert...\" {{cite book|author1=William Tyndale|author2=John Frith|title=The works of Tyndale|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_8qoMAAAAIAAJ|year=1831|publisher=Ebenezer Palmer|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_8qoMAAAAIAAJ/page/n367 452]}}</ref> and in royal correspondence between [[James V of Scotland]] and [[Henry VIII of England]].<ref>\"We have put all our confidence, has als actyflie with ye help of our derrest Modir takin on Ws ye governance of our Realme\": {{cite book|title=State Papers: King Henry the Eighth; Part IV.|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hs0_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA95|year=1836|publisher=Murray|page=95|chapter=Letter of James V to Henry VIII}}</ref> The first usage in connection with institutional structures (as distinct from individual rule) is in Charles Plummer's ''The Governance of England'' (an 1885 translation from a 15th-century Latin work by [[John Fortescue (judge)|John Fortescue]], also known as ''The Difference between an Absolute and a Limited Monarchy''). This usage of governance to refer to the arrangements of governing became orthodox including in [[Sidney Low]]\u2019s seminal text of the same title in 1904 and among some later British constitutional historians.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://courtingthelaw.com/2015/11/09/commentary/the-concept-of-good-governance-in-modern-world-and-governance-by-caliphs-of-islam-part-i/|title=The Concept of Good Governance in Modern World and Governance by Caliphs of Islam \u2013 Part I|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the use of the term ''governance'' in its current broader sense, encompassing the activities of a wide range of public and private institutions, acquired general currency only as recently as the 1990s, when it was re-minted by economists and political scientists and disseminated by institutions such as the [[United Nations|UN]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[World Bank]].<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/governance/docs/doc5_fr.pdf \u00c9tymologie du terme \"gouvernance\"], document prepared by the [[European Commission]].</ref> Since then, the term has steadily gained increasing usage.\n\n==Types==\nGovernance often refers to a particular level of governance associated with a type of organization (including public governance, global governance, non-profit governance, corporate governance, and project governance), a particular 'field' of governance associated with a type of activity or outcome (including environmental governance, internet governance, and information technology governance), or a particular 'model' of governance, often derived as an empirical or normative theory (including regulatory governance, participatory governance, multilevel governance, metagovernance, and collaborative governance).\n\nGovernance can also define normative or practical agendas. Normative concepts of fair governance or good governance are common among [[Politics|political]], [[public sector]], [[Volunteering|voluntary]], and [[private sector]] organizations.\n\n===Governance as process===\n{{Unreferenced section|date = December 2013}}In its most abstract sense, governance is a theoretical concept referring to the actions and processes by which stable practices and organizations arise and persist.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qlZoDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36&dq=In+its+most+abstract+sense,+governance+is+a+theoretical+concept+referring+to+the+actions+and+processes+by+which+stable+practices+and+organizations+arise+and+persist.#v=onepage&q=In%20its%20most%20abstract%20sense,%20governance%20is%20a%20theoretical%20concept%20referring%20to%20the%20actions%20and%20processes%20by%20which%20stable%20practices%20and%20organizations%20arise%20and%20persist.&f=false|title=New Humanism and Global Governance|last=Lijun|first= Yang |last2 =Wei|first2=Shan|date=1998-08-14|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9789813236196|language=en}}</ref> These actions and processes may operate in formal and informal organizations of any size; and they may function for any purpose, good or evil, for profit or not. Conceiving of governance in this way, one can apply the concept to [[State (polity)|states]], to [[corporation]]s, to [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]]s, to [[NGO]]s, to partnerships and other associations, to business relationships (especially complex [[outsourcing]] relationships), to [[project team]]s, and to any number of humans engaged in some purposeful activity.\n\nMost theories of governance as process arose out of [[neoclassical economics]].<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://science.jrank.org/pages/9055/Economics-Major-Theories.html|title=Economics \u2013 Major Theories |website= science.jrank.org|language=en|access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref> These theories build deductive models, based on the assumptions of modern economics, to show how rational actors may come to establish and sustain formal organizations, including firms and states, and informal organizations, such as networks and practices for governing the commons. Many of these theories draw on [[transaction cost]] economics.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Williamson|first= Oliver E. |date = 1979|title = Transaction-Cost Economics: The Governance of Contractual Relations|journal = Journal of Law and Economics|volume = 22|number = 2 |url = https://www.business.illinois.edu/josephm/BA549_Fall%202010/Session%203/Williamson%20%281979%29.pdf|pages = 233\u2013261 |jstor = 725118 |doi=10.1086/466942}}</ref>\n\n===Public governance===\n{{main|Public administration}}\nThere is a distinction between the concepts of governance and [[politics]]. Politics involves processes by which a group of people (perhaps with divergent opinions or interests) reach collective decisions generally regarded as binding on the group, and enforced as common [[policy]]. Governance, on the other hand, conveys the [[Public administration|administrative]] and process-oriented elements of governing rather than its antagonistic ones.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Offe | first1 = Claus | year = 2009 | title = Governance: An \"Empty Signifier\"? | url = | journal = Constellations | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 550\u201362 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8675.2009.00570.x }}</ref> Such an argument continues to assume the possibility of the traditional separation between \"politics\" and \"administration\". Contemporary governance practice and theory sometimes questions this distinction, premising that both \"governance\" and \"politics\" involve aspects of [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[accountability]].\n\nIn general terms, public governance occurs in three broad ways:\n* Through networks involving [[public-private partnership]]s (PPP) or with the collaboration of community organisations;\n* Through the use of [[Market (economics)|market]] mechanisms whereby market principles of competition serve to allocate resources while operating under government regulation;\n* Through top-down methods that primarily involve governments and the state [[bureaucracy]].\n\n===Private governance===\nPrivate governance occurs when non-governmental entities, including private organizations, dispute resolution organizations, or other third party groups, make rules and/or standards which have a binding effect on the \"quality of life and opportunities of the larger public.\"  Simply put, private\u2014not public\u2014entities are making [[public policy]]. For example, insurance companies exert a great societal impact, largely invisible and freely accepted, that is a private form of governance in society; in turn, reinsurers, as private companies, may exert similar private governance over their underlying carriers.<ref>{{cite journal|first = Marcos |last = Mendoza|title = Reinsurance as Governance: Governmental Risk Management Pools as a Case Study in the Governance Role Played by Reinsurance Institutions|volume = 21|journal = Conn. Ins. L. J.|pages = 53, 68\u201370|date = 2014|ssrn = 2573253}}</ref> The term \"public policy\" should not be exclusively associated with policy that is made by [[government]]. Public policy may be created by either the private sector or the public sector. If one wishes to refer only to public policy that is made by government, the best term to use is \"governmental policy,\" which eliminates the ambiguity regarding the agent of the policy making.\n\n===Global governance===\n{{main|Global governance}}\nGlobal governance is defined as \"the complex of formal and informal institutions, mechanisms, relationships, and processes between and among states, markets, citizens and organizations, both inter- and non-governmental, through which collective interests on the global plane are articulated, right and obligations are established, and differences are mediated\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thakur|first1=Ramesh|last2=Van Langenhove|first2=Luk|title=Enhancing Global Governance through Regional Integration|journal=Global Governance|date=2006|volume=12|issue=3 July, September|pages=233\u201340|doi=10.1163/19426720-01203002}}</ref> In contrast to the traditional meaning of \"governance\", some authors like [[James Rosenau]] have used the term \"global governance\" to denote the regulation of interdependent relations in the absence of an overarching political authority.<ref>James N. Rosenau, \"Toward an Ontology for Global Governance\", in Martin Hewson and Thomas Sinclair, eds., ''Approaches to Global Governance Theory'', SUNY Press, Albany, 1999.</ref> The best example of this is the international system or relationships between independent states. The term, however, can apply wherever a group of free equals needs to form a regular relationship.\n\n===Governance Analytical Framework===\nThe Governance Analytical Framework (GAF) is a practical methodology for investigating governance processes, where various stakeholders interact and make decisions regarding collective issues, thus creating or reinforcing social norms and institutions. It is postulated that governance processes can be found in any society, and unlike other approaches, that these can be observed and analysed from a non-[[normative]] perspective. It proposes a methodology based on five main analytical units: problems, actors, norms, processes and \"nodal points\". These logically articulated analytical units make up a coherent methodology aimed at being used as a tool for empirical [[social policy]] research.<ref name=\"Hufty 2011\"/><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hufty |first=Marc |title=Governance: Exploring four approaches and their relevance to research.

Both responsibilities relate to fiduciary responsibility that a board of trustees (sometimes called directors, or Board, or Management Committee\u2014the terms are interchangeable) has with respect to the exercise of authority over the explicit actions the organization takes. Public trust and accountability is an essential aspect of organizational viability so it achieves the social mission in a way that is respected by those whom the organization serves and the society in which it is located.\n\n===Corporate governance===\n{{main|Corporate governance}}\n[[Corporation|Corporate organizations]] often use the word ''governance'' to describe both:\n# The manner in which [[Board of directors|board]]s or their like direct a corporation\n# The laws and customs (rules) applying to that direction\n\nCorporate governance consists of the set of processes, customs, policies, laws and institutions affecting the way people direct, administer or control a corporation. Corporate governance also includes the relationships among the many players involved (the [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]) and the corporate [[goal]]s. The principal players include the [[shareholder]]s, [[management]], and the [[board of directors]]. Other stakeholders include employees, suppliers, customers, banks and other lenders, regulators, the environment and the community at large.\n\nThe first documented use of the word \"corporate governance\" is by Richard Eells (1960, p.&nbsp;108) to denote \"the structure and functioning of the corporate polity\". The \"corporate government\" concept itself is older and was already used in finance textbooks at the beginning of the 20th century (Becht, Bolton, R\u00f6ell 2004).\n\n===Project governance===\n{{main|Project governance}}\nProject governance is the management framework within which project decisions are made. Its role is to provide a repeatable and robust system through which an organization can manage its capital investments\u2014project governance handles tasks such as outlining the relationships between all groups involved and describing the flow of information to all [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]].\n\n===Environmental governance===\n{{main|Environmental governance}}Governance in an environmental context may refer to:\n\n* a concept in [[political ecology]] which promotes [[environmental policy]] that advocates for [[Sustainability|sustainable]] human activity (i.e. that governance should be based upon environmental principles).\n* the processes of decision-making involved in the control and management of the environment and [[natural resource]]s. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), define environmental governance as the \"multi-level interactions (i.e., local, national, international/global) among, but not limited to, three main actors, i.e., state, [[Market (economics)|market]], and civil society, which interact with one another, whether in formal and informal ways; in formulating and implementing policies in response to environment-related demands and inputs from the society; bound by rules, procedures, processes, and widely accepted behavior; possessing characteristics of '[[good governance]]'; for the purpose of attaining environmentally-[[sustainable development]].\"\n\n===Land governance===\nLand governance is concerned with issues of land ownership and tenure. It consists of the policies, processes and institutions by which decisions about the access to, use of and control over land are made, implemented and enforced; it is also about managing and reconciling competing claims on land. In developing countries, it is relevant as a tool to contribute to equitable and sustainable development, addressing the phenomenon that is known as \u2018[[land grabbing]]\u2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.focusonland.com/property-rights-issues/land-governance-and-law-1/|title=Focus on Land|website=Focus on Land|language=en|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref><ref>[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTARD/Resources/335807-1194987153844/UNHABITATFricska.ppt Policy Paper: Good Land Governance]. Global Land Tool Network, no date.</ref> The operational dimension of land governance is [[land administration]].\n\nSecurity of land tenure is considered to contribute to poverty reduction and food security, since it can enable farmers to fully participate in the economy. Without recognized property rights, it is hard for small entrepreneurs, farmers included, to obtain credit or sell their business<ref>[[Hernando de Soto Polar|De Soto, Hernando]].

New York: Basic Books. 2000</ref> \u2013 hence the relevance of comprehensive land governance.\n\nThere is constant feedback between land tenure problems and land governance. For instance, it has been argued that what is frequently called '[[land grabbing]]', was partly made possible by the [[Washington Consensus]]-inspired liberalization of land markets in developing countries. Many land acquisition deals were perceived to have negative consequences, and this in turn led to initiatives to improve land governance in developing countries.<ref name = kaag>Mayke Kaag and Annelies Zoomers: [https://www.zedbooks.net/shop/book/the-global-land-grab/ The global land grab: beyond the hype], Zed Books, 2014</ref>\n\nThe quality of land governance depends on its practical implementation, which is known as [[land administration]]: \u2018the way in which rules of land tenure are made operational\u2019. And another factor is accountability:  the degree to which citizens and stakeholder groups are consulted and can hold to account their authorities.<ref name = kaag/>\n\nThe main international policy initiative to improve land governance is known as the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security (VGGT),<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.fao.org/nr/tenure/voluntary-guidelines/en/ |title = Voluntary Guidelines on Tenure|work = Governance of Tenure|publisher = Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations}}</ref> endorsed by the [[Committee on World Food Security]] (CFS).\n\n===Internet governance===\n{{main|Internet governance}}Internet governance was defined by the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] as \"the development and application by Governments, the private sector and civil society, in their respective roles, of shared principles, norms, rules, decision-making procedures, and programmes that shape the evolution and use of the [[Internet]].\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wgig.org/docs/WGIGREPORT.pdf|title=Report of the Working Group on Internet Governance|date=June 2005|access-date=2018-12-12}}</ref> Internet governance deals with how much influence each sector of society should have on the development of the Internet, such as to what extent the state should be able to censor it, and how issues on the Internet, such as cyber-bullying, should be approached.\n\n===Information technology governance===\n{{main|Information technology governance}}\nIT governance primarily deals with connections between business focus and IT management. The goal of clear governance is to assure that investment in IT generates business value and mitigates the risks that are associated with IT projects.<ref>{{cite web | last = Smallwood | first= Deb | work= Tech Decision CIO Insights | title = IT Governance: A Simple Model | date = March 2009 | url = http://www.ebizq.net/blogs/insurance/2009/02/it_governance_a_simple_model.php\n| accessdate = }}</ref>\n\n=== Blockchain governance ===\nBlockchains offer a novel way to enforce agreements and achieve cooperation and coordination. The main technical features of blockchains support transparency and traceability of records, information immutability and reliability, and autonomous enforcement of agreements. As such, blockchains will affect traditional forms of governance\u2014most notably, contractual and relational governance\u2014and may change the way to organize collaborations between individuals and between organizations. Blockchain governance relies on a set of protocols and code-based rules. As an original governance mode, it departs from an enforcement through the law (as in contractual governance) or through the value of future relationships (as in relational governance).\n\n===Regulatory governance===\n{{main|Regulatory governance}}\nRegulatory governance reflects the emergence of decentered and mutually adaptive policy regimes which rests on regulation rather than service provision or taxing and spending.<ref>David Levi-Faur, \"Regulation & Regulatory Governance\", in David Levi-Faur, Handbook on the Politics of Regulation, Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, 2011, pp. 1\u201320.</ref> The term captures the tendency of policy regimes to deal with complexity with delegated system of rules. It is likely to appear in arenas and nations which are more complex, more global, more contested and more liberally democratic.<ref>Braithwaite, John, Cary Coglianese, and David Levi\u2010Faur. \"Can regulation and governance make a difference?.\" Regulation & Governance 1.1 (2007): 1\u20137.</ref> The term builds upon and extends the terms of the regulatory state on the one hand and governance on the other. While the term regulatory state marginalize non-state actors (NGOs and Business) in the domestic and global level, the term governance marginalizes regulation as a constitutive instrument of governance. The term regulatory governance therefore allows us to understand governance beyond the state and governance via regulation.\n\n===Participatory governance===\nParticipatory governance focuses on deepening democratic engagement through the participation of citizens in the processes of governance with the state. The idea is that citizens should play a more direct roles in public decision-making or at least engage more deeply with political issues. Government officials should also be responsive to this kind of engagement. In practice, participatory governance can supplement the roles of citizens as voters or as watchdogs through more direct forms of involvement.<ref>[http://www.ids.ac.uk/publication/triumph-deficit-or-contestation-deepening-the-deepening-democracy-debate 'Triumph, Deficit or Contestation? Deepening the 'Deepening Democracy' Debate'] Institute of Development Studies (IDS) Working Paper 264 July 2006.</ref>\n\n===Contract governance===\n(See also [[contract management]].) Emerging thinking about contract governance is focusing on creating a governance structure in which the parties have a vested interest in managing what are often highly complex contractual arrangements in a more collaborative, aligned, flexible, and credible way.<ref>Unpacking Outsourcing Governance: How to Build a Sound Governance Structure to Drive Insight Versus Oversight|[http://www.vestedway.com/vested-library/]|2015|Vested Way|accessed 17 August 2016</ref> In 1979, Nobel laureate Oliver Williamson wrote that the governance structure for a contract is the \"framework within which the integrity of a transaction is decided\", adding further that \"because contracts are varied and complex, governance structures vary with the nature of the transaction.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Oliver|date=1979-10-01|title=Transaction-Cost Economics: The Governance of Contractual Relations|url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/jle/vol22/iss2/3|journal=Journal of Law and Economics|volume=22|issue=2|pages=233\u2013261|doi=10.1086/466942}}</ref>\n\n===Multi-level governance===\n{{main|Multi-level governance}}Multi-level governance is the concept and study of the fact that many intertangled authority structures are present in a global political economy. The theory of multi-level governance, developed mainly by [[Liesbet Hooghe]] and [[Gary Marks]], arose from increasing [[European integration]], particularly through the [[European Union]]. [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso]], former [[President of the European Commission|President]] of the [[European Commission]], has stated that \"the multilevel system of governance on which our European regional policy is based provides a key boost to the Union's competitive edge\" and that, in times of economic crisis, \"multilevel governance must be a priority.\"\n\n===Metagovernance===\n\"Metagovernance\" is the \"governing of governing\".<ref>Kooiman, J. ''Governing as Governance''. Sage publications 2003. p. 170.</ref> It represents the established ethical principles, or 'norms', that shape and steer the entire governing process. It is important to note that there are no clearly defined settings within which metagoverning takes place, or particular persons who are responsible for it. While some{{Who|date=January 2012}} believe metagovernance to be the role of the state which is assumed to want to steer actors in a particular direction, it can \"potentially be exercised by any resourceful actor\"<ref>Sorensen, E. Metagovernance: The Changing Role of Politicians in Processes of Democratic Governance. ''American Review of Public Administration.'' Volume 36 2006, pp. 98\u2013114 (p. 103).</ref> who wishes to influence the governing process. Examples of this include the publishing of codes of conduct at the highest level of international government,<ref>Onyango, P & Jentoft, S. Assessing Poverty in small-scale fisheries in Lake Victoria, Tanzania.''Fish and Fisheries''. Volume 11 2010, pp. 250\u201363 (p. 258).</ref> and media focus on specific issues<ref name=\"evans\">Evans, J. ''Environmental Governance''. Routledge 2012. p. 40.</ref> at the sociocultural level. Despite their different sources, both seek to establish values in such a way that they become accepted 'norms'. The fact that 'norms' can be established at any level and can then be used to shape the governance process as whole, means metagovernance is part of both the input and the output of the governing system.<ref>Kooiman, J. ''Governing as Governance''. Sage publications 2003. p. 171.</ref>\n\n===Collaborative governance===\n{{Main|Collaborative governance}}\nA collaborative governance framework uses a relationship management structure, joint performance and transformation management processes and an exit management plan as controlling mechanisms to encourage the organizations to make ethical, proactive changes for the mutual benefit of all the parties.<ref name=\"Vitasek\">{{cite book|last=Vitasek|first=Kate|display-authors=etal |title=The Vested Outsourcing Manual|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0230112681|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n=== Security sector governance ===\n{{Main|Security sector governance and reform}}\nSecurity sector governance (SSG) is a subpart concept or framework of security governance that focuses specifically on decisions about [[security]] and their implementation within the [[National security|security sector]] of a single state. SSG applies the principles of [[good governance]] to the security sector in question.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://dcaf.ch|title=Security Sector Governance|last=|first=|publisher=Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF)|year=2015|isbn=|series=SSR Backgrounder Series|location=Geneva|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==As a normative concept==\n\n===Fair governance===\n\nWhen discussing governance in particular organizations, the quality of governance within the organization is often compared to a standard of [[good governance]]. In the case of a [[business]] or of a [[non-profit organization]], for example, good governance relates to consistent management, cohesive policies, guidance, processes and decision-rights for a given area of responsibility, and proper oversight and accountability. \"Good governance\" implies that mechanisms function in a way that allows the executives (the \"agents\") to respect the rights and interests of the [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] (the \"principals\"), in a spirit of [[democracy]].\n\n===Good governance===\n{{Main|Good governance}}\nGood governance is an indeterminate term used in international development literature to describe various normative accounts of how public institutions ought to conduct public affairs and manage public resources. These normative accounts are often justified on the grounds that they are thought to be conducive to economic ends, such as the eradication of poverty and successful economic development. Unsurprisingly different organizations have defined governance and good governance differently to promote different normative ends.\n\nThe [[World Bank]] defines governance as:\n{{quote|the manner in which power is exercised in the management of a country's economic and social resources for development.<ref>World Bank, [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/03/07/000090341_20060307104630/Rendered/PDF/34899.pdf Managing Development \u2013 The Governance Dimension], 1991, Washington D.C., p. 1</ref>}}\n\nThe [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] project of the World Bank defines governance as:\n{{quote|the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/1740479-1150402582357/2661829-1158008871017/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf |title = A Decade of Measuring the Quality of Governance|date = 2006|publisher = The World Bank}}</ref>}}\n\nThis considers the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced; the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound policies and the respect of citizens and the state of the institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them.\n\nAn alternate definition sees governance as:\n{{quote|the use of institutions, structures of authority and even [[collaboration]] to allocate [[Resource (economics)|resources]] and coordinate or control activity in society or the economy''.<ref>Bell, Stephen, 2002. Economic Governance and Institutional Dynamics, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, Australia.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to the [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s Regional Project on Local Governance for Latin America:\n\n{{quote|Governance has been defined as the rules of the political system to solve conflicts between actors and adopt decision (legality). It has also been used to describe the \"proper functioning of institutions and their acceptance by the public\" (legitimacy). And it has been used to invoke the efficacy of government and the achievement of consensus by democratic means (participation).<ref>This is a very widely cited definition, as in [http://info.publicintelligence.net/ISAFgovernance.pdf Applebaugh, J. (rapporteur), \"Governance Working Group\", power-point presentation, National Defense University and ISAF, 2010, slide 22].</ref>}}\n\n===Measurement and assessment===\n\nSince the early years of the 2000s (decade),{{When|date=January 2012}} efforts have been conducted in the research and international development community to assess and measure the quality of governance of countries all around the [[world]]. Measuring governance is inherently a controversial and somewhat political exercise. A distinction is therefore made between external assessments, peer assessments and self-assessments. Examples of external assessments are donor assessments or comparative indices produced by international non-governmental organizations. An example of a peer assessment is the [[African Peer Review Mechanism]]. Examples of self-assessments are country-led assessments that can be led by government, civil society, researchers and/or other stakeholders at the national level.\n\nOne of these efforts to create an internationally comparable measure of governance and an example of an external assessment is the [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] project, developed by members of the World Bank and the [[World Bank Institute]]. The project reports aggregate and individual indicators for more than 200 countries for six dimensions of governance: voice and accountability, political stability and lack of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, [[rule of law]], control of corruption. To complement the macro-level cross-country Worldwide Governance Indicators, the World Bank Institute developed the [[World Bank Governance Surveys]], which are country-level governance assessment tools that operate at the micro or sub-national level and use information gathered from a country's own citizens, business people and public sector workers to diagnose governance vulnerabilities and suggest concrete approaches for fighting corruption.\n\nA Worldwide Governance Index (WGI)<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article469 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144807/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article469 | url-status = dead | archive-date = 4 October 2011 | title = World Governance Index 2009 Report | publisher = World Governance | accessdate = 3 February 2013 }}</ref> was developed in 2009 and is open for improvement through public participation. The following domains, in the form of indicators and composite indexes, were selected to achieve the development of the WGI: Peace and Security, Rule of Law, Human Rights and Participation, Sustainable Development, and Human Development. Additionally, in 2009 the Bertelsmann Foundation published the [[Sustainable Governance Indicators]] (SGI), which systematically measure the need for reform and the capacity for reform within the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) countries. The project examines to what extent governments can identify, formulate and implement effective reforms that render a society well-equipped to meet future challenges, and ensure their future viability.<ref>{{cite book | chapterurl = http://www.sgi-network.de/index.php?page=mission  | accessdate = | last = Empter  | first1 = Stefan  | first2 = Josef | last2 = Janning  | chapter=Sustainable Governance Indicators 2009 \u2013 An Introduction | editor-first  = Bertelsmann | editor-last = Stiftung | year = 2009| title = Policy Performance and Executive Capacity in the OECD | location = G\u00fctersloh | publisher = Verlag Bertelsmann Stiftung}}</ref> Section 10 of the [[Government Performance and Results Act]] (GPRA) Modernization Act requires U.S. federal agencies to publish their strategic and performance plans and reports in machine-readable format.\n\nThe International Budget Partnership (IBP) launched the Open Budget Initiative in 2006 with the release of the first Open Budget Survey (OBS). The OBS is a comprehensive analysis and survey that evaluates whether central governments give the public access to budget documents and provide opportunities for public participation in the budget process. To measure the overall commitment to transparency, the IBP created Open Budget Index (OBI), which assigns a score to each country based on the results of the survey. While the OBS is released biannually, the IBP recently released a new OBS Tracker, which serves as an online tool for civil society, the media, and other actors to monitor in real time whether governments are releasing eight key budget documents. The Open Budget Index data are used by the [[Open Government Partnership]], development aid agencies, and increasingly investors in the private sector as key indicators of governance, particularly fiscal transparency and management of public funds.<ref>Castro, Michael, 12 September 2013, [http://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/michael-castro/2013/09/12/open-budgets-key-open-government-next-steps-ogp-countries#sthash.cFZvst8q.dpuf Open Budgets Key to Open Government: Next Steps for OGP Countries] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221183910/http://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/michael-castro/2013/09/12/open-budgets-key-open-government-next-steps-ogp-countries#sthash.cFZvst8q.dpuf |date=2016-12-21 }}, retrieved 2 December 2014</ref> Examples of country-led assessments include the Indonesian Democracy Index, monitoring of the Millennium Development Goal 9 on Human Rights and Democratic Governance in Mongolia and the Gross National Happiness Index in Bhutan.\n\nSection 10 of the [[Government Performance and Results Act]] Modernization Act (GPRAMA) requires U.S. federal agencies to publish their performance plans and reports in machine-readable format, thereby providing the basis for evaluating the quality of their performance of the governance functions entrusted to them, as specified in their strategic objectives and performance indicators.  Publishing performance reports openly on the Web in a standard, machine-readable format is good practice for all organizations whose plans and reports should be matters of public record.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Agency cost]]\n*[[Anarchism]]\n*[[Collaborative governance]]\n*[[Corporate governance]]\n*[[Contract management]]\n*[[Data governance]]\n*[[Ecclesiastical polity]]\n*[[International healthcare accreditation]]\n*[[Internet governance]]\n*[[Global governance]]\n*[[Governmentality]]\n*[[Governance without government]]\n*[[Open-source governance]]\n*[[Participatory democracy]]\n*[[Policy Governance]]\n*[[Principal\u2013agent problem]]\n*[[Public choice theory]]\n*[[Public management]] and [[New public management]]\n*[[Rule According to Higher Law]]\n*[[Sarbanes-Oxley]]\n*[[Simulation Governance]]\n*[[Seat of local government]]\n*[[Social innovation]]\n*[[Sociocracy]]\n*[[SOA governance]]\n*[[Statism]]\n*[[Strategy Markup Language]] (StratML), particularly Part 2, Performance Plans and Reports\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [http://carre-strauss.com/documents/Smarter_Intervention_In_Complex_Systems.pdf \"Manifesto for Smarter Intervention in Complex Systems\"], by Mark Fell, Carr\u00e9 & Strauss. 2013.\n* [http://ssrn.com/abstract=343461 Becht, Marco, Patrick Bolton, Ailsa R\u00f6ell, \"Corporate Governance and Control\" (October 2002; updated August 2004).
