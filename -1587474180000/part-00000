Prior to the construction of the Lancaster Canal in 1792-1797, the Moorbrook flowed westward from what is now the A6 North Road, following a course that ran parallel to Aquaduct Street and Waters Lane, then through the northern edge  of an area known as Preston Marsh (located on northeast bank of the Ribble, around the junction of what is now Strand  Road and Waters Lane)  to enter the Ribble further west at Marsh End, just to the east of where Morrisons supermarket is now located on Mariners Way.  On the opposite (i.e. southern) bank of the Ribble was an area known as Penwortham Marsh which would flood during spring tides, increasing the size of this \"natural basin\", and it was here on the river's northern bank that Preston's original wharves were located. The reclamation work and the construction of retaining walls by the Ribble Navigation Company in the mid 1800s stabilised the river's banks and diminished the size of this basin, but by then the New Quays had been built. The diversion of the Ribble in the 1880s for the construction of the Albert Edward Basin and the reclamation of land along the river's north shore for the new docks resulted in the Moorbrook - or what little of it by then remained - no longer flowing into the Ribble.<ref>Information derived from various historic maps of Preston viewed at Harris Museum and Public Library, and from Lancashire County Council ''Maps and Related Information Online'' (MARIO). 26 February 2020.</ref>}} where the town's original docks were located.<ref name=VP/> However, by the last decade of the 18th century the town's wharf facilities were already struggling to keep up with demand, with the shallowness of the river limiting ships - particularly larger ones- to around the time of high tides, and by loading and unloading facilities and storage warehouses built on marshlands surrounding the river banks which were prone to flooding.<ref name=PD_PDF/>\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Map_of_Preston_1889.jpg|thumb|Map of Preston from 1889, showing the original course of the River Ribble along with the planned diversion to the south]]\n\nIn the early 1800s the Preston Consortium was founded which along with representation from the town council (which retained 30% ownership of the corporation) included some of Preston's largest private companies, to propose ways in which the river could be better used to facilitate trade. This led to the creation of first Ribble Navigation Company in 1806, whose primary purpose was to commence a program of land reclamation and fixing the course of the river within training walls built along its banks. Construction of a new wharf commenced a few years later further downstream along the section of the river where Marsh Lane joined Strand Road.

The second Ribble Navigation Company was created in 1838 and lasted until 1853, followed by the third company in 1853 which lasted until 1883. Both of these companies continued the work of the first, dredging and fixing the course of the river and by 1880 around {{convert|445|hectare}} of land along the surrounding banks had been reclaimed.<ref name=ET/> The third company was bestowed with more power for land reclamation not only for the docks but also to benefit Preston overall, and created around {{convert|4,000|acre|order=flip}} of new farmland from the former tidal stretches and mudflats.\n\nHowever, ever with the new deeper navigation channel there was still an ongoing issue of the river's shallowness which not only limited vessels' journeys but also restricted the mooring of increasingly larger vessels to the new Victoria Quays (which was by 1860 had only been in operation for 35 years) and in 1861 the Preston discussed a proposal to locate the docks away from the river in deep-water basin with a constant level maintained by a series of locks. Nothing came to be from this proposal until 1882 when the corporation voted to adopt this as their strategy for their town's future port. In 1883, Parliament passed the Preston Dock Act to allow construction of the new docks.<ref name=ET/> In 1884 construction began with the diversion of the River Ribble and the excavation of the new basin, with the first sod being turned on 11 October 1884.<ref name=PD_PDF/> On 17 July 1885 the dock's foundation stone was laid by Queen Victoria's eldest son, Albert Edward the Prince of Wales after whom the basin is named.<ref name=BP/>\n\nThe dock was officially opened on 25 June 1892 by Alfred, the Prince of Edinburgh, Queen Victoria's second eldest son, and the new Port of Preston commenced operations.<ref name=BP/> The first ship to enter the lock and use the new docks was the steam yacht ''Aline'', carrying the royal party for the opening ceremony. There are contrary records as to what was the commercial vessel to use the new docks, with some saying it was SS ''Lady Louise'', chartered by the Lancashire firm EH Booth and Co Ltd (still operating today as the upmarket supermarket chain [[Booths]]), and which carried an inbound load of cargo, while others say it was the ''Hebe'', which unloaded a cargo of cement. However, was is not disputed is the fanfare that accompanied the opening of the docks, with over 10,000 members of the public in attendance and a \"flotilla\" of small boats and pleasure craft on the Ribble.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Preston Riversway Docks.jpg|thumb|Looking eastward up the Ribble, with the entrance to the docks on the left]]\n\nFrom its slow beginnings the docks experience a steady growth in trade in the early decades of the 20th century. With the outbreak of the First World War the docks took on a new role, exporting munitions produced by local factories that had been retooled for the war effort. After the cessation of hostilities the docks experienced a downturn in trade from which it never fully recovered in the inter-war period. In the 1920s the rail line from the site of the old Victory Quay was extended along both side of the docks, allowing an increase in the volume of goods transiting to and from the port.\n\nDuring the Second World War the docks again aided Britain's war effort, when it was taken over by the military and used as a marshalling post for the [[D-Day]] [[Invastion of Normandy|landings]] in [[Normandy]], 1944. During the course of the war the docks had to be closed twice due to [[naval mine]]s.<ref name=LP/> In the years after the Second World War, the volume of goods passing in and out of the port increased, aided by a ferry service to Northern Ireland commencing in 1948. Traffic increased even further until a peak in the 1960s, but warning signs for its future were beginning to appear. Ferry services ceased by the early 1970s, and although containerised cargo meant ships could be loaded and unloaded more quickly, economies of scale meant container vessels increased in size, and the age-old problem of the shallowness of the Ribble took greater significance; constant dredging operations were now costing around half of the port's annual income.\n\nThe period 1960\u20131972 was the busiest in the dock's history but from then it experienced a continued and noticeable fall in revenue brought about from a reduction in trade and the cost of dredging required to keep the port open, and in 1981 an Act of Parliament was passed to close the docks. On 22 October 1981 the last Preston-based ship, the dredger ''Hoveringham V'' left the docks and on 31 October, the port's last official day of operation, the Singapore-based MV ''Sea Rhine'' became the final vessel to leave the docks, thus signalling the closure of the Port of Preston.\n\n===Post-redevelopment===\nFollowing redevelopment of the former Preston Dock, greater emphasis has been placed upon the role that Riversway and the Albert Edward Basin play in the community's leisure and lifestyle, and the area has hosted several significant events:\n* During the 2012 Preston Guild celebrations, held every 20 years and unique within Great Britain, Riversway played an important role, especially with the year's Riversway Festival when more than 60 guest boats entered the basin. The Royal Navy [[Patrol vessel|patrol boat]] {{HMS|Charger|P292|6}}, a semi-regular visitor to the city, was formally adopted by Preston, allowing the vessel and its crew to \"officially\" participate in the celebrations.<ref>{{cite web |URL=https://www.blogpreston.co.uk/2014/07/prestons-adopted-navy-ship-hms-charger-at-the-docks/ |title=Preston\u2019s adopted navy ship HMS Charger at the Docks |publisher=Blog Preston |author=Ed Walker |date=12 July 2014 |access-date=28 February 2020}}</ref>\n* The Riversway Festival (formerly the Preston Maritime Festival) was an annual summer event first held in the 1992 Preston Guild to celebrate the city's maritime heritage.

Following the 2012 festival the council cancelled funding for the event due to budget cuts and the 2013 festival, which only went ahead due to the efforts of volunteers, was the last occurrence of this event.

The water in the basin is maintained to a level within a {{convert|2|m|adj=on}} range, originally by staff of the Preston Corporation, and now by the Preston City Council, who operate the lock gates (and since 1985, the swing bridge) to permit the passage of craft to and from the river. When the basin's water levels drop, they are topped up by water from the Ribble on spring tides.<ref name=PD_PDF/> The size of vessels that can enter the basin are constrained by the length of the boat lock and the width of the lock gates.\n\nThe cost of building the basin and operating the docks (including on-going dredging of the river) proved a financial burden, and in its 90-year history the port only reported a profit on 17 years.<ref name=ET/>\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:Plan_of_River_Ribble_Diversion_1882.jpg|thumb|Plan of the Albert Edward Basin and Preston Dock, 1882]]\n[[File:Construction of Albert Edward Basin 1890.jpg|thumb|Excavation of the Albert Edward Basin, 1890]]\n\nThe need for a new dock immune from the Ribble's tides was first proposed by the Preston Corporation in 1861. In 1882 the corporation officially adopted the proposal for construction of a new dock basin separate from the river by a system of locks to regulate the water level.This began a lengthy period of planning and negotiations, with approval first being required from Westminster to give the corporation the powers to raise the necessary funds, estimated at half a million pounds. In 1883 the ''Ribble Navigation and Preston Dock Act'' was passed by parliament which allowed the corporation to divert the river and create a new basin, based on the plans drawn up by the engineer Edward Garlick. The Act also allowed the corporation to acquire the Dock Navigation Company and the Preston Dock Branch Line railway from the North Union Railway company in order to develop Preston as a major port.<ref name=ET/><ref name=PD_PDF/><ref name=RSRM>{{cite web |URL=https://ribblesteam.org.uk/news/ribble-steam-railway-and-preston-docks/ |title=Ribble Steam Railway and Preston Docks |publisher=Ribble Steam Railway and Museum |access-date=24 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nConstruction began in 1884 and there was an enormous amount of work that had to be done. The river, which ran parallel to Strand Road and followed a course further north than its current location, was diverted so that the new dock basin could be created. A new channel was cut to the south, with a sharp bend taking the river westward from about opposite the old Victory Quay at Marsh lane, through the area known as Penwortham Marsh. The old section of river was dammed at both ends and the water pumped out. Excavation began on the site of the new shipping and tidal basins, with around {{convert|5000000|m3|spell=in}} of earth, sand and rock removed, which was used to fill the old river bed to create the dock's northern quays. The new shipping basin was {{convert|40|ft|m|order=flip}} deep, {{convert|3000|ft|m|order=flip}} long and {{convert|600|ft|m|order=flip}} wide, with concrete walls and granite copings. Construction required the demolition of the old docks and a temporary wharf, \"Diversion Quay\", was built at the east end of the new river channel to allow trade to continue.<ref name=PD_PDF/>\n\nThe scope of he endeavour meant that the initial estimate of half a million pounds was soon exceeded and the corporation needed further funding of another equivalent amount to complete the project. Construction was delayed while approval was again sought from Westminster to raise the additional funds. This resulted in a long mortgage being taken out that would not be paid off by Preston's rate payers for over 60 years. Construction was also drawn out by several owners of Preston's textile mills, who, fearing the industries the new dock would attract would drive up the cost of labour, opposed the venture. They formed a political party, \u201cThe Party of Caution\u201d, and contested local elections with the aim of stopping public money being spent building the dock.<ref name=LP/><ref name=BP/>\n\nOn 21 May 1892 the concrete walls of a temporary dam built to hold back the Ribble were breached, allowing the basin to begin filling with water, and the new Port of Preston began operating a month later, with the official opening ceremony held on 25 June 1892. Initial facilities were at first limited, but the docklands railway was soon extended and new warehouses and cargo handling facilities were constructed as the volume of trade through the dock increased.<ref name=PD_PDF/>\n\n===Operation===\n[[File:Ships moored at Preston Dock c1930.jpg|thumb|400px|Ships moored at Albert Edward Dock, c.1930]]\n[[File:The Street railway journal (1899) (14759108972).jpg|thumb|400px|Engineering works to the east of Albert Edward Basin (along Strand Road), 1899. Railway tracks of the Preston Dock Branch Line can be seen in the foreground.]]\n\nThe new dock was not an immediate success, used by just four vessels in its first year of operation; however, by 1900 this number had grown to 170 and the future appeared rosy. The creation of the Preston Dock Branch Line railway in the 1840s, and later extensions in the 1890s and 1920s, allowed goods to be transported directly to and from ships, minimising loading and unloading times and providing the Port of Preston with a competitive advantage over other nearby ports.<ref name=LP/>\n\nOver the course of its history the dock handled a wide variety of general cargoes. Incoming vessels would unload raw cotton, timber, china\nclay, fruit (including bananas and citrus from the West Indies), wheat, horses, cattle, coal, petroleum products, fishmeal, fertilisers, and wood pulp and [[esparto grass]] for paper making. Out-going vessels were mostly loaded with cotton products and other textiles from Preston's mills, and later manufactured goods from the town's growing industries. Pre-World War I saw a rise in popularity in excursion steamers operating from the docks providing day trips to nearby destinations, and post-World War II saw the introduction of passenger and vehicular ferry services to Northern Ireland. During both world wars the docks were used by the military for general wartime cargo and strategic operations, including the D-Day landings in 1944.\n\nThe dock's quayside facilities were developed to match the rising trade, originally handling bulk cargo but later upgraded to containerised service, the first dock in the UK to provide such a facility. Trade increased throughout the 1950s so much so that the charge for the port that had been levied on Preston residents\u2019 rates bills since the opening of the dock was finally cancelled. Large quantities of fruit were being imported from the [[British Windward Islands|Winward]] and [[Leeward Islands]]; in one year the entire citrus crop from [[Dominica]] and [[Saint Lucia]] came through the port.<ref name=LP/>\n\nThe period 1960\u20131972 was the busiest in the dock's history, and peak volume was reached in 1968 when 2.5 million tons of trade passed through the port.<ref name=PD_PDF/> However, the [[UK dockers' strike (1970)|Dockers Strikes]] of 1969 and 1970 severely disrupted the port's ferry services and deterred much of its foreign traffic and resulted in a noticeable fall in revenue, a trend that was not to be reversed.<ref name=PD_PDF/> The docks continued to experience a steady decrease in trade, including the abandonment of ferry services, and in 1975 the first serious financial trouble began after an operating loss of \u00a31.5m, the largest in the port's history, was reported.<ref name=LEP>{{cite web |URL=https://www.lep.co.uk/news/how-time-was-called-preston-docks-765403 |title=How time was called on Preston Docks |publisher=Lancashire Evening post |author=Imogen Cooper |date=2 November 2016 |access-date=22 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nConstant dredging of the Ribble proved a huge burden upon the port's revenue; in 1975 45% of the dock's income was spent on dredging operations.<ref name=PD_PDF/> A report to the then Preston Borough Council in September 1979 advised that there was no future prospect for operating the port at a profit and it was resolved that the docks should be closed and the area redeveloped.\n\n===Closure===\nFollowing a boom period in the 1960s Preston Dock suffered a series of financial setbacks in the early 1970s, which led to a record loss of \u00a31.5 million in 1975, and each subsequent year of the decade recorded losses of between \u00a3800,000 and \u00a31 million.<ref name=PD_PDF/>\n\nAs early as 1975 reports were produced looking into what could be done to stem the losses. However, the rising cost of operations and the decreasing revenues from diminishing trade{{efn|The number of ships visiting the port in 1975 was recorded at 675 but fell to 538 just one year later.<ref name=LEP/>}}  led to the then Preston Borough Council deciding to close the port, and a phased closure was announced in 1976, which would result in the redundancy of 450 workers. However, a campaign to keep the port open, led by the public, newspapers, dockside workers, trade unions and local industry, gave the port a reprieve and the council applied for and received a grant of \u00a32 million from Westminster for a two-year trial to revive the port's ailing fortunes. The council had still found no feasible solutions to the dock's inherent problems 18 months later, including a suggestion to redevelop the docks into a multi-functional estate creating an additional 1,500 jobs, which was rejected by the unions and local Labour councillors. With no further government funding available and facing the prospect of subsidising the dock at a cost of around a million pounds a year - a cost that Preston could not afford in a time of national economic downturn - in October 1979 the final decision was made to close the port in two years time.<ref name=LEP/><ref name=CPW1>{{cite web |URL=https://ribblesteam.wordpress.com/2016/08/12/why-did-preston-port-close/ |title=Why did Preston port close? |publisher=Chuffs, Puffs & Whistles |author=Ribble Steam Railway |date=12 August 2016 |access-date=28 February 2020}}</ref>\n \nClosing the dock was not a straightforward procedure; a Private Members' Bill and an Act of Parliament would be required which would take about six months to prepare. Nor would it be cheap; it would require paying off outstanding debts and loans, and the payment of compensation including redundancy pay. The total cost was estimated at \u00a33.5 million over 10 years, which would be recovered through the sale of the dock's assets and a levy imposed upon Preston's ratepayers.

However, their study identified a number of major constraints including polluted water and contaminated land, inadequacy of flood defences, and lack of infrastructure which would result in high costs of clearance and reclamation. The study also identified that for any redevelopment to be successful, a partnership between the council and private enterprise, would be necessary, and that funding was available from Westminster in accordance with the ''Derelict Land Grants'' scheme.<ref name=PD_PDF/>\n\nThe proposed name for the redeveloped site would be \"Riversway\", as it was to be mostly built on land that was the original course of the river, and the council began inviting bids from national and local consortia to produce detailed proposals for the redevelopment. Due to the size of the project and the associated constraints, the process was protracted and it was not until 1985 that a plan was finally chosen, submitted by Holder Mathias (Architects) of London and the [[Balfour Beatty]] corporation. The plan proposed that the former norther quayside would be redeveloped for retail use, the southern quayside for residential use, and the basin would feature a public marina. The area to the west of Riversway, tentatively referred to as \"Riversway West\", would be reserved for future commercial and light industrial use. The plan's general strategy was that the clearance, reclamation and infrastructure works would commence immediately to attract investment from the private sector to redevelop individual site. A condition of the proposal was that Balfour Beatty retained the development rights on the prime waterfront area north and east of the dock basin, in return for funding the road infrastructure project.<ref name=PD_PDF/>\n\nThe plan identified that the existing docklands railway along the north side of the basin occupied valuable development sites, and the railway would be diverted along the banks of the Ribble behind the dock's southern quay. This necessitated the construction of a {{convert|1,000|t|adj=on}} swing bridge across the entrance to the lock which, to save money, had the railway tracks running down the centre of the roadway. Construction of the new infrastructure began in 1985 and generally proceeded from east to west, and continued until 1992.<ref name=PD_PDF/> New roads were constructed, including:\n* 'Mariners Way', running parallel to Waters Lane along the basin's northern quayside, following the original course of the Ribble.\n* 'Navigation Way', running parallel between the northern bank of the Ribble and the basin's southern quayside, across the new swing bridge on the western side of the basin and joining Mariners Way.\n* 'Port Way', running east from Strand Road along the north bank of the Ribble (from about opposite the site of the 1820s port) and turning north along the eastern end of the basin to join Waters Lane, and providing access into Mariner's Way.\n* 'Pedders Way', running from Waters Lane down to the western end of the basin, providing access to Mariners Way and Navigation Way, as well as to the existing industrial estate in Chain Caul Way.\n* 'Channel Way', a smaller road running west from the A59 near Strand Road to provide east-bound traffic access to Riversway, it runs to the northern end of Port Way (also following the original course of the Ribble) to Strand Road, as well as providing access to a potential new business park to the east of Riversway.\n \nOnly four of the dock's original buildings{{efn|Some websites state that the lighthouse located in front of the Morrisons supermarket is an original from the Preston Docks; however, this is a replica constructed in 1986.<ref name=LH>{{cite web |URL=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/5961548 |title=SD5192: Lighthouse at Albert Edward Dock |publisher=Geograph UK |author=Thomas Nugent |date=19 October 2018 |access-date=22 February 2020}}</ref>}} were retained:<ref name=PD_PDF/>\n* Shed No.3 on the south side of the basin, redeveloped for residential use as \u201cVictoria Mansions\u201d\n* Customs House on Dock Road \n* the office of Transport Ferry Service off Pedders Way (subsequently demolished for new development)\n* the original Pump House building adjacent to the tidal basin (subsequently demolished for new development)\n\nFollowing the opening of Riversway in July 1987,<ref>{{cite book |title=Preston in 50 Buildings |author=Keith Johnson |date=2016 |publisher=Amberley Publishing |publication-place=Gloucestershire, UK |ISBN=9781445658971}}</ref> over 2,000 jobs have been created from the opening of new and the relocation of exiting businesses.

Blue-green algae is discolouring the water]]\n\nSince the dock's closure as a working port, the waters of the basin have suffered from frequent blooms of [[Cyanobacteria|blue-green algae]] (cyanobacteria), which can be toxic to humans and animals. Despite repeated attempts to cure the problem and improve water quality, outbreaks still occur and are most prevalent in the warmer months, and signs are posted around the basin by the [[Preston City Council]] warning against swimming (including pets).<ref>{{cite web |title=Visitor Information Albert Edward Basin |publisher=Preston City Council |url=http://www.preston.gov.uk/leisure-and-culture/riversway/visiting-riversway/blue-green-algal-blooms/ |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |URL=https://www.lep.co.uk/best-in/outdoors/locals-launch-bid-clean-water-preston-dock-924894 |title=Locals launch bid to clean up water in Preston Dock |publisher=Lancashire Evening Post |author=Brian Ellis |date=23 October 2019 |access-date=28 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Industrial waste====\nRedevelopment of the former docks saw the removal of land contaminated by industrial use. It was deemed that the most cost-effective solution was to create a purpose-made disposal area, licensed by the city's [[Waste disposal authority|Waste Disposal Authority]], on the river bank west of the main development. The contaminated soils were sealed in clay-lined containment cells and covered over, and the details recorded on a contaminated land register held by the council.<ref name=PD_PDF/>\n\nIn 2002\u201303 the council undertook an extensive investigation into soil and groundwater conditions at the site, and the basin and the river were sampled for any leakage from the containment cells. It was reported that no further remedial work was required to protect the Albert Edward Dock or the River Ribble due to low chemical concentrations. Furthermore, a cost-benefit analysis on the recovery of remaining hydrocarbons would have proved prohibitively expensive with little benefit to the environmental quality of the river. Therefore, in light of the findings and agreement with the [[Environment Agency]] this investigation was concluded.<ref>{{cite web |URL=https://www.preston.gov.uk/media/209/Contaminated-Land-Strategy-2012/pdf/Contaminated-Land-Strategy-2012.pdf?m=636906835179970000 |title=Contaminated Land Strategy 2012 |publisher=Preston City Council |date=March 2012 |access-date=28 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Historic facilities ==\n===Boat lock===\nLocated at the western end of the Albert Edward Basin is the ''Bull Nose'', a series of [[Lock (water navigation)|lock gates]] to maintain a constant water level within the basin and to provide ingress and egress for vessels to and from the River Ribble. The lock gates allow vessels up to {{convert|60|feet|metres}} in width to enter the basin. The gates are the original items installed when the docks were constructed in the 1880\u20131890s, and are made of Greenheart main timbers and Iroko planking. Each gate weighs 98 tons.<ref name=BP/>\n\nThe first single pair of gates separates the tidal basin from the River Ribble, to maintain a minimum operating depth in the tidal basin so that during low tide when the level of water in the river is too low to allow vessels to journey to the sea, they can remain in the tidal basin and not take up valuable berthing space along the docks. The main lock is two pairs of gates located on each end of a short canal, separating the tidal basin from the main shipping basin. When vessels enter the lock from the tidal basin, if the water level is lower than the level of the main basin, water is pumped in and once the inner gates are open the vessel can continue to the docks. When vessels enter the lock from the main basin, if the water level is higher than the level of the tidal basin, water is pumped out and once the outer gates are open the vessel can continue into the tidal basin. The lock limits vessels over approximately {{convert|200|metres|ft}} from entering the main basin.\n\nFollowing the closure of Preston Dock flood mitigation work commenced between 1982 and 1985 to stop flooding during severe storms and exceptionally high tides;{{efn|In 1977 a combination of high river levels and strong westerly winds blowing a high tide in to the Ribble estuary resulted in the flooding of large areas of the docklands.<ref name=PD_PDF/>}} the gates from the river to the tidal basin were repositioned and raised to a higher level so as to also act as storm gates, and flood banks were built along the river edge to a level of {{convert|8|metres|ft}} [[Ordnance datum|above ordnance datum]] (AOD). During these works, all gates were refurbished, for which a large {{convert|100|tonne|adj=on}} crane was constructed along the southern quayside near the lock, and in 1985 a new control tower building (which also controls the swing bridge) was opened, with operations overseen by the Preston City Council.<ref name=PD_PDF/>\n\nThe boat lock remains in operation to this day and provides access to the Preston Marina, which was built following redevelopment of the docks. The gates can open up to one hour before [[High water|High Water]] ([[Liverpool]]) and remain open up to  two hours after this time. Different opening timetables operate over summer and winter. Vessels arriving outside these hours can remain in the lay-by berth within the lock chamber, and await the next gate opening. The lock does not provide 24 hour operations; the control tower can be contacted on [[Marine VHF radio|VHF]] Channel 16.<ref>{{cite web |URL=http://prestonmarina.co.uk/index.php/lock-gates/ |title=Lock gate operating times |publisher=Preston marina |access-date=22 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Docklands Railway===\n[[File:Bagnall 0-6-0ST prob. no. 2682 (1942) Preston Docks 08.1968 (2) (9859843804).jpg|thumb|Steam locomotive on Preston Dock, 1968]]\n[[File:RSR Preston Docks Swing Bridge 20150913.jpg|thumb|A preserved steam locomotive of the [[Ribble Steam Railway]] crossing the Preston Docks swing bridge]]\n\nIn 1845 a railway line was built linking the old docks at Victoria Quay to Preston's main railway station{{efn|Although only a little over a half mile in length, the docklands branch line posed some problems in its construction and operation. A steep-sided cutting and tunnel had to be dug under Fishergate and West Cliff Terrace and the new line was a rather sharp curve, which limited the wheelbase of the locomotives and wagons that could be used. The line was also quite steep, with a 1:29 gradient. This limited the weight of the trains, as they needed to be held under brakes down the hill, and locomotives required sufficient power to haul the trains up the hill (and the more powerful locomotives were usually the biggest, often too long for the sharply curving track). This was an on-going problem which limited freight operations until the 1990s, when a more modern class of locomotive was finally introduced.<ref name=CPW2>{{cite web |URL=https://ribblesteam.wordpress.com/2016/11/03/bitumen-trains-the-story-so-far/ |title=Bitumen Trains \u2013 The Story So Far |publisher=Chuffs, Puffs and Whistles |author=Ribble Steam Railway|date=3 November 2016 |access-date=24 February 2020}}</ref>}} Unlike many docks which utilise [[Narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] tracks, Preston's dockland railway utilised [[Standard-gauge railway|standard gauge track]], allowing freight to be routed directly to and from the [[Main line (railway)|main line]] without having to be transferred to different [[rolling stock]]. The line, officially known as the Preston Dock Branch Line, was originally operated by the [[North Union Railway]] until 1889, when ownership and operation transferred to the Preston Corporation. The corporation operated eight small [[tank locomotive]]s which remained in service until 1968 when they were replaced by [[Sentinel Waggon Works|Sentinel]] [[Switcher|diesel shunters]], which remain in operation today with Ribble Rail, a subsidiary of the Ribble Steam railway, working bitumen trains. At the dock's peak the railway comprised around {{convert|27|mi|order=flip}} of track, with multiple tracks and sidings running on both the north and south sides of the Albert Edward Basin. A marshalling yard, engine sheds and workshops were built at the western end of the docks on the northern shore of the Ribble, which is now the site of museum and workshops of the [[Ribble Steam Railway]] (RSR).<ref name=RSRM/>\n\nThe railway remained in operation after the docks' closure, with up to nine trains per week continuing to deliver petrol to the [[Petrofina]] petroleum storage tanks on Chain Caul Way (now part of the Anchorage Business park) until the company ceased operations at this site in 1992 and the facility was demolished. This left just one company, the Lancashire Tar Distillers (also located in what is now the Anchorage Business Park), still operating rail services, with three weekly freight trains delivering crude bitumen from the from the [[Lindsey Oil Refinery]] in [[Lincolnshire]] to the distilling plant, and empty trains returning to the Lincolnshire refinery from the Preston Docks.{{efn|The trains travel overnight from the refinery to Preston via [[Hebden Bridge]] in heated tankers which maintain the crude bitumen to between {{convert|160|-|180|C}} to stop it from hardening.  Prior to 1995 (when road transport was temporarily utilised) each train would normally comprise seven and occasionally up ten tankers, each with a loaded weight of {{convert|102|t}}, for a total haulage of around {{convert|700|-|1,000|t}} per train.  In 2004 when rail operations resumed the new 10-year contract upgraded the required amount of bitumen to {{convert|110,000|t}} per annum; as a result the number of tankers increased to ten or twelve, for a total haulage of {{convert|1,000|-|1,200|t}} per train. In 2010 a new design of tanker was introduced with an increased load capacity of {{convert|74|t}} and able to hold the crude bitumen at a more constant temperature. A more powerful locomotive was brought into service, with each train now comprising fourteen or fifteen tankers for a total haulage of {{convert|1,400|-|1,500|t}}. The tankers are hauled by a main line locomotive to a siding off Port Way, where they are collected by a historic Sentinel diesel shunter (which previously operated on the docklands railways in the 1960s) and delivered to the processing plant on Chain Caul Way.<ref name=CPW2/>}}  However, in 1995 the company switched to road transportation and the trains stopped until 2004, when the plant was sold to [[Total S.A.|Total UK]] and rail operations recommenced.<ref name=PD_PDF/><ref name=CPW2/><ref name=RSRM/>\n\nThe redevelopment of the docks in the 1980s led to removal of much of the rail lines, but in 1985 a single line was built across the new Preston Docks swing bridge which ran along the north bank of the Ribble and rejoined the existing line near the [[level crossing]] on Strand Road. This section of the line is utilised by the RSR which operates regular trips on preserved rolling stock on weekends from April through to September, and special trains during the winter holiday season.<ref>{{cite web |URL=https://ribblesteam.org.uk/standard-operating-days/ |title=Operating Days |publisher=Ribble Steam Railway and Museum |access-date=24 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Ferry services===\nIn 1948 the Atlantic Steam Navigation company established a passenger and vehicular ferry service operating from the Preston Docks to [[Larne]] in [[County Antrim]], [[Northern Ireland]].

Prior to the construction of the Lancaster Canal in 1792-1797, the Moorbrook flowed westward from what is now the A6 North Road, following a course that ran parallel to Aquaduct Street and Waters Lane, then through the northern edge  of an area known as Preston Marsh (located on northeast bank of the Ribble, around the junction of what is now Strand  Road and Waters Lane)  to enter the Ribble further west at Marsh End, just to the east of where Morrisons supermarket is now located on Mariners Way.  On the opposite (i.e. southern) bank of the Ribble was an area known as Penwortham Marsh which would flood during spring tides, increasing the size of this \"natural basin\", and it was here on the river's northern bank that Preston's original wharves were located. The reclamation work and the construction of retaining walls by the Ribble Navigation Company in the mid 1800s stabilised the river's banks and diminished the size of this basin, but by then the New Quays had been built.

Nothing came to be from this proposal until 1882 when the corporation voted to adopt this as their strategy for their town's future port. In 1883, Parliament passed the Preston Dock Act to allow construction of the new docks.<ref name=ET/> In 1884 construction began with the diversion of the River Ribble and the excavation of the new basin, with the first sod being turned on 11 October 1884.<ref name=PD_PDF/> On 17 July 1885 the dock's foundation stone was laid by Queen Victoria's eldest son, Albert Edward the Prince of Wales after whom the basin is named.<ref name=BP/>\n\nThe dock was officially opened on 25 June 1892 by Alfred, the Prince of Edinburgh, Queen Victoria's second eldest son, and the new Port of Preston commenced operations.<ref name=BP/> The first ship to enter the lock and use the new docks was the steam yacht ''Aline'', carrying the royal party for the opening ceremony. There are contrary records as to what was the commercial vessel to use the new docks, with some saying it was SS ''Lady Louise'', chartered by the Lancashire firm EH Booth and Co Ltd (still operating today as the upmarket supermarket chain [[Booths]]), and which carried an inbound load of cargo, while others say it was the ''Hebe'', which unloaded a cargo of cement. However, was is not disputed is the fanfare that accompanied the opening of the docks, with over 10,000 members of the public in attendance and a \"flotilla\" of small boats and pleasure craft on the Ribble.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Preston Riversway Docks.jpg|thumb|Looking eastward up the Ribble, with the entrance to the docks on the left]]\n\nFrom its slow beginnings the docks experience a steady growth in trade in the early decades of the 20th century. With the outbreak of the First World War the docks took on a new role, exporting munitions produced by local factories that had been retooled for the war effort. After the cessation of hostilities the docks experienced a downturn in trade from which it never fully recovered in the inter-war period. In the 1920s the rail line from the site of the old Victory Quay was extended along both side of the docks, allowing an increase in the volume of goods transiting to and from the port.\n\nDuring the Second World War the docks again aided Britain's war effort, when it was taken over by the military and used as a marshalling post for the [[D-Day]] [[Invastion of Normandy|landings]] in [[Normandy]], 1944. During the course of the war the docks had to be closed twice due to [[naval mine]]s.<ref name=LP/> In the years after the Second World War, the volume of goods passing in and out of the port increased, aided by a ferry service to Northern Ireland commencing in 1948. Traffic increased even further until a peak in the 1960s, but warning signs for its future were beginning to appear. Ferry services ceased by the early 1970s, and although containerised cargo meant ships could be loaded and unloaded more quickly, economies of scale meant container vessels increased in size, and the age-old problem of the shallowness of the Ribble took greater significance; constant dredging operations were now costing around half of the port's annual income.\n\nThe period 1960\u20131972 was the busiest in the dock's history but from then it experienced a continued and noticeable fall in revenue brought about from a reduction in trade and the cost of dredging required to keep the port open, and in 1981 an Act of Parliament was passed to close the docks. On 22 October 1981 the last Preston-based ship, the dredger ''Hoveringham V'' left the docks and on 31 October, the port's last official day of operation, the Singapore-based MV ''Sea Rhine'' became the final vessel to leave the docks, thus signalling the closure of the Port of Preston.\n\n===Post-redevelopment===\nFollowing redevelopment of the former Preston Dock, greater emphasis has been placed upon the role that Riversway and the Albert Edward Basin play in the community's leisure and lifestyle, and the area has hosted several significant events:\n* During the 2012 Preston Guild celebrations, held every 20 years and unique within Great Britain, Riversway played an important role, especially with the year's Riversway Festival when more than 60 guest boats entered the basin. The Royal Navy [[Patrol vessel|patrol boat]] {{HMS|Charger|P292|6}}, a semi-regular visitor to the city, was formally adopted by Preston, allowing the vessel and its crew to \"officially\" participate in the celebrations.<ref>{{cite web |URL=https://www.blogpreston.co.uk/2014/07/prestons-adopted-navy-ship-hms-charger-at-the-docks/ |title=Preston\u2019s adopted navy ship HMS Charger at the Docks |publisher=Blog Preston |author=Ed Walker |date=12 July 2014 |access-date=28 February 2020}}</ref>\n* The Riversway Festival (formerly the Preston Maritime Festival) was an annual summer event first held in the 1992 Preston Guild to celebrate the city's maritime heritage. Various activities are held on the basin, including a dragon boat regatta, a dinghy \"grand prix\", displays by the [[Sea Cadets (United Kingdom)|Sea Cadets]] and brightly decorated guest vessels including [[narrowboat]]s from the [[Lancaster Canal]]. Following the 2012 festival the council cancelled funding for the event due to budget cuts and the 2013 festival, which only went ahead due to the efforts of volunteers, was the last occurrence of this event.

In 1882 the corporation officially adopted the proposal for construction of a new dock basin separate from the river by a system of locks to regulate the water level.This began a lengthy period of planning and negotiations, with approval first being required from Westminster to give the corporation the powers to raise the necessary funds, estimated at half a million pounds. In 1883 the ''Ribble Navigation and Preston Dock Act'' was passed by parliament which allowed the corporation to divert the river and create a new basin, based on the plans drawn up by the engineer Edward Garlick. The Act also allowed the corporation to acquire the Dock Navigation Company and the Preston Dock Branch Line railway from the North Union Railway company in order to develop Preston as a major port.<ref name=ET/><ref name=PD_PDF/><ref name=RSRM>{{cite web |URL=https://ribblesteam.org.uk/news/ribble-steam-railway-and-preston-docks/ |title=Ribble Steam Railway and Preston Docks |publisher=Ribble Steam Railway and Museum |access-date=24 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nConstruction began in 1884 and there was an enormous amount of work that had to be done. The river, which ran parallel to Strand Road and followed a course further north than its current location, was diverted so that the new dock basin could be created. A new channel was cut to the south, with a sharp bend taking the river westward from about opposite the old Victory Quay at Marsh lane, through the area known as Penwortham Marsh. The old section of river was dammed at both ends and the water pumped out. Excavation began on the site of the new shipping and tidal basins, with around {{convert|5000000|m3|spell=in}} of earth, sand and rock removed, which was used to fill the old river bed to create the dock's northern quays. The new shipping basin was {{convert|40|ft|m|order=flip}} deep, {{convert|3000|ft|m|order=flip}} long and {{convert|600|ft|m|order=flip}} wide, with concrete walls and granite copings. Construction required the demolition of the old docks and a temporary wharf, \"Diversion Quay\", was built at the east end of the new river channel to allow trade to continue.<ref name=PD_PDF/>\n\nThe scope of he endeavour meant that the initial estimate of half a million pounds was soon exceeded and the corporation needed further funding of another equivalent amount to complete the project. Construction was delayed while approval was again sought from Westminster to raise the additional funds. This resulted in a long mortgage being taken out that would not be paid off by Preston's rate payers for over 60 years. Construction was also drawn out by several owners of Preston's textile mills, who, fearing the industries the new dock would attract would drive up the cost of labour, opposed the venture. They formed a political party, \u201cThe Party of Caution\u201d, and contested local elections with the aim of stopping public money being spent building the dock.<ref name=LP/><ref name=BP/>\n\nOn 21 May 1892 the concrete walls of a temporary dam built to hold back the Ribble were breached, allowing the basin to begin filling with water, and the new Port of Preston began operating a month later, with the official opening ceremony held on 25 June 1892. Initial facilities were at first limited, but the docklands railway was soon extended and new warehouses and cargo handling facilities were constructed as the volume of trade through the dock increased.<ref name=PD_PDF/>\n\n===Operation===\n[[File:Ships moored at Preston Dock c1930.jpg|thumb|400px|Ships moored at Albert Edward Dock, c.1930]]\n[[File:The Street railway journal (1899) (14759108972).jpg|thumb|400px|Engineering works to the east of Albert Edward Basin (along Strand Road), 1899. Railway tracks of the Preston Dock Branch Line can be seen in the foreground.]]\n\nThe new dock was not an immediate success, used by just four vessels in its first year of operation; however, by 1900 this number had grown to 170 and the future appeared rosy. The creation of the Preston Dock Branch Line railway in the 1840s, and later extensions in the 1890s and 1920s, allowed goods to be transported directly to and from ships, minimising loading and unloading times and providing the Port of Preston with a competitive advantage over other nearby ports.<ref name=LP/>\n\nOver the course of its history the dock handled a wide variety of general cargoes. Incoming vessels would unload raw cotton, timber, china\nclay, fruit (including bananas and citrus from the West Indies), wheat, horses, cattle, coal, petroleum products, fishmeal, fertilisers, and wood pulp and [[esparto grass]] for paper making. Out-going vessels were mostly loaded with cotton products and other textiles from Preston's mills, and later manufactured goods from the town's growing industries. Pre-World War I saw a rise in popularity in excursion steamers operating from the docks providing day trips to nearby destinations, and post-World War II saw the introduction of passenger and vehicular ferry services to Northern Ireland. During both world wars the docks were used by the military for general wartime cargo and strategic operations, including the D-Day landings in 1944.\n\nThe dock's quayside facilities were developed to match the rising trade, originally handling bulk cargo but later upgraded to containerised service, the first dock in the UK to provide such a facility. Trade increased throughout the 1950s so much so that the charge for the port that had been levied on Preston residents\u2019 rates bills since the opening of the dock was finally cancelled. Large quantities of fruit were being imported from the [[British Windward Islands|Winward]] and [[Leeward Islands]]; in one year the entire citrus crop from [[Dominica]] and [[Saint Lucia]] came through the port.<ref name=LP/>\n\nThe period 1960\u20131972 was the busiest in the dock's history, and peak volume was reached in 1968 when 2.5 million tons of trade passed through the port.<ref name=PD_PDF/> However, the [[UK dockers' strike (1970)|Dockers Strikes]] of 1969 and 1970 severely disrupted the port's ferry services and deterred much of its foreign traffic and resulted in a noticeable fall in revenue, a trend that was not to be reversed.<ref name=PD_PDF/> The docks continued to experience a steady decrease in trade, including the abandonment of ferry services, and in 1975 the first serious financial trouble began after an operating loss of \u00a31.5m, the largest in the port's history, was reported.<ref name=LEP>{{cite web |URL=https://www.lep.co.uk/news/how-time-was-called-preston-docks-765403 |title=How time was called on Preston Docks |publisher=Lancashire Evening post |author=Imogen Cooper |date=2 November 2016 |access-date=22 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nConstant dredging of the Ribble proved a huge burden upon the port's revenue; in 1975 45% of the dock's income was spent on dredging operations.<ref name=PD_PDF/> A report to the then Preston Borough Council in September 1979 advised that there was no future prospect for operating the port at a profit and it was resolved that the docks should be closed and the area redeveloped.\n\n===Closure===\nFollowing a boom period in the 1960s Preston Dock suffered a series of financial setbacks in the early 1970s, which led to a record loss of \u00a31.5 million in 1975, and each subsequent year of the decade recorded losses of between \u00a3800,000 and \u00a31 million.<ref name=PD_PDF/>\n\nAs early as 1975 reports were produced looking into what could be done to stem the losses. However, the rising cost of operations and the decreasing revenues from diminishing trade{{efn|The number of ships visiting the port in 1975 was recorded at 675 but fell to 538 just one year later.<ref name=LEP/>}}  led to the then Preston Borough Council deciding to close the port, and a phased closure was announced in 1976, which would result in the redundancy of 450 workers. However, a campaign to keep the port open, led by the public, newspapers, dockside workers, trade unions and local industry, gave the port a reprieve and the council applied for and received a grant of \u00a32 million from Westminster for a two-year trial to revive the port's ailing fortunes. The council had still found no feasible solutions to the dock's inherent problems 18 months later, including a suggestion to redevelop the docks into a multi-functional estate creating an additional 1,500 jobs, which was rejected by the unions and local Labour councillors. With no further government funding available and facing the prospect of subsidising the dock at a cost of around a million pounds a year - a cost that Preston could not afford in a time of national economic downturn - in October 1979 the final decision was made to close the port in two years time.<ref name=LEP/><ref name=CPW1>{{cite web |URL=https://ribblesteam.wordpress.com/2016/08/12/why-did-preston-port-close/ |title=Why did Preston port close? |publisher=Chuffs, Puffs & Whistles |author=Ribble Steam Railway |date=12 August 2016 |access-date=28 February 2020}}</ref>\n \nClosing the dock was not a straightforward procedure; a Private Members' Bill and an Act of Parliament would be required which would take about six months to prepare. Nor would it be cheap; it would require paying off outstanding debts and loans, and the payment of compensation including redundancy pay. The total cost was estimated at \u00a33.5 million over 10 years, which would be recovered through the sale of the dock's assets and a levy imposed upon Preston's ratepayers. Assets identified for sale included cranes, dredgers and miscellaneous small vessels, pipelines and large fixtures, with an estimated value of \u00a31.5 million.<ref name=PD_PDF/><ref name=LEP/>\n\nThe Port of Preston was formally closed by the ''Preston Dock Closure Act'' on 31 October 1981, with the direct loss of 350 jobs.<ref name=PD_PDF/><ref name=CPW1/>\n\n===Redevelopment===\n[[File:Albert Edward Basin Preston 20141110.jpg|thumb|Looking southeast across the Albert Edward Basin from the northwest side of the docks]]\n[[File:Swingbridge, Preston Docks - geograph.org.uk - 802026.jpg|thumb|Preston Dock swing bridge]]\n\nIn 1980 with the looming closure of the dock the Central Lancashire Development Corporation carried out a preliminary study,''Preston Dock Redevelopment \u2013 Summary Report (1980)'', broadly proposing to redevelop over {{convert|380|acre|order=flip}} of the former docklands for mixed use (similar to the suggestion proposed but rejected when the dock's closure was first announced in 1976). However, their study identified a number of major constraints including polluted water and contaminated land, inadequacy of flood defences, and lack of infrastructure which would result in high costs of clearance and reclamation. The study also identified that for any redevelopment to be successful, a partnership between the council and private enterprise, would be necessary, and that funding was available from Westminster in accordance with the ''Derelict Land Grants'' scheme.<ref name=PD_PDF/>\n\nThe proposed name for the redeveloped site would be \"Riversway\", as it was to be mostly built on land that was the original course of the river, and the council began inviting bids from national and local consortia to produce detailed proposals for the redevelopment. Due to the size of the project and the associated constraints, the process was protracted and it was not until 1985 that a plan was finally chosen, submitted by Holder Mathias (Architects) of London and the [[Balfour Beatty]] corporation. The plan proposed that the former norther quayside would be redeveloped for retail use, the southern quayside for residential use, and the basin would feature a public marina. The area to the west of Riversway, tentatively referred to as \"Riversway West\", would be reserved for future commercial and light industrial use. The plan's general strategy was that the clearance, reclamation and infrastructure works would commence immediately to attract investment from the private sector to redevelop individual site. A condition of the proposal was that Balfour Beatty retained the development rights on the prime waterfront area north and east of the dock basin, in return for funding the road infrastructure project.<ref name=PD_PDF/>\n\nThe plan identified that the existing docklands railway along the north side of the basin occupied valuable development sites, and the railway would be diverted along the banks of the Ribble behind the dock's southern quay. This necessitated the construction of a {{convert|1,000|t|adj=on}} swing bridge across the entrance to the lock which, to save money, had the railway tracks running down the centre of the roadway. Construction of the new infrastructure began in 1985 and generally proceeded from east to west, and continued until 1992.<ref name=PD_PDF/> New roads were constructed, including:\n* 'Mariners Way', running parallel to Waters Lane along the basin's northern quayside, following the original course of the Ribble.\n* 'Navigation Way', running parallel between the northern bank of the Ribble and the basin's southern quayside, across the new swing bridge on the western side of the basin and joining Mariners Way.\n* 'Port Way', running east from Strand Road along the north bank of the Ribble (from about opposite the site of the 1820s port) and turning north along the eastern end of the basin to join Waters Lane, and providing access into Mariner's Way.\n* 'Pedders Way', running from Waters Lane down to the western end of the basin, providing access to Mariners Way and Navigation Way, as well as to the existing industrial estate in Chain Caul Way.\n* 'Channel Way', a smaller road running west from the A59 near Strand Road to provide east-bound traffic access to Riversway, it runs to the northern end of Port Way (also following the original course of the Ribble) to Strand Road, as well as providing access to a potential new business park to the east of Riversway.\n \nOnly four of the dock's original buildings{{efn|Some websites state that the lighthouse located in front of the Morrisons supermarket is an original from the Preston Docks; however, this is a replica constructed in 1986.<ref name=LH>{{cite web |URL=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/5961548 |title=SD5192: Lighthouse at Albert Edward Dock |publisher=Geograph UK |author=Thomas Nugent |date=19 October 2018 |access-date=22 February 2020}}</ref>}} were retained:<ref name=PD_PDF/>\n* Shed No.3 on the south side of the basin, redeveloped for residential use as \u201cVictoria Mansions\u201d\n* Customs House on Dock Road \n* the office of Transport Ferry Service off Pedders Way (subsequently demolished for new development)\n* the original Pump House building adjacent to the tidal basin (subsequently demolished for new development)\n\nFollowing the opening of Riversway in July 1987,<ref>{{cite book |title=Preston in 50 Buildings |author=Keith Johnson |date=2016 |publisher=Amberley Publishing |publication-place=Gloucestershire, UK |ISBN=9781445658971}}</ref> over 2,000 jobs have been created from the opening of new and the relocation of exiting businesses.

Despite repeated attempts to cure the problem and improve water quality, outbreaks still occur and are most prevalent in the warmer months, and signs are posted around the basin by the [[Preston City Council]] warning against swimming (including pets).<ref>{{cite web |title=Visitor Information Albert Edward Basin |publisher=Preston City Council |url=http://www.preston.gov.uk/leisure-and-culture/riversway/visiting-riversway/blue-green-algal-blooms/ |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |URL=https://www.lep.co.uk/best-in/outdoors/locals-launch-bid-clean-water-preston-dock-924894 |title=Locals launch bid to clean up water in Preston Dock |publisher=Lancashire Evening Post |author=Brian Ellis |date=23 October 2019 |access-date=28 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Industrial waste====\nRedevelopment of the former docks saw the removal of land contaminated by industrial use. It was deemed that the most cost-effective solution was to create a purpose-made disposal area, licensed by the city's [[Waste disposal authority|Waste Disposal Authority]], on the river bank west of the main development. The contaminated soils were sealed in clay-lined containment cells and covered over, and the details recorded on a contaminated land register held by the council.<ref name=PD_PDF/>\n\nIn 2002\u201303 the council undertook an extensive investigation into soil and groundwater conditions at the site, and the basin and the river were sampled for any leakage from the containment cells. It was reported that no further remedial work was required to protect the Albert Edward Dock or the River Ribble due to low chemical concentrations. Furthermore, a cost-benefit analysis on the recovery of remaining hydrocarbons would have proved prohibitively expensive with little benefit to the environmental quality of the river. Therefore, in light of the findings and agreement with the [[Environment Agency]] this investigation was concluded.<ref>{{cite web |URL=https://www.preston.gov.uk/media/209/Contaminated-Land-Strategy-2012/pdf/Contaminated-Land-Strategy-2012.pdf?m=636906835179970000 |title=Contaminated Land Strategy 2012 |publisher=Preston City Council |date=March 2012 |access-date=28 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Historic facilities ==\n===Boat lock===\nLocated at the western end of the Albert Edward Basin is the ''Bull Nose'', a series of [[Lock (water navigation)|lock gates]] to maintain a constant water level within the basin and to provide ingress and egress for vessels to and from the River Ribble. The lock gates allow vessels up to {{convert|60|feet|metres}} in width to enter the basin. The gates are the original items installed when the docks were constructed in the 1880\u20131890s, and are made of Greenheart main timbers and Iroko planking. Each gate weighs 98 tons.<ref name=BP/>\n\nThe first single pair of gates separates the tidal basin from the River Ribble, to maintain a minimum operating depth in the tidal basin so that during low tide when the level of water in the river is too low to allow vessels to journey to the sea, they can remain in the tidal basin and not take up valuable berthing space along the docks. The main lock is two pairs of gates located on each end of a short canal, separating the tidal basin from the main shipping basin. When vessels enter the lock from the tidal basin, if the water level is lower than the level of the main basin, water is pumped in and once the inner gates are open the vessel can continue to the docks. When vessels enter the lock from the main basin, if the water level is higher than the level of the tidal basin, water is pumped out and once the outer gates are open the vessel can continue into the tidal basin. The lock limits vessels over approximately {{convert|200|metres|ft}} from entering the main basin.\n\nFollowing the closure of Preston Dock flood mitigation work commenced between 1982 and 1985 to stop flooding during severe storms and exceptionally high tides;{{efn|In 1977 a combination of high river levels and strong westerly winds blowing a high tide in to the Ribble estuary resulted in the flooding of large areas of the docklands.<ref name=PD_PDF/>}} the gates from the river to the tidal basin were repositioned and raised to a higher level so as to also act as storm gates, and flood banks were built along the river edge to a level of {{convert|8|metres|ft}} [[Ordnance datum|above ordnance datum]] (AOD). During these works, all gates were refurbished, for which a large {{convert|100|tonne|adj=on}} crane was constructed along the southern quayside near the lock, and in 1985 a new control tower building (which also controls the swing bridge) was opened, with operations overseen by the Preston City Council.<ref name=PD_PDF/>\n\nThe boat lock remains in operation to this day and provides access to the Preston Marina, which was built following redevelopment of the docks. The gates can open up to one hour before [[High water|High Water]] ([[Liverpool]]) and remain open up to  two hours after this time. Different opening timetables operate over summer and winter. Vessels arriving outside these hours can remain in the lay-by berth within the lock chamber, and await the next gate opening. The lock does not provide 24 hour operations; the control tower can be contacted on [[Marine VHF radio|VHF]] Channel 16.<ref>{{cite web |URL=http://prestonmarina.co.uk/index.php/lock-gates/ |title=Lock gate operating times |publisher=Preston marina |access-date=22 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Docklands Railway===\n[[File:Bagnall 0-6-0ST prob. no. 2682 (1942) Preston Docks 08.1968 (2) (9859843804).jpg|thumb|Steam locomotive on Preston Dock, 1968]]\n[[File:RSR Preston Docks Swing Bridge 20150913.jpg|thumb|A preserved steam locomotive of the [[Ribble Steam Railway]] crossing the Preston Docks swing bridge]]\n\nIn 1845 a railway line was built linking the old docks at Victoria Quay to Preston's main railway station{{efn|Although only a little over a half mile in length, the docklands branch line posed some problems in its construction and operation. A steep-sided cutting and tunnel had to be dug under Fishergate and West Cliff Terrace and the new line was a rather sharp curve, which limited the wheelbase of the locomotives and wagons that could be used. The line was also quite steep, with a 1:29 gradient. This limited the weight of the trains, as they needed to be held under brakes down the hill, and locomotives required sufficient power to haul the trains up the hill (and the more powerful locomotives were usually the biggest, often too long for the sharply curving track).

The line, officially known as the Preston Dock Branch Line, was originally operated by the [[North Union Railway]] until 1889, when ownership and operation transferred to the Preston Corporation. The corporation operated eight small [[tank locomotive]]s which remained in service until 1968 when they were replaced by [[Sentinel Waggon Works|Sentinel]] [[Switcher|diesel shunters]], which remain in operation today with Ribble Rail, a subsidiary of the Ribble Steam railway, working bitumen trains. At the dock's peak the railway comprised around {{convert|27|mi|order=flip}} of track, with multiple tracks and sidings running on both the north and south sides of the Albert Edward Basin. A marshalling yard, engine sheds and workshops were built at the western end of the docks on the northern shore of the Ribble, which is now the site of museum and workshops of the [[Ribble Steam Railway]] (RSR).<ref name=RSRM/>\n\nThe railway remained in operation after the docks' closure, with up to nine trains per week continuing to deliver petrol to the [[Petrofina]] petroleum storage tanks on Chain Caul Way (now part of the Anchorage Business park) until the company ceased operations at this site in 1992 and the facility was demolished. This left just one company, the Lancashire Tar Distillers (also located in what is now the Anchorage Business Park), still operating rail services, with three weekly freight trains delivering crude bitumen from the from the [[Lindsey Oil Refinery]] in [[Lincolnshire]] to the distilling plant, and empty trains returning to the Lincolnshire refinery from the Preston Docks.{{efn|The trains travel overnight from the refinery to Preston via [[Hebden Bridge]] in heated tankers which maintain the crude bitumen to between {{convert|160|-|180|C}} to stop it from hardening.

In 2004 when rail operations resumed the new 10-year contract upgraded the required amount of bitumen to {{convert|110,000|t}} per annum; as a result the number of tankers increased to ten or twelve, for a total haulage of {{convert|1,000|-|1,200|t}} per train. In 2010 a new design of tanker was introduced with an increased load capacity of {{convert|74|t}} and able to hold the crude bitumen at a more constant temperature. A more powerful locomotive was brought into service, with each train now comprising fourteen or fifteen tankers for a total haulage of {{convert|1,400|-|1,500|t}}. The tankers are hauled by a main line locomotive to a siding off Port Way, where they are collected by a historic Sentinel diesel shunter (which previously operated on the docklands railways in the 1960s) and delivered to the processing plant on Chain Caul Way.<ref name=CPW2/>}}  However, in 1995 the company switched to road transportation and the trains stopped until 2004, when the plant was sold to [[Total S.A.|Total UK]] and rail operations recommenced.<ref name=PD_PDF/><ref name=CPW2/><ref name=RSRM/>\n\nThe redevelopment of the docks in the 1980s led to removal of much of the rail lines, but in 1985 a single line was built across the new Preston Docks swing bridge which ran along the north bank of the Ribble and rejoined the existing line near the [[level crossing]] on Strand Road.

In 1873 Allsup (as he was now known) transferred title to his sons and the company became William Allsup & Sons Ltd Shipbuilders, Engineers and Iron Founders (no record can be found as to what became of Watson) and established three shipyards along the Ribble, specialising in vessels made from iron.<ref name=Hindle/> Records show at least 26 ships being built,<ref>{{cite web |URL=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Alsupp_and_Sons |title=Alsupp and Sons |publisher=Grace's Guide to British History |access-date=26 February 2020}}</ref> including the passenger steamer SS ''Toroa'' in 1899, which ran aground in 1916 off Babbit Island, [[Tasmania]], [[Australia]], with the loss of all hands.<ref>{{cite web |URL=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/152760097 |title=Daily Telegraph (Launceston, TAS) Tuesday 16 May 1916  |publisher=National Library of Australia |access-date=26 February 2020}}</ref> In 1899 it was reported that Allsup's main yard was destroyed in a fire,<ref>Cheltenham Chronicle, 4th March 1899</ref> but the company continued to build vessels until at least 1902.<ref>{{cite web |URL=http://shippingandshipbuilding.uk/list.php?vessel=&builder=10560 |title=Vessel List (Preston) |publisher=Shipping and Shipbuilding |access-date=26 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe shipbuilding industry was not without its dangers.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

A series of Coalition military operations were relatively ineffective at removing the resistance presence in the Desert. As the resistance began to gain control of the surrounding areas, coalition spokesmen began to downplay the importance of the Syrian Desert as a center of operations; nevertheless the Syrian Desert remains one of the primary routes for smuggling equipment due to its location near the Syrian border. By September 2006 the resistance had gained control of virtually all of the Anbar Governorate and had moved most of their forces, equipment and leaders further east to resistance-controlled cities near the Euphrates river.<ref>{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15362568 |title=U.S. diplomat apologizes for remarks |publisher=NBC News |date=2006-10-22 |accessdate=2011-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Ellen |last=Knickmeyer |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/29/AR2006052901172_pf.html |title=U.S. Will Reinforce Troops in West Iraq |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2006-05-29 |accessdate=2011-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13039231/ |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120525180025/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/13039231/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-05-25 |title=WP: U.S. to reinforce troops in west Iraq |publisher=MSNBC |date=2006-05-30 |accessdate=2011-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/10/AR2006091001204.html?nav=rss_email/components |title=Situation Called Dire in West Iraq |newspaper=Washington Post |date=2006-09-10 |accessdate=2011-02-02}}</ref>\n\n== Economy and agriculture ==\nWith low rainfall and poor quality soils, today the region is principally used as [[rangeland]] for livestock.

In some areas, when grazing was restricted, there was a spontaneous return of many of the native plants. In other areas which were more heavily degraded, grazing restrictions were supplemented by reseeding and the planting of fodder species. By the time the project ended in 2010, nearly a quarter of a million hectares had been reseeded, and nearly a hundred thousand hectares had been planted with native fodder shrubs.

A series of Coalition military operations were relatively ineffective at removing the resistance presence in the Desert. As the resistance began to gain control of the surrounding areas, coalition spokesmen began to downplay the importance of the Syrian Desert as a center of operations; nevertheless the Syrian Desert remains one of the primary routes for smuggling equipment due to its location near the Syrian border. By September 2006 the resistance had gained control of virtually all of the Anbar Governorate and had moved most of their forces, equipment and leaders further east to resistance-controlled cities near the Euphrates river.<ref>{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15362568 |title=U.S. diplomat apologizes for remarks |publisher=NBC News |date=2006-10-22 |accessdate=2011-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Ellen |last=Knickmeyer |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/29/AR2006052901172_pf.html |title=U.S. Will Reinforce Troops in West Iraq |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2006-05-29 |accessdate=2011-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13039231/ |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120525180025/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/13039231/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-05-25 |title=WP: U.S. to reinforce troops in west Iraq |publisher=MSNBC |date=2006-05-30 |accessdate=2011-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/10/AR2006091001204.html?nav=rss_email/components |title=Situation Called Dire in West Iraq |newspaper=Washington Post |date=2006-09-10 |accessdate=2011-02-02}}</ref>\n\n== Economy and agriculture ==\nWith low rainfall and poor quality soils, today the region is principally used as [[rangeland]] for livestock.

In some areas, when grazing was restricted, there was a spontaneous return of many of the native plants. In other areas which were more heavily degraded, grazing restrictions were supplemented by reseeding and the planting of fodder species. By the time the project ended in 2010, nearly a quarter of a million hectares had been reseeded, and nearly a hundred thousand hectares had been planted with native fodder shrubs.

The son of a New York stockbroker, he initially worked in his father's firm but was more interested in theater. He landed jobs as an extra in [[short films]] produced by [[Paramount Pictures]] in its Long Island studio, and also performed with several stock theater companies, culminating with playing the male lead in the 1929 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Sweet Adeline (musical)|Sweet Adeline]]''. This performance attracted the attention of film studio executives, and in 1931, [[Fox Film]] signed him to a Hollywood contract. \n\nHis screen debut in the 1931 film ''[[Bad Girl (1931 film)|Bad Girl]]'' made him an overnight box-office star and he was cast as the lead in a succession of romantic drama and comedy films. In 1934, he co-starred with [[Shirley Temple]] in her first three films. In 1935, at the height of his popularity, he broke his studio contract two years before it expired and became a free agent. With musicals on the wane in the late 1930s, he was cast in a series of [[B movie]]s and began struggling with alcoholism in his personal life. In 1945, having not worked in film for five years, he was selected by director [[Elia Kazan]] for the role of Johnny Nolan, the dreamy alcoholic father in ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945 film)|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'' (1945), which earned him the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. \n\nThe Oscar did not advance his film career, however, and while he still found roles in Broadway productions, in the late 1940s he became a [[character actor]] on television. He had a regular role in the hit sitcom ''[[It's a Great Life (TV series)|It's a Great Life]]''  from 1954 to 1956, and guest-starred in dozens of episodes of popular television series from the 1950s through mid-1960s.

The son of a New York stockbroker, he initially worked in his father's firm but was more interested in theater. He landed jobs as an extra in [[short films]] produced by [[Paramount Pictures]] in its Long Island studio, and also performed with several stock theater companies, culminating with playing the male lead in the 1929 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Sweet Adeline (musical)|Sweet Adeline]]''. This performance attracted the attention of film studio executives, and in 1931, [[Fox Film]] signed him to a Hollywood contract. \n\nHis screen debut in the 1931 film ''[[Bad Girl (1931 film)|Bad Girl]]'' made him an overnight box-office star and he was cast as the lead in a succession of romantic drama and comedy films. In 1934, he co-starred with [[Shirley Temple]] in her first three films. In 1935, at the height of his popularity, he broke his studio contract two years before it expired and became a free agent. With musicals on the wane in the late 1930s, he was cast in a series of [[B movie]]s and began struggling with alcoholism in his personal life. In 1945, having not worked in film for five years, he was selected by director [[Elia Kazan]] for the role of Johnny Nolan, the dreamy alcoholic father in ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945 film)|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'' (1945), which earned him the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. \n\nThe Oscar did not advance his film career, however, and while he still found roles in Broadway productions, in the late 1940s he became a [[character actor]] on television. He had a regular role in the hit sitcom ''[[It's a Great Life (TV series)|It's a Great Life]]''  from 1954 to 1956, and guest-starred in dozens of episodes of popular television series from the 1950s through mid-1960s.
