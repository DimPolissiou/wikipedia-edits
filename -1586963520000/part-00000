He is credited on most Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive and B.T.O. albums as \"C.F. Turner\".\n\n== History ==\nFred Turner played in over a dozen bands in and around [[Winnipeg]] during his early adult years, his first vocal recordings being with the group Pink Plumm, which released one independent single. Based upon advice [[Randy Bachman]] received from [[Neil Young]], Turner was subsequently asked to join Randy's band [[Brave Belt]] in 1971.<ref>\"Driving Music: Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive,\" article at www.allpar.com</ref> At the time, Turner was playing and singing in a cover band called the D-Drifters. The D-Drifters wanted to continue doing cover songs, and had repeatedly rejected Turner's original compositions. When the call came from Bachman, Turner jumped at the chance to join a band that played original material.<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\">Gormley, Peter. \"BTO (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive) Frequently Asked Questions,\" 7/31/97.</ref>\n\nThe lead vocalist for the first Brave Belt album was [[Chad Allan (musician)|Chad Allan]], Randy Bachman's former bandmate from [[The Guess Who]]. While shopping around the tapes to record companies and eventually getting interest from Reprise Records, Randy was required to list the band members for contracts. Although he had played both lead guitar and bass on the recording, Randy listed Turner as the bassist. Turner's photo was put on the ''Brave Belt'' back cover, but he was not involved in the recordings. Soon, Turner stepped in as a full-time lead vocalist and bassist, which led to the departure of Allen.<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\"/> Fred contributed five song compositions to the follow-up ''Brave Belt II'' album (1972), and he sang lead vocal on nine of the album's eleven songs. While shopping around a proposed \"Brave Belt III\" album, the band changed its name to Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (BTO). Although Randy Bachman was the more widely known name because of his years with The Guess Who, [[Robbie Bachman]] stated in numerous interviews that there could have been no \"BTO sound\" without Turner's contributions: \"The first Brave Belt album was very country-rock. Everything changed when Fred joined the band. We had Fred Turner's heavy, rough voice. We evolved because of Mr. Turner.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorkwaste.com/nyw_main/music/MarkAfterDark/markdark02.html |title=''Mark After Dark'' interview with B.T.O. drummer Rob Bachman, \"Behind the Four Wheel Drive\" |publisher=Newyorkwaste.com |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nTurner and BTO enjoyed a period of peak popularity between 1973 and 1976, which saw the band release five Top 40 albums and six US Top 40 singles (eleven in Canada). When Randy Bachman left Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive in late 1977, Turner switched from bass to rhythm guitar to make room for bassist\u2013vocalist [[Jim Clench]]. This new line-up for 1978\u201379 was only called B.T.O. and nothing else, due to legal issues surrounding the use of the Bachman surname. After two albums and supporting tours, this version of B.T.O. called it quits in early 1980. Turner resumed his original role on the bass upon rejoining Randy Bachman in a band called Union, which released a 1981 album titled ''On Strike''. Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive then re-formed for a [[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1984 album)|1984 album]] and subsequent tour.\n\n{{Quote box|width=28%|align=left|quote=\"Turner's songwriting and nimble bass guitar work provide a groovy foundation, but his greatest strength is his voice.

Turner also wrote and sang the lead on \"Heartaches\" (1979), the lone B.T.O. single to chart in the post-Randy Bachman era.\n\nTurner recorded a solo song for the ''Animal Magnetism'' CD called \"Walk With You\" in 1996. The ''Animal Magnetism'' album was put together by [[Riff West]]. Other musicians that recorded songs for this album include [[Dave Peverett|Lonesome Dave Peverett]] of [[Foghat]], [[Pat Travers]], and [[Edgar Winter]].  In 2000, he made a voice appearance with Randy Bachman on an episode of ''The Simpsons''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snpp.com/episodes/BABF09 |title=Saddlesore Galatica |publisher=Snpp.com |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}</ref>  \n\nTurner's last performance on stage with any formation of BTO was in 2004 with Randy Murray.

He is credited on most Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive and B.T.O. albums as \"C.F. Turner\".\n\n== History ==\nFred Turner played in over a dozen bands in and around [[Winnipeg]] during his early adult years, his first vocal recordings being with the group Pink Plumm, which released one independent single. Based upon advice [[Randy Bachman]] received from [[Neil Young]], Turner was subsequently asked to join Randy's band [[Brave Belt]] in 1971.<ref>\"Driving Music: Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive,\" article at www.allpar.com</ref> At the time, Turner was playing and singing in a cover band called the D-Drifters. The D-Drifters wanted to continue doing cover songs, and had repeatedly rejected Turner's original compositions. When the call came from Bachman, Turner jumped at the chance to join a band that played original material.<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\">Gormley, Peter. \"BTO (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive) Frequently Asked Questions,\" 7/31/97.</ref>\n\nThe lead vocalist for the first Brave Belt album was [[Chad Allan (musician)|Chad Allan]], Randy Bachman's former bandmate from [[The Guess Who]]. While shopping around the tapes to record companies and eventually getting interest from Reprise Records, Randy was required to list the band members for contracts. Although he had played both lead guitar and bass on the recording, Randy listed Turner as the bassist. Turner's photo was put on the ''Brave Belt'' back cover, but he was not on the recordings. Soon, Turner stepped in as a full-time lead vocalist and bassist, which led to the departure of Allen.<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\"/> Fred contributed five song compositions to the follow-up ''Brave Belt II'' album (1972), and he sang lead vocal on nine of the album's eleven songs. While shopping around a proposed \"Brave Belt III\" album, the band changed its name to Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (BTO). Although Randy Bachman was the more widely known name because of his years with The Guess Who, [[Robbie Bachman]] stated in numerous interviews that there could have been no \"BTO sound\" without Turner's contributions: \"The first Brave Belt album was very country-rock. Everything changed when Fred joined the band. We had Fred Turner's heavy, rough voice. We evolved because of Mr. Turner.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorkwaste.com/nyw_main/music/MarkAfterDark/markdark02.html |title=''Mark After Dark'' interview with B.T.O. drummer Rob Bachman, \"Behind the Four Wheel Drive\" |publisher=Newyorkwaste.com |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nTurner and BTO enjoyed a period of peak popularity between 1973 and 1976, which saw the band release five Top 40 albums and six US Top 40 singles (eleven in Canada). When Randy Bachman left Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive in late 1977, Turner switched from bass to rhythm guitar to make room for bassist\u2013vocalist [[Jim Clench]]. This new line-up for 1978\u201379 was only called B.T.O. and nothing else, due to legal issues surrounding the use of the Bachman surname. After two albums and supporting tours, this version of B.T.O. called it quits in early 1980. Turner resumed his original role on the bass upon rejoining Randy Bachman in a band called Union, which released a 1981 album titled ''On Strike''. Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive then re-formed for a [[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1984 album)|1984 album]] and subsequent tour.\n\n{{Quote box|width=28%|align=left|quote=\"Turner's songwriting and nimble bass guitar work provide a groovy foundation, but his greatest strength is his voice.

Turner also wrote and sang the lead on \"Heartaches\" (1979), the lone B.T.O. single to chart in the post-Randy Bachman era.\n\nTurner recorded a solo song for the ''Animal Magnetism'' CD called \"Walk With You\" in 1996. The ''Animal Magnetism'' album was put together by [[Riff West]]. Other musicians that recorded songs for this album include [[Dave Peverett|Lonesome Dave Peverett]] of [[Foghat]], [[Pat Travers]], and [[Edgar Winter]].  In 2000, he made a voice appearance with Randy Bachman on an episode of ''The Simpsons''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snpp.com/episodes/BABF09 |title=Saddlesore Galatica |publisher=Snpp.com |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}</ref>  \n\nTurner's last performance on stage with any formation of BTO was in 2004 with Randy Murray. The two were backed by members of the [[Little River Band]] because drummer [[Robbie Bachman]] and guitarist [[Blair Thornton]] were unable to attend BTO's last show. Turner is the only member of Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive to be on every album the band released.\n\n==2010 Bachman and Turner reunion==\nTurner reunited with Randy Bachman and recorded a new [[Bachman & Turner (Album)|self-titled album]] that was released in September 2010 under the name \"[[Bachman & Turner]].\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sterdan |first=Darryl |url=http://www.winnipegsun.com/entertainment/columnists/darryl_sterdan/2009/12/06/12061376-sun.html |title=Bachman and Turner return |publisher=Winnipegsun.com |date=December 7, 2009 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bachmanandturner.com |title=BTO official biography |publisher=Bachmanandturner.com |date= |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> Originally, Randy was developing a solo album and asked Fred to be a guest vocalist on one track called \"Rock n\u2019 Roll is the Only Way Out\".

He became interested in [[behaviorism]] while studying philosophy at Columbia University, and went on to study under [[Fred S. Keller|Fred Keller]] and [[William N. Schoenfeld|Wiliam N. Schoenfeld]], the experimental psychologists. He took a job as a research assistant in a neurology lab to gain more understanding of the [[nervous system]], and became involved in [[Body schema#Deafferentation|deafferentation]] experiments with monkeys.\n\nAn ''[[afferent nerve]]'' is a sensory nerve that conveys impulses from the skin and other sensory organs to the spine and the brain. ''Deafferentation'' is a surgical procedure in which the [[spinal cord]] is opened up and the sensory nerves cut so that these impulses do not reach the brain.  A monkey whose limbs have been deafferented will not feel them, or even be able to sense where they are in space. At his trial in 1981, Taub told the court that deafferented monkeys are notoriously difficult to look after, because they regard their deafferented limbs as foreign objects, mutilating them and trying to chew them off.<ref name=Schwartz149>Schwartz and Begley 2002, p. 149.</ref> Taub continued working with deafferented monkeys at [[New York University]], where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1970. Engaged in what he saw at first as [[pure research]], he conducted several kinds of deafferentation experiments. He deafferented monkeys' entire bodies, so that they could feel no part of themselves. He deafferented them at birth. He removed monkey fetuses from the uterus, deafferented them, then returned them to be born with no sense of their own bodies.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nWhen Taub began his research in the neurology lab, the prevalent view was that monkeys would not be able to use limbs they could not feel. [[Norman Doidge]] writes that Taub wondered whether the reason the monkeys abandoned use of the deafferented limbs was simply that they were still able to use their good ones. He tested his idea by deafferenting one arm of a monkey and restraining the good arm in a sling. The monkey subsequently used its deafferented arm to feed and move itself around. He reasoned that, if a monkey refused to use a deafferented arm because it could rely on its good arm, then deafferenting both arms would force the monkey to use them, a finding that seemed paradoxical, but which his experiments confirmed. He even deafferented the entire spinal cord, so that the monkey received no sensory input from any of its limbs, but it still used them. Doidge writes that Taub had an epiphany, guessing that the reason the monkeys would not use their deafferented limbs was simply because they had learned not to, an idea he called \"[[learned non-use]].\"<ref>Doidge 2007, pp. 139, 141.</ref>\n\n===Alex Pacheco===\nAlex Pacheco (born 1958) was a graduate student at [[George Washington University]] when he volunteered in May 1981 to work as a research assistant in Taub's lab. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' writes that he was raised in Mexico, the son of a doctor, and wanted to become a priest. He took a tour of a [[slaughterhouse]] in the 1970s and said it changed his life; he read [[Peter Singer]]'s ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' (1975), stopped eating meat, and became an animal rights activist. He worked on the anti-whaling ship, the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]], joined the [[Hunt Saboteurs Association]] in England, and when he returned to the United States to study political science at George Washington, he teamed up with [[Ingrid Newkirk]], a local poundmaster, to form People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in March 1980. The point of taking the research position in Taub's lab was to gain firsthand experience of what happens in animal research laboratories, so he looked through a list of government-funded labs and chose the one nearest his home in [[Takoma Park, Maryland|Takoma Park]].<ref  name=Carlson/> Taub offered him an unpaid position and put him to work with a student, Georgette Yakalis.<ref name=Pacheco />\n\n===The monkeys===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:TwoSilverSpringmonkeys.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Two of the Silver Spring monkeys, photographed inside the Institute by Alex Pacheco]] -->\nInside the Institute for Behavioral Research, Taub was conducting deafferentation experiments on 16 male [[crab-eating macaque]]s (''Macaca fascicularis''),  and one female [[rhesus macaque]] (''Macaca mulatta''), each about 14&nbsp;inches tall, all born wild in the Philippines.  Each monkey lived alone in a wire cage measuring 18&nbsp; x&nbsp;18&nbsp;inches, with no bedding, no food bowl, and no environmental enrichment, the cages kept in a windowless room measuring 15&nbsp;ft square.<ref name=Guillermo13>Guillermo, Kathy Snow.

Sarah, the lone female, was a control subject, which meant she had been left intact. She had been purchased from a dealer, Litton Laboratories, when she was one day old, and had lived since then, for eight years, in the Institute.<ref name=Carlson>Carlson, Peter. \"The Strange Case of the Silver Spring Monkeys,\" ''The Washington Post'' magazine, February 24, 1991.</ref> Paul was the eldest. He had had one arm deafferented. He had chewed off all the fingers on that hand and pulled the skin and flesh off the palm, exposing the bone. Billy had undergone surgery to deafferent both arms, and used his feet to pick up food pellets.<ref name=Guillermo13/>\n\n==Police raid and charges==\n\n===Pacheco's description of the laboratory===\nPacheco wrote that he found the monkeys living in filthy conditions. He found frozen monkey corpses in a refrigerator, and others floating in [[formaldehyde]].<ref name=Carlson/> He alleged that, in the surgery room, human and monkey records were scattered everywhere, including under the operating table, while soiled clothes, old shoes, rat droppings, and urine covered the floor, with [[cockroach]]es in the drawers, on the floor, and around the scrub sink. He said the wires of the cages were caked in filth, with feces piled in the bottom of the cages, and urine and rust on every surface, with the 17 monkeys picking at scraps of food that had fallen through the wire floor of the cages into the waste tray below. He alleged that the cages had not been cleaned for months, that there were no dishes to keep the food away from the feces, and that there was nothing for the monkeys to sit on but the cages' wire bottoms. He wrote that 12 of the monkeys had deafferented limbs, with 39 of their fingers deformed or missing. He described them as neurotic, attacking their deafferented limbs as though they were foreign objects:<ref name=Pacheco/>\n\n{{quote|No one bothered to bandage the monkeys' injuries properly (on the few occasions when bandages were used at all), and antibiotics were administered only once; no lacerations or self-amputation injuries were ever cleaned. Whenever a bandage was applied, it was never changed, no matter how filthy or soiled it became. They were left on until they deteriorated to the point where they fell off the injured limb. Old, rotted fragments of bandage were stuck to the cage floors where they collected urine and feces. The monkeys also suffered from a variety of wounds that were self-inflicted or inflicted by monkeys grabbing at them from adjoining cages. I saw discolored, exposed muscle tissue on their arms. Two monkeys had bones protruding through their flesh. Several had bitten off their own fingers and had festering stubs, which they extended towards me as I discreetly took the fruit from my pockets. With these pitiful limbs they searched through the foul mess of their waste pans for something to eat.<ref name=Pacheco/>}}\n\n===Informal inspections and raid===\nPacheco decided to document the conditions in the lab. He told Taub he wanted to work at night, and took photographs that showed the monkeys' living conditions. He showed them in July to animal rights activists, including [[Cleveland Amory]], who gave him money for a better camera and some [[walkie-talkie]]s, so that a look-out outside could alert him if visitors arrived unexpectedly. He also asked Peter Hamilton of the [[Vancouver]]-based Lifeforce Foundation to assist with the investigation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} In August, Pacheco began inviting veterinarians and scientists into the lab to witness the conditions. According to ''The Washington Post'', Geza Teleki, a primatologist at George Washington University, wrote that he had never seen a lab so poorly maintained, and psychologist Donald Barnes, a former primate researcher, wrote that it was a \"miserable and unhealthful environment for the primates\" and a health hazard for humans. One local veterinarian, Richard Weitzman, agreed that the lab was very dirty, but said the monkeys seemed well fed and \"in pretty good health\".<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nPacheco reported the situation to the [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] police, who raided the laboratory on September 11, 1981 under Maryland's Prevention of Cruelty to Animals law. PETA tipped off the media beforehand, so that the raid was witnessed by several reporters and a camera crew, to the irritation of the police. The officers later testified that the monkeys were living in filthy conditions. Richard Swain, who led the raid, told ''The Washington Post'' in 1991: \"It was absolutely filthy, just incredibly dirty, like nothing I've ever been in. I've executed lots and lots of search warrants. I've worked in murder, in narcotics, in vice, but this was the first time I went into a room and I felt legitimately concerned for my health just being there.\" Taub was charged with 17 counts of animal cruelty and failing to provide adequate veterinary care.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nThe police removed the monkeys from the lab to the basement of a house in [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]] owned by Lori Kenealy of the local humane society. Peter Carlson writes in ''The Washington Post'' that they were given toys, groomed with toothbrushes by the activists, watched 24 hours a day, and allowed to watch daytime soap operas. In the meantime, Taub's lawyers went to court and demanded their return, and ten days after the raid a judge granted the request. And suddenly, Carlson writes, the monkeys disappeared. Kenealy was not at home when it happened, and insisted she knew nothing about it. Richard Swain, who had led the police raid, arrested her and put her in the local jail overnight. PETA was told there could be no legal action against Taub without the monkeys as evidence. Carlson writes that, just as suddenly as they had disappeared, they were returned five days later, this time with Spanish moss in their cages after a holiday in Florida, according to the activists. After another brief stand-off, the monkeys were returned to Taub.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\n===Taub's response===\nTaub said he had been set up. He said his laboratory had been clean when he left on vacation, but that Pacheco had failed to clean the cages, had neglected the animals, then subjected the laboratory to false reports of cruelty. During Taub's vacation that August, which lasted over two weeks, on seven different days in which the animals were supposed to have been fed and the cage area cleaned, the two caretakers failed to show up for work. Taub estimated the probability of seven absences in that 2.5 week period at seven in a trillion based on the previous 14 months of attendance records from the workers. On three of those absentee days, Pacheco brought people in to look at the monkeys.<ref name=Science11dec1981>Holder, Constance. \"Scientist convicted for monkey neglect,\" ''Science'', December 11, 1981, volume 214, pp. 1218\u20131220.</ref> Taub's research assistant, John Kunz, a graduate student, said it was simply that the caretakers took advantage of Taub's absence to have a holiday of their own.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nDuring the trial in October and November 1981 of Taub and Kunz, Taub told the court\u2014as reported by ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''\u2014that the monkeys had been given \"gentle\" treatment, and had what he called a \"remarkable record of health.\" He acknowledged that they had not been seen by a veterinarian in the previous two years, because he was an expert himself in the treatment of deafferented monkeys. Responding to the images of the monkeys with open sores and decaying bandages, he said that using salves, ointments, and bandages is more dangerous than leaving the conditions untreated; monkeys feel no pain from the deafferented limbs and learn to ignore them, he said, whereas drawing attention to the wounds with salves or bandages would cause the animals to bite or claw at them. Bandages might be necessary where the wounds had grown out of control, or where there was massive infection, and it was sometimes better to let the bandages deteriorate, he said. Taub also testified that some of the photographs Pacheco took had been staged for dramatic effect.<ref name=Ettlin>Ettlin, David Michael.

He said employees had used brooms and mops on the floor, and had emptied the waste trays nearly every day. He said the monkeys had been given fresh fruit twice a week, and that he disagreed with the veterinarians who testified for the prosecution that the female monkey, Sarah, was underweight.<ref name=Ettlin/>\n\n===National Institutes of Health investigation===\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH), which had financed Taub's research, suspended his $115,000 research grant.<ref name=Ettlin/> It initiated its own investigation, and sent the Office for the Protection from Research Risks (OPRR) to assess Taub's lab. OPRR found that the lab's animal care failed in significant ways, and concluded that it was grossly unsanitary.<ref name=Science11dec1981/> Based on the OPRR investigation, NIH suspended the remaining funding for the experiments, over $200,000, because of violations of its animal care guidelines.<ref name=Boffey>Boffey, Philip M.

The prosecution said that Taub's lab was filthy and unhealthy, and federal inspection reports and witnesses supported the charge. Taub said the lab was no dirtier than any other, and he also produced federal inspection reports and witnesses to support his position. Veterinarians speaking for the prosecution said Taub's failure to bandage the monkeys' wounds was a threat to their health; veterinarians for the defense, including two who had worked with monkeys whose limbs had been deafferented, said bandaging them would cause the animals to attack the limbs. Carlson writes that the prosecution produced 70 photographs of dirty conditions and injured monkeys, while researchers who had worked in the lab testified for the defense that they had never seen the lab looking like that. The judge\u2014District Court Judge Stanley Klavan\u2014found Taub guilty of six counts of cruelty to animals for failing to provide adequate veterinary care in respect of six of the monkeys, and acquitted him of the other 11 charges against him. He fined Taub $3,000. The laboratory assistant, John Kunz, was acquitted of all 17 charges.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\n===Second trial and appeal (1982 and 1983)===\nTaub managed to secure a second trial in June 1982. After three weeks at the Montgomery County Circuit Court, a jury acquitted him of five of the convictions, and upheld the sixth charge of inadequate veterinary care of Nero, whose wounds were such that an NIH veterinarian later amputated his deafferented arm. Taub was fined $500. The sixth charge was set aside on appeal, when the court ruled that Maryland's Prevention of Cruelty to Animals law did not apply to federally funded laboratories.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\n==Fight for custody==\nAfter the monkeys were returned to Taub's custody, they were transferred to an NIH facility.<ref name=Sideris>{{cite journal | author = Sideris Lisa, McCarthy Charles, Smith David H | year = 1999 | title = Roots of Concern with Nonhuman Animals in Biomedical Ethics | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080603111554/http://dels.nas.edu/ilar_n/ilarjournal/40_1/40_1Roots.shtml | journal = ILAR Journal | volume = 40 | issue = | page = 1 }}</ref> They were later removed to the Tulane Regional Primate Research Center in [[Covington, Louisiana]], still under the care and control of the NIH.<ref>''The Washington Post'', January 5, 1989.</ref> Two primate sanctuaries, Moorpark College in California and Primarily Primates in Texas, offered them a permanent home, but the NIH refused to release them.<ref name=Barnard>Barnard ND et al.

Under anesthesia, electrodes were placed in his brain and hundreds of recordings taken. The ''Laboratory Primate Newsletter'' said it revealed an \"unprecedented degree of reorganization of the sensory cortex. An 8&ndash;10-millimeter-wide area that would normally receive input from the hand was found to have completely filled in with input from the face.\" Brainmapping studies were conducted on the remaining monkeys on July 6, 1990, three days after PETA's application for custody was rejected.

He became interested in [[behaviorism]] while studying philosophy at Columbia University, and went on to study under [[Fred S. Keller|Fred Keller]] and [[William N. Schoenfeld|Wiliam N. Schoenfeld]], the experimental psychologists. He took a job as a research assistant in a neurology lab to gain more understanding of the [[nervous system]], and became involved in [[Body schema#Deafferentation|deafferentation]] experiments with monkeys.\n\nAn ''[[afferent nerve]]'' is a sensory nerve that conveys impulses from the skin and other sensory organs to the spine and the brain. ''Deafferentation'' is a surgical procedure in which the [[spinal cord]] is opened up and the sensory nerves cut so that these impulses do not reach the brain.  A monkey whose limbs have been deafferented will not feel them, or even be able to sense where they are in space. At his trial in 1981, Taub told the court that deafferented monkeys are notoriously difficult to look after, because they regard their deafferented limbs as foreign objects, mutilating them and trying to chew them off.<ref name=Schwartz149>Schwartz and Begley 2002, p. 149.</ref> Taub continued working with deafferented monkeys at [[New York University]], where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1970. Engaged in what he saw at first as [[pure research]], he conducted several kinds of deafferentation experiments. He deafferented monkeys' entire bodies, so that they could feel no part of themselves. He deafferented them at birth. He removed monkey fetuses from the uterus, deafferented them, then returned them to be born with no sense of their own bodies.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nWhen Taub began his research in the neurology lab, the prevalent view was that monkeys would not be able to use limbs they could not feel. [[Norman Doidge]] writes that Taub wondered whether the reason the monkeys abandoned use of the deafferented limbs was simply that they were still able to use their good ones. He tested his idea by deafferenting one arm of a monkey and restraining the good arm in a sling. The monkey subsequently used its deafferented arm to feed and move itself around. He reasoned that, if a monkey refused to use a deafferented arm because it could rely on its good arm, then deafferenting both arms would force the monkey to use them, a finding that seemed paradoxical, but which his experiments confirmed. He even deafferented the entire spinal cord, so that the monkey received no sensory input from any of its limbs, but it still used them. Doidge writes that Taub had an epiphany, guessing that the reason the monkeys would not use their deafferented limbs was simply because they had learned not to, an idea he called \"[[learned non-use]].\"<ref>Doidge 2007, pp. 139, 141.</ref>\n\n===Alex Pacheco===\nAlex Pacheco (born 1958) was a graduate student at [[George Washington University]] when he volunteered in May 1981 to work as a research assistant in Taub's lab. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' writes that he was raised in Mexico, the son of a doctor, and wanted to become a priest. He took a tour of a [[slaughterhouse]] in the 1970s and said it changed his life; he read [[Peter Singer]]'s ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' (1975), stopped eating meat, and became an animal rights activist. He worked on the anti-whaling ship, the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]], joined the [[Hunt Saboteurs Association]] in England, and when he returned to the United States to study political science at George Washington, he teamed up with [[Ingrid Newkirk]], a local poundmaster, to form People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in March 1980. The point of taking the research position in Taub's lab was to gain firsthand experience of what happens in animal research laboratories, so he looked through a list of government-funded labs and chose the one nearest his home in [[Takoma Park, Maryland|Takoma Park]].<ref  name=Carlson/> Taub offered him an unpaid position and put him to work with a student, Georgette Yakalis.<ref name=Pacheco />\n\n===The monkeys===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:TwoSilverSpringmonkeys.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Two of the Silver Spring monkeys, photographed inside the Institute by Alex Pacheco]] -->\nInside the Institute for Behavioral Research, Taub was conducting deafferentation experiments on 16 male [[crab-eating macaque]]s (''Macaca fascicularis''),  and one female [[rhesus macaque]] (''Macaca mulatta''), each about 14&nbsp;inches tall, all born wild in the Philippines.  Each monkey lived alone in a wire cage measuring 18&nbsp; x&nbsp;18&nbsp;inches, with no bedding, no food bowl, and no environmental enrichment, the cages kept in a windowless room measuring 15&nbsp;ft square.<ref name=Guillermo13>Guillermo, Kathy Snow.

Sarah, the lone female, was a control subject, which meant she had been left intact. She had been purchased from a dealer, Litton Laboratories, when she was one day old, and had lived since then, for eight years, in the Institute.<ref name=Carlson>Carlson, Peter. \"The Strange Case of the Silver Spring Monkeys,\" ''The Washington Post'' magazine, February 24, 1991.</ref> Paul was the eldest. He had had one arm deafferented. He had chewed off all the fingers on that hand and pulled the skin and flesh off the palm, exposing the bone. Billy had undergone surgery to deafferent both arms, and used his feet to pick up food pellets.<ref name=Guillermo13/>\n\n==Police raid and charges==\n\n===Pacheco's description of the laboratory===\nPacheco wrote that he found the monkeys living in filthy conditions. He found frozen monkey corpses in a refrigerator, and others floating in [[formaldehyde]].<ref name=Carlson/> He alleged that, in the surgery room, human and monkey records were scattered everywhere, including under the operating table, while soiled clothes, old shoes, rat droppings, and urine covered the floor, with [[cockroach]]es in the drawers, on the floor, and around the scrub sink. He said the wires of the cages were caked in filth, with feces piled in the bottom of the cages, and urine and rust on every surface, with the 17 monkeys picking at scraps of food that had fallen through the wire floor of the cages into the waste tray below. He alleged that the cages had not been cleaned for months, that there were no dishes to keep the food away from the feces, and that there was nothing for the monkeys to sit on but the cages' wire bottoms. He wrote that 12 of the monkeys had deafferented limbs, with 39 of their fingers deformed or missing. He described them as neurotic, attacking their deafferented limbs as though they were foreign objects:<ref name=Pacheco/>\n\n{{quote|No one bothered to bandage the monkeys' injuries properly (on the few occasions when bandages were used at all), and antibiotics were administered only once; no lacerations or self-amputation injuries were ever cleaned. Whenever a bandage was applied, it was never changed, no matter how filthy or soiled it became. They were left on until they deteriorated to the point where they fell off the injured limb. Old, rotted fragments of bandage were stuck to the cage floors where they collected urine and feces. The monkeys also suffered from a variety of wounds that were self-inflicted or inflicted by monkeys grabbing at them from adjoining cages. I saw discolored, exposed muscle tissue on their arms. Two monkeys had bones protruding through their flesh. Several had bitten off their own fingers and had festering stubs, which they extended towards me as I discreetly took the fruit from my pockets. With these pitiful limbs they searched through the foul mess of their waste pans for something to eat.<ref name=Pacheco/>}}\n\n===Informal inspections and raid===\nPacheco decided to document the conditions in the lab. He told Taub he wanted to work at night, and took photographs that showed the monkeys' living conditions. He showed them in July to animal rights activists, including [[Cleveland Amory]], who gave him money for a better camera and some [[walkie-talkie]]s, so that a look-out outside could alert him if visitors arrived unexpectedly. He also asked Peter Hamilton of the [[Vancouver]]-based Lifeforce Foundation to assist with the investigation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} In August, Pacheco began inviting veterinarians and scientists into the lab to witness the conditions. According to ''The Washington Post'', Geza Teleki, a primatologist at George Washington University, wrote that he had never seen a lab so poorly maintained, and psychologist Donald Barnes, a former primate researcher, wrote that it was a \"miserable and unhealthful environment for the primates\" and a health hazard for humans. One local veterinarian, Richard Weitzman, agreed that the lab was very dirty, but said the monkeys seemed well fed and \"in pretty good health\".<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nPacheco reported the situation to the [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] police, who raided the laboratory on September 11, 1981 under Maryland's Prevention of Cruelty to Animals law. PETA tipped off the media beforehand, so that the raid was witnessed by several reporters and a camera crew, to the irritation of the police. The officers later testified that the monkeys were living in filthy conditions. Richard Swain, who led the raid, told ''The Washington Post'' in 1991: \"It was absolutely filthy, just incredibly dirty, like nothing I've ever been in. I've executed lots and lots of search warrants. I've worked in murder, in narcotics, in vice, but this was the first time I went into a room and I felt legitimately concerned for my health just being there.\" Taub was charged with 17 counts of animal cruelty and failing to provide adequate veterinary care.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nThe police removed the monkeys from the lab to the basement of a house in [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]] owned by Lori Kenealy of the local humane society. Peter Carlson writes in ''The Washington Post'' that they were given toys, groomed with toothbrushes by the activists, watched 24 hours a day, and allowed to watch daytime soap operas. In the meantime, Taub's lawyers went to court and demanded their return, and ten days after the raid a judge granted the request. And suddenly, Carlson writes, the monkeys disappeared. Kenealy was not at home when it happened, and insisted she knew nothing about it. Richard Swain, who had led the police raid, arrested her and put her in the local jail overnight. PETA was told there could be no legal action against Taub without the monkeys as evidence. Carlson writes that, just as suddenly as they had disappeared, they were returned five days later, this time with Spanish moss in their cages after a holiday in Florida, according to the activists. After another brief stand-off, the monkeys were returned to Taub.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\n===Taub's response===\nTaub said he had been set up. He said his laboratory had been clean when he left on vacation, but that Pacheco had failed to clean the cages, had neglected the animals, then subjected the laboratory to false reports of cruelty. During Taub's vacation that August, which lasted over two weeks, on seven different days in which the animals were supposed to have been fed and the cage area cleaned, the two caretakers failed to show up for work. Taub estimated the probability of seven absences in that 2.5 week period at seven in a trillion based on the previous 14 months of attendance records from the workers. On three of those absentee days, Pacheco brought people in to look at the monkeys.<ref name=Science11dec1981>Holder, Constance. \"Scientist convicted for monkey neglect,\" ''Science'', December 11, 1981, volume 214, pp. 1218\u20131220.</ref> Taub's research assistant, John Kunz, a graduate student, said it was simply that the caretakers took advantage of Taub's absence to have a holiday of their own.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\nDuring the trial in October and November 1981 of Taub and Kunz, Taub told the court\u2014as reported by ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''\u2014that the monkeys had been given \"gentle\" treatment, and had what he called a \"remarkable record of health.\" He acknowledged that they had not been seen by a veterinarian in the previous two years, because he was an expert himself in the treatment of deafferented monkeys. Responding to the images of the monkeys with open sores and decaying bandages, he said that using salves, ointments, and bandages is more dangerous than leaving the conditions untreated; monkeys feel no pain from the deafferented limbs and learn to ignore them, he said, whereas drawing attention to the wounds with salves or bandages would cause the animals to bite or claw at them. Bandages might be necessary where the wounds had grown out of control, or where there was massive infection, and it was sometimes better to let the bandages deteriorate, he said. Taub also testified that some of the photographs Pacheco took had been staged for dramatic effect.<ref name=Ettlin>Ettlin, David Michael.

He said employees had used brooms and mops on the floor, and had emptied the waste trays nearly every day. He said the monkeys had been given fresh fruit twice a week, and that he disagreed with the veterinarians who testified for the prosecution that the female monkey, Sarah, was underweight.<ref name=Ettlin/>\n\n===National Institutes of Health investigation===\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH), which had financed Taub's research, suspended his $115,000 research grant.<ref name=Ettlin/> It initiated its own investigation, and sent the Office for the Protection from Research Risks (OPRR) to assess Taub's lab.

The prosecution said that Taub's lab was filthy and unhealthy, and federal inspection reports and witnesses supported the charge. Taub said the lab was no dirtier than any other, and he also produced federal inspection reports and witnesses to support his position. Veterinarians speaking for the prosecution said Taub's failure to bandage the monkeys' wounds was a threat to their health; veterinarians for the defense, including two who had worked with monkeys whose limbs had been deafferented, said bandaging them would cause the animals to attack the limbs. Carlson writes that the prosecution produced 70 photographs of dirty conditions and injured monkeys, while researchers who had worked in the lab testified for the defense that they had never seen the lab looking like that. The judge\u2014District Court Judge Stanley Klavan\u2014found Taub guilty of six counts of cruelty to animals for failing to provide adequate veterinary care in respect of six of the monkeys, and acquitted him of the other 11 charges against him. He fined Taub $3,000. The laboratory assistant, John Kunz, was acquitted of all 17 charges.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\n===Second trial and appeal (1982 and 1983)===\nTaub managed to secure a second trial in June 1982. After three weeks at the Montgomery County Circuit Court, a jury acquitted him of five of the convictions, and upheld the sixth charge of inadequate veterinary care of Nero, whose wounds were such that an NIH veterinarian later amputated his deafferented arm. Taub was fined $500. The sixth charge was set aside on appeal, when the court ruled that Maryland's Prevention of Cruelty to Animals law did not apply to federally funded laboratories.<ref name=Carlson/>\n\n==Fight for custody==\nAfter the monkeys were returned to Taub's custody, they were transferred to an NIH facility.<ref name=Sideris>{{cite journal | author = Sideris Lisa, McCarthy Charles, Smith David H | year = 1999 | title = Roots of Concern with Nonhuman Animals in Biomedical Ethics | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080603111554/http://dels.nas.edu/ilar_n/ilarjournal/40_1/40_1Roots.shtml | journal = ILAR Journal | volume = 40 | issue = | page = 1 }}</ref> They were later removed to the Tulane Regional Primate Research Center in [[Covington, Louisiana]], still under the care and control of the NIH.<ref>''The Washington Post'', January 5, 1989.</ref> Two primate sanctuaries, Moorpark College in California and Primarily Primates in Texas, offered them a permanent home, but the NIH refused to release them.<ref name=Barnard>Barnard ND et al.

NIH presented the experiments in the lawsuit for custody of the animals in 1989. It proposed to perform deep surgical anesthesia during all procedures followed by euthanasia. After euthanasia, tissue examination would continue.<ref name=Barnard/> The court allowed a group of researchers from the NIH to conduct a terminal experiment on January 14, 1990 on one of the monkeys who had become ill. Under anesthesia, electrodes were placed in his brain and hundreds of recordings taken. The ''Laboratory Primate Newsletter'' said it revealed an \"unprecedented degree of reorganization of the sensory cortex. An 8&ndash;10-millimeter-wide area that would normally receive input from the hand was found to have completely filled in with input from the face.\" Brainmapping studies were conducted on the remaining monkeys on July 6, 1990, three days after PETA's application for custody was rejected.

Incidents that involved only staff who work at the school have been classified as belonging at [[List of rampage killers|List of workplace killings]]. It also excludes events where no injuries take place, if an attack is foiled.\n\nThe listed attacks include [[shooting]]s, [[stabbing]]s, [[Cutting|slashings]], [[bombing]]s, and [[Battery (crime)|beatings]] administered with [[blunt instrument]]s.\n\n==Secondary school incidents==\n\n===1850s===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:65px;\"| Date\n! style=\"width:85px;\"| Location\n! style=\"width:75px;\"| Attacker(s)\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Dead{{r|group=lower-alpha|note_a}}\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Injured{{r|group=lower-alpha|note_a}}\n!

Prior to joining Nazareth, Charlton played in a few bands, most notably the Mark 5 and later the Red Hawks, until joining the local semi-pro Dunfermline band The Shadettes. In 1968, the band changed their name to ''Nazareth'', inspired by the opening lyric from \"[[The Weight]]\", a song by [[The Band]].\n\nCharlton played a huge part in Nazareth's worldwide success. His [[blues music|blues]]y style of playing, combined with [[Dan McCafferty]]'s vocals, first came to the attention of wider rock audiences when Nazareth toured in 1971 as the opening act for [[Deep Purple]]. But by 1973, they were headlining their own shows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abc.eznettools.net/rocknresort/08-nazareth-manny-charlton.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011073709/http://abc.eznettools.net/rocknresort/08-nazareth-manny-charlton.html |archivedate=2008-10-11 }} </ref> Charlton also became the band's [[record producer|producer]] for many years, succeeding Deep Purple's [[Roger Glover]], after the band decided they wanted to move in a new direction for the ''[[Hair of the Dog (album)|Hair of the Dog]]'' album. ''Hair of the Dog'' attained [[music recording sales certification|platinum]] sales in the [[United States]] and has to date sold in excess of two million copies. It is the band's most well known album, and contains their biggest ever hit \"Love Hurts\" which reached No. 8 in the US. Charlton also produced the self-titled ''Dan McCafferty'' debut [[Gramophone record|LP]] around this time.\n\n===''Appetite For Destruction''===\n[[Axl Rose]] of [[Guns N' Roses]] initially wanted \"the producer of Nazareth's Hair of the Dog\"{{citation needed | date=May 2015}} to produce what would become the band's breakthrough album. Manny Charlton subsequently got the request from Geffen Records and did produce several performances recorded at Sound City (LA) on 4 June 1986.  The songs include \"Paradise City\", two versions of \"Move to the City\", \"November Rain\", \"Shadow of your Love\" (takes one and two), and  \"Reckless Life\". However, after the initial work, Nazareth duties were pressing for  Charlton to return to Europe, and Guns N Roses eventually hired Mike Clink to produce the album. Charlton's productions were included as a bonus disc on the 2018 re-issue of ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]''.\n\n===Exit from Nazareth===\nAfter leaving Nazareth in 1990, Charlton played some [[solo (music)|solo]] [[concert|shows]] on the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[nightclub|club]] circuit, and released his first solo album ''Drool'' in 1997, on the Red Steel [[record label]] with Neil Miller on vocals. The following year, he relocated to [[Texas]], where he formed the [[Manny Charlton Band]] (MCB). The new band released a pair of albums &ndash; ''Stonkin'' and ''Klone This'' &ndash; before disbanding in 2003.\n\n===''Doom''===\nIn 1995, Charlton sent to [[id Software]], creator of ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', a cassette tape featuring an untitled song that [[John Romero]] would later title \"Blood on the Walls\". The liner said, \"For all the guys and gals at I.D. (sic) who came up with the coolest game this side of hell, kick some demon butt to this!!\" It also said \"distribute as [[shareware]]\", in keeping with the old days of PC gaming in which one could get the first third or fourth of the game for free or a reduced price, and buy the full game later.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Romero would later find this tape and record it to mp3, providing it for free on his website. The song is actually titled \"Doom\" from Charlton's album ''Drool''.\n\n===Recent work===\nIn 2004, Charlton released ''Say The Word'' on the Scottish label River Records. 2005 saw the release of ''Sharp'', which is on the whole a [[cover version|covers]] album, including [[Tim Hardin]]'s \"Hang On To A Dream\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"Shelter From The Storm\". Later that year, Charlton completed the follow-up to ''Sharp'', titled  ''Sharp Re-Loaded''. \n\nIn early 2006, Charlton joined the Swedish rock band, From Behind, who released their debut album titled ''Game Over'', and toured in support of the album around [[Europe]] before disbanding in late 2007. Charlton then released a solo album ''Americana Deluxe'', covering songs such as [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s \"Tusk\".\n\nIn March 2013, Charlton released ''Hellacious''.<ref name=\"Hellacious, cdbaby\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/mannycharltonband1|title=\u266b Hellacious - The Manny Charlton Band|website=Cdbaby.com|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref> co-produced by Gary Bryant (GB Records). This recording was made in California and featured  \n[[Tim Bogert]], [[Walfredo Reyes, Jr.]], [[Steven Adler]], [[Vivian Campbell]] and Robyn DeLarenzo.\n\nIn 2014, Charlton's solo albums ''Sharp'' and ''Sharp Re-Loaded'' were issued as a double CD.  Neil Jefferies of ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' commended Charlton's production work, writing: \"Among three Dylan songs tackled, All Along The Watchtower is simply stunning, sidestepping both the original and Hendrix\u2019s seminal version with quasi-reggae tones that cement Charlton\u2019s reputation as a truly gifted arranger.\"\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Nazareth discography}}\n<!-- DO NOT ADD DETAILS TO THIS LIST - Edit separate Nazareth discography article instead! -->\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* ''[[Nazareth (album)|Nazareth]]'' (1971)\n* ''[[Exercises (album)|Exercises]]'' (1972)\n* ''[[Razamanaz]]'' (1973)\n* ''[[Loud 'n' Proud]]'' (1973)\n* ''[[Rampant (album)|Rampant]]'' (1974)\n* ''[[Hair of the Dog (album)|Hair of the Dog]]'' (1975)\n* ''[[Close Enough for Rock 'n' Roll]]'' (1976)\n* ''[[Play 'n' the Game]]'' (1976)\n* ''[[Expect No Mercy]]'' (1977)\n* ''[[No Mean City (album)|No Mean City]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Malice in Wonderland (Nazareth album)|Malice in Wonderland]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[The Fool Circle]]'' (1981)\n* ''[[2XS]]'' (1982)\n* ''[[Sound Elixir]]'' (1983)\n* ''[[The Catch (album)|The Catch]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Cinema (Nazareth album)|Cinema]]'' (1986)\n* ''[[Snakes 'n' Ladders]]'' (1989)\n}}\n\n===Solo===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* ''Manny Charlton - Drool'' (1999)\n* ''Manny Charlton - Bravado'' (2000)\n* ''Manny Charlton Band \u2013 Stonkin\u2019'' (2002)\n* ''Manny Charlton Band \u2013 Klone This'' (2003)\n* ''Manny Charlton \u2013 Say The Word'' (2004)\n* ''Manny Charlton - Sharp'' (2004)\n* ''Manny Charlton \u2013 Sharp Re-Loaded'' (2005)\n* ''From Behind \u2013 Game Over'' (2006)\n* ''Manny Charlton \u2013 Americana Deluxe'' (2007)\n* ''Manny Charlton \u2013 Then There\u2019s This'' (2008)\n* ''Manny Charlton Band - Hellacious'' (2013)\n* ''Manny Charlton - Sharp / Sharp Re-Loaded (2CD Reissue)'' (2014)\n* ''Manny Charlton - Solo'' (2016)\n}}\n\n===Singles===\n\n* \"Manny Charlton Band - It Does Something\" (2012)\n\n===ROIO===\n\n* ''Nazareth with Manny Charlton \u2013 Rock \u2018N\u2019 Roll Resort (Live)'' (2008)\n\n===Contributions===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* ''Marseille \u2013 Red, White and Slightly Blue'' (1977)\n* ''Guns N Roses \u2013 Appetite For Destruction'' (1986) - pre-production\n* ''Jingo De Lunch \u2013 B.Y.E'' (1992) \n* ''Various Artists \u2013 A Tribute To Led Zeppelin'' (2008)\n* ''Robin DeLorenzo \u2013 Walkin' Miles in My Shoes'' (2014)\n* ''The Fluffy Jackets \u2013 Fighting Demons'' (2014) \n* ''The Mighty Mojos \u2013 Mojo Rising (EP)'' (2015)\n* ''Billy Craig \u2013 Another Lazy Day'' (2015)\n* ''[[Salem (UK band)|Salem (UK)]] - Tank on the album Dark Days'' (2016)\n* ''The Fluffy Jackets feat.
