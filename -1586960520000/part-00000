In some areas the suppression of [[wildfire|forest fires]] for hundreds of years has resulted in large single aged and single species [[stand level modelling|forest stands]]. The logging of small clear cuts and/or prescribed burning actually increases the biodiversity in these areas by creating a greater variety of tree stand ages and species.\n\n== For harvesting ==\n{{see also|Harvesting}}\nReforestation need not be only used for recovery of accidentally destroyed forests. In some countries, such as [[Finland]], many of the forests are ''managed'' by the wood products and [[pulp and paper industry]]. In such an arrangement, like other crops, trees are planted to replace those that have been cut. In such circumstances, the industry can cut the trees in a way to allow easier reforestation. The wood products industry systematically replaces many of the trees it cuts, employing large numbers of summer workers for [[tree planting]] work. For example, in 2010, [[Weyerhaeuser]] reported planting 50 million seedlings.<ref>{{Cite web  | title = Sustainable Forest Management  | work = Key Timberland Statistics  | publisher = Weyerhaeuser  | date = 10 June 2011  | url = http://www.weyerhaeuser.com/Sustainability/Planet/SustainableForestManagement  | accessdate = 7 January 2012  | url-status = dead  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111229213132/http://www.weyerhaeuser.com/Sustainability/Planet/SustainableForestManagement  | archivedate = 29 December 2011  }}</ref> However replanting an [[old-growth forest]] with a [[plantation]] is [[Plantation#Natural forest loss|not replacing the old with the same]] characteristics in the new.\n\nIn just 20 years, a [[teak]] plantation in [[Costa Rica]] can produce up to about 400 m\u00b3 of wood per hectare. As the natural teak forests of Asia become more scarce or difficult to obtain, the prices commanded by plantation-grown teak grows higher every year. Other species such as [[mahogany]] grow more slowly than teak in Tropical America but are also extremely valuable. Faster growers include [[pine]], [[eucalyptus]], and ''[[Gmelina arborea|Gmelina]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Forest plantation yields in the tropical and subtropical zone|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x8423e/X8423E08.htm|work=Forestry Department|accessdate=15 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nReforestation, if several [[Native plant|indigenous species]] are used, can provide other benefits in addition to financial returns, including [[Soil regeneration|restoration of the soil]], rejuvenation of local flora and fauna, and the capturing and sequestering of 38 [[ton]]s of [[carbon dioxide]] per [[hectare]] per year.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe reestablishment of forests is not just simple tree planting. Forests are made up of a [[Plant community|community of species]] and they build [[humus|dead organic matter]] into soils over time.

Even without displacing [[agriculture]] and cities, earth can sustain almost one billion hectares of new forests. This would remove 25% of [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere and reduce its concentration to levels that existed in the early twentieth century. A temperature rise of 1.5 degrees would reduce the area suitable for forests by 20% by the year 2050, because some tropical areas will become too hot.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The countries that have the most forest-ready land are: [[Russia]], [[Canada]], [[Brazil]], [[Australia]], [[United States]] and [[China]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe four major strategies are: increase the amount of forested land through reforestation; increase density of existing forests at a stand and landscape scale; expand the use of forest products that sustainably replace fossil-fuel emissions; and reduce carbon emissions caused by deforestation and degradation.<ref name=\"Canadell\"/>{{rp|1456}}\n\nImplementing the first strategy is supported by many organizations around the world. For example, in China, the [[Jane Goodall Institute]], through their Shanghai [[Roots & Shoots]] division, launched the Million Tree Project in Kulun Qi, [[Inner Mongolia]] to plant one million trees.<ref name=\"Shanghai Roots & Shoots\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jgi-shanghai.org|title=Shanghai Roots & Shoots -|work=jgi-shanghai.org|access-date=2019-10-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224030000/http://www.jgi-shanghai.org/|archive-date=2017-02-24|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"The Million Tree Project\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtpchina.org|title=Million Tree Project :: Home|work=mtpchina.org}}</ref> China used 2.4 billion hectares of new forest to offset 21% of Chinese fossil fuel emissions in 2000.<ref name=\"Canadell\"/>{{rp|1456}} In [[Java, Indonesia]] newlywed couples give whoever is conducting their wedding 5 seedlings.

In theory, planting any kind of tree to produce more forest cover would absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, a [[genetically modified]] variant might grow much faster than unmodified specimens.<ref name=\"Economist\">{{Cite journal | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | title = A changing climate of opinion? | journal = The Economist  | volume = 387 | issue =  | pages = 93\u201396 | year = 2008 | url = http://www.economist.com/help/DisplayHelp.cfm?folder=663377 | accessdate = 2010-08-29}}</ref>{{rp|93}} Some of these cultivars are under development. Such fast-growing trees would be planted for harvest and can absorb carbon dioxide faster than slower-growing trees.<ref name=\"Economist\"/>{{rp|93}}\n\nImpacts on temperature are affected by the location of the forest. For example, reforestation in boreal or [[subarctic]] regions has less impact on climate. This is because it substitutes a high-[[albedo]], snow-dominated region with a lower-albedo forest canopy. By contrast, tropical reforestation projects lead to a positive change such as the formation of [[clouds]]. These clouds then [[albedo|reflect the sunlight]], lowering temperatures.<ref name=\"Canadell\"/>{{rp|1457}}\n\nPlanting trees in [[tropical climate]]s with [[wet season]]s has another advantage. In such a setting, trees grow more quickly (fixing more carbon) because they can grow year-round. Trees in tropical climates have, on average, larger, brighter, and more abundant leaves than non-tropical climates. A study of the [[:wikt:girth|girth]] of 70,000 trees across [[Africa]] has shown that tropical forests fix more carbon dioxide pollution than previously realized. The research suggested almost one fifth of fossil fuel emissions are absorbed by forests across [[Africa]], [[Amazonia]] and [[Asia]]. Simon Lewis stated, \"Tropical forest trees are absorbing about 18% of the carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere each year from burning fossil fuels, substantially buffering the rate of change.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/feb/18/trees-tropics-climate-change | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Fifth of world carbon emissions soaked up by extra forest growth, scientists find | first=David | last=Adam | date=2009-02-18 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2008 1.3 billion hectares of tropical regions were deforested every year. Reducing this would reduce the amount of planting needed to achieve a given degree of mitigation.<ref name=\"Canadell\"/>{{rp|1456}}\n\n== Incentives ==\n{{update section|date=October 2019}}\nSome incentives for reforestation can be as simple as a financial compensation. Streck and Scholz (2006) explain how a group of scientists from various institutions have developed a compensated reduction of deforestation approach which would reward developing countries that disrupt any further act of deforestation. Countries that participate and take the option to reduce their emissions from deforestation during a committed period of time would receive financial compensation for the carbon dioxide emissions that they avoided.<ref name=\"Streck\">{{Cite journal | last = Streck | first = C. |author2=S.M.

The funds received by the country could be invested to help find alternatives to the extensive cutdown of forests. This whole process of cutting emissions would be voluntary, but once the country has agreed to lower their emissions they would be obligated to reduce their emissions. However, if a country was not able to meet their obligation, their target would get added to their next commitment period.

The country is now one of the leaders of [[sustainability]], [[biodiversity]], and other protections. It wants to be completely fossil fuel free by 2050. The country has generated all of its electric power from renewable sources for three years as of 2019. It has committed to be carbon-free and plastic-free by 2021.\n\nAs of 2019, half of the country's land surface is covered with forests. They absorb a huge amount of [[carbon dioxide]], combating climate change.\n\nIn the 1940s, more than 75% of the country was covered in mostly tropical rainforests and other indigenous woodlands. Between the 1940s and 1980s extensive, uncontrolled [[logging]] led to severe deforestation. By 1983, only 26% of the country had forest cover. Realizing the devastation, policymakers took a stand. Through a continued environmental focus they were able to turn things around to the point that today forest cover has increased to 52%, 2 times more than 1983 levels.\n\nAn honorable world leader for [[ecotourism]] and conservation, Costa Rica has pioneered the development of payments for [[environmental services]].  Costa Rica's extensive system of environmental protection has been encouraging conservation and reforestation of the land by providing grants for environmental services. The system is not just advanced for its time but is also unparalleled in the world. It received great international attention.\n\nThe country has established programs to compensate landowners for reforestation. These payments are funded through international donations and nationwide taxes. The initiative is helping to protect the forests in the country.\n\n\"Robert Blasiak, a research fellow at the University of Tokyo, said: \"Taking a closer look at what Costa Rica has accomplished in the past 30 years may be just the impetus needed to spur real change on a global scale.\"\n\n\"Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado has called the climate crisis \"the greatest task of our generation\"; one that his country is strongly committed to excel in.<ref name=\"intelligentliving.co\"/>\"\n\n=== Canada ===\nNatural Resources Canada (The Department of Natural Resources) states that the national forest cover was decreased by 0.34% from 1990 to 2015, and Canada has the lowest deforestation rate in the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indicator: Forest area |url=https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/forests/report/area/16397 |website=Natural Resources Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |accessdate=7 September 2018|date=August 2014 }}</ref> The forest industry is one of the main industries in Canada which contributes about 7% of Canadian economy,<ref>{{cite web |title=How does the forest industry contribute to the economy? |url=https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/forests/report/economy/16517 |website=Natural Resources Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |accessdate=7 September 2018|date=2014-08-26 }}</ref> and about 9% of the forests on earth are in Canada.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sustainable forest management in Canada |url=https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/forests/canada/sustainable-forest-management/13183 |website=Natural Resources Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |accessdate=7 September 2018|date=2013-04-16 }}</ref> Therefore, Canada has many policies and laws to commit to sustainable forest management.

Sometimes the term \"re-afforestation\" is used to distinguish between the [[old growth forest|original forest cover]] and the later re-growth of forest to an area. Special tools, e.g. [[tree planting bar]]s, are used to make planting of trees easier and faster.\n\nAnother alternative strategy, [[proforestation]], is similar as it can be used to counteract the negative environmental and ecological effects of deforestation through growing an existing forest intact to its full ecological potential.\n\n== Criticisms ==\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2014}}\nReforestation competes with other land uses, such as food production, livestock grazing and living space, for further economic growth. Reforestation often has the tendency to create large fuel loads, resulting in significantly hotter combustion than fires involving low brush or grasses.  Reforestation can divert large amounts of water from other activities.  Reforesting sometimes results in extensive canopy creation that prevents growth of diverse vegetation in the shadowed areas and generating soil conditions that hamper other types of vegetation. Trees used in some reforesting efforts (e.g., ''[[Eucalyptus globulus]]'') tend to extract large amounts of moisture from the soil, preventing the growth of other plants.\n\nThere is also the risk that, through a [[wildfire|forest fire]] or [[Forest pathology|insect outbreak]], much of the stored carbon in a reforested area could make its way back to the atmosphere.<ref name=\"Canadell\"/>{{rp|1456}} Reduced harvesting rates and fire suppression have caused an increase in the forest biomass in the western United States over the past century.

In some areas the suppression of [[wildfire|forest fires]] for hundreds of years has resulted in large single aged and single species [[stand level modelling|forest stands]]. The logging of small clear cuts and/or prescribed burning actually increases the biodiversity in these areas by creating a greater variety of tree stand ages and species.\n\n== For harvesting ==\n{{see also|Harvesting}}\nReforestation need not be only used for recovery of accidentally destroyed forests. In some countries, such as [[Finland]], many of the forests are ''managed'' by the wood products and [[pulp and paper industry]]. In such an arrangement, like other crops, trees are planted to replace those that have been cut. In such circumstances, the industry can cut the trees in a way to allow easier reforestation. The wood products industry systematically replaces many of the trees it cuts, employing large numbers of summer workers for [[tree planting]] work. For example, in 2010, [[Weyerhaeuser]] reported planting 50 million seedlings.<ref>{{Cite web  | title = Sustainable Forest Management  | work = Key Timberland Statistics  | publisher = Weyerhaeuser  | date = 10 June 2011  | url = http://www.weyerhaeuser.com/Sustainability/Planet/SustainableForestManagement  | accessdate = 7 January 2012  | url-status = dead  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111229213132/http://www.weyerhaeuser.com/Sustainability/Planet/SustainableForestManagement  | archivedate = 29 December 2011  }}</ref> However replanting an [[old-growth forest]] with a [[plantation]] is [[Plantation#Natural forest loss|not replacing the old with the same]] characteristics in the new.\n\nIn just 20 years, a [[teak]] plantation in [[Costa Rica]] can produce up to about 400 m\u00b3 of wood per hectare. As the natural teak forests of Asia become more scarce or difficult to obtain, the prices commanded by plantation-grown teak grows higher every year. Other species such as [[mahogany]] grow more slowly than teak in Tropical America but are also extremely valuable. Faster growers include [[pine]], [[eucalyptus]], and ''[[Gmelina arborea|Gmelina]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Forest plantation yields in the tropical and subtropical zone|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x8423e/X8423E08.htm|work=Forestry Department|accessdate=15 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nReforestation, if several [[Native plant|indigenous species]] are used, can provide other benefits in addition to financial returns, including [[Soil regeneration|restoration of the soil]], rejuvenation of local flora and fauna, and the capturing and sequestering of 38 [[ton]]s of [[carbon dioxide]] per [[hectare]] per year.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe reestablishment of forests is not just simple tree planting.

Even without displacing [[agriculture]] and cities, earth can sustain almost one billion hectares of new forests. This would remove 25% of [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere and reduce its concentration to levels that existed in the early twentieth century. A temperature rise of 1.5 degrees would reduce the area suitable for forests by 20% by the year 2050, because some tropical areas will become too hot.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The countries that have the most forest-ready land are: [[Russia]], [[Canada]], [[Brazil]], [[Australia]], [[United States]] and [[China]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe four major strategies are: increase the amount of forested land through reforestation; increase density of existing forests at a stand and landscape scale; expand the use of forest products that sustainably replace fossil-fuel emissions; and reduce carbon emissions caused by deforestation and degradation.<ref name=\"Canadell\"/>{{rp|1456}}\n\nImplementing the first strategy is supported by many organizations around the world. For example, in China, the [[Jane Goodall Institute]], through their Shanghai [[Roots & Shoots]] division, launched the Million Tree Project in Kulun Qi, [[Inner Mongolia]] to plant one million trees.<ref name=\"Shanghai Roots & Shoots\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jgi-shanghai.org|title=Shanghai Roots & Shoots -|work=jgi-shanghai.org|access-date=2019-10-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224030000/http://www.jgi-shanghai.org/|archive-date=2017-02-24|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"The Million Tree Project\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtpchina.org|title=Million Tree Project :: Home|work=mtpchina.org}}</ref> China used 2.4 billion hectares of new forest to offset 21% of Chinese fossil fuel emissions in 2000.<ref name=\"Canadell\"/>{{rp|1456}} In [[Java, Indonesia]] newlywed couples give whoever is conducting their wedding 5 seedlings.

In theory, planting any kind of tree to produce more forest cover would absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, a [[genetically modified]] variant might grow much faster than unmodified specimens.<ref name=\"Economist\">{{Cite journal | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | title = A changing climate of opinion? | journal = The Economist  | volume = 387 | issue =  | pages = 93\u201396 | year = 2008 | url = http://www.economist.com/help/DisplayHelp.cfm?folder=663377 | accessdate = 2010-08-29}}</ref>{{rp|93}} Some of these cultivars are under development. Such fast-growing trees would be planted for harvest and can absorb carbon dioxide faster than slower-growing trees.<ref name=\"Economist\"/>{{rp|93}}\n\nImpacts on temperature are affected by the location of the forest. For example, reforestation in boreal or [[subarctic]] regions has less impact on climate. This is because it substitutes a high-[[albedo]], snow-dominated region with a lower-albedo forest canopy. By contrast, tropical reforestation projects lead to a positive change such as the formation of [[clouds]]. These clouds then [[albedo|reflect the sunlight]], lowering temperatures.<ref name=\"Canadell\"/>{{rp|1457}}\n\nPlanting trees in [[tropical climate]]s with [[wet season]]s has another advantage. In such a setting, trees grow more quickly (fixing more carbon) because they can grow year-round. Trees in tropical climates have, on average, larger, brighter, and more abundant leaves than non-tropical climates. A study of the [[:wikt:girth|girth]] of 70,000 trees across [[Africa]] has shown that tropical forests fix more carbon dioxide pollution than previously realized. The research suggested almost one fifth of fossil fuel emissions are absorbed by forests across [[Africa]], [[Amazonia]] and [[Asia]]. Simon Lewis stated, \"Tropical forest trees are absorbing about 18% of the carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere each year from burning fossil fuels, substantially buffering the rate of change.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/feb/18/trees-tropics-climate-change | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Fifth of world carbon emissions soaked up by extra forest growth, scientists find | first=David | last=Adam | date=2009-02-18 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2008 1.3 billion hectares of tropical regions were deforested every year. Reducing this would reduce the amount of planting needed to achieve a given degree of mitigation.<ref name=\"Canadell\"/>{{rp|1456}}\n\n== Incentives ==\n{{update section|date=October 2019}}\nSome incentives for reforestation can be as simple as a financial compensation. Streck and Scholz (2006) explain how a group of scientists from various institutions have developed a compensated reduction of deforestation approach which would reward developing countries that disrupt any further act of deforestation. Countries that participate and take the option to reduce their emissions from deforestation during a committed period of time would receive financial compensation for the carbon dioxide emissions that they avoided.<ref name=\"Streck\">{{Cite journal | last = Streck | first = C. |author2=S.M.

The funds received by the country could be invested to help find alternatives to the extensive cutdown of forests. This whole process of cutting emissions would be voluntary, but once the country has agreed to lower their emissions they would be obligated to reduce their emissions. However, if a country was not able to meet their obligation, their target would get added to their next commitment period. The authors of these proposals see this as a solely government-to-government agreement; private entities would not participate in the compensation trades.<ref name=\"Streck\"/>{{rp|876}}\n\n== Implementation ==\n\n[[File:Regrowth - Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.JPG|thumb|left|Forest regrowth in [[Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest]], Washington state, USA]]\n\n=== Global ===\n[[Trillion Tree Campaign]] is an initiative aiming to plant 1 trillion trees across the globe.

The country is now one of the leaders of [[sustainability]], [[biodiversity]], and other protections. It wants to be completely fossil fuel free by 2050. The country has generated all of its electric power from renewable sources for three years as of 2019. It has committed to be carbon-free and plastic-free by 2021.\n\nAs of 2019, half of the country's land surface is covered with forests. They absorb a huge amount of [[carbon dioxide]], combating climate change.\n\nIn the 1940s, more than 75% of the country was covered in mostly tropical rainforests and other indigenous woodlands. Between the 1940s and 1980s extensive, uncontrolled [[logging]] led to severe deforestation. By 1983, only 26% of the country had forest cover. Realizing the devastation, policymakers took a stand. Through a continued environmental focus they were able to turn things around to the point that today forest cover has increased to 52%, 2 times more than 1983 levels.\n\nAn honorable world leader for [[ecotourism]] and conservation, Costa Rica has pioneered the development of payments for [[environmental services]].  Costa Rica's extensive system of environmental protection has been encouraging conservation and reforestation of the land by providing grants for environmental services. The system is not just advanced for its time but is also unparalleled in the world. It received great international attention.\n\nThe country has established programs to compensate landowners for reforestation. These payments are funded through international donations and nationwide taxes. The initiative is helping to protect the forests in the country.\n\n\"Robert Blasiak, a research fellow at the University of Tokyo, said: \"Taking a closer look at what Costa Rica has accomplished in the past 30 years may be just the impetus needed to spur real change on a global scale.\"\n\n\"Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado has called the climate crisis \"the greatest task of our generation\"; one that his country is strongly committed to excel in.<ref name=\"intelligentliving.co\"/>\"\n\n=== Canada ===\nNatural Resources Canada (The Department of Natural Resources) states that the national forest cover was decreased by 0.34% from 1990 to 2015, and Canada has the lowest deforestation rate in the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indicator: Forest area |url=https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/forests/report/area/16397 |website=Natural Resources Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |accessdate=7 September 2018|date=August 2014 }}</ref> The forest industry is one of the main industries in Canada which contributes about 7% of Canadian economy,<ref>{{cite web |title=How does the forest industry contribute to the economy? |url=https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/forests/report/economy/16517 |website=Natural Resources Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |accessdate=7 September 2018|date=2014-08-26 }}</ref> and about 9% of the forests on earth are in Canada.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sustainable forest management in Canada |url=https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/forests/canada/sustainable-forest-management/13183 |website=Natural Resources Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |accessdate=7 September 2018|date=2013-04-16 }}</ref> Therefore, Canada has many policies and laws to commit to sustainable forest management.

It is funded by [[Arbor Day Foundation]].\n\n==Related concepts==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2019}}\nA similar concept, [[afforestation]], refers to the process of restoring and recreating areas of [[woodland]]s or [[forest]]s that may have existed long ago but were [[deforestation|deforested]] or otherwise removed at some point in the past or lacked it naturally (e.g., natural [[grassland]]s). Sometimes the term \"re-afforestation\" is used to distinguish between the [[old growth forest|original forest cover]] and the later re-growth of forest to an area. Special tools, e.g. [[tree planting bar]]s, are used to make planting of trees easier and faster.\n\nAnother alternative strategy, [[proforestation]], is similar as it can be used to counteract the negative environmental and ecological effects of deforestation through growing an existing forest intact to its full ecological potential.\n\n== Criticisms ==\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2014}}\nReforestation competes with other land uses, such as food production, livestock grazing and living space, for further economic growth. Reforestation often has the tendency to create large fuel loads, resulting in significantly hotter combustion than fires involving low brush or grasses.  Reforestation can divert large amounts of water from other activities.  Reforesting sometimes results in extensive canopy creation that prevents growth of diverse vegetation in the shadowed areas and generating soil conditions that hamper other types of vegetation. Trees used in some reforesting efforts (e.g., ''[[Eucalyptus globulus]]'') tend to extract large amounts of moisture from the soil, preventing the growth of other plants.\n\nThere is also the risk that, through a [[wildfire|forest fire]] or [[Forest pathology|insect outbreak]], much of the stored carbon in a reforested area could make its way back to the atmosphere.<ref name=\"Canadell\"/>{{rp|1456}} Reduced harvesting rates and fire suppression have caused an increase in the forest biomass in the western United States over the past century. This causes an increase of about a factor of four in the frequency of fires due to longer and hotter dry seasons.<ref name=\"Canadell\"/>{{rp|1456}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[10,000 Trees for the Rouge Valley]], a reforestation program in Toronto, Canada\n* [[Aerial reforestation]]\n* [[Agricultural robot]]s\n* [[Ecosia]]\n* [[Forest gardening]]\n* [[Forest restoration]]\n* [[Forestry]]\n* [[Hemp]]\n* [[Narsarsuaq#Arboretum Groenlandicum|Greenland Arboretum]]\n* [[Hoedads Reforestation Cooperative]]\n* [[Jewish National Fund]]\n* [[Land rehabilitation]]\n* [[Natural landscape]]\n* [[One Earth Climate Model]]\n* [[Plant A Tree Today Foundation]]\n* [[Pottiputki]]\n* [[Restoration ecology]]\n* [[Revegetation]]\n* [[Rewilding (conservation biology)]]\n* [[Richard St. Barbe Baker]]\n* [[Seed ball#Aerial seeding deployment methods|Drone-based reforestation]]\n* ''[[The Man Who Planted Trees]]''\n* [[Tree credits]]\n* [[Tree planting]]\n* [[Tubestock]]\n* [[Deforestation and climate change]]\n* [[Wood economy]]\n* [[Proforestation]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n*{{cite web  \n |work=Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat report)\n |title=Turkish Greenhouse Gas Inventory report \n |date=April 2019\n |url=https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/tur-2019-nir-13apr19.zip\n }}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1155121 | last1 = Bonan | first1 = G.
