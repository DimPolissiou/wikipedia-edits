While all speedruns aim for quick completion, some speedruns are characterized by additional goals or limitations that players subject themselves to, such as collecting all key items or playing blindfolded. Players speedrun mainly to challenge themselves, to entertain and to compete with themselves and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.speedrunslive.com/faq/|website=Speedrunslive| title = Speedrunslive FAQ}}</ref>\n\nPlayers performing speedruns, called speedrunners, often record their attempts. These recordings are used to entertain others, to verify the completion time, to certify that all rules were followed, and to spot ways to further improve the completion time.{{refn|group=Note |name=DemoFormat|Although many speedruns are released as video recordings, which are often preferred due to being more universal,  some communities use a game's native demo recordings (such as the <tt>DEM</tt> format in by ''Quake'') since these are much more compact and easier to share with others. Such recordings require specific software to view, usually a version of the original game. Some communities release speedruns in both formats so that they become accessible to a larger audience.}}\n\nTo achieve a high level of play, speedrunners often have to reason about the game differently from the way that ordinary players might. Speedruns usually follow [[gameplay]] routes that are planned out carefully before they are attempted. Many games have opportunities to disarrange the intended sequence of events and skip entire parts of it \u2014 often called [[sequence breaking]] \u2014 and many more have programming mistakes, or [[glitch]]es, that a skillful player can exploit to their advantage. [[Tool-assisted speedrun]]ning is a type of speedrunning in which various computer tools are used to obtain performances which would be near-impossible for a human player, and are not held in competition with speedruns done by human players in real time, known as real-time speedruns.\n\nSome games are considered to be particularly suited to speedrunning and have [[virtual community|online communities]] dedicated to them, which can provide an active platform for discussing, publishing, and improving speedruns. Speedruns can be viewed on a variety of platforms, including [[Streaming media|live streams]] where players can carry out and share their attempts in real-time. Although speedrunning was originally not a widespread phenomenon, it has since grown to involve several active websites and an increasingly expansive assortment of speedrun videos that are freely and widely circulated on the Internet.\n\n== Common occurrences ==\n=== Sequence breaking ===\n{{main|Sequence breaking}}\nWhile routing, it becomes apparent that some of the goals in the game do not need to be achieved for completion. Such elements include [[cutscene]]s that need to be watched before the player can progress, items that the player needs to possess in order to continue to a next stage or even entire parts of the gameplay that may convey a part of the game's plot or a subplot. Skipping a part of the game in such a fashion that it can be described as disjointed with the game's intended/common sequence of events is referred to as ''sequence breaking''.\n\nThe term ''sequence break'' was first used in 2003 in an online [[Internet forum|discussion forum]] thread concerning the [[GameCube|Nintendo GameCube]] game ''[[Metroid Prime]]''.{{refn|group=Note |name=OldMetroidTopics|Metroid 2002, a major Metroid speedrunning website, has retained back-ups of these topics that can be found at <tt>[http://www.metroid2002.com/home.php http://www.metroid2002.com/home.php]</tt>. See [[Speedrun#Metroid 2002 (Metroid series)|section \"Metroid 2002 (Metroid series)\"]] for more information on Metroid 2002.}} The original thread was called \"Gravity Suit and Ice Beam before Thardus\"; since then, the \"''x'' before ''y''\" notation has become common in the nomenclature of speedrunning. Thardus, a fictional creature in the [[Metroid|''Metroid'' series]], was designed to be a mandatory [[Boss (gaming)|boss]] before the Gravity Suit and Ice Beam could be obtained, hence the novelty of bypassing the boss while still obtaining the items. Since its initial discovery, sequence breaking has become an integral part of speedrunning and has been applied to many other games.\n\nA specific way to do sequence breaking in a specific game is usually called a skip, and well-known skips are known in their communities under names that easily identify it.\n\n=== Glitch usage ===\n[[Image:Sm64 mips.png|thumb|Usage of a [[Speedrun#Glitches|glitch]] in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' to pass through a wall, performing a sequence break.]]\n[[Glitch|Glitches]] are often used in order to achieve sequence breaks; an example of this can be found in the \"16 Star\" run of ''[[Super Mario 64]]''. In this game, [[Mario]] normally needs to collect at least 70 of the 120 power stars before he is allowed to challenge [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], the final boss, but a glitch makes it possible to access the final level with only 16 stars. With the right kind of movement, it is possible to pass through the boundary of a wall by pushing into it while holding onto MIPS, an [[Non-player character|NPC]] rabbit,<ref name=\"SuperMario6416Star\">{{cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://speeddemosarchive.com/Mario64.html | title = Super Mario 64 | publisher = [[Speed Demos Archive]] | accessdate =March 25, 2006}}</ref> then exploit a trick known as \"backwards long-jumping\" to bypass the 70 star door. Since then, similar tricks have been found to complete the game without collecting any stars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/9/17549444/super-mario-64-speedrun-world-record-0-star|title=One of Super Mario 64's toughest speedrun records has been broken|last=Frank|first=Allegra|date=2018-07-09|website=Polygon|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref> Glitches can also be used for purposes outside of sequence breaking, such as achieving otherwise impossible speeds,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2015/05/half-life-2-world-record-speedrun-will-make-your-head-spin/|title=Half-Life 2 World Record Speedrun Will Make Your Head Spin|date=2015-05-06|website=Kotaku Australia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/inside-the-wild-speedrunning-community-of-16-year-old-spongebob-battle-for-bikini-bottom/|title=Inside the wild speedrunning community of 16-year-old SpongeBob: Battle for Bikini Bottom|last=Winkie|first=Luke|date=2019-09-25|website=PC Gamer|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> and duplicating resources.\n\nWhile some speedrun rules require that the skipping of such events be avoided, it is often desirable to make full use of such possibilities. Therefore, some websites, such as Speeddemosarchive,<ref name=\"speeddemosarchive.com\">{{cite web|url=http://speeddemosarchive.com/lang/rules_en.html|title=Speed Demos Archive - Rules|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022020158/http://speeddemosarchive.com/lang/rules_en.html|archivedate=October 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> offer support for multiple speedrun categories. Each category specifies which glitches are permitted and what game objectives must be completed. For example, it is typically agreed that glitches arising from outside the game, such as improperly inserting the [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]], are impermissible. Removing or altering a game disc/cartridge/files while the game is running is forbidden. Examples of this are the crooked cartridge trick in [[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]] and the CD streaming trick in [[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]].<ref>{{cite web|title=ZeldaSpeedRuns Leaderboard Rules|url=http://zeldaspeedruns.com/leaderboards/rules|website=ZeldaSpeedRuns|access-date=September 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916220003/http://zeldaspeedruns.com/leaderboards/rules|archive-date=September 16, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Tool-assistance ==\n{{main|Tool-assisted speedrun}}\nAlthough most speedruns assume normal human play of a game, ''[[tool-assisted speedrun]]s'' (abbreviated ''TAS'') allow authors to use outside tools to aid their playing. For example, utilizing the [[Saved game#Save states|save state]] function of an [[Video game console emulator|emulator]] to go back in time and revise mistakes (known as ''re-recording''), or using software to read [[Variable (computer science)|variables]] directly from the game's memory, giving the player information not normally available to them. The result is that human limitations, such as skill and reflex, are no longer a barrier in the creation of a run; tool-assisted runs have (sometimes significantly) lower completion times than their unassisted equivalents.<ref name=\"WhyAndHow\">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://tasvideos.org/WhyAndHow.html | title = Why And How | publisher = TASVideos | author = TASVideos contributors | accessdate =March 27, 2006}}</ref>\n\n== Completion ==\nSpeedruns are categorized into various levels of completion, or how thoroughly a game is completed, which are as follows:\n\n*'''Any%''', or fastest completion, refers to completing the game as quickly as possible, and often involves sequence breaking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/23/17494370/summer-games-done-quick-2018-where-to-watch-schedule-preview|title=Summer Games Done Quick 2018: everything you need to know about the first day|last=Good|first=Owen S.|date=2018-06-23|website=Polygon|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref> \n*'''100%''', or full completion, requires the player to complete the game to its fullest. This often includes collecting all key items or upgrades, finding all secret features, or anything else that may be deemed important. Specific requirements for a 100% speedrun are different depending on the game.<ref name=\"forum.speeddemosarchive.com\">{{cite web|url=https://forum.speeddemosarchive.com/post/low100_definitions.html|title=low%/100% definitions|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2016}}</ref> Some games, such as ''[[Super Metroid]]'', have a percentage counter and therefore have an easy definition for 100%.<ref>{{cite web|title=sweetnumb's SM 100% Item Advanced Tutorial with WildAnaconda69|url=https://www.twitch.tv/sweetnumb/v/44379421|website=Twitch}}</ref> Others do not, and instead the game's community decides what the definition for 100% should be.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.speedrunslive.com/faq/glossary/|title=SpeedRunsLive Speedrunning Glossary|last=|first=|date=|website=SpeedRunsLive|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615224214/http://www.speedrunslive.com/faq/glossary/|archive-date=June 15, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> Any% and 100% are the most common categories for speedrunning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@CeltThulu/speedrunning-a-primer-for-beginners-by-a-beginner-76d1f2bdc|title=Speedrunning \u2014 A Primer For Beginners, By a Beginner|last=Steele|first=Brian|date=November 15, 2015|website=Medium|access-date=July 5, 2018}}</ref>\n*'''Low%''', or minimalist completion, requires the player to complete the game by obtaining the fewest key items or upgrades possible. If the fastest way to complete the game already involves the player picking up the fewest key items or upgrades, a low% category may not exist for that game's speedruns.<ref name=\"speeddemosarchive.com\"/> As with 100% runs, low% speedruns have requirements that vary between games.<ref name=\"forum.speeddemosarchive.com\"/>\n\nIn addition, there can be game-specific categories that change how much of the game must be completed. These categories usually include completing or avoiding specific aspects of the game and/or not allowing certain glitches or game exploits to be used in the run. An example of this would be the medallions/stones/trials category in ''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time''; this category requires the runner to beat all major levels in the game and restricts some of the glitches that can be performed. In ''[[Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!|Donkey Kong Country 3]]'', there is a \"Water%\" run, which constitutes collecting every DK Coin in the game; this requires the player to collect every Bear Coin to access the Lost World, but does not require a player to actually 100% the game and ignore the Banana Birds.<ref name=\"DKCspeedruns\">{{cite web|url=https://dkcspeedruns.com/Leaderboards#DKC3_-_Water.25|title=water% definition|accessdate=June 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|Randomizer}}\nA '''randomizer''' is a type of [[game mod]] that has been used in speedrunning, wherein software is used to shuffle the locations of elements (such as items) to provide an additional challenge. Popular games used for randomizer runs have included ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'' and ''[[Super Metroid]]'', while a notable mod combines both games\u2014with special doorways transitioning the player between them, and items from both games scattered within their respective environments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/how-randomizers-are-breathing-new-life-into-old-games/|title=How \u201crandomizers\u201d are breathing new life into old games|last=Staff|first=Ars|date=2019-12-03|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, speedruns have been performed by members of [[Virtual community|online communities]] pertaining to video games in general. When the activity became popular enough to accede to [[subculture]], the first sites dedicated to speedrunning started appearing\u2014usually specializing in just one or a few games. Some of these sites have sustained activity for a long time, sometimes even up to today, providing coverage of its members' achievements and serving as a platform for related discussions.\n\n=== COMPET-N (Doom) ===\nDecember 1993 saw the release of [[id Software]]'s ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', which allowed players to record demo files of their playthrough. The feature was first picked up by Christina \"Strunoph\" Norman in January 1994 when she launched the ''LMP Hall of Fame'' website.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\">{{cite web|url=https://www.doomworld.com/10years/demos/demos01.php|title=A Brief DOOM Demo History|author=Merrill, D.|year=2003|website=|publisher=Doomworld|accessdate=October 16, 2005}}</ref>\n\nThis site was, however, quickly followed up by the ''DOOM Honorific Titles'' (also known as the \"DHT\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/dht/dht6.html|title=Doom Honorific Titles|last=|first=|date=|website=Doom Honorific Titles|accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref> launched in May 1994 by Frank Stajano, which introduced the first serious competition between players.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3142599&did=1|title=Smashing the Clock|author=Turner, B.|year=2005|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=August 13, 2005}}</ref> This site, designed around a notion of earning titles by successfully recording a particular type of demo on one of the predetermined maps in the \"[[Doom WAD|IWADs]]\", would create the basis for all ''Doom'' demo sites that would follow.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> These so-called \"exams\" became very popular as the player had to earn each title by submitting a demo of the feat to one of the site's judges to justify his application. ''[[Doom II|Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'' was released in October 1994,<ref name=\"Origins\">{{cite web|url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1994|title=1994 - Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design, List of Winners|accessdate=2009-06-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080614193353/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1994 |archivedate = June 14, 2008}}</ref> and the DHT conformed to the new additions as well as the new ''Doom'' version releases. At the height of its popularity, the DHT had many different categories and playing styles.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> For example, playing with only the in-game fists and pistol, while killing all monsters on a map, became known as \"Tyson\" mode, named after the heavyweight boxer and former champion [[Mike Tyson]]. \"Pacifist mode\" was playing without intentionally harming any monsters. Each category had \"easy\", \"medium\", and \"hard\" difficulty maps for players to get randomly chosen for. As an authentication method to prevent players from submitting demos made by other people, it was required that they performed a distinct \"dance\" during their demo (often at the very beginning). With such varied categories, the DHT was appealing to a diverse group of players.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> However, the DHT had trouble retaining a permanent Internet location. This, combined with the constantly changing rules and the diminished importance of most of the titles, caused public interest to wane as the years went by.\n\nIn November 1994, the definitive installment ''Doom'' speedrunning scene, in the form of the COMPET-N website, was launched.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> Its creator, Simon Widlake, intended the site to be a record scoreboard for a variety of ''Doom''-related achievements, but unlike its predecessors, they were all based on the idea of fast completion, thus making it the first actual speedrunning site. Players were challenged to run through ''Doom''<nowiki/>'s levels as fast as humanly possible in order to attain a spot on the constantly updated COMPET-N scoreboards, leading to demo material gradually amounting to hundreds of hours of recorded gameplay.<ref name=\"DoomStats\">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | title = COMPET-N Database | publisher = Doom2.net | accessdate = October 28, 2016 | archivedate = April 12, 2014 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140412062105/http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLike the DOOM Honorific Titles, this site experienced multiple location changes over time; it was hosted on the ''[[Simtel]]'' servers for a while, before Istvan Pataki took over as maintainer and moved the site to a now defunct [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server of the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics|Technical University of Budapest]]. From there on, since early 1998, it had been administered by Adam Hegyi, who was maintaining the site, but left around 2007 without notice. In 2012, COMPET-N player Zvonimir 'fx' Bu\u017eani\u0107 took over maintaining the site and re-created new database for WAD-s and PWAD-s. It is currently located at [http://www.doom.com.hr/compet-n COMPET-N | news].\n\nAs of November 2007, COMPET-N contained a total amount of 6072 demos (on both official and custom maps), accounting for a total time of 462 hours, 8 minutes and 20 seconds.<ref name=\"DoomStats\"/> As of January 2012, COMPET-N contains a total amount of 9122 demos (on both official and custom maps), accounting for a total time of 749 hours, 41 minutes and 47 seconds.\n\n=== SpeedRunsLive.com ===\nIn 2009, [http://www.speedrunslive.com/ SpeedRunsLive.com] was created by Narcissa Wright and Daniel 'Jiano' Hart<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.speedrunslive.com/about/|title=About SpeedRunsLive|website=www.speedrunslive.com|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> as a way for speedrunners to showcase speedrunning races in real time with a set goal consisting of various possible categories.

As is the case for the rest of the games in the series, highly [[nonlinear gameplay]] makes it possible for runners to search extensively for different routes towards the end of the game. In particular, the ability to perform sequence breaking has been researched thoroughly, leading to the discovery of ways to complete the games while obtaining only a small percentage of items. Prior to the inception of Metroid speedrunning, there were special websites which documented these so-called \"low-percentage\" completion possibilities.\n\nThe first game to be exceedingly popular with the speedrunning audience was ''[[Super Metroid]]'', released in 1994, which proved to lend itself to fast completion purposes very well.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\"/> It featured a physics system that allowed for a wide array of skills for mobility, like \"wall jumping\" or the \"Shinespark\", allowing players to skip over large areas of the game, or play through the game in different manners based on how well they can perform these tricks in contextual situations. Additionally, it had the same nonlinear gameplay as its predecessors. Due to the way the game was laid out, several different run types or tiers that incorporate different completion percentages have been performed,{{refn|group=Note |name=TierFooter|A \"tier\", in this context, is a certain time-related goal that determines the strategy or route used in a speedrun.

Players first started recording these special demos when Andy \"Aurican\" Kempling released a modified version of the ''Doom'' [[source code]] that made it possible to record demos in slow motion and in several sessions. A couple of months afterwards, in June 1999, the first site made for the purpose of sharing these demos, aptly called \"Tools-Assisted Speedruns\", was opened by Esko Koskimaa, Peo Sjoblom, and Yonatan Donner.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/>{{refn|group=Note |name=ToolsAssistedSpeedrun|Doom tool-assisted speedrunning is sometimes referred to as \"tools-assisted speedrunning\", after the first site used to share these demos.

It was even feared that this fact would cause the downfall of competitive speedrunning.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\"/> Neither the Speed Demos Archive nor Metroid 2002 have ever published runs that were known to be made with a special emulator.

Their runs are streamed live at [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], and runners often provide commentary throughout the run to give viewers a better understanding of what is going on. Runners who are speedrunning often practice their game in a practice room at the event before their scheduled run as a warm up, or they practice at home beforehand.

While all speedruns aim for quick completion, some speedruns are characterized by additional goals or limitations that players subject themselves to, such as collecting all key items or playing blindfolded. Players speedrun mainly to challenge themselves, to entertain and to compete with themselves and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.speedrunslive.com/faq/|website=Speedrunslive| title = Speedrunslive FAQ}}</ref>\n\nPlayers performing speedruns, called speedrunners, often record their attempts. These recordings are used to entertain others, to verify the completion time, to certify that all rules were followed, and to spot ways to further improve the completion time.{{refn|group=Note |name=DemoFormat|Although many speedruns are released as video recordings, which are often preferred due to being more universal,  some communities use a game's native demo recordings (such as the <tt>DEM</tt> format in by ''Quake'') since these are much more compact and easier to share with others. Such recordings require specific software to view, usually a version of the original game. Some communities release speedruns in both formats so that they become accessible to a larger audience.}}\n\nTo achieve a high level of play, speedrunners often have to reason about the game differently from the way that ordinary players might. Speedruns usually follow [[gameplay]] routes that are planned out carefully before they are attempted. Many games have opportunities to disarrange the intended sequence of events and skip entire parts of it \u2014 often called [[sequence breaking]] \u2014 and many more have programming mistakes, or [[glitch]]es, that a skillful player can exploit to their advantage. [[Tool-assisted speedrun]]ning is a type of speedrunning in which various computer tools are used to obtain performances which would be near-impossible for a human player, and are not held in competition with speedruns done by human players in real time, known as real-time speedruns.\n\nSome games are considered to be particularly suited to speedrunning and have [[virtual community|online communities]] dedicated to them, which can provide an active platform for discussing, publishing, and improving speedruns. Speedruns can be viewed on a variety of platforms, including [[Streaming media|live streams]] where players can carry out and share their attempts in real-time. Although speedrunning was originally not a widespread phenomenon, it has since grown to involve several active websites and an increasingly expansive assortment of speedrun videos that are freely and widely circulated on the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.speedrun.com/|title=Speedrun.com|last=|first=|date=|website=Speedrun.com|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SpeedRunsLive|url=http://www.speedrunslive.com/|website=SpeedRunsLive}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SpeedDemosArchive|url=http://speeddemosarchive.com/|website=SpeedDemosArchive}}</ref><ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\">{{cite web | year = 2005 | url =  http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3142599&did=1 | title = Smashing the Clock | publisher = [[1UP.com]] | author = Turner, B. | accessdate =August 13, 2005}}</ref><ref name=\"GamersDividedMTV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1528811/20060417/index.jhtml|title=Gamers Divided Over Freakish Feats Achieved With Tool-Assisted Speed Runs|last=Totilo|first=Stephen|year=2006|website=|publisher=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=April 11, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Common occurrences ==\n=== Sequence breaking ===\n{{main|Sequence breaking}}\nWhile routing, it becomes apparent that some of the goals in the game do not need to be achieved for completion. Such elements include [[cutscene]]s that need to be watched before the player can progress, items that the player needs to possess in order to continue to a next stage or even entire parts of the gameplay that may convey a part of the game's plot or a subplot. Skipping a part of the game in such a fashion that it can be described as disjointed with the game's intended/common sequence of events is referred to as ''sequence breaking''.\n\nThe term ''sequence break'' was first used in 2003 in an online [[Internet forum|discussion forum]] thread concerning the [[GameCube|Nintendo GameCube]] game ''[[Metroid Prime]]''.{{refn|group=Note |name=OldMetroidTopics|Metroid 2002, a major Metroid speedrunning website, has retained back-ups of these topics that can be found at <tt>[http://www.metroid2002.com/home.php http://www.metroid2002.com/home.php]</tt>. See [[Speedrun#Metroid 2002 (Metroid series)|section \"Metroid 2002 (Metroid series)\"]] for more information on Metroid 2002.}} The original thread was called \"Gravity Suit and Ice Beam before Thardus\"; since then, the \"''x'' before ''y''\" notation has become common in the nomenclature of speedrunning. Thardus, a fictional creature in the [[Metroid|''Metroid'' series]], was designed to be a mandatory [[Boss (gaming)|boss]] before the Gravity Suit and Ice Beam could be obtained, hence the novelty of bypassing the boss while still obtaining the items. Since its initial discovery, sequence breaking has become an integral part of speedrunning and has been applied to many other games.\n\nA specific way to do sequence breaking in a specific game is usually called a skip, and well-known skips are known in their communities under names that easily identify it.\n\n=== Glitch usage ===\n[[Image:Sm64 mips.png|thumb|Usage of a [[Speedrun#Glitches|glitch]] in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' to pass through a wall, performing a sequence break.]]\n[[Glitch|Glitches]] are often used in order to achieve sequence breaks; an example of this can be found in the \"16 Star\" run of ''[[Super Mario 64]]''. In this game, [[Mario]] normally needs to collect at least 70 of the 120 power stars before he is allowed to challenge [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], the final boss, but a glitch makes it possible to access the final level with only 16 stars. With the right kind of movement, it is possible to pass through the boundary of a wall by pushing into it while holding onto MIPS, an [[Non-player character|NPC]] rabbit,<ref name=\"SuperMario6416Star\">{{cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://speeddemosarchive.com/Mario64.html | title = Super Mario 64 | publisher = [[Speed Demos Archive]] | accessdate =March 25, 2006}}</ref> then exploit a trick known as \"backwards long-jumping\" to bypass the 70 star door. Since then, similar tricks have been found to complete the game without collecting any stars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/9/17549444/super-mario-64-speedrun-world-record-0-star|title=One of Super Mario 64's toughest speedrun records has been broken|last=Frank|first=Allegra|date=2018-07-09|website=Polygon|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref> Glitches can also be used for purposes outside of sequence breaking, such as achieving otherwise impossible speeds,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2015/05/half-life-2-world-record-speedrun-will-make-your-head-spin/|title=Half-Life 2 World Record Speedrun Will Make Your Head Spin|date=2015-05-06|website=Kotaku Australia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/inside-the-wild-speedrunning-community-of-16-year-old-spongebob-battle-for-bikini-bottom/|title=Inside the wild speedrunning community of 16-year-old SpongeBob: Battle for Bikini Bottom|last=Winkie|first=Luke|date=2019-09-25|website=PC Gamer|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> and duplicating resources.\n\nWhile some speedrun rules require that the skipping of such events be avoided, it is often desirable to make full use of such possibilities.

Each category specifies which glitches are permitted and what game objectives must be completed. For example, it is typically agreed that glitches arising from outside the game, such as improperly inserting the [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]], are impermissible. Removing or altering a game disc/cartridge/files while the game is running is forbidden.

For example, utilizing the [[Saved game#Save states|save state]] function of an [[Video game console emulator|emulator]] to go back in time and revise mistakes (known as ''re-recording''), or using software to read [[Variable (computer science)|variables]] directly from the game's memory, giving the player information not normally available to them. The result is that human limitations, such as skill and reflex, are no longer a barrier in the creation of a run; tool-assisted runs have (sometimes significantly) lower completion times than their unassisted equivalents.<ref name=\"WhyAndHow\">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://tasvideos.org/WhyAndHow.html | title = Why And How | publisher = TASVideos | author = TASVideos contributors | accessdate =March 27, 2006}}</ref>\n\n== Completion ==\nSpeedruns are categorized into various levels of completion, or how thoroughly a game is completed, which are as follows:\n\n*'''Any%''', or fastest completion, refers to completing the game as quickly as possible, and often involves sequence breaking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/23/17494370/summer-games-done-quick-2018-where-to-watch-schedule-preview|title=Summer Games Done Quick 2018: everything you need to know about the first day|last=Good|first=Owen S.|date=2018-06-23|website=Polygon|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref> \n*'''100%''', or full completion, requires the player to complete the game to its fullest. This often includes collecting all key items or upgrades, finding all secret features, or anything else that may be deemed important. Specific requirements for a 100% speedrun are different depending on the game.<ref name=\"forum.speeddemosarchive.com\">{{cite web|url=https://forum.speeddemosarchive.com/post/low100_definitions.html|title=low%/100% definitions|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2016}}</ref> Some games, such as ''[[Super Metroid]]'', have a percentage counter and therefore have an easy definition for 100%.<ref>{{cite web|title=sweetnumb's SM 100% Item Advanced Tutorial with WildAnaconda69|url=https://www.twitch.tv/sweetnumb/v/44379421|website=Twitch}}</ref> Others do not, and instead the game's community decides what the definition for 100% should be.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.speedrunslive.com/faq/glossary/|title=SpeedRunsLive Speedrunning Glossary|last=|first=|date=|website=SpeedRunsLive|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615224214/http://www.speedrunslive.com/faq/glossary/|archive-date=June 15, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> Any% and 100% are the most common categories for speedrunning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@CeltThulu/speedrunning-a-primer-for-beginners-by-a-beginner-76d1f2bdc|title=Speedrunning \u2014 A Primer For Beginners, By a Beginner|last=Steele|first=Brian|date=November 15, 2015|website=Medium|access-date=July 5, 2018}}</ref>\n*'''Low%''', or minimalist completion, requires the player to complete the game by obtaining the fewest key items or upgrades possible. If the fastest way to complete the game already involves the player picking up the fewest key items or upgrades, a low% category may not exist for that game's speedruns.<ref name=\"speeddemosarchive.com\"/> As with 100% runs, low% speedruns have requirements that vary between games.<ref name=\"forum.speeddemosarchive.com\"/>\n\nIn addition, there can be game-specific categories that change how much of the game must be completed. These categories usually include completing or avoiding specific aspects of the game and/or not allowing certain glitches or game exploits to be used in the run. An example of this would be the medallions/stones/trials category in ''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time''; this category requires the runner to beat all major levels in the game and restricts some of the glitches that can be performed. In ''[[Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!|Donkey Kong Country 3]]'', there is a \"Water%\" run, which constitutes collecting every DK Coin in the game; this requires the player to collect every Bear Coin to access the Lost World, but does not require a player to actually 100% the game and ignore the Banana Birds.<ref name=\"DKCspeedruns\">{{cite web|url=https://dkcspeedruns.com/Leaderboards#DKC3_-_Water.25|title=water% definition|accessdate=June 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|Randomizer}}\nA '''randomizer''' is a type of [[game mod]] that has been used in speedrunning, wherein software is used to shuffle the locations of elements (such as items) to provide an additional challenge. Popular games used for randomizer runs have included ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'' and ''[[Super Metroid]]'', while a notable mod combines both games\u2014with special doorways transitioning the player between them, and items from both games scattered within their respective environments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/how-randomizers-are-breathing-new-life-into-old-games/|title=How \u201crandomizers\u201d are breathing new life into old games|last=Staff|first=Ars|date=2019-12-03|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, speedruns have been performed by members of [[Virtual community|online communities]] pertaining to video games in general. When the activity became popular enough to accede to [[subculture]], the first sites dedicated to speedrunning started appearing\u2014usually specializing in just one or a few games. Some of these sites have sustained activity for a long time, sometimes even up to today, providing coverage of its members' achievements and serving as a platform for related discussions.\n\n=== COMPET-N (Doom) ===\nDecember 1993 saw the release of [[id Software]]'s ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', which allowed players to record demo files of their playthrough. The feature was first picked up by Christina \"Strunoph\" Norman in January 1994 when she launched the ''LMP Hall of Fame'' website.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\">{{cite web|url=https://www.doomworld.com/10years/demos/demos01.php|title=A Brief DOOM Demo History|author=Merrill, D.|year=2003|website=|publisher=Doomworld|accessdate=October 16, 2005}}</ref>\n\nThis site was, however, quickly followed up by the ''DOOM Honorific Titles'' (also known as the \"DHT\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/dht/dht6.html|title=Doom Honorific Titles|last=|first=|date=|website=Doom Honorific Titles|accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref> launched in May 1994 by Frank Stajano, which introduced the first serious competition between players.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\"/> This site, designed around a notion of earning titles by successfully recording a particular type of demo on one of the predetermined maps in the \"[[Doom WAD|IWADs]]\", would create the basis for all ''Doom'' demo sites that would follow.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> These so-called \"exams\" became very popular as the player had to earn each title by submitting a demo of the feat to one of the site's judges to justify his application. ''[[Doom II|Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'' was released in October 1994,<ref name=\"Origins\">{{cite web|url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1994|title=1994 - Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design, List of Winners|accessdate=2009-06-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080614193353/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1994 |archivedate = June 14, 2008}}</ref> and the DHT conformed to the new additions as well as the new ''Doom'' version releases. At the height of its popularity, the DHT had many different categories and playing styles.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> For example, playing with only the in-game fists and pistol, while killing all monsters on a map, became known as \"Tyson\" mode, named after the heavyweight boxer and former champion [[Mike Tyson]]. \"Pacifist mode\" was playing without intentionally harming any monsters. Each category had \"easy\", \"medium\", and \"hard\" difficulty maps for players to get randomly chosen for. As an authentication method to prevent players from submitting demos made by other people, it was required that they performed a distinct \"dance\" during their demo (often at the very beginning). With such varied categories, the DHT was appealing to a diverse group of players.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> However, the DHT had trouble retaining a permanent Internet location. This, combined with the constantly changing rules and the diminished importance of most of the titles, caused public interest to wane as the years went by.\n\nIn November 1994, the definitive installment ''Doom'' speedrunning scene, in the form of the COMPET-N website, was launched.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> Its creator, Simon Widlake, intended the site to be a record scoreboard for a variety of ''Doom''-related achievements, but unlike its predecessors, they were all based on the idea of fast completion, thus making it the first actual speedrunning site. Players were challenged to run through ''Doom''<nowiki/>'s levels as fast as humanly possible in order to attain a spot on the constantly updated COMPET-N scoreboards, leading to demo material gradually amounting to hundreds of hours of recorded gameplay.<ref name=\"DoomStats\">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | title = COMPET-N Database | publisher = Doom2.net | accessdate = October 28, 2016 | archivedate = April 12, 2014 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140412062105/http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLike the DOOM Honorific Titles, this site experienced multiple location changes over time; it was hosted on the ''[[Simtel]]'' servers for a while, before Istvan Pataki took over as maintainer and moved the site to a now defunct [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server of the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics|Technical University of Budapest]].

Not all of those newcomers agreed with the standard that runs should be made on the hardest possible difficulty level.

As is the case for the rest of the games in the series, highly [[nonlinear gameplay]] makes it possible for runners to search extensively for different routes towards the end of the game. In particular, the ability to perform sequence breaking has been researched thoroughly, leading to the discovery of ways to complete the games while obtaining only a small percentage of items. Prior to the inception of Metroid speedrunning, there were special websites which documented these so-called \"low-percentage\" completion possibilities.\n\nThe first game to be exceedingly popular with the speedrunning audience was ''[[Super Metroid]]'', released in 1994, which proved to lend itself to fast completion purposes very well.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\"/> It featured a physics system that allowed for a wide array of skills for mobility, like \"wall jumping\" or the \"Shinespark\", allowing players to skip over large areas of the game, or play through the game in different manners based on how well they can perform these tricks in contextual situations. Additionally, it had the same nonlinear gameplay as its predecessors. Due to the way the game was laid out, several different run types or tiers that incorporate different completion percentages have been performed,{{refn|group=Note |name=TierFooter|A \"tier\", in this context, is a certain time-related goal that determines the strategy or route used in a speedrun. For example, a low-percentage speedrun is in a different tier than an any-percentage speedrun, as both have different completion goals.}} including any%, 100%, low%, and reverse boss order (RBO), in which the player beats the game's bosses in the opposite order they were meant to be played via sequence breaking.\n\nAs the Internet became more available to the general public, groups of players started collaborating on [[Internet forum|message boards]] to discuss these tricks with one another in what became a community based on playing the games speedily.\n\nThe first ''Metroid'' community that was created for the purpose of fast completion was ''Metroid Prime Discoveries'', created and led by Jean-Sebastien \"Zell\" Dubois.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://membres.lycos.fr/zellmetroid/|title=Lycos.com|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410072328/http://membres.lycos.fr/zellmetroid/|archivedate=April 10, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Rather than being a site that focused on speedrunning, it was dedicated to documenting the possibilities of sequence breaking in the game ''[[Metroid Prime]]''.

Players first started recording these special demos when Andy \"Aurican\" Kempling released a modified version of the ''Doom'' [[source code]] that made it possible to record demos in slow motion and in several sessions.

Although it was widely believed that the video was made by an extremely skilled player, it was actually the first tool-assisted speedrun made with a special emulator to generate widespread interest.{{refn|group=Note |name=EarlyTASVideos|There is evidence that several tool-assisted speedrun videos had been made before then, including a few others by Morimoto himself, but the Super Mario Bros. 3 video was the first to become popular with a general audience.}} When Morimoto detailed the making of the run on his website,<ref name=\"MorimotoExplanation\">{{cite web | year = 2003 | url = http://soramimi.egoism.jp/emu.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031203222907/http://soramimi.egoism.jp/emu.htm | archivedate = December 3, 2003 | title = emu | publisher = Internet Archive | author = \u3082\u308a\u3082\u3068 | accessdate =December 3, 2003}}</ref> many felt deceived and turned to criticizing the video's \"illegitimacy\" instead. The knowledge that the video was constructed through tedious and careful selective replaying also raised some questions about the authenticity of video game replays; after all, if it is practically impossible to tell the videos of both kinds apart, one cannot possibly know whether a run was made with or without the use of a special emulator. It was even feared that this fact would cause the downfall of competitive speedrunning.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\"/> Neither the Speed Demos Archive nor Metroid 2002 have ever published runs that were known to be made with a special emulator. Nolan Pflug, the former [[webmaster]] of Speed Demos Archive, has been quoted as saying, \"My basic thought is 'don't like them, haven't made them, don't watch them,'\" when asked for his opinion on the subject.<ref name=\"GamersDividedMTV\"/>\n\nThus, in late 2003, the first public website that served tool-assisted speedrun videos from multiple authors, TASVideos (then known as NESVideos), was created.<ref>{{cite web|title=NESVideos - Backup|url=http://bisqwit.iki.fi/jutut/backup-nesvideos.html|website=Nintendo Entertainment System \"superplay\" videos}}</ref> It was originally created by Joel \"Bisqwit\" Yliluoma for the purpose of showcasing, sharing, and discussing speedruns made with special emulators\u2014at first, the site only held videos of [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] games, in part due to the fact that the only emulator suitable for this specialist purpose was, at that time, the Famtasia NES emulator.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Besides just serving the speedrun recordings in the emulator's original format (which, much like ''Doom'' and ''Quake'' demos, required both the emulator and the game in order to be played back), the site also held <tt>AVI</tt> files, which were made available using the [[BitTorrent|BitTorrent protocol]]. <!-- add info about site's growth-->As of March 2016, it holds over 3,000 complete speedruns.<ref name=\"TASMovieList\">{{cite web |url=http://tasvideos.org/ListAllMovies.html |title= List All Movies |work=tasvideos.org |accessdate=March 25, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===Speedrun.com===\n\nIn March 2014, [https://www.speedrun.com/ speedrun.com] was launched.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/23/super-mario-64-speedrun-record-cheese05-puncayshun-interview/|title=The life of an elite 'Super Mario 64' speedrunner|website=Engadget|language=en|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref> On the website, speedrunners can customize speedrunning leaderboards for video games and submit video proof of their runs.

This often takes the form of a [[fan convention]] where runners get together to speedrun video games to raise money for charity, but may also be a purely online event. The most popular speedrun marathons are the biannual [[Games Done Quick]] marathon in the United States. Before the marathons, discussions take place on a forum, and runners submit their game choices. An online schedule is created that will show who is speedrunning, when they are speedrunning, and what game they are speedrunning. Their runs are streamed live at [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], and runners often provide commentary throughout the run to give viewers a better understanding of what is going on. Runners who are speedrunning often practice their game in a practice room at the event before their scheduled run as a warm up, or they practice at home beforehand. Speedrun marathons such as the Awesome Games Done Quick 2017 marathon have raised $2,222,934.52 for the [[Prevent Cancer Foundation]].<ref name=\"gdq2016total\">{{cite web|url=https://gamesdonequick.com/tracker/donations/agdq2017|title=Donation Index|last=|first=|date=|website=Games Done Quick 2017|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Competitive speedrunning ==\nThe first ever competitive speedrunning tournament was organized by the Global Speedrunning Association called PACE.

It was founded on May 3, 1852 as the United States as the National Typographical Union, and changed its name to the International Typographical Union at its [[Albany, New York]] convention in 1869 after it began organizing members in Canada. The ITU was one of the first unions to admit female members, admitting women members such as Augusta Lewis, Mary Moore and Eva Howard in 1869.\n\nTypographers were educated, [[economic mobility|economically mobile]], in every major urban center with newspapers, and had the unique possibility to influence publicity in favour of their cause. This led the union to the forefront of improving working conditions. ITU President W. B. Prescott led the ITU in 1897 to win a 48-hour work week and a standard wage scale for all printers. During the [[Great Depression]], the ITU introduced the [[40-hour work week]] across the industry at no cost to employers as a way to share the fewer jobs available. That ITU initiative spread to other unions and has since been codified across the labor sector by federal legislation in the U.S. establishing the 40-hour work week.\n\nThe ITU had a unique system of factional opposition in its [[democratic election]]s, documented by [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] in his co-authored book ''[[Union Democracy: The Internal Politics of the International Typographical Union]]'' (1957).<ref>S. M. Lipset, ''[[Union Democracy: The Internal Politics of the International Typographical Union]]'' (1957)</ref> The local scale committees worked for a decent wage while the executive council sent ITU representatives to assist local unions in contract negotiations. All contracts had to be approved and ratified by both the Executive Council and the newspaper publisher. For most of its history, the ITU benefited from friendly and strong competition between Independents and Progressives for control of the union.\n\nAs the work of [[typographer]]s declined with automation, computers and mechanization of the print media, the ITU was disbanded. In 1986, a majority of ITU [[mailer (occupation)|mailers]] voted to merge with the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] and the remaining typographers joined the [[Communications Workers of America]]. Before its dissolution, the ITU was the oldest union in the United States.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation===\nThe concept for a typographical union was formed at a New York City meeting of 18 representatives from typographers' associations in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Kentucky in December 1850. A committee led by John Keyser of Philadelphia was formed to investigate issues and propose a plan of action.\n\nThe representatives met again in Baltimore in September 1851. While they resolved to form a national union, no other actions were taken.\n\nFinally, delegates from typographers' unions in 14 cities met in [[Cincinnati]] in May 1852 and organized the National Typographical Union. A random drawing enabled the Indianapolis local to become Local Union #1 and the new headquarters. In 1869, a new Constitution was adopted, accepting the affiliation of Canadian printing trade unions and changing the name to the International Typographical Union. In 1873, at Montreal, Canada, the first ITU convention outside the United States was held. ''The ITU Book of Laws'' would be amended many times, yet it was as members called it \"ITU Law.\" Each union shop was a \"[[Local union|Chapel]]\" and the shop steward was the \"Chapel Chairman\". All apprentices and journeymen had to have working cards showing paid union dues. ITU Law dictated that [[Union dues|dues]], which were proportionate to the amount of work done in the chapel, had to be paid by the first Tuesday after the last Saturday of the month. If the Union dues were not paid, the member was not allowed to work until their payment.\n\n===Fragmentation===\n[[File:IBoB group photo.png|thumb|The International Brotherhood of Bookbinders in [[Salt Lake City]], Utah in 1908]]\nTechnological developments in the late 19th century such as the development of [[lithography]] and photography led to diversification and specialization among printers. Further fragmentation in the printing labor movement led to the establishment of the International Printing Pressmen Union of North America (IPPU), in 1889. In 1892, the ITU authorized membership for mailers and for newspaper writers. Pressure mounted for a separate pressman's union, and in 1892 the International Brotherhood of Bookbinders (IBB) was formed. Many pressmen left the ITU for the Bookbinders. At the same time as mailers joined, two thousand pressmen members seceded to form the International Printing Pressmen Union Assistants, (IPPUA) in 1897 and the International Stereotypers' and Electroplaters' Union, (IS&EU) in 1902. At the start of the 20th Century, ITU membership was primarily compositors and mailers.\n\nIn 1894, the Louisville convention sought to have president W. B. Prescott examine ways to have newer technology under the ITU. Then, the ITU chartered a [[Photoengraving|photoengraver]]s' union in New York City. Over the next few years, the ITU organized photoengravers in several other cities as well. However, many photoengravers felt that the leaders of the ITU were indifferent to their needs.\n\nIn 1899, photoengravers in New York City went on strike to demand a 48-hour work week. ITU President S. B. Donnelly refused to support the local, fearing employers might retaliate. The New York City photoengravers won their strike, but the lack of ITU support led most of the union's photoengraver locals to seek disaffiliation. A national convention in Philadelphia in November 1900 saw the photoengravers leaving the ITU and establishing the International Photo-Engravers' Union of North America. ITU President James M. Lynch, pressured the AFL into refusing to recognize the photoengravers' union until May 1904.\n\nIn 1893, the ITU struck [[Harrison Gray Otis (publisher)|Harrison Gray Otis]]'s ''[[Los Angeles Times]].'' In 1896, the union began a [[boycott]] that ran until 1908. In 1903, ITU President James M. Lynch, persuaded [[William Randolph Hearst]] to start a rival paper, the ''Los Angeles Examiner''.\n\nOn October 1, 1910, James B. Mc Namara, an ITU member and his brother. Joseph J. Mc Namara, secretary-treasurer of the International Union of Bridge and Structural Iron Workers placed [[Los Angeles Times bombing|a bomb in the ''L.A. Times'' building]], killing 21 people. Famed attorney [[Clarence Darrow]] defended the brothers. They were convicted of the bombing and murder. Despite various job actions that lasted into the 1920s, the ''L.A. Times'' remained a non-union shop. This was a major defeat for both the ITU and other trade unions; Los Angeles and Southern California would be lost to trade unions except in the case of the entertainment industry.\n\n===AFL===\nAs early as 1879, the International Typographical Union was in the forefront of organized labor. The ITU was instrumental in the formation of the [[Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions]] in 1882. In the same time frame, the ITU rejected the [[Knights of Labor]]. In the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) presidential election of 1881, William H. Foster of the ITU defeated Samuel Gompers. In 1886, the [[Cigar Makers' International Union|Cigar Makers' Union]] leader, [[Samuel Gompers]], was elected AFL president. The ITU was the largest and strongest union in the AFL. By the end of the 19th century, ITU President S. B. Donnelly called the ITU the \"strongest and most stable printing union in the United States\". In 1924, [[William Green (U.S. labor leader)|William Green]] would succeed Gompers as AFL president. The seeds of discord between the AFL and ITU were sown.\n\n===Fight for better working conditions===\n[[File:International Typographical Union exhibit, Forestry Building, Alaska-Yukon-Pacific-Exposition, Seattle, Washington, 1909 (AYP 1107).jpeg|thumb|left|International Typographical Union exhibit at the [[Alaska\u2013Yukon\u2013Pacific Exposition]], Seattle, 1909]]\nFrom October 1891, the ITU Mortuary Benefits were the most respected in trade unionism.\n\nIn 1906, ITU President James M. Lynch decided to use strong tactics and initiated strikes in most major cities, attempting to secure an [[eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]]. The union had lost a fight for a nine-hour day a few years earlier; however, this time, the union spent over US$4 million supporting its striking locals. Not only did the ITU win an eight-hour work day, but the ITU strike paved the way for similar gains by the five other printing unions.\n\nThe ITU was a democratic labor union. Members served a five-year apprenticeship and were tested to become journeymen. The Progressives and Independents gave the union a two-party organization. The Progressive party gave most of the leaders to the ITU.\n\nIn 1907, ITU President James M. Lynch appointed a special committee, \"to formulate some system for the technical trade education of our members and apprentices.\" The committee selected, and President Lynch accepted, the ''ITU Course of Instruction'': thirty-six \"Lessons in Printing\". Courses were first offered to members of Chicago Typographical #16 by The Inland Printer Technical School of Chicago. Alumni would include future ITU presidents, Woodruff Randolph and John J. Pilch.\n\nIn 1914, ITU President James M. Lynch resigned, appointed by Governor [[Martin H. Glynn]] as New York State Commissioner of Labor. Many printers in the New York \"Big 6\" Local, saw the political appointment, a way to remove Lynch from dealing with newspaper publishers. James M. Lynch would serve as ITU president 1925\u20131926. Employers sought concessions after World War I as part of their '[[open shop]]' movement. A key goal was to lengthen the work day to 10 to 12 hours. The wartime ITU president Marsden G. Scott fought back with massive strikes all over the country. In one period (May to December 1921), new ITU president John McParland could say the defense fund was secure as the union collected over $6 million in strike donations and spent $5.5 million in strike benefits.\n\nBy June 1924, employers had had enough. The three-year running battle with the union had cost owners dearly and the union preserved its gains. However, the win was one that had cost the health of ITU president, John McParland, who served from 1921\u20131923. Charles P. Howard served out the rest of 1923 as ITU president; being elected in 1924 and serving until 1938.\n\n===ITU role in forming the CIO===\nThe ITU had been active in organizing new workers for almost 80 years. As the [[Great Depression]] created a crisis for American workers, the ITU joined with other unions in the AFL to agitate for more organizing.\n\nIn 1935, Charles P. Howard, president of the ITU, joined with [[John L. Lewis]] of the [[United Mine Workers]]; [[David Dubinsky]] of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]]; [[Sidney Hillman]] of the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]]; Thomas McMahon of the [[Textile Workers Union of America|United Textile Workers]]; John Sheridan of the [[International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers]]; Harvey Fremming of the [[Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union|Oil Workers Union]] and Max Zaritsky of the Hatters, Cap and Millinery Workers to form the [[Committee for Industrial Organization]] within the AFL.\n\nIn 1937, ITU Secretary Randolph was livid at AFL President William Green. The AFL executive council levied an assessment to fight industrial organization upon allied unions. The ITU refused to pay; Randolph's reason was \"not to pay any assessment levied by any means other than a referendum vote of ITU printers and mailers.\"\n\nThe craft unions within the AFL demanded that the committee stop organizing members on an industrial basis. Lewis and the other members of the CIO persisted.\n\nIn 1938, the AFL ejected the eight member unions of the CIO, including the ITU. At the 1938, ITU convention at [[Birmingham, Alabama]], President Claude M. Baker disclosed to the delegates the decision of the AFL. Three unions returned to the AFL. On  May 21, 1941, the ITU turned down reaffiliation with the AFL by referendum vote of the ITU members. In 1944, the ITU reaffiliated with the American Federation of Labor. The AFL promised the ITU full autonomy. ITU President Woodruff Randolph and AFL President William Green re-established and re-affirmed the ITU-AFL relationship, as if no breach had taken place. The five remaining unions subsequently formed the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]]. The CIO rejoined the AFL in 1955, forming the new entity known as the [[AFL\u2013CIO]]. AFL\u2013CIO President George Meany and his successors would have a cool relationship with all ITU presidents from Randolph to Bingle. ITU President Joe Bingle asked AFL-CIO President [[Lane Kirkland]] to speak at the 1983 San Francisco ITU Convention; Kirkland declined.\n\n===Woodruff Randolph===\nWoodruff Randolph (1892\u20131966), a printer from Chicago #16 and attorney-at-law, served as ITU Secretary-Treasurer (1929\u20131944) and ITU President (1944\u20131957). Randolph was very powerful and often usurped the position of ITU president Claude M. Baker. The ITU presidential election of 1944 between Baker and Randolph was one of the most vicious in union history. He loathed the [[National Labor Relations Board]]. During World War II, Randolph dealt with the [[National War Labor Board (1942\u20131945)|National War Labor Board]]. He led the Progressive party of the ITU. At the 1949 Oakland ITU convention, he spoke in harsh terms against the [[Taft\u2013Hartley Act]], the act in favor of the open shop. Chicago #16, Randolph's home local, was the first local hit by Taft-Hartley. On November 24, 1947 the Chicago papers went on a strike that lasted 22 months. Newspaper publishers called for aid from the authors of the law, U.S. Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] (R.-Ohio) and Congressman [[Fred A. Hartley, Jr.]] (R.-New Jersey) The ITU and Woodruff Randolph won in Chicago. He fought publishers and won in the early 1950s. In 1951, Randolph created ''Unitypo'', the union-supported newspaper in struck cities. ''Unitypo'' met with mixed results from the public at large. In the mid-1950s, Randolph embodied the ITU; his power was felt in every ITU shop and feared in every newspaper's board room. The printers were shocked during the 1957 ITU convention in New York to find that Randolph would not seek reelection.\n\nWoodruff Randolph hand-picked the Progressives to run for executive council in 1958, which would control the ITU for nearly twenty years. At the same time United States Senator [[John L. McClellan|John McClellan]] (D.-AR) was investigating [[organized crime]] in labor unions. When [[Dave Beck]], president of the Teamsters, resigned in 1957\u2014near the time of Randolph's statement of retirement\u2014many ITU members wondered about their long-time leader. The new ITU President Elmer Brown meekly appeared before the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management|U.S. Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management]]. Brown had been ITU second Vice-President (1944\u20131949) and had served in various offices in his home local, New York Typographical #6 (1945\u20131957). Brown claimed that during the 1957 ITU convention, Randolph requested Brown run for president of the ITU. Brown told the committee that he had not been aware of events in Indianapolis since he left the Executive Council. Randolph retired to his homes in Indiana and Florida, October 1, 1966, he died in the [[Union Printers Home]].\n\n===Printing decline===\nWoodruff Randolph's hand-picked Progressive Executive Council held the longest tenure as a unit in ITU history: from 1958&ndash;1978, its membership was Elmer Brown, president; John J. Pilch, first vice-president; Alexander Sandy Bevis, second vice-president (Canadian); Joseph P. Bailey, third vice-president (Mailer). Secretary-treasurer Don Hurd died in 1959, succeeded by William R. Cloud. After Elmer Brown's 1968 death, the ITU presidents were Pilch (1968\u20131973) and Bevis (1974\u20131978).\n\nThe [[Mergenthaler linotype machine]] was used by newspaper printers from the 1880s to the 1970s. Technological progress again confronted the ITU in the post-war period. A number of new advances\u2014including [[offset lithography]], [[flexography]], [[relief print]], [[screen printing]], [[rotogravure]], and [[digital printing]]\u2014greatly reduced the number of workers needed in the modern printshop and newspaper composing room.\n\nIn 1964, the ITU counted 121,858 members. But by 1980, the union had shed nearly a quarter of its membership due to technological advances. Toward the end of the ITU, the mailers outnumbered the printers. With the disappearance of linotype machines and the advent of paste makeup and computerized composition methods, the work in the composing rooms dropped. The mail rooms needed people to work on the inserting machines.\n\n===Merger===\nConcerned that the union did not have the economic strength to win good wages and benefits for its members and worried that further membership declines might threaten the viability of the union, the ITU leadership sought a merger with another printing union.\n\nThe ITU sought to merge with the [[Newspaper Guild]] but terminated negotiations in 1981 after nearly four years of talks. The ITU discussed merging with the [[Graphic Communications International Union]], but the talks did not proceed very far. Later, the GCIU merged into the IBT.\n\nProblems plagued the term of ITU President Joe Bingel (1978\u20131983). In a contested special election between Bingel and Robert McMichen, McMichen, the anti-Teamster candidate, won the election. However, the ITU was dying.\n\nThe ITU executive council subsequently required president Robert McMichen to enter into merger talks with the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]]. IBT President [[Jackie Presser]] spoke of merger with the ITU; at the 1983 San Francisco ITU convention. ITU President Joe Bingle risked his leadership post on the ITU\u2013IBT merger and lost. However, the ITU's 74,000 members turned down the merger two-to-one in a vote taken in 1985, fearing that the Teamsters could not be trusted to respect the terms of the merger agreement\u2014which included the hallmark of the ITU: autonomy. The Mailers would later join the Teamsters; the Printers would not. The last ITU convention was held in 1984 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. By 1986, the ITU had only 44,000 active members.\n\nOn December 31, 1986, the [[Associated Press]] printed the following with a dateline of Colorado Springs, Colorado:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe International Typographical Union has ceased to exist, and most of its staff was laid off at national headquarters here.\nMost of the 60 workers are continuing on a temporary basis with the Communication Workers of America, with which the ITU merged, said ITU spokesman Bill Frazee.\nThe ITU ended operations on December 31, 1986. On January 1, 1987, the union joined the CWA as its Printing, Publishing and Media Workers Sector.\nCWA has its headquarters in Washington, D.C. and employees working for the sector will transfer there in two to four months, Frazee said.\nThe International Typographical Union was the nation's oldest union, charted nationally in 1852. Its membership peaked in the 1960s at 100,000 printers.\nBut since computerization of the business, membership has dropped to 40,000 working printers and 35,000 retirees.\n</blockquote>\n\nFinally, in 1987, the printers of the ITU merged with the [[Communications Workers of America]] (CWA). It is now the Printing, Publishing, and Media Workers Sector of the CWA. Daniel F. Wasser is currently president <ref>http://www.cwa-ppmws.org/</ref> of the sector.\n\nThe Mailers were split between the CWA and IBT. In May 1986, many Mailer locals joined \"The Mailers' Conference of the CWA\". When the ITU ended, some of the Mailer locals merged into the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). It is now the Newspaper, Magazine and Electronic Media Workers Division. Joe Molinero is the division director.\n\nThe ITU Fraternal Pension Fund was from 1908\u20131966. Elmer Brown created the Negotiated Pension Plan (NPP). Today, the pension for all ITU members before 1986 and CWA members since 1987 is the CWA/ITU Negotiated Pension Plan. This pension plan is located in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Teamsters have the IBT Pension for members after 1987.\n\n==Administration==\n\n===Original chartered locals===\nOn May 5, 1852:\n* Indianapolis, #1\n* Philadelphia, #2\n* Cincinnati, #3\n* Albany, #4\n* Columbus, #5\n* New York, #6\n* Pittsburgh, #7\n* St. Louis, #8\n* Buffalo, #9\n* Louisville, #10\n* Memphis, #11\n* Baltimore, #12\n* Boston, #13\n* Harrisburg, #14\n\nChartered later in 1852:\n* Rochester, #15\n* Chicago, #16\n* New Orleans, #17\n* Detroit, #18\n* Elmira, #19\n* Nashville, #20\n* San Francisco, #21\n\nA group of thirty men met to organize the Columbia Typographical Society in Washington, DC in December 1814.  In 1867 they joined the newly-formed National Typographical Union (later, the International Typographical Union) as Columbia Typographical Union No. 101, representing workers at The Washington Post, Times-Herald, and Evening Star.  Columbia Typographical Union/CWA No. 101 is now the oldest continuously existing labor union local in the United States.<ref>https://reuther.wayne.edu/files/LR001577.pdf</ref>\n\n''The Typographical Journal'' records that in May 1892 there were 300 locals.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Office headquarters===\nAt the Kansas City ITU convention of 1888, [[Indianapolis]] was selected as the official headquarters for the International Typographical Union. ITU President Edward T. Plank, declared, \"In 1888 [...] all official (ITU) business, together with books, accounts and records shall be kept [...] at the City of Indianapolis, County of Marion, State of Indiana.\" During the 1927 ITU convention, at Indianapolis, ITU President Charles P. Howard showed delegates the Van Camp Mansion at Meridian and Twenty-Eighth Streets, which was to serve as the ITU headquarters.\n\nThe 1959 ITU convention at Philadelphia passed an action to move the ITU headquarters, after 73 years in Indianapolis, it was decided that the headquarters would be moved to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. The building began in 1961, the new ITU Headquarters (225 S. Union Blvd.) and ITU Training Center (301 S. Union Blvd.) being located on the grounds of the Union Printers Home (101 S. Union Blvd.). The final move to Colorado Springs of President Elmer Brown and the Executive Council was completed in February 1963. The ITU Training Center, which opened on May 5, 1962, would publish ''The Typographical Journal'', ''The ITU Bulletin'', and ''The ITU Review''. The former two were the oldest trade union organs founded in 1889.\n\n===Union Printers Home===\nIn 1889, Colorado Springs, Colorado was chosen as the site of Union Printers Home. George W. Childs, publisher of the Philadelphia ''[[Public Ledger (Philadelphia)|Public Ledger]]'' and his philanthropist friend Anthony J. Drexel gave a gift of $10,000 in 1886 to start work toward the Home, thus starting a fund which grew. The 1890 ITU convention in Atlanta approved of the Home.\n\nOn May 12, 1892, the Childs\u2013Drexel Home for Union Printers opened on {{convert|29|acre|m2}} located on the corner of Pikes Peak Ave. and S. Union Blvd. \"A Home for the Aged and Sanatorium for Tuberculars. Maintained by the International Typographical Union for Its Distressed Members.\" 19th Century printers suffered from tuberculosis, and the clean air of the Rocky Mountains, Pikes Peak area in Colorado was seen as a location to clean the diseased lungs. The home was open only to members of the ITU; members' wives or widows were not admitted. John D. Vaughn served as first Superintendent of the Home while its first member was W. B. Eckert, a retired member and former officer of the Philadelphia #2 local. The 1899 ITU convention at Detroit approved the name Union Printers Home. The home, a hospital and sanatorium, was staffed by its own doctors, nurses and other medical technicians. The lands of the home grew to {{convert|260|acre|km2}} to accommodate a dairy, farms, gardens, power plant, and workshops to help make the UPH self-sufficient. In 1944, Dowell Patterson (1899\u20131968), superintendent of the home, saw that the most modern of medical equipment was furnished to the UPH. In later years, the tubercular sanitoriums were razed. Today the home serves the people of Colorado Springs and El Paso County as a health care facility with assisted living and nursing care. The main building is a State of Colorado historical site.\n\n===Women's International Auxiliary===\nThe Women's International Auxiliary was formed at the 1902 Cincinnati ITU Convention. The WIA slogan was ''Spend Union Earned Money for Union Label Products and Union Services'' and its quarterly publication was ''Label Facts''. The WIA contributed to the Union Printers Home Fund with various fund raising events. At each ITU convention the WIA would award prizes for the, ''Union Label Poster'' contest. Only printer wives were eligible to be elected to the WIA local and international offices. After 1948, [[International Typographical Union#Mailers|mailers']] wives were only eligible to serve the local and international WIA auxiliary as third vice president.\n\nThe Women's International Auxiliary of the International Typographical Union ceased to exist after 1990, which was after the dissolution of the parent union.\n\n===Allied Printing Trades Association===\nIn March 1911, five international unions created the Allied Printing Trades Association:\n* International Typographical Union\n* Pressmen\n* Bookbinders\n* Photo Engravers\n* Stereotypers and Electrotypers Unions\n\nIn 1955, there was a new agreement, and the following unions were included in the association:\n* United Papermakers and Paperworkers\n* The Newspaper Guild\n* The International Brotherhood of Pulp, Sulphite and Paper Mill Workers\n* The Plate Printers\n* Die Stampers and Engravers\n\nThe Mailer unions chartered by the ITU were eligible for membership in Allied Printing Trades Councils. The International Mailers Union was refused membership.\n\n===Mailers===\nNearly 100 Mailer Locals would be chartered under the ITU. To mark the difference between the Printers and Mailers Unions, the ITU used the '''M''' before the local number. In New York City, Typographical #6 and Mailers, M-6. The position of the mailers was that of second-class citizens in the ITU, with no voice on the executive council. Mailers Cary Weaver and Munro Roberts felt the needs of mailers fell on deaf printer ears on the ITU executive council.\n\nThe Mailers Trade District Union (MTDU) was an internal part of the ITU. Lawsuits from 1926\u20131944 were fought for mailer rights. The MTDU was eventually abolished by court [[injunction]] and [[referendum]] vote. In 1929, ITU president Charles P. Howard selected third vice-president C. N. Smith (a printer) to represent the MTDU. The mailers were allowed to vote in 1930 for their MTDU representative; John Mc Ardle and Harold Mitchell served in 1934. Munro Roberts was elected as MTDU member of the executive council, (1935&ndash;1937) but he had no voice or vote. After many heated arguments with ITU President Howard and Secretary Randolph, Roberts became committed to a separate mailer union. Moreover, the International Mailers' Union (IMU), was created and many shops would have two boards, ITU and IMU. With the departure of Roberts, Thomas J. Martin represented the MTDU (1938&ndash;1944). The MTDU continued by court order; however, the mailers were again without an observer to the executive council. The 1947 Cleveland convention paved the way for the demise of the MTDU and the election of a mailer to the executive council. Joe Bailey (San Francisco\u2013Oakland Mailers #M-18), was elected third vice-president before the 1948 Milwaukee convention. ITU President Woodruff Randolph saw a way to appease mailers returning after service in World War II. The agreement made between ITU President Randolph and Joe Bailey: only a Printer would ever be president, first and second Vice-President or Secretary-Treasurer of the ITU. The position of third Vice-President would be held only by a Mailer. The IMU lost much power to draw new membership. The IMU finally was finally fully merged into the ITU only in 1982, only five years before the union's demise. Joe Bailey served on the ITU executive council until 1973. A mailer would remain ITU third vice-president: Robert F. Ameln, (1974&ndash;1975) and the Canadian mailer, Allen J. Heritage, (1976&ndash;1986).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Organized Labour}}\n*[[United States labor law]]\n*[[United Kingdom labour law]]\n*[[List of labor unions in the United States]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Archives===\n* The [http://www.hsp.org/files/findingaid2076itup.pdf International Typographical Union, Local 2 (Philadelphia) Records], documenting union activities from 1850 to 1967, are available for research use at the [[Historical Society of Pennsylvania]].\n* [http://digital.lib.washington.edu/findingaids/view?docId=InternationalTypographicalUnion5370.xml Preliminary Guide to the International Typographical Union Records]. 1890\u20131982. .17 cubic foot (2 folders).

It was founded on May 3, 1852 as the United States as the National Typographical Union, and changed its name to the International Typographical Union at its [[Albany, New York]] convention in 1869 after it began organizing members in Canada. The ITU was one of the first unions to admit female members, admitting women members such as Augusta Lewis, Mary Moore and Eva Howard in 1869.\n\nTypographers were educated, [[economic mobility|economically mobile]], in every major urban center with newspapers, and had the unique possibility to influence publicity in favour of their cause. This led the union to the forefront of improving working conditions. ITU President W. B. Prescott led the ITU in 1897 to win a 48-hour work week and a standard wage scale for all printers. During the [[Great Depression]], the ITU introduced the [[40-hour work week]] across the industry at no cost to employers as a way to share the fewer jobs available. That ITU initiative spread to other unions and has since been codified across the labor sector by federal legislation in the U.S. establishing the 40-hour work week.\n\nThe ITU had a unique system of factional opposition in its [[democratic election]]s, documented by [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] in his co-authored book ''[[Union Democracy: The Internal Politics of the International Typographical Union]]'' (1957).<ref>S. M. Lipset, ''[[Union Democracy: The Internal Politics of the International Typographical Union]]'' (1957)</ref> The local scale committees worked for a decent wage while the executive council sent ITU representatives to assist local unions in contract negotiations. All contracts had to be approved and ratified by both the Executive Council and the newspaper publisher. For most of its history, the ITU benefited from friendly and strong competition between Independents and Progressives for control of the union.\n\nAs the work of [[typographer]]s declined with automation, computers and mechanization of the print media, the ITU was disbanded. In 1986, a majority of ITU [[mailer (occupation)|mailers]] voted to merge with the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] and the remaining typographers joined the [[Communications Workers of America]]. Before its dissolution, the ITU was the oldest union in the United States.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation===\nThe concept for a typographical union was formed at a New York City meeting of 18 representatives from typographers' associations in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Kentucky in December 1850. A committee led by John Keyser of Philadelphia was formed to investigate issues and propose a plan of action.\n\nThe representatives met again in Baltimore in September 1851. While they resolved to form a national union, no other actions were taken.\n\nFinally, delegates from typographers' unions in 14 cities met in [[Cincinnati]] in May 1852 and organized the National Typographical Union. A random drawing enabled the Indianapolis local to become Local Union #1 and the new headquarters. In 1869, a new Constitution was adopted, accepting the affiliation of Canadian printing trade unions and changing the name to the International Typographical Union. In 1873, at Montreal, Canada, the first ITU convention outside the United States was held. ''The ITU Book of Laws'' would be amended many times, yet it was as members called it \"ITU Law.\" Each union shop was a \"[[Local union|Chapel]]\" and the shop steward was the \"Chapel Chairman\". All apprentices and journeymen had to have working cards showing paid union dues. ITU Law dictated that [[Union dues|dues]], which were proportionate to the amount of work done in the chapel, had to be paid by the first Tuesday after the last Saturday of the month. If the Union dues were not paid, the member was not allowed to work until their payment.\n\n===Fragmentation===\n[[File:IBoB group photo.png|thumb|The International Brotherhood of Bookbinders in [[Salt Lake City]], Utah in 1908]]\nTechnological developments in the late 19th century such as the development of [[lithography]] and photography led to diversification and specialization among printers. Further fragmentation in the printing labor movement led to the establishment of the International Printing Pressmen Union of North America (IPPU), in 1889. In 1892, the ITU authorized membership for mailers and for newspaper writers. Pressure mounted for a separate pressman's union, and in 1892 the International Brotherhood of Bookbinders (IBB) was formed. Many pressmen left the ITU for the Bookbinders. At the same time as mailers joined, two thousand pressmen members seceded to form the International Printing Pressmen Union Assistants, (IPPUA) in 1897 and the International Stereotypers' and Electroplaters' Union, (IS&EU) in 1902. At the start of the 20th Century, ITU membership was primarily compositors and mailers.\n\nIn 1894, the Louisville convention sought to have president W. B. Prescott examine ways to have newer technology under the ITU. Then, the ITU chartered a [[Photoengraving|photoengraver]]s' union in New York City. Over the next few years, the ITU organized photoengravers in several other cities as well. However, many photoengravers felt that the leaders of the ITU were indifferent to their needs.\n\nIn 1899, photoengravers in New York City went on strike to demand a 48-hour work week. ITU President S. B. Donnelly refused to support the local, fearing employers might retaliate. The New York City photoengravers won their strike, but the lack of ITU support led most of the union's photoengraver locals to seek disaffiliation. A national convention in Philadelphia in November 1900 saw the photoengravers leaving the ITU and establishing the International Photo-Engravers' Union of North America. ITU President James M. Lynch, pressured the AFL into refusing to recognize the photoengravers' union until May 1904.\n\nIn 1893, the ITU struck [[Harrison Gray Otis (publisher)|Harrison Gray Otis]]'s ''[[Los Angeles Times]].'' In 1896, the union began a [[boycott]] that ran until 1908. In 1903, ITU President James M. Lynch, persuaded [[William Randolph Hearst]] to start a rival paper, the ''Los Angeles Examiner''.\n\nOn October 1, 1910, James B. Mc Namara, an ITU member and his brother. Joseph J. Mc Namara, secretary-treasurer of the International Union of Bridge and Structural Iron Workers placed [[Los Angeles Times bombing|a bomb in the ''L.A. Times'' building]], killing 21 people. Famed attorney [[Clarence Darrow]] defended the brothers. They were convicted of the bombing and murder. Despite various job actions that lasted into the 1920s, the ''L.A. Times'' remained a non-union shop. This was a major defeat for both the ITU and other trade unions; Los Angeles and Southern California would be lost to trade unions except in the case of the entertainment industry.\n\n===AFL===\nAs early as 1879, the International Typographical Union was in the forefront of organized labor. The ITU was instrumental in the formation of the [[Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions]] in 1882. In the same time frame, the ITU rejected the [[Knights of Labor]]. In the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) presidential election of 1881, William H. Foster of the ITU defeated Samuel Gompers. In 1886, the [[Cigar Makers' International Union|Cigar Makers' Union]] leader, [[Samuel Gompers]], was elected AFL president. The ITU was the largest and strongest union in the AFL. By the end of the 19th century, ITU President S. B. Donnelly called the ITU the \"strongest and most stable printing union in the United States\". In 1924, [[William Green (U.S. labor leader)|William Green]] would succeed Gompers as AFL president. The seeds of discord between the AFL and ITU were sown.\n\n===Fight for better working conditions===\n[[File:International Typographical Union exhibit, Forestry Building, Alaska-Yukon-Pacific-Exposition, Seattle, Washington, 1909 (AYP 1107).jpeg|thumb|left|International Typographical Union exhibit at the [[Alaska\u2013Yukon\u2013Pacific Exposition]], Seattle, 1909]]\nFrom October 1891, the ITU Mortuary Benefits were the most respected in trade unionism.\n\nIn 1906, ITU President James M. Lynch decided to use strong tactics and initiated strikes in most major cities, attempting to secure an [[eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]]. The union had lost a fight for a nine-hour day a few years earlier; however, this time, the union spent over US$4 million supporting its striking locals. Not only did the ITU win an eight-hour work day, but the ITU strike paved the way for similar gains by the five other printing unions.\n\nThe ITU was a democratic labor union. Members served a five-year apprenticeship and were tested to become journeymen. The Progressives and Independents gave the union a two-party organization. The Progressive party gave most of the leaders to the ITU.\n\nIn 1907, ITU President James M. Lynch appointed a special committee, \"to formulate some system for the technical trade education of our members and apprentices.\" The committee selected, and President Lynch accepted, the ''ITU Course of Instruction'': thirty-six \"Lessons in Printing\". Courses were first offered to members of Chicago Typographical #16 by The Inland Printer Technical School of Chicago. Alumni would include future ITU presidents, Woodruff Randolph and John J. Pilch.\n\nIn 1914, ITU President James M. Lynch resigned, appointed by Governor [[Martin H. Glynn]] as New York State Commissioner of Labor. Many printers in the New York \"Big 6\" Local, saw the political appointment, a way to remove Lynch from dealing with newspaper publishers. James M. Lynch would serve as ITU president 1925\u20131926. Employers sought concessions after World War I as part of their '[[open shop]]' movement. A key goal was to lengthen the work day to 10 to 12 hours. The wartime ITU president Marsden G. Scott fought back with massive strikes all over the country. In one period (May to December 1921), new ITU president John McParland could say the defense fund was secure as the union collected over $6 million in strike donations and spent $5.5 million in strike benefits.\n\nBy June 1924, employers had had enough. The three-year running battle with the union had cost owners dearly and the union preserved its gains. However, the win was one that had cost the health of ITU president, John McParland, who served from 1921\u20131923. Charles P. Howard served out the rest of 1923 as ITU president; being elected in 1924 and serving until 1938.\n\n===ITU role in forming the CIO===\nThe ITU had been active in organizing new workers for almost 80 years. As the [[Great Depression]] created a crisis for American workers, the ITU joined with other unions in the AFL to agitate for more organizing.\n\nIn 1935, Charles P. Howard, president of the ITU, joined with [[John L. Lewis]] of the [[United Mine Workers]]; [[David Dubinsky]] of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]]; [[Sidney Hillman]] of the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]]; Thomas McMahon of the [[Textile Workers Union of America|United Textile Workers]]; John Sheridan of the [[International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers]]; Harvey Fremming of the [[Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union|Oil Workers Union]] and Max Zaritsky of the Hatters, Cap and Millinery Workers to form the [[Committee for Industrial Organization]] within the AFL.\n\nIn 1937, ITU Secretary Randolph was livid at AFL President William Green. The AFL executive council levied an assessment to fight industrial organization upon allied unions. The ITU refused to pay; Randolph's reason was \"not to pay any assessment levied by any means other than a referendum vote of ITU printers and mailers.\"\n\nThe craft unions within the AFL demanded that the committee stop organizing members on an industrial basis. Lewis and the other members of the CIO persisted.\n\nIn 1938, the AFL ejected the eight member unions of the CIO, including the ITU. At the 1938, ITU convention at [[Birmingham, Alabama]], President Claude M. Baker disclosed to the delegates the decision of the AFL. Three unions returned to the AFL. On  May 21, 1941, the ITU turned down reaffiliation with the AFL by referendum vote of the ITU members. In 1944, the ITU reaffiliated with the American Federation of Labor. The AFL promised the ITU full autonomy. ITU President Woodruff Randolph and AFL President William Green re-established and re-affirmed the ITU-AFL relationship, as if no breach had taken place. The five remaining unions subsequently formed the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]]. The CIO rejoined the AFL in 1955, forming the new entity known as the [[AFL\u2013CIO]]. AFL\u2013CIO President George Meany and his successors would have a cool relationship with all ITU presidents from Randolph to Bingle. ITU President Joe Bingle asked AFL-CIO President [[Lane Kirkland]] to speak at the 1983 San Francisco ITU Convention; Kirkland declined.\n\n===Woodruff Randolph===\nWoodruff Randolph (1892\u20131966), a printer from Chicago #16 and attorney-at-law, served as ITU Secretary-Treasurer (1929\u20131944) and ITU President (1944\u20131957). Randolph was very powerful and often usurped the position of ITU president Claude M. Baker. The ITU presidential election of 1944 between Baker and Randolph was one of the most vicious in union history. He loathed the [[National Labor Relations Board]]. During World War II, Randolph dealt with the [[National War Labor Board (1942\u20131945)|National War Labor Board]]. He led the Progressive party of the ITU. At the 1949 Oakland ITU convention, he spoke in harsh terms against the [[Taft\u2013Hartley Act]], the act in favor of the open shop. Chicago #16, Randolph's home local, was the first local hit by Taft-Hartley. On November 24, 1947 the Chicago papers went on a strike that lasted 22 months. Newspaper publishers called for aid from the authors of the law, U.S. Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] (R.-Ohio) and Congressman [[Fred A. Hartley, Jr.]] (R.-New Jersey) The ITU and Woodruff Randolph won in Chicago. He fought publishers and won in the early 1950s. In 1951, Randolph created ''Unitypo'', the union-supported newspaper in struck cities. ''Unitypo'' met with mixed results from the public at large. In the mid-1950s, Randolph embodied the ITU; his power was felt in every ITU shop and feared in every newspaper's board room. The printers were shocked during the 1957 ITU convention in New York to find that Randolph would not seek reelection.\n\nWoodruff Randolph hand-picked the Progressives to run for executive council in 1958, which would control the ITU for nearly twenty years. At the same time United States Senator [[John L. McClellan|John McClellan]] (D.-AR) was investigating [[organized crime]] in labor unions. When [[Dave Beck]], president of the Teamsters, resigned in 1957\u2014near the time of Randolph's statement of retirement\u2014many ITU members wondered about their long-time leader. The new ITU President Elmer Brown meekly appeared before the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management|U.S. Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management]]. Brown had been ITU second Vice-President (1944\u20131949) and had served in various offices in his home local, New York Typographical #6 (1945\u20131957). Brown claimed that during the 1957 ITU convention, Randolph requested Brown run for president of the ITU. Brown told the committee that he had not been aware of events in Indianapolis since he left the Executive Council. Randolph retired to his homes in Indiana and Florida, October 1, 1966, he died in the [[Union Printers Home]].\n\n===Printing decline===\nWoodruff Randolph's hand-picked Progressive Executive Council held the longest tenure as a unit in ITU history: from 1958&ndash;1978, its membership was Elmer Brown, president; John J. Pilch, first vice-president; Alexander Sandy Bevis, second vice-president (Canadian); Joseph P. Bailey, third vice-president (Mailer). Secretary-treasurer Don Hurd died in 1959, succeeded by William R. Cloud. After Elmer Brown's 1968 death, the ITU presidents were Pilch (1968\u20131973) and Bevis (1974\u20131978).\n\nThe [[Mergenthaler linotype machine]] was used by newspaper printers from the 1880s to the 1970s. Technological progress again confronted the ITU in the post-war period. A number of new advances\u2014including [[offset lithography]], [[flexography]], [[relief print]], [[screen printing]], [[rotogravure]], and [[digital printing]]\u2014greatly reduced the number of workers needed in the modern printshop and newspaper composing room.\n\nIn 1964, the ITU counted 121,858 members. But by 1980, the union had shed nearly a quarter of its membership due to technological advances. Toward the end of the ITU, the mailers outnumbered the printers. With the disappearance of linotype machines and the advent of paste makeup and computerized composition methods, the work in the composing rooms dropped. The mail rooms needed people to work on the inserting machines.\n\n===Merger===\nConcerned that the union did not have the economic strength to win good wages and benefits for its members and worried that further membership declines might threaten the viability of the union, the ITU leadership sought a merger with another printing union.\n\nThe ITU sought to merge with the [[Newspaper Guild]] but terminated negotiations in 1981 after nearly four years of talks. The ITU discussed merging with the [[Graphic Communications International Union]], but the talks did not proceed very far. Later, the GCIU merged into the IBT.\n\nProblems plagued the term of ITU President Joe Bingel (1978\u20131983). In a contested special election between Bingel and Robert McMichen, McMichen, the anti-Teamster candidate, won the election. However, the ITU was dying.\n\nThe ITU executive council subsequently required president Robert McMichen to enter into merger talks with the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]]. IBT President [[Jackie Presser]] spoke of merger with the ITU; at the 1983 San Francisco ITU convention. ITU President Joe Bingle risked his leadership post on the ITU\u2013IBT merger and lost. However, the ITU's 74,000 members turned down the merger two-to-one in a vote taken in 1985, fearing that the Teamsters could not be trusted to respect the terms of the merger agreement\u2014which included the hallmark of the ITU: autonomy. The Mailers would later join the Teamsters; the Printers would not. The last ITU convention was held in 1984 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. By 1986, the ITU had only 44,000 active members.\n\nOn December 31, 1986, the [[Associated Press]] printed the following with a dateline of Colorado Springs, Colorado:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe International Typographical Union has ceased to exist, and most of its staff was laid off at national headquarters here.\nMost of the 60 workers are continuing on a temporary basis with the Communication Workers of America, with which the ITU merged, said ITU spokesman Bill Frazee.\nThe ITU ended operations on December 31, 1986. On January 1, 1987, the union joined the CWA as its Printing, Publishing and Media Workers Sector.\nCWA has its headquarters in Washington, D.C. and employees working for the sector will transfer there in two to four months, Frazee said.\nThe International Typographical Union was the nation's oldest union, charted nationally in 1852. Its membership peaked in the 1960s at 100,000 printers.\nBut since computerization of the business, membership has dropped to 40,000 working printers and 35,000 retirees.\n</blockquote>\n\nFinally, in 1987, the printers of the ITU merged with the [[Communications Workers of America]] (CWA). It is now the Printing, Publishing, and Media Workers Sector of the CWA. Daniel F. Wasser is currently president <ref>http://www.cwa-ppmws.org/</ref> of the sector.\n\nThe Mailers were split between the CWA and IBT. In May 1986, many Mailer locals joined \"The Mailers' Conference of the CWA\". When the ITU ended, some of the Mailer locals merged into the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). It is now the Newspaper, Magazine and Electronic Media Workers Division. Joe Molinero is the division director.\n\nThe ITU Fraternal Pension Fund was from 1908\u20131966. Elmer Brown created the Negotiated Pension Plan (NPP). Today, the pension for all ITU members before 1986 and CWA members since 1987 is the CWA/ITU Negotiated Pension Plan. This pension plan is located in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Teamsters have the IBT Pension for members after 1987.\n\n==Administration==\n\n===Original chartered locals===\nOn May 5, 1852:\n* Indianapolis, #1\n* Philadelphia, #2\n* Cincinnati, #3\n* Albany, #4\n* Columbus, #5\n* New York, #6\n* Pittsburgh, #7\n* St. Louis, #8\n* Buffalo, #9\n* Louisville, #10\n* Memphis, #11\n* Baltimore, #12\n* Boston, #13\n* Harrisburg, #14\n\nChartered later in 1852:\n* Rochester, #15\n* Chicago, #16\n* New Orleans, #17\n* Detroit, #18\n* Elmira, #19\n* Nashville, #20\n* San Francisco, #21\n\nA group of thirty men met to organize the Columbia Typographical Society in Washington, DC in December of 1814.  In 1867 they joined the newly-formed National Typographical Union (later, the International Typographical Union) as Columbia Typographical Union No. 101, representing workers at The Washington Post, Times-Herald, and Evening Star.  Columbia Typographical Union/CWA No. 101 is now the oldest continuously existing labor union local in the United States.  <ref>https://reuther.wayne.edu/files/LR001577.pdf</ref>\n\n\n''The Typographical Journal'' records that in May 1892 there were 300 locals.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Office headquarters===\nAt the Kansas City ITU convention of 1888, [[Indianapolis]] was selected as the official headquarters for the International Typographical Union. ITU President Edward T. Plank, declared, \"In 1888 [...] all official (ITU) business, together with books, accounts and records shall be kept [...] at the City of Indianapolis, County of Marion, State of Indiana.\" During the 1927 ITU convention, at Indianapolis, ITU President Charles P. Howard showed delegates the Van Camp Mansion at Meridian and Twenty-Eighth Streets, which was to serve as the ITU headquarters.\n\nThe 1959 ITU convention at Philadelphia passed an action to move the ITU headquarters, after 73 years in Indianapolis, it was decided that the headquarters would be moved to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. The building began in 1961, the new ITU Headquarters (225 S. Union Blvd.) and ITU Training Center (301 S. Union Blvd.) being located on the grounds of the Union Printers Home (101 S. Union Blvd.). The final move to Colorado Springs of President Elmer Brown and the Executive Council was completed in February 1963. The ITU Training Center, which opened on May 5, 1962, would publish ''The Typographical Journal'', ''The ITU Bulletin'', and ''The ITU Review''. The former two were the oldest trade union organs founded in 1889.\n\n===Union Printers Home===\nIn 1889, Colorado Springs, Colorado was chosen as the site of Union Printers Home. George W. Childs, publisher of the Philadelphia ''[[Public Ledger (Philadelphia)|Public Ledger]]'' and his philanthropist friend Anthony J. Drexel gave a gift of $10,000 in 1886 to start work toward the Home, thus starting a fund which grew. The 1890 ITU convention in Atlanta approved of the Home.\n\nOn May 12, 1892, the Childs\u2013Drexel Home for Union Printers opened on {{convert|29|acre|m2}} located on the corner of Pikes Peak Ave. and S. Union Blvd. \"A Home for the Aged and Sanatorium for Tuberculars. Maintained by the International Typographical Union for Its Distressed Members.\" 19th Century printers suffered from tuberculosis, and the clean air of the Rocky Mountains, Pikes Peak area in Colorado was seen as a location to clean the diseased lungs. The home was open only to members of the ITU; members' wives or widows were not admitted. John D. Vaughn served as first Superintendent of the Home while its first member was W. B. Eckert, a retired member and former officer of the Philadelphia #2 local. The 1899 ITU convention at Detroit approved the name Union Printers Home. The home, a hospital and sanatorium, was staffed by its own doctors, nurses and other medical technicians. The lands of the home grew to {{convert|260|acre|km2}} to accommodate a dairy, farms, gardens, power plant, and workshops to help make the UPH self-sufficient. In 1944, Dowell Patterson (1899\u20131968), superintendent of the home, saw that the most modern of medical equipment was furnished to the UPH. In later years, the tubercular sanitoriums were razed. Today the home serves the people of Colorado Springs and El Paso County as a health care facility with assisted living and nursing care. The main building is a State of Colorado historical site.\n\n===Women's International Auxiliary===\nThe Women's International Auxiliary was formed at the 1902 Cincinnati ITU Convention. The WIA slogan was ''Spend Union Earned Money for Union Label Products and Union Services'' and its quarterly publication was ''Label Facts''. The WIA contributed to the Union Printers Home Fund with various fund raising events. At each ITU convention the WIA would award prizes for the, ''Union Label Poster'' contest. Only printer wives were eligible to be elected to the WIA local and international offices. After 1948, [[International Typographical Union#Mailers|mailers']] wives were only eligible to serve the local and international WIA auxiliary as third vice president.\n\nThe Women's International Auxiliary of the International Typographical Union ceased to exist after 1990, which was after the dissolution of the parent union.\n\n===Allied Printing Trades Association===\nIn March 1911, five international unions created the Allied Printing Trades Association:\n* International Typographical Union\n* Pressmen\n* Bookbinders\n* Photo Engravers\n* Stereotypers and Electrotypers Unions\n\nIn 1955, there was a new agreement, and the following unions were included in the association:\n* United Papermakers and Paperworkers\n* The Newspaper Guild\n* The International Brotherhood of Pulp, Sulphite and Paper Mill Workers\n* The Plate Printers\n* Die Stampers and Engravers\n\nThe Mailer unions chartered by the ITU were eligible for membership in Allied Printing Trades Councils. The International Mailers Union was refused membership.\n\n===Mailers===\nNearly 100 Mailer Locals would be chartered under the ITU. To mark the difference between the Printers and Mailers Unions, the ITU used the '''M''' before the local number. In New York City, Typographical #6 and Mailers, M-6. The position of the mailers was that of second-class citizens in the ITU, with no voice on the executive council. Mailers Cary Weaver and Munro Roberts felt the needs of mailers fell on deaf printer ears on the ITU executive council.\n\nThe Mailers Trade District Union (MTDU) was an internal part of the ITU. Lawsuits from 1926\u20131944 were fought for mailer rights. The MTDU was eventually abolished by court [[injunction]] and [[referendum]] vote. In 1929, ITU president Charles P. Howard selected third vice-president C. N. Smith (a printer) to represent the MTDU. The mailers were allowed to vote in 1930 for their MTDU representative; John Mc Ardle and Harold Mitchell served in 1934. Munro Roberts was elected as MTDU member of the executive council, (1935&ndash;1937) but he had no voice or vote. After many heated arguments with ITU President Howard and Secretary Randolph, Roberts became committed to a separate mailer union. Moreover, the International Mailers' Union (IMU), was created and many shops would have two boards, ITU and IMU. With the departure of Roberts, Thomas J. Martin represented the MTDU (1938&ndash;1944). The MTDU continued by court order; however, the mailers were again without an observer to the executive council. The 1947 Cleveland convention paved the way for the demise of the MTDU and the election of a mailer to the executive council. Joe Bailey (San Francisco\u2013Oakland Mailers #M-18), was elected third vice-president before the 1948 Milwaukee convention. ITU President Woodruff Randolph saw a way to appease mailers returning after service in World War II. The agreement made between ITU President Randolph and Joe Bailey: only a Printer would ever be President, first and second Vice-President or Secretary-Treasurer of the ITU. The position of third Vice-President would be held only by a Mailer. The IMU lost much power to draw new membership. The IMU finally was finally fully merged into the ITU only in 1982, only five years before the union's demise. Joe Bailey served on the ITU executive council until 1973. A mailer would remain ITU third vice-president: Robert F. Ameln, (1974&ndash;1975) and the Canadian mailer, Allen J. Heritage, (1976&ndash;1986).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Organized Labour}}\n*[[United States labor law]]\n*[[United Kingdom labour law]]\n*[[List of labor unions in the United States]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Archives===\n* The [http://www.hsp.org/files/findingaid2076itup.pdf International Typographical Union, Local 2 (Philadelphia) Records], documenting union activities from 1850 to 1967, are available for research use at the [[Historical Society of Pennsylvania]].\n* [http://digital.lib.washington.edu/findingaids/view?docId=InternationalTypographicalUnion5370.xml Preliminary Guide to the International Typographical Union Records]. 1890-1982. .17 cubic foot (2 folders).

The film was created using original footage of the [[First World War]] from the [[Imperial War Museum]]'s archives, most previously unseen, all over 100 years old by the time of release. Audio is from [[BBC]] and Imperial War Museum (IWM) interviews of [[British people|British]] servicemen who fought in the conflict. Most of the footage has been [[Film colorization|colourised]] and transformed with modern production techniques, with the addition of [[sound effect]]s and [[voice acting]] to be more evocative and feel closer to the soldiers' actual experiences.\n\nIt is Jackson's first documentary as director. Jackson, whose grandfather (to whom the film is dedicated) fought in the war, intended for the film to be an immersive experience of \"what it was like to be a soldier\" rather than a story or a recount of events. The crew reviewed 600 hours of interviews from 200 veterans and 100 hours of original film footage to make the film.

The film was created using original footage of the [[First World War]] from the [[Imperial War Museum]]'s archives, most previously unseen, all over 100 years old by the time of release. Audio is from [[BBC]] and Imperial War Museum (IWM) interviews of [[British people|British]] servicemen who fought in the conflict. Most of the footage has been [[Film colorization|colourised]] and transformed with modern production techniques, with the addition of [[sound effect]]s and [[voice acting]] to be more evocative and feel closer to the soldiers' actual experiences.\n\nIt is Jackson's first documentary as director. Jackson, whose grandfather (to whom the film is dedicated) fought in the war, intended for the film to be an immersive experience of \"what it was like to be a soldier\" rather than a story or a recount of events. The crew reviewed 600 hours of interviews from 200 veterans and 100 hours of original film footage to make the film. The title was inspired by the line \"They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old\" from the 1914 poem \"[[For the Fallen]]\" by [[Laurence Binyon]], famous for being used in the Ode of Remembrance.\n\n''They Shall Not Grow Old'' premiered simultaneously at the [[BFI London Film Festival]] and in selected cinemas in the UK on 16 October 2018, before airing on [[BBC Two]] on 11 November 2018 (the hundredth anniversary of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]]); it received a limited US release on 17 December.

The spelling of the commote varied widely, as the Cardiff Records show:<ref name=\"Hopkins222\">Hopkins (1975), p. 222.</ref>\n{|\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*''Rhoddeni'' (1203)\n*''Rotheni'' (1213)\n*''Glyn Rhoddni'' (1268)\n*''Glenrotheney'' (1314)\n*''Glynroddne'' (1314)\n|width=\"45\"|&nbsp;\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*''Glynroddney'' (1348)\n*''Glynrotheney'' (1440)\n*''Glynrothnei'' (1567)\n*''Glynrhoddeney'' (1591)\n*''Glynronthey'' (1666)\n|width=\"45\"|&nbsp;\n|}\nMany sources state the meaning of Rhondda as \"noisy\", though this is a simplified translation without research. Sir [[Ifor Williams]], in his work ''Enwau Lleoedd'', suggests that the first syllable ''rhawdd'' is a form of the Welsh ''adrawdd'' or ''adrodd'', as in \"recite, relate, recount\", similar to the [[Old Irish]] ''r\u00e1d''; 'speech'.<ref name=\"Hopkins222\"/><ref>[http://kimkat.org/amryw/1_vortaroy/geiriadur_cymraeg_saesneg_BAEDD_r_1026e.htm Gwefen Cymru-Catalonia] Kimkat.org</ref> The suggestion is that the river is speaking aloud, a comparison to the English expression \"a babbling brook\".<ref name=\"Hopkins222\"/>\n\nWith the increase in population from the mid-19th century the area was officially recognised as the Ystradyfodwg Local Government District, but was renamed in 1897 as the [[Rhondda (district)|Rhondda Urban District]] after the River Rhondda.<ref> {{Cite web |url=http://www.archivesnetworkwales.info/cgi-bin/anw/fulldesc_nofr?inst_id=33&coll_id=1798&expand= |title=Rhondda Urban District Council records |publisher=Archives Network Wales |author= |accessdate=19 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nResidents of either valley rarely use the terms Rhondda Fach or Rhondda Fawr, referring instead to the Rhondda, or their specific village when relevant. Locals tend to refer to \"The Rhondda\" with a [[definite article]] not found on signposts and maps.\n\n==Early history==\n===Prehistoric and Roman Rhondda: 8,000&nbsp;BC \u2013 410&nbsp;AD===\nThe Rhondda Valley is located in the upland, or Blaenau, area of [[Glamorgan]]. The landscape of the Rhondda was formed by [[Glacier|glacial]] action during the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]], as slow-moving glaciers gouged out the deep valleys that exist today. With the retreat of the ice sheet, around 8000 BC, the valleys were further modified by stream and river action. This left the two river valleys of the Rhondda with narrow, steep-sided slopes which would dictate the layout of settlements from early to modern times.<ref name=\"Davis5\">Davis (1989), p. 5.</ref>\n\n====Mesolithic period====\nThe earliest evidence of man's presence in these upper areas of Glamorgan was found in 1963 at Craig y Llyn. A small chipped stone tool found at the site, recorded as possibly being of [[Creswellian]] type or at least from the early [[Mesolithic]] period, places human activity on the plateau above the valleys.<ref name=\"Davis7\">Davis (1989), p. 7.</ref> Many other Mesolithic items have appeared in the Rhondda, mainly in the upper areas around [[Blaenrhondda]], [[Blaencwm]] and [[Maerdy]], and relating to hunting, fishing and foraging, which suggests seasonal [[nomad]]ic activity. Though no definite Mesolithic settlements have been located, the concentration of finds at the Craig y Llyn escarpment suggests the presence of a temporary campsite in the vicinity.<ref>{{Cite book |last= |first=|editor=Williams, Glanmor |title=Glamorgan County History, Volume II, Early Glamorgan: pre-history and early history |year=1984 |publisher=Glamorgan History Trust |location=Cardiff|page=57 |isbn=0-904730-04-2}}</ref>\n\n====Neolithic period====\nThe first structural relic of prehistoric man was excavated in 1973 at Cefn Glas near the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] of the Rhondda Fach river. The remains of a rectangular hut with traces of [[drystone wall]] foundations and [[posthole]]s was discovered; while [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon dating]] of charcoal found at the site dated the structure as late [[Neolithic]].<ref name=\"Davis7\"/>\n\n====Bronze Age====\n[[File:Llyn Fawr Reservoir.jpg|thumb|right|Llyn Fawr Reservoir in 2008]]\nAlthough little evidence of settlement has been found in the Rhondda for the Neolithic to [[Bronze Age]] periods, several [[cairn]]s and [[cist]]s have appeared throughout the length of both valleys. The best example of a round-cairn was found at Crug yr Afan, near the summit of Graig Fawr, west of [[Cwmparc]]. It consisted of an earthen mound with a surrounding ditch 28 metres in circumference and over 2 metres tall.<ref name=\"Davis11\">Davis (1989), p. 11.</ref> Although most cairns discovered in the area are round, a [[ring cairn]] or [[cairn circle]] exists on [[Gelli, Rhondda|Gelli]] Mountain.

The items did not originate from the Rhondda and are thought to have been left at the site as a [[votive]] offering. Of particular interest are fragments of an iron sword, the earliest iron object to be found in Wales, and the only C-type [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] sword recorded in Britain.<ref name=\"Davis9\">Davis (1989), p. 9.</ref>\n\n====Iron Age====\n[[File:Hen Drer Mynydd.jpg|thumb|left|The ruins of the Hen Dre'r Mynydd settlement at the head of the Rhondda]]\nWith the exception of the Neolithic settlement at Cefn Glas, there are three certain pre-medieval settlement sites in the valley \u2013 Maendy Camp, Hen Dre'r Gelli and Hen Dre'r Mynydd. The earliest of these is Maendy Camp, a [[hillfort]] whose remains lie between Ton Pentre and Cwmparc.<ref name=\"Davis14\">Davis (1989), p. 14.</ref> Although its defences would have been slight, the camp made good use of the natural slopes and rock outcrops to its north-east face. It consisted of two earthworks: an inner and outer enclosure. When the site was excavated in 1901, several archaeological finds led to the camp being misidentified as Bronze Age. These finds, mainly pottery and flint knives, were excavated from a burial cairn discovered within the outer enclosure, but the site has since been classified as from the [[Iron Age]].<ref name=\"Davis14\"/>\n\nThe settlement at Hen Dre'r Mynydd in Blaenrhondda was dated around the Roman period, when fragments of wheel-made [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]] pottery were discovered. The site consists of a group of ruinous drystone [[roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouses]] and enclosures, thought to have been a sheep-farming community.<ref name=\"Davis15\">Davis (1989), p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe most certain example of a Roman site in the area is found above Blaenllechau in [[Ferndale, Rhondda Cynon Taf|Ferndale]].<ref name=\"Davis16\">Davis (1989), p. 16.</ref> The settlement is one of a group of earthworks and indicates the presence of the Roman army during the 1st century AD. It was thought to be a military site or [[Castra|marching camp]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Roman frontier in Wales |last=Nash-Williams |first=V.E. |authorlink= |year=1959 |publisher=University of Wales Press |location=Cardiff |isbn= |page= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Medieval Rhondda: AD 410\u20131550===\nThe 5th century saw the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|withdrawal of Imperial Roman]] support from Britain, and succeeding centuries saw the emergence of national identity and of kingdoms. The area which would become the Rhondda lay within [[Glywysing]], which incorporated the modern area of Glamorgan and was ruled by a dynasty founded by [[Glywys]].<ref name=\"Davis17\">Davis (1989), p. 17</ref> This dynasty was replaced by another founded by [[Meurig ap Tewdrig]], whose descendant Morgan ap Owain would give Glamorgan its Welsh name Morgannwg.<ref>Wendy Davis (1982), ''Wales in the Early Middle Ages (Studies in the Early History of Britain)'', Leicester University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7185-1235-4}}, p. 102.</ref> With the coming of the [[Normans|Norman]] overlords after the 1066 [[Battle of Hastings]], south-east Wales was divided into five [[cantref]]i. The Rhondda lay within [[Penychen]], a narrow strip running between modern-day [[Glyn Neath]] and the coast between [[Cardiff]] and [[Aberthaw]]. Each cantref was further divided into [[commote]]s, with Penychen made up of five such commotes, one being Glynrhondda.<ref>William Rees (1951), ''An Historical Atlas of Wales from Early to Modern Times'', Faber & Faber {{ISBN|0-571-09976-9}}</ref>\n\nRelics of the Dark Ages are rare in the Glamorgan area and [[secular]] monuments still rarer. The few sites found have been located in the ''Bro'', or lowlands, leaving historians to believe the Blaenau were sparsely inhabited, maybe only visited seasonally by [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]].<ref name=\"Davis18\">Davis (1989), p. 18.</ref> A few [[Levee#Dike|earthwork dykes]] are the only structural relics in the Rhondda area from this period. No carved stones or crosses exist to indicate the presence of a Christian shrine. In the [[Early Middle Ages]], communities were split between bondmen, who lived in small villages centred on a court or ''llys'' of the local ruler to whom they paid dues, and freemen, with higher status, who lived in scattered homesteads. The most important village was the mayor's settlement or ''maerdref''. [[Maerdy]] in the Rhondda Fach has been identified as such, mainly on the strength of the name, though the village did not survive past the Middle Ages.<ref name=\"Davis18\"/> The largest concentration of dwellings from the period, mainly platform houses, have been found around Gelli and [[Ystrad Rhondda|Ystrad]] in the Rhondda Fawr.\n\nDuring the late 11th century, the [[Normans|Norman]] lord, [[Robert Fitzhamon]] entered Morgannwg in an attempt to gain control of the area, building many earth and timber castles in the lowlands.<ref name=\"Davis19\">Davis (1989), p. 19</ref> In the early 12th century Norman expansion continued, with castles being founded around [[Neath]], [[Kenfig]] and [[Coity Castle|Coity]].

Unlike the communal dwellings of the Iron Age, the remains of medieval buildings discovered in the area follow a pattern similar to modern farmsteads, with separate holdings spaced out around the hillsides. The evidence of medieval Welsh farmers comes from remains of their buildings, with the foundations of platform houses being discovered spaced out through both valleys.<ref name=\"Davis22\">Davis (1989), p. 22.</ref> When the sites of several platform houses at Gelligaer Common were excavated in the 1930s, [[potsherd]]s from the 13th to 14th centuries were discovered.<ref name=\"ArchCamba363\"> {{Cite book |author=Aileen Fox |title=Early Welsh Homesteads on Gelligaer Common, Glamorgan.

The castle comprises a scarp and ditch forming a raised platform and on the north face is a ruined dry-stone building. Its location and form do not appear to be Norman and it is thought to have been built by the Welsh as a border defence, which would date it before 1247, when [[Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford|Richard de Clare]] seized Glynrhondda.<ref name=\"Davis25\">Davis (1989), p. 25.</ref> The second castle is Ynysygrug, close to what is now [[Tonypandy]] town centre.

The historian Rice Merrick, in describing the upland area of the Vale of Glamorgan, stated that there \"was always great breeding of cattle, horses and sheep; but in elder time therein grew but small store of corn, for in most places there the ground was not thereunto apt.\" The English cartographer [[John Speed]] described the rearing of cattle as the \"best means unto wealth that the Shire doth afford.\"<ref>''Glamorgan County History, Volume IV, Early Modern Glamorgan from the Act of Union to the Industrial Revolution'', Glanmor Williams, pp. 2\u20133.

However, to be self-supporting, the farmers of the area grew crops such as oats, corn and barley in small quantities. Crops were grown in the lower part of the Rhondda on narrow meadows adjoining the riversides, though during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] scarce supplies forced the cultivation of the upland areas such as [[Wattstown|Carn-y-wiwer]] and Penrhys.<ref name=\"Lewis18-20\">Lewis (1959), pp. 18\u201320.</ref> Merrick would describe the diet of the upland inhabitants as consisting of \"bread made of wheat ... and ale and bear\" ''[sic]''<ref name=\"Davis29\"/> and over two hundred years later Benjamin Malkin showed how little the diet had changed when he wrote that the people still ate \"oatmeal bread, with a relish of miserable cheese; and the beer, where they have any, is worse than none.\"<ref>Benjamin Malkin (1807), ''The Scenery, Antiquities & Biography of South Wales'', Longman, Hurst, Rees and Orme.</ref>\n\nIn the first half of the 17th century, rising costs of consumable goods and successive bad harvests brought economic change in Glamorgan.<ref name=\"Davis29\"/> Those wealthy enough could seize opportunities created by the unsettled conditions and set about enlarging and enclosing farmlands.

This appears in the structures built in the Rhondda Valley.<ref name=\"Davis38\">Davis (1989), p. 38</ref> The fluctuating economy of the late [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] period resulted in farmers taking in more land, creating higher levels of surplus goods and so producing higher profits. These were reflected in new farmhouses built in the Rhondda and for the first time an emphasis on domestic comfort apparent in the design of dwellings.<ref name=\"Davis38\"/> Many new farm buildings were simple structures of two or three small rooms, but of a much sturdier,more permanent quality than the medieval platform houses. A popular style was the [[Dartmoor longhouse]], which combined the house and cowshed into one building. By 1840, the Rhondda had at least 160 farms,<ref name=\"Davis40\">Davis (1989), p. 40.</ref> but most were destroyed with the growth of the mining industry.

Although neighbouring areas such as [[Merthyr]] and [[Aberdare]] had already sunk coal mines, it was not until [[Walter Coffin]] initiated the [[Dinas Rhondda|Dinas]] Lower Colliery in 1812 that coal was exported from the Rhondda Valleys on any commercial scale.<ref name=\"Davies 746\"/> This was originally taken by [[packhorse]], before the extension of [[Richard Griffiths (industrialist)|Dr. Griffiths']] private tramline, to [[Pontypridd]] and then by the [[Glamorganshire Canal]] to the port at Cardiff. The lack of transportation links was one of the main problems that curtailed exploitation of the Rhondda Valley coalfields, along with the belief that they lay too deep for economic working.<ref name=\"John182\">John (1980), p. 182.</ref> It was therefore seen as an expensive risk. Exploration of the Rhondda was undertaken by the Bute Trustees, agents of the [[John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute|third Marquess of Bute]], who not only owned large tracts of valley farmland but also possessed a large financial interest in the [[Cardiff Docks]] which would export the coal.<ref name=\"John182\"/> The trustees sank the [[Bute Merthyr Colliery]] in October 1851, at the top of the Rhondda Fawr in what would become [[Treherbert]]. The Bute Merthyr began producing coal in 1855, as the first working steam-coal colliery in the Rhondda.<ref name=\"Davies 746\"/>\n\nAlong with the sinking of the first colliery at the head of the Rhondda, a second issue, transportation, was tackled with the extension of the [[Taff Vale Railway]] (TVR); royal assent was given in 1836.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.trackbed.com/companies/t/tvr/dsmbarrie/tvr_dsmbarrie.htm |title=The Taff Vale Railway |author=Barrie, D.S.M. |work= |publisher=trackbed.com |accessdate=12 September 2010}}</ref> The original line was laid from Cardiff to [[Abercynon]], and by 1841 a branch was opened to link Cardiff with Dinas via Pontypridd. This allowed easier transportation for Walter Coffin's Dinas mine, an unsurprising addition, as Coffin was a director of the TVR. In 1849 the TVR extended into the Rhondda Fach and by 1856 the railway had reached the furthest areas of the Fach and Fawr valleys at Maerdy and Treherbert. For the first time, the Rhondda Valley was linked by a major transportation route to the rest of Wales<ref name=\"John182\" /> and exploitation of its coalfields could begin.\n\nThe TVR line dominated coal transportation through the Rhondda's industrial history. Its monopoly was a bone of contention: the absence of rivals precluded colliery owners from negotiating lower haulage rates.<ref name=\"John454\">John (1980), p. 454.</ref> Attempts were made to break the monopoly included the opening of the [[Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway]] between 1885 and 1895,<ref name=awdry>Awdry (1990), p. 1.</ref> which linked Blaenrhondda at the head of the Rhondda Fawr to the [[Prince of Wales Dock, Swansea|Prince of Wales Dock]]. To achieve this the Rhondda Tunnel<ref name=\"John455\">John (1980), p. 455.</ref> was dug through Mynydd Blaengwynfy to [[Blaengwynfi]] \u2013 at the time the longest railway tunnel in Wales.\n\nInitially the shallower pits at Aberdare proved a bigger attraction to prospective mine owners, but once Aberdare became fully worked by the 1860s, the Rhondda saw rapid growth. During the 1860s and the 1870s, 20 Rhondda Valley collieries opened, with the leading owner in the Rhondda Fach being [[David Davis, Maesyffynnon (coal owner)|David Davis]] of Aberdare, and [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies]] in the Rhondda Fawr.<ref name=\"John182\"/> In 1865 the coal output from the Rhondda Valley was roughly one-quarter of that of Aberdare; ten years later the Rhondda was producing over two million tons more than the Aberdare valleys. These figures would later be dwarfed by massive excavation rates in the last quarter of the 19th century and up to the First World War. In 1913, Rhondda Valley output was 9.6 million tons.<ref name=\"John183\">John (1980), p. 183</ref>\n\nBy 1893 there were more than 75 collieries in the Rhondda Valleys. Initially most were owned by a small group of individuals,<ref name=\"John192\">John (1980), p. 192</ref> but the trend changed towards the start of the 20th century, as companies began buying up existing collieries. The widespread adoption of [[limited liability]] status began a trend towards concentration of ownership,<ref name=\"John193\">John (1980), p. 193.</ref> reducing some of the economic risks involved in coalmining: unstable coal prices, inflated acquisitions, geological difficulties, and large-scale accidents.<ref name=\"John192-3\">John (1980), pp. 192\u2013193.</ref> The emerging companies were formed by the individuals and families who sank the original collieries, but by the start of the 20th century they were no more than principal shareholders.

In 1841 the parish of [[Ystradyfodwg]], which would later constitute most of the Rhondda Borough, recorded a population of less than a thousand.<ref name=\"Davies 746\"/> With the discovery of massive deposits of high quality, accessible coal in the mid-19th century, the valleys experienced a large influx of financial immigrants. The first came to the lower Rhondda villages of Dinas, Eirw and Cymmer. Special sinkers came from [[Llansamlet]], while the first miners were from [[Penderyn, Rhondda Cynon Taf|Penderyn]], [[Cwmgwrach]] and neighbouring areas of [[Llantrisant]] and [[Llanharan]].<ref name=\"Hopkins112\">Hopkins (1975), p. 112.</ref> The 1851 Census lists apprenticed paupers from [[Temple Cloud]] in Somerset, some of the earliest English immigrants.<ref name=\"Hopkins112\"/> From a mere 951 in 1851, the population of Ystradyfodwg parish grew to 16,914 in 1871. By 1901 the Rhondda Urban District had a population of 113,735.<ref>Williams (1996), p. 15.</ref> As more and more coal mines were sunk the population grew to fill the jobs needed to extract the coal. In the 1860s and 1870s the majority came from neighbouring Welsh counties, but with the improving rail transportation and cheaper transport, immigrants came from further afield. The 1890s recorded workers from the South West, places such as Gloucester and Devon, and by the 1900s people came from North Wales, the lead-mining area of [[Anglesey]] and the depressed [[slate]]-quarrying villages of [[Bethesda, Gwynedd|Bethesda]], [[Ffestiniog]] and [[Dinorwig]].<ref name=\"Hopkins113\">Hopkins (1975), p. 113</ref> Although there are records of Scottish workers, mainly centred on Archibald Hood's Llwynypia mines, there were only small numbers of Irish, less than 1,000 by 1911.<ref name=\"Hopkins114\">Hopkins (1975), p. 114.</ref> This absence is often blamed on the forcible ejection of the Irish who lived in Treherbert during three days of rioting in 1857.<ref name=\"Hopkins206\">Hopkins (1975), p. 206</ref> The population of the valleys peaked in 1924 at over 167,900 inhabitants.<ref name=\"Davies 746\"/>\n\nThe mass immigration in the period was almost entirely from other parts of Wales and from England.<ref>1911 Census, of those who answered: Welsh 90.28%, English 8.23%, Irish and Scottish 0.92%, rest of world 0.58%.</ref> A notable exception was a group of Italian immigrants, originally from northern Italy round the town of [[Bardi, Emilia-Romagna|Bardi]]. In the late 19th century, they were forced out of London by over-saturation of the market, and instead set up a network of caf\u00e9s, [[ice cream parlor|ice cream parlours]] and [[Fish and chips|fish & chip shops]] throughout South Wales. These became iconic landmarks in the villages they served and they and subsequent generations became [[Welsh Italians]]. Peculiar to the Rhondda was that shops run by Italian immigrants were known as bracchis, believed to have been named after Angelo Bracchi, who opened the first caf\u00e9 there in the early 1890s.<ref name=\"Davies408\">Davies (2008), p. 408</ref> In the early 21st century several of the Rhondda's original bracchis were still open for business.\n\n===Decline of coal and economic emigration (1914\u20131944)===\n{{see also|Great Depression in the United Kingdom}}\n[[File:Miners' Statue, Rhondda.jpg|thumb|right|Commemorative statue to the \"Mining Communities of Rhondda\" [[Robert Thomas (sculptor)|Robert Thomas]] (1926-1999)]]\nAt the start of the [[First World War]], the economic prospects in South Wales were good. Although production fell after the 1913 high, demand was still strong enough to push the coalfields to their limit.<ref name=\"John519\">John (1980), p. 519</ref> In February 1917 coal mining came under government control and demand increased as the war intensified, ensuring a market for sufficient supplies.<ref name=\"John519\"/> After the war the picture began to change. Initially the British coal industry was buoyed by a series of fortuitous economic events, such as the American coal miners' strike, and by 1924 unemployment for miners was below the national average. But the belief that the mining industry would experience a permanent demand for coal was shattered by the [[Depression (economic)|Depression]], when the Rhondda experienced a massive increase in unemployment.<ref name=\"Davies748\">Davies (2008), p. 748.</ref> The situation worsened in 1926, when in response to coalowners reducing pay and lengthening working hours of miners,<ref name=\"Morgan100\">Morgan (1988), p. 100.</ref> the [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] called a [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|general strike]] in defence of the miners [[Lockout (industry)|locked out]] following [[A. J. Cook (trade unionist)|A. J. Cook's]] call \"not a penny off the pay, not a minute on the day\".<ref name=\"Morgan101\">Morgan (1988), p. 101.</ref> The TUC called off the strike just nine days later, without resolving the miners' cut in wages. The miners disagreed and stayed on strike for a further seven months until they were starved into surrender. The Rhondda saw many schemes set up by miners to aid their plight, such as [[soup kitchen]]s and [[f\u00eate]]s and \"joy\" days to support them,<ref>Wales in the Twentieth Century World: Family on the Dole 1919\u20131939; Mid Glamorgan County Council Education Department (1994) pp. 3\u20134.</ref> while in Maerdy the local miners set up a rationing system.<ref name=\"Morgan101\"/> By the time the miners returned to work, there was little desire for further action, which saw a decline in the popularity of 'The Fed'<ref name=\"Morgan101\"/> and greater emphasis on solving problems by political and parliamentary means.<ref name=\"Morgan102\">Morgan (1988), p. 102</ref>\n\nWith the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]], employment in the Rhondda Valleys continued to fall. This in turn led to a decline in public and social services, as people struggled to pay rates and rents.<ref name=\"John541\">John (1980), p. 541</ref> One outcome of the lack of funds was a fall in health provisions, which in Rhondda lead to a shortage of medical and nursing staff,<ref name=\"John542\">John (1980), p. 542.</ref> a failure to provide adequate sewage works, and a rise in deaths from [[tuberculosis]].<ref name=\"John543\">John (1980), p. 543.</ref> By 1932 the long-term unemployment figure in the Rhondda was put at 63 per cent,<ref name=\"John539\">John (1980), p. 539.</ref> and in Ferndale at almost 73 per cent.<ref name=\"Davies748\"/>\n\nWith little other employment available in the Rhondda,<ref name=\"John518\">John (1980), p. 518.</ref> the only solution appeared to be emigration. Between 1924 and 1939, 50,000 people left the Rhondda. During this time life was difficult for communities built solely around a singular industry, especially as most families were on a single wage.\n\nThe start of the [[Second World War]] saw a turnaround in the employment figures, and by 1944 unemployment figures in the Rhondda ranged from 1 per cent in Treorchy to 3.7 per cent at Tonypandy.<ref name=\"John563\">John (1980), p. 563.</ref>\n\n===Mining disasters===\n[[File:Lewis Merthyr Colliery.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The Lewis Merthyr Colliery, now part of the Rhondda Heritage Park]]\nThe possibility of serious injury or death was an everyday risk for the mine workers of the Rhondda Valley. The most notorious form of [[Mining accident|colliery disaster]] was the [[gas explosion]],<ref name=\"Davies160\">Davies (2008), p. 160.</ref> caused by a buildup either of [[methane]] gas or [[coal dust]]. As mines became deeper and ventilation harder to control, the risk increased. The worst single incident in the Rhondda was the 1867 Ferndale disaster, when an explosion took 178 lives.

There was a sense of salvation when the government announced the [[National Coal Board|nationalisation of the British coal mines]] in 1947, but subsequent decades saw continual output reductions. From 15,000 miners in 1947, Rhondda had just a single pit within the valleys producing coal in 1984, located at Maerdy.<ref name=\"Davies748\"/> The decline in coal mining after World War II was a countrywide issue, but South Wales and Rhondda were more gravely affected than other areas. Oil had superseded coal as the fuel of choice in many industries and there was political pressure behind the oil supply.<ref name=\"John590\">John (1980), p. 590.</ref> From the few industries still reliant on coal, the demand was for high quality, especially [[Coke (fuel)|coking coal]] for the steel industry. By then, 50 per cent of Glamorgan coal was supplied to [[Steel mill|steelworks]],<ref name=\"John595\">John (1980), p. 595.</ref> with the second biggest market being domestic heating: the \"smokeless\" fuel of the Rhondda became once again fashionable after publication of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]].<ref name=\"John596\">John (1980), p. 596.</ref> These two markets controlled the fate of the mines in the Rhondda, and as demand fell from both, the effect was further contraction. In addition, exports to other areas of Europe such as France, Italy and the [[Low Countries]] experienced sharp decline: from 33 per cent of output around the start of the 20th century to some 5 per cent by 1980.<ref name=\"John596\"/>\n\nOther major factors in the decline of coal related to massive under-investment in the Rhondda mines over the previous decades.

In the early 19th century there were only three places of worship in the Rhondda; the parish church (now dedicated to St John the Baptist) and the Cymmer and Ynysfach chapels. This changed rapidly after 1855 as coal mining brought an influx of population, and by 1905 there were 151 chapels in the valley.<ref name=\"Morgan252\">Morgan (1988), p. 252.</ref>\n\nChapel life was central to valley life throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but as with many communities throughout Britain, the post-war periods saw a decline in regular membership. To an extent the number of places of worship declined with the population, but this was exacerbated in the Rhondda by a swift decline in the number of Welsh speakers. Welsh-language chapels in particular saw a sharp drop in membership from the 1950s, and many closed in the next half-century. By 1990 the Rhondda had less than 50 places of worship and many premises had been demolished.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.therhondda.co.uk/general/churches.html |title=Rhondda Places of Worship |work=LSJ Services [Wales] Ltd |publisher=TheRhondda.co.uk |accessdate=19 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930231847/http://www.therhondda.co.uk/general/churches.html |archive-date=2011-09-30 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Political activism==\n[[File:AJ Cook banner.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Lodge banner depicting Unionist [[A.

In the 1870s the [[Amalgamated Association of Miners]] won support, but was destroyed by employer hostility. The Cambrian Miners' Association was more successful and the creation of the [[South Wales Miners' Federation]] after the [[Welsh coal strike of 1898|1898 coal strike]] gave South Wales miners a reputation for [[Militant (word)|militancy]], in which the Rhondda Valley played its part.<ref name=\"Lewis172-173\">Lewis (1959), pp. 172\u2013173.</ref>\n\nAs part of the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885|Redistribution Act]] of 1885 the Rhondda was granted its first seat in Parliament, which was won by a moderate trade union leader, [[William Abraham (Welsh politician)|William Abraham]], who was notably the only working-class member elected in Wales.<ref name=\"Davies650\">Davies (2008), p. 650.</ref> [[Socialism]] and [[syndicalism]] grew in the 20th century and industrial struggle reached a crescendo in the 1910\u20131911 [[Tonypandy riots]].<ref name=\"Morgan62\">Morgan (1988), p. 62</ref> A year later Tonypandy saw the publication of [[Noah Ablett]]'s pamphlet \"[[The Miners' Next Step]]\".

The [[Encyclopaedia of Wales]] notes that the image of the [[Welsh Mam]], a wife and mother constantly at home and exalted as the queen of the household, was essentially a Rhondda creation.<ref name=\"Davies 746\">Davies (2008), p. 746.</ref> However the Rhondda did produce the [[suffragette]] and social reformer [[Elizabeth Andrews]],<ref name=\"Davies 746\"/> one of only nine women among a list of a hundred great Welsh heroes chosen by ballot in 2004.<ref>[http://www.100welshheroes.com/en/top100 100 Welsh Heroes] Ranked at number 100.</ref>\n\n===Sport===\nSocial amenities were rudimentary even before the Rhondda Urban District Council was formed in 1897. Due to the geographic layout of the valleys, land was a scarce resource, and so leisure pursuits that took up little space, time and money were sought. This resulted in activities such as [[greyhound]] racing, cockfighting, open-air handball (often attached to a [[public house]]), boxing, foot racing and rugby union.<ref name=\"Smith103\">Smith (1980), p. 103.</ref>\n[[File:Dai Tarw Jones.jpg|thumb|125px|right|Dai 'Tarw' Jones]]\n\n====Rugby union====\nDuring the mid-19th century the influx of immigrants from older mining towns such as Aberdare and Merthyr brought the game of [[rugby union|rugby]] with them. At Treherbert it took a five-month [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]] in 1875 to see the game establish itself at the various collieries where the Amalgamated Association of Miners held their meetings.<ref name=\"Smith102\">Smith (1980), p. 102</ref> In 1877 [[Penygraig RFC|Penygraig Rugby Football Club]] was formed, followed by [[Treherbert RFC|Treherbert]] in 1879, [[Ferndale RFC|Ferndale]] in 1882, [[Treorchy RFC|Treorchy]] in 1886 and [[Tylorstown RFC|Tylorstown]] in 1903.

The valley clubs had no clubhouses, with most teams meeting and changing in the closest local public house.<ref name=\"Morgan393\">Morgan (1988), p. 393.</ref> Many clubs built around colliery and pub teams appeared and disbanded, but many others survive to this day.\n\n====Football====\nDue to the dominance of rugby union, there have been few [[Association football|football]] teams of note in the history of the Rhondda Valleys. Several teams were formed around the end of the 19th century, but most folded in the Depression, including Cwmparc F.C. in 1926<ref name=\"Morgan396\">Morgan (1988), p. 396.</ref> and [[Mid Rhondda F.C.|Mid-Rhondda]] in 1928.<ref name=\"Morgan396\"/> The area's most successful club is [[Ton Pentre F.C.]]\n\n===Music===\nThe [[temperance movement]], absorbed into the moralistic system of the Nonconformist chapels, caused a shift in social attitudes in the mid to late-19th and early 20th century Rhondda. Alcohol was looked down on and so were the increasingly violent sports such as rugby,<ref name=\"Smith120\">Smith (1980), p. 120</ref> so that many young men sought more acceptable pastimes. Voice choirs were a natural progression from chapel society and brass bands eventually gained acceptance by the movement.\n\n====Male voice choirs====\nThe male-voice choirs of Welsh industrial communities are believed to have derived from [[glee clubs]]. The Rhondda produced several choirs of note, including the Rhondda Glee Society, which represented Wales at the World Fair [[eisteddfod]].<ref name=\"Morgan374\">Morgan (1988), p. 374.</ref> The rival [[Treorchy Male Choir|Treorchy Male Voice Choir]] also enjoyed success at eisteddfodau, and in 1895, the original choir sang before Queen Victoria.<ref name=\"Morgan374\"/> Many choirs still exist, including the Cambrian Male voice choir in Tonypandy and the Cor Meibion Morlais in Ferndale.\n\n====Brass bands====\nThe mid-19th century [[brass band]]s had a poor relationship with the Nonconformist chapels, mainly due to the heavy social drinking that came hand in hand with being a member.<ref name=\"Davies80\">Davies (2008), p. 80</ref> This changed towards the end of the 19th century, when on becoming more respectable, many bands had actually joined the temperance movement. Two Rhondda brass bands which both started as temperance bands are the [[Cory Band]] from [[Ton Pentre]], who started life as ''Ton Temperance'' in 1884;<ref>[http://www.rhondda-cynon-taff.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/hcst/content.hcst?lang=en&textonly=on&dDocName=021583 Blue Plaque Scheme Announced]{{dead link |date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} Rhondda Cynon Taf Council website.</ref> and the Parc and Dare Band, formerly the ''Cwmparc Drum and Fife Temperance Band''.<ref> {{Cite web |url=http://www.brassbands.co.uk/history.htm |title=A History of the Parc and Dare Band |publisher=brassbands.co.uk |first=Lawrence |last=Harries |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref> The oldest in Rhondda is the Lewis-Merthyr Band, formerly Cymmer Colliery Band, founded as the Cymmer Military Band in or before 1855.<ref>[http://www.lewismerthyrband.com/about.htm{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} Lewis-Merthyr Band website.</ref>\n\nAs the temperance movement faded, the bands found new benefactors in the colliery owners and many took on the names of specific collieries. A memorable image of the connection between the collieries and brass bands came in 1985, when the Maerdy miners were filmed returning to work after the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|miners' strike]], marching behind the village band.<ref name=\"Davies80\"/>\n\n====Songs====\n[[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], [[David Alexander (singer)|David Alexander]] and [[Paul Child (singer)|Paul Child]] have been among those who sang songs about the Rhondda.\n\n===Culture and nationality===\n====Language====\nFor most of its history, the Rhondda valleys were an exclusively Welsh-speaking area. Only in the early 20th century did English began to supplant Welsh as the first language of social intercourse.<ref name=\"Hopkins179\">Hopkins (1975), p. 179.</ref> In 1803, English historian [[Benjamin Heath Malkin]] mentioned that while travelling through Ystradyfodwg he had met only one person with whom he could talk, and then with the help of an interpreter.<ref name=\"Hopkins179\"/> This experience was repeated by [[John George Wood]], who on a visit complained of the awkwardness of understanding the particular dialects and idioms used by the native speakers, which were difficult for other Welsh speakers to understand.<ref name=\"Hopkins180\">Hopkins (1975), p. 180.</ref> This dialect was once called \"tafodiaith gw\u0177r y Gloran\" (the dialect of Gloran men).\n\nAs industrialisation began, there was still little shift in the use of Welsh. Initial immigrants were Welsh: it was not until the 1900s that English workers began settling in any great numbers, and in any case it was not these new workers who changed the language. The erosion of Welsh had begun in the 1860s in the school classrooms. The educational philosophy accepted by schoolmasters and governmental administrators was that English was the language of scholars and Welsh a barrier to moral and commercial prosperity.<ref name=\"Hopkins212\">Hopkins (1975), p. 212.</ref> In 1901, 35.4 per cent of Rhondda workers spoke only English, but by 1911 this had risen to 43.1 per cent, while Welsh-speaking monoglots had fallen from 11.4 to 4.4 per cent in the same period.<ref name=\"Hopkins209\">Hopkins (1975), p. 209.</ref>\n\nThorough anglicization of the Rhondda Valleys took place between 1900 to 1950. Improved transport and communications facilitated the spread of cultural influences, along with dealings with outside companies with no understanding of Welsh, trade union meetings being held in English, and the coming of radio, cinema and then television and cheap English newspapers and [[paperback]] books. All these were factors in the absorption of the English language.<ref name=\"Hopkins213\">Hopkins (1975), p. 213.</ref>\n\n====Cadwgan Circle====\nThough the population of the Rhondda was embracing English as its first language, a literary and intellectual movement formed in the Rhondda in the 1940s that would produce an influential group of [[Welsh language]] writers. The group formed during the Second World War by Egyptologist [[J. Gwyn Griffiths]] and his German wife [[K\u00e4the Bosse-Griffiths]] was known as the Cadwgan Circle ('''{{ill|Cylch Cadwgan|cy}}''') and met at the Griffiths' house in [[Pentre]]. Welsh writers who made up the movement included [[Pennar Davies]], [[Rhydwen Williams]], [[James Kitchener Davies]] and [[Gareth Alban Davies]].\n\n[[File:Gorsedd Stones, Treorchy.JPG|right|thumb|Treorchy Gorsedd Stones]]\n====National Eisteddfod====\nThe Rhondda has hosted the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales|National Eisteddfod]] on only one occasion, in [[1928 in Wales|1928]] at [[Treorchy]]. The [[Gorsedd stones]] that were placed to mark the event still stand on the Maindy hillside overlooking Treorchy and Cwmparc.

In 1899, the Rhondda Valley was served by the ''Pontypridd and Rhondda Weekly Post'' while the ''Rhondda Post'' was also in circulation in 1898.\n\nThe ''[[Rhondda Leader]]'', one of the more familiar local papers, appeared in 1899<ref> {{Cite web |url=http://www.britishpapers.co.uk/wales/rhondda-leader |title=Rhondda Leader |author= |work= |publisher=British Newspapers Online |accessdate=12 September 2010}}</ref> and nine years later became the ''Rhondda Leader, Maesteg, Garw and Ogmore Telegraph''.

The original road layout followed the valleys, with few links between them.

These had a lasting effect and transformed the valleys from being dead-end communities.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1928/may/22/glamorgan-inter-valley-road |title=Glamorgan Inter-Valley Road |work=Hansard |date=22 May 1928 |accessdate=5 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/19th-november-1929/46/a-swansea-appeal-disallowed |title=Expediting Traffic in Wales |work=Commercial Motor |date=19 November 1929 |accessdate=5 August 2015}}</ref> In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, new road projects such as the [[Rhondda by-pass]] were created out of former railway lines.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/6974274.stm |title=Morgan opens \u00a398m Rhondda by-pass |work=BBC News |date=3 September 2007 |accessdate=25 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nTwo main roads service the area. The [[A4058]] runs through the Rhondda Fawr and the [[A4233]] services the Rhondda Fach. The A4058 starts at [[Pontypridd]] runs through Porth before ending at Treorchy, where it joins the [[A4061]] to Hirwaun. The A4233 begins outside Rhondda at [[Tonyrefail]], heading north through Porth and through the Rhondda Fach to Maerdy, where the road links up with the [[A4059]] at Aberdare. Two other A roads service the area; the [[A4119]] is a relief road known as the Tonypandy Bypass; the other is the [[A4061]], which links Treorchy to the [[Ogmore Vale]] before reaching Bridgend.\n\nThere is a single rail link to the Rhondda, the [[Rhondda Line]], based around the old [[Taff Vale Railway]], which serviced both the Rhondda Fach and Rhondda Fawr. The Rhondda Line runs through the Rhondda Fawr, linking Rhondda to [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff Central]]. The railway stations that once populated the Rhondda Fach were all closed under the [[Beeching Axe]].

The earliest individuals to come to the fore were linked with the coal industry and the people; physical men who found a way out of the Rhondda through sport; and charismatic orators who led the miners through unions or political and religious leaders who tended to the deeply religious chapel going public.\n\n===Sport===\n[[File:Jimmy Wilde.jpg|thumb|Boxer, Jimmy Wilde]]\nThe two main sports with which the Rhondda appeared to produce quality participants were rugby union and [[boxing]]. One of the first true rugby stars to come from the Rhondda was [[Willie Llewellyn]], who not only gained 20 caps for [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] scoring 48 points but was also the first Rhondda-born member of the [[British and Irish Lions|British Lions]]. Such was Llewellyn's fame that during the [[Tonypandy riots]], his pharmacy was left unscathed by the crowds due to his past sporting duties. Many players came through the Rhondda to gain international duty, and after the split between amateur rugby union and the professional [[rugby league|Northern League]], many were also tempted to the North of England to earn a wage for their abilities. Amongst the new league players was [[Jack Rhapps]], Aberaman-born, but living in the Rhondda when he went north, to become the world's first dual-code international rugby player.\n\nThe most famous rugby player from the Rhondda in the latter half of the 20th century is [[Cliff Morgan]]. Morgan was born in [[Trebanog]] and gained 29 caps for Wales, four for the British Lions and was one of the inaugural inductees of the [[International Rugby Hall of Fame]]. Another notable player is [[Billy Cleaver]] from [[Treorchy]], a member of the [[1950 Five Nations Championship|1950 Grand Slam]] winning team. [[Maurice Richards]], born in Tynntyla Road, Ystrad Rhondda, was a Welsh international and British Lion of note, still known today for his scoring achievements playing in this code. \n\nDuring the 20th century the Rhondda supplied a steady stream of championship boxers. [[Percy Jones (boxer)|Percy Jones]] was not only the first World Champion from the Rhondda, but the first Welshman to hold a World Title when he won the Flyweight belt in 1914. After Jones came the Rhondda's most notable boxer, [[Jimmy Wilde]], also known as the \"Mighty Atom\", who took the [[International Boxing Union (1913\u20131946)|IBU]] world flyweight title in 1916. British Champions from the valleys include [[Tommy Farr]], who held the British and Empire heavyweight belt, and [[Llew Edwards]], who took the British featherweight and Australian lightweight titles.\n\nAlthough [[association football]] was not so popular as rugby in the Rhondda in the early 20th century, after the 1920s several notable players emerged from the area. Two of the most important came from the village of [[Ton Pentre]]; [[Jimmy Murphy (footballer)|Jimmy Murphy]] was capped 15 times for Wales, and in 1958 managed both the Welsh national team and [[Manchester United]]. [[Roy Paul]], also from Ton Pentre, led Manchester City to two successive [[FA Cup]] finals in 1955 and 1956 and gained 33 Welsh caps. [[Alan Curtis (footballer)|Alan Curtis]], who was best known for representing [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], came from the neighbouring village of [[Pentre]], and in an 11-year international career won 35 caps for Wales, scoring six goals.\n\nThe Rhondda Valleys have produced two world-class darts players. In 1975 [[Alan Evans (darts player)|Alan Evans]] from Ferndale won the [[Winmau World Masters]], a feat repeated in 1994 by [[Richie Burnett]] from Cwmparc. Burnett surpassed Evans when he also became [[BDO World Darts Championship|BDO World Darts Champion]], winning the tournament in [[1995 BDO World Darts Championship|1995]].\n\n===Politics===\n[[File:Leanne Wood Senedd.jpg|thumb|Leanne Wood, from [[Penygraig]]]]\n[[D. A. Thomas]], active in the area as an industrialist and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician, received the titles of ''Baron Rhondda'' in 1916 and ''[[Viscount Rhondda]]'' in 1918. Despite not being born in the Rhondda, the two most notable political figures to emerge from the area are [[William Abraham (Welsh politician)|William Abraham]], known as Mabon, and [[George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy|George Thomas, Viscount Tonypandy]]. Abraham, best known as a trade unionist, was the first Member of Parliament of the Rhondda and the leader of the South Wales Miners' Federation. A strong negotiator in the early years of valley unionism, he lost ground as a moderate to more radical leaders in his later years. Thomas was born in Port Talbot, but raised in Trealaw near Tonypandy. He was a Member of Parliament for Cardiff for 38 years and Speaker of the House of Commons (1976\u20131983). On his retirement from politics, he received the title of ''Viscount Tonypandy''.\n\n[[Leanne Wood]], the former leader of [[Plaid Cymru]] was born in the Rhondda.\n\n===Film and television===\nThe best-known actors born in the Rhondda have been Sir [[Stanley Baker]] and the brothers [[Donald Houston|Donald]] and [[Glyn Houston]]. Baker was born in Ferndale and starred in films such as ''[[The Cruel Sea (1953 film)|The Cruel Sea]]'' (1953) and ''[[Richard III (1955 film)|Richard III]]'' (1955), though it was as actor/producer of the 1964 film [[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]] that his legacy endures.<ref>Davies (2008) p. 47.</ref> The Houston brothers were born in Tonypandy, with Donald gaining the greater success as a film actor, with memorable roles in ''[[The Blue Lagoon (1949 film)|The Blue Lagoon]]'' (1949) and Ealing's ''[[Dance Hall (1950 film)|Dance Hall]]'' (1950).<ref name=\"Davies378\">Davies (2008) p. 378.</ref> Glyn Houston acted primarily in British B-Movies and was better known as a television actor.<ref name=\"Davies378\"/>\n\n===Literature===\nOf the Cadwgan Circle, the most notable is [[Rhydwen Williams]], winner of the Eisteddfod Crown on two occasions, who used the landscape of the industrial valleys as a basis for much of his work. Writing in English, [[Peter George (author)|Peter George]] was born in Treorchy and is best known as the Oscar-nominated screenwriter of [[Dr. Strangelove]], based on his book [[Red Alert (novel)|Red Alert]]. Reflecting the lives of the residents of the Rhondda, both [[Gwyn Thomas (novelist)|Gwyn Thomas]] and [[Ron Berry]] brought a realism to the industrial valleys missing in the more rose-tinted writings of [[Richard Llewellyn]].\n\n===Visual arts===\nThe area has not produced as notable a group of visual artists as it has writers, though in the 1950s a small group of students, brought together through a daily commute by train to the [[Cardiff College of Art]], came to prominence as the Rhondda Group.<ref name=\"BBC profile\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/ernest-zobole |title=Walesart, Ernest Zobole |work=BBC Wales online |accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref> Although it did not set up a school or have a manifesto, the group, which included Charles Burton, Ceri Barclay, Glyn Morgan, Thomas Hughes, Gwyn Evans, Nigel Flower, David Mainwaring, Ernest Zobole and Robert Thomas, formed an important artistic movement in 20th-century Welsh art.\n\nThe notable members of the group include [[Ernest Zobole]], a painter from Ystrad, whose expressionist work was deeply rooted in the juxtaposition of the industrialised buildings of the valleys against the green hills that surround them.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-ernest-zobole-1130792.html Obituary: Ernest Zobole], Independent.co.uk, 7 December 1999.</ref> Also from the Rhondda Fawr was the sculptor [[Robert Thomas (sculptor)|Robert Thomas]];<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-robert-thomas-1094862.html Stephens, Meic; Obituary: Robert Thomas] independent.co.uk, 21 May 1999.</ref> born in Cwmparc, his heavy-cast statues have become icons of contemporary Wales, with many of his works publicly displayed in Cardiff.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-robert-thomas-1094862.html |title=Obituary: Robert Thomas |first=Meic |last=Stephens |accessdate=28 September 2017 |date=28 May 1999 |work=independent.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Science and social science===\nIn sciences and social sciences, the Rhondda has provided important academics for Wales and on the world stage. [[Donald Davies]], born in Treorchy in 1924, was the co-inventor of [[packet switching]], a process enabling the exchange of information between computers, a feature which enabled the Internet.<ref> {{Cite web |url=http://www.thocp.net/biographies/davies_donald.htm |title=Donald W. Davies CBE, FRS |work=The History of Computing Project |author= |accessdate=3 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the social sciences, the Rhondda has produced the historian [[John Davies (historian)|John Davies]], an important voice on Welsh affairs, who was one of the most recognised faces and voices of 21st-century Welsh history, and was one of the main authors of ''The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales''. The Rhondda has also produced [[J. Gwyn Griffiths]], an eminent Egyptologist, who was also a member of the Cadwgan Circle. Griffiths and his wife [[K\u00e4the Bosse-Griffiths]] were influential writers and curators in the history of Egyptian lore. It is where a cluster of three internationally-distinguished social geographers spent their early lives: [[Michael Dear]]; David Hebert;<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Herbert8.]</ref>; and [[Kelvyn Jones]]. All three are Fellows of the [[Learned Society of Wales]]<ref>[https://www.learnedsociety.wales/fellow/david-herbert/.]</ref><ref>[https://www.learnedsociety.wales/fellow/michael-dear/.]</ref><ref>https://www.learnedsociety.wales/fellow/kelvyn-jones/</ref>.

It is most noted for its historical coal-mining industry, which peaked between 1840 and 1925. The valleys produced a strong early [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]] Christian movement manifest in the [[Baptist]] chapels that moulded Rhondda values in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It is also famous for strong masculine cultural ties exemplified in its [[male voice choir]]s, sport and politics.\n\n==Rhondda Fawr==\n[[File:Rhondda Map.JPG|500px|right|thumb|A rough layout of the main villages of the Rhondda shown along the two tributaries of the River Rhondda]]\nThe larger of the two valleys, the Rhondda Fawr, extends from [[Porth]] and rises through the valley until it reaches [[Blaenrhondda]], near [[Treherbert]].

The landscape of the Rhondda was formed by [[Glacier|glacial]] action during the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]], as slow-moving glaciers gouged out the deep valleys that exist today. With the retreat of the ice sheet, around 8000 BC, the valleys were further modified by stream and river action. This left the two river valleys of the Rhondda with narrow, steep-sided slopes which would dictate the layout of settlements from early to modern times.<ref name=\"Davis5\">Davis (1989), p. 5.</ref>\n\n====Mesolithic period====\nThe earliest evidence of man's presence in these upper areas of Glamorgan was found in 1963 at Craig y Llyn.

Though no definite Mesolithic settlements have been located, the concentration of finds at the Craig y Llyn escarpment suggests the presence of a temporary campsite in the vicinity.<ref>{{Cite book |last= |first=|editor=Williams, Glanmor |title=Glamorgan County History, Volume II, Early Glamorgan: pre-history and early history |year=1984 |publisher=Glamorgan History Trust |location=Cardiff|page=57 |isbn=0-904730-04-2}}</ref>\n\n====Neolithic period====\nThe first structural relic of prehistoric man was excavated in 1973 at Cefn Glas near the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] of the Rhondda Fach river. The remains of a rectangular hut with traces of [[drystone wall]] foundations and [[posthole]]s was discovered; while [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon dating]] of charcoal found at the site dated the structure as late [[Neolithic]].<ref name=\"Davis7\"/>\n\n====Bronze Age====\n[[File:Llyn Fawr Reservoir.jpg|thumb|right|Llyn Fawr Reservoir in 2008]]\nAlthough little evidence of settlement has been found in the Rhondda for the Neolithic to [[Bronze Age]] periods, several [[cairn]]s and [[cist]]s have appeared throughout the length of both valleys. The best example of a round-cairn was found at Crug yr Afan, near the summit of Graig Fawr, west of [[Cwmparc]]. It consisted of an earthen mound with a surrounding ditch 28 metres in circumference and over 2 metres tall.<ref name=\"Davis11\">Davis (1989), p. 11.</ref> Although most cairns discovered in the area are round, a [[ring cairn]] or [[cairn circle]] exists on [[Gelli, Rhondda|Gelli]] Mountain.

The items did not originate from the Rhondda and are thought to have been left at the site as a [[votive]] offering. Of particular interest are fragments of an iron sword, the earliest iron object to be found in Wales, and the only C-type [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] sword recorded in Britain.<ref name=\"Davis9\">Davis (1989), p. 9.</ref>\n\n====Iron Age====\n[[File:Hen Drer Mynydd.jpg|thumb|left|The ruins of the Hen Dre'r Mynydd settlement at the head of the Rhondda]]\nWith the exception of the Neolithic settlement at Cefn Glas, there are three certain pre-medieval settlement sites in the valley \u2013 Maendy Camp, Hen Dre'r Gelli and Hen Dre'r Mynydd. The earliest of these is Maendy Camp, a [[hillfort]] whose remains lie between Ton Pentre and Cwmparc.<ref name=\"Davis14\">Davis (1989), p. 14.</ref> Although its defences would have been slight, the camp made good use of the natural slopes and rock outcrops to its north-east face. It consisted of two earthworks: an inner and outer enclosure. When the site was excavated in 1901, several archaeological finds led to the camp being misidentified as Bronze Age. These finds, mainly pottery and flint knives, were excavated from a burial cairn discovered within the outer enclosure, but the site has since been classified as from the [[Iron Age]].<ref name=\"Davis14\"/>\n\nThe settlement at Hen Dre'r Mynydd in Blaenrhondda was dated around the Roman period, when fragments of wheel-made [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]] pottery were discovered.

The historian Rice Merrick, in describing the upland area of the Vale of Glamorgan, stated that there \"was always great breeding of cattle, horses and sheep; but in elder time therein grew but small store of corn, for in most places there the ground was not thereunto apt.\" The English cartographer [[John Speed]] described the rearing of cattle as the \"best means unto wealth that the Shire doth afford.\"<ref>''Glamorgan County History, Volume IV, Early Modern Glamorgan from the Act of Union to the Industrial Revolution'', Glanmor Williams, pp. 2\u20133.

However, to be self-supporting, the farmers of the area grew crops such as oats, corn and barley in small quantities. Crops were grown in the lower part of the Rhondda on narrow meadows adjoining the riversides, though during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] scarce supplies forced the cultivation of the upland areas such as [[Wattstown|Carn-y-wiwer]] and Penrhys.<ref name=\"Lewis18-20\">Lewis (1959), pp. 18\u201320.</ref> Merrick would describe the diet of the upland inhabitants as consisting of \"bread made of wheat ... and ale and bear\" ''[sic]''<ref name=\"Davis29\"/> and over two hundred years later Benjamin Malkin showed how little the diet had changed when he wrote that the people still ate \"oatmeal bread, with a relish of miserable cheese; and the beer, where they have any, is worse than none.\"<ref>Benjamin Malkin (1807), ''The Scenery, Antiquities & Biography of South Wales'', Longman, Hurst, Rees and Orme.</ref>\n\nIn the first half of the 17th century, rising costs of consumable goods and successive bad harvests brought economic change in Glamorgan.<ref name=\"Davis29\"/> Those wealthy enough could seize opportunities created by the unsettled conditions and set about enlarging and enclosing farmlands.

This appears in the structures built in the Rhondda Valley.<ref name=\"Davis38\">Davis (1989), p. 38</ref> The fluctuating economy of the late [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] period resulted in farmers taking in more land, creating higher levels of surplus goods and so producing higher profits. These were reflected in new farmhouses built in the Rhondda and for the first time an emphasis on domestic comfort apparent in the design of dwellings.<ref name=\"Davis38\"/> Many new farm buildings were simple structures of two or three small rooms, but of a much sturdier,more permanent quality than the medieval platform houses. A popular style was the [[Dartmoor longhouse]], which combined the house and cowshed into one building. By 1840, the Rhondda had at least 160 farms,<ref name=\"Davis40\">Davis (1989), p. 40.</ref> but most were destroyed with the growth of the mining industry. Of the few survivors, those of note include Tynewydd ('New House') in [[Tynewydd]], a 17th-century house thought to have given its name to the neighbouring village of [[Tynewydd]] and of Tyntyle in Ystrad dated around 1600.\n\nThere were few industrial buildings before 1850; those of note include a 17th-century [[blast furnace]] at [[Pontygwaith, Rhondda|Pontygwaith]]<ref name=\"Davis34\">Davis (1989), p. 34.</ref> which gave the village its name. and a [[fulling|fulling mill]] established by Harri David in 1738, which in turn gave its name to [[Tonypandy]].<ref name=\"Davis35\">Davis (1989), p. 35.</ref> Corn mills existed sparsely throughout the valleys, as did early coal pits, two being recorded as opening in 1612 at Rhigos and Cwmparc, though they would have been open-cast, not deep mined.<ref name=\"Davis34\"/>\n\n==Industrial Rhondda 1850\u20131945==\n===Industrial growth (1850\u20131914)===\n{{further|List of collieries in the Rhondda Valleys|South Wales Coalfield}}\n[[File:Llwynyia 1910.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Llwynypia looking north towards Llwynypia Hospital, (c. 1912)]]\nThe [[South Wales coalfield]] is the largest continuous coalfield in Britain, extending some {{Convert|113|km|mi}} from [[Pontypool]] in the east to [[St Brides Bay]] in the West, covering almost {{convert|2600|km2|sqmi}}.<ref name=\"Davies153\">Davies (2008), p. 153.</ref> This took in most of Glamorgan and the entirety of the Rhondda within it. Although neighbouring areas such as [[Merthyr]] and [[Aberdare]] had already sunk coal mines, it was not until [[Walter Coffin]] initiated the [[Dinas Rhondda|Dinas]] Lower Colliery in 1812 that coal was exported from the Rhondda Valleys on any commercial scale.<ref name=\"Davies 746\"/> This was originally taken by [[packhorse]], before the extension of [[Richard Griffiths (industrialist)|Dr. Griffiths']] private tramline, to [[Pontypridd]] and then by the [[Glamorganshire Canal]] to the port at Cardiff. The lack of transportation links was one of the main problems that curtailed exploitation of the Rhondda Valley coalfields, along with the belief that they lay too deep for economic working.<ref name=\"John182\">John (1980), p. 182.</ref> It was therefore seen as an expensive risk. Exploration of the Rhondda was undertaken by the Bute Trustees, agents of the [[John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute|third Marquess of Bute]], who not only owned large tracts of valley farmland but also possessed a large financial interest in the [[Cardiff Docks]] which would export the coal.<ref name=\"John182\"/> The trustees sank the [[Bute Merthyr Colliery]] in October 1851, at the top of the Rhondda Fawr in what would become [[Treherbert]]. The Bute Merthyr began producing coal in 1855, as the first working steam-coal colliery in the Rhondda.<ref name=\"Davies 746\"/>\n\nAlong with the sinking of the first colliery at the head of the Rhondda, a second issue, transportation, was tackled with the extension of the [[Taff Vale Railway]] (TVR); royal assent was given in 1836.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.trackbed.com/companies/t/tvr/dsmbarrie/tvr_dsmbarrie.htm |title=The Taff Vale Railway |author=Barrie, D.S.M. |work= |publisher=trackbed.com |accessdate=12 September 2010}}</ref> The original line was laid from Cardiff to [[Abercynon]], and by 1841 a branch was opened to link Cardiff with Dinas via Pontypridd. This allowed easier transportation for Walter Coffin's Dinas mine, an unsurprising addition, as Coffin was a director of the TVR. In 1849 the TVR extended into the Rhondda Fach and by 1856 the railway had reached the furthest areas of the Fach and Fawr valleys at Maerdy and Treherbert. For the first time, the Rhondda Valley was linked by a major transportation route to the rest of Wales<ref name=\"John182\" /> and exploitation of its coalfields could begin.\n\nThe TVR line dominated coal transportation through the Rhondda's industrial history. Its monopoly was a bone of contention: the absence of rivals precluded colliery owners from negotiating lower haulage rates.<ref name=\"John454\">John (1980), p. 454.</ref> Attempts were made to break the monopoly included the opening of the [[Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway]] between 1885 and 1895,<ref name=awdry>Awdry (1990), p. 1.</ref> which linked Blaenrhondda at the head of the Rhondda Fawr to the [[Prince of Wales Dock, Swansea|Prince of Wales Dock]]. To achieve this the Rhondda Tunnel<ref name=\"John455\">John (1980), p. 455.</ref> was dug through Mynydd Blaengwynfy to [[Blaengwynfi]] \u2013 at the time the longest railway tunnel in Wales.\n\nInitially the shallower pits at Aberdare proved a bigger attraction to prospective mine owners, but once Aberdare became fully worked by the 1860s, the Rhondda saw rapid growth. During the 1860s and the 1870s, 20 Rhondda Valley collieries opened, with the leading owner in the Rhondda Fach being [[David Davis, Maesyffynnon (coal owner)|David Davis]] of Aberdare, and [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies]] in the Rhondda Fawr.<ref name=\"John182\"/> In 1865 the coal output from the Rhondda Valley was roughly one-quarter of that of Aberdare; ten years later the Rhondda was producing over two million tons more than the Aberdare valleys. These figures would later be dwarfed by massive excavation rates in the last quarter of the 19th century and up to the First World War. In 1913, Rhondda Valley output was 9.6 million tons.<ref name=\"John183\">John (1980), p. 183</ref>\n\nBy 1893 there were more than 75 collieries in the Rhondda Valleys. Initially most were owned by a small group of individuals,<ref name=\"John192\">John (1980), p. 192</ref> but the trend changed towards the start of the 20th century, as companies began buying up existing collieries. The widespread adoption of [[limited liability]] status began a trend towards concentration of ownership,<ref name=\"John193\">John (1980), p. 193.</ref> reducing some of the economic risks involved in coalmining: unstable coal prices, inflated acquisitions, geological difficulties, and large-scale accidents.<ref name=\"John192-3\">John (1980), pp. 192\u2013193.</ref> The emerging companies were formed by the individuals and families who sank the original collieries, but by the start of the 20th century they were no more than principal shareholders.

In 1841 the parish of [[Ystradyfodwg]], which would later constitute most of the Rhondda Borough, recorded a population of less than a thousand.<ref name=\"Davies 746\"/> With the discovery of massive deposits of high quality, accessible coal in the mid-19th century, the valleys experienced a large influx of financial immigrants. The first came to the lower Rhondda villages of Dinas, Eirw and Cymmer. Special sinkers came from [[Llansamlet]], while the first miners were from [[Penderyn, Rhondda Cynon Taf|Penderyn]], [[Cwmgwrach]] and neighbouring areas of [[Llantrisant]] and [[Llanharan]].<ref name=\"Hopkins112\">Hopkins (1975), p. 112.</ref> The 1851 Census lists apprenticed paupers from [[Temple Cloud]] in Somerset, some of the earliest English immigrants.<ref name=\"Hopkins112\"/> From a mere 951 in 1851, the population of Ystradyfodwg parish grew to 16,914 in 1871. By 1901 the Rhondda Urban District had a population of 113,735.<ref>Williams (1996), p. 15.</ref> As more and more coal mines were sunk the population grew to fill the jobs needed to extract the coal. In the 1860s and 1870s the majority came from neighbouring Welsh counties, but with the improving rail transportation and cheaper transport, immigrants came from further afield. The 1890s recorded workers from the South West, places such as Gloucester and Devon, and by the 1900s people came from North Wales, the lead-mining area of [[Anglesey]] and the depressed [[slate]]-quarrying villages of [[Bethesda, Gwynedd|Bethesda]], [[Ffestiniog]] and [[Dinorwig]].<ref name=\"Hopkins113\">Hopkins (1975), p. 113</ref> Although there are records of Scottish workers, mainly centred on Archibald Hood's Llwynypia mines, there were only small numbers of Irish, less than 1,000 by 1911.<ref name=\"Hopkins114\">Hopkins (1975), p. 114.</ref> This absence is often blamed on the forcible ejection of the Irish who lived in Treherbert during three days of rioting in 1857.<ref name=\"Hopkins206\">Hopkins (1975), p. 206</ref> The population of the valleys peaked in 1924 at over 167,900 inhabitants.<ref name=\"Davies 746\"/>\n\nThe mass immigration in the period was almost entirely from other parts of Wales and from England.<ref>1911 Census, of those who answered: Welsh 90.28%, English 8.23%, Irish and Scottish 0.92%, rest of world 0.58%.</ref> A notable exception was a group of Italian immigrants, originally from northern Italy round the town of [[Bardi, Emilia-Romagna|Bardi]]. In the late 19th century, they were forced out of London by over-saturation of the market, and instead set up a network of caf\u00e9s, [[ice cream parlor|ice cream parlours]] and [[Fish and chips|fish & chip shops]] throughout South Wales. These became iconic landmarks in the villages they served and they and subsequent generations became [[Welsh Italians]]. Peculiar to the Rhondda was that shops run by Italian immigrants were known as bracchis, believed to have been named after Angelo Bracchi, who opened the first caf\u00e9 there in the early 1890s.<ref name=\"Davies408\">Davies (2008), p. 408</ref> In the early 21st century several of the Rhondda's original bracchis were still open for business.\n\n===Decline of coal and economic emigration (1914\u20131944)===\n{{see also|Great Depression in the United Kingdom}}\n[[File:Miners' Statue, Rhondda.jpg|thumb|right|Commemorative statue to the \"Mining Communities of Rhondda\" [[Robert Thomas (sculptor)|Robert Thomas]] (1926-1999)]]\nAt the start of the [[First World War]], the economic prospects in South Wales were good. Although production fell after the 1913 high, demand was still strong enough to push the coalfields to their limit.<ref name=\"John519\">John (1980), p. 519</ref> In February 1917 coal mining came under government control and demand increased as the war intensified, ensuring a market for sufficient supplies.<ref name=\"John519\"/> After the war the picture began to change. Initially the British coal industry was buoyed by a series of fortuitous economic events, such as the American coal miners' strike, and by 1924 unemployment for miners was below the national average. But the belief that the mining industry would experience a permanent demand for coal was shattered by the [[Depression (economic)|Depression]], when the Rhondda experienced a massive increase in unemployment.<ref name=\"Davies748\">Davies (2008), p. 748.</ref> The situation worsened in 1926, when in response to coalowners reducing pay and lengthening working hours of miners,<ref name=\"Morgan100\">Morgan (1988), p. 100.</ref> the [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] called a [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|general strike]] in defence of the miners [[Lockout (industry)|locked out]] following [[A.

The miners disagreed and stayed on strike for a further seven months until they were starved into surrender. The Rhondda saw many schemes set up by miners to aid their plight, such as [[soup kitchen]]s and [[f\u00eate]]s and \"joy\" days to support them,<ref>Wales in the Twentieth Century World: Family on the Dole 1919\u20131939; Mid Glamorgan County Council Education Department (1994) pp. 3\u20134.</ref> while in Maerdy the local miners set up a rationing system.<ref name=\"Morgan101\"/> By the time the miners returned to work, there was little desire for further action, which saw a decline in the popularity of 'The Fed'<ref name=\"Morgan101\"/> and greater emphasis on solving problems by political and parliamentary means.<ref name=\"Morgan102\">Morgan (1988), p. 102</ref>\n\nWith the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]], employment in the Rhondda Valleys continued to fall.

Between 1924 and 1939, 50,000 people left the Rhondda. During this time life was difficult for communities built solely around a singular industry, especially as most families were on a single wage.\n\nThe start of the [[Second World War]] saw a turnaround in the employment figures, and by 1944 unemployment figures in the Rhondda ranged from 1 per cent in Treorchy to 3.7 per cent at Tonypandy.<ref name=\"John563\">John (1980), p. 563.</ref>\n\n===Mining disasters===\n[[File:Lewis Merthyr Colliery.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The Lewis Merthyr Colliery, now part of the Rhondda Heritage Park]]\nThe possibility of serious injury or death was an everyday risk for the mine workers of the Rhondda Valley. The most notorious form of [[Mining accident|colliery disaster]] was the [[gas explosion]],<ref name=\"Davies160\">Davies (2008), p. 160.</ref> caused by a buildup either of [[methane]] gas or [[coal dust]]. As mines became deeper and ventilation harder to control, the risk increased. The worst single incident in the Rhondda was the 1867 Ferndale disaster, when an explosion took 178 lives. However, the major disasters accounted for only about a fifth of the overall fatalities.<ref name=\"Davies161\">Davies (2008), p. 161.</ref> The list below shows mining accidents involving the loss of five or more lives in a single incident.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Mining disasters in the Rhondda Valley 1850\u20131965\n!

There was a sense of salvation when the government announced the [[National Coal Board|nationalisation of the British coal mines]] in 1947, but subsequent decades saw continual output reductions. From 15,000 miners in 1947, Rhondda had just a single pit within the valleys producing coal in 1984, located at Maerdy.<ref name=\"Davies748\"/> The decline in coal mining after World War II was a countrywide issue, but South Wales and Rhondda were more gravely affected than other areas. Oil had superseded coal as the fuel of choice in many industries and there was political pressure behind the oil supply.<ref name=\"John590\">John (1980), p. 590.</ref> From the few industries still reliant on coal, the demand was for high quality, especially [[Coke (fuel)|coking coal]] for the steel industry. By then, 50 per cent of Glamorgan coal was supplied to [[Steel mill|steelworks]],<ref name=\"John595\">John (1980), p. 595.</ref> with the second biggest market being domestic heating: the \"smokeless\" fuel of the Rhondda became once again fashionable after publication of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]].<ref name=\"John596\">John (1980), p. 596.</ref> These two markets controlled the fate of the mines in the Rhondda, and as demand fell from both, the effect was further contraction. In addition, exports to other areas of Europe such as France, Italy and the [[Low Countries]] experienced sharp decline: from 33 per cent of output around the start of the 20th century to some 5 per cent by 1980.<ref name=\"John596\"/>\n\nOther major factors in the decline of coal related to massive under-investment in the Rhondda mines over the previous decades. Most mines in the valleys had been sunk between the 1850s and 1880s, so that they were far smaller than most modern mines.<ref name=\"John588\">John (1980), p. 588.</ref> The Rhondda mines were comparatively antiquated in their methods of ventilation, coal-preparation and power supply.<ref name=\"John588\"/> In 1945 the British coal industry was cutting 72 per cent of its output mechanically, whereas in South Wales the figure was just 22 per cent.<ref name=\"John588\"/> The only way to ensure financial survival of the mines in the valleys was massive investment by the NCB, but its \"Plan for Coal\" paper drawn up in 1950 was overly optimistic about future demand,<ref name=\"John589\">John (1980), p. 589.</ref> which was drastically reduced after an industrial recession in 1956 and with increased availability of oil.<ref name=\"John590\">John (1980), p. 590.</ref>\n\nBritish and Welsh employment bodies funded and subsidised external businesses to locate replacement ventures in the valleys. The first attempt to bring in business unconnected to coal began in the 1920s, when David Jones, Town Clerk of the Rhondda Urban Council, gained government support for so doing.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/south-wales-news/rhondda/2007/03/29/a-look-back-to-the-glory-days-91466-18829209/ |title=A Look back to the glory days |author= |date=29 March 2007 |work=Rhondda Leader |publisher=Wales Online |accessdate=5 October 2008}}</ref> Arrivals included Alfred Polikoff's clothing factory,<ref name=\"John572\">John (1980), p. 572.</ref> Messrs Jacob Beatus manufacturing cardboard boxes, and [[EMI|Electrical and Musical Industries Ltd]].<ref name=\"John572\"/> After the Second World War, 23 firms were set up in the Rhondda Valleys, 18 of them sponsored by the [[Board of Trade]].

He is thought to have lived around AD 600. Although the parish bears his name, there are now no religious monuments or places of worship named after him within the Rhondda boundaries,<ref name=\"Davis31\">Davis (1989), p. 31</ref> although two churches outside the area are named after him: Y Tre Sant in [[Llantrisant]] and Saint Tyfodwg\u2019s in [[Ogmore Vale]].\n\nThe earliest known religious monument is the Catholic [[Penrhys#Ffynnon Fair|holy well]] in Penrhys first mentioned in the 15th century, though it may have been a place of pagan worship before.<ref name=\"Davis27\">Davis (1989), p. 27</ref> This pilgrimage site was identified as a manor belonging to the [[Cistercians|Cistercian Abbey]] of [[Llantarnam Abbey|Llantarnam]]<ref name=\"Davis27\"/> and was seen as one of the most important religious sites in Wales, due to its [[Shrines to the Virgin Mary|Marian shrine]].<ref name=\"Davis27\"/> This holy site was the main reason people would pass through the commote; it was even thought to be the main reason why the first bridges were built over the River Rhondda.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tobin |first= Patrick |author2=J.

In 1738 the Reverend Henry Davies formed the Independent Cause in Cymmer and five years later a Ty Cwrdd or meeting house was opened there.<ref name=\"Davis31\"/> Although attracting families from as far away as Merthyr and the parish of [[Eglwysilan]], there were no other Nonconformist Causes until David Williams began preaching in the Rhondda in 1784. In 1785 six people were baptised in the river near Melin-yr-Om and in 1786 Ynysfach was opened in Ystrad as \"a new house for religious services\".<ref name=\"Davis32\">Davis (1989), p. 32.</ref> This was the first [[Baptist]] [[chapel]] in the Rhondda and later became known as [[Nebo, Ystrad Rhondda]].<ref name=\"pillars nebo\">{{Cite web |title=Pillars of Faith |url=http://www.pillars-of-faith.com/chapels2.php?RecNo=59 |accessdate=21 January 2014}}</ref> Cymmer and Ynysfach chapel would be the forerunners in a new religious movement in the valley for the next 150 years. In the early 19th century there were only three places of worship in the Rhondda; the parish church (now dedicated to St John the Baptist) and the Cymmer and Ynysfach chapels. This changed rapidly after 1855 as coal mining brought an influx of population, and by 1905 there were 151 chapels in the valley.<ref name=\"Morgan252\">Morgan (1988), p. 252.</ref>\n\nChapel life was central to valley life throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but as with many communities throughout Britain, the post-war periods saw a decline in regular membership. To an extent the number of places of worship declined with the population, but this was exacerbated in the Rhondda by a swift decline in the number of Welsh speakers. Welsh-language chapels in particular saw a sharp drop in membership from the 1950s, and many closed in the next half-century. By 1990 the Rhondda had less than 50 places of worship and many premises had been demolished.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.therhondda.co.uk/general/churches.html |title=Rhondda Places of Worship |work=LSJ Services [Wales] Ltd |publisher=TheRhondda.co.uk |accessdate=19 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930231847/http://www.therhondda.co.uk/general/churches.html |archive-date=2011-09-30 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Political activism==\n[[File:AJ Cook banner.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Lodge banner depicting Unionist [[A.

In the 1870s the [[Amalgamated Association of Miners]] won support, but was destroyed by employer hostility. The Cambrian Miners' Association was more successful and the creation of the [[South Wales Miners' Federation]] after the [[Welsh coal strike of 1898|1898 coal strike]] gave South Wales miners a reputation for [[Militant (word)|militancy]], in which the Rhondda Valley played its part.<ref name=\"Lewis172-173\">Lewis (1959), pp. 172\u2013173.</ref>\n\nAs part of the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885|Redistribution Act]] of 1885 the Rhondda was granted its first seat in Parliament, which was won by a moderate trade union leader, [[William Abraham (Welsh politician)|William Abraham]], who was notably the only working-class member elected in Wales.<ref name=\"Davies650\">Davies (2008), p. 650.</ref> [[Socialism]] and [[syndicalism]] grew in the 20th century and industrial struggle reached a crescendo in the 1910\u20131911 [[Tonypandy Riots]].<ref name=\"Morgan62\">Morgan (1988), p. 62</ref> A year later Tonypandy saw the publication of [[Noah Ablett]]'s pamphlet \"[[The Miners' Next Step]]\". Tonypandy was at the centre of further public disorder, when on 11 June 1936 at Dewinton Field, a crowd gathered to confront an open-air address by [[Tommy Moran]], propaganda officer of the [[British Union of Fascists]].

In the 1920s and 1930s the Rhondda and the surrounding valleys provided the principal support of some of the largest [[hunger marches]], while in 1936 more Rhondda Federation members were serving in Spain as part of the [[International Brigades]] than the total number of volunteers from all the English coalfields.<ref name=\"Morgan102\">Morgan (1988), p. 102</ref>\n\nIn 1979, Rhondda councillor [[Annie Powell]] became Wales' only communist mayor.<ref>\"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE1DC1439F93AA1575BC0A960948260 Annie Powell (obituary)]\", ''[[New York Times]]'', 29 August 1986</ref>\n\n==Culture and recreation==\n===Role of women===\nWith an economy largely dependent on a single industry, there was a scarcity of jobs for women in Rhondda's coalmining heyday. The [[Encyclopaedia of Wales]] notes that the image of the [[Welsh Mam]], a wife and mother constantly at home and exalted as the queen of the household, was essentially a Rhondda creation.<ref name=\"Davies 746\">Davies (2008), p. 746.</ref> However the Rhondda did produce the [[suffragette]] and social reformer [[Elizabeth Andrews]],<ref name=\"Davies 746\"/> one of only nine women among a list of a hundred great Welsh heroes chosen by ballot in 2004.<ref>[http://www.100welshheroes.com/en/top100 100 Welsh Heroes] Ranked at number 100.</ref>\n\n===Sport===\nSocial amenities were rudimentary even before the Rhondda Urban District Council was formed in 1897. Due to the geographic layout of the valleys, land was a scarce resource, and so leisure pursuits that took up little space, time and money were sought. This resulted in activities such as [[greyhound]] racing, cockfighting, open-air handball (often attached to a [[public house]]), boxing, foot racing and rugby union.<ref name=\"Smith103\">Smith (1980), p. 103.</ref>\n[[File:Dai Tarw Jones.jpg|thumb|125px|right|Dai 'Tarw' Jones]]\n\n====Rugby union====\nDuring the mid-19th century the influx of immigrants from older mining towns such as Aberdare and Merthyr brought the game of [[rugby union|rugby]] with them. At Treherbert it took a five-month [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]] in 1875 to see the game establish itself at the various collieries where the Amalgamated Association of Miners held their meetings.<ref name=\"Smith102\">Smith (1980), p. 102</ref> In 1877 [[Penygraig RFC|Penygraig Rugby Football Club]] was formed, followed by [[Treherbert RFC|Treherbert]] in 1879, [[Ferndale RFC|Ferndale]] in 1882, [[Treorchy RFC|Treorchy]] in 1886 and [[Tylorstown RFC|Tylorstown]] in 1903.

The valley clubs had no clubhouses, with most teams meeting and changing in the closest local public house.<ref name=\"Morgan393\">Morgan (1988), p. 393.</ref> Many clubs built around colliery and pub teams appeared and disbanded, but many others survive to this day.\n\n====Football====\nDue to the dominance of rugby union, there have been few [[Association football|football]] teams of note in the history of the Rhondda Valleys. Several teams were formed around the end of the 19th century, but most folded in the Depression, including Cwmparc F.C. in 1926<ref name=\"Morgan396\">Morgan (1988), p. 396.</ref> and [[Mid Rhondda F.C.|Mid-Rhondda]] in 1928.<ref name=\"Morgan396\"/> The area's most successful club is [[Ton Pentre F.C.]]\n\n===Music===\nThe [[temperance movement]], absorbed into the moralistic system of the Nonconformist chapels, caused a shift in social attitudes in the mid to late-19th and early 20th century Rhondda. Alcohol was looked down on and so were the increasingly violent sports such as rugby,<ref name=\"Smith120\">Smith (1980), p. 120</ref> so that many young men sought more acceptable pastimes. Voice choirs were a natural progression from chapel society and brass bands eventually gained acceptance by the movement.\n\n====Male voice choirs====\nThe male-voice choirs of Welsh industrial communities are believed to have derived from [[glee clubs]]. The Rhondda produced several choirs of note, including the Rhondda Glee Society, which represented Wales at the World Fair [[eisteddfod]].<ref name=\"Morgan374\">Morgan (1988), p. 374.</ref> The rival [[Treorchy Male Choir|Treorchy Male Voice Choir]] also enjoyed success at eisteddfodau, and in 1895, the original choir sang before Queen Victoria.<ref name=\"Morgan374\"/> Many choirs still exist, including the Cambrian Male voice choir in Tonypandy and the Cor Meibion Morlais in Ferndale.\n\n====Brass bands====\nThe mid-19th century [[brass band]]s had a poor relationship with the Nonconformist chapels, mainly due to the heavy social drinking that came hand in hand with being a member.<ref name=\"Davies80\">Davies (2008), p. 80</ref> This changed towards the end of the 19th century, when on becoming more respectable, many bands had actually joined the temperance movement. Two Rhondda brass bands which both started as temperance bands are the [[Cory Band]] from [[Ton Pentre]], who started life as ''Ton Temperance'' in 1884;<ref>[http://www.rhondda-cynon-taff.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/hcst/content.hcst?lang=en&textonly=on&dDocName=021583 Blue Plaque Scheme Announced]{{dead link |date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} Rhondda Cynon Taf Council website.</ref> and the Parc and Dare Band, formerly the ''Cwmparc Drum and Fife Temperance Band''.<ref> {{Cite web |url=http://www.brassbands.co.uk/history.htm |title=A History of the Parc and Dare Band |publisher=brassbands.co.uk |first=Lawrence |last=Harries |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref> The oldest in Rhondda is the Lewis-Merthyr Band, formerly Cymmer Colliery Band, founded as the Cymmer Military Band in or before 1855.<ref>[http://www.lewismerthyrband.com/about.htm{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} Lewis-Merthyr Band website.</ref>\n\nAs the temperance movement faded, the bands found new benefactors in the colliery owners and many took on the names of specific collieries. A memorable image of the connection between the collieries and brass bands came in 1985, when the Maerdy miners were filmed returning to work after the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|miners' strike]], marching behind the village band.<ref name=\"Davies80\"/>\n\n====Songs====\n[[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], [[David Alexander (singer)|David Alexander]] and [[Paul Child (singer)|Paul Child]] have been among those who sang songs about the Rhondda.\n\n===Culture and nationality===\n====Language====\nFor most of its history, the Rhondda valleys were an exclusively Welsh-speaking area. Only in the early 20th century did English began to supplant Welsh as the first language of social intercourse.<ref name=\"Hopkins179\">Hopkins (1975), p. 179.</ref> In 1803, English historian [[Benjamin Heath Malkin]] mentioned that while travelling through Ystradyfodwg he had met only one person with whom he could talk, and then with the help of an interpreter.<ref name=\"Hopkins179\"/> This experience was repeated by [[John George Wood]], who on a visit complained of the awkwardness of understanding the particular dialects and idioms used by the native speakers, which were difficult for other Welsh speakers to understand.<ref name=\"Hopkins180\">Hopkins (1975), p. 180.</ref> This dialect was once called \"tafodiaith gw\u0177r y Gloran\" (the dialect of Gloran men).\n\nAs industrialisation began, there was still little shift in the use of Welsh. Initial immigrants were Welsh: it was not until the 1900s that English workers began settling in any great numbers, and in any case it was not these new workers who changed the language. The erosion of Welsh had begun in the 1860s in the school classrooms. The educational philosophy accepted by schoolmasters and governmental administrators was that English was the language of scholars and Welsh a barrier to moral and commercial prosperity.<ref name=\"Hopkins212\">Hopkins (1975), p. 212.</ref> In 1901, 35.4 per cent of Rhondda workers spoke only English, but by 1911 this had risen to 43.1 per cent, while Welsh-speaking monoglots had fallen from 11.4 to 4.4 per cent in the same period.<ref name=\"Hopkins209\">Hopkins (1975), p. 209.</ref>\n\nThorough anglicization of the Rhondda Valleys took place between 1900 to 1950. Improved transport and communications facilitated the spread of cultural influences, along with dealings with outside companies with no understanding of Welsh, trade union meetings being held in English, and the coming of radio, cinema and then television and cheap English newspapers and [[paperback]] books. All these were factors in the absorption of the English language.<ref name=\"Hopkins213\">Hopkins (1975), p. 213.</ref>\n\n====Cadwgan Circle====\nThough the population of the Rhondda was embracing English as its first language, a literary and intellectual movement formed in the Rhondda in the 1940s that would produce an influential group of [[Welsh language]] writers. The group formed during the Second World War by Egyptologist [[J. Gwyn Griffiths]] and his German wife [[K\u00e4the Bosse-Griffiths]] was known as the Cadwgan Circle ('''{{ill|Cylch Cadwgan|cy}}''') and met at the Griffiths' house in [[Pentre]]. Welsh writers who made up the movement included [[Pennar Davies]], [[Rhydwen Williams]], [[James Kitchener Davies]] and [[Gareth Alban Davies]].\n\n[[File:Gorsedd Stones, Treorchy.JPG|right|thumb|Treorchy Gorsedd Stones]]\n====National Eisteddfod====\nThe Rhondda has hosted the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales|National Eisteddfod]] on only one occasion, in [[1928 in Wales|1928]] at [[Treorchy]]. The [[Gorsedd stones]] that were placed to mark the event still stand on the Maindy hillside overlooking Treorchy and Cwmparc. In 1947 Treorchy held the [[Eisteddfod#Urdd Eisteddfod|Urdd National Eisteddfod]] for children and young adults.<ref name=\"Hopkins19\">Hopkins (1975), p. 19.</ref>\n\n====Communal activity====\nRhondda had a strong tradition of communal activity, exemplified by [[Working men's club|workmen's halls]], [[miners' institute]]s and trade unions.<ref name=\"Davies747\">Davies (2008), p. 747.</ref> Miners began to contribute to the building and running of institutes - such as the [[Parc and Dare Hall]] in Treorchy \u2013 from the 1890s onwards, and were centres of entertainment and self-improvement, with billiards halls, libraries and reading rooms.<ref name=\"Davies558\">Davies (2008), p. 558.</ref>\n\n===Media===\nIn 1884 the Rhondda Valley had a local [[newspaper]], the ''Rhondda Chronicle'',<ref>[http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/insrv/libraries/scolar/special/hums/welsh.html Welsh Newspapers] Cardiff University information services</ref> which became the ''Rhondda Gazette and General Advertiser of the Rhondda Fach and Ogmore Valleys'' in 1891. In 1899, the Rhondda Valley was served by the ''Pontypridd and Rhondda Weekly Post'' while the ''Rhondda Post'' was also in circulation in 1898.\n\nThe ''[[Rhondda Leader]]'', one of the more familiar local papers, appeared in 1899<ref> {{Cite web |url=http://www.britishpapers.co.uk/wales/rhondda-leader |title=Rhondda Leader |author= |work= |publisher=British Newspapers Online |accessdate=12 September 2010}}</ref> and nine years later became the ''Rhondda Leader, Maesteg, Garw and Ogmore Telegraph''. The ''Porth Gazette'' was published from 1900 to 1944,<ref>[http://www.therhondda.co.uk/facts/newspapers.html Newspapers and Publications] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516203539/http://www.therhondda.co.uk/facts/newspapers.html |date=2008-05-16}} TheRhondda.co.uk.</ref> and during that period there was a newspaper called the ''Rhondda Socialist''. The ''Rhondda Gazette'' was in circulation from 1913 to 1919, while the ''Rhondda Clarion'' was available in the late 1930s.\n\nThe ''Porth Gazette and Rhondda Leader'' was published from 1944 to 1967. Also published in Pontypridd during that period was the ''Rhondda Fach Leader and Gazette''. In more recent years the ''Rhondda Leader'' and ''Pontypridd & Llantrisant Observer'' combined, before the ''Rhondda Leader'' became separate once more.<ref name=\"Rhondda Leader\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/south-wales-news/rhondda/2008/09/04/paper-talk-91466-21656933/ |title=Paper talk |publisher=Rhondda Leader |author= Dave Edwards |date=4 September 2008 |accessdate=25 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1952 the BBC transmitter at [[Wenvoe transmitting station|Wenvoe]] began broadcasting, allowing the Rhondda to receive television pictures for the first time.<ref>May, (2003), p. 50.</ref> This was followed in January 1958 by commercial television from [[Television Wales and the West]] (TWW), giving Rhondda viewers a choice of two channels.<ref>May, (2003), p. 54.</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Cwmparc, zigzag on the A4061 - geograph.org.uk - 444747.jpg|thumb|The A4061 Bwlch-y-Clawdd road was built in 1928.

The original road layout followed the valleys, with few links between them. In the 1920s, a major unemployment relief programme for out-of-work miners was created to build mountain roads connecting them. These had a lasting effect and transformed the valleys from being dead-end communities.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1928/may/22/glamorgan-inter-valley-road |title=Glamorgan Inter-Valley Road |work=Hansard |date=22 May 1928 |accessdate=5 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/19th-november-1929/46/a-swansea-appeal-disallowed |title=Expediting Traffic in Wales |work=Commercial Motor |date=19 November 1929 |accessdate=5 August 2015}}</ref> In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, new road projects such as the [[Rhondda by-pass]] were created out of former railway lines.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/6974274.stm |title=Morgan opens \u00a398m Rhondda by-pass |work=BBC News |date=3 September 2007 |accessdate=25 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nTwo main roads service the area. The [[A4058]] runs through the Rhondda Fawr and the [[A4233]] services the Rhondda Fach. The A4058 starts at [[Pontypridd]] runs through Porth before ending at Treorchy, where it joins the [[A4061]] to Hirwaun. The A4233 begins outside Rhondda at [[Tonyrefail]], heading north through Porth and through the Rhondda Fach to Maerdy, where the road links up with the [[A4059]] at Aberdare. Two other A roads service the area; the [[A4119]] is a relief road known as the Tonypandy Bypass; the other is the [[A4061]], which links Treorchy to the [[Ogmore Vale]] before reaching Bridgend.\n\nThere is a single rail link to the Rhondda, the [[Rhondda Line]], based around the old [[Taff Vale Railway]], which serviced both the Rhondda Fach and Rhondda Fawr. The Rhondda Line runs through the Rhondda Fawr, linking Rhondda to [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff Central]]. The railway stations that once populated the Rhondda Fach were all closed under the [[Beeching Axe]]. The railway line serves ten Rhondda stations with the villages not directly linked connected through bus services.\n\n[[British Rail]] reopened some of the closed stations such as [[Ystrad Rhondda railway station]] in 1986.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Hutton, John |title=The Taff Vale Railway, vol. 2 |publisher=Silver Link |year=2006 |ISBN=978-1-85794-250-7}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\nDue to the scarcity of inhabitants in the Rhondda prior to industrialisation, there are few residents of note before the valleys became a coalmining area. The earliest individuals to come to the fore were linked with the coal industry and the people; physical men who found a way out of the Rhondda through sport; and charismatic orators who led the miners through unions or political and religious leaders who tended to the deeply religious chapel going public.\n\n===Sport===\n[[File:Jimmy Wilde.jpg|thumb|Boxer, Jimmy Wilde]]\nThe two main sports with which the Rhondda appeared to produce quality participants were rugby union and [[boxing]]. One of the first true rugby stars to come from the Rhondda was [[Willie Llewellyn]], who not only gained 20 caps for [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] scoring 48 points but was also the first Rhondda-born member of the [[British and Irish Lions|British Lions]]. Such was Llewellyn's fame that during the [[Tonypandy Riots]], his pharmacy was left unscathed by the crowds due to his past sporting duties. Many players came through the Rhondda to gain international duty, and after the split between amateur rugby union and the professional [[rugby league|Northern League]], many were also tempted to the North of England to earn a wage for their abilities. Amongst the new league players was [[Jack Rhapps]], Aberaman-born, but living in the Rhondda when he went north, to become the world's first dual-code international rugby player.\n\nThe most famous rugby player from the Rhondda in the latter half of the 20th century is [[Cliff Morgan]]. Morgan was born in [[Trebanog]] and gained 29 caps for Wales, four for the British Lions and was one of the inaugural inductees of the [[International Rugby Hall of Fame]]. Another notable player is [[Billy Cleaver]] from [[Treorchy]], a member of the [[1950 Five Nations Championship|1950 Grand Slam]] winning team. [[Maurice Richards]], born in Tynntyla Road, Ystrad Rhondda, was a Welsh international and British Lion of note, still known today for his scoring achievements playing in this code. \n\nDuring the 20th century the Rhondda supplied a steady stream of championship boxers. [[Percy Jones (boxer)|Percy Jones]] was not only the first World Champion from the Rhondda, but the first Welshman to hold a World Title when he won the Flyweight belt in 1914. After Jones came the Rhondda's most notable boxer, [[Jimmy Wilde]], also known as the \"Mighty Atom\", who took the [[International Boxing Union (1913\u20131946)|IBU]] world flyweight title in 1916. British Champions from the valleys include [[Tommy Farr]], who held the British and Empire heavyweight belt, and [[Llew Edwards]], who took the British featherweight and Australian lightweight titles.\n\nAlthough [[association football]] was not so popular as rugby in the Rhondda in the early 20th century, after the 1920s several notable players emerged from the area. Two of the most important came from the village of [[Ton Pentre]]; [[Jimmy Murphy (footballer)|Jimmy Murphy]] was capped 15 times for Wales, and in 1958 managed both the Welsh national team and [[Manchester United]]. [[Roy Paul]], also from Ton Pentre, led Manchester City to two successive [[FA Cup]] finals in 1955 and 1956 and gained 33 Welsh caps. [[Alan Curtis (footballer)|Alan Curtis]], who was best known for representing [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], came from the neighbouring village of [[Pentre]], and in an 11-year international career won 35 caps for Wales, scoring six goals.\n\nThe Rhondda Valleys have produced two world-class darts players. In 1975 [[Alan Evans (darts player)|Alan Evans]] from Ferndale won the [[Winmau World Masters]], a feat repeated in 1994 by [[Richie Burnett]] from Cwmparc. Burnett surpassed Evans when he also became [[BDO World Darts Championship|BDO World Darts Champion]], winning the tournament in [[1995 BDO World Darts Championship|1995]].\n\n===Politics===\n[[File:Leanne Wood Senedd.jpg|thumb|Leanne Wood, from [[Penygraig]]]]\n[[D. A. Thomas]], active in the area as an industrialist and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician, received the titles of ''Baron Rhondda'' in 1916 and ''[[Viscount Rhondda]]'' in 1918. Despite not being born in the Rhondda, the two most notable political figures to emerge from the area are [[William Abraham (Welsh politician)|William Abraham]], known as Mabon, and [[George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy|George Thomas, Viscount Tonypandy]]. Abraham, best known as a trade unionist, was the first Member of Parliament of the Rhondda and the leader of the South Wales Miners' Federation. A strong negotiator in the early years of valley unionism, he lost ground as a moderate to more radical leaders in his later years. Thomas was born in Port Talbot, but raised in Trealaw near Tonypandy. He was a Member of Parliament for Cardiff for 38 years and Speaker of the House of Commons (1976\u20131983). On his retirement from politics, he received the title of ''Viscount Tonypandy''.\n\n[[Leanne Wood]], the former leader of [[Plaid Cymru]] was born in the Rhondda.\n\n===Film and television===\nThe best-known actors born in the Rhondda have been Sir [[Stanley Baker]] and the brothers [[Donald Houston|Donald]] and [[Glyn Houston]]. Baker was born in Ferndale and starred in films such as ''[[The Cruel Sea (1953 film)|The Cruel Sea]]'' (1953) and ''[[Richard III (1955 film)|Richard III]]'' (1955), though it was as actor/producer of the 1964 film [[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]] that his legacy endures.<ref>Davies (2008) p. 47.</ref> The Houston brothers were born in Tonypandy, with Donald gaining the greater success as a film actor, with memorable roles in ''[[The Blue Lagoon (1949 film)|The Blue Lagoon]]'' (1949) and Ealing's ''[[Dance Hall (1950 film)|Dance Hall]]'' (1950).<ref name=\"Davies378\">Davies (2008) p. 378.</ref> Glyn Houston acted primarily in British B-Movies and was better known as a television actor.<ref name=\"Davies378\"/>\n\n===Literature===\nOf the Cadwgan Circle, the most notable is [[Rhydwen Williams]], winner of the Eisteddfod Crown on two occasions, who used the landscape of the industrial valleys as a basis for much of his work. Writing in English, [[Peter George (author)|Peter George]] was born in Treorchy and is best known as the Oscar-nominated screenwriter of [[Dr. Strangelove]], based on his book [[Red Alert (novel)|Red Alert]]. Reflecting the lives of the residents of the Rhondda, both [[Gwyn Thomas (novelist)|Gwyn Thomas]] and [[Ron Berry]] brought a realism to the industrial valleys missing in the more rose-tinted writings of [[Richard Llewellyn]].\n\n===Visual arts===\nThe area has not produced as notable a group of visual artists as it has writers, though in the 1950s a small group of students, brought together through a daily commute by train to the [[Cardiff College of Art]], came to prominence as the Rhondda Group.<ref name=\"BBC profile\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/ernest-zobole |title=Walesart, Ernest Zobole |work=BBC Wales online |accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref> Although it did not set up a school or have a manifesto, the group, which included Charles Burton, Ceri Barclay, Glyn Morgan, Thomas Hughes, Gwyn Evans, Nigel Flower, David Mainwaring, Ernest Zobole and Robert Thomas, formed an important artistic movement in 20th-century Welsh art.\n\nThe notable members of the group include [[Ernest Zobole]], a painter from Ystrad, whose expressionist work was deeply rooted in the juxtaposition of the industrialised buildings of the valleys against the green hills that surround them.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-ernest-zobole-1130792.html Obituary: Ernest Zobole], Independent.co.uk, 7 December 1999.</ref> Also from the Rhondda Fawr was the sculptor [[Robert Thomas (sculptor)|Robert Thomas]];<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-robert-thomas-1094862.html Stephens, Meic; Obituary: Robert Thomas] independent.co.uk, 21 May 1999.</ref> born in Cwmparc, his heavy-cast statues have become icons of contemporary Wales, with many of his works publicly displayed in Cardiff.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-robert-thomas-1094862.html |title=Obituary: Robert Thomas |first=Meic |last=Stephens |accessdate=28 September 2017 |date=28 May 1999 |work=independent.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Science and social science===\nIn sciences and social sciences, the Rhondda has provided important academics for Wales and on the world stage. [[Donald Davies]], born in Treorchy in 1924, was the co-inventor of [[packet switching]], a process enabling the exchange of information between computers, a feature which enabled the Internet.<ref> {{Cite web |url=http://www.thocp.net/biographies/davies_donald.htm |title=Donald W. Davies CBE, FRS |work=The History of Computing Project |author= |accessdate=3 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the social sciences, the Rhondda has produced the historian [[John Davies (historian)|John Davies]], an important voice on Welsh affairs, who was one of the most recognised faces and voices of 21st-century Welsh history, and was one of the main authors of ''The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales''. The Rhondda has also produced [[J. Gwyn Griffiths]], an eminent Egyptologist, who was also a member of the Cadwgan Circle. Griffiths and his wife [[K\u00e4the Bosse-Griffiths]] were influential writers and curators in the history of Egyptian lore. It is where a cluster of three internationally-distinguished social geographers spent their early lives: [[Michael Dear]]; David Hebert;<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Herbert8.]</ref>; and [[Kelvyn Jones]]. All three are Fellows of the [[Learned Society of Wales]]<ref>[https://www.learnedsociety.wales/fellow/david-herbert/.]</ref><ref>[https://www.learnedsociety.wales/fellow/michael-dear/.]</ref><ref>https://www.learnedsociety.wales/fellow/kelvyn-jones/</ref>. The political philosopher [[Brad Evans (author)|Brad Evans]], who has written many books on violence and global affairs, was also born in the valleys of South Wales.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Awdry-RailCo}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Carpenter |first=David J. |title=Rhondda Collieries |year=2000 |publisher=Tempus Publishing |location=Stroud, Gloucestershire |isbn=0-7524-1730-4}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Davies |first=John |author2=Jenkins, Nigel |title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales |year=2008 |publisher=University of Wales Press |location=Cardiff |isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Davis |first=Paul R. |title=Historic Rhondda |year=1989 |publisher=Hackman |location=Ynyshir |isbn=0-9508556-3-4 }}\n*{{Cite book |last=Hopkins |first=K.S. |title=Rhondda Past and Future |year=1975 |publisher=Rhondda Borough Council |location=Ferndale |isbn=}}\n*{{Cite book |last=John |first=Arthur H. |title=Glamorgan County History, Volume V, Industrial Glamorgan from 1700 to 1970 |year=1980 |publisher=University of Wales Press |location=Cardiff |isbn=}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Lewis |first=E.D. |title=The Rhondda Valleys |year=1959 |publisher=Phoenix House |location=London |isbn=}}\n*{{Cite book |last=May |first=John |title=Rhondda 1203 - 2003: The Story of the Two Valleys |year=2003 |publisher=Castle Publications |location=Caerphilly |isbn=1-871354-09-9}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Morgan |first=Prys |title=Glamorgan County History, Volume VI, Glamorgan Society 1780 to 1980 |year=1988 |publisher=University of Wales Press |location=Cardiff |isbn=0-904730-05-0}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=David |title=Fields of Praise, The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union 1881-1981 |year=1980 |publisher=University of Wales Press |location=Cardiff |isbn= 0-7083-0766-3}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Williams|first=Chris|title=Democratic Rhondda: politics and Society 1885-1951|year=1996|publisher=University of Wales Press|location=Cardiff}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080916191919/http://www.anglesey.info/Rhondda_Valley_Images.htm ''Rhondda Valleys Information and History''] \u2014 The history of the Rhondda Valleys with high resolution mining photographs.\n\n{{Rhondda Valley}}\n\n{{good article}}\n\n[[Category:Rhondda Valley| ]]\n[[Category:Valleys of Rhondda Cynon Taf]]\n", "name_user": "Wbm1058", "label": "safe", "comment": "Spelling correction; redirect bypass fromTonypandy RiotstoTonypandy riotsusingpopups", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhondda"}

The mouth of the lake hath many shoals, and the sea breaketh on them as it is cast out of the mouth of it.\"  The name of the existing town was obtained from the Bay and Inlet, which were originally named in 1614 \"Barendegat,\" or \"Inlet of the Breakers,\" by [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]] explorers of the coastline, referring to the waterway's turbulent channel.<ref>Lloyd, p. 42.</ref><ref>[[Henry Gannett|Gannett, Henry]].

The ship was noticed by Captain Andrew Steelman, who recruited local men to unload the cargo.  While at rest on the beach, the crews were attacked by Captain John Bacon, who was affiliated with the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]]. Almost all of Steelman's men were murdered in what became known as the Barnegat Light Massacre.<ref>Karch, p. 16.</ref>\n\nCaleb Parker, the first European permanent settler in the area, arrived to the Barnegat Inlet area in 1795.  By the 19th century, the northern stretches of Long Beach Island were known among early settlers for the wildlife and subsequent hunting, as well as a tourist destination for vacationing farmers and campers.  In 1814, portions of the lowlands and beaches were purchased by settlers Bart and Ruth Slaight, who built a small house and later, in 1825, a larger home to accommodate boarders.  The boardinghouse was later sold to Jacob Herring, which prompted the structure to become known as the Herring House.  The building lodged many of the visiting hunters, who primarily came from New York City and [[Philadelphia]].  Nearly a decade later, in 1834, Slaight sold {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land to the [[Federal government of the United States|United States Federal Government]] under the stipulation that no stores or taverns may be built, nor could the lands be used for cattle.\n\nThe first [[Barnegat Lighthouse|lighthouse tower]] was built in 1835 to coincide with the increased economic dependence on the inlet.  [[Whaling]] had been permitted in the area in 1678, timber was often freighted through from [[sawmill]]s on the mainland, and [[Cranberry Inlet]] (opened in 1750 to provide a shortcut for cargo ships) had recently been closed.\n\n===Brownsville===\nIn 1855, John M. Brown bought much of the land that makes up present-day Barnegat Light.  This purchase included the acquisition of Herring House, which was renamed Ashley House.  The first official name of the community thus became Brownsville.  During this time, a ''house of refuge'' was built to provide an unmanned shelter for shipwreck victims.  Despite several attempts at constructing [[jetty|jetties]], the powerful tides caused considerable erosion of the beaches and threatened both Barnegat Lighthouse and later the Oceanic Hotel.  The lighthouse collapsed into the sea in 1857 and a replacement lighthouse (already under construction in 1857) was completed in 1859.\n\nThe Brown family left the island after John Brown's son drowned at sea.<ref>Karch, p. 6.</ref>  The Brown family's land was sold at auction in 1869, and in 1874, Ashley House was sold to Charles Martin.  The [[United States Life-Saving Service]] built Station No. 17 in the area c. 1872.  C. 1875, the general store and post office were constructed near the intersection of 4th Street and Central Avenue.  The general store was originally run by Lucrecia Buttersworth and provided limited supplies\u2014largely due to the difficulty with transporting merchandise to the shop. In 1919, the general store was purchased by the Applegate family, a lighthouse keeper who was also a net fisherman.\n\n===Barnegat City===\n[[File:Barnegatout.jpg|thumb|left|upright|From the air, 2009]]\nIn 1881, the Barnegat City Improvement Company was formed by Benjamin Franklin Archer, prompting the name of the community to unofficially become Barnegat City.<ref>[http://www.barnegatlight.org/barnegat-light/history/ History], Borough of Barnegat Light. Accessed July 26, 2016.</ref> Adding \"city\" helped the new resort town capitalize on the success of Atlantic City.<ref>Lloyd, pgs. 41, 47.</ref> The plan succeeded, as the city became a popular tourist destination\u2014primarily for vacationers from New York City, who would travel by train to [[Toms River, New Jersey|Toms River]] and then travel by boat to Barnegat City. The SS ''Hesse'', a ship chartered by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], began providing transport into Barnegat City for passengers largely originating from New York City and [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]]. This ship was later replaced by the ''Connetquot''.  The Oceanic Hotel was built to meet the increasing lodging demands of the tourism industry, beginning construction in 1881 and completing construction in 1882. The hotel would later be relocated in response to encroaching waters, so as to avoid a similar fate as the first [[Barnegat Lighthouse]].\n\nThe Ashley House was sold to John Warner Kinsey in 1882, who renamed the building as the eponymous Kinsey Hotel. Kinsey would later move to nearby [[Harvey Cedars, New Jersey|Harvey Cedars]], abandoning the hotel. A new hotel, the Sans Souci, was built in 1883 with the intention of attracting winter sportsmen. A fourth hotel, The Social, opened to boarders in 1884. Between 1884 and 1886, a direct railroad connection was completed to increase the city's tourism capabilities. The first train reached Barnegat City on June 28, 1886. A large keeper's house was completed in 1889 by the Federal Lighthouse Bureau to house the three keepers and their families. In 1899, Benjamin Archer sold the Sans Souci, which was subsequently renamed the Sunset Hotel. During the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] kept watch for enemy ships and a signal house was constructed offshore; but the signal house was complete shortly after the peace was declared.\n\n[[Image:NJ LBI Lighthouse 04.JPG|thumb|right|Barnegat Lighthouse]]\nBarnegat City became part of Long Beach Township after the township's establishment in 1899. In 1904, the city declared itself an independent borough.<ref name=Story /> At this time, much of the northern area of Long Beach Island was undeveloped, causing citizens to feel separated from the rest of the township's communities.\n\nIn 1914, the Oceanic Hotel closed and the Sunset Hotel was purchased by John Barber. That same year, an automobile bridge was opened further south, improving access between the island and the mainland. In 1920, Ketzel's Bar was opened on West 7th Street by Paul Ketzel. This location provided rooms to local fisherman and was the prominent location in the city for nighttime entertainment. The bar was later purchased by \"Ma\" Kubel, resulting in the new name Kubel's Bar, a restaurant which continues to exist today. The bar began serving meals in a dining room addition and was known for its local parties featuring [[Norway|Norwegian]] dancing.\n\nA severe winter storm in 1920 destroyed most of the Oceanic Hotel as well as a large portion of the beaches, eroding the shore up to the base of the lighthouse and prompting the abandonment and removal of the keeper's house by the [[United States Lighthouse Service]]. The destruction of the hotel and continued erosion of the beaches caused the resort to become less popular, ultimately resulting in the discontinuation of train service to the city between 1923 and 1926. Barnegat City returned to its relatively secluded environment that it had experienced in its earlier days.\n\nThe city's [[fishery]] economy improved beginning with a fishery opened by Captain Dick Myers in 1920, whom the next year purchased {{convert|33|acre|m2}} between West 7th Street and the bay. In 1927, several [[Scandinavia]]n fisherman united to form the Independent Fishery. During this period, [[gillnet]]ting declined in popularity, but it would later gain a comeback in the 1950s. Also in the 1950s, dragger fishing was ended and [[tilefish]]ing began.\n\nThe Scandinavian fisherman founded the Independent Dock, which is now known as Viking Village and, today, provides a combined shopping and industrial establishment with both handcrafted goods and fresh seafood. Catches typically consist of [[scallop]]s, [[tuna]], [[swordfish]], tilefish, [[weakfish]], [[monkfish]], [[bluefish]], [[shad]], [[Squalidae|dogfish]], and various other types of in-shore fish. In the 1960s and 1970s, foreign [[Commercial trawler|trawlers]] were permitted to fish in the area.

Accessed July 26, 2016.</ref>  In 1950, the post office moved from the Applegate general store's location to a new location on 18th Street.  The building it replaced had itself been a general store and a gas station, both owned by Jens Jensen in 1920; who had given it to John Englesen in 1940 as a trade for a house on 19th Street.  The post office remained at this location until its current location on 10th Street was opened.  The site of the first post office, at the general store on 4th Street, remains today as the Inlet Deli.\n\nThe continued threat of storms such as the [[Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962]] reinforced concerns about the stability of Barnegat Light's beaches.  The construction of the existing [[jetty]] in the 1990s added a significant amount of land to the town, much of which was designated as parkland and now includes a bird sanctuary.  The jetty has provided stabilization to the shoreline along the inlet, but requires frequent [[dredging]].  In addition to the lighthouse, the borough continues to maintain a [[United States Coast Guard]] station, reflecting the continued presence of the former United States Life-Saving Service.<ref>[http://www.uscg.mil/d5/stabarnegat/Present.asp Station History - Barnegat Light], [[United States Coast Guard]].

The mouth of the lake hath many shoals, and the sea breaketh on them as it is cast out of the mouth of it.\"  The name of the existing town was obtained from the Bay and Inlet, which were originally named in 1614 \"Barendegat,\" or \"Inlet of the Breakers,\" by [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]] explorers of the coastline, referring to the waterway's turbulent channel.<ref>Lloyd, p. 42.</ref><ref>[[Henry Gannett|Gannett, Henry]].

The ship was noticed by Captain Andrew Steelman, who recruited local men to unload the cargo.  While at rest on the beach, the crews were attacked by Captain John Bacon, who was affiliated with the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]]. Almost all of Steelman's men were murdered in what became known as the Barnegat Light Massacre.<ref>Karch, p. 16.</ref>\n\nCaleb Parker, the first European permanent settler in the area, arrived to the Barnegat Inlet area in 1795.  By the 19th century, the northern stretches of Long Beach Island were known among early settlers for the wildlife and subsequent hunting, as well as a tourist destination for vacationing farmers and campers.  In 1814, portions of the lowlands and beaches were purchased by settlers Bart and Ruth Slaight, who built a small house and later, in 1825, a larger home to accommodate boarders.  The boardinghouse was later sold to Jacob Herring, which prompted the structure to become known as the Herring House.  The building lodged many of the visiting hunters, who primarily came from New York City and [[Philadelphia]].  Nearly a decade later, in 1834, Slaight sold {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land to the [[Federal government of the United States|United States Federal Government]] under the stipulation that no stores or taverns may be built, nor could the lands be used for cattle.\n\nThe first [[Barnegat Lighthouse|lighthouse tower]] was built in 1835 to coincide with the increased economic dependence on the inlet.  [[Whaling]] had been permitted in the area in 1678, timber was often freighted through from [[sawmill]]s on the mainland, and [[Cranberry Inlet]] (opened in 1750 to provide a shortcut for cargo ships) had recently been closed.\n\n===Brownsville===\nIn 1855, John M. Brown bought much of the land that makes up present-day Barnegat Light.  This purchase included the acquisition of Herring House, which was renamed Ashley House.  The first official name of the community thus became Brownsville.  During this time, a ''house of refuge'' was built to provide an unmanned shelter for shipwreck victims.  Despite several attempts at constructing [[jetty|jetties]], the powerful tides caused considerable erosion of the beaches and threatened both Barnegat Lighthouse and later the Oceanic Hotel.  The lighthouse collapsed into the sea in 1857 and a replacement lighthouse (already under construction in 1857) was completed in 1859.\n\nThe Brown family left the island after John Brown's son drowned at sea.<ref>Karch, p. 6.</ref>  The Brown family's land was sold at auction in 1869, and in 1874, Ashley House was sold to Charles Martin.  The [[United States Life-Saving Service]] built Station No. 17 in the area c. 1872.  C. 1875, the general store and post office were constructed near the intersection of 4th Street and Central Avenue.  The general store was originally run by Lucrecia Buttersworth and provided limited supplies\u2014largely due to the difficulty with transporting merchandise to the shop. In 1919, the general store was purchased by the Applegate family, a lighthouse keeper who was also a net fisherman.\n\n===Barnegat City===\n[[File:Barnegatout.jpg|thumb|left|upright|From the air, 2009]]\nIn 1881, the Barnegat City Improvement Company was formed by Benjamin Franklin Archer, prompting the name of the community to unofficially become Barnegat City.<ref>[http://www.barnegatlight.org/barnegat-light/history/ History], Borough of Barnegat Light. Accessed July 26, 2016.</ref> Adding \"city\" helped the new resort town capitalize on the success of Atlantic City.<ref>Lloyd, pgs. 41, 47.</ref> The plan succeeded, as the city became a popular tourist destination\u2014primarily for vacationers from New York City, who would travel by train to [[Toms River, New Jersey|Toms River]] and then travel by boat to Barnegat City. The SS ''Hesse'', a ship chartered by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], began providing transport into Barnegat City for passengers largely originating from New York City and [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]]. This ship was later replaced by the ''Connetquot''.  The Oceanic Hotel was built to meet the increasing lodging demands of the tourism industry, beginning construction in 1881 and completing construction in 1882. The hotel would later be relocated in response to encroaching waters, so as to avoid a similar fate as the first [[Barnegat Lighthouse]].\n\nThe Ashley House was sold to John Warner Kinsey in 1882, who renamed the building as the eponymous Kinsey Hotel. Kinsey would later move to nearby [[Harvey Cedars, New Jersey|Harvey Cedars]], abandoning the hotel. A new hotel, the Sans Souci, was built in 1883 with the intention of attracting winter sportsmen. A fourth hotel, The Social, opened to boarders in 1884. Between 1884 and 1886, a direct railroad connection was completed to increase the city's tourism capabilities. The first train reached Barnegat City on June 28, 1886. A large keeper's house was completed in 1889 by the Federal Lighthouse Bureau to house the three keepers and their families. In 1899, Benjamin Archer sold the Sans Souci, which was subsequently renamed the Sunset Hotel. During the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] kept watch for enemy ships and a signal house was constructed offshore; but the signal house was complete shortly after the peace was declared.\n\n[[Image:NJ LBI Lighthouse 04.JPG|thumb|right|Barnegat Lighthouse]]\nBarnegat City became part of Long Beach Township after the township's establishment in 1899. In 1904, the city declared itself an independent borough.<ref name=Story /> At this time, much of the northern area of Long Beach Island was undeveloped, causing citizens to feel separated from the rest of the township's communities.\n\nIn 1914, the Oceanic Hotel closed and the Sunset Hotel was purchased by John Barber. That same year, an automobile bridge was opened further south, improving access between the island and the mainland. In 1920, Ketzel's Bar was opened on West 7th Street by Paul Ketzel. This location provided rooms to local fisherman and was the prominent location in the city for nighttime entertainment. The bar was later purchased by \"Ma\" Kubel, resulting in the new name Kubel's Bar, a restaurant which continues to exist today. The bar began serving meals in a dining room addition and was known for its local parties featuring [[Norway|Norwegian]] dancing.\n\nA severe winter storm in 1920 destroyed most of the Oceanic Hotel as well as a large portion of the beaches, eroding the shore up to the base of the lighthouse and prompting the abandonment and removal of the keeper's house by the [[United States Lighthouse Service]]. The destruction of the hotel and continued erosion of the beaches caused the resort to become less popular, ultimately resulting in the discontinuation of train service to the city between 1923 and 1926. Barnegat City returned to its relatively secluded environment that it had experienced in its earlier days.\n\nThe city's [[fishery]] economy improved beginning with a fishery opened by Captain Dick Myers in 1920, whom the next year purchased {{convert|33|acre|m2}} between West 7th Street and the bay. In 1927, several [[Scandinavia]]n fisherman united to form the Independent Fishery. During this period, [[gillnet]]ting declined in popularity, but it would later gain a comeback in the 1950s. Also in the 1950s, dragger fishing was ended and [[tilefish]]ing began.\n\nThe Scandinavian fisherman founded the Independent Dock, which is now known as Viking Village and, today, provides a combined shopping and industrial establishment with both handcrafted goods and fresh seafood. Catches typically consist of [[scallop]]s, [[tuna]], [[swordfish]], tilefish, [[weakfish]], [[monkfish]], [[bluefish]], [[shad]], [[Squalidae|dogfish]], and various other types of in-shore fish. In the 1960s and 1970s, foreign [[Commercial trawler|trawlers]] were permitted to fish in the area.

The building it replaced had itself been a general store and a gas station, both owned by Jens Jensen in 1920; who had given it to John Englesen in 1940 as a trade for a house on 19th Street.  The post office remained at this location until its current location on 10th Street was opened.  The site of the first post office, at the general store on 4th Street, remains today as the Inlet Deli.\n\nThe continued threat of storms such as the [[Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962]] reinforced concerns about the stability of Barnegat Light's beaches.  The construction of the existing [[jetty]] in the 1990s added a significant amount of land to the town, much of which was designated as parkland and now includes a bird sanctuary.  The jetty has provided stabilization to the shoreline along the inlet, but requires frequent [[dredging]].  In addition to the lighthouse, the borough continues to maintain a [[United States Coast Guard]] station, reflecting the continued presence of the former United States Life-Saving Service.<ref>[http://www.uscg.mil/d5/stabarnegat/Present.asp Station History - Barnegat Light], [[United States Coast Guard]].
