Differently from his contemporaries and artists before him, Duccio was a master of tempera and managed to conquer the medium with delicacy and precision. There is no clear evidence that Duccio painted [[fresco]]es.{{sfn|Smart|1978 |page=39}}\n\nDuccio's style was similar to Byzantine art in some ways, with its gold backgrounds and familiar religious scenes, however it was also different and more experimental. Duccio began to break down the sharp lines of Byzantine art, and soften the figures. He used modeling (playing with light and dark colors) to reveal the figures underneath the heavy drapery; hands, faces, and feet became more rounded and three-dimensional. Duccio's paintings are inviting and warm with color. His pieces consisted of many delicate details and were sometimes inlaid with jewels or ornamental fabrics. Duccio was also noted for his complex organization of space. He organized his characters specifically and purposefully. In his \"[[Rucellai Madonna]]\" (c. 1285) the viewer can see all of these qualities at play.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Polzer |first=Joseph |title= A Question of Method: Quantitative Aspects of Art Historical Analysis in the Classification of Early Trecento Italian Painting Based on Ornamental Practice |journal=Mitteilungen des Kunsthistorisches Institutes in Florenz |year=2005 |volume=49 |issue=1/2 |pages=33\u2013100 |jstor= 27655375}}</ref>\n\nDuccio was also one of the first painters to put figures in architectural settings, as he began to explore and investigate depth and space. He also had a refined attention to emotion not seen in other painters at this time. The characters interact tenderly with each other; it is no longer Christ and the Virgin, it is mother and child. He flirts with naturalism, but his paintings are still awe inspiring. Duccio's figures seem to be otherworldly or heavenly, consisting of beautiful colors, soft hair, gracefulness and fabrics not available to mere humans.\n\nHe influenced many other painters, most notably [[Simone Martini]], and the brothers [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti|Ambrogio]] and [[Pietro Lorenzetti]].\n\n==Followers of Duccio==\nIn the course of his life, Duccio had many pupils, even if it is not known if these were true pupils, formed and matured artistically within his workshop, or simply painters who imitated his style. Many of these artists are anonymous, and their connection to Duccio has emerged only from analysis of a body of work with common stylistic traits. The first pupils, whom we can refer to as a group as first-generation followers, were active between about 1290 and 1320 and include the [[Master of Badia a Isola]], the [[Master of Citt\u00e0 di Castello]], the Aringhieri Master, the Master of the ''Collazioni dei Santi Padri'' and the Master of San Polo in Rosso.\n\nAnother group of followers, who could be termed followers of the second generation, were active between about 1300 and 1335 and include [[Segna di Bonaventura]], [[Ugolino di Nerio]], the Master of the Gondi Maest\u00e0, the Master of Monte Oliveto and the Master of Monterotondo. It should however be said that [[Segna di Bonaventura]] was already active prior to 1300, so that he overlaps as to period both the first and second generation of followers.\n\nA third group followed Duccio only at a distance of several years after his death, a fact which shows the impact his painting had on Siena and on Tuscany as a whole. The artists of this third group, active between about 1330 and 1350, include [[Segna di Bonaventura]]'s sons, that is, [[Niccol\u00f2 di Segna]] and Francesco di Segna, and a pupil of [[Ugolino di Nerio]], namely, the Master of Chianciano.\n\nSome of these artists were influenced by Duccio alone, to the point of creating a decided affinity or kinship between their works and his. Among these the [[Master of Badia a Isola]], and [[Ugolino di Nerio]], along with [[Segna di Bonaventura]] and their sons. Other artists were influenced also by other schools, and these include the Aringhieri Master (think of the massive volumes of [[Giotto]]), and the Master of the Gondi Maest\u00e0 (who shows the influence also of [[Simone Martini]]).\n\nThe case of [[Simone Martini]] and [[Pietro Lorenzetti]] is somewhat different. These two artists painted works that have affinities with Duccio: for [[Simone Martini|Simone]] from about 1305, and [[Pietro Lorenzetti|Pietro]] from about 1310 onwards. However, from the outset their work showed distinctive individual features, as can be seen in [[Simone Martini|Simone's]] Madonna and Child no. 583 (1305\u20131310) and in [[Pietro Lorenzetti|Pietro's]] ''Orsini Triptych'', painted at [[Assisi]] (about 1310\u20131315). Later the two developed styles with completely independent characteristics such that they acquired an artistic standing that elevates them well beyond being labelled simply as followers of Duccio.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Duccio di Buoninsegna - Annunciation - WGA06752.jpg|Annunciation\nFile:Duccio di Buoninsegna - Transfiguration - WGA06780.jpg|Transfiguration\nFile:Duccio - Triptych- Crucifixion and other Scenes - Google Art Project.jpg|Crucifixion Triptych\nFile:Duccio di Buoninsegna - Flight into Egypt - WGA06766.jpg|Flight into Egypt\nFile:Duccio di Buoninsegna - Disputation with the Doctors - WGA06768.jpg|[[Christ Among the Doctors|Disputation with the Doctors]]\nFile:Duccio di Buoninsegna - The Raising of Lazarus - Google Art Project.jpg|The Raising of Lazarus\nFile:Duccio di Buoninsegna - Christ and the Samaritan Woman - Google Art Project.jpg|Christ and the Samaritan Woman\nFile:MadonnaInTrono41.jpg|Maest\u00e0, detail\nFile:Madonna em Majestade dita Rucellai - Duccio.jpg|[[Rucellai Madonna]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Known surviving works==\n{{Category see also|Paintings by Duccio}}\n[[File:Duccio di Buoninsegna cat01.jpg|thumb|200px|''Madonna with Child'', c. 1300\u20131305.]]\n* ''Madonna with Child'' <small>\u2013 Tempera and gold on wood, [[Museo d'Arte Sacra della Val d'Arbia]], [[Buonconvento]], near Siena</small>\n* ''[[Gualino Madonna]]'' <small>\u2013 Tempera and gold on wood, [[Galleria Sabauda]], Turin </small>\n* ''Madonna with Child and two Angels'' (Also known as the ''Crevole Madonna'';

Both were major public commissions:<ref name=meta>{{cite web |title= Madonna and Child Duccio di Buoninsegna (Italian, active by 1278\u2013died 1318 Siena) |url= http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110003462 |publisher= Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref> the \"[[Rucellai Madonna]]\" ([[Galleria degli Uffizi]]), commissioned in April 1285 by the Compagnia del Laudesi di Maria Vergine for a chapel in [[Santa Maria Novella]] in [[Florence]]; and the [[Maest\u00e0 (Duccio)|Maest\u00e0]] commissioned for the high altar of [[Siena Cathedral]] in 1308, which Duccio completed by June 1311.{{sfn|Smart|1978|p=40}}\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Duccio di buoninsegna, madonna col bambino, 1300 ca..JPG|thumb|200px|Madonna with child, the child touching the virgin's veil]]\n[[File:Duccio di Buoninsegna, The Nativity with the Prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel, 1308-1311, NGA 10.jpg|thumb|left|''The Nativity with the Prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel'', 1308\u20131311, [[National Gallery of Art]]]]\n\nDuccio's known works are on [[panel paintings|wood panel]], painted in [[egg tempera]] and embellished with [[gold leaf]]. Differently from his contemporaries and artists before him, Duccio was a master of tempera and managed to conquer the medium with delicacy and precision. There is no clear evidence that Duccio painted [[fresco]]es.{{sfn|Smart|1978 |page=39}}\n\nDuccio's style was similar to Byzantine art in some ways, with its gold backgrounds and familiar religious scenes, however it was also different and more experimental. Duccio began to break down the sharp lines of Byzantine art, and soften the figures. He used modeling (playing with light and dark colors) to reveal the figures underneath the heavy drapery; hands, faces, and feet became more rounded and three-dimensional. Duccio's paintings are inviting and warm with color. His pieces consisted of many delicate details and were sometimes inlaid with jewels or ornamental fabrics. Duccio was also noted for his complex organization of space. He organized his characters specifically and purposefully. In his \"[[Rucellai Madonna]]\" (c. 1285) the viewer can see all of these qualities at play.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Polzer |first=Joseph |title= A Question of Method: Quantitative Aspects of Art Historical Analysis in the Classification of Early Trecento Italian Painting Based on Ornamental Practice |journal=Mitteilungen des Kunsthistorisches Institutes in Florenz |year=2005 |volume=49 |issue=1/2 |pages=33\u2013100 |jstor= 27655375}}</ref>\n\nDuccio was also one of the first painters to put figures in architectural settings, as he began to explore and investigate depth and space. He also had a refined attention to emotion not seen in other painters at this time. The characters interact tenderly with each other; it is no longer Christ and the Virgin, it is mother and child. He flirts with naturalism, but his paintings are still awe inspiring. Duccio's figures seem to be otherworldly or heavenly, consisting of beautiful colors, soft hair, gracefulness and fabrics not available to mere humans.\n\nHe influenced many other painters, most notably [[Simone Martini]], and the brothers [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti|Ambrogio]] and [[Pietro Lorenzetti]].\n\n==Followers of Duccio==\nIn the course of his life, Duccio had many pupils, even if it is not known if these were true pupils, formed and matured artistically within his workshop, or simply painters who imitated his style. Many of these artists are anonymous, and their connection to Duccio has emerged only from analysis of a body of work with common stylistic traits. The first pupils, whom we can refer to as a group as first-generation followers, were active between about 1290 and 1320 and include the [[Master of Badia a Isola]], the [[Master of Citt\u00e0 di Castello]], the Aringhieri Master, the Master of the ''Collazioni dei Santi Padri'' and the Master of San Polo in Rosso.\n\nAnother group of followers, who could be termed followers of the second generation, were active between about 1300 and 1335 and include [[Segna di Bonaventura]], [[Ugolino di Nerio]], the Master of the Gondi Maest\u00e0, the Master of Monte Oliveto and the Master of Monterotondo. It should however be said that [[Segna di Bonaventura]] was already active prior to 1300, so that he overlaps as to period both the first and second generation of followers.\n\nA third group followed Duccio only at a distance of several years after his death, a fact which shows the impact his painting had on Siena and on Tuscany as a whole. The artists of this third group, active between about 1330 and 1350, include [[Segna di Bonaventura]]'s sons, that is, [[Niccol\u00f2 di Segna]] and Francesco di Segna, and a pupil of [[Ugolino di Nerio]], namely, the Master of Chianciano.\n\nSome of these artists were influenced by Duccio alone, to the point of creating a decided affinity or kinship between their works and his. Among these the [[Master of Badia a Isola]], and [[Ugolino di Nerio]], along with [[Segna di Bonaventura]] and their sons. Other artists were influenced also by other schools, and these include the Aringhieri Master (think of the massive volumes of [[Giotto]]), and the Master of the Gondi Maest\u00e0 (who shows the influence also of [[Simone Martini]]).\n\nThe case of [[Simone Martini]] and [[Pietro Lorenzetti]] is somewhat different. These two artists painted works that have affinities with Duccio: for [[Simone Martini|Simone]] from about 1305, and [[Pietro Lorenzetti|Pietro]] from about 1310 onwards. However, from the outset their work showed distinctive individual features, as can be seen in [[Simone Martini|Simone's]] Madonna and Child no. 583 (1305\u20131310) and in [[Pietro Lorenzetti|Pietro's]] ''Orsini Triptych'', painted at [[Assisi]] (about 1310\u20131315). Later the two developed styles with completely independent characteristics such that they acquired an artistic standing that elevates them well beyond being labelled simply as followers of Duccio.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Duccio di Buoninsegna - Annunciation - WGA06752.jpg|Annunciation\nFile:Duccio di Buoninsegna - Transfiguration - WGA06780.jpg|Transfiguration\nFile:Duccio - Triptych- Crucifixion and other Scenes - Google Art Project.jpg|Crucifixion Triptych\nFile:Duccio di Buoninsegna - Flight into Egypt - WGA06766.jpg|Flight into Egypt\nFile:Duccio di Buoninsegna - Disputation with the Doctors - WGA06768.jpg|[[Christ Among the Doctors|Disputation with the Doctors]]\nFile:Duccio di Buoninsegna - The Raising of Lazarus - Google Art Project.jpg|The Raising of Lazarus\nFile:Duccio di Buoninsegna - Christ and the Samaritan Woman - Google Art Project.jpg|Christ and the Samaritan Woman\nFile:MadonnaInTrono41.jpg|Maest\u00e0, detail\nFile:Madonna em Majestade dita Rucellai - Duccio.jpg|[[Rucellai Madonna]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Known surviving works==\n{{Category see also|Paintings by Duccio}}\n[[File:Duccio di Buoninsegna cat01.jpg|thumb|200px|''Madonna with Child'', c. 1300\u20131305.]]\n* ''Madonna with Child'' <small>\u2013 Tempera and gold on wood, [[Museo d'Arte Sacra della Val d'Arbia]], [[Buonconvento]], near Siena</small>\n* ''[[Gualino Madonna]]'' <small>\u2013 Tempera and gold on wood, [[Galleria Sabauda]], Turin </small>\n* ''Madonna with Child and two Angels'' (Also known as the ''Crevole Madonna'';

A large number of riot police were on patrol at [[Tseung Kwan O station|Tseung Kwan O Station]] and the parking lot of Shangde Village at 5 pm, and observed and photographed the ground conditions at the upper level of the parking lot.

Some citizens were dissatisfied and asked to leave by police officers.<ref name=\"s5GV2\" />\n\n=== 9 April ===\nThe [[Court of Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Appeal]] ruled that the [[Government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong government]]\u2019s use of the [[Emergency Regulations Ordinance]] to formulate the [[Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation]] was constitutional. Part of the government\u2019s appeal was justified, and the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation was effective when protesters assembled illegally or without approval. The two provisions of \"Prohibition of masking during legal processions and meetings\" and \"Police officers have the right to require persons in public places to remove masked items\" remain unconstitutional. The Court of Appeal said that whether it is illegal assembly or unauthorised assembly, it is also necessary to deter people from wearing masked items and impede the proper implementation of the provisions of the [[Public Order Ordinance]]. Under such circumstances, the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation is constitutionally valid. However, it is unconstitutional to use the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation in the procession and assembly of the \"No Objection Notice\" issued by the police.<ref name=\"QO0Nd\" /><ref name=\"p4jsS\" />\n\n=== 15 April ===\nThe [[Tuen Mun]] [[Magistrates' Court (Hong Kong)|Magistrates\u2019 Courts]] sentenced a 21-year-old male barista, who burned and trampled on the flag outside the Tuen Mun Town Hall during a confrontation in Tuen Mun on September 21, 2019, to 240-hour social service order.<ref name=\"PbX7X\" />\n\n=== 18 April ===\n[[Hong Kong Police Force|Hong Kong police]] arrested 15 [[Pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|Democrats]] in the morning of 18 April.

During the protest police officers in the police station spoke to the protesters three times alleging that protesters at the scene were involved in violation of the \"restriction order\" and demanded them to disperse. By 4 pm Fu Zhenzhong, the founder of the Hong Kong Defence Movement, and several pro-police protesters were on the scene against the pro-democracy protesters who where holing a sit-in protest.<ref name=\"adrM2\" />\n\nThe arrests attracted the attention of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British]] and [[Federal government of the United States|American]] governments and several international human rights organisations and the [[News|media]].

Many protesters chanted slogans and waved flags. The police dispatched a large number of police. Officers and police cars where on patrol. By about 6:40, Eastern Commander Wei Zhida, together with a large number of riot police officers holding shields and [[pepper spray]], entered the mall from different locations to disperse the protesters, accusing them of violating the \"restriction order\". The police asks people in the mall to leave one by one.<ref name=\"57VaF\" /> At about 7 o'clock in the evening, the riot police with anti-riot guns entered the second floor of the mall from the underground. The scene was chaotic. During the period, a police officer pointed at reporter with pepper spray. Police officers later pulled up the cordon and some people were stopped and searched outside the mall. At about 8:00, the mall issued a broadcast indicating that it was about to close.<ref name=\"91Orr\" />\n\nSome protesters stayed on nearby roads. The police used a loudspeaker to read the \"Polymerism Restriction Order\", raised a blue flag warning at Yan Palace Pavilion, and began to disperse the crowed.

Afterwards, he could only blink and became unconscious. Police had allowed first-aiders to enter the scene after a delay of 5 minutes.

Before the event, at least 14 police cars were parked in the General Post Office, outside the [[Hong Kong station|Hong Kong Station MTR]] and the [[Exchange Square (Hong Kong)|Exchange Square]] bus station, and a large number of uniformed police officers were on patrol at the entrances of the shopping malls. By 6:30, two groups of police officers entered multiple floors of the mall and set up a blockade line in the atrium to drive away the citizens and reporter. The police used a megaphone to say that the restraining order was in effect, and warned the public not to gather in the shopping mall, as many shops closed their doors. Another group of police officers stopped several citizens outside the atrium and shops, and issued fixed penalty notices. Liu Dingcheng, a Hong Kong businessman at the scene, criticised the police for not giving a time limit for the public to leave, nor for warning. He believed that the police officers were unreasonable and would not pay a fine. Some people just after work think that the police abuse the \"restriction order\" to charge the public.<ref name=\"VJ3ss\" />\n\nAt about 7 pm, [[Hui Chi-fung]] ,a member of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]], was present and asked police officers not to enter the mall to disturb the public. Thinking that the police officers would make the scene more chaotic and stop more people gathering. Later, [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] and [[Sai Wan|Western District]] Councillors, [[Sam Yip]], Huang Yongzhi and Ren Jiaer were also present. Police officers briefly left the IFC mall, during which citizens dressed as [[North Korea|North Korean]] leader [[Kim Jong-un|Kim Jong Un]] appeared. By about 7:30 in the evening, nearly 200 uniformed police officers entered into the mall again to intercept many protesters, causing dissatisfaction among the citizens present, and some protester stayed in the mall to sing and chant slogans. The police left the mall at 9 pm and went to the B1 exit of Hong Kong Station to intercept the public. Seven young people who returned to the city from [[Cheung Chau]] said they were intercepted when entering the mall. They were brought to the station to register their [[Identity document|ID cards]] before they were released.<ref name=\"ZprkK\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"8dRLE\">{{Cite

anti-extradition bill protests}}\n\nTimeline of April [[2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests]]. The [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] has caused a decline in the number and scale of the protests with most protest related activities happening online especially on games like [[Animal Crossing]].<ref name=\"8dRLE\" /><ref name=\"VdfFn\" /> Resulting in sail of Animal Crossing stopping in [[Censorship in China|China]].<ref name=\"WG4Ik\" />\n\n== Events ==\n=== 8 April ===\nProtesters mourned the death of Zhou Zile, who passed away 5 mouths ago. A large number of riot police were on patrol at [[Tseung Kwan O station|Tseung Kwan O Station]] and the parking lot of Shangde Village at 5 pm, and observed and photographed the ground conditions at the upper level of the parking lot. Under the \"Limitation Order\", only a small number of citizens lay flowers outside the Suntech parking lot. Some citizens were dissatisfied and asked to leave by police officers.<ref name=\"s5GV2\" />\n\n=== 9 April ===\nThe [[Court of Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Appeal]] ruled that the [[Government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong government]]\u2019s use of the [[Emergency Regulations Ordinance]] to formulate the [[Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation]] was constitutional. Part of the government\u2019s appeal was justified, and the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation was effective when protesters assembled illegally or without approval. The two provisions of \"Prohibition of masking during legal processions and meetings\" and \"Police officers have the right to require persons in public places to remove masked items\" remain unconstitutional. The Court of Appeal said that whether it is illegal assembly or unauthorised assembly, it is also necessary to deter people from wearing masked items and impede the proper implementation of the provisions of the [[Public Order Ordinance]]. Under such circumstances, the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation is constitutionally valid. However, it is unconstitutional to use the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation in the procession and assembly of the \"No Objection Notice\" issued by the police.<ref name=\"QO0Nd\" /><ref name=\"p4jsS\" />\n\n=== 15 April ===\nThe [[Tuen Mun]] [[Magistrates' Court (Hong Kong)|Magistrates\u2019 Courts]] sentenced a 21-year-old male barista, who burned and trampled on the flag outside the Tuen Mun Town Hall during a confrontation in Tuen Mun on September 21, 2019, to 240-hour social service order.<ref name=\"PbX7X\" />\n\n=== 18 April ===\n[[Hong Kong Police Force|Hong Kong police]] arrested 15 [[Pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|Democrats]] in the morning of 18 April.

During the protest police officers in the police station spoke to the protesters three times alleging that protesters at the scene were involved in violation of the \"restriction order\" and demanded them to disperse. By 4 pm Fu Zhenzhong, the founder of the Hong Kong Defence Movement, and several pro-police protesters were on the scene against the pro-democracy protesters who where holing a sit-in protest.<ref name=\"adrM2\" />\n\nThe arrests attracted the attention of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British]] and [[Federal government of the United States|American]] governments and several international human rights organisations and the [[News|media]]. A total of 5 organisations including the [[International Bar Association]], the [[Law Society of England and Wales]] and the [[International Commission of Jurists]] issued a statement concerned about the arrest of 15 Democrats and believed that the arrests reflected the continued impact of Hong Kong\u2019s [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] and right to protest.<ref name=\"myvXf\" /> Former [[Governor of Hong Kong]] [[Chris Patten]] criticised this as not the rule of law, but the actions of an [[authoritarian government]].<ref name=\"GsfFN\" /> [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Mike Pompeo]] issued a statement condemning the arrest, which is not in accordance with the rule of law mentioned in the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]]. The [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] said on [[Twitter]] that Hong Kong\u2019s democracy and [[human rights]] continue to be violated, urging the White House to implement the [[Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act]]. <ref name=\"u84Gr\" /> On April 23, more than 30 members of the [[European Parliament]] issued two co-signed open letters condemning the political prosecution of Hong Kong democrats by the Hong Kong government.<ref name=\"05WCv\" />\n\nA government spokesman pointed out that the relevant cases have entered the [[judicial process]] and no one should make comments about unfounded speculations.<ref name=\"RBwJ3\" /> A spokesperson form the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region said that he expressed strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to the [[European Parliament]]\u2019s criticism, referring to the open letter as \u201chypocrisy and arrogance on the issue of Hong Kong\".<ref name=\"JdLRQ\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of those arrested\n!Political Party\n!Name\n!Previous / Current Public Office\n|-\n|[[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]]\n|[[Martin Lee]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|Democratic Party\n|[[Albert Ho]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|Democratic Party\n|[[Yeung Sum]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|Democratic Party\n|[[Sin Chung-kai]]\n|Current [[Kwai Tsing District Council]] Chairman\n|-\n|Democratic Party\n|[[Richard Tsoi]]\n|\n|-\n|[[League of Social Democrats]]\n|[[Leung Kwok-hung]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|League of Social Democrats\n|[[Raphael Wong]]\n|\n|-\n|League of Social Democrats\n|[[Avery Ng]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Labour Party]]\n|[[Lee Cheuk-yan]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|Labour Party\n|[[Cyd Ho]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|[[Civic Party]]\n|[[Margaret Ng]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|[[Neighbourhood and Worker's Service Centre]]\n|[[Leung Yiu-chung]]\n|Current legislator\n|-\n|[[Independent politician|Independent]]\n|[[Au Nok-hin]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|Independent\n|[[Jimmy Lai]]\n|Founder of [[Next Digital]]\n|-\n|Independent\n|Chen Haohuan\n|\n|}\n\n=== 19 April ===\nThe daughter and friends of an over 50 year old woman with asthma who, since October 2019, has been to the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong conflict|demonstrating at the Chinese University of Hong Kong]] to protect the younger protesters inhaled tear gas and was admitted to hospital due to [[Shortness of breath|dyspnea]] but she eventually died at home on 2 December, 2019 due to dyspnea.

After pleading guilty, he was initially sentenced to a 200-hour social service order. The [[Government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong government]] appealed to the [[Court of Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Appeal]] changed the sentence to 20 days in [[prison]].<ref name=\"zYXnW\" />\n\n=== 26 April ===\nAt 6:20 in the evening, about 300 protesters participated in a \"sing with you\" activity on multiple floors of the [[Cityplaza]]. Many protesters chanted slogans and waved flags. The police dispatched a large number of police. Officers and police cars where on patrol. By about 6:40, Eastern Commander Wei Zhida, together with a large number of riot police officers holding shields and [[pepper spray]], entered the mall from different locations to disperse the protesters, accusing them of violating the \"restriction order\". The police asks people in the mall to leave one by one.<ref name=\"57VaF\" /> At about 7 o'clock in the evening, the riot police with anti-riot guns entered the second floor of the mall from the underground. The scene was chaotic. During the period, a police officer pointed at reporter with pepper spray. Police officers later pulled up the cordon and some people were stopped and searched outside the mall. At about 8:00, the mall issued a broadcast indicating that it was about to close.<ref name=\"91Orr\" />\n\nSome protesters stayed on nearby roads. The police used a loudspeaker to read the \"Polymerism Restriction Order\", raised a blue flag warning at Yan Palace Pavilion, and began to disperse the crowed.

By 6:30, two groups of police officers entered multiple floors of the mall and set up a blockade line in the atrium to drive away the citizens and reporter. The police used a megaphone to say that the restraining order was in effect, and warned the public not to gather in the shopping mall, as many shops closed their doors. Another group of police officers stopped several citizens outside the atrium and shops, and issued fixed penalty notices. Liu Dingcheng, a Hong Kong businessman at the scene, criticised the police for not giving a time limit for the public to leave, nor for warning. He believed that the police officers were unreasonable and would not pay a fine. Some people just after work think that the police abuse the \"restriction order\" to charge the public.<ref name=\"VJ3ss\" />\n\nAt about 7 pm, [[Hui Chi-fung]] ,a member of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]], was present and asked police officers not to enter the mall to disturb the public.

She had two older sisters, Carol and Beverley.<ref>Lefko, p.8</ref> She attended high school in Biggar, and moved to Saskatoon to attend university. She started out towards a degree in [[computer science]], but transferred after her first year to work for a degree in [[physical education]].<ref name=\"Lefko, p.17\"/> She convocated with a Bachelor of Science in Physical Education in 1985.<ref>Lefko, p.21</ref>\n\nIn 1993, teammate Marcia Gudereit introduced Schmirler to Shannon England. On June 22, 1996, they were married.<ref>Lefko, p. 53</ref> In 1997, Schmirler was pregnant with their first child. When this information was revealed to reporters at the Scott Tournament of Hearts, they jokingly dubbed her \"Schmirler the Hurler\". On September 15, 1997, their daughter Sara Marion was born.<ref>Lefko, pp. 57\u201358</ref> In April 1999, Sandra's father Art Schmirler died from [[esophageal cancer]].<ref name=regina/> On June 30, 1999, the couple's second daughter, Jenna Shirley, was born.<ref>Lefko, p. 93</ref>\n\n===Illness and death===\nAfter Jenna's birth, Schmirler experienced many health problems. She had suffered from back pain, which was thought to be pregnancy related, and following Jenna's birth, she began to suffer from stomach pains.<ref name=regina/> Tests showed that a cancerous node the size of a fist had developed behind her heart.<ref name=\"nytobit\"/><ref>Lefko, p. 97</ref> As her condition worsened, she underwent surgery on September 6, 1999. During surgery, a dead piece of the tumour broke off and released a blood clot into her lung. Her heart stopped beating, and only emergency heart massage kept her alive.<ref>Lefko, pp. 94\u201395</ref> Almost a month after being diagnosed with cancer, doctors finally provided a specific diagnosis \u2013 [[adenocarcinoma|metastatic adenocarcinoma]], with an unknown primary site.<ref name=regina/> Because no one could pin down where the cancer came from, Sandra referred to it as \"the cancer from Mars.\"<ref name=\"Lefko, p.101\">Lefko, p. 101</ref> In addition to [[chemotherapy]] and radiation, Schmirler explored [[orthomolecular medicine]] through the Canadian Cancer Research Group. This form of [[alternative medicine]] involves large doses of vitamins and nutrients.<ref name=\"Lefko, p.101\"/>\n\nIn 2000, Schmirler worked as colour commentator for CBC during [[Canadian Junior Curling Championships|Canada's national junior curling championships]].<ref name=\"libarchcan\"/><ref>Lefko, p. 110</ref> During her illness, Schmirler had been largely removed from the public eye. While in [[Moncton]] for the championships, Schmirler held a press conference to update her situation. In speaking publicly about her ordeal for the first time, Schmirler spared few details about what she had gone through, while also expressing her hope for the future: \"There were three goals I had coming out of this thing, and the first one was to look after my family. And the second one...because I curl so much, I've never taken a hot vacation, so I'm going to put my feet in the sand in a warm place. And the last one was to actually be here today, and I thank CBC, I thank Lawrence (Kimber), and Joan Mead.\"<ref>Lefko, pp. 113\u2013120</ref>\n\nAfter returning from Moncton, Schmirler felt physically well, but suffered a setback when a CAT scan revealed spots around her lungs. The decision was made not to proceed with further chemotherapy, but she continued with the orthomolecular therapy.<ref>Lefko, p. 128</ref> She had been scheduled to work the [[2000 Scott Tournament of Hearts]], but was unable to do so. She faxed a statement from the hospital, which was read by [[The Sports Network|TSN's]] [[Vic Rauter]]. \"I'm still fighting hard and I still hope to make it to the [[Tim Hortons Brier|Brier]], not playing but talking. For Saskatchewan, I was hoping to be in your green shoes (at the Scott). But keep things in perspective. There are other things in life besides curling, which I have found. But I hope to be on the curling trail again next year. And I'll see you all in Sudbury (the next Scott site) in 2001. Your curling friend, Sandra.\"<ref>Lefko, p. 133</ref> However, the optimism in her statement belied the seriousness of her condition. She had been moved to [[palliative care]].<ref>Lefko, pp. 133\u2013134</ref> She died in her sleep at the [[Pasqua Hospital]] Palliative Care Unit<ref name=\"nytobit\"/> on the morning of March 2, 2000 at age 36.<ref name=regina/><ref name=\"CBC1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan-mourns-sandra-schmirler-1.228850|title=Saskatchewan mourns Sandra Schmirler|date=March 2, 2000|publisher=CBC|accessdate=November 9, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"nytobit\"/><ref name=\"msn\"/>\n\nHer death caused reactions not just within Saskatchewan and the curling community, but also across the country. Canadian Prime Minister [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] said in a statement: <blockquote>All Canadians have been touched by the untimely death of Sandra Schmirler. Most of us came to know her through her exploits as a champion curler and as an exemplary sports ambassador for Canada.

She will be sorely missed.<ref name=\"nytobit\"/><ref>Lefko, pp. 141\u2013142</ref></blockquote> In honour of Schmirler, flags at provincial office buildings in Saskatchewan were lowered to half-staff.<ref name=\"nytobit\"/>\n\nTSN offered to broadcast her funeral live and to make the signal available to any other stations at no charge. Her husband, Shannon England, agreed to the broadcast on the condition that the family would not be shown during the service.

Their vision was to create a living legacy in honour of this amazing woman who touched the hearts of so many Canadians from coast to coast to coast.\nWhile she lost her biggest battle, her legacy lives on. The lives of countless babies born premature and critically ill have been, and continue to be saved, with life-saving equipment the Foundation has funded in her name. \nMillions of dollars have been given to hospital NICUs in every province, the Yukon and Northwest Territories to fund life-saving equipment for babies born too soon, too small or too sick. This list continues to grow every year with the generous support of our many donors.\nSandra reached out to her country in sickness and in health and made us understand what really matters in life. While we mourn her passing, we celebrate the lasting legacy she left behind.\u201d Robin Wilson\n\nOn January 7, 2009, Sandra was named the winner of the 2009 World Curling Freytag Award (later incorporated into the [[WCF Hall of Fame]]).

She had two older sisters, Carol and Beverley.<ref>Lefko, p.8</ref> She attended high school in Biggar, and moved to Saskatoon to attend university. She started out towards a degree in [[computer science]], but transferred after her first year to work for a degree in [[physical education]].<ref name=\"Lefko, p.17\"/> She convocated with a Bachelor of Science in Physical Education in 1985.<ref>Lefko, p.21</ref>\n\nIn 1993, teammate Marcia Gudereit introduced Schmirler to Shannon England. On June 22, 1996, they were married.<ref>Lefko, p. 53</ref> In 1997, Schmirler was pregnant with their first child. When this information was revealed to reporters at the Scott Tournament of Hearts, they jokingly dubbed her \"Schmirler the Hurler\". On September 15, 1997, their daughter Sara Marion was born.<ref>Lefko, pp. 57\u201358</ref> In April 1999, Sandra's father Art Schmirler died from [[esophageal cancer]].<ref name=regina/> On June 30, 1999, the couple's second daughter, Jenna Shirley, was born.<ref>Lefko, p. 93</ref>\n\n===Illness and death===\nAfter Jenna's birth, Schmirler experienced many health problems. She had suffered from back pain, which was thought to be pregnancy related, and following Jenna's birth, she began to suffer from stomach pains.<ref name=regina/> Tests showed that a cancerous node the size of a fist had developed behind her heart.<ref name=\"nytobit\"/><ref>Lefko, p. 97</ref> As her condition worsened, she underwent surgery on September 6, 1999. During surgery, a dead piece of the tumour broke off and released a blood clot into her lung. Her heart stopped beating, and only emergency heart massage kept her alive.<ref>Lefko, pp. 94\u201395</ref> Almost a month after being diagnosed with cancer, doctors finally provided a specific diagnosis \u2013 [[adenocarcinoma|metastatic adenocarcinoma]], with an unknown primary site.<ref name=regina/> Because no one could pin down where the cancer came from, Sandra referred to it as \"the cancer from Mars.\"<ref name=\"Lefko, p.101\">Lefko, p. 101</ref> In addition to [[chemotherapy]] and radiation, Schmirler explored [[orthomolecular medicine]] through the Canadian Cancer Research Group.

While in [[Moncton]] for the championships, Schmirler held a press conference to update her situation. In speaking publicly about her ordeal for the first time, Schmirler spared few details about what she had gone through, while also expressing her hope for the future: \"There were three goals I had coming out of this thing, and the first one was to look after my family. And the second one...because I curl so much, I've never taken a hot vacation, so I'm going to put my feet in the sand in a warm place. And the last one was to actually be here today, and I thank CBC, I thank Lawrence (Kimber), and Joan Mead.\"<ref>Lefko, pp. 113\u2013120</ref>\n\nAfter returning from Moncton, Schmirler felt physically well, but suffered a setback when a CAT scan revealed spots around her lungs. The decision was made not to proceed with further chemotherapy, but she continued with the orthomolecular therapy.<ref>Lefko, p. 128</ref> She had been scheduled to work the [[2000 Scott Tournament of Hearts]], but was unable to do so.

One of London's [[London Underground infrastructure#Sub surface network and deep-level tube lines|deep-level railways]], Central line trains are smaller than those on British main lines.\n\nThe line was opened as the [[Central London Railway]] in 1900, crossing central London on an east\u2013west axis, as the third deep-level Tube line to be built after electric trains made them possible. It was later extended to the western suburb of Ealing. After the Second World War, the line was expanded considerably into the recently constructed suburbs, taking over steam-hauled outer-suburban routes to the borders of London and beyond to the east. This realised plans that had been delayed by the war, when construction stopped and the unused tunnels were used as air-raid shelters and factories. However, suburban growth proved to be less than expected, and of the planned expansions one (to {{rws|Denham}}, Buckinghamshire) was cut short due to its location in the Metropolitan Green Belt and another (to {{rws|Ongar}}) ultimately closed in 1994 due to low patronage; the section between Epping and Ongar later became part of the [[Epping Ongar Railway]]. The Central line has mostly been operated by [[automatic train operation]] since a major refurbishment in the 1990s, although all trains still carry drivers. Many of its stations are of historic interest, from turn-of-the-century Central London Railway buildings in west London to post-war modernist designs on the West Ruislip and Hainault branches, as well as Victorian-era [[Eastern Counties Railway]] and [[Great Eastern Railway]] buildings east of {{stn|Stratford}}, from when the line to Epping was a rural branch line.\n\nIn terms of total passengers, the Central line is the second busiest on the Underground.

Both the [[City and South London Railway]] and the [[Waterloo and City Railway]] were lit by gas lamps, primarily because the power stations for these lines were designed with no spare capacity to power electric lighting. With the white glazed tiling, all underground Central London Railway platforms were very brightly lit. The use of electric lighting was further made possible because the Central London was also the first tube railway to use [[Alternating current|AC]] electrical distribution{{efn|Power was generated at 5000 volts at {{frac|33|1|3}} Hertz from six 850 kW generators at Wood Lane.}} and the [[Electrical substation|substation]] [[transformer]]s were easily able to provide convenient voltages to run the lighting. Earlier tube lines generated [[DC power]] at the voltage required to run the trains (500 volts).\n\nThe line between Shepherd's Bush and Bank was formally opened on 30 June 1900, public services beginning on 30 July.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|pp=56\u201357}} With a uniform fare of 2[[\u00a3sd|d]] the railway became known as the \"Twopenny Tube\".{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|pp=56\u201357}} It was initially operated by [[electric locomotive]]s hauling carriages, but the locomotive's considerable unsprung weight{{efn|The CLR locomotives had been designed such that the motor armatures were built directly on the axles. This was intended to reduce noise from gearboxes which would otherwise be necessary.}} caused much vibration in the buildings above the line, and the railway rebuilt the locomotives to incorporate geared drives. This allowed higher-speed and lighter motors to be used, which reduced the overall weight of the locomotive as well as the unsprung weight. The railway also tried an alternative approach: it converted four coaches to accommodate motors and control gear. Two of these experimental motor coaches were used in a 6-coach train, the control gear being operated by the system used on the Waterloo and City Railway.{{efn|Although the Board of Trade forbade this system being used on any future passenger railway, it was used in this case because the trains were experimental and were forbidden to carry fare-paying passengers.}} The modified locomotives were a considerable improvement, but the motor coaches of an even lower weight were much better still. The CLR ordered 64 new motor cars{{efn|The CLR adopted the American term of 'car' rather than 'coach' with the introduction of the Electrical Multiple Unit.}} designed to use [[Frank J. Sprague|Sprague]]'s recently developed [[Multiple-unit train control|traction control]] system. The CLR was exclusively using the resulting [[electric multiple units]] by 1903.{{sfn|Green|1987|p=22}}\n\nIn July 1907, the fare was increased to 3d for journeys of more than seven or eight stations. The line was extended westwards with a loop serving a single platform at [[Wood Lane (Central line) tube station|Wood Lane]] for the 1908 [[Franco-British Exhibition (1908)|Franco-British Exhibition]]. A reduced fare of 1d, for a journey of three or fewer stations, was introduced in 1909, and season tickets became available from 1911. The extension to Liverpool Street opened the following year, providing access to the [[Great Eastern Railway|Great Eastern]] station and the adjacent [[Broad Street railway station (London)|Broad Street]] station by escalators. The Central London Railway was absorbed into the [[Underground Group]] on 1 January 1913.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|pp=58\u201359}}\n\nIn 1911, the [[Great Western Railway]] won permission for a line from [[Ealing Broadway station|Ealing Broadway]] to a station near to the CLR's [[Shepherd's Bush tube station|Shepherd's Bush]] station, with a connection to the [[West London Railway]], and agreement to connect the line to the Central London Railway and for the CLR to run trains to Ealing Broadway.

[[London Underground]] line that runs through central London, from {{lus|Epping}}, Essex, in the north-east to {{lus|Ealing Broadway}} and {{lus|West Ruislip}} in the west. Coloured red on the [[Tube map]], the line serves 49 stations over {{convert|46|mi}}.<ref name=\"Line Facts\" /> It is one of only two lines on the Underground network to cross the [[Greater London]] boundary, the other being the [[Metropolitan line]]. One of London's [[London Underground infrastructure#Sub surface network and deep-level tube lines|deep-level railways]], Central line trains are smaller than those on British main lines.\n\nThe line was opened as the [[Central London Railway]] in 1900, crossing central London on an east\u2013west axis, as the third deep-level Tube line to be built after electric trains made them possible. It was later extended to the western suburb of Ealing. After the Second World War, the line was expanded considerably into the recently constructed suburbs, taking over steam-hauled outer-suburban routes to the borders of London and beyond to the east. This realised plans that had been delayed by the war, when construction stopped and the unused tunnels were used as air-raid shelters and factories. However, suburban growth proved to be less than expected, and of the planned expansions one (to {{rws|Denham}}, Buckinghamshire) was cut short due to its location in the Metropolitan Green Belt and another (to {{rws|Ongar}}) ultimately closed in 1994 due to low patronage; the section between Epping and Ongar later became part of the [[Epping Ongar Railway]]. The Central line has mostly been operated by [[automatic train operation]] since a major refurbishment in the 1990s, although all trains still carry drivers. Many of its stations are of historic interest, from turn-of-the-century Central London Railway buildings in west London to post-war modernist designs on the West Ruislip and Hainault branches, as well as Victorian-era [[Eastern Counties Railway]] and [[Great Eastern Railway]] buildings east of {{stn|Stratford}}, from when the line to Epping was a rural branch line.\n\nIn terms of total passengers, the Central line is the second busiest on the Underground. In 2016/17 over 280&nbsp;million passenger journeys were recorded on the line.<ref name=\"Perdata1617\">{{cite web |url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/up_to_date_per_line_london_under#incoming-1109167 |title=Up to date per line London Underground usage statistics |publisher=[[TheyWorkForYou]] |date=29 April 2018}}</ref> It currently operates the second-most frequent service on the network, with 34 trains per hour (tph) operating for half-an-hour in the westbound direction during the morning peak, and between 27 and 30 tph during the rest of the peak.<ref>{{cite web|title=Central Line Timetable|url=https://tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/wtt-67-central-15-september-2013.pdf|publisher=TfL|accessdate=7 July 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415231448/http://tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/wtt-67-central-15-september-2013.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This makes the Central line the busiest and most intensively-used railway line in the United Kingdom: it is the only Tube line running east\u2013west through the central core of London, running under [[Oxford Street]] and the financial centre of the [[City of London]].

Both the [[City and South London Railway]] and the [[Waterloo and City Railway]] were lit by gas lamps, primarily because the power stations for these lines were designed with no spare capacity to power electric lighting. With the white glazed tiling, all underground Central London Railway platforms were very brightly lit. The use of electric lighting was further made possible because the Central London was also the first tube railway to use [[Alternating current|AC]] electrical distribution{{efn|Power was generated at 5000 volts at {{frac|33|1|3}} Hertz from six 850 kW generators at Wood Lane.}} and the [[Electrical substation|substation]] [[transformer]]s were easily able to provide convenient voltages to run the lighting. Earlier tube lines generated [[DC power]] at the voltage required to run the trains (500 volts).\n\nThe line between Shepherd's Bush and Bank was formally opened on 30 June 1900, public services beginning on 30 July.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|pp=56\u201357}} With a uniform fare of 2[[\u00a3sd|d]] the railway became known as the \"Twopenny Tube\".{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|pp=56\u201357}} It was initially operated by [[electric locomotive]]s hauling carriages, but the locomotive's considerable unsprung weight{{efn|The CLR locomotives had been designed such that the motor armatures were built directly on the axles. This was intended to reduce noise from gearboxes which would otherwise be necessary.}} caused much vibration in the buildings above the line, and the railway rebuilt the locomotives to incorporate geared drives. This allowed higher-speed and lighter motors to be used, which reduced the overall weight of the locomotive as well as the unsprung weight. The railway also tried an alternative approach: it converted four coaches to accommodate motors and control gear. Two of these experimental motor coaches were used in a 6-coach train, the control gear being operated by the system used on the Waterloo and City Railway.{{efn|Although the Board of Trade forbade this system being used on any future passenger railway, it was used in this case because the trains were experimental and were forbidden to carry fare-paying passengers.}} The modified locomotives were a considerable improvement, but the motor coaches of an even lower weight were much better still. The CLR ordered 64 new motor cars{{efn|The CLR adopted the American term of 'car' rather than 'coach' with the introduction of the Electrical Multiple Unit.}} designed to use [[Frank J. Sprague|Sprague]]'s recently developed [[Multiple-unit train control|traction control]] system. The CLR was exclusively using the resulting [[electric multiple units]] by 1903.{{sfn|Green|1987|p=22}}\n\nIn July 1907, the fare was increased to 3d for journeys of more than seven or eight stations. The line was extended westwards with a loop serving a single platform at [[Wood Lane (Central line) tube station|Wood Lane]] for the 1908 [[Franco-British Exhibition (1908)|Franco-British Exhibition]]. A reduced fare of 1d, for a journey of three or fewer stations, was introduced in 1909, and season tickets became available from 1911. The extension to Liverpool Street opened the following year, providing access to the [[Great Eastern Railway|Great Eastern]] station and the adjacent [[Broad Street railway station (London)|Broad Street]] station by escalators. The Central London Railway was absorbed into the [[Underground Group]] on 1 January 1913.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|pp=58\u201359}}\n\nIn 1911, the [[Great Western Railway]] won permission for a line from [[Ealing Broadway station|Ealing Broadway]] to a station near to the CLR's [[Shepherd's Bush tube station|Shepherd's Bush]] station, with a connection to the [[West London Railway]], and agreement to connect the line to the Central London Railway and for the CLR to run trains to Ealing Broadway. Construction of the extension from the CLR to Ealing Broadway started in 1912{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=119}} but opening was delayed by [[World War I]]. The CLR purchased new rolling stock for the extension, which arrived in 1915 and was stored before being lent to the [[Bakerloo line]]. The rolling stock returned when the extension opened in 1920.{{sfn|Bruce|1988|pp=31\u201333}}\n\nIn 1912, plans were published for a railway from [[Shepherd's Bush tube station|Shepherd's Bush]] to [[Turnham Green tube station|Turnham Green]] and [[Gunnersbury station|Gunnersbury]],<ref name=gazette_1>{{London Gazette|issue=28666|date=26 November 1912|pages=9018\u20139021}}</ref> allowing the Central London Railway to run trains on [[London and South Western Railway]] (L&SWR) tracks to [[Richmond station (London)|Richmond]].

To the east new tunnels would run to just beyond [[Stratford station|Stratford]] station, where the line would be extended over the [[London & North Eastern Railway]] suburban branch to [[Epping tube station|Epping]] and [[Ongar railway station|Ongar]] in Essex, as well as a new underground line between [[Leytonstone tube station|Leytonstone]] and [[Newbury Park tube station|Newbury Park]] mostly under [[A12 road (England)|Eastern Avenue]] so as to serve the new suburbs of north Ilford and the [[Hainault Loop]].{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=116}} Platforms at central London stations were to be lengthened to allow 8-car trains.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=116}}\n\nConstruction started, the tunnels through central London being expanded and realigned and the stations lengthened, but it proved impossible to modify [[Wood Lane station]] to take 8-car trains and a new station at [[White City tube station|White City]] was authorised in 1938.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=124}} The line was converted to the London Underground four-rail electrification system in 1940.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=134}} The positive outer rail is {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} higher than on other lines, because even after reconstruction work the tunnels are slightly smaller.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Most of the tunnels for the extensions to the east of London had been built by 1940, but work slowed due to the outbreak of the Second World War until eventually suspended in June.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=134}} The unused tunnels between Leytonstone and Newbury Park were equipped by the [[Plessey]] Company as an aircraft components factory, opening in March 1942 and employing 2,000 people.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=142}} Elsewhere, people used underground stations as night shelters during air raids.
