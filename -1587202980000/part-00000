The translators were Hungarian Calvinist priests from [[Transylvania]]. The first complete translation to [[Romanian language|Romanian]] was made in 1688 (called \"[[Biblia de la Bucure\u015fti]]\"). The Old Testament was translated by Moldavian-born [[Nicolae Milescu]] in Constantinople. The translator used as his source a [[Septuagint]] published in Frankfurt in 1597. The manuscript was afterwards revised in Moldova and later brought to Bucharest, where it was again subject to revision by a team of Wallachian scholars (among whom were Radu and \u015eerban Greceanu) with the help of [[\u015eerban Cantacuzino]] and [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu]].\n\nBefore the publication of the Bucharest Bible, other partial translations were published, such as the Slavic-Romanian Gospel (1551), [[Coresi]]'s Gospel (1561), The Bra\u015fov Psalm Book (1570), Palia from Or\u0103\u015ftie (1582), The New Testament of Alba Iulia (1648) and others.

The [[Protestant]] denominations mainly use the Bible Society translation translated by [[Dumitru Cornilescu]].  The New Testament was first published in 1921, and the whole Bible with references in 1924, produced by the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]]. In 1989 appeared an unofficial revision by German publishing house Gute Botschaft Verlag (GBV); it tried to get the existing translation closer to the original manuscripts, in a form grammatically corrected and adapted according to the evolution of the modern Romanian language.\n\nThe British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS), operating in Romania through the Interconfessional Bible Society of Romania ([http://societateabiblica.org/ SBIR]), brought out a special 90th anniversary definitive edition of the Cornilescu Bible in 2014, with many errors corrected.\n\n*[[Petru Pavel Aron]]\n*[[Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu]] - into [[Romanian language|Romanian]]\n*[[Dumitru Cornilescu]] - Protestant, translated into Romanian\n*[[Gala Galaction]] - Romanian Orthodox, translated into Romanian\n*[[Radu and \u015eerban Greceanu]] - translated into Romanian\n\n== Comparison ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  style=\"text-align:center; width:25%;\"|Translation\n![[Gospel of John|John]] (Ioan) 3:16\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|''Cornilescu'' (1924)\n|Fiindc\u0103 at\u00eet de mult a iubit Dumnezeu lumea, c\u0103 a dat pe singurul Lui Fiu, pentruca oricine crede \u00een El, s\u0103 nu piar\u0103, ci s\u0103 aib\u0103 via\u0163\u0103 vecinic\u0103.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|''Cornilescu'' (2014)<ref>Revised edition.</ref>\n|Fiindc\u0103 at\u00e2t de mult a iubit Dumnezeu lumea, c\u0103 a dat pe singurul Lui Fiu, pentru ca oricine crede \u00een El s\u0103 nu piar\u0103, ci s\u0103 aib\u0103 via\u0163a ve\u015fnic\u0103.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|''Biblia GBV'' (1989)\n|Fiindc\u0103 at\u00eet de mult a iubit Dumnezeu lumea, c\u0103 a dat pe singurul S\u0103u Fiu, pentru ca oricine crede \u00een El s\u0103 nu piar\u0103, ci s\u0103 aib\u0103 via\u0163\u0103 ve\u015fnic\u0103.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|''Biblia Sinodal\u0103'' [http://www.bibliaortodoxa.ro/ Biblia Ortodox\u0103 Online]\n|C\u0103ci Dumnezeu a\u015fa a iubit lumea, \u00eenc\u00e2t pe Fiul S\u0103u Cel Unul-N\u0103scut L-a dat ca oricine crede \u00een El s\u0103 nu piar\u0103, ci s\u0103 aib\u0103 via\u0163\u0103 ve\u015fnic\u0103.\n|}\n\n== False friends ==\n\nThe Orthodox Bibles in the Romanian language, including the Cornilescu translation, which was initially intended and published as if it were an Orthodox translation<ref name=\"Vaisamar 2009\">{{cite web | first=Emanuel | last=Con\u021bac | title=Neadev\u0103ruri nerevizuite \u00een \u201eCornilescu\u201d (2003) revizuit | website=Vaisamar | date=6 May 2009 | url=http://vaisamar.wordpress.com/2009/05/06/neadevaruri-nerevizuite-in-cornilescu-2003-revizuit/ | language=ro | access-date=1 March 2020}}</ref>, use the term \"Malachians\"<ref name=\"Nicodim2016\">{{cite book|author=Aghioritul Sf\u00e2ntul Nicodim|title=Carte foarte folositoare de suflet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XkSTDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT99|date=14 June 2016|publisher=Elefant Online|isbn=978-606-8622-22-4|page=99}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Alexandru|last=Moisiu|publisher=University of California|title=Cartea regulei pastorale : cartea grijii pastorale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x64wAAAAIAAJ|year=1987|page=173}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first=Ioan Irineu|last=F\u0103rca\u0219|title=El, \"S-a de\u0219ertat pe Sine\" (FIL. 2,7). kenosa, centrul, sensul \u0219i \u021binta teologiei.|volume=46|issue=2|journal=Studia Universitatis Babe\u0219-Bolyai: Theologia Graeco-Catholica Varadiensis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l6dAAQAAIAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Universitatea Babe\u0219-Bolyai|page=56}}</ref> or \"Malacians\" (ie \"those who masturbate\") for those who will not inherit the kingdom of heaven (1 Cor. 6: 9).<ref name=\"Vaisamar 2008\"/> According to Emanuel Con\u021bac and Chrys C.
