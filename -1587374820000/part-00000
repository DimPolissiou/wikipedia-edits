The show spawned a number of aerobics and workout [[videotapes]].\n\nWhen MTV moved to its current location at 1515 [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], they lost the studio where ''Club MTV'' and ''The Grind'' were originally taped and episodes were taped on the roof of the building. The new space was small and inclement weather prevented taping. Noise ordinances prevented playing loud music while taping outdoors, so the show had to be taped without music and dubbed in later. Other installments went to [[Zuma Beach]] in [[California]], [[Brooklyn]], [[Miami]] and [[Hawaii]].\n\nNies was replaced in 1995 by various guest hosts. Until the show was cancelled in the summer of 1998, it was re-branded with a sleeker look as ''The Daily Burn'' and was taped on the Jersey Shore. [[Michael Bergin]] and [[Tsianina Joelson]] co-hosted with [[DJ Skribble]] as the [[DJ]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[MTV Grind 1]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0288362|The Grind}}\n* {{tv.com show|the-grind|The Grind}}\n{{MTV Albums}}\n{{Music based programs on MTV}}\n{{MTVNetwork Shows}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Grind (TV series), The}}\n[[Category:1992 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1997 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:MTV original programming]]\n[[Category:Dance television shows]]\n[[Category:1990s American music television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n", "name_user": "Certes", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Improve wikilinks, replaced:dancemusic \u2192dance music", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grind_(TV_series)"}
