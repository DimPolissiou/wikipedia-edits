Haag has been involved in several lead roles in anime series from ADV films, including ten-year-old teacher Rebecca Miyamoto in ''[[Pani Poni Dash]]'', [[Nene Romanova]] in ''[[Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040]]'', Teletha Testarossa in the ''[[Full Metal Panic!|Full Metal Panic series]]'', and Chloe in ''[[Noir (anime)|Noir]]''. \n\nShe attended [[Lamar Consolidated High School]] and later studied English Rhetoric at [[Texas A&M University]]. Haag resided in Los Angeles for almost 2 years after she graduated from Texas A&M University, but moved back to Houston where she grew up. Because of her distinctive natural child like voice, she is often given the roles of younger female characters.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Anime===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ List of dubbing performances in anime\n|-\n! href=\"Lamar Consolidated High School\" |Year\n! href=\"Texas A&M University\" |Title\n!Role\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Notes\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Source\n|-\n|1996\n|''[[Martian Successor Nadesico]]''\n| href=\"Martian Successor Nadesico\" |Yukina Shiratori\n|\n|<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=42|title=Martian Successor Nadesico (TV) - Anime News Network|website=www.animenewsnetwork.com|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref>\n|-\n|1999\n|[[Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040|''Bubblegum Crisis: Tokyo 2040'']]\n| href=\"Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040\" |Nene Romanova\n|\n|<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/bubblegum-crisis-tokyo-2040/dvd-complete-collection-classic-line|title=Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040 DVD|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en}}</ref>\n|-\n|2001\n|''[[Princess Nine]]''\n|Ryo Hayakawa\n|\n|<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/princess-nine/dvd-1|title=Princess Nine DVD 1|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en}}</ref>\n|-\n|2002\n|''[[Chance Pop Session]]'' \n|Yuki Aoyama\n|\n|<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2003-02-07/sakura-con-announces-new-guests|title=Sakura-Con Announces New Guests|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en}}</ref>\n|-\n|2002\n|''[[Steel Angel Kurumi]]''\n|Karinka\n|also season 2\n|<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-03-11/steel-angel-kurumi-release-details|title=Steel Angel Kurumi Release Details|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en}}</ref>\n|-\n|2003\n|''[[Full Metal Panic!|Full Metal Panic]]'' series\n|Teletha Testarossa\n|also season 2, OVAs, ''[[Full Metal Panic?

{"title_page": "Quantifier (logic)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Quantifier (disambiguation)}}\nIn [[natural language]]s, a quantifier turns a sentence about something having some property into a sentence about the number (quantity) of things having the property. Examples of quantifiers in English are \"all\", \"some\", \"many\", \"few\", \"most\", and \"no\";<ref>See [[Quantifier (linguistics)]] for details.</ref> examples of quantified sentences are \"all people are mortal\", \"some people are mortal\", and \"no people are mortal\", they are considered to be true, true, and false, respectively.\n\nIn [[mathematical logic]], in particular in [[first-order logic]], a '''quantifier''' achieves a similar task, operating on a [[mathematical formula]] rather than an English sentence.\n\nMore precisely, a quantifier specifies the quantity of specimens in the [[domain of discourse]] that satisfy an [[open formula]]. The two most common formal quantifiers are \"[[Universal quantification|for each]]\" (traditionally symbolized by [[turned A|\"\u2200\"]]), and \"[[Existential quantification|there exists some]]\" ([[turned E|\"\u2203\"]]).{{#tag:ref|They correspond to the English quantifiers \"all\", and \"some\", respectively. Neither \"many\" nor \"few\" can be formalized, due to their vague meaning. \"Most\" is difficult to formalize when speaking about [[infinite set]]s. \"No\" can be expressed as the opposite of \"some\". The latter could be expressed, in turn, using \"all\", but this is rarely done.<ref>For an exception, see e.g. {{cite book | issn=1431-4657 | isbn=3540058192 | author=Hans Hermes | title=Introduction to Mathematical Logic | location=London | publisher=Springer | series=Hochschultext (Springer-Verlag) | volume= | year=1973 }} Here: Remark II.1.5</ref>}} For example, in arithmetic, quantifiers allow one to say that the [[natural number]]s go on forever, by writing that \"for each natural number ''n'', there exists some natural number ''m'' that is bigger than ''n''\"; this can be written formally as \"\u2200''n''\u2208\u2115. \u2203''m''\u2208\u2115. ''m''>''n''\".<ref>This formula can be proven true, since, given an arbitrary ''n'', choosing ''m'' e.g. as the [[successor function|successor]] of ''n'' will do.</ref> The above English examples could be formalized as \"\u2200''p''\u2208''P''. ''m''(''p'')\",<ref>Literally: \"For each member ''p'' of the set of all people, ''p'' is mortal.\"</ref> \"\u2203''p''\u2208''P''. ''m''(''p'')\", and \"[[negation (logic)|\u00ac]] \u2203''p''\u2208''P''. ''m''(''p'')\",<ref>Literally: \"It is [[negation (logic)|not]] true that there exists some member ''p'' of the set of all people such that ''p'' is mortal.\"</ref> respectively, when ''P'' denotes the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all people, and ''m''(''p'') denotes \"''p'' is mortal\".\n\nA formula beginning with a quantifier is called a '''quantified''' formula. A formal quantifier requires a variable, which is said to be ''[[Free variables and bound variables|bound]]'' by it, and a subformula specifying a property of that variable.<!---to do: elaborate on role of variable (missing in natural language) to achieve formal precision; example: \"all natural numbers are even or odd\" vs \"\u2200n\u2208\u2115. (even(n) \u2228 odd(n))\" vs \"(\u2200n\u2208\u2115. even(n)) \u2228 (\u2200n\u2208\u2115. odd(n))\"--->\n\nFormal quantifiers have been generalized beginning with the work of [[Andrzej Mostowski|Mostowski]] and [[Per Lindstr\u00f6m|Lindstr\u00f6m]].\n\n==Relations to logical conjunction and disjunction==\nFor a finite domain of discourse D = {a<sub>1</sub>,...a<sub>n</sub>} the universal quantifier is equivalent to a [[logical conjunction]] of propositions with singular terms a<sub>i</sub> having the form Pa<sub>i</sub> for [[monadic predicate calculus|monadic predicates]].\n\nThe existential quantifier is equivalent to a [[logical disjunction]] of propositions having the same structure as before. For infinite domains of discourse the equivalences are similar.\n\n===Infinite domain of discourse===\n\nConsider the following statement:\n: 1 \u00b7 2 = 1 + 1, and 2 \u00b7 2 = 2 + 2, and 3 \u00b7 2 = 3 + 3, ..., and 100 \u00b7 2 = 100 + 100, and ..., etc.\nThis has the appearance of an ''infinite [[logical conjunction|conjunction]]'' of propositions.  From the point of view of [[formal language]]s this is immediately a problem, since [[Syntax (logic)|syntax]] rules are expected to generate [[finite set|finite]] words.\n\nThe example above is fortunate in that there is a [[Algorithm|procedure]] to generate all the conjuncts.  However, if an assertion were to be made about every [[irrational number]], there would be no way to enumerate all the conjuncts, since irrationals cannot be enumerated. A succinct equivalent formulation which avoids these problems uses ''universal quantification'':\n: For each [[natural number]] ''n'', ''n'' \u00b7 2 = ''n'' + ''n''.\nA similar analysis applies to the [[disjunction (logic)|disjunction]],\n: 1 is equal to 5 + 5, or 2 is equal to 5 + 5, or 3 is equal to 5 + 5, ... , or 100 is equal to 5 + 5, or ..., etc.\nwhich can be rephrased using ''existential quantification'':\n: For some [[natural number]] ''n'', ''n'' is equal to 5+5.\n\n==Algebraic approaches to quantification==\nIt is possible to devise [[abstract algebra]]s whose [[model theory|models]] include [[formal language]]s with quantification, but progress has been slow{{clarify|date=October 2016}} and interest in such algebra has been limited. Three approaches have been devised to date:\n* [[Relation algebra]], invented by [[Augustus De Morgan]], and developed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Ernst Schr\u00f6der]], [[Alfred Tarski]], and Tarski's students. Relation algebra cannot represent any formula with quantifiers nested more than three deep. Surprisingly, the models of relation algebra include the [[axiomatic set theory]] [[ZFC]] and [[Peano arithmetic]];\n* [[Cylindric algebra]], devised by [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Leon Henkin]], and others;\n* The [[polyadic algebra]] of [[Paul Halmos]].\n\n==Notation==\nThe two most common quantifiers are the universal quantifier and the existential quantifier. The traditional symbol for the universal quantifier is \"[[\u2200]]\", a rotated letter \"[[A]]\", which stands for  \"for all\" or \"all\".  The corresponding symbol for the existential quantifier is \"[[\u2203]]\", a rotated letter \"[[E]]\", which stands for \"there exists\" or \"exists\".\n\nAn example of translating a quantified statement in a natural language such as English would be as follows. Given the statement, \"Each of Peter's friends either likes to dance or likes to go to the beach (or both)\", key aspects can be identified and rewritten using symbols including quantifiers. So, let ''X'' be the set of all Peter's friends, ''P''(''x'') the [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] \"''x'' likes to dance\", and ''Q''(''x'') the predicate \"''x'' likes to go to the beach\". Then the above sentence can be written in formal notation as <math> \\forall{x}{\\in}X, P(x) \\lor Q(x) </math>, which is read, \"for every ''x'' that is a member of ''X'', ''P'' applies to ''x'' [[inclusive or|or]] ''Q'' applies to ''x''\".\n\nSome other quantified expressions are constructed as follows, \n: <math> \\exists{x}\\, P  \\qquad \\forall{x}\\, P </math>\nfor a formula ''P''. These two expressions (using the definitions above) are read as \"there exists a friend of Peter who likes to dance\" and \"all friends of Peter like to dance\" respectively.\nVariant notations include, for set ''X'' and set members ''x'':\n: <math> \\bigvee_{x} P \\qquad (\\exists{x}) P \\qquad (\\exists x \\ . \\ P) \\qquad \\exists x \\ \\cdot \\ P \\qquad (\\exists x : P) \\qquad \\exists{x}(P) \\qquad \\exists_{x}\\, P \\qquad \\exists{x}{,}\\, P \\qquad \\exists{x}{\\in}X \\, P \\qquad \\exists\\, x{:}X \\, P</math>\nAll of these variations also apply to universal quantification.\nOther variations for the universal quantifier are\n: <math>\\bigwedge_{x} P \\qquad (x) \\, P</math>\n\nSome versions of the notation explicitly mention the range of quantification.  The range of quantification must always be specified; for a given mathematical theory, this can be done in several ways:\n* Assume a fixed domain of discourse for every quantification, as is done in [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]],\n* Fix several domains of discourse in advance and require that each variable have a declared domain, which is the ''type'' of that variable. This is analogous to the situation in [[Type system|statically typed]] [[computer programming]] languages, where variables have declared types.\n* Mention explicitly the range of quantification, perhaps using a symbol for the set of all objects in that domain or the [[type (type theory)|type]] of the objects in that domain.\n\nOne can use any variable as a quantified variable in place of any other, under certain restrictions in which ''variable capture'' does not occur.  Even if the notation uses typed variables, variables of that type may be used.\n\nInformally or in natural language, the \"\u2200''x''\" or \"\u2203''x''\" might appear after or in the middle of ''P''(''x''). Formally, however, the phrase that introduces the dummy variable is placed in front.\n\nMathematical formulas mix symbolic expressions for quantifiers with natural language quantifiers such as,\n: For every natural number ''x'', ...\n: There exists an ''x'' such that ...\n: For at least one ''x, ....''\n\nKeywords for [[uniqueness quantification]] include:\n: For exactly one natural number ''x'', ...\n: There is one and only one ''x'' such that ....\nFurther, ''x'' may be replaced by a [[pronoun]]. For example, \n:For every natural number, its product with 2 equals to its sum with itself.\n:Some natural number is prime.\n\n==Order of quantifiers (nesting)==\nThe order of quantifiers is critical to meaning, as is illustrated by the following two propositions:\n:For every natural number ''n'', there exists a natural number ''s'' such that ''s'' = ''n''<sup>2</sup>.\nThis is clearly true; it just asserts that every natural number has a square. The meaning of the assertion in which the order of quantifiers is inversed is different:\n:There exists a natural number ''s'' such that for every natural number ''n'', ''s'' = ''n''<sup>2</sup>.\nThis is clearly false; it asserts that there is a single natural number ''s'' that is at the same time the square of ''every'' natural number. This is because the syntax directs that any<!---\"newly\" misleadingly indicates they the variable is introduced as the last one:---newly introduced---> variable cannot be a function of subsequently introduced variables.\n\nA less trivial example from [[mathematical analysis]] are the concepts of [[uniform continuity|uniform]] and [[continuous function|pointwise]] continuity, whose definitions differ only by an exchange in the positions of two quantifiers.\nA function ''f'' from [[real numbers|'''R''']] to '''R''' is called\n* pointwise continuous if <math display=\"inline\">\\forall \\varepsilon > 0 \\; \\forall x \\in \\R \\; \\exists \\delta > 0 \\; \\forall h \\in \\R \\; (|h| < \\delta \\, \\Rightarrow \\, |f(x) - f(x + h)| < \\varepsilon ) </math>\n* uniformly continuous if <math display=\"inline\">\\forall \\varepsilon > 0 \\; \\exists \\delta > 0 \\; \\forall x \\in \\R \\; \\forall h \\in \\R \\; (|h| < \\delta \\, \\Rightarrow \\, |f(x) - f(x + h)| < \\varepsilon ) </math>\nIn the former case, the particular value chosen for ''\u03b4'' can be a function of both ''\u03b5'' and ''x'', the variables that precede it.\nIn the latter case, ''\u03b4'' can be a function only of ''\u03b5'', i.e. it has to be chosen independent of ''x''.\nFor example, ''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>2</sup> satisfies pointwise, but not uniform continuity.\nIn contrast, interchanging the two initial universal quantifiers in the definition of pointwise continuity does not change the meaning.\n\nThe maximum depth of nesting of quantifiers in a formula is called its '''[[quantifier rank]]'''.\n\n==Equivalent expressions==\nIf ''D'' is a domain of ''x'' and ''P''(''x'') is a predicate dependent on object variable ''x'', then the universal proposition can be expressed as\n\n:<math>\\forall x\\!\\in\\!D\\; P(x).</math>\n\nThis notation is known as restricted or relativized or [[Bounded quantifier|bounded quantification]]. Equivalently one can write,\n\n:<math>\\forall x\\;(x\\!\\in\\!D \\to P(x)).</math>\n\nThe existential proposition can be expressed with bounded quantification as\n\n:<math>\\exists x\\!\\in\\!D\\; P(x),</math>\n\nor equivalently\n\n:<math>\\exists x\\;(x\\!\\in\\!\\!D \\land P(x)).</math>\n\nTogether with negation, only one of either the universal or existential quantifier is needed to perform both tasks:\n\n:<math>\\neg (\\forall x\\!\\in\\!D\\; P(x)) \\equiv \\exists x\\!\\in\\!D\\; \\neg P(x),</math>\n\nwhich shows that to disprove a \"for all ''x''\" proposition, one needs no more than to find an ''x'' for which the predicate is false. Similarly,\n\n:<math>\\neg (\\exists x\\!\\in\\!D\\; P(x)) \\equiv \\forall x\\!\\in\\!D\\; \\neg P(x),</math>\n\nto disprove a \"there exists an ''x''\" proposition, one needs to show that the predicate is false for all ''x''.\n\n==Range of quantification==\nEvery quantification involves one specific variable and a ''domain of discourse'' or ''range of quantification'' of that variable.  The range of quantification specifies the set of values that the variable takes.  In the examples above, the range of quantification is the set of natural numbers.  Specification of the range of quantification allows us to express the difference between, asserting that a predicate holds for some natural number or for some [[real number]]. Expository conventions often reserve some variable names such as \"''n''\" for natural numbers and \"''x''\" for real numbers, although relying exclusively on naming conventions cannot work in general since ranges of variables can change in the course of a mathematical argument.\n\nA more natural way to restrict the domain of discourse uses ''guarded quantification''.  For example, the guarded quantification \n:For some natural number ''n'', ''n'' is even and ''n'' is prime\nmeans\n:For some [[even number]] ''n'', ''n'' is prime.\n\nIn some mathematical theories a single domain of\ndiscourse fixed in advance is assumed.  For example, in [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]], variables range over all sets.  In this case, guarded quantifiers can be used to mimic a smaller range of quantification.  Thus in the example\nabove to express\n:For every natural number ''n'', ''n''\u00b72 = ''n'' + ''n''\nin Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory, it can be said\n:For every ''n'', if ''n'' belongs to '''N''', then ''n''\u00b72 = ''n'' + ''n'',\nwhere '''N''' is the set of all natural numbers.\n\n==Formal semantics==\nMathematical semantics is the application of [[mathematics]] to study the meaning of expressions in a formal language. It has three elements: a mathematical specification of a class of objects via [[syntax (logic)|syntax]], a mathematical specification of various semantic domains and the relation between the two, which is usually expressed as a function from syntactic objects to semantic ones.  This article only addresses the issue of how quantifier elements are interpreted.\nThe syntax of a formula can be given by a syntax tree. A quantifier has a [[scope (logic)|scope]], and an occurrence of a variable ''x'' is [[free variable|free]] if it is not within the scope of a quantification for that variable. Thus in\n:<math> \\forall x (\\exists y  B(x,y)) \\vee C(y,x) </math>\nthe occurrence of both ''x'' and ''y'' in ''C''(''y'', ''x'') is free, while the occurrence of ''x'' and ''y'' in ''B''(''y'', ''x'') is bound (i.e. non-free).\n\n[[File:QuantifierScopes svg.svg|thumb|350px|Syntax tree of the formula <math> \\forall x (\\exists y  B(x,y)) \\vee C(y,x) </math>, illustrating scope and variable capture. Bound and free variable occurrences are colored in red and green, respectively.]]\nAn [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] for [[first-order predicate calculus]] assumes as given a domain of individuals ''X''.  A formula ''A'' whose free variables are ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>n</sub> is interpreted as a [[Boolean function|boolean]]-valued function ''F''(''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>) of ''n'' arguments, where each argument ranges over the domain ''X''.  Boolean-valued means that the function assumes one of the values '''T''' (interpreted as truth) or '''F''' (interpreted as falsehood). The interpretation of the formula\n:<math> \\forall x_n A(x_1, \\ldots , x_n) </math>\nis the function ''G'' of ''n''-1 arguments such that ''G''(''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''-1</sub>) = '''T''' if and only if ''F''(''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''-1</sub>, ''w'') = '''T''' for every ''w'' in ''X''. If  ''F''(''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''-1</sub>, ''w'') = '''F''' for at least one value of ''w'', then ''G''(''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''-1</sub>) = '''F'''. Similarly the interpretation of the formula\n:<math> \\exists x_n A(x_1, \\ldots , x_n) </math>\nis the function ''H'' of ''n''-1 arguments such that ''H''(''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''-1</sub>) = '''T''' if and only if ''F''(''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''-1</sub>, ''w'') = '''T''' for at least one ''w'' and  ''H''(''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''-1</sub>) = '''F''' otherwise.\n\nThe semantics for [[uniqueness quantification]] requires first-order predicate calculus with equality. This means there is given a distinguished two-placed predicate \"=\"; the semantics is also modified accordingly so that \"=\" is always interpreted as the two-place equality relation on ''X''. The interpretation of  \n:<math> \\exists !   x_n A(x_1, \\ldots , x_n) </math>\nthen is the function of ''n''-1 arguments, which is the logical ''and'' of the interpretations of \n:<math> \\exists  x_n A(x_1, \\ldots , x_n) </math>\n:<math> \\forall y,z \\left\\{  A(x_1, \\ldots ,x_{n-1}, y) \\wedge  A(x_1, \\ldots ,x_{n-1}, z) \\implies y = z \\right\\}.</math>\n\nEach kind of quantification defines a corresponding [[closure operator]] on the set of formulas, by adding, for each free variable ''x'', a quantifier to bind ''x''.<ref>in general, for a quantifer '''Q''', closure makes sense only if the order of '''Q''' quantification does not matter, i.e. if '''Q'''<!------>''x'' '''Q'''<!------>''y'' ''p''(''x'',''y'') is equivalent to '''Q'''<!------>''y'' '''Q'''<!------>''x'' ''p''(''x'',''y''). This is satisfied for '''Q''' \u2208 {\u2200,\u2203}, cf. [[#Order of quantifiers (nesting)]] above.</ref> For example, the ''existential closure'' of the [[open formula]] ''n''>2 \u2227 ''x''<sup>''n''</sup>+''y''<sup>''n''</sup>=''z''<sup>''n''</sup> is the closed formula \u2203''n'' \u2203''x'' \u2203''y'' \u2203''z'' (''n''>2 \u2227 ''x''<sup>''n''</sup>+''y''<sup>''n''</sup>=''z''<sup>''n''</sup>); the latter formula, when interpreted over the natural numbers, is known to be false by [[Fermat's last theorem]]. As another example, equational axioms, like ''x''+''y''=''y''+''x'', are usually meant to denote their ''univeral closure'', like \u2200''x'' \u2200''y'' (''x''+''y''=''y''+''x'') to express [[commutativity]].\n\n==Paucal, multal and other degree quantifiers==\n{{See also|Fubini's theorem|measurable}}\n\nNone of the quantifiers previously discussed apply to a quantification such as\n\n:There are many integers ''n'' < 100, such that ''n'' is divisible by 2 or 3 or 5.\n\nOne possible interpretation mechanism can be obtained as follows: Suppose that in addition to a semantic domain ''X'', we have given a [[probability measure]] P defined on ''X'' and cutoff numbers 0 < ''a'' \u2264 ''b'' \u2264  1.  If ''A'' is a formula with free variables ''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>''n''</sub> whose interpretation is\nthe function ''F'' of variables ''v''<sub>1</sub>,...,''v''<sub>''n''</sub>\nthen the interpretation of \n:<math> \\exists^{\\mathrm{many}} x_n A(x_1, \\ldots, x_{n-1}, x_n) </math>\nis the function of ''v''<sub>1</sub>,...,''v''<sub>''n''-1</sub> which is '''T''' if and only if\n:<math> \\operatorname{P} \\{w: F(v_1, \\ldots, v_{n-1}, w) = \\mathbf{T} \\} \\geq b </math>\nand '''F''' otherwise.  Similarly, the interpretation of \n:<math> \\exists^{\\mathrm{few}}  x_n  A(x_1, \\ldots, x_{n-1}, x_n) </math>\nis the function of ''v''<sub>1</sub>,...,''v''<sub>''n''-1</sub> which is '''F''' if and only if\n:<math> 0< \\operatorname{P} \\{w: F(v_1, \\ldots, v_{n-1}, w) = \\mathbf{T}\\} \\leq a </math>\nand '''T''' otherwise.\n{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n==Other quantifiers==\nA few other quantifiers have been proposed over time.

Term logic treated ''All'', ''Some''  and ''No'' in the 4th century BC, in an account also touching on the [[alethic modalities]].\n\nIn 1827, [[George Bentham]] published his ''Outline of a new system of logic, with a critical examination of Dr Whately's Elements of Logic'', describing the principle of the quantifier, but the book was not widely circulated.<ref>George Bentham, ''Outline of a new system of logic: with a critical examination of Dr. Whately's Elements of Logic'' (1827); Thoemmes; Facsimile edition (1990)  {{isbn|1-85506-029-9}}</ref>\n\n[[File:De Morgan Augustus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Augustus De Morgan]] (1806-1871) was the first to use \"quantifier\" in the modern way.]]\n[[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]] claimed to have coined the terms \"quantify\" and \"quantification\", most likely in his Edinburgh lectures c. 1840.

He would universally quantify a variable (or relation) by writing the variable over a dimple in an otherwise straight line appearing in his diagrammatic formulas. Frege did not devise an explicit notation for existential quantification, instead employing his equivalent of ~\u2200''x''~, or [[contraposition]]. Frege's treatment of quantification went largely unremarked until [[Bertrand Russell]]'s 1903 ''Principles of Mathematics''.\n\nIn work that culminated in Peirce (1885), [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and his student [[Oscar Howard Mitchell]] independently invented universal and existential quantifiers, and [[bound variable]]s. Peirce and Mitchell wrote \u03a0<sub>x</sub> and \u03a3<sub>x</sub> where we now write \u2200''x'' and \u2203''x''. Peirce's notation can be found in the writings of [[Ernst Schr\u00f6der]], [[Leopold Loewenheim]], [[Thoralf Skolem]], and Polish logicians into the 1950s. Most notably, it is the notation of [[Kurt G\u00f6del]]'s landmark 1930 paper on the [[G\u00f6del's completeness theorem|completeness]] of [[first-order logic]], and 1931 paper on the [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem|incompleteness]] of [[Peano arithmetic]].\n\nPeirce's approach to quantification also influenced [[William Ernest Johnson]] and [[Giuseppe Peano]], who invented yet another notation, namely (''x'') for the universal quantification of ''x'' and (in 1897) \u2203''x'' for the existential quantification of ''x''. Hence for decades, the canonical notation in philosophy and mathematical logic was (''x'')''P'' to express \"all individuals in the domain of discourse have the property ''P'',\" and \"(\u2203''x'')''P''\" for \"there exists at least one individual in the domain of discourse having the property ''P''.\" Peano, who was much better known than Peirce, in effect diffused the latter's thinking throughout Europe. Peano's notation was adopted by the ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' of [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], and [[Alonzo Church]]. In 1935, [[Gentzen]] introduced the \u2200 symbol, by analogy with Peano's \u2203 symbol. \u2200 did not become canonical until the 1960s.\n\nAround 1895, Peirce began developing his [[existential graph]]s, whose variables can be seen as tacitly quantified. Whether the shallowest instance of a variable is even or odd determines whether that variable's quantification is universal or existential. (Shallowness is the contrary of depth, which is determined by the nesting of negations.) Peirce's graphical logic has attracted some attention in recent years by those researching [[heterogeneous reasoning]] and [[logical graph|diagrammatic inference]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n*[[Generalized quantifier]] &mdash; a higher-order property used as standard semantics of quantified [[noun phrases]]\n*[[Lindstr\u00f6m quantifier]] &mdash; a generalized polyadic quantifier\n*[[Quantifier elimination]]\n*[[Almost all]]\n*[[Eventually (mathematics)]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n* [[Jon Barwise|Barwise, Jon]]; and [[John Etchemendy|Etchemendy, John]], 2000.

Examples of quantifiers in English are \"all\", \"some\", \"many\", \"few\", \"most\", and \"no\";<ref>See [[Quantifier (linguistics)]] for details.</ref> examples of quantified sentences are \"all people are mortal\", \"some people are mortal\", and \"no people are mortal\", they are considered to be true, true, and false, respectively.\n\nIn [[mathematical logic]], in particular in [[first-order logic]], a '''quantifier''' achieves a similar task, operating on a [[mathematical formula]] rather than an English sentence.\n\nMore precisely, a quantifier specifies the quantity of specimens in the [[domain of discourse]] that satisfy an [[open formula]]. The two most common formal quantifiers are \"[[Universal quantification|for each]]\" (traditionally symbolized by [[turned A|\"\u2200\"]]), and \"[[Existential quantification|there exists some]]\" ([[turned E|\"\u2203\"]]).{{#tag:ref|They correspond to the English quantifiers \"all\", and \"some\", respectively. Neither \"many\" nor \"few\" can be formalized, due to their vague meaning. \"Most\" is difficult to formalize when speaking about [[infinite set]]s. \"No\" can be expressed as the opposite of \"some\". The latter could be expressed, in turn, using \"all\", but this is rarely done.<ref>For an exception, see e.g. {{cite book | issn=1431-4657 | isbn=3540058192 | author=Hans Hermes | title=Introduction to Mathematical Logic | location=London | publisher=Springer | series=Hochschultext (Springer-Verlag) | volume= | year=1973 }} Here: Remark II.1.5</ref>}} For example, in arithmetic, quantifiers allow one to say that the [[natural number]]s go on forever, by writing that \"for each natural number ''n'', there exists some natural number ''m'' that is bigger than ''n''\"; this can be written formally as \"\u2200''n''\u2208\u2115. \u2203''m''\u2208\u2115. ''m''>''n''\".<ref>This formula can be proven true, since, given an arbitrary ''n'', chosing ''m'' e.g. as the [[successor function|successor]] of ''n'' will do.</ref> The above English examples could be formalized as \"\u2200''p''\u2208''P''. ''m''(''p'')\",<ref>Literally: \"For each member ''p'' of the set of all people, ''p'' is mortal.\"</ref> \"\u2203''p''\u2208''P''. ''m''(''p'')\", and \"[[negation (logic)|\u00ac]] \u2203''p''\u2208''P''. ''m''(''p'')\",<ref>Literally: \"It is [[negation (logic)|not]] true that there exists some member ''p'' of the set of all people such that ''p'' is mortal.\"</ref> respectively, when ''P'' denotes the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all people, and ''m''(''p'') denotes \"''p'' is mortal\".\n\nA formula beginning with a quantifier is called a '''quantified''' formula. A formal quantifier requires a variable, which is said to be ''[[Free variables and bound variables|bound]]'' by it, and a subformula specifying a property of that variable.<!---to do: elaborate on role of variable (missing in natural language) to achieve formal precision; example: \"all natural numbers are even or odd\" vs \"\u2200n\u2208\u2115. (even(n) \u2228 odd(n))\" vs \"(\u2200n\u2208\u2115. even(n)) \u2228 (\u2200n\u2208\u2115. odd(n))\"--->\n\nFormal quantifiers have been generalized beginning with the work of [[Andrzej Mostowski|Mostowski]] and [[Per Lindstr\u00f6m|Lindstr\u00f6m]].\n\n==Relations to logical conjunction and disjunction==\nFor a finite domain of discourse D = {a<sub>1</sub>,...a<sub>n</sub>} the universal quantifier is equivalent to a [[logical conjunction]] of propositions with singular terms a<sub>i</sub> having the form Pa<sub>i</sub> for [[monadic predicate calculus|monadic predicates]].\n\nThe existential quantifier is equivalent to a [[logical disjunction]] of propositions having the same structure as before. For infinite domains of discourse the equivalences are similar.\n\n===Infinite domain of discourse===\n\nConsider the following statement:\n: 1 \u00b7 2 = 1 + 1, and 2 \u00b7 2 = 2 + 2, and 3 \u00b7 2 = 3 + 3, ..., and 100 \u00b7 2 = 100 + 100, and ..., etc.\nThis has the appearance of an ''infinite [[logical conjunction|conjunction]]'' of propositions.  From the point of view of [[formal language]]s this is immediately a problem, since [[Syntax (logic)|syntax]] rules are expected to generate [[finite set|finite]] words.\n\nThe example above is fortunate in that there is a [[Algorithm|procedure]] to generate all the conjuncts.  However, if an assertion were to be made about every [[irrational number]], there would be no way to enumerate all the conjuncts, since irrationals cannot be enumerated. A succinct equivalent formulation which avoids these problems uses ''universal quantification'':\n: For each [[natural number]] ''n'', ''n'' \u00b7 2 = ''n'' + ''n''.\nA similar analysis applies to the [[disjunction (logic)|disjunction]],\n: 1 is equal to 5 + 5, or 2 is equal to 5 + 5, or 3 is equal to 5 + 5, ... , or 100 is equal to 5 + 5, or ..., etc.\nwhich can be rephrased using ''existential quantification'':\n: For some [[natural number]] ''n'', ''n'' is equal to 5+5.\n\n==Algebraic approaches to quantification==\nIt is possible to devise [[abstract algebra]]s whose [[model theory|models]] include [[formal language]]s with quantification, but progress has been slow{{clarify|date=October 2016}} and interest in such algebra has been limited. Three approaches have been devised to date:\n* [[Relation algebra]], invented by [[Augustus De Morgan]], and developed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Ernst Schr\u00f6der]], [[Alfred Tarski]], and Tarski's students. Relation algebra cannot represent any formula with quantifiers nested more than three deep. Surprisingly, the models of relation algebra include the [[axiomatic set theory]] [[ZFC]] and [[Peano arithmetic]];\n* [[Cylindric algebra]], devised by [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Leon Henkin]], and others;\n* The [[polyadic algebra]] of [[Paul Halmos]].\n\n==Notation==\nThe two most common quantifiers are the universal quantifier and the existential quantifier. The traditional symbol for the universal quantifier is \"[[\u2200]]\", a rotated letter \"[[A]]\", which stands for  \"for all\" or \"all\".  The corresponding symbol for the existential quantifier is \"[[\u2203]]\", a rotated letter \"[[E]]\", which stands for \"there exists\" or \"exists\".\n\nAn example of translating a quantified statement in a natural language such as English would be as follows. Given the statement, \"Each of Peter's friends either likes to dance or likes to go to the beach (or both)\", key aspects can be identified and rewritten using symbols including quantifiers. So, let ''X'' be the set of all Peter's friends, ''P''(''x'') the [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] \"''x'' likes to dance\", and ''Q''(''x'') the predicate \"''x'' likes to go to the beach\". Then the above sentence can be written in formal notation as <math> \\forall{x}{\\in}X, P(x) \\lor Q(x) </math>, which is read, \"for every ''x'' that is a member of ''X'', ''P'' applies to ''x'' [[inclusive or|or]] ''Q'' applies to ''x''\".\n\nSome other quantified expressions are constructed as follows, \n: <math> \\exists{x}\\, P  \\qquad \\forall{x}\\, P </math>\nfor a formula ''P''. These two expressions (using the definitions above) are read as \"there exists a friend of Peter who likes to dance\" and \"all friends of Peter like to dance\" respectively.\nVariant notations include, for set ''X'' and set members ''x'':\n: <math> \\bigvee_{x} P \\qquad (\\exists{x}) P \\qquad (\\exists x \\ . \\ P) \\qquad \\exists x \\ \\cdot \\ P \\qquad (\\exists x : P) \\qquad \\exists{x}(P) \\qquad \\exists_{x}\\, P \\qquad \\exists{x}{,}\\, P \\qquad \\exists{x}{\\in}X \\, P \\qquad \\exists\\, x{:}X \\, P</math>\nAll of these variations also apply to universal quantification.\nOther variations for the universal quantifier are\n: <math>\\bigwedge_{x} P \\qquad (x) \\, P</math>\n\nSome versions of the notation explicitly mention the range of quantification.  The range of quantification must always be specified; for a given mathematical theory, this can be done in several ways:\n* Assume a fixed domain of discourse for every quantification, as is done in [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]],\n* Fix several domains of discourse in advance and require that each variable have a declared domain, which is the ''type'' of that variable. This is analogous to the situation in [[Type system|statically typed]] [[computer programming]] languages, where variables have declared types.\n* Mention explicitly the range of quantification, perhaps using a symbol for the set of all objects in that domain or the [[type (type theory)|type]] of the objects in that domain.\n\nOne can use any variable as a quantified variable in place of any other, under certain restrictions in which ''variable capture'' does not occur.  Even if the notation uses typed variables, variables of that type may be used.\n\nInformally or in natural language, the \"\u2200''x''\" or \"\u2203''x''\" might appear after or in the middle of ''P''(''x''). Formally, however, the phrase that introduces the dummy variable is placed in front.\n\nMathematical formulas mix symbolic expressions for quantifiers with natural language quantifiers such as,\n: For every natural number ''x'', ...\n: There exists an ''x'' such that ...\n: For at least one ''x, ....''\n\nKeywords for [[uniqueness quantification]] include:\n: For exactly one natural number ''x'', ...\n: There is one and only one ''x'' such that ....\nFurther, ''x'' may be replaced by a [[pronoun]]. For example, \n:For every natural number, its product with 2 equals to its sum with itself.\n:Some natural number is prime.\n\n==Order of quantifiers (nesting)==\nThe order of quantifiers is critical to meaning, as is illustrated by the following two propositions:\n:For every natural number ''n'', there exists a natural number ''s'' such that ''s'' = ''n''<sup>2</sup>.\nThis is clearly true; it just asserts that every natural number has a square. The meaning of the assertion in which the order of quantifiers is inversed is different:\n:There exists a natural number ''s'' such that for every natural number ''n'', ''s'' = ''n''<sup>2</sup>.\nThis is clearly false; it asserts that there is a single natural number ''s'' that is at the same time the square of ''every'' natural number. This is because the syntax directs that any<!---\"newly\" misleadingly indicates they the variable is introduced as the last one:---newly introduced---> variable cannot be a function of subsequently introduced variables.\n\nA less trivial example from [[mathematical analysis]] are the concepts of [[uniform continuity|uniform]] and [[continuous function|pointwise]] continuity, whose definitions differ only by an exchange in the positions of two quantifiers.\nA function ''f'' from [[real numbers|'''R''']] to '''R''' is called\n* pointwise continuous if <math display=\"inline\">\\forall \\varepsilon > 0 \\; \\forall x \\in \\R \\; \\exists \\delta > 0 \\; \\forall h \\in \\R \\; (|h| < \\delta \\, \\Rightarrow \\, |f(x) - f(x + h)| < \\varepsilon ) </math>\n* uniformly continuous if <math display=\"inline\">\\forall \\varepsilon > 0 \\; \\exists \\delta > 0 \\; \\forall x \\in \\R \\; \\forall h \\in \\R \\; (|h| < \\delta \\, \\Rightarrow \\, |f(x) - f(x + h)| < \\varepsilon ) </math>\nIn the former case, the particular value chosen for ''\u03b4'' can be a function of both ''\u03b5'' and ''x'', the variables that precede it.\nIn the latter case, ''\u03b4'' can be a function only of ''\u03b5'', i.e. it has to be chosen independent of ''x''.\nFor example, ''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>2</sup> satisfies pointwise, but not uniform continuity.\nIn contrast, interchanging the two initial universal quantifiers in the definition of pointwise continuity does not change the meaning.\n\nThe maximum depth of nesting of quantifiers in a formula is called its '''[[quantifier rank]]'''.\n\n==Equivalent expressions==\nIf ''D'' is a domain of ''x'' and ''P''(''x'') is a predicate dependent on object variable ''x'', then the universal proposition can be expressed as\n\n:<math>\\forall x\\!\\in\\!D\\; P(x).</math>\n\nThis notation is known as restricted or relativized or [[Bounded quantifier|bounded quantification]]. Equivalently one can write,\n\n:<math>\\forall x\\;(x\\!\\in\\!D \\to P(x)).</math>\n\nThe existential proposition can be expressed with bounded quantification as\n\n:<math>\\exists x\\!\\in\\!D\\; P(x),</math>\n\nor equivalently\n\n:<math>\\exists x\\;(x\\!\\in\\!\\!D \\land P(x)).</math>\n\nTogether with negation, only one of either the universal or existential quantifier is needed to perform both tasks:\n\n:<math>\\neg (\\forall x\\!\\in\\!D\\; P(x)) \\equiv \\exists x\\!\\in\\!D\\; \\neg P(x),</math>\n\nwhich shows that to disprove a \"for all ''x''\" proposition, one needs no more than to find an ''x'' for which the predicate is false. Similarly,\n\n:<math>\\neg (\\exists x\\!\\in\\!D\\; P(x)) \\equiv \\forall x\\!\\in\\!D\\; \\neg P(x),</math>\n\nto disprove a \"there exists an ''x''\" proposition, one needs to show that the predicate is false for all ''x''.\n\n==Range of quantification==\nEvery quantification involves one specific variable and a ''domain of discourse'' or ''range of quantification'' of that variable.  The range of quantification specifies the set of values that the variable takes.  In the examples above, the range of quantification is the set of natural numbers.  Specification of the range of quantification allows us to express the difference between, asserting that a predicate holds for some natural number or for some [[real number]]. Expository conventions often reserve some variable names such as \"''n''\" for natural numbers and \"''x''\" for real numbers, although relying exclusively on naming conventions cannot work in general since ranges of variables can change in the course of a mathematical argument.\n\nA more natural way to restrict the domain of discourse uses ''guarded quantification''.  For example, the guarded quantification \n:For some natural number ''n'', ''n'' is even and ''n'' is prime\nmeans\n:For some [[even number]] ''n'', ''n'' is prime.\n\nIn some mathematical theories a single domain of\ndiscourse fixed in advance is assumed.  For example, in [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]], variables range over all sets.  In this case, guarded quantifiers can be used to mimic a smaller range of quantification.  Thus in the example\nabove to express\n:For every natural number ''n'', ''n''\u00b72 = ''n'' + ''n''\nin Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory, it can be said\n:For every ''n'', if ''n'' belongs to '''N''', then ''n''\u00b72 = ''n'' + ''n'',\nwhere '''N''' is the set of all natural numbers.\n\n==Formal semantics==\nMathematical semantics is the application of [[mathematics]] to study the meaning of expressions in a formal language. It has three elements: a mathematical specification of a class of objects via [[syntax (logic)|syntax]], a mathematical specification of various semantic domains and the relation between the two, which is usually expressed as a function from syntactic objects to semantic ones.  This article only addresses the issue of how quantifier elements are interpreted.\nThe syntax of a formula can be given by a syntax tree. A quantifier has a [[scope (logic)|scope]], and an occurrence of a variable ''x'' is [[free variable|free]] if it is not within the scope of a quantification for that variable. Thus in\n:<math> \\forall x (\\exists y  B(x,y)) \\vee C(y,x) </math>\nthe occurrence of both ''x'' and ''y'' in ''C''(''y'', ''x'') is free, while the occurrence of ''x'' and ''y'' in ''B''(''y'', ''x'') is bound (i.e. non-free).\n\n[[File:QuantifierScopes svg.svg|thumb|350px|Syntax tree of the formula <math> \\forall x (\\exists y  B(x,y)) \\vee C(y,x) </math>, illustrating scope and variable capture. Bound and free variable occurrences are colored in red and green, respectively.]]\nAn [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] for [[first-order predicate calculus]] assumes as given a domain of individuals ''X''.  A formula ''A'' whose free variables are ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>n</sub> is interpreted as a [[Boolean function|boolean]]-valued function ''F''(''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>) of ''n'' arguments, where each argument ranges over the domain ''X''.  Boolean-valued means that the function assumes one of the values '''T''' (interpreted as truth) or '''F''' (interpreted as falsehood). The interpretation of the formula\n:<math> \\forall x_n A(x_1, \\ldots , x_n) </math>\nis the function ''G'' of ''n''-1 arguments such that ''G''(''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''-1</sub>) = '''T''' if and only if ''F''(''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''-1</sub>, ''w'') = '''T''' for every ''w'' in ''X''. If  ''F''(''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''-1</sub>, ''w'') = '''F''' for at least one value of ''w'', then ''G''(''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''-1</sub>) = '''F'''. Similarly the interpretation of the formula\n:<math> \\exists x_n A(x_1, \\ldots , x_n) </math>\nis the function ''H'' of ''n''-1 arguments such that ''H''(''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''-1</sub>) = '''T''' if and only if ''F''(''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''-1</sub>, ''w'') = '''T''' for at least one ''w'' and  ''H''(''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''-1</sub>) = '''F''' otherwise.\n\nThe semantics for [[uniqueness quantification]] requires first-order predicate calculus with equality. This means there is given a distinguished two-placed predicate \"=\"; the semantics is also modified accordingly so that \"=\" is always interpreted as the two-place equality relation on ''X''. The interpretation of  \n:<math> \\exists !   x_n A(x_1, \\ldots , x_n) </math>\nthen is the function of ''n''-1 arguments, which is the logical ''and'' of the interpretations of \n:<math> \\exists  x_n A(x_1, \\ldots , x_n) </math>\n:<math> \\forall y,z \\left\\{  A(x_1, \\ldots ,x_{n-1}, y) \\wedge  A(x_1, \\ldots ,x_{n-1}, z) \\implies y = z \\right\\}.</math>\n\nEach kind of quantification defines a corresponding [[closure operator]] on the set of formulas, by adding, for each free variable ''x'', a quantifier to bind ''x''.<ref>in general, for a quantifer '''Q''', closure makes sense only if the order of '''Q''' quantification does not matter, i.e. if '''Q'''<!------>''x'' '''Q'''<!------>''y'' ''p''(''x'',''y'') is equivalent to '''Q'''<!------>''y'' '''Q'''<!------>''x'' ''p''(''x'',''y'').

In particular, the solution quantifier,<ref>[[E. C. R. Hehner|Hehner, Eric C.

For example,\n:<math> \\left[ \\S n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\quad n^2 \\leq 4 \\right] = \\{0, 1, 2\\}</math>\nis read \"those ''n'' in '''N''' such that ''n''<sup>2</sup> \u2264 4 are in {0,1,2}.\" The same construct is expressible in [[set-builder notation]] as\n:<math>\\{n \\in \\mathbb N: n^2 \\le 4\\} = \\{0, 1, 2\\}.</math>\nContrary to the other quantifiers, \u00a7 yields a set rather than a formula.<ref>Hehner (2004) uses the term \"quantifier\" in a very general sense, also including e.g. [[summation]].</ref>\n\nSome other quantifiers sometimes used in mathematics include:\n*There are infinitely many elements such that...\n*For all but finitely many elements... (sometimes expressed as \"for [[almost all]] elements...\").\n*There are uncountably many elements such that...\n*For all but countably many elements...\n*For all elements in a set of positive measure...\n*For all elements except those in a set of measure zero...\n\n==History==\n[[Term logic]], also called Aristotelian logic, treats quantification in a manner that is closer to natural language, and also less suited to formal analysis. Term logic treated ''All'', ''Some''  and ''No'' in the 4th century BC, in an account also touching on the [[alethic modalities]].\n\nIn 1827, [[George Bentham]] published his ''Outline of a new system of logic, with a critical examination of Dr Whately's Elements of Logic'', describing the principle of the quantifier, but the book was not widely circulated.<ref>George Bentham, ''Outline of a new system of logic: with a critical examination of Dr. Whately's Elements of Logic'' (1827); Thoemmes; Facsimile edition (1990)  {{isbn|1-85506-029-9}}</ref>\n\n[[File:De Morgan Augustus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Augustus De Morgan]] (1806-1871) was the first to use \"quantifier\" in the modern way.]]\n[[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]] claimed to have coined the terms \"quantify\" and \"quantification\", most likely in his Edinburgh lectures c. 1840. [[Augustus De Morgan]] confirmed this in 1847, but modern usage began with De Morgan in 1862 where he makes statements such as \"We are to take in both ''all'' and ''some-not-all'' as quantifiers\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Peters|first1=Stanley|last2=Westerst\u00e5hl|first2=Dag|title=Quantifiers in Language and Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PrYUDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA34|date=2006-04-27|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-929125-0|pages=34\u2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Gottlob Frege]], in his 1879 ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'', was the first to employ a quantifier to bind a variable ranging over a [[domain of discourse]] and appearing in [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]]s. He would universally quantify a variable (or relation) by writing the variable over a dimple in an otherwise straight line appearing in his diagrammatic formulas. Frege did not devise an explicit notation for existential quantification, instead employing his equivalent of ~\u2200''x''~, or [[contraposition]]. Frege's treatment of quantification went largely unremarked until [[Bertrand Russell]]'s 1903 ''Principles of Mathematics''.\n\nIn work that culminated in Peirce (1885), [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and his student [[Oscar Howard Mitchell]] independently invented universal and existential quantifiers, and [[bound variable]]s. Peirce and Mitchell wrote \u03a0<sub>x</sub> and \u03a3<sub>x</sub> where we now write \u2200''x'' and \u2203''x''. Peirce's notation can be found in the writings of [[Ernst Schr\u00f6der]], [[Leopold Loewenheim]], [[Thoralf Skolem]], and Polish logicians into the 1950s. Most notably, it is the notation of [[Kurt G\u00f6del]]'s landmark 1930 paper on the [[G\u00f6del's completeness theorem|completeness]] of [[first-order logic]], and 1931 paper on the [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem|incompleteness]] of [[Peano arithmetic]].\n\nPeirce's approach to quantification also influenced [[William Ernest Johnson]] and [[Giuseppe Peano]], who invented yet another notation, namely (''x'') for the universal quantification of ''x'' and (in 1897) \u2203''x'' for the existential quantification of ''x''. Hence for decades, the canonical notation in philosophy and mathematical logic was (''x'')''P'' to express \"all individuals in the domain of discourse have the property ''P'',\" and \"(\u2203''x'')''P''\" for \"there exists at least one individual in the domain of discourse having the property ''P''.\" Peano, who was much better known than Peirce, in effect diffused the latter's thinking throughout Europe. Peano's notation was adopted by the ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' of [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], and [[Alonzo Church]]. In 1935, [[Gentzen]] introduced the \u2200 symbol, by analogy with Peano's \u2203 symbol. \u2200 did not become canonical until the 1960s.\n\nAround 1895, Peirce began developing his [[existential graph]]s, whose variables can be seen as tacitly quantified. Whether the shallowest instance of a variable is even or odd determines whether that variable's quantification is universal or existential. (Shallowness is the contrary of depth, which is determined by the nesting of negations.) Peirce's graphical logic has attracted some attention in recent years by those researching [[heterogeneous reasoning]] and [[logical graph|diagrammatic inference]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n*[[Generalized quantifier]] &mdash; a higher-order property used as standard semantics of quantified [[noun phrases]]\n*[[Lindstr\u00f6m quantifier]] &mdash; a generalized polyadic quantifier\n*[[Quantifier elimination]]\n*[[Almost all]]\n*[[Eventually (mathematics)]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n* [[Jon Barwise|Barwise, Jon]]; and [[John Etchemendy|Etchemendy, John]], 2000.

{"title_page": "Feminism in the United Kingdom", "text_new": "{{Feminism sidebar}}\nAs in other countries, '''feminism in the United Kingdom''' seeks to establish political, social, and economic equality for women. The history of feminism in Britain dates to the very beginnings of [[feminism]] itself, as many of the earliest feminist writers and activists\u2014such as [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[Barbara Bodichon]], and [[Lydia Becker]]\u2014were British.\n\n==19th century==\n{{main|History of women in the United Kingdom#19th century}}\n[[File:+Ann Thornton Going Aloft.jpg|thumb|160px|''[[Anne Jane Thornton|Ann Thornton]] Going Aloft'', ''c.'' 1835]]\nThe advent of the [[Reformism|reformist]] age during the 19th century meant that those invisible minorities or marginalised majorities were to find a catalyst and a microcosm in such new tendencies of reform. [[Robert Owen]], while asking for \"social reorganisation\", was laying down the basis of a new reformational background. One of those movements that took advantage of such new spirit was the [[feminist movement]]. The stereotype of the [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] gentle lady became unacceptable and even intolerable. The first organised movement for British women's suffrage was the [[Langham Place Circle]] of the 1850s, led by [[Barbara Bodichon]] (''n\u00e9e'' Leigh-Smith) and [[Bessie Rayner Parkes]]. They also campaigned for improved female rights in the law, employment, education, and marriage.\n\nProperty owning women and widows had been allowed to vote in some local elections, but that ended in 1835. The [[Chartist Movement]] of 1838 to 1857 was a large-scale demand for suffrage\u2014however it only gave suffrage to men over 21. In 1851 the [[Sheffield Female Political Association]] was founded and submitted an unsuccessful petition calling for women's suffrage to the House of Lords. This probably inspired British feminist [[Harriet Taylor Mill]] to write the pro-women's-suffrage ''[[The Enfranchisement of Women]]'' (1851).<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/taylor_harriet.shtml|title=BBC - History - Historic Figures: Harriet Taylor (1807 - 1858)}}</ref><ref name=\"Harriet Taylor Mill 1807 - 1858\">[http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/ht_mill4.html Harriet Taylor Mill (1807 - 1858)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070414184944/http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/ht_mill4.html |date=2007-04-14 }}</ref><ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/awrm/doc15.htm|title=Harriet Taylor Mill, Enfranchisement of Women, 1851|website=womhist.alexanderstreet.com}}</ref> On June 7, 1866 a petition from 1,499 women calling for women's suffrage was presented to the Parliament, but it also did not succeed.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsehistory/2016/06/07/the-1866-womens-suffrage-petition/ |title=The 1866 women's suffrage petition &#124; LSE History |publisher=Blogs.lse.ac.uk |date=2016-06-12 |accessdate=2018-02-07}}</ref>\n\nUpper-class women could exert a little backstage political influence in high society.

By the late 1860s a number of schools were preparing women for careers as governesses or teachers.

One route to entry was to go to the United States where there were suitable schools for women as early as 1850.  Britain was the last major country to train women physicians, so 80 to 90% of the British women came to America for their medical degrees.  Edinburgh University admitted a few women in 1869, then reversed itself in 1873, leaving a strong negative reaction among British medical educators.  The first separate school for women physicians opened in London in 1874 to a handful of students. Scotland was more open.

It required a very expensive private act of Parliament costing perhaps \u00a3200, of the sort only the richest could possibly afford. It was very difficult to secure divorce on the grounds of adultery, desertion, or cruelty.  The first key legislative victory came with the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857|Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857]]. It passed over the strenuous opposition of the highly traditional Church of England. The new law made divorce a civil affair of the courts, rather than a Church matter, with a new civil court in London handling all cases.  The process was still quite expensive, at about \u00a340, but now became feasible for the middle class. A woman who obtained a judicial separation took the status of a ''feme sole,'' with full control of her own civil rights.  Additional amendments came in 1878, which allowed for separations handled by local justices of the peace. The Church of England blocked further reforms until the final breakthrough came with the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]].<ref>{{cite book | editor-last = Stone | editor-first = Lawrence | title = Road to divorce: England 1530-1987 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780198226512 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref>\n\n===Prostitution===\n{{main|Prostitution in the United Kingdom}}\nBullough argues that prostitution in 18th-century Britain was a convenience to men of all social statuses, and economic necessity for many poor women, and was tolerated by society.

Parliament in the 1860s in the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]] (\"CD\") adopted the French system of licensed prostitution. The \"regulationist policy\" was to isolate, segregate, and control prostitution. The main goal was to protect working men, soldiers and sailors near ports and army bases from catching venereal disease. Young women officially became prostitutes and were  trapped for life in the system. After a nationwide crusade led by [[Josephine Butler]] and the [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]], Parliament repealed the acts in 1886 and ended legalised prostitution. Butler became a sort of saviour to the girls she helped free. The age of consent for young women was raised from 12 to 16, undercutting the supply of young prostitutes who were in highest demand.

[[Emily Davison]], a WSPU member, unexpectedly ran onto the track during the 1913 [[Epsom Derby]] and died under the King's horse. These tactics produced mixed results of sympathy and alienation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} As many protesters were imprisoned and [[Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913|went on hunger-strike]], the Liberal government was left with an embarrassing situation. From these political actions, the suffragists successfully created publicity around their institutional discrimination and sexism.  Historians generally argue that the first stage of the militant suffragette movement under the Pankhursts in 1906 had a dramatic mobilizing effect on the suffrage movement.  Women were thrilled and supportive of revolting in the streets; the membership of the militant WSPU and the older NUWSS overlapped and was mutually supportive.  However a system of publicity, Ensor argues, had to continue to escalate to maintain its high visibility in the media.  The hunger strikes and force-feeding did that.  However the Pankhursts refused any advice and escalated their tactics. They turned to systematic disruption of Liberal Party meetings as well as physical violence in terms of damaging public buildings and arson.  This went too far, as the overwhelming majority of suffragists pulled back and refused to follow because they could no longer defend the tactics.  Shey increasingly repudiated the suffragettes as an obstacle to achieving suffrage, saying the militant suffragettes  were now aiding the antis, and many historians agree.  Searle says the methods of the suffragettes did succeed in damaging the Liberal party but failed to advance the cause of woman suffrage.  When the Pankhursts decided to stop the militancy at the start of the war, and enthusiastically support the war effort, the movement split and their leadership role ended.  Suffrage did come four years later, but the feminist movement in Britain permanently abandoned the militant tactics that had made the suffragettes famous.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ensor | first = Robert C.K. | title = England: 1870-1914 | pages = 389\u2013399 | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | oclc = 24731395 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Searle | first = G.

Pugh (1974) argues that enfranchising soldiers primarily and women secondarily was decided by senior politicians in 1916. In the absence of major women's groups demanding for equal suffrage, the government's conference recommended limited, age-restricted women's suffrage. The [[suffragettes]] had been weakened, Pugh argues, by repeated failures before 1914 and by the disorganising effects of war mobilization; therefore they quietly accepted these restrictions, which were approved in 1918 by a majority of the War Ministry and each political party in Parliament.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Pugh | first = Martin D. | title = Politicians and the woman's vote 1914\u20131918 | journal = [[History (journal)|History]] | volume = 59 | issue = 197 | pages = 358\u2013374 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-229X.1974.tb02222.x | jstor = 24409414 | date = October 1974 | ref = harv }}</ref> More generally, Searle (2004) argues that the British debate was essentially over by the 1890s, and that granting the suffrage in 1918 was mostly a byproduct of giving the vote to male soldiers.

It also lobbied at an international level, such as the [[League of Nations]], and continued its work till 1983. In retrospect both ideological groups were influential in advancing women's rights in their own way. Despite women being admitted to the House of Commons from 1918, Mackworth, a Viscountess in her own right, spent a lifetime fighting to take her seat in the House of Lords against bitter opposition, a battle which only achieved its goal in the year of her death (1958). This revealed the weaknesses of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act. Mackworth also founded [[Time and Tide (magazine)|''Time and Tide'']] which became the group's journal, and to which West, Virginia Woolf, [[Rose Macaulay]] and many others contributed. A number of other women's periodicals also appeared in the 1920s, including ''Woman and Home'', and ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'', but whose content reflect very different aspirations. In 1925 Rebecca West wrote in ''Time and Tide'' something that reflected not only the movement's need to redefine itself post suffrage, but a continual need for re-examination of goals. \"When those of our army whose voices are inclined to coolly tell us that the day of sex-antagonism is over and henceforth we have only to advance hand in hand with the male, I do not believe it.\"<ref>Walters, Margaret (2005). \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=PCwdyaLCbXoC&pg=PT116 Early 20th-century feminism]\".

Among other things, it created a public duty to promote equality on the ground of gender (The Equality Act 2006, section 84, inserting section 76A of the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]], now found in section 1 of the [[Equality Act 2010]].)\n\nSince 2007, [[Harriet Harman]] has been Deputy Leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the UK's current opposition party.

This was, primarily, the [[Equal Pay Act 1970]], the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]], the [[Race Relations Act 1976]], the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]] and three major [[statutory instruments]] protecting against discrimination in employment on grounds of [[Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003|religion or belief]], [[Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003|sexual orientation]] and [[Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006|age]]. It requires equal treatment in access to employment as well as private and public services, regardless of the protected characteristics of sex, age, [[disability]], [[sex reassignment therapy|gender reassignment]], marriage and civil partnership, race, religion or belief, and [[sexual orientation]]. In the case of gender, there are special protections for pregnant women.

The women were then subjected to compulsory checks for venereal disease. If a woman was declared to be infected, she would be confined in what was known as a [[lock hospital]] until she recovered or her sentence finished.

countries, '''feminism in the United Kingdom''' seeks to establish political, social, and economic equality for women. The history of feminism in Britain dates to the very beginnings of [[feminism]] itself, as many of the earliest feminist writers and activists\u2014such as [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[Barbara Bodichon]], and [[Lydia Becker]]\u2014were British.\n\n==19th century==\n{{main|History of women in the United Kingdom#19th century}}\n[[File:+Ann Thornton Going Aloft.jpg|thumb|160px|''[[Anne Jane Thornton|Ann Thornton]] Going Aloft'', ''c.'' 1835]]\nThe advent of the [[Reformism|reformist]] age during the 19th century meant that those invisible minorities or marginalised majorities were to find a catalyst and a microcosm in such new tendencies of reform. [[Robert Owen]], while asking for \"social reorganisation\", was laying down the basis of a new reformational background. One of those movements that took advantage of such new spirit was the [[feminist movement]]. The stereotype of the [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] gentle lady became unacceptable and even intolerable. The first organised movement for British women's suffrage was the [[Langham Place Circle]] of the 1850s, led by [[Barbara Bodichon]] (''n\u00e9e'' Leigh-Smith) and [[Bessie Rayner Parkes]]. They also campaigned for improved female rights in the law, employment, education, and marriage.\n\nProperty owning women and widows had been allowed to vote in some local elections, but that ended in 1835. The [[Chartist Movement]] of 1838 to 1857 was a large-scale demand for suffrage\u2014however it only gave suffrage to men over 21. In 1851 the [[Sheffield Female Political Association]] was founded and submitted an unsuccessful petition calling for women's suffrage to the House of Lords. This probably inspired British feminist [[Harriet Taylor Mill]] to write the pro-women's-suffrage ''[[The Enfranchisement of Women]]'' (1851).<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/taylor_harriet.shtml|title=BBC - History - Historic Figures: Harriet Taylor (1807 - 1858)}}</ref><ref name=\"Harriet Taylor Mill 1807 - 1858\">[http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/ht_mill4.html Harriet Taylor Mill (1807 - 1858)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070414184944/http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/ht_mill4.html |date=2007-04-14 }}</ref><ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/awrm/doc15.htm|title=Harriet Taylor Mill, Enfranchisement of Women, 1851|website=womhist.alexanderstreet.com}}</ref> On June 7, 1866 a petition from 1,499 women calling for women's suffrage was presented to the Parliament, but it also did not succeed.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsehistory/2016/06/07/the-1866-womens-suffrage-petition/ |title=The 1866 women's suffrage petition &#124; LSE History |publisher=Blogs.lse.ac.uk |date=2016-06-12 |accessdate=2018-02-07}}</ref>\n\nUpper-class women could exert a little backstage political influence in high society. However, in divorce cases, rich women lost control of their children.\n\n===Careers===\nAmbitious middle-class women faced enormous challenges when they proposed entering suitable careers, such as nursing, teaching, law, and medicine, and the loftier their ambition, the greater the challenge. Physicians barred admission to the medical profession; there were a few opportunities for women lawyers, but none as clerics.<ref name=\"Hal\u00e9vy_500_506\">{{cite book | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | pages = 500\u2013506 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref> White collar business opportunities outside family-owned shops were few until clerical positions opened in the 20th century.  [[Florence Nightingale]] demonstrated the necessity of professional nursing and warfare, and set up an educational system that tracked women into that field in the second half of the nineteenth century.  Teaching was not quite as easy to break into, but the low salaries were less of the barrier to the single woman than to the married man.  By the late 1860s a number of schools were preparing women for careers as governesses or teachers. The census reported in 1851 that 70,000 women in England and Wales were teachers, compared to the 170,000 who comprised three-fourths of all teachers in 1901.<ref name=\"Hal\u00e9vy_500\">{{cite book | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | page = 500 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Copelman | first = Dina | title = London's women teachers: gender, class and feminism, 1870-1930 | publisher = Routledge | location = London | year = 2014 | isbn = 9780415867528 }}</ref> The great majority came from lower middle class origins.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Coppock | first = David A. | title = Respectability as a prerequisite of moral character: the social and occupational mobility of pupil teachers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries | journal = [[History of Education Quarterly|History of Education]] | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 165\u2013186 | doi = 10.1080/0046760970260203 | date = 1997 | ref = harv }}</ref> The National Union of Women Teachers (NUWT) originated in the early 20th century inside the male-controlled National Union of Teachers (NUT).

One route to entry was to go to the United States where there were suitable schools for women as early as 1850.  Britain was the last major country to train women physicians, so 80 to 90% of the British women came to America for their medical degrees.  Edinburgh University admitted a few women in 1869, then reversed itself in 1873, leaving a strong negative reaction among British medical educators.  The first separate school for women physicians opened in London in 1874 to a handful of students. Scotland was more open.

The first key legislative victory came with the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857|Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857]]. It passed over the strenuous opposition of the highly traditional Church of England. The new law made divorce a civil affair of the courts, rather than a Church matter, with a new civil court in London handling all cases.  The process was still quite expensive, at about \u00a340, but now became feasible for the middle class. A woman who obtained a judicial separation took the status of a ''feme sole,'' with full control of her own civil rights.  Additional amendments came in 1878, which allowed for separations handled by local justices of the peace. The Church of England blocked further reforms until the final breakthrough came with the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]].<ref>{{cite book | editor-last = Stone | editor-first = Lawrence | title = Road to divorce: England 1530-1987 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780198226512 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref>\n\n===Prostitution===\n{{main|Prostitution in the United Kingdom}}\nBullough argues that prostitution in 18th-century Britain was a convenience to men of all social statuses, and economic necessity for many poor women, and was tolerated by society.

Parliament in the 1860s in the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]] (\"CD\") adopted the French system of licensed prostitution. The \"regulationist policy\" was to isolate, segregate, and control prostitution. The main goal was to protect working men, soldiers and sailors near ports and army bases from catching venereal disease. Young women officially became prostitutes and were  trapped for life in the system. After a nationwide crusade led by [[Josephine Butler]] and the [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]], Parliament repealed the acts in 1886 and ended legalised prostitution. Butler became a sort of saviour to the girls she helped free. The age of consent for young women was raised from 12 to 16, undercutting the supply of young prostitutes who were in highest demand. The new moral code meant that respectable men dared not be caught.<ref name=\"Hal\u00e9vy_498\">{{cite book | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | pages = 498\u2013500 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Strachey | first1 = Ray | last2 = Strachey | first2 = Barbara | title = The cause: a short history of the women's movement in Great Britain | pages = 187\u2013222 | publisher = Virago | location = London | year = 1978 | isbn = 9780860680420 | ref = harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Bartley | first = Paula | title = Prostitution: prevention and reform in England, 1860-1914 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780415214575 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Smith | first = F.B. | title = The Contagious Diseases Acts reconsidered | journal = Social History of Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 197\u2013215 | doi = 10.1093/shm/3.2.197 | pmid = 11622578 | date = August 1990 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n===Protection for rich and poor women===\nA series of four laws each called the [[Married Women's Property Act (disambiguation)|Married Women's Property Act]] passed Parliament from [[Married Women's Property Act 1870|1870]] to [[Married Women's Property Act 1893|1893]] that effectively removed the restrictions that kept wealthy married women from controlling their own property.

[[Emily Davison]], a WSPU member, unexpectedly ran onto the track during the 1913 [[Epsom Derby]] and died under the King's horse. These tactics produced mixed results of sympathy and alienation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} As many protesters were imprisoned and [[Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913|went on hunger-strike]], the Liberal government was left with an embarrassing situation. From these political actions, the suffragists successfully created publicity around their institutional discrimination and sexism.  Historians generally argue that the first stage of the militant suffragette movement under the Pankhursts in 1906 had a dramatic mobilizing effect on the suffrage movement.  Women were thrilled and supportive of revolting in the streets; the membership of the militant WSPU and the older NUWSS overlapped and was mutually supportive.  However a system of publicity, Ensor argues, had to continue to escalate to maintain its high visibility in the media.  The hunger strikes and force-feeding did that.  However the Pankhursts refused any advice and escalated their tactics. They turned to systematic disruption of Liberal Party meetings as well as physical violence in terms of damaging public buildings and arson.  This went too far, as the overwhelming majority of suffragists pulled back and refused to follow because they could no longer defend the tactics.  Shey increasingly repudiated the suffragettes as an obstacle to achieving suffrage, saying the militant suffragettes  were now aiding the antis, and many historians agree.  Searle says the methods of the suffragettes did succeed in damaging the Liberal party but failed to advance the cause of woman suffrage.  When the Pankhursts decided to stop the militancy at the start of the war, and enthusiastically support the war effort, the movement split and their leadership role ended.  Suffrage did come four years later, but the feminist movement in Britain permanently abandoned the militant tactics that had made the suffragettes famous.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ensor | first = Robert C.K. | title = England: 1870-1914 | pages = 389\u2013399 | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | oclc = 24731395 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Searle | first = G.

Pugh (1974) argues that enfranchising soldiers primarily and women secondarily was decided by senior politicians in 1916. In the absence of major women's groups demanding for equal suffrage, the government's conference recommended limited, age-restricted women's suffrage. The [[suffragettes]] had been weakened, Pugh argues, by repeated failures before 1914 and by the disorganising effects of war mobilization; therefore they quietly accepted these restrictions, which were approved in 1918 by a majority of the War Ministry and each political party in Parliament.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Pugh | first = Martin D. | title = Politicians and the woman's vote 1914\u20131918 | journal = [[History (journal)|History]] | volume = 59 | issue = 197 | pages = 358\u2013374 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-229X.1974.tb02222.x | jstor = 24409414 | date = October 1974 | ref = harv }}</ref> More generally, Searle (2004) argues that the British debate was essentially over by the 1890s, and that granting the suffrage in 1918 was mostly a byproduct of giving the vote to male soldiers.

In retrospect both ideological groups were influential in advancing women's rights in their own way. Despite women being admitted to the House of Commons from 1918, Mackworth, a Viscountess in her own right, spent a lifetime fighting to take her seat in the House of Lords against bitter opposition, a battle which only achieved its goal in the year of her death (1958). This revealed the weaknesses of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act. Mackworth also founded [[Time and Tide (magazine)|''Time and Tide'']] which became the group's journal, and to which West, Virginia Woolf, [[Rose Macaulay]] and many others contributed. A number of other women's periodicals also appeared in the 1920s, including ''Woman and Home'', and ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'', but whose content reflect very different aspirations.

This was, primarily, the [[Equal Pay Act 1970]], the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]], the [[Race Relations Act 1976]], the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]] and three major [[statutory instruments]] protecting against discrimination in employment on grounds of [[Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003|religion or belief]], [[Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003|sexual orientation]] and [[Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006|age]]. It requires equal treatment in access to employment as well as private and public services, regardless of the protected characteristics of sex, age, [[disability]], [[sex reassignment therapy|gender reassignment]], marriage and civil partnership, race, religion or belief, and [[sexual orientation]].
