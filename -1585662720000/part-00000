They were forced to cede most of their land to the United States after the American Revolutionary War.\n\nWhen the English established counties in New York Province in 1683, they designated [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]] as including all the northern part of New York State, the present State of [[Vermont]], and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. On July 3, 1766 [[Cumberland County, New York|Cumberland County]] was organized, and on March 16, 1770 [[Gloucester County, New York|Gloucester County]] was founded, both containing territory now included in the state of Vermont. The English claims were their assertion; the Five and then Six Nations of the Iroquois occupied and controlled most of the territory in central and western New York until after the Revolutionary War.\n\nAs New York was more heavily settled in the 18th century, the colonial government organized additional counties, but European settlement did not proceed very far west past [[Little Falls, New York]], about halfway through the Mohawk Valley, until after the revolutionary war. This area was ostsenibly part of Montgomery County, renamed after the war for an American officer. [[Seth Reed]], a Colonel in the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]], moved here with his family as a pioneer between 1787 and 1795. See also [[Geneva (town), New York]]<ref name=\"pioneer\">Turner, p.319</ref>\n\nLand-hungry settlers from New England swept into upstate and western New York after the Revolution, as nearly five million acres of new lands were available for purchase since the Iroquois were forced to cede most of their territories to the United States. Four tribes had allied with the British and were mostly resettled in Canada: the Mohawk, Onondaga, Seneca and Cayuga.\n\nTransfer of what is now Ontario County to New York formally took effect in 1789, when native title was extinguished and the county was formally established to govern the lands of the [[Phelps and Gorham Purchase]] the year prior. The territory first organized as Ontario County was much larger than at present and ran south from the shore of [[Lake Ontario]]. As the area was settled, new counties were organized. The following counties were rapidly organized from this territory in the first decades after the war: [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany]], [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]], [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua]], [[Erie County, New York|Erie]], [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee]], [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston]], [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe]], [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara]], [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans]], [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben]], [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming]], and [[Yates County, New York|Yates]] counties, and parts of [[Schuyler County, New York|Schuyler]] and [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne]] counties.\n\nIn 1796, Ontario County was divided and [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben County]] was organized. In 1802, Ontario County was reduced when [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee County]] was split off. The new county was originally very large, including the present [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany]], [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]], [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua]], [[Erie County, New York|Erie]], [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara]], [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans]] and [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming Counties]] and parts of [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston]] and [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe]] counties.\n\nIn 1821, portions of Genesee County were combined with portions of Ontario County to create [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston]] and [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe]] counties.\n\nIn 1823, a portion of Seneca County was combined with a portion of Ontario County to create [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne County]]. The same year, a portion of Steuben County was combined with a portion of Ontario County to create [[Yates County, New York|Yates County]].\n\n==Great Awakening==\nThis frontier area was part of the evangelistic activities during the [[Second Great Awakening]] of the early 19th century, when [[Baptist]], [[Methodist]] and [[Congregational]] preachers traveled and organized revivals and camp meetings. In addition, independent sects developed in central and western New York during this period, including the [[Church of Latter Day Saints]], the [[Shakers]] and the [[Universal Friends]].\n\n===Latter Day Saint movement===\n[[File:Smith frame home 1.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Home of the [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]] family in Manchester, known as the \"frame home\".]]\n{{See also|History of the Latter Day Saint movement}}\n\n[[Joseph Smith]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], lived in [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]] in the 1820s on the border with [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra]]. Several events in the early history of the movement occurred in Ontario County. [[Cumorah#New York|Hill Cumorah]] in Manchester is where Smith said he discovered the [[Golden plates]] said to contain the writings later known as the ''[[Book of Mormon]]''. Smith visited the hill each year on the [[Fall equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|fall equinox]] (September 22) between 1823 and 1827, and claimed to be instructed by the [[Angel Moroni]]. Smith said he was finally permitted to take the record on September 22, 1827.  He published the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'' in Palmyra in 1830. The {{convert|110|ft|m|adj=on}} hill (which was then unnamed) is on the main road toward [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua]] from Palmyra to [[Manchester, New York|Manchester]] (modern [[New York State Route 21|State Route 21]]); it was a few miles from Joseph Smith's home.\n\nSince the 1930s [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has held the [[Cumorah#Pageant|Hill Cumorah Pageant]] annually here. It regularly attracts thousands to its performances.<ref>{{cite news | title = A History Lesson | publisher = The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle | date = July 8, 2001 }}</ref>  The church also maintains a visitors' center at the hill, the [[Palmyra New York Temple]], and the former Smith property and homes. The latter property straddles the border between Ontario and Wayne counties.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|663|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|644|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|18|sqmi}} (2.8%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 6, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519062322/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt|archivedate=May 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOntario County is in western New York State, east of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], southeast of [[Rochester, Monroe County, New York|Rochester]], and northwest of [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]].

The Board of Supervisors has twenty-one members: one is elected from each Town, two from the city of [[Canandaigua, New York|Canandaigua]] and three from the city of [[Geneva, New York|Geneva]]. As of 2004, the county government has over 800 full-time employees (augmented by another 360 seasonal or available part-time workers), and a budget of $136 million.\nThe county is similar in its politics to much of the rest of rural [[upstate New York]]; its voters have tended to support Republican presidential candidates ever since that party was formed, and before that they supported [[Whig Party (United States)|the Whig Party]].\n\nHowever, in 1996, Ontario County voted for the Democratic presidential candidate for the first time since 1964 and only the second time since the Whig Party contested its first presidential election [[1836 United States presidential election|in 1836]]. In 2008, John McCain narrowly edged a victory over Barack Obama by less than one percent, while in 2012 Obama narrowly lost the county to Republican nominee Mitt Romney by a margin of 1.5 percent. In 2016, Republican nominee [[Donald Trump]] of New York City won the county by 7.3% over Democratic nominee and former [[United States Secretary of State]] / former Senator from New York [[Hillary Clinton]] of [[Chappaqua, New York]].\n\n===State and federal government===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n|-\n!

They were forced to cede most of their land to the United States after the American Revolutionary War.\n\nWhen the English established counties in New York Province in 1683, they designated [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]] as including all the northern part of New York State, the present State of [[Vermont]], and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. On July 3, 1766 [[Cumberland County, New York|Cumberland County]] was organized, and on March 16, 1770 [[Gloucester County, New York|Gloucester County]] was founded, both containing territory now included in the state of Vermont. The English claims were their assertion; the Five and then Six Nations of the Iroquois occupied and controlled most of the territory in central and western New York until after the Revolutionary War.\n\nAs New York was more heavily settled in the 18th century, the colonial government organized additional counties, but European settlement did not proceed very far west past [[Little Falls, New York]], about halfway through the Mohawk Valley, until after the revolutionary war. This area was ostsenibly part of Montgomery County, renamed after the war for an American officer. [[Seth Reed]], a Colonel in the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]], moved here with his family as a pioneer between 1787 and 1795. See also [[Geneva (town), New York]]<ref name=\"pioneer\">Turner, p.319</ref>\n\nLand-hungry settlers from New England swept into upstate and western New York after the Revolution, as nearly five million acres of new lands were available for purchase since the Iroquois were forced to cede most of their territories to the United States. Four tribes had allied with the British and were mostly resettled in Canada: the Mohawk, Onondaga, Seneca and Cayuga.\n\nTransfer of what is now Ontario County to New York formally took effect in 1789, when native title was extinguished and the county was formally established to govern the lands of the [[Phelps and Gorham Purchase]] the year prior. The territory first organized as Ontario County was much larger than at present and ran south from the shore of [[Lake Ontario]]. As the area was settled, new counties were organized. The following counties were rapidly organized from this territory in the first decades after the war: [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany]], [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]], [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua]], [[Erie County, New York|Erie]], [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee]], [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston]], [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe]], [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara]], [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans]], [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben]], [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming]], and [[Yates County, New York|Yates]] counties, and parts of [[Schuyler County, New York|Schuyler]] and [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne]] counties.\n\nIn 1796, Ontario County was divided and [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben County]] was organized. In 1802, Ontario County was reduced when [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee County]] was split off. The new county was originally very large, including the present [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany]], [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]], [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua]], [[Erie County, New York|Erie]], [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara]], [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans]] and [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming Counties]] and parts of [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston]] and [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe]] counties.\n\nIn 1821, portions of Genesee County were combined with portions of Ontario County to create [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston]] and [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe]] counties.\n\nIn 1823, a portion of Seneca County was combined with a portion of Ontario County to create [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne County]]. The same year, a portion of Steuben County was combined with a portion of Ontario County to create [[Yates County, New York|Yates County]].\n\n==Great Awakening==\nThis frontier area was part of the evangelistic activities during the [[Second Great Awakening]] of the early 19th century, when [[Baptist]], [[Methodist]] and [[Congregational]] preachers traveled and organized revivals and camp meetings. In addition, independent sects developed in central and western New York during this period, including the [[Church of Latter Day Saints]], the [[Shakers]] and the [[Universal Friends]].\n\n===Latter Day Saint movement===\n[[File:Smith frame home 1.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Home of the [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]] family in Manchester, known as the \"frame home\".]]\n{{See also|History of the Latter Day Saint movement}}\n\n[[Joseph Smith]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], lived in [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]] in the 1820s on the border with [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra]]. Several events in the early history of the movement occurred in Ontario County. [[Cumorah#New York|Hill Cumorah]] in Manchester is where Smith said he discovered the [[Golden plates]] said to contain the writings later known as the ''[[Book of Mormon]]''. Smith visited the hill each year on the [[Fall equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|fall equinox]] (September 22) between 1823 and 1827, and claimed to be instructed by the [[Angel Moroni]]. Smith said he was finally permitted to take the record on September 22, 1827.  He published the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'' in Palmyra in 1830. The {{convert|110|ft|m|adj=on}} hill (which was then unnamed) is on the main road toward [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua]] from Palmyra to [[Manchester, New York|Manchester]] (modern [[New York State Route 21|State Route 21]]); it was a few miles from Joseph Smith's home.\n\nSince the 1930s [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has held the [[Cumorah#Pageant|Hill Cumorah Pageant]] annually here.

The Board of Supervisors has twenty-one members: one is elected from each Town, two from the city of [[Canandaigua, New York|Canandaigua]] and three from the city of [[Geneva, New York|Geneva]]. As of 2004, the county government has over 800 full-time employees (augmented by another 360 seasonal or available part-time workers), and a budget of $136 million.\nThe county is similar in its politics to much of the rest of rural [[upstate New York]]; its voters have tended to support Republican presidential candidates ever since that party was formed, and before that they supported [[Whig Party (United States)|the Whig Party]].\n\nHowever, in 1996, Ontario County voted for the Democratic presidential candidate for the first time since 1964 and only the second time since the Whig Party contested its first presidential election [[1836 United States presidential election|in 1836]]. In 2008, John McCain narrowly edged a victory over Barack Obama by less than one percent, while in 2012 Obama narrowly lost the county to Republican nominee Mitt Romney by a margin of 1.5 percent. In 2016, Republican nominee [[Donald Trump]] of New York City won the county by 7.3% over Democratic nominee and former [[United States Secretary of State]] / former Senator from New York [[Hillary Clinton]] of [[Chappaqua, New York]].\n\n===State and federal government===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n|- \n!

{"title_page": "Aerodynamic heating", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=January 2017}}\n'''Aerodynamic heating''' is the heating of a solid body produced by its high-speed passage through air (or by the passage of air past a static body), whereby its kinetic energy [[heat transfer|is converted to heat]] by [[Adiabatic_process#Adiabatic_heating_and_cooling|adiabatic heating]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/research/2007/faq-shuttleglass_prt.htm |title=NASA \u2013 Spacecraft Design |accessdate=January 7, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709055746/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/research/2007/faq-shuttleglass_prt.htm |archivedate=July 9, 2009 }}</ref> and (less significantly) by [[Friction#Skin friction|skin friction]] on the surface of the object at a rate that depends on the [[viscosity]] and speed of the air. In science and engineering, it is most frequently a concern regarding [[meteors]], [[atmospheric reentry]] of spacecraft, and the design of high-speed [[aircraft]].\n\n==Physics==\nWhen moving through air at high speeds, an object's [[kinetic energy]] is converted to heat through compression of and friction with the air. At low speeds, the object also loses heat to the air if the air is cooler. The combined temperature effect of heat from the air and from passage through it is called the [[stagnation temperature]]; the actual temperature is called the recovery temperature.<ref>\n{{Citation\n | last = Kurganov\n | first = V.A. \n | title = Adiabatic Wall Temperature\n | publisher = Thermopedia\n | date = 3 February 2011\n | doi = 10.1615/AtoZ.a.adiabatic_wall_temperature\n | url = http://www.thermopedia.com/content/291/\n | accessdate = 2015-10-03}}\n</ref> These viscous dissipative effects to neighboring sub-layers make the [[boundary layer]] slow down via a non-[[isentropic]] process.  Heat then conducts into the surface material from the higher temperature air. The result is an increase in the temperature of the material and a loss of energy from the flow. The forced convection ensures that other material replenishes the gases that have cooled to continue the process.{{citation needed|date = November 2017}}\n\nThe stagnation and the recovery temperature of a flow increases with the speed of the flow and are greater at high speeds. The total [[thermal loading]] of the object is a function of both the recovery temperature and the [[mass flow rate]] of the flow. Aerodynamic heating is greatest at high speeds and in the lower atmosphere where the density is greater.  In addition to the convective process described above, there is also [[thermal radiation]] from the flow to the body and vice versa, with the net direction governed by the their temperatures relative to each other.{{citation needed|date = November 2017}}\n\nAerodynamic heating increases with the speed of the vehicle. Its effects are minimal at [[subsonic speed]]s, but are significant enough at [[supersonic speed]]s beyond about [[Mach number|Mach]] 2.2 that they affect design and material considerations for the vehicle's structure and internal systems. The heating effects are greatest at [[leading edge]]s, but the whole vehicle heats up to a stable temperature if its speed remains constant. Aerodynamic heating is dealt with by the use of [[alloy]]s that can withstand high temperatures, [[thermal insulation|insulation]] of the exterior of the vehicle, or the use of [[ablative material]].\n\n==Aircraft==\nAerodynamic heating is a concern for [[supersonic aircraft|supersonic]] and [[hypersonic aircraft]].\n\nOne of the main concerns caused by aerodynamic heating arises in the design of the wing. For subsonic speeds, two main goals of wing design are minimizing weight and maximizing strength. Aerodynamic heating, which occurs at supersonic and hypersonic speeds, adds an additional consideration in wing structure analysis. An idealized wing structure is made up of [[spar (aeronautics)|spars]], [[stringer (aircraft)|stringers]], and [[skin (aeronautics)|skin segments]]. In a wing that normally experiences subsonic speeds, there must be a sufficient number of stringers to withstand the axial and bending stresses induced by the [[lift force]] acting on the wing. In addition, the distance between the stringers must be small enough that the skin panels do not buckle, and the panels must be thick enough to withstand the [[shear stress]] and shear flow present in the panels due to the lifting force on the wing. However, the weight of the wing must be made as small as possible, so the choice of material for the stringers and the skin is an important factor.{{citation needed|date = November 2017}}\n\nAt supersonic speeds, aerodynamic heating adds another element to this structural analysis. At normal speeds, spars and stringers experience a load called Delta P, which is a function of the lift force, first and [[second moment of inertia|second moments of inertia]], and length of the spar. When there are more spars and stringers, the Delta P in each member is reduced, and the area of the stringer can be reduced to meet critical stress requirements. However, the increase in temperature caused by energy flowing from the air (heated by skin friction at these high speeds) adds another load factor, called a thermal load, to the spars. This thermal load increases the net force felt by the stringers, and thus the area of the stringers must be increased in order for the critical stress requirement to be met.{{citation needed|date = November 2017}}\n\nAnother issue that aerodynamic heating causes for aircraft design is the effect of high temperatures on common material properties. Common materials used in aircraft wing design, such as aluminum and steel, experience a decrease in strength as temperatures get extremely high. The [[Young's modulus|Young's Modulus]] of the material, defined as the ratio between stress and strain experienced by the material, decreases as the temperature increases. Young's Modulus is critical in the selection of materials for wing, as a higher value lets the material resist the yield and shear stress caused by the lift and thermal loads. This is because Young's Modulus is an important factor in the equations for calculating the critical buckling load for axial members and the critical buckling shear stress for skin panels. If the Young's Modulus of the material decreases at high temperatures caused by aerodynamic heating, then the wing design will call for larger spars and thicker skin segments in order to account for this decrease in strength as the aircraft goes supersonic. There are some materials that retain their strength at the high temperatures that aerodynamic heating induces. For example, [[Inconel|Inconel X-750]] was used on parts of the airframe of the [[X-15]], a North American aircraft that flew at hypersonic speeds in 1958.<ref>{{cite book |title=Die schnellsten Jets der Welt: Weltrekord-Flugzeuge |trans-title=The Fastest Jets in the World: World Record Aircraft |publisher=Aviatic Verlag |location=Kolpingring, Germany |language=German |first=Ferdinand C.

As the flow is already supersonic, increasing the speed even more would not be beneficial for the wing structure. Reducing the thickness of the wing brings the top and bottom stringers closer together, reducing the total moment of inertia of the structure. This increases is axial load in the stringers, and thus the area, and weight, of the stringers must be increased. Some designs for hypersonic missiles have used liquid cooling of the [[leading edge]]s (usually the fuel en route to the engine). The [[Sprint (missile)|Sprint missile]]'s heat shield needed several design iterations for Mach 10 temperatures.<ref>Bell Labs 1974, 9-17</ref>\n\n== Reentry vehicles ==\nHeating caused by the very high reentry speeds (greater than [[Mach number|Mach]] 20) is sufficient to destroy the vehicle unless special techniques are used. The early space capsules such as used on [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], and [[Apollo program|Apollo]] were given blunt shapes to produce a stand-off bow shock, allowing most of the heat to dissipate into the surrounding air. Additionally, these vehicles had ablative material that [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimate]]s into a gas at high temperature. The act of sublimation absorbs the thermal energy from the aerodynamic heating and erodes the material away as opposed to heating the capsule. The surface of the heat shield for the Mercury spacecraft had a coating of aluminum with glassfiber in many layers. As the temperature rose to {{convert|1100|C|K|sigfig=2}} the layers would evaporate and take the heat with it. The spacecraft would become hot but not harmfully so.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Project Mercury Worked |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/project-mercury2.htm |website=How Stuff Works |accessdate=2011-10-04}}</ref> The [[Space Shuttle]] used insulating [[tile]]s on its lower surface to absorb and radiate heat while preventing conduction to the aluminum [[airframe]].
