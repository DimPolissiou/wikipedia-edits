Alanya's greatest political importance came in the [[Middle Ages]], with the [[Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm]] under the rule of [[Kayqubad I|Alaeddin Kayqubad I]], from whom the city derives its name.

Tourism has risen since 1958 to become the dominant industry in the city, resulting in a corresponding increase in city population.
