During this period Walker also wrote a number of stories including ''[[Daemonifuge]]'' and ''[[The Inspectre]]'', often with co-author [[Jim Campbell (British comics creator)|Jim Campbell]].

In April [[2006 in comics|2006]], he worked on Marvel's cosmic crossover event, \"[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]\" with DnA plotting [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]], one of its four lead-ins.\n\nIn 2005, Walker was commissioned by design agency [http://www.thankodd.com ODD] to draw the character of a 13-year-old [[James Bond]] for [[Charlie Higson]]'s first [[Young Bond]] novel ''[[SilverFin]]''.<ref>Ezard, John (April 23, 2005). \"[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/apr/23/books.shopping Young Bond proves a bestseller]\", ''[[The Guardian]]'', p. 10.

It has two narrative threads: a [[frame story]] implicitly set in Iceland and more or less in the present; and the main narrative, told within this frame, set in a distant and fantastical past.

The story contains elements of satire of modern society.<ref>Dagn\u00fd Kristj\u00e1nsd\u00f3ttir, 'Nominert til nordisk pris: Den som vinner tiden \u2013 taper verden', ''Barnebokkritikk'', http://www.barnebokkritikk.no/nominert-til-nordisk-pris-den-som-vinner-tiden-taper-verden; \u00c1rmann Jakobsson, Helga Birgisd\u00f3ttir, G\u00edsli Sk\u00falason, 'T\u00edmakistan og St\u00edna st\u00f3ras\u00e6ng tilnefndar', ''Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0'', 26.3.2014, http://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2014/03/26/timakistan_og_stina_storasaeng_tilnefndar/.</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\n\nIn the frame story, the main character is a girl called Sigr\u00fan. The world is in the grip of an economic crisis, and Sigr\u00fan's parents are convinced by adverts to buy three flat-pack boxes which turn out to be boxes in which, when the box is closed, time stands still. Each family member enters their own box, in the expectation that all will automatically be released at the same time, once the recession is over.\n\nHowever, Sigr\u00fan's box opens early, and she finds her home overgrown and inhabited by animals; lacking the requisite type of allen key, she is unable to open her parents' boxes. It later emerges that the more adults attempted to escape the recession by entering time-boxes, the deeper the recession grew, until everyone had shut themselves in a time-box, leaving all the physical remains of human civilisation to decay. Sigr\u00fan and other children in a similar situation converge on the home of the only adult who is not in a time-box, a mysterious old woman called Svala.\n\nSvala recounts to the children the story of Hrafntinna, the Princess of [[Pangaea|Pangea]] (who later turns out to be Svala herself). The story explains that a male ancestor of Hrafntinna's was taught by three mysterious sisters to command animals by means of spells. The sisters prohibited him from using these powers to harm people. People are so impressed by this man that he becomes king, and his powers enable him to establish [[agriculture]], [[urbanisation]], and the first [[State (polity)|state]]: Pangea. One of his descendants is King D\u00edmon. D\u00edmon's first love dies in childbirth, after begetting Hrafntinna. D\u00edmon, overcome by sorrow and rage, is convinced by a mysterious [[accountant]] called [[Microsoft Excel|Exel]] to use his power over animals to conquer the world in the name of his new daughter.\n\nHrafntinna grows up seeing little of her warring father; she is prevented by her status and court custom from making friends, and is unaware of her father's megalomania and tyranny. The situation is exacerbated when D\u00edmon completes his conquest of Pangea, only to realise that he cannot conquer time. He offers half his kingdom to anyone who enables him to conquer time and preserve Hrafntinna's beauty. The challenge is met by a group of dwarves, among the last survivors of a genocidal war by D\u00edmon's father. They present D\u00edmon with a chest made from [[Spider silk|spiders' silk]] through which time cannot penetrate. Hrafntinna is put inside and is only allowed out occasionally, staying the same age as others age around her.\n\n[[File:Pangea animation 03.gif|thumb|right|Animation of the historical rifting of Pangaea]]\nDecapitating the dwarves, D\u00edmon accidentally cuts Pangea in two, losing half his kingdom. He sets off to reconquer it. In the King's absence, his second wife Gunnhildur and a self-appointed monk, \u00cdgull K\u00f3rall, use the unwitting Hrafntinna to establish a [[cult]] of the 'immortal princess', using her to [[Opium of the people|control their people]]. Hrafntinna is visited by a would-be thief, the child K\u00e1ri, who opens the time-chest, becomes Hrafntinna's first and only friend, and secretly visits her once a month; the two fall in love.\n\nEventually, Gunnhildur and \u00cdgull plot to murder Hrafntinna. K\u00e1ri and D\u00edmon independently try to save her, K\u00e1ri shooting Gunnhildur and D\u00edmon \u00cdgull. However, D\u00edmon's arrow passes through \u00cdgull and enters Hrafntinna's heart. The time-chest preserves Hrafntinna's life just at the point of death. D\u00edmon is killed by a popular revolt; K\u00e1ri spends his life making another time-chest for himself in the hope of joining Hrafntinna in the future; and the city is abandoned.\n\nHrafntinna is rediscovered in the modern era by an archaeologist/treasure-hunter, Jakob Cromwell, and saved from death by modern medicine. Jakob discovers the secret of the time-chest, founds the company T\u00edmax, and mass-produces his own time-boxes, leading adults to shun responsibility for their children and their society by simply waiting for bad times to pass, with terrible consequences.\n\nHaving learned the cause of their predicament from Hrafntinna/Svala, Sigr\u00fan and her friends find Cromwell and release the spiders which made the time-boxes; the spiders eat the boxes and human society is revived. The story ends with Svala/Hrafntinna finding K\u00e1ri's time-chest and at last meeting her lost love.\n\n==Criticism==\n\nThe novel draws inspiration from folk- and fairy-tales (prominently ''[[Snow White]]'') and medieval Icelandic [[legendary saga]]s.<ref>Vera Kn\u00fatsd\u00f3ttir, 'S\u00e1 sem sigrar t\u00edmann mun glata heiminum', ''B\u00f3kmenntir.is'', December 2013, http://bokmenntir.is/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-3409/5777_read-37814.; Dagn\u00fd Kristj\u00e1nsd\u00f3ttir, 'Nominert til nordisk pris: Den som vinner tiden \u2013 taper verden', ''Barnebokkritikk'', http://www.barnebokkritikk.no/nominert-til-nordisk-pris-den-som-vinner-tiden-taper-verden.</ref> In the assessment of Dagn\u00fd Kristj\u00e1nsd\u00f3ttir, the novel is characterised by environmentalism, in its message that human interventions in the natural order have bad results; perversions of power, particularly in [[late capitalism]]; the manipulation of popular opinion through religion, propaganda, and marketing; and the problematisation of ideas of childhood innocence.<ref name=\"barnebokkritikk1\">Dagn\u00fd Kristj\u00e1nsd\u00f3ttir, 'Nominert til nordisk pris: Den som vinner tiden \u2013 taper verden', ''Barnebokkritikk'', http://www.barnebokkritikk.no/nominert-til-nordisk-pris-den-som-vinner-tiden-taper-verden.

''Bajaga and the Instructors'') are a [[Serbia]]n and [[SFRY|former Yugoslav]] [[Rock music|rock]] band. Founded in [[Belgrade]] in 1984 by [[composer]], [[lyricist]] and [[guitarist]] [[Mom\u010dilo Bajagi\u0107|Mom\u010dilo Bajagi\u0107 \"Bajaga\"]], the group possesses a rich discography and a plethora of hit songs that placed them at the top of the [[SFR Yugoslav Pop Rock scene|former Yugoslav rock scene]], alongside other mega-selling bands such as [[Bijelo Dugme]] and [[Riblja \u010corba]].\n\n==History==\n===1980s===\nThe band's history begins in 1983. At the time [[Mom\u010dilo Bajagi\u0107|Mom\u010dilo Bajagi\u0107 \"Bajaga\"]] was the guitarist for the [[hard rock]] band [[Riblja \u010corba]]. During his work with Riblja \u010corba, Bajagi\u0107 wrote music and both music and lyrics for several Riblja \u010corba hits, but also wrote a large number of humorous [[Pop music|pop]]-oriented songs that did not fit into Riblja \u010corba's sound. He decided to release these songs on a solo album, and he started working on the album with a group of [[Belgrade]] musicians: vocalist [[Dejan Cuki\u0107]] (a former Dizel, Tilt, and [[Bulevar (band)|Bulevar]] member, and at the time a journalist working in the magazine ''[[Rock (magazine)|Rock]]''), bass guitarist [[Miroslav Cvetkovi\u0107|Miroslav Cvetkovi\u0107 \"Cvele\"]] (a former Tilt, [[Pop Ma\u0161ina]], and Papatra member), guitarist Nenad Stamatovi\u0107 (a former Tilt, [[Zebra (Yugoslav band)|Zebra]], [[Suncokret]], and Bulevar member), and drummer [[Vladimir Golubovi\u0107 (musician)|Vladimir Golubovi\u0107]] (a former Tilt and Suncokret member, at the time temporarily replacing [[Vicko Milatovi\u0107]] in Riblja \u010corba).\n\nDuring the work on the album, Bajagi\u0107 wanted only to record a large number of songs he wrote on an album and to remain a member of Riblja \u010corba. The songs for the album were recorded in a rented apartment and in [[Radio Television Belgrade]] Studio V and produced by [[Kornelije Kova\u010d]].<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.discogs.com/Bajaga-Pozitivna-Geografija/release/1050919 ''Pozitivna geografija'' at Discogs]</ref> The album, beside mentioned musicians, featured Nenad Stefanovi\u0107 \"Japanac\" on bass guitar, a former [[Generacija 5]] member Dragan \"Krle\" Jovanovi\u0107 on guitar, Kire Mitrev on [[trombone]], Ivan \u0160vager on [[clarinet]], and [[Suzana Petri\u010devi\u0107]] on vocals in the song \"Papaline\" (\"[[Sprats]]\").<ref name=autogenerated2 /> The album, entitled ''[[Pozitivna geografija]]'' (''Positive Geography'') was released at the end of January 1984 and was well received by the audience, bringing hits \"Berlin\", \"Mali slonovi\" (\"Little Elephants\"), \"Poljubi me\" (\"Kiss Me\"), \"Limene trube\" (\"Brass Trumpets\"), \"Tekila gerila\" (\"Tequila Guerrilla\"), \"Marlena\", and \"Tamara\". The album also featured the [[anti-drug]] song \"Znam \u010doveka\" (\"I Know a Man\"), dedicated to Dragan \u0110eri\u0107 \"\u0110era\", Bajagi\u0107's former bandmate from the bands Ofi and Glogov Kolac. Initially, Bajagi\u0107 had no intention of promoting ''Pozitivna geografija'' in concert, but eventually decided to listen to the advice of some and hold several concerts. Bajagi\u0107 and musicians working on the album held their first concert in [[Zagreb]] club [[Kulu\u0161i\u0107]] on April 12, 1984.<ref>[http://www.muzika.hr/clanak/5873/najave/koncert-bajage-i-instruktora-u-splitu.aspx Koncert Bajage i Instruktora u Splitu, Muzika.hr]</ref> Beside the musicians that worked on the album, the concert also featured vocalist [[\u017dika Milenkovi\u0107 (musician)|\u017dika Milenkovi\u0107]] (Bajagi\u0107's former bandmate from the band Ofi, and a former Ma\u010dori member and an actor in the [[amateur theatre]] Teatar levo), keyboardist Dragan Mitri\u0107 (a former Bulevar member) and Kornelije Kova\u010d, Milenkovi\u0107 soon becoming an official member of the band.<ref>[http://www.popboks.com/tekst.php?ID=9116 \"Dejan Cuki\u0107: Dok se jo\u0161 se\u0107am - Mljet\", popboks.com]</ref> During their staying in Zagreb Bajagi\u0107 and Cuki\u0107 appeared as guests on the recording of [[Parni Valjak]] album ''Uhvati ritam'', singing backing vocals on the title track,<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Parni-Valjak-Uhvati-Ritam/release/1539321 ''Uhvati ritam'' at Discogs]</ref> which was the sign of gratitude to Parni Valjak for lending them a piece of drum kit for their first concert. The band held the official album promotion, organized by the ''[[Rock (magazine)|Rock]]'' magazine, in Belgrade [[Dom Sindikata]] on April 21, and on this concert the band appeared under the name Bajaga i Instruktori, chosen after the idea of the journalist [[Peca Popovi\u0107]], for the first time. The concert featured [[Valentino (band)|Valentino]] and [[Bezobrazno Zeleno]] as the opening bands. The concert was well visited (mostly by teenagers) and the band's performance was well received.\n\nThe success of Bajagi\u0107's solo album caused conflicts inside Riblja \u010corba, and on July 19, 1984, he was excluded from the band. During that summer Bajaga i Instruktori went on a tour, with [[Rade Radivojevi\u0107]] on keyboards, playing mostly at [[youth work actions]]. At the end of the year, in the ''Rock'' magazine, Bajagi\u0107 was proclaimed the Rock Musician of the Year, and ''Pozitivna geografija'' was voted the Album of the Year by musicians. At the beginning of 1985, the band recorded the album ''[[Sa druge strane jastuka]]'' (''On the Other Side of the Pillow''), produced by Kornelije Kova\u010d and [[Sa\u0161a Habi\u0107]]. The album featured a large number of guests: Branko Ma\u010di\u0107 on [[jazz guitar]], [[Stjepko Gut]] on [[trumpet]] and [[flugelhorn]], Sava Medan on [[double bass]], [[Jovan Maljokovi\u0107]] on saxophone, Mi\u0107a Markovi\u0107 on saxophone, Nenad Stefanovi\u0107 \"Japanac\" on bass guitar, Dragan \"Krle\" Jovanovi\u0107 on guitar, and others.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Bajaga-I-Instruktori-Sa-Druge-Strane-Jastuka/release/1625326 ''Sa druge strane jastuka'' at Discogs]</ref> The album brought hits \"220 u voltima\" (\"220 Volt\"), \"Vidi \u0161ta mi je uradio od pesme, mama\" (a [[Serbian language]] cover of the [[Melanie Safka]] song \"Look What They've Done to My Song Ma\"), \"Ti se ljubi\u0161 (Na tako dobar na\u010din)\" (\"You Kiss (In a great Manner)\"), \"Dvadeseti vek\" (\"Twentieth Century\"), and ballads \"Dobro jutro, d\u017eezeri\" (\"Good Morning, Jazzers\"), \"Sa druge strane jastuka\" and \"Za\u017emuri\" (\"Close Your Eyes\"). The album was promoted with a 7 inch vinyl which on its B-side has a track with software for ZX Spectrum titled \"Kompjuterska informacija za Sinclair Spectrum\". For the first time Milenkovi\u0107 was an author of a song, co-writing the song \"Francuska ljubavna revolucija\" (\"French Love Revolution\") with Bajagi\u0107. At this time the band's manager became a former [[U \u0160kripcu]] manager Sa\u0161a Dragi\u0107.\n\n[[File:BijeloDugmeandBajagaiInstruktoriMoscow.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Members of Bajaga i Instruktori and [[Bijelo Dugme]] together in [[Moscow]] July 1985.]]\nIn March, Bajaga i Instruktori presented their new songs to the Zagreb audience in Kulu\u0161i\u0107, as a part of the ''BG-ZG: Bolje vas na\u0161li'' action. Several days later, in the night between March 9 and 10, they performed in [[Toulouse]] on the Night of Mediterranean Rock. Although they performed around 4:00 AM, they were well received and performed three encores. After this concert Rade Radivojevi\u0107 left the band, and was replaced by a former Potop and [[Galija]] member [[Sa\u0161a Lokner]]. The band went on a successful Yugoslav tour, on which they held two concerts on [[Ta\u0161majdan Sports Centre#Ta\u0161majdan Stadium|Ta\u0161majdan Stadium]], on June 8 and 9. In May 1985, Bajagi\u0107 and Cuki\u0107 took a part in [[YU Rock Misija]], a Yugoslav contribution to [[Live Aid]], and on June 15, Bajaga i Instruktori performed on the YU Rock Misija concert held on the [[Red Star Stadium]]. In the autumn of 1985, Bajaga i Instruktori and [[Bijelo Dugme]] performed on the [[Moscow]] Festival of Youth and Students, as a part of Yugoslav delegation. Bajaga i Instruktori performed in the [[Gorky Park (Moscow)|Gorky Park]] in front of about 100,000 people, and, as there was a serious risk of attendants getting hurt, the concert was interrupted. During the following days the band performed in the Moscow Dinamo Hall, Green Theatre (with the bands [[Misty in Roots]] and [[Everything but the Girl]]), Pioneers Home, and [[Vakhtangov Theatre]]. After they returned to Yugoslavia they continued their tour on which they held more than 120 concerts. The band also performed on the rock evening of the Intertalent Festival in [[Prague]]. At the end of 1985, in the magazine ''Rock'', Bajaga i Instruktori were voted by the critics the Rock Band of the Year, Bajagi\u0107 the Rock Musician of the Year, \"Za\u017emuri\" the Song of the Year, and ''Sa druge strane jastuka'' the Album of the Year. The album was sold in more than 350,000 copies, and the band was awarded with the May 25 award by the [[League of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia]]. The band went on a break during which Lokner and Golubovi\u0107 performed in [[jazz]] clubs with jazz musicians Stjepko Gut (trumpet), Mi\u0161a Krsti\u0107 (piano), and Nenad Petrovi\u0107 (saxophone).\n\nIn the summer of 1986, the band members reunited to record the album ''[[Jaha\u010di magle]]'' (''Fog Riders'').

The single was printed in 99,999 copies. After the single release, the album was released, bringing hits \"Ja mislim 300 na sat\", \"442 do Beograda\" (\"442 to Belgrade\"), with a bass guitar [[riff]] written by Bo\u017eani\u0107, \"Bam, Bam, Bam\", \"Rimljani\" (\"Romans\"), and Milenkovi\u0107's \"Samo nam je ljubav potrebna\" (\"All We Need Is Love\"). The band went on a successful tour, which ended with a concert held at Belgrade's [[Staro Sajmi\u0161te|Sajmi\u0161te]] on November 22, 1986, in front of about 20,000 visitors. After the end of a tour the band made a break once again. Bajagi\u0107 travelled to [[Thailand]], and in June 1987 Cuki\u0107 released his first solo album ''Spori ritam'' (''Slow Rhythm''). After that, Bajaga i Instruktori went on a two-month [[Soviet Union]] tour, during which they held 42 concerts. After they returned to Yugoslavia, Cuki\u0107 left Bajaga i Instruktori conventionally and formed his Spori Ritam Band.\n\nBajaga i Instruktori recorded their following album ''[[Prodavnica tajni]]'' (''The Shop of Secrets'') in 1988 in [[Novi Sad]]. The album, named after [[Dino Buzzati]] book ''La boutique del mistero'', (the songs, however, had no connection with the book),<ref>[http://www.popboks.com/vest.php?ID=8686 \"20 godina Prodavnice tajni\", popboks.com]</ref> was produced by Sa\u0161a Habi\u0107.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Bajaga-I-Instruktori-Prodavnica-Tajni/release/1159860 ''Prodavnica tajni'' at Discogs]</ref> Milenkovi\u0107 co-wrote the songs \"Ruski voz\" (\"Russian Train\"), \"\u017divot je nekad siv, nekad \u017eut\" (\"Life Is Sometimes Grey and Sometimes Yellow\"), and \"Vesela pesma\" (\"Merry Song\"). The album marked a slight stylistic change in the band's sound: the songs were simpler, without brass instruments, frequent on the band's previous releases, based on [[acoustic guitars]] and keyboards, and the songs \"Plavi safir\" (\"Blue [[Sapphire]]\"), \"Vesela pesma\", \"\u017divot je nekad siv, nekad \u017eut\" and \"Ruski voz\" featured [[folk music]] elements. However, virtually every song on the album became a hit. The band went on another successful tour, during which they recorded the double live/compilation album ''[[Neka svemir \u010duje nemir]]'' (''May the Universe Hear the Unrest''). The album featured new songs \"Na vrhovima prstiju\" (\"On the Tips of Your Toes\"), \"Idem (Kao da ne idem, a idem)\" (\"I'm Going (Like I'm not Going, but I'm Going\"), which is the first Bajaga i Instruktori song sung entirely by Milenkovi\u0107, and \"Neka svemir \u010duje nemir\", which is a cover of a [[traditional music|traditional]] [[India]]n song, and [[acoustic music|acoustic]] studio versions of \"Tamara\" and \"Tekila gerila\". The live recordings were made during the band's concerts in Zagreb's [[Dom Sportova]], held on March 6, 1989, and from Novi Sad EBU Rock Festival, and also a recording of the journalist [[Dra\u017een Vrdoljak]] announcing the band on their concert in Kulu\u0161i\u0107, held on December 8, 1984.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Bajaga-Instruktori-Neka-Svemir-\u010cuje-Nemir/release/1943671 ''Neka svemir \u010duje nemir'' at Discogs]</ref> The album also featured a live version of the song \"[[Kad hoda\u0161]]\", written by Bajagi\u0107 and originally recorded by Riblja \u010corba. During the tour that followed the album release the band held two sold out concerts in Belgrade's [[Pionir Hall]]. Despite the growing [[nationalism]] the band was well accepted in all parts of Yugoslavia. The only incident on the tour happened in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], where the fans of the football club [[Hajduk Split]] threw various objects on the stage, but after the intervention of the security the concert was continued. At the beginning of 1990, Bajaga i Instruktori, [[Riblja \u010corba]], [[Valentino (band)|Valentino]], [[Viktorija]] and [[Galija]], performed in [[Timi\u0219oara]], [[Romania]], at the three-day concerts organized two months after the [[Romanian Revolution]].

During the same year Milenkovi\u0107, with [[Elektri\u010dni Orgazam]] member [[Goran \u010cavajda]], Riblja \u010corba member [[Zoran Ili\u0107]], and a former [[Bezobrazno Zeleno]] member Bojan Vasi\u0107, formed the band [[Babe (Serbian band)|Babe]]. In 1993 Bajaga i Instruktori released the album ''[[Muzika na struju]]'' (''Electric Music''). The song \"Marinina tema\" (\"Marina's Theme\") was written for the [[theatre play]] ''\u017divot Jovanov'' (''Life of Jovan'') directed by [[Darko Baji\u0107]], and the [[Theme (music)|theme]] \"Nakostre\u0161ena ma\u010dka\" (\"Bristled Cat\") was written by Milenkovi\u0107. The [[anti-war]] ballad \"Golubica\" (\"Dove\") featured [[Aleksandra Kova\u010d|Aleksandra]] and [[Kristina Kova\u010d]], [[Oktobar 1864]] vocalist [[Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107]] and [[Marija Mihajlovi\u0107]] on backing vocals. The song was based on the instrumental Bajagi\u0107 played at [[Terazije|Terazijska \u010desma]] during the [[March 9, 1991 protest]]. Beside \"Golubica\", the album featured anti-war songs \"Gde si\" (\"Where Are You\") and \"Ovo je Balkan\" (\"This Is the [[Balkans]]\"). The album was promoted on concerts in [[Montenegro]] and Macedonia, and on a sold out concert in Belgrade's [[Hala sportova]]. At this time Bajagi\u0107 started performing alone in the clubs abroad.\n\nAt the beginning of 1994, Bajaga i Instruktori planned to perform in Slovenia, and there was a huge interest by the audience for these concerts. However, Slovenian authorities refused to issue [[Visa (document)|visas]] to the band, which caused a scandal in Slovenian media. After the intervention of the Slovenian president [[Milan Ku\u010dan]], visas were issued to the members of the band, and they performed several concerts including a sold out concert in the [[Tivoli Hall]]. In March 1994 the band held three concerts in Belgrade's Dom Sindikata, with which they celebrated ten years of existence. After these concerts Bajagi\u0107 and Dragi\u0107 ended their cooperation. For a certain time, manager duties were carried on by Bajagi\u0107, before Zoran Vulovi\u0107, a former [[U \u0160kripcu]] keyboardist, became the band's new manager. In November 1994, after a concert in [[Pri\u0161tina]], came to conflicts inside the band, and Bajagi\u0107 excluded Stamatovi\u0107 and Golubovi\u0107 from the band, which ended Bajaga i Instruktori activity. At the time Bajagi\u0107, with Lokner, wrote music for [[Mi\u0161a Radivojevi\u0107]]'s film ''Ni na nebu ni na zemlji'' (''Neither on the Sky nor on the Earth''). The recordings featured members of the [[starogradska muzika]] band [[Legende (band)|Legende]] (in the hit song \"Moji drugovi\"), Dragan Jovanovi\u0107 on acoustic guitar, Sava Latinovi\u0107 on [[tarabuka]], and Aleksandra and Kristina Kova\u010d on backing vocals. The music was released on the album ''[[Ni na nebu ni na zemlji (album)|Ni na nebu ni na zemlji]]''. During the same year Bajagi\u0107 wrote music for the TV show ''[[Otvorena vrata]]'' (''Opened Door'').\n\nIn 1996, Bajagi\u0107 reformed Bajaga i Instruktori. The new lineup featured, beside Bajagi\u0107, Milenkovi\u0107, Cvetkovi\u0107, and Lokner, the guitarist [[Vlada Negovanovi\u0107]] (a former Butik, [[Doktor Spira i Ljudska Bi\u0107a]], [[Sla\u0111ana Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]'s backing band, [[Tunel (band)|Tunel]], and Dejan Cuki\u0107's Spori Ritam Band member), and the drummer [[\u010ceda Macura]] (a former [[Neverne Bebe]], [[Viktorija]]'s backing band, [[Legija]] and [[Revolveri]] member). At the end of 1996 the band recorded the album ''[[Od bi\u017euterije do \u0107ilibara]]'' (''From [[Bijouterie]] to [[Amber]]''). Bajagi\u0107 wrote all the songs, except \"Ne volim zimu\" (\"I Don't Like Winter\"), featuring music written by Milenkovi\u0107.

Founded in [[Belgrade]] in 1984 by [[composer]], [[lyricist]] and [[guitarist]] [[Mom\u010dilo Bajagi\u0107|Mom\u010dilo Bajagi\u0107 \"Bajaga\"]], the group possesses a rich discography and a plethora of hit songs that placed them at the top of the [[SFR Yugoslav Pop Rock scene|former Yugoslav rock scene]], alongside other mega-selling bands such as [[Bijelo Dugme]] and [[Riblja \u010corba]].\n\n==History==\n===1980s===\nThe band's history begins in 1983. At the time [[Mom\u010dilo Bajagi\u0107|Mom\u010dilo Bajagi\u0107 \"Bajaga\"]] was the guitarist for the [[hard rock]] band [[Riblja \u010corba]]. During his work with Riblja \u010corba, Bajagi\u0107 wrote music and both music and lyrics for several Riblja \u010corba hits, but also wrote a large number of humorous [[Pop music|pop]]-oriented songs that did not fit into Riblja \u010corba's sound. He decided to release these songs on a solo album, and he started working on the album with a group of [[Belgrade]] musicians: vocalist [[Dejan Cuki\u0107]] (a former Dizel, Tilt, and [[Bulevar (band)|Bulevar]] member, and at the time a journalist working in the magazine ''[[Rock (magazine)|Rock]]''), bass guitarist [[Miroslav Cvetkovi\u0107|Miroslav Cvetkovi\u0107 \"Cvele\"]] (a former Tilt, [[Pop Ma\u0161ina]], and Papatra member), guitarist Nenad Stamatovi\u0107 (a former Tilt, [[Zebra (Yugoslav band)|Zebra]], [[Suncokret]], and Bulevar member), and drummer [[Vladimir Golubovi\u0107 (musician)|Vladimir Golubovi\u0107]] (a former Tilt and Suncokret member, at the time temporarily replacing [[Vicko Milatovi\u0107]] in Riblja \u010corba).\n\nDuring the work on the album, Bajagi\u0107 wanted only to record a large number of songs he wrote on an album and to remain a member of Riblja \u010corba. The songs for the album were recorded in a rented apartment and in [[Radio Television Belgrade]] Studio V and produced by [[Kornelije Kova\u010d]].<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.discogs.com/Bajaga-Pozitivna-Geografija/release/1050919 ''Pozitivna geografija'' at Discogs]</ref> The album, beside mentioned musicians, featured Nenad Stefanovi\u0107 \"Japanac\" on bass guitar, a former [[Generacija 5]] member Dragan \"Krle\" Jovanovi\u0107 on guitar, Kire Mitrev on [[trombone]], Ivan \u0160vager on [[clarinet]], and [[Suzana Petri\u010devi\u0107]] on vocals in the song \"Papaline\" (\"[[Sprats]]\").<ref name=autogenerated2 /> The album, entitled ''[[Pozitivna geografija]]'' (''Positive Geography'') was released at the end of January 1984 and was well received by the audience, bringing hits \"Berlin\", \"Mali slonovi\" (\"Little Elephants\"), \"Poljubi me\" (\"Kiss Me\"), \"Limene trube\" (\"Brass Trumpets\"), \"Tekila gerila\" (\"Tequila Guerrilla\"), \"Marlena\", and \"Tamara\".

Initially, Bajagi\u0107 had no intention of promoting ''Pozitivna geografija'' in concert, but eventually decided to listen to the advice of some and hold several concerts. Bajagi\u0107 and musicians working on the album held their first concert in [[Zagreb]] club [[Kulu\u0161i\u0107]] on April 12, 1984.<ref>[http://www.muzika.hr/clanak/5873/najave/koncert-bajage-i-instruktora-u-splitu.aspx Koncert Bajage i Instruktora u Splitu, Muzika.hr]</ref> Beside the musicians that worked on the album, the concert also featured vocalist [[\u017dika Milenkovi\u0107 (musician)|\u017dika Milenkovi\u0107]] (Bajagi\u0107's former bandmate from the band Ofi, and a former Ma\u010dori member and an actor in the [[amateur theatre]] Teatar levo), keyboardist Dragan Mitri\u0107 (a former Bulevar member) and Kornelije Kova\u010d, Milenkovi\u0107 soon becoming an official member of the band.<ref>[http://www.popboks.com/tekst.php?ID=9116 \"Dejan Cuki\u0107: Dok se jo\u0161 se\u0107am - Mljet\", popboks.com]</ref> During their staying in Zagreb Bajagi\u0107 and Cuki\u0107 appeared as guests on the recording of [[Parni Valjak]] album ''Uhvati ritam'', singing backing vocals on the title track,<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Parni-Valjak-Uhvati-Ritam/release/1539321 ''Uhvati ritam'' at Discogs]</ref> which was the sign of gratitude to Parni Valjak for lending them a piece of drum kit for their first concert. The band held the official album promotion, organized by the ''[[Rock (magazine)|Rock]]'' magazine, in Belgrade [[Dom Sindikata]] on April 21, and on this concert the band appeared under the name Bajaga i Instruktori, chosen after the idea of the journalist [[Peca Popovi\u0107]], for the first time. The concert featured [[Valentino (band)|Valentino]] and [[Bezobrazno Zeleno]] as the opening bands. The concert was well visited (mostly by teenagers) and the band's performance was well received.\n\nThe success of Bajagi\u0107's solo album caused conflicts inside Riblja \u010corba, and on July 19, 1984, he was excluded from the band. During that summer Bajaga i Instruktori went on a tour, with [[Rade Radivojevi\u0107]] on keyboards, playing mostly at [[youth work actions]]. At the end of the year, in the ''Rock'' magazine, Bajagi\u0107 was proclaimed the Rock Musician of the Year, and ''Pozitivna geografija'' was voted the Album of the Year by musicians. At the beginning of 1985, the band recorded the album ''[[Sa druge strane jastuka]]'' (''On the Other Side of the Pillow''), produced by Kornelije Kova\u010d and [[Sa\u0161a Habi\u0107]].

The album was promoted with a 7 inch vinyl which on its B-side has a track with software for ZX Spectrum titled \"Kompjuterska informacija za Sinclair Spectrum\". For the first time Milenkovi\u0107 was an author of a song, co-writing the song \"Francuska ljubavna revolucija\" (\"French Love Revolution\") with Bajagi\u0107. At this time the band's manager became a former [[U \u0160kripcu]] manager Sa\u0161a Dragi\u0107.\n\n[[File:BijeloDugmeandBajagaiInstruktoriMoscow.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Members of Bajaga i Instruktori and [[Bijelo Dugme]] together in [[Moscow]] July 1985.]]\nIn March, Bajaga i Instruktori presented their new songs to the Zagreb audience in Kulu\u0161i\u0107, as a part of the ''BG-ZG: Bolje vas na\u0161li'' action. Several days later, in the night between March 9 and 10, they performed in [[Toulouse]] on the Night of Mediterranean Rock. Although they performed around 4:00 AM, they were well received and performed three encores. After this concert Rade Radivojevi\u0107 left the band, and was replaced by a former Potop and [[Galija]] member [[Sa\u0161a Lokner]]. The band went on a successful Yugoslav tour, on which they held two concerts on [[Ta\u0161majdan Sports Centre#Ta\u0161majdan Stadium|Ta\u0161majdan Stadium]], on June 8 and 9. In May 1985, Bajagi\u0107 and Cuki\u0107 took a part in [[YU Rock Misija]], a Yugoslav contribution to [[Live Aid]], and on June 15, Bajaga i Instruktori performed on the YU Rock Misija concert held on the [[Red Star Stadium]]. In the autumn of 1985, Bajaga i Instruktori and [[Bijelo Dugme]] performed on the [[Moscow]] Festival of Youth and Students, as a part of Yugoslav delegation. Bajaga i Instruktori performed in the [[Gorky Park (Moscow)|Gorky Park]] in front of about 100,000 people, and, as there was a serious risk of attendants getting hurt, the concert was interrupted. During the following days the band performed in the Moscow Dinamo Hall, Green Theatre (with the bands [[Misty in Roots]] and [[Everything but the Girl]]), Pioneers Home, and [[Vakhtangov Theatre]]. After they returned to Yugoslavia they continued their tour on which they held more than 120 concerts. The band also performed on the rock evening of the Intertalent Festival in [[Prague]]. At the end of 1985, in the magazine ''Rock'', Bajaga i Instruktori were voted by the critics the Rock Band of the Year, Bajagi\u0107 the Rock Musician of the Year, \"Za\u017emuri\" the Song of the Year, and ''Sa druge strane jastuka'' the Album of the Year. The album was sold in more than 350,000 copies, and the band was awarded with the May 25 award by the [[League of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia]]. The band went on a break during which Lokner and Golubovi\u0107 performed in [[jazz]] clubs with jazz musicians Stjepko Gut (trumpet), Mi\u0161a Krsti\u0107 (piano), and Nenad Petrovi\u0107 (saxophone).\n\nIn the summer of 1986, the band members reunited to record the album ''[[Jaha\u010di magle]]'' (''Fog Riders'').

The band went on a successful tour, which ended with a concert held at Belgrade's [[Staro Sajmi\u0161te|Sajmi\u0161te]] on November 22, 1986, in front of about 20,000 visitors. After the end of a tour the band made a break once again. Bajagi\u0107 travelled to [[Thailand]], and in June 1987 Cuki\u0107 released his first solo album ''Spori ritam'' (''Slow Rhythm''). After that, Bajaga i Instruktori went on a two-month [[Soviet Union]] tour, during which they held 42 concerts. After they returned to Yugoslavia, Cuki\u0107 left Bajaga i Instruktori conventionally and formed his Spori Ritam Band.\n\nBajaga i Instruktori recorded their following album ''[[Prodavnica tajni]]'' (''The Shop of Secrets'') in 1988 in [[Novi Sad]]. The album, named after [[Dino Buzzati]] book ''La boutique del mistero'', (the songs, however, had no connection with the book),<ref>[http://www.popboks.com/vest.php?ID=8686 \"20 godina Prodavnice tajni\", popboks.com]</ref> was produced by Sa\u0161a Habi\u0107.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Bajaga-I-Instruktori-Prodavnica-Tajni/release/1159860 ''Prodavnica tajni'' at Discogs]</ref> Milenkovi\u0107 co-wrote the songs \"Ruski voz\" (\"Russian Train\"), \"\u017divot je nekad siv, nekad \u017eut\" (\"Life Is Sometimes Grey and Sometimes Yellow\"), and \"Vesela pesma\" (\"Merry Song\"). The album marked a slight stylistic change in the band's sound: the songs were simpler, without brass instruments, frequent on the band's previous releases, based on [[acoustic guitars]] and keyboards, and the songs \"Plavi safir\" (\"Blue [[Sapphire]]\"), \"Vesela pesma\", \"\u017divot je nekad siv, nekad \u017eut\" and \"Ruski voz\" featured [[folk music]] elements. However, virtually every song on the album became a hit. The band went on another successful tour, during which they recorded the double live/compilation album ''[[Neka svemir \u010duje nemir]]'' (''May the Universe Hear the Unrest''). The album featured new songs \"Na vrhovima prstiju\" (\"On the Tips of Your Toes\"), \"Idem (Kao da ne idem, a idem)\" (\"I'm Going (Like I'm not Going, but I'm Going\"), which is the first Bajaga i Instruktori song sung entirely by Milenkovi\u0107, and \"Neka svemir \u010duje nemir\", which is a cover of a [[traditional music|traditional]] [[India]]n song, and [[acoustic music|acoustic]] studio versions of \"Tamara\" and \"Tekila gerila\".

During the tour that followed the album release the band held two sold out concerts in Belgrade's [[Pionir Hall]]. Despite the growing [[nationalism]] the band was well accepted in all parts of Yugoslavia. The only incident on the tour happened in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], where the fans of the football club [[Hajduk Split]] threw various objects on the stage, but after the intervention of the security the concert was continued. At the beginning of 1990, Bajaga i Instruktori, [[Riblja \u010corba]], [[Valentino (band)|Valentino]], [[Viktorija]] and [[Galija]], performed in [[Timi\u015foara]], [[Romania]], at the three-day concerts organized two months after the [[Romanian Revolution]].

During the same year Milenkovi\u0107, with [[Elektri\u010dni Orgazam]] member [[Goran \u010cavajda]], Riblja \u010corba member [[Zoran Ili\u0107]], and a former [[Bezobrazno Zeleno]] member Bojan Vasi\u0107, formed the band [[Babe (Serbian band)|Babe]]. In 1993 Bajaga i Instruktori released the album ''[[Muzika na struju]]'' (''Electric Music''). The song \"Marinina tema\" (\"Marina's Theme\") was written for the [[theatre play]] ''\u017divot Jovanov'' (''Life of Jovan'') directed by [[Darko Baji\u0107]], and the [[Theme (music)|theme]] \"Nakostre\u0161ena ma\u010dka\" (\"Bristled Cat\") was written by Milenkovi\u0107. The [[anti-war]] ballad \"Golubica\" (\"Dove\") featured [[Aleksandra Kova\u010d|Aleksandra]] and [[Kristina Kova\u010d]], [[Oktobar 1864]] vocalist [[Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107]] and [[Marija Mihajlovi\u0107]] on backing vocals. The song was based on the instrumental Bajagi\u0107 played at [[Terazije|Terazijska \u010desma]] during the [[March 9, 1991 protest]]. Beside \"Golubica\", the album featured anti-war songs \"Gde si\" (\"Where Are You\") and \"Ovo je Balkan\" (\"This Is the [[Balkans]]\"). The album was promoted on concerts in [[Montenegro]] and Macedonia, and on a sold out concert in Belgrade's [[Hala sportova]]. At this time Bajagi\u0107 started performing alone in the clubs abroad.\n\nAt the beginning of 1994, Bajaga i Instruktori planned to perform in Slovenia, and there was a huge interest by the audience for these concerts. However, Slovenian authorities refused to issue [[Visa (document)|visas]] to the band, which caused a scandal in Slovenian media. After the intervention of the Slovenian president [[Milan Ku\u010dan]], visas were issued to the members of the band, and they performed several concerts including a sold out concert in the [[Tivoli Hall]]. In March 1994 the band held three concerts in Belgrade's Dom Sindikata, with which they celebrated ten years of existence. After these concerts Bajagi\u0107 and Dragi\u0107 ended their cooperation. For a certain time, manager duties were carried on by Bajagi\u0107, before Zoran Vulovi\u0107, a former [[U \u0160kripcu]] keyboardist, became the band's new manager. In November 1994, after a concert in [[Pri\u0161tina]], came to conflicts inside the band, and Bajagi\u0107 excluded Stamatovi\u0107 and Golubovi\u0107 from the band, which ended Bajaga i Instruktori activity. At the time Bajagi\u0107, with Lokner, wrote music for [[Mi\u0161a Radivojevi\u0107]]'s film ''Ni na nebu ni na zemlji'' (''Neither on the Sky nor on the Earth''). The recordings featured members of the [[starogradska muzika]] band [[Legende (band)|Legende]] (in the hit song \"Moji drugovi\"), Dragan Jovanovi\u0107 on acoustic guitar, Sava Latinovi\u0107 on [[tarabuka]], and Aleksandra and Kristina Kova\u010d on backing vocals. The music was released on the album ''[[Ni na nebu ni na zemlji (album)|Ni na nebu ni na zemlji]]''. During the same year Bajagi\u0107 wrote music for the TV show ''[[Otvorena vrata]]'' (''Opened Door'').\n\nIn 1996, Bajagi\u0107 reformed Bajaga i Instruktori. The new lineup featured, beside Bajagi\u0107, Milenkovi\u0107, Cvetkovi\u0107, and Lokner, the guitarist [[Vlada Negovanovi\u0107]] (a former Butik, [[Doktor Spira i Ljudska Bi\u0107a]], [[Sla\u0111ana Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]'s backing band, [[Tunel (band)|Tunel]], and Dejan Cuki\u0107's Spori Ritam Band member), and the drummer [[\u010ceda Macura]] (a former [[Neverne Bebe]], [[Viktorija]]'s backing band, [[Legija]] and [[Revolveri]] member).
