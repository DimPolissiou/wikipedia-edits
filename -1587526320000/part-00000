In the seventeenth century it became part of the colonial province of [[New Netherland]], the [[patroon]]ship [[Pavonia, New Netherland|Pavonia]]. The area was known as ''Jan the Lacher's Hook'', so called for the man who was the [[Homestead (buildings)|bowery's]] second superintendent, [[Jan Everts Bout]]. For many years, the village, often referred to by [[Washington Irving]], existed where the [[Liberty Science Center]] now stands. For hundreds of years it was a [[ferry]] port for local communities of [[Bergen, New Netherland|Bergen]], [[Bergen Township, New Jersey (pre-1862)|Bergen Township]], and [[Hudson County]], as well suburban and long-distance travelers to [[Manhattan]].\n\nIn the latter half of 19th century, a small island named [[Black Tom explosion#Black Tom Island|Black Tom]] was joined via landfill with the mainland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/parks/liberty_state_park/liberty_blacktomexplosion.html|title=Liberty State Park: Black Tom Explosion|publisher=State of New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection|date=January 26, 2005|access-date=April 8, 2014}}</ref> It became a major shipping, manufacturing, and transportation hub within [[Port of New York and New Jersey]], leading to the construction of [[Communipaw Terminal]]. It was from this ferry/train station that many immigrants arriving at [[Ellis Island]] spread out across the USA. In 1916, on what is now the southeastern corner of the park, the Black Tom explosion killed as many as seven people, caused $20 million in property damage, and was felt throughout the [[Tri-State Region]].\n[[File:LibertyStatePark(pre1976).tif|thumb|left|Before opening, LSP was the site of abandoned rail facilities built on landfills]]\nConstruction of the [[North River Tunnels]], [[containerization]], and the [[Interstate Highway System]], made the area less viable. The decline of industry, deterioration of rail and maritime infrastructure, and toxic waste, eventually made the area obsolete. Abandoned buildings and [[brownfields]] dominated the landscape after the mid-twentieth century, though there was still some manufacturing and recreational use.\n\nAudrey Zapp, Theodore Conrad, Morris Pesin<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmdb.org/Marker.asp?Marker=13294|title=Morris Pesin\u2019s Legendary Canoe Trip Which Launched Liberty State Park Historical Marker|author=|date=|website=HMDb.org|access-date=December 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/22colnj.html?scp=39&sq=liberty+island&st=nyt | work=The New York Times | first=Kevin | last=Coyne | title=A Quest That Brought Lady Liberty Closer | date=June 22, 2008}}</ref> and [[J.

It has many [[bike path]]s, walkways, and fields.\n\n'''Liberty Walkway''', a crescent-shaped promenade, stretches from the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal|CRRNJ Terminal]] along the waterfront south to the Statue of Liberty overlook, bridging two coves along the way. It is part of the longer [[Hudson River Waterfront Walkway]]. Halfway along Liberty Walkway is a bridge to [[Ellis Island]], but only authorized vehicles are allowed.\nThe southeastern corner of the park contains the Statue of Liberty overlook, picnic facilities, a playground, the ''U.S. Flag Plaza'' and ''Liberation Monument'', the Public Administration Building, and a memorial to the [[Black Tom explosion]]s. Picnicking and barbecuing facilities are also located at the southern end of the park.

In 1916, on what is now the southeastern corner of the park, the Black Tom explosion killed as many as seven people, caused $20 million in property damage, and was felt throughout the [[Tri-State Region]].\n[[File:LibertyStatePark(pre1976).tif|thumb|left|Before opening, LSP was the site of abandoned rail facilities built on landfills]]\nConstruction of the [[North River Tunnels]], [[containerization]], and the [[Interstate Highway System]], made the area less viable. The decline of industry, deterioration of rail and maritime infrastructure, and toxic waste, eventually made the area obsolete.
