He studied at the Dresden ''Staatsakademie f\u00fcr Bildende K\u00fcnste'' ([[Dresden Art Academy]], today's ''College of Fine Arts'') for six years, and used a travel grant award to visit [[France]], [[Italy]], [[UK]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Jentsch moved to Namibia in 1938 to escape the approaching war and lived there until his death. He travelled extensively in Namibia and eventually settled down near Dordabis, about 60&nbsp;km from the capital [[Windhoek]].  He is one of Namibia's most famous painters.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Germany===\nJentsch was the son of a Lutheran church official, Stephan Jentsch, and his wife Adele.<ref name=\"ol\">{{cite book |last1=Levinson |first1=Olga |title=Adolph Jentsch |date=1973 |publisher=Human & Rousseau |location=Cape Town |isbn=9780798103060 }}</ref>  He attended the gymnasium of the ''Brudergemeine Zinzendorf'', at Nieski.<ref name=\"eb\">{{cite book |last1=Berman |first1=Esm\u00e9 |title=Art & Artists of South Africa: An Illustrated Biographical Dictionary and Historical Survey of Painters, Sculptors & Graphic Artists Since 1875 |date=1993 |publisher=Southern Book Publishers |location=South Africa |isbn=9781868123452}}</ref> Six years of further education followed at Dresden's ''Staatsakademie f\u03cbr Bildende K\u00fcnste''.<ref name=\"eb\" /> Other student artists at the Academy were Pechstein, Grosz and Schwitters.<ref name=\"ol\" /> He was awarded the ''K\u00f6niglich-S\u00e4chsiche Staatsmedaille fur Kunst und Wissenschaft'' and several travel grants. Later, Jentsch often worked for Gussman, decorating public buildings.<ref name=\"ol\" />\n\nJentsch was in the [[J\u00e4ger (infantry)|J\u00e4ger-Reserve]] <ref name=\"eb\" /> in the First World War, but developed a crippling [[rheumatism]] that put him into a military hospital at [[Neustadt an der Weinstra\u00dfe|Neustadt]] for a year.<ref name=\"ol\" /> After the war, he married a young divorcee, Anne Ilgen, in 1920, and together they operated a small factory making spray-containers for perfume. Anne ran the factory while Jentsch painted. A son, Christoph, was born in 1921.<ref name=\"ol\" />\n\nJentsch illustrated a children's book in 1927, and joined a group of interior decorators in [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref name=\"ol\" /> He worked on colour schemes and decorative painting on jobs in Germany and Czechoslovakia.<ref name=\"ol\" />\n\n===Namibia===\nJentsch's antipathy to [[Nazism|National Socialism]] resulted in a loss of commissions, so he took up an offer to vacation on a friend's farm in Namibia (then called South West Africa). He arrived in Africa in early 1938, and never left, working in oils and watercolour until his death in 1977.\n\nJentsch painted landscapes almost exclusively, working in watercolour and oil. He was interested in Oriental philosophy, specifically [[Taoism]], and was influenced by Chinese Art. He travelled extensively in Namibia, staying at many farms and painting the diverse landscapes, but in 1947 he finally settled on a farm near Dordabis called ''Brack'', about 60&nbsp;km from Windhoek, with his friends Gebhard and Dorothee von Funcke.<ref name=\"ol\" />\n\nJentsch found the Namibian landscape amenable to his mystic approach to art. His watercolours display the same calligraphic strokes seen in Chinese art. In 1960 Jentsch abandoned oils and worked only in watercolour.<ref name=\"eb\" />\n\n===Later life===\nIn the early 1970s he suffered a [[stroke]] that left him with a severe tremor and stopped him painting completely. Jentsch and Dorothea von Funcke (whose husband had by now died) moved into a modest house in [[Windhoek]] for the last few years of his life.\n\nFive of his paintings were reproduced as stamps in 1973 \u2013 the first non-commemorative stamps in South Africa philatelic history.<ref name=\"eb\" />\n\nIn 1975, farm workers at ''Brack'', attempting to smoke out a wasp's nest, started a fire next to the old barn where Jentsch stored much of his oeuvre. The barn caught fire and burned down, with the result that the product of 40 years, including some of his most important works, was tragically lost.<ref name=\"ol\" /><ref name=\"eb\" />\n\nFour of Jentsch's watercolours were reproduced in limited editions by Orde Levinson in 1975.\n\n==Awards==\n*1913 K\u00f6niglich-S\u00e4chsische Staatsmedaille f\u00fcr Kunst und Wissenschaft.\n*1958 [[Federal Cross of Merit|Order of Merit]], First Class, Federal Republic of West Germany.\n*1962 Medal of Honour for Painting, SA Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns.\n\n==Public Collections==\n*Administration of South West Africa\n*Hester Rupert Art Museum, Graaf-Reinet\n*Johannesburg Art Gallery\n*King George VI Gallery, Port Elizabeth\n*Pietersburg Collection\n*Pretoria Art Museum\n*Pretoria University\n*Rand Afrikaans University, Johannesburg\n*Rembrandt van Rijn Art Foundation\n*S.A Association of Arts, Windhoek\n*S.A National Gallery, Cape Town\n*South African National Art Gallery, Cape Town\n*State Museum, Windhoek\n*UNISA\n*University of Stellenbosch\n*William Humphreys Gallery, Kimberley.\n*{{AKL|77|535}}\n\n==Art Exhibitions==\n* 1938 : Adolph Jentsch's first one-man exhibition in Southern Africa, Windhoek.\n* 1954 : Venice Biennale\n* 1956 : First Quad of South African Art\n* 1958 : Retrospective Exhibition, Windhoek (70th Birthday); South African Exhibition touring Holland, Germany and Belgium.\n* 1960 Second Quad of South African Art.\n* 1962 : \u201cSouth West African Artists\u2019, South African National Art Gallery, Cape Town.\n* 1964 : Third Quad of South African Art.\n* 1966 : Republic Fest Exhibition, Pretoria.\n* 1967 : Prestige Exhibition, Johannesburg Art Gallery\n* 1968 : Retrospective Exhibition, SAAA, Windhoek (80th Birthday)\n* 1970/1 : Prestige Exhibition, Pretoria Art Museum\n* 1974 : Retrospective Exhibition, SAAA, Windhoek\n\n==Publications==\n*Adolph Jentsch.

He studied at the Dresden ''Staatsakademie f\u00fcr Bildende Kunste'' ([[Dresden Art Academy]], today's ''College of Fine Arts'') for six years, and used a travel grant award to visit [[France]], [[Italy]], [[UK]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Jentsch moved to Namibia in 1938 to escape the approaching war and lived there until his death. He travelled extensively in Namibia and eventually settled down near Dordabis, about 60&nbsp;km from the capital [[Windhoek]].  He is one of Namibia's most famous painters.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Germany===\nJentsch was the son of a Lutheran church official, Stephan Jentsch, and his wife Adele.<ref name=\"ol\">{{cite book |last1=Levinson |first1=Olga |title=Adolph Jentsch |date=1973 |publisher=Human & Rousseau |location=Cape Town |isbn=9780798103060 }}</ref>  He attended the gymnasium of the ''Brudergemeine Zinzendorf'', at Nieski.<ref name=\"eb\">{{cite book |last1=Berman |first1=Esm\u00e9 |title=Art & Artists of South Africa: An Illustrated Biographical Dictionary and Historical Survey of Painters, Sculptors & Graphic Artists Since 1875 |date=1993 |publisher=Southern Book Publishers |location=South Africa |isbn=9781868123452}}</ref> Six years of further education followed at Dresden's ''Staatsakademie f\u03cbr Bildende K\u00fcnste''.<ref name=\"eb\" /> Other student artists at the Academy were Pechstein, Grosz and Schwitters.<ref name=\"ol\" /> He was awarded the ''K\u00f6niglich-S\u00e4chsiche Staatsmedaille fur Kunst und Wissenschaft'' and several travel grants. Later, Jentsch often worked for Gussman, decorating public buildings.<ref name=\"ol\" />\n\nJentsch was in the [[J\u00e4ger (infantry)|J\u00e4ger-Reserve]] <ref name=\"eb\" /> in the First World War, but developed a crippling [[rheumatism]] that put him into a military hospital at [[Neustadt an der Weinstra\u00dfe|Neustadt]] for a year.<ref name=\"ol\" /> After the war, he married a young divorcee, Anne Ilgen, in 1920, and together they operated a small factory making spray-containers for perfume. Anne ran the factory while Jentsch painted. A son, Christoph, was born in 1921.<ref name=\"ol\" />\n\nJentsch illustrated a children's book in 1927, and joined a group of interior decorators in [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref name=\"ol\" /> He worked on colour schemes and decorative painting on jobs in Germany and Czechoslovakia.<ref name=\"ol\" />\n\n===Namibia===\nJentsch's antipathy to [[Nazism|National Socialism]] resulted in a loss of commissions, so he took up an offer to vacation on a friend's farm in Namibia (then called South West Africa). He arrived in Africa in early 1938, and never left, working in oils and watercolour until his death in 1977.\n\nJentsch painted landscapes almost exclusively, working in watercolour and oil. He was interested in Oriental philosophy, specifically [[Taoism]], and was influenced by Chinese Art. He travelled extensively in Namibia, staying at many farms and painting the diverse landscapes, but in 1947 he finally settled on a farm near Dordabis called ''Brack'', about 60&nbsp;km from Windhoek, with his friends Gebhard and Dorothee von Funcke.<ref name=\"ol\" />\n\nJentsch found the Namibian landscape amenable to his mystic approach to art. His watercolours display the same calligraphic strokes seen in Chinese art. In 1960 Jentsch abandoned oils and worked only in watercolour.<ref name=\"eb\" />\n\n===Later life===\nIn the early 1970s he suffered a [[stroke]] that left him with a severe tremor and stopped him painting completely. Jentsch and Dorothea von Funcke (whose husband had by now died) moved into a modest house in [[Windhoek]] for the last few years of his life.\n\nFive of his paintings were reproduced as stamps in 1973 \u2013 the first non-commemorative stamps in South Africa philatelic history.<ref name=\"eb\" />\n\nIn 1975, farm workers at ''Brack'', attempting to smoke out a wasp's nest, started a fire next to the old barn where Jentsch stored much of his oeuvre. The barn caught fire and burned down, with the result that the product of 40 years, including some of his most important works, was tragically lost.<ref name=\"ol\" /><ref name=\"eb\" />\n\nFour of Jentsch's watercolours were reproduced in limited editions by Orde Levinson in 1975.\n\n==Awards==\n*1913 K\u00f6niglich-S\u00e4chsische Staatsmedaille f\u00fcr Kunst und Wissenschaft.\n*1958 [[Federal Cross of Merit|Order of Merit]], First Class, Federal Republic of West Germany.\n*1962 Medal of Honour for Painting, SA Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns.\n\n==Public Collections==\n*Administration of South West Africa\n*Hester Rupert Art Museum, Graaf-Reinet\n*Johannesburg Art Gallery\n*King George VI Gallery, Port Elizabeth\n*Pietersburg Collection\n*Pretoria Art Museum\n*Pretoria University\n*Rand Afrikaans University, Johannesburg\n*Rembrandt van Rijn Art Foundation\n*S.A Association of Arts, Windhoek\n*S.A National Gallery, Cape Town\n*South African National Art Gallery, Cape Town\n*State Museum, Windhoek\n*UNISA\n*University of Stellenbosch\n*William Humphreys Gallery, Kimberley.\n*{{AKL|77|535}}\n\n==Art Exhibitions==\n* 1938 : Adolph Jentsch's first one-man exhibition in Southern Africa, Windhoek.\n* 1954 : Venice Biennale\n* 1956 : First Quad of South African Art\n* 1958 : Retrospective Exhibition, Windhoek (70th Birthday); South African Exhibition touring Holland, Germany and Belgium.\n* 1960 Second Quad of South African Art.\n* 1962 : \u201cSouth West African Artists\u2019, South African National Art Gallery, Cape Town.\n* 1964 : Third Quad of South African Art.\n* 1966 : Republic Fest Exhibition, Pretoria.\n* 1967 : Prestige Exhibition, Johannesburg Art Gallery\n* 1968 : Retrospective Exhibition, SAAA, Windhoek (80th Birthday)\n* 1970/1 : Prestige Exhibition, Pretoria Art Museum\n* 1974 : Retrospective Exhibition, SAAA, Windhoek\n\n==Publications==\n*Adolph Jentsch.

Vygotsky eventually came to dialogue with the mainstream Gestalt line of thought and adopted a more holistic approach to understanding development. Under the increasing influence of the holistic thinking of the scholars primarily associated with German-American [[Gestalt psychology]] movement, Vygotsky adopted their views on \"psychological systems\" and\u2014inspired by [[Kurt Lewin]]'s \"[[Field theory (psychology)|Topological (and vector) psychology]]\"\u2014introduced the enigmatic construct of the \"[[zone of proximal development]]\". It was during this period that he identified the play of young children as their \"leading activity\", which he understood to be the main source of preschoolers' psychological development, and which he viewed as an expression of an inseparable unity of emotional, volitional, and cognitive development. At this time, Vygotsky fully revealed his long-time interest in the [[Philosophy of Baruch Spinoza|philosophy of Spinoza]], who would remain one of his favorite thinkers throughout his life. A fervent [[Spinozism|Spinozist]] in many respects, Vygotsky was profoundly influenced by Spinoza's thought, largely in response to Spinoza's examinations concerning human emotion.<ref>Vygotsky, L.

Jornet & Cole (2018): \"It has been known since the publication of ''Thought and Language'' in English that at the end of his life, Vygotsky turned to the ideas of Spinoza to overcome what he considered the shortcomings of his earlier theoretical ideas, bringing emotion to center stage in the process of development. Recent scholarship has made it clear that Spinoza was important from the beginning Vygotsky's career. His doctoral thesis, ''The Psychology of Art'', opens with a quotation from Spinoza, and years later [[Aleksei N. Leontiev|Leont'ev]] (1997) made it clear in his introduction to Vygotsky's collected works that Vygotsky's interest in the philosophy of Spinoza began as early as his student years, and \u201cwould remain his favorite thinker for the rest of his life\u201d. Spinoza's lifelong influence on Vygotsky, however, has remained a relatively unexplored issue.\"</ref> As his work matured, Spinoza's thought became a more central visitation in Vygotsky's later work, increasingly focused on the issue of human emotion and its role in higher psychological functions and development that he largely omitted in his earlier work and utterly needed for creating a holistic psychological theory.\n\nAs early as in mid-1920s, Vygotsky's ideas were introduced in the West, but he remained virtually unknown until the early 1980s when the popularity among educators of the [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivist]] developmental psychology and educational theory of Jean Piaget (1896-1980) started to decline and, in contrast, Vygotsky's notion of the \"zone of proximal development\" became a central component of the development of the so-called \"[[Social constructivism|social constructivist]]\" turn in developmental and, primarily, educational psychology and practice. A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' study, published in 2002, ranked Vygotsky as the 83rd top psychologist of the twentieth century and the third (and the last) Russian on the top-100 list after [[Ivan Pavlov]] and Vygotsky's longtime collaborator [[Alexander Luria]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=139\u2013152 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx |last=Haggbloom |first=Steven J. |last2=Warnick |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell III |first9=John L. |last10=Beavers |first10=Jamie |last11=Monte |first11=Emmanuelle |citeseerx=10.1.1.586.1913 }}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nLev Semionovich Vygotsky ({{lang-rus|\u041b\u0435\u0432 \u0421\u0435\u043c\u0451\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0412\u044b\u0433\u043e\u0301\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|p=v\u0268\u02c8\u0261otsk\u02b2\u026aj}}; {{OldStyleDate|November 17|1896|November 5}} \u2013 June 11, 1934) was born to the Vygodskii family in the town of [[Orsha]], [[Belarus]] (then belonging to [[Russian Empire]]) into a non-religious middle-class family of [[Russian Jews|Russian Jewish]] extraction.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pound|first=Linda|title=How Children Learn (New Edition)|date=2019|publisher=Andrews UK Limited|isbn=978-1-909280-73-1|location=London|pages=51|language=en}}</ref> His father Simkha Vygodskii was a banker.\n\nLev Vygodskii was raised in the city of [[Gomel]], where he was homeschooled until 1911 and then obtained formal degree (with distinction) in a private Jewish Gimnasium, which allowed him entrance to a university. In 1913 Lev Vygodskii was admitted to the [[Moscow University]] by mere ballot through a \"[[Jewish quota#Countries legislating limitations on the admission of Jewish students|Jewish Lottery]]\": at the time a three percent Jewish student quota was administered for entry in Moscow and Saint Petersburg universities. He had interest in humanities and social sciences, but at the insistence of his parents he applied to the medical school in Moscow University. During the first semester of study he transferred to the law school. There he studied law and, in parallel, he attended lectures at fully official, but privately funded and non degree granting Shaniavskii [[:ru:\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0410. \u041b. \u0428\u0430\u043d\u044f\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e|Moscow City People's University]]\".<ref>[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Shaniavskii+University Shaniavskii University]</ref>\n\nVygodskii's early interests were in the arts and, primarily, in the topics of the history of the Jewish people, the tradition, culture and Jewish identity. In contrast, during this period he was highly critical of the ideas of both [[socialism]] and [[Zionism]], and proposed the solution of the \"Jewish question\" by return to the traditional Jewish Orthodoxy.  His own academics, however, included a wide field of studies including linguistics, psychology, and philosophy.\n\nLev Vygotsky never completed his formal studies at the [[Imperial Moscow University]] and, thus, he never obtained a university degree: his studies were interrupted by the October Bolshevik uprising in 1917 in the country's capital Petrograd and the second largest city Moscow. Following these events, he left Moscow and eventually returned to Gomel, where he lived after the [[October Revolution|October Socialist Revolution]] of 1917 occurred. There is virtually no information about his life during the years in Gomel (that administratively belonged to the [[Ukrainian State]] at the time) after the German occupation during the [[WWI]], until the [[Bolsheviks]] captured the town in 1919. After that, he was an active participant of major social transformation under the Bolshevik (Communist) rule and a fairly prominent representative of the Bolshevik government in Gomel from 1919 to 1923. By the early 1920s, as reflected in his journalistic publications of the time, he informally changed his Jewish-sounding birth name, 'Lev S\u00edmkhovich V\u00fdgodskii' ({{lang-rus|\u041b\u0435\u0432 \u0421\u0438\u0301\u043c\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0412\u044b\u0301\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439}}), with the surname becoming ''Vyg\u00f3tskii'' and the [[Russian patronymic|patronymic]] 'S\u00edmkhovich' becoming the Slavic 'Semi\u00f3novich'. It was under this pen-name that the fame subsequently came to him. His daughters (subsequently born in 1925 and 1930)  and other relatives, though, preserved their original family name 'Vygodskii'. The traditional English spelling of his last name nowadays is 'Vygotsky'.<ref name=\"bioBook\"/>\n\nIn January 1924, Vygotsky took part in the Second All-Russian Psychoneurological Congress in [[Petrograd]] (soon thereafter renamed [[Leningrad]]). After the Congress, Vygotsky received an invitation to become a research fellow at the Psychological Institute in Moscow. Vygotsky moved to Moscow with his new wife, Roza Smekhova. He began his career at the Psychological Institute as a \"staff scientist, second class\".<ref>Van der Veer, R., & Valsiner, J. (1991).

''Journal of Russian and East European Psychology'', vol. 50, no. 4, July\u2013August 2012</ref> In this early manuscript, Vygotsky argued for the formation of a general psychology that could unite the naturalist objectivist strands of psychological science with the more philosophical approaches of Marxist orientation. However, he also harshly criticized those of his colleagues who attempted to build a \"[[Marxism|Marxist]] Psychology\" as an alternative to the naturalist and philosophical schools. He argued that if one wanted to build a truly Marxist Psychology, there were no shortcuts to be found by merely looking for applicable quotes in the writings of [[Karl Marx|Marx]]. Rather one should look for a methodology that was in accordance with the Marxian spirit.<ref name=\"Kozulin1986\">Kozulin, Alex. 1986. \"Vygotsky in Context\" in Vygotsky L. \"Thought and Language\", MIT Press. pp. xi - lvii</ref>\n\nFrom 1926-30, Vygotsky worked on a research program investigating the development of higher cognitive functions of logical memory, selective attention, decision making, and language comprehension, from early forms of primal psychological functions. During this period he gathered a group of collaborators including [[Alexander Luria]], Boris Varshava, [[Alexei Leontiev]], [[Leonid Zankov]], and several others. Vygotsky guided his students in researching this phenomenon from three different perspectives: \n* The instrumental approach, which aimed to understand the ways humans use objects as mediation aids in memory and reasoning.\n* A developmental approach, focused on how children acquire higher cognitive functions during development\n* A culture-historical approach, studying how social and cultural patterns of interaction shape forms of mediation and developmental trajectories <ref name=\"Kozulin1986\"/>\n\nIn the early 1930s, Vygotsky experienced deep crises, both personal and theoretical, and after a period of massive self-criticism he made an attempt at a radical revision of his theory. The work of the representatives of the [[Gestalt psychology]] and other holistic scholars was instrumental in this theoretical shift. In 1932-1934, Vygotsky aimed to establish a psychological theory of consciousness, but because of his death, this theory remained only unconfirmed and unfinished.\n\n==Life and scientific legacy==\nVygotsky was a pioneering psychologist and his major works span six separate volumes, written over roughly ten years, from ''Psychology of Art'' (1925) to ''Thought and Language'' [or ''Thinking and Speech''] (1934). Vygotsky's interests in the fields of [[developmental psychology]], [[child development]], and [[education]] were extremely diverse. His philosophical framework includes interpretations of the cognitive role of mediation tools, as well as the re-interpretation of well-known concepts in psychology such as [[internalization]] of knowledge. Vygotsky introduced the notion of [[zone of proximal development]], a metaphor capable of describing the potential of human cognitive development. His work covered topics such as the origin and the [[psychology of art]], development of higher [[mental function]]s, [[philosophy of science]] and the [[Methodology|methodology of psychological research]], the relation between [[learning]] and [[Developmental psychology|human development]], concept formation, interrelation between [[language and thought]] development, play as a psychological phenomenon, [[learning disabilities]], and abnormal human development (aka ''defectology''). His scientific thinking underwent several major transformations throughout his career, but generally Vygotsky's legacy may be divided into two fairly distinct periods,{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} and the transitional phase between the two during which Vygotsky experienced the crisis in his theory and personal life. These are the [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] \"instrumental\" period of the 1920s, integrative \"[[Holism|holistic]]\" period of the 1930s, and the transitional years of, roughly, 1929-1931. Each of these periods is characterized by its distinct themes and theoretical innovations.\n\n===\"Instrumental\" period (1920s)===\n\n====Cultural mediation and internalization====\nVygotsky studied child development and the significant roles of [[cultural mediation]] and [[interpersonal communication]]. He observed how higher mental functions developed through these interactions, and also represented the shared knowledge of a culture. This process is known as [[internalization]]. ''Internalization'' may be understood in one respect as \"knowing how\". For example, the practices of riding a bicycle or pouring a cup of milk, initially, are outside and beyond the child. The mastery of the skills needed for performing these practices occurs through the activity of the child within society. A further aspect of internalization is ''appropriation'', in which children take tools and adapt them to personal use, perhaps using them in unique ways. Internalizing the use of a pencil allows the child to use it very much for personal ends rather than drawing exactly what others in society have drawn previously.\n\n===The period of crisis, criticism, and self-criticism (1929\u20131932)===\n\nIn the 1930s, Vygotsky was engaged in massive reconstruction of the theory of his \"instrumental\" period of the 1920s. Around 1929-1930, he realized numerous deficiencies and imperfections of the earlier work of the Vygotsky Circle and criticized it on a number of occasions: in 1929,<ref>Cf. self-criticism of 1929: \"I am revising the s[econd] part of \"monkey\"[i.e., the book Ape, primitive, and child]. Alas! The f[irst] chapter is written wholly according to the Freudianists [...]; then the impenetrable Piaget is turned into an absolute beyond all measure; instrument and sign are mixed together even more, and so on and so forth. This is not the fault of A. R. [Luria] personally, but of the entire \"epoch\" of our thinking. We need to put a stop to this unrelentingly. [...] Let there be the most rigorous, monastic regime of thought; ideological seclusion, if necessary. And let us demand the same of others. Let us explain that studying cultural psychology is no joke, not something to do at odd moments or among other things, and not grounds for every new person\u2019s own conjectures\".

The necessity of a new stage of inquiry does not stem from the fact that a new thought has occurred to me or a new idea has caught my interest, but from the necessity of developing the research itself\u2014new facts prod me into searching for new and more intricate explanations. The narrowness, bias, and schematism of the old mindset led us to the wrong assessment of the essential principles that we mistook for the secondary ones: interfunctional connections. We focused attention on the sign (on the tool) to the detriment of the operation with it, representing it as something simple, which goes through three phases: magical\u2014external\u2014internal. But the knot is external and the teenager\u2019s diary is external. Hence we have a sea of poorly explained facts and a desire to delve more deeply into the facts, i.e., to evaluate them theoretically in a different way.\n2. The higher and lower functions are not constructed in two tiers: their number and names do not match. But our previous understanding was not right, either [, according to which] a higher function is the mastery of the lower ([e.g.,] voluntary attention is the subordination to it of involuntary attention) because this means exactly\u2014in two tiers\". Vygotsky\u2019s record titled \"Symposium, December 4, 1932\", see in Zavershneva, E. 2010b. The Vygotsky Family Archive: New Findings. Notebooks, Notes, and Scientific Journals of L.S. Vygotsky (1912\u20131934). ''Journal of the Russian and East European Psychology'' 48 (1):34-60, pp. 41-42</ref>\n\nVygotsky's self-criticism was complemented by external criticism for a number of issues, including the separation between the \"higher\" and the \"lower\" psychological functions, impracticality and inapplicability of his theory in social practices (such as industry or education) during the time of rapid social change, and vulgar Marxist interpretation of human psychological processes. Critics also pointed to his overemphasis on the role of language and, on the other hand, the ignorance of the emotional factors in human development. Major figures in Soviet psychology such as [[Sergei Rubinstein]] criticized Vygotsky's notion of mediation and its development in the works of students. Following criticism and in response to a generous offer from the highest officials in Soviet Ukraine, a major group of Vygotsky's associates, the members of the [[Vygotsky Circle]], including [[Alexander Luria|Luria]], [[Mark Lebedinsky]], and [[Aleksei N. Leontiev|Leontiev]], moved from Moscow to Ukraine to establish the [[Kharkov School of Psychology|Kharkov school of psychology]]. In the second half of the 1930s, Vygotsky was criticized again for his involvement in the cross-disciplinary study of the child known as [[paedology]] and uncritical borrowings from contemporary \"bourgeois\" science. Considerable critique came from alleged followers of Vygotsky, such as Leontiev and members of his research group in Kharkov. Much of this early criticism was later discarded by these Vygotskian scholars as well.\n\n===\"Holistic\" period (1932\u20131934)===\n\nThere occurred a period of major revision of Vygotsky's theory, a transition from a mechanist orientation of his 1920s to an integrative holistic science of the 1930s. During this period, Vygotsky was under particularly strong influence of holistic theories of German-American group of proponents of [[Gestalt psychology]], most notably, the peripheral participants of the Gestalt movement [[Kurt Goldstein]] and [[Kurt Lewin]]. However, Vygotsky's work of this period remained largely fragmentary and unfinished and, therefore, unpublished.\n\n====Zone of Proximal Development====\n\"[[Zone of Proximal Development]]\" (ZPD) is a term Vygotsky used to characterize an individual\u2019s mental development. He originally defined the ZPD as \u201cthe distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers.\u201d<ref name=\"vygoBubble\" /> He used the example of two children in school who originally could solve problems at an eight-year-old developmental level (that is, typical for children who were age 8). After each child received assistance from an adult, one was able to perform at a nine-year-old level and one was able to perform at a twelve-year-old level. He said \u201cThis difference between twelve and eight, or between nine and eight, is what we call ''the zone of proximal development.''\u201d<ref name=\"vygoBubble\" /> He further said that the ZPD \u201cdefines those functions that have not yet matured but are in the process of maturation, functions that will mature tomorrow but are currently in an embryonic state.\u201d<ref name=\"vygoBubble\" /> The zone is bracketed by the learner's current ability and the ability they can achieve with the aid of an instructor of some capacity.\n\nVygotsky viewed the ZPD as a better way to explain the relation between children's learning and cognitive development. Prior to the ZPD, the relation between learning and development could be boiled down to the following three major positions: 1) Development always precedes learning (e.g., [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]]): children first need to meet a particular maturation level before learning can occur; 2) Learning and development cannot be separated, but instead occur simultaneously (e.g., [[behaviorism]]): essentially, learning is development; and 3) learning and development are separate, but interactive processes (e.g., [[gestaltism]]): one process always prepares the other process, and vice versa. Vygotsky rejected these three major theories because he believed that learning should always precede development in the ZPD. According to Vygotsky, through the assistance of a more knowledgeable other, a child is able to learn skills or aspects of a skill that go beyond the child's actual developmental or maturational level. The lower limit of ZPD is the level of skill reached by the child working independently (also referred to as the child's developmental level). The upper limit is the level of potential skill that the child is able to reach with the assistance of a more capable instructor. In this sense, the ZPD provides a prospective view of cognitive development, as opposed to a retrospective view that characterizes development in terms of a child's independent capabilities. The advancement through and attainment of the upper limit of the ZPD is limited by the instructional and scaffolding-related capabilities of the more knowledgeable other (MKO).  The MKO is typically assumed to be an older, more experienced teacher or parent, but often can be a learner's peer or someone their junior. The MKO need not even be a person, it can be a machine or book, or other source of visual and/or audio input.[https://web.archive.org/web/20190805212531/https://www.simplypsychology.org/vygotsky.html]\n\n====''Thinking and speech''====\nPerhaps Vygotsky's most important contribution concerns the inter-relationship of language development and thought. This problem was explored in Vygotsky's book, ''Thinking and speech'', entitled in Russian, ''Myshlenie i rech'', that was published in 1934. In fact, this book was a mere collection of essays and scholarly papers that Vygotsky wrote during different periods of his thought development and included writings of his \"instrumental\" and \"holistic\" periods. Vygotsky never saw the book published: it was published posthumously, edited by his closest associates (Kolbanovskii, Zankov, and Shif) not sooner than December, 1934, i.e., half a year after his death. The first English translation was published in 1962 (with several later revised editions) heavily abbreviated and under an alternative and incorrect translation of the title ''Thought and Language'' for the Russian title ''Mysl' i iazyk''. The book establishes the explicit and profound connection between speech (both silent inner speech and oral language), and the development of mental concepts and cognitive awareness. Vygotsky described inner speech as being qualitatively different from verbal external speech. Although Vygotsky believed inner speech developed from external speech via a gradual process of \"internalization\" (i.e., transition from the external to the internal), with younger children only really able to \"think out loud\", he claimed that in its mature form, inner speech would not resemble spoken language as we know it (in particular, being greatly compressed). Hence, thought itself developing socially.\n\n===Death (1934) and posthumous fame===\nVygotsky died of [[tuberculosis]] on June 11, 1934, at the age of 37, in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]]. One of Vygotsky's last private notebook entries gives a proverbial, yet very pessimistic self-assessment of his contribution to psychological theory:\n\n<blockquote>This is the final thing I have done in psychology \u2013 and I will like [[Moses]] die at the summit, having glimpsed the promised land but without setting foot on it.

In 1962 a translation of his posthumous 1934 book, ''Thinking and Speech'', published with the title,''Thought and Language'', did not seem to change the situation considerably. It was only after an eclectic compilation of partly rephrased and partly translated works of Vygotsky and his collaborators, published in 1978 under Vygotsky's name as ''Mind in Society'', that the Vygotsky boom started in the West: originally, in North America, and later, following the North American example, spread to other regions of the world. This version of Vygotskian science is typically associated with the names of its chief proponents Michael Cole, [[James Wertsch]], their associates and followers, and is relatively well known under the names of \"[[cultural-historical activity theory]]\" (aka CHAT) or\u2014yet more distant from Vygotsky's legacy\u2014\"[[activity theory]]\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Roth|first=W.M.|author2=Lee, J.Y. |title=\"Vygotsky's Neglected Legacy\": Cultural Historical Activity Theory|journal=Review of Educational Research|date=June 2007|volume=77|issue=2|doi=10.3102/0034654306298273|pages=186\u2013232|url=http://lchc.ucsd.edu/MCA/Mail/xmcamail.2007_06.dir/att-0021/Wolff-Michael_Roth_Vygotsky.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.584.7175}}</ref><ref name=\"toomela1\">{{cite journal | last1 = Toomela | first1 = A | year = 2000 | title = Activity theory is a dead end for cultural-historical psychology | url = | journal = Culture & Psychology | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 353\u2013364 | doi=10.1177/1354067x0063005}}</ref><ref  name=\"toomela2\">{{cite journal | last1 = Toomela | first1 = A | year = 2008 | title = Activity theory is a dead end for methodological thinking in cultural psychology too | url = | journal = Culture & Psychology | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 289\u2013303 | doi=10.1177/1354067x08088558}}</ref> [[Instructional scaffolding|Scaffolding]], a concept introduced by Wood, [[Jerome Bruner|Bruner]], and Ross in 1976, is somewhat related to the idea of ZPD, although Vygotsky never used the term.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = D.

Vygotsky eventually came to dialogue with the mainstream Gestalt line of thought and adopted a more holistic approach to understanding development. Under the increasing influence of the holistic thinking of the scholars primarily associated with German-American [[Gestalt psychology]] movement, Vygotsky adopted their views on \"psychological systems\" and\u2014inspired by [[Kurt Lewin]]'s \"[[Field theory (psychology)|Topological (and vector) psychology]]\"\u2014introduced the enigmatic construct of the \"[[zone of proximal development]]\". It was during this period that he identified the play of young children as their \"leading activity\", which he understood to be the main source of preschoolers' psychological development, and which he viewed as an expression of an inseparable unity of emotional, volitional, and cognitive development. At this time, Vygotsky fully revealed his long-time interest in the [[Philosophy of Baruch Spinoza|philosophy of Spinoza]], who would remain one of his favorite thinkers throughout his life. A fervent [[Spinozism|Spinozist]] in many respects, Vygotsky was profoundly influenced by Spinoza's thought, largely in response to Spinoza's examinations concerning human emotion.<ref>Vygotsky, L.

Jornet & Cole (2018): \"It has been known since the publication of ''Thought and Language'' in English that at the end of his life, Vygotsky turned to the ideas of Spinoza to overcome what he considered the shortcomings of his earlier theoretical ideas, bringing emotion to center stage in the process of development. Recent scholarship has made it clear that Spinoza was important from the beginning Vygotsky's career. His doctoral thesis, ''The Psychology of Art'', opens with a quotation from Spinoza, and years later [[Aleksei N. Leontiev|Leont'ev]] (1997) made it clear in his introduction to Vygotsky's collected works that Vygotsky's interest in the philosophy of Spinoza began as early as his student years, and \u201cwould remain his favorite thinker for the rest of his life\u201d. Spinoza's lifelong influence on Vygotsky, however, has remained a relatively unexplored issue.\"</ref> As his work matured, Spinoza's thought became a more central visitation in Vygotsky's later work, increasingly focused on the issue of human emotion and its role in higher psychological functions and development that he largely omitted in his earlier work and utterly needed for creating a holistic psychological theory.\n\nAs early as in mid-1920s, Vygotsky's ideas were introduced in the West, but he remained virtually unknown until the early 1980s when the popularity among educators of the [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivist]] developmental psychology and educational theory of Jean Piaget (1896-1980) started to decline and, in contrast, Vygotsky's notion of the \"zone of proximal development\" became a central component of the development of the so-called \"[[Social constructivism|social constructivist]]\" turn in developmental and, primarily, educational psychology and practice. A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' study, published in 2002, ranked Vygotsky as the 83rd top psychologist of the twentieth century and the third (and the last) Russian on the top-100 list after [[Ivan Pavlov]] and Vygotsky's longtime collaborator [[Alexander Luria]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=139\u2013152 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx |last=Haggbloom |first=Steven J. |last2=Warnick |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell III |first9=John L. |last10=Beavers |first10=Jamie |last11=Monte |first11=Emmanuelle |citeseerx=10.1.1.586.1913 }}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nLev Semionovich Vygotsky ({{lang-rus|\u041b\u0435\u0432 \u0421\u0435\u043c\u0451\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0412\u044b\u0433\u043e\u0301\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|p=v\u0268\u02c8\u0261otsk\u02b2\u026aj}}; {{OldStyleDate|November 17|1896|November 5}} \u2013 June 11, 1934) was born to the Vygodskii family in the town of [[Orsha]], [[Belarus]] (then belonging to [[Russian Empire]]) into a non-religious middle-class family of [[Russian Jews|Russian Jewish]] extraction.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pound|first=Linda|title=How Children Learn (New Edition)|date=2019|publisher=Andrews UK Limited|isbn=978-1-909280-73-1|location=London|pages=51|language=en}}</ref> His father Simkha Vygodskii was a banker.\n\nLev Vygodskii was raised in the city of [[Gomel]], where he was homeschooled until 1911 and then obtained formal degree (with distinction) in a private Jewish Gimnasium, which allowed him entrance to a university. In 1913 Lev Vygodskii was admitted to the [[Moscow University]] by mere ballot through a \"[[Jewish quota#Countries legislating limitations on the admission of Jewish students|Jewish Lottery]]\": at the time a three percent Jewish student quota was administered for entry in Moscow and Saint Petersburg universities. He had interest in humanities and social sciences, but at the insistence of his parents he applied to the medical school in Moscow University. During the first semester of study he transferred to the law school. There he studied law and, in parallel, he attended lectures at fully official, but privately funded and non degree granting Shaniavskii [[:ru:\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0410. \u041b. \u0428\u0430\u043d\u044f\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e|Moscow City People's University]]\".<ref>[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Shaniavskii+University Shaniavskii University]</ref>\n\nVygodskii's early interests were in the arts and, primarily, in the topics of the history of the Jewish people, the tradition, culture and Jewish identity. In contrast, during this period he was highly critical of the ideas of both [[socialism]] and [[Zionism]], and proposed the solution of the \"Jewish question\" by return to the traditional Jewish Orthodoxy.  His own academics, however, included a wide field of studies including linguistics, psychology, and philosophy.\n\nLev Vygotsky never completed his formal studies at the [[Imperial Moscow University]] and, thus, he never obtained a university degree: his studies were interrupted by the October Bolshevik uprising in 1917 in the country's capital Petrograd and the second largest city Moscow. Following these events, he left Moscow and eventually returned to Gomel, where he lived after the [[October Revolution|October Socialist Revolution]] of 1917 occurred. There is virtually no information about his life during the years in Gomel (that administratively belonged to the [[Ukrainian State]] at the time) after the German occupation during the [[WWI]], until the [[Bolsheviks]] captured the town in 1919. After that, he was an active participant of major social transformation under the Bolshevik (Communist) rule and a fairly prominent representative of the Bolshevik government in Gomel from 1919 to 1923. By the early 1920s, as reflected in his journalistic publications of the time, he informally changed his Jewish-sounding birth name, 'Lev S\u00edmkhovich V\u00fdgodskii' ({{lang-rus|\u041b\u0435\u0432 \u0421\u0438\u0301\u043c\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0412\u044b\u0301\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439}}), with the surname becoming ''Vyg\u00f3tskii'' and the [[Russian patronymic|patronymic]] 'S\u00edmkhovich' becoming the Slavic 'Semi\u00f3novich'. It was under this pen-name that the fame subsequently came to him. His daughters (subsequently born in 1925 and 1930)  and other relatives, though, preserved their original family name 'Vygodskii'. The traditional English spelling of his last name nowadays is 'Vygotsky'.<ref name=\"bioBook\"/>\n\nIn January 1924, Vygotsky took part in the Second All-Russian Psychoneurological Congress in [[Petrograd]] (soon thereafter renamed [[Leningrad]]). After the Congress, Vygotsky received an invitation to become a research fellow at the Psychological Institute in Moscow. Vygotsky moved to Moscow with his new wife, Roza Smekhova. He began his career at the Psychological Institute as a \"staff scientist, second class\".<ref>Van der Veer, R., & Valsiner, J. (1991).

''Journal of Russian and East European Psychology'', vol. 50, no. 4, July\u2013August 2012</ref> In this early manuscript, Vygotsky argued for the formation of a general psychology that could unite the naturalist objectivist strands of psychological science with the more philosophical approaches of Marxist orientation. However, he also harshly criticized those of his colleagues who attempted to build a \"[[Marxism|Marxist]] Psychology\" as an alternative to the naturalist and philosophical schools. He argued that if one wanted to build a truly Marxist Psychology, there were no shortcuts to be found by merely looking for applicable quotes in the writings of [[Karl Marx|Marx]]. Rather one should look for a methodology that was in accordance with the Marxian spirit.<ref name=\"Kozulin1986\">Kozulin, Alex. 1986. \"Vygotsky in Context\" in Vygotsky L. \"Thought and Language\", MIT Press. pp. xi - lvii</ref>\n\nFrom 1926-30, Vygotsky worked on a research program investigating the development of higher cognitive functions of logical memory, selective attention, decision making, and language comprehension, from early forms of primal psychological functions. During this period he gathered a group of collaborators including [[Alexander Luria]], Boris Varshava, [[Alexei Leontiev]], [[Leonid Zankov]], and several others. Vygotsky guided his students in researching this phenomenon from three different perspectives: \n* The instrumental approach, which aimed to understand the ways humans use objects as mediation aids in memory and reasoning.\n* A developmental approach, focused on how children acquire higher cognitive functions during development\n* A culture-historical approach, studying how social and cultural patterns of interaction shape forms of mediation and developmental trajectories <ref name=\"Kozulin1986\"/>\n\nIn the early 1930s, Vygotsky experienced deep crises, both personal and theoretical, and after a period of massive self-criticism he made an attempt at a radical revision of his theory. The work of the representatives of the [[Gestalt psychology]] and other holistic scholars was instrumental in this theoretical shift. In 1932-1934, Vygotsky aimed to establish a psychological theory of consciousness, but because of his death, this theory remained only unconfirmed and unfinished.\n\n==Life and scientific legacy==\nVygotsky was a pioneering psychologist and his major works span six separate volumes, written over roughly ten years, from ''Psychology of Art'' (1925) to ''Thought and Language'' [or ''Thinking and Speech''] (1934). Vygotsky's interests in the fields of [[developmental psychology]], [[child development]], and [[education]] were extremely diverse. His philosophical framework includes interpretations of the cognitive role of mediation tools, as well as the re-interpretation of well-known concepts in psychology such as [[internalization]] of knowledge. Vygotsky introduced the notion of [[zone of proximal development]], a metaphor capable of describing the potential of human cognitive development. His work covered topics such as the origin and the [[psychology of art]], development of higher [[mental function]]s, [[philosophy of science]] and the [[Methodology|methodology of psychological research]], the relation between [[learning]] and [[Developmental psychology|human development]], concept formation, interrelation between [[language and thought]] development, play as a psychological phenomenon, [[learning disabilities]], and abnormal human development (aka ''defectology''). His scientific thinking underwent several major transformations throughout his career, but generally Vygotsky's legacy may be divided into two fairly distinct periods,{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} and the transitional phase between the two during which Vygotsky experienced the crisis in his theory and personal life. These are the [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] \"instrumental\" period of the 1920s, integrative \"[[Holism|holistic]]\" period of the 1930s, and the transitional years of, roughly, 1929-1931. Each of these periods is characterized by its distinct themes and theoretical innovations.\n\n===\"Instrumental\" period (1920s)===\n\n====Cultural mediation and internalization====\nVygotsky studied child development and the significant roles of [[cultural mediation]] and [[interpersonal communication]]. He observed how higher mental functions developed through these interactions, and also represented the shared knowledge of a culture. This process is known as [[internalization]]. ''Internalization'' may be understood in one respect as \"knowing how\". For example, the practices of riding a bicycle or pouring a cup of milk, initially, are outside and beyond the child. The mastery of the skills needed for performing these practices occurs through the activity of the child within society. A further aspect of internalization is ''appropriation'', in which children take tools and adapt them to personal use, perhaps using them in unique ways. Internalizing the use of a pencil allows the child to use it very much for personal ends rather than drawing exactly what others in society have drawn previously.\n\n===The period of crisis, criticism, and self-criticism (1929\u20131932)===\n\nIn the 1930s, Vygotsky was engaged in massive reconstruction of the theory of his \"instrumental\" period of the 1920s. Around 1929-1930, he realized numerous deficiencies and imperfections of the earlier work of the Vygotsky Circle and criticized it on a number of occasions: in 1929,<ref>Cf. self-criticism of 1929: \"I am revising the s[econd] part of \"monkey\"[i.e., the book Ape, primitive, and child]. Alas! The f[irst] chapter is written wholly according to the Freudianists [...]; then the impenetrable Piaget is turned into an absolute beyond all measure; instrument and sign are mixed together even more, and so on and so forth. This is not the fault of A. R. [Luria] personally, but of the entire \"epoch\" of our thinking. We need to put a stop to this unrelentingly. [...] Let there be the most rigorous, monastic regime of thought; ideological seclusion, if necessary. And let us demand the same of others. Let us explain that studying cultural psychology is no joke, not something to do at odd moments or among other things, and not grounds for every new person\u2019s own conjectures\".

The necessity of a new stage of inquiry does not stem from the fact that a new thought has occurred to me or a new idea has caught my interest, but from the necessity of developing the research itself\u2014new facts prod me into searching for new and more intricate explanations. The narrowness, bias, and schematism of the old mindset led us to the wrong assessment of the essential principles that we mistook for the secondary ones: interfunctional connections. We focused attention on the sign (on the tool) to the detriment of the operation with it, representing it as something simple, which goes through three phases: magical\u2014external\u2014internal. But the knot is external and the teenager\u2019s diary is external. Hence we have a sea of poorly explained facts and a desire to delve more deeply into the facts, i.e., to evaluate them theoretically in a different way.\n2.

''Journal of the Russian and East European Psychology'' 48 (1):34-60, pp. 41-42</ref>\n\nVygotsky's self-criticism was complemented by external criticism for a number of issues, including the separation between the \"higher\" and the \"lower\" psychological functions, impracticality and inapplicability of his theory in social practices (such as industry or education) during the time of rapid social change, and vulgar Marxist interpretation of human psychological processes. Critics also pointed to his overemphasis on the role of language and, on the other hand, the ignorance of the emotional factors in human development. Major figures in Soviet psychology such as [[Sergei Rubinstein]] criticized Vygotsky's notion of mediation and its development in the works of students. Following criticism and in response to a generous offer from the highest officials in Soviet Ukraine, a major group of Vygotsky's associates, the members of the [[Vygotsky Circle]], including [[Alexander Luria|Luria]], [[Mark Lebedinsky]], and [[Aleksei N. Leontiev|Leontiev]], moved from Moscow to Ukraine to establish the [[Kharkov School of Psychology|Kharkov school of psychology]]. In the second half of the 1930s, Vygotsky was criticized again for his involvement in the cross-disciplinary study of the child known as [[paedology]] and uncritical borrowings from contemporary \"bourgeois\" science. Considerable critique came from alleged followers of Vygotsky, such as Leontiev and members of his research group in Kharkov. Much of this early criticism was later discarded by these Vygotskian scholars as well.\n\n===\"Holistic\" period (1932\u20131934)===\n\nThere occurred a period of major revision of Vygotsky's theory, a transition from a mechanist orientation of his 1920s to an integrative holistic science of the 1930s. During this period, Vygotsky was under particularly strong influence of holistic theories of German-American group of proponents of [[Gestalt psychology]], most notably, the peripheral participants of the Gestalt movement [[Kurt Goldstein]] and [[Kurt Lewin]]. However, Vygotsky's work of this period remained largely fragmentary and unfinished and, therefore, unpublished.\n\n====Zone of Proximal Development====\n\"[[Zone of Proximal Development]]\" (ZPD) is a term Vygotsky used to characterize an individual\u2019s mental development. He originally defined the ZPD as \u201cthe distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers.\u201d<ref name=\"vygoBubble\" /> He used the example of two children in school who originally could solve problems at an eight-year-old developmental level (that is, typical for children who were age 8). After each child received assistance from an adult, one was able to perform at a nine-year-old level and one was able to perform at a twelve-year-old level. He said \u201cThis difference between twelve and eight, or between nine and eight, is what we call ''the zone of proximal development.''\u201d<ref name=\"vygoBubble\" /> He further said that the ZPD \u201cdefines those functions that have not yet matured but are in the process of maturation, functions that will mature tomorrow but are currently in an embryonic state.\u201d<ref name=\"vygoBubble\" /> The zone is bracketed by the learner's current ability and the ability they can achieve with the aid of an instructor of some capacity.\n\nVygotsky viewed the ZPD as a better way to explain the relation between children's learning and cognitive development. Prior to the ZPD, the relation between learning and development could be boiled down to the following three major positions: 1) Development always precedes learning (e.g., [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]]): children first need to meet a particular maturation level before learning can occur; 2) Learning and development cannot be separated, but instead occur simultaneously (e.g., [[behaviorism]]): essentially, learning is development; and 3) learning and development are separate, but interactive processes (e.g., [[gestaltism]]): one process always prepares the other process, and vice versa. Vygotsky rejected these three major theories because he believed that learning should always precede development in the ZPD. According to Vygotsky, through the assistance of a more knowledgeable other, a child is able to learn skills or aspects of a skill that go beyond the child's actual developmental or maturational level. The lower limit of ZPD is the level of skill reached by the child working independently (also referred to as the child's developmental level). The upper limit is the level of potential skill that the child is able to reach with the assistance of a more capable instructor. In this sense, the ZPD provides a prospective view of cognitive development, as opposed to a retrospective view that characterizes development in terms of a child's independent capabilities. The advancement through and attainment of the upper limit of the ZPD is limited by the instructional and scaffolding-related capabilities of the more knowledgeable other (MKO).  The MKO is typically assumed to be an older, more experienced teacher or parent, but often can be a learner's peer or someone their junior. The MKO need not even be a person, it can be a machine or book, or other source of visual and/or audio input.[https://web.archive.org/web/20190805212531/https://www.simplypsychology.org/vygotsky.html]\n\n====''Thinking and speech''====\nPerhaps Vygotsky's most important contribution concerns the inter-relationship of language development and thought. This problem was explored in Vygotsky's book, ''Thinking and speech'', entitled in Russian, ''Myshlenie i rech'', that was published in 1934. In fact, this book was a mere collection of essays and scholarly papers that Vygotsky wrote during different periods of his thought development and included writings of his \"instrumental\" and \"holistic\" periods. Vygotsky never saw the book published: it was published posthumously, edited by his closest associates (Kolbanovskii, Zankov, and Shif) not sooner than December, 1934, i.e., half a year after his death. The first English translation was published in 1962 (with several later revised editions) heavily abbreviated and under an alternative and incorrect translation of the title ''Thought and Language'' for the Russian title ''Mysl' i iazyk''. The book establishes the explicit and profound connection between speech (both silent inner speech and oral language), and the development of mental concepts and cognitive awareness. Vygotsky described inner speech as being qualitatively different from verbal external speech. Although Vygotsky believed inner speech developed from external speech via a gradual process of \"internalization\" (i.e., transition from the external to the internal), with younger children only really able to \"think out loud\", he claimed that in its mature form, inner speech would not resemble spoken language as we know it (in particular, being greatly compressed). Hence, thought itself developing socially.\n\n===Death (1934) and posthumous fame===\nVygotsky died of [[tuberculosis]] on June 11, 1934, at the age of 37, in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]]. One of Vygotsky's last private notebook entries gives a proverbial, yet very pessimistic self-assessment of his contribution to psychological theory:\n\n<blockquote>This is the final thing I have done in psychology \u2013 and I will like [[Moses]] die at the summit, having glimpsed the promised land but without setting foot on it. Farewell, dear creations. The rest is silence.<ref name=\"revBook\"/></blockquote>\n\nImmediately after his death, Vygotsky was proclaimed one of the leading psychologists in the Soviet Union, although his stellar reputation was somewhat undermined by the decree of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 1936 that denounced the mass movement, discipline, and related social practice of the so-called [[Pedology (children study)|pedology]]. Yet, even despite some criticisms and censorship of his works\u2014most notably, in the post-Stalin era in the Soviet Union of 1960s-1980s by his Russian alleged and self-proclaimed best students and followers\u2014Vygotsky always remained among the most quoted scholars in the field and has become a [[Cult following|cult figure]] for a number of contemporary intellectuals and practitioners in Russia and the international psychological and educational community alike.<ref>Fraser, J. & Yasnitsky, A.

In 1962 a translation of his posthumous 1934 book, ''Thinking and Speech'', published with the title,''Thought and Language'', did not seem to change the situation considerably. It was only after an eclectic compilation of partly rephrased and partly translated works of Vygotsky and his collaborators, published in 1978 under Vygotsky's name as ''Mind in Society'', that the Vygotsky boom started in the West: originally, in North America, and later, following the North American example, spread to other regions of the world. This version of Vygotskian science is typically associated with the names of its chief proponents Michael Cole, [[James Wertsch]], their associates and followers, and is relatively well known under the names of \"[[cultural-historical activity theory]]\" (aka CHAT) or\u2014yet more distant from Vygotsky's legacy\u2014\"[[activity theory]]\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Roth|first=W.M.|author2=Lee, J.Y. |title=\"Vygotsky's Neglected Legacy\": Cultural Historical Activity Theory|journal=Review of Educational Research|date=June 2007|volume=77|issue=2|doi=10.3102/0034654306298273|pages=186\u2013232|url=http://lchc.ucsd.edu/MCA/Mail/xmcamail.2007_06.dir/att-0021/Wolff-Michael_Roth_Vygotsky.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.584.7175}}</ref><ref name=\"toomela1\">{{cite journal | last1 = Toomela | first1 = A | year = 2000 | title = Activity theory is a dead end for cultural-historical psychology | url = | journal = Culture & Psychology | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 353\u2013364 | doi=10.1177/1354067x0063005}}</ref><ref  name=\"toomela2\">{{cite journal | last1 = Toomela | first1 = A | year = 2008 | title = Activity theory is a dead end for methodological thinking in cultural psychology too | url = | journal = Culture & Psychology | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 289\u2013303 | doi=10.1177/1354067x08088558}}</ref> [[Instructional scaffolding|Scaffolding]], a concept introduced by Wood, [[Jerome Bruner|Bruner]], and Ross in 1976, is somewhat related to the idea of ZPD, although Vygotsky never used the term.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = D.

In 1799, the metre was redefined in terms of a prototype metre bar (the actual bar used was changed in 1889). In 1960, the metre was redefined in terms of a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of [[krypton-86]]. In 1983, the current definition was adopted.\n\n== Spelling ==\n''Metre'' is the standard spelling of the metric unit for length in nearly all English-speaking nations except the United States<ref>The most recent official brochure about the International System of Units (SI), written in French by the ''{{lang|fr|Bureau international des poids et mesures}}'', [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) uses the spelling ''metre''; an English translation, included to make the SI standard more widely accessible also uses the spelling ''metre'' ([[#bipm2006|BIPM, 2006]], p. 130''ff''). However, in 2008 the U.S. English translation published by the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) chose to use the spelling ''meter'' in accordance with the United States Government Printing Office Style Manual. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 gives the Secretary of Commerce of the US the responsibility of interpreting or modifying the SI for use in the US. The Secretary of Commerce delegated this authority to the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology ([[#turner|Turner]]). In 2008, NIST published the US version ([[#taylor2008a|Taylor and Thompson, 2008a]]) of the English text of the eighth edition of the BIPM publication ''{{lang|fr|Le Syst\u00e8me international d'unit\u00e9s}} (SI)'' (BIPM, 2006). In the NIST publication, the spellings \"meter\", \"liter\" and \"deka\" are used rather than \"metre\", \"litre\" and \"deca\" as in the original BIPM English text ([[#taylor2008a|Taylor and Thompson (2008a), p. iii]]). The Director of the NIST officially recognised this publication, together with [[#taylor2008b|Taylor and Thompson (2008b)]], as the \"legal interpretation\" of the SI for the United States ([[#turner|Turner]]). Thus, the spelling ''metre'' is referred to as the \"international spelling\"; the spelling ''meter'', as the \"American spelling\".</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/Spelling_metre_or_meter.pdf |title=Spelling metre or meter |first=Pat |last=Naughtin |website=Metrication Matters |year=2008 |access-date=12 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://grammarist.com/spelling/meter-metre/ |title=Meter vs. metre |website=Grammarist |access-date=12 March 2017}}</ref> and the Philippines,<ref>The Philippines uses [[Philippine English|English]] as an official language and this largely follows American English since the country became a colony of the United States.

This range of uses is also found in Latin (''metior'', ''mensura''), French (''m\u00e8tre'', ''mesure''), English and other languages.

The [[Metre Convention]] (''Convention du M\u00e8tre'') of 1875 mandated the establishment of a permanent [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM: ''{{lang|fr|Bureau International des Poids et Mesures}}'') to be located in [[S\u00e8vres]], France. This new organisation was to construct and preserve a prototype metre bar, distribute national metric prototypes, and maintain comparisons between them and non-metric measurement standards. The organisation distributed such bars in 1889 at the first [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM: ''{{lang|fr|Conf\u00e9rence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Poids et Mesures}}''), establishing the ''[[International Prototype Metre]]'' as the distance between two lines on a standard bar composed of an alloy of 90% [[platinum]] and 10% [[iridium]], measured at the melting point of ice.<ref>[[#nistmetre|National Institute of Standards and Technology 2003; Historical context of the SI: Unit of length (meter)]]</ref>\n\nThe comparison of the new prototypes of the metre with each other and with the Committee metre (French: ''[[M\u00e8tre des Archives]]'') involved the development of special measuring equipment and the definition of a reproducible temperature scale. The BIPM's [[Temperature measurement|thermometry]] work led to the discovery of special alloys of iron-nickel, in particular [[invar]], for which its director, the Swiss physicist [[Charles \u00c9douard Guillaume|Charles-Edouard Guillaume]], was granted the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for physics]] in 1920.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/fr/measurement-units/history-si/evolution_metre.html|title=BIPM \u2013 la d\u00e9finition du m\u00e8tre|website=www.bipm.org|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref>\n\n[[File:GPS-IIR.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a GPS-IIR satellite in orbit.|alt=|left]]\n\nAs [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero]] stated, the progress of [[metrology]] combined with those of [[gravimetry]] through improvement of [[Kater's pendulum]] led to a new era of [[geodesy]]. If precision metrology had needed the help of geodesy, the latter could not continue to prosper without the help of metrology. Indeed, how to express all the measurements of terrestrial arcs as a function of a single unit, and all the determinations of the force of gravity with the [[Seconds pendulum|pendulum]], if metrology had not created a common unit, adopted and respected by all civilized nations, and if in addition one had not compared, with great precision, to the same unit all the standards for measuring geodesic bases, and all the pendulum rods that had hitherto been used or would be used in the future? Only when this series of metrological comparisons would be finished with a probable error of a thousandth of a millimetre would geodesy be able to link the works of the different nations with one another, and then proclaim the result of the last measurement of the Globe. As the [[figure of the Earth]] could be inferred from variations of the [[seconds pendulum]] length with [[latitude]], the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|United States Coast Survey]] instructed [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] in the spring of 1875 to proceed to Europe for the purpose of making pendulum experiments to chief initial stations for operations of this sort, in order to bring the determinations of the forces of gravity in America into communication with those of other parts of the world; and also for the purpose of making a careful study of the methods of pursuing these researches in the different countries of Europe. In 1886 the association of geodesy changed name for the [[International Association of Geodesy|International Geodetic Association]], which [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero]] presided up to his death in 1891. During this period the [[International Association of Geodesy|International Geodetic Association]] (German: ''Internationale Erdmessung'') gained worldwide importance with the joining of [[United States]], [[Mexico]], [[Chile]], [[Argentina]] and [[Japan]].<ref name=\"Soler\"/><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.rac.es/ficheros/Discursos/DR_20080825_173.pdf|title=Discursos leidos ante la Real Academia de Ciencias Exactas Fisicas y Naturales en la recepcion p\u00fablica de Don Joaquin Barraquer y Rovira|last=Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero|first=Carlos|publisher=Imprenta de la Viuda e Hijo de D.E.

In 1799, the metre was redefined in terms of a prototype metre bar (the actual bar used was changed in 1889). In 1960, the metre was redefined in terms of a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of [[krypton-86]]. In 1983, the current definition was adopted.\n\n== Spelling ==\n''Metre'' is the standard spelling of the metric unit for length in nearly all English-speaking nations except the United States<ref>The most recent official brochure about the International System of Units (SI), written in French by the ''{{lang|fr|Bureau international des poids et mesures}}'', [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) uses the spelling ''metre''; an English translation, included to make the SI standard more widely accessible also uses the spelling ''metre'' ([[#bipm2006|BIPM, 2006]], p. 130''ff''). However, in 2008 the U.S. English translation published by the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) chose to use the spelling ''meter'' in accordance with the United States Government Printing Office Style Manual. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 gives the Secretary of Commerce of the US the responsibility of interpreting or modifying the SI for use in the US. The Secretary of Commerce delegated this authority to the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology ([[#turner|Turner]]). In 2008, NIST published the US version ([[#taylor2008a|Taylor and Thompson, 2008a]]) of the English text of the eighth edition of the BIPM publication ''{{lang|fr|Le Syst\u00e8me international d'unit\u00e9s}} (SI)'' (BIPM, 2006). In the NIST publication, the spellings \"meter\", \"liter\" and \"deka\" are used rather than \"metre\", \"litre\" and \"deca\" as in the original BIPM English text ([[#taylor2008a|Taylor and Thompson (2008a), p. iii]]). The Director of the NIST officially recognised this publication, together with [[#taylor2008b|Taylor and Thompson (2008b)]], as the \"legal interpretation\" of the SI for the United States ([[#turner|Turner]]). Thus, the spelling ''metre'' is referred to as the \"international spelling\"; the spelling ''meter'', as the \"American spelling\".</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/Spelling_metre_or_meter.pdf |title=Spelling metre or meter |first=Pat |last=Naughtin |website=Metrication Matters |year=2008 |access-date=12 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://grammarist.com/spelling/meter-metre/ |title=Meter vs. metre |website=Grammarist |access-date=12 March 2017}}</ref> and the Philippines,<ref>The Philippines uses [[Philippine English|English]] as an official language and this largely follows American English since the country became a colony of the United States.

This range of uses is also found in Latin (''metior'', ''mensura''), French (''m\u00e8tre'', ''mesure''), English and other languages.  The motto ''\u039c\u0395\u03a4\u03a1\u03a9 \u03a7\u03a1\u03a9'' (metro chro) in the seal of the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM), which was a saying of the Greek statesman and philosopher [[Pittacus of Mytilene]] and may be translated as \"Use measure!\", thus calls for both measurement and moderation.

The [[Metre Convention]] (''Convention du M\u00e8tre'') of 1875 mandated the establishment of a permanent [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM: ''{{lang|fr|Bureau International des Poids et Mesures}}'') to be located in [[S\u00e8vres]], France. This new organisation was to construct and preserve a prototype metre bar, distribute national metric prototypes, and maintain comparisons between them and non-metric measurement standards. The organisation distributed such bars in 1889 at the first [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM: ''{{lang|fr|Conf\u00e9rence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Poids et Mesures}}''), establishing the ''[[International Prototype Metre]]'' as the distance between two lines on a standard bar composed of an alloy of 90% [[platinum]] and 10% [[iridium]], measured at the melting point of ice.<ref>[[#nistmetre|National Institute of Standards and Technology 2003; Historical context of the SI: Unit of length (meter)]]</ref>\n\nThe comparison of the new prototypes of the metre with each other and with the Committee metre (French: ''[[M\u00e8tre des Archives]]'') involved the development of special measuring equipment and the definition of a reproducible temperature scale. The BIPM's [[Temperature measurement|thermometry]] work led to the discovery of special alloys of iron-nickel, in particular [[invar]], for which its director, the Swiss physicist [[Charles \u00c9douard Guillaume|Charles-Edouard Guillaume]], was granted the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for physics]] in 1920.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/fr/measurement-units/history-si/evolution_metre.html|title=BIPM - la d\u00e9finition du m\u00e8tre|website=www.bipm.org|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref>\n\n[[File:GPS-IIR.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a GPS-IIR satellite in orbit.|alt=|left]]\n\nAs [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero]] stated, the progress of [[metrology]] combined with those of [[gravimetry]] through improvement of [[Kater's pendulum]] led to a new era of [[geodesy]]. If precision metrology had needed the help of geodesy, the latter could not continue to prosper without the help of metrology. Indeed, how to express all the measurements of terrestrial arcs as a function of a single unit, and all the determinations of the force of gravity with the [[Seconds pendulum|pendulum]], if metrology had not created a common unit, adopted and respected by all civilized nations, and if in addition one had not compared, with great precision, to the same unit all the standards for measuring geodesic bases, and all the pendulum rods that had hitherto been used or would be used in the future? Only when this series of metrological comparisons would be finished with a probable error of a thousandth of a millimetre would geodesy be able to link the works of the different nations with one another, and then proclaim the result of the last measurement of the Globe. As the [[figure of the Earth]] could be inferred from variations of the [[seconds pendulum]] length with [[latitude]], the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|United States Coast Survey]] instructed [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] in the spring of 1875 to proceed to Europe for the purpose of making pendulum experiments to chief initial stations for operations of this sort, in order to bring the determinations of the forces of gravity in America into communication with those of other parts of the world; and also for the purpose of making a careful study of the methods of pursuing these researches in the different countries of Europe. In 1886 the association of geodesy changed name for the [[International Association of Geodesy|International Geodetic Association]], which [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero]] presided up to his death in 1891.

However, the International Prototype Metre remained the standard until 1960, when the eleventh CGPM defined the metre in the new [[International System of Units]] (SI) as equal to {{val|1650763.73}} [[wavelength]]s of the [[orange (colour)|orange]]-[[red]] [[emission line]] in the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] of the [[krypton-86]] [[atom]] in a [[vacuum]].<ref name=\"Marion\">{{cite book |last=Marion |first=Jerry B. |title=Physics For Science and Engineering |year=1982 |publisher=CBS College Publishing |isbn=978-4-8337-0098-6 |page=3}}</ref>\n\n=== Speed of light definition ===\nTo further reduce uncertainty, the 17th CGPM in 1983 replaced the definition of the metre with its current definition, thus fixing the length of the metre in terms of the [[second]] and the [[speed of light]]:<ref name=\"Res1\" />\n\n::The metre is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of {{sfrac|1|299 792 458}} of a second.\n\nThis definition fixed the speed of light in [[vacuum]] at exactly {{val|299792458}} metres per second (\u2248{{val|300000|u=km/s}}).

Google's [[Larry Page]] revealed that 30 percent of requests received by Google since the ruling was made were categorized as \"other\". Wales explained in email responses that he was contacted by Google on May 28, 2014, and \"The remit of the committee is to hold public hearings and issue recommendations\u2014not just to Google but to legislators and the public.\"<ref name=\"Nat\"/> When asked about his view on the ECJ's \"right to be forgotten\" ruling, Wales replied:\n\n<blockquote>I think the decision will have no impact on people's [[right to privacy]], because I don't regard truthful information in court records published by court order in a newspaper to be private information. If anything, the decision is likely to simply muddle the interesting philosophical questions and make it more difficult to make real progress on privacy issues. In the case of truthful, non-defamatory information obtained legally, I think there is no possibility of any defensible \"right\" to censor what other people are saying. It is important to avoid language like \"data\" because we aren't talking about \"data\"\u2014we are talking about the suppression of knowledge.<ref name=\"Nat\"/></blockquote>\n\nWales then provided further explanation, drawing a comparison with Wikipedia: \"You do not have a right to use the law to prevent Wikipedia editors from writing truthful information, nor do you have a right to use the law to prevent Google from publishing truthful information.\" Wales concluded with an indication of his ideal outcome: \"A part of the outcome should be the very strong implementation of a right to free speech in Europe\u2014essentially the language of the First Amendment in the U.S.\"<ref name=\"Nat\"/>\n\n===Other issues===\nIn 2012, the [[Home Secretary]] of the U.K. was petitioned by Wales in regard to his opposition to the extradition of [[Richard O'Dwyer]] to the U.S.<ref name=Ball>{{cite news|last=Ball|first=James|title=Wikipedia's founder calls for Richard O'Dwyer extradition to be stopped|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/24/wikipedia-founder-richard-odwyer-extradition-stopped|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=December 26, 2017}}</ref> After an agreement was reached to avoid the extradition, Wales commented, \"This is very exciting news, and I'm pleased to hear it ...

He stated to the BBC that the ruling was \"one of the most wide-sweeping internet censorship rulings that I've ever seen\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Dave|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27407017|title=Google ruling 'astonishing', says Wikipedia founder Wales |publisher=BBC News|date=May 14, 2014|accessdate=December 26, 2017}}</ref> In early June 2014, the ''TechCrunch'' media outlet interviewed Wales on the subject, as he had been invited by Google to join an advisory committee that the corporation had formed as an addition to the formal process that the ECJ requested from Google to manage such requests.<ref name=\"Nat\">{{cite web|last=Lomas|first=Natasha|title=Jimmy Wales Blasts Europe's \"Right To Be Forgotten\" Ruling As A \"Terrible Danger\"|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/07/wales-on-right-to-be-forgotten/?ncid=tcdaily|website=TechCrunch|publisher=AOL Inc|accessdate=June 9, 2014|date=June 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe May 2014 ECJ ruling required swift action from Google to implement a process that allowed people to directly contact the corporation about the removal of information that they believe is outdated or irrelevant. Google's [[Larry Page]] revealed that 30 percent of requests received by Google since the ruling was made were categorized as \"other\". Wales explained in email responses that he was contacted by Google on May 28, 2014, and \"The remit of the committee is to hold public hearings and issue recommendations\u2014not just to Google but to legislators and the public.\"<ref name=\"Nat\"/> When asked about his view on the ECJ's \"right to be forgotten\" ruling, Wales replied:\n\n<blockquote>I think the decision will have no impact on people's [[right to privacy]], because I don't regard truthful information in court records published by court order in a newspaper to be private information. If anything, the decision is likely to simply muddle the interesting philosophical questions and make it more difficult to make real progress on privacy issues. In the case of truthful, non-defamatory information obtained legally, I think there is no possibility of any defensible \"right\" to censor what other people are saying. It is important to avoid language like \"data\" because we aren't talking about \"data\"\u2014we are talking about the suppression of knowledge.<ref name=\"Nat\"/></blockquote>\n\nWales then provided further explanation, drawing a comparison with Wikipedia: \"You do not have a right to use the law to prevent Wikipedia editors from writing truthful information, nor do you have a right to use the law to prevent Google from publishing truthful information.\" Wales concluded with an indication of his ideal outcome: \"A part of the outcome should be the very strong implementation of a right to free speech in Europe\u2014essentially the language of the First Amendment in the U.S.\"<ref name=\"Nat\"/>\n\n===Other issues===\nIn 2012, the [[Home Secretary]] of the U.K. was petitioned by Wales in regard to his opposition to the extradition of [[Richard O'Dwyer]] to the U.S.<ref name=Ball>{{cite news|last=Ball|first=James|title=Wikipedia's founder calls for Richard O'Dwyer extradition to be stopped|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/24/wikipedia-founder-richard-odwyer-extradition-stopped|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=December 26, 2017}}</ref> After an agreement was reached to avoid the extradition, Wales commented, \"This is very exciting news, and I'm pleased to hear it ...
