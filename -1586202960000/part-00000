It is suggested that the mention of a specific sorceress Pimeku, her death and successive conflict, is related to some socio-political challenges of the ancient [[Matriarchy|matriarchal system]].{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\nThe first certain mention of the islands and its people by the Chinese and Japanese is dated in the 7th century. [[Emperor Yang of Sui]], due to previous tradition, between 607-608 held expeditions in search of the \"Land of Happy Immortals\". As the Chinese envoy and the islanders linguistically could not understand each other, and the islanders did not want to accept the Sui rule and suzerainty, the Chinese envoy took many captives back to the court. The islands, by the Chinese named Liuqiu, would be pronounced by the Japanese as Ryukyu. However, when the Japanese diplomat [[Ono no Imoko]] arrived at the Chinese capital he noted that the captives probably arrived from the island of [[Yakushima|Yaku]] south of Kyushu. In 616 the Japanese annals for the first time mention the \"Southern Islands people\", and for the half-century were noted some intruders from Yaku and [[Tanu Province|Tanu]]. According to ''[[Shoku Nihongi]]'', in 698 a small force dispatched by Japanese government successfully claimed the [[Tanegashima|Tane-jima]], Yakushima, [[Amami Islands|Amami]], [[Tokunoshima]] and other islands.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} ''Nihongi'' recorded that the [[Hayato people]] in southern Kyushu still had female chieftains in the early 8th century. In 699 are mentioned islands Amami and [[Tokara Islands|Tokara]], in 714 Shingaki and [[Kume Island|Kume]], in 720 some 232 persons who had submitted to the Japanese capital Nara, and at last Okinawa in 753.

The tradition states that the founder of [[Tenson Dynasty]] was a descendant of goddess [[Amamikyu]], and the dynasty ruled 17,000 years and had 25 kings i.e. chieftains. However, the 24th throne was usurped from one of Tenson's descendants by a man named Riyu, who was defeated in revolt led by [[Shunten]] (1187 \u2013 1237), lord of [[Urasoe Castle|Urasoe]]. Shunten's parental origin is a matter of debate, according to 17th century romantic tales he was a son of a local Okinawan chief's (''[[Aji (Ryukyu)|anji]]'') daughter and some Japanese adventurer, usually considered [[Minamoto no Tametomo]], while historical and archeological-traditional evidence indicate men from the defeated [[Taira clan]] who fled Minamoto's clan vengeance. [[Shunten Dynasty]] made two additional chieftains, [[Shunbajunki]] (1237-1248) and [[Gihon (Ryukyu)|Gihon]] (1248\u20131259). As Gihon abdicated, his [[sessei]] [[Eiso (Ryukyu)|Eiso]] (1260\u20131299), who claimed Tenson's descent, founded the [[List of monarchs of Ryukyu Islands#Eiso Dynasty|Eiso Dynasty]].{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\nDuring the [[History of the Ryukyu Islands#Gusuku period|Gusuku period]] (c. 1187\u20131314), with recent chronology dated from c. 900-950 CE,{{sfn|Pellard|2015|p=21}}{{sfn|Robbeets|2015|p=28}} Okinawans made significant political, social and economical growth. As the center of power moved away from the seashore to inland, the period is named after many ''[[gusuku]]'', castle-like fortifications which were built in higher places.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=38}} This period is also notable, compared to mainland Japan, for fairly late introduction of agricultural production of rice, wheat, [[millet]] and the overseas trading of these goods,{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=38}}<ref name=\"Hammer2006\"/><ref name=\"Shinoda2013\"/> as well during Shubanjunki's rule the introduction of Japanese [[kana]] writing system in its older and simple phonetic form.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} After the years of famine and epidemic during the Gihon's rule, Eiso introduced regular taxation system (of weapons, grains and cloth) in 1264 and as the government gained strength, the control extended from Okinawa toward the islands of Kume, Kerama, Iheya, and Amami \u014cshima (1266). Between 1272 and 1274, as the [[Mongol invasions of Japan]] began, Okinawa on two occasions rejected the Mongols' authority demands.

The status of women in traditional society is higher than in China and Japan. Although the contemporary kinship system is patrilineal and [[Patrilocal residence|patrilocal]], until the 20th century it was often bilateral and [[Matrilocal residence|matrilocal]], with common village endogamy.{{sfn|Sered|1996|p=54\u201355}} [[Shisa]] statues can often be seen on or in front of houses\u2014this relates to the ancient Ryukyuan belief that the male spirit is the spirit of the outside and the female spirit is the spirit of the inside.

The noro's duty was to preserve the generational fire in the hearth, a communal treasure, resulting with tabu system about the fire custodian in which they had to be virgins to maintain close communication with the ancestors. The office became hereditary, usually of the noro's brother's female child. The center of worship was represented by three heartstones within or near the house.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} The belief in the spiritual predominance of the sister was more prominent in Southern Ryukyus.{{sfn|Sered|1996|p=41}}\n\nThe introduction of Buddhism is ascribed to a 13th century priest from Japan (mostly funeral rites{{sfn|Sered|1996|p=41}}), while the 14th century trade relations resulted with [[Korean Buddhism]] influences (including some in architecture), as well Shinto practices from Japan.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} Buddhism and native religion were ideological basis until 18th century, when [[Confucianism]] gradually and officially became government ideology during [[Sh\u014d On]] (1795\u20131802), much to the dismay of [[Kumemura]].{{sfn|Smits|2004|p=240}} It was mostly important to the upper class families.{{sfn|Sered|1996|p=41}} Among the Catholic converts was not lost the former religious consciousness.{{sfn|Sered|1996|p=41}}\n\nUntil the 18th century, the Ryukyuan kings visited the [[Sefa-utaki]] (historical sacred place) caves for worship. Another traditional sacred places are springs Ukinju-Hain-ju, where was placed the first rice plantation, and small island Kudaka, where the \"five fruits and grains\" were introduced by divine people, perhaps strangers with agricultural techniques.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} The foremost account, which claimed common origin between the Japanese and Ryukyuan people, was made-up by [[Sh\u014d Sh\u014dken]] in the 17th century, to end up the pilgrimage of the Ryukyu king and chief priestess to the Kudaka island.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=46}}\n\nDuring the Meiji period the government replaced Buddhism with Shintoism as the islands' state religion,{{sfn|Caprio|2014|p=66}} and ordered; rearrangement of statues and redesign of shrines and temples to incorporate native deities into national Shinto pantheon; Shinto worship preceded native, Buddhist, or Christian ritual; transformation of local divinities into guardian gods.{{sfn|Rabson|2007|p=4}} In the 1920s was ordered building of Shinto shrines and remodelling of previous with Shinto architectural symbols, paid by local tax money, which was a financial burden due to the collapse of sugar prices in 1921 which devastated Okinawa's economy.{{sfn|Rabson|2007|p=5}} In 1932 were ordered to house and support Shinto clergy from the mainland.{{sfn|Rabson|2007|p=5}}\n\nMost Ryukyuans of the younger generations are not serious adherents of the native religion anymore. Additionally, since being under Japanese control, [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhism]] are also practiced and typically mixed with local beliefs and practices.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{main|Okinawan cuisine}}\n\nOkinawan food is rich in [[vitamin]]s and [[minerals]] and is a good balance of [[protein]], [[fat]]s, and [[carbohydrate]]s. Although [[rice]] is a [[staple food]] ([[taco rice]] mixes it with beef), [[pork]] (''[[Pig's ear (food)#Okinawan (Japanese) cuisine|mimigaa and chiragaa]]'', dishes [[Rafute]] and [[Soki]]), [[Edible seaweed|seaweed]], rich [[miso]] (fermented [[soybean]]) pastes and soups ([[Zosui|J\u016bsh\u012b]]), [[sweet potato]] and [[brown sugar]] all feature prominently in native cuisine. Most famous to tourists is the ''[[Momordica charantia]]'', ''g\u014dya'' (bitter melon), which is often mixed into a representative Okinawan [[Stir frying|stir fry]] dish known as [[Chanpuru|champur\u016b]] ([[Goya champuru]]). [[K\u014dr\u0113gusu]] is a common [[hot sauce]] [[condiment]] used in various dishes including [[noodle soup]] [[Okinawa soba]]. Some specifically consumed algae include [[Caulerpa lentillifera]]. Traditional sweets include [[chinsuko]], [[hirayachi]], [[sata andagi]], and [[muchi]]. Local beverages include juice from ''[[Citrus depressa]]'', [[turmeric tea]] (''ukoncha''), and the alcoholic beverage [[awamori]].\n\nThe weight-loss [[Okinawa diet]] derives from their cuisine and has only 30% of the sugar and 15% of the grains of the average Japanese dietary intake.<ref name=\"Willcox2007\">{{Citation  |last=Willcox |first=B.

Although unrecognized, Ryukyuans constitute the largest [[Ethnolinguistic group|ethnolinguistic]] minority group in Japan, with 1.3 million living in Okinawa Prefecture alone. Ryukyuans inhabit the [[Amami Islands]] of Kagoshima Prefecture as well. There is also a considerable [[Ryukyuan diaspora]]. As many as 600,000 more ethnic Ryukyuans and their descendants are dispersed elsewhere in Japan and worldwide; most commonly in [[Brazil]] and, to a lesser extent, in other territories where there is also a sizable [[Japanese diaspora]]. In the majority of countries, the Ryukyuan and Japanese diaspora are not differentiated so there are no reliable [[statistics]] for the former.\n\nRecent genetic and [[Anthropology|anthropological]] studies indicate that the Ryukyuans are significantly related to the [[Yamato people]] (mainland Japanese) but have also a relative closer relation to the [[Ainu people]], compared with the Yamato people. This is possibly explained with partially shared ancestry of the population during the [[J\u014dmon period]] (pre 10,000 BCE \u2013 1,000 BCE) and with the population of the [[Yayoi period]] (1,000 BCE \u2013 300 CE), which were migrants from other parts of [[East Asia]] (specifically [[China]] and the [[Korean peninsula]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Saitou|first=Naruya|last2=Tokunaga|first2=Katsushi|last3=Omoto|first3=Keiichi|last4=Niikawa|first4=Norio|last5=Yanagi|first5=Kumiko|last6=Naritomi|first6=Kenji|last7=Kaname|first7=Tadashi|last8=Suto|first8=Yumiko|last9=Mano|first9=Shuhei|date=December 2012|title=The history of human populations in the Japanese Archipelago inferred from genome-wide SNP data with a special reference to the Ainu and the Ryukyuan populations|journal=Journal of Human Genetics|volume=57|issue=12|pages=787\u2013795|doi=10.1038/jhg.2012.114|pmid=23135232|issn=1435-232X}}</ref>\n\nThe Ryukyuans have a specific culture with some [[matriarchal]] elements, native [[Ryukyuan religion|religion]], and [[Okinawan cuisine|cuisine]] which had fairly late (12th century) introduction of [[rice]].

According to the ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas|Shan Hai Jing]]'', the Yan had relations with the [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]] (dwarf, short) people living southeast of Korea, who could be related to both the mainland Japanese or Ryukyuan people.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} The futile search for the elixir of immortality by [[Qin Shi Huang]], the founder of [[Qin dynasty]] (221 BC\u2013206 BC), in which the emperor tried to cooperate with \"happy immortals\" who dwelt on the islands, could be related to both Japan and Ryukyu Islands.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} There's lack of evidence that the missions by [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC \u2013 220 AD) reached the islands, however as the Japanese did reach Han's [[Luoyang|capital]], notes from 57 CE do mention a general practice of tattooing among the people of \"hundred kingdoms\" in the eastern islands, a practice which was widespread and survived only among the Okinawan's women, Ainu in Hokkaido, and [[Atayal people]] in Taiwan.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} [[Cao Wei]] (220\u2013265) and Han dynasty record show that the inhabitants of western and southern Japan and Okinawa had a lot in common regarding political-social institutions until the 2nd century CE - they were of small stature, bred [[oxen]] and [[swine]], as well were ruled by women, with special influence of women sorceresses, which is related to the Ryukyuan [[Noro (priestess)|Noro]] priestesses which were closely associated with local political power until the 20th century, as well the Ryukyuan swine economy culture until World War II. It is suggested that the mention of a specific sorceress Pimeku, her death and successive conflict, is related to some socio-political challenges of the ancient [[Matriarchy|matriarchal system]].{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\nThe first certain mention of the islands and its people by the Chinese and Japanese is dated in the 7th century. [[Emperor Yang of Sui]], due to previous tradition, between 607-608 held expeditions in search of the \"Land of Happy Immortals\". As the Chinese envoy and the islanders linguistically could not understand each other, and the islanders did not want to accept the Sui rule and suzerainty, the Chinese envoy took many captives back to the court. The islands, by the Chinese named Liuqiu, would be pronounced by the Japanese as Ryukyu. However, when the Japanese diplomat [[Ono no Imoko]] arrived at the Chinese capital he noted that the captives probably arrived from the island of [[Yakushima|Yaku]] south of Kyushu. In 616 the Japanese annals for the first time mention the \"Southern Islands people\", and for the half-century were noted some intruders from Yaku and [[Tanu Province|Tanu]]. According to ''[[Shoku Nihongi]]'', in 698 a small force dispatched by Japanese government successfully claimed the [[Tanegashima|Tane-jima]], Yakushima, [[Amami Islands|Amami]], [[Tokunoshima]] and other islands.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} ''Nihongi'' recorded that the [[Hayato people]] in southern Kyushu still had female chieftains in the early 8th century. In 699 are mentioned islands Amami and [[Tokara Islands|Tokara]], in 714 Shingaki and [[Kume Island|Kume]], in 720 some 232 persons who had submitted to the Japanese capital Nara, and at last Okinawa in 753. Nevertheless the mention or authority, over the centuries the Japanese influence spread slowly among the communities.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\n===Gusuku period===\n[[Image:Nakijinjyousi2.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[gusuku]]'' fortification are on the [[Gusuku Sites and Related Properties of the Kingdom of Ryukyu]] UNESCO's list.]]\n\nThe lack of written record resulted with later, 17th century royal tales both under Chinese and Japanese influence, which were efforts by local chieftains to explain the \"[[divine right of kings|divine right]]\" of their royal authority, as well the then-political interests of Tokugawa ''sh\u014dguns'' from [[Minamoto clan]] who wanted to legitimize Japanese domination over Okinawa. The tradition states that the founder of [[Tenson Dynasty]] was a descendant of goddess [[Amamikyu]], and the dynasty ruled 17,000 years and had 25 kings i.e. chieftains. However, the 24th throne was usurped from one of Tenson's descendants by a man named Riyu, who was defeated in revolt led by [[Shunten]] (1187 \u2013 1237), lord of [[Urasoe Castle|Urasoe]]. Shunten's parental origin is a matter of debate, according to 17th century romantic tales he was a son of a local Okinawan chief's (''[[Aji (Ryukyu)|anji]]'') daughter and some Japanese adventurer, usually considered [[Minamoto no Tametomo]], while historical and archeological-traditional evidence indicate men from the defeated [[Taira clan]] who fled Minamoto's clan vengeance. [[Shunten Dynasty]] made two additional chieftains, [[Shunbajunki]] (1237-1248) and [[Gihon (Ryukyu)|Gihon]] (1248\u20131259). As Gihon abdicated, his [[sessei]] [[Eiso (Ryukyu)|Eiso]] (1260\u20131299), who claimed Tenson's descent, founded the [[List of monarchs of Ryukyu Islands#Eiso Dynasty|Eiso Dynasty]].{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\nDuring the [[History of the Ryukyu Islands#Gusuku period|Gusuku period]] (c. 1187\u20131314), with recent chronology dated from c. 900-950 CE,{{sfn|Pellard|2015|p=21}}{{sfn|Robbeets|2015|p=28}} Okinawans made significant political, social and economical growth. As the center of power moved away from the seashore to inland, the period is named after many ''[[gusuku]]'', castle-like fortifications which were built in higher places.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=38}} This period is also notable, compared to mainland Japan, for fairly late introduction of agricultural production of rice, wheat, [[millet]] and the overseas trading of these goods,{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=38}}<ref name=\"Hammer2006\"/><ref name=\"Shinoda2013\"/> as well during Shubanjunki's rule the introduction of Japanese [[kana]] writing system in its older and simple phonetic form.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} After the years of famine and epidemic during the Gihon's rule, Eiso introduced regular taxation system (of weapons, grains and cloth) in 1264 and as the government gained strength, the control extended from Okinawa toward the islands of Kume, Kerama, Iheya, and Amami \u014cshima (1266). Between 1272 and 1274, as the [[Mongol invasions of Japan]] began, Okinawa on two occasions rejected the Mongols' authority demands. To Eiso's reign period is also ascribed the introduction of [[Buddhism]] into Okinawa.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\n===Sanzan period===\n{{Main|Sanzan period|Ryukyuan missions to Imperial China}}\n[[File:Ryukyu Kingdoms of Sanzan era.jpg|thumb|right|Map of [[Okinawa Island]], showing the [[Sanzan period]] polities.]]\nDuring the rule of Eiso's great-grandson, [[Tamagusuku]] (1314\u20131336), Okinawa became divided into three [[polities]] and began the so-called [[Sanzan period]] (1314\u20131429). The north and largest [[Hokuzan]] polity was the poorest due to forest and mountainous terrain (in which isolation was an advantage), with primitive farming and fishing. The central [[Ch\u016bzan]] polity was the most advantaged due to its developed castle [[town]]s and harbor facilities. The south [[Nanzan]] polity was the smallest, but endured because of good castle positions and sea merchants.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\nIn this period another rapid economical, social and cultural development of Ryukyu began as the polities had developed formal trade relations with Japan, Korea and China. During the [[Satto]]'s reign, Ch\u016bzan made [[Imperial Chinese tributary system|tributary relations]] with China's [[Ming dynasty]] in 1374 as the [[Hongwu Emperor]] sent envoys in 1372 to Okinawa. In the next two decades Ch\u016bzan made nine [[Ryukyuan missions to Imperial China|official missions]] to the Chinese capital, and the formal relations between them endured until 1872 (see [[Imperial Chinese missions to Ryukyu Kingdom]]).{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=39}} Despite significant Chinese economical, cultural and political influence, the polities continued to maintain strong [[autonomy]].{{sfn|Gluck|2008|p=939}}{{sfn|Loo|2014|p=1}} In 1392, all three polities began to send extensive [[Ryukyuan missions to Joseon|missions]] to the Korean [[Joseon]] kingdom. In 1403, Ch\u016bzan made formal relations with the Japanese [[Ashikaga shogunate]], and an [[embassy]] was sent to [[Thailand]] in 1409.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} The contacts with Siam continued even in 1425, and were newly made with places like [[Palembang]] in 1428, [[Java]] in 1430, [[Malacca]] and [[Sumatra]] in 1463.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=39}}\n\nAs in 1371, China initiated its maritime prohibition policy ([[Haijin]]) to Japan, Ryukyu gained a lot from its position as [[intermediary]] in the trade between Japan and China. They shipped horses, [[sulphur]] and seashells to China, from China brought ceramics, copper, and iron, from southeast Asian countries bought tin, ivory, spices (pepper), wood ([[sappanwood]]), which they sold to Japan, Korea or China, as well as transporting Chinese goods to [[Hakata Bay]] from where swords, silver and gold were brought.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=42}}{{sfn|Pellard|2015|p=28}}\n\nIn 1392, 36 Chinese families from [[Fujian]] were invited by the chieftain of Okinawa Island's central polity (Ch\u016bzan) to settle near the port of [[Naha]] and to serve as diplomats, interpreters, and government officials.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=39}} Some consider that many Ryukyuan officials were descended from these Chinese immigrants, being born in China or having Chinese grandfathers.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ka6jNJcX_ygC&pg=PA145&dq=ryukyu+asked+for+thirty+six+families+fujian#v=onepage&q=ryukyu%20asked%20for%20thirty%20six%20families%20fujian&f=false|title=The eunuchs in the Ming dynasty|author=Shih-shan Henry Tsai|year=1996|publisher=SUNY Press|location=|isbn=978-0-7914-2687-6|page=145|accessdate=2011-02-04}}</ref> They assisted the Ryukyuans in advancing their technology and diplomatic relations.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ga-5mPOr2-wC&pg=PR13&dq=ryukyu+asked+for+thirty+six+families+fujian#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The East Asian maritime world 1400-1800: its fabrics of power and dynamics of exchanges|author=Angela Schottenhammer|year=2007|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|location=|isbn=978-3-447-05474-4|page=xiii|accessdate=2011-02-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ddcV_cGegX4C&pg=PA125&dq=ryukyu+asked+for+thirty+six+families+fujian#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Maritime sector, institutions, and sea power of premodern China|author=Gang Deng|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=|isbn=978-0-313-30712-6|page=125|accessdate=2011-02-04}}</ref> From the same year onward Ryukyu was allowed to send official students to China i.e. [[Guozijian]].{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=41}} The tributary relationship with China later became a basis of the 19th century Sino-Japanese disputes about the claims of Okinawa.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\n===Ryukyu Kingdom===\n{{Main|Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryukyuan missions to Edo}}\n[[File:Naha Shuri Castle50s3s4500.jpg|thumb|right|The castle town and [[Ryukyu Kingdom]]'s capital [[Shuri Castle]].]]\n\nBetween 1416 and 1429, Ch\u016bzan chieftain [[Sh\u014d Hashi]] successfully unified the principalities into the [[Ryukyuan Kingdom]] (1429\u20131879) with the [[castle town]] [[Shuri, Okinawa|Shuri]] as royal capital, founded the [[List of monarchs of Ryukyu Islands#The First Sh\u014d Dynasty|First Sh\u014d Dynasty]], and the island continued to prosper through maritime trade, especially tributary relations with the Ming dynasty.<ref name=\"MasamiIto2009\"/> The period of [[Sh\u014d Shin]]'s (1477\u20131526) rule, descendant from the [[List of monarchs of Ryukyu Islands#The First Sh\u014d Dynasty|Second Sh\u014d Dynasty]], is notable for peace and relative prosperity, peak in overseas trade, as well as expansion of the kingdom's firm control to [[Kikaijima]], [[Miyako-jima]] and [[Yaeyama Islands]] (1465\u20131524),{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=115}} while during [[Sh\u014d Sei]] (1526-1555) to [[Amami \u014cshima]] (1537).{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=42}}\n\nAfter the [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b Campaign]] (1586\u20131587) by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], his assistant [[Kamei Korenori]], who was interested in southern trade, wanted to be rewarded with the Ryukyu Islands. A paper [[Hand fan|fan]] found during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u201398)]] mentioning a title \"Kamei, Lord of Ryukyu\", reveals that Hideyoshi at least nominally offered the post although he had no legitimate claim upon the islands. In 1591, Kamei ventured with a force to reclaim the islands, but the [[Shimazu clan]] stopped him as they guarded their special relationship with the Ryukyu kingdom. Hideyoshi was not very concerned about the quarrel because the invasion of Korea was more important in his mind.{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=151\u2013152}} As the Ming's influence weakened due to disorder in China, Japanese established posts in Southeast Asia, and the Europeans (Spanish and Portuguese) arrived, the kingdom's overseas trade began to decline.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=43}}<ref name=\"MasamiIto2009\"/>\n\nIn the early 17th century during the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] (1603\u20131867), the first ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] intended to subject the kingdom to enable intermediary trade with China, and in 1603 ordered the Ryukyuan king to pay his respect to the shogunate. As the king did not react, with the instruction of the ''sh\u014dgun'', the [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma feudal domain]] of the Shimazu clan in [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] incorporated some of kingdom's territory during the 1609 [[Invasion of Ryukyu]]. They nominally let a certain level of autonomy and independence to the kingdom due to Ming's prohibition of trade with the shogunate, but forbade them trade with other countries except China.

Stam, \"Introduction to The Explorers Club Edition,\" ''Matthew A. Henson's Historic Arctic Journey: The Classic Account of One of the World's Greatest Black Explorers''], Globe Pequot, 2009, pp. 3\u20136</ref> He is best known for his participation in the 1908-1909 expedition that claimed to have reached the [[geographic North Pole]] on April 6, 1909. Henson said he was the first of their party to reach the pole.\n\nHenson was born in [[Nanjemoy, Maryland]], to [[sharecropper]] parents who were [[free people of color]] before the Civil War. He spent most of his early life in [[Washington, D.C.]], but left school at the age of twelve to work as a [[cabin boy]]. He later returned to Washington and worked as a salesclerk at a good department store. One of his customers was Robert Peary, who in 1887 hired him as a personal valet. At the time, Peary was working on the [[Nicaragua Canal]].\n\nTheir first Arctic expedition together was [[Peary expedition to Greenland of 1891\u201392|in 1891\u201392]]. Henson served as a navigator and craftsman, and was known as Peary's \"first man\". Like Peary, he studied [[Inuit]] survival techniques. \n\nDuring their 1908\u201309 expedition to Greenland, Henson was one of the six men \u2013 including Peary and four Inuit assistants \u2013 who claimed to have been the first to reach the geographic North Pole. In interviews, Henson identified as the first member of the party to reach what they believed was the pole. Their claim had gained widespread acceptance but in 1989, [[Wally Herbert]] published research that found that their expedition records were unreliable, indicated an implausibly high speed during their final rush for the pole, and that the men could have fallen {{convert|30-60|mi|km}} short of the pole due to navigational errors. \n\nHenson achieved a degree of fame as a result of participating in the expedition, and in 1912 he published a memoir titled ''A Negro Explorer at the North Pole''. As he approached old age, his exploits received renewed attention. In 1937 he was the first African American to be made a life member of [[The Explorers Club]]; in 1948 he was elevated to the club's highest level of membership. In 1944 Henson was awarded the [[Peary Polar Expedition Medal]], and he was received at the White House by Presidents [[Harry Truman]] and [[Dwight Eisenhower]]. In 1988 he and his wife were re-interred at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. In 2000 Henson was posthumously awarded the [[Hubbard Medal]] by the National Geographic Society.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/160224-polar-explorer-matthew-henson-photos/|title=Historic Photos Celebrate Pioneering Black Explorer|last=Howard|first=Brian Clark|date=2018-02-23|website=National Geographic|access-date=2019-01-17}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nHenson was born on August 8, 1866 on his parents' farm east of the Potomac River in [[Charles County, Maryland]], to sharecroppers who had been [[free people of color]] before the [[American Civil War]].<ref name=\"stam\"/><ref name=\"Arlington\">{{cite web|url=https://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Explore/Notable-Graves/Explorers/Matthew-Henson|title=Biography of Matthew Alexander Henson|publisher=Arlington National Cemetery|accessdate=January 18, 2018}}</ref> Matthew's parents were subjected to attacks by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and other white supremacist groups, who terrorized southern freedmen and former free people of color after the Civil War.\n\nTo escape from racial violence in southern Maryland, in 1867 the Henson family sold the farm and moved to Georgetown, then still an independent town adjacent to the national capital.<ref name=\"gilman\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/matthewhenson00gilm|title=Matthew Henson|last=Michael.|first=Gilman|date=1988|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|isbn=1555465900|location=New York|oclc=16581828|url-access=registration}}</ref> He had an older sister S., born in 1864, and two younger sisters Eliza and S.<ref name=\"genealogy\">[http://www.matthewhenson.com/genealogy2.htm Bradley Robinson, \"Matthew Henson genealogy\"], Matthew A.

The uncle paid for a few years of education for Matthew but soon died.<ref name=\"stam\"/> Henson attended a black public school for the next six years, during the last of which he took a summer job washing dishes in a restaurant. His early years were marked by one especially memorable event. When he was 10 years old, he went to a ceremony honoring Abraham Lincoln, the American president who had fought so hard to preserve the Union during the Civil War and had issued the proclamation that had freed slaves in the occupied Confederate states in 1863. At the ceremony, Matthew was greatly inspired by a speech given by [[Frederick Douglass]], an escaped slave and renowned orator, the longtime leading figure in the American black community. Douglass called upon blacks to vigorously pursue educational opportunities and battle racial prejudice.<ref name=\"gilman\" />{{better source|date=March 2018}}\n\nAt the age of twelve, the youth made his way to [[Baltimore, Maryland]], a busy port.

Peary]]. Learning of Henson's sea experience, Peary recruited him as an aide for his planned voyage and surveying expedition to [[Nicaragua]], with four other men. Peary supervised 45 engineers on the canal survey in Nicaragua. Impressed with Henson's seamanship on that voyage, Peary recruited him as a colleague and he became \"first man\" in his expeditions.\n\nAfter that, for more than 20 years, their expeditions were to the [[Arctic]].

Henson's Historic Arctic Journey: The Classic Account of One of the World's Greatest Black Explorers''], Globe Pequot, 2009, pp. 3\u20136</ref> He is best known for his participation in the 1908-1909 expedition that claimed to have reached the [[geographic North Pole]] on April 6, 1909. Henson said he was the first of their party to reach the pole.\n\nHenson was born in [[Nanjemoy, Maryland]], to [[sharecropper]] parents who were [[free people of color]] before the Civil War. He spent most of his early life in [[Washington, D.C.]], but left school at the age of twelve to work as a [[cabin boy]]. He later returned to Washington and worked as a salesclerk at a good department store. One of his customers was Robert Peary, who in 1887 hired him as a personal valet. At the time, Peary was working on the [[Nicaragua Canal]].\n\nTheir first Arctic expedition together was [[Peary expedition to Greenland of 1891\u201392|in 1891\u201392]]. Henson served as a navigator and craftsman, and was known as Peary's \"first man\". Like Peary, he studied [[Inuit]] survival techniques. \n\nDuring their 1908\u201309 expedition to Greenland, Henson was one of the six men \u2013 including Peary and four Inuit assistants \u2013 who claimed to have been the first to reach the geographic North Pole. In interviews, Henson identified as the first member of the party to reach what they believed was the pole. Their claim had gained widespread acceptance but in 1989, [[Wally Herbert]] published research that found that their expedition records were unreliable, indicated an implausibly high speed during their final rush for the pole, and that the men could have fallen {{convert|30-60|mi|km}} short of the pole due to navigational errors. \n\nHenson achieved a degree of fame as a result of participating in the expedition, and in 1912 he published a memoir titled ''A Negro Explorer at the North Pole''. As he approached old age, his exploits received renewed attention. In 1937 he was the first African American to be made a life member of [[The Explorers Club]]; in 1948 he was elevated to the club's highest level of membership. In 1944 Henson was awarded the [[Peary Polar Expedition Medal]], and he was received at the White House by Presidents [[Harry Truman]] and [[Dwight Eisenhower]]. In 1988 he and his wife were re-interred at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. In 2000 Henson was posthumously awarded the [[Hubbard Medal]] by the National Geographic Society.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/160224-polar-explorer-matthew-henson-photos/|title=Historic Photos Celebrate Pioneering Black Explorer|last=Howard|first=Brian Clark|date=2018-02-23|website=National Geographic|access-date=2019-01-17}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nHenson was born on August 8, 1866 on his parents' farm east of the Potomac River in [[Charles County, Maryland]], to sharecroppers who had been [[free people of color]] before the [[American Civil War]].<ref name=\"stam\"/><ref name=\"Arlington\">{{cite web|url=https://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Explore/Notable-Graves/Explorers/Matthew-Henson|title=Biography of Matthew Alexander Henson|publisher=Arlington National Cemetery|accessdate=January 18, 2018}}</ref> Matthew's parents were subjected to attacks by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and other white supremacist groups, who terrorized southern freedmen and former free people of color after the Civil War.\n\nTo escape from racial violence in southern Maryland, in 1867 the Henson family sold the farm and moved to Georgetown, then still an independent town adjacent to the national capital.<ref name=\"gilman\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/matthewhenson00gilm|title=Matthew Henson|last=Michael.|first=Gilman|date=1988|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|isbn=1555465900|location=New York|oclc=16581828|url-access=registration}}</ref> He had an older sister S., born in 1864, and two younger sisters Eliza and S.<ref name=\"genealogy\">[http://www.matthewhenson.com/genealogy2.htm Bradley Robinson, \"Matthew Henson genealogy\"], Matthew A.

His father Lemuel remarried to a woman named Caroline and had additional children with her, including daughters and a son.\n\nAfter his father died, Matthew was sent to live with his uncle, who lived in Washington, D.C. (Georgetown was made part of Washington, DC in 1871.) The uncle paid for a few years of education for Matthew but soon died.<ref name=\"stam\"/> Henson attended a black public school for the next six years, during the last of which he took a summer job washing dishes in a restaurant. His early years were marked by one especially memorable event. When he was 10 years old, he went to a ceremony honoring Abraham Lincoln, the American president who had fought so hard to preserve the Union during the Civil War and had issued the proclamation that had freed slaves in the occupied Confederate states in 1863. At the ceremony, Matthew was greatly inspired by a speech given by [[Frederick Douglass]], an escaped slave and renowned orator, the longtime leading figure in the American black community. Douglass called upon blacks to vigorously pursue educational opportunities and battle racial prejudice.<ref name=\"gilman\" />{{better source|date=March 2018}}\n\nAt the age of twelve, the youth made his way to [[Baltimore, Maryland]], a busy port. He went to sea as a cabin boy on the merchant ship ''Katie Hines,'' traveling to ports in China, Japan, Africa, and the Russian Arctic seas.<ref name=\"gilman\" />{{better source|date=March 2018}} The ship's leader, Captain Childs, took Henson under his wing and taught him to read and write.<ref name=\"stam\"/>\n\n==Exploration==\n[[File:The negro who reached the Pole.jpg|thumb|right|Henson in his Arctic furs]]\nWhile working at a Washington D.C. clothing store, B.H.Stinemetz and Sons, in November 1887, Henson met Commander [[Robert E. Peary]]. Learning of Henson's sea experience, Peary recruited him as an aide for his planned voyage and surveying expedition to [[Nicaragua]], with four other men. Peary supervised 45 engineers on the canal survey in Nicaragua. Impressed with Henson's seamanship on that voyage, Peary recruited him as a colleague and he became \"first man\" in his expeditions.\n\nAfter that, for more than 20 years, their expeditions were to the [[Arctic]]. Henson traded with the [[Inuit]] and mastered {{clarify|text=their language|reason=which Inuit language(s) did he learn?)|date=July 2018}}<ref name=\":0\" />; they called him ''Mahri-Pahluk.''<ref name=\"schorow\"/> He was remembered as the only non-Inuit who became skilled in driving the dog sleds and in training dog teams in the Inuit way.<ref name=\"schorow\"/> He was a skilled craftsman, often coming up with solutions for what the team needed in the harsh Arctic conditions; they learned to build [[igloos]] out of snow, for mobile housing as they traveled.

The expedition was large, as Peary planned to use his system of setting up cached supplies along the way. When he and Henson boarded his ship ''Roosevelt'', leaving Greenland on August 18, 1909, they were accompanied by\n\n{{quote|22 Inuit men, 17 Inuit women, 10 children, 246 dogs, 70 tons (64 metric tons) of whale meat from Labrador, the meat and blubber of 50 walruses, hunting equipment, and tons of coal.

Before the goal was reached, Peary could no longer continue on foot and rode in a dog sled. Various accounts say he was ill, exhausted, or had frozen toes. He sent Henson ahead as a scout.\n\nIn a newspaper interview, Henson later said: \n{{quote|I was in the lead that had overshot the mark a couple of miles.

In 1937 Henson was admitted as a member to the prestigious [[Explorers Club]] in New York City, and made an honorary member in 1948, of whom there are only 20 per year.
