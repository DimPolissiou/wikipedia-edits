The cast included real-life experienced vaudevillian actor [[George Burns]] as Lewis, [[Walter Matthau]] as Clark, and [[Richard Benjamin]] as Ben, with [[Lee Meredith]], [[F. Murray Abraham]], [[Rosetta LeNoire]], [[Howard Hesseman]], and [[Ron Rifkin]] in supporting roles.\n\n==Plot==\nAl Lewis ([[George Burns]]) and Willy Clark ([[Walter Matthau]]) are two elderly comedians who were once a popular vaudeville comedy act known as \"Lewis and Clark\" and also called the Sunshine Boys.  After 47 years together, they parted ways 11 years ago on unfriendly terms and have not spoken to each other since then.  The break-up was due, in part, to Al's intent to retire and Willy's desire to continue performing.  Willy's nephew, Ben ([[Richard Benjamin]]), a talent agent, tries finding work for Willy, which proves difficult due to Willy's age and blustery temperament.\n\nWhen one of the major networks decides to air a program on the history of comedy and wants the Sunshine Boys to reunite for the show, Ben tries securing the duo's cooperation one last time.  Ben tries managing the individual quirks of two old men in their twilight years, including omitting the abuse and insults each used in discussing the other with him, and diplomatically portraying each as anxious to do the \"Doctor Sketch\" for an ABC special to give the appearance of harmony.\n\nAn attempt to rehearse the Doctor Sketch at Willy's apartment starts with the two grudgingly getting re-acquainted, but goes only as far as Al entering the doctor's (Willy's) office, before Willy decides to change the scripted long-established \"Come in\" to \"Enter!\"  This results in a loud shouting argument and Al's stormy departure.\n\nBen has to patch up and salvage the situation, despite the objections of Al's daughter to her father being bothered any more about the special and manages to get them in the studio.  In the dressing room, they do not speak to each other as persons, just like they did in the last year they did their sketches.  There is unpleasantness when Willy carelessly dumps makeup jars on Al, followed by Willy's usual trouble with doors, in the dressing room.\n\nAfter [[Phyllis Diller]] finishes her scene and [[Steve Allen]] speaks his introduction, the Doctor Sketch starts.  It flows smoothly until Willy starts shouting about Al's spitting on him and poking him in the chest.  Despite Ben and the staff trying to restore order, Willy finally storms off the set, shouting accusations and abuse, and Al also leaves (finding it impossible to work with the man).  In the stairwell, Willy's ongoing temper tantrum results in him being felled by a serious heart attack.\n\nWilly recovers, first in the hospital and then at home with a private nurse, with whom he argues.  Ben visits and tells him that he has to retire now.  He has in mind an actor's retirement home.

The cast included real-life experienced vaudevillian actor [[George Burns]] as Lewis, [[Walter Matthau]] as Clark, and [[Richard Benjamin]] as Ben, with [[Lee Meredith]], [[F. Murray Abraham]], [[Rosetta LeNoire]], [[Howard Hesseman]], and [[Ron Rifkin]] in supporting roles.\n\n==Plot==\nAl Lewis ([[George Burns]]) and Willy Clark ([[Walter Matthau]]) are two elderly comedians who were once a popular vaudeville comedy act known as \"Lewis and Clark\" and also called the Sunshine Boys.  After 47 years together, they parted ways 11 years ago on unfriendly terms and have not spoken to each other since then.  The break-up was due, in part, to Al's intent to retire and Willy's desire to continue performing.  Willy's nephew, Ben ([[Richard Benjamin]]), a talent agent, tries finding work for Willy, which proves difficult due to Willy's age and blustery temperament.\n\nWhen one of the major networks decides to air a program on the history of comedy and wants the Sunshine Boys to reunite for the show, Ben tries securing the duo's cooperation one last time.  Ben tries managing the individual quirks of two old men in their twilight years, including omitting the abuse and insults each used in discussing the other with him, and diplomatically portraying each as anxious to do the \"Doctor Sketch\" for an ABC special to give the appearance of harmony.\n\nAn attempt to rehearse the Doctor Sketch at Willy's apartment starts with the two grudgingly getting re-acquainted, but goes only as far as Al entering the doctor's (Willy's) office, before Willy decides to change the scripted long-established \"Come in\" to \"Enter!\"  This results in a loud shouting argument and Al's stormy departure.\n\nBen has to patch up and salvage the situation, despite the objections of Al's daughter to her father being bothered any more about the special and manages to get them in the studio.  In the dressing room, they do not speak to each other as persons, just like they did in the last year they did their sketches.  There is unpleasantness when Willy carelessly dumps makeup jars on Al, followed by Willy's usual trouble with doors, in the dressing room.\n\nAfter [[Phyllis Diller]] finishes her scene and [[Steve Allen]] speaks his introduction, the Doctor Sketch starts.  It flows smoothly until Willy starts shouting about Al's spitting on him and poking him in the chest.  Despite Ben and the staff trying to restore order, Willy finally storms off the set, shouting accusations and abuse, and Al also leaves (finding it impossible to work with the man).  In the stairwell, Willy's ongoing temper tantrum results in him being felled by a serious heart attack.\n\nWilly recovers, first in the hospital and then at home with a private nurse, with whom he argues.  Ben visits and tells him that he has to retire now.  He has in mind an actor's retirement home.  Al is also going to move into the same retirement home, as his daughter is going to have a baby, and she will need his room.  The two meet again at Willy's apartment, in attempts to finally establish a friendship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Walter Matthau]] as Willy Clark\n* [[George Burns]] as Al Lewis\n* [[Richard Benjamin]] as Ben Clark\n* [[Lee Meredith]] as Nurse in Sketch (Miss McIntosh)\n* [[Carol Arthur]] as Doris Green\n* [[Rosetta LeNoire|Rosetta Le Noire]] as Odessa\n* [[F.

Turkey's human contributions to emissions can be segmented by sector, such as looking specifically at [[List of power stations in Turkey|Turkey's power stations]] or transport. In addition, the natural and [[Agriculture in Turkey|agricultural landscape of Turkey]] contribute to its national greenhouse gas emissions, with methane and [[N2O|N<sub>2</sub>O]] from agriculture more than offset by carbon dioxide trapped in forests, thus slightly reducing Turkey's overall emissions. [[Energy policy of Turkey|Turkey's policies on energy]], industry, and its explicit policies on climate change affect its level of emissions, and these policies are shaped by the relationship between emissions and economic activity. Finally, media, academic, and individual figures have provided commentary on Turkey's policies and levels of emissions. \n\nCoal, cows and construction vented about half the greenhouse gas emissions by Turkey in 2018, but almost a fifth was absorbed by trees.
