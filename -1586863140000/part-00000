He was a sprint specialist who won an Olympic gold medal, three World Championship gold medals, six World cup gold medals (three stage races, three individual World Cups), all in the sprint events. He was arguably the fastest skier ever when it came to double-poling on the flat in sprints. He generally favoured classic skiing and classic sprints over freestyle, but as he showed in winning the team sprint in the 2013 World Championship, in Val di Fiemme, he was also very strong in the freestyle sprint.\n\n==Career==\nThe highlights of his career were at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics where he beat his teammate from behind with a late closing sprint, in a photo finish that took minutes to determine. At the 2013 World Championships, where he won gold medals in both the individual classic sprint and the team freestyle sprint. A late fall by another team that impeded his closing 200 metres likely cost him a second Olympic Gold in the team sprint in Sochi where he took silver.\n\nIn November 2017, [[Maxim Vylegzhanin]] was disqualified for doping offenses, as a result Kryukov lost its silver medal in the [[Cross-country skiing at the 2014 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's team sprint|Team sprint]] awarded at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]].<ref name=IOC09Nov2017>[https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-sanctions-four-russian-athletes-and-closes-one-case-as-part-of-oswald-commission-findings IOC sanctions four Russian athletes as part of Oswald Commission findings]</ref> On 22 December 2017 Kriukov as well was found to have committed violations against the anti-doping rule at the 2014 Olympics.

competed internationally between 2006 and 2018. He was a sprint specialist who won an Olympic gold medal, three World Championship gold medals, six World cup gold medals (three stage races, three individual World Cups), all in the sprint events. He was arguably the fastest skier ever when it came to double-poling on the flat in sprints. He generally favoured classic skiing and classic sprints over freestyle, but as he showed in winning the team sprint in the 2013 World Championship, in Val di Fiemme, he was also very strong in the freestyle sprint.\n\n==Career==\nThe highlights of his career were at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics where he beat his teammate from behind with a late closing sprint, in a photo finish that took minutes to determine. At the 2013 World Championships, where he won gold medals in both the individual classic sprint and the team freestyle sprint. A late fall by another team that impeded his closing 200 metres likely cost him a second Olympic Gold in the team sprint in Sochi where he took silver.\n\nIn November 2017, [[Maxim Vylegzhanin]] was disqualified for doping offenses, as a result Kryukov lost its silver medal in the [[Cross-country skiing at the 2014 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's team sprint|Team sprint]] awarded at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]].<ref name=IOC09Nov2017>[https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-sanctions-four-russian-athletes-and-closes-one-case-as-part-of-oswald-commission-findings IOC sanctions four Russian athletes as part of Oswald Commission findings]</ref> On 22 December 2017 Kriukov as well was found to have committed violations against the anti-doping rule at the 2014 Olympics.

{"title_page": "Lambda calculus", "text_new": "{{short description|Formal system in mathematical logic}}\n'''Lambda calculus''' (also written as '''\u03bb-calculus''') is a [[formal system]] in [[mathematical logic]] for expressing [[computability|computation]] based on function [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] and [[function application|application]] using variable [[Name binding|binding]] and [[Substitution (algebra)|substitution]]. It is a universal [[model of computation]] that can be used to simulate any [[Turing machine]]. It was introduced by the mathematician [[Alonzo Church]] in the 1930s as part of his research into the [[foundations of mathematics]].\n\nLambda calculus consists of constructing lambda terms and performing reduction operations on them. In the simplest form of lambda calculus, terms are built using only the following rules:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Syntax !! Name !! Description\n|-\n| ''x'' || Variable || A character or string representing a parameter or mathematical/logical value.\n|-\n| (\u03bb''x''.''M'') || Abstraction || Function definition (''M'' is a lambda term). The variable ''x'' becomes [[Free variables and bound variables|bound]] in the expression.\n|-\n| (''M'' ''N'') || Application || Applying a function to an argument. M and N are lambda terms.\n|}\n\nproducing expressions such as: (\u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.(\u03bb''z''.(\u03bb''x''.''z x'') (\u03bb''y''.''z y'')) (''x y'')). Parentheses can be dropped if the expression is unambiguous. For some applications, terms for logical and mathematical constants and operations may be included.\n\nThe reduction operations include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Operation !! Name !!

Zalta (ed.).</ref>\n\n=== Origin of the lambda symbol ===\nThere is a bit of controversy over the reason for Church's use of the Greek letter [[lambda]] (\u03bb) as the notation for function-abstraction in the lambda calculus, perhaps in part due to conflicting explanations by Church himself. According to Cardone and Hindley (2006):\n<blockquote>\nBy the way, why did Church choose the notation \u201c\u03bb\u201d? In [an unpublished 1964 letter to Harald Dickson] he stated clearly that it came from the notation \u201c<math>\\hat{x}</math>\u201d used for class-abstraction by [[Principia Mathematica|Whitehead and Russell]], by first modifying \u201c<math>\\hat{x}</math>\u201d to \u201c\u2227<math>x</math>\u201d to distinguish function-abstraction from class-abstraction, and then changing \u201c\u2227\u201d to \u201c\u03bb\u201d for ease of printing.\n\nThis origin was also reported in [Rosser, 1984, p.338]. On the other hand, in his later years Church told two enquirers that the choice was more accidental: a symbol was needed and \u03bb just happened to be chosen.\n</blockquote>\n[[Dana Scott]] has also addressed this controversy in various public lectures.<ref>Dana Scott, \"[https://www.youtube.com/embed/uS9InrmPIoc Looking Backward; Looking Forward]\", Invited Talk at the Workshop in honour of Dana Scott\u2019s 85th birthday and 50 years of domain theory, 7\u20138 July, FLoC 2018 (talk 7 July 2018).

(See also this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=juXwu0Nqc3I extract of a May 2016 talk] at the University of Birmingham, UK.)</ref>\nScott recounts that he once posed a question about the origin of the lambda symbol to Church's son-in-law John Addison, who then wrote his father-in-law a postcard:\n<blockquote>\nDear Professor Church,\n\nRussell had the iota operator, Hilbert had the epsilon operator. Why did you choose lambda for your operator?\n</blockquote>\nAccording to Scott, Church's entire response consisted of returning the postcard with the following annotation: \"[[eeny, meeny, miny, moe]]\".\n\n== Informal description ==\n{{no footnotes|section|date=September 2013}}\n\n=== Motivation ===\n[[Computable function]]s are a fundamental concept within computer science and mathematics. The lambda calculus provides a simple [[Semantics#Computer science|semantics]] for computation, enabling properties of computation to be studied formally. The lambda calculus incorporates two simplifications that make this semantics simple.\nThe first simplification is that the lambda calculus treats functions \"anonymously\", without giving them explicit names. For example, the function \n: <math>\\operatorname{square\\_sum}(x, y) = x^2 + y^2</math>\ncan be rewritten in ''anonymous form'' as \n: <math>(x, y) \\mapsto x^2 + y^2</math>\n(read as \"a tuple of {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} is [[Map (mathematics)|mapped]] to <math display=\"inline\">x^2 + y^2</math>\"). Similarly, \n: <math>\\operatorname{id}(x) = x</math>\ncan be rewritten in anonymous form as\n: <math>x \\mapsto x</math>\nwhere the input is simply mapped to itself.\n\nThe second simplification is that the lambda calculus only uses functions of a single input. An ordinary function that requires two inputs, for instance the <math display=\"inline\">\\operatorname{square\\_sum}</math> function, can be reworked into an equivalent function that accepts a single input, and as output returns ''another'' function, that in turn accepts a single input. For example, \n: <math>(x, y) \\mapsto x^2 + y^2</math>\ncan be reworked into \n: <math>x \\mapsto (y \\mapsto x^2 + y^2)</math>\nThis method, known as [[currying]], transforms a function that takes multiple arguments into a chain of functions each with a single argument.\n\n[[Function application]] of the <math display=\"inline\">\\operatorname{square\\_sum}</math> function to the arguments (5, 2), yields at once\n: <math display=\"inline\">((x, y) \\mapsto x^2 + y^2)(5, 2)</math>\n: <math display=\"inline\"> = 5^2 + 2^2 </math>\n: <math display=\"inline\"> = 29</math>,\nwhereas evaluation of the curried version requires one more step\n: <math display=\"inline\">\\Bigl(\\bigl(x \\mapsto (y \\mapsto x^2 + y^2)\\bigr)(5)\\Bigr)(2)</math>\n: <math display=\"inline\"> = (y \\mapsto 5^2 + y^2)(2)</math> // the definition of <math>x</math> has been used with <math>5</math> in the inner expression. This is like \u03b2-reduction.\n: <math display=\"inline\"> = 5^2 + 2^2</math> // the definition of <math>y</math> has been used with <math>2</math>. Again, similar to \u03b2-reduction.\n: <math display=\"inline\"> = 29</math>\nto arrive at the same result.\n\n=== The lambda calculus ===\nThe lambda calculus consists of a language of '''lambda terms''', which is defined by a certain formal syntax, and a set of transformation rules, which allow manipulation of the lambda terms. These transformation rules can be viewed as an [[equational theory]] or as an [[operational definition]].\n\nAs described above, all functions in the lambda calculus are anonymous functions, having no names. They only accept one input variable, with [[currying]] used to implement functions with several variables.\n\n==== Lambda terms ====\nThe syntax of the lambda calculus defines some expressions as valid lambda calculus expressions and some as invalid, just as some strings of characters are valid [[C (programming language)|C]] programs and some are not. A valid lambda calculus expression is called a \"lambda term\".\n\nThe following three rules give an [[inductive definition]] that can be applied to build all syntactically valid lambda terms:\n* a variable, <math>x</math>, is itself a valid lambda term\n* if <math>t</math> is a lambda term, and <math>x</math> is a variable, then <math>(\\lambda x.t)</math> is a lambda term (called an '''abstraction''');\n* if <math>t</math> and <math>s</math> are lambda terms, then <math>(ts)</math> is a lambda term (called an '''application''').\nNothing else is a lambda term. Thus a lambda term is valid if and only if it can be obtained by repeated application of these three rules. However, some parentheses can be omitted according to certain rules. For example, the outermost parentheses are usually not written. See ''[[#Notation|Notation]]'', below.\n\nAn '''abstraction''' <math>\\lambda x.t</math> is a definition of an anonymous function that is capable of taking a single input <math>x</math> and substituting it into the expression <math>t</math>. \nIt thus defines an anonymous function that takes <math>x</math> and returns <math>t</math>. For example, <math>\\lambda x.x^2+2</math> is an abstraction for the function <math>f(x) = x^2 + 2</math> using the term <math>x^2+2</math> for <math>t</math>. The definition of a function with an abstraction merely \"sets up\" the function but does not invoke it. The abstraction [[Free variables and bound variables|binds]] the variable <math>x</math> in the term <math>t</math>.\n\nAn '''application''' <math>ts</math> represents the application of a function <math>t</math> to an input <math>s</math>, that is, it represents the act of calling function <math>t</math> on input <math>s</math> to produce <math>t(s)</math>.\n\nThere is no concept in lambda calculus of variable declaration. In a definition such as <math>\\lambda x.x+y</math> (i.e. <math>f(x) = x + y</math>), the lambda calculus treats <math>y</math> as a variable that is not yet defined. The abstraction <math>\\lambda x.x+y</math> is syntactically valid, and represents a function that adds its input to the yet-unknown <math>y</math>.\n\nBracketing may be used and may be needed to disambiguate terms. For example, <math>\\lambda x.((\\lambda x.x)x)</math> and <math>(\\lambda x.(\\lambda x.x)) x</math> denote different terms (although they coincidentally reduce to the same value). Here, the first example defines a function whose lambda term is the result of applying x to the child function, while the second example is the application of the outermost function to the input x, which returns the child function. Therefore, both examples evaluate to the [[identity function]] <math>\\lambda x.x</math>.\n\n==== Functions that operate on functions ====\nIn lambda calculus, functions are taken to be '[[First-class object|first class values]]', so functions may be used as the inputs, or be returned as outputs from other functions.\n\nFor example, <math>\\lambda x.x</math> represents the [[identity function]], <math>x \\mapsto x</math>, and <math>(\\lambda x.x)y</math> represents the identity function applied to <math>y</math>. Further, <math>(\\lambda x.y)</math> represents the '''constant function''' <math>x \\mapsto y</math>, the function that always returns <math>y</math>, no matter the input. In lambda calculus, function application is regarded as [[Operator associativity|left-associative]], so that <math>stx</math> means <math>(st)x</math>.\n\nThere are several notions of \"equivalence\" and \"reduction\" that allow lambda terms to be \"reduced\" to \"equivalent\" lambda terms.\n\n==== Alpha equivalence ====\nA basic form of equivalence, definable on lambda terms, is alpha equivalence. It captures the intuition that the particular choice of a bound variable, in an abstraction, does not (usually) matter.\nFor instance, <math>\\lambda x.x</math> and <math>\\lambda y.y</math> are alpha-equivalent lambda terms, and they both represent the same function (the identity function). \nThe terms <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are not alpha-equivalent, because they are not bound in an abstraction.\nIn many presentations, it is usual to identify alpha-equivalent lambda terms.\n\nThe following definitions are necessary in order to be able to define \u03b2-reduction:\n\n==== Free variables ====\nThe '''free variables''' of a term are those variables not bound by an abstraction. The set of free variables of an expression is defined inductively:\n* The free variables of <math>x</math> are just <math>x</math>\n* The set of free variables of <math>\\lambda x.t</math> is the set of free variables of <math>t</math>, but with <math>x</math> removed\n* The set of free variables of <math>ts</math> is the union of the set of free variables of <math>t</math> and the set of free variables of <math>s</math>.\n\nFor example, the lambda term representing the identity <math>\\lambda x.x</math> has no free variables, but the function <math>\\lambda x. yx</math> has a single free variable, <math>y</math>.\n\n==== Capture-avoiding substitutions ====\nSuppose <math>t</math>, <math>s</math> and <math>r</math> are lambda terms and <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are variables.\nThe notation <math>t[x := r]</math> indicates substitution of <math>r</math> for <math>x</math> in <math>t</math> in a ''capture-avoiding'' manner. This is defined so that:\n* <math>x[x := r] = r</math>;\n* <math>y[x := r] = y</math> if <math>x \\neq y</math>;\n* <math>(ts)[x := r] = (t[x := r])(s[x := r])</math>;\n* <math>(\\lambda x.t)[x := r] = \\lambda x.t</math>;\n* <math>(\\lambda y.t)[x := r] = \\lambda y.(t[x := r])</math> if <math>x \\neq y</math> and <math>y</math> is not in the free variables of <math>r</math>. The variable <math>y</math> is said to be \"fresh\" for <math>r</math>.\n\nFor example, <math>(\\lambda x.x)[y := y] = \\lambda x.(x[y := y]) = \\lambda x.x</math>, and <math>((\\lambda x.y)x)[x := y] = ((\\lambda x.y)[x := y])(x[x := y]) = (\\lambda x.y)y</math>.\n\nThe freshness condition (requiring that <math>y</math> is not in the free variables of <math>r</math>) is crucial in order to ensure that substitution does not change the meaning of functions.\nFor example, a substitution is made that ignores the freshness condition: <math>(\\lambda x.y)[y := x] = \\lambda x.(y[y := x]) = \\lambda x.x</math>. This substitution turns the constant function <math>\\lambda x.y</math> into the identity <math>\\lambda x.x</math> by substitution.\n\nIn general, failure to meet the freshness condition can be remedied by alpha-renaming with a suitable fresh variable.\nFor example, switching back to our correct notion of substitution, in <math>(\\lambda x.y)[y := x]</math> the abstraction can be renamed with a fresh variable <math>z</math>, to obtain <math>(\\lambda z.y)[y := x] = \\lambda z.(y[y := x]) = \\lambda z.x</math>, and the meaning of the function is preserved by substitution.\n\n==== \u03b2-reduction ====\nThe \u03b2-reduction rule states that an application of the form <math>( \\lambda x . t) s</math> reduces to the term <math> t [ x := s]</math>. The notation <math>( \\lambda x . t ) s \\to t [ x := s ] </math> is used to indicate that <math>( \\lambda x .t ) s </math> \u03b2-reduces to <math> t [ x := s ] </math>.\nFor example, for every <math>s</math>, <math>( \\lambda x . x ) s \\to x[ x := s ] = s </math>. This demonstrates that <math> \\lambda x . x </math> really is the identity.\nSimilarly, <math>( \\lambda x . y ) s \\to y [ x := s ] = y </math>, which demonstrates that <math> \\lambda x . y </math> is a constant function.\n\nThe lambda calculus may be seen as an idealised version of a functional programming language, like [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] or [[Standard ML]].\nUnder this view, \u03b2-reduction corresponds to a computational step. This step can be repeated by additional \u03b2-reductions until there are no more applications left to reduce. In the untyped lambda calculus, as presented here, this reduction process may not terminate.\nFor instance, consider the term <math>\\Omega = (\\lambda x . xx)( \\lambda x . xx )</math>.\nHere <math>( \\lambda x . xx)( \\lambda x . xx) \\to ( xx )[ x := \\lambda x . xx ] = ( x [ x := \\lambda x . xx ] )( x [ x := \\lambda x . xx ] ) = ( \\lambda x . xx)( \\lambda x . xx )</math>.\nThat is, the term reduces to itself in a single \u03b2-reduction, and therefore the reduction process will never terminate.\n\nAnother aspect of the untyped lambda calculus is that it does not distinguish between different kinds of data.\nFor instance, it may be desirable to write a function that only operates on numbers. However, in the untyped lambda calculus, there is no way to prevent a function from being applied to [[truth value]]s, strings, or other non-number objects.\n\n== Formal definition ==\n{{main|Lambda calculus definition}}\n\n=== Definition ===\nLambda expressions are composed of:\n* variables ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, ...;\n* the abstraction symbols \u03bb (lambda) and .

Also a variable is bound by its nearest abstraction. In the following example the single occurrence of ''x'' in the expression is bound by the second lambda: \u03bb''x''.''y'' (\u03bb''x''.''z x'').\n\nThe set of ''free variables'' of a lambda expression, ''M'', is denoted as FV(''M'') and is defined by recursion on the structure of the terms, as follows:\n# FV(''x'') = {''x''}, where ''x'' is a variable.\n# FV(\u03bb''x''.''M'') = FV(''M'') \\ {''x''}.\n# FV(''M N'') = FV(''M'') \u222a FV(''N'').<ref name=\"BarendregtBarendsen\">{{Citation\n | last = Barendregt\n | first = Henk\n | author-link = Henk Barendregt\n | last2 = Barendsen\n | first2 = Erik\n | author2-link =\n | title = Introduction to Lambda Calculus\n | place =\n | publisher =\n | date = March 2000\n | volume =\n | edition =\n | url = ftp://ftp.cs.ru.nl/pub/CompMath.Found/lambda.pdf\n | doi =\n | id =\n | isbn = }}</ref>\n\nAn expression that contains no free variables is said to be ''closed''.

For example, \u03b1-conversion of \u03bb''x''.''x'' might yield \u03bb''y''.''y''. Terms that differ only by \u03b1-conversion are called ''\u03b1-equivalent''. Frequently, in uses of lambda calculus, \u03b1-equivalent terms are considered to be equivalent.\n\nThe precise rules for \u03b1-conversion are not completely trivial. First, when \u03b1-converting an abstraction, the only variable occurrences that are renamed are those that are bound to the same abstraction. For example, an \u03b1-conversion of \u03bb''x''.\u03bb''x''.''x'' could result in \u03bb''y''.\u03bb''x''.''x'', but it could ''not'' result in \u03bb''y''.\u03bb''x''.''y''. The latter has a different meaning from the original. This is analogous to the programming notion of [[variable shadowing]].\n\nSecond, \u03b1-conversion is not possible if it would result in a variable getting captured by a different abstraction. For example, if we replace ''x'' with ''y'' in \u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.''x'', we get \u03bb''y''.\u03bb''y''.''y'', which is not at all the same.\n\nIn programming languages with static scope, \u03b1-conversion can be used to make [[Name resolution (programming languages)|name resolution]] simpler by ensuring that no variable name [[Variable shadowing|masks]] a name in a containing [[scope (programming)|scope]] (see [[Name resolution (programming languages)#Alpha renaming to make name resolution trivial|\u03b1-renaming to make name resolution trivial]]).\n\nIn the [[De Bruijn index]] notation, any two \u03b1-equivalent terms are syntactically identical.\n\n==== Substitution ====\nSubstitution, written ''M''[''V'' := ''N''], is the process of replacing all ''free'' occurrences of the variable ''V'' in the expression ''M'' with expression ''N''. Substitution on terms of the lambda calculus is defined by recursion on the structure of terms, as follows (note: x and y are only variables while M and N are any lambda expression):\n\n: ''x''[''x'' := ''N''] = ''N''\n: ''y''[''x'' := ''N''] = ''y'', if ''x'' \u2260 ''y''\n: (''M''<sub>1</sub> ''M''<sub>2</sub>)[''x'' := ''N''] = (''M''<sub>1</sub>[''x'' := ''N'']) (''M''<sub>2</sub>[''x'' := ''N''])\n: (\u03bb''x''.''M'')[''x'' := ''N''] = \u03bb''x''.''M''\n: (\u03bb''y''.''M'')[''x'' := ''N''] = \u03bb''y''.(''M''[''x'' := ''N'']), if ''x'' \u2260 ''y'' and ''y'' \u2209 FV(''N'')\n\nTo substitute into an abstraction, it is sometimes necessary to \u03b1-convert the expression. For example, it is not correct for (\u03bb''x''.''y'')[''y'' := ''x''] to result in \u03bb''x''.''x'', because the substituted ''x'' was supposed to be free but ended up being bound. The correct substitution in this case is \u03bb''z''.''x'', up to \u03b1-equivalence. Substitution is defined uniquely up to \u03b1-equivalence.\n\n=== \u03b2-reduction ===\n\u03b2-reduction captures the idea of function application. \u03b2-reduction is defined in terms of substitution: the \u03b2-reduction of (\u03bb''V''.''M'') ''N'' is ''M''[''V'' := ''N''].\n\nFor example, assuming some encoding of 2, 7, \u00d7, we have the following \u03b2-reduction: (\u03bb''n''.''n'' \u00d7 2) 7 \u2192 7 \u00d7 2.\n\n\u03b2-reduction can be seen to be the same as the concept of ''local reducibility'' in [[natural deduction]], via the [[Curry\u2013Howard isomorphism]].\n\n=== \u03b7-reduction ===\n\u03b7-reduction expresses the idea of [[extensionality]], which in this context is that two functions are the same [[if and only if]] they give the same result for all arguments. \u03b7-reduction converts between \u03bb''x''.''f'' ''x'' and ''f'' whenever ''x'' does not appear free in ''f''.\n\n\u03b7-reduction can be seen to be the same as the concept of ''local completeness'' in [[natural deduction]], via the [[Curry\u2013Howard isomorphism]].\n\n== Normal forms and confluence ==\n{{main|Normalization property (abstract rewriting)}}\nFor the untyped lambda calculus, \u03b2-reduction as a [[rewrite system|rewriting rule]] is neither [[strongly normalising]] nor [[weakly normalising]].\n\nHowever, it can be shown that \u03b2-reduction is [[confluence (abstract rewriting)|confluent]] when working up to \u03b1-conversion (i.e. we consider two normal forms to be equal if it is possible to \u03b1-convert one into the other).\n\nTherefore, both strongly normalising terms and weakly normalising terms have a unique normal form. For strongly normalising terms, any reduction strategy is guaranteed to yield the normal form, whereas for weakly normalising terms, some reduction strategies may fail to find it.\n\n== Encoding datatypes ==\n{{main|Church encoding|Mogensen\u2013Scott encoding}}\nThe basic lambda calculus may be used to model booleans, [[arithmetic]], data structures and recursion, as illustrated in the following sub-sections.\n\n=== Arithmetic in lambda calculus ===\nThere are several possible ways to define the [[natural number]]s in lambda calculus, but by far the most common are the [[Church numeral]]s, which can be defined as follows:\n: <tt>0 := \u03bb''f''.\u03bb''x''.''x''</tt>\n: <tt>1 := \u03bb''f''.\u03bb''x''.''f'' ''x''</tt>\n: <tt>2 := \u03bb''f''.\u03bb''x''.''f'' (''f'' ''x'')</tt>\n: <tt>3 := \u03bb''f''.\u03bb''x''.''f'' (''f'' (''f'' ''x''))</tt>\nand so on. Or using the alternative syntax presented above in ''[[#Notation|Notation]]'':\n\n: <tt>0 := \u03bb''fx''.''x''</tt>\n: <tt>1 := \u03bb''fx''.''f'' ''x''</tt>\n: <tt>2 := \u03bb''fx''.''f'' (''f'' ''x'')</tt>\n: <tt>3 := \u03bb''fx''.''f'' (''f'' (''f'' ''x''))</tt>\n\nA Church numeral is a [[higher-order function]]\u2014it takes a single-argument function <tt>''f''</tt>, and returns another single-argument function. The Church numeral <tt>''n''</tt> is a function that takes a function <tt>''f''</tt> as argument and returns the <tt>''n''</tt>-th composition of <tt>''f''</tt>, i.e. the function <tt>''f''</tt> composed with itself <tt>''n''</tt> times. This is denoted <tt>''f''<sup>(''n'')</sup></tt> and is in fact the <tt>''n''</tt>-th power of <tt>''f''</tt> (considered as an operator); <tt>''f''<sup>(0)</sup></tt> is defined to be the identity function. Such repeated compositions (of a single function <tt>''f''</tt>) obey the [[laws of exponents]], which is why these numerals can be used for arithmetic. (In Church's original lambda calculus, the formal parameter of a lambda expression was required to occur at least once in the function body, which made the above definition of <tt>0</tt> impossible.)\n\nOne way of thinking about the Church numeral <tt>''n''</tt>, which is often useful when analysing programs, is as an instruction 'repeat ''n'' times'. For example, using the <tt>PAIR</tt> and <tt>NIL</tt> functions defined below, one can define a function that constructs a (linked) list of ''n'' elements all equal to ''x'' by repeating 'prepend another ''x'' element' ''n'' times, starting from an empty list. The lambda term is\n: <tt>\u03bb''n''.\u03bb''x''.''n'' (PAIR ''x'') NIL</tt>\nBy varying what is being repeated, and varying what argument that function being repeated is applied to, a great many different effects can be achieved.\n\nWe can define a successor function, which takes a Church numeral <tt>''n''</tt> and returns <tt>''n'' + 1</tt> by adding another application of <tt>''f''</tt>, where '(mf)x' means the function 'f' is applied 'm' times on 'x':\n: <tt>SUCC := \u03bb''n''.\u03bb''f''.\u03bb''x''.''f'' (''n'' ''f'' ''x'')</tt>\nBecause the <tt>''m''</tt>-th composition of <tt>''f''</tt> composed with the <tt>''n''</tt>-th composition of <tt>''f''</tt> gives the <tt>''m''+''n''</tt>-th composition of <tt>''f''</tt>, addition can be defined as follows:\n: <tt>PLUS := \u03bb''m''.\u03bb''n''.\u03bb''f''.\u03bb''x''.''m'' ''f'' (''n'' ''f'' ''x'')</tt>\n<tt>PLUS</tt> can be thought of as a function taking two natural numbers as arguments and returning a natural number; it can be verified that\n: <tt>PLUS 2 3</tt>\nand\n: <tt>5</tt>\nare \u03b2-equivalent lambda expressions. Since adding <tt>''m''</tt> to a number <tt>''n''</tt> can be accomplished by adding 1 <tt>''m''</tt> times, an alternative definition is:\n: <tt>PLUS := \u03bb''m''.\u03bb''n''.''m'' SUCC ''n&thinsp;''</tt><ref>{{Citation\n | last1 = Felleisen\n | first1 = Matthias\n | last2 = Flatt\n | first2 = Matthew\n | authorlink =\n | title = Programming Languages and Lambda Calculi\n | publisher =\n | year = 2006\n | location =\n | page = 26\n | url = http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/publications/pllc.pdf\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090205113235/http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/publications/pllc.pdf\n | archive-date = 2009-02-05\n | doi =\n | id =\n | isbn = }}; a note (accessed 2017) at the original location suggests that the authors consider the work originally referenced to have been superseded by a book.</ref>\nSimilarly, multiplication can be defined as\n: <tt>MULT := \u03bb''m''.\u03bb''n''.\u03bb''f''.''m'' (''n'' ''f'')</tt><ref name=\"Selinger\" />\nAlternatively\n: <tt>MULT := \u03bb''m''.\u03bb''n''.''m'' (PLUS ''n'') 0</tt>\nsince multiplying <tt>''m''</tt> and <tt>''n''</tt> is the same as repeating the add <tt>''n''</tt> function <tt>''m''</tt> times and then applying it to zero.\nExponentiation has a rather simple rendering in Church numerals, namely\n: <tt>POW := \u03bb''b''.\u03bb''e''.''e'' ''b''</tt><ref name=\"BarendregtBarendsen\"/>\nThe predecessor function defined by <tt>PRED ''n'' = ''n'' \u2212 1</tt> for a positive integer <tt>''n''</tt> and <tt>PRED 0 = 0</tt> is considerably more difficult. The formula\n: <tt>PRED := \u03bb''n''.\u03bb''f''.\u03bb''x''.''n'' (\u03bb''g''.\u03bb''h''.''h'' (''g'' ''f'')) (\u03bb''u''.''x'') (\u03bb''u''.''u'')</tt>\ncan be validated by showing inductively that if ''T'' denotes <tt>(\u03bb''g''.\u03bb''h''.''h'' (''g'' ''f''))</tt>, then <tt>T<sup>(''n'')</sup>(\u03bb''u''.''x'') = (\u03bb''h''.''h''(''f''<sup>(''n''\u22121)</sup>(''x'')))</tt> for <tt>''n'' > 0</tt>. Two other definitions of <tt>PRED</tt> are given below, one using [[#Logic and predicates|conditionals]] and the other using [[#Pairs|pairs]]. With the predecessor function, subtraction is straightforward. Defining\n: <tt>SUB := \u03bb''m''.\u03bb''n''.''n'' PRED ''m''</tt>,\n<tt>SUB ''m'' ''n''</tt> yields <tt>''m'' \u2212 ''n''</tt> when <tt>''m'' > ''n''</tt> and <tt>0</tt> otherwise.\n\n=== Logic and predicates ===\nBy convention, the following two definitions (known as Church booleans) are used for the boolean values <tt>TRUE</tt> and <tt>FALSE</tt>:\n: <tt>TRUE := \u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.''x''</tt>\n: <tt>FALSE := \u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.''y''</tt>\n:: (Note that <tt>FALSE</tt> is equivalent to the Church numeral zero defined above)\nThen, with these two lambda terms, we can define some logic operators (these are just possible formulations; other expressions are equally correct):\n: <tt>AND := \u03bb''p''.\u03bb''q''.''p'' ''q'' ''p''</tt>\n: <tt>OR := \u03bb''p''.\u03bb''q''.''p'' ''p'' ''q''</tt>\n: <tt>NOT := \u03bb''p''.''p'' FALSE TRUE</tt>\n: <tt>IFTHENELSE := \u03bb''p''.\u03bb''a''.\u03bb''b''.''p'' ''a'' ''b''</tt>\nWe are now able to compute some logic functions, for example:\n\n: <tt>AND TRUE FALSE</tt>\n:: <tt>\u2261 (\u03bb''p''.\u03bb''q''.''p'' ''q'' ''p'') TRUE FALSE \u2192<sub>\u03b2</sub> TRUE FALSE TRUE</tt>\n:: <tt>\u2261 (\u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.''x'') FALSE TRUE \u2192<sub>\u03b2</sub>  FALSE</tt>\nand we see that <tt>AND TRUE FALSE</tt> is equivalent to <tt>FALSE</tt>.\n\nA ''predicate'' is a function that returns a boolean value. The most fundamental predicate is <tt>ISZERO</tt>, which returns <tt>TRUE</tt> if its argument is the Church numeral <tt>0</tt>, and <tt>FALSE</tt> if its argument is any other Church numeral:\n: <tt>ISZERO := \u03bb''n''.''n'' (\u03bb''x''.FALSE) TRUE</tt>\nThe following predicate tests whether the first argument is less-than-or-equal-to the second:\n: <tt>LEQ := \u03bb''m''.\u03bb''n''.ISZERO (SUB ''m'' ''n'')</tt>,\nand since <tt>''m'' = ''n''</tt>, if <tt>LEQ ''m'' ''n''</tt> and <tt>LEQ ''n'' ''m''</tt>, it is straightforward to build a predicate for numerical equality.\n\nThe availability of predicates and the above definition of <tt>TRUE</tt> and <tt>FALSE</tt> make it convenient to write \"if-then-else\" expressions in lambda calculus. For example, the predecessor function can be defined as:\n: <tt>PRED := \u03bb''n''.''n'' (\u03bb''g''.\u03bb''k''.ISZERO (''g'' 1) ''k'' (PLUS (''g'' ''k'') 1)) (\u03bb''v''.0) 0 </tt>\nwhich can be verified by showing inductively that <tt>''n'' (\u03bb''g''.\u03bb''k''.ISZERO (''g'' 1) ''k'' (PLUS (''g'' ''k'') 1)) (\u03bb''v''.0)</tt> is the add <tt>''n''</tt> \u2212 1 function for <tt>''n''</tt> > 0.\n\n=== Pairs ===\nA pair (2-tuple) can be defined in terms of <tt>TRUE</tt> and <tt>FALSE</tt>, by using the [[Church encoding#Church pairs|Church encoding for pairs]]. For example, <tt>PAIR</tt> encapsulates the pair (<tt>''x''</tt>,<tt>''y''</tt>), <tt>FIRST</tt> returns the first element of the pair, and <tt>SECOND</tt> returns the second.\n\n: <tt>PAIR := \u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.\u03bb''f''.''f'' ''x'' ''y''</tt>\n: <tt>FIRST := \u03bb''p''.''p'' TRUE</tt>\n: <tt>SECOND := \u03bb''p''.''p'' FALSE</tt>\n: <tt>NIL := \u03bb''x''.TRUE </tt>\n: <tt>NULL := \u03bb''p''.''p'' (\u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.FALSE)</tt>\n\nA linked list can be defined as either NIL for the empty list, or the <tt>PAIR</tt> of an element and a smaller list. The predicate <tt>NULL</tt> tests for the value <tt>NIL</tt>. (Alternatively, with <tt>NIL := FALSE</tt>, the construct <tt>''l'' (\u03bb''h''.\u03bb''t''.\u03bb''z''.deal_with_head_''h''_and_tail_''t'') (deal_with_nil)</tt> obviates the need for an explicit NULL test).\n\nAs an example of the use of pairs, the shift-and-increment function that maps <tt>(''m'', ''n'')</tt> to <tt>(''n'', ''n'' + 1)</tt> can be defined as\n: <tt>\u03a6 := \u03bb''x''.PAIR (SECOND ''x'') (SUCC (SECOND ''x''))</tt>\nwhich allows us to give perhaps the most transparent version of the predecessor function:\n: <tt>PRED := \u03bb''n''.FIRST (''n'' \u03a6 (PAIR 0 0)).</tt>\n\n== Additional programming techniques ==\nThere is a considerable body of [[programming idiom]]s for lambda calculus. Many of these were originally developed in the context of using lambda calculus as a foundation for programming language semantics, effectively using lambda calculus as a [[low-level programming language]]. Because several programming languages include the lambda calculus (or something very similar) as a fragment, these techniques also see use in practical programming, but may then be perceived as obscure or foreign.\n\n=== Named constants ===\nIn lambda calculus, a [[library (computing)|library]] would take the form of a collection of previously defined functions, which as lambda-terms are merely particular constants. The pure lambda calculus does not have a concept of named constants since all atomic lambda-terms are variables, but one can emulate having named constants by setting aside a variable as the name of the constant, using abstraction to bind that variable in the main body, and apply that abstraction to the intended definition. Thus to use <tt>''f''</tt> to mean ''M'' (some explicit lambda-term) in ''N'' (another lambda-term, the \"main program\"), one can say\n: <tt>(\u03bb''f''.</tt>''N''<tt>)</tt> ''M''\nAuthors often introduce [[syntactic sugar]], such as <tt>let</tt>, to permit writing the above in the more intuitive order\n: <tt>let ''f'' = </tt>''M''<tt> in </tt>''N''\nBy chaining such definitions, one can write a lambda calculus \"program\" as zero or more function definitions, followed by one lambda-term using those functions that constitutes the main body of the program.\n\nA notable restriction of this <tt>let</tt> is that the name <tt>''f''</tt> is not defined in ''M'', since ''M'' is outside the scope of the abstraction binding <tt>''f''</tt>; this means a recursive function definition cannot be used as the ''M'' with <tt>let</tt>. The more advanced <tt>letrec</tt> syntactic sugar construction that allows writing recursive function definitions in that naive style instead additionally employs fixed-point combinators.\n\n=== Recursion and fixed points ===\n{{main|Fixed-point combinator}}\n{{see also|SKI combinator calculus#Self-application and recursion}}\n[[Recursion]] is the definition of a function using the function itself. Lambda calculus cannot express this as directly as some other notations: all functions are anonymous in lambda calculus, so we can't refer to a value which is yet to be defined, inside the lambda term defining that same value. However, recursion can still be achieved by arranging for a lambda expression to receive itself as its argument value, for example in&ensp; <tt>(\u03bb''x''.''x'' ''x'') ''E''</tt>.\n\nConsider the [[factorial]] function <tt>F(''n'')</tt> recursively defined by\n\n: <tt>F(''n'') = 1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' &times; F(''n'' \u2212 1)</tt>.\n\nIn the lambda expression which is to represent this function, a ''parameter'' (typically the first one) will be assumed to receive the lambda expression itself as its value, so that calling it &ndash; applying it to an argument &ndash; will amount to recursion. Thus to achieve recursion, the intended-as-self-referencing argument (called <tt>''r''</tt> here) must always be passed to itself within the function body, at a call point:\n\n: <tt>G := \u03bb''r''. \u03bb''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' &times; (''r'' ''r'' (''n''\u22121)))</tt>\n::: with&ensp; <tt> ''r'' ''r'' ''x'' = F ''x'' = G ''r'' ''x''</tt> &ensp;to hold, so&ensp; <tt>''r'' = G</tt> &ensp;and\n: <tt>F := G G = (\u03bb''x''.''x'' ''x'') G</tt>\n\nThe self-application achieves replication here, passing the function's lambda expression on to the next invocation as an argument value, making it available to be referenced and called there.\n\nThis solves it but requires re-writing each recursive call as self-application. We would like to have a generic solution, without a need for any re-writes:\n\n: <tt>G := \u03bb''r''. \u03bb''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' &times; (''r'' (''n''\u22121)))</tt>\n::: with&ensp; <tt> ''r'' ''x'' = F ''x'' = G ''r'' ''x''</tt> &ensp;to hold, so&ensp; <tt>''r'' = G ''r'' =: FIX G</tt> &ensp;and\n: <tt>F := FIX G</tt> &ensp;where&ensp; <tt>FIX ''g'' := (''r'' where ''r'' = ''g'' ''r'') = ''g'' (FIX ''g'')</tt>\n::: so that&ensp; <tt> FIX G = G (FIX G) = (\u03bb''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' &times; ((FIX G) (''n''\u22121)))) </tt>\n\nGiven a lambda term with first argument representing recursive call (e.g. <tt>G</tt> here), the ''fixed-point'' combinator <tt>FIX</tt> will return a self-replicating lambda expression representing the recursive function (here, <tt>F</tt>). The function does not need to be explicitly passed to itself at any point, for the self-replication is arranged in advance, when it is created, to be done each time it is called. Thus the original lambda expression <tt>(FIX G)</tt> is re-created inside itself, at call-point, achieving [[self-reference]].\n\nIn fact, there are many possible definitions for this <tt>FIX</tt> operator, the simplest of them being:\n\n: <tt>'''Y''' := \u03bb''g''.(\u03bb''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')) (\u03bb''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x''))</tt>\n\nIn the lambda calculus, <tt>'''Y''' ''g''</tt>&thinsp; is a fixed-point of <tt>''g''</tt>, as it expands to:\n\n: <tt>'''Y''' ''g''</tt>\n: <tt>(\u03bb''h''.(\u03bb''x''.''h'' (''x'' ''x'')) (\u03bb''x''.''h'' (''x'' ''x''))) ''g''</tt>\n: <tt>(\u03bb''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')) (\u03bb''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x''))</tt>\n: <tt>''g'' ((\u03bb''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')) (\u03bb''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')))</tt>\n: <tt>''g'' ('''Y''' ''g'')</tt>\n\nNow, to perform our recursive call to the factorial function, we would simply call <tt>('''Y''' G) ''n''</tt>,&nbsp; where ''n'' is the number we are calculating the factorial of.

In particular, we can now cleanly define the subtraction, multiplication and comparison predicate of natural numbers recursively.\n\n=== Standard terms ===\nCertain terms have commonly accepted names {{Citation needed|reason=There should be at least a source here|date=March 2020}}:\n: {{anchor|I}} <tt>'''I''' := \u03bb''x''.''x''</tt>\n: {{anchor|K}} <tt>'''K''' := \u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.''x''</tt>\n: {{anchor|S}} <tt>'''S''' := \u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.\u03bb''z''.''x'' ''z'' (''y'' ''z'') </tt>\n: {{anchor|B}} <tt>'''B''' := \u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.\u03bb''z''.''x'' (''y'' ''z'') </tt>\n: {{anchor|C}} <tt>'''C''' := \u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.\u03bb''z''.''x'' ''z'' ''y''</tt>\n: {{anchor|W}} <tt>'''W''' := \u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.''x'' ''y'' ''y''</tt>\n: {{anchor|U}} <tt>'''U''' := \u03bb''x''.''x'' ''x''  </tt>\n: {{anchor|omega}} <tt>'''\u03c9''' := \u03bb''x''.''x'' ''x'' </tt>\n: {{anchor|Omega}} <tt>'''\u03a9''' := '''\u03c9 \u03c9''' </tt>\n: {{anchor|Y}} <tt>'''Y''' := \u03bb''g''.(\u03bb''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')) (\u03bb''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x''))</tt>\nSeveral of these have direct applications in the ''elimination of abstraction'' that turns lambda terms into [[combinator calculus]] terms.\n\n=== Abstraction elimination ===\n{{main|Combinatory logic#Completeness of the S-K basis}}\nIf ''N'' is a lambda-term without abstraction, but possibly containing named constants ([[combinatory logic|combinators]]), then there exists a lambda-term ''T''(<tt>''x''</tt>,''N'') which is equivalent to <tt>\u03bb''x''.</tt>''N'' but lacks abstraction (except as part of the named constants, if these are considered non-atomic). This can also be viewed as anonymising variables, as ''T''(<tt>''x''</tt>,''N'') removes all occurrences of <tt>''x''</tt> from ''N'', while still allowing argument values to be substituted into the positions where ''N'' contains an <tt>''x''</tt>. The conversion function ''T'' can be defined by:\n: ''T''(<tt>''x''</tt>, <tt>''x''</tt>) := '''I'''\n: ''T''(<tt>''x''</tt>, ''N'') := '''K''' ''N'' if <tt>''x''</tt> is not free in ''N''.\n: ''T''(<tt>''x''</tt>, ''M'' ''N'') := '''S''' ''T''(<tt>''x''</tt>, ''M'') ''T''(<tt>''x''</tt>, ''N'')\nIn either case, a term of the form ''T''(<tt>''x''</tt>,''N'') ''P'' can reduce by having the initial combinator '''I''', '''K''', or '''S''' grab the argument ''P'', just like \u03b2-reduction of <tt>(\u03bb''x''.</tt>''N''<tt>)</tt> ''P'' would do. '''I''' returns that argument. '''K''' throws the argument away, just like <tt>(\u03bb''x''.</tt>''N''<tt>)</tt> would do if <tt>''x''</tt> has no free occurrence in ''N''. '''S''' passes the argument on to both subterms of the application, and then applies the result of the first to the result of the second.\n\nThe combinators '''B''' and '''C''' are similar to '''S''', but pass the argument on to only one subterm of an application ('''B''' to the \"argument\" subterm and '''C''' to the \"function\" subterm), thus saving a subsequent '''K''' if there is no occurrence of <tt>''x''</tt> in one subterm. In comparison to '''B''' and '''C''', the '''S''' combinator actually conflates two functionalities: rearranging arguments, and duplicating an argument so that it may be used in two places. The '''W''' combinator does only the latter, yielding the [[B, C, K, W system]] as an alternative to [[SKI combinator calculus]].\n\n== Typed lambda calculus ==\n{{main|Typed lambda calculus}}\nA '''typed lambda calculus''' is a typed [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]] that uses the lambda-symbol (<math>\\lambda</math>) to denote anonymous function abstraction. In this context, types are usually objects of a syntactic nature that are assigned to lambda terms; the exact nature of a type depends on the calculus considered (see kinds below). From a certain point of view, typed lambda calculi can be seen as refinements of the [[untyped lambda calculus]] but from another point of view, they can also be considered the more fundamental theory and ''untyped lambda calculus'' a special case with only one type.<ref>Types and Programming Languages, p. 273, Benjamin C. Pierce</ref>\n\nTyped lambda calculi are foundational [[programming languages]] and are the base of typed [[functional programming languages]] such as [[ML programming language|ML]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and, more indirectly, typed [[imperative programming|imperative programming languages]]. Typed lambda calculi play an important role in the design of [[type systems]] for programming languages; here typability usually captures desirable properties of the program, e.g. the program will not cause a memory access violation.\n\nTyped lambda calculi are closely related to [[mathematical logic]] and [[proof theory]] via the [[Curry\u2013Howard isomorphism]] and they can be considered as the [[internal language]] of classes of [[category theory|categories]], e.g. the simply typed lambda calculus is the language of [[cartesian closed category|Cartesian closed categories]] (CCCs).\n\n== Computable functions and lambda calculus ==\nA function ''F'': '''N''' \u2192 '''N''' of natural numbers is a computable function if and only if there exists a lambda expression ''f'' such that for every pair of ''x'', ''y'' in '''N''', ''F''(''x'')=''y'' if and only if ''f'' <tt>''x''</tt>&nbsp;=<sub>\u03b2</sub>&nbsp;<tt>''y''</tt>,&nbsp; where <tt>''x''</tt> and <tt>''y''</tt> are the Church numerals corresponding to ''x'' and ''y'', respectively and =<sub>\u03b2</sub> meaning equivalence with \u03b2-reduction. This is one of the many ways to define computability; see the [[Church\u2013Turing thesis]] for a discussion of other approaches and their equivalence.\n\n== Undecidability of equivalence ==\nThere is no algorithm that takes as input any two lambda expressions and outputs <tt>TRUE</tt> or <tt>FALSE</tt> depending on whether or not the two expressions are equivalent.<ref name=\"Church1936\" /> More precisely, no [[computable function]] can [[decision problem|decide]] the equivalence. This was historically the first problem for which undecidability could be proven. As usual for such a proof, ''computable'' means computable by any [[model of computation]] that is [[Turing complete]].\n\nChurch's proof first reduces the problem to determining whether a given lambda expression has a ''normal form''. A normal form is an equivalent expression that cannot be reduced any further under the rules imposed by the form. Then he assumes that this predicate is computable, and can hence be expressed in lambda calculus. Building on earlier work by Kleene and constructing a [[G\u00f6del numbering]] for lambda expressions, he constructs a lambda expression <tt>''e''</tt> that closely follows the proof of [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems|G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem]]. If <tt>''e''</tt> is applied to its own G\u00f6del number, a contradiction results.\n\n== Lambda calculus and programming languages ==\nAs pointed out by [[Peter Landin]]'s 1965 paper \"A Correspondence between ALGOL 60 and Church's Lambda-notation\",<ref>{{cite journal |title=A Correspondence between ALGOL 60 and Church's Lambda-notation |first=P. J. |last=Landin |authorlink=Peter Landin |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=8 |issue=2 |year=1965 |pages=89\u2013101 |doi=10.1145/363744.363749}}</ref> sequential [[procedural programming|procedural programming languages]] can be understood in terms of the lambda calculus, which provides the basic mechanisms for procedural abstraction and procedure (subprogram) application.\n\n=== Anonymous functions ===\n{{main|Anonymous function}}\nFor example, in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] the \"square\" function can be expressed as a lambda expression as follows:\n<!-- Please do not add the same example in different languages to this article, see Anonymous function for that. Thank you! -->\n<source lang=\"Lisp\">\n(lambda (x) (* x x))\n</source>\n\nThe above example is an expression that evaluates to a first-class function. The symbol <code>lambda</code> creates an anonymous function, given a list of parameter names, <code>(x)</code> \u2013 just a single argument in this case, and an expression that is evaluated as the body of the function, <code>(* x x)</code>. Anonymous functions are sometimes called lambda expressions.\n\nFor example, [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and many other imperative languages have long supported passing [[subprograms]] as [[arguments]] to other subprograms through the mechanism of [[function pointers]]. However, function pointers are not a sufficient condition for functions to be [[First-class function|first class]] datatypes, because a function is a first class datatype if and only if new instances of the function can be created at run-time. And this run-time creation of functions is supported in [[Smalltalk]], [[JavaScript]], and more recently in [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] (\"agents\"), [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] (\"delegates\") and [[C++11]], among others.\n\n=== Reduction strategies ===\n{{details|Evaluation strategy}}\nWhether a term is normalising or not, and how much work needs to be done in normalising it if it is, depends to a large extent on the reduction strategy used. The distinction between reduction strategies relates to the distinction in functional programming languages between [[eager evaluation]] and [[lazy evaluation]].\n\n; Full \u03b2-reductions: Any redex can be reduced at any time. This means essentially the lack of any particular reduction strategy\u2014with regard to reducibility, \"all bets are off\".\n; Applicative order: The leftmost, innermost redex is always reduced first. Intuitively this means a function's arguments are always reduced before the function itself. Applicative order always attempts to apply functions to normal forms, even when this is not possible.\n: Most programming languages (including Lisp, ML and imperative languages like C and [[Java programming language|Java]]) are described as \"strict\", meaning that functions applied to non-normalising arguments are non-normalising. This is done essentially using applicative order, call by value reduction ([[#Call by value|see below]]), but usually called \"eager evaluation\".\n; Normal order: The leftmost, outermost redex is always reduced first. That is, whenever possible the arguments are substituted into the body of an abstraction before the arguments are reduced.\n; {{visible anchor|Call by value}}: Only the outermost redexes are reduced: a redex is reduced only when its right hand side has reduced to a value (variable or abstraction).\n; Call by name: As normal order, but no reductions are performed inside abstractions. For example, <tt>\u03bb''x''.(\u03bb''x''.''x'')''x''</tt> is in normal form according to this strategy, although it contains the redex <tt>(\u03bb''x''.''x'')''x''</tt>.\n; Call by need: As normal order, but function applications that would duplicate terms instead name the argument, which is then reduced only \"when it is needed\". Called in practical contexts \"lazy evaluation\". In implementations this \"name\" takes the form of a pointer, with the redex represented by a [[thunk]].\n\nApplicative order is not a normalising strategy. The usual counterexample is as follows: define <tt>'''\u03a9''' = \u03c9\u03c9</tt> where <tt>'''\u03c9''' = \u03bb''x''.''xx''</tt>. This entire expression contains only one redex, namely the whole expression; its reduct is again <tt>'''\u03a9'''</tt>. Since this is the only available reduction, <tt>'''\u03a9'''</tt> has no normal form (under any evaluation strategy). Using applicative order, the expression <tt>'''KI\u03a9''' = (\u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.''x'') (\u03bb''x''.''x'')'''\u03a9'''</tt> is reduced by first reducing <tt>'''\u03a9'''</tt> to normal form (since it is the rightmost redex), but since <tt>'''\u03a9'''</tt> has no normal form, applicative order fails to find a normal form for <tt>'''KI\u03a9'''</tt>.\n\nIn contrast, normal order is so called because it always finds a normalising reduction, if one exists. In the above example, <tt>'''KI\u03a9'''</tt> reduces under normal order to ''I'', a normal form. A drawback is that redexes in the arguments may be copied, resulting in duplicated computation (for example, <tt>(\u03bb''x''.''xx'') ((\u03bb''x''.''x'')''y'')</tt> reduces to <tt>((\u03bb''x''.''x'')''y'') ((\u03bb''x''.''x'')''y'')</tt> using this strategy; now there are two redexes, so full evaluation needs two more steps, but if the argument had been reduced first, there would now be none).\n\nThe positive tradeoff of using applicative order is that it does not cause unnecessary computation, if all arguments are used, because it never substitutes arguments containing redexes and hence never needs to copy them (which would duplicate work). In the above example, in applicative order <tt>(\u03bb''x''.''xx'') ((\u03bb''x''.''x'')''y'')</tt> reduces first to <tt>(\u03bb''x''.''xx'')''y''</tt> and then to the normal order <tt>''yy''</tt>, taking two steps instead of three.\n\nMost ''purely'' functional programming languages (notably [[Miranda (programming language)|Miranda]] and its descendants, including Haskell), and the proof languages of [[Automated theorem prover|theorem provers]], use ''lazy evaluation'', which is essentially the same as call by need. This is like normal order reduction, but call by need manages to avoid the duplication of work inherent in normal order reduction using ''sharing''. In the example given above, <tt>(\u03bb''x''.''xx'') ((\u03bb''x''.''x'')''y'')</tt> reduces to <tt>((\u03bb''x''.''x'')''y'') ((\u03bb''x''.''x'')''y'')</tt>, which has two redexes, but in call by need they are represented using the same object rather than copied, so when one is reduced the other is too.\n\n=== A note about complexity ===\nWhile the idea of \u03b2-reduction seems simple enough, it is not an atomic step, in that it must have a non-trivial cost when estimating [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=R. |last=Statman |authorlink=Richard Statman |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4567929 |title=The typed \u03bb-calculus is not elementary recursive |journal=Theoretical Computer Science |year=1979 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=73\u201381 |doi=10.1016/0304-3975(79)90007-0|hdl=2027.42/23535 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> To be precise, one must somehow find the location of all of the occurrences of the bound variable <tt>''V''</tt> in the expression <tt>''E''</tt>, implying a time cost, or one must keep track of these locations in some way, implying a space cost.

This means that various [[evaluation strategy#Nondeterministic strategies|nondeterministic evaluation strategies]] are relevant. However, the lambda calculus does not offer any explicit constructs for [[parallel computing|parallelism]]. One can add constructs such as [[Futures and promises|Futures]] to the lambda calculus. Other [[process calculi]] have been developed for describing communication and concurrency.\n\n=== Optimal reduction ===\nIn L\u00e9vy's 1988 paper \"[http://pauillac.inria.fr/~levy/pubs/88icot.pdf Sharing in the Evaluation of lambda Expressions]\", he defines a notion of optimal sharing, such that no work is ''duplicated''. For example, performing a \u03b2-reduction in normal order on <tt>(\u03bb''x''.''xx'') (II)</tt> reduces it to <tt>II (II)</tt>. The argument <tt>II</tt> is duplicated by the application to the first lambda term. If the reduction was done in an applicative order first, we save work because work is not duplicated: <tt>(\u03bb''x''.''xx'') (II)</tt> reduces to <tt>(\u03bb''x''.''xx'') I</tt>. On the other hand, using applicative order can result in redundant reductions or even possibly never reduce to normal form. For example, performing a \u03b2-reduction in normal order on <tt>(\u03bb''f''.f I) (\u03bby.(\u03bb''x''.''xx'') (y I))</tt> yields <tt>(\u03bby.(\u03bb''x''.''xx'') (y I)) I</tt>, <tt>(\u03bb''x''.''xx'') (II)</tt> which we know we can do without duplicating work. Doing the same but in applicative order yields <tt>(\u03bb''f''.f I) (\u03bby.y I (y I))</tt>, <tt>(\u03bby.y I (y I)) I</tt>, <tt>I I (I I)</tt>, and now work is duplicated.\n\nL\u00e9vy shows the existence of lambda terms where there ''does not exist'' a sequence of reductions which reduces them without duplicating work. The below lambda term is such an example.\n\n<tt>((\u03bbg.(g(g(\u03bbx.x))))\n(\u03bbh.((\u03bbf.(f(f(\u03bbz.z))))\n(\u03bbw.(h(w(\u03bby.y)))))))</tt>\n\nIt is composed of three similar terms, <tt>x=((\u03bbg. ... ) (\u03bbh.y))</tt> and <tt>y=((\u03bbf. ...) (\u03bbw.z) )</tt>, and finally <tt>z=\u03bbw.(h(w(\u03bby.y)))</tt>. There are only two possible \u03b2-reductions to be done here, on x and on y. Reducing the outer x term first results in the inner y term being duplicated, and each copy will have to be reduced, but reducing the inner y term first will duplicate its argument z, which will cause work to be duplicated when the values of h and w are made known. Incidentally, the above term reduces to the identity function <tt>(\u03bby.y)</tt>, and is constructed by making wrappers which make the identity function available to the binders <tt>g=\u03bbh...</tt>, <tt>f=\u03bbw...</tt>, <tt>h=\u03bbx.x</tt> (at first), and <tt>w=\u03bbz.z</tt> (at first), all of which are applied to the innermost term <tt>\u03bby.y</tt>.\n\nThe precise notion of duplicated work relies on noticing that after the first reduction of <tt>I I</tt> is done, the value of the other <tt>I I</tt> can be determined, because they have the same structure (and in fact they have exactly the same values), and result from a common ancestor. Such similar structures can each be assigned a label that can be tracked across reductions. If a name is assigned to the redex that produces all the resulting <tt>II</tt> terms, and then all duplicated occurrences of <tt>II</tt> can be tracked and reduced in one go. However, it is not obvious that a redex will produce the <tt>II</tt> term. Identifying the structures that are similar in different parts of a lambda term can involve a complex algorithm and can possibly have a complexity equal to the history of the reduction itself.\n\nWhile L\u00e9vy defines the notion of optimal sharing, he does not provide an algorithm to do it. In Vincent van Oostrom, Kees-Jan van de Looij, and Marijn Zwitserlood's paper ''[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237723293_Lambdascope_Another_optimal_implementation_of_the_lambda-calculus Lambdascope: Another optimal implementation of the lambda-calculus]'', they provide such an algorithm by transforming lambda terms into [[interaction nets]], which are then reduced. Roughly speaking, the resulting reduction is optimal because every term that would have the same labels as per L\u00e9vy's paper would also be the same graph in the interaction net. In the paper, they mention that their prototype implementation of Lambdascope performs as well as the ''optimised'' version of the reference optimal higher order machine BOHM.\n\nMore details can be found in the short article [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312462365_About_the_efficient_reduction_of_lambda_terms About the efficient reduction of lambda terms].\n\n== Semantics ==\nThe fact that lambda calculus terms act as functions on other lambda calculus terms, and even on themselves, led to questions about the semantics of the lambda calculus. Could a sensible meaning be assigned to lambda calculus terms? The natural semantics was to find a set ''D'' isomorphic to the function space ''D'' \u2192 ''D'', of functions on itself. However, no nontrivial such ''D'' can exist, by [[cardinality]] constraints because the set of all functions from ''D'' to ''D'' has greater cardinality than ''D'', unless ''D'' is a [[singleton set]].\n\nIn the 1970s, [[Dana Scott]] showed that, if only [[Scott continuity|continuous functions]] were considered, a set or [[Domain theory|domain]] ''D'' with the required property could be found, thus providing a [[Model theory|model]] for the lambda calculus.\n\nThis work also formed the basis for the [[denotational semantics]] of programming languages.\n\n== Variations and extensions ==\nThese extensions are in the [[lambda cube]]:\n* [[Typed lambda calculus]] \u2013 Lambda calculus with typed variables (and functions)\n* [[System F]] \u2013 A typed lambda calculus with type-variables\n* [[Calculus of constructions]] \u2013 A typed lambda calculus with [[type system|types]] as first-class values\n\nThese [[formal system]]s are extensions of lambda calculus that are not in the lambda cube:\n* [[Binary lambda calculus]] \u2013 A version of lambda calculus with binary I/O, a binary encoding of terms, and a designated universal machine.\n* [[Lambda-mu calculus]] \u2013 An extension of the lambda calculus for treating [[classical logic]]\n\nThese formal systems are variations of lambda calculus:\n* [[Kappa calculus]] \u2013 A first-order analogue of lambda calculus\n\nThese formal systems are related to lambda calculus:\n* [[Combinatory logic]] \u2013 A notation for mathematical logic without variables\n* [[SKI combinator calculus]] \u2013 A computational system based on the '''[[#S|S]]''', '''[[#K|K]]''' and '''[[#I|I]]''' combinators, equivalent to lambda calculus, but reducible without variable substitutions\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Mathematics}}\n{{colbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Applicative computing systems]] \u2013 Treatment of [[object (computer science)|objects]] in the style of the lambda calculus\n* [[Cartesian closed category]] \u2013 A setting for lambda calculus in [[category theory]]\n* [[Categorical abstract machine]] \u2013 A [[model of computation]] applicable to lambda calculus\n* [[Curry\u2013Howard isomorphism]] \u2013 The formal correspondence between programs and [[mathematical proof|proofs]]\n* [[De Bruijn index]] \u2013 notation disambiguating alpha conversions\n* [[De Bruijn notation]] \u2013 notation using postfix modification functions \n* [[Deductive lambda calculus]] \u2013 The consideration of the problems associated with considering lambda calculus as a [[Deductive system]].\n* [[Domain theory]] \u2013 Study of certain [[partially ordered sets|posets]] giving [[denotational semantics]] for lambda calculus\n* [[Evaluation strategy]] \u2013 Rules for the evaluation of expressions in [[programming language]]s\n* [[Explicit substitution]] \u2013 The theory of substitution, as used in [[#\u03b2-reduction|\u03b2-reduction]]\n* [[Functional programming]]\n* [[Harrop formula]] \u2013 A kind of constructive logical formula such that proofs are lambda terms\n* [[Interaction nets]]\n* [[Kleene\u2013Rosser paradox]] \u2013 A demonstration that some form of lambda calculus is inconsistent\n* [[Knights of the Lambda Calculus]] \u2013 A semi-fictional organization of LISP and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hackers]]\n* [[Krivine machine]] \u2013 An abstract machine to interpret call-by-name in lambda calculus\n* [[Lambda calculus definition]] \u2013 Formal definition of the lambda calculus.\n* [[Let expression]] \u2013 An expression closely related to an abstraction.\n* [[Minimalism (computing)]]\n* [[Rewriting]] \u2013 Transformation of formul\u00e6 in formal systems\n* [[SECD machine]] \u2013 A [[virtual machine]] designed for the lambda calculus\n* [[Scott\u2013Curry theorem]] \u2013 A theorem about sets of lambda terms\n* [[To Mock a Mockingbird]] \u2013 An introduction to [[Haskell (programming language)]] and lambda calculus\n* [[Universal Turing machine]] \u2013 A formal computing machine that is equivalent to lambda calculus\n* [[Unlambda]] \u2013 An [[esoteric programming language|esoteric]] functional programming language based on combinatory logic\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Abelson, Harold & Gerald Jay Sussman.

It is a universal [[model of computation]] that can be used to simulate any [[Turing machine]]. It was introduced by the mathematician [[Alonzo Church]] in the 1930s as part of his research into the [[foundations of mathematics]].\n\nLambda calculus consists of constructing lambda terms and performing reduction operations on them. In the simplest form of lambda calculus, terms are built using only the following rules:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Syntax !! Name !! Description\n|-\n| ''x'' || Variable || A character or string representing a parameter or mathematical/logical value.\n|-\n| (\u03bb''x''.''M'') || Abstraction || Function definition (''M'' is a lambda term). The variable ''x'' becomes [[Free variables and bound variables|bound]] in the expression.\n|-\n| (''M'' ''N'') || Application || Applying a function to an argument. M and N are lambda terms.\n|}\n\nproducing expressions such as: (\u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.(\u03bb''z''.(\u03bb''x''.''z x'') (\u03bb''y''.''z y'')) (''x y'')). Parentheses can be dropped if the expression is unambiguous. For some applications, terms for logical and mathematical constants and operations may be included.\n\nThe reduction operations include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Operation !! Name !! Description\n|-\n| (\u03bb''x''.''M''[''x'']) \u2192 (\u03bb''y''.''M''[''y'']) || \u03b1-conversion || Renaming the bound variables in the expression. Used to avoid [[name collision]]s.\n|-\n| ((\u03bb''x''.''M'') ''E'') \u2192 (''M''[''x'' := ''E'']) || \u03b2-reduction || Replacing the bound variables with the argument expression in the body of the abstraction.\n|}\n\nIf [[De Bruijn index]]ing is used, then \u03b1-conversion is no longer required as there will be no name collisions. If [[Reduction strategy (lambda calculus)|repeated application]] of the reduction steps eventually terminates, then by the [[Church\u2013Rosser theorem]] it will produce a [[Beta normal form|\u03b2-normal form]].\n\nVariable names are not needed if using a universal lambda function, such as [[Iota and Jot]], which can create any function behavior by calling it on itself in various combinations.\n\n== Explanation and applications ==\nLambda calculus is [[Turing completeness|Turing complete]], that is, it is a universal [[model of computation]] that can be used to simulate any [[Turing machine]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=A.

In typed lambda calculus, functions can be applied only if they are capable of accepting the given input's \"type\" of data. Typed lambda calculi are ''weaker'' than the untyped lambda calculus, which is the primary subject of this article, in the sense that ''typed lambda calculi can express less'' than the untyped calculus can, but on the other hand typed lambda calculi allow more things to be proved; in the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] it is, for example, a theorem that every evaluation strategy terminates for every simply typed lambda-term, whereas evaluation of untyped lambda-terms need not terminate. One reason there are many different typed lambda calculi has been the desire to do more (of what the untyped calculus can do) without giving up on being able to prove strong theorems about the calculus.\n\nLambda calculus has applications in many different areas in [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]],<ref>[[Thierry Coquand|Coquand, Thierry]], [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/type-theory/ \"Type Theory\"], ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2013 Edition), Edward N.

According to Cardone and Hindley (2006):\n<blockquote>\nBy the way, why did Church choose the notation \u201c\u03bb\u201d? In [an unpublished 1964 letter to Harald Dickson] he stated clearly that it came from the notation \u201c<math>\\hat{x}</math>\u201d used for class-abstraction by [[Principia Mathematica|Whitehead and Russell]], by first modifying \u201c<math>\\hat{x}</math>\u201d to \u201c\u2227<math>x</math>\u201d to distinguish function-abstraction from class-abstraction, and then changing \u201c\u2227\u201d to \u201c\u03bb\u201d for ease of printing.\n\nThis origin was also reported in [Rosser, 1984, p.338]. On the other hand, in his later years Church told two enquirers that the choice was more accidental: a symbol was needed and \u03bb just happened to be chosen.\n</blockquote>\n[[Dana Scott]] has also addressed this controversy in various public lectures.<ref>Dana Scott, \"[https://www.youtube.com/embed/uS9InrmPIoc Looking Backward; Looking Forward]\", Invited Talk at the Workshop in honour of Dana Scott\u2019s 85th birthday and 50 years of domain theory, 7\u20138 July, FLoC 2018 (talk 7 July 2018).

(See also this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=juXwu0Nqc3I extract of a May 2016 talk] at the University of Birmingham, UK.)</ref>\nScott recounts that he once posed a question about the origin of the lambda symbol to Church's son-in-law John Addison, who then wrote his father-in-law a postcard:\n<blockquote>\nDear Professor Church,\n\nRussell had the iota operator, Hilbert had the epsilon operator. Why did you choose lambda for your operator?\n</blockquote>\nAccording to Scott, Church's entire response consisted of returning the postcard with the following annotation: \"[[eeny, meeny, miny, moe]]\".\n\n== Informal description ==\n{{no footnotes|section|date=September 2013}}\n\n=== Motivation ===\n[[Computable function]]s are a fundamental concept within computer science and mathematics. The lambda calculus provides a simple [[Semantics#Computer science|semantics]] for computation, enabling properties of computation to be studied formally. The lambda calculus incorporates two simplifications that make this semantics simple.\nThe first simplification is that the lambda calculus treats functions \"anonymously\", without giving them explicit names. For example, the function \n: <math>\\operatorname{square\\_sum}(x, y) = x^2 + y^2</math>\ncan be rewritten in ''anonymous form'' as \n: <math>(x, y) \\mapsto x^2 + y^2</math>\n(read as \"a tuple of {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} is [[Map (mathematics)|mapped]] to <math display=\"inline\">x^2 + y^2</math>\"). Similarly, \n: <math>\\operatorname{id}(x) = x</math>\ncan be rewritten in anonymous form as\n: <math>x \\mapsto x</math>\nwhere the input is simply mapped to itself.\n\nThe second simplification is that the lambda calculus only uses functions of a single input. An ordinary function that requires two inputs, for instance the <math display=\"inline\">\\operatorname{square\\_sum}</math> function, can be reworked into an equivalent function that accepts a single input, and as output returns ''another'' function, that in turn accepts a single input. For example, \n: <math>(x, y) \\mapsto x^2 + y^2</math>\ncan be reworked into \n: <math>x \\mapsto (y \\mapsto x^2 + y^2)</math>\nThis method, known as [[currying]], transforms a function that takes multiple arguments into a chain of functions each with a single argument.\n\n[[Function application]] of the <math display=\"inline\">\\operatorname{square\\_sum}</math> function to the arguments (5, 2), yields at once\n: <math display=\"inline\">((x, y) \\mapsto x^2 + y^2)(5, 2)</math>\n: <math display=\"inline\"> = 5^2 + 2^2 </math>\n: <math display=\"inline\"> = 29</math>,\nwhereas evaluation of the curried version requires one more step\n: <math display=\"inline\">\\Bigl(\\bigl(x \\mapsto (y \\mapsto x^2 + y^2)\\bigr)(5)\\Bigr)(2)</math>\n: <math display=\"inline\"> = (y \\mapsto 5^2 + y^2)(2)</math> // the definition of <math>x</math> has been used with <math>5</math> in the inner expression. This is like \u03b2-reduction.\n: <math display=\"inline\"> = 5^2 + 2^2</math> // the definition of <math>y</math> has been used with <math>2</math>. Again, similar to \u03b2-reduction.\n: <math display=\"inline\"> = 29</math>\nto arrive at the same result.\n\n=== The lambda calculus ===\nThe lambda calculus consists of a language of '''lambda terms''', which is defined by a certain formal syntax, and a set of transformation rules, which allow manipulation of the lambda terms. These transformation rules can be viewed as an [[equational theory]] or as an [[operational definition]].\n\nAs described above, all functions in the lambda calculus are anonymous functions, having no names. They only accept one input variable, with [[currying]] used to implement functions with several variables.\n\n==== Lambda terms ====\nThe syntax of the lambda calculus defines some expressions as valid lambda calculus expressions and some as invalid, just as some strings of characters are valid [[C (programming language)|C]] programs and some are not. A valid lambda calculus expression is called a \"lambda term\".\n\nThe following three rules give an [[inductive definition]] that can be applied to build all syntactically valid lambda terms:\n* a variable, <math>x</math>, is itself a valid lambda term\n* if <math>t</math> is a lambda term, and <math>x</math> is a variable, then <math>(\\lambda x.t)</math> is a lambda term (called an '''abstraction''');\n* if <math>t</math> and <math>s</math> are lambda terms, then <math>(ts)</math> is a lambda term (called an '''application''').\nNothing else is a lambda term. Thus a lambda term is valid if and only if it can be obtained by repeated application of these three rules. However, some parentheses can be omitted according to certain rules. For example, the outermost parentheses are usually not written. See ''[[#Notation|Notation]]'', below.\n\nAn '''abstraction''' <math>\\lambda x.t</math> is a definition of an anonymous function that is capable of taking a single input <math>x</math> and substituting it into the expression <math>t</math>. \nIt thus defines an anonymous function that takes <math>x</math> and returns <math>t</math>. For example, <math>\\lambda x.x^2+2</math> is an abstraction for the function <math>f(x) = x^2 + 2</math> using the term <math>x^2+2</math> for <math>t</math>. The definition of a function with an abstraction merely \"sets up\" the function but does not invoke it. The abstraction [[Free variables and bound variables|binds]] the variable <math>x</math> in the term <math>t</math>.\n\nAn '''application''' <math>ts</math> represents the application of a function <math>t</math> to an input <math>s</math>, that is, it represents the act of calling function <math>t</math> on input <math>s</math> to produce <math>t(s)</math>.\n\nThere is no concept in lambda calculus of variable declaration. In a definition such as <math>\\lambda x.x+y</math> (i.e. <math>f(x) = x + y</math>), the lambda calculus treats <math>y</math> as a variable that is not yet defined. The abstraction <math>\\lambda x.x+y</math> is syntactically valid, and represents a function that adds its input to the yet-unknown <math>y</math>.\n\nBracketing may be used and may be needed to disambiguate terms. For example, <math>\\lambda x.((\\lambda x.x)x)</math> and <math>(\\lambda x.(\\lambda x.x)) x</math> denote different terms (although they coincidentally reduce to the same value). Here, the first example defines a function whose lambda term is the result of applying x to the child function, while the second example is the application of the outermost function to the input x, which returns the child function. Therefore, both examples evaluate to the [[identity function]] <math>\\lambda x.x</math>.\n\n==== Functions that operate on functions ====\nIn lambda calculus, functions are taken to be '[[First-class object|first class values]]', so functions may be used as the inputs, or be returned as outputs from other functions.\n\nFor example, <math>\\lambda x.x</math> represents the [[identity function]], <math>x \\mapsto x</math>, and <math>(\\lambda x.x)y</math> represents the identity function applied to <math>y</math>. Further, <math>(\\lambda x.y)</math> represents the '''constant function''' <math>x \\mapsto y</math>, the function that always returns <math>y</math>, no matter the input. In lambda calculus, function application is regarded as [[Operator associativity|left-associative]], so that <math>stx</math> means <math>(st)x</math>.\n\nThere are several notions of \"equivalence\" and \"reduction\" that allow lambda terms to be \"reduced\" to \"equivalent\" lambda terms.\n\n==== Alpha equivalence ====\nA basic form of equivalence, definable on lambda terms, is alpha equivalence. It captures the intuition that the particular choice of a bound variable, in an abstraction, does not (usually) matter.\nFor instance, <math>\\lambda x.x</math> and <math>\\lambda y.y</math> are alpha-equivalent lambda terms, and they both represent the same function (the identity function). \nThe terms <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are not alpha-equivalent, because they are not bound in an abstraction.\nIn many presentations, it is usual to identify alpha-equivalent lambda terms.\n\nThe following definitions are necessary in order to be able to define \u03b2-reduction:\n\n==== Free variables ====\nThe '''free variables''' of a term are those variables not bound by an abstraction. The set of free variables of an expression is defined inductively:\n* The free variables of <math>x</math> are just <math>x</math>\n* The set of free variables of <math>\\lambda x.t</math> is the set of free variables of <math>t</math>, but with <math>x</math> removed\n* The set of free variables of <math>ts</math> is the union of the set of free variables of <math>t</math> and the set of free variables of <math>s</math>.\n\nFor example, the lambda term representing the identity <math>\\lambda x.x</math> has no free variables, but the function <math>\\lambda x. yx</math> has a single free variable, <math>y</math>.\n\n==== Capture-avoiding substitutions ====\nSuppose <math>t</math>, <math>s</math> and <math>r</math> are lambda terms and <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are variables.\nThe notation <math>t[x := r]</math> indicates substitution of <math>r</math> for <math>x</math> in <math>t</math> in a ''capture-avoiding'' manner. This is defined so that:\n* <math>x[x := r] = r</math>;\n* <math>y[x := r] = y</math> if <math>x \\neq y</math>;\n* <math>(ts)[x := r] = (t[x := r])(s[x := r])</math>;\n* <math>(\\lambda x.t)[x := r] = \\lambda x.t</math>;\n* <math>(\\lambda y.t)[x := r] = \\lambda y.(t[x := r])</math> if <math>x \\neq y</math> and <math>y</math> is not in the free variables of <math>r</math>. The variable <math>y</math> is said to be \"fresh\" for <math>r</math>.\n\nFor example, <math>(\\lambda x.x)[y := y] = \\lambda x.(x[y := y]) = \\lambda x.x</math>, and <math>((\\lambda x.y)x)[x := y] = ((\\lambda x.y)[x := y])(x[x := y]) = (\\lambda x.y)y</math>.\n\nThe freshness condition (requiring that <math>y</math> is not in the free variables of <math>r</math>) is crucial in order to ensure that substitution does not change the meaning of functions.\nFor example, a substitution is made that ignores the freshness condition: <math>(\\lambda x.y)[y := x] = \\lambda x.(y[y := x]) = \\lambda x.x</math>. This substitution turns the constant function <math>\\lambda x.y</math> into the identity <math>\\lambda x.x</math> by substitution.\n\nIn general, failure to meet the freshness condition can be remedied by alpha-renaming with a suitable fresh variable.\nFor example, switching back to our correct notion of substitution, in <math>(\\lambda x.y)[y := x]</math> the abstraction can be renamed with a fresh variable <math>z</math>, to obtain <math>(\\lambda z.y)[y := x] = \\lambda z.(y[y := x]) = \\lambda z.x</math>, and the meaning of the function is preserved by substitution.\n\n==== \u03b2-reduction ====\nThe \u03b2-reduction rule states that an application of the form <math>( \\lambda x . t) s</math> reduces to the term <math> t [ x := s]</math>. The notation <math>( \\lambda x . t ) s \\to t [ x := s ] </math> is used to indicate that <math>( \\lambda x .t ) s </math> \u03b2-reduces to <math> t [ x := s ] </math>.\nFor example, for every <math>s</math>, <math>( \\lambda x . x ) s \\to x[ x := s ] = s </math>. This demonstrates that <math> \\lambda x . x </math> really is the identity.\nSimilarly, <math>( \\lambda x . y ) s \\to y [ x := s ] = y </math>, which demonstrates that <math> \\lambda x . y </math> is a constant function.\n\nThe lambda calculus may be seen as an idealised version of a functional programming language, like [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] or [[Standard ML]].\nUnder this view, \u03b2-reduction corresponds to a computational step. This step can be repeated by additional \u03b2-reductions until there are no more applications left to reduce. In the untyped lambda calculus, as presented here, this reduction process may not terminate.\nFor instance, consider the term <math>\\Omega = (\\lambda x . xx)( \\lambda x . xx )</math>.\nHere <math>( \\lambda x . xx)( \\lambda x . xx) \\to ( xx )[ x := \\lambda x . xx ] = ( x [ x := \\lambda x . xx ] )( x [ x := \\lambda x . xx ] ) = ( \\lambda x . xx)( \\lambda x . xx )</math>.\nThat is, the term reduces to itself in a single \u03b2-reduction, and therefore the reduction process will never terminate.\n\nAnother aspect of the untyped lambda calculus is that it does not distinguish between different kinds of data.\nFor instance, it may be desirable to write a function that only operates on numbers. However, in the untyped lambda calculus, there is no way to prevent a function from being applied to [[truth value]]s, strings, or other non-number objects.\n\n== Formal definition ==\n{{main|Lambda calculus definition}}\n\n=== Definition ===\nLambda expressions are composed of:\n* variables ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, ...;\n* the abstraction symbols \u03bb (lambda) and .

In an expression \u03bb''x''.''M'', the part \u03bb''x'' is often called ''binder'', as a hint that the variable ''x'' is getting bound by appending \u03bb''x'' to ''M''. All other variables are called ''free''. For example, in the expression \u03bb''y''.''x x y'', ''y'' is a bound variable and ''x'' is a free variable. Also a variable is bound by its nearest abstraction. In the following example the single occurrence of ''x'' in the expression is bound by the second lambda: \u03bb''x''.''y'' (\u03bb''x''.''z x'').\n\nThe set of ''free variables'' of a lambda expression, ''M'', is denoted as FV(''M'') and is defined by recursion on the structure of the terms, as follows:\n# FV(''x'') = {''x''}, where ''x'' is a variable.\n# FV(\u03bb''x''.''M'') = FV(''M'') \\ {''x''}.\n# FV(''M N'') = FV(''M'') \u222a FV(''N'').<ref name=\"BarendregtBarendsen\">{{Citation\n | last = Barendregt\n | first = Henk\n | author-link = Henk Barendregt\n | last2 = Barendsen\n | first2 = Erik\n | author2-link =\n | title = Introduction to Lambda Calculus\n | place =\n | publisher =\n | date = March 2000\n | volume =\n | edition =\n | url = ftp://ftp.cs.ru.nl/pub/CompMath.Found/lambda.pdf\n | doi =\n | id =\n | isbn = }}</ref>\n\nAn expression that contains no free variables is said to be ''closed''.

G. B. |doi=10.1111/j.1746-8361.1988.tb00919.x |title=A Proof-Theoretic Account of Programming and the Role of Reduction Rules |journal=Dialectica |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=265\u2013282 |year=1988}}</ref>\n\nThere are three kinds of reduction:\n* '''\u03b1-conversion''': changing bound variables;\n* '''\u03b2-reduction''': applying functions to their arguments;\n* '''\u03b7-reduction''': which captures a notion of extensionality.\n\nWe also speak of the resulting equivalences: two expressions are ''\u03b1-equivalent'', if they can be \u03b1-converted into the same expression. \u03b2-equivalence and \u03b7-equivalence are defined similarly.\n\nThe term ''redex'', short for ''reducible expression'', refers to subterms that can be reduced by one of the reduction rules. For example, (\u03bb''x''.''M'') ''N'' is a \u03b2-redex in expressing the substitution of ''N'' for ''x'' in ''M''. The expression to which a redex reduces is called its ''reduct''; the reduct of (\u03bb''x''.''M'') ''N'' is ''M''[''x'' := ''N''].\n\nIf ''x'' is not free in ''M'', \u03bb''x''.''M x'' is also an \u03b7-redex, with a reduct of ''M''.\n\n=== \u03b1-conversion ===\n\u03b1-conversion, sometimes known as \u03b1-renaming,<ref>{{Citation |title=Design concepts in programming languages |last1=Turbak |first1=Franklyn |last2=Gifford |first2=David |year=2008 |publisher=MIT press |page=251| isbn=978-0-262-20175-9}}</ref> allows bound variable names to be changed. For example, \u03b1-conversion of \u03bb''x''.''x'' might yield \u03bb''y''.''y''. Terms that differ only by \u03b1-conversion are called ''\u03b1-equivalent''. Frequently, in uses of lambda calculus, \u03b1-equivalent terms are considered to be equivalent.\n\nThe precise rules for \u03b1-conversion are not completely trivial. First, when \u03b1-converting an abstraction, the only variable occurrences that are renamed are those that are bound to the same abstraction. For example, an \u03b1-conversion of \u03bb''x''.\u03bb''x''.''x'' could result in \u03bb''y''.\u03bb''x''.''x'', but it could ''not'' result in \u03bb''y''.\u03bb''x''.''y''. The latter has a different meaning from the original. This is analogous to the programming notion of [[variable shadowing]].\n\nSecond, \u03b1-conversion is not possible if it would result in a variable getting captured by a different abstraction. For example, if we replace ''x'' with ''y'' in \u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.''x'', we get \u03bb''y''.\u03bb''y''.''y'', which is not at all the same.\n\nIn programming languages with static scope, \u03b1-conversion can be used to make [[Name resolution (programming languages)|name resolution]] simpler by ensuring that no variable name [[Variable shadowing|masks]] a name in a containing [[scope (programming)|scope]] (see [[Name resolution (programming languages)#Alpha renaming to make name resolution trivial|\u03b1-renaming to make name resolution trivial]]).\n\nIn the [[De Bruijn index]] notation, any two \u03b1-equivalent terms are syntactically identical.\n\n==== Substitution ====\nSubstitution, written ''M''[''V'' := ''N''], is the process of replacing all ''free'' occurrences of the variable ''V'' in the expression ''M'' with expression ''N''. Substitution on terms of the lambda calculus is defined by recursion on the structure of terms, as follows (note: x and y are only variables while M and N are any lambda expression):\n\n: ''x''[''x'' := ''N''] = ''N''\n: ''y''[''x'' := ''N''] = ''y'', if ''x'' \u2260 ''y''\n: (''M''<sub>1</sub> ''M''<sub>2</sub>)[''x'' := ''N''] = (''M''<sub>1</sub>[''x'' := ''N'']) (''M''<sub>2</sub>[''x'' := ''N''])\n: (\u03bb''x''.''M'')[''x'' := ''N''] = \u03bb''x''.''M''\n: (\u03bb''y''.''M'')[''x'' := ''N''] = \u03bb''y''.(''M''[''x'' := ''N'']), if ''x'' \u2260 ''y'' and ''y'' \u2209 FV(''N'')\n\nTo substitute into an abstraction, it is sometimes necessary to \u03b1-convert the expression. For example, it is not correct for (\u03bb''x''.''y'')[''y'' := ''x''] to result in \u03bb''x''.''x'', because the substituted ''x'' was supposed to be free but ended up being bound. The correct substitution in this case is \u03bb''z''.''x'', up to \u03b1-equivalence. Substitution is defined uniquely up to \u03b1-equivalence.\n\n=== \u03b2-reduction ===\n\u03b2-reduction captures the idea of function application. \u03b2-reduction is defined in terms of substitution: the \u03b2-reduction of (\u03bb''V''.''M'') ''N'' is ''M''[''V'' := ''N''].\n\nFor example, assuming some encoding of 2, 7, \u00d7, we have the following \u03b2-reduction: (\u03bb''n''.''n'' \u00d7 2) 7 \u2192 7 \u00d7 2.\n\n\u03b2-reduction can be seen to be the same as the concept of ''local reducibility'' in [[natural deduction]], via the [[Curry\u2013Howard isomorphism]].\n\n=== \u03b7-reduction ===\n\u03b7-reduction expresses the idea of [[extensionality]], which in this context is that two functions are the same [[if and only if]] they give the same result for all arguments. \u03b7-reduction converts between \u03bb''x''.''f'' ''x'' and ''f'' whenever ''x'' does not appear free in ''f''.\n\n\u03b7-reduction can be seen to be the same as the concept of ''local completeness'' in [[natural deduction]], via the [[Curry\u2013Howard isomorphism]].\n\n== Normal forms and confluence ==\n{{main|Normalization property (abstract rewriting)}}\nFor the untyped lambda calculus, \u03b2-reduction as a [[rewrite system|rewriting rule]] is neither [[strongly normalising]] nor [[weakly normalising]].\n\nHowever, it can be shown that \u03b2-reduction is [[confluence (abstract rewriting)|confluent]] when working up to \u03b1-conversion (i.e. we consider two normal forms to be equal if it is possible to \u03b1-convert one into the other).\n\nTherefore, both strongly normalising terms and weakly normalising terms have a unique normal form. For strongly normalising terms, any reduction strategy is guaranteed to yield the normal form, whereas for weakly normalising terms, some reduction strategies may fail to find it.\n\n== Encoding datatypes ==\n{{main|Church encoding|Mogensen\u2013Scott encoding}}\nThe basic lambda calculus may be used to model booleans, [[arithmetic]], data structures and recursion, as illustrated in the following sub-sections.\n\n=== Arithmetic in lambda calculus ===\nThere are several possible ways to define the [[natural number]]s in lambda calculus, but by far the most common are the [[Church numeral]]s, which can be defined as follows:\n: <tt>0 := \u03bb''f''.\u03bb''x''.''x''</tt>\n: <tt>1 := \u03bb''f''.\u03bb''x''.''f'' ''x''</tt>\n: <tt>2 := \u03bb''f''.\u03bb''x''.''f'' (''f'' ''x'')</tt>\n: <tt>3 := \u03bb''f''.\u03bb''x''.''f'' (''f'' (''f'' ''x''))</tt>\nand so on. Or using the alternative syntax presented above in ''[[#Notation|Notation]]'':\n\n: <tt>0 := \u03bb''fx''.''x''</tt>\n: <tt>1 := \u03bb''fx''.''f'' ''x''</tt>\n: <tt>2 := \u03bb''fx''.''f'' (''f'' ''x'')</tt>\n: <tt>3 := \u03bb''fx''.''f'' (''f'' (''f'' ''x''))</tt>\n\nA Church numeral is a [[higher-order function]]\u2014it takes a single-argument function <tt>''f''</tt>, and returns another single-argument function. The Church numeral <tt>''n''</tt> is a function that takes a function <tt>''f''</tt> as argument and returns the <tt>''n''</tt>-th composition of <tt>''f''</tt>, i.e. the function <tt>''f''</tt> composed with itself <tt>''n''</tt> times. This is denoted <tt>''f''<sup>(''n'')</sup></tt> and is in fact the <tt>''n''</tt>-th power of <tt>''f''</tt> (considered as an operator); <tt>''f''<sup>(0)</sup></tt> is defined to be the identity function. Such repeated compositions (of a single function <tt>''f''</tt>) obey the [[laws of exponents]], which is why these numerals can be used for arithmetic. (In Church's original lambda calculus, the formal parameter of a lambda expression was required to occur at least once in the function body, which made the above definition of <tt>0</tt> impossible.)\n\nOne way of thinking about the Church numeral <tt>''n''</tt>, which is often useful when analysing programs, is as an instruction 'repeat ''n'' times'. For example, using the <tt>PAIR</tt> and <tt>NIL</tt> functions defined below, one can define a function that constructs a (linked) list of ''n'' elements all equal to ''x'' by repeating 'prepend another ''x'' element' ''n'' times, starting from an empty list. The lambda term is\n: <tt>\u03bb''n''.\u03bb''x''.''n'' (PAIR ''x'') NIL</tt>\nBy varying what is being repeated, and varying what argument that function being repeated is applied to, a great many different effects can be achieved.\n\nWe can define a successor function, which takes a Church numeral <tt>''n''</tt> and returns <tt>''n'' + 1</tt> by adding another application of <tt>''f''</tt>, where '(mf)x' means the function 'f' is applied 'm' times on 'x':\n: <tt>SUCC := \u03bb''n''.\u03bb''f''.\u03bb''x''.''f'' (''n'' ''f'' ''x'')</tt>\nBecause the <tt>''m''</tt>-th composition of <tt>''f''</tt> composed with the <tt>''n''</tt>-th composition of <tt>''f''</tt> gives the <tt>''m''+''n''</tt>-th composition of <tt>''f''</tt>, addition can be defined as follows:\n: <tt>PLUS := \u03bb''m''.\u03bb''n''.\u03bb''f''.\u03bb''x''.''m'' ''f'' (''n'' ''f'' ''x'')</tt>\n<tt>PLUS</tt> can be thought of as a function taking two natural numbers as arguments and returning a natural number; it can be verified that\n: <tt>PLUS 2 3</tt>\nand\n: <tt>5</tt>\nare \u03b2-equivalent lambda expressions. Since adding <tt>''m''</tt> to a number <tt>''n''</tt> can be accomplished by adding 1 <tt>''m''</tt> times, an alternative definition is:\n: <tt>PLUS := \u03bb''m''.\u03bb''n''.''m'' SUCC ''n&thinsp;''</tt><ref>{{Citation\n | last1 = Felleisen\n | first1 = Matthias\n | last2 = Flatt\n | first2 = Matthew\n | authorlink =\n | title = Programming Languages and Lambda Calculi\n | publisher =\n | year = 2006\n | location =\n | page = 26\n | url = http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/publications/pllc.pdf\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090205113235/http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/publications/pllc.pdf\n | archive-date = 2009-02-05\n | doi =\n | id =\n | isbn = }}; a note (accessed 2017) at the original location suggests that the authors consider the work originally referenced to have been superseded by a book.</ref>\nSimilarly, multiplication can be defined as\n: <tt>MULT := \u03bb''m''.\u03bb''n''.\u03bb''f''.''m'' (''n'' ''f'')</tt><ref name=\"Selinger\" />\nAlternatively\n: <tt>MULT := \u03bb''m''.\u03bb''n''.''m'' (PLUS ''n'') 0</tt>\nsince multiplying <tt>''m''</tt> and <tt>''n''</tt> is the same as repeating the add <tt>''n''</tt> function <tt>''m''</tt> times and then applying it to zero.\nExponentiation has a rather simple rendering in Church numerals, namely\n: <tt>POW := \u03bb''b''.\u03bb''e''.''e'' ''b''</tt><ref name=\"BarendregtBarendsen\"/>\nThe predecessor function defined by <tt>PRED ''n'' = ''n'' \u2212 1</tt> for a positive integer <tt>''n''</tt> and <tt>PRED 0 = 0</tt> is considerably more difficult.

Defining\n: <tt>SUB := \u03bb''m''.\u03bb''n''.''n'' PRED ''m''</tt>,\n<tt>SUB ''m'' ''n''</tt> yields <tt>''m'' \u2212 ''n''</tt> when <tt>''m'' > ''n''</tt> and <tt>0</tt> otherwise.\n\n=== Logic and predicates ===\nBy convention, the following two definitions (known as Church booleans) are used for the boolean values <tt>TRUE</tt> and <tt>FALSE</tt>:\n: <tt>TRUE := \u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.''x''</tt>\n: <tt>FALSE := \u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.''y''</tt>\n:: (Note that <tt>FALSE</tt> is equivalent to the Church numeral zero defined above)\nThen, with these two lambda terms, we can define some logic operators (these are just possible formulations; other expressions are equally correct):\n: <tt>AND := \u03bb''p''.\u03bb''q''.''p'' ''q'' ''p''</tt>\n: <tt>OR := \u03bb''p''.\u03bb''q''.''p'' ''p'' ''q''</tt>\n: <tt>NOT := \u03bb''p''.''p'' FALSE TRUE</tt>\n: <tt>IFTHENELSE := \u03bb''p''.\u03bb''a''.\u03bb''b''.''p'' ''a'' ''b''</tt>\nWe are now able to compute some logic functions, for example:\n\n: <tt>AND TRUE FALSE</tt>\n:: <tt>\u2261 (\u03bb''p''.\u03bb''q''.''p'' ''q'' ''p'') TRUE FALSE \u2192<sub>\u03b2</sub> TRUE FALSE TRUE</tt>\n:: <tt>\u2261 (\u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.''x'') FALSE TRUE \u2192<sub>\u03b2</sub>  FALSE</tt>\nand we see that <tt>AND TRUE FALSE</tt> is equivalent to <tt>FALSE</tt>.\n\nA ''predicate'' is a function that returns a boolean value. The most fundamental predicate is <tt>ISZERO</tt>, which returns <tt>TRUE</tt> if its argument is the Church numeral <tt>0</tt>, and <tt>FALSE</tt> if its argument is any other Church numeral:\n: <tt>ISZERO := \u03bb''n''.''n'' (\u03bb''x''.FALSE) TRUE</tt>\nThe following predicate tests whether the first argument is less-than-or-equal-to the second:\n: <tt>LEQ := \u03bb''m''.\u03bb''n''.ISZERO (SUB ''m'' ''n'')</tt>,\nand since <tt>''m'' = ''n''</tt>, if <tt>LEQ ''m'' ''n''</tt> and <tt>LEQ ''n'' ''m''</tt>, it is straightforward to build a predicate for numerical equality.\n\nThe availability of predicates and the above definition of <tt>TRUE</tt> and <tt>FALSE</tt> make it convenient to write \"if-then-else\" expressions in lambda calculus. For example, the predecessor function can be defined as:\n: <tt>PRED := \u03bb''n''.''n'' (\u03bb''g''.\u03bb''k''.ISZERO (''g'' 1) ''k'' (PLUS (''g'' ''k'') 1)) (\u03bb''v''.0) 0 </tt>\nwhich can be verified by showing inductively that <tt>''n'' (\u03bb''g''.\u03bb''k''.ISZERO (''g'' 1) ''k'' (PLUS (''g'' ''k'') 1)) (\u03bb''v''.0)</tt> is the add <tt>''n''</tt> \u2212 1 function for <tt>''n''</tt> > 0.\n\n=== Pairs ===\nA pair (2-tuple) can be defined in terms of <tt>TRUE</tt> and <tt>FALSE</tt>, by using the [[Church encoding#Church pairs|Church encoding for pairs]]. For example, <tt>PAIR</tt> encapsulates the pair (<tt>''x''</tt>,<tt>''y''</tt>), <tt>FIRST</tt> returns the first element of the pair, and <tt>SECOND</tt> returns the second.\n\n: <tt>PAIR := \u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.\u03bb''f''.''f'' ''x'' ''y''</tt>\n: <tt>FIRST := \u03bb''p''.''p'' TRUE</tt>\n: <tt>SECOND := \u03bb''p''.''p'' FALSE</tt>\n: <tt>NIL := \u03bb''x''.TRUE </tt>\n: <tt>NULL := \u03bb''p''.''p'' (\u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.FALSE)</tt>\n\nA linked list can be defined as either NIL for the empty list, or the <tt>PAIR</tt> of an element and a smaller list. The predicate <tt>NULL</tt> tests for the value <tt>NIL</tt>. (Alternatively, with <tt>NIL := FALSE</tt>, the construct <tt>''l'' (\u03bb''h''.\u03bb''t''.\u03bb''z''.deal_with_head_''h''_and_tail_''t'') (deal_with_nil)</tt> obviates the need for an explicit NULL test).\n\nAs an example of the use of pairs, the shift-and-increment function that maps <tt>(''m'', ''n'')</tt> to <tt>(''n'', ''n'' + 1)</tt> can be defined as\n: <tt>\u03a6 := \u03bb''x''.PAIR (SECOND ''x'') (SUCC (SECOND ''x''))</tt>\nwhich allows us to give perhaps the most transparent version of the predecessor function:\n: <tt>PRED := \u03bb''n''.FIRST (''n'' \u03a6 (PAIR 0 0)).</tt>\n\n== Additional programming techniques ==\nThere is a considerable body of [[programming idiom]]s for lambda calculus. Many of these were originally developed in the context of using lambda calculus as a foundation for programming language semantics, effectively using lambda calculus as a [[low-level programming language]]. Because several programming languages include the lambda calculus (or something very similar) as a fragment, these techniques also see use in practical programming, but may then be perceived as obscure or foreign.\n\n=== Named constants ===\nIn lambda calculus, a [[library (computing)|library]] would take the form of a collection of previously defined functions, which as lambda-terms are merely particular constants. The pure lambda calculus does not have a concept of named constants since all atomic lambda-terms are variables, but one can emulate having named constants by setting aside a variable as the name of the constant, using abstraction to bind that variable in the main body, and apply that abstraction to the intended definition. Thus to use <tt>''f''</tt> to mean ''M'' (some explicit lambda-term) in ''N'' (another lambda-term, the \"main program\"), one can say\n: <tt>(\u03bb''f''.</tt>''N''<tt>)</tt> ''M''\nAuthors often introduce [[syntactic sugar]], such as <tt>let</tt>, to permit writing the above in the more intuitive order\n: <tt>let ''f'' = </tt>''M''<tt> in </tt>''N''\nBy chaining such definitions, one can write a lambda calculus \"program\" as zero or more function definitions, followed by one lambda-term using those functions that constitutes the main body of the program.\n\nA notable restriction of this <tt>let</tt> is that the name <tt>''f''</tt> is not defined in ''M'', since ''M'' is outside the scope of the abstraction binding <tt>''f''</tt>; this means a recursive function definition cannot be used as the ''M'' with <tt>let</tt>. The more advanced <tt>letrec</tt> syntactic sugar construction that allows writing recursive function definitions in that naive style instead additionally employs fixed-point combinators.\n\n=== Recursion and fixed points ===\n{{main|Fixed-point combinator}}\n{{see also|SKI combinator calculus#Self-application and recursion}}\n[[Recursion]] is the definition of a function using the function itself. Lambda calculus cannot express this as directly as some other notations: all functions are anonymous in lambda calculus, so we can't refer to a value which is yet to be defined, inside the lambda term defining that same value. However, recursion can still be achieved by arranging for a lambda expression to receive itself as its argument value, for example in&ensp; <tt>(\u03bb''x''.''x'' ''x'') ''E''</tt>.\n\nConsider the [[factorial]] function <tt>F(''n'')</tt> recursively defined by\n\n: <tt>F(''n'') = 1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' &times; F(''n'' \u2212 1)</tt>.\n\nIn the lambda expression which is to represent this function, a ''parameter'' (typically the first one) will be assumed to receive the lambda expression itself as its value, so that calling it &ndash; applying it to an argument &ndash; will amount to recursion. Thus to achieve recursion, the intended-as-self-referencing argument (called <tt>''r''</tt> here) must always be passed to itself within the function body, at a call point:\n\n: <tt>G := \u03bb''r''. \u03bb''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' &times; (''r'' ''r'' (''n''\u22121)))</tt>\n::: with&ensp; <tt> ''r'' ''r'' ''x'' = F ''x'' = G ''r'' ''x''</tt> &ensp;to hold, so&ensp; <tt>''r'' = G</tt> &ensp;and\n: <tt>F := G G = (\u03bb''x''.''x'' ''x'') G</tt>\n\nThe self-application achieves replication here, passing the function's lambda expression on to the next invocation as an argument value, making it available to be referenced and called there.\n\nThis solves it but requires re-writing each recursive call as self-application. We would like to have a generic solution, without a need for any re-writes:\n\n: <tt>G := \u03bb''r''. \u03bb''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' &times; (''r'' (''n''\u22121)))</tt>\n::: with&ensp; <tt> ''r'' ''x'' = F ''x'' = G ''r'' ''x''</tt> &ensp;to hold, so&ensp; <tt>''r'' = G ''r'' =: FIX G</tt> &ensp;and\n: <tt>F := FIX G</tt> &ensp;where&ensp; <tt>FIX ''g'' := (''r'' where ''r'' = ''g'' ''r'') = ''g'' (FIX ''g'')</tt>\n::: so that&ensp; <tt> FIX G = G (FIX G) = (\u03bb''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' &times; ((FIX G) (''n''\u22121)))) </tt>\n\nGiven a lambda term with first argument representing recursive call (e.g. <tt>G</tt> here), the ''fixed-point'' combinator <tt>FIX</tt> will return a self-replicating lambda expression representing the recursive function (here, <tt>F</tt>). The function does not need to be explicitly passed to itself at any point, for the self-replication is arranged in advance, when it is created, to be done each time it is called. Thus the original lambda expression <tt>(FIX G)</tt> is re-created inside itself, at call-point, achieving [[self-reference]].\n\nIn fact, there are many possible definitions for this <tt>FIX</tt> operator, the simplest of them being:\n\n: <tt>'''Y''' := \u03bb''g''.(\u03bb''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')) (\u03bb''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x''))</tt>\n\nIn the lambda calculus, <tt>'''Y''' ''g''</tt>&thinsp; is a fixed-point of <tt>''g''</tt>, as it expands to:\n\n: <tt>'''Y''' ''g''</tt>\n: <tt>(\u03bb''h''.(\u03bb''x''.''h'' (''x'' ''x'')) (\u03bb''x''.''h'' (''x'' ''x''))) ''g''</tt>\n: <tt>(\u03bb''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')) (\u03bb''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x''))</tt>\n: <tt>''g'' ((\u03bb''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')) (\u03bb''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')))</tt>\n: <tt>''g'' ('''Y''' ''g'')</tt>\n\nNow, to perform our recursive call to the factorial function, we would simply call <tt>('''Y''' G) ''n''</tt>,&nbsp; where ''n'' is the number we are calculating the factorial of. Given ''n'' = 4, for example, this gives:\n\n: <tt>('''Y''' G) 4 </tt>\n: <tt>G ('''Y''' G) 4 </tt>\n: <tt>(\u03bb''r''.\u03bb''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' \u00d7 (''r'' (''n''\u22121)))) ('''Y''' G) 4</tt>\n: <tt>(\u03bb''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' \u00d7 (('''Y''' G) (''n''\u22121)))) 4</tt>\n: <tt>1, if 4 = 0; else 4 \u00d7 (('''Y''' G) (4\u22121))</tt>\n: <tt>4 \u00d7 (G ('''Y''' G) (4\u22121))</tt>\n: <tt>4 \u00d7 ((\u03bb''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' \u00d7 (('''Y''' G) (''n''\u22121)))) (4\u22121))</tt>\n: <tt>4 \u00d7 (1, if 3 = 0; else 3 \u00d7 (('''Y''' G) (3\u22121)))</tt>\n: <tt>4 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 (G ('''Y''' G) (3\u22121)))</tt>\n: <tt>4 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 ((\u03bb''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' \u00d7 (('''Y''' G) (''n''\u22121)))) (3\u22121)))</tt>\n: <tt>4 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 (1, if 2 = 0; else 2 \u00d7 (('''Y''' G) (2\u22121))))</tt>\n: <tt>4 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 (G ('''Y''' G) (2\u22121))))</tt>\n: <tt>4 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 ((\u03bb''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' \u00d7 (('''Y''' G) (''n''\u22121)))) (2\u22121))))</tt>\n: <tt>4 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 (1, if 1 = 0; else 1 \u00d7 (('''Y''' G) (1\u22121)))))</tt>\n: <tt>4 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 (1 \u00d7 (G ('''Y''' G) (1\u22121)))))</tt>\n: <tt>4 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 (1 \u00d7 ((\u03bb''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' \u00d7 (('''Y''' G) (''n''\u22121)))) (1\u22121)))))</tt>\n: <tt>4 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 (1 \u00d7 (1, if 0 = 0; else 0 \u00d7 (('''Y''' G) (0\u22121))))))</tt>\n: <tt>4 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 (1 \u00d7 (1))))</tt>\n: <tt>24</tt>\n\nEvery recursively defined function can be seen as a fixed point of some suitably defined function closing over the recursive call with an extra argument, and therefore, using <tt>'''Y'''</tt>, every recursively defined function can be expressed as a lambda expression. In particular, we can now cleanly define the subtraction, multiplication and comparison predicate of natural numbers recursively.\n\n=== Standard terms ===\nCertain terms have commonly accepted names {{Citation needed|reason=There should be at least a source here|date=March 2020}}:\n: {{anchor|I}} <tt>'''I''' := \u03bb''x''.''x''</tt>\n: {{anchor|K}} <tt>'''K''' := \u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.''x''</tt>\n: {{anchor|S}} <tt>'''S''' := \u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.\u03bb''z''.''x'' ''z'' (''y'' ''z'') </tt>\n: {{anchor|B}} <tt>'''B''' := \u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.\u03bb''z''.''x'' (''y'' ''z'') </tt>\n: {{anchor|C}} <tt>'''C''' := \u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.\u03bb''z''.''x'' ''z'' ''y''</tt>\n: {{anchor|W}} <tt>'''W''' := \u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.''x'' ''y'' ''y''</tt>\n: {{anchor|U}} <tt>'''U''' := \u03bb''x''.''x'' ''x''  </tt>\n: {{anchor|omega}} <tt>'''\u03c9''' := \u03bb''x''.''x'' ''x'' </tt>\n: {{anchor|Omega}} <tt>'''\u03a9''' := '''\u03c9 \u03c9''' </tt>\n: {{anchor|Y}} <tt>'''Y''' := \u03bb''g''.(\u03bb''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')) (\u03bb''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x''))</tt>\nSeveral of these have direct applications in the ''elimination of abstraction'' that turns lambda terms into [[combinator calculus]] terms.\n\n=== Abstraction elimination ===\n{{main|Combinatory logic#Completeness of the S-K basis}}\nIf ''N'' is a lambda-term without abstraction, but possibly containing named constants ([[combinatory logic|combinators]]), then there exists a lambda-term ''T''(<tt>''x''</tt>,''N'') which is equivalent to <tt>\u03bb''x''.</tt>''N'' but lacks abstraction (except as part of the named constants, if these are considered non-atomic). This can also be viewed as anonymising variables, as ''T''(<tt>''x''</tt>,''N'') removes all occurrences of <tt>''x''</tt> from ''N'', while still allowing argument values to be substituted into the positions where ''N'' contains an <tt>''x''</tt>. The conversion function ''T'' can be defined by:\n: ''T''(<tt>''x''</tt>, <tt>''x''</tt>) := '''I'''\n: ''T''(<tt>''x''</tt>, ''N'') := '''K''' ''N'' if <tt>''x''</tt> is not free in ''N''.\n: ''T''(<tt>''x''</tt>, ''M'' ''N'') := '''S''' ''T''(<tt>''x''</tt>, ''M'') ''T''(<tt>''x''</tt>, ''N'')\nIn either case, a term of the form ''T''(<tt>''x''</tt>,''N'') ''P'' can reduce by having the initial combinator '''I''', '''K''', or '''S''' grab the argument ''P'', just like \u03b2-reduction of <tt>(\u03bb''x''.</tt>''N''<tt>)</tt> ''P'' would do. '''I''' returns that argument. '''K''' throws the argument away, just like <tt>(\u03bb''x''.</tt>''N''<tt>)</tt> would do if <tt>''x''</tt> has no free occurrence in ''N''. '''S''' passes the argument on to both subterms of the application, and then applies the result of the first to the result of the second.\n\nThe combinators '''B''' and '''C''' are similar to '''S''', but pass the argument on to only one subterm of an application ('''B''' to the \"argument\" subterm and '''C''' to the \"function\" subterm), thus saving a subsequent '''K''' if there is no occurrence of <tt>''x''</tt> in one subterm. In comparison to '''B''' and '''C''', the '''S''' combinator actually conflates two functionalities: rearranging arguments, and duplicating an argument so that it may be used in two places. The '''W''' combinator does only the latter, yielding the [[B, C, K, W system]] as an alternative to [[SKI combinator calculus]].\n\n== Typed lambda calculus ==\n{{main|Typed lambda calculus}}\nA '''typed lambda calculus''' is a typed [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]] that uses the lambda-symbol (<math>\\lambda</math>) to denote anonymous function abstraction. In this context, types are usually objects of a syntactic nature that are assigned to lambda terms; the exact nature of a type depends on the calculus considered (see kinds below). From a certain point of view, typed lambda calculi can be seen as refinements of the [[untyped lambda calculus]] but from another point of view, they can also be considered the more fundamental theory and ''untyped lambda calculus'' a special case with only one type.<ref>Types and Programming Languages, p. 273, Benjamin C. Pierce</ref>\n\nTyped lambda calculi are foundational [[programming languages]] and are the base of typed [[functional programming languages]] such as [[ML programming language|ML]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and, more indirectly, typed [[imperative programming|imperative programming languages]]. Typed lambda calculi play an important role in the design of [[type systems]] for programming languages; here typability usually captures desirable properties of the program, e.g. the program will not cause a memory access violation.\n\nTyped lambda calculi are closely related to [[mathematical logic]] and [[proof theory]] via the [[Curry\u2013Howard isomorphism]] and they can be considered as the [[internal language]] of classes of [[category theory|categories]], e.g. the simply typed lambda calculus is the language of [[cartesian closed category|Cartesian closed categories]] (CCCs).\n\n== Computable functions and lambda calculus ==\nA function ''F'': '''N''' \u2192 '''N''' of natural numbers is a computable function if and only if there exists a lambda expression ''f'' such that for every pair of ''x'', ''y'' in '''N''', ''F''(''x'')=''y'' if and only if ''f'' <tt>''x''</tt>&nbsp;=<sub>\u03b2</sub>&nbsp;<tt>''y''</tt>,&nbsp; where <tt>''x''</tt> and <tt>''y''</tt> are the Church numerals corresponding to ''x'' and ''y'', respectively and =<sub>\u03b2</sub> meaning equivalence with \u03b2-reduction. This is one of the many ways to define computability; see the [[Church\u2013Turing thesis]] for a discussion of other approaches and their equivalence.\n\n== Undecidability of equivalence ==\nThere is no algorithm that takes as input any two lambda expressions and outputs <tt>TRUE</tt> or <tt>FALSE</tt> depending on whether or not the two expressions are equivalent.<ref name=\"Church1936\" /> More precisely, no [[computable function]] can [[decision problem|decide]] the equivalence. This was historically the first problem for which undecidability could be proven. As usual for such a proof, ''computable'' means computable by any [[model of computation]] that is [[Turing complete]].\n\nChurch's proof first reduces the problem to determining whether a given lambda expression has a ''normal form''. A normal form is an equivalent expression that cannot be reduced any further under the rules imposed by the form. Then he assumes that this predicate is computable, and can hence be expressed in lambda calculus. Building on earlier work by Kleene and constructing a [[G\u00f6del numbering]] for lambda expressions, he constructs a lambda expression <tt>''e''</tt> that closely follows the proof of [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems|G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem]]. If <tt>''e''</tt> is applied to its own G\u00f6del number, a contradiction results.\n\n== Lambda calculus and programming languages ==\nAs pointed out by [[Peter Landin]]'s 1965 paper \"A Correspondence between ALGOL 60 and Church's Lambda-notation\",<ref>{{cite journal |title=A Correspondence between ALGOL 60 and Church's Lambda-notation |first=P. J. |last=Landin |authorlink=Peter Landin |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=8 |issue=2 |year=1965 |pages=89\u2013101 |doi=10.1145/363744.363749}}</ref> sequential [[procedural programming|procedural programming languages]] can be understood in terms of the lambda calculus, which provides the basic mechanisms for procedural abstraction and procedure (subprogram) application.\n\n=== Anonymous functions ===\n{{main|Anonymous function}}\nFor example, in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] the \"square\" function can be expressed as a lambda expression as follows:\n<!-- Please do not add the same example in different languages to this article, see Anonymous function for that. Thank you! -->\n<source lang=\"Lisp\">\n(lambda (x) (* x x))\n</source>\n\nThe above example is an expression that evaluates to a first-class function. The symbol <code>lambda</code> creates an anonymous function, given a list of parameter names, <code>(x)</code> \u2013 just a single argument in this case, and an expression that is evaluated as the body of the function, <code>(* x x)</code>. Anonymous functions are sometimes called lambda expressions.\n\nFor example, [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and many other imperative languages have long supported passing [[subprograms]] as [[arguments]] to other subprograms through the mechanism of [[function pointers]]. However, function pointers are not a sufficient condition for functions to be [[First-class function|first class]] datatypes, because a function is a first class datatype if and only if new instances of the function can be created at run-time. And this run-time creation of functions is supported in [[Smalltalk]], [[JavaScript]], and more recently in [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] (\"agents\"), [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] (\"delegates\") and [[C++11]], among others.\n\n=== Reduction strategies ===\n{{details|Evaluation strategy}}\nWhether a term is normalising or not, and how much work needs to be done in normalising it if it is, depends to a large extent on the reduction strategy used. The distinction between reduction strategies relates to the distinction in functional programming languages between [[eager evaluation]] and [[lazy evaluation]].\n\n; Full \u03b2-reductions: Any redex can be reduced at any time. This means essentially the lack of any particular reduction strategy\u2014with regard to reducibility, \"all bets are off\".\n; Applicative order: The leftmost, innermost redex is always reduced first. Intuitively this means a function's arguments are always reduced before the function itself. Applicative order always attempts to apply functions to normal forms, even when this is not possible.\n: Most programming languages (including Lisp, ML and imperative languages like C and [[Java programming language|Java]]) are described as \"strict\", meaning that functions applied to non-normalising arguments are non-normalising. This is done essentially using applicative order, call by value reduction ([[#Call by value|see below]]), but usually called \"eager evaluation\".\n; Normal order: The leftmost, outermost redex is always reduced first. That is, whenever possible the arguments are substituted into the body of an abstraction before the arguments are reduced.\n; {{visible anchor|Call by value}}: Only the outermost redexes are reduced: a redex is reduced only when its right hand side has reduced to a value (variable or abstraction).\n; Call by name: As normal order, but no reductions are performed inside abstractions. For example, <tt>\u03bb''x''.(\u03bb''x''.''x'')''x''</tt> is in normal form according to this strategy, although it contains the redex <tt>(\u03bb''x''.''x'')''x''</tt>.\n; Call by need: As normal order, but function applications that would duplicate terms instead name the argument, which is then reduced only \"when it is needed\". Called in practical contexts \"lazy evaluation\". In implementations this \"name\" takes the form of a pointer, with the redex represented by a [[thunk]].\n\nApplicative order is not a normalising strategy. The usual counterexample is as follows: define <tt>'''\u03a9''' = \u03c9\u03c9</tt> where <tt>'''\u03c9''' = \u03bb''x''.''xx''</tt>. This entire expression contains only one redex, namely the whole expression; its reduct is again <tt>'''\u03a9'''</tt>. Since this is the only available reduction, <tt>'''\u03a9'''</tt> has no normal form (under any evaluation strategy). Using applicative order, the expression <tt>'''KI\u03a9''' = (\u03bb''x''.\u03bb''y''.''x'') (\u03bb''x''.''x'')'''\u03a9'''</tt> is reduced by first reducing <tt>'''\u03a9'''</tt> to normal form (since it is the rightmost redex), but since <tt>'''\u03a9'''</tt> has no normal form, applicative order fails to find a normal form for <tt>'''KI\u03a9'''</tt>.\n\nIn contrast, normal order is so called because it always finds a normalising reduction, if one exists. In the above example, <tt>'''KI\u03a9'''</tt> reduces under normal order to ''I'', a normal form. A drawback is that redexes in the arguments may be copied, resulting in duplicated computation (for example, <tt>(\u03bb''x''.''xx'') ((\u03bb''x''.''x'')''y'')</tt> reduces to <tt>((\u03bb''x''.''x'')''y'') ((\u03bb''x''.''x'')''y'')</tt> using this strategy; now there are two redexes, so full evaluation needs two more steps, but if the argument had been reduced first, there would now be none).\n\nThe positive tradeoff of using applicative order is that it does not cause unnecessary computation, if all arguments are used, because it never substitutes arguments containing redexes and hence never needs to copy them (which would duplicate work). In the above example, in applicative order <tt>(\u03bb''x''.''xx'') ((\u03bb''x''.''x'')''y'')</tt> reduces first to <tt>(\u03bb''x''.''xx'')''y''</tt> and then to the normal order <tt>''yy''</tt>, taking two steps instead of three.\n\nMost ''purely'' functional programming languages (notably [[Miranda (programming language)|Miranda]] and its descendants, including Haskell), and the proof languages of [[Automated theorem prover|theorem provers]], use ''lazy evaluation'', which is essentially the same as call by need. This is like normal order reduction, but call by need manages to avoid the duplication of work inherent in normal order reduction using ''sharing''. In the example given above, <tt>(\u03bb''x''.''xx'') ((\u03bb''x''.''x'')''y'')</tt> reduces to <tt>((\u03bb''x''.''x'')''y'') ((\u03bb''x''.''x'')''y'')</tt>, which has two redexes, but in call by need they are represented using the same object rather than copied, so when one is reduced the other is too.\n\n=== A note about complexity ===\nWhile the idea of \u03b2-reduction seems simple enough, it is not an atomic step, in that it must have a non-trivial cost when estimating [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=R. |last=Statman |authorlink=Richard Statman |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4567929 |title=The typed \u03bb-calculus is not elementary recursive |journal=Theoretical Computer Science |year=1979 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=73\u201381 |doi=10.1016/0304-3975(79)90007-0|hdl=2027.42/23535 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> To be precise, one must somehow find the location of all of the occurrences of the bound variable <tt>''V''</tt> in the expression <tt>''E''</tt>, implying a time cost, or one must keep track of these locations in some way, implying a space cost.

This means that various [[evaluation strategy#Nondeterministic strategies|nondeterministic evaluation strategies]] are relevant. However, the lambda calculus does not offer any explicit constructs for [[parallel computing|parallelism]]. One can add constructs such as [[Futures and promises|Futures]] to the lambda calculus. Other [[process calculi]] have been developed for describing communication and concurrency.\n\n=== Optimal reduction ===\nIn L\u00e9vy's 1988 paper \"[http://pauillac.inria.fr/~levy/pubs/88icot.pdf Sharing in the Evaluation of lambda Expressions]\", he defines a notion of optimal sharing, such that no work is ''duplicated''. For example, performing a \u03b2-reduction in normal order on <tt>(\u03bb''x''.''xx'') (II)</tt> reduces it to <tt>II (II)</tt>. The argument <tt>II</tt> is duplicated by the application to the first lambda term. If the reduction was done in an applicative order first, we save work because work is not duplicated: <tt>(\u03bb''x''.''xx'') (II)</tt> reduces to <tt>(\u03bb''x''.''xx'') I</tt>. On the other hand, using applicative order can result in redundant reductions or even possibly never reduce to normal form. For example, performing a \u03b2-reduction in normal order on <tt>(\u03bb''f''.f I) (\u03bby.(\u03bb''x''.''xx'') (y I))</tt> yields <tt>(\u03bby.(\u03bb''x''.''xx'') (y I)) I</tt>, <tt>(\u03bb''x''.''xx'') (II)</tt> which we know we can do without duplicating work. Doing the same but in applicative order yields <tt>(\u03bb''f''.f I) (\u03bby.y I (y I))</tt>, <tt>(\u03bby.y I (y I)) I</tt>, <tt>I I (I I)</tt>, and now work is duplicated.\n\nL\u00e9vy shows the existence of lambda terms where there ''does not exist'' a sequence of reductions which reduces them without duplicating work. The below lambda term is such an example.\n\n<tt>((\u03bbg.(g(g(\u03bbx.x))))\n(\u03bbh.((\u03bbf.(f(f(\u03bbz.z))))\n(\u03bbw.(h(w(\u03bby.y)))))))</tt>\n\nIt is composed of three similar terms, <tt>x=((\u03bbg. ... ) (\u03bbh.y))</tt> and <tt>y=((\u03bbf. ...) (\u03bbw.z) )</tt>, and finally <tt>z=\u03bbw.(h(w(\u03bby.y)))</tt>. There are only two possible \u03b2-reductions to be done here, on x and on y. Reducing the outer x term first results in the inner y term being duplicated, and each copy will have to be reduced, but reducing the inner y term first will duplicate its argument z, which will cause work to be duplicated when the values of h and w are made known. Incidentally, the above term reduces to the identity function <tt>(\u03bby.y)</tt>, and is constructed by making wrappers which make the identity function available to the binders <tt>g=\u03bbh...</tt>, <tt>f=\u03bbw...</tt>, <tt>h=\u03bbx.x</tt> (at first), and <tt>w=\u03bbz.z</tt> (at first), all of which are applied to the innermost term <tt>\u03bby.y</tt>.\n\nThe precise notion of duplicated work relies on noticing that after the first reduction of <tt>I I</tt> is done, the value of the other <tt>I I</tt> can be determined, because they have the same structure (and in fact they have exactly the same values), and result from a common ancestor. Such similar structures can each be assigned a label that can be tracked across reductions. If a name is assigned to the redex that produces all the resulting <tt>II</tt> terms, and then all duplicated occurrences of <tt>II</tt> can be tracked and reduced in one go. However, it is not obvious that a redex will produce the <tt>II</tt> term. Identifying the structures that are similar in different parts of a lambda term can involve a complex algorithm and can possibly have a complexity equal to the history of the reduction itself.\n\nWhile L\u00e9vy defines the notion of optimal sharing, he does not provide an algorithm to do it. In Vincent van Oostrom, Kees-Jan van de Looij, and Marijn Zwitserlood's paper ''[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237723293_Lambdascope_Another_optimal_implementation_of_the_lambda-calculus Lambdascope: Another optimal implementation of the lambda-calculus]'', they provide such an algorithm by transforming lambda terms into [[interaction nets]], which are then reduced. Roughly speaking, the resulting reduction is optimal because every term that would have the same labels as per L\u00e9vy's paper would also be the same graph in the interaction net. In the paper, they mention that their prototype implementation of Lambdascope performs as well as the ''optimised'' version of the reference optimal higher order machine BOHM.\n\nMore details can be found in the short article [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312462365_About_the_efficient_reduction_of_lambda_terms About the efficient reduction of lambda terms].\n\n== Semantics ==\nThe fact that lambda calculus terms act as functions on other lambda calculus terms, and even on themselves, led to questions about the semantics of the lambda calculus. Could a sensible meaning be assigned to lambda calculus terms? The natural semantics was to find a set ''D'' isomorphic to the function space ''D'' \u2192 ''D'', of functions on itself. However, no nontrivial such ''D'' can exist, by [[cardinality]] constraints because the set of all functions from ''D'' to ''D'' has greater cardinality than ''D'', unless ''D'' is a [[singleton set]].\n\nIn the 1970s, [[Dana Scott]] showed that, if only [[Scott continuity|continuous functions]] were considered, a set or [[Domain theory|domain]] ''D'' with the required property could be found, thus providing a [[Model theory|model]] for the lambda calculus.\n\nThis work also formed the basis for the [[denotational semantics]] of programming languages.\n\n== Variations and extensions ==\nThese extensions are in the [[lambda cube]]:\n* [[Typed lambda calculus]] \u2013 Lambda calculus with typed variables (and functions)\n* [[System F]] \u2013 A typed lambda calculus with type-variables\n* [[Calculus of constructions]] \u2013 A typed lambda calculus with [[type system|types]] as first-class values\n\nThese [[formal system]]s are extensions of lambda calculus that are not in the lambda cube:\n* [[Binary lambda calculus]] \u2013 A version of lambda calculus with binary I/O, a binary encoding of terms, and a designated universal machine.\n* [[Lambda-mu calculus]] \u2013 An extension of the lambda calculus for treating [[classical logic]]\n\nThese formal systems are variations of lambda calculus:\n* [[Kappa calculus]] \u2013 A first-order analogue of lambda calculus\n\nThese formal systems are related to lambda calculus:\n* [[Combinatory logic]] \u2013 A notation for mathematical logic without variables\n* [[SKI combinator calculus]] \u2013 A computational system based on the '''[[#S|S]]''', '''[[#K|K]]''' and '''[[#I|I]]''' combinators, equivalent to lambda calculus, but reducible without variable substitutions\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Mathematics}}\n{{colbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Applicative computing systems]] \u2013 Treatment of [[object (computer science)|objects]] in the style of the lambda calculus\n* [[Cartesian closed category]] \u2013 A setting for lambda calculus in [[category theory]]\n* [[Categorical abstract machine]] \u2013 A [[model of computation]] applicable to lambda calculus\n* [[Curry\u2013Howard isomorphism]] \u2013 The formal correspondence between programs and [[mathematical proof|proofs]]\n* [[De Bruijn index]] \u2013 notation disambiguating alpha conversions\n* [[De Bruijn notation]] \u2013 notation using postfix modification functions \n* [[Deductive lambda calculus]] \u2013 The consideration of the problems associated with considering lambda calculus as a [[Deductive system]].\n* [[Domain theory]] \u2013 Study of certain [[partially ordered sets|posets]] giving [[denotational semantics]] for lambda calculus\n* [[Evaluation strategy]] \u2013 Rules for the evaluation of expressions in [[programming language]]s\n* [[Explicit substitution]] \u2013 The theory of substitution, as used in [[#\u03b2-reduction|\u03b2-reduction]]\n* [[Functional programming]]\n* [[Harrop formula]] \u2013 A kind of constructive logical formula such that proofs are lambda terms\n* [[Interaction nets]]\n* [[Kleene\u2013Rosser paradox]] \u2013 A demonstration that some form of lambda calculus is inconsistent\n* [[Knights of the Lambda Calculus]] \u2013 A semi-fictional organization of LISP and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hackers]]\n* [[Krivine machine]] \u2013 An abstract machine to interpret call-by-name in lambda calculus\n* [[Lambda calculus definition]] \u2013 Formal definition of the lambda calculus.\n* [[Let expression]] \u2013 An expression closely related to an abstraction.\n* [[Minimalism (computing)]]\n* [[Rewriting]] \u2013 Transformation of formul\u00e6 in formal systems\n* [[SECD machine]] \u2013 A [[virtual machine]] designed for the lambda calculus\n* [[Scott\u2013Curry theorem]] \u2013 A theorem about sets of lambda terms\n* [[To Mock a Mockingbird]] \u2013 An introduction to [[Haskell (programming language)]] and lambda calculus\n* [[Universal Turing machine]] \u2013 A formal computing machine that is equivalent to lambda calculus\n* [[Unlambda]] \u2013 An [[esoteric programming language|esoteric]] functional programming language based on combinatory logic\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Abelson, Harold & Gerald Jay Sussman.

{"title_page": "Trolley problem", "text_new": "{{short description|Thought experiment in ethics}}\n[[File:Trolley problem.png|thumb|The trolley problem: should you pull the lever to divert the runaway trolley onto the side track?]]\nThe '''trolley problem''' is a [[thought experiment]] in [[ethics]] modeling an [[ethical dilemma]]. It is generally considered to represent a classic clash between two schools of moral thought, [[utilitarianism]] and [[deontological ethics]]. The general form of the problem is this:\n\n<blockquote>There is a runaway [[Tram|trolley]] barreling down the [[Track (rail transport)|railway tracks]]. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options: \n\n# Do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track.\n# Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person if they are on the track\n\nWhich is the more ethical option? Or, more simply: What is the right thing to do?\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Philippa Foot]] introduced this modern form of the problem in 1967.<ref name=\"Philippa Foot 1978\">Philippa Foot, \"[http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ362/hallam/Readings/FootDoubleEffect.pdf The Problem of Abortion and the Doctrine of the Double Effect]\" in ''Virtues and Vices'' (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1978) (originally appeared in the ''Oxford Review'', Number 5, 1967.)</ref> [[Judith Thomson]],<ref>Judith Jarvis Thomson, ''[https://learning.hccs.edu/faculty/david.poston/phil1301.80361/readings-for-march-31/JJ%20Thomson%20-%20Killing-%20Letting%20Die-%20and%20the%20Trolley%20Problem.pdf Killing, Letting Die, and the Trolley Problem]'', 59 The Monist 204-17 (1976)</ref><ref name=\"Judith Jarvis Thomson 1985\">Judith Jarvis Thomson, \"[http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/Courses/thomsonTROLLEY.pdf The Trolley Problem]\", 94 ''Yale Law Journal'' 1395\u20131415 (1985)</ref> [[Frances Kamm]],<ref>Francis Myrna Kamm, \"Harming Some to Save Others\", 57 ''Philosophical Studies'' 227-60 (1989)</ref> and [[Peter Unger]] have also analysed the [[dilemma]] extensively.<ref>Peter Unger, ''[[Living High and Letting Die]]'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996)</ref> \n\nEarlier forms of the problem predated Foot's publication. [[Frank Chapman Sharp]] included a version in a moral questionnaire given to undergraduates at the [[University of Wisconsin]] in 1905. In this variation, the railway's [[switchman]] controlled the switch, and the lone individual to be sacrificed (or not) was the switchman's child.<ref>Frank Chapman Sharp, ''A Study of the Influence of Custom on the Moral Judgment'' Bulletin of the University of Wisconsin no.236 (Madison, June 1908), 138.</ref><ref>Frank Chapman Sharp, ''Ethics'' (New York: The Century Co, 1928), 42-44, 122.</ref> The German philosopher of law [[Karl Engisch]] discussed a similar problem in his [[habilitation thesis]] in 1930 as well as the German legal scholar {{ill|Hans Welzel|de}} in a work of 1951.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Engisch|first=Karl|title=Untersuchungen \u00fcber Vorsatz und Fahrl\u00e4ssigkeit im Strafrecht|publisher=O.

The real culprit being unknown, the judge sees himself as able to prevent the bloodshed only by framing some innocent person and having him executed. Beside this example is placed another in which a pilot whose airplane is about to crash is deciding whether to steer from a more to a less inhabited area. To make the parallel as close as possible it may rather be supposed that he is the driver of a runaway tram which he can only steer from one narrow track on to another; five men are working on one track and one man on the other; anyone on the track he enters is bound to be killed. In the case of the riots the mob have five hostages, so that in both examples the exchange is supposed to be one man's life for the lives of five.<ref name=\"Philippa Foot 1978\" />}}\n\nA [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] view asserts that it is obligatory to steer to the track with one man on it. According to classical utilitarianism, such a decision would be not only permissible, but, morally speaking, the better option (the other option being no action at all).<ref>Barcalow, Emmett, ''Moral Philosophy: Theories and Issues.'' Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 2007. Print.</ref> An alternate viewpoint {{by whom|date=December 2019}} is that since moral wrongs are already in place in the situation, moving to another track constitutes a participation in the moral wrong, making one partially responsible for the death when otherwise no one would be responsible. An opponent of action may also point to the [[commensurability (ethics)|incommensurability]] of human lives. Under some interpretations of [[duty|moral obligation]], simply being present in this situation and being able to influence its outcome constitutes an obligation to participate. If this is the case, then deciding to do nothing would be considered an immoral act if one values five lives more than one.\n\n== Related problems ==\n[[File:The trolley problem.svg|thumbnail|upright=1.5|Five variants of the trolley problem: the original Switch, the Fat Man, the Fat Villain, the Loop and the Man in the Yard]]\nThe trolley problem is a specific ethical thought experiment among several that highlights the difference between [[deontological ethics|deontological]] and [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] ethical systems.<ref name=\":0\" />  The central question that these dilemmas bring to light is on whether or not it is right to actively inhibit the [[utility]] of an individual if doing so produces a greater utility for other individuals.\n\nThe initial trolley problem also supports comparison to other, related, dilemmas:\n\n=== The fat man ===\n{{quote|As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You are on a bridge under which it will pass, and you can stop it by putting something very heavy in front of it. As it happens, there is a very fat man next to you \u2013 your only way to stop the trolley is to push him over the bridge and onto the track, killing him to save five. Should you proceed?}}\n\nResistance to this course of action seems strong; when asked, a majority of people will approve of pulling the switch to save a net of four lives, but will disapprove of pushing the fat man to save a net of four lives.<ref>Peter Singer, ''Ethics and Intuitions'' The Journal of Ethics (2005). http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/200510--.pdf</ref> This has led to attempts to find a relevant moral distinction between the two cases.\n\nOne clear distinction is that in the first case, one does not intend harm towards anyone \u2013 harming the one is just a [[Unintended consequence|side effect]] of switching the trolley away from the five. However, in the second case, harming the one is an integral part of the plan to save the five. This is an argument which [[Shelly Kagan]] considers (and ultimately rejects) in his first book ''The Limits of Morality''.<ref>Shelly Kagan, ''The Limits of Morality'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989)</ref>\n\nA claim can be made that the difference between the two cases is that in the second, the subject intends someone's death to save the five, and this is wrong, whereas, in the first, they have no such intention. This solution is essentially an application of the [[doctrine of double effect]], which says that one may take action which has bad side effects, but deliberately intending harm (even for good causes) is wrong.\n\nAnother distinction is that the first case is similar to a pilot in an airplane that has lost power and is about to crash into a heavily populated area. Even if the pilot knows for sure that innocent people will die if he redirects the plane to a less populated area\u2014people who are \"uninvolved\"\u2014he will actively turn the plane without hesitation. It may well be considered noble to sacrifice one's own life to protect others, but morally or legally allowing murder of one innocent person to save five people may be [[insufficient justification]].{{Clarify|date=February 2012}}\n\n=== The fat villain ===\nThe further development of this example involves the case, where the fat man is, in fact, the villain who put these five people in peril. In this instance, pushing the villain to his death, especially to save five innocent people, seems not only morally justifiable but perhaps even imperative. This is essentially related to another thought experiment, known as [[ticking time bomb scenario]], which forces one to choose between two morally questionable acts.\n\n=== The loop variant ===\n\nThe claim that it is wrong to ''use'' the death of one to save five runs into a problem with variants like this:\n\n{{quote|As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people and you can divert it onto a secondary track. However, in this variant the secondary track later rejoins the main track, so diverting the trolley still leaves it on a track which leads to the five people. But, the person on the secondary track is a fat person who, when he is killed by the trolley, will stop it from continuing on to the five people. Should you flip the switch?}}\n\nThe only physical difference here is the addition of an extra piece of track.  This seems trivial since the trolley will never travel down it.  The reason this might affect someone's decision is that in this case, the death of the one actually is part of the plan to save the five.\n\nThe rejoining variant may not be fatal to the \"using a person as a means\" argument. This has been suggested by Michael J. Costa in his 1987 article \"Another Trip on the Trolley\", where he points out that if we fail to act in this scenario we will effectively be allowing the five to become a means to save the one.\n\n=== Transplant ===\nHere is an alternative case, due to [[Judith Jarvis Thomson]],<ref name=\"Judith Jarvis Thomson 1985\" /> containing similar numbers and results, but without a trolley:\n\n{{quote|A brilliant transplant surgeon has five patients, each in need of a different organ, each of whom will die without that organ. Unfortunately, there are no organs available to perform any of these five transplant operations. A healthy young traveler, just passing through the city the doctor works in, comes in for a routine checkup. In the course of doing the checkup, the doctor discovers that his organs are compatible with all five of his dying patients. Suppose further that if the young man were to disappear, no one would suspect the doctor. Do you support the morality of the doctor to kill that tourist and provide his healthy organs to those five dying people and save their lives?}}\n\n=== The man in the yard ===\nUnger argues extensively against traditional non-utilitarian responses to trolley problems. This is one of his examples:\n\n{{quote| As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You can divert its path by colliding another trolley into it, but if you do, both will be derailed and go down a hill, and into a yard where a man is sleeping in a hammock. He would be killed. Should you proceed?}}\n\nResponses to this are partly dependent on whether the reader has already encountered the standard trolley problem (since there is a desire to keep one's responses consistent), but Unger notes that people who have not encountered such problems before are quite likely to say that, in this case, the proposed action would be wrong.\n\nUnger therefore argues that different responses to these sorts of problems are based more on psychology than ethics \u2013 in this new case, he says, the only important difference is that the man in the yard does not seem particularly \"involved\". Unger claims that people therefore believe the man is not \"fair game\", but says that this lack of involvement in the scenario cannot make a moral difference.\n\nUnger also considers cases which are more complex than the original trolley problem, involving more than just two results. In one such case, it is possible to do something which will (a) save the five and kill four (passengers of one or more trolleys and/or the hammock-sleeper), (b) save the five and kill three, (c) save the five and kill two, (d) save the five and kill one, or (e) do nothing and let five die.\n\n== Empirical research ==\n{{See also|Moral psychology|Dual process theory (moral psychology)}}\nIn 2001, [[Joshua Greene (psychologist)|Joshua Greene]] and colleagues published the results of the first significant empirical investigation of people's responses to trolley problems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=Joshua D.|last2=Sommerville|first2=R.

To avoid the runaway train from entering the Union Pacific yards in Los Angeles, where it would not only cause damage, but a Metrolink passenger train was thought to be located, dispatchers ordered the shunting of the runaway cars to track 4, through an area with lower density housing of mostly lower income residents.

It is generally considered to represent a classic clash between two schools of moral thought, [[utilitarianism]] and [[deontological ethics]]. The general form of the problem is this:\n\n<blockquote>There is a runaway [[Tram|trolley]] barreling down the [[Track (rail transport)|railway tracks]]. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options: \n\n# Do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track.\n# Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.\n\nWhich is the more ethical option? Or, more simply: What is the right thing to do?\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Philippa Foot]] introduced this modern form of the problem in 1967.<ref name=\"Philippa Foot 1978\">Philippa Foot, \"[http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ362/hallam/Readings/FootDoubleEffect.pdf The Problem of Abortion and the Doctrine of the Double Effect]\" in ''Virtues and Vices'' (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1978) (originally appeared in the ''Oxford Review'', Number 5, 1967.)</ref> [[Judith Thomson]],<ref>Judith Jarvis Thomson, ''[https://learning.hccs.edu/faculty/david.poston/phil1301.80361/readings-for-march-31/JJ%20Thomson%20-%20Killing-%20Letting%20Die-%20and%20the%20Trolley%20Problem.pdf Killing, Letting Die, and the Trolley Problem]'', 59 The Monist 204-17 (1976)</ref><ref name=\"Judith Jarvis Thomson 1985\">Judith Jarvis Thomson, \"[http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/Courses/thomsonTROLLEY.pdf The Trolley Problem]\", 94 ''Yale Law Journal'' 1395\u20131415 (1985)</ref> [[Frances Kamm]],<ref>Francis Myrna Kamm, \"Harming Some to Save Others\", 57 ''Philosophical Studies'' 227-60 (1989)</ref> and [[Peter Unger]] have also analysed the [[dilemma]] extensively.<ref>Peter Unger, ''[[Living High and Letting Die]]'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996)</ref> \n\nEarlier forms of the problem predated Foot's publication.

The real culprit being unknown, the judge sees himself as able to prevent the bloodshed only by framing some innocent person and having him executed. Beside this example is placed another in which a pilot whose airplane is about to crash is deciding whether to steer from a more to a less inhabited area. To make the parallel as close as possible it may rather be supposed that he is the driver of a runaway tram which he can only steer from one narrow track on to another; five men are working on one track and one man on the other; anyone on the track he enters is bound to be killed. In the case of the riots the mob have five hostages, so that in both examples the exchange is supposed to be one man's life for the lives of five.<ref name=\"Philippa Foot 1978\" />}}\n\nA [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] view asserts that it is obligatory to steer to the track with one man on it. According to classical utilitarianism, such a decision would be not only permissible, but, morally speaking, the better option (the other option being no action at all).<ref>Barcalow, Emmett, ''Moral Philosophy: Theories and Issues.'' Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 2007. Print.</ref> An alternate viewpoint {{by whom|date=December 2019}} is that since moral wrongs are already in place in the situation, moving to another track constitutes a participation in the moral wrong, making one partially responsible for the death when otherwise no one would be responsible. An opponent of action may also point to the [[commensurability (ethics)|incommensurability]] of human lives. Under some interpretations of [[duty|moral obligation]], simply being present in this situation and being able to influence its outcome constitutes an obligation to participate. If this is the case, then deciding to do nothing would be considered an immoral act if one values five lives more than one.\n\n== Related problems ==\n[[File:The trolley problem.svg|thumbnail|upright=1.5|Five variants of the trolley problem: the original Switch, the Fat Man, the Fat Villain, the Loop and the Man in the Yard]]\nThe trolley problem is a specific ethical thought experiment among several that highlights the difference between [[deontological ethics|deontological]] and [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] ethical systems.<ref name=\":0\" />  The central question that these dilemmas bring to light is on whether or not it is right to actively inhibit the [[utility]] of an individual if doing so produces a greater utility for other individuals.\n\nThe initial trolley problem also supports comparison to other, related, dilemmas:\n\n=== The fat man ===\n{{quote|As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You are on a bridge under which it will pass, and you can stop it by putting something very heavy in front of it. As it happens, there is a very fat man next to you \u2013 your only way to stop the trolley is to push him over the bridge and onto the track, killing him to save five. Should you proceed?}}\n\nResistance to this course of action seems strong; when asked, a majority of people will approve of pulling the switch to save a net of four lives, but will disapprove of pushing the fat man to save a net of four lives.<ref>Peter Singer, ''Ethics and Intuitions'' The Journal of Ethics (2005). http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/200510--.pdf</ref> This has led to attempts to find a relevant moral distinction between the two cases.\n\nOne clear distinction is that in the first case, one does not intend harm towards anyone \u2013 harming the one is just a [[Unintended consequence|side effect]] of switching the trolley away from the five. However, in the second case, harming the one is an integral part of the plan to save the five. This is an argument which [[Shelly Kagan]] considers (and ultimately rejects) in his first book ''The Limits of Morality''.<ref>Shelly Kagan, ''The Limits of Morality'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989)</ref>\n\nA claim can be made that the difference between the two cases is that in the second, the subject intends someone's death to save the five, and this is wrong, whereas, in the first, they have no such intention. This solution is essentially an application of the [[doctrine of double effect]], which says that one may take action which has bad side effects, but deliberately intending harm (even for good causes) is wrong.\n\nAnother distinction is that the first case is similar to a pilot in an airplane that has lost power and is about to crash into a heavily populated area. Even if the pilot knows for sure that innocent people will die if he redirects the plane to a less populated area\u2014people who are \"uninvolved\"\u2014he will actively turn the plane without hesitation. It may well be considered noble to sacrifice one's own life to protect others, but morally or legally allowing murder of one innocent person to save five people may be [[insufficient justification]].{{Clarify|date=February 2012}}\n\n=== The fat villain ===\nThe further development of this example involves the case, where the fat man is, in fact, the villain who put these five people in peril. In this instance, pushing the villain to his death, especially to save five innocent people, seems not only morally justifiable but perhaps even imperative. This is essentially related to another thought experiment, known as [[ticking time bomb scenario]], which forces one to choose between two morally questionable acts.\n\n=== The loop variant ===\n\nThe claim that it is wrong to ''use'' the death of one to save five runs into a problem with variants like this:\n\n{{quote|As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people and you can divert it onto a secondary track. However, in this variant the secondary track later rejoins the main track, so diverting the trolley still leaves it on a track which leads to the five people. But, the person on the secondary track is a fat person who, when he is killed by the trolley, will stop it from continuing on to the five people. Should you flip the switch?}}\n\nThe only physical difference here is the addition of an extra piece of track.  This seems trivial since the trolley will never travel down it.  The reason this might affect someone's decision is that in this case, the death of the one actually is part of the plan to save the five.\n\nThe rejoining variant may not be fatal to the \"using a person as a means\" argument. This has been suggested by Michael J. Costa in his 1987 article \"Another Trip on the Trolley\", where he points out that if we fail to act in this scenario we will effectively be allowing the five to become a means to save the one.\n\n=== Transplant ===\nHere is an alternative case, due to [[Judith Jarvis Thomson]],<ref name=\"Judith Jarvis Thomson 1985\" /> containing similar numbers and results, but without a trolley:\n\n{{quote|A brilliant transplant surgeon has five patients, each in need of a different organ, each of whom will die without that organ. Unfortunately, there are no organs available to perform any of these five transplant operations. A healthy young traveler, just passing through the city the doctor works in, comes in for a routine checkup. In the course of doing the checkup, the doctor discovers that his organs are compatible with all five of his dying patients. Suppose further that if the young man were to disappear, no one would suspect the doctor. Do you support the morality of the doctor to kill that tourist and provide his healthy organs to those five dying people and save their lives?}}\n\n=== The man in the yard ===\nUnger argues extensively against traditional non-utilitarian responses to trolley problems. This is one of his examples:\n\n{{quote| As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You can divert its path by colliding another trolley into it, but if you do, both will be derailed and go down a hill, and into a yard where a man is sleeping in a hammock. He would be killed. Should you proceed?}}\n\nResponses to this are partly dependent on whether the reader has already encountered the standard trolley problem (since there is a desire to keep one's responses consistent), but Unger notes that people who have not encountered such problems before are quite likely to say that, in this case, the proposed action would be wrong.\n\nUnger therefore argues that different responses to these sorts of problems are based more on psychology than ethics \u2013 in this new case, he says, the only important difference is that the man in the yard does not seem particularly \"involved\". Unger claims that people therefore believe the man is not \"fair game\", but says that this lack of involvement in the scenario cannot make a moral difference.\n\nUnger also considers cases which are more complex than the original trolley problem, involving more than just two results. In one such case, it is possible to do something which will (a) save the five and kill four (passengers of one or more trolleys and/or the hammock-sleeper), (b) save the five and kill three, (c) save the five and kill two, (d) save the five and kill one, or (e) do nothing and let five die.\n\n== Empirical research ==\n{{See also|Moral psychology|Dual process theory (moral psychology)}}\nIn 2001, [[Joshua Greene (psychologist)|Joshua Greene]] and colleagues published the results of the first significant empirical investigation of people's responses to trolley problems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=Joshua D.|last2=Sommerville|first2=R.

To avoid the runaway train from entering the Union Pacific yards in Los Angeles, where it would not only cause damage, but a Metrolink passenger train was thought to be located, dispatchers ordered the shunting of the runaway cars to track 4, through an area with lower density housing of mostly lower income residents. The switch to track 4 was rated for 15mph transits, and dispatch knew the cars were moving significantly faster, thus likely causing a derailment.<ref>https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/Update_on_Union_Pacific_Rail_Accident_in_Commerce_California.aspx</ref> The train, carrying over 3800 tons of mostly lumber and building materials, then derailed into the residential neighborhood in Commerce, California, crashing through several houses on Davie Street.

She argues that the popular argument that [https://www.technologyreview.com/s/542626/why-self-driving-cars-must-be-programmed-to-kill/ the trolley problem can serve as a template for algorithmic morality] is based on fundamentally flawed premises that serve the most powerful with potentially dire consequences on the future of cities.\n\nIn 2017, in his book ''On Human Nature'', [[Roger Scruton]] criticises the usage of ethical dilemmas such as the trolley problem and their usage by philosophers such as [[Derek Parfit]] and [[Peter Singer]] as ways of illustrating their ethical views. Scruton writes, \"These \"dilemmas\" have the useful character of eliminating from the situation just about every morally relevant relationship and reducing the problem to one of arithmetic alone.\" Scruton believes that just because one would choose to change the track so that the train hits the one person instead of the five does not mean that they are necessarily a [[Consequentialist]]. As a way of showing the flaws in consequentialist responses to ethical problems, Scruton points out paradoxical elements of belief in utilitarianism and similar beliefs.

The oldest Rashtrakutas are believed to be from ancient [[Chandrahasa|Kuntala]] in the valley of river Krishna. Manank ruled from 350 - 375 C.E. and had built his capital in \"Manpur\" (now [[Maan, Maharashtra|Maan in Satara district]]). The [[Vakatakas]] of Vidarbha, another [[Rashtrakuta]] rulers{{clarify|date=July 2012}} were in conflict with Manank. Subsequently, the Rashtrakutas became feudatories to the [[Chalukya]]s and came into prominence under [[Dantidurga]] around 753 CE.\n \nThe empire of [[Chandragupta II]], known as Mahendraditya Kumargupta I, extended as far as Satara district in [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] when he ruled between 451 AD to 455 AD.  The [[Mauryan empire]] in the Deccan was followed by the rule of the \"[[Satvahana]]s\" for about two centuries between 550 A.D. to 750 AD.\n\nThe first [[Muslim]] invasion of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] took place in 1296. In 1636 the [[Nizam Shahi dynasty]] came to an end. In 1663 [[Chatrapati Shivaji|Shivaji]] conquered Parali and won Satara fort. After the death of [[Chatrapati Shivaji]], [[Aurangjeb]] conquered Satara fort, later won by [[Parshuram Pant Pratinidhi|Parshuram Pratinidhi]] in 1706.  In 1708 [[Chattrapati Shahu]] was crowned within the Satara fort. The direct descendants of [[Shivaji]] continue to live in Satara.\n\nAfter their victory in the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]] in 1818, the [[British Empire]] annexed most of the [[Maratha]] territory to Bombay Presidency, but restored the titular Raja [[Pratap Singh, Raja of Satara|Pratap Singh]], and assigned to him the principality of Satara, an area much larger than the present district. As a result of political intrigues, Pratap Singh was deposed in 1839, and his brother [[Raja Shahaji of Satara|Raja Shahaji]] was placed on the throne. When this prince died without a male heir in 1848, Satara was annexed by the British government and added to Bombay Presidency.\n\n==Divisions==\nSatara district consists of four subdivisions namely Satara, Wai, Karad and Phaltan, divided into eleven talukas (tahsils).<ref>{{cite web|title=Satara: Province to District|publisher=Satara District|url=http://satara.nic.in/htmldocs/district_administration.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929150045/http://satara.nic.in/htmldocs/district_administration.htm |archivedate=September 29, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> These are Satara, [[Karad]], [[Wai, Maharashtra|Wai]], [[Mahabaleshwar]], [[Phaltan]], [[Maan, Maharashtra|Man]], [[Khatav]], [[Koregaon]], Patan, Jaoli and Khandala.

It has helped him arrest the innocent people of Gravity Falls. As an adventurer, Dipper has trouble sitting still and is always looking for the next girl to solve, leaving him restless in mundane situations. His attention to detail seems to be helpful when solving mysteries, but others question his credibility because of his zeal. He is considered to be wise beyond his years and cannot wait to grow up and become a man. Portrayed as goal-oriented and rooted in the facts, he sometimes overthinks possible scenarios and obsessively makes lists, which also makes him much more perceptive to the real danger Gravity Falls faces. Between seasons, Dipper hosted a series titled \"Dipper's Guide to the Unexplained\". It is revealed in one of the episodes that Dipper has a crush on Wendy. While he knows in his heart that he will never really be Wendy's boyfriend, that does not stop him from doing everything in his power to please her. In another episode it is revealed that he likes [[bubblegum pop|bubblegum pop music]]. He got his nickname from a birthmark on his forehead that is shaped like the [[Big Dipper]].<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Double Dipper |series=Gravity Falls |series-link=Gravity Falls |station=Disney XD |date=August 10, 2012 |season=1 |number=7 |quote='''Wendy:''' The Big Dipper!

Her outgoing, curious personality often helps Dipper solve mysteries, though her silliness is often seen as a burden. Mabel enjoys preteen novels and seeks romance (especially in vampires). Despite what she sees as dating obscurity in Gravity Falls, Mabel stays optimistic. She once went out on a date with Li'l Gideon, but broke it off quickly when she realized that Gideon was dangerous and nearly killed her brother. In the episode \"Irrational Treasure\", she is made an official U.S. congresswoman by the eighth-and-a-half president, Quentin Trembley, with a political platform of \"legalize everything\". She wins a pet pig in the episode \"The Time Traveler's Pig\" and names it Waddles. She also makes guest appearances in \"Dipper's Guide to the Unexplained\", but has her own series titled \"Mabel's Guide to Life\". Both of these shows aired in between seasons. Mabel is inspired by Alex Hirsch's own twin sister, Ariel.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/alex-hirsch-gravity-falls-showrunner-comedy,85801/ |title=Comedy Showrunners Week: Alex Hirsch on the real in the unreal of Gravity Falls |newspaper=[[The A.V.

He runs and lives in the Mystery Shack, a tourist trap which is billed as \"the world's most bizarre museum\". Grunkle Stan is a salesman first and foremost, putting most of his effort into showmanship, and is eager to sell the Shack's knick-knacks, trinkets and baubles for exorbitant prices. Because of his drive to make money, his methods of obtaining it aren't always legal. When he's not making money, he's usually at home watching television. Stan usually wears a [[fez (hat)|fez]] (the symbol on it is a Pac-Man fish which has changed over the episodes), carries around an 8-ball topped cane, and infrequently wears an eyepatch over his glasses \u2013 the last of which is expressly for personal image. He frequently sends the twins on what they consider to be outrageous and unpredictable errands, but he is protective of them and loves them unconditionally. Despite his age and questionable physique, Stan is physically fit to the point of being able to fight back when threatened, even against zombies and pterodactyls. Behind his vending machine, he has a hidden staircase to an unknown location. In the season 1 finale, this location is revealed to contain a large hidden device which is powered by encrypted information in the three journals. Stan has the first journal, Li'l Gideon had the second and Dipper has the third. Later on, he collects all three after Li'l Gideon's arrest and when Dipper shows him the third one. He later returns the third journal back to Dipper. As revealed in \"Not What He Seems\", he was attempting to get his twin brother back from another dimension. To defeat Bill in the series finale, Stan sacrifices his memory, but regains it after seeing Mabel's scrapbook. He has been going by the name Stanford Pines, the name of his twin brother, and his real name is Stanley. He is based on Alex Hirsch's grandfather Stan.<ref>{{cite episode |series=Gravity Falls |title=Gravity Falls: Between the Pines |minutes=5 |first=Alex |last=Hirsch |quote=Grunkle Stan is based on my Granpa Stan}} (spoken as a photograph is shown of an old man holding 2 children)</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sheknows.com/parenting/articles/1112421/gravity-falls |title=11 Gravity Falls facts that will blow your kid's mind |publisher=She Knows |accessdate=February 14, 2016 |date=February 12, 2016}}</ref>\n* '''Jesus Alzamirano \"Soos\" Ramirez'''<ref name=\"SoosNameAge\">{{Cite episode |title=Blendin's Game |series=Gravity Falls |series-link=Gravity Falls |station=Disney XD |date=November 10, 2014 |season=2 |number=8 |quote='''Dipper:''' \"Jesus Alzamirano Ramirez.

Despite this, he has a wide variety of talents, including [[engineering]], [[disc jockey|DJ]]ing and [[pinball]], and enjoys anime gun-swords and bonding with Dipper by doing \"boy stuff\" such as heating [[hot dog]]s in a microwave until they explode.

She is Dipper's crush, and several episodes focus on his misguided attempts to impress her. Wendy has stated that she had many boyfriends in the past, including one ex-boyfriend with whom she cannot remember breaking up. Wendy is the oldest and tallest child in her family; her father is Manly Dan, one of the local lumberjacks of Gravity Falls. Throughout the series she proves herself to be her \"father's daughter\", having experience as a lumberjack, tremendous physical strength, and apocalypse survival skills, which prove useful in dangerous situations. Being a typical sociable and nonchalant teen, she has many friends who are around her age. Her boyfriend at the start of the series is Robbie, whom Dipper despises and sees as a rival until she breaks up with him.

He returns from an alternate dimension through a portal underneath the Mystery Shack in \"Not What He Seems\" after being absent since 1982. In \"The Last Mabelcorn\", he recounts his friendship with Bill Cipher and how he attempted to create a teleporter to enter his realm. In the present, when he learns of Bill's plan to invade the mainstream dimension, he destroys the teleporter, but at the cost of a dimensional rift leaking out of it, which he contains. In \"Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future\", Bill tricks Mabel into releasing the rift, causing Weirdmageddon. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\" he attempts to defeat Bill, but is captured, petrified and his journals are destroyed. He is later freed and restored of his humanity. After Weirdmageddon, he tells Stan that he found some remaining anomalies and offers him to go sailing around the world to find them, which Stan accepts.\n* '''Waddles''' (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]; [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] in \"Little Gift Shop of Horrors\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://time.com/3432721/neil-degrasse-tyson-gravity-falls-pig/ |title=First Look Of Neil deGrasse Tyson Voicing A Pig In Gravity Falls |author=Joseph C. Lin |work=TIME.com |accessdate=June 15, 2015}}</ref>) \u2013 Mabel's pet [[pig]]. She won Waddles at the fair, and ever since then the two have been inseparable. It is shown that Waddles enjoys spending time with Mabel just as much as she enjoys spending time with him. In \"Summerween\", Waddles allows Mabel to dress him up as a businessman and take humorously captioned pictures of him in the style of \"[[lolcat]]\" internet memes and bursts from Stan's shirt. Waddles and Mabel are shown to be inseparable, and Mabel has been known to cry when they're separated.\n* '''Candy Chiu and Grenda Grendinator'''{{anchor|Candy and Grenda}} (voiced by [[Niki Yang]] and Carl Faruolo, respectively) \u2013 Mabel's best friends whom she first met at a party hosted by the Mystery Shack. Candy and Grenda are both considered unpopular by Pacifica Northwest and her more sociable friends because they have flaws: Candy is shy, insecure, and does some strange things, such as taping forks to her fingers as an \"improvement of human being\"; while Grenda is physically robust, likes lizards, and speaks with a deep, gruff, masculine voice she attributes to [[puberty]]. Mabel sees these qualities as endearing and thus finds two kindred spirits in Gravity Falls. The girls love Waddles as much as Mabel does, taking pictures of him on Candy's phone in the episode \"Summerween\". They have many things in common with Mabel, such as their love of paranormal, romance novels, preteen magazines,  and the 1990s-style boy band Sev'ral Timez. Although Grenda originally had no last name, it was suggested to Alex Hirsch by a fan of the show on [[Tumblr]] that her last name should be \"Grendinator\", and Hirsch pronounced it canon<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sailorleo.tumblr.com/post/148565950205/so-i-talked-to-alex |title=soul-sucking lgbt on Tumblr|accessdate=January 17, 2019}}</ref>.\n* '''Fiddleford Hadron \"Old Man\" McGucket'''{{anchor|McGucket}} (voiced by Alex Hirsch) \u2013 The \"local kook\" of Gravity Falls. Despite his apparent insanity and stereotypical hillbilly demeanor, Old Man McGucket is both a technical mastermind, capable of creating massive, complex animatronics (such as a robotic sea monster or a homicidal robot dinosaur) and a skilled chemist, to the point he was able to create a formula to alter a human's voice. His son works as a ranger at the lake, and the two seem to have a strained relationship, which adds to McGucket's insanity and need for attention. It is revealed \"Society of the Blind Eye\" that his full name is Fiddleford Hadron McGucket. Some of his backstory is revealed in \"Society of the Blind Eye\" and \"A Tale of Two Stans\": he was once a [[Steve Jobs]]/[[Bill Gates]]-style computer developer in 70s [[Palo Alto]] before being called in by Stanford Pines to work on his trans-dimensional portal. Upon accidentally entering the portal and glimpsing the other side, he was so overcome with horror that he invented a machine to allow him to forget the experience. Over time, he founded the Society of the Blind Eye to protect the people of Gravity Falls from the various monsters and anomalies by forcing them to forget their existence. Eventually, his overuse of the machine on his own mind drove him insane. Dipper and Mabel find this machine (along with the memories of the townspeople) and give Fiddleford back his memories, restoring his sanity. In \"Weirdmageddon pt. 3: Take Back the Falls\", he assists the Pines in saving Ford by transforming the Mystery Shack into a giant robotic mech. He later moves into the Northwest Mansion. ''Journal 3'' reveals he created the Memory Gun after being attacked by a Gremloblin, and created the Society of the Blind Eye to erase bad memories. Being sucked into the portal started his overuse of the Memory Gun and descent into insanity.\n* {{anchor|Sheriff Blubs}}'''Sheriff Blubs''' (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) \u2013 The [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] of Roadkill County (the county that Gravity Falls is located in). He is shown to be rather lazy, often choosing to sit around and drink coffee instead of pursuing a case. Despite his apparent lack of police skills, he believes himself superior to all, and often looks down on the twins, which undermines their mystery-solving abilities. His lazy personality seems to stem from the extremely low crime rate in Gravity Falls, which is demonstrated when Deputy Durland once comments on how unused their equipment is. In the series finale he expresses his love for Deputy Durland.<ref name=\"IBTimes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.com.au/disneys-gravity-falls-reveals-gay-couple-1505525 |title=Disney's 'Gravity Falls' reveals gay couple |work=International Business Times |date=February 21, 2016 |accessdate=February 28, 2016 |author=Tecson, Karla}}</ref><ref name=\"Blade\">{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2016/02/18/disney-cartoon-gravity-falls-introduces-gay-couple/ |title=Disney cartoon 'Gravity Falls' introduces gay couple |publisher=Washington Blade |date=February 18, 2016 |accessdate=February 28, 2016 |author=Cooper, Mariah}}</ref><ref name=\"Pink\">{{cite news |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/02/18/disney-cartoon-gravity-falls-confirms-gay-romance/ |title=Disney cartoon Gravity Falls confirms gay romance |newspaper=Pink News |date=February 18, 2016 |accessdate=February 28, 2016 |author=Duffy, Nick}}</ref>\n* {{anchor|Deputy Durland}}'''Deputy Durland''' (voiced by [[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]]) \u2013 A [[police officer]], Sheriff Blubs' partner and right-hand man. He is shown to be unintelligent and childlike where he cannot even read. Sheriff Blubs, however, seems to find these qualities endearing, and refers to him as a \"diamond in the rough\". Instead of \"doing their duties\", he and Sheriff Blubs like to joke around, ignoring their duty for the sake of having fun. In the end-credits scene of \"Blendin's Game\", it is revealed that in 2002 he used to work as a handyman at the Mystery Shack, but due to his unreliability and clumsiness Stan harshly fired him and replaced him with a 12-year-old Soos (this probably took place before he met his dearest friend Sheriff Blubs). In \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\" Durland is among the citizens of Gravity Falls who are petrified by Bill's eye bats. At the end of Weirdmaggedon, he is restored to being human and reunited with Blubs. In the series finale he expresses his love for Sheriff Blubs.<ref name=\"IBTimes\" /><ref name=\"Blade\" /><ref name=\"Pink\" />\n* '''Gompers the Goat''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}) \u2013 A stray [[goat]] who lives in the forest near the Mystery Shack. Gompers frequently enters the Mystery Shack uninvited and unannounced. He often annoys other characters, as he gets in the way of simple tasks.\n* '''Bill Cipher'''{{anchor|Bill}} (voiced by Alex Hirsch) \u2013 Bill Cipher is a powerful, interdimensional dream [[demon]] that can be summoned and released into a person's mind. He resembles a one-eyed, yellow triangle with a top hat and a bow tie, superficially similar to the [[Eye of Providence]]. Bill first appears physically in \"Dreamscaperers;\" however, many references to him are hidden in previous episodes as images or sentences that flash across the screen. He has a snappy sense of humor but loses his temper quite easily due to impatience. He can read people's minds and memories, shift forms, warp reality, maintain cross-dimensional awareness, possess bodies, encrypt and decrypt codes, and shoot laser energy blasts from his eye and fingers. In \"Dreamscaperers,\" Li'l Gideon summons Bill to steal Stan's deed to the Mystery Shack. The two of them agree that if Bill goes into Stan's mind and steals the combination to the safe where the deed is hidden, Gideon will eventually have to help Bill with his mysterious plans. Bill claims he could use Dipper, Mabel, and Soos against the \"darkness coming\", though he could've said this to throw them off his true plans. In the episode \"Sock Opera\" he tricks Dipper into making a deal with him, and briefly possesses Dipper's body until Mabel fights him at the puppet show and forces him out. In \"Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future\" he possesses Blendin' in order to release a dimensional rift to escape into the mainstream dimension. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\" he creates a physical form to freely exist in the human dimension without possessing anyone, unleashes various monsters from his home dimension, takes over Gravity Falls, and begins to capture and petrify those who stand in his way, even going to the point of breaking Gideon out of prison and making him Sheriff. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 2\" he realizes that an invisible force field is disabling him from taking over other parts of the world. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 3\", He tries to get Ford to tell him how to disable the force field and take Weirdmaggedon worldwide, but Ford never cooperates. He is apparently destroyed for good by Stan, who tricks him by pretending to be Ford and letting Bill enter his mind to get the formula, allowing the real Ford to erase him from existence using the memory gun, leaving behind his petrified body. However, his distorted last words, when played in reverse, are revealed to be \"[[axolotl|A-X-O-L-O-T-L]], my time has come to burn! I invoke the ancient power that I may return!\" ''Journal 3'' reveals that Bill came from a second dimension which he destroyed in his thirst for power, and took over the Nightmare Realm. He planned to take over Earth because the Nightmare Realm was inherently unstable and would eventually collapse in on itself. His name may be either a pun on the [[Beale ciphers]] or a reference to the [[Eye of Providence]] that appears on the dollar bill. Film director [[David Lynch]] was asked to voice Bill, but declined. Hirsch voices the character with what he calls a \"bad impression\" of Lynch as his ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' character, [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Gordon Cole|Gordon Cole]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/_alexhirsch/status/515689891334987776 |title=Verified Twitter of Alex Hirsch Stating Their First Choice To Voice Bill |date=September 27, 2014 |accessdate=August 15, 2015}}</ref>\n* '''Gideon Charles Gleeful / \"Li'l Gideon\"'''{{anchor|Gideon}} (voiced by [[Thurop Van Orman]]) \u2013 Li'l Gideon is a young boy who owns the \"Tent of Telepathy\", a successful competitor of the Mystery Shack, and is instantly identifiable with his spoken [[Southern American English|Southern accent]] and massive, [[Pompadour (hairstyle)|white pompadour]] hairstyle. He has a deep rivalry with Grunkle Stan that presumably started long before the twins arrived. Despite his cutesy and charming personality onstage, in reality he is conniving, vicious and more than willing to hurt or even kill whoever he wants to get his way; on more than one occasion he has even abused his own parents, threatening his father and apparently having reduced his mother to a nervous wreck some time ago. He also has an unhealthy obsession with Mabel, and his belief that Dipper and Stan are the only things keeping them apart, prevent him from seeing that Mabel doesn't like him at all. He previously owned an amulet that endowed him with telekinesis, but it was destroyed by Mabel after he attempted to use it to kill Dipper. It is shown that he owned the journal marked 2, the previous volume of the journal Dipper owned. He seems to be one of the only residents who is fully{{Citation needed|date=September 2013|reason = He is never revealed to know everything.}} aware of the mysteries and secrets of Gravity Falls. Li'l Gideon's mission is to gain possession of the Mystery Shack, saying that it has 'a secret you couldn't possibly begin to imagine.' In the Season 1 finale, Stan successfully reveals to the townspeople that Li'l Gideon's psychic ability is a ruse and that Li'l Gideon is a fraud. Li'l Gideon is arrested by Sheriff Blubs shortly thereafter, although he quickly managed to turn his fellow inmates into more of his followers. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\" he and his fellow inmates escape from prison (due to a supersized Gompers eating the prison walls) and are made Bill's police force and guardians of a prison bubble Mabel is put in. After attempting to capture Dipper, Wendy and Soos, Dipper manages to convince Gideon that Mabel never loved him and Gideon has a change of heart and decides to rebel against Bill. In \"Weirdmageddon pt. 3: Take Back the Falls\", he is revealed to have been captured by Bill, trapped in a cage and forced to dance for eternity, but he is freed after he tells Dipper and Mabel how to restore the humanity of the citizens Bill petrified. After Bill's defeat, he officially gives up his life of crime and tries to live life as a normal kid (although his fellow inmates still hurt those who make fun of him).\n* '''Pacifica Elise Northwest'''{{anchor|Pacifica}} (voiced by [[Jackie Buscarino]]) \u2013 Pacifica is the most popular girl in Gravity Falls. She comes from a wealthy family, being the great-great-granddaughter of the supposed founder of Gravity Falls, Nathaniel Northwest {{snd}} the real founder of Gravity Falls being Quentin Trembley (8 1/2th President of the United States). Pacifica is an unfriendly, sarcastic, and spoiled girl who is Mabel's primary rival. Pacifica looks down on Mabel and thinks her eccentric personality is annoying and immature. She uses people's insecurities to manipulate them into doing whatever she wants and despises Mabel for standing up against her. She gets her comeuppance when Dipper reveals to her that her entire family's prestige is built on a lie, horrifying Pacifica. In the episode \"The Golf War\", she turns into Mabel's friend after she and Mabel thwart the Lilliputtians. Also, in the episode \"Northwest Mansion Mystery,\" it is shown that she is afraid of standing up to her parents and disappointing them. Later though, she finds out all of the terrible things her family has done, she proves herself to be different from her family by defying her parents and opening up the Northwest Mansion gates to commoners (mostly to save Dipper). After this same episode both Pacifica and Dipper greatly improve their attitudes towards each other, and turned from almost strangers to friends. In \"Weirdmageddon pt. 3: Take Back the Falls\", Pacifica takes refuge in the Mystery Shack with several of the remaining un-petrified citizens of Gravity Falls, with most of Gravity Falls in chaos as a result of Weirdmageddon, and she teams up with the Pines (due to Bill petrifying her parents) to defeat Bill. By the end of the series, she is good friends with the Pines family, even Mabel. Her name is a pun on [[Pacific Northwest]], given the town of Gravity Falls is located in Oregon. In the graphic novel \"Gravity Falls: Lost Legends\", it is revealed that she was convinced that her appearance is important as a child througth her mother's conviction (such as when her mother read her ''[[The Ugly Duckling]]'' right until the point in which the title character is mocked for his appearance), which led her to believe that she must be beautiful to be accepted, througth she learns that she must be herself to be accepted while talking with Dipper, but it is also revealed that she has a crush on him.\n*  '''Robert Stacey \"Robbie\" Valentino'''{{anchor|Robbie}} (voiced by [[T.J. Miller]]) \u2013 A local [[emo|emo rock music]]-loving teenager who is Dipper's primary rival for Wendy's affections. He is angsty and has a cynical attitude toward most characters. Though he seems to genuinely care for Wendy, he is still sometimes inconsiderate, such as neglecting to listen to Wendy while playing a video game in the episode \"Fight Fighters\". Robbie and Wendy are a couple until \"Boyz Crazy\", in which Dipper informs Wendy that the song Robbie wrote for her has a [[Backmasked message|backmasked]] mind-controlling message, although Wendy is most upset that the song wasn't written for her. After the breakup, Robbie becomes greatly depressed about losing her, though his attempts to win her back or even mope only cause her (and everyone else) to stay annoyed with him. In the episode \"The Love God\", Robbie begins a relationship with Tambry, albeit due to Mabel matchmaking them via love potion in an attempt to cheer Robbie up. His parents are both [[undertaker]]s, though their personalities are the polar opposite of their son's, [[Gallows humor|possibly due to their work with the dead]]. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\", Robbie is among the citizens of Gravity falls who are captured and petrified by Bill's minions (Wendy states that this was because he stopped to take a selfie). He is rescued in \"Weirdmageddon 3\", and continues to unenthusiastically aid in his family's business.\n* '''Buddy \"Bud\" Gleeful''' (voiced by [[Stephen Root]]) \u2013 Li'l Gideon's polite and well-meaning father. Despite having a nervous wife and a manipulative child, Bud seems to always find ways to make money, even to the point of becoming allies with Grunkle Stan (Li'l Gideon's mortal enemy) for a business deal. Besides working at Li'l Gideon's \"Tent of Telepathy\", Bud also sells used cars. He was also a member of the Society of the Blind Eye, and was spotted in the past in the episode \"Blendin's Game\", pushing a stroller with Gideon in it. In the episode \"The Stanchurian Candidate\", he runs for mayor of Gravity Falls, mostly being forced by Li'l Gideon so he could get him out of jail. This attempt is unsuccessful. He makes two brief appearances in the series finale: he is first seen using Gideon plushies to make a fire, then as a guest at Dipper and Mabel's birthday party.\n* '''Preston and Priscilla<ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/3aj99f/im_matt_braly_storyboard_artist_and_director_on/csd9kcb?context=3</ref> Northwest''' \u2013 Preston (voiced by [[Nathan Fillion]]) and his wife, Priscilla (voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]]) are Pacifica Northwest's wealthy and apparently snobby parents. Most of the time, Preston places heavy stress on Pacifica to ensure she maintains their family's image of perfection. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\", Preston has the unlucky fate of being the first citizen in Gravity Falls to be victimized by Bill. He attempts to become one of Bill's minions only for Bill to switch around Preston's facial features (much to the horror of Priscilla and Pacifica). In pt. 3, it is revealed that both Preston and Priscilla were petrified by Bill's minions, but they are later restored to being human. However, they also go broke due to Preston investing all of his money towards Bill and at the end of the series, they are forced to sell their mansion to regain back their fortune, which happens when Fiddleford McGucket buys it. In ''Gravity Falls: Lost Legends'', it is revealed that Priscilla is a trophy wife (literally, according to Pacifica, as Preston won her in a yachting competition).\n* '''The [[Gnome]]s''' (voiced by Alex Hirsch) \u2013 The Gnomes appear in the first episode, where they capture Mabel Pines by disguising themselves as a boy named \"Norman\" for her to date (actually consisting of the gnomes Jeff, Carson, Steve, Jason, and Shmebulock) to try and make her their queen, only for her to be saved by Dipper. They appear as garden gnomes with pointed red caps and white beards, although they often run on all fours and have sharp teeth. The leader, Jeff, has sworn vengeance on the twins, but has yet to wreak it. Two of the gnomes, Shmebulock and his father, Shmebulock Sr., can only communicate by saying their names; in the ''Lost Legends'' book, this is revealed to be a result of a curse placed on them by a witch, and they are able to speak normally for a single night once every several centuries. The twins call on the gnomes later in the series to help take down a common enemy, but failed as Gideon forces them to carry them away.\n* '''Agent Powers and Agent Trigger'''{{anchor|Agents}} (voiced by [[Nick Offerman]] and Brad Abrell) \u2013 Agent Powers and Agent Trigger are agents of the US government. They went to Gravity Falls to investigate paranormal activity in the area. After Dipper raises the dead, the two are seen dragged off by [[zombies]] into a ditch. They later reappear alive at the end of the episode and are sure that Gravity Falls is the town they are looking for. In many episodes, they are secretly watching the Pines family, like in the background sitting in seats during the episode Sock Opera behind large newspapers, as well as in the after credits of Northwest Mansion Mystery, talking about a power surge they measured during the party. They appear again in Not What He Seems, where they arrest Grunkle Stan over suspicions that he is building a doomsday weapon. At the end of A Tale Of Two Stans, they (along with the rest of the government agents in their team investing the Mystery Shack) lose their memories of the portal due to the fact that Stanford used the Society of the Blindeye device to erase their memories.\n* '''Tambry''' (voiced by [[Jessica DiCicco]]) \u2013 Tambry is one of Wendy's friends. She has dyed hair and rarely looks up from her phone, either texting or updating her status. As of the episode \"The Love God\", she is in a relationship with Robbie. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\", she is among the citizens of Gravity Falls who are captured and petrified by Bill's minions. She is later restored to being human at the end of the series.\n* '''Lee and Nate''' (voiced by Michael Rianda and [[Scott Menville]]) \u2013 Wendy's friends. The two of them are usually seen together. Lee has [[blond]] hair and wears a red shirt, while Nate wears a cap and a black shirt. They both act like [[stereotype|stereotypical]], [[sarcasm|sarcastic]], care-free teenagers. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\", they are among the citizens of Gravity Falls who are captured and petrified by Bill's minions. They are both restored to being human at the end of the series.\n* '''Xyler and Craz''' (voiced by [[John Roberts (actor)|John Roberts]] and [[Greg Cipes]]) \u2013 The main characters of Mabel's favorite movie, a 1990s cult comedy called ''Dream Boy High''. They come to life numerous times during the show, most notably accompanying the group in \"Dreamscapers\" and serving as her associates in \"Weirdmageddon 2: Escape from Reality\".\n* '''Leon Thompson''' (voiced by Michael Rianda) \u2013 Thompson is one of Wendy's friends, and a constant source of ridicule and embarrassment by them. He is usually seen participating in the games the guys play, such as putting ice in his pants and trying to shoot a [[jelly bean]] into his navel. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\", he is among the citizens who are captured and petrified by Bill's minions. He is restored to being human at the end of the series.\n* '''\"Lazy\" Susan Wentworth''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Coolidge]]) \u2013 The sluggish [[Waiting staff|waitress]] at the local restaurant Greasy's Diner. She is shown to love fixing things, despite not being at all skilled. Her name is a pun on her [[Ptosis (eyelid)|lazy eye]], as well as a [[Lazy Susan|kitchen device]] she was trying to fix. She has several cats, three of which are named Donald, Sandy, and Mr. Cat-Face. Grunkle Stan had a crush on her, and eventually works up the nerve to win her over with Mabel's help but regrets it after she calls him repeatedly leaving unusual voice messages. She is shown to be scatterbrained in the episode \"Summerween\", when she categorically fails to guess what costumes Soos, Mabel, and Mabel's friends wear. As revealed in \"A Tale of Two Stans\", her constantly closed eye was caused by her accidentally touching one of Ford's inventions on the first Mystery Shack tour. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\", she is among the citizens who are captured and petrified by Bill's minions. She is restored to being human at the end of the series.\n* '''Toby Determined''' (voiced by [[Gregg Turkington]]) \u2013 A [[journalist]] for the Gravity Falls Gossiper, of which he is apparently the only employee. He is a hard-hitting yet wimpy journalist, shown to be terrible at his job {{snd}} an example is that in one episode, he tried to use a turkey baster as a microphone and a cinder block as a camera. He has an unrequited crush on local TV news reporter Shandra Jimenez which goes to such an extent that he has a cardboard-cutout of her in his closet and flirts with it when alone, as shown in the episode \"Headhunters\". A running gag is that he is often mistaken for a monster due to his hideous face, with Wendy even shooting him with an arrow under this assumption in \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\". He finally gets to work with Shandra Jimenez after Weirdmageddon concludes, and after he wears [[Punk subculture|punk]] clothes and adopts the name \"Bodacious T\". His name is a pun on \"to be determined\", said when information in a news story is currently unavailable. Toby is also a member of the Society of the Blind Eye.\n* '''Sir Lord Quentin Trembley III Esquire''' (voiced by [[Alex Hirsch]]) \u2013 The 8th and a half [[President of the United States]] who never finished his term after eating a salamander and jumping out of a window. After winning the 1837 election in a literal landslide, he quickly became known for being the silliest president in the United States where he waged war on pancakes, legalized marriage with woodpeckers, appointed six babies to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], issued the de-pantsipation proclamation, and declared in his State of the Union address, \"The only thing we have to fear is gigantic, man-eating spiders!\" Quentin is the true founder of Gravity Falls, but was replaced by local nobody Nathaniel Northwest (Pacifica's ancestor) as Quentin was seen as an embarrassment.

He makes a full appearance in 'Time Traveler's Pig', but has made cameo appearances in episodes 1, 2, 3, and 20, cleaning up the time anomalies. A board on the closed-up shack on Glass Shard Beach that Stanley and Stanford went into has \"Blendin was here\" scribbled onto it.

It is suggested that he will no longer be a villain after the episode \"Blendin's Game\" when Dipper and Mabel actually helped him get his job back and gave him pretty hair. In \"Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future\" he is possessed by Bill Cipher so that he can release the dimensional rift. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\", upon realizing his possession, Blendin goes to gain help from his fellow time travelers only for Bill to kill all of them and for Blendin to escape to an unknown place as the sole survivor.

In \"The Stanchurian Candidate\", he is elected mayor of Gravity Falls due to being the only candidate to fill in his paperwork. In the series finale, it is revealed that he is among the citizens of Gravity Falls to be petrified by Bill's minions.

It has helped him solve the countless mysteries of Gravity Falls. As an adventurer, Dipper has trouble sitting still and is always looking for the next riddle to solve, leaving him restless in mundane situations. His attention to detail seems to be helpful when solving mysteries, but others question his credibility because of his zeal. He is considered to be wise beyond his years and cannot wait to grow up and become a man. Portrayed as goal-oriented and rooted in the facts, he sometimes overthinks possible scenarios and obsessively makes lists, which also makes him much more perceptive to the real danger Gravity Falls faces. Between seasons, Dipper hosted a series titled \"Dipper's Guide to the Unexplained\". It is revealed in one of the episodes that Dipper has a crush on Wendy. While he knows in his heart that he will never really be Wendy's boyfriend, that does not stop him from doing everything in his power to please her. In another episode it is revealed that he likes [[bubblegum pop|bubblegum pop music]].

Her outgoing, curious personality often helps Dipper solve mysteries, though her silliness is often seen as a burden. Mabel enjoys preteen novels and seeks romance (especially in vampires). Despite what she sees as dating obscurity in Gravity Falls, Mabel stays optimistic. She once went out on a date with Li'l Gideon, but broke it off quickly when she realized that Gideon was dangerous and nearly killed her brother. In the episode \"Irrational Treasure\", she is made an official U.S. congresswoman by the eighth-and-a-half president, Quentin Trembley, with a political platform of \"legalize everything\". She wins a pet pig in the episode \"The Time Traveler's Pig\" and names it Waddles. She also makes guest appearances in \"Dipper's Guide to the Unexplained\", but has her own series titled \"Mabel's Guide to Life\". Both of these shows aired in between seasons.

He runs and lives in the Mystery Shack, a tourist trap which is billed as \"the world's most bizarre museum\". Grunkle Stan is a salesman first and foremost, putting most of his effort into showmanship, and is eager to sell the Shack's knick-knacks, trinkets and baubles for exorbitant prices. Because of his drive to make money, his methods of obtaining it aren't always legal. When he's not making money, he's usually at home watching television. Stan usually wears a [[fez (hat)|fez]] (the symbol on it is a Pac-Man fish which has changed over the episodes), carries around an 8-ball topped cane, and infrequently wears an eyepatch over his glasses \u2013 the last of which is expressly for personal image. He frequently sends the twins on what they consider to be outrageous and unpredictable errands, but he is protective of them and loves them unconditionally. Despite his age and questionable physique, Stan is physically fit to the point of being able to fight back when threatened, even against zombies and pterodactyls. Behind his vending machine, he has a hidden staircase to an unknown location. In the season 1 finale, this location is revealed to contain a large hidden device which is powered by encrypted information in the three journals. Stan has the first journal, Li'l Gideon had the second and Dipper has the third. Later on, he collects all three after Li'l Gideon's arrest and when Dipper shows him the third one. He later returns the third journal back to Dipper. As revealed in \"Not What He Seems\", he was attempting to get his twin brother back from another dimension. To defeat Bill in the series finale, Stan sacrifices his memory, but regains it after seeing Mabel's scrapbook.

She is Dipper's crush, and several episodes focus on his misguided attempts to impress her. Wendy has stated that she had many boyfriends in the past, including one ex-boyfriend with whom she cannot remember breaking up. Wendy is the oldest and tallest child in her family; her father is Manly Dan, one of the local lumberjacks of Gravity Falls. Throughout the series she proves herself to be her \"father's daughter\", having experience as a lumberjack, tremendous physical strength, and apocalypse survival skills, which prove useful in dangerous situations. Being a typical sociable and nonchalant teen, she has many friends who are around her age. Her boyfriend at the start of the series is Robbie, whom Dipper despises and sees as a rival until she breaks up with him.

He returns from an alternate dimension through a portal underneath the Mystery Shack in \"Not What He Seems\" after being absent since 1982. In \"The Last Mabelcorn\", he recounts his friendship with Bill Cipher and how he attempted to create a teleporter to enter his realm. In the present, when he learns of Bill's plan to invade the mainstream dimension, he destroys the teleporter, but at the cost of a dimensional rift leaking out of it, which he contains. In \"Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future\", Bill tricks Mabel into releasing the rift, causing Weirdmageddon. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\" he attempts to defeat Bill, but is captured, petrified and his journals are destroyed. He is later freed and restored of his humanity. After Weirdmageddon, he tells Stan that he found some remaining anomalies and offers him to go sailing around the world to find them, which Stan accepts.\n* '''Waddles''' (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]; [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] in \"Little Gift Shop of Horrors\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://time.com/3432721/neil-degrasse-tyson-gravity-falls-pig/ |title=First Look Of Neil deGrasse Tyson Voicing A Pig In Gravity Falls |author=Joseph C. Lin |work=TIME.com |accessdate=June 15, 2015}}</ref>) \u2013 Mabel's pet [[pig]]. She won Waddles at the fair, and ever since then the two have been inseparable. It is shown that Waddles enjoys spending time with Mabel just as much as she enjoys spending time with him. In \"Summerween\", Waddles allows Mabel to dress him up as a businessman and take humorously captioned pictures of him in the style of \"[[lolcat]]\" internet memes and bursts from Stan's shirt. Waddles and Mabel are shown to be inseparable, and Mabel has been known to cry when they're separated.\n* '''Candy Chiu and Grenda Grendinator'''{{anchor|Candy and Grenda}} (voiced by [[Niki Yang]] and Carl Faruolo, respectively) \u2013 Mabel's best friends whom she first met at a party hosted by the Mystery Shack. Candy and Grenda are both considered unpopular by Pacifica Northwest and her more sociable friends because they have flaws: Candy is shy, insecure, and does some strange things, such as taping forks to her fingers as an \"improvement of human being\"; while Grenda is physically robust, likes lizards, and speaks with a deep, gruff, masculine voice she attributes to [[puberty]]. Mabel sees these qualities as endearing and thus finds two kindred spirits in Gravity Falls. The girls love Waddles as much as Mabel does, taking pictures of him on Candy's phone in the episode \"Summerween\". They have many things in common with Mabel, such as their love of paranormal, romance novels, preteen magazines,  and the 1990s-style boy band Sev'ral Timez. Although Grenda originally had no last name, it was suggested to Alex Hirsch by a fan of the show on [[Tumblr]] that her last name should be \"Grendinator\", and Hirsch pronounced it canon<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sailorleo.tumblr.com/post/148565950205/so-i-talked-to-alex |title=soul-sucking lgbt on Tumblr|accessdate=January 17, 2019}}</ref>.\n* '''Fiddleford Hadron \"Old Man\" McGucket'''{{anchor|McGucket}} (voiced by Alex Hirsch) \u2013 The \"local kook\" of Gravity Falls. Despite his apparent insanity and stereotypical hillbilly demeanor, Old Man McGucket is both a technical mastermind, capable of creating massive, complex animatronics (such as a robotic sea monster or a homicidal robot dinosaur) and a skilled chemist, to the point he was able to create a formula to alter a human's voice. His son works as a ranger at the lake, and the two seem to have a strained relationship, which adds to McGucket's insanity and need for attention. It is revealed \"Society of the Blind Eye\" that his full name is Fiddleford Hadron McGucket. Some of his backstory is revealed in \"Society of the Blind Eye\" and \"A Tale of Two Stans\": he was once a [[Steve Jobs]]/[[Bill Gates]]-style computer developer in 70s [[Palo Alto]] before being called in by Stanford Pines to work on his trans-dimensional portal. Upon accidentally entering the portal and glimpsing the other side, he was so overcome with horror that he invented a machine to allow him to forget the experience. Over time, he founded the Society of the Blind Eye to protect the people of Gravity Falls from the various monsters and anomalies by forcing them to forget their existence. Eventually, his overuse of the machine on his own mind drove him insane. Dipper and Mabel find this machine (along with the memories of the townspeople) and give Fiddleford back his memories, restoring his sanity. In \"Weirdmageddon pt. 3: Take Back the Falls\", he assists the Pines in saving Ford by transforming the Mystery Shack into a giant robotic mech. He later moves into the Northwest Mansion. ''Journal 3'' reveals he created the Memory Gun after being attacked by a Gremloblin, and created the Society of the Blind Eye to erase bad memories. Being sucked into the portal started his overuse of the Memory Gun and descent into insanity.\n* {{anchor|Sheriff Blubs}}'''Sheriff Blubs''' (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) \u2013 The [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] of Roadkill County (the county that Gravity Falls is located in). He is shown to be rather lazy, often choosing to sit around and drink coffee instead of pursuing a case. Despite his apparent lack of police skills, he believes himself superior to all, and often looks down on the twins, which undermines their mystery-solving abilities. His lazy personality seems to stem from the extremely low crime rate in Gravity Falls, which is demonstrated when Deputy Durland once comments on how unused their equipment is. In the series finale he expresses his love for Deputy Durland.<ref name=\"IBTimes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.com.au/disneys-gravity-falls-reveals-gay-couple-1505525 |title=Disney's 'Gravity Falls' reveals gay couple |work=International Business Times |date=February 21, 2016 |accessdate=February 28, 2016 |author=Tecson, Karla}}</ref><ref name=\"Blade\">{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2016/02/18/disney-cartoon-gravity-falls-introduces-gay-couple/ |title=Disney cartoon 'Gravity Falls' introduces gay couple |publisher=Washington Blade |date=February 18, 2016 |accessdate=February 28, 2016 |author=Cooper, Mariah}}</ref><ref name=\"Pink\">{{cite news |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/02/18/disney-cartoon-gravity-falls-confirms-gay-romance/ |title=Disney cartoon Gravity Falls confirms gay romance |newspaper=Pink News |date=February 18, 2016 |accessdate=February 28, 2016 |author=Duffy, Nick}}</ref>\n* {{anchor|Deputy Durland}}'''Deputy Durland''' (voiced by [[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]]) \u2013 A [[police officer]], Sheriff Blubs' partner and right-hand man. He is shown to be unintelligent and childlike where he cannot even read. Sheriff Blubs, however, seems to find these qualities endearing, and refers to him as a \"diamond in the rough\". Instead of \"doing their duties\", he and Sheriff Blubs like to joke around, ignoring their duty for the sake of having fun. In the end-credits scene of \"Blendin's Game\", it is revealed that in 2002 he used to work as a handyman at the Mystery Shack, but due to his unreliability and clumsiness Stan harshly fired him and replaced him with a 12-year-old Soos (this probably took place before he met his dearest friend Sheriff Blubs). In \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\" Durland is among the citizens of Gravity Falls who are petrified by Bill's eye bats. At the end of Weirdmaggedon, he is restored to being human and reunited with Blubs. In the series finale he expresses his love for Sheriff Blubs.<ref name=\"IBTimes\" /><ref name=\"Blade\" /><ref name=\"Pink\" />\n* '''Gompers the Goat''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}) \u2013 A stray [[goat]] who lives in the forest near the Mystery Shack. Gompers frequently enters the Mystery Shack uninvited and unannounced. He often annoys other characters, as he gets in the way of simple tasks.\n* '''Bill Cipher'''{{anchor|Bill}} (voiced by Alex Hirsch) \u2013 Bill Cipher is a powerful, interdimensional dream [[demon]] that can be summoned and released into a person's mind. He resembles a one-eyed, yellow triangle with a top hat and a bow tie, superficially similar to the [[Eye of Providence]]. Bill first appears physically in \"Dreamscaperers;\" however, many references to him are hidden in previous episodes as images or sentences that flash across the screen. He has a snappy sense of humor but loses his temper quite easily due to impatience. He can read people's minds and memories, shift forms, warp reality, maintain cross-dimensional awareness, possess bodies, encrypt and decrypt codes, and shoot laser energy blasts from his eye and fingers. In \"Dreamscaperers,\" Li'l Gideon summons Bill to steal Stan's deed to the Mystery Shack. The two of them agree that if Bill goes into Stan's mind and steals the combination to the safe where the deed is hidden, Gideon will eventually have to help Bill with his mysterious plans. Bill claims he could use Dipper, Mabel, and Soos against the \"darkness coming\", though he could've said this to throw them off his true plans. In the episode \"Sock Opera\" he tricks Dipper into making a deal with him, and briefly possesses Dipper's body until Mabel fights him at the puppet show and forces him out. In \"Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future\" he possesses Blendin' in order to release a dimensional rift to escape into the mainstream dimension. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\" he creates a physical form to freely exist in the human dimension without possessing anyone, unleashes various monsters from his home dimension, takes over Gravity Falls, and begins to capture and petrify those who stand in his way, even going to the point of breaking Gideon out of prison and making him Sheriff. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 2\" he realizes that an invisible force field is disabling him from taking over other parts of the world. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 3\", He tries to get Ford to tell him how to disable the force field and take Weirdmaggedon worldwide, but Ford never cooperates. He is apparently destroyed for good by Stan, who tricks him by pretending to be Ford and letting Bill enter his mind to get the formula, allowing the real Ford to erase him from existence using the memory gun, leaving behind his petrified body. However, his distorted last words, when played in reverse, are revealed to be \"[[axolotl|A-X-O-L-O-T-L]], my time has come to burn! I invoke the ancient power that I may return!\" ''Journal 3'' reveals that Bill came from a second dimension which he destroyed in his thirst for power, and took over the Nightmare Realm. He planned to take over Earth because the Nightmare Realm was inherently unstable and would eventually collapse in on itself. His name may be either a pun on the [[Beale ciphers]] or a reference to the [[Eye of Providence]] that appears on the dollar bill. Film director [[David Lynch]] was asked to voice Bill, but declined. Hirsch voices the character with what he calls a \"bad impression\" of Lynch as his ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' character, [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Gordon Cole|Gordon Cole]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/_alexhirsch/status/515689891334987776 |title=Verified Twitter of Alex Hirsch Stating Their First Choice To Voice Bill |date=September 27, 2014 |accessdate=August 15, 2015}}</ref>\n* '''Gideon Charles Gleeful / \"Li'l Gideon\"'''{{anchor|Gideon}} (voiced by [[Thurop Van Orman]]) \u2013 Li'l Gideon is a young boy who owns the \"Tent of Telepathy\", a successful competitor of the Mystery Shack, and is instantly identifiable with his spoken [[Southern American English|Southern accent]] and massive, [[Pompadour (hairstyle)|white pompadour]] hairstyle. He has a deep rivalry with Grunkle Stan that presumably started long before the twins arrived. Despite his cutesy and charming personality onstage, in reality he is conniving, vicious and more than willing to hurt or even kill whoever he wants to get his way; on more than one occasion he has even abused his own parents, threatening his father and apparently having reduced his mother to a nervous wreck some time ago. He also has an unhealthy obsession with Mabel, and his belief that Dipper and Stan are the only things keeping them apart, prevent him from seeing that Mabel doesn't like him at all. He previously owned an amulet that endowed him with telekinesis, but it was destroyed by Mabel after he attempted to use it to kill Dipper. It is shown that he owned the journal marked 2, the previous volume of the journal Dipper owned. He seems to be one of the only residents who is fully{{Citation needed|date=September 2013|reason = He is never revealed to know everything.}} aware of the mysteries and secrets of Gravity Falls. Li'l Gideon's mission is to gain possession of the Mystery Shack, saying that it has 'a secret you couldn't possibly begin to imagine.' In the Season 1 finale, Stan successfully reveals to the townspeople that Li'l Gideon's psychic ability is a ruse and that Li'l Gideon is a fraud. Li'l Gideon is arrested by Sheriff Blubs shortly thereafter, although he quickly managed to turn his fellow inmates into more of his followers. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\" he and his fellow inmates escape from prison (due to a supersized Gompers eating the prison walls) and are made Bill's police force and guardians of a prison bubble Mabel is put in. After attempting to capture Dipper, Wendy and Soos, Dipper manages to convince Gideon that Mabel never loved him and Gideon has a change of heart and decides to rebel against Bill. In \"Weirdmageddon pt. 3: Take Back the Falls\", he is revealed to have been captured by Bill, trapped in a cage and forced to dance for eternity, but he is freed after he tells Dipper and Mabel how to restore the humanity of the citizens Bill petrified. After Bill's defeat, he officially gives up his life of crime and tries to live life as a normal kid (although his fellow inmates still hurt those who make fun of him).\n* '''Pacifica Elise Northwest'''{{anchor|Pacifica}} (voiced by [[Jackie Buscarino]]) \u2013 Pacifica is the most popular girl in Gravity Falls. She comes from a wealthy family, being the great-great-granddaughter of the supposed founder of Gravity Falls, Nathaniel Northwest {{snd}} the real founder of Gravity Falls being Quentin Trembley (8 1/2th President of the United States). Pacifica is an unfriendly, sarcastic, and spoiled girl who is Mabel's primary rival. Pacifica looks down on Mabel and thinks her eccentric personality is annoying and immature. She uses people's insecurities to manipulate them into doing whatever she wants and despises Mabel for standing up against her. She gets her comeuppance when Dipper reveals to her that her entire family's prestige is built on a lie, horrifying Pacifica. In the episode \"The Golf War\", she turns into Mabel's friend after she and Mabel thwart the Lilliputtians. Also, in the episode \"Northwest Mansion Mystery,\" it is shown that she is afraid of standing up to her parents and disappointing them. Later though, she finds out all of the terrible things her family has done, she proves herself to be different from her family by defying her parents and opening up the Northwest Mansion gates to commoners (mostly to save Dipper). After this same episode both Pacifica and Dipper greatly improve their attitudes towards each other, and turned from almost strangers to friends. In \"Weirdmageddon pt. 3: Take Back the Falls\", Pacifica takes refuge in the Mystery Shack with several of the remaining un-petrified citizens of Gravity Falls, with most of Gravity Falls in chaos as a result of Weirdmageddon, and she teams up with the Pines (due to Bill petrifying her parents) to defeat Bill. By the end of the series, she is good friends with the Pines family, even Mabel. Her name is a pun on [[Pacific Northwest]], given the town of Gravity Falls is located in Oregon. In the graphic novel \"Gravity Falls: Lost Legends\", it is revealed that she was convinced that her appearance is important as a child througth her mother's conviction (such as when her mother read her ''[[The Ugly Duckling]]'' right until the point in which the title character is mocked for his appearance), which led her to believe that she must be beautiful to be accepted, througth she learns that she must be herself to be accepted while talking with Dipper, but it is also revealed that she has a crush on him.\n*  '''Robert Stacey \"Robbie\" Valentino'''{{anchor|Robbie}} (voiced by [[T.J. Miller]]) \u2013 A local [[emo|emo rock music]]-loving teenager who is Dipper's primary rival for Wendy's affections. He is angsty and has a cynical attitude toward most characters. Though he seems to genuinely care for Wendy, he is still sometimes inconsiderate, such as neglecting to listen to Wendy while playing a video game in the episode \"Fight Fighters\". Robbie and Wendy are a couple until \"Boyz Crazy\", in which Dipper informs Wendy that the song Robbie wrote for her has a [[Backmasked message|backmasked]] mind-controlling message, although Wendy is most upset that the song wasn't written for her. After the breakup, Robbie becomes greatly depressed about losing her, though his attempts to win her back or even mope only cause her (and everyone else) to stay annoyed with him. In the episode \"The Love God\", Robbie begins a relationship with Tambry, albeit due to Mabel matchmaking them via love potion in an attempt to cheer Robbie up. His parents are both [[undertaker]]s, though their personalities are the polar opposite of their son's, [[Gallows humor|possibly due to their work with the dead]]. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\", Robbie is among the citizens of Gravity falls who are captured and petrified by Bill's minions (Wendy states that this was because he stopped to take a selfie). He is rescued in \"Weirdmageddon 3\", and continues to unenthusiastically aid in his family's business.\n* '''Buddy \"Bud\" Gleeful''' (voiced by [[Stephen Root]]) \u2013 Li'l Gideon's polite and well-meaning father. Despite having a nervous wife and a manipulative child, Bud seems to always find ways to make money, even to the point of becoming allies with Grunkle Stan (Li'l Gideon's mortal enemy) for a business deal. Besides working at Li'l Gideon's \"Tent of Telepathy\", Bud also sells used cars. He was also a member of the Society of the Blind Eye, and was spotted in the past in the episode \"Blendin's Game\", pushing a stroller with Gideon in it. In the episode \"The Stanchurian Candidate\", he runs for mayor of Gravity Falls, mostly being forced by Li'l Gideon so he could get him out of jail. This attempt is unsuccessful. He makes two brief appearances in the series finale: he is first seen using Gideon plushies to make a fire, then as a guest at Dipper and Mabel's birthday party.\n* '''Preston and Priscilla<ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/3aj99f/im_matt_braly_storyboard_artist_and_director_on/csd9kcb?context=3</ref> Northwest''' \u2013 Preston (voiced by [[Nathan Fillion]]) and his wife, Priscilla (voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]]) are Pacifica Northwest's wealthy and apparently snobby parents. Most of the time, Preston places heavy stress on Pacifica to ensure she maintains their family's image of perfection. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\", Preston has the unlucky fate of being the first citizen in Gravity Falls to be victimized by Bill. He attempts to become one of Bill's minions only for Bill to switch around Preston's facial features (much to the horror of Priscilla and Pacifica). In pt. 3, it is revealed that both Preston and Priscilla were petrified by Bill's minions, but they are later restored to being human. However, they also go broke due to Preston investing all of his money towards Bill and at the end of the series, they are forced to sell their mansion to regain back their fortune, which happens when Fiddleford McGucket buys it. In ''Gravity Falls: Lost Legends'', it is revealed that Priscilla is a trophy wife (literally, according to Pacifica, as Preston won her in a yachting competition).\n* '''The [[Gnome]]s''' (voiced by Alex Hirsch) \u2013 The Gnomes appear in the first episode, where they capture Mabel Pines by disguising themselves as a boy named \"Norman\" for her to date (actually consisting of the gnomes Jeff, Carson, Steve, Jason, and Shmebulock) to try and make her their queen, only for her to be saved by Dipper. They appear as garden gnomes with pointed red caps and white beards, although they often run on all fours and have sharp teeth. The leader, Jeff, has sworn vengeance on the twins, but has yet to wreak it. Two of the gnomes, Shmebulock and his father, Shmebulock Sr., can only communicate by saying their names; in the ''Lost Legends'' book, this is revealed to be a result of a curse placed on them by a witch, and they are able to speak normally for a single night once every several centuries. The twins call on the gnomes later in the series to help take down a common enemy, but failed as Gideon forces them to carry them away.\n* '''Agent Powers and Agent Trigger'''{{anchor|Agents}} (voiced by [[Nick Offerman]] and Brad Abrell) \u2013 Agent Powers and Agent Trigger are agents of the US government. They went to Gravity Falls to investigate paranormal activity in the area. After Dipper raises the dead, the two are seen dragged off by [[zombies]] into a ditch. They later reappear alive at the end of the episode and are sure that Gravity Falls is the town they are looking for. In many episodes, they are secretly watching the Pines family, like in the background sitting in seats during the episode Sock Opera behind large newspapers, as well as in the after credits of Northwest Mansion Mystery, talking about a power surge they measured during the party. They appear again in Not What He Seems, where they arrest Grunkle Stan over suspicions that he is building a doomsday weapon. At the end of A Tale Of Two Stans, they (along with the rest of the government agents in their team investing the Mystery Shack) lose their memories of the portal due to the fact that Stanford used the Society of the Blindeye device to erase their memories.\n* '''Tambry''' (voiced by [[Jessica DiCicco]]) \u2013 Tambry is one of Wendy's friends. She has dyed hair and rarely looks up from her phone, either texting or updating her status. As of the episode \"The Love God\", she is in a relationship with Robbie. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\", she is among the citizens of Gravity Falls who are captured and petrified by Bill's minions. She is later restored to being human at the end of the series.\n* '''Lee and Nate''' (voiced by Michael Rianda and [[Scott Menville]]) \u2013 Wendy's friends. The two of them are usually seen together. Lee has [[blond]] hair and wears a red shirt, while Nate wears a cap and a black shirt. They both act like [[stereotype|stereotypical]], [[sarcasm|sarcastic]], care-free teenagers. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\", they are among the citizens of Gravity Falls who are captured and petrified by Bill's minions. They are both restored to being human at the end of the series.\n* '''Xyler and Craz''' (voiced by [[John Roberts (actor)|John Roberts]] and [[Greg Cipes]]) \u2013 The main characters of Mabel's favorite movie, a 1990s cult comedy called ''Dream Boy High''. They come to life numerous times during the show, most notably accompanying the group in \"Dreamscapers\" and serving as her associates in \"Weirdmageddon 2: Escape from Reality\".\n* '''Leon Thompson''' (voiced by Michael Rianda) \u2013 Thompson is one of Wendy's friends, and a constant source of ridicule and embarrassment by them. He is usually seen participating in the games the guys play, such as putting ice in his pants and trying to shoot a [[jelly bean]] into his navel. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\", he is among the citizens who are captured and petrified by Bill's minions. He is restored to being human at the end of the series.\n* '''\"Lazy\" Susan Wentworth''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Coolidge]]) \u2013 The sluggish [[Waiting staff|waitress]] at the local restaurant Greasy's Diner. She is shown to love fixing things, despite not being at all skilled. Her name is a pun on her [[Ptosis (eyelid)|lazy eye]], as well as a [[Lazy Susan|kitchen device]] she was trying to fix. She has several cats, three of which are named Donald, Sandy, and Mr. Cat-Face. Grunkle Stan had a crush on her, and eventually works up the nerve to win her over with Mabel's help but regrets it after she calls him repeatedly leaving unusual voice messages. She is shown to be scatterbrained in the episode \"Summerween\", when she categorically fails to guess what costumes Soos, Mabel, and Mabel's friends wear. As revealed in \"A Tale of Two Stans\", her constantly closed eye was caused by her accidentally touching one of Ford's inventions on the first Mystery Shack tour. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\", she is among the citizens who are captured and petrified by Bill's minions. She is restored to being human at the end of the series.\n* '''Toby Determined''' (voiced by [[Gregg Turkington]]) \u2013 A [[journalist]] for the Gravity Falls Gossiper, of which he is apparently the only employee. He is a hard-hitting yet wimpy journalist, shown to be terrible at his job {{snd}} an example is that in one episode, he tried to use a turkey baster as a microphone and a cinder block as a camera. He has an unrequited crush on local TV news reporter Shandra Jimenez which goes to such an extent that he has a cardboard-cutout of her in his closet and flirts with it when alone, as shown in the episode \"Headhunters\". A running gag is that he is often mistaken for a monster due to his hideous face, with Wendy even shooting him with an arrow under this assumption in \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\". He finally gets to work with Shandra Jimenez after Weirdmageddon concludes, and after he wears [[Punk subculture|punk]] clothes and adopts the name \"Bodacious T\". His name is a pun on \"to be determined\", said when information in a news story is currently unavailable. Toby is also a member of the Society of the Blind Eye.\n* '''Sir Lord Quentin Trembley III Esquire''' (voiced by [[Alex Hirsch]]) \u2013 The 8th and a half [[President of the United States]] who never finished his term after eating a salamander and jumping out of a window. After winning the 1837 election in a literal landslide, he quickly became known for being the silliest president in the United States where he waged war on pancakes, legalized marriage with woodpeckers, appointed six babies to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], issued the de-pantsipation proclamation, and declared in his State of the Union address, \"The only thing we have to fear is gigantic, man-eating spiders!\" Quentin is the true founder of Gravity Falls, but was replaced by local nobody Nathaniel Northwest (Pacifica's ancestor) as Quentin was seen as an embarrassment. He was found preserved in [[peanut brittle]] by the twins on their way to Washington D.C. after being captured by Blubs and Durland. After being freed by the twins, he gave Dipper his President's Key (which can open any lock in America made before 1877) and made Mabel a US congresswoman.\n* '''Blendin Blenjamin Blandin'''{{anchor|Blendin}} (voiced by [[Justin Roiland]]) \u2013 Blendin Blenjamin Blandin is a time traveler from the year 207\u0303012 (pronounced twenty-s\u00f1eventy-twelve) who was sent back in time to Gravity Falls to remove a set of time anomalies that Mabel and Dipper assume they started. He makes a full appearance in 'Time Traveler's Pig', but has made cameo appearances in episodes 1, 2, 3, and 20, cleaning up the time anomalies. A board on the closed-up shack on Glass Shard Beach that Stanley and Stanford went into has \"Blendin was here\" scribbled onto it. In the episode \"Blendin's Game\" he competes with the twins in a game called \"Globnar\" in order to get revenge on the twins for getting him arrested, by way of a \"time wish\", allowing one paradox-free wish to the holder, but he loses the final game of laser tag. It is suggested that he will no longer be a villain after the episode \"Blendin's Game\" when Dipper and Mabel actually helped him get his job back and gave him pretty hair. In \"Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future\" he is possessed by Bill Cipher so that he can release the dimensional rift. In \"Weirdmageddon Part 1\", upon realizing his possession, Blendin goes to gain help from his fellow time travelers only for Bill to kill all of them and for Blendin to escape to an unknown place as the sole survivor. However, in \"Journal 3\", Blendin isn't the only survivor of Weirdmageddon.

His origins are mostly unknown, but it is known that he was found frozen in an iceberg, which eventually melted and set him free on the future world.

He tends to be indecisive, especially when deciding between shirts with big cats on them, and is a frequent visitor of the Mystery Shack. In \"The Stanchurian Candidate\", he is elected mayor of Gravity Falls due to being the only candidate to fill in his paperwork. In the series finale, it is revealed that he is among the citizens of Gravity Falls to be petrified by Bill's minions. Along with the other citizens with this fate, Tyler was used to build a throne for Bill, but with Tyler being the load bearing victim, Dipper and Mabel managed to remove him, restoring the humanity of everyone Bill ever petrified. At the end of the series, he passed the \"Never Mind All That\" Act, telling everyone that if anyone asked what happened, they should say \"Never mind all that!\".\n\n==Minor characters==\n* '''Corduroy Boys''' \u2013 The three sons of Manly Dan and the younger brothers of Wendy.
