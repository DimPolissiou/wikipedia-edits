{"title_page": "Nuclear marine propulsion", "text_new": "'''Nuclear marine propulsion''' is [[Marine propulsion|propulsion of a ship]] or submarine with heat provided by a [[nuclear reactor|nuclear power plant]]. The power plant heats water to produce steam for a turbine used to turn the ship's propeller through a gearbox or through an electric generator and motor. Naval nuclear propulsion is used specifically within naval warships such as [[supercarrier]]s. A small number of experimental civil nuclear ships have been built.<ref>{{cite book |first=John G |last=Wirt |chapter=A Federal Demonstration Project: N.S. Savannah |title=Innovation in the maritime industry |volume=1 |location= |publisher=National Academies, for Maritime Transportation Research Board, National Research Council (US) |year=1979 |pages=29\u201336}}</ref>\n\nCompared to oil or coal fuelled ships, nuclear propulsion offers the advantages of very long intervals of operation before refueling. All the fuel is contained within the nuclear reactor, so no cargo or supplies space is taken up by fuel, nor is space taken up by exhaust stacks or combustion air intakes. However, the low fuel cost is offset by the high operating costs and investment in infrastructure, so nearly all nuclear-powered vessels are military ones.\n\n[[File:50 Let Pobedy.jpg|thumb|right|When the nuclear-powered {{sclass-|Arktika|icebreaker|4}} {{ship|NS|50 Let Pobedy}} was put into service in 2007, it became the world's largest icebreaker.]]\n\n==Power plants==\n\n===Basic operation of naval ship or submarine===\n\nMost naval nuclear reactors are of the [[Pressurized water reactor|pressurized water]] type.{{cn|date=August 2019}} A primary water circuit transfers heat generated from [[nuclear fission]] in the fuel to a [[steam generator (nuclear power)|steam generator]]; this water is kept under pressure so it does not boil. This circuit operates at a temperature of around  {{convert|250|to|300|C}}.  Any radioactive contamination in the primary water is confined.  Water is circulated by pumps; at lower power levels, reactors designed for submarines may rely on natural circulation of the water to reduce noise generated by the pumps.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe hot water from the reactor heats a separate water circuit in the steam generator.  The water turns to steam and passes through [[steam drier]]s on its way to the [[steam turbine]]. Spent steam at low pressure is run through a [[condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] cooled by seawater and returns to liquid form.  The water is pumped back to the steam generator and continues the cycle. Any water lost in the process can be made up by [[Desalination|desalinated]] sea water added to the steam generator feed water.<ref>Viren Chopra, Rob Houston (ed), ''DK Eyewitness Books: Transportation'', Penguin, 2012, {{ISBN|1465408894}}  page 60</ref>\n\nIn the turbine, the steam expands and reduces its pressure as it imparts energy to the rotating blades of the turbine.  There may be many stages of rotating blades and fixed guide vanes.  The output shaft of the turbine may be connected to a gearbox to reduce rotation speed, then a shaft connects to the vessel's propellers. In another form of drive system, the turbine turns an electrical generator, and the electric power produced is fed to one or more drive motors for the vessel's propellers. The [[Russian Navy|Russian]], [[United States Navy|US]] and [[Royal Navy|British]] navies rely on  direct steam turbine propulsion, while French and Chinese ships use the turbine to generate electricity for propulsion ([[turbo-electric transmission]]).{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nSome nuclear submarines have a single reactor, but Russian submarines have two, and so had {{USS|Triton|SSRN-586|6}}. Most American aircraft carriers are powered by two reactors, but {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}} had eight. The majority of marine [[Nuclear reactor|reactors]] are of the [[Pressurized water reactor|pressurized water]] type, although the US and Soviet navies have designed warships powered with [[liquid metal cooled reactor]]s.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Differences from land power plants===\nMarine-type reactors differ from land-based commercial electric power reactors in several respects.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nWhile land-based reactors in nuclear power plants produce up to around 1600 megawatts of electrical power, a typical marine propulsion reactor produces no more than a few hundred megawatts. Space considerations dictate that a marine reactor must be physically small, so it must generate higher power per unit of space. This means its components are subject to greater stresses than those of a land-based reactor. Its mechanical systems must operate flawlessly under the adverse conditions encountered at sea, including vibration and the pitching and rolling of a ship operating in rough seas. Reactor shutdown mechanisms cannot rely on gravity to drop control rods into place as in a land-based reactor that always remains upright. Salt water corrosion is an additional problem that complicates maintenance.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n[[File:Nuclear fuel element.jpg|thumb|A nuclear fuel element for the cargo ship {{ship|NS|Savannah}}. The element contains four bundles of 41 fuel rods. The uranium oxide is enriched to 4.2 and 4.6 percent U-235]]\n\nAs the core of a seagoing reactor is much smaller than a power reactor, the probability of a neutron intersecting with a fissionable nucleus before it escapes into the shielding is much lower. As such, the fuel is typically more highly enriched (i.e., contains a higher concentration of <sup>235</sup>U vs. <sup>238</sup>U) than that used in a land-based nuclear power plant, which increases the probability of fission to the level where a sustained reaction can occur. Some marine reactors run on relatively low-enriched [[uranium]] which requires more frequent refueling. Others run on [[highly enriched uranium]], varying from 20% <sup>235</sup>U, to the over 96% <sup>235</sup>U found in U.S. [[submarine]]s,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/e_research/e3_74.html |title=Global Submarine Proliferation: Emerging Trends and Problems |first=James Clay |last=Moltz |publisher=[[NTI]] |date=March 2006 |accessdate=2007-03-07}}</ref> in which the resulting smaller core is quieter in operation (a big advantage to a submarine).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.armscontrolwonk.com/1738/silence-is-highly-enriched-uranium |title=Silence is highly enriched uranium |date=December 13, 2007 |first=James |last=Acton |accessdate=2007-12-13}}</ref> Using more-highly enriched fuel also increases the reactor's power density and extends the usable life of the nuclear fuel load, but is more expensive and a greater risk to nuclear proliferation than less-highly enriched fuel.<ref name=\"ANTIENRICHED\">{{cite web |title=Ending the Production of Highly Enriched Uranium for Naval Reactors |work=James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies |url= http://cns.miis.edu/npr/pdfs/81mahip.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=September 25, 2008}}</ref>\n\nA marine nuclear propulsion plant must be designed to be highly reliable and self-sufficient, requiring minimal maintenance and repairs, which might have to be undertaken many thousands of miles from its home port. One of the technical difficulties in designing fuel elements for a seagoing nuclear reactor is the creation of fuel elements which will withstand a large amount of radiation damage. Fuel elements may crack over time and gas bubbles may form. The fuel used in marine reactors is a metal-[[zirconium]] alloy rather than the ceramic UO<sub>2</sub> ([[uranium dioxide]]) often used in land-based reactors. Marine reactors are designed for long core life, enabled by the relatively high enrichment of the uranium and by incorporating a \"[[Neutron_poison#Burnable_poisons|burnable poison]]\" in the fuel elements, which is slowly depleted as the fuel elements age and become less reactive. The gradual dissipation of the \"nuclear poison\" increases the reactivity of the core to compensate for the lessening reactivity of the aging fuel elements, thereby lengthening the usable life of the fuel. The life of the compact [[Reactor vessel|reactor pressure vessel]] is extended by providing an internal [[neutron]] shield, which reduces the damage to the steel from constant bombardment by neutrons.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Decommissioning==\nDecommissioning nuclear-powered submarines has become a major task for US and Russian navies. After defuelling, U.S. practice is to cut the reactor section from the vessel for disposal in shallow land burial as low-level waste (see the ''[[ship-submarine recycling program]]''). In Russia, whole vessels, or sealed reactor sections, typically remain stored afloat, although a new facility near [[Sayda Bay]] is to provide storage in a concrete-floored facility on land for some submarines in the far north.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Future designs==\nRussia built a [[Russian floating nuclear power station|floating nuclear power plant]] for their far eastern territories. The design has two 35 MWe units based on the [[KLT-40 reactor]] used in [[icebreaker]]s (with refueling every four years). Some Russian naval vessels have been used to supply electricity for domestic and industrial use in remote far eastern and Siberian towns.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn 2010, [[Lloyd's Register]] was investigating the possibility of civilian nuclear marine propulsion and rewriting draft rules (see text under ''Merchant Ships'').<ref name=\"wnnLL\">{{Citation | url = http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN_Full_steam_ahead_for_nuclear_shipping_1811101.html | title = Full steam ahead for nuclear shipping | newspaper = World Nuclear News | date = 18 November 2010 | accessdate = 27 November 2010}}.</ref><ref name=\"Hirdaris 101\u2013130\">{{cite journal|last1 = Hirdaris |first1 =Spyros| first2 =YF | last2 = Cheng | first3 = P | last3 = Shallcross | first4 = J | last4 = Bonafoux | first5 = D | last5 = Carlson | first6 = B | last6 = Prince | first7 = GA | last7 = Sarris|title=Considerations on the potential use of Nuclear Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology for merchant marine propulsion|journal=Ocean Engineering|date=15 March 2014|volume=79|pages=101\u2013130|doi=10.1016/j.oceaneng.2013.10.015}}</ref><ref name=\"Hirdaris A37-A60\">{{cite journal| last1 = Hirdaris | first1 = Spyros| first2 = YF | last2 = Cheng | first3 = P | last3 = Shallcross | first4 = J | last4 = Bonafoux | first5 = D | last5 = Carlson | first6 = B | last6 = Prince | first7 = GA | last7 = Sarris | title = Concept Design for a Suezmax Tanker Powered by a 70 MW Small Modular Reactor|journal=Transactions of the Royal Institution of Naval Architects, International Journal of Maritime Engineering|date=March 2014|volume=156|issue=A1|pages =A37\u2013A60|doi= 10.3940/rina.ijme.2014.a1.276}}</ref>\n\n==Civil liability==\nInsurance of nuclear vessels is not like the insurance of conventional ships.

The first types developed were the Project 627, NATO designated {{sclass2-|November|submarine|4}} with two water-cooled reactors, the first of which, K-3 ''Leninskiy Komsomol'', was underway under nuclear power on July 4, 1958.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nNuclear power revolutionized the submarine, finally making it a true \"underwater\" vessel, rather than a \"submersible\" craft, which could only stay underwater for limited periods. It gave the submarine the ability to operate submerged at high speeds, comparable to those of surface vessels, for unlimited periods, dependent only on the endurance of its crew. To demonstrate this {{USS|Triton|SSRN-586|6}} was the first vessel to execute a submerged [[circumnavigation]] of the Earth ([[Operation Sandblast]]), doing so in 1960.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n''Nautilus'', with a [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR), led to the parallel development of other submarines like a unique liquid metal cooled (sodium) reactor in {{USS|Seawolf|SSN-575|6}}, or two reactors in ''Triton'', and then the {{Sclass-|Skate|submarine|2}}s, powered by single reactors, and a cruiser, {{USS|Long Beach|CGN-9|6}}, in 1961, powered by two reactors.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nBy 1962 the [[United States Navy]] had 26 operational nuclear submarines and another 30 under construction.

For example, the cargo coaster<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.janleenkloosterman.nl/reports/thesis_jacobs_2007.pdf |last=Jacobs |first=JGCC |year=2007 |title=Nuclear Short Sea Shipping |publisher=Green Nuclear Energy |format=pdf |accessdate=}}</ref> is a new design for a nuclear cargo ship.\n\nIn November 2010 British Maritime Technology and Lloyd's Register embarked upon a two-year study with US-based Hyperion Power Generation (now [[Gen4 Energy]]), and the Greek ship operator Enterprises Shipping and Trading SA to investigate the practical maritime applications for small modular reactors. The research intended to produce a concept tanker-ship design, based on a 70 MWt reactor such as Hyperion's. In response to its members' interest in nuclear propulsion, Lloyd's Register has also re-written its 'rules' for nuclear ships, which concern the integration of a reactor certified by a land-based regulator with the rest of the ship. The overall rationale of the rule-making process assumes that in contrast to the current marine industry practice where the designer/builder typically demonstrates compliance with regulatory requirements, in the future the nuclear regulators will wish to ensure that it is the operator of the nuclear plant that demonstrates safety in operation, in addition to the safety through design and construction. Nuclear ships are currently the responsibility of their own countries, but none are involved in international trade. As a result of this work in 2014 two papers on commercial nuclear marine propulsion were published by Lloyd's Register and the other members of this consortium.<ref name=\"Hirdaris 101\u2013130\"/><ref name=\"Hirdaris A37-A60\"/> These publications review past and recent work in the area of marine nuclear propulsion and describe a preliminary concept design study for a {{DWT|155,000}} Suezmax tanker that is based on a conventional hull form with alternative arrangements for accommodating a 70 MWt nuclear propulsion plant delivering up to 23.5 MW shaft power at maximum continuous rating (average: 9.75 MW). The Gen4Energy power module is considered. This is a small fast-neutron reactor using lead-bismuth eutectic cooling and able to operate for ten full-power years before refueling, and in service last for a 25-year operational life of the vessel. They conclude that the concept is feasible, but further maturity of nuclear technology and the development and harmonisation of the regulatory framework would be necessary before the concept would be viable.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Merchant cargo ships===\n* {{ship||Mutsu|nuclear ship|2}}, Japan (1970\u20131992; never carried commercial cargo, rebuild as diesel engine powered ''RV Mirai'' in 1996)\n* {{ship||Otto Hahn|ship|2}}, Germany (1968\u20131979; re-powered with diesel engine in 1979)\n* {{ship|NS|Savannah}}, United States (1962\u20131972)\n* ''[[Sevmorput]]'', Russia (1988\u2013present)\n\n===Icebreakers===\n{{main|Nuclear-powered icebreaker}}\nNuclear propulsion has proven both technically and economically feasible for [[nuclear-powered icebreaker]]s in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Arctic]].

The power plant heats water to produce steam for a turbine used to turn the ship's propeller through a gearbox or through an electric generator and motor. Naval nuclear propulsion is used specifically within naval warships such as [[supercarrier]]s. A small number of experimental civil nuclear ships have been built.<ref>{{cite book |first=John G |last=Wirt |chapter=A Federal Demonstration Project: N.S.

All the fuel is contained within the nuclear reactor, so no cargo or supplies space is taken up by fuel, nor is space taken up by exhaust stacks or combustion air intakes. However, the low fuel cost is offset by the high operating costs and investment in infrastructure, so nearly all nuclear-powered vessels are military ones.\n\n[[File:50 Let Pobedy.jpg|thumb|right|When the nuclear-powered {{sclass-|Arktika|icebreaker|4}} {{ship|NS|50 Let Pobedy}} was put into service in 2007, it became the world's largest icebreaker.]]\n\n==Power plants==\n\n===Basic operation of naval ship or submarine===\n\nMost naval nuclear reactors are of the [[Pressurized water reactor|pressurized water]] type.{{cn|date=August 2019}} A primary water circuit transfers heat generated from [[nuclear fission]] in the fuel to a [[steam generator (nuclear power)|steam generator]]; this water is kept under pressure so it does not boil. This circuit operates at a temperature of around  {{convert|250|to|300|C}}.  Any radioactive contamination in the primary water is confined.  Water is circulated by pumps; at lower power levels, reactors designed for submarines may rely on natural circulation of the water to reduce noise generated by the pumps.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe hot water from the reactor heats a separate water circuit in the steam generator.  The water turns to steam and passes through [[steam drier]]s on its way to the [[steam turbine]]. Spent steam at low pressure is run through a [[condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] cooled by seawater and returns to liquid form.  The water is pumped back to the steam generator and continues the cycle. Any water lost in the process can be made up by [[Desalination|desalinated]] sea water added to the steam generator feed water.<ref>Viren Chopra, Rob Houston (ed), ''DK Eyewitness Books: Transportation'', Penguin, 2012, {{ISBN|1465408894}}  page 60</ref>\n\nIn the turbine, the steam expands and reduces its pressure as it imparts energy to the rotating blades of the turbine.  There may be many stages of rotating blades and fixed guide vanes.  The output shaft of the turbine may be connected to a gearbox to reduce rotation speed, then a shaft connects to the vessel's propellers. In another form of drive system, the turbine turns an electrical generator, and the electric power produced is fed to one or more drive motors for the vessel's propellers. The [[Russian Navy|Russian]], [[United States Navy|US]] and [[Royal Navy|British]] navies rely on  direct steam turbine propulsion, while French and Chinese ships use the turbine to generate electricity for propulsion ([[turbo-electric transmission]]).{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nSome nuclear submarines have a single reactor, but Russian submarines have two, and so had {{USS|Triton|SSRN-586|6}}. Most American aircraft carriers are powered by two reactors, but {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}} had eight. The majority of marine [[Nuclear reactor|reactors]] are of the [[Pressurized water reactor|pressurized water]] type, although the US and Soviet navies have designed warships powered with [[liquid metal cooled reactor]]s.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Differences from land power plants===\nMarine-type reactors differ from land-based commercial electric power reactors in several respects.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nWhile land-based reactors in nuclear power plants produce up to around 1600 megawatts of electrical power, a typical marine propulsion reactor produces no more than a few hundred megawatts. Space considerations dictate that a marine reactor must be physically small, so it must generate higher power per unit of space. This means its components are subject to greater stresses than those of a land-based reactor. Its mechanical systems must operate flawlessly under the adverse conditions encountered at sea, including vibration and the pitching and rolling of a ship operating in rough seas. Reactor shutdown mechanisms cannot rely on gravity to drop control rods into place as in a land-based reactor that always remains upright. Salt water corrosion is an additional problem that complicates maintenance.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n[[File:Nuclear fuel element.jpg|thumb|A nuclear fuel element for the cargo ship {{ship|NS|Savannah}}. The element contains four bundles of 41 fuel rods. The uranium oxide is enriched to 4.2 and 4.6 percent U-235]]\n\nAs the core of a seagoing reactor is much smaller than a power reactor, the probability of a neutron intersecting with a fissionable nucleus before it escapes into the shielding is much lower. As such, the fuel is typically more highly enriched (i.e., contains a higher concentration of <sup>235</sup>U vs. <sup>238</sup>U) than that used in a land-based nuclear power plant, which increases the probability of fission to the level where a sustained reaction can occur. Some marine reactors run on relatively low-enriched [[uranium]] which requires more frequent refueling. Others run on [[highly enriched uranium]], varying from 20% <sup>235</sup>U, to the over 96% <sup>235</sup>U found in U.S. [[submarine]]s,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/e_research/e3_74.html |title=Global Submarine Proliferation: Emerging Trends and Problems |first=James Clay |last=Moltz |publisher=[[NTI]] |date=March 2006 |accessdate=2007-03-07}}</ref> in which the resulting smaller core is quieter in operation (a big advantage to a submarine).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.armscontrolwonk.com/1738/silence-is-highly-enriched-uranium |title=Silence is highly enriched uranium |date=December 13, 2007 |first=James |last=Acton |accessdate=2007-12-13}}</ref> Using more-highly enriched fuel also increases the reactor's power density and extends the usable life of the nuclear fuel load, but is more expensive and a greater risk to nuclear proliferation than less-highly enriched fuel.<ref name=\"ANTIENRICHED\">{{cite web |title=Ending the Production of Highly Enriched Uranium for Naval Reactors |work=James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies |url= http://cns.miis.edu/npr/pdfs/81mahip.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=September 25, 2008}}</ref>\n\nA marine nuclear propulsion plant must be designed to be highly reliable and self-sufficient, requiring minimal maintenance and repairs, which might have to be undertaken many thousands of miles from its home port. One of the technical difficulties in designing fuel elements for a seagoing nuclear reactor is the creation of fuel elements which will withstand a large amount of radiation damage. Fuel elements may crack over time and gas bubbles may form. The fuel used in marine reactors is a metal-[[zirconium]] alloy rather than the ceramic UO<sub>2</sub> ([[uranium dioxide]]) often used in land-based reactors. Marine reactors are designed for long core life, enabled by the relatively high enrichment of the uranium and by incorporating a \"[[Nuclear poison|burnable poison]]\" in the fuel elements, which is slowly depleted as the fuel elements age and become less reactive. The gradual dissipation of the \"nuclear poison\" increases the reactivity of the core to compensate for the lessening reactivity of the aging fuel elements, thereby lengthening the usable life of the fuel. The life of the compact [[Reactor vessel|reactor pressure vessel]] is extended by providing an internal [[neutron]] shield, which reduces the damage to the steel from constant bombardment by neutrons.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Decommissioning==\nDecommissioning nuclear-powered submarines has become a major task for US and Russian navies. After defuelling, U.S. practice is to cut the reactor section from the vessel for disposal in shallow land burial as low-level waste (see the ''[[ship-submarine recycling program]]''). In Russia, whole vessels, or sealed reactor sections, typically remain stored afloat, although a new facility near [[Sayda Bay]] is to provide storage in a concrete-floored facility on land for some submarines in the far north.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Future designs==\nRussia built a [[Russian floating nuclear power station|floating nuclear power plant]] for their far eastern territories. The design has two 35 MWe units based on the [[KLT-40 reactor]] used in [[icebreaker]]s (with refueling every four years). Some Russian naval vessels have been used to supply electricity for domestic and industrial use in remote far eastern and Siberian towns.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn 2010, [[Lloyd's Register]] was investigating the possibility of civilian nuclear marine propulsion and rewriting draft rules (see text under ''Merchant Ships'').<ref name=\"wnnLL\">{{Citation | url = http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN_Full_steam_ahead_for_nuclear_shipping_1811101.html | title = Full steam ahead for nuclear shipping | newspaper = World Nuclear News | date = 18 November 2010 | accessdate = 27 November 2010}}.</ref><ref name=\"Hirdaris 101\u2013130\">{{cite journal|last1 = Hirdaris |first1 =Spyros| first2 =YF | last2 = Cheng | first3 = P | last3 = Shallcross | first4 = J | last4 = Bonafoux | first5 = D | last5 = Carlson | first6 = B | last6 = Prince | first7 = GA | last7 = Sarris|title=Considerations on the potential use of Nuclear Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology for merchant marine propulsion|journal=Ocean Engineering|date=15 March 2014|volume=79|pages=101\u2013130|doi=10.1016/j.oceaneng.2013.10.015}}</ref><ref name=\"Hirdaris A37-A60\">{{cite journal| last1 = Hirdaris | first1 = Spyros| first2 = YF | last2 = Cheng | first3 = P | last3 = Shallcross | first4 = J | last4 = Bonafoux | first5 = D | last5 = Carlson | first6 = B | last6 = Prince | first7 = GA | last7 = Sarris | title = Concept Design for a Suezmax Tanker Powered by a 70 MW Small Modular Reactor|journal=Transactions of the Royal Institution of Naval Architects, International Journal of Maritime Engineering|date=March 2014|volume=156|issue=A1|pages =A37\u2013A60|doi= 10.3940/rina.ijme.2014.a1.276}}</ref>\n\n==Civil liability==\nInsurance of nuclear vessels is not like the insurance of conventional ships.

According to Russian state TV, it is claimed to be able to deliver a [[thermonuclear]] [[cobalt bomb]] of up to 200 [[megatonne]]s (four times as powerful as the most powerful device ever detonated, the [[Tsar Bomba]], and twice its maximum theoretical yield) against an enemy's naval ports and coastal cities.<ref name=\"urlRussian media: nuclear torpedo can destroy the US, Europe, the world - Business Insider\">{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-media-nuclear-torpedo-can-destroy-the-us-europe-the-world-2019-1?IR=T |title=Russian media: nuclear torpedo can destroy the US, Europe, the world \u2013 Business Insider |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==Civilian nuclear ships==\n[[File:Ns-savanna-eng.jpg|thumb|140px|Engineer epaulette from ''Savannah'']]\nThe following are [[ship]]s that are or were in commercial or civilian use and have nuclear marine propulsion.\n\n===Merchant ships===\nNuclear-powered, civil merchant ships have not developed beyond a few experimental ships. The US-built {{ship|NS|Savannah}}, completed in 1962, was primarily a demonstration of civil nuclear power and was too small and expensive to operate economically as a merchant ship. The design was too much of a compromise, being neither an efficient freighter nor a viable passenger liner. The German-built {{ship||Otto Hahn|ship|2}}, a cargo ship and research facility, sailed some {{convert|650000|nmi|km}} on 126 voyages over 10 years without any technical problems.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} However, it proved too expensive to operate and was converted to diesel. The Japanese {{ship||Mutsu|nuclear ship|2}} was dogged by technical and political problems. Its reactor had significant radiation leakage and fishermen protested against the vessel's operation. All of these three ships used low-enriched uranium. ''[[Sevmorput]]'', a Soviet and later Russian [[Lighter aboard ship|LASH carrier]] with icebreaking capability, has operated successfully on the [[Northern Sea Route]] since it was commissioned in 1988. {{Asof|2012}}, it is the only nuclear-powered merchant ship in service.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nCivilian nuclear ships suffer from the costs of specialized infrastructure. The Savannah was expensive to operate since it was the only vessel using its specialized nuclear shore staff and servicing facility.  A larger fleet could share fixed costs among more operating vessels, reducing operating costs.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nRecently{{when|date=August 2019}} there has been renewed interest in nuclear propulsion, and some proposals have been drafted. For example, the cargo coaster<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.janleenkloosterman.nl/reports/thesis_jacobs_2007.pdf |last=Jacobs |first=JGCC |year=2007 |title=Nuclear Short Sea Shipping |publisher=Green Nuclear Energy |format=pdf |accessdate=}}</ref> is a new design for a nuclear cargo ship.\n\nIn November 2010 British Maritime Technology and Lloyd's Register embarked upon a two-year study with US-based Hyperion Power Generation (now [[Gen4 Energy]]), and the Greek ship operator Enterprises Shipping and Trading SA to investigate the practical maritime applications for small modular reactors. The research intended to produce a concept tanker-ship design, based on a 70 MWt reactor such as Hyperion's. In response to its members' interest in nuclear propulsion, Lloyd's Register has also re-written its 'rules' for nuclear ships, which concern the integration of a reactor certified by a land-based regulator with the rest of the ship. The overall rationale of the rule-making process assumes that in contrast to the current marine industry practice where the designer/builder typically demonstrates compliance with regulatory requirements, in the future the nuclear regulators will wish to ensure that it is the operator of the nuclear plant that demonstrates safety in operation, in addition to the safety through design and construction. Nuclear ships are currently the responsibility of their own countries, but none are involved in international trade. As a result of this work in 2014 two papers on commercial nuclear marine propulsion were published by Lloyd's Register and the other members of this consortium.<ref name=\"Hirdaris 101\u2013130\"/><ref name=\"Hirdaris A37-A60\"/> These publications review past and recent work in the area of marine nuclear propulsion and describe a preliminary concept design study for a {{DWT|155,000}} Suezmax tanker that is based on a conventional hull form with alternative arrangements for accommodating a 70 MWt nuclear propulsion plant delivering up to 23.5 MW shaft power at maximum continuous rating (average: 9.75 MW). The Gen4Energy power module is considered. This is a small fast-neutron reactor using lead-bismuth eutectic cooling and able to operate for ten full-power years before refueling, and in service last for a 25-year operational life of the vessel. They conclude that the concept is feasible, but further maturity of nuclear technology and the development and harmonisation of the regulatory framework would be necessary before the concept would be viable.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Merchant cargo ships===\n* {{ship||Mutsu|nuclear ship|2}}, Japan (1970\u20131992; never carried commercial cargo, rebuild as diesel engine powered ''RV Mirai'' in 1996)\n* {{ship||Otto Hahn|ship|2}}, Germany (1968\u20131979; re-powered with diesel engine in 1979)\n* {{ship|NS|Savannah}}, United States (1962\u20131972)\n* ''[[Sevmorput]]'', Russia (1988\u2013present)\n\n===Icebreakers===\n{{main|Nuclear-powered icebreaker}}\nNuclear propulsion has proven both technically and economically feasible for [[nuclear-powered icebreaker]]s in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Arctic]]. Nuclear-fuelled ships operate for years without refueling, and the vessels have powerful engines, well-suited to the task of icebreaking.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe [[Lenin (nuclear icebreaker)|Soviet icebreaker ''Lenin'']] was the world's first nuclear-powered surface vessel in 1959 and remained in service for 30 years (new reactors were fitted in 1970). It led to a series of larger icebreakers, the 23,500 [[Tonnage|ton]] {{Sclass-|Arktika|icebreaker|4}} of six vessels, launched beginning in 1975. These vessels have two reactors and are used in deep Arctic waters. [[Arktika (1972 nuclear icebreaker)|NS ''Arktika'']] was the first surface vessel to reach the [[North Pole]].{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nFor use in shallow waters such as estuaries and rivers, shallow-draft, [[Nuclear-powered icebreaker#Taymyr class|''Taymyr''-class icebreakers]] were built in [[Finland]] and then fitted with their single-reactor nuclear propulsion system in [[Russia]].
