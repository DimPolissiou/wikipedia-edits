This line was put into service on January 10, 1905 with the route number 39. It originally had a single track outside of Marseille (doubled between 1926 and 1930) laid on a sidewalk along the national road.

Departures then took place in an alternating manner with a departure on each line every 30 or 40 minutes.

These \u201cPullman\u201d trams were replaced in 1937 by bogie trams, which were modernized beginning in 1944.\n\nFrom 9 November 1950, the service began to be split between trams and buses, which connected the Noailles station to Saint-Pierre along the Cours Lieutaud, Baille boulevard and St. Pierre street, continuing parallel to the tram track, with trams only running during peak hours.

The winner was announced, and the crowd waited for the winner to stand up to accept the traditional congratulations before the chairing ceremony, but no winner appeared. It was then announced that Hedd Wyn had been killed the previous month on the battlefield at [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]] in Belgium. These events were portrayed in the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominated film ''[[Hedd Wyn (film)|Hedd Wyn]]''.\n\nIn 1940, during the [[Second World War]], the Eisteddfod was not held, for fear that it would be a bombing target. Instead, the BBC broadcast an Eisteddfod radio programme, and the Chair, Crown and a Literature Medal (as opposed to the usual Prose Medal) were awarded.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cymru/canrif/1940.shtml| title=Lleoliad yr Eisteddfod: Eisteddfod Radio| publisher=BBC| accessdate=16 August 2012|language=cy}}</ref>\n\nIn 1950 a new rule was created that required all competitions to be held in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. However, settings of the [[Mass (music)|mass]] in Latin are allowed and this has been controversially used to allow concerts featuring international soloists.<ref name=loophole>{{cite web|author=Rhodri Clark |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/eisteddfod-latin-in-language-loophole-2198426 |title=Eisteddfod Latin in language loophole |publisher=Wales Online |date= |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years efforts have been made to attract more non-Welsh speakers to the event, with the officlal website stating \"everyone is welcome at the Eisteddfod, whatever language they speak\". The Eisteddfod offers bilingual signage and simultaneous-translation of many events though wireless headphones. There is also a Welsh-learners area called Maes D. These efforts has helped increase takings, and the 2006 Eisteddfod reported a profit of over \u00a3100,000, despite costing \u00a32.8m to stage. The Eisteddfod attracts some 160,000 people annually. The National Eisteddfod in Cardiff (2008) drew record crowds, with over 160,000 visitors attending.\n\nIt was proposed that the [[2018 Cardiff National Eisteddfod|2018 National Eisteddfod in Cardiff]] would use permanent buildings to host events rather than in the traditional [[Maes (eisteddfod)|Maes]] site and tents. This was due partially to a lack of suitable land that could be repaired affordably after the festival. It was billed as an \"Eisteddfod with no fence\" in the media and was held at Cardiff Bay.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://eisteddfod.wales/2018-eisteddfod/2018-eisteddfod |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801233456/https://eisteddfod.wales/2018-eisteddfod/2018-eisteddfod |archivedate=2017-08-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Eryl Crump |url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/hundreds-parade-2018-national-eisteddfod-13235195 |title=Hundreds parade for 2018 National Eisteddfod proclamation |publisher=Daily Post |date=2017-06-25 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Huw |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-33813043 |title=National Eisteddfod considers ditching the Maes in 2018 |publisher=BBC News |date=2015-08-07 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref> The 2019 Eisteddfod in [[Llanrwst]] returned to the traditional [[Maes (eisteddfod)|Maes]].\n\n===Attendance===\n(''incomplete'')\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!year\n!total attendance\n!profit/loss\n|-\n| 2002\n| 144,220\n| -\n|-\n| 2003\n| 176,402\n|\n|-\n| 2004\n| 147,785\n| -\n|-\n| 2005\n| 157,820\n| -\n|-\n| 2006\n| 155,437\n| +\u00a3100,000\n|-\n|2007\n|154,944<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/6944617.stm|title=Traders count cost of Eisteddfod|date=2007-08-13|access-date=2017-11-25|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n| +\u00a34,324<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/eisteddfod-work-pays-4000-profit-2824338|title=Eisteddfod work pays off with \u00a34,000 profit|last=Post|first=North Wales Daily|date=2008-07-01|work=northwales|access-date=2017-11-23}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2008\n| 156,697\n| +\u00a338,000<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/eisteddfod-needs-more-cash-ahead-2791717|title=Eisteddfod needs more cash ahead of Bala event|last=Post|first=North Wales Daily|date=2009-04-20|work=northwales|access-date=2017-11-23}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2009\n| 164,689\n|  +\u00a3145,000<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/national-eisteddfod-wrexham-makes-90k-2680162|title=National Eisteddfod in Wrexham makes \u00a390k loss|last=Crump|first=Eryl|date=2011-11-28|website=northwales|access-date=2019-08-10}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2010\n| 136,933<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/eisteddfod_2010/8320455.EISTEDDFOD__Festival____raised_valleys____profile___/ |title=EISTEDDFOD: Festival 'raised valleys' profile' |publisher=South Wales Argus |date=2010-08-09 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref>\n|  -\u00a347,000<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n| 2011\n| 148,892<ref name=\"walesonline1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/national-eisteddfod-2015-results-friday-9815399 |title=National Eisteddfod 2015: The results from Friday |publisher=Wales Online |date=2015-08-07 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref> \n|  -\u00a390,000<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n| 2012\n| 138,767<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.valeofglamorgan.gov.uk/en/our_council/Council-Structure/minutes,_agendas_and_reports/reports/scrutiny_ee/2012/12-11-06/national_eisteddfod.aspx |title=National Eisteddfod |publisher=Valeofglamorgan.gov.uk |date=2012-12-11 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref>\n| +\u00a350,000\n|-\n| 2013\n| 153,704<ref name=\"walesonline1\"/> \n| +\u00a376,000\n|-\n| 2014\n|143,502\n| +\u00a390,000\n|-\n|2015\n|150,776\n|<nowiki>+\u00a354,721</nowiki><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/national-eisteddfods-iconic-pink-pavilion-10517410|title=National Eisteddfod's iconic pink pavilion to be replaced|last=Crump|first=Eryl|date=2015-11-28|website=northwales|access-date=2019-08-10}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2016\n| 140,229\n| +\u00a36,000<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/national-eisteddfod-2016-cultural-financial-12233637|title=National Eisteddfod 2016 was a 'cultural and financial success'|last=Crump|first=Eryl|date=2016-11-26|work=northwales|access-date=2017-11-23}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2017\n| 147,498\n| +\u00a393,200<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-42122512|title=National Eisteddfod 2019 in Llanrwst|date=2017-11-25|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-25|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2018\n| ~500,000\n| -\u00a3290,000<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46327940 |title=National Eisteddfod 2019 in Llanrwst|date=2018-11-24 |work=BBC News|access-date=2019-08-04|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2019\n| 150,000\n| -\u00a3158,982<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46327940 |title=The reason why National Eisteddfod 2019 made loss of more than \u00a3150,000 |date=2019-11-23 |work=North Wales Live|access-date=2020-04-02|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n|}\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Cymru, Glynebwy, 1958.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Chairing of the Bard|chairing]] ceremony of the 1958 National Eisteddfod; the victorious poet was [[T.

(Mold, 2007)]]\n[[File:Y Lle Celf.JPG|thumb|250px|'[[Y Lle Celf]]' (Blaenau Gwent, 2010)]]\nThe National Eisteddfod is traditionally held in the first week of August, and the competitions are all held in the [[Welsh language]]. However, settings of the [[Mass (music)|mass]] in Latin are allowed and this has been controversially used to allow concerts featuring international soloists.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rhodri Clark |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/eisteddfod-latin-in-language-loophole-2198426 |title=Eisteddfod Latin in language loophole |publisher=Wales Online |date=2008-02-26 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref>\n\nThe venue is officially proclaimed a year in advance, at which time the themes and texts for the competitions are published. The organisation for the location will have begun a year or more earlier, and locations are generally known two or three years ahead. The [[Eisteddfod Act]] of 1959 allowed local authorities to give financial support to the event. Traditionally the Eisteddfod venue alternates between north and south Wales; the decision to hold both the 2014 and 2015 Eisteddfodau in South Wales was thus seen as controversial,<ref name=autogenerated1 /> but the decision was later reversed and Montgomeryshire named as host county for 2015.<ref name=autogenerated2>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/eisteddfod/2011/sites/news/pages/eisteddfod_2016.shtml Site for the Eisteddfod until 2016] at BBC Wales, 8 July 2010</ref> Occasionally the Eisteddfod has been held in England, although the last occasion was in 1929.<ref name=\"venues-list\" />\n\nHundreds of tents, pavilions and booths are erected in an open space to create the ''[[Maes (eisteddfod)|Maes]]'' (field). The space required for this means that it is rare for the Eisteddfod to be in a city or town: instead it is held somewhere with more space. Car parking for day visitors alone requires several large fields, and many people camp on the site for the whole week.\n\nThe festival has a quasi-[[Gorsedd|druidic]] flavour, with the main literary prizes for poetry and prose being awarded in colourful and dramatic ceremonies under the auspices of the [[Gorsedd]] of Bards of the Island of Britain, complete with prominent figures in Welsh cultural life dressed in flowing druidic costumes, flower dances, trumpet fanfares and a symbolic [[cornucopia|Horn of Plenty]]. However, the [[Gorsedd]] is not an ancient institution or a pagan ceremony but rather a romantic creation by [[Iolo Morganwg]] in the 1790s, which first became a formal part of the Eisteddfod ceremonial in 1819.<ref name=\"museum1\"/> Nevertheless, it is taken very seriously, and an award of a crown or a chair for poetry is a great honour. The [[Chairing of the Bard|Chairing]] and [[Crowning of the Bard|Crowning]] ceremonies are the highlights of the week, and are presided over by the [[Archdruid]]. Other important awards include the {{illm|Prose Medal|cy|Medal Ryddiaith}} (first introduced in 1937).\n\nIf no stone circle is there already, one is created out of [[Gorsedd stones]], usually taken from the local area. These stone circles are icons all across Wales and signify the Eisteddfod having visited a community. As a cost-saving measure, the 2005 Eisteddfod was the first to use a temporary \"fibre-glass stone\" circle for the druidic ceremonies instead of a permanent stone circle. This also has the benefit of bringing the Gorsedd ceremonies onto the ''maes'': previously they were often held many miles away, hidden from most of the public. \n \nAs well as the main pavilion with the main stage, there are other venues through the week. Some are fixtures every year, hosting gigs (Maes B/Llwyfan y Maes/Caffi Maes B). Other fixtures of the ''maes'' are the ''Pabell L\u00ean'' (literature pavilion), the ''Neuadd Ddawns'' (dance hall), the ''Pabell Wyddoniaeth a Thechnoleg'' (science and technology pavilion), ''Maes D'' (learners' pavilion), at least one theatre, ''Y Cwt Drama'' (the drama hut), ''T\u0177 Gwerin'' (folk house), ''[[Y Lle Celf]]'' (\"the Art Place\") and hundreds of ''stondinau'' (stands and booths) where groups, societies, councils, charities and shops exhibit and sell. Since 2004, alcohol has been sold on the ''maes''; previously there was a no-alcohol policy.\n\n==Poetry awards==\nThe Eisteddfod's most well-known awards are those for poetry.\n===Chairing of the

The winner was announced, and the crowd waited for the winner to stand up to accept the traditional congratulations before the chairing ceremony, but no winner appeared. It was then announced that Hedd Wyn had been killed the previous month on the battlefield at [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]] in Belgium. These events were portrayed in the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominated film ''[[Hedd Wyn (film)|Hedd Wyn]]''.\n\nIn 1940, during the [[Second World War]], the Eisteddfod was not held, for fear that it would be a bombing target. Instead, the BBC broadcast an Eisteddfod radio programme, and the Chair, Crown and a Literature Medal (as opposed to the usual Prose Medal) were awarded.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cymru/canrif/1940.shtml| title=Lleoliad yr Eisteddfod: Eisteddfod Radio| publisher=BBC| accessdate=16 August 2012|language=cy}}</ref>\n\nIn 1950 a new rule was created that required all competitions to be held in [[Welsh language|Welsh]].

The Eisteddfod offers bilingual signage and simultaneous-translation of many events though wireless headphones. There is also a Welsh-learners area called Maes D. These efforts has helped increase takings, and the 2006 Eisteddfod reported a profit of over \u00a3100,000, despite costing \u00a32.8m to stage. The Eisteddfod attracts some 160,000 people annually. The National Eisteddfod in Cardiff (2008) drew record crowds, with over 160,000 visitors attending.\n\nIt was proposed that the [[2018 Cardiff National Eisteddfod|2018 National Eisteddfod in Cardiff]] would use permanent buildings to host events rather than in the traditional [[Maes (eisteddfod)|Maes]] site and tents. This was due partially to a lack of suitable land that could be repaired affordably after the festival. It was billed as an \"Eisteddfod with no fence\" in the media and was held at Cardiff Bay.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://eisteddfod.wales/2018-eisteddfod/2018-eisteddfod |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801233456/https://eisteddfod.wales/2018-eisteddfod/2018-eisteddfod |archivedate=2017-08-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Eryl Crump |url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/hundreds-parade-2018-national-eisteddfod-13235195 |title=Hundreds parade for 2018 National Eisteddfod proclamation |publisher=Daily Post |date=2017-06-25 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Huw |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-33813043 |title=National Eisteddfod considers ditching the Maes in 2018 |publisher=BBC News |date=2015-08-07 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref> The 2019 Eisteddfod in [[Llanrwst]] returned to the traditional [[Maes (eisteddfod)|Maes]].\n\n===Attendance===\n(''incomplete'')\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!year\n!total attendance\n!profit/loss\n|-\n| 2002\n| 144,220\n| -\n|-\n| 2003\n| 176,402\n|\n|-\n| 2004\n| 147,785\n| -\n|-\n| 2005\n| 157,820\n| -\n|-\n| 2006\n| 155,437\n| +\u00a3100,000\n|-\n|2007\n|154,944<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/6944617.stm|title=Traders count cost of Eisteddfod|date=2007-08-13|access-date=2017-11-25|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n| +\u00a34,324<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/eisteddfod-work-pays-4000-profit-2824338|title=Eisteddfod work pays off with \u00a34,000 profit|last=Post|first=North Wales Daily|date=2008-07-01|work=northwales|access-date=2017-11-23}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2008\n| 156,697\n| +\u00a338,000<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/eisteddfod-needs-more-cash-ahead-2791717|title=Eisteddfod needs more cash ahead of Bala event|last=Post|first=North Wales Daily|date=2009-04-20|work=northwales|access-date=2017-11-23}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2009\n| 164,689\n|  +\u00a3145,000<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/national-eisteddfod-wrexham-makes-90k-2680162|title=National Eisteddfod in Wrexham makes \u00a390k loss|last=Crump|first=Eryl|date=2011-11-28|website=northwales|access-date=2019-08-10}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2010\n| 136,933<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/eisteddfod_2010/8320455.EISTEDDFOD__Festival____raised_valleys____profile___/ |title=EISTEDDFOD: Festival 'raised valleys' profile' |publisher=South Wales Argus |date=2010-08-09 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref>\n|  -\u00a347,000<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n| 2011\n| 148,892<ref name=\"walesonline1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/national-eisteddfod-2015-results-friday-9815399 |title=National Eisteddfod 2015: The results from Friday |publisher=Wales Online |date=2015-08-07 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref> \n|  -\u00a390,000<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n| 2012\n| 138,767<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.valeofglamorgan.gov.uk/en/our_council/Council-Structure/minutes,_agendas_and_reports/reports/scrutiny_ee/2012/12-11-06/national_eisteddfod.aspx |title=National Eisteddfod |publisher=Valeofglamorgan.gov.uk |date=2012-12-11 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref>\n| +\u00a350,000\n|-\n| 2013\n| 153,704<ref name=\"walesonline1\"/> \n| +\u00a376,000\n|-\n| 2014\n|143,502\n| +\u00a390,000\n|-\n|2015\n|150,776\n|<nowiki>+\u00a354,721</nowiki><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/national-eisteddfods-iconic-pink-pavilion-10517410|title=National Eisteddfod's iconic pink pavilion to be replaced|last=Crump|first=Eryl|date=2015-11-28|website=northwales|access-date=2019-08-10}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2016\n| 140,229\n| +\u00a36,000<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/national-eisteddfod-2016-cultural-financial-12233637|title=National Eisteddfod 2016 was a 'cultural and financial success'|last=Crump|first=Eryl|date=2016-11-26|work=northwales|access-date=2017-11-23}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2017\n| 147,498\n| +\u00a393,200<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-42122512|title=National Eisteddfod 2019 in Llanrwst|date=2017-11-25|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-25|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2018\n| ~500,000\n| -\u00a3290,000<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46327940 |title=National Eisteddfod 2019 in Llanrwst|date=2018-11-24 |work=BBC News|access-date=2019-08-04|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2019\n| 150,000\n| -\u00a3158,982<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46327940 |title=The reason why National Eisteddfod 2019 made loss of more than \u00a3150,000 |date=2019-11-23 |work=North Wales Live|access-date=2020-04-02|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n|}\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Cymru, Glynebwy, 1958.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Chairing of the Bard|chairing]] ceremony of the 1958 National Eisteddfod; the victorious poet was [[T.

(Mold, 2007)]]\n[[File:Y Lle Celf.JPG|thumb|250px|'[[Y Lle Celf]]' (Blaenau Gwent, 2010)]]\nThe National Eisteddfod is traditionally held in the first week of August, and the competitions are all held in the [[Welsh language]]. However, settings of the [[Mass (music)|mass]] in Latin are allowed and this has been controversially used to allow concerts featuring international soloists.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rhodri Clark |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/eisteddfod-latin-in-language-loophole-2198426 |title=Eisteddfod Latin in language loophole |publisher=Wales Online |date=2008-02-26 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref>\n\nThe venue is officially proclaimed a year in advance, at which time the themes and texts for the competitions are published. The organisation for the location will have begun a year or more earlier, and locations are generally known two or three years ahead. The [[Eisteddfod Act]] of 1959 allowed local authorities to give financial support to the event. Traditionally the Eisteddfod venue alternates between north and south Wales; the decision to hold both the 2014 and 2015 Eisteddfodau in South Wales was thus seen as controversial,<ref name=autogenerated1 /> but the decision was later reversed and Montgomeryshire named as host county for 2015.<ref name=autogenerated2>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/eisteddfod/2011/sites/news/pages/eisteddfod_2016.shtml Site for the Eisteddfod until 2016] at BBC Wales, 8 July 2010</ref> Occasionally the Eisteddfod has been held in England, although the last occasion was in 1929.<ref name=\"venues-list\" />\n\nHundreds of tents, pavilions and booths are erected in an open space to create the ''[[Maes (eisteddfod)|Maes]]'' (field). The space required for this means that it is rare for the Eisteddfod to be in a city or town: instead it is held somewhere with more space. Car parking for day visitors alone requires several large fields, and many people camp on the site for the whole week.\n\nThe festival has a quasi-[[Gorsedd|druidic]] flavour, with the main literary prizes for poetry and prose being awarded in colourful and dramatic ceremonies under the auspices of the [[Gorsedd]] of Bards of the Island of Britain, complete with prominent figures in Welsh cultural life dressed in flowing druidic costumes, flower dances, trumpet fanfares and a symbolic [[cornucopia|Horn of Plenty]]. However, the [[Gorsedd]] is not an ancient institution or a pagan ceremony but rather a romantic creation by [[Iolo Morganwg]] in the 1790s, which first became a formal part of the Eisteddfod ceremonial in 1819.<ref name=\"museum1\"/> Nevertheless, it is taken very seriously, and an award of a crown or a chair for poetry is a great honour. The [[Chairing of the Bard|Chairing]] and [[Crowning of the Bard|Crowning]] ceremonies are the highlights of the week, and are presided over by the [[Archdruid]]. Other important awards include the {{illm|Prose Medal|cy|Medal Ryddiaith}} (first introduced in 1937).\n\nIf no stone circle is there already, one is created out of [[Gorsedd stones]], usually taken from the local area. These stone circles are icons all across Wales and signify the Eisteddfod having visited a community. As a cost-saving measure, the 2005 Eisteddfod was the first to use a temporary \"fibre-glass stone\" circle for the druidic ceremonies instead of a permanent stone circle. This also has the benefit of bringing the Gorsedd ceremonies onto the ''maes'': previously they were often held many miles away, hidden from most of the public. \n \nAs well as the main pavilion with the main stage, there are other venues through the week. Some are fixtures every year, hosting gigs (Maes B/Llwyfan y Maes/Caffi Maes B). Other fixtures of the ''maes'' are the ''Pabell L\u00ean'' (literature pavilion), the ''Neuadd Ddawns'' (dance hall), the ''Pabell Wyddoniaeth a Thechnoleg'' (science and technology pavilion), ''Maes D'' (learners' pavilion), at least one theatre, ''Y Cwt Drama'' (the drama hut), ''T\u0177 Gwerin'' (folk house), ''[[Y Lle Celf]]'' (\"the Art Place\") and hundreds of ''stondinau'' (stands and booths) where groups, societies, councils, charities and shops exhibit and sell. Since 2004, alcohol has been sold on the ''maes''; previously there was a no-alcohol policy.\n\n==Poetry awards==\nThe Eisteddfod's most well-known awards are those for poetry.\n===Chairing of the

{"title_page": "Payment", "text_new": "{{short description|Trade of value from one party to another for goods, services, or legal reasons}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=July 2007}}\n{{More footnotes|date=October 2013}}\n{{condense|date=April 2015}}\n}}\n\n\n'''Asiamanism''' \n\nAs the name implies was taken after the a Man called Asiama \n\nA young Ghanaian graduate who could neither speak nor write good......''English''\n\n==Etymology ==\nThe root word \"pay\" in \"payment\" comes from the Latin \"pacare\" (to pacify), from \"pax\", meaning \"peace\". In the Middle Ages, the term began to be used more broadly, to mean \"to pacify one's creditors\". As the Latin word was made part of Old French \"paier\", it retained the meaning \"appease\" but gained the meaning \"to pay\" (as in paying a debt). The Middle English word \"payen\", which came from French, was also used in both ways.<ref>''The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories''. Merriam-Webster Inc., 1991. p. 350.</ref>\n\n== Methods ==\nThere are two types of payment methods; [[Financial transaction|exchanging]] and [[Provision (accounting)|provisioning]]. Exchanging involves the use of [[money]], comprising [[banknote]]s and [[coin]]s. Provisioning involves the transfer of money from one account to another, and involves a third party. [[Credit card]], [[debit card]], [[cheque]], [[Electronic funds transfer|money transfer]]s, and recurring cash or ACH ([[Automated Clearing House]]) disbursements are all electronic payments methods. Electronic payments technologies include [[magnetic stripe card]]s, [[smartcard]]s, [[contactless smart card|contactless cards]], and mobile payments.\n\n== Parties involved ==\nA payment may involve more than two parties. For example, a [[credit card|pre paid card]] transaction usually involves four parties: the purchaser, the seller, the [[issuing bank]] and the [[acquiring bank]]. A cash payment requires at least three parties: the seller, the purchaser and the issuer of the currency. A barter payment requires a minimum of two parties: the purchaser and the seller.\n\n== Providers ==\nThe infrastructure and electronic clearing methods are formed by the [[Payment service provider|payment provider]]. Global credit card payment providers are [[Diners Club]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[American Express]] and [[MasterCard]]. [[Maestro (debit card)|Maestro]] and [[Cirrus (interbank network)|Cirrus]] are international debit card payment providers.\n\n== Interbank ==\nThe ''central bank CB(Ccy)'' of a currency can maintain a '''loro account''' for a bank (which the bank would call a '''[[Nostro and vostro accounts|nostro]]''' account).\n\n=== Direct ===\nA bank ''P'' (the ''payer'') with a central bank nostro can ''pay directly'' to another bank ''R'' (the ''receiver'') which has also a nostro with ''CB(Ccy)'' by instructing the central bank to make a payment of ''N[Ccy]'' (or an amount ''N'' in ''Ccy''). \nThe central bank however will only accept ''P''s payment instruction if the balance ''B'' on P's loro account before the payment is ''B\u2265N''. The payment itself is a booking in the loro accounts of the central bank where P's loro account is debited with ''N'' (it will be ''B-N\u22650'' thereafter) and simultaneously ''R''s loro account is credit with ''N'' (its balance ''C'' will be ''C+N\u22650'' thereafter).\n\nWe denote the payment symbolically with ''[P\u2192CB\u2192R]''.\n\n=== Indirect ===\nIf the payer ''P'' maintains a loro account for another bank ''X'', ''P'' can act as a payment agent for ''X'':\n''X'' instructs ''P'' to pay to ''R''; then ''P'' instructs ''CB(Ccy)'' to pay on behalf of ''X'': [''X\u2192P\u2192CB\u2192R''].\n\nIn this example the first half of the payment is ''indirect'' and the second one (from ''CB(Ccy)'' to ''R'') is still ''direct''. If ''X'' would pay via ''P'' to ''R'' and finally to another party ''Y'', the payment would be 'fully indirect': [''X\u2192P\u2192CB\u2192R\u2192Y''].\nIn practice, not every payment agent might have a direct nostro with the central bank, thus rather weird payment constellations can exist, which are hard to describe.\n\n=== Directness coefficient ''(p,q)'' ===\nIf we define '''(p,q)''' where ''p'' is number of parties on the sender side and ''q'' on the receiver side, we can classify the directness of payments.\n\n=== ''S<sub>n</sub>,R<sub>m</sub>'' Description ===\nWe denote with ''S<sub>n</sub>'' the senders and with ''R<sub>m</sub>'' the receivers in a payment process, such that\n\n''R<sub>0</sub>=S<sub>0</sub>=CB<sub>CCY</sub>'' is the central bank of the currency which has 'no' distance (''n=m=0'') to the payment process,\n\n''m,n=1'': the ''direct'' nostro agents of the sender / receiver:  \nS<sub>1</sub> is the ''direct payer''; R<sub>1</sub> is the ''direct receiver'' (or nostro agent)\n\n''m,n=2'': the ''indirect nostro agents'' of the sender / receiver:  \nS<sub>2</sub> is the ''indirect payer''; R<sub>2</sub> is the ''indirect receiver''\n\n''m,n=3'': the ''sender / payer bank'' :  \nS<sub>3</sub> is the ''sender bank''; R<sub>3</sub> is the ''receiver bank''\n\n''m,n=4'': the ''sender / payer'':  \nS<sub>4</sub> is the ''sender (payer)''; R<sub>4</sub> is the ''receiver (payee)''\n\nHere is an (p=q=4) example:\n\n [sender\u2192sender bank \u2192 indirect agent of sender bank \u2192 direct agent of sender bank \u2192 central bank \u2192 direct agent of receiver bank \u2192 indirect agent of receiver bank \u2192 receiver bank \u2192 receiver(payee)]\n\nor\n [S<sub>4</sub> \u2192 S<sub>3</sub> \u2192 S<sub>2</sub> \u2192 S<sub>1</sub> \u2192 S<sub>0</sub>=R<sub>0</sub> \u2192 R<sub>1</sub> \u2192 R<sub>2</sub> \u2192 R<sub>3</sub> \u2192 R<sub>4</sub>]\n\n== Global market ==\nIn 2005, an estimated $40 trillion globally passed through some type of payment system. Roughly $12 trillion of that was transacted through various credit cards, mostly the 21,000 member banks of [[Visa (credit card)|Visa]] and [[MasterCard]].  Processing payments, including the extending of credit, produced close to $500 billion in revenue.<ref>McKinsey and Company, 2006</ref>  In 2012, roughly $377 trillion passed through noncash payment systems.  This led to total account and transaction revenues close to $524 billion.<ref>Boston Consulting Group, [http://www.swift.com/assets/swift_com/documents/products_services/BCG_Global_Payments_Report_2013_Sep_2013.pdf \"Global Payments 2013\"], September 2013</ref>\n\n=== Debit cards ===\nIn the U.S., [[debit card]]s are the fastest growing payment technology. In 2001, debit cards accounted for 9 percent of all purchase transactions, and this is expected to double to 18.82 percent in 2011.<ref>The Nilson Report, Issue 761, April 2002</ref>\n\n=== Cheques ===\n{{Main|Cheque clearing}}\nHistorically, [[cheques]] have been one of the primary means of payment for purchasing goods and services, though its share in the payment mix is falling worldwide. In 2001, in the United States, cheques accounted for 25% of the U.S.-based payment mix; and in 2006, this was projected to fall to 17%.<ref>The Nilson Report</ref>\n\nIn the United States, a cheque as a form of payment can legally be refused for any reason (or no reason).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} A payment by cheque is not a \"payment\" until the cheque has been cashed (i.e., deposited) and cleared by the banking system.\n\n== Timing ==\nThe timing of a payment has legal implication in some situations. For tax purposes, for example, the timing of a payment may determine whether it qualifies as a [[Tax deduction|deduction]] in a taxpayer's calculation of [[taxable income]] in one year or the next.\n\nFor U.S. tax purposes, [[cash]] payments generally are taken to occur at the time of payment. Payment may also occur when a person transfers property or performs a service to the payee in satisfaction of an obligation.<ref name=\"donaldson\">See Donaldson, Samuel A., Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials, 734 (2nd. Ed. 2007).</ref> A payment by check is normally deemed to occur when the check is delivered, as long as the check is honored on presentation by the payee. This rule also generally applies where the check is not presented to the bank until the next taxable year, and even though the payer could stop payment on the check in the meantime.<ref>''Estate of Spiegel v. Commissioner'', 12 T.C. 524 (1949).</ref>  [[Postdated check]]s, however, are not considered payment when delivered.<ref>''Griffin v. Commissioner,'' 49 T.C. 253 (1967).</ref>  Generally, payments by [[credit card]] take effect at the point of the sale and not when a payer is billed by the credit card company or when the payer pays the credit card company's bill.<ref>Revenue Ruling 78-38, 1978-1 C.B. 67.</ref> A business that reports on an accrual basis, would report income in the year of sale though payment may be received in a subsequent year.\n\nPayment of most fees to government agencies by cheque, if permitted, usually takes effect after a set number of days for [[Cheque clearing|clearance]] or until the cheque is actually cleared. Payments by credit card, if permitted, and cash payments take immediate effect. Normally, no other forms of payment are permitted or accepted.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Accounting]]\n* [[Alternative Payments]]\n* [[APACS]] (The UK Payments Association)\n* [[Business]]\n* [[Commerce]]\n* [[Financial transaction]] \n* [[Money]]\n* [[Money transmitter]]\n* [[Trade]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*finn.

The party making a payment is commonly called the '''payer''', while the '''payee''' is the party receiving the payment.\n\nPayments can be effected in a number of ways, for example: \n* the use of [[money]], [[cheque]], or [[Direct debit|debit]], [[Credit (finance)|credit]] or [[bank transfer]]s. \n* the transfer of anything of value, such as [[stock]], or using [[barter]], the exchange of one good or service for another. \n\nIn general, the payee is at liberty to determine what method of payment he or she will accept; though normally laws require the payer to accept the country's [[legal tender]] up to a prescribed limit. Payment is most commonly effected in the local currency of the payee, unless if the parties agree otherwise. Payment in another currency involves an additional [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] transaction. The payee may [[compromise]] on a debt, i.e., accept a part payment in full settlement of a debtor's obligation, or may offer a discount, E.G: For payment in cash, or for prompt payment, etc. On the other hand, the payee may impose a [[Surcharge (payment systems)|surcharge]], for example, as a late payment fee, or for use of a certain credit card, etc.\n\nPayments are frequently preceded by an [[invoice]] or bill, which follow the supply of goods or services, but in some industries (such as travel and hotels) it is becoming common for '''pre-payments''' to be required before the service is performed or provided. In some industries, a '''deposit''' may be required before services are performed, which acts as a part pre-payment or as security to the service provider. In some cases, '''progress payments''' are made in advance, and in some cases '''part payments''' are accepted, which do not extinguish the payer\u2019s legal obligations. The acceptance of a payment by the payee extinguishes a debt or other obligation. A [[creditor]] cannot unreasonably refuse to accept a payment, but payment can be refused in some circumstances, for example, on a Sunday or outside banking hours. A payee is usually obligated to acknowledge payment by producing a [[receipt]] to the payer. A receipt may be an endorsement on an account as \"paid in full\". The giving of a guarantee or other security for a debt does not constitute a payment.\n\n==Etymology ==\nThe root word \"pay\" in \"payment\" comes from the Latin \"pacare\" (to pacify), from \"pax\", meaning \"peace\". In the Middle Ages, the term began to be used more broadly, to mean \"to pacify one's creditors\". As the Latin word was made part of Old French \"paier\", it retained the meaning \"appease\" but gained the meaning \"to pay\" (as in paying a debt). The Middle English word \"payen\", which came from French, was also used in both ways.<ref>''The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories''. Merriam-Webster Inc., 1991. p. 350.</ref>\n\n== Methods ==\nThere are two types of payment methods; [[Financial transaction|exchanging]] and [[Provision (accounting)|provisioning]]. Exchanging involves the use of [[money]], comprising [[banknote]]s and [[coin]]s. Provisioning involves the transfer of money from one account to another, and involves a third party. [[Credit card]], [[debit card]], [[cheque]], [[Electronic funds transfer|money transfer]]s, and recurring cash or ACH ([[Automated Clearing House]]) disbursements are all electronic payments methods. Electronic payments technologies include [[magnetic stripe card]]s, [[smartcard]]s, [[contactless smart card|contactless cards]], and mobile payments.\n\n== Parties involved ==\nA payment may involve more than two parties. For example, a [[credit card|pre paid card]] transaction usually involves four parties: the purchaser, the seller, the [[issuing bank]] and the [[acquiring bank]]. A cash payment requires at least three parties: the seller, the purchaser and the issuer of the currency. A barter payment requires a minimum of two parties: the purchaser and the seller.\n\n== Providers ==\nThe infrastructure and electronic clearing methods are formed by the [[Payment service provider|payment provider]]. Global credit card payment providers are [[Diners Club]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[American Express]] and [[MasterCard]]. [[Maestro (debit card)|Maestro]] and [[Cirrus (interbank network)|Cirrus]] are international debit card payment providers.\n\n== Interbank ==\nThe ''central bank CB(Ccy)'' of a currency can maintain a '''loro account''' for a bank (which the bank would call a '''[[Nostro and vostro accounts|nostro]]''' account).\n\n=== Direct ===\nA bank ''P'' (the ''payer'') with a central bank nostro can ''pay directly'' to another bank ''R'' (the ''receiver'') which has also a nostro with ''CB(Ccy)'' by instructing the central bank to make a payment of ''N[Ccy]'' (or an amount ''N'' in ''Ccy''). \nThe central bank however will only accept ''P''s payment instruction if the balance ''B'' on P's loro account before the payment is ''B\u2265N''. The payment itself is a booking in the loro accounts of the central bank where P's loro account is debited with ''N'' (it will be ''B-N\u22650'' thereafter) and simultaneously ''R''s loro account is credit with ''N'' (its balance ''C'' will be ''C+N\u22650'' thereafter).\n\nWe denote the payment symbolically with ''[P\u2192CB\u2192R]''.\n\n=== Indirect ===\nIf the payer ''P'' maintains a loro account for another bank ''X'', ''P'' can act as a payment agent for ''X'':\n''X'' instructs ''P'' to pay to ''R''; then ''P'' instructs ''CB(Ccy)'' to pay on behalf of ''X'': [''X\u2192P\u2192CB\u2192R''].\n\nIn this example the first half of the payment is ''indirect'' and the second one (from ''CB(Ccy)'' to ''R'') is still ''direct''. If ''X'' would pay via ''P'' to ''R'' and finally to another party ''Y'', the payment would be 'fully indirect': [''X\u2192P\u2192CB\u2192R\u2192Y''].\nIn practice, not every payment agent might have a direct nostro with the central bank, thus rather weird payment constellations can exist, which are hard to describe.\n\n=== Directness coefficient ''(p,q)'' ===\nIf we define '''(p,q)''' where ''p'' is number of parties on the sender side and ''q'' on the receiver side, we can classify the directness of payments.\n\n=== ''S<sub>n</sub>,R<sub>m</sub>'' Description ===\nWe denote with ''S<sub>n</sub>'' the senders and with ''R<sub>m</sub>'' the receivers in a payment process, such that\n\n''R<sub>0</sub>=S<sub>0</sub>=CB<sub>CCY</sub>'' is the central bank of the currency which has 'no' distance (''n=m=0'') to the payment process,\n\n''m,n=1'': the ''direct'' nostro agents of the sender / receiver:  \nS<sub>1</sub> is the ''direct payer''; R<sub>1</sub> is the ''direct receiver'' (or nostro agent)\n\n''m,n=2'': the ''indirect nostro agents'' of the sender / receiver:  \nS<sub>2</sub> is the ''indirect payer''; R<sub>2</sub> is the ''indirect receiver''\n\n''m,n=3'': the ''sender / payer bank'' :  \nS<sub>3</sub> is the ''sender bank''; R<sub>3</sub> is the ''receiver bank''\n\n''m,n=4'': the ''sender / payer'':  \nS<sub>4</sub> is the ''sender (payer)''; R<sub>4</sub> is the ''receiver (payee)''\n\nHere is an (p=q=4) example:\n\n [sender\u2192sender bank \u2192 indirect agent of sender bank \u2192 direct agent of sender bank \u2192 central bank \u2192 direct agent of receiver bank \u2192 indirect agent of receiver bank \u2192 receiver bank \u2192 receiver(payee)]\n\nor\n [S<sub>4</sub> \u2192 S<sub>3</sub> \u2192 S<sub>2</sub> \u2192 S<sub>1</sub> \u2192 S<sub>0</sub>=R<sub>0</sub> \u2192 R<sub>1</sub> \u2192 R<sub>2</sub> \u2192 R<sub>3</sub> \u2192 R<sub>4</sub>]\n\n== Global market ==\nIn 2005, an estimated $40 trillion globally passed through some type of payment system. Roughly $12 trillion of that was transacted through various credit cards, mostly the 21,000 member banks of [[Visa (credit card)|Visa]] and [[MasterCard]].  Processing payments, including the extending of credit, produced close to $500 billion in revenue.<ref>McKinsey and Company, 2006</ref>  In 2012, roughly $377 trillion passed through noncash payment systems.  This led to total account and transaction revenues close to $524 billion.<ref>Boston Consulting Group, [http://www.swift.com/assets/swift_com/documents/products_services/BCG_Global_Payments_Report_2013_Sep_2013.pdf \"Global Payments 2013\"], September 2013</ref>\n\n=== Debit cards ===\nIn the U.S., [[debit card]]s are the fastest growing payment technology. In 2001, debit cards accounted for 9 percent of all purchase transactions, and this is expected to double to 18.82 percent in 2011.<ref>The Nilson Report, Issue 761, April 2002</ref>\n\n=== Cheques ===\n{{Main|Cheque clearing}}\nHistorically, [[cheques]] have been one of the primary means of payment for purchasing goods and services, though its share in the payment mix is falling worldwide. In 2001, in the United States, cheques accounted for 25% of the U.S.-based payment mix; and in 2006, this was projected to fall to 17%.<ref>The Nilson Report</ref>\n\nIn the United States, a cheque as a form of payment can legally be refused for any reason (or no reason).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} A payment by cheque is not a \"payment\" until the cheque has been cashed (i.e., deposited) and cleared by the banking system.\n\n== Timing ==\nThe timing of a payment has legal implication in some situations. For tax purposes, for example, the timing of a payment may determine whether it qualifies as a [[Tax deduction|deduction]] in a taxpayer's calculation of [[taxable income]] in one year or the next.\n\nFor U.S. tax purposes, [[cash]] payments generally are taken to occur at the time of payment. Payment may also occur when a person transfers property or performs a service to the payee in satisfaction of an obligation.<ref name=\"donaldson\">See Donaldson, Samuel A., Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials, 734 (2nd. Ed. 2007).</ref> A payment by check is normally deemed to occur when the check is delivered, as long as the check is honored on presentation by the payee. This rule also generally applies where the check is not presented to the bank until the next taxable year, and even though the payer could stop payment on the check in the meantime.<ref>''Estate of Spiegel v. Commissioner'', 12 T.C. 524 (1949).</ref>  [[Postdated check]]s, however, are not considered payment when delivered.<ref>''Griffin v. Commissioner,'' 49 T.C. 253 (1967).</ref>  Generally, payments by [[credit card]] take effect at the point of the sale and not when a payer is billed by the credit card company or when the payer pays the credit card company's bill.<ref>Revenue Ruling 78-38, 1978-1 C.B. 67.</ref> A business that reports on an accrual basis, would report income in the year of sale though payment may be received in a subsequent year.\n\nPayment of most fees to government agencies by cheque, if permitted, usually takes effect after a set number of days for [[Cheque clearing|clearance]] or until the cheque is actually cleared. Payments by credit card, if permitted, and cash payments take immediate effect. Normally, no other forms of payment are permitted or accepted.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Accounting]]\n* [[Alternative Payments]]\n* [[APACS]] (The UK Payments Association)\n* [[Business]]\n* [[Commerce]]\n* [[Financial transaction]] \n* [[Money]]\n* [[Money transmitter]]\n* [[Trade]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*finn.

Their objective was to control a province that was known to be a Taliban stronghold, and a center of [[opium]] production.<ref name=\"Gall/Wafa-NYT\">{{cite news |first=Carlotta |last=Gall |authorlink=Carlotta Gall|author2=Abdul Waheed Wafa |title=Taliban Truce in District of Afghanistan Sets Off Debate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/02/world/asia/02afghan.html |work=The New York Times |date=December 2, 2006 |accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref>\n\nThe deployment of international, mostly [[United Kingdom|British]], forces was part of the stage three expansion of the ISAF mandate, to cover the southern regions of Afghanistan. Until then Helmand province had seen only a limited coalition presence.\n\nIn the spring of 2008, a battalion of U.S. Marines arrived to reinforce the British presence. In the spring of 2009, 11,000 additional Marines poured into the province, the first wave of President Obama's 21,000 troop surge into Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203771904574179672963946120|title=Stalemate in Afghanistan|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=2009-05-23|accessdate=2009-07-04 |first=Michael M. |last=Phillips}}</ref>\n\nOn June 19, 2009, the British Army (with ISAF and ANA forces) launched [[Operation Panther's Claw]] and on July 2, 2009, US Marines launched [[Operation Khanjar]], both major offensives into the province in hopes of securing the region before the [[2009 Afghanistan presidential election|Afghanistan presidential elections]] and turning the tide of the insurgency there.\n\n==Prelude==\nIn 2006, a revitalised Taliban conducted a number of large-scale military offensives against coalition troops in Helmand, Kandahar and other provinces on the border with [[Pakistan]].\n\nIn Helmand, the Afghan government only had a tenuous hold outside the provincial capital of [[Lashkar Gah]]. The [[NATO]] presence in the province was sparse, limited to 130 American soldiers undertaking punctual anti-terrorist missions, as part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]]. Through the month of April, a new British unit, the Helmand [[Task Force]], was deployed in order to counter the Taliban. The core of the fighting force was drawn from the [[16th Air Assault Brigade]], and in particular from the 3rd battalion, of the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]]. Based at [[Camp Bastion]], then under construction, the task force numbered 3,300 men, though only a third of these were combat troops.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bishop |first=Patrick |title=3 Para |year=2007 |publisher=[[HarperCollins|HarperPress]] |isbn=978-0-00-725778-2 |page=50}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first four months of its presence in Afghanistan, the Helmand Task Force was expected to take part in Operation Enduring Freedom, and help track down Taliban and Al Qaeda extremists. It was thus placed under the command of U.S. [[Major General]] Benjamin Freakley, commander of the [[Combined Joint Task Force 76]]. But being part of ISAF, it was also answerable to the ISAF Regional Command South, then led by a Canadian, [[Brigadier General]] [[David Fraser (Canadian)|David Fraser]].<ref>Bishop p.45</ref> This tangled chain of command was accompanied by a certain difficulty in defining the priority between two different and sometimes contradictory missions: either to win the support of the local population, or to fight and eliminate the Taliban.<ref name=\"Walsh1\">{{cite news |first=Declan |last=Walsh |title=Taliban resurgence tests British will |url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2006/07/20/taliban_resurgence_tests_british_will/?page=2 |work=The Boston Globe|date=July 20, 2006 |accessdate=2007-11-28}}</ref>\n\n==Outposts under siege==\nThe initial mission of the Helmand Task Force was to carry out reconstruction and hearts and minds projects in the relatively safe area known as \"the triangle\", centered around Lashkar Gah and [[Gereshk]]. However, the intensification of Taliban attacks led to a dramatic change in this strategy. In early spring 2006, [[Baghran District]] fell temporarily under insurgent control, and on May 18, a Taliban raid in [[Musa Qala]] killed some twenty Afghan policemen.<ref>Bishop, p. 52</ref>\n\nThe possibility of a Taliban offensive sweeping over the entire province was taken seriously by the provincial governor, [[Engineer Mohammad Daoud|Mohammad Daoud]], a personal ally and appointee of [[President of Afghanistan|President]] [[Hamid Karzai]]. Daoud insisted that ISAF troops be deployed in the districts that were under immediate threat of Taliban attack: [[Sangin]], [[Nawzad (village)|Now Zad]], Musa Qala and the strategic [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] installations at [[Kajaki]]. This was the beginning of the controversial \"platoon house\" strategy, that saw NATO troops, mostly British, tied down in remote outstations across northern Helmand. All posts attracted sustained and intensive Taliban attacks, and remained under siege for long periods. The Task Force's limited assets became dangerously stretched, leading to difficult situations in several cases.\n\n===Sangin===\n{{Main|Siege of Sangin}}\nThe town of Sangin (population 30,000), is an important trading center of southern Afghanistan, and  is believed to be the biggest opium market in the region.<ref>\n{{cite news |first=Pierre-Arnaud|last=Chouvy |title=Opiate smuggling routes from Afghanistan to Europe and Asia|url=http://www.geopium.org/JIR3.htm|publisher=Geopium.org|date=October 14, 2006 |accessdate=2007-07-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031209061113/http://www.pa-chouvy.org/JIR3.htm |archivedate=2003-12-09}}</ref> Thus it naturally became an important objective both for the Taliban and the coalition.

However, after a personal intervention by Hamid Karzai, they were ordered to remain in Sangin, in order to assert the faltering authority of the central government.<ref>Bishop, p. 110</ref>\n[[File:M777 Howitzer Helmand April2007.JPEG|thumb|Canadian [[M777 howitzer]] firing at Taliban positions in Sangin.]]\nAt first, the situation inside the town remained calm, but this changed after June 27, after a failed special forces raid in the Sangin area, during which two British soldiers were killed. On June 30, the insurgents launched their first frontal attacks on the district centre, garrisoned by British troops. The attackers were driven off, after having lost at least twelve killed.<ref>Bishop, p. 120</ref> Despite this, the Taliban did not relent, and renewed their attacks every night, using small arms, [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPGs]], and 107&nbsp;mm rockets. The British answered with machine guns, mortars and [[FGM-148 Javelin|Javelin missiles]], and by calling in artillery and airstrikes. Resupply was sometimes interrupted for as long as five days, as Taliban fire would have put the helicopters at risk.\n\nOn July 15, as part of [[Operation Mountain Thrust]] coalition forces conducted an offensive into Sangin district, supported by armour, in the shape of light tanks of the [[Household Cavalry Regiment]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] [[LAV III]]s. In the face of overwhelming force, most of the Taliban retreated, and a supply convoy was escorted into the town. The garrison were able to strengthen their defenses after the arrival of an engineer unit.\n\nAfter September 14, the fighting died down in Sangin. On September 21, the paratroopers occupying the government compound were replaced by a unit from [[42 Commando]], [[Royal Marines]]. In March 2007, the Marines were in turn replaced by a company from the [[2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]. By this time, the Taliban had resumed their operations in the sector, and the fusiliers were attacked 79 times during their first twenty days in Sangin.<ref name=\"Walsh 2007\">{{cite news|first=Declan|last=Walsh|title=Relief at last for hard-pressed Fusiliers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/afghanistan/story/0,,2054222,00.html|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=April 11, 2007 |accessdate=2007-07-31 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nOn April 5, 2007, coalition forces launched [[Operation Silver (2007)|Operation Silver]], as part of the wider [[Operation Achilles]], with some 1,000 troops.

Serving also as a prison and police station, the district centre was situated in the middle of the town, a situation that greatly hampered the defenders.

The first heavy Taliban attack was launched on July 16, and though it was repelled with heavy loss, the insurgents maintained a constant pressure on the district centre. On July 26, the [[Denmark|Danish]] 1 Light [[Reconnaissance]] Squadron, known as \"the [[griffin]]s\", arrived at Musa Qala to relieve the British troops. However, these could not be extracted until August 8, when a full [[Battlegroup (army)|battle group]] operation, codenamed Operation Snakebite, was required to reach the town centre. The griffins were equipped with 16 [[MOWAG Eagle|Eagle]] armoured vehicles, one lost during the fight to get in the town, most armed with a [[M2 Browning machine gun|.50 calibre machine-gun]]. Their commander built a series of ramps enabling the vehicles to fire over the compound walls. With the support of a mortar team from the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment]] and abundant air support, the Musa Qala garrison was able to drive back all attacks, but the presence of large numbers of Taliban prevented them from venturing out of the base. On the 24 August, the Danish unit were extracted and assigned to the Canadian-led Op Medusa, the Danes were replaced by a mixed British detachment of paratroopers and Royal Irish rangers, whose weapons array was considerably less powerful, having only two .50 cal and eight [[L7 (machine gun)|GPMG]] machine-guns. Knowing the garrison was weaker, the Taliban launched two attacks with a group of 150 men on August 26/27. Both were driven off, after which the insurgents concentrated on indirect attacks with mortars and 107&nbsp;mm rockets.\n\nBy the end of September, the fighting in Musa Qala had come to a stalemate. The Taliban had suffered heavy losses and had been incapable of driving the ISAF forces out of the town.

Through early 2006, it came under increasing attacks by the Taliban, for whom even a brief occupation would serve as a propaganda victory. The dam was defended by a mixed force of Afghan policemen and security guards led by an American [[Private military company|contractor]]. Nightly Taliban [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] attacks demoralised the defenders, who had no heavy weapons, and were unable to retaliate. In late June, a team of British paratroopers was deployed near Kajaki, and managed to ambush a Taliban mortar team, killing ten and wounding two.<ref name=\"Bishop, p. 98\">Bishop, p. 98</ref> Thereafter, a permanent British military presence was established at the dam, where coalition troops occupied a series of fortified posts built by the Soviets during their [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|presence in Afghanistan]].

More than 4,500 British led ISAF troops were involved, along with 1,000 Afghan personnel. NATO officials reported that, contrary to what happened in previous operations, Taliban fighters were avoiding direct confrontation in favor of guerilla tactics. The main objectives were the strategic points of Northern Helmand, including all major towns, and the Kajaki dam.\n\nA number of sub-operations targeted specific sectors:\n* [[Operation Kryptonite]] (February 12): Some 300 British and Dutch ISAF and ANA troops cleared the area from where the Taliban had mortared the dam in the past months. On February 14, a senior Taliban leader, Mullah Manan, was killed in an airstrike between Kajaki and Musa Qala.\n* Operation Silver (April 5): A 1,000-strong group composed of a heliborne force of U.S. paratroopers from the [[82nd Airborne Division (United States)|82nd Airborne Division]], along with an armoured column of 250 Royal Marines, 100 Dutch air assault troops( Tiger CoY) cleared the town of Sangin, that had been mostly abandoned by the Taliban.\n* Operation Silicon (April 30): This operation was undertaken jointly by 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment (The Vikings) and ANA troops, moving against the Taliban in Gereshk and the lower Sangin valley.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/MilitaryOperations/BritishAndAfghanTroopsLaunchOperationSilicon.htm\n|title=British and Afghan troops launch Operation Silicon |accessdate=2007-12-05 |date=2 May 2007 |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MoD]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508201407/http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/MilitaryOperations/BritishAndAfghanTroopsLaunchOperationSilicon.htm |archivedate=2007-05-08}}</ref>\n\nOn May 12, Mullah [[Dadullah]], second in command of the Taliban, was killed in Gereshk district, in a raid carried out by British [[Special Boat Service|SBS]] commandos and Afghan troops.<ref>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Smith |title=SBS behind Taliban leader\u2019s death |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article1845387.ece |publisher=The Times |date=May 27, 2007 |accessdate=2007-12-05 |location=London}}</ref> A significant feature of the operation was the end of the siege of Sangin where British troops had been cut off for more than nine months.

NATO stated that their forces cleared Sangin and Gereshk of Taliban and thus secured the [[Kajaki District]]. In contrast, the Taliban claimed that they still control much of Kajaki, and some of the Sangin districts. These claims were confirmed by the local residents, who complain that the Taliban returned as soon as NATO and ANA troops had left.\n\n===Operation Hammer===\n{{Main|Operation Hammer (Afghanistan)}}\nIn late July another operation was started called Operation Hammer. It began in the early hours of July 24, 2007 in the area between Hyderabad and Mirmandab, north-east of Gereshk. The operation continued the momentum towards expelling Taliban forces from areas of the Upper Gereshk Valley in Helmand province. During the initial stages of the operation, ISAF and Afghan National Security Forces advanced to secure a strategic bridge crossing over the Nahr-e-Seraj canal, clearing and searching [[Compound (fortification)|compounds]], before military engineers from 26 Engineer Regiment established a joint forward operating base. Sporadic fighting followed after that. And by early November operations ended with coalition troops establishing a firm frontline south of the Helmand river and were preparing for an attack towards Musa Qalah, which had been under Taliban control for eight months.\n\n===Operation Sledgehammer Hit===\nOperation Palk Wahel (Sledgehammer Hit in Pashto) involved 2,500 troops, of which 2,000 are British, drawn mostly from the 1st battalion, the [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]] and from 2nd Battalion the [[Mercian Regiment]]. During this operation, Warrior IFVs, manned by the [[Scots Guards]], made their first significant operational deployment in Afghanistan.

Its stated aim was the securing of various canal and river crossings and establishing a lasting ISAF presence in an area described by Lt Col Richardson as \"one of the main Taliban strongholds\" ahead of the 2009 Afghan presidential election.\n\n3,000 British, 650 ANA, 700 Danish and 130 Estonians were involved in the operation which has been described as \"one of the largest air operations in modern times\" when, after midnight on June 19, hundreds of British soldiers were transported by 12 Chinooks into Babaji (North of Lashkar Gah) and supported by 13 other aircraft including a US AC-130H Spectre Gunship. They established a firm foothold and more troops moved in to secure the area.\n\nThe offensive claimed the lives of 15 British troops within a week including 8 within 24 hours. This contributed to the bloodiest week for British forces in Afghanistan so far.\n\nThe operation was declared \"a major success\" by British officials. They claimed the offensive secured land for around 100,000 people and started to break the \"chain of terror\" linking Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan to the UK.\n\nHowever the security conditions for the Afghan presidential elections in the region were almost non-existent.

Simultaneously, other Marine elements pushed into remote areas by vehicle convoys. The initial stages of the operation were so sudden that Taliban forces were apparently taken by surprise.

The operation began on December 18, members of the [[Grenadier Guards]] and ATF 444 advanced up from [[Shin Kalay]] in order to 'find and fix' the insurgent defence. The cautious advance revealed major weaknesses in the insurgent command and control: The Taliban commander in the area did not have the capacity to deal with the unfolding battle and was soon overstretched. Taliban logistics also appeared to be weak, as insurgents typically ran out of ammunition after a few hours; the Grenadier Guards found that the insurgents were constantly trying to get them to fire on civilians between the lines of both sides.<ref>Farrell, Theo, ''Unwinnable: Britain\u2019s War in Afghanistan, 2001\u20132014'', Bodley Head, 2017 {{ISBN|1847923461|978-1847923462}}, P.298</ref>\n\nAfter ten days, ISAF launched two simultaneous night-time assaults by helicopter over insurgent front lines and directly onto Taliban strongholds. In the early hours of 28 December, a pair of RAF Chinooks inserted A Company Royal Welsh battlegroup and their ATF 444 partners directly into Noorzoy Kalay, a third Chinook dropped a British and Afghan special operations group onto the Taliban command position near Baluchan. British and Afghan ground forces then moved up to complete the clearing of Noorzoy Kalay and Baluchan, as well as lift the siege of Patrol Base (PB) Pimon; insurgents were caught in a pincer movement as B Company Royal Welsh moved in on Jackal Light Armoured Vehicles. Finally, on 29 December, a company from the Grenadier Guards, operating with ATF 444, cleared the insurgents out of Zorobad.<ref>Farrell, Theo, ''Unwinnable: Britain\u2019s War in Afghanistan, 2001\u20132014'', Bodley Head, 2017 {{ISBN|1847923461|978-1847923462}}, P.298-299</ref>\n\nISAF intelligence had estimated that the villagers in Noorzoy Kalay and Baluchan were giving reluctant support to the Taliban, and so could persuaded to side with the government. Heavy 'messaging' had proceeded the operation to advise local elders that an overwhelming force was on its way to secure Chah-e Mazir. This message was passed on to local Taliban commanders, which had the desired effect: the insurgents retreated in advance of British and Afghan forces and put up only a sporadic resistance. Operation Tor Shpa'h was in effect the dry run for Operation Moshtarak, Task Force Helmand headquarters had deliberately played down the Tor Shpa'h in advance so as to 'avoid the impression that it would be another Panchai Palang.' The operation demonstrated that working through local elders, the Taliban could be coerced into surrendering ground without the necessity for major combat operations.<ref>Farrell, Theo, ''Unwinnable: Britain\u2019s War in Afghanistan, 2001\u20132014'', Bodley Head, 2017 {{ISBN|1847923461|978-1847923462}}, P.299</ref>\n\n==New War Model==\n\n===Operation Moshtarak===\n{{Main|Operation Moshtarak}}\n[[File:1st Battalion 3rd Marines near Marja.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Marines securing the city of Marjah.]]\nOn February 13, 2010, [[Operation Moshtarak]] was an [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) pacification offensive in the town of [[Marjah]], [[Helmand Province]], [[Afghanistan]]. It involved 15,000 American, Afghan, and British troops and constituted the largest joint operation of the War in Afghanistan up to that point and aimed to remove the [[Taliban]] from [[Marjah]] and eliminate the last Taliban stronghold in central Helmand Province.\n\nThe main target of the offensive was the town of Marjah, which had been controlled for years by the Taliban as well as drug traffickers. Although Moshtarak was described as the largest in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban, it was originally supposed to be the prelude to a much larger offensive in Kandahar that would follow Moshtarak by several months. However ISAF chose to heavily publicize the operation before it was launched, comparing its scope and size to the 2004 [[Second Battle of Fallujah]], in the hopes that Taliban fighters in the town would flee. The operation was also designed to showcase improvements in both the Afghan government and Afghan security forces. ISAF claimed that the operation was \"Afghan-led\" would use five Afghan brigades. General [[Stanley A. McChrystal]], the commander of ISAF, also promised that following the offensive ISAF would install a \"government in a box\" in Marjah.<ref>Gal Perl Finkel, [http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_opinion.php?id=14263 Back to the ground?], ''[[Israel Hayom]]'', November 8, 2015.</ref>\n\nAlthough initially successfully, ISAF and the Afghans failed to set up a working government in the town, leading to a successful resurgence by the Taliban; 90 days into the offensive General McChrystal famously referred to it as a \"bleeding ulcer\". In October the town was still described as \"troubling\", but by early December the fighting there was declared \"essentially over\".\n\nThe operation was called \"a key test\" of the coalition strategy against the [[Taliban insurgency]]. Brigadier [[James Cowan (British Army officer)|James Cowan]], the commander of British forces in Helmand, believed it would mark \"the start of the end of this insurgency\". At the very least it would become a test of whether the Afghan forces would be able to make their country peaceful and safe.\n\nThe announcement of the operation was also a part of this strategy: \"shaping the information battlefield strategic communications\", and to ensure it would not repeat the destruction of Fallujah in [[Iraq]] in 2004. Hours before the offensive began, Afghan and coalition forces dropped leaflets with the message, \"Do not allow the Taliban to enter your home\".\nAfter this operation in Helmand province, the neighbouring province and the city of [[Kandahar]] became a target of American operations. In March 2010, U.S. and [[NATO]] commanders released details of plans for the biggest offensive of the war against the Taliban insurgency.\n\nWhen launched, the operation was called a \"new war model\". Afghan and NATO officials had assembled a large team of Afghan administrators and an Afghan governor that would move into [[Marjah]] after the fighting, with more than 1,900 police standing by. \"We've got a government in a box, ready to roll in\", said American commander Stanley McChrystal. The capture of Marjah was intended to serve as a prototype for a new type of military operation. The Afghan government had pledged to hold any territory seized in the Taliban heartland during the assault. Utilities engineers were on hand to ensure power and water supplies were maintained.\n\n==Incidents==\n\n===Helmand province incident===\n{{Main|2007 Helmand province incident}}\nDuring the campaign there were numerous incidents where NATO air strikes resulted in massive casualties for the civilian population. One of the more notable was on June 22, 2007. A NATO air strike killed between 45 and 100 civilians. The Afghan and Pakistan governments condemned the attack blaming both NATO and the Taliban. NATO's reaction to the incident was just that the number of dead was less than 45 and they welcomed an investigation. But they stated that they will not change their tactic of bombing civilian centers because the Taliban use civilians as human shields. By then up to 314 civilians were killed by Coalition troops in contrast to 279 by  insurgents.\n\n===Friendly fire===\nOn August 23, 2007, three British soldiers from the [[Royal Anglian Regiment]] were killed, and two injured, by a U.S. [[F-15 Eagle|F-15]] fighter. <ref>{{cite news |title='Friendly fire' kills UK soldiers |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6962071.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=24 August 2007 |accessdate=2007-11-29 }}</ref>\n\nOn September 26, 2007, two Danish soldiers were killed by a British missile in a \"[[friendly fire]]\" incident.<ref>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Evans |title=Danish soldiers killed by British friendly fire |date=2007-12-19 |work=The Times |url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3070875.ece |accessdate=2008-11-14 |location=London}}</ref> The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Defence]] appointed a [[Public inquiry|board of inquiry]] to investigate the affair.<ref>{{cite news |title=MoD probes 'friendly fire' claim |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7113721.stm |publisher=BBC News|date=26 November 2007 |accessdate=2007-11-29}}</ref>\n\n==Political developments==\nBefore the arrival of ISAF troops, Helmand province was ruled by governor [[Sher Mohammed Akhundzada]].

Until then Helmand province had seen only a limited coalition presence.\n\nIn the spring of 2008, a battalion of U.S. Marines arrived to reinforce the British presence. In the spring of 2009, 11,000 additional Marines poured into the province, the first wave of President Obama's 21,000 troop surge into Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203771904574179672963946120|title=Stalemate in Afghanistan|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=2009-05-23|accessdate=2009-07-04 |first=Michael M. |last=Phillips}}</ref>\n\nOn June 19, 2009, the British Army (with ISAF and ANA forces) launched [[Operation Panther's Claw]] and on July 2, 2009, US Marines launched [[Operation Khanjar]], both major offensives into the province in hopes of securing the region before the [[2009 Afghanistan presidential election|Afghanistan presidential elections]] and turning the tide of the insurgency there.\n\n==Prelude==\nIn 2006, a revitalised Taliban conducted a number of large-scale military offensives against coalition troops in Helmand, Kandahar and other provinces on the border with [[Pakistan]].\n\nIn Helmand, the Afghan government only had a tenuous hold outside the provincial capital of [[Lashkar Gah]]. The [[NATO]] presence in the province was sparse, limited to 130 American soldiers undertaking punctual anti-terrorist missions, as part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]]. Through the month of April, a new British unit, the Helmand [[Task Force]], was deployed in order to counter the Taliban. The core of the fighting force was drawn from the [[16th Air Assault Brigade]], and in particular from the 3rd battalion, of the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]]. Based at [[Camp Bastion]], then under construction, the task force numbered 3,300 men, though only a third of these were combat troops.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bishop |first=Patrick |title=3 Para |year=2007 |publisher=[[HarperCollins|HarperPress]] |isbn=978-0-00-725778-2 |page=50}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first four months of its presence in Afghanistan, the Helmand Task Force was expected to take part in Operation Enduring Freedom, and help track down Taliban and Al Qaeda extremists. It was thus placed under the command of U.S. [[Major General]] Benjamin Freakley, commander of the [[Combined Joint Task Force 76]]. But being part of ISAF, it was also answerable to the ISAF Regional Command South, then led by a Canadian, [[Brigadier General]] [[David Fraser (Canadian)|David Fraser]].<ref>Bishop p.45</ref> This tangled chain of command was accompanied by a certain difficulty in defining the priority between two different and sometimes contradictory missions: either to win the support of the local population, or to fight and eliminate the Taliban.<ref name=\"Walsh1\">{{cite news |first=Declan |last=Walsh |title=Taliban resurgence tests British will |url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2006/07/20/taliban_resurgence_tests_british_will/?page=2 |work=The Boston Globe|date=July 20, 2006 |accessdate=2007-11-28}}</ref>\n\n==Outposts under siege==\nThe initial mission of the Helmand Task Force was to carry out reconstruction and hearts and minds projects in the relatively safe area known as \"the triangle\", centered around Lashkar Gah and [[Gereshk]]. However, the intensification of Taliban attacks led to a dramatic change in this strategy. In early spring 2006, [[Baghran District]] fell temporarily under insurgent control, and on May 18, a Taliban raid in [[Musa Qala]] killed some twenty Afghan policemen.<ref>Bishop, p. 52</ref>\n\nThe possibility of a Taliban offensive sweeping over the entire province was taken seriously by the provincial governor, [[Engineer Mohammad Daoud|Mohammad Daoud]], a personal ally and appointee of [[President of Afghanistan|President]] [[Hamid Karzai]]. Daoud insisted that ISAF troops be deployed in the districts that were under immediate threat of Taliban attack: [[Sangin]], [[Nawzad (village)|Now Zad]], Musa Qala and the strategic [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] installations at [[Kajaki]]. This was the beginning of the controversial \"platoon house\" strategy, that saw NATO troops, mostly British, tied down in remote outstations across northern Helmand. All posts attracted sustained and intensive Taliban attacks, and remained under siege for long periods. The Task Force's limited assets became dangerously stretched, leading to difficult situations in several cases.\n\n===Sangin===\n{{Main|Siege of Sangin}}\nThe town of Sangin (population 30,000), is an important trading center of southern Afghanistan, and  is believed to be the biggest opium market in the region.<ref>\n{{cite news |first=Pierre-Arnaud|last=Chouvy |title=Opiate smuggling routes from Afghanistan to Europe and Asia|url=http://www.geopium.org/JIR3.htm|publisher=Geopium.org|date=October 14, 2006 |accessdate=2007-07-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031209061113/http://www.pa-chouvy.org/JIR3.htm |archivedate=2003-12-09}}</ref> Thus it naturally became an important objective both for the Taliban and the coalition.

On June 30, the insurgents launched their first frontal attacks on the district centre, garrisoned by British troops. The attackers were driven off, after having lost at least twelve killed.<ref>Bishop, p. 120</ref> Despite this, the Taliban did not relent, and renewed their attacks every night, using small arms, [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPGs]], and 107&nbsp;mm rockets. The British answered with machine guns, mortars and [[FGM-148 Javelin|Javelin missiles]], and by calling in artillery and airstrikes. Resupply was sometimes interrupted for as long as five days, as Taliban fire would have put the helicopters at risk.\n\nOn July 15, as part of [[Operation Mountain Thrust]] coalition forces conducted an offensive into Sangin district, supported by armour, in the shape of light tanks of the [[Household Cavalry Regiment]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] [[LAV III]]s. In the face of overwhelming force, most of the Taliban retreated, and a supply convoy was escorted into the town. The garrison were able to strengthen their defenses after the arrival of an engineer unit.\n\nAfter September 14, the fighting died down in Sangin. On September 21, the paratroopers occupying the government compound were replaced by a unit from [[42 Commando]], [[Royal Marines]]. In March 2007, the Marines were in turn replaced by a company from the [[2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]. By this time, the Taliban had resumed their operations in the sector, and the fusiliers were attacked 79 times during their first twenty days in Sangin.<ref name=\"Walsh 2007\">{{cite news|first=Declan|last=Walsh|title=Relief at last for hard-pressed Fusiliers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/afghanistan/story/0,,2054222,00.html|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=April 11, 2007 |accessdate=2007-07-31 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nOn April 5, 2007, coalition forces launched [[Operation Silver (2007)|Operation Silver]], as part of the wider [[Operation Achilles]], with some 1,000 troops.

Serving also as a prison and police station, the district centre was situated in the middle of the town, a situation that greatly hampered the defenders. The garrison consisted of some 80 Afghan policemen, who were more of a [[militia]] than a police force, and were very unpopular among the local population.<ref>Bishop, p. 154</ref>\n\nThe American unit present in Musa Qala was replaced on June 14 by a composite group of British troops, mostly [[Pathfinder Platoon (United Kingdom)|pathfinders]]. The first heavy Taliban attack was launched on July 16, and though it was repelled with heavy loss, the insurgents maintained a constant pressure on the district centre. On July 26, the [[Denmark|Danish]] 1 Light [[Reconnaissance]] Squadron, known as \"the [[griffin]]s\", arrived at Musa Qala to relieve the British troops. However, these could not be extracted until August 8, when a full [[Battlegroup (army)|battle group]] operation, codenamed Operation Snakebite, was required to reach the town centre. The griffins were equipped with 16 [[MOWAG Eagle|Eagle]] armoured vehicles, one lost during the fight to get in the town, most armed with a [[M2 Browning machine gun|.50 calibre machine-gun]]. Their commander built a series of ramps enabling the vehicles to fire over the compound walls. With the support of a mortar team from the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment]] and abundant air support, the Musa Qala garrison was able to drive back all attacks, but the presence of large numbers of Taliban prevented them from venturing out of the base. On the 24 August, the Danish unit were extracted and assigned to the Canadian-led Op Medusa, the Danes were replaced by a mixed British detachment of paratroopers and Royal Irish rangers, whose weapons array was considerably less powerful, having only two .50 cal and eight [[L7 (machine gun)|GPMG]] machine-guns. Knowing the garrison was weaker, the Taliban launched two attacks with a group of 150 men on August 26/27. Both were driven off, after which the insurgents concentrated on indirect attacks with mortars and 107&nbsp;mm rockets.\n\nBy the end of September, the fighting in Musa Qala had come to a stalemate. The Taliban had suffered heavy losses and had been incapable of driving the ISAF forces out of the town. The coalition had also suffered losses: three British soldiers had been killed in Musa Qala,<ref name=\"BBC-KIA\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/629/629/5121552.stm |title=British military fatalities in Afghanistan |accessdate=2007-11-23 |date=15 November 2007 |publisher=BBC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012195803/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/629/629/5121552.stm |archivedate=2007-10-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and their control of the town didn't extend outside the compound walls.<ref>Bishop, p. 235</ref> Also, the British commanders feared that a resupply helicopter might be shot down, giving a propaganda victory to the insurgents.

More than 4,500 British led ISAF troops were involved, along with 1,000 Afghan personnel. NATO officials reported that, contrary to what happened in previous operations, Taliban fighters were avoiding direct confrontation in favor of guerilla tactics. The main objectives were the strategic points of Northern Helmand, including all major towns, and the Kajaki dam.\n\nA number of sub-operations targeted specific sectors:\n* [[Operation Kryptonite]] (February 12): Some 300 British and Dutch ISAF and ANA troops cleared the area from where the Taliban had mortared the dam in the past months. On February 14, a senior Taliban leader, Mullah Manan, was killed in an airstrike between Kajaki and Musa Qala.\n* Operation Silver (April 5): A 1,000-strong group composed of a heliborne force of U.S. paratroopers from the [[82nd Airborne Division (United States)|82nd Airborne Division]], along with an armoured column of 250 Royal Marines, 100 Dutch air assault troops( Tiger CoY) cleared the town of Sangin, that had been mostly abandoned by the Taliban.\n* Operation Silicon (April 30): This operation was undertaken jointly by 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment (The Vikings) and ANA troops, moving against the Taliban in Gereshk and the lower Sangin valley.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/MilitaryOperations/BritishAndAfghanTroopsLaunchOperationSilicon.htm\n|title=British and Afghan troops launch Operation Silicon |accessdate=2007-12-05 |date=2 May 2007 |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MoD]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508201407/http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/MilitaryOperations/BritishAndAfghanTroopsLaunchOperationSilicon.htm |archivedate=2007-05-08}}</ref>\n\nOn May 12, Mullah [[Dadullah]], second in command of the Taliban, was killed in Gereshk district, in a raid carried out by British [[Special Boat Service|SBS]] commandos and Afghan troops.<ref>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Smith |title=SBS behind Taliban leader\u2019s death |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article1845387.ece |publisher=The Times |date=May 27, 2007 |accessdate=2007-12-05 |location=London}}</ref> A significant feature of the operation was the end of the siege of Sangin where British troops had been cut off for more than nine months.

This operation was not as successful as the previous one. At around 4:00 local time on Wednesday, May 30, 2007, ISAF and ANSF personnel advanced towards the village of [[Kajaki Sofle]], ten kilometres south-west of the town of [[Kajaki]], to remove a Taliban force whose presence threatened the security and stability of the Lower [[Sangin|Sangin Valley]].\n\nDuring the night, elements of the American [[82nd Airborne Division]] mounted an aerial assault on a Taliban compound. One of the [[CH-47 Chinook|Chinook]] helicopters taking part in the raid was apparently hit by an [[RPG-7|RPG]] round and crashed, killing five Americans, a Briton and a Canadian on board.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/7-killed-in-afghan-helicopter-crash/|title=7 Killed In Afghan Helicopter Crash|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en}}</ref> Lastay Kulang ended on June 14, with the strategic outcome unclear. NATO stated that their forces cleared Sangin and Gereshk of Taliban and thus secured the [[Kajaki District]]. In contrast, the Taliban claimed that they still control much of Kajaki, and some of the Sangin districts. These claims were confirmed by the local residents, who complain that the Taliban returned as soon as NATO and ANA troops had left.\n\n===Operation Hammer===\n{{Main|Operation Hammer (Afghanistan)}}\nIn late July another operation was started called Operation Hammer. It began in the early hours of July 24, 2007 in the area between Hyderabad and Mirmandab, north-east of Gereshk. The operation continued the momentum towards expelling Taliban forces from areas of the Upper Gereshk Valley in Helmand province. During the initial stages of the operation, ISAF and Afghan National Security Forces advanced to secure a strategic bridge crossing over the Nahr-e-Seraj canal, clearing and searching [[Compound (fortification)|compounds]], before military engineers from 26 Engineer Regiment established a joint forward operating base. Sporadic fighting followed after that. And by early November operations ended with coalition troops establishing a firm frontline south of the Helmand river and were preparing for an attack towards Musa Qalah, which had been under Taliban control for eight months.\n\n===Operation Sledgehammer Hit===\nOperation Palk Wahel (Sledgehammer Hit in Pashto) involved 2,500 troops, of which 2,000 are British, drawn mostly from the 1st battalion, the [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]] and from 2nd Battalion the [[Mercian Regiment]]. During this operation, Warrior IFVs, manned by the [[Scots Guards]], made their first significant operational deployment in Afghanistan. Most of the remaining 500 men came from the Afghan National Army, while small contingents from Danish, [[Czech Republic|Czech]] and American forces also participated.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/MilitaryOperations/InPicturesWarriorDebutsInHelmandOffensive.htm|title=Warrior debuts in Helmand offensive |accessdate=2007-12-03 |date=21 September 2007 |publisher=MoD |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009153624/http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/MilitaryOperations/InPicturesWarriorDebutsInHelmandOffensive.htm |archivedate=2007-10-09}}</ref>\n\nThe objective of the operation was to dislodge the Taliban insurgents from their strongholds in the upper Gereshk valley.\n\nThe operation began on September 19, when the Scots Guards engineers threw a bridge over the Helmand river.

Initially the British and Afghan forces attacked in the afternoon, from three directions. Several hundred US troops were later dropped from helicopters and fought on foot through the night. The Taliban defences included hundreds of mines and it was reported that the morale among the Taliban forces was high. Up to 2,000 Taliban fighters were confirmed to be in the town.

Its stated aim was the securing of various canal and river crossings and establishing a lasting ISAF presence in an area described by Lt Col Richardson as \"one of the main Taliban strongholds\" ahead of the 2009 Afghan presidential election.\n\n3,000 British, 650 ANA, 700 Danish and 130 Estonians were involved in the operation which has been described as \"one of the largest air operations in modern times\" when, after midnight on June 19, hundreds of British soldiers were transported by 12 Chinooks into Babaji (North of Lashkar Gah) and supported by 13 other aircraft including a US AC-130H Spectre Gunship. They established a firm foothold and more troops moved in to secure the area.\n\nThe offensive claimed the lives of 15 British troops within a week including 8 within 24 hours. This contributed to the bloodiest week for British forces in Afghanistan so far.\n\nThe operation was declared \"a major success\" by British officials. They claimed the offensive secured land for around 100,000 people and started to break the \"chain of terror\" linking Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan to the UK.\n\nHowever the security conditions for the Afghan presidential elections in the region were almost non-existent. In the Babaji area alone only 150 people came out to vote.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6094583/UK-suffered-one-casualty-in-Afghanistan-for-every-vote.html# |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=UK suffered one casualty in Afghanistan for every vote |first=Thomas |last=Harding |date=2009-08-26 |accessdate=2010-05-04}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/32569911 Analysis: Afghan summer brings reversals - World news - South and Central Asia - Afghanistan | NBC News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Operation Khanjar===\n{{Main|Operation Khanjar}}\nOn July 2, 2009, U.S. Marines, simultaneously with the British, launched a massive offensive, dubbed [[Operation Khanjar]], in hopes of securing the province for the [[2009 Afghanistan presidential election|Afghanistan presidential elections]] coming up, as well as turning the tide of the insurgency. In the months preceding the operation, 11,000 U.S. Marines had poured into the province as part of President Obama's troop surge.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=7780761|title=US Marines Fan out Across Dangerous Afghan South|publisher=ABC News|date=2009-06-08|accessdate=2009-07-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610055639/http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=7780761 |archivedate=2009-06-10}}</ref>\n\nUsing helicopters, Marines landed behind Taliban lines into areas where coalition forces had never been before. Simultaneously, other Marine elements pushed into remote areas by vehicle convoys. The initial stages of the operation were so sudden that Taliban forces were apparently taken by surprise. Their spokesman was quoted saying that he could not believe that the US had deployed so many troops, \"I consider it a part of a psychological war,\" but vowed the Americans would still lose.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8129789.stm|title=US opens 'major Afghan offensive'|publisher=BBC News|date=2009-07-02|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref>\n\nMarine units have now begun moving into the southern reaches of the Helmand River Valley, supported by fighter aircraft.\n\n====Battle of Dahaneh====\n{{Main|Battle of Dahaneh}}\nDuring operation Khanjar, U.S. Marines took back the town of Dahaneh from Taliban forces after it was under insurgent control for four years. During the battle one Marine and around 20 insurgents were killed. It took Coalition forces three days to secure the town during which heavy street fighting occurred.\n\n===Operation Tor Shpa'h===\nThe operation was to last four weeks and involve 450 British troops, 100 Afghan soldiers and police, and two long patrols from Afghan Task Force (ATF) 444-the Afghan special operations group for Helmand Province, mentoring and working alongside AFT 444 patrols was a company from the British [[Special Forces Support Group|SFSG]]. The operation began on December 18, members of the [[Grenadier Guards]] and ATF 444 advanced up from [[Shin Kalay]] in order to 'find and fix' the insurgent defence. The cautious advance revealed major weaknesses in the insurgent command and control: The Taliban commander in the area did not have the capacity to deal with the unfolding battle and was soon overstretched. Taliban logistics also appeared to be weak, as insurgents typically ran out of ammunition after a few hours; the Grenadier Guards found that the insurgents were constantly trying to get them to fire on civilians between the lines of both sides.<ref>Farrell, Theo, ''Unwinnable: Britain\u2019s War in Afghanistan, 2001\u20132014'', Bodley Head, 2017 {{ISBN|1847923461|978-1847923462}}, P.298</ref>\n\nAfter ten days, ISAF launched two simultaneous night-time assaults by helicopter over insurgent front lines and directly onto Taliban strongholds. In the early hours of 28 December, a pair of RAF Chinooks inserted A Company Royal Welsh battlegroup and their ATF 444 partners directly into Noorzoy Kalay, a third Chinook dropped a British and Afghan special operations group onto the Taliban command position near Baluchan. British and Afghan ground forces then moved up to complete the clearing of Noorzoy Kalay and Baluchan, as well as lift the siege of Patrol Base (PB) Pimon; insurgents were caught in a pincer movement as B Company Royal Welsh moved in on Jackal Light Armoured Vehicles. Finally, on 29 December, a company from the Grenadier Guards, operating with ATF 444, cleared the insurgents out of Zorobad.<ref>Farrell, Theo, ''Unwinnable: Britain\u2019s War in Afghanistan, 2001\u20132014'', Bodley Head, 2017 {{ISBN|1847923461|978-1847923462}}, P.298-299</ref>\n\nISAF intelligence had estimated that the villagers in Noorzoy Kalay and Baluchan were giving reluctant support to the Taliban, and so could persuaded to side with the government. Heavy 'messaging' had proceeded the operation to advise local elders that an overwhelming force was on its way to secure Chah-e Mazir. This message was passed on to local Taliban commanders, which had the desired effect: the insurgents retreated in advance of British and Afghan forces and put up only a sporadic resistance. Operation Tor Shpa'h was in effect the dry run for Operation Moshtarak, Task Force Helmand headquarters had deliberately played down the Tor Shpa'h in advance so as to 'avoid the impression that it would be another Panchai Palang.' The operation demonstrated that working through local elders, the Taliban could be coerced into surrendering ground without the necessity for major combat operations.<ref>Farrell, Theo, ''Unwinnable: Britain\u2019s War in Afghanistan, 2001\u20132014'', Bodley Head, 2017 {{ISBN|1847923461|978-1847923462}}, P.299</ref>\n\n==New War Model==\n\n===Operation Moshtarak===\n{{Main|Operation Moshtarak}}\n[[File:1st Battalion 3rd Marines near Marja.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Marines securing the city of Marjah.]]\nOn February 13, 2010, [[Operation Moshtarak]] was an [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) pacification offensive in the town of [[Marjah]], [[Helmand Province]], [[Afghanistan]]. It involved 15,000 American, Afghan, and British troops and constituted the largest joint operation of the War in Afghanistan up to that point and aimed to remove the [[Taliban]] from [[Marjah]] and eliminate the last Taliban stronghold in central Helmand Province.\n\nThe main target of the offensive was the town of Marjah, which had been controlled for years by the Taliban as well as drug traffickers. Although Moshtarak was described as the largest in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban, it was originally supposed to be the prelude to a much larger offensive in Kandahar that would follow Moshtarak by several months. However ISAF chose to heavily publicize the operation before it was launched, comparing its scope and size to the 2004 [[Second Battle of Fallujah]], in the hopes that Taliban fighters in the town would flee. The operation was also designed to showcase improvements in both the Afghan government and Afghan security forces. ISAF claimed that the operation was \"Afghan-led\" would use five Afghan brigades. General [[Stanley A. McChrystal]], the commander of ISAF, also promised that following the offensive ISAF would install a \"government in a box\" in Marjah.<ref>Gal Perl Finkel, [http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_opinion.php?id=14263 Back to the ground?], ''[[Israel Hayom]]'', November 8, 2015.</ref>\n\nAlthough initially successfully, ISAF and the Afghans failed to set up a working government in the town, leading to a successful resurgence by the Taliban; 90 days into the offensive General McChrystal famously referred to it as a \"bleeding ulcer\". In October the town was still described as \"troubling\", but by early December the fighting there was declared \"essentially over\".\n\nThe operation was called \"a key test\" of the coalition strategy against the [[Taliban insurgency]]. Brigadier [[James Cowan (British Army officer)|James Cowan]], the commander of British forces in Helmand, believed it would mark \"the start of the end of this insurgency\". At the very least it would become a test of whether the Afghan forces would be able to make their country peaceful and safe.\n\nThe announcement of the operation was also a part of this strategy: \"shaping the information battlefield strategic communications\", and to ensure it would not repeat the destruction of Fallujah in [[Iraq]] in 2004. Hours before the offensive began, Afghan and coalition forces dropped leaflets with the message, \"Do not allow the Taliban to enter your home\".\nAfter this operation in Helmand province, the neighbouring province and the city of [[Kandahar]] became a target of American operations. In March 2010, U.S. and [[NATO]] commanders released details of plans for the biggest offensive of the war against the Taliban insurgency.\n\nWhen launched, the operation was called a \"new war model\". Afghan and NATO officials had assembled a large team of Afghan administrators and an Afghan governor that would move into [[Marjah]] after the fighting, with more than 1,900 police standing by. \"We've got a government in a box, ready to roll in\", said American commander Stanley McChrystal. The capture of Marjah was intended to serve as a prototype for a new type of military operation. The Afghan government had pledged to hold any territory seized in the Taliban heartland during the assault. Utilities engineers were on hand to ensure power and water supplies were maintained.\n\n==Incidents==\n\n===Helmand province incident===\n{{Main|2007 Helmand province incident}}\nDuring the campaign there were numerous incidents where NATO air strikes resulted in massive casualties for the civilian population. One of the more notable was on June 22, 2007. A NATO air strike killed between 45 and 100 civilians. The Afghan and Pakistan governments condemned the attack blaming both NATO and the Taliban. NATO's reaction to the incident was just that the number of dead was less than 45 and they welcomed an investigation. But they stated that they will not change their tactic of bombing civilian centers because the Taliban use civilians as human shields. By then up to 314 civilians were killed by Coalition troops in contrast to 279 by  insurgents.\n\n===Friendly fire===\nOn August 23, 2007, three British soldiers from the [[Royal Anglian Regiment]] were killed, and two injured, by a U.S. [[F-15 Eagle|F-15]] fighter. <ref>{{cite news |title='Friendly fire' kills UK soldiers |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6962071.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=24 August 2007 |accessdate=2007-11-29 }}</ref>\n\nOn September 26, 2007, two Danish soldiers were killed by a British missile in a \"[[friendly fire]]\" incident.<ref>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Evans |title=Danish soldiers killed by British friendly fire |date=2007-12-19 |work=The Times |url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3070875.ece |accessdate=2008-11-14 |location=London}}</ref> The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Defence]] appointed a [[Public inquiry|board of inquiry]] to investigate the affair.<ref>{{cite news |title=MoD probes 'friendly fire' claim |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7113721.stm |publisher=BBC News|date=26 November 2007 |accessdate=2007-11-29}}</ref>\n\n==Political developments==\nBefore the arrival of ISAF troops, Helmand province was ruled by governor [[Sher Mohammed Akhundzada]].

Amir Muhammad did not collaborate with Daoud, and constantly undermined his rule, eventually driving him from power in December 2006.

The doors are so heavy, troops may need a mechanical assist device to open and close them and so wide drivers may require built-in visual references so they'll know if they can fit the vehicle in narrow spaces.  Frag Kit 6 armor also makes MRAP vehicles too wide to legally operate on U.S. highways.\n\nFrag Kit 6 technology is integrated into [[MRAP (armored vehicle)#MRAP II|MRAP II vehicles]].  The purpose behind the MRAP II competition was to field vehicles that don't need the kit added on.  Frag Kit 6 looks similar to the armored plates used on the [[United Kingdom|British]] \"Mastiff\" version of the [[Cougar (vehicle)|Force Protection Cougar]].<ref>http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/images/LAND_Cougar_Mastiff_PPV1_lg.jpg</ref> It appears to be used extensively on Navistar's [[International MaxxPro|MaxxPro]] Plus vehicle.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://media.navistar.com/index.php?s=43&item=153 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-06-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104122507/http://media.navistar.com/index.php?s=43&item=153 |archive-date=2014-11-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.usatoday.com/news/military/2007-10-01-mraps_N.htm USA Today: Plan calls for more armor on new combat vehicles 10/03/2007]\n\n[[Category:Vehicle armour]]\n\n\n{{Armour-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Le Petit Chat", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frag_Kit_6"}

After Miyazaki was apprehended, it was discovered that he had an extensive collection of [[anime]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] videotapes, causing a [[moral panic]] against ''otaku''. Though psychiatrists diagnosed Miyazaki as having one or more [[personality disorder]]s, he was determined to be aware of his crimes and their consequences, and was sentenced to [[death by hanging]] in 1997. He was executed in 2008.\n\n==Background==\nMiyazaki was [[premature birth|born premature]] and had a birth defect where his hand joints were fused together, preventing him from being able to bend his wrists upwards.<ref name=charlest>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlest.whipple.net/miyazaki.html|title=The Silencing of the Lambs|author=Charles T.

He attended Meidai Nakano High School in [[Nakano, Tokyo]], and was a star student until his grades dropped dramatically. He was ranked 40 out of 56 in his class, and did not receive the customary admission to [[Meiji University]]. Instead of studying [[English language|English]] and becoming a teacher as he originally intended, he attended a local junior college and studied to become a photo technician.<ref name=charlest/>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Miyazaki moved back into his parent's house near his father's print shop, sharing a room with his elder sister. Although Miyazaki's family was highly influential in [[Itsukaichi, Tokyo|Itsukaichi]], where his father owned a newspaper, Miyazaki expressed no desire to take over his father's job. After his arrest, Miyazaki would say that what he really craved was \"being listened to about his problems\" but believed that his parents, more worried about the material than the sentimental\u2014\"would have not heard [him]; [he] would've been ignored\".<ref name=lyon>{{cite book|authors=Lyon, Samantha; Dr Daphne Tan|title=Supernatural Serial Killers: What makes them murder?|publisher=Arcturus Publishing|year=2015|isbn=1784281328}}</ref> In the same confession, he said that by this period in his life he had begun to consider [[suicide]].\n\nMiyazaki was rejected by his two younger sisters, and felt he only received support from his grandfather. In May 1988, his grandfather died. This served to deepen his [[depression (mood)|depression]] and isolated him even further.<ref name=lyon/> In an attempt to \"retain something from him\", Miyazaki ate part of his grandfather's ashes. A few weeks later, one of his sisters caught him watching her while she was taking a shower. When she told him to leave, Miyazaki attacked her. When his mother learned of the incident and demanded that he spend more time working, and less time with his videos, he attacked her as well.<ref name=lyon/>\n\n==Murders==\nBetween August 1988 and June 1989, Miyazaki [[mutilation|mutilated]] and killed four girls between the ages of four and seven, and [[Child sexual abuse|sexually molested]] [[Necrophilia|their corpses]]. He drank the blood of one victim and ate a part of her hand.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news-2-15012/serial-child-killer-hanged-as-japan-steps-up-death-penalty-1-1173292|title=Serial child-killer hanged as Japan steps up death penalty|work=[[The Scotsman]]|location=Edinburgh|date=17 June 2008|access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref> These crimes\u2014which prior to Miyazaki's apprehension were named the \"Little Girl Murders\" and later the {{nihongo|Tokyo/Saitama Serial Kidnapping Murders of Little Girls|\u6771\u4eac\u30fb\u57fc\u7389\u9023\u7d9a\u5e7c\u5973\u8a98\u62d0\u6bba\u4eba\u4e8b\u4ef6|T\u014dky\u014d Saitama renzoku y\u014djo y\u016bkai satsujin jiken}}\u2014shocked [[Saitama Prefecture]], which had few crimes against children.\n\nDuring the day, Miyazaki was, by all accounts, a mild-mannered individual. Outside of work, he randomly selected children to kill. He wrote to the families of his victims, sending them letters recalling the details of his murders. Police found that the families of the victims had something else in common: all received silent [[Nuisance call|nuisance phone calls]]. Miyazaki would not speak a word during these calls, instead simply breathing heavily. If they did not answer Miyazaki\u2019s calls, he would call repeatedly; sometimes their phones would ring up to 20 minutes.\n\nOn August 22, 1988, one day after Miyazaki's 26th birthday, Mari Konno, a four-year-old girl, vanished while playing at a friend's house. After failed attempts to find her, Konno's father contacted the police. Miyazaki had led Konno into his black [[Nissan Langley]] and abducted her. He drove westward of [[Tokyo]] and parked the car under a bridge in a wooded area. There he sat alongside the girl for a half-hour before murdering her. He then engaged in sexual acts with the corpse and left her corpse in the hills near his home. He took her clothes with him and departed. He allowed Konno's corpse to [[decompose]] for a while before later returning to remove the hands and feet, which he kept in his closet. These were recovered upon his arrest. He charred her remaining bones in his furnace, ground them into powder, and sent them to her family in a box, along with several of her teeth, photos of her clothes, and a postcard which read: \"Mari. Cremated. Bones. Investigate. Prove.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=McQueen, Victor|title=The World's Worst Serial Killers: Monsters whose crimes shocked the world|publisher=Arcturus Publishing|year=2015|isbn=1784281484}}</ref>\n\nOn October 3, 1988, Miyazaki was driving along a rural road when he spotted seven-year-old Masami Yoshizawa. He offered her a ride, and she accepted. He then drove to the same place he had killed Konno, and killed Yoshizawa. He engaged in sexual acts with the corpse, and took the girl's clothes with him when he departed.<ref name=keller>{{cite book|author=Keller, Robert|title=Beyond Evil|year=2016|isbn=1536507644}}</ref>\n\nOn December 12, 1988, four-year-old Erika Namba was returning home from a friend's house when Miyazaki kidnapped her, forcing her into his car. He drove to a parking lot in [[Naguri, Saitama]], forced her to remove her clothes in the back seat, and began to take pictures of her. After killing her, he tied her hands and feet behind her back, covered her with a bed sheet, and placed the body in his car's trunk. He disposed of the girl's clothes in a wooded area and left the body in the adjoining parking lot. Miyazaki sent a [[postcard]] to her family, assembled using words cut out of magazines: \"Erika. Cold. Cough. Throat. Rest. Death.\"<ref name=keller/>\n\nOn June 6, 1989, Miyazaki convinced five-year-old Ayako Nomoto to allow him to take pictures of her. He then led her into his car and murdered her. He covered the corpse with a bed sheet and placed her in the trunk of his car, taking the body to his apartment. He spent the next two days engaging in sexual acts with the corpse, taking pictures of it in various positions, and filming it.<ref name=keller/>\n\nWhen the body began to decompose, Miyazaki dismembered it, abandoning the torso in a cemetery and the head in the nearby hills. He kept the hands, from which he drank blood and ate part of them. Fearing that the police would find the corpse, he returned to the [[cemetery]] and the hills two weeks later and carried the remains back to his apartment, where he hid them in his closet.\n\n==Arrest==\nOn July 23, 1989, Miyazaki saw two sisters playing in a park in [[Hachi\u014dji]], Tokyo. He managed to separate the younger of the sisters from the older one, who stayed behind. The sisters' father arrived shortly after to find Miyazaki taking photographs of the younger daughter, who he had convinced to strip nude. The father attacked Miyazaki, but was unable to restrain him.<ref>https://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-06-18/japan-confirms-execution-of-cannibal-killer/2475810</ref><ref name=keller /> After fleeing on foot, Miyazaki eventually returned to the park to retrieve his car, whereupon he was arrested by police responding to a call by the father. A search of Miyazaki's two-room bungalow produced 5,763 videotapes, some containing [[anime]] and [[Slasher film|slasher]] films (later used as reasoning for his crimes). Interspersed among them was video footage and pictures of his victims. He was also reported to be a fan of [[horror film]]s, of which he had a collection. Miyazaki, who retained a perpetually calm and collected demeanor during his trial, appeared indifferent to his capture.<ref>{{cite news|author=Schoenberger, Karl|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-09-09-mn-1579-story.html|title=Sordid Serial-Killing Case Exposes the Other Side of Innocence in Japan|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=9 September 1989}}</ref>\n\n==Moral panic==\nThe [[News media|media]] called him \"The [[Otaku]] Murderer\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scaredyet.net/the-otaku-killer-miyazaki-tsutomu/|title=The Otaku Killer: Miyazaki Tsutomu|author=Oliviera, James|date=3 January 2010|access-date=7 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107074646/http://scaredyet.net/the-otaku-killer-miyazaki-tsutomu/|archive-date=7 January 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> His killings caused a [[moral panic]] against otaku, accusing anime and horror films of making him a murderer.

After Miyazaki was apprehended, it was discovered that he had an extensive collection of [[anime]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] videotapes, causing a [[moral panic]] against ''otaku''. Though psychiatrists diagnosed Miyazaki as having one or more [[personality disorder]]s, he was determined to be aware of his crimes and their consequences, and was sentenced to [[death by hanging]] in 1997. He was executed in 2008.\n\n==Background==\nMiyazaki was [[premature birth|born premature]] and had a birth defect where his hand joints were fused together, preventing him from being able to bend his wrists upwards.<ref name=charlest>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlest.whipple.net/miyazaki.html|title=The Silencing of the Lambs|author=Charles T.

He attended Meidai Nakano High School in [[Nakano, Tokyo]], and was a star student until his grades dropped dramatically. He was ranked 40 out of 56 in his class, and did not receive the customary admission to [[Meiji University]]. Instead of studying [[English language|English]] and becoming a teacher as he originally intended, he attended a local junior college and studied to become a photo technician.<ref name=charlest/>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Miyazaki moved back into his parent's house near his father's print shop, sharing a room with his elder sister. Although Miyazaki's family was highly influential in [[Itsukaichi, Tokyo|Itsukaichi]], where his father owned a newspaper, Miyazaki expressed no desire to take over his father's job. After his arrest, Miyazaki would say that what he really craved was \"being listened to about his problems\" but believed that his parents, more worried about the material than the sentimental\u2014\"would have not heard [him]; [he] would've been ignored\".<ref name=lyon>{{cite book|authors=Lyon, Samantha; Dr Daphne Tan|title=Supernatural Serial Killers: What makes them murder?|publisher=Arcturus Publishing|year=2015|isbn=1784281328}}</ref> In the same confession, he said that by this period in his life he had begun to consider [[suicide]].\n\nMiyazaki was rejected by his two younger sisters, and felt he only received support from his grandfather. In May 1988, his grandfather died. This served to deepen his [[depression (mood)|depression]] and isolated him even further.<ref name=lyon/> In an attempt to \"retain something from him\", Miyazaki ate part of his grandfather's ashes. A few weeks later, one of his sisters caught him watching her while she was taking a shower. When she told him to leave, Miyazaki attacked her. When his mother learned of the incident and demanded that he spend more time working, and less time with his videos, he attacked her as well.<ref name=lyon/>\n\n==Murders==\nBetween August 1988 and June 1989, Miyazaki [[mutilation|mutilated]] and killed four girls between the ages of four and seven, and [[Child sexual abuse|sexually molested]] [[Necrophilia|their corpses]]. He drank the blood of one victim and ate a part of her hand.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news-2-15012/serial-child-killer-hanged-as-japan-steps-up-death-penalty-1-1173292|title=Serial child-killer hanged as Japan steps up death penalty|work=[[The Scotsman]]|location=Edinburgh|date=17 June 2008|access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref> These crimes\u2014which prior to Miyazaki's apprehension were named the \"Little Girl Murders\" and later the {{nihongo|Tokyo/Saitama Serial Kidnapping Murders of Little Girls|\u6771\u4eac\u30fb\u57fc\u7389\u9023\u7d9a\u5e7c\u5973\u8a98\u62d0\u6bba\u4eba\u4e8b\u4ef6|T\u014dky\u014d Saitama renzoku y\u014djo y\u016bkai satsujin jiken}}\u2014shocked [[Saitama Prefecture]], which had few crimes against children.\n\nDuring the day, Miyazaki was, by all accounts, a mild-mannered individual. Outside of work, he randomly selected children to kill. He wrote to the families of his victims, sending them letters recalling the details of his murders. Police found that the families of the victims had something else in common: all received silent [[Nuisance call|nuisance phone calls]]. Miyazaki would not speak a word during these calls, instead simply breathing heavily. If they did not answer Miyazaki\u2019s calls, he would call repeatedly; sometimes their phones would ring up to 20 minutes.\n\nOn August 22, 1988, one day after Miyazaki's 26th birthday, Mari Konno, a four-year-old girl, vanished while playing at a friend's house. After failed attempts to find her, Konno's father contacted the police. Miyazaki had led Konno into his black [[Nissan Langley]] and abducted her. He drove westward of [[Tokyo]] and parked the car under a bridge in a wooded area. There he sat alongside the girl for a half-hour before murdering her. He then engaged in sexual acts with the corpse and left her corpse in the hills near his home. He took her clothes with him and departed. He allowed Konno's corpse to [[decompose]] for a while before later returning to remove the hands and feet, which he kept in his closet. These were recovered upon his arrest. He charred her remaining bones in his furnace, ground them into powder, and sent them to her family in a box, along with several of her teeth, photos of her clothes, and a postcard which read: \"Mari. Cremated. Bones. Investigate. Prove.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=McQueen, Victor|title=The World's Worst Serial Killers: Monsters whose crimes shocked the world|publisher=Arcturus Publishing|year=2015|isbn=1784281484}}</ref>\n\nOn October 3, 1988, Miyazaki was driving along a rural road when he spotted seven-year-old Masami Yoshizawa. He offered her a ride, and she accepted. He then drove to the same place he had killed Konno, and killed Yoshizawa. He engaged in sexual acts with the corpse, and took the girl's clothes with him when he departed.<ref name=keller>{{cite book|author=Keller, Robert|title=Beyond Evil|year=2016|isbn=1536507644}}</ref>\n\nOn December 12, 1988, four-year-old Erika Namba was returning home from a friend's house when Miyazaki kidnapped her, forcing her into his car. He drove to a parking lot in [[Naguri, Saitama]], forced her to remove her clothes in the back seat, and began to take pictures of her. After killing her, he tied her hands and feet behind her back, covered her with a bed sheet, and placed the body in his car's trunk. He disposed of the girl's clothes in a wooded area and left the body in the adjoining parking lot. Miyazaki sent a [[postcard]] to her family, assembled using words cut out of magazines: \"Erika. Cold. Cough. Throat. Rest. Death.\"<ref name=keller/>\n\nOn June 6, 1989, Miyazaki convinced five-year-old Ayako Nomoto to allow him to take pictures of her. He then led her into his car and murdered her. He covered the corpse with a bed sheet and placed her in the trunk of his car, taking the body to his apartment. He spent the next two days engaging in sexual acts with the corpse, taking pictures of it in various positions, and filming it.<ref name=keller/>\n\nWhen the body began to decompose, Miyazaki dismembered it, abandoning the torso in a cemetery and the head in the nearby hills. He kept the hands, from which he drank blood and ate part of them. Fearing that the police would find the corpse, he returned to the [[cemetery]] and the hills two weeks later and carried the remains back to his apartment, where he hid them in his closet.\n\n==Arrest==\nOn July 23, 1989, Miyazaki saw two sisters playing in a park in [[Hachi\u014dji]], Tokyo. He managed to separate the younger of the sisters from the older one, who stayed behind. The sisters' father arrived shortly after to find Miyazaki taking photographs of the younger daughter, who he had convinced to strip nude. The father attacked Miyazaki, but was unable to restrain him.<ref>https://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-06-18/japan-confirms-execution-of-cannibal-killer/2475810</ref><ref name=keller /> After fleeing on foot, Miyazaki eventually returned to the park to retrieve his car, whereupon he was arrested by police responding to a call by the father. A search of Miyazaki's two-room bungalow produced 5,763 videotapes, some containing [[anime]] and [[Slasher film|slasher]] films (later used as reasoning for his crimes). Interspersed among them was video footage and pictures of his victims. He was also reported to be a fan of [[horror film]]s, of which he had a collection. Miyazaki, who retained a perpetually calm and collected demeanor during his trial, appeared indifferent to his capture.<ref>{{cite news|author=Schoenberger, Karl|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-09-09-mn-1579-story.html|title=Sordid Serial-Killing Case Exposes the Other Side of Innocence in Japan|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=9 September 1989}}</ref>\n\n==Moral panic==\nThe [[News media|media]] called him \"The [[Otaku]] Murderer\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scaredyet.net/the-otaku-killer-miyazaki-tsutomu/|title=The Otaku Killer: Miyazaki Tsutomu|author=Oliviera, James|date=3 January 2010|access-date=7 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107074646/http://scaredyet.net/the-otaku-killer-miyazaki-tsutomu/|archive-date=7 January 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> His killings caused a [[moral panic]] against otaku, accusing anime and horror films of making him a murderer.

Two teams determined him to be feeble-minded\u2014one team concluding that he was [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]], the other that he had [[multiple personality disorder]].

They also won '''Best New Artist\u2014Southeast''' at the [[MTV Video Music Awards Latin America]].<ref name=\"mtvla.com\">[http://www.mtvla.com/canal/especiales/vmala/02/nominados/artistanuevosureste.jhtml?i=4 Best New Artist Southeast \u2013 Winners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004318/http://www.mtvla.com/canal/especiales/vmala/02/nominados/artistanuevosureste.jhtml?i=4 |date=2007-09-27 }}, MTVLA.com \u2014 MTV Video Music Awards Latinoam\u00e9rica</ref>  In December 2002, they performed a joint concert with [[Mambr\u00fa]] in the [[Estadio Jos\u00e9 Amalfitani|V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield]] stadium with over 40,000 tickets sold.\n\nIn order to promote themselves internationally, they traveled to the USA, appearing in [[New York City|New York]] & [[Miami]]<ref>[http://www.music.com/group/bandana/2/biography/ Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224728/http://www.music.com/group/bandana/2/biography/ |date=2007-09-26 }}, Music.com, Drago Bonacich 18-06-2004</</ref> & also featuring on the cover of [[Billboard Magazine]].

They revealed through interviews that reuniting had always been a possibility, but it kept being postponed due to some of the members' pregnancies and other professional commitments. A new album, ''La Vuelta'' was released to celebrate their reunion, which contains revised versions of some of their biggest hits. The track list is also the set list of their tour.\n\nOn January 16, 2017, the group released their first original song since 2003 entitled \"Bomb\u00f3n\" featuring Puerto Rican rapper [[Wisin]]. The following day, da Cunha revealed she had left the band, hence why she did not participate in the recording of this song. This brand new song serves as the main theme of one of [[Telef\u00e9]]'s reality show, ''Despedida de Soltero'' (''Stag Party'').\n\n== Cultural Impact ==\nFollowing on from a trend established by the [[Spice Girls]] in the UK & internationally in the late 1990s, Bandana became a carefully marketed product which was especially popular among young girls.  Many licensed products with their brand were available to purchase, and contributed to the heightened interest in the group, occasionally referred to as 'Bandanamania'.<ref name=\"Biography\">[http://www.mtvla.com/bands/az/bandana/bio.jhtml Biography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004337/http://www.mtvla.com/bands/az/bandana/bio.jhtml |date=2007-09-27 }} MTVLA.com</ref>  Their signature [[bandanas]] of varying colours were quickly imitated by the teen population, as were their lyrics & dance routines.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\nFrom 2001 to 2003, there was an official ''Bandana'' store selling lots of merchandisings.

Although it featured the expansion [[Houston Texans]] and the relocation of the [[Seattle Seahawks]] to the NFC, it was actually the second to do so (after [[Madden NFL 2002|the previous edition]] had it done in the second season of its own Franchise mode, with the Seahawks still in the AFC and no Texans team when said mode was started).

[[American football]] [[simulation video game]] based on the [[National Football League|NFL]] that was developed by [[EA Tiburon]] and [[Budcat Creations]] and published by [[EA Sports]]. The 14th installment of the ''[[Madden NFL|Madden NFL series]]'', the game features former [[St. Louis Rams]] [[Running back (American football)|running back]] [[Marshall Faulk]] on the cover. This edition of ''Madden'' was the first to have [[EA Trax]], the Mini Camp mode and to feature [[John Madden]] and [[Al Michaels]] as commentators, who took over for [[Pat Summerall]]. Although it featured the expansion [[Houston Texans]] and the relocation of the [[Seattle Seahawks]] to the NFC, it was actually the second to do so (after [[Madden NFL 2002|the previous edition]] had it done in the second season of its own Franchise mode, with the Seahawks still in the AFC and no Texans team when said mode was started). The game was released on August 12, 2002 for the [[Game Boy Advance]], [[GameCube]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[PlayStation 2]] and the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]].\n\n==Roster errors==\n* [[Bruce Matthews (American football)|Bruce Matthews]] is the starting center for the [[Tennessee Titans]] despite having retired by the start of the season.\n* Retired [[quarterback]] [[Mark Rypien]] is listed as a free agent.\n* [[Ryan Leaf]] appears as a backup quarterback for the [[Seattle Seahawks]] despite retiring before the start of training camp.\n* [[LaVar Arrington]] does not appear in the game due to him not represented by the NFL players association at the time therefore preventing him from appearing in the game, however his name can be added.\n* [[Pat Tillman]] appears as a free agent despite retiring before the season to join the military.\n* [[Tony Boselli]] appears as a left tackle for the [[Houston Texans]], however he retired before the 2002 NFL season because of injuries.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n''Madden NFL 2003'' was the first [[EA Sports]] video game to feature [[EA Trax]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; width:50%; margin: 5px;\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#C8C8FF;\" | Madden NFL 2003 Soundtrack\n|-\n!style=\"background:#ddddee;\" | Artist\n!style=\"background:#ddddee;\" | Song\n|-\n|[[Andrew W.K.]]\n|\"[[Party Hard]]\"\n|-\n|[[Audiovent]]\n|\"[[The Energy]]\"\n|-\n|[[Dry Cell (band)|Dry Cell]]\n|\"Body Crumbles\"\n|-\n|[[Epidemic (band)|Epidemic]]\n|\"Walk Away\"\n|-\n|[[Good Charlotte]]\n|\"[[The Anthem (Good Charlotte song)|The Anthem]]\"\n|-\n|[[Hed PE]]\n|\"Suck It Up\"\n|-\n|[[Bon Jovi]]\n|\"[[Everyday (Bon Jovi song)|Everyday]]\"\n|-\n|[[Nappy Roots]]\n|\"[[Awnaw]]\" (Rock Remix ft.
