He won the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] title in 1986 after stopping [[Trevor Berbick]] in the second round, and added the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] and [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] titles after defeating [[James Smith (boxer)|James Smith]] and [[Tony Tucker]] in 1987. This made Tyson the first heavyweight boxer to simultaneously hold the WBA, WBC and IBF titles, and the only heavyweight to successively unify them.\n\nTyson became the [[lineal champion]] in 1988 when he knocked out [[Michael Spinks]] in 91 seconds of the first round.<ref name=CBZ>{{cite web|title=\"Iron\" Mike Tyson|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/tysonrec.htm|publisher=Cyber Boxing Zone|accessdate=November 20, 2016}}</ref> He successfully defended his titles nine times, which included victories over [[Larry Holmes]] and [[Frank Bruno]]. In 1990, Tyson lost the titles to underdog [[Buster Douglas]], who knocked him out in the tenth round. Attempting to regain the titles, Tyson defeated [[Donovan Ruddock]] twice in 1991, but pulled out of a fight with then-undisputed heavyweight champion [[Evander Holyfield]] (who had defeated Douglas later in 1990) due to a rib injury.\n\nIn 1992, Tyson was convicted of rape and sentenced to six years in prison; he was released on parole after serving three years. After his release in 1995, he engaged in a series of comeback fights. He won the WBC and WBA titles in 1996, after stopping [[Frank Bruno]] and [[Bruce Seldon]]. With his defeat of Bruno, Tyson joined [[Floyd Patterson]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Tim Witherspoon]], [[Evander Holyfield]], and [[George Foreman]] as the only men in boxing history to have regained a heavyweight championship after having lost it. After being stripped of the WBC title in the same year, Tyson [[Mike Tyson vs. Evander Holyfield|lost the WBA title to Evander Holyfield]] by an eleventh round stoppage. Their [[Evander Holyfield vs. Mike Tyson II|1997 rematch]] ended when Tyson was disqualified for biting Holyfield's ears.\n\nIn 2002, Tyson fought for the world heavyweight title again at the age of 35, losing by knockout to [[Lennox Lewis]]. Tyson retired from professional boxing in 2006, after being knocked out in consecutive matches against [[Journeyman (boxing)|journeymen]] [[Danny Williams (boxer)|Danny Williams]] and [[Kevin McBride]].

The fight was initially ruled a win for Tyson by [[Disqualification (boxing)|disqualification]] (DQ) of his opponent. The ruling was \"adjusted\" to a win by [[technical knockout]] (TKO) after Tyson's corner protested that a DQ win would end Tyson's string of knockout victories, and that a knockout would have been the inevitable result.\n\nIn July, after recording six more knockout victories, Tyson fought former world title challenger [[Marvis Frazier]] in [[Glens Falls, New York]] on another ABC Sports broadcast.

It intends to measure the '''state of democracy''' in 167 countries, of which 166 are [[sovereign state]]s and 164 are [[Member states of the United Nations|UN member states]].\n\nThe index was first published in 2006, with updates for 2008, 2010 and later years. The index is based on 60 indicators grouped in five different categories, measuring [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], [[civil liberties]] and [[political culture]]. In addition to a numeric score and a ranking, the index categorises each country in one of four regime types: ''full democracies'', ''flawed democracies'', ''[[hybrid regime]]s'' and ''authoritarian regimes''.\n\n==Method==\n{{Democracy}}\nAs described in the report,<ref name=\"index2012\" /> the [[democracy]] index is a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] based on the answers of 60 questions, each one with either two or three permitted alternative answers. Most answers are experts' assessments. Some answers are provided by public-opinion surveys from the respective countries. In the case of countries for which survey results are missing, survey results for similar countries, and expert assessments are used in order to fill in gaps.\n\nThe questions are grouped into five categories: electoral process and pluralism, civil liberties, the functioning of government, political participation, and political culture. Each answer is converted to a score, either 0 or 1, or for the three-answer questions, 0, 0.5 or 1. With the exceptions mentioned below, within each category, the scores are added, multiplied by ten, and divided by the total number of questions within the category. There are a few modifying dependencies, which are explained much more precisely than the main rule procedures. In a few cases, an answer yielding zero for one question voids another question; e.g. if the elections for the national legislature and head of government are not considered free (question 1), then the next question, \"''Are elections... fair?''\", is not considered, but automatically scored zero. Likewise, there are a few questions considered so important that a low score on them yields a penalty on the total score sum for their respective categories, namely:\n\n#\"Whether [[nation]]al [[election]]s are free and fair\";\n#\"The [[security]] of [[Voting|voters]]\";\n#\"The influence of foreign powers on government\";\n#\"The capability of the [[Civil service|civil servant]]s to implement policies\".\n\nThe five category indices, which are listed in the report, are then averaged to find the Democracy Index for a given country. Finally, the Democracy Index, [[rounding|rounded]] to two [[decimals]], decides the regime type classification of the country.\n\nThe report discusses other indices of democracy, as defined, e.g. by [[Freedom House]], and argues for some of the choices made by the team from the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]. In this comparison, a higher emphasis is placed on the public opinion and attitudes, as measured by [[Survey (human research)|survey]]s, but on the other hand, economic living standards are not weighted as one criterion of democracy (as seemingly some other investigators have done).<ref name=\"index2010\" /><ref name=\"index2006\" />\n\nThe report is widely cited in the international press as well as in [[peer review]]ed academic journals.<ref>{{cite journal|last3=Manaev|first3=Oleg|last4=Manayeva|first4=Natalie|last5=Dzmitry|first5=Yuran|title=More State than Nation: Lukashenko's Belarus {{!}} JIA SIPA|journal=Journal of International Affairs|date=1 December 2011|volume=65|issue=1|pages=93\u2013113|url=https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/more-state-nation-lukashenkos-belarus|accessdate=26 January 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221152959/https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/more-state-nation-lukashenkos-belarus|archive-date=21 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Classification definitions==\n'''[[Liberal democracy|Full democracies]]''' are nations where civil liberties and fundamental political freedoms are not only respected but also reinforced by a political culture conducive to the thriving of democratic principles. These nations have a valid system of governmental checks and balances, an independent judiciary whose decisions are enforced, governments that function adequately, and diverse and independent media. These nations have only limited problems in democratic functioning.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n'''[[Illiberal democracy|Flawed democracies]]''' are nations where elections are fair and free and basic civil liberties are honoured but may have issues (e.g. media freedom infringement and minor suppression of political opposition and critics). These nations have significant faults in other democratic aspects, including underdeveloped political culture, low levels of participation in politics, and issues in the functioning of governance.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n'''[[Hybrid regime]]s''' are nations with regular [[electoral fraud]]s, preventing them from being fair and free democracy. These nations commonly have governments that apply pressure on political opposition, non-independent judiciaries, widespread corruption, harassment and pressure placed on the media, anaemic rule of law, and more pronounced faults than flawed democracies in the realms of underdeveloped political culture, low levels of participation in politics, and issues in the functioning of governance.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n'''[[Authoritarian regime]]s''' are nations where political pluralism has vanished or is extremely limited. These nations are often [[absolute monarchies]] or [[dictatorship]]s, may have some conventional institutions of democracy but with meagre significance, infringements and abuses of civil liberties are commonplace, elections (if they take place) are not fair and free, the media is often state-owned or controlled by groups associated with the ruling regime, the judiciary is not independent, and there are omnipresent censorship and suppression of governmental criticism.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n==Democracy Index by country 2019==\nListing by country is available on ''The Economist''

However, the final report does not indicate what kinds of experts, nor their number, nor whether the experts are employees of the Economist Intelligence Unit or independent scholars, nor the nationalities of the experts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/NAR/Articles/Peter-Tasker-The-flawed-science-behind-democracy-rankings|title=Peter Tasker: The flawed 'science' behind democracy rankings|website=asia.nikkei.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223074457/https://asia.nikkei.com/NAR/Articles/Peter-Tasker-The-flawed-science-behind-democracy-rankings|archive-date=2019-02-23|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Democracy Index by regime type==\nThe following table gives the number and percentage of countries and the percentage of the world population for each regime type in 2018:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=democracy2018|title=Democracy Index 2018: Me Too?|last=The Economist Intelligence Unit|first=|date=8 January 2019|website=The Economist Intelligence Unit|url-access=registration|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202212334/https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=Democracy2018|archive-date=2 February 2019|access-date=13 January 2019}}</ref>\n<!--\nchanges to this table will be reverted, if the data does not match that provided in the 2014 survey\nDo you mean 2018?\n-->\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

It intends to measure the '''state of democracy''' in 167 countries, of which 166 are [[sovereign state]]s and 164 are [[Member states of the United Nations|UN member states]].\n\nThe index was first published in 2006, with updates for 2008, 2010 and later years. The index is based on 60 indicators grouped in five different categories, measuring [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], [[civil liberties]] and [[political culture]]. In addition to a numeric score and a ranking, the index categorises each country in one of four regime types: ''full democracies'', ''flawed democracies'', ''[[hybrid regime]]s'' and ''authoritarian regimes''.\n\n==Method==\n{{Democracy}}\nAs described in the report,<ref name=\"index2012\" /> the [[democracy]] index is a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] based on the answers of 60 questions, each one with either two or three permitted alternative answers. Most answers are experts' assessments. Some answers are provided by public-opinion surveys from the respective countries. In the case of countries for which survey results are missing, survey results for similar countries, and expert assessments are used in order to fill in gaps.\n\nThe questions are grouped into five categories: electoral process and pluralism, civil liberties, the functioning of government, political participation, and political culture. Each answer is converted to a score, either 0 or 1, or for the three-answer questions, 0, 0.5 or 1. With the exceptions mentioned below, within each category, the scores are added, multiplied by ten, and divided by the total number of questions within the category. There are a few modifying dependencies, which are explained much more precisely than the main rule procedures. In a few cases, an answer yielding zero for one question voids another question; e.g. if the elections for the national legislature and head of government are not considered free (question 1), then the next question, \"''Are elections... fair?''\", is not considered, but automatically scored zero. Likewise, there are a few questions considered so important that a low score on them yields a penalty on the total score sum for their respective categories, namely:\n\n#\"Whether [[nation]]al [[election]]s are free and fair\";\n#\"The [[security]] of [[Voting|voters]]\";\n#\"The influence of foreign powers on government\";\n#\"The capability of the [[Civil service|civil servant]]s to implement policies\".\n\nThe five category indices, which are listed in the report, are then averaged to find the Democracy Index for a given country. Finally, the Democracy Index, [[rounding|rounded]] to two [[decimals]], decides the regime type classification of the country.\n\nThe report discusses other indices of democracy, as defined, e.g. by [[Freedom House]], and argues for some of the choices made by the team from the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]. In this comparison, a higher emphasis is placed on the public opinion and attitudes, as measured by [[Survey (human research)|survey]]s, but on the other hand, economic living standards are not weighted as one criterion of democracy (as seemingly some other investigators have done).<ref name=\"index2010\" /><ref name=\"index2006\" />\n\nThe report is widely cited in the international press as well as in [[peer review]]ed academic journals.<ref>{{cite journal|last3=Manaev|first3=Oleg|last4=Manayeva|first4=Natalie|last5=Dzmitry|first5=Yuran|title=More State than Nation: Lukashenko's Belarus {{!}} JIA SIPA|journal=Journal of International Affairs|date=1 December 2011|volume=65|issue=1|pages=93\u2013113|url=https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/more-state-nation-lukashenkos-belarus|accessdate=26 January 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221152959/https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/more-state-nation-lukashenkos-belarus|archive-date=21 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Classification definitions==\n'''[[Liberal democracy|Full democracies]]''' are nations where civil liberties and fundamental political freedoms are not only respected but also reinforced by a political culture conducive to the thriving of democratic principles. These nations have a valid system of governmental checks and balances, an independent judiciary whose decisions are enforced, governments that function adequately, and diverse and independent media. These nations have only limited problems in democratic functioning.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n'''[[Illiberal democracy|Flawed democracies]]''' are nations where elections are fair and free and basic civil liberties are honoured but may have issues (e.g. media freedom infringement and minor suppression of political opposition and critics). These nations have significant faults in other democratic aspects, including underdeveloped political culture, low levels of participation in politics, and issues in the functioning of governance.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n'''[[Hybrid regime]]s''' are nations with regular [[electoral fraud]]s, preventing them from being fair and free democracy. These nations commonly have governments that apply pressure on political opposition, non-independent judiciaries, widespread corruption, harassment and pressure placed on the media, anaemic rule of law, and more pronounced faults than flawed democracies in the realms of underdeveloped political culture, low levels of participation in politics, and issues in the functioning of governance.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n'''[[Authoritarian regime]]s''' are nations where political pluralism has vanished or is extremely limited. These nations are often [[absolute monarchies]] or [[dictatorship]]s, may have some conventional institutions of democracy but with meagre significance, infringements and abuses of civil liberties are commonplace, elections (if they take place) are not fair and free, the media is often state-owned or controlled by groups associated with the ruling regime, the judiciary is not independent, and there are omnipresent censorship and suppression of governmental criticism.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n==Democracy Index by country 2019==\nListing by country is available on ''The Economist''
