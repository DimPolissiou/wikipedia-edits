This was Garner's and Andrews' third film pairing as romantic leads, after ''[[The Americanization of Emily]]'' (1964) and ''[[Victor Victoria]]'' (1982).\n\nThe movie plot is as follows:\nTwo strangers take refuge in a small cabin during a blizzard and, despite their many differences, discover that fate has brought them together. It's Thanksgiving Day and both Dr. Catherine Howard and Robert Woodward wind up at the same medical facility -- one still missing a loved one, the other visiting a dying spouse.  \nAlthough they have lived within miles of each other for years, they have never met. Outside, snow has begun to fall and, despite a brusque first encounter, Catherine offers Robert a ride home when she learns that he is stranded. The pair gets off to a rocky start as Catherine tries to maneuver the car through what is now a blizzard and Robert barks directions. \nSuddenly, the car careens off the road into a snow bank. They trudge through the blizzard and discover an empty cabin. They wait out the storm and begin to break through each other's shells.\nFirst thing the following morning they are discovered by one of his daughters and her husband.  They give Catherine a drive back to her home and they agree to meet the following Sunday.\nOn the following Sunday Catherine gets dressed and then gets in her truck and drives to Murray's.  It is a restaurant they both know and frequent.  She orders his suggested Chocolate Chip pancakes and waits for him.  He too gets ready to go and meet her that Sunday morning.  When he gets to the front of Murray's his cellphone rings.  His wife has had another heart attack.\nThe next scene is when Robert is hosting the wake for his wife, who passed on that Sunday.  Both of his daughters are at the wake and the pregnant daughter Lori (Stacy Grant) sits on the floor in the kitchen and cries.  Her sister Jaclyn comes over and comforts her.  Lori is eight months pregnant and going through a divorce.\nThe next scenes show that time has moved on a bit and now we are past the funeral.  The next thing we see is that Dr. Howard is receiving a telephone call to let her know that a young lady is going into a troubled labor.  She drives to the hospital only to find that Robert is the one who called her.  She is asked if it was okay.  She then stands to head to the daughter and Robert asks if she went to the diner that Sunday.  She replied that she did not go, that she had been too busy. She asked if he went.  He says that he did go but was called away while he was there.  Then she discovers that Robert's wife died that day.\nHe says that he would like to show her something.  They go out to where his truck is parked.  He pulls out a box.  She opens it and there is a necklace.  It is exactly like the one thought she lost the night they went off the road.  She thinks that, and says that, as she asks where he bought it.  He explains that it is the necklace she lost and then shows her the neck scarf she placed on the tree near where she lost it.\nRobert asks her if she has a few moments.  Catherine says that it is Christmas Day so her schedule is free.  They both got into his truck and drove through the icy roads.  Sure enough, His truck gets stuck right near where they broke down the year before.  She looks to the roof of the cabin and smoke is coming from the chimney.\nThey both walk to the front door.  She knocks, and when nobody answers, He walks around and breaks another window.  He comes to the front door and opens it.  She is curious about why they are here again.  Then he explains that the previous owners of the cabin actually did sell the cabin to Robert this past year.  Now he had a place to go into whenever he is stuck on this road.\nThe last scene is Catherine and Robert standing inside the living room area of the log cabin and kissing.\n\n==Cast==\n[[James Garner]]\t ...\t\nRobert Woodward<br>\n[[Julie Andrews]]\t ...\t\nCatherine Howard<br>\n[[Patricia Charbonneau]]\t ...\t\nLori<br>\nStacy Grant\t ...\t\nJaclyn Woodward<br>\nStewart Bick\t ...\t\nJeff<br>\n[[Daniel Magder]]\t ...\t\nMichael<br>\nSheena Larkin\t ...\t\nMarybeth Woodward<br>\nKim Roberts\t ...\t\nNurse Sara<br>\nGary Plaxton\t ...\t\nDr. Michaels<br>\nBelinda Hum\t ...\t\nNew Hospice Nurse<br>\nKerrilyn Keith\t ...\t\nO.R.

His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"[[Love Is the Hero]]\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\". Squier's best selling album, 1981's [[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|''Don't Say No'']], is considered a landmark release within the arena rock genre and bridging the gap between power pop and hard rock.\n\nDescribed as a personification of early 80's rock music,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://open.spotify.com/artist/3Fz2GbraVXhcpXnoi2Oe1r|title=Billy Squier|website=Spotify|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref> Squier's most successful period ranges from 1981 to 1984, during which he scored five Top 10 Mainstream Rock hits (two of which were number ones), two Top 20 singles and three consecutive platinum selling albums, along with cyclic MTV rotation and radio airplay. Even after largely falling out from mainstream favour and chart success mostly because of the disastrous video for his 1984 hit \"Rock Me Tonite\", Squier has maintained his presence on the rock radio up to this day and attracted a strong cult following during the last decades, with his music being featured on many films and video games. Squier stepped out of music business after the release of his 1993 release ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]]'', but he has occasionally continued performing smaller tours and one-off performances.\n\nHis 1980 song \"The Big Beat\" is one of the most sampled drum breaks ever, being used by artists such as [[Run-DMC]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Jay-Z]], [[UTFO]] and [[Dizzee Rascal]], to name a few. \"The Stroke\" has also shared its fair amount of sampling, most notably in [[Eminem]]'s 2013 hit \"[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life and first bands (1950-1975) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as another story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971.\n\n=== Piper and solo career startoff (1975-1980) ===\nSquier had a short stint with a band called Sidewinders, but his first real experience with the music industry occurred when he left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait.'' The band was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper was managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. Squier served both as the main songwriter and frontman of the group, whose style shared similarities with power pop acts such as [[Cheap Trick]] and [[The Knack]], who were enjoying great success at the time.\n\nDespite receiving moderate success at the local rock scene, Piper broke up. Squier signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and started working on his solo debut ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'', which was released in spring 1980. The album provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Along with Chouinard, his backing band consisted of Alan St. Jon on keyboards, Cary Sharaf on lead guitar and [[Mark Clarke]] (who has previously had short jobs in [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]) on bass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success: ''Don't Say No'' and ''Emotions in Motion'' (1981-1983) ===\nFollowing a small but fairly successful summer tour with [[Alice Cooper]] in 1980, Squier got in contact with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]] and proposed him to produce his next album. Due to scheduling conflicts, May declined, but he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]], who had produced Queen's most recent album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack joined forces to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which attracted rave reviews and spawned three hit singles, catapulting him to stardom. The first, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well as charting high in Canada and even in Britain, where the song remains his only chart entry. \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-ups each. The album also featured \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", which became a radio favourite and one of his signature songs, despite not being released as a single (however, in Britain, it was featured as the b-side for \"In the Dark\"). Squier was also popular on the new MTV cable channel, where his straightforward performance-based videos received heavy rotation. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling over 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Retrospectively, ''Don't Say No'' is hailed as Squier's best solo album and one of the greatest rock albums of the 1980's.\n\nSquier was known for being a perfectionist and short-tempered at producers sometimes. He ended his partnership with Mack after disagreements between the two escalated because of artistic differences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> Despite the problems, Squier's third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became very successful - though in the long run, it didn't catch its predecessor in sales. Nevertheless, the album hit #5 in both US and Canada, sold approximately 3 million copies and spawned the successful radio and video hits \"[[Emotions in Motion (Billy Squier song)|Emotions in Motion]]\" and \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\". The latter is notable for being Squier's first #1 on the Mainstream Rock chart and holding the place for six weeks straight, more than any other number one in 1982. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 [[Hot Space Tour]] and during his own tour for ''Emotions'' he finally became an arena headliner and ascended into the heavyweight of early 80's hard rock. British newcomer [[Def Leppard]] supported him and he helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their breakthrough album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref>\n\n=== Career pinnacle and downfall: ''Signs of Life'' (1984)  ===\nSquier began to work on his fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' in late 1983. He planned [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]] - the man behind Def Leppard's wildly successful ''Pyromania -'' to produce the product, but he was already reserved by [[The Cars]] and suffered a breakdown afterward, which prompted Squier to continue his search just a few days before the sessions were set to start. He then brought in famed songwriter and producer [[Jim Steinman]], who was better known for his grandiose pop ballads and operatic rock songs. Both Squier's older fans and the music press reacted demurely to the Squier-Steinman team up, but since Squier admired Steinman's work on [[Meat Loaf]]'s ''[[Bat Out of Hell]] -'' which he had described as \"the most passionate and exciting rock record of our time\" - and Steinman was willing to work with a rock band, Squier stuck with him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/lick.htm|title=I'm Just Licking Them|website=Dream Pollution The Jim Steinman Web Site|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\nAt the time ''Signs of Life'' finally arrived in late July 1984, Squier was at the very peak of his career. Fueled by successful radio hits \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\" and \"All Night Long\", the album brought him his third consecutive platinum certification. However, Squier's fortunes took a sudden hit as soon as the homoerotic music video for \"Rock Me Tonite\", which actually had become his highest charting single in the US, premiered in the fall. It is best remembered for featuring Squier prancing around in a dark bedroom and ultimately tearing apart his ripped Emotions in Motion Tour tanktop, which he then replaces with a pink one. The video attracted embarrassed and negative responses from critics, fans, fellow musicians and Squier himself, who described it as \"diabolical\". It has been later cited as one of the worst music videos of all time.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales took a damage; ''Signs of Life'' ended up stalling at #11 on the Billboard 200 and he stopped selling out shows. Squier lost his patience: he fired both of his managers and insulted the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading and deceiving him and for altering his own original concepts. Whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'', let alone both the video and the song \"Rock Me Tonite\", made him look like a sellout for the most of his fans.\n\n=== Brief resurgence and departure from Capitol (1985-1993) ===\nApart from a few live appearances and a new song, \"Shake Down\" for the soundtrack of the film ''[[St. Elmo's Fire]]'', Squier stayed out of the spotlight for the majority of 1985, taking some time off and preparing his next album with British producer [[Peter Collins (record producer)|Peter Collins]], who was known for his work with [[Nik Kershaw]], [[Gary Moore]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlists/billy-squier-2bd680be.html|title=Billy Squier Concert Setlists (page 12)|website=setlist.fm|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://performingsongwriter.com/articles-interviews/producers-engineers/peter-collins/|title=An interview with Peter Collins|publisher=www.performingsongwriter.com}}</ref> 1986 saw the release of his fifth album ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'', which was carefully crafted but still a commercial flop. The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is the Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold an estimated 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. While the album was greeted with mostly warm reviews, many noted the lack of a clear hit and its amount of filler songs, though \"Love Is the Hero\" has been usually singled out for praise in usual reviews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicrockrevisited.com/show_review.php?id=910|title=CRR Review - Billy Squier - Enough is Enough/Hear & Now/Creatures of Habit|website=www.classicrockrevisited.com|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> Squier did not embark on a tour in support of the album.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989, after going through various delays. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''Enough Is Enough'' and is often regarded as one of the most consistent inputs of Squier's career by both fans and critics. It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"[[Don't Say You Love Me (Billy Squier song)|Don't Say You Love Me]]\", which peaked at #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart. It was his best charting single on both charts since 1984's \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Other notable tracks also included on the album are Squier's attempt on a late 80's power ballad, in the form of \"Don't Let Me Go\", as well as two [[Desmond Child]] collaborations \"Stronger\" and \"Tied Up\". All in all, the album did briefly restore Squier's success by returning to his early 1980's hard rock style. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's well received promotional tour, entitled All Excess, returned him on stages after almost five years of absence from touring. However, despite quite promising comeback chances, Squier wasn't able to pull off a notable return after the turn of the decade. In fact, the success of ''Hear & Now'' managed to just slow his ongoing popularity waning.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990's and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. Both critical and audience reception were mixed; many criticized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired mainly on the songwriting side. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature notable radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" and \"Facts of Life\". The former stands as Squier's last Top 5 hit on Mainstream Rock charts and his highest charting radio single of the 90's. ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last bigger one for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good. The album has subsequently spawned a strong cult reputation and one of its songs, \"The Girl's All Right\", was later resurrected for Squier's future concert setlists. The album's opening track, \"Angry\", was Squier's last Mainstream Rock hit.\n\n=== Later career (1994-) ===\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|date=February 18, 1998|newspaper=The New York Times|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He played a few dates in 1999 to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\", which was also included on the album as \"Stroke Me Blues\".\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier embarked on a concert tour that was his first bigger one since the 1991 tour for ''Creatures of Habit.''\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"{{sources|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J. Geils Band]]), the [[James Montgomery (singer)|James Montgomery Band]], [[Jon Butcher]], [[Sib Hashian]] ([[Boston (band)|Boston]]), [[Michael Carabello]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]]), the Uptown Horns and James Cotton. Squier accepted Cotton's invitation in June to join him at the \"James Cotton's Blues Summit\" at [[Lincoln Center]] in NYC, along with the legendary [[Pinetop Perkins]], [[Hubert Sumlin]] ([[Howlin' Wolf]]'s band), [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and many more. In November, Squier appeared at the [[Iridium Jazz Club|Iridium]] in New York and played a double set that night, \"Blues Deluxe,\" that showcased songs from his blues upbringing and new versions of several of his hits.\n\nShout!

His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"[[Love Is the Hero]]\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\". Squier's best selling album, 1981's [[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|''Don't Say No'']], is considered a landmark release within the arena rock genre and bridging the gap between power pop and hard rock.\n\nDescribed as a personification of early 80's rock music,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://open.spotify.com/artist/3Fz2GbraVXhcpXnoi2Oe1r|title=Billy Squier|website=Spotify|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref> Squier's most successful period ranges from 1981 to 1984, during which he scored five Top 10 Mainstream Rock hits (two of which were number ones), two Top 20 singles and three consecutive platinum selling albums, along with cyclic MTV rotation and radio airplay. Even after largely falling out from mainstream favour and chart success mostly because of the disastrous video for his 1984 hit \"Rock Me Tonite\", Squier has maintained his presence on the rock radio up to this day and attracted a strong cult following during the last decades, with his music being featured on many films and video games. Squier stepped out of music business after the release of his 1993 release ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]]'', but he has occasionally continued performing smaller tours and one-off performances.\n\nHis 1980 song \"The Big Beat\" is one of the most sampled drum breaks ever, being used by artists such as [[Run-DMC]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Jay-Z]], [[UTFO]] and [[Dizzee Rascal]], to name a few. \"The Stroke\" has also shared its fair amount of sampling, most notably in [[Eminem]]'s 2013 hit \"[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life and first bands (1950-1975) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as another story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971.\n\n=== Piper and solo career startoff (1975-1980) ===\nSquier had a short stint with a band called Sidewinders, but his first real experience with the music industry occurred when he left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait.'' The band was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper was managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. Squier served both as the main songwriter and frontman of the group, whose style shared similarities with power pop acts such as [[Cheap Trick]] and [[The Knack]], who were enjoying great success at the time.\n\nDespite receiving moderate success at the local rock scene, Piper broke up. Squier signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and started working on his solo debut ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'', which was released in spring 1980. The album provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Along with Chouinard, his backing band consisted of Alan St. Jon on keyboards, Cary Sharaf on lead guitar and [[Mark Clarke]] (who has previously had short jobs in [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]) on bass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success: ''Don't Say No'' and ''Emotions in Motion'' (1981-1983) ===\nFollowing a small but fairly successful summer tour with [[Alice Cooper]] in 1980, Squier got in contact with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]] and proposed him to produce his next album. Due to scheduling conflicts, May declined, but he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]], who had produced Queen's most recent album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack joined forces to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which attracted rave reviews and spawned three hit singles, catapulting him to stardom. The first, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well as charting high in Canada and even in Britain, where the song remains his only chart entry. \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-ups each. The album also featured \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", which became a radio favourite and one of his signature songs, despite not being released as a single (however, in Britain, it was featured as the b-side for \"In the Dark\"). Squier was also popular on the new MTV cable channel, where his straightforward performance-based videos received heavy rotation. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling over 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Retrospectively, ''Don't Say No'' is hailed as Squier's best solo album and one of the greatest rock albums of the 1980's.\n\nSquier was known for being a perfectionist and short-tempered at producers sometimes. He ended his partnership with Mack after disagreements between the two escalated because of artistic differences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> Despite the problems, Squier's third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became very successful - though in the long run, it didn't catch its predecessor in sales. Nevertheless, the album hit #5 in both US and Canada, sold approximately 3 million copies and spawned the successful radio and video hits \"[[Emotions in Motion (Billy Squier song)|Emotions in Motion]]\" and \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\". The latter is notable for being Squier's first #1 on the Mainstream Rock chart and holding the place for six weeks straight, more than any other number one in 1982. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 [[Hot Space Tour]] and during his own tour for ''Emotions'' he finally became an arena headliner and ascended into the heavyweight of early 80's hard rock. British newcomer [[Def Leppard]] supported him and he helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their breakthrough album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref>\n\n=== Career pinnacle and downfall: ''Signs of Life'' (1984)  ===\nSquier began to work on his fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' in late 1983. He planned [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]] - the man behind Def Leppard's wildly successful ''Pyromania -'' to produce the product, but he was already reserved by [[The Cars]] and suffered a breakdown afterward, which prompted Squier to continue his search just a few days before the sessions were set to start. He then brought in famed songwriter and producer [[Jim Steinman]], who was better known for his grandiose pop ballads and operatic rock songs. Both Squier's older fans and the music press reacted demurely to the Squier-Steinman team up, but since Squier admired Steinman's work on [[Meat Loaf]]'s ''[[Bat Out of Hell]] -'' which he had described as \"the most passionate and exciting rock record of our time\" - and Steinman was willing to work with a rock band, Squier stuck with him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/lick.htm|title=I'm Just Licking Them|website=Dream Pollution The Jim Steinman Web Site|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\nAt the time ''Signs of Life'' finally arrived in late July 1984, Squier was at the very peak of his career. Fueled by successful radio hits \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\" and \"All Night Long\", the album brought him his third consecutive platinum certification. However, Squier's fortunes took a sudden hit as soon as the homoerotic music video for \"Rock Me Tonite\", which actually had become his highest charting single in the US, premiered in the fall. It is best remembered for featuring Squier prancing around in a dark bedroom and ultimately tearing apart his ripped Emotions in Motion Tour tanktop, which he then replaces with a pink one. The video attracted embarrassed and negative responses from critics, fans, fellow musicians and Squier himself, who described it as \"diabolical\". It has been later cited as one of the worst music videos of all time.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales took a damage; ''Signs of Life'' ended up stalling at #11 on the Billboard 200 and he stopped selling out shows. Squier lost his patience: he fired both of his managers and insulted the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading and deceiving him and for altering his own original concepts. Whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'', let alone both the video and the song \"Rock Me Tonite\", made him look like a sellout for the most of his fans.\n\n=== Brief resurgance and departure from Capitol (1985-1993) ===\nApart from a few live appearances and a new song, \"Shake Down\" for the soundtrack of the film ''[[St. Elmo's Fire]]'', Squier stayed out of the spotlight for the majority of 1985, taking some time off and preparing his next album with British producer [[Peter Collins (record producer)|Peter Collins]], who was known for his work with [[Nik Kershaw]], [[Gary Moore]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlists/billy-squier-2bd680be.html|title=Billy Squier Concert Setlists (page 12)|website=setlist.fm|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://performingsongwriter.com/articles-interviews/producers-engineers/peter-collins/|title=An interview with Peter Collins|publisher=www.performingsongwriter.com}}</ref> 1986 saw the release of his fifth album ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'', which was carefully crafted but still a commercial flop. The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is the Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold an estimated 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. While the album was greeted with mostly warm reviews, many noted the lack of a clear hit and its amount of filler songs, though \"Love Is the Hero\" has been usually singled out for praise in usual reviews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicrockrevisited.com/show_review.php?id=910|title=CRR Review - Billy Squier - Enough is Enough/Hear & Now/Creatures of Habit|website=www.classicrockrevisited.com|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> Squier did not embark on a tour in support of the album.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989, after going through various delays. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''Enough Is Enough'' and is often regarded as one of the most consistent inputs of Squier's career by both fans and critics. It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"[[Don't Say You Love Me (Billy Squier song)|Don't Say You Love Me]]\", which peaked at #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart. It was his best charting single on both charts since 1984's \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Other notable tracks also included on the album are Squier's attempt on a late 80's power ballad, in the form of \"Don't Let Me Go\", as well as two [[Desmond Child]] collaborations \"Stronger\" and \"Tied Up\". All in all, the album did briefly restore Squier's success by returning to his early 1980's hard rock style. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's well received promotional tour, entitled All Excess, returned him on stages after almost five years of absence from touring. However, despite quite promising comeback chances, Squier wasn't able to pull off a notable return after the turn of the decade. In fact, the success of ''Hear & Now'' managed to just slow his ongoing popularity waning.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990's and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. Both critical and audience reception were mixed; many criticized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired mainly on the songwriting side. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature notable radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" and \"Facts of Life\". The former stands as Squier's last Top 5 hit on Mainstream Rock charts and his highest charting radio single of the 90's. ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last bigger one for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good. The album has subsequently spawned a strong cult reputation and one of its songs, \"The Girl's All Right\", was later resurrected for Squier's future concert setlists. The album's opening track, \"Angry\", was Squier's last Mainstream Rock hit.\n\n=== Later career (1994-) ===\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|date=February 18, 1998|newspaper=The New York Times|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He played a few dates in 1999 to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\", which was also included on the album as \"Stroke Me Blues\".\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier embarked on a concert tour that was his first bigger one since the 1991 tour for ''Creatures of Habit.''\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band.
