In [[Lebanon]] and [[Morocco]] the official language is [[Arabic language|Arabic]], but an additional de facto language is also [[French language|French]]. In [[New Zealand]], [[Maori language|Maori]] and [[New Zealand Sign Language]] are de jure official languages, while English is a de facto official language.

Law Dictionary, James A. Ballentine, Second Edition, 1948, p. 345.</ref>\n\nIn politics, a de facto leader of a country or region is one who has assumed authority, regardless of whether by lawful, constitutional, or legitimate means; very frequently, the term is reserved for those whose power is thought by some faction to be held by unlawful, unconstitutional, or otherwise illegitimate means, often because it had deposed a previous leader or undermined the rule of a current one. De facto leaders sometimes do not hold a constitutional office and may exercise power informally.\n\nNot all [[dictator]]s are de facto rulers. For example, [[Augusto Pinochet]] of [[Chile]] initially came to power as the chairperson of a [[military junta]], which briefly made him de facto leader of Chile, but he later amended the nation's constitution and made himself president until new elections were called, making him the formal and legal ruler of Chile. Similarly, [[Saddam Hussein]]'s formal rule of [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] is often recorded as beginning in 1979, the year he assumed the [[President of Iraq|Presidency of Iraq]]. However, his de facto rule of the nation began earlier: during his time as [[vice president]]; he exercised a great deal of power at the expense of the elderly [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]], the de jure president.\n\nIn [[Argentina]], the successive military coups that overthrew constitutional governments installed de facto governments in [[Jose Felix Uriburu|1930\u20131932]], [[Revolution of '43|1943\u20131946]], [[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora|1955\u20131958]], [[Revoluci\u00f3n Argentina|1966\u20131973]] and [[National Reorganization Process|1976\u20131983]], the last of which combined the powers of the [[President of Argentina|presidential office]] with those of the [[Argentine National Congress|National Congress]]. The subsequent legal analysis of the validity of such actions led to the formulation of a [[De facto government doctrine|doctrine of the de facto governments]], a [[case law]] ([[precedent]]ial) formulation which essentially said that the actions and decrees of past de facto governments, although not rooted in legal legitimacy when taken, remained binding until and unless such time as they were revoked or repealed de jure by a subsequent legitimate government.\n\nThat doctrine was nullified by the [[1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution|constitutional reform of 1994]]. Article 36 states:\n\n{{quote|\n*(1) This Constitution shall rule even when its observance is interrupted by acts of force against the institutional order and the democratic system. These acts shall be irreparably [[null and void|null]].\n*(2) Their authors shall be punished with the penalty foreseen in Section 29, disqualified in perpetuity from holding public offices and excluded from the benefits of [[pardon]] and [[Commutation of sentence|commutation]] of sentences.\n*(3) Those who, as a consequence of these acts, were to assume the powers foreseen for the authorities of this Constitution or for those of the provinces, shall be punished with the same penalties and shall be civil and criminally liable for their acts. The respective actions shall not be subject to prescription.\n*(4) All citizens shall have the right to oppose resistance to those committing the acts of force stated in this section.\n*(5) He who, procuring personal enrichment, incurs in serious fraudulent offense against the Nation shall also attempt subversion against the democratic system, and shall be disqualified to hold public office for the term specified by law.\n*(6) Congress shall enact a law on public [[ethics]] which shall rule the exercise of public office.\n}}\n\nIn 1526, after seizing power [[Imam]] [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] made his brother, [[Umar Din]], the de jure [[Sultan]] of the [[Adal Sultanate]]. Ahmad, however, was in all practice the de facto Sultan.<ref name=\"bvhlgfi\">{{cite web|title=A\u1e25mad Gr\u0101\u00f1 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/10110/Ahmad-Gran |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. |accessdate=2014-05-04}}</ref> Some other notable true de facto leaders have been [[Deng Xiaoping]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] and General [[Manuel Noriega]] of [[Panama]]. Both of these men exercised nearly all control over their respective nations for many years despite not having either legal constitutional office or the legal authority to exercise power. These individuals are today commonly recorded as the \"leaders\" of their respective nations; recording their legal, correct title would not give an accurate assessment of their power. Terms like ''[[strongman (politics)|strongman]]'' or ''dictator'' are often used to refer to de facto rulers of this sort. In the [[Soviet Union]], after [[Vladimir Lenin]] was incapacitated from a stroke in 1923, [[Joseph Stalin]]\u2014who, as [[General Secretary of the CPSU|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] had the power to appoint anyone he chose to top party positions\u2014eventually emerged as leader of the Party and the legitimate government. Until the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]] officially declared the Party \"...the vanguard of the working people\", thus legitimising Stalin's leadership, Stalin ruled the USSR as the de facto dictator.\n\nAnother example of a de facto ruler is someone who is not the actual ruler but exerts great or total influence over the true ruler, which is quite common in monarchies. Some examples of these de facto rulers are [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] of China (for son [[Tongzhi Emperor|Tongzhi]] and nephew [[Guangxu Emperor|Guangxu]] Emperors), Prince [[Alexander Danilovich Menshikov|Alexander Menshikov]] (for his former lover Empress [[Catherine I]] of Russia), [[Cardinal Richelieu]] of France (for [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]) and Queen [[Marie Caroline of Naples and Sicily]] (for her husband King [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies]]).\n\nThe term \"de facto head of state\" is sometimes used to describe the office of a [[governor general]] in the [[Commonwealth realm]]s, since a holder of that office has the same responsibilities in their country as the de jure head of state (the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|sovereign]]) does within the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nIn the [[Westminster system]] of government, [[executive (government)|executive]] authority is often split between a de jure executive authority of a [[head of state]] and a de facto executive authority of a [[prime minister]] and [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] who implement executive powers in the name of the de jure executive authority. In the United Kingdom, the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Sovereign]] is the de jure executive authority, even though executive decisions are made by the indirectly elected [[British Prime Minister|Prime Minister]] and her [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] on the Sovereign's behalf, hence the term [[Her Majesty's Government]].\n\nThe de facto boundaries of a country are defined by the area that its government is actually able to enforce its laws in, and to defend against encroachments by other countries that may also claim the same territory de jure. The [[Durand Line]] is an example of a de facto boundary. As well as cases of [[border dispute]]s, de facto boundaries may also arise in relatively unpopulated areas in which the border was never formally established or in which the agreed border was never surveyed and its exact position is unclear. The same concepts may also apply to a boundary between provinces or other subdivisions of a [[federation|federal state]].\n\n====Segregation====\nIn South Africa, although de jure [[apartheid]] formally began in 1948, de facto racist policies and practices discriminating against black South Africans, Coloureds, and Indians dated back decades before.<ref name=\"Introduction to Roman-Dutch Law\">{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoro00leeruoft |title=Introduction to Roman-Dutch Law |accessdate=27 March 2011 |author=R.W Lee |publisher=Oxford, Clarendon Press }}</ref><ref name=\"Afrikaner political thought: analysis and documents\">{{cite book |title=Afrikaner political thought: analysis and documents |author=A.

Only nine U.S. states and the District of Columbia still permit common-law marriage; but common law marriages are otherwise valid and recognised by and in all jurisdictions whose rules of comity mandate the recognition of any marriage that was legally formed in the jurisdiction where it was contracted.\n\n===Family law \u2013 custody===\nDe facto joint custody is comparable to the joint legal decision-making authority a married couple has over their child(ren) in many jurisdictions (Canada as an example).

In [[Singapore]], [[English language|English]] is the [[de jure]] language, but [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] are common de facto languages.\n\n[[Russian language|Russian]] was the de facto official language of the central government and, to a large extent, republican governments of the former [[Soviet Union]], but was not declared de jure state language until 1990. A short-lived law, effected April 24, 1990, installed Russian as the sole de jure official language of the Union.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestpravo.ru/ussr/data01/tex10935.htm |title=USSR Law \"On the Languages of the Peoples of USSR\" |date=April 24, 1990 |language=Russian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618042714/http://www.bestpravo.ru/ussr/data01/tex10935.htm |archivedate=2009-06-18 }}</ref>\n\n===Politics===\n{{Further|List of states with limited recognition|Proto-state|De facto embassy}}\n\nA de facto [[government]] is a government wherein all the attributes of sovereignty have, by usurpation, been transferred from those who had been legally invested with them to others, who, sustained by a power above the forms of law, claim to act and do really act in their stead.<ref>30 Am Jur 181. Law Dictionary, James A. Ballentine, Second Edition, 1948, p. 345.</ref>\n\nIn politics, a de facto leader of a country or region is one who has assumed authority, regardless of whether by lawful, constitutional, or legitimate means; very frequently, the term is reserved for those whose power is thought by some faction to be held by unlawful, unconstitutional, or otherwise illegitimate means, often because it had deposed a previous leader or undermined the rule of a current one. De facto leaders sometimes do not hold a constitutional office and may exercise power informally.\n\nNot all [[dictator]]s are de facto rulers. For example, [[Augusto Pinochet]] of [[Chile]] initially came to power as the chairperson of a [[military junta]], which briefly made him de facto leader of Chile, but he later amended the nation's constitution and made himself president until new elections were called, making him the formal and legal ruler of Chile. Similarly, [[Saddam Hussein]]'s formal rule of [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] is often recorded as beginning in 1979, the year he assumed the [[President of Iraq|Presidency of Iraq]]. However, his de facto rule of the nation began earlier: during his time as [[vice president]]; he exercised a great deal of power at the expense of the elderly [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]], the de jure president.\n\nIn [[Argentina]], the successive military coups that overthrew constitutional governments installed de facto governments in [[Jose Felix Uriburu|1930\u20131932]], [[Revolution of '43|1943\u20131946]], [[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora|1955\u20131958]], [[Revoluci\u00f3n Argentina|1966\u20131973]] and [[National Reorganization Process|1976\u20131983]], the last of which combined the powers of the [[President of Argentina|presidential office]] with those of the [[Argentine National Congress|National Congress]]. The subsequent legal analysis of the validity of such actions led to the formulation of a [[De facto government doctrine|doctrine of the de facto governments]], a [[case law]] ([[precedent]]ial) formulation which essentially said that the actions and decrees of past de facto governments, although not rooted in legal legitimacy when taken, remained binding until and unless such time as they were revoked or repealed de jure by a subsequent legitimate government.\n\nThat doctrine was nullified by the [[1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution|constitutional reform of 1994]]. Article 36 states:\n\n{{quote|\n*(1) This Constitution shall rule even when its observance is interrupted by acts of force against the institutional order and the democratic system. These acts shall be irreparably [[null and void|null]].\n*(2) Their authors shall be punished with the penalty foreseen in Section 29, disqualified in perpetuity from holding public offices and excluded from the benefits of [[pardon]] and [[Commutation of sentence|commutation]] of sentences.\n*(3) Those who, as a consequence of these acts, were to assume the powers foreseen for the authorities of this Constitution or for those of the provinces, shall be punished with the same penalties and shall be civil and criminally liable for their acts. The respective actions shall not be subject to prescription.\n*(4) All citizens shall have the right to oppose resistance to those committing the acts of force stated in this section.\n*(5) He who, procuring personal enrichment, incurs in serious fraudulent offense against the Nation shall also attempt subversion against the democratic system, and shall be disqualified to hold public office for the term specified by law.\n*(6) Congress shall enact a law on public [[ethics]] which shall rule the exercise of public office.\n}}\n\nIn 1526, after seizing power [[Imam]] [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] made his brother, [[Umar Din]], the de jure [[Sultan]] of the [[Adal Sultanate]]. Ahmad, however, was in all practice the de facto Sultan.<ref name=\"bvhlgfi\">{{cite web|title=A\u1e25mad Gr\u0101\u00f1 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/10110/Ahmad-Gran |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. |accessdate=2014-05-04}}</ref> Some other notable true de facto leaders have been [[Deng Xiaoping]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] and General [[Manuel Noriega]] of [[Panama]]. Both of these men exercised nearly all control over their respective nations for many years despite not having either legal constitutional office or the legal authority to exercise power. These individuals are today commonly recorded as the \"leaders\" of their respective nations; recording their legal, correct title would not give an accurate assessment of their power. Terms like ''[[strongman (politics)|strongman]]'' or ''dictator'' are often used to refer to de facto rulers of this sort. In the [[Soviet Union]], after [[Vladimir Lenin]] was incapacitated from a stroke in 1923, [[Joseph Stalin]]\u2014who, as [[General Secretary of the CPSU|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] had the power to appoint anyone he chose to top party positions\u2014eventually emerged as leader of the Party and the legitimate government. Until the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]] officially declared the Party \"...the vanguard of the working people\", thus legitimising Stalin's leadership, Stalin ruled the USSR as the de facto dictator.\n\nAnother example of a de facto ruler is someone who is not the actual ruler but exerts great or total influence over the true ruler, which is quite common in monarchies. Some examples of these de facto rulers are [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] of China (for son [[Tongzhi Emperor|Tongzhi]] and nephew [[Guangxu Emperor|Guangxu]] Emperors), Prince [[Alexander Danilovich Menshikov|Alexander Menshikov]] (for his former lover Empress [[Catherine I]] of Russia), [[Cardinal Richelieu]] of France (for [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]) and Queen [[Marie Caroline of Naples and Sicily]] (for her husband King [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies]]).\n\nThe term \"de facto head of state\" is sometimes used to describe the office of a [[governor general]] in the [[Commonwealth realm]]s, since a holder of that office has the same responsibilities in their country as the de jure head of state (the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|sovereign]]) does within the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nIn the [[Westminster system]] of government, [[executive (government)|executive]] authority is often split between a de jure executive authority of a [[head of state]] and a de facto executive authority of a [[prime minister]] and [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] who implement executive powers in the name of the de jure executive authority. In the United Kingdom, the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Sovereign]] is the de jure executive authority, even though executive decisions are made by the indirectly elected [[British Prime Minister|Prime Minister]] and her [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] on the Sovereign's behalf, hence the term [[Her Majesty's Government]].\n\nThe de facto boundaries of a country are defined by the area that its government is actually able to enforce its laws in, and to defend against encroachments by other countries that may also claim the same territory de jure. The [[Durand Line]] is an example of a de facto boundary. As well as cases of [[border dispute]]s, de facto boundaries may also arise in relatively unpopulated areas in which the border was never formally established or in which the agreed border was never surveyed and its exact position is unclear. The same concepts may also apply to a boundary between provinces or other subdivisions of a [[federation|federal state]].\n\n====Segregation====\nIn South Africa, although de jure [[apartheid]] formally began in 1948, de facto racist policies and practices discriminating against black South Africans, Coloureds, and Indians dated back decades before.<ref name=\"Introduction to Roman-Dutch Law\">{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoro00leeruoft |title=Introduction to Roman-Dutch Law |accessdate=27 March 2011 |author=R.W Lee |publisher=Oxford, Clarendon Press }}</ref><ref name=\"Afrikaner political thought: analysis and documents\">{{cite book |title=Afrikaner political thought: analysis and documents |author=A.

Common law norms for settling disputes in practical situations, often worked out over many generations to establishing [[precedent]], are a core element informing decision making in [[legal system]]s around the world.

See the section on [[Family Court of Australia]] for further explanation on jurisdiction on de facto relationships.\n\nThis is unlike marriage and \"matrimonial causes\" which are recognised by sections 51(xxi) and (xxii) of the [[Constitution of Australia]]<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html Section 51], [[Australian Constitution]]</ref> and internationally by [[marriage law]] and conventions, [[International matrimonial law|Hague Convention on Marriages]] (1978).<ref name=\"Hague Convention\">[http://www.legallanguage.com/resources/treaties/hague/1978-march-14th-convention-2 Hague Convention on Marriages 1978]</ref>\n\n===Non-marital relationship contract===\nA de facto relationship is comparable to non-marital relationship contracts (sometimes called \"palimony agreements\") and certain limited forms of domestic partnership, which are found in many jurisdictions throughout the world.\n\nA de facto Relationship is not comparable to [[common-law marriage]], which is a fully legal marriage that has merely been contracted in an irregular way (including by habit and repute). Only nine U.S. states and the District of Columbia still permit common-law marriage; but common law marriages are otherwise valid and recognised by and in all jurisdictions whose rules of comity mandate the recognition of any marriage that was legally formed in the jurisdiction where it was contracted.\n\n===Family law \u2013 custody===\nDe facto joint custody is comparable to the joint legal decision-making authority a married couple has over their child(ren) in many jurisdictions (Canada as an example).

She was later fired for incompetency as head of [[Brisbane Girls' Grammar School]]. Within a month she had founded what became the leading Brisbane secondary school for girls (which is now known as [[Somerville House]]).\n\n==Life==\nFewings was born in [[Bristol]] in south west England in 1857. Her father was in the boot industry but her brother was a teacher and he assisted her to become a teacher too.\n[[file:Dolgellau 20-03-31 5-09-35 pm.png|left|thumb|[[Dr Williams' School]] in Dolgellau in 1876]]\nIn 1876 she became the head of [[Dr Williams' School|Dr Williams's Endowed High School for Girls]] in [[Dolgellau]].

Two of the governors who were leading barristers interviewed her and they decided that she should be dismissed. Her request for a review of the decision was refused.<ref name=Ozbio/> When the trustees turned up to ensure that Fewings handed over the keys to the school they were met by the local press.

Instead, the story is told by a [[voice-over]] narrator. The film's soundtrack is almost entirely [[non-diegetic]], comprising electronic and industrial elements composed in [[5.1 surround sound]] to bring depth to the flat, wide-angle CCTV images, contrasted with predominantly stereophonic solo piano recordings by [[Rupert Huber]].\n\n==Critical analysis and interpretation==\n===Form and aesthetics===\nIn his essay 'Within the apparatus of control. On the enduring fascination of surveillance aesthetics',<ref name=\"RS\">[https://www.springerin.at/en/2008/4/im-dispositiv-der-kontrolle/ Roland Sch\u00f6ny.  'Within the apparatus of control. On the enduring fascination of surveillance aesthetics.' Translated by Helen Ferguson],</ref> Roland Sch\u00f6ny observes that the visual aesthetic of ''Faceless'' 'stems from the spatial apparatus of technical surveillance via the eye of the camera, [and is] reminiscent of early forms of [[video art]]. The images seem to stem from the past future (...) A constantly flickering image, colour distortion and fragmented sequences, complete with a visible time-code, are all significant elements in this semantic code.' Moreover, '[a]ttention is focused just as much on bustling areas, like underground stations or shopping malls, as on lonely car parks, underground garages or the parched periphery of housing estates, not to mention office premises or lobbies.'<ref name = \"RS\"/> Andersen and Pold also remark on the perspective of the surveillance camera aimed at 'capturing as much of reality as possible, in contrast to the subjective camera conventionally used in films.'<ref>Andersen, Christian Ulrik and Pold, Bro S\u00f8ren. ''The Metainterface: The Art of Platforms, Cities, and Clouds''. MIT Press, 2018, pp.97.</ref>\n\nSeveral commentators have noted that Luksch's film pays evident homage to [[Chris Marker]]'s 1962 film ''[[La Jet\u00e9e]]'' in its visual pacing and linguistic style.<ref>Thomsen, Bodil Marie. \"The Performative Uses of the Surveillance Archive in Manu Luksch's Works.\" ''Performing Archives / Archives of Performance,'' edited by Borggreen, Gunhild and Rune Gade, Museum Tusculanum Press, 2013, pp. 257-273.</ref> Eric Cazdyn, Professor of Aesthetics and Politics at the University of Toronto, remarks on the two films' complementarity: 'In ''La Jet\u00e9e'' we have a single temporality occurring at different times, while in ''Faceless'' we have different temporalities occurring at the same time.'<ref>Cazdyn, Eric. ''The Already Dead. The New Time of Politics, Culture, and Illness.'' Duke UP, 2012, p. 97.</ref> Another influence on ''Faceless'' is evident in the ensemble dance sequences, which draw on the kaleidoscopic choreography of [[Busby Berkeley]]'s musicals.<ref>''The Eye \u2013 Choreography for Surveilled Space.'' Directed by Manu Luksch. UK, 2005. Available on the ''Faceless'' DVD.</ref>\n\nWhereas Sch\u00f6ny summarises ''Faceless'' as a 'poetic narrative on the disappearance of history and identity in the panoptic era,'<ref name=\"RS\"/> the writer and producer Robert Buchschwenter characterises it more forcefully as a traumatising 'metanarrative \u0096of a society whose self-understanding is occluded by its dazzling media hyperpresence.'<ref>Buchschwenter, Robert. \"Angstbilder gegen die Angst.\" Translated by Steve Wilder as \"Images of Fear, against Fear.\" ''Ambient Information Systems,'' edited by Luksch, Manu and Mukul Patel, AIS, 2009, pp. 268-69.</ref>\n\n===Filmmaking as d\u00e9tournement===\nLuksch uses the term 'tactical fiction' to describe an approach that hybridizes documentary and fiction to interrogate infrastructure and provoke reflection. Elizabeth Cowie remarks that the film is both 'an actual reality of the ordinary spaces of the city [...], and a fictional world'<ref>Cowie, Elizabeth. 'The World Viewed: Documentary Observing and the Culture of Surveillance'. In Juhasz, Alexandra and Lebow, Alisa (Editors). ''A Companion to Contemporary Documentary Film.'' Wiley Blackwell, 2015, p. 597.</ref> Through its manifesto-driven legal process, ''Faceless'' bridges fact and fiction and accomplishes a [[d\u00e9tournement]], or activist hijacking of the surveillance apparatus. Art and communication scholar Margarida Carvalho locates the work's force in its diversion of CCTV networks 'from their explicit purpose [...], endowing them with an experimental, artistic and activist dimension. [...The] city is transformed into a permanent film set and the act of creation becomes a gesture of appropriation and transformation of the omnipresent gaze of the surveillance cameras. In this context to create is to affectively populate a territory, to rescue it from the barrenness and lethargy in which the non-reciprocated gaze of the surveillance cameras had plunged it.'<ref name=\"M\">[http://www.inflexions.org/n3_carvalhohtml.html Carvalho, Margarida. \"Affective Territories.\" ''INFLeXions No. 3 - Micropolitics: Exploring Ethico-Aesthetics,'' edited by Himada, Nasrin, Erin Manning and Leslie Plumb, October 2009. Retrieved 6 September 2017.]</ref> Carvalho further suggests that the film's ensemble dance sequences express a 'strangeness and poetic activism, evoking the contradictory forces that connect us to the spaces we so often cross and forget to inhabit.'<ref name=\"M\"/>\n\n==Release==\nSince its festival release in 2007, ''Faceless'' continues to be shown regularly in film and art contexts. Notable public screenings include the [[Diagonale]] [[film festival]], Graz and ''Goodbye Privacy'' at [[Ars Electronica]], Linz in 2007; ''Plan\u00e8te Marker'' at [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris, ''Urban Wandering'' at the [[Barbican Centre]], London and ''Momentum: Women/Art/Technology'' at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], New York in 2013; and ''Watched!'' at the [[Hasselblad Foundation]], G\u00f6teborg in 2016.\n\n===Home media===\nThe film is published via online streaming service flimmit and as a DVD with additional features, subtitles in Albanian, Bulgarian, Czech, English, French, German, Italian and Spanish, and a Dolby surround 5.1 soundtrack.\n\n===Public collections===\n''Faceless'' is included in the collections of the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]]<ref>[https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/ressource.action?param.id=FR_R-1920f1ccecc9389b4c98b7fde87bd64&param.idSource=FR_O-5f2455673af9e8984996207d31dc170/ ''Faceless'' in the Collection Centre Pompidou]</ref> and the [[BFI National Archive]]<ref>[https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/59ba5c76630ca ''Faceless'' at the BFI National Archive]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/oct/13/art.humanrights Hubert, Andrea. \u201cFilm stars of CCTV.\u201d ''The Guardian,'' 13 October 2007.]\n*[http://www.liberation.fr/ecrans/2007/09/05/la-surveillance-est-une-activite-qui-genere-une-architecture-totalitaire_956824?page=article Lechner, Marie. \u201cLa surveillance est une activit\u00e9 qui g\u00e9n\u00e8re une architecture totalitaire.\u201d ''Lib\u00e9ration,'' 5 September 2007.]\n*[http://www.ambienttv.net/content/?q=node/584 Sch\u00f6ny, Roland. \u201cIm Dispositiv der Kontrolle.

Translated by Helen Ferguson],</ref> Roland Sch\u00f6ny observes that the visual aesthetic of ''Faceless'' 'stems from the spatial apparatus of technical surveillance via the eye of the camera, [and is] reminiscent of early forms of [[video art]]. The images seem to stem from the past future (...) A constantly flickering image, colour distortion and fragmented sequences, complete with a visible time-code, are all significant elements in this semantic code.' Moreover, '[a]ttention is focused just as much on bustling areas, like underground stations or shopping malls, as on lonely car parks, underground garages or the parched periphery of housing estates, not to mention office premises or lobbies.'<ref name = \"RS\"/> Andersen and Pold also remark on the perspective of the surveillance camera aimed at 'capturing as much of reality as possible, in contrast to the subjective camera conventionally used in films.'<ref>Andersen, Christian Ulrik and Pold, Bro S\u00f8ren. ''The Metainterface: The Art of Platforms, Cities, and Clouds''. MIT Press, 2018, pp.97.</ref>\n\nSeveral commentators have noted that Luksch's film pays evident homage to [[Chris Marker]]'s 1962 film ''[[La Jet\u00e9e]]'' in its visual pacing and linguistic style.<ref>Thomsen, Bodil Marie. \"The Performative Uses of the Surveillance Archive in Manu Luksch's Works.\" ''Performing Archives / Archives of Performance,'' edited by Borggreen, Gunhild and Rune Gade, Museum Tusculanum Press, 2013, pp. 257-273.</ref> Eric Cazdyn, Professor of Aesthetics and Politics at the University of Toronto, remarks on the two films' complementarity: 'In ''La Jet\u00e9e'' we have a single temporality occurring at different times, while in ''Faceless'' we have different temporalities occurring at the same time.'<ref>Cazdyn, Eric. ''The Already Dead. The New Time of Politics, Culture, and Illness.'' Duke UP, 2012, p. 97.</ref> Another influence on ''Faceless'' is evident in the ensemble dance sequences, which draw on the kaleidoscopic choreography of [[Busby Berkeley]]'s musicals.<ref>''The Eye \u2013 Choreography for Surveilled Space.'' Directed by Manu Luksch. UK, 2005. Available on the ''Faceless'' DVD.</ref>\n\nWhereas Sch\u00f6ny summarises ''Faceless'' as a 'poetic narrative on the disappearance of history and identity in the panoptic era,'<ref name=\"RS\"/> the writer and producer Robert Buchschwenter characterises it more forcefully as a traumatising 'metanarrative \u0096of a society whose self-understanding is occluded by its dazzling media hyperpresence.'<ref>Buchschwenter, Robert. \"Angstbilder gegen die Angst.\" Translated by Steve Wilder as \"Images of Fear, against Fear.\" ''Ambient Information Systems,'' edited by Luksch, Manu and Mukul Patel, AIS, 2009, pp. 268-69.</ref>\n\n===Filmmaking as d\u00e9tournement===\nLuksch uses the term 'tactical fiction' to describe an approach that hybridizes documentary and fiction to interrogate infrastructure and provoke reflection. Elizabeth Cowie remarks that the film is both 'an actual reality of the ordinary spaces of the city [...], and a fictional world'<ref>Cowie, Elizabeth. 'The World Viewed: Documentary Observing and the Culture of Surveillance'. In Juhasz, Alexandra and Lebow, Alisa (Editors). ''A Companion to Contemporary Documentary Film.'' Wiley Blackwell, 2015, p. 597.</ref> Through its manifesto-driven legal process, ''Faceless'' bridges fact and fiction and accomplishes a [[d\u00e9tournement]], or activist hijacking of the surveillance apparatus. Art and communication scholar Margarida Carvalho locates the work's force in its diversion of CCTV networks 'from their explicit purpose [...], endowing them with an experimental, artistic and activist dimension. [...The] city is transformed into a permanent film set and the act of creation becomes a gesture of appropriation and transformation of the omnipresent gaze of the surveillance cameras. In this context to create is to affectively populate a territory, to rescue it from the barrenness and lethargy in which the non-reciprocated gaze of the surveillance cameras had plunged it.'<ref name=\"M\">[http://www.inflexions.org/n3_carvalhohtml.html Carvalho, Margarida. \"Affective Territories.\" ''INFLeXions No. 3 - Micropolitics: Exploring Ethico-Aesthetics,'' edited by Himada, Nasrin, Erin Manning and Leslie Plumb, October 2009. Retrieved 6 September 2017.]</ref> Carvalho further suggests that the film's ensemble dance sequences express a 'strangeness and poetic activism, evoking the contradictory forces that connect us to the spaces we so often cross and forget to inhabit.'<ref name=\"M\"/>\n\n==Release==\nSince its festival release in 2007, ''Faceless'' continues to be shown regularly in film and art contexts.

Prem Kumar ([[Vijay Sethupathi]]) is set to marry his lover Dhanalakshmi ([[Gayathrie Shankar]]).

The game gets a little serious as Prem, in a bid to catch a ball, falls down, only to get injured in his head. He quickly gets back on his toes as the injury is not serious. Soon after the match, the friends are in for a shock. Due to the injury, Prem develops [[retrograde amnesia]] and [[short-term memory loss]], wherein he remembers the chain of events which leads to the injury but forgets the last one year of his life and fails to remember everything after the injury. He remembers his life until college and recognizes his friends but is clueless about his upcoming wedding and about Dhana herself, as it is during the last one year that he met her, fell in love with her, and decided to marry her. Fearing trouble, his friends take him to a doctor, who says that he could recover anytime. Hence, his friends plan to keep him in their company, enact a drama until he ties the wedding knot, with the hope that he would get back his memory soon, while covering his disorder from everyone else. In the end, everything works out well, and Prem gets his memory back.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vijay Sethupathi]] as C.

The game gets a little serious as Prem, in a bid to catch a ball, falls down, only to get injured in his head. He quickly gets back on his toes as the injury is not serious. Soon after the match, the friends are in for a shock. Due to the injury, Prem develops [[retrograde amnesia]] and [[short-term memory loss]], wherein he remembers the chain of events which leads to the injury but forgets the last one year of his life and fails to remember everything after the injury. He remembers his life until college and recognizes his friends but is clueless about his upcoming wedding and about Dhana herself, as it is during the last one year that he met her, fell in love with her, and decided to marry her. Fearing trouble, his friends take him to a doctor, who says that he could recover anytime. Hence, his friends plan to keep him in their company, enact a drama until he ties the wedding knot, with the hope that he would get back his memory soon, while covering his disorder from everyone else. In the end, everything works out well, and Prem gets his memory back.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vijay Sethupathi]] as C.

Most were first settled along the [[Hudson River]] in work camps, to pay off their passage. By 1711, seven villages had been established in New York on the [[Robert Livingston the Elder|Robert Livingston]] manor. In 1723 Germans became the first Europeans allowed to buy land in the [[Mohawk Valley]] west of [[Little Falls (town), New York|Little Falls]]. One hundred homesteads were allocated in the Burnetsfield Patent. By 1750, the Germans occupied a strip some {{convert|12|mi|km}} long along both sides of the [[Mohawk River]]. The soil was excellent; some 500 houses were built, mostly of stone, and the region prospered in spite of Indian raids.

Of the over 5,000 Germans initially immigrating primarily from the Alsace Region as few as 500 made up the first wave of immigrants to leave France en route to the Americas. Less than 150 of those first indentured German farmers made it to Louisiana and settled along what became known as the German Coast. With tenacity, determination and the leadership of D'arensburg these Germans felled trees, cleared land, and cultivated the soil with simple hand tools as draft animals were not available. The German coast settlers supplied the budding City of New Orleans with corn, rice, eggs. and meat for many years following.\n\nThe [[Mississippi Company]] settled thousands of German pioneers in [[France|French]] [[Louisiana]] during 1721. It encouraged Germans, particularly Germans of the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] region who had recently fallen under French rule, and the [[Swiss people|Swiss]] to immigrate. [[Alsace]] was sold to France within the greater context of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648).\n\nThe [[Jesuit]] [[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Xavier de Charlevoix|Charlevoix]] traveled [[New France]] ([[Canada]] and Louisiana) in the early 1700s.

Politically, they were generally inactive until 1740, when they joined a [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]]-led coalition that took control of the legislature, which later supported the [[American Revolution]]. Despite this, many of the German settlers were [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalists]] during the Revolution, possibly because they feared their royal land grants would be taken away by a new republican government, or because of loyalty to a British German monarchy who had provided the opportunity to live in a liberal society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sciway3.net/clark/revolutionarywar/loyalists.html|title=Loyalists (Royalists, Tories) in South Carolina|website=Sciway3.net|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> The Germans, comprising [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Calvinism|Reformed]], [[Mennonite]]s, [[Amish]], and other sects, developed a rich religious life with a strong musical culture.

As in [[Milwaukee]], Germans in Houston built the brewing industry. By the 1920s, the first generation of college-educated German Americans were moving into the chemical and oil industries.<ref name=\"Conzen\"/>\n\nTexas had about 20,000 German Americans in the 1850s. They did not form a uniform bloc, but were highly diverse and drew from geographic areas and all sectors of European society, except that very few aristocrats or upper middle class businessmen arrived. In this regard, Texas Germania was a microcosm of the Germania nationwide.\n\n<blockquote>The Germans who settled Texas were diverse in many ways. They included peasant farmers and intellectuals; Protestants, Catholics, Jews, and atheists; Prussians, Saxons, and Hessians; abolitionists and slave owners; farmers and townsfolk; frugal, honest folk and ax murderers. They differed in dialect, customs, and physical features. A majority had been farmers in Germany, and most arrived seeking economic opportunities. A few dissident intellectuals fleeing the 1848 revolutions sought political freedom, but few, save perhaps the Wends, went for religious freedom. The German settlements in Texas reflected their diversity. Even in the confined area of the Hill Country, each valley offered a different kind of German. The Llano valley had stern, teetotaling German Methodists, who renounced dancing and fraternal organizations; the Pedernales valley had fun-loving, hardworking Lutherans and Catholics who enjoyed drinking and dancing; and the Guadalupe valley had freethinking Germans descended from intellectual political refugees. The scattered German ethnic islands were also diverse.

Their ancestors had come from all over the German-speaking world, invited by [[Catherine the Great]] in 1762 and 1763 to settle and introduce more advanced German agriculture methods to rural Russia. They had been promised by the manifesto of their settlement the ability to practice their respective Christian denominations, retain their culture and language, and retain immunity from conscription for them and their descendants. As time passed, the Russian monarchy gradually eroded the ethnic German population's relative autonomy. Conscription eventually was reinstated; this was especially harmful to the Mennonites, who practice pacifism. Throughout the 19th century, pressure increased from the Russian government to culturally assimilate. Many Germans from Russia found it necessary to emigrate to avoid conscription and preserve their culture. About 100,000 immigrated by 1900, settling primarily in the Dakotas, Kansas and Nebraska. The southern central part of North Dakota was known as \"the German-Russian triangle\". A smaller number moved farther west, finding employment as ranchers and cowboys.\n\nNegatively influenced by the violation of their rights and cultural persecution by the [[Tsar]], the Germans from Russia who settled in the northern [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] saw themselves a downtrodden ethnic group separate from Russian Americans and having an entirely different experience from the German Americans who had emigrated from German lands; they settled in tight-knit communities who retained their German language and culture. They raised large families, built German-style churches, buried their dead in distinctive cemeteries using cast iron grave markers, and sang German hymns. Many farmers specialized in sugar beets\u2014still a major crop in the upper Great Plains. During World War{{nbsp}}I, their identity was challenged by [[anti-German sentiment]]. By the end of World War{{nbsp}}II, the German language, which had always been used with English for public and official matters, was in serious decline. Today, German is preserved mainly through singing groups and recipes, with the Germans from Russia in the northern Great Plains states speaking predominantly English. German remains the second most spoken language in North and South Dakota, and Germans from Russia often use [[loanword]]s, such as ''Kuchen'' for cake. Despite the loss of their language, the ethnic group remains distinct, and has left a lasting impression on the American West.<ref>Elwyn B.

While they needed profits to stay in operation, they used profits as a tool \"to maintain continuity of the family\".<ref>Sonya Salamon, ''Prairie Patrimony: Family, Farming, and Community in the Midwest'' (U. of North Carolina Press, 1992) pp. 53, 101</ref> They used risk averse strategies, and carefully planned their inheritances to keep the land in the family. Their communities showed smaller average farm size, greater equality, less absentee ownership and greater geographic persistence. As one farmer explained, \"To protect your family has turned out to be the same thing as protecting your land.\"<ref>Salamon, ''Prairie Patrimony'' p 101</ref>\n\nGermany was a large country with many diverse subregions which contributed immigrants. Dubuque was the base of the ''Ostfriesische Nachrichten'' (\"East Fresian News\") from 1881 to 1971. It connected the 20,000 immigrants from East Friesland (Ostfriesland), Germany, to each other across the Midwest, and to their old homeland. In Germany East Friesland was often a topic of ridicule regarding backward rustics, but editor Leupke H\u00fcndling shrewdly combined stories of proud memories of Ostfriesland. The editor enlisted a network of local correspondents. By mixing local American and local German news, letters, poetry, fiction, and dialogue, the German-language newspaper allowed immigrants to honor their origins and celebrate their new life as highly prosperous farmers with much larger farms than were possible back in impoverished Ostfriesland. During the world wars, when Germania came under heavy attack, the paper stressed its humanitarian role, mobilizing readers to help the people of East Friesland with relief funds. Younger generations could usually speak German but not read it, so the subscription based dwindled away as the target audience Americanized itself.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 27501458|title = Heimat in the Heartland: The Significance of an Ethnic Newspaper|journal = Journal of American Ethnic History|volume = 23|issue = 3|pages = 78\u201398|last1 = Lindaman|first1 = Matthew|year = 2004}}</ref>\n\n====Politics====\nRelatively few German Americans held office, but the men voted once they became citizens. In general during the [[Third party System]] (1850s\u20131890s), the Protestants and Jews leaned toward the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] and the Catholics were strongly [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]. When [[prohibition]] was on the ballot, the Germans voted solidly against it. They strongly distrusted moralistic crusaders, whom they called \"Puritans\", including the temperance reformers and many [[Populist Party (United States)|Populists]]. The German community strongly opposed [[Free Silver]], and voted heavily against crusader [[William Jennings Bryan]] in 1896. In 1900, many German Democrats returned to their party and voted for Bryan, perhaps because of President [[William McKinley]]'s foreign policy.<ref name=\"Jensen1971\">{{cite book|author=Richard J.

The German Americans had voted 80 percent for Lincoln in 1860, and strongly supported the war effort. They were a bastion of the Republican Party in St. Louis and nearby immigrant strongholds in Missouri and southern Illinois. The German Americans were angered by a proposed Missouri state constitution that discriminated against Catholics and freethinkers. The requirement of a special loyalty oath for priests and ministers was troublesome. Despite their strong opposition the constitution was ratified in 1865. Racial tensions with the blacks began to emerge, especially in terms of competition for unskilled labor jobs. Germania was nervous about black suffrage in 1868, fearing that blacks would support puritanical laws, especially regarding the prohibition of beer gardens on Sundays. The tensions split off a large German element in 1872, led by Carl Schurz. They supported the Liberal Republican party led by [[Benjamin Gratz Brown]] for governor in 1870 and [[Horace Greeley]] for president in 1872.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 27501880|title = German Americans, African Americans, and the Republican Party in St. Louis, 1865-1872|journal = Journal of American Ethnic History|volume = 28|issue = 1|pages = 34\u201351|last1 = Anderson|first1 = Kristen L.|year = 2008}}</ref>\n\nMany Germans in late 19th century cities were communists; Germans played a significant role in the labor union movement.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dorothee Schneider|title=Trade Unions and Community: The German Working Class in New York City, 1870-1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ATL_3v4_PkwC&pg=PA36|year=1994|page=36|isbn=9780252020575}}</ref><ref>Hartmut Keil, and John B.

German Americans in many cities, such as [[Milwaukee]], brought their strong support of education, establishing German-language schools and teacher training seminaries (''T\u00f6chter-Institut'') to prepare students and teachers in German language training. By the late 19th century, the Germania Publishing Company was established in Milwaukee, a publisher of books, magazines, and newspapers in German.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uwm.edu/~margo/sympapers/Ortlepp.htm|title=Deutsch-Athen Revisited{{nbsp}}...|website=Uwm.edu|accessdate=28 August 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207173929/http://www.uwm.edu/~margo/sympapers/Ortlepp.htm|archivedate=7 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n\"Germania\" was the common term for German American neighborhoods and their organizations.<ref>Noel Iverson, ''Germania, U.S.A.'' (1966).</ref> ''Deutschtum'' was the term for transplanted German nationalism, both culturally and politically. Between 1875 and 1915, the German American population in the United States doubled, and many of its members insisted on maintaining their culture. German was used in local schools and churches, while numerous ''Vereine'', associations dedicated to literature, humor, gymnastics, and singing, sprang up in German American communities. German Americans tended to support the German government's actions, and, even after the United States entered World War{{nbsp}}I, they often voted for antidraft and antiwar candidates. 'Deutschtum' in the United States disintegrated after 1918.<ref>Andrew Yox, \"The German-American Community as a Nationality, 1880-1940\", ''Yearbook of German-American Studies'' 2001 36: 181-193; Kazal (2004)</ref>\n\n===Music===\nBeginning in 1741, the German-speaking [[Moravian Church]] Settlements of [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]], [[Nazareth, Pennsylvania|Nazareth]] and [[Lititz, Pennsylvania|Lititz]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Wachovia, North Carolina|Wachovia]] in North Carolina had highly developed musical cultures. Choral music, Brass and String Music and Congregational singing were highly cultivated. The Moravian Church produced many composers and musicians. [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]'s ''Creation'' had its American debut in Bethlehem in the early 19th century.\n\nThe spiritual beliefs of Johann Conrad Beissel (1690\u20131768) and the Ephrata Cloister\u2014such as the asceticism and mysticism of this Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, group - are reflected in Beissel's treatises on music and hymns, which have been considered the beginning of America's musical heritage.<ref>Lucile E. Hackett, \"Johann Conrad Beissel: Early German-American Mystic and Musician\", ''Studies in Puritan American Spirituality'' 1995 5: 95\u2013121</ref>\n\nIn most major cities, Germans took the lead in creating a musical culture, with popular bands, singing societies, operas and symphonic orchestras.<ref>Philip V.

The first began in 1855; the last folded in 1961. An important aspect of Wheeling social life, these societies reflected various social classes and enjoyed great popularity until anti-German sentiments during World War{{nbsp}}I and changing social values dealt them a death blow.<ref>Edward C. Wolf, \"Wheeling's German Singing Societies\", ''West Virginia History'' 1980\u20131981 42(1\u20132): 1\u201356</ref>\n\nThe Liederkranz, a German-American music society, played an important role in the integration of the German community into the life of [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. Started in 1848, the organization was strengthened by the arrival of German liberals after the failure of the revolution of that year. By the mid-1850s the Germans formed one-third of Louisville's population and faced nativist hostility organized in the Know-Nothing movement. Violent demonstrations forced the chorus to suppress publicity of its performances that included works by composer Richard Wagner. The Liederkranz suspended operations during the Civil War, but afterward grew rapidly, and was able to build a large auditorium by 1873. An audience of 8,000 that attended a performance in 1877 demonstrated that the Germans were an accepted part of Louisville life.<ref>Erna Ottl Gwinn, \"The Liederkranz in Louisville, 1848\u20131877\", ''Filson Club History Quarterly'' 1975 49(3): 276\u2013290,</ref>\n\nThe Imperial government in Berlin promoted German culture in the U.S., especially music. A steady influx of German-born conductors, including Arthur Nikisch and Karl Muck, spurred the reception of German music in the United States, while German musicians seized on Victorian Americans' growing concern with 'emotion'. The performance of pieces such as Beethoven's ''Ninth Symphony'' established German serious music as the superior language of feeling.<ref>Jessica C. E. Gienow-Hecht, \"Trumpeting down the Walls of Jericho: The Politics of Art, Music and Emotion in German-American Relations, 1870\u20131920\", ''Journal of Social History'' 2003 36(3): 585\u2013613,</ref>\n\n===Turners===\n[[Turners|Turner societies]] in the United States were first organized during the mid-19th century so German American immigrants could visit with one another and become involved in social and sports activities. The National Turnerbund, the head organization of the Turnvereine, started drilling members as in militia units in 1854. Nearly half of all Turners fought in the Civil War, mostly on the Union side, and a special group served as bodyguards for President Lincoln.\n\nBy the 1890s, Turners numbered nearly 65,000. At the turn of the 21st century, with the ethnic identity of European Americans in flux and Americanization a key element of immigrant life, there were few Turner groups, athletic events were limited, and non-Germans were members. A survey of surviving groups and members reflects these radical changes in the role of Turner societies and their marginalization in 21st-century American society, as younger German Americans tended not to belong, even in strongholds of German heritage in the Midwest.<ref>Annette R.

As Wittke emphasizes, press. it was \"essentially an American press published in a foreign tongue\". The papers reported on major political and diplomatic events involving Germany, with pride but from the viewpoint of its American readers.<ref>Wittke, ''The German-Language Press in America.'' p. 6</ref><ref>Shore, \"Introduction\". in ''The German-American Radical Press''.</ref> For example, during the latter half of the 19th century, at least 176 different German-language publications began operations in the city of Cincinnati alone. Many of these publications folded within a year, while a select few, such as the ''[[Cincinnati Freie Presse]]'', lasted nearly a century.<ref>Arndt, ''The German Language Press of the Americas''</ref> Other cities experienced similar turnover among immigrant publications, especially from opinion press, which published little news and focused instead on editorial commentary.<ref>Wittke, ''The German-Language Press in America''</ref>\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, there were over 800 German-language publications in the United States.<ref>La Verne Rippley, ''The German Americans'', Lanham, Maryland: University Press of America, 1984, p. 164.</ref> German immigration was on the decline, and with subsequent generations integrating into English-speaking society, the German language press began to struggle.<ref name=\"Dobbert, G.A 1914\">Dobbert, G.A. \"German-Americans between New and Old Fatherland, 1870-1914.\" ''American Quarterly''. 19.4 (1967): 663-680.</ref> The periodicals that managed to survive in immigrant communities faced an additional challenge with [[anti-German sentiment]] during World War{{nbsp}}I<ref>Shell, Marc. \"Hyphens: Between Deitsch and American.\" Multilingual America.

One example is [[Hiwwe wie Driwwe]] (Kutztown, PA), the nation's only [[Pennsylvania German]] newspaper, which was established in 1997.\n\n===Athletics===\nGermans brought organized gymnastics to America, and were strong supporters of sports programs. They used sport both to promote ethnic identity and pride and to facilitate integration into American society. Beginning in the mid-19th century, the [[Turners|Turner]] movement offered exercise and sports programs, while also providing a social haven for the thousands of new German immigrants arriving in the United States each year. Another highly successful German sports organization was the [[Buffalo Germans]] basketball team, winners of 762 games (against only 85 losses) in the early years of the 20th century. These examples, and others, reflect the evolving place of sport in the assimilation and socialization of much of the German-American population.<ref>Annette R. Hofmann, \"Between Ethnic Separation and Assimilation: German Immigrants and Their Athletic Endeavours in Their New American Home Country\", ''International Journal of the History of Sport'' 2008 25(8): 993-1009,</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:US census map of Lutheran churches - 1850.jpg|thumb|This 1850 census map shows the Lutheran population. Nearly all were German, since few Scandinavians had arrived yet.]]\n\nGerman immigrants who arrived before the 19th century tended to have been members of the Evangelical Lutheran Churches in Germany, and created the Lutheran Synods of Pennsylvania, North Carolina and New York. The largest Lutheran denominations in the U.S. today\u2014the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]], and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]]\u2014are all descended from churches started by German immigrants among others. [[Calvinist]] Germans founded the [[Reformed Church in the United States]] (especially in New York and Pennsylvania), and the [[Evangelical Synod of North America]] (strongest in the Midwest), which is now part of the [[United Church of Christ]]. Many immigrants joined different churches from those that existed in Germany. Protestants often joined the [[United Methodist Church|Methodist]] church.<ref name=\"Conzen\"/> In the 1740s, [[Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf|Count Nicolas von Zinzendorf]] tried to unite all the German-speaking Christians\u2014(Lutheran, Reformed, and Separatists)\u2014into one \"Church of God in the Spirit\". The [[Moravian Church]] in America is one of the results of this effort, as are the many \"Union\" churches in rural Pennsylvania.\n\nBefore 1800, communities of [[Amish]], [[Mennonite]]s, [[Schwarzenau Brethren]] and [[Moravian Church#Missions|Moravians]] had formed and are still in existence today. The Old Order Amish and a majority of the [[Old Order Mennonite]]s still speak dialects of German, including Pennsylvania German, informally known as [[Pennsylvania Dutch]]. The Amish, who were originally from southern Germany and Switzerland, arrived in Pennsylvania during the early 18th century. Amish immigration to the United States reached its peak between the years 1727 and 1770. Religious freedom was perhaps the most pressing cause for Amish immigration to Pennsylvania, which became known as a haven for persecuted religious groups.<ref name=\"The Amish\">{{Citation|url=http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/amish.html|title=The Amish|accessdate=2006-10-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107190410/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/amish.html|archive-date=2006-11-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Hutterites are another example of a group of German Americans who continue a lifestyle similar to that of their ancestors. Like the Amish, they fled persecution for their religious beliefs, and came to the United States between 1874 and 1879. Today, Hutterites mostly reside in [[Montana]], [[the Dakotas]], and [[Minnesota]], and the western provinces of Canada. Hutterites continue to speak [[Hutterite German]]. Most are able to understand Standard German in addition to their dialect.<ref name=\"National Geographic, the Hutterites\">{{Citation |last=Allard |first=William Albert |year=2006 |title=Hutterite Sojourn |publisher=National Geographic Society |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref> The German speaking [[Russian Mennonites|\"Russian\" Mennonites]] migrated during the same time as the Hutterites, but assimilated relatively quickly in the United States, whereas groups of \"Russian\" Mennonites in Canada resisted assimilation.<ref>Donald B. Kraybill and Nelson Hostetter: ''Anabaptist World USA'', 2001, Scottdale, PA, and Waterloo, ON, page 115.</ref>\n\nImmigrants from Germany in the mid-to-late-19th century brought many different religions with them. The most numerous were Lutheran or [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic]], although the Lutherans were themselves split among different groups. The more conservative Lutherans comprised the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod. Other Lutherans formed various synods, most of which merged with Scandinavian-based synods in 1988, forming the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.<ref>{{Citation|last=Almen|first=Lowell|title=One Great Cloud of Witnesses|publisher=Augsburg Fortress|location=Minneapolis|year=1997}}</ref> [[Catholic Germans]] started immigrating in large numbers in the mid to latter 19th century, spurred in particular by the ''[[Kulturkampf]]''.\n\nSome 19th-century immigrants, especially the \"Forty-Eighters\", were secular, rejecting formal religion. About 250,000 German Jews had arrived by the 1870s, and they sponsored reform synagogues in many small cities across the country. About two million Central and Eastern European Jews arrived from the 1880s to 1924, bringing more traditional religious practices.<ref>Edward S. Shapiro, \"Jews\", in Elliott Barkan, ed.

As one scholar concludes, \"The overwhelming evidence{{nbsp}}... indicates that the German-American school was a bilingual one much (perhaps a whole generation or more) earlier than 1917, and that the majority of the pupils may have been English-dominant bilinguals from the early 1880s on.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/540/handouts/gachurch/biggac.html|title=Language loyalty in the German-American Church: the Case of an Over-confident Minority.|website=Ccat.sas.upenn.edu|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> By 1914, the older members attended German-language church services, while younger ones attended English services (in Lutheran, Evangelical and Catholic churches). In German parochial schools, the children spoke English among themselves, though some of their classes were in German. In 1917\u201318, after the US entry into World War{{nbsp}}I on the side of the British, nearly all German language instruction ended, as did most German-language church services.<ref name=\"Hawgood\">{{Citation|last=Hawgood|first=John|title=The Tragedy of German-America|publisher=Arno Press|location=New York|date=1970}}</ref>\n\nAbout 1.5 million Americans speak German at home, according to the 2000 census. From 1860\u20131917, German was widely spoken in German neighborhoods; see [[German in the United States]]. There is a false belief, called the [[Muhlenberg legend]], that German was almost the official language of the U.S. There was never any such proposal. The U.S. has no [[official language]], but use of German was strongly discouraged during World War{{nbsp}}I and fell out of daily use in many places.<ref>see [http://usa.usembassy.de/germanamericans-language.htm U.S. State Department, \"German Language in the U.S\"]</ref>\n\nThere were fierce battles in Wisconsin and Illinois around 1890 regarding proposals to stop the use of German as the primary language in public and parochial schools. The [[Bennett Law]] was a highly controversial state law passed in [[Wisconsin]] in 1889 that required the use of English to teach major subjects in all public and private elementary and high schools. It affected the state's many German-language private schools (and some Norwegian schools), and was bitterly resented by German American communities. The German Catholics and Lutherans each operated large networks of [[parochial school]]s in the state. Because the language used in the classroom was German, the law meant the teachers would have to be replaced with bilingual teachers, and in most cases shut down. The Germans formed a coalition between Catholics and Lutherans, under the leadership of the Democratic Party, and the language issue produced a landslide for the Democrats, as Republicans dropped the issue until World War{{nbsp}}I. By 1917, almost all schools taught in English, but courses in German were common in areas with large German populations. These courses were permanently dropped.<ref>Robert J. Ulrich, ''The Bennett Law of Eighteen Eighty-Nine: Education and Politics in Wisconsin'' (1981).</ref>\n\n==Assimilation==\n\n===Introduction===\n\"Assimilation\" in this context means the steady loss of distinctive characteristics (especially language), as the Germans melted into a common American nationality.\n\n===The apparent disappearance of German American identity===\nGerman Americans are no longer a conspicuous ethnic group.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/united-states/2015/02/05/the-silent-minority|title=The silent minority|journal=The Economist|date=5 February 2015}}</ref> As Melvin G. Holli puts it, \"Public expression of German ethnicity is nowhere proportionate to the number of German Americans in the nation's population. Almost nowhere are German Americans as a group as visible as many smaller groups. Two examples suffice to illustrate this point: when one surveys the popular television scene of the past decade, one hears Yiddish humor done by comedians; one sees Polish, Greek, and East European detective heroes; Italian-Americans in situation comedies; and blacks such as the Jeffersons and Huxtables. But one searches in vain for quintessentially German-American characters or melodramas patterned after German-American experiences.{{nbsp}}... A second example of the virtual invisibility is that, though German Americans have been one of the largest ethnic groups in the Chicago area (numbering near one-half million between 1900 and 1910), no museum or archive exists to memorialize that fact. On the other hand, many smaller groups such as Lithuanians, Poles, Swedes, Jews, and others have museums, archives, and exhibit halls dedicated to their immigrant forefathers\".<ref name=\"Holli\">{{cite book|editor-last1=Holli|editor-first1=Melvin G.|editor-last2=Jones|editor-first2=Peter d'A.|title=Ethnic Chicago: A Multicultural Portrait|last=Holli|first=Melvin G.|chapter=German American Ethnic and Cultural Identity from 1890 Onward|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2JbU1d9Xil0C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=1995|publisher=William B.

By 1910 German Americans had created their own distinctive, vibrant, prosperous German-language communities, referred to collectively as \"Germania\".

She states that \"Many street signs were in German. (Main Street, for instance, was Haupt Strasse.) A large portion of local industry and commercial enterprises had at its roots German tooling and emigres. (An entire German town was moved to Fort Wayne when Wayne Knitting Mills opened.) Mayors, judges, firefighters and other community leaders had strong German ties. Social and sporting clubs and Germania Park in St. Joseph Township provided outlets to engage in traditional German activities\".<ref name=\"Fort Wayne\" /> She goes on to state that \"The cultural influences were so strong, in fact, that the Chicago Tribune in 1893 declared Fort Wayne a 'most German town'.\"<ref name=\"Fort Wayne\" /> Melvin G. Holli states that \"No continental foreign-born group had been so widely and favorably received in the United States, or had won such high marks from its hosts as had the Germans before World War{{nbsp}}I. Some public opinion surveys conducted before the war showed German Americans were even more highly regarded than immigrants from the mother culture, England\".<ref name=\"Holli\" />{{rp|106}} Holli states that the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] once \"had so many German-American musicians that the conductor often addressed them in the German language\"<ref name=\"Holli\" />{{rp|101}}, and he states that \"No ethnic theater in Chicago glittered with such a classy repertory as did the German-American theater, or served to introduce so many European classical works to American audiences\".<ref name=\"Holli\" />{{rp|102}}\n\nThe transition to the English language was abrupt, forced by federal, state and local governments, and by public opinion, when the U.S. was at war with Germany in 1917-18. After 1917 the [[German language]] was seldom heard in public; most newspapers and magazines closed; churches and parochial schools switched to English. Melvin G. Holli states that \"In 1917 the Missouri Synod's Lutheran Church conference minutes appeared in English for the first time, and the synod's new constitution dropped its insistence on using the language of [[Martin Luther|Luther]] only and instead suggested bilingualism. Dozens of Lutheran schools also dropped instruction in the German language. English-language services also intruded themselves into parishes where German had been the ''lingua franca''. Whereas only 471 congregations nationwide held English services in 1910, the number preaching in English in the synod skyrocketed to 2,492 by 1919. The German Evangelical Synod of Missouri, Ohio, and other states also anglicized its name by dropping German from the title\".<ref name=\"Holli\" />{{rp|106}} Writing about Fort Wayne, Indiana, Cynthia Moothart O'Bannon states that, in the First World War, \"Local churches were forced to discontinue sermons in German, schools were pressured to stop teaching in German, and the local library director was ordered to purchase no more books written in German. The library shelves also were purged of English-language materials deemed sympathetic to or neutral on Germany. Anti-German sentiment forced the renaming of several local institutions.

Holli states, regarding Chicago, that \"After the Great War it became clear that no ethnic group was so de-ethnicized in its public expression by a single historic event as German Americans. While Polish Americans, Lithuanian Americans, and other subject nationalities underwent a great consciousness raising, German ethnicity fell into a protracted and permanent slump. The war damaged public expression of German ethnic, linguistic, and cultural institutions almost beyond repair\".<ref name=\"Holli\" />{{rp|106}} He states that, after the war, German ethnicity \"would never regain its prewar public acclaim, its larger-than-life public presence, with its symbols, rituals, and, above all, its large numbers of people who took pride in their Teutonic ancestry and enjoyed the role of Uncle Sam's favored adopted son\".<ref name=\"Holli\" />{{rp|107}} He states \"A key indicator of the decline of \"Deutschtum\" in Chicago was the census: the number identifying themselves to the census-taker as German-born plummeted from 191,000 in 1910 to 112,000 in 1920. This drop far exceeds the natural mortality rate or the number who might be expected to move. Self-identifiers had found it prudent to claim some nationality other than German. To claim German nationality had become too painful an experience\".<ref name=\"Holli\" />{{rp|106}} Along similar lines, Terrence G. Wiley states that, in Nebraska, \"around 14 percent of the population had identified itself as being of German-origin in 1910; however, only 4.4 percent made comparable assertions in 1920. In Wisconsin, the decline in percentage of those identifying themselves as Germans was even more obvious. The 1920 census reported only 6.6. percent of the population as being of German-origin, as opposed to nearly 29 percent ten years earlier{{nbsp}}... These statistics led Burnell{{nbsp}}... to conclude that: \"No other North American ethnic group, past or present, has attempted so forcefully to officially conceal their{{nbsp}}... ethnic origins.

Holli, \"By 1930, some German American leaders in Chicago felt, as Dr. Leslie Tischauser put it, 'the damage done by the wartime experience had been largely repaired'. The German language was being taught in the schools again; the German theater still survived; and German Day celebrations were drawing larger and larger crowds. Although the assimilation process had taken its toll of pre-1914 German immigrants, a smaller group of newer postwar arrivals had developed a vocal if not impolitic interest in the rebuilding process in Germany under [[National Socialism]]. As the 1930s moved on, Hitler's brutality and Nazi excesses made Germanism once again suspect. The rise of Nazism, as Luebke notes, 'transformed German ethnicity in America into a source of social and psychological discomfort, if not distress. The overt expression of German-American opinion consequently declined, and in more recent years, virtually disappeared as a reliable index of political attitudes{{nbsp}}...'\"<ref name=\"Holli\" />{{rp|108}} Holli goes on to state that \"The pain increased during the late 1930s and early 1940s, when Congressman Martin Dies held public hearings about the menace of Nazi subversives and spies among the German Americans. In 1940 the Democratic party's attack on anti-war elements as disloyal and pro-Nazi, and the advent of the war itself, made German ethnicity too heavy a burden to bear. As Professor Tischauser wrote, \"The notoriety gained by those who supported the German government between 1933 and 1941 cast a pall over German-Americans everywhere. Leaders of the German-American community would have great difficulty rebuilding an ethnic consciousness{{nbsp}}...

Holli, by the end of World War{{nbsp}}II, German Americans \"were ethnics without any visible national or local leaders. Not even politicians would think of addressing them explicitly as an ethnic constituency as they would say, Polish Americans, Jewish Americans, or African Americans.\"<ref name=\"Holli\" />{{rp|109}} Holli states that \"Being on the wrong side in two wars had a devastating and long-term negative impact on the public celebration of German-American ethnicity\".<ref name=\"Holli\" />{{rp|106}}\n\nHistorians have tried to explain what became of the German Americans and their descendants. Kazal (2004) looks at Germans in Philadelphia, focusing on four ethnic subcultures: middle-class Vereinsdeutsche, working-class socialists, Lutherans, and Catholics. Each group followed a somewhat distinctive path toward assimilation. Lutherans, and the better situated Vereinsdeutsche with whom they often overlapped, after World War{{nbsp}}I abandoned the last major German characteristics and redefined themselves as old stock or as \"Nordic\" Americans, stressing their colonial roots in Pennsylvania and distancing themselves from more recent immigrants. On the other hand, working-class and Catholic Germans, groups that heavily overlapped, lived and worked with [[Irish Americans|Irish]] and other European ethnics; they also gave up German characteristics but came to identify themselves as white ethnics, distancing themselves above all from [[African American]] recent arrivals in nearby neighborhoods. Well before World War{{nbsp}}I, women in particular were becoming more and more involved in a mass consumer culture that lured them out of their German-language neighborhood shops and into English language downtown department stores. The 1920s and 1930s brought English language popular culture via movies and radio that drowned out the few surviving German language venues.<ref name=\"Kazal\">Russell A. Kazal, ''Becoming Old Stock: The Paradox of German-American Identity'' (2004).</ref>\n\n===Factors making German Americans susceptible to assimilation===\nKazal points out that German Americans have not had an experience that is especially typical of immigrant groups. \"Certainly, in a number of ways, the German-American experience was idiosyncratic. No other large immigrant group was subjected to such strong, sustained pressure to abandon its ethnic identity for an American one. None was so divided internally, a characteristic that made German Americans especially vulnerable to such pressure. Among the larger groups that immigrated in the country after 1830, none - despite regional variations - appears to have muted its ethnic identity to so great an extent.\"<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273}} This quote from Kazal identifies both external pressures on German Americans and internal dividedness among them as reasons for their high level of assimilation.\n\nRegarding the external pressures, Kazal writes: \"The pressure imposed on German Americans to forsake their ethnic identity was extreme in both nature and duration. No other ethnic group saw its 'adoptive fatherland' twice enter a world war against its country of origin. To this stigma, the Third Reich added the lasting one of [[the Holocaust]]. In her study of ethnic identity in the 1980s, sociologist Mary Waters noted that the 'effect of the Nazi movement and World War{{nbsp}}II was still quite strong' in shaping 'popular perceptions of the German-American character', enough so that some individuals of mixed background often would acknowledge only the non-German part of their ancestry.\"<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273}}{{efn|In the book that Kazal appears to be quoting here, Waters states \"Many people cited various political or social events as having an effect on their consciousness and degree of ethnic identity. I have already noted Laurie Jablonski's stronger identification with her Polish than with her German ancestry, a fact she attributed to the influence her surname had on how others reacted to her. When I asked about times when the relative influence of one or the other side might be stronger, she revealed that political events in Germany and Poland had a lot to do with how she chose to identify herself\".<ref name=\"Waters\">{{cite book|title=Ethnic Options: Choosing Identities in America|last=Waters|first=Mary C.|url=https://archive.org/details/ethnicoptionscho0000wate|url-access=registration|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520070837}}</ref>{{rp|83}} Waters goes on to state that \"The association of being German with being a Nazi is still strong for Laurie, forty years after World War{{nbsp}}II. A similar story to Laurie's is related in a description by Hinda Winawer-Steiner and Norbert Wetzel of a workshop for family therapists on ethnicity and family therapy. The therapists were supposed to talk about their ethnicity and how it might influence their work. A discussion of a German-American family revealed that two of the therapists who had identified themselves as Polish-American at the beginning of the workshop were, in fact, half German. It turned out that they were suppressing their German identity because of the negative connotations associated with being German. \"When asked, one explained that she simply considered herself Polish. The other, after some reflection, said that in a group that was half Jewish, she had been reluctant to acknowledge her German heritage\" (Winawer-Steiner and Wetzel 1982, 253)\".<ref name=\"Waters\" />{{rp|84}}}} Kazal contrasts this experience with the experiences of the Japanese, Poles, Czechs, Lithuanians, Italians, east European Jews, and Irish. \"Japanese Americans, of course, suffered far more during the Second World War\",<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273}} but until at least the 1950s, the pressure on Japanese Americans \"ran toward exclusion from, rather than inclusion in, the nation\".<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273}} \"The state and many ordinary European Americans refused to recognize Asians as potentially American. In contrast, they pressured Germans to accept precisely that American identity in place of a German one\".<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273}} Kazal goes on to state \"The burden of \"enemy\" status made those pressures far greater for Germans than for other European ethnic groups. To some extent, American intervention in World War{{nbsp}}I actually helped fuel ethnic nationalism in the United States among Poles, Czechs, Lithuanians, Italians, and east European Jews, who felt their desires for existing or prospective homelands stood to gain from an Allied victory. Indeed, some historians have depicted the following decade as one when immigrants transcended local or regional homeland affiliations to craft or further consolidate national identities as Poles, Czechs, and Italians. Such groups escaped the fury of \"100 percent Americanism\" during the war, in part because of their obvious stake in the defeat of the Central Powers\".<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273 - 274}} As for Irish Americans, Kazal states that the lack of enthusiasm of many of them for helping England made them \"vulnerable to the wartime \"antihyphen\" climate\",<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|274}}, but that \"Irish nationalist activity intensified during and immediately after that war, as many Irish Americans became swept up in the events leading to the creation of the Irish Free State\",<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|274}} and that \"It made a difference for the long-term viability of Irish-American identity that the Irish homeland not only did not go to war with the United States but, in fact, emerged during the interwar years as a sovereign nation\".<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|274}}\n\nKazal then goes on to discuss the internal dividedness. He writes: \"German-American identity fell victim not only to a peculiar set of events, but also to an extraordinarily high level of internal diversity. All ethnic groups have internal divides, whether of class, religion, gender, politics, or homeland region. What distinguished German America was that it incorporated not just some but ''all'' of these divisions. Irish Americans, for example, had lost their status as primarily a proletarian group by 1900, yet they were united by religion and politics. \"Irish American\" had come to mean Irish Catholic; the vast majority of Irish Americans subscribed to some form of Irish nationalism conflated with American patriotism; and Irish-American voters were overwhelmingly Democrats. The power of this synthesis, Kerby Miller argued, explains the survival of Irish-American identity despite the ebbing of organised Irish-American nationalism after the Free State's founding.

Hence, German-Americans' diversity has emerged as perhaps the crucial variable accounting for their assimilationist propensities. Otter Tail County, certainly a rural area, had German-American communities that were diverse and small, and these communities succeeded in maintaining crucial ethnic boundaries into the twentieth century. The persistence of these heterogeneous, lightly populated German-American communities suggest that place of residence was the key factor in the rate of German-American assimilation. Urban orientation may have corroded German-American ethnic boundaries more than diversity did, though the two variables were not unrelated\".<ref name=\"Peterson\" />{{rp|47 - 48}}}} (Conzen is also drawn upon by Joy Kristina Adams, who cites Conzen when she (Adams) states that \"The diversity and size of the German settlements made them susceptible to long-term Americanization by fostering factionalism, increasing contacts between Germans and non-Germans, and weakening unified leadership\".)<ref>[https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/2652/adamsj55244.pdf Going ''Deutsch'': Heritage Tourism and Identity in German Texas], p. 45</ref> The ''Encyclopedia of the Great Plains'' also stresses the internal dividedness, stating \"One of the distinguishing characteristics of the German population in North America (especially in comparison to other immigrant groups) has been its relative degree of cultural diversity, reflected especially in the number of Christian denominations to which Germans belonged. In part this reflects patterns that had developed over centuries in Germany, whose population came to include nearly every variety of Christianity\u2013from Catholics, Lutherans, and Reformed groups to more radical Anabaptist pietistic movements such as Amish, Mennonites, Schwenkfelders, and the Moravian church.

St. Louis served (and still does) as the seat of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, a conservative American Lutheran confession, and their local strength led to friction with Germans of other faiths. These Lutherans did not traffic much with the sizable German Catholic population of the city, who often shared their houses of worship and political stances with the Irish. The small rabbinical German Jewish community remained insular. The Freethinkers, atheists, socialists, et al., had little use for any of these groups. In addition, the Germans, while heavily concentrated in a few pockets of north and south St. Louis, were spread across the city proper and into the larger countryside\".<ref name=\"Baker\" />{{rp|99}} And according to the [[Max Kade]] Institute for German-American Studies, \"The diversity of religious expression among German-speaking immigrants was paralleled by a high degree of heterogeneity stemming from differences in regional and linguistic origins. This situation differed from that of other nineteenth-century immigrant groups, notably the Irish, but also Italians and people of other European backgrounds. The resulting lack of a unified and clearly definable German-American community explains in part why only few Americans, including those of German descent, have any idea when Steuben Day or German-American Day falls, whereas the Irish St. Patrick's Day is one of America's most popular celebrations, and Columbus Day, named after the Italian explorer, is a federal holiday\".<ref name=\"Max Kade Institute\">{{cite web|url=https://mki.wisc.edu/content/how-german-american-building-communities|title=How German Is American?

They were widely dispersed throughout the Second and Third Municipalities, and in Carrollton and Lafayette, and they were fragmented by differences in religion, region of origin, and class. The proliferation of German clubs, associations, and institutions bespoke the Germans' numerical significance in the city, but it also attested to their divisions, for such organizations tended to cater to very specific groups rather than bind the various German strands together. To be sure, distinct concentrations of Germans existed in various parts of the city, wherein various German cultural values survived and influenced the culture of non-Germans in their midst, and German ''Gem\u00fctlichkeit'' was easily accommodated in the city's genial public culture. But, overall, Germans were too diverse and divided to dominate the city\".<ref name=\"Miller\" />{{rp|129}} Miller contrasts this situation with the situation of Irish Americans in New Orleans: \"Irish immigrants had greater cohesion and wider influence than the Germans. In the great waves of late antebellum immigration, the vast majority of Irish immigrants entering New Orleans came from a few select counties in Ireland. They shared a common faith, poverty, and national identity.{{nbsp}}...

[[Anne, Queen of Great Britain]], helped them get to her colonies in America. The trip was long and difficult to survive because of the poor quality of food and water aboard ships and the infectious disease [[typhus]].

Most were first settled along the [[Hudson River]] in work camps, to pay off their passage. By 1711, seven villages had been established in New York on the [[Robert Livingston the Elder|Robert Livingston]] manor. In 1723 Germans became the first Europeans allowed to buy land in the [[Mohawk Valley]] west of [[Little Falls (town), New York|Little Falls]]. One hundred homesteads were allocated in the Burnetsfield Patent. By 1750, the Germans occupied a strip some {{convert|12|mi|km}} long along both sides of the [[Mohawk River]]. The soil was excellent; some 500 houses were built, mostly of stone, and the region prospered in spite of Indian raids. [[Herkimer (town), New York|Herkimer]] was the best-known of the German settlements in a region long known as the \"German Flats\".<ref name=\"Knittle\"/>\n\nThey kept to themselves, married their own, spoke German, attended Lutheran churches, and retained their own customs and foods. They emphasized farm ownership. Some mastered English to become conversant with local legal and business opportunities. They tolerated slavery (although few were rich enough to own a slave).<ref>Philip Otterness, ''Becoming German: The 1709 Palatine Migration to New York'' (2004)</ref>\n\nThe most famous of the early German Palatine immigrants was editor [[John Peter Zenger]], who led the fight in colonial New York City for freedom of the press in America.

Of the over 5,000 Germans initially immigrating primarily from the Alsace Region as few as 500 made up the first wave of immigrants to leave France en route to the Americas. Less than 150 of those first indentured German farmers made it to Louisiana and settled along what became known as the German Coast. With tenacity, determination and the leadership of D'arensburg these Germans felled trees, cleared land, and cultivated the soil with simple hand tools as draft animals were not available. The German coast settlers supplied the budding City of New Orleans with corn, rice, eggs. and meat for many years following.\n\nThe [[Mississippi Company]] settled thousands of German pioneers in [[France|French]] [[Louisiana]] during 1721. It encouraged Germans, particularly Germans of the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] region who had recently fallen under French rule, and the [[Swiss people|Swiss]] to immigrate. [[Alsace]] was sold to France within the greater context of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648).\n\nThe [[Jesuit]] [[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Xavier de Charlevoix|Charlevoix]] traveled [[New France]] ([[Canada]] and Louisiana) in the early 1700s. His letter said \"these 9,000 Germans, who were raised in the Palatinate (Alsace part of France) were in [[Arkansas]]. The Germans left Arkansas en masse. They went to [[New Orleans]] and demanded passage to Europe.

The name \"Germanna\", selected by Governor [[Alexander Spotswood]], reflected both the German immigrants who sailed across the Atlantic to Virginia and the British Queen, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]], who was in power at the time of the first settlement at Germanna.\n\nIn [[North Carolina]], German [[Moravians (ethnic group)|Moravians]] living around [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] purchased nearly {{convert|100000|acre|km2|sigfig=1}} from [[Lord Granville]] (one of the British Lords Proprietor) in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] of [[North Carolina]] in 1753.

Soon after, the German Moravians founded the town of [[Old Salem|Salem]] in 1766 (now a historical section in the center of Winston-Salem) and [[Salem College]] (an early female college) in 1772.\n\nIn the [[Georgia Colony]], Germans mainly from the [[Swabia]] region settled in Savannah, St. Simon's Island and [[Fort Frederica]] in the 1730s and 1740s. They were actively recruited by [[James Oglethorpe]] and quickly distinguished themselves through improved farming, advanced [[tabby (cement)]]-construction, and leading joint Lutheran-[[Anglicanism|Anglican]]-Reformed religious services for the colonists.\n\nGerman immigrants also settled in other areas of the American South, including around the Dutch (Deutsch) Fork area of [[South Carolina]],<ref name=\"Conzen\"/> and [[Texas]], especially in the [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] area.\n\n====New England====\nBetween 1742 and 1753, roughly 1,000 Germans settled in Broad Bay, Massachusetts (now [[Waldoboro, Maine]]). Many of the colonists fled to [[Boston]], [[Maine]], [[Nova Scotia]], and [[North Carolina]] after their houses were burned and their neighbors killed or carried into captivity by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].

Politically, they were generally inactive until 1740, when they joined a [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]]-led coalition that took control of the legislature, which later supported the [[American Revolution]]. Despite this, many of the German settlers were [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalists]] during the Revolution, possibly because they feared their royal land grants would be taken away by a new republican government, or because of loyalty to a British German monarchy who had provided the opportunity to live in a liberal society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sciway3.net/clark/revolutionarywar/loyalists.html|title=Loyalists (Royalists, Tories) in South Carolina|website=Sciway3.net|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> The Germans, comprising [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Calvinism|Reformed]], [[Mennonite]]s, [[Amish]], and other sects, developed a rich religious life with a strong musical culture.

Eventually the word came to refer to people who speak a Germanic language, and only in the last couple centuries the people of the Netherlands. Other Germanic language variants for \"deutsch/deitsch/dutch\" are: Dutch \"Duits\" and \"[[Diets]]\", Yiddish \"[[daytsh]]\", Danish/Norwegian \"tysk\", or Swedish \"[[Theodiscus#Etymology|tyska]].\" The Japanese \"doitzu\" also derives from the aforementioned \"Dutch\" variations.

From 1840 to 1880, they were the largest group of immigrants. Following the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]], a wave of political refugees fled to America, who became known as [[Forty-Eighters]]. They included professionals, journalists, and politicians.

They typically were local and regional merchants selling clothing; others were livestock dealers, agricultural commodity traders, bankers, and operators of local businesses. [[Henry Lehman]], who founded [[Lehman Brothers]] in Alabama, was a particularly prominent example of such a German-Jewish immigrant. They formed [[Reform Judaism|Reform synagogues]]<ref>Zev Eleff, ''Who Rules the Synagogue?: Religious Authority and the Formation of American Judaism'' (Oxford Up, 2016).</ref> and sponsored numerous local and national philanthropic organizations, such as [[B'nai B'rith]].<ref>Cornelia Wilhelm, ''The Independent Orders of B'nai B'rith and True Sisters: Pioneers of a New Jewish Identity, 1843-1914'' (2011).</ref> This German-speaking group is quite distinct from the Yiddish-speaking East-European Jews who arrived in much larger numbers starting in the late 19th century and concentrated in New York.\n\n====Northeastern cities====\n{{Further|Germans in Syracuse, New York|History of the Germans in Baltimore}}\n\nThe port cities of [[New York City|New York]], and [[History of the Germans in Baltimore|Baltimore]] had large populations.

As in [[Milwaukee]], Germans in Houston built the brewing industry. By the 1920s, the first generation of college-educated German Americans were moving into the chemical and oil industries.<ref name=\"Conzen\"/>\n\nTexas had about 20,000 German Americans in the 1850s. They did not form a uniform bloc, but were highly diverse and drew from geographic areas and all sectors of European society, except that very few aristocrats or upper middle class businessmen arrived. In this regard, Texas Germania was a microcosm of the Germania nationwide.\n\n<blockquote>The Germans who settled Texas were diverse in many ways. They included peasant farmers and intellectuals; Protestants, Catholics, Jews, and atheists; Prussians, Saxons, and Hessians; abolitionists and slave owners; farmers and townsfolk; frugal, honest folk and ax murderers. They differed in dialect, customs, and physical features. A majority had been farmers in Germany, and most arrived seeking economic opportunities. A few dissident intellectuals fleeing the 1848 revolutions sought political freedom, but few, save perhaps the Wends, went for religious freedom. The German settlements in Texas reflected their diversity. Even in the confined area of the Hill Country, each valley offered a different kind of German. The Llano valley had stern, teetotaling German Methodists, who renounced dancing and fraternal organizations; the Pedernales valley had fun-loving, hardworking Lutherans and Catholics who enjoyed drinking and dancing; and the Guadalupe valley had freethinking Germans descended from intellectual political refugees. The scattered German ethnic islands were also diverse. These small enclaves included Lindsay in Cooke County, largely Westphalian Catholic; Waka in Ochiltree County, Midwestern Mennonite; Hurnville in Clay County, Russian German Baptist; and Lockett in Wilbarger County, Wendish Lutheran.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/png02 |title=GERMANS |work=Handbook of Texas Online|date=2010-06-15 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Germans from Russia====\n{{see also|Volga Germans|Russian Mennonite}}\n[[File:Volga-Germans-US.jpg|thumb|left|Temporary quarters for [[Volga Germans]] in central Kansas, 1875]]\n\n[[Germans from Russia]] were the most traditional of German-speaking arrivals.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} They were Germans who had lived for generations throughout the [[Russian Empire]], but especially along the [[Volga River]] in Russia and near the [[Crimea]]. Their ancestors had come from all over the German-speaking world, invited by [[Catherine the Great]] in 1762 and 1763 to settle and introduce more advanced German agriculture methods to rural Russia. They had been promised by the manifesto of their settlement the ability to practice their respective Christian denominations, retain their culture and language, and retain immunity from conscription for them and their descendants. As time passed, the Russian monarchy gradually eroded the ethnic German population's relative autonomy. Conscription eventually was reinstated; this was especially harmful to the Mennonites, who practice pacifism. Throughout the 19th century, pressure increased from the Russian government to culturally assimilate. Many Germans from Russia found it necessary to emigrate to avoid conscription and preserve their culture. About 100,000 immigrated by 1900, settling primarily in the Dakotas, Kansas and Nebraska. The southern central part of North Dakota was known as \"the German-Russian triangle\". A smaller number moved farther west, finding employment as ranchers and cowboys.\n\nNegatively influenced by the violation of their rights and cultural persecution by the [[Tsar]], the Germans from Russia who settled in the northern [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] saw themselves a downtrodden ethnic group separate from Russian Americans and having an entirely different experience from the German Americans who had emigrated from German lands; they settled in tight-knit communities who retained their German language and culture. They raised large families, built German-style churches, buried their dead in distinctive cemeteries using cast iron grave markers, and sang German hymns. Many farmers specialized in sugar beets\u2014still a major crop in the upper Great Plains. During World War{{nbsp}}I, their identity was challenged by [[anti-German sentiment]]. By the end of World War{{nbsp}}II, the German language, which had always been used with English for public and official matters, was in serious decline. Today, German is preserved mainly through singing groups and recipes, with the Germans from Russia in the northern Great Plains states speaking predominantly English. German remains the second most spoken language in North and South Dakota, and Germans from Russia often use [[loanword]]s, such as ''Kuchen'' for cake. Despite the loss of their language, the ethnic group remains distinct, and has left a lasting impression on the American West.<ref>Elwyn B.

For example, the Santa Fe railroad hired its own commissioner for immigration, and sold over {{convert|300,000|acre|km2}} to German-speaking farmers.<ref>C. B.

While they needed profits to stay in operation, they used profits as a tool \"to maintain continuity of the family\".<ref>Sonya Salamon, ''Prairie Patrimony: Family, Farming, and Community in the Midwest'' (U. of North Carolina Press, 1992) pp. 53, 101</ref> They used risk averse strategies, and carefully planned their inheritances to keep the land in the family. Their communities showed smaller average farm size, greater equality, less absentee ownership and greater geographic persistence. As one farmer explained, \"To protect your family has turned out to be the same thing as protecting your land.\"<ref>Salamon, ''Prairie Patrimony'' p 101</ref>\n\nGermany was a large country with many diverse subregions which contributed immigrants. Dubuque was the base of the ''Ostfriesische Nachrichten'' (\"East Fresian News\") from 1881 to 1971. It connected the 20,000 immigrants from East Friesland (Ostfriesland), Germany, to each other across the Midwest, and to their old homeland. In Germany East Friesland was often a topic of ridicule regarding backward rustics, but editor Leupke H\u00fcndling shrewdly combined stories of proud memories of Ostfriesland. The editor enlisted a network of local correspondents. By mixing local American and local German news, letters, poetry, fiction, and dialogue, the German-language newspaper allowed immigrants to honor their origins and celebrate their new life as highly prosperous farmers with much larger farms than were possible back in impoverished Ostfriesland. During the world wars, when Germania came under heavy attack, the paper stressed its humanitarian role, mobilizing readers to help the people of East Friesland with relief funds. Younger generations could usually speak German but not read it, so the subscription based dwindled away as the target audience Americanized itself.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 27501458|title = Heimat in the Heartland: The Significance of an Ethnic Newspaper|journal = Journal of American Ethnic History|volume = 23|issue = 3|pages = 78\u201398|last1 = Lindaman|first1 = Matthew|year = 2004}}</ref>\n\n====Politics====\nRelatively few German Americans held office, but the men voted once they became citizens. In general during the [[Third party System]] (1850s\u20131890s), the Protestants and Jews leaned toward the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] and the Catholics were strongly [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]. When [[prohibition]] was on the ballot, the Germans voted solidly against it. They strongly distrusted moralistic crusaders, whom they called \"Puritans\", including the temperance reformers and many [[Populist Party (United States)|Populists]]. The German community strongly opposed [[Free Silver]], and voted heavily against crusader [[William Jennings Bryan]] in 1896. In 1900, many German Democrats returned to their party and voted for Bryan, perhaps because of President [[William McKinley]]'s foreign policy.<ref name=\"Jensen1971\">{{cite book|author=Richard J.

The German Americans had voted 80 percent for Lincoln in 1860, and strongly supported the war effort. They were a bastion of the Republican Party in St. Louis and nearby immigrant strongholds in Missouri and southern Illinois. The German Americans were angered by a proposed Missouri state constitution that discriminated against Catholics and freethinkers. The requirement of a special loyalty oath for priests and ministers was troublesome. Despite their strong opposition the constitution was ratified in 1865. Racial tensions with the blacks began to emerge, especially in terms of competition for unskilled labor jobs. Germania was nervous about black suffrage in 1868, fearing that blacks would support puritanical laws, especially regarding the prohibition of beer gardens on Sundays.

German Americans in many cities, such as [[Milwaukee]], brought their strong support of education, establishing German-language schools and teacher training seminaries (''T\u00f6chter-Institut'') to prepare students and teachers in German language training. By the late 19th century, the Germania Publishing Company was established in Milwaukee, a publisher of books, magazines, and newspapers in German.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uwm.edu/~margo/sympapers/Ortlepp.htm|title=Deutsch-Athen Revisited{{nbsp}}...|website=Uwm.edu|accessdate=28 August 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207173929/http://www.uwm.edu/~margo/sympapers/Ortlepp.htm|archivedate=7 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n\"Germania\" was the common term for German American neighborhoods and their organizations.<ref>Noel Iverson, ''Germania, U.S.A.'' (1966).</ref> ''Deutschtum'' was the term for transplanted German nationalism, both culturally and politically. Between 1875 and 1915, the German American population in the United States doubled, and many of its members insisted on maintaining their culture. German was used in local schools and churches, while numerous ''Vereine'', associations dedicated to literature, humor, gymnastics, and singing, sprang up in German American communities. German Americans tended to support the German government's actions, and, even after the United States entered World War{{nbsp}}I, they often voted for antidraft and antiwar candidates. 'Deutschtum' in the United States disintegrated after 1918.<ref>Andrew Yox, \"The German-American Community as a Nationality, 1880-1940\", ''Yearbook of German-American Studies'' 2001 36: 181-193; Kazal (2004)</ref>\n\n===Music===\nBeginning in 1741, the German-speaking [[Moravian Church]] Settlements of [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]], [[Nazareth, Pennsylvania|Nazareth]] and [[Lititz, Pennsylvania|Lititz]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Wachovia, North Carolina|Wachovia]] in North Carolina had highly developed musical cultures. Choral music, Brass and String Music and Congregational singing were highly cultivated. The Moravian Church produced many composers and musicians. [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]'s ''Creation'' had its American debut in Bethlehem in the early 19th century.\n\nThe spiritual beliefs of Johann Conrad Beissel (1690\u20131768) and the Ephrata Cloister\u2014such as the asceticism and mysticism of this Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, group - are reflected in Beissel's treatises on music and hymns, which have been considered the beginning of America's musical heritage.<ref>Lucile E. Hackett, \"Johann Conrad Beissel: Early German-American Mystic and Musician\", ''Studies in Puritan American Spirituality'' 1995 5: 95\u2013121</ref>\n\nIn most major cities, Germans took the lead in creating a musical culture, with popular bands, singing societies, operas and symphonic orchestras.<ref>Philip V.

The first began in 1855; the last folded in 1961.

Wolf, \"Wheeling's German Singing Societies\", ''West Virginia History'' 1980\u20131981 42(1\u20132): 1\u201356</ref>\n\nThe Liederkranz, a German-American music society, played an important role in the integration of the German community into the life of [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. Started in 1848, the organization was strengthened by the arrival of German liberals after the failure of the revolution of that year. By the mid-1850s the Germans formed one-third of Louisville's population and faced nativist hostility organized in the Know-Nothing movement. Violent demonstrations forced the chorus to suppress publicity of its performances that included works by composer Richard Wagner. The Liederkranz suspended operations during the Civil War, but afterward grew rapidly, and was able to build a large auditorium by 1873. An audience of 8,000 that attended a performance in 1877 demonstrated that the Germans were an accepted part of Louisville life.<ref>Erna Ottl Gwinn, \"The Liederkranz in Louisville, 1848\u20131877\", ''Filson Club History Quarterly'' 1975 49(3): 276\u2013290,</ref>\n\nThe Imperial government in Berlin promoted German culture in the U.S., especially music. A steady influx of German-born conductors, including Arthur Nikisch and Karl Muck, spurred the reception of German music in the United States, while German musicians seized on Victorian Americans' growing concern with 'emotion'. The performance of pieces such as Beethoven's ''Ninth Symphony'' established German serious music as the superior language of feeling.<ref>Jessica C. E. Gienow-Hecht, \"Trumpeting down the Walls of Jericho: The Politics of Art, Music and Emotion in German-American Relations, 1870\u20131920\", ''Journal of Social History'' 2003 36(3): 585\u2013613,</ref>\n\n===Turners===\n[[Turners|Turner societies]] in the United States were first organized during the mid-19th century so German American immigrants could visit with one another and become involved in social and sports activities. The National Turnerbund, the head organization of the Turnvereine, started drilling members as in militia units in 1854. Nearly half of all Turners fought in the Civil War, mostly on the Union side, and a special group served as bodyguards for President Lincoln.\n\nBy the 1890s, Turners numbered nearly 65,000. At the turn of the 21st century, with the ethnic identity of European Americans in flux and Americanization a key element of immigrant life, there were few Turner groups, athletic events were limited, and non-Germans were members. A survey of surviving groups and members reflects these radical changes in the role of Turner societies and their marginalization in 21st-century American society, as younger German Americans tended not to belong, even in strongholds of German heritage in the Midwest.<ref>Annette R.

As Wittke emphasizes, press. it was \"essentially an American press published in a foreign tongue\".

One example is [[Hiwwe wie Driwwe]] (Kutztown, PA), the nation's only [[Pennsylvania German]] newspaper, which was established in 1997.\n\n===Athletics===\nGermans brought organized gymnastics to America, and were strong supporters of sports programs. They used sport both to promote ethnic identity and pride and to facilitate integration into American society. Beginning in the mid-19th century, the [[Turners|Turner]] movement offered exercise and sports programs, while also providing a social haven for the thousands of new German immigrants arriving in the United States each year. Another highly successful German sports organization was the [[Buffalo Germans]] basketball team, winners of 762 games (against only 85 losses) in the early years of the 20th century. These examples, and others, reflect the evolving place of sport in the assimilation and socialization of much of the German-American population.<ref>Annette R. Hofmann, \"Between Ethnic Separation and Assimilation: German Immigrants and Their Athletic Endeavours in Their New American Home Country\", ''International Journal of the History of Sport'' 2008 25(8): 993-1009,</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:US census map of Lutheran churches - 1850.jpg|thumb|This 1850 census map shows the Lutheran population. Nearly all were German, since few Scandinavians had arrived yet.]]\n\nGerman immigrants who arrived before the 19th century tended to have been members of the Evangelical Lutheran Churches in Germany, and created the Lutheran Synods of Pennsylvania, North Carolina and New York. The largest Lutheran denominations in the U.S. today\u2014the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]], and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]]\u2014are all descended from churches started by German immigrants among others. [[Calvinist]] Germans founded the [[Reformed Church in the United States]] (especially in New York and Pennsylvania), and the [[Evangelical Synod of North America]] (strongest in the Midwest), which is now part of the [[United Church of Christ]]. Many immigrants joined different churches from those that existed in Germany. Protestants often joined the [[United Methodist Church|Methodist]] church.<ref name=\"Conzen\"/> In the 1740s, [[Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf|Count Nicolas von Zinzendorf]] tried to unite all the German-speaking Christians\u2014(Lutheran, Reformed, and Separatists)\u2014into one \"Church of God in the Spirit\". The [[Moravian Church]] in America is one of the results of this effort, as are the many \"Union\" churches in rural Pennsylvania.\n\nBefore 1800, communities of [[Amish]], [[Mennonite]]s, [[Schwarzenau Brethren]] and [[Moravian Church#Missions|Moravians]] had formed and are still in existence today. The Old Order Amish and a majority of the [[Old Order Mennonite]]s still speak dialects of German, including Pennsylvania German, informally known as [[Pennsylvania Dutch]]. The Amish, who were originally from southern Germany and Switzerland, arrived in Pennsylvania during the early 18th century. Amish immigration to the United States reached its peak between the years 1727 and 1770. Religious freedom was perhaps the most pressing cause for Amish immigration to Pennsylvania, which became known as a haven for persecuted religious groups.<ref name=\"The Amish\">{{Citation|url=http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/amish.html|title=The Amish|accessdate=2006-10-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107190410/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/amish.html|archive-date=2006-11-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Hutterites are another example of a group of German Americans who continue a lifestyle similar to that of their ancestors. Like the Amish, they fled persecution for their religious beliefs, and came to the United States between 1874 and 1879. Today, Hutterites mostly reside in [[Montana]], [[the Dakotas]], and [[Minnesota]], and the western provinces of Canada. Hutterites continue to speak [[Hutterite German]]. Most are able to understand Standard German in addition to their dialect.<ref name=\"National Geographic, the Hutterites\">{{Citation |last=Allard |first=William Albert |year=2006 |title=Hutterite Sojourn |publisher=National Geographic Society |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref> The German speaking [[Russian Mennonites|\"Russian\" Mennonites]] migrated during the same time as the Hutterites, but assimilated relatively quickly in the United States, whereas groups of \"Russian\" Mennonites in Canada resisted assimilation.<ref>Donald B. Kraybill and Nelson Hostetter: ''Anabaptist World USA'', 2001, Scottdale, PA, and Waterloo, ON, page 115.</ref>\n\nImmigrants from Germany in the mid-to-late-19th century brought many different religions with them. The most numerous were Lutheran or [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic]], although the Lutherans were themselves split among different groups. The more conservative Lutherans comprised the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod. Other Lutherans formed various synods, most of which merged with Scandinavian-based synods in 1988, forming the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.<ref>{{Citation|last=Almen|first=Lowell|title=One Great Cloud of Witnesses|publisher=Augsburg Fortress|location=Minneapolis|year=1997}}</ref> [[Catholic Germans]] started immigrating in large numbers in the mid to latter 19th century, spurred in particular by the ''[[Kulturkampf]]''.\n\nSome 19th-century immigrants, especially the \"Forty-Eighters\", were secular, rejecting formal religion. About 250,000 German Jews had arrived by the 1870s, and they sponsored reform synagogues in many small cities across the country. About two million Central and Eastern European Jews arrived from the 1880s to 1924, bringing more traditional religious practices.<ref>Edward S. Shapiro, \"Jews\", in Elliott Barkan, ed.

As one scholar concludes, \"The overwhelming evidence{{nbsp}}... indicates that the German-American school was a bilingual one much (perhaps a whole generation or more) earlier than 1917, and that the majority of the pupils may have been English-dominant bilinguals from the early 1880s on.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/540/handouts/gachurch/biggac.html|title=Language loyalty in the German-American Church: the Case of an Over-confident Minority.|website=Ccat.sas.upenn.edu|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> By 1914, the older members attended German-language church services, while younger ones attended English services (in Lutheran, Evangelical and Catholic churches). In German parochial schools, the children spoke English among themselves, though some of their classes were in German. In 1917\u201318, after the US entry into World War{{nbsp}}I on the side of the British, nearly all German language instruction ended, as did most German-language church services.<ref name=\"Hawgood\">{{Citation|last=Hawgood|first=John|title=The Tragedy of German-America|publisher=Arno Press|location=New York|date=1970}}</ref>\n\nAbout 1.5 million Americans speak German at home, according to the 2000 census. From 1860\u20131917, German was widely spoken in German neighborhoods; see [[German in the United States]]. There is a false belief, called the [[Muhlenberg legend]], that German was almost the official language of the U.S. There was never any such proposal. The U.S. has no [[official language]], but use of German was strongly discouraged during World War{{nbsp}}I and fell out of daily use in many places.<ref>see [http://usa.usembassy.de/germanamericans-language.htm U.S. State Department, \"German Language in the U.S\"]</ref>\n\nThere were fierce battles in Wisconsin and Illinois around 1890 regarding proposals to stop the use of German as the primary language in public and parochial schools. The [[Bennett Law]] was a highly controversial state law passed in [[Wisconsin]] in 1889 that required the use of English to teach major subjects in all public and private elementary and high schools. It affected the state's many German-language private schools (and some Norwegian schools), and was bitterly resented by German American communities. The German Catholics and Lutherans each operated large networks of [[parochial school]]s in the state. Because the language used in the classroom was German, the law meant the teachers would have to be replaced with bilingual teachers, and in most cases shut down. The Germans formed a coalition between Catholics and Lutherans, under the leadership of the Democratic Party, and the language issue produced a landslide for the Democrats, as Republicans dropped the issue until World War{{nbsp}}I. By 1917, almost all schools taught in English, but courses in German were common in areas with large German populations. These courses were permanently dropped.<ref>Robert J. Ulrich, ''The Bennett Law of Eighteen Eighty-Nine: Education and Politics in Wisconsin'' (1981).</ref>\n\n==Assimilation==\n\n===Introduction===\n\"Assimilation\" in this context means the steady loss of distinctive characteristics (especially language), as the Germans melted into a common American nationality.\n\n===The apparent disappearance of German American identity===\nGerman Americans are no longer a conspicuous ethnic group.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/united-states/2015/02/05/the-silent-minority|title=The silent minority|journal=The Economist|date=5 February 2015}}</ref> As Melvin G. Holli puts it, \"Public expression of German ethnicity is nowhere proportionate to the number of German Americans in the nation's population. Almost nowhere are German Americans as a group as visible as many smaller groups. Two examples suffice to illustrate this point: when one surveys the popular television scene of the past decade, one hears Yiddish humor done by comedians; one sees Polish, Greek, and East European detective heroes; Italian-Americans in situation comedies; and blacks such as the Jeffersons and Huxtables. But one searches in vain for quintessentially German-American characters or melodramas patterned after German-American experiences.{{nbsp}}... A second example of the virtual invisibility is that, though German Americans have been one of the largest ethnic groups in the Chicago area (numbering near one-half million between 1900 and 1910), no museum or archive exists to memorialize that fact. On the other hand, many smaller groups such as Lithuanians, Poles, Swedes, Jews, and others have museums, archives, and exhibit halls dedicated to their immigrant forefathers\".<ref name=\"Holli\">{{cite book|editor-last1=Holli|editor-first1=Melvin G.|editor-last2=Jones|editor-first2=Peter d'A.|title=Ethnic Chicago: A Multicultural Portrait|last=Holli|first=Melvin G.|chapter=German American Ethnic and Cultural Identity from 1890 Onward|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2JbU1d9Xil0C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=1995|publisher=William B.

She states that \"Many street signs were in German. (Main Street, for instance, was Haupt Strasse.) A large portion of local industry and commercial enterprises had at its roots German tooling and emigres. (An entire German town was moved to Fort Wayne when Wayne Knitting Mills opened.) Mayors, judges, firefighters and other community leaders had strong German ties. Social and sporting clubs and Germania Park in St. Joseph Township provided outlets to engage in traditional German activities\".<ref name=\"Fort Wayne\" /> She goes on to state that \"The cultural influences were so strong, in fact, that the Chicago Tribune in 1893 declared Fort Wayne a 'most German town'.\"<ref name=\"Fort Wayne\" /> Melvin G. Holli states that \"No continental foreign-born group had been so widely and favorably received in the United States, or had won such high marks from its hosts as had the Germans before World War{{nbsp}}I.

After 1917 the [[German language]] was seldom heard in public; most newspapers and magazines closed; churches and parochial schools switched to English. Melvin G. Holli states that \"In 1917 the Missouri Synod's Lutheran Church conference minutes appeared in English for the first time, and the synod's new constitution dropped its insistence on using the language of [[Martin Luther|Luther]] only and instead suggested bilingualism. Dozens of Lutheran schools also dropped instruction in the German language. English-language services also intruded themselves into parishes where German had been the ''lingua franca''. Whereas only 471 congregations nationwide held English services in 1910, the number preaching in English in the synod skyrocketed to 2,492 by 1919.

Holli states, regarding Chicago, that \"After the Great War it became clear that no ethnic group was so de-ethnicized in its public expression by a single historic event as German Americans. While Polish Americans, Lithuanian Americans, and other subject nationalities underwent a great consciousness raising, German ethnicity fell into a protracted and permanent slump. The war damaged public expression of German ethnic, linguistic, and cultural institutions almost beyond repair\".<ref name=\"Holli\" />{{rp|106}} He states that, after the war, German ethnicity \"would never regain its prewar public acclaim, its larger-than-life public presence, with its symbols, rituals, and, above all, its large numbers of people who took pride in their Teutonic ancestry and enjoyed the role of Uncle Sam's favored adopted son\".<ref name=\"Holli\" />{{rp|107}} He states \"A key indicator of the decline of \"Deutschtum\" in Chicago was the census: the number identifying themselves to the census-taker as German-born plummeted from 191,000 in 1910 to 112,000 in 1920. This drop far exceeds the natural mortality rate or the number who might be expected to move. Self-identifiers had found it prudent to claim some nationality other than German. To claim German nationality had become too painful an experience\".<ref name=\"Holli\" />{{rp|106}} Along similar lines, Terrence G. Wiley states that, in Nebraska, \"around 14 percent of the population had identified itself as being of German-origin in 1910; however, only 4.4 percent made comparable assertions in 1920. In Wisconsin, the decline in percentage of those identifying themselves as Germans was even more obvious. The 1920 census reported only 6.6. percent of the population as being of German-origin, as opposed to nearly 29 percent ten years earlier{{nbsp}}... These statistics led Burnell{{nbsp}}... to conclude that: \"No other North American ethnic group, past or present, has attempted so forcefully to officially conceal their{{nbsp}}... ethnic origins.

Holli, \"By 1930, some German American leaders in Chicago felt, as Dr. Leslie Tischauser put it, 'the damage done by the wartime experience had been largely repaired'. The German language was being taught in the schools again; the German theater still survived; and German Day celebrations were drawing larger and larger crowds. Although the assimilation process had taken its toll of pre-1914 German immigrants, a smaller group of newer postwar arrivals had developed a vocal if not impolitic interest in the rebuilding process in Germany under [[National Socialism]]. As the 1930s moved on, Hitler's brutality and Nazi excesses made Germanism once again suspect. The rise of Nazism, as Luebke notes, 'transformed German ethnicity in America into a source of social and psychological discomfort, if not distress. The overt expression of German-American opinion consequently declined, and in more recent years, virtually disappeared as a reliable index of political attitudes{{nbsp}}...'\"<ref name=\"Holli\" />{{rp|108}} Holli goes on to state that \"The pain increased during the late 1930s and early 1940s, when Congressman Martin Dies held public hearings about the menace of Nazi subversives and spies among the German Americans. In 1940 the Democratic party's attack on anti-war elements as disloyal and pro-Nazi, and the advent of the war itself, made German ethnicity too heavy a burden to bear. As Professor Tischauser wrote, \"The notoriety gained by those who supported the German government between 1933 and 1941 cast a pall over German-Americans everywhere. Leaders of the German-American community would have great difficulty rebuilding an ethnic consciousness{{nbsp}}...

Holli, by the end of World War{{nbsp}}II, German Americans \"were ethnics without any visible national or local leaders. Not even politicians would think of addressing them explicitly as an ethnic constituency as they would say, Polish Americans, Jewish Americans, or African Americans.\"<ref name=\"Holli\" />{{rp|109}} Holli states that \"Being on the wrong side in two wars had a devastating and long-term negative impact on the public celebration of German-American ethnicity\".<ref name=\"Holli\" />{{rp|106}}\n\nHistorians have tried to explain what became of the German Americans and their descendants. Kazal (2004) looks at Germans in Philadelphia, focusing on four ethnic subcultures: middle-class Vereinsdeutsche, working-class socialists, Lutherans, and Catholics. Each group followed a somewhat distinctive path toward assimilation. Lutherans, and the better situated Vereinsdeutsche with whom they often overlapped, after World War{{nbsp}}I abandoned the last major German characteristics and redefined themselves as old stock or as \"Nordic\" Americans, stressing their colonial roots in Pennsylvania and distancing themselves from more recent immigrants. On the other hand, working-class and Catholic Germans, groups that heavily overlapped, lived and worked with [[Irish Americans|Irish]] and other European ethnics; they also gave up German characteristics but came to identify themselves as white ethnics, distancing themselves above all from [[African American]] recent arrivals in nearby neighborhoods. Well before World War{{nbsp}}I, women in particular were becoming more and more involved in a mass consumer culture that lured them out of their German-language neighborhood shops and into English language downtown department stores. The 1920s and 1930s brought English language popular culture via movies and radio that drowned out the few surviving German language venues.<ref name=\"Kazal\">Russell A. Kazal, ''Becoming Old Stock: The Paradox of German-American Identity'' (2004).</ref>\n\n===Factors making German Americans susceptible to assimilation===\nKazal points out that German Americans have not had an experience that is especially typical of immigrant groups. \"Certainly, in a number of ways, the German-American experience was idiosyncratic. No other large immigrant group was subjected to such strong, sustained pressure to abandon its ethnic identity for an American one. None was so divided internally, a characteristic that made German Americans especially vulnerable to such pressure. Among the larger groups that immigrated in the country after 1830, none - despite regional variations - appears to have muted its ethnic identity to so great an extent.\"<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273}} This quote from Kazal identifies both external pressures on German Americans and internal dividedness among them as reasons for their high level of assimilation.\n\nRegarding the external pressures, Kazal writes: \"The pressure imposed on German Americans to forsake their ethnic identity was extreme in both nature and duration. No other ethnic group saw its 'adoptive fatherland' twice enter a world war against its country of origin. To this stigma, the Third Reich added the lasting one of [[the Holocaust]]. In her study of ethnic identity in the 1980s, sociologist Mary Waters noted that the 'effect of the Nazi movement and World War{{nbsp}}II was still quite strong' in shaping 'popular perceptions of the German-American character', enough so that some individuals of mixed background often would acknowledge only the non-German part of their ancestry.\"<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273}}{{efn|In the book that Kazal appears to be quoting here, Waters states \"Many people cited various political or social events as having an effect on their consciousness and degree of ethnic identity. I have already noted Laurie Jablonski's stronger identification with her Polish than with her German ancestry, a fact she attributed to the influence her surname had on how others reacted to her. When I asked about times when the relative influence of one or the other side might be stronger, she revealed that political events in Germany and Poland had a lot to do with how she chose to identify herself\".<ref name=\"Waters\">{{cite book|title=Ethnic Options: Choosing Identities in America|last=Waters|first=Mary C.|url=https://archive.org/details/ethnicoptionscho0000wate|url-access=registration|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520070837}}</ref>{{rp|83}} Waters goes on to state that \"The association of being German with being a Nazi is still strong for Laurie, forty years after World War{{nbsp}}II. A similar story to Laurie's is related in a description by Hinda Winawer-Steiner and Norbert Wetzel of a workshop for family therapists on ethnicity and family therapy. The therapists were supposed to talk about their ethnicity and how it might influence their work. A discussion of a German-American family revealed that two of the therapists who had identified themselves as Polish-American at the beginning of the workshop were, in fact, half German. It turned out that they were suppressing their German identity because of the negative connotations associated with being German. \"When asked, one explained that she simply considered herself Polish. The other, after some reflection, said that in a group that was half Jewish, she had been reluctant to acknowledge her German heritage\" (Winawer-Steiner and Wetzel 1982, 253)\".<ref name=\"Waters\" />{{rp|84}}}} Kazal contrasts this experience with the experiences of the Japanese, Poles, Czechs, Lithuanians, Italians, east European Jews, and Irish. \"Japanese Americans, of course, suffered far more during the Second World War\",<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273}} but until at least the 1950s, the pressure on Japanese Americans \"ran toward exclusion from, rather than inclusion in, the nation\".<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273}} \"The state and many ordinary European Americans refused to recognize Asians as potentially American. In contrast, they pressured Germans to accept precisely that American identity in place of a German one\".<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273}} Kazal goes on to state \"The burden of \"enemy\" status made those pressures far greater for Germans than for other European ethnic groups. To some extent, American intervention in World War{{nbsp}}I actually helped fuel ethnic nationalism in the United States among Poles, Czechs, Lithuanians, Italians, and east European Jews, who felt their desires for existing or prospective homelands stood to gain from an Allied victory. Indeed, some historians have depicted the following decade as one when immigrants transcended local or regional homeland affiliations to craft or further consolidate national identities as Poles, Czechs, and Italians. Such groups escaped the fury of \"100 percent Americanism\" during the war, in part because of their obvious stake in the defeat of the Central Powers\".<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273 - 274}} As for Irish Americans, Kazal states that the lack of enthusiasm of many of them for helping England made them \"vulnerable to the wartime \"antihyphen\" climate\",<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|274}}, but that \"Irish nationalist activity intensified during and immediately after that war, as many Irish Americans became swept up in the events leading to the creation of the Irish Free State\",<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|274}} and that \"It made a difference for the long-term viability of Irish-American identity that the Irish homeland not only did not go to war with the United States but, in fact, emerged during the interwar years as a sovereign nation\".<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|274}}\n\nKazal then goes on to discuss the internal dividedness. He writes: \"German-American identity fell victim not only to a peculiar set of events, but also to an extraordinarily high level of internal diversity. All ethnic groups have internal divides, whether of class, religion, gender, politics, or homeland region. What distinguished German America was that it incorporated not just some but ''all'' of these divisions. Irish Americans, for example, had lost their status as primarily a proletarian group by 1900, yet they were united by religion and politics. \"Irish American\" had come to mean Irish Catholic; the vast majority of Irish Americans subscribed to some form of Irish nationalism conflated with American patriotism; and Irish-American voters were overwhelmingly Democrats. The power of this synthesis, Kerby Miller argued, explains the survival of Irish-American identity despite the ebbing of organised Irish-American nationalism after the Free State's founding. For German Americans, religion and party politics were sources of division rather than of unity\".<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|274}} Kazal goes on to state that \"The subcultures of German America, meanwhile, had ample opportunity for contact, however testy, with non-German counterparts. The latter beckoned as destinations when the cost of being German-American rose too high\".<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|274}} It is not just Kazal who has pointed out the internal dividedness of the German American community. Kathleen Neils Conzen has pointed it out; David Peterson states that Conzen, \"along with many others, concludes that German-Americans' heterogeneity, particularly in religion, hampered their ability to build socially and politically stable ethnic communities\",<ref name=\"Peterson\">{{cite journal|journal=Journal of American Ethnic History|volume=11|issue=2|pages=27\u201355|jstor = 27500930|last1 = Peterson|first1 = David|title=\"From Bone Depth\": German-American Communities in Rural Minnesota before the Great War|year=1992}}</ref>{{rp|27}} and that Conzen \"stresses that German Americans assimilated relatively rapidly and that their diversity played a key role in that assimilation\".<ref name=\"Peterson\" />{{rp|47}}{{efn|Peterson himself seems not to fully agree with this, stating \"Most community studies have examined very large, heterogeneous German-American urban populations that assimilated relatively quickly or, less commonly, large, homogeneous rural ones that did not. Hence, German-Americans' diversity has emerged as perhaps the crucial variable accounting for their assimilationist propensities. Otter Tail County, certainly a rural area, had German-American communities that were diverse and small, and these communities succeeded in maintaining crucial ethnic boundaries into the twentieth century. The persistence of these heterogeneous, lightly populated German-American communities suggest that place of residence was the key factor in the rate of German-American assimilation. Urban orientation may have corroded German-American ethnic boundaries more than diversity did, though the two variables were not unrelated\".<ref name=\"Peterson\" />{{rp|47 - 48}}}} (Conzen is also drawn upon by Joy Kristina Adams, who cites Conzen when she (Adams) states that \"The diversity and size of the German settlements made them susceptible to long-term Americanization by fostering factionalism, increasing contacts between Germans and non-Germans, and weakening unified leadership\".)<ref>[https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/2652/adamsj55244.pdf Going ''Deutsch'': Heritage Tourism and Identity in German Texas], p. 45</ref> The ''Encyclopedia of the Great Plains'' also stresses the internal dividedness, stating \"One of the distinguishing characteristics of the German population in North America (especially in comparison to other immigrant groups) has been its relative degree of cultural diversity, reflected especially in the number of Christian denominations to which Germans belonged. In part this reflects patterns that had developed over centuries in Germany, whose population came to include nearly every variety of Christianity\u2013from Catholics, Lutherans, and Reformed groups to more radical Anabaptist pietistic movements such as Amish, Mennonites, Schwenkfelders, and the Moravian church. It is not surprising, then, that nearly all of these denominations were represented among the German immigrant population in North America.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.ea.013|title=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains - GERMANS|website=plainshumanities.unl.edu}}</ref> Robert Paul McCaffery points out that \"Despite their numbers{{nbsp}}... and unlike many immigrant groups, Germans never united as a powerful ethnic block.

St. Louis served (and still does) as the seat of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, a conservative American Lutheran confession, and their local strength led to friction with Germans of other faiths. These Lutherans did not traffic much with the sizable German Catholic population of the city, who often shared their houses of worship and political stances with the Irish. The small rabbinical German Jewish community remained insular. The Freethinkers, atheists, socialists, et al., had little use for any of these groups. In addition, the Germans, while heavily concentrated in a few pockets of north and south St. Louis, were spread across the city proper and into the larger countryside\".<ref name=\"Baker\" />{{rp|99}} And according to the [[Max Kade]] Institute for German-American Studies, \"The diversity of religious expression among German-speaking immigrants was paralleled by a high degree of heterogeneity stemming from differences in regional and linguistic origins. This situation differed from that of other nineteenth-century immigrant groups, notably the Irish, but also Italians and people of other European backgrounds. The resulting lack of a unified and clearly definable German-American community explains in part why only few Americans, including those of German descent, have any idea when Steuben Day or German-American Day falls, whereas the Irish St. Patrick's Day is one of America's most popular celebrations, and Columbus Day, named after the Italian explorer, is a federal holiday\".<ref name=\"Max Kade Institute\">{{cite web|url=https://mki.wisc.edu/content/how-german-american-building-communities|title=How German Is American?

Cayton: \"In the process of participating in the public culture of Ohio, some Germans struggled to keep connections with their birthplaces. A coherent community was difficult to maintain, however.

They were widely dispersed throughout the Second and Third Municipalities, and in Carrollton and Lafayette, and they were fragmented by differences in religion, region of origin, and class. The proliferation of German clubs, associations, and institutions bespoke the Germans' numerical significance in the city, but it also attested to their divisions, for such organizations tended to cater to very specific groups rather than bind the various German strands together. To be sure, distinct concentrations of Germans existed in various parts of the city, wherein various German cultural values survived and influenced the culture of non-Germans in their midst, and German ''Gem\u00fctlichkeit'' was easily accommodated in the city's genial public culture. But, overall, Germans were too diverse and divided to dominate the city\".<ref name=\"Miller\" />{{rp|129}} Miller contrasts this situation with the situation of Irish Americans in New Orleans: \"Irish immigrants had greater cohesion and wider influence than the Germans. In the great waves of late antebellum immigration, the vast majority of Irish immigrants entering New Orleans came from a few select counties in Ireland.

Her earliest writings were poetry and she has written professionally for radio, television, film, and the stage. The lives of both ordinary and famous women, feminism, and Jewish culture are frequent themes in her writing.\n\nRose Leiman Goldemberg's most celebrated play is the internationally acclaimed, ''Letters Home'' about the life of Sylvia Plath and her mother. It has been translated into numerous languages and been honored all over the world.<ref name=\"dps-bio\" /> Like ''Letters Home'', Goldemberg's plays frequently incorporate biographical material, as with ''Sophie'' (1987), about entertainer [[Sophie Tucker]]; and ''[[Picon Pie]]'' (2004), about Yiddish theater actress [[Molly Picon]]. Her plays have been produced widely [[Off-Broadway]], in venues throughout the United States, and internationally.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.nypl.org/the/23321#bioghist|title=New York Public Library Archives}}</ref>\n\nGoldemberg's most prominent work on TV was ''[[The Burning Bed]]'' (1984), a television movie based on the true story of a survivor of domestic violence, played by [[Farrah Fawcett]].

Other screenplays written by Goldemberg include ''Land of Hope'' (1976), and ''[[Mother and Daughter: The Loving War]]'' (1980).

Most of her screenplays are dramas.\n\nGoldemberg has also taught the subjects of English and Theater at The City College of New York and Fairleigh Dickinson University. She is a published author of such books as ''Adios, Hollywood'' and ''Antique Jewelry: A Practical & Passionate Guide.''

Her earliest writings were poetry and she has written professionally for radio, television, film, and the stage. The lives of both ordinary and famous women, feminism, and Jewish culture are frequent themes in her writing.\n\nRose Leiman Goldemberg's most celebrated play is the internationally acclaimed, ''Letters Home'' about the life of Sylvia Plath and her mother. It has been translated into numerous languages and been honored all over the world.<ref name=\"dps-bio\" /> Like ''Letters Home'', Goldemberg's plays frequently incorporate biographical material, as with ''Sophie'' (1987), about entertainer [[Sophie Tucker]]; and ''[[Picon Pie]]'' (2004), about Yiddish theater actress [[Molly Picon]]. Her plays have been produced widely [[Off-Broadway]], in venues throughout the United States, and internationally.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.nypl.org/the/23321#bioghist|title=New York Public Library Archives}}</ref>\n\nGoldemberg's most prominent work on TV was ''[[The Burning Bed]]'' (1984), a television movie based on the true story of a survivor of domestic violence, played by [[Farrah Fawcett]]. Another well-known television movie written by Goldemberg, ''[[Stone Pillow]]'' (1985), starred [[Lucille Ball]] as a homeless woman. Other screenplays written by Goldemberg include ''Land of Hope'' (1976), and ''[[Mother and Daughter: The Loving War]]'' (1980). Goldemberg was more involved with the production and filming of television movies, mini-series, and shows than is typical for screenwriters, making cast recommendations and visiting the sets. Most of her screenplays are dramas.\n\nGoldemberg has also taught the subjects of English and Theater at The City College of New York and Fairleigh Dickinson University. She is a published author of such books as ''Adios, Hollywood'' and ''Antique Jewelry: A Practical & Passionate Guide.'' She is also an award-winning poet and author of short stories.<ref name=\"dps-bio\" />\n\n==Early years==\nRose Leiman Goldemberg was born in 1928 in the [[Port Richmond]] neighborhood of [[Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

Snell was sentenced to [[death penalty|death]] for one of the murders, and executed by [[lethal injection]] in 1995.\n\n== Background ==\nRichard Snell was a member of the [[white supremacist]] group [[The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord]] (known as the CSA), which was started in 1971 in the small community of [[Elijah, Missouri|Elijah]], [[Missouri]], by [[polygamist]] [[James Ellison (polygamist)|James Ellison]]. He was also a believer in the [[Christian Identity]] religion, and frequented [[Elohim City]], a private community located in [[Oklahoma]]. The [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF) had ongoing investigations into the organization. By the end of their operations, the ATF obtained 155 [[Krugerrand]]s (gold coins), one live light antitank rocket (LAW), 94 long guns, 30 handguns, 35 sawed-off shotguns and machine guns, one light machine gun (a Japanese copy of the World War I [[Lewis Gun|Lewis]], in .303 caliber), and three and a half bars of [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4 explosives]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/media/gallery/Document/csa_doc_f.pdf |title=The Covenant, The Sword, The Arm of the Lord; Domestic Security/Terrorism |date=May 20, 1985 |author=FBI}}</ref> Much of this arsenal had been stolen.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\nSnell was involved in the filming of planes that landed at [[Mena Intermountain Municipal Airport]] in [[Mena, Arkansas|Mena]], [[Arkansas]], thought of by Snell and many [[conspiracy theorists]] to be used in a government-sanctioned operation of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) to smuggle drugs into the United States. Snell had claimed that law enforcement agencies, both state and those local to that area of western Arkansas, were involved in the cover-up of the Mena airport drug smuggling. He had also made claims that he had filmed the then-[[Governor of Arkansas]], [[Bill Clinton]], at Mena Intermountain Municipal Airport, but that claim has never been proven. Snell further claimed that one of the Arkansas [[state troopers]] who was assigned to the Governor's security team at that time had beaten Snell's wife in an attempt to force her to reveal the location of the alleged video footage Snell had taken at the airport.\n\nIn 1983, Snell, accompanied by CSA members William Thomas and Steven Scott, attempted to [[dynamite]] a [[natural gas]] pipeline near [[Fulton, Arkansas]], without success. Scott was eventually captured and convicted of that crime, while several other CSA members were arrested on various other charges, mostly weapons violations. By 1985, the CSA had essentially fallen into inactivity due to most of its members being either killed or incarcerated.\n\n== Murders and execution ==\nSnell, known to his friends as \"Wayne\", was an anomaly amongst the militants of the CSA, in that he operated autonomously, using the CSA compound as his base of operation. Steven Scott, a frequent collaborator with Snell, gave this information in a federal prison holding cell to one of the then members.\n\nOn November 3, 1983, Snell shot and killed [[pawn shop]] owner William Stumpp, whom he mistakenly believed was of [[Jewish]] descent, and then on June 30, 1984, he killed black [[Arkansas State Police|Arkansas State Trooper]] Louis P. Bryant near [[DeQueen, Arkansas]].<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/officer.php?oid=2415 Trooper Louis P.

The [[police officer]]s there set up a [[roadblock]], where they engaged Snell in a shootout which resulted in Snell being wounded six times in the abdomen, knee and ankle and arrested. Snell was then returned to Arkansas for [[trial]], where he was convicted of murder and sentenced to [[life in prison]] for the murder of Bryant and [[death penalty|death]] for the murder of Stumpp. Snell never denied the allegations made against him, or the crimes he was accused of having committed.\n\n[[File:CumminsUnitSignArk.jpg|thumb|The [[Cummins Unit]], where Snell was executed]]\nSnell was held at the [[Tucker Maximum Security Unit]] until April 15, 1995, when he was transferred to the execution site.<ref>\"[http://newsok.com/murderer-moved-to-death-watch-cell/article/2498788 Murderer Moved to Death Watch Cell]\" ({{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402163049/http://newsok.com/murderer-moved-to-death-watch-cell/article/2498788 |date=2015-04-02 }}).

Snell was sentenced to [[death penalty|death]] for one of the murders, and executed by [[lethal injection]] in 1995.\n\n== Background ==\nRichard Snell was a member of the [[white supremacist]] group [[The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord]] (known as the CSA), which was started in 1971 in the small community of [[Elijah, Missouri|Elijah]], [[Missouri]], by [[polygamist]] [[James Ellison (polygamist)|James Ellison]]. He was also a believer in the [[Christian Identity]] religion, and frequented [[Elohim City]], a private community located in [[Oklahoma]]. The [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF) had ongoing investigations into the organization. By the end of their operations, the ATF obtained 155 [[Krugerrand]]s (gold coins), one live light antitank rocket (LAW), 94 long guns, 30 handguns, 35 sawed-off shotguns and machine guns, one light machine gun (a Japanese copy of the World War I [[Lewis Gun|Lewis]], in .303 caliber), and three and a half bars of [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4 explosives]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/media/gallery/Document/csa_doc_f.pdf |title=The Covenant, The Sword, The Arm of the Lord; Domestic Security/Terrorism |date=May 20, 1985 |author=FBI}}</ref> Much of this arsenal had been stolen.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\nSnell was involved in the filming of planes that landed at [[Mena Intermountain Municipal Airport]] in [[Mena, Arkansas|Mena]], [[Arkansas]], thought of by Snell and many [[conspiracy theorists]] to be used in a government-sanctioned operation of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) to smuggle drugs into the United States. Snell had claimed that law enforcement agencies, both state and those local to that area of western Arkansas, were involved in the cover-up of the Mena airport drug smuggling. He had also made claims that he had filmed the then-[[Governor of Arkansas]], [[Bill Clinton]], at Mena Intermountain Municipal Airport, but that claim has never been proven. Snell further claimed that one of the Arkansas [[state troopers]] who was assigned to the Governor's security team at that time had beaten Snell's wife in an attempt to force her to reveal the location of the alleged video footage Snell had taken at the airport.\n\nIn 1983, Snell, accompanied by CSA members William Thomas and Steven Scott, attempted to [[dynamite]] a [[natural gas]] pipeline near [[Fulton, Arkansas]], without success. Scott was eventually captured and convicted of that crime, while several other CSA members were arrested on various other charges, mostly weapons violations. By 1985, the CSA had essentially fallen into inactivity due to most of its members being either killed or incarcerated.\n\n== Murders and execution ==\nSnell, known to his friends as \"Wayne\", was an anomaly amongst the militants of the CSA, in that he operated autonomously, using the CSA compound as his base of operation. Steven Scott, a frequent collaborator with Snell, gave this information in a federal prison holding cell to one of the then members.\n\nOn November 3, 1983, Snell shot and killed [[pawn shop]] owner William Stumpp, whom he mistakenly believed was of [[Jewish]] descent, and then on June 30, 1984, he killed black [[Arkansas State Police|Arkansas State Trooper]] Louis P. Bryant near [[DeQueen, Arkansas]].<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/officer.php?oid=2415 Trooper Louis P.

Retrieved on 2007-11-15.</ref> Snell then left the scene and drove across the [[Oklahoma]] state line, however a truck driver who witnessed the killing of Officer Bryant followed him, and contacted the [[Broken Bow, Oklahoma|Broken Bow]] police department. The [[police officer]]s there set up a [[roadblock]], where they engaged Snell in a shootout which resulted in Snell being wounded six times in the abdomen, knee and ankle and arrested. Snell was then returned to Arkansas for [[trial]], where he was convicted of murder and sentenced to [[life in prison]] for the murder of Bryant and [[death penalty|death]] for the murder of Stumpp. Snell never denied the allegations made against him, or the crimes he was accused of having committed.\n\n[[File:CumminsUnitSignArk.jpg|thumb|The [[Cummins Unit]], where Snell was executed]]\nSnell was held at the [[Tucker Maximum Security Unit]] until April 15, 1995, when he was transferred to the execution site.<ref>\"[http://newsok.com/murderer-moved-to-death-watch-cell/article/2498788 Murderer Moved to Death Watch Cell]\" ({{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402163049/http://newsok.com/murderer-moved-to-death-watch-cell/article/2498788 |date=2015-04-02 }}).
