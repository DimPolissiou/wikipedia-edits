She was ''[[suo jure]]'' Viscountess of Marsan, which she inherited from her father.\n\n==Life==\nMartha was the third child of her mother, her second marriage to [[Guy de Montfort, Count of Bigorre|Guy de Montfort]] had produced two half-sisters, [[Alice, Countess of Bigorre|Alice]], who would go on to succeed their mother and a second Petronilla who was married to Raoul de la Roche-Tesson.\n\nPetronilla made a testament soon after the birth of Martha, so that Alice would inherit her title of Countess of Bigorre. Whilst Martha, would inherit the title of Viscountess of Marsen from her father.<ref>Merlet \u00b4Proc\u00e8s\u00b4, Pi\u00e8ces Justificatives, I, p. 314, quoting Cartulaire de Bigorre, ch. 39.</ref>\n\nBetween 1245 and 1250, Martha married [[Gaston VII, Viscount of B\u00e9arn]], the couple had four daughters:\n* [[Constance of B\u00e9arn|Constance]] (died 1310), succeeded in Marsan and Bigorre. Married firstly, on 23 March 1260, to the [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]] ''[[infante]]'' Alfonso, son of [[James the Conqueror]], who died 26 March; married secondly, on 15 May 1269, to [[Henry of Almain]], son of [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard of Cornwall]]; and married thirdly, in 1279, to [[Aymon II of Geneva]]\n*[[Margaret of Montcada|Margaret]], succeeded in B\u00e9arn.

However, before Petronilla's death, she had handed control of the government over to [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester]], who interpreted the act as a gift and so did not allow Alice to claim her inheritance.<ref>Dictionnaire de la conversation et de la lecture, 2nd Edition, Vol.3, Ed.

Alice appealed to Martha and Gaston for help in claiming her inheritance, the couple sent Alice military support and forced De Montfort to abandon his claims, returning to England soon after.\n\nAlice ruled as countess for four years and died in 1255. She was succeeded by her son, [[Eskivat de Chabanais]]. However, Martha's nephew made the mistake of keeping land that she had in Bigorre. Gaston VII then invaded the county, forcing Eschivat to defend it, seeking alliances with the English and [[Roger IV, Count of Foix]].<ref>Dictionnaire de la conversation et de la lecture, 2nd Edition, Vol.3, Ed.

In doing so, he committed the same mistake as his grandmother, because Simon refused to return the county. Soon after, Simon de Montfort rebelled against King [[Henry III of England]], and Eschivat helped Gaston VII and Martha regain Bigorre. He died in 1283, without children.\n\nAfter the death on Eschivat, Martha and her niece by Alice, named Laura, both made claim for Bigorre. This dispute would continue long after the death of Martha, the claims being passed onto her own daughters and their descendants. Following Martha's death, there was a succession dispute amongst her husband and four daughters with Margaret eventually succeeding him.
