{"title_page": "Somers Isles Company", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe '''Somers Isles Company''' (fully, the '''Company of the City of London for the Plantacion of The Somers Isles''' or the '''Company of The Somers Isles''') was formed in 1615 to operate the [[English colonial empire|English colony]] of the Somers Isles, also known as [[Bermuda]], as a commercial venture. It held a [[royal charter]] for Bermuda until 1684, when it was dissolved, and [[the Crown]] assumed responsibility for the administration of Bermuda as a [[crown colony|royal colony]].\n\n==Bermuda under the Virginia Company==\n{{see also|Jamestown supply missions}}\n[[Image:Generall Historie of Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|\"[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]\", by [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]]]]\nBermuda had been settled, inadvertently, in 1609 by the [[London Company|Virginia Company]] when its flagship, ''[[Sea Venture]]'', was wrecked on the reefs to its east.<ref>A Discovery of The Barmudas, Sylvester Jordain</ref> The Admiral of the Company, [[George Somers|Sir George Somers]], was at the helm as the ship fought a storm that had broken apart [[Third Supply|a relief fleet]] destined for [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], the Virginian settlement established by the Company two years earlier. Somers had deliberately driven the ship onto the reefs to prevent its foundering, thereby saving all aboard.<ref>Woodward, Hobson. ''A Brave Vessel: The True Tale of the Castaways Who Rescued Jamestown and Inspired Shakespeare's The Tempest''. Viking (2009) pp. 32\u201350.</ref>\n\nThe settlers and seamen spent ten months in Bermuda while they built two new ships to continue the voyage to Jamestown. During the building, ''Sea Venture'''s longboat was fitted with a mast and sent to find Jamestown. Neither it, nor its crew, was ever seen again. When [[Sea Venture|''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'']] set sail for Jamestown, they left several people behind, some to maintain Somers' claim to the islands for [[Kingdom of England|England]], some dead. Those aboard the two ships included [[Sir Thomas Gates]], the military commander and future governor of Jamestown, [[William Strachey]], whose account of the wrecking may later have inspired [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'', and [[John Rolfe]], who would found Virginia's tobacco industry, and who left a wife and child buried in Bermuda. Rolfe would find a new bride in the [[Powhatan]] princess [[Pocahontas]].\n\nJamestown, and the sixty survivors of its original five hundred settlers, were found in such a poor state that it was decided to abandon the Jamestown settlement and return everyone to England. The timely [[Jamestown supply missions|arrival of another relief fleet]] under Thomas West from England granted the colony a reprieve. However, the food shortage was made more critical by the new arrivals. Somers returned to Bermuda on ''Patience'', captained by his nephew, Matthew, to gather provisions for the Jamestown colony, but died on Bermuda in 1610. Matthew Somers was keen to receive his inheritance (Sir George and his wife were childless, but had raised his two nephews), and took ''Patience'' to Somers' hometown, [[Lyme Regis]], and not to Virginia.\n\nWhen news reached England of the adventures of ''Sea Venture'''s survivors, the royal charter of the Virginia Company was extended to include Bermuda on the 12th of March, 1612, at Westminster, with the archipelago granted by the Crown unto the ''Treasurer and Company of Aduenturers and Planters of the Cittie of London for the first colony in Virginia''. The new colony was officially named ''Virgineola'', although this was soon changed to ''The Somers Isles'' or ''The Somers Islands'' in honour of Sir George Somers.\n\nA [[Governor of Bermuda|Governor]], Richard Moore, arrived in 1612 with settlers, aboard ''Plough'', to join those left behind by ''Sea Venture'' and ''Patience''. The new settlers were primarily tenant farmers, who gave seven years of indentured servitude to the Company in exchange for the cost of transport. Although the primary industry was envisioned to be agriculture, the early Governors enthusiastically, if mostly unsuccessfully, attempted to develop other industries also. These included pearl diving (there are no pearls in Bermuda) and [[ambergris]]. The first two slaves to arrive in Bermuda, one black, one Native American, were brought in for their skills as pearl divers.\n\nFree of the endemic warfare and other hardships which plagued the continental settlement, Bermuda thrived from the beginning, though it was never to be particularly profitable for its investors. Its population quickly surpassed that of Jamestown, and consideration was given to abandoning the North American continent and evacuating its settlers to Bermuda.\n\n==Formation of the Somers Isles Company==\nThe Virginia Company ran Bermuda until 1613, when the colony was transferred to Sir [[William Wade (English politician)|William Wade]] et cetera in exchange for \u00a32,000, who then resigned to the Crown in 1614. The Crown briefly adminstered the Colony directly before the adventurers (shareholders) of the Virginia Company formed a second company, the Somers Isles Company, to which Bermuda was transferred in 1615. The Virginia Company was dissolved in 1622, with the administration of its continental colony passing to [[the Crown]]. The Somers Isles Company, with its separate charter, continued to administer Bermuda for another six decades.\n\nThe original Adventurers of the Somers Isles Company listed in the letters patent were essentially the same as those of the Virginia Company. Major-General Sir [[John Henry Lefroy]], Governor of Bermuda from 1871 to 1877, transcribed the list which was ordered by social rank, but commented that the original list began with Henry, Earl of Southampton:<ref>J.

These were named for shareholders in the Company, and were further divided (by ''tribe roads'') into lots which equated to shares in the Company. The Company's return on investment came specifically from cash crops raised on that land. A ninth subdivision, now the eastern-most parish, was [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|Saint George's]], comprising [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|Saint George's Island]], [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|Saint David's Island]], part of the Main Island, and various smaller islands and islets around [[Castle Harbour, Bermuda|Castle Harbour]] (then known as Southampton Harbour) and [[St. George's Harbour, Bermuda|Saint George's Harbour]]. This area was held as ''common'', or ''King's'' land, and was not subdivided for exploitation by the Company. This was where the capital, [[St. George's, Bermuda|Saint George's Town]] was located. The choice of this location followed the original settlement created by ''Sea Venture'' survivors, and was also determined by the two eastern harbours being the only ones then readily accessible to shipping.\n\nA surveyor, [[Richard Norwood]], was hired to produce a survey of the colony, which also served as a census. This was completed in 1616, although he made later updates. In the process, he discovered that the total landmass of the eight commercial parishes was greater than originally estimated. His superior, [[Daniel Tucker (Governor)|Daniel Tucker]], the [[Governor of Bermuda]], appropriated a choice piece of land, equivalent to the excess, for himself.\n\n==Local government==\nThe Company continued to appoint governors until its dissolution in 1684. In 1620, however, a colonial parliament was created, the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]]. Suffrage was restricted to male land owners, and there was no upper house. An appointed council, composed primarily from the leading merchant families of the Colony, came to fill a role similar to both an upper house, and a cabinet, and often proved the true repository of power in Bermuda.\n\nThe immediate concern of the first governors was for the colony's protection from a feared Spanish or Dutch attack, and the building of fortifications, and the raising of [[Bermuda Militias 1612-1815|militias]], was sustained throughout the company's administration, and beyond. A review of the colony's defences was carried out by [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]].\n\n==Immigration, slavery, and demographics==\nImmigration of indentured servants continued throughout the Company's administration, and this pool of cheap labour meant that Bermuda never developed the slavery-based economy that came to characterise other English agricultural colonies. Although the bulk of the population remained [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] at the end of the 17th century, a number of minority groups were established under the Company's management. As England began to challenge Spain's supremacy in [[Florida]] and the [[West Indies]], Spanish-speaking Blacks began to emigrate from territories taken from [[Spain]]. These immigrants arrived under the same conditions of indenture as most English immigrants, but the white majority soon became uneasy with the increasing numbers of blacks. The terms of indenture for black West Indian immigrants were consequently raised successively from seven years to ninety-nine. An attempt was also made to encourage Blacks to emigrate under threat of being enslaved. Numbers of Black slaves were also being imported to Bermuda, primarily as the result of shipwrecks, or as part of the prizes taken by [[privateers]], although Bermudian vessels went as far as Africa specifically to acquire slaves. As England's settlements in [[New England]] expanded, large areas were ethnically cleansed to make way for European expansion. This resulted in various [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] peoples being shipped to Bermuda and sold into slavery, notably after the [[Pequot War]] and [[King Philip's War|Metacomet's War]]. A great many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] slaves were being brought to Bermuda by other means, also, possibly from as far as [[Mexico]]. The third main minority group was composed of Irish [[Prisoner of war|prisoners-of-war]] (POW), and ethnically cleansed civilians, shipped to the Colony and sold into slavery following [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell's]] bloody adventure in [[Ireland]] in the 1650s (see [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]]). Smaller numbers of Scottish POWs were also sent as a result of Cromwell's forcing his 'protectorship' on [[Scotland]].\n\nBermuda had tended towards the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] side in the [[English Civil War]], perhaps because the shareholders of the Somers Isles Company were primarily [[Nobility|nobles]], but was largely spared the effects and the aftermath of that conflict. Bermuda's [[republic]]an element, which (as in England) was largely identical to the [[Puritan]], anti-[[Episcopal polity|episcopalian]] demographic, was forced into exile, becoming the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]] who began England's settlement of the [[Bahamas]] in the 1640s.\n\n==Economy and industry==\n[[File:Historic Bermuda Hog Money.png|thumb|right|Coins minted by the Sommer Isles Company]]\n[[Agriculture]] remained the mainstay of the [[Economic system|economy]] under the Somers Isles Company. The primary cash crop was [[tobacco]], but the quantity and quality produced were very poor. The [[Bermuda cedar]] boxes in which the tobacco was shipped to England were said to be worth more than their contents, and much of the tobacco was destroyed on arrival. The Colony also had little success with other export crops. Additionally, the several acres of arable land that had been cut from the forest meant that each farmer had only a very small area under cultivation, by comparison to the {{convert|50|acre|m2}} granted to each settler in Virginia. Bermudian farmers had to raise as many as three crops a year in order to be economically viable. This meant that they could not allow fields to lie fallow, and the soil, already high in [[Alkali#Alkaline soil|alkaline]] and low in [[magnesium]] (used by plants to form [[chlorophyll]]), became depleted. By the 1620s, Virginia's tobacco exports were increasing, and newer English colonies in the West Indies were also emulating Bermuda by focusing on growing tobacco for export, with the result of drastically reducing the profitability of growing tobacco for Bermudian farmers. Bermudian farmers increasingly turned to growing food crops and rearing livestock, both to reduce their dependence on overpriced imports, and to sell to other colonies. This growing trade created a need for Bermudian-owned ships to deliver their exports.\n\nBermudians began to turn away from agriculture quite early, building boats and developing the [[Bermuda sloop]] to pursue maritime trades. As the Company derived no income, except from tobacco sent to England aboard the company's magazine ships, it acted to stymie these activities. The building of vessels was banned without its license, and the first laws to protect the [[Bermuda cedar]], which were passed early in the seventeenth century, may have been intended more to restrict shipbuilding than to conserve the resource.\n\n==Civil War==\nBy the 1630s, the company had ceased sending Governors to Bermuda and began appointing a string of prominent Bermudians, such as [[William Sayle]], to the role. As few Adventurers actually settled in Bermuda, with their properties instead managed by poorer relatives or tenants, the local House of Assembly was necessarily elected without a property qualification, unlike the [[House of Commons of England]]. This meant it was far more concerned with the interests of the islanders, rather than the Adventurers in England. By the mid-17th century, with tobacco exports failing, many Adventurers in England eagerly cut their losses by selling their shares to the tenants who occupied. Bermudians quickly became the majority of landowners, but the Adventurers who remained in England maintained control of the Company by barring any shareholder who did not personally attend meetings in England from the decision-making process. Many of those English shareholders belonged to the [[gentry]] and anti-[[Episcopal polity|Episcopalian]] sects within the [[Church of England]], and sided with the [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarians]] during the 1642-1651 [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. Given the increasingly hostile relationship between Bermudians and the Company, the majority of Bermudians sided with the Crown. With control of the military forces in Bermuda as well as the Assembly, the Royalists deposed the Company appointed Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimigham in his stead. The colony's Independents, who sided with Parliament, were forced into exile, settling the [[Bahamas]] under the Cromwell-loyalist [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]].\n\nThe response of Parliament to what was characterised as the rebellion of Bermuda (and of other colonies, particularly Virginia, [[Barbados]], and [[Antigua]]) was the passage of [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] in October, 1650. This called for ''due punishment [to be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada's, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.''{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nParliamentary privateers were authorised to act against English vessels trading with these colonies: {{lang|enm|All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.}}{{cn|date=September 2018}} Parliament made preparations to invade the Royalist colonies, but the outbreak of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1651 was to engulf the British West Indies in war with France and Holland. A thousand miles distant, Bermuda was untouched by that war and reached a compromise with Parliament.\n\nWith the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], Bermudians found they had a powerful ally in the Crown, which had its own interest in wresting control of the English Empire from corporations like the Somers Isles Company.\n\n==Revocation of charter and dissolution==\nIt was worsening interference by the Company into the livelihoods of the islanders which led to its dissolution. A protest to the Crown resulting initially from the treatment of [[Perient Trott]] and his heirs, but expanding to include the Company's wider mismanagement of the colony, was directed to the Crown. This led to a lengthy court case in which the Crown championed Bermudians against the Company. This resulted in the Company's Royal Charter being revoked in 1684, and from then on the Crown assumed responsibility for appointing the Colony's governors (it first re-appointed the last company governor).

It held a [[royal charter]] for Bermuda until 1684, when it was dissolved, and [[the Crown]] assumed responsibility for the administration of Bermuda as a [[crown colony|royal colony]].\n\n==Bermuda under the Virginia Company==\n{{see also|Jamestown supply missions}}\n[[Image:Generall Historie of Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|\"[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]\", by [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]]]]\nBermuda had been settled, inadvertently, in 1609 by the [[Virginia Company]] when its flagship, ''[[Sea Venture]]'', was wrecked on the reefs to its east.<ref>A Discovery of The Barmudas, Sylvester Jordain</ref> The Admiral of the Company, [[George Somers|Sir George Somers]], was at the helm as the ship fought a storm that had broken apart [[Third Supply|a relief fleet]] destined for [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], the Virginian settlement established by the Company two years earlier. Somers had deliberately driven the ship onto the reefs to prevent its foundering, thereby saving all aboard.<ref>Woodward, Hobson. ''A Brave Vessel: The True Tale of the Castaways Who Rescued Jamestown and Inspired Shakespeare's The Tempest''. Viking (2009) pp. 32\u201350.</ref>\n\nThe settlers and seamen spent ten months in Bermuda while they built two new ships to continue the voyage to Jamestown. During the building, ''Sea Venture'''s longboat was fitted with a mast and sent to find Jamestown. Neither it, nor its crew, was ever seen again. When [[Sea Venture|''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'']] set sail for Jamestown, they left several people behind, some to maintain Somers' claim to the islands for [[Kingdom of England|England]], some dead. Those aboard the two ships included [[Sir Thomas Gates]], the military commander and future governor of Jamestown, [[William Strachey]], whose account of the wrecking may later have inspired [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'', and [[John Rolfe]], who would found Virginia's tobacco industry, and who left a wife and child buried in Bermuda. Rolfe would find a new bride in the [[Powhatan]] princess [[Pocahontas]].\n\nJamestown, and the sixty survivors of its original five hundred settlers, were found in such a poor state that it was decided to abandon the Jamestown settlement and return everyone to England. The timely [[Jamestown supply missions|arrival of another relief fleet]] under Thomas West from England granted the colony a reprieve. However, the food shortage was made more critical by the new arrivals. Somers returned to Bermuda on ''Patience'', captained by his nephew, Matthew, to gather provisions for the Jamestown colony, but died on Bermuda in 1610. Matthew Somers was keen to receive his inheritance (Sir George and his wife were childless, but had raised his two nephews), and took ''Patience'' to Somers' hometown, [[Lyme Regis]], and not to Virginia.\n\nWhen news reached England of the adventures of ''Sea Venture'''s survivors, the royal charter of the Virginia Company was extended to include Bermuda on the 12th of March, 1612, at Westminster, with the archipelago granted by the Crown unto the ''Treasurer and Company of Aduenturers and Planters of the Cittie of London for the first colony in Virginia''. The new colony was officially named ''Virgineola'', although this was soon changed to ''The Somers Isles'' or ''The Somers Islands'' in honour of Sir George Somers.\n\nA [[Governor of Bermuda|Governor]], Richard Moore, arrived in 1612 with settlers, aboard ''Plough'', to join those left behind by ''Sea Venture'' and ''Patience''. The new settlers were primarily tenant farmers, who gave seven years of indentured servitude to the Company in exchange for the cost of transport. Although the primary industry was envisioned to be agriculture, the early Governors enthusiastically, if mostly unsuccessfully, attempted to develop other industries also. These included pearl diving (there are no pearls in Bermuda) and [[ambergris]]. The first two slaves to arrive in Bermuda, one black, one Native American, were brought in for their skills as pearl divers.\n\nFree of the endemic warfare and other hardships which plagued the continental settlement, Bermuda thrived from the beginning, though it was never to be particularly profitable for its investors. Its population quickly surpassed that of Jamestown, and consideration was given to abandoning the North American continent and evacuating its settlers to Bermuda.\n\n==Formation of the Somers Isles Company==\nThe Virginia Company ran Bermuda until 1613, when the colony was transferred to Sir [[William Wade (English politician)|William Wade]] et cetera in exchange for \u00a32,000, who then resigned to the Crown in 1614. The Crown briefly adminstered the Colony directly before the adventurers (shareholders) of the Virginia Company formed a second company, the Somers Isles Company, to which Bermuda was transferred in 1615. The Virginia Company was dissolved in 1622, with the administration of its continental colony passing to [[the Crown]]. The Somers Isles Company, with its separate charter, continued to administer Bermuda for another six decades.\n\nThe original Adventurers of the Somers Isles Company listed in the letters patent were essentially the same as those of the Virginia Company. Major-General Sir [[John Henry Lefroy]], Governor of Bermuda from 1871 to 1877, transcribed the list which was ordered by social rank, but commented that the original list began with Henry, Earl of Southampton:<ref>J.

These were named for shareholders in the Company, and were further divided (by ''tribe roads'') into lots which equated to shares in the Company. The Company's return on investment came specifically from cash crops raised on that land. A ninth subdivision, now the eastern-most parish, was [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|Saint George's]], comprising [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|Saint George's Island]], [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|Saint David's Island]], part of the Main Island, and various smaller islands and islets around [[Castle Harbour, Bermuda|Castle Harbour]] (then known as Southampton Harbour) and [[St. George's Harbour, Bermuda|Saint George's Harbour]]. This area was held as ''common'', or ''King's'' land, and was not subdivided for exploitation by the Company. This was where the capital, [[St. George's, Bermuda|Saint George's Town]] was located. The choice of this location followed the original settlement created by ''Sea Venture'' survivors, and was also determined by the two eastern harbours being the only ones then readily accessible to shipping.\n\nA surveyor, [[Richard Norwood]], was hired to produce a survey of the colony, which also served as a census. This was completed in 1616, although he made later updates. In the process, he discovered that the total landmass of the eight commercial parishes was greater than originally estimated. His superior, [[Daniel Tucker (Governor)|Daniel Tucker]], the [[Governor of Bermuda]], appropriated a choice piece of land, equivalent to the excess, for himself.\n\n==Local government==\nThe Company continued to appoint governors until its dissolution in 1684. In 1620, however, a colonial parliament was created, the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]]. Suffrage was restricted to male land owners, and there was no upper house. An appointed council, composed primarily from the leading merchant families of the Colony, came to fill a role similar to both an upper house, and a cabinet, and often proved the true repository of power in Bermuda.\n\nThe immediate concern of the first governors was for the colony's protection from a feared Spanish or Dutch attack, and the building of fortifications, and the raising of [[Bermuda Militias 1612-1815|militias]], was sustained throughout the company's administration, and beyond. A review of the colony's defences was carried out by [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]].\n\n==Immigration, slavery, and demographics==\nImmigration of indentured servants continued throughout the Company's administration, and this pool of cheap labour meant that Bermuda never developed the slavery-based economy that came to characterise other English agricultural colonies. Although the bulk of the population remained [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] at the end of the 17th century, a number of minority groups were established under the Company's management. As England began to challenge Spain's supremacy in [[Florida]] and the [[West Indies]], Spanish-speaking Blacks began to emigrate from territories taken from [[Spain]]. These immigrants arrived under the same conditions of indenture as most English immigrants, but the white majority soon became uneasy with the increasing numbers of blacks. The terms of indenture for black West Indian immigrants were consequently raised successively from seven years to ninety-nine. An attempt was also made to encourage Blacks to emigrate under threat of being enslaved. Numbers of Black slaves were also being imported to Bermuda, primarily as the result of shipwrecks, or as part of the prizes taken by [[privateers]], although Bermudian vessels went as far as Africa specifically to acquire slaves. As England's settlements in [[New England]] expanded, large areas were ethnically cleansed to make way for European expansion. This resulted in various [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] peoples being shipped to Bermuda and sold into slavery, notably after the [[Pequot War]] and [[King Philip's War|Metacomet's War]]. A great many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] slaves were being brought to Bermuda by other means, also, possibly from as far as [[Mexico]]. The third main minority group was composed of Irish [[Prisoner of war|prisoners-of-war]] (POW), and ethnically cleansed civilians, shipped to the Colony and sold into slavery following [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell's]] bloody adventure in [[Ireland]] in the 1650s (see [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]]). Smaller numbers of Scottish POWs were also sent as a result of Cromwell's forcing his 'protectorship' on [[Scotland]].\n\nBermuda had tended towards the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] side in the [[English Civil War]], perhaps because the shareholders of the Somers Isles Company were primarily [[Nobility|nobles]], but was largely spared the effects and the aftermath of that conflict. Bermuda's [[republic]]an element, which (as in England) was largely identical to the [[Puritan]], anti-[[Episcopal polity|episcopalian]] demographic, was forced into exile, becoming the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]] who began England's settlement of the [[Bahamas]] in the 1640s.\n\n==Economy and industry==\n[[File:Historic Bermuda Hog Money.png|thumb|right|Coins minted by the Sommer Isles Company]]\n[[Agriculture]] remained the mainstay of the [[Economic system|economy]] under the Somers Isles Company. The primary cash crop was [[tobacco]], but the quantity and quality produced were very poor. The [[Bermuda cedar]] boxes in which the tobacco was shipped to England were said to be worth more than their contents, and much of the tobacco was destroyed on arrival. The Colony also had little success with other export crops. Additionally, the several acres of arable land that had been cut from the forest meant that each farmer had only a very small area under cultivation, by comparison to the {{convert|50|acre|m2}} granted to each settler in Virginia. Bermudian farmers had to raise as many as three crops a year in order to be economically viable. This meant that they could not allow fields to lie fallow, and the soil, already high in [[Alkali#Alkaline soil|alkaline]] and low in [[magnesium]] (used by plants to form [[chlorophyll]]), became depleted. By the 1620s, Virginia's tobacco exports were increasing, and newer English colonies in the West Indies were also emulating Bermuda by focusing on growing tobacco for export, with the result of drastically reducing the profitability of growing tobacco for Bermudian farmers. Bermudian farmers increasingly turned to growing food crops and rearing livestock, both to reduce their dependence on overpriced imports, and to sell to other colonies. This growing trade created a need for Bermudian-owned ships to deliver their exports.\n\nBermudians began to turn away from agriculture quite early, building boats and developing the [[Bermuda sloop]] to pursue maritime trades. As the Company derived no income, except from tobacco sent to England aboard the company's magazine ships, it acted to stymie these activities. The building of vessels was banned without its license, and the first laws to protect the [[Bermuda cedar]], which were passed early in the seventeenth century, may have been intended more to restrict shipbuilding than to conserve the resource.\n\n==Civil War==\nBy the 1630s, the company had ceased sending Governors to Bermuda and began appointing a string of prominent Bermudians, such as [[William Sayle]], to the role. As few Adventurers actually settled in Bermuda, with their properties instead managed by poorer relatives or tenants, the local House of Assembly was necessarily elected without a property qualification, unlike the [[House of Commons of England]]. This meant it was far more concerned with the interests of the islanders, rather than the Adventurers in England. By the mid-17th century, with tobacco exports failing, many Adventurers in England eagerly cut their losses by selling their shares to the tenants who occupied. Bermudians quickly became the majority of landowners, but the Adventurers who remained in England maintained control of the Company by barring any shareholder who did not personally attend meetings in England from the decision-making process. Many of those English shareholders belonged to the [[gentry]] and anti-[[Episcopal polity|Episcopalian]] sects within the [[Church of England]], and sided with the [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarians]] during the 1642-1651 [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. Given the increasingly hostile relationship between Bermudians and the Company, the majority of Bermudians sided with the Crown. With control of the military forces in Bermuda as well as the Assembly, the Royalists deposed the Company appointed Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimigham in his stead. The colony's Independents, who sided with Parliament, were forced into exile, settling the [[Bahamas]] under the Cromwell-loyalist [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]].\n\nThe response of Parliament to what was characterised as the rebellion of Bermuda (and of other colonies, particularly Virginia, [[Barbados]], and [[Antigua]]) was the passage of [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] in October, 1650. This called for ''due punishment [to be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada's, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.''{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nParliamentary privateers were authorised to act against English vessels trading with these colonies: {{lang|enm|All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.}}{{cn|date=September 2018}} Parliament made preparations to invade the Royalist colonies, but the outbreak of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1651 was to engulf the British West Indies in war with France and Holland. A thousand miles distant, Bermuda was untouched by that war and reached a compromise with Parliament.\n\nWith the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], Bermudians found they had a powerful ally in the Crown, which had its own interest in wresting control of the English Empire from corporations like the Somers Isles Company.\n\n==Revocation of charter and dissolution==\nIt was worsening interference by the Company into the livelihoods of the islanders which led to its dissolution. A protest to the Crown resulting initially from the treatment of [[Perient Trott]] and his heirs, but expanding to include the Company's wider mismanagement of the colony, was directed to the Crown. This led to a lengthy court case in which the Crown championed Bermudians against the Company. This resulted in the Company's Royal Charter being revoked in 1684, and from then on the Crown assumed responsibility for appointing the Colony's governors (it first re-appointed the last company governor). Freed of the Company's restraints, the local merchant class came to dominate and shape Bermuda's progress, as Bermudians abandoned agriculture en masse and turned to the sea.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Companies}}\n* [[History of Bermuda]]\n* [[History of Virginia]]\n* [[Jamestown, Virginia]]\n* [[List of trading companies]]\n* [[London Company|Virginia Company of London]]\n* [[Sea Venture]]\n* [[Virginia Company]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Roots Web [http://www.rootsweb.com/~bmuwgw/norwoodsurvey.html Richard Norwood\u2019s Survey of the Land and Landholder\u2019s of Bermuda].\n* Bermuda Yellow Pages [http://www.bermudayp.com/history.html History of Bermuda]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.\n* Dan Byrnes.

He became a popular concert pianist in [[Australia]] and was a founding member of the [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music|New South Wales Conservatorium of Music]], where he taught for fifty years.\n\n==Early life and education==\nHutchens' parents, Richard Lavers Hutchens and his wife Maria Siles, n\u00e9e Hoskins, both [[Cornish Australian|Cornish]],<ref>http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090410b.htm?hilite=cornish</ref> migrated to [[New Zealand]] in 1879.  Richard tried his hand at farming and bootmaking before settling down at [[H\u0101wera]] as a piano teacher. Frank Hutchens was born in [[Leeston]] near [[Christchurch]] on 15 January 1892. He attended Hawera District High School.\n\nIn 1904, at the age of twelve, Hutchens had the opportunity to demonstrate his talents after his piano teacher arranged for him to play for the virtuoso [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignaz Paderewski]], who was then touring New Zealand. Impressed with the boy's potential, Paderewski encouraged him to study in [[Europe]]. The following year, at the age of thirteen, Hutchens travelled alone to [[London]] to attend the [[Royal Academy of Music]], where he studied piano and composition with [[Tobias Matthay]] and [[Frederick Corder]]. At the Academy, he won the [[William Sterndale Bennett|Sterndale Bennett]] and [[Sigismond Thalberg|Thalberg]] scholarships, and also the Hine Prize and the Chappell gold medal for pianoforte playing. In 1909, at the age of 17, he became the youngest sub-professor yet appointed to the Academy.<ref name=amc>Australian Music Centre.</ref> In 1911 however, he was forced to return home after his mother fell ill and the family faced financial difficulties.\n\n==Later career==\nHaving given many recitals in New Zealand, Hutchens decided in 1913 to return to London to resume his career, but after arriving in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] for a stopover, he was given the opportunity to perform with the Sydney Amateur Orchestral Society conducted by [[Alfred Hill (composer)|Alfred Hill]]. He decided to stay, and in 1915 was offered a position by [[Henri Verbrugghen]] as a founding professor with the newly formed [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music|New South Wales Conservatorium of Music]], which he accepted. Hutchens was rejected for military service in 1916, and he went on to become an influential teacher, retaining his role as a professor with the Conservatorium for fifty years. Prior to his death in 1965 at the age of 73, he was the only remaining original member of the Conservatorium on staff.\n\nIn addition to his successful teaching career, Hutchens in 1924 formed a piano duo with [[Lindley Evans]], which was destined to become another long and successful partnership. Over the course of the next forty years, Hutchens and Evans made many tours of Australia and New Zealand, giving concerts and broadcasts, and they were among the first composer-performer teams to be recorded commercially in Australia.\n\nHighlights of the partnership included the premiere of Hutchens' own work the ''Fantasie Concerto'' and Evans' ''Idyll'' with the [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]] in 1943 (later recorded by the duo in 1962), a recital for [[Nellie Melba|Dame Nellie Melba]], and the premiere performance in Australia of [[Francis Poulenc]]'s [[Concerto for two pianos (Poulenc)|Concerto for Two Pianos in D minor]]. The success of the Hutchens-Evans partnership enabled them to establish a scholarship for young musicians, funded by their own concerts.\n\nAs an examiner for the [[Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]] and [[Trinity College of Music]] in London, Hutchens had the requisite experience to assist in the establishment of the [[Australian Music Examinations Board]] as an independent body. He was also a professor at the [[Newcastle Conservatorium of Music]], President of the NSW Musical Association, a director of APRA, and a member of the Sydney Conservatorium's advisory board.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1955 Hutchens married Joyce White, granddaughter of [[Robert Hoddle Driberg White|R. H. D. White]]. His wife, a former pupil of his whom he had known since 1927, was a musician herself who gave much encouragement to his career. The couple had no children.\n\nHe was still active as a performer and teacher when he sustained fatal injuries in a car accident that occurred in Sydney's northern suburbs.

He became a popular concert pianist in [[Australia]] and was a founding member of the [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music|New South Wales Conservatorium of Music]], where he taught for fifty years.\n\n==Early life and education==\nHutchens' parents, Richard Lavers Hutchens and his wife Maria Siles, n\u00e9e Hoskins, both [[Cornish Australian|Cornish]],<ref>http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090410b.htm?hilite=cornish</ref> migrated to [[New Zealand]] in 1879.  Richard tried his hand at farming and bootmaking before settling down at [[Hawera]] as a piano teacher. Frank Hutchens was born in [[Leeston]] near [[Christchurch]] on 15 January 1892. He attended Hawera District High School.\n\nIn 1904, at the age of twelve, Hutchens had the opportunity to demonstrate his talents after his piano teacher arranged for him to play for the virtuoso [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignaz Paderewski]], who was then touring New Zealand. Impressed with the boy's potential, Paderewski encouraged him to study in [[Europe]]. The following year, at the age of thirteen, Hutchens travelled alone to [[London]] to attend the [[Royal Academy of Music]], where he studied piano and composition with [[Tobias Matthay]] and [[Frederick Corder]]. At the Academy, he won the [[William Sterndale Bennett|Sterndale Bennett]] and [[Sigismond Thalberg|Thalberg]] scholarships, and also the Hine Prize and the Chappell gold medal for pianoforte playing. In 1909, at the age of 17, he became the youngest sub-professor yet appointed to the Academy.<ref name=amc>Australian Music Centre.</ref> In 1911 however, he was forced to return home after his mother fell ill and the family faced financial difficulties.\n\n==Later career==\nHaving given many recitals in New Zealand, Hutchens decided in 1913 to return to London to resume his career, but after arriving in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] for a stopover, he was given the opportunity to perform with the Sydney Amateur Orchestral Society conducted by [[Alfred Hill (composer)|Alfred Hill]]. He decided to stay, and in 1915 was offered a position by [[Henri Verbrugghen]] as a founding professor with the newly formed [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music|New South Wales Conservatorium of Music]], which he accepted. Hutchens was rejected for military service in 1916, and he went on to become an influential teacher, retaining his role as a professor with the Conservatorium for fifty years. Prior to his death in 1965 at the age of 73, he was the only remaining original member of the Conservatorium on staff.\n\nIn addition to his successful teaching career, Hutchens in 1924 formed a piano duo with [[Lindley Evans]], which was destined to become another long and successful partnership. Over the course of the next forty years, Hutchens and Evans made many tours of Australia and New Zealand, giving concerts and broadcasts, and they were among the first composer-performer teams to be recorded commercially in Australia.\n\nHighlights of the partnership included the premiere of Hutchens' own work the ''Fantasie Concerto'' and Evans' ''Idyll'' with the [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]] in 1943 (later recorded by the duo in 1962), a recital for [[Nellie Melba|Dame Nellie Melba]], and the premiere performance in Australia of [[Francis Poulenc]]'s [[Concerto for two pianos (Poulenc)|Concerto for Two Pianos in D minor]]. The success of the Hutchens-Evans partnership enabled them to establish a scholarship for young musicians, funded by their own concerts.\n\nAs an examiner for the [[Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]] and [[Trinity College of Music]] in London, Hutchens had the requisite experience to assist in the establishment of the [[Australian Music Examinations Board]] as an independent body. He was also a professor at the [[Newcastle Conservatorium of Music]], President of the NSW Musical Association, a director of APRA, and a member of the Sydney Conservatorium's advisory board.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1955 Hutchens married Joyce White, granddaughter of [[Robert Hoddle Driberg White|R. H. D. White]]. His wife, a former pupil of his whom he had known since 1927, was a musician herself who gave much encouragement to his career. The couple had no children.\n\nHe was still active as a performer and teacher when he sustained fatal injuries in a car accident that occurred in Sydney's northern suburbs. On 18 October 1965, he died at  the nearby [[Mona Vale Hospital]].\n\n==Awards and honours==\nHutchens was made a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Music in 1939, and was also named a \"Bard of Cornwall\". In the 1962 [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] he was appointed an Officer (OBE) of the [[Order of the British Empire]] for \"services to Music in the State of New South Wales.\"<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=42683|supp=y|page=4327|date=25 May 1962}}</ref>\n\nScholarships in composition are awarded annually in his name to students under 25, and his portrait, by [[Cornwall|Cornish]] painter [[Stanhope Forbes]], is held by the Sydney Conservatorium to which he devoted so much of his working life.\n\n==Music==\nHutchens wrote a considerable amount of music, and his works are said to have \"charm and craftsmanship\".<ref>Bainton.</ref> Among his best-known works are the ''Concerto Symphonique'' for piano and orchestra, the ''Concerto'' and ''Quintet'' (both for piano and strings), the ''Fantasie Concerto'', and ''Air Mail Palestine'' for baritone and orchestra.

Bordeaux is the centre of the [[Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] that has a population of 783,081 (2017) and includes its [[suburb]]s and close [[satellite town]]s. With 1,195,335 in the metropolitan area, it is the sixth-largest in France, after Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, and Lille. It is the capital of the [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] region, as well as the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called ''\"Bordelais\"'' (for men) or ''\"Bordelaises\"'' (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\n\nBeing at the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region, Bordeaux remains a prominent powerhouse and exercises significant influence on the world wine industry although no wine production is conducted within the city limits.

The Romans were defeated and their commander, the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]], was killed in battle.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/138248 |title=Places: 138248 (Burdigala) |author=Sivan, H., R.

During this period were built the amphitheatre and the momument ''Les Piliers de Tutelle''.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"140\" heights=\"140\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Bordeaux - Pilliers de Tutelle.jpg|''Les Piliers de Tutelle''\nFile:Bordeaux - Palais Gallien 2.jpg|The Roman amphitheatre\n</gallery>\n\nIn 276 it was sacked by the [[Vandals]]. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the [[Visigoths]] in 414, and the [[Franks]] in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\n[[File:Merovingian tremisses minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint Etienne late 6th century.jpg|140px|thumb|left|upright|[[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Tremissis|tremisses]] minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint-\u00c9tienne, late 6th century. [[British Museum]].]]\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Francia|kingdom of the Franks]], but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish [[Duchy of Vasconia]]. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of [[County of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and fought the Basques.\n\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|Abd er Rahman]] who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. [[Odo the Great|Duke Eudes]] mustered a force to engage the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], eventually engaging them in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\n\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian [[Hunald I|duke Hunald]] led a rebellion to which [[Charles]] responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\n\nDuring the last stage of the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|war against Aquitaine]] (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King [[Pepin the Short]].  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (''Frontiacus'', ''Franciacus'') near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (''Wascones''), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\n\nIn 778 [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin (or Sihimin)]] was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupo]], and possibly leading to the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]<sup>[9]-</sup>. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], sometimes the [[Count of Bordeaux|Counts of Bordeaux]] held the title concomitantly with that of [[Duke of Gascony|Duke of Vasconia]]. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the [[Viking]]s when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin II]] marched on them but was captured and executed.\n\nAlthough the [[Port de la Lune|port of Bordeaux]] was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and [[Vikings|Norman]] invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] and [[Henry Plantagenet]] in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux</ref> After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\">https://www.bordeaux-port.fr/en/port-bordeaux/history</ref>\n\n=== 12th century to the 15th century, the English era ===\n\n[[File:Arms of the city of Bordeaux (In the time of Richard C\u0153ur de Lion).svg|120px|thumb|First Arms of the city, in the time of [[Richard I of England]]]]\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|El\u00e9onore]] of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in [[Le Mans]], who within months of their wedding became King [[Henry II of England]]. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the [[Bordeaux Cathedral|cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9]] and the belfry (Grosse Cloche) were built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul.<ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/bordeaux/background/history/a/nar/5e51aa7a-15f6-47ad-8ad8-719613858dc0/359293</ref> It was also the capital of an independent state under [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1362\u20131372), but after the [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory.\n\n=== 15th century to the 17th century  ===\n\n[[File:Coat of arms of Bordeaux, France.svg|120px|thumb|Coat of arms after the French Reconquest]]\n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only begun to regain its importance during the 17th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], along with its traditional wine exports.<ref>''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', \"Bordeaux struggles with slave past\", 28 September 2009.</ref>\n\nBordeaux adhered to the [[Fronde]], being effectively annexed to the [[Kingdom of France]] only in 1653, when the army of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] entered the city.\n\n=== 18th century to the 19th century, the golden era ===\n\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux<ref>https://www.commanderie.org/showRegion.action</ref>. The [[Port of the Moon]] supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\"/> Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. [[Victor Hugo]] found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], add [[Antwerp]], and you have Bordeaux\". [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann]], a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to transform a then still quasi-medieval [[Paris]] into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\n\nTowards the end of the [[Peninsula war]] on 12 March 1814, the [[Duke of Wellington]] sent [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Beresford]] with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-[[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] and the majority supported the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Deuxieme vue du port de Bordeaux prise du ch\u00e2teau Trompette.jpg|thumb|right|[[Port of the Moon]] in 1759\nFile:Hugo d'Alesi, vue cavali\u00e8re de Bordeaux, 1899, Archives de Bordeaux m\u00e9tropole.jpg|Aerial view of the [[Port of the Moon]] in 1899\n</gallery>\n\n\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] against [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux  |title=Bordeaux |accessed date= March 30, 2020 12:03 am</ref>. This recurred during the [[World War I]] and again very briefly during the [[World War II]], when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-074-2852-36A, Bordeaux, Platzkonzert der Wehrmacht.jpg|200px|thumb|The square of the Comedy during Occupation]]\n\nDuring the [[Word War II]], Bordeaux fell under [[German Occupation]].\n\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (''[[Regia Marina]] Italiana'') established [[BETASOM]], a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] from this base, which was also a major base for German [[U-boat]]s as headquarters of [[12th U-boat Flotilla]]. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBordeaux is located close to the European [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the [[Garonne|river Garonne]], and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to [[ocean liner]]s through the [[Gironde estuary]]. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n== Climate ==\n\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), or in the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\n\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches {{convert|21|to|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}). The average seasonal winter temperature is {{convert|7.1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is {{convert|20.7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The [[2003 European heat wave|summer of 2003]] set a record with an average temperature of {{convert|23.3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.<ref>GHCN climate, GISS world climate averages, 1971\u20132000</ref>\n\n{{Bordeaux weatherbox}}\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\n\n{{As of|2014}}, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n=== Wine ===\n\n{{Main|Bordeaux wine}}\n\n[[File:Haut Brion exterior.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]]]]\n\nThe wine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |title=World Atlas of Wine |edition=4th|year=1994 |place=London |publisher=Octopus Publishing Group Ltd |page=13}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1 Saint-\u00c9milion aerial pano 2016.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Saint-\u00c9milion]] aerial view]]\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about {{convert|116160|ha|acre}} of [[vineyard]]s, 57 [[appellations]], 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/bordeaux.html|title=Bordeaux Wine Region in France: World's Most Famous Fine Wine Region|publisher=IntoWine.com|accessdate=23 October 2009}}</ref> the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five ''premier cru'' ([[First Growth|first growth]]) red wines (four from [[M\u00e9doc]] and one, [[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]], from [[Graves]]), established by the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]]:\n\nBoth red and [[Wine|white wines]] are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called [[claret]] in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit verdot]], [[Malbec]], and, less commonly in recent years, [[Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re]].\n\nWhite Bordeaux is made from [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[S\u00e9millon]], and [[Muscadelle]]. [[Graves (wine region)|Sauternes]] is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, [[dessert wine]]s such as [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem]].\n\nBecause of a wine glut ([[wine lake]]) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and [[vine pull schemes]], the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\n\nThe [[Cit\u00e9 du Vin]], a [[museum]] as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and [[Academia|academic]] [[seminar]]s on the theme of [[wine]] opened its doors in June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2016/02/19/la-cite-du-vin-cernee-par-les-chantiers-2278033-2780.php|title=Bordeaux : la Cit\u00e9 du vin cern\u00e9e par les chantiers|date=19 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Others ===\n\nThe [[Laser M\u00e9gajoule]] will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing [[Research|fundamental research]] and the development of the [[laser]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] technologies. This project, carried by the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Ministry of Defence]], involves an investment of 2&nbsp;billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of [[regional planning]], promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\n\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]], [[EADS Sogerma]], [[Snecma]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], SNPE, and others. The [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault Falcon]] private jets are built there as well as the [[military aircraft]] [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]], the [[Airbus A380]] [[cockpit]], the [[Booster (rocketry)|boosters]] of [[Ariane 5]], and the [[M51 (missile)|M51 SLBM]] [[missile]].\n\nTourism, especially [[wine tourism]], is a major industry.

Then came [[Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou]] with 22.01%, followed by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected [[President of the Republic]] with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round.\n\n=== Parliamentary elections of 2007 ===\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate [[Beatrice Desaigues]]. In the second round, it was [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]]. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\n=== Municipal elections of 2008 ===\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist [[Alain Rousset]]. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]] in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\n=== European elections of 2009 ===\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\n\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\n\n<small>''Only candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed''</small>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2007 Presidential Election<ref>[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Elections/Les-resultats/Presidentielles/elecresult__presidentielle_2007/%28path%29/presidentielle_2007/072/033/33063.html R\u00e9sultat de l'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 2007 \u00e0 Bordeaux] sur le site du minist\u00e8re de l'int\u00e9rieur.</ref>\n!rowspan=2|Candidate !!colspan=2|Ist round !!colspan=2|IInd round\n|-\n!Bordeaux !!

The central lift span is {{convert|117|m|ft|0|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} and can be lifted vertically up to {{convert|53|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], who was a former Prime Minister and [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of Bordeaux.\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\n[[File:Rue Sainte-Catherine (Bordeaux) 2005.JPG|140px|thumb|''Rue Sainte-Catherine'']]\n\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is ''[[Sainte-Catherine Street (Bordeaux)|Rue Sainte-Catherine]]''. This pedestrian-only shopping street has {{convert|1.2|km|mi|sp=us}} of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. ''Rue Sainte-Catherine'' starts at ''Place de la Victoire'' and ends at ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' by the ''Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre''. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' and the nearby ''Cours de l'Intendance'' is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\n\n=== Culture ===\n\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, ''[[Arc en r\u00eave]]''.{{citation needed |date=January 2018}} Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the [[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux|Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux]]. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\n\n<gallery widths=\"140\" heights=\"140\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:GrandTheatreBordeaux2.jpg|''[[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux]]''\nFile:Bordeaux - Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Femina.jpg|''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Femina''\nFile:RB 20200222 Bordeaux-11.jpg|''MECA, Maison de l\u2019\u00c9conomie Cr\u00e9ative et de la Culture en Aquitaine''\n</gallery>\n\n== Transport ==\n\n=== Road ===\n\nBordeaux is an important road and [[Interchange (road)|motorway junction]]. The city is connected to Paris by the [[A10 autoroute (France)|A10]] motorway, with Lyon by the [[A89 autoroute|A89]], with Toulouse by the [[A62 autoroute|A62]], and with Spain by the [[A63 autoroute|A63]]. There is a {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Beltway|ring road]] called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\n[[File:Pont d&#039;Aquitaine, Bordeaux.JPG|200px|thumb|[[Pont d'Aquitaine]]]]\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the [[Garonne]], the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the [[Pont d'Aquitaine]], a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the [[Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas]], was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a [[vertical-lift bridge]] with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |title=Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc \u2013 La CUB |date=24 October 2013 |work=archive.org |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024224845/http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nLacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. [[Bike lane|Cycle lanes]] and [[bus lane]]s that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid [[bicycle-sharing system]] with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n=== Rail ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux Gare StJean R01.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nThe main railway station, [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]], near the center of the city, has 12&nbsp;million passengers a year. It is served by the French national ([[SNCF]]) railway's high speed train, the [[TGV]], that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as [[Lille]], Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], Geneva and London. The TGV also serves [[Toulouse]] and [[Irun]] (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to [[Nantes]], Nice, [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]]. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains ([[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]]) operated by the SNCF to [[Arcachon]], [[Limoges]], [[Agen]], [[P\u00e9rigueux]], [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]], [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and [[Bayonne]].\n\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by [[Gustave Eiffel]], to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\n\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of {{convert|30|km/h|0|abbr=on}} became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at {{convert|60|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://aquitaine.fr/politiques-regionales/transports/pont-ferroviaire-de-bordeaux.html Pont Ferroviaire de Bordeaux] on aquitaine.fr</ref> During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\n\nSince July 2017, the [[LGV Sud Europe Atlantique]] is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n[[File:Tour Bordeaux.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]]]]\n\n=== Air ===\n\nBordeaux is served by [[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]], located {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city centre in the suburban city of [[M\u00e9rignac, Gironde|M\u00e9rignac]].\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux tram kruising I.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Tramway de Bordeaux]]]]\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called [[Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n* 4 [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram lines]] ([[Bordeaux Tramway Line A|A]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line B|B]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line C|C]] and [[Bordeaux Tramway Line D|D]])\n* 75 [[Bus lines in Bordeaux|bus routes]], all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n* 13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\n* An [[Trolleybus|electric bus]] shuttle in the city centre\n* A boat shuttle on the Garonne river\nThis network is operated from 5&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;am.\n\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the [[Tramway de Bordeaux]] system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology [[Ground-level power supply|(APS)]], a new cable-free technology developed by French company [[Alstom]] and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with [[Limited-access road|limited access]] for cars.\n\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/transports/bordeaux-voici-le-trace-du-tramway-qui-va-desservir-l-aeroport-1461940859|title=Bordeaux : voici le trac\u00e9 du tramway qui va desservir l'a\u00e9roport|date=29 April 2016|website=France Bleu}}</ref>\n\n=== Taxis ===\n\nThere are more than 400 [[taxicab]]s in Bordeaux.\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]], which was a venue for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1938 and 1998, as well as the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. In the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the [[Battle of Bordeaux (football)|Battle of Bordeaux]]. The ground was formerly known as the ''Stade du Parc Lescure'' until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].\n\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Girondins de Bordeaux]] is the [[association football|football]] team, playing in [[Ligue 1]] in the [[Football in France|French football]] championship. [[Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles]] is a [[rugby union|rugby]] team in the [[Top 14]] in the [[National Rugby League (France)|Ligue Nationale de Rugby]].\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\n\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest [[cricket]] teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\n\nThere is a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} wooden [[velodrome]], V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|UCI Track Cycling World Cup]] events.\n\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Stirling Moss]], [[Jean Behra]] and [[Maurice Trintignant]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pike |first1=Tim |title=When Bordeaux city centre became a Formula 1 racing track |url=http://invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com/2014/07/when-bordeaux-city-centre-became.html |website=invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Ausonius.jpg|[[Ausonius]]\nFile:Richard II King of England.jpg|[[Richard II of England]]\nFile:Michel-eyquem-de-montaigne 1.jpg|[[Michel de Montaigne]]\nFile:Charles Montesquieu.jpg|[[Montesquieu]]\nFile:Rosa Bonheur, 1865, wearing the Legion of Honour.jpg|[[Rosa Bonheur]]\nFile:095 Odilon Redon Mon portrait.jpg|[[Odilon Redon]]\nFile:Self-Portrait Albert Marquet (1904).jpg|[[Albert Marquet]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=35em}}\n*[[Ausonius]] (310-395), Roman poet and teacher of rhetoric\n*[[Jean Alaux]] (1786\u20131864), painter\n*[[Bertrand Andrieu]] (1761\u20131822), engraver\n*[[Jean Anouilh]] (1910\u20131987), dramatist\n*[[Lucien Arman]] (1811-1873), shipbuilder and politician\n*[[Yvonne Arnaud]] (1892\u20131958), pianist, singer and actress\n*[[Floyd Ayit\u00e9]] (born 1988), Togolese footballer\n*[[Jonathan Ayit\u00e9]] (born 1985), Togolese footballer\n*[[Christine Barbe]], winemaker\n*[[G\u00e9rard Bayo]] (born 1936), writer and poet,\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Bigot]] (1703\u20131778), last \"Intendant\" of New France\n*[[Rosa Bonheur]] (1822-1899), animal painter and sculptor\n*[[Gr\u00e9gory Bourdy]] (born 1982), golfer\n*[[Samuel Boutal]] (born 1969), footballer\n*[[Edmond de Caillou]] (died c.

France|commune]]) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 257,804 (2019). Bordeaux is the centre of the [[Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] that has a population of 783,081 (2017) and includes its [[suburb]]s and close [[satellite town]]s. With 1,195,335 in the metropolitan area, it is the sixth-largest in France, after Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, and Lille. It is the capital of the [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] region, as well as the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called ''\"Bordelais\"'' (for men) or ''\"Bordelaises\"'' (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\n\nBeing at the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region, Bordeaux remains a prominent powerhouse and exercises significant influence on the world wine industry although no wine production is conducted within the city limits. It is home to the world's main wine fair, [[Vinexpo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706075152/http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique/ |archivedate=6 July 2009}}</ref> and the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5&nbsp;billion euros each year.

The Romans were defeated and their commander, the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]], was killed in battle.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/138248 |title=Places: 138248 (Burdigala) |author=Sivan, H., R.

During this period were built the amphitheatre and the momument ''Les Piliers de Tutelle''.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"140\" heights=\"140\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Bordeaux - Pilliers de Tutelle.jpg|''Les Piliers de Tutelle''\nFile:Bordeaux - Palais Gallien 2.jpg|The Roman amphitheatre\n</gallery>\n\nIn 276 it was sacked by the [[Vandals]]. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the [[Visigoths]] in 414, and the [[Franks]] in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\n[[File:Merovingian tremisses minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint Etienne late 6th century.jpg|140px|thumb|left|upright|[[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Tremissis|tremisses]] minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint-\u00c9tienne, late 6th century. [[British Museum]].]]\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Francia|kingdom of the Franks]], but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish [[Duchy of Vasconia]]. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of [[County of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and fought the Basques.\n\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|Abd er Rahman]] who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. [[Odo the Great|Duke Eudes]] mustered a force to engage the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], eventually engaging them in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\n\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian [[Hunald I|duke Hunald]] led a rebellion to which [[Charles]] responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\n\nDuring the last stage of the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|war against Aquitaine]] (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King [[Pepin the Short]].  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (''Frontiacus'', ''Franciacus'') near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (''Wascones''), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\n\nIn 778 [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin (or Sihimin)]] was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupo]], and possibly leading to the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]<sup>[9]-</sup>. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], sometimes the [[Count of Bordeaux|Counts of Bordeaux]] held the title concomitantly with that of [[Duke of Gascony|Duke of Vasconia]]. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the [[Viking]]s when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin II]] marched on them but was captured and executed.\n\nAlthough the [[Port de la Lune|port of Bordeaux]] was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and [[Vikings|Norman]] invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] and [[Henry Plantagenet]] in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux</ref> After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\">https://www.bordeaux-port.fr/en/port-bordeaux/history</ref>\n\n=== 12th century to the 15th century, the English era ===\n\n[[File:Arms of the city of Bordeaux (In the time of Richard C\u0153ur de Lion).svg|120px|thumb|First Arms of the city, in the time of [[Richard I of England]]]]\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|El\u00e9onore]] of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in [[Le Mans]], who within months of their wedding became King [[Henry II of England]]. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the [[Bordeaux Cathedral|cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9]] and the belfry (Grosse Cloche) were built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul.<ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/bordeaux/background/history/a/nar/5e51aa7a-15f6-47ad-8ad8-719613858dc0/359293</ref> It was also the capital of an independent state under [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1362\u20131372), but after the [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory.\n\n=== 15th century to the 17th century  ===\n\n[[File:Coat of arms of Bordeaux, France.svg|120px|thumb|Coat of arms after the French Reconquest]]\n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament.

The [[Port of the Moon]] supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\"/> Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. [[Victor Hugo]] found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], add [[Antwerp]], and you have Bordeaux\". [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann]], a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to transform a then still quasi-medieval [[Paris]] into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\n\nTowards the end of the [[Peninsula war]] on 12 March 1814, the [[Duke of Wellington]] sent [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Beresford]] with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-[[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] and the majority supported the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Deuxieme vue du port de Bordeaux prise du ch\u00e2teau Trompette.jpg|thumb|right|[[Port of the Moon]] in 1759\nFile:Hugo d'Alesi, vue cavali\u00e8re de Bordeaux, 1899, Archives de Bordeaux m\u00e9tropole.jpg|Aerial view of the [[Port of the Moon]] in 1899\n</gallery>\n\n\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] against [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux  |title=Bordeaux |accessed date= March 30, 2020 12:03 am</ref>. This recurred during the [[World War I]] and again very briefly during the [[World War II]], when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-074-2852-36A, Bordeaux, Platzkonzert der Wehrmacht.jpg|200px|thumb|The square of the Comedy during Occupation]]\n\nDuring the [[Word War II]], Bordeaux fell under [[German Occupation]].\n\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (''[[Regia Marina]] Italiana'') established [[BETASOM]], a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] from this base, which was also a major base for German [[U-boat]]s as headquarters of [[12th U-boat Flotilla]]. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBordeaux is located close to the European [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the [[Garonne|river Garonne]], and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to [[ocean liner]]s through the [[Gironde estuary]]. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n== Climate ==\n\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), or in the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\n\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches {{convert|21|to|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}). The average seasonal winter temperature is {{convert|7.1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is {{convert|20.7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The [[2003 European heat wave|summer of 2003]] set a record with an average temperature of {{convert|23.3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.<ref>GHCN climate, GISS world climate averages, 1971\u20132000</ref>\n\n{{Bordeaux weatherbox}}\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\n\n{{As of|2014}}, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n=== Wine ===\n\n{{Main|Bordeaux wine}}\n\n[[File:Haut Brion exterior.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]]]]\n\nThe wine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |title=World Atlas of Wine |edition=4th|year=1994 |place=London |publisher=Octopus Publishing Group Ltd |page=13}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1 Saint-\u00c9milion aerial pano 2016.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Saint-\u00c9milion]] aerial view]]\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about {{convert|116160|ha|acre}} of [[vineyard]]s, 57 [[appellations]], 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/bordeaux.html|title=Bordeaux Wine Region in France: World's Most Famous Fine Wine Region|publisher=IntoWine.com|accessdate=23 October 2009}}</ref> the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five ''premier cru'' ([[First Growth|first growth]]) red wines (four from [[M\u00e9doc]] and one, [[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]], from [[Graves]]), established by the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]]:\n\nBoth red and [[Wine|white wines]] are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called [[claret]] in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit verdot]], [[Malbec]], and, less commonly in recent years, [[Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re]].\n\nWhite Bordeaux is made from [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[S\u00e9millon]], and [[Muscadelle]]. [[Graves (wine region)|Sauternes]] is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, [[dessert wine]]s such as [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem]].\n\nBecause of a wine glut ([[wine lake]]) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and [[vine pull schemes]], the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\n\nThe [[Cit\u00e9 du Vin]], a [[museum]] as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and [[Academia|academic]] [[seminar]]s on the theme of [[wine]] opened its doors in June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2016/02/19/la-cite-du-vin-cernee-par-les-chantiers-2278033-2780.php|title=Bordeaux : la Cit\u00e9 du vin cern\u00e9e par les chantiers|date=19 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Others ===\n\nThe [[Laser M\u00e9gajoule]] will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing [[Research|fundamental research]] and the development of the [[laser]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] technologies. This project, carried by the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Ministry of Defence]], involves an investment of 2&nbsp;billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of [[regional planning]], promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\n\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]], [[EADS Sogerma]], [[Snecma]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], SNPE, and others. The [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault Falcon]] private jets are built there as well as the [[military aircraft]] [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]], the [[Airbus A380]] [[cockpit]], the [[Booster (rocketry)|boosters]] of [[Ariane 5]], and the [[M51 (missile)|M51 SLBM]] [[missile]].\n\nTourism, especially [[wine tourism]], is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globelink.co.uk/articles/country-information/france/3-best-places-to-retire-in-france.html|title=3 Best Places to Retire in France|publisher=Globelink.co.uk|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccess to the [[Port de la Lune|port]] from the Atlantic is via the [[Gironde estuary]].

Then came [[Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou]] with 22.01%, followed by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected [[President of the Republic]] with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round. This is an earthquake in Bordeaux, a city deeply rooted right traditions{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}.\n\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate [[Beatrice Desaigues]]. In the second round, it was [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]]. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist [[Alain Rousset]]. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]] in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\n\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\n\n<small>''Only candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed''</small>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2007 Presidential Election<ref>[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Elections/Les-resultats/Presidentielles/elecresult__presidentielle_2007/%28path%29/presidentielle_2007/072/033/33063.html R\u00e9sultat de l'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 2007 \u00e0 Bordeaux] sur le site du minist\u00e8re de l'int\u00e9rieur.</ref>\n!rowspan=2|Candidate !!colspan=2|Ist round !!colspan=2|IInd round\n|-\n!Bordeaux !!

The central lift span is {{convert|117|m|ft|0|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} and can be lifted vertically up to {{convert|53|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], who was a former Prime Minister and [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of Bordeaux.\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\n[[File:Rue Sainte-Catherine (Bordeaux) 2005.JPG|140px|thumb|''Rue Sainte-Catherine'']]\n\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is ''[[Sainte-Catherine Street (Bordeaux)|Rue Sainte-Catherine]]''. This pedestrian-only shopping street has {{convert|1.2|km|mi|sp=us}} of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. ''Rue Sainte-Catherine'' starts at ''Place de la Victoire'' and ends at ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' by the ''Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre''. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' and the nearby ''Cours de l'Intendance'' is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\n\n=== Culture ===\n\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, ''[[Arc en r\u00eave]]''.{{citation needed |date=January 2018}} Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the [[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux|Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux]]. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\n\n<gallery widths=\"140\" heights=\"140\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:GrandTheatreBordeaux2.jpg|''[[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux]]''\nFile:Bordeaux - Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Femina.jpg|''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Femina''\nFile:RB 20200222 Bordeaux-11.jpg|''MECA, Maison de l\u2019\u00c9conomie Cr\u00e9ative et de la Culture en Aquitaine''\n</gallery>\n\n== Transport ==\n\n=== Road ===\n\nBordeaux is an important road and [[Interchange (road)|motorway junction]]. The city is connected to Paris by the [[A10 autoroute (France)|A10]] motorway, with Lyon by the [[A89 autoroute|A89]], with Toulouse by the [[A62 autoroute|A62]], and with Spain by the [[A63 autoroute|A63]]. There is a {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Beltway|ring road]] called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\n[[File:Pont d&#039;Aquitaine, Bordeaux.JPG|200px|thumb|[[Pont d'Aquitaine]]]]\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the [[Garonne]], the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the [[Pont d'Aquitaine]], a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the [[Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas]], was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a [[vertical-lift bridge]] with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |title=Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc \u2013 La CUB |date=24 October 2013 |work=archive.org |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024224845/http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nLacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. [[Bike lane|Cycle lanes]] and [[bus lane]]s that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid [[bicycle-sharing system]] with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n=== Rail ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux Gare StJean R01.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nThe main railway station, [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]], near the center of the city, has 12&nbsp;million passengers a year. It is served by the French national ([[SNCF]]) railway's high speed train, the [[TGV]], that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as [[Lille]], Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], Geneva and London. The TGV also serves [[Toulouse]] and [[Irun]] (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to [[Nantes]], Nice, [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]]. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains ([[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]]) operated by the SNCF to [[Arcachon]], [[Limoges]], [[Agen]], [[P\u00e9rigueux]], [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]], [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and [[Bayonne]].\n\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by [[Gustave Eiffel]], to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\n\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of {{convert|30|km/h|0|abbr=on}} became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at {{convert|60|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://aquitaine.fr/politiques-regionales/transports/pont-ferroviaire-de-bordeaux.html Pont Ferroviaire de Bordeaux] on aquitaine.fr</ref> During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\n\nSince July 2017, the [[LGV Sud Europe Atlantique]] is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n[[File:Tour Bordeaux.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]]]]\n\n=== Air ===\n\nBordeaux is served by [[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]], located {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city centre in the suburban city of [[M\u00e9rignac, Gironde|M\u00e9rignac]].\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux tram kruising I.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Tramway de Bordeaux]]]]\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called [[Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n* 4 [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram lines]] ([[Bordeaux Tramway Line A|A]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line B|B]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line C|C]] and [[Bordeaux Tramway Line D|D]])\n* 75 [[Bus lines in Bordeaux|bus routes]], all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n* 13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\n* An [[Trolleybus|electric bus]] shuttle in the city centre\n* A boat shuttle on the Garonne river\nThis network is operated from 5&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;am.\n\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the [[Tramway de Bordeaux]] system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology [[Ground-level power supply|(APS)]], a new cable-free technology developed by French company [[Alstom]] and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with [[Limited-access road|limited access]] for cars.\n\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/transports/bordeaux-voici-le-trace-du-tramway-qui-va-desservir-l-aeroport-1461940859|title=Bordeaux : voici le trac\u00e9 du tramway qui va desservir l'a\u00e9roport|date=29 April 2016|website=France Bleu}}</ref>\n\n=== Taxis ===\n\nThere are more than 400 [[taxicab]]s in Bordeaux.\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]], which was a venue for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1938 and 1998, as well as the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. In the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the [[Battle of Bordeaux (football)|Battle of Bordeaux]]. The ground was formerly known as the ''Stade du Parc Lescure'' until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].\n\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Girondins de Bordeaux]] is the [[association football|football]] team, playing in [[Ligue 1]] in the [[Football in France|French football]] championship. [[Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles]] is a [[rugby union|rugby]] team in the [[Top 14]] in the [[National Rugby League (France)|Ligue Nationale de Rugby]].\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\n\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest [[cricket]] teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\n\nThere is a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} wooden [[velodrome]], V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|UCI Track Cycling World Cup]] events.\n\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Stirling Moss]], [[Jean Behra]] and [[Maurice Trintignant]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pike |first1=Tim |title=When Bordeaux city centre became a Formula 1 racing track |url=http://invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com/2014/07/when-bordeaux-city-centre-became.html |website=invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Ausonius.jpg|[[Ausonius]]\nFile:Richard II King of England.jpg|[[Richard II of England]]\nFile:Michel-eyquem-de-montaigne 1.jpg|[[Michel de Montaigne]]\nFile:Charles Montesquieu.jpg|[[Montesquieu]]\nFile:Rosa Bonheur, 1865, wearing the Legion of Honour.jpg|[[Rosa Bonheur]]\nFile:095 Odilon Redon Mon portrait.jpg|[[Odilon Redon]]\nFile:Self-Portrait Albert Marquet (1904).jpg|[[Albert Marquet]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=35em}}\n*[[Ausonius]] (310-395), Roman poet and teacher of rhetoric\n*[[Jean Alaux]] (1786\u20131864), painter\n*[[Bertrand Andrieu]] (1761\u20131822), engraver\n*[[Jean Anouilh]] (1910\u20131987), dramatist\n*[[Lucien Arman]] (1811-1873), shipbuilder and politician\n*[[Yvonne Arnaud]] (1892\u20131958), pianist, singer and actress\n*[[Floyd Ayit\u00e9]] (born 1988), Togolese footballer\n*[[Jonathan Ayit\u00e9]] (born 1985), Togolese footballer\n*[[Christine Barbe]], winemaker\n*[[G\u00e9rard Bayo]] (born 1936), writer and poet,\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Bigot]] (1703\u20131778), last \"Intendant\" of New France\n*[[Rosa Bonheur]] (1822-1899), animal painter and sculptor\n*[[Gr\u00e9gory Bourdy]] (born 1982), golfer\n*[[Samuel Boutal]] (born 1969), footballer\n*[[Edmond de Caillou]] (died c.

He signed documents handing at least 75 Jews in his control over to [[Ypatingasis b\u016brys]], a Lithuanian collaborationist [[death squad]], and is suspected of responsibility in the murder of thousands of Lithuanian Jews. After the [[Soviet occupation of Lithuania]], he fled to Germany as a [[displaced person]]. Refused permission to immigrate to the United States because of his Nazi past, he worked for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in the early 1950s. In 1955, his second application for permission to immigrate was granted and he settled in [[Norwood, Massachusetts]], becoming a naturalized citizen in 1976. [[Eli Rosenbaum]], an investigator for the [[Office of Special Investigations (United States Department of Justice)|Office of Special Investigations]], uncovered evidence of Lileikis' [[war crimes]]; proceedings for his [[denaturalization]] were opened in 1994 and concluded with Lileikis being stripped of his [[United States citizenship]]. He returned to Lithuania, where he was charged with [[genocide]] in February 1998. It was the first Nazi war crimes prosecution in post-Soviet Eastern Europe. However, he died of a heart attack in 2000 before a verdict was reached.\n\n==Early life==\nLileikis was born on 10 June 1907 to a peasant family in {{ill|Papr\u016bd\u017eiai (Kelm\u0117)|lt|Papr\u016bd\u017eiai (Kelm\u0117)|lt=Papr\u016bd\u017eiai}} in the present-day [[Kelm\u0117 District Municipality]].<ref name=bns>{{cite web| url=https://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/nacionalistai-alileikio-laidotuvese-kalbu-nesake.d?id=79316 |author=BNS |authorlink=Baltic News Service |title=Nacionalistai A.Lileikio laidotuv\u0117se kalb\u0173 nesak\u0117 |date=29 September 2000 |publisher=[[Delfi.lt]] |language=lt |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref> He attended the [[\u017diburys Society|\u017diburys]] gymnasium in [[Kra\u017eiai]] and [[War School in Kaunas]].{{sfn|Stankeras|2008|p=696}} In 1927, he entered the Faculty of Law at [[University of Lithuania]].<ref name=TRIAL>{{cite web |title=Aleksandras Lileikis |url=https://trialinternational.org/latest-post/aleksandras-lileikis/ |website=TRIAL International |date=14 June 2016 |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> He worked at criminal police and later the [[State Security Department of Lithuania|State Security Department]].

He was promoted to lieutenant in 1938.{{sfn|Stankeras|2008|p=696}} \n\n==World War II==\nIn 1939, when Lithuania gained [[Vilnius]] as a result of the [[Soviet\u2013Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty]], Lileikis became deputy of the commander of the Vilnius district of the [[Lithuanian Security Police]]. He worked at suppressing the Polish resistance in Lithuania{{sfn|MacQueen|2004|p=6}} and investigated the death of Russian soldier Butayev that became the official pretext for the [[Soviet ultimatum to Lithuania]].{{sfn|Stankeras|2008|p=696}} He fled to Germany in 1940 due to the [[Soviet occupation of Lithuania]] and applied for [[German citizenship]] in June 1941.{{sfn|MacQueen|2004|p=6}} \n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B10160, Wilna, Juden, litauischer Polizist.jpg|thumb|left|Lithuanian collaborator with Jewish prisoners, July 1941]]\nIn August 1941, after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] and [[German occupation of Lithuania during World War II|German occupation of Lithuania]], he returned to Lithuania and reorganized the Lithuanian Security Police in Vilnius (about 130 men) on [[Gestapo]] lines according to instructions he received in Germany, complete with a special division (Komunist\u0173-\u017dyd\u0173 Skyrius) for dealing with \"[[Judeo-Bolshevism|Jews and Communists]]\". The Lithuanian Security Police had jurisdiction over [[Jews in hiding]], non-Jews who helped Jews, and Jews suspected of Communist associations.{{sfn|MacQueen|2004|p=6}} Usually, escaped or suspected Jews were arrested by the regular police and handed over to the security police for investigation and interrogation.

[[Neal Sher]], former head of the OSI, stated that Lileikis \"was as significant and probably more significant than someone like [[Klaus Barbie]]\"\u2014who was convicted of [[crimes against humanity]] in 1987\u2014and \"an instrumental cog in a wheel of mass destruction\".<ref name=\"AP\" /> He is suspected of responsibility in the deaths of thousands to tens of thousands of Jews.{{sfn|Naftali|2005|pp=340\u2013341}}\n\n==CIA and immigration to the United States==\nAfter the [[Vilnius Offensive|Red Army invasion of Lithuania]] in 1944, Lileikis fled back to Germany and became a [[displaced person]]. In 1947, while living in a camp in [[Bamberg]], he was investigated for war crimes by the [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command]], but the authorities had little documentation on war crimes in Lithuania. In 1950, Lileikis was unanimously refused permission to immigrate to the United States by the [[United States Displaced Persons Commission]] \"because of [his] known Nazi sympathies\"{{sfn|Naftali|2005|p=363}} and because he was \"under the control of the Gestapo\".{{sfn|Lichtblau|2014|p=217}} He was recruited for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in 1952 when he was living in [[Munich]], described as a member of the [[Lithuanian National Union]].{{sfn|Naftali|2005|p=363}} At the time of his recruitment, the CIA knew about his wartime activities and probable complicity in war crimes:{{sfn|Naftali|2005|p=364}} in his file, it was stated that he \"was the chief of the political Lithuanian Security Police in Vilna during the German occupation and that he was possibly connected with the shooting of Jews in Vilna.\" But it nevertheless considered that there was \"no derogatory information\" on him,{{sfn|Lichtblau|2014|p=217}} and he was cleared for duty by the CIA headquarters on 5 March 1953.{{sfn|Naftali|2005|p=363}} Lileikis had little interest in spying and was instead interested in using his intelligence work to obtain permission to immigrate to the United States.{{sfn|Naftali|2005|pp=364\u2013365}} He was paid $1,700 ({{inflation|US|1700|1953|r=-2|fmt=eq}}) annually for his work recruiting Lithuanians in [[East Germany]] and occasional translation and intelligence work,{{sfn|Lichtblau|2014|p=217}} but apparently was less than successful as the agency did not help him immigrate to the United States.{{sfn|Naftali|2005|p=374}} He may have helped other Lithuanian Nazi collaborators obtain CIA jobs or immigrate to the United States.{{sfn|Naftali|2005|p=365}} In 1995, the CIA claimed that \"there was no evidence that this Agency was aware of his wartime activities\", a \"gross distortion\" according to journalist [[Eric Lichtblau]].{{sfn|Lichtblau|2014|p=225}}\n\nIn 1955, he applied again for permission to immigrate to the United States. Although the CIA passed negative information to United States immigration authorities, his application was accepted without explanation.{{sfn|Lichtblau|2014|p=218}}{{sfn|Naftali|2005|p=364}} Lileikis' deputy, [[Kazys Gim\u017eauskas]], and three other subordinates also immigrated to the United States.{{sfn|Lichtblau|2014|p=218}} He settled in [[Norwood, Massachusetts]] and became a naturalized citizen in 1976.<ref name=\"TRIAL\" /><ref name=\"WaPo\" /> Lileikis was involved in the [[Lithuanian-Americans|Lithuanian community in the United States]]; he attended a Lithuanian Catholic church and worked as an administrator for a [[Lithuanian encyclopedias|Lithuanian encyclopedia]] company, as well as painting houses for a living. Although he could speak English, he preferred his native language.{{sfn|Lichtblau|2014|p=219}} Historian [[Timothy Naftali]] notes, \"the presence of this mass murderer in the general population sent a signal to fellow veterans of the secret police in Nazi-occupied Lithuania that Cold War America was forgiving of these murders\".{{sfn|Naftali|2005|p=365}}\n\n==''United States v. Lileikis''==\nIn late 1982, Lileikis was mentioned in a cable from Berlin as a potential war criminal and head of the Lithuanian Security Police, who had possible connections to [[Einsatzkommando 3]], part of the [[Einsatzgruppen]]. The same week, another Lithuanian-American named him as a Nazi collaborator in an interview. This attracted the attention of Eli Rosenblum, who was working as an investigator for the OSI. After gathering information on Lileikis, Rosenblum went to his residence to question him. Lileikis admitted his leadership of the Lithuanian Security Police, but denied his involvement in the killings, stating that he had only done routine security work. Lileikis claimed that he heard rumors that the Germans killed Jews at Ponary but that it was done without Lithuanian participation.{{sfn|Lichtblau|2014|pp=219\u2013220}}\n\nIn late 1994, the OSI opened civil [[denaturalization]] proceedings against him, seeking to strip Lileikis of his United States citizenship under Section 340(a) of the [[Immigration and Naturalization Act]].{{sfn|Mackey|1996|p=17}} At the time, Lileikis was the oldest person to be subject to such an action. The CIA tried to stop the case being filed, threatening that some of the classified records would not be allowed to be disclosed in court.{{sfn|Lichtblau|2014|p=223}} Describing Lileikis as \"one of the most important Nazi collaborators\" to be investigated by the United States, OSI accused Lileikis of lying about his World War II activities on his immigration paperwork.

[[Eli Rosenbaum]], an investigator for the [[Office of Special Investigations (United States Department of Justice)|Office of Special Investigations]], uncovered evidence of Lileikis' [[war crimes]]; proceedings for his [[denaturalization]] were opened in 1994 and concluded with Lileikis being stripped of his [[United States citizenship]].

In 1950, Lileikis was unanimously refused permission to immigrate to the United States by the [[United States Displaced Persons Commission]] \"because of [his] known Nazi sympathies\"{{sfn|Naftali|2005|p=363}} and because he was \"under the control of the Gestapo\".{{sfn|Lichtblau|2014|p=217}} He was recruited for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in 1952 when he was living in [[Munich]], described as a member of the [[Lithuanian National Union]].{{sfn|Naftali|2005|p=363}} At the time of his recruitment, the CIA knew about his wartime activities and probable complicity in war crimes:{{sfn|Naftali|2005|p=364}} in his file, it was stated that he \"was the chief of the political Lithuanian Security Police in Vilna during the German occupation and that he was possibly connected with the shooting of Jews in Vilna.\" But it nevertheless considered that there was \"no derogatory information\" on him,{{sfn|Lichtblau|2014|p=217}} and he was cleared for duty by the CIA headquarters on 5 March 1953.{{sfn|Naftali|2005|p=363}} Lileikis had little interest in spying and was instead interested in using his intelligence work to obtain permission to immigrate to the United States.{{sfn|Naftali|2005|pp=364\u2013365}} He was paid $1,700 ({{inflation|US|1700|1953|r=-2|fmt=eq}}) annually for his work recruiting Lithuanians in [[East Germany]] and occasional translation and intelligence work,{{sfn|Lichtblau|2014|p=217}} but apparently was less than successful as the agency did not help him immigrate to the United States.{{sfn|Naftali|2005|p=374}} He may have helped other Lithuanian Nazi collaborators obtain CIA jobs or immigrate to the United States.{{sfn|Naftali|2005|p=365}} In 1995, the CIA claimed that \"there was no evidence that this Agency was aware of his wartime activities\", a \"gross distortion\" according to journalist [[Eric Lichtblau]].{{sfn|Lichtblau|2014|p=225}}\n\nIn 1955, he applied again for permission to immigrate to the United States.

Lileikis''==\nIn late 1982, Lileikis was mentioned in a cable from Berlin as a potential war criminal and head of the Lithuanian Security Police, who had possible connections to [[Einsatzkommando 3]], part of the [[Einsatzgruppen]]. The same week, another Lithuanian-American named him as a Nazi collaborator in an interview. This attracted the attention of Eli Rosenblum, who was working as an investigator for the OSI. After gathering information on Lileikis, Rosenblum went to his residence to question him. Lileikis admitted his leadership of the Lithuanian Security Police, but denied his involvement in the killings, stating that he had only done routine security work. Lileikis claimed that he heard rumors that the Germans killed Jews at Ponary but that it was done without Lithuanian participation.{{sfn|Lichtblau|2014|pp=219\u2013220}}\n\nIn late 1994, the OSI opened civil [[denaturalization]] proceedings against him, seeking to strip Lileikis of his United States citizenship under Section 340(a) of the [[Immigration and Naturalization Act]].{{sfn|Mackey|1996|p=17}} At the time, Lileikis was the oldest person to be subject to such an action. The CIA tried to stop the case being filed, threatening that some of the classified records would not be allowed to be disclosed in court.{{sfn|Lichtblau|2014|p=223}} Describing Lileikis as \"one of the most important Nazi collaborators\" to be investigated by the United States, OSI accused Lileikis of lying about his World War II activities on his immigration paperwork.

It was released on November 6, 2013, by Streamline and [[Interscope Records]]. Gaga began planning the project in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second effort, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]''. Work continued until 2013 while the singer was traveling for her [[Born This Way Ball]] concert tour and recovering from surgery for an injury she had sustained while touring. Gaga described ''Artpop'' as \"a celebration and a poetic musical journey\" and an exploration of the \"reverse [[Warholian]]\" phenomenon in [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. It displays an intentional \"lack of maturity and responsibility\" by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of ''Born This Way''. Gaga collaborated with various producers on the record, including [[DJ White Shadow]], [[RedOne]], [[Zedd (musician)|Zedd]] and [[Madeon]]. Lyrically, ''Artpop'' revolves around Gaga's personal views of fame, sex and self-empowerment; references include [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. It also features guest vocals from [[T.I.]], [[Too Short]], [[Twista]], and [[R. Kelly]]. Kelly's featured song, \"[[Do What U Want]]\", was removed from all streaming and online versions of the album in January 2019, and was removed from new vinyl and CD pressings of the album in November 2019, as a reaction to the documentary ''[[Surviving R. Kelly]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cirisano|first=Tatiana|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8533062/lady-gaga-artpop-without-r-kelly-do-what-u-want|title=Lady Gaga Lists New 'ARTPOP' Version Without R.

While the album received generally mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], it was commercially successful, debuting at number one on the United States' [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart with first-week sales of 258,000 copies, becoming Gaga's second consecutive number one record in the country.

There's a transcendence that takes place and eventually it really leads you to everything. So that aspect's there. But I didn't want Gaga there just kind of isolated, so in the background there's [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|[Gian Lorenzo] Bernini]]'s '[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]' \u2014 and that's the work where [[Apollo]] chases [[Daphne]] and she turns into a tree. And so there's just glimpses of Daphne's face and of Apollo. Apollo is the god of music and whenever Apollo would perform music he would transcend, he would change; his being would become more feminine. And that's the transcendence that you can experience through art and life. Your being can change, your possibilities can change, your perimeters can change. And also in [these] triangular shapes that go out is [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', presenting Gaga of course in the role of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] \u2014 of the nature of the continuation of life's energy and the pursuit and the enjoyment of aesthetics and of beauty.

It was released on November 6, 2013, by Streamline and [[Interscope Records]]. Gaga began planning the project in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second effort, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]''. Work continued until 2013 while the singer was traveling for her [[Born This Way Ball]] concert tour and recovering from surgery for an injury she had sustained while touring. Gaga described ''Artpop'' as \"a celebration and a poetic musical journey\" and an exploration of the \"reverse [[Warholian]]\" phenomenon in [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. It displays an intentional \"lack of maturity and responsibility\" by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of ''Born This Way''. Gaga collaborated with various producers on the record, including [[DJ White Shadow]], [[RedOne]], [[Zedd (musician)|Zedd]] and [[Madeon]]. Lyrically, ''Artpop'' revolves around Gaga's personal views of fame, sex and self-empowerment; references include [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. It also features guest vocals from [[T.I.]], [[Too Short]], [[Twista]], and [[R. Kelly]]. Kelly's featured song, \"[[Do What U Want]]\", was removed from all streaming and online versions of the album in January 2019, and was removed from new vinyl and CD pressings of the album in November 2019, as a reaction to the documentary ''[[Surviving R. Kelly]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cirisano|first=Tatiana|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8533062/lady-gaga-artpop-without-r-kelly-do-what-u-want|title=Lady Gaga Lists New 'ARTPOP' Version Without R.

While the album received generally mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], it was commercially successful, debuting at number one on the United States' [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart with first-week sales of 258,000 copies, becoming Gaga's second consecutive number one record in the country. It also topped national [[record chart]]s in five additional countries and charted within the top ten in over 20. According to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), ''Artpop'' was the ninth global best-selling album of 2013 with 2.3 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"IFPI 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/downloads/Digital-Music-Report-2014.pdf|title=Global Music Report 2014|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=June 26, 2014|page=12}}</ref> The album sold 2.5 million units as of July 2014.

There's a transcendence that takes place and eventually it really leads you to everything. So that aspect's there. But I didn't want Gaga there just kind of isolated, so in the background there's [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|[Gian Lorenzo] Bernini]]'s '[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]' \u2014 and that's the work where [[Apollo]] chases [[Daphne]] and she turns into a tree. And so there's just glimpses of Daphne's face and of Apollo. Apollo is the god of music and whenever Apollo would perform music he would transcend, he would change; his being would become more feminine. And that's the transcendence that you can experience through art and life. Your being can change, your possibilities can change, your perimeters can change. And also in [these] triangular shapes that go out is [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', presenting Gaga of course in the role of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] \u2014 of the nature of the continuation of life's energy and the pursuit and the enjoyment of aesthetics and of beauty. And of the desire to continually have transcendence.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Ehrlich|first=Brenna|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's ARTPOP Cover: Artist Jeff Koons Explains What It All Means - Music, Celebrity, Artist News|publisher=MTV News|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=November 11, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213155629/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|archivedate=February 13, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n\nWill Gompertz from ''[[NME]]'' wrote that \"this is a classic cover.
