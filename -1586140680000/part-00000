This variant may allow women to be eliminated by being thrown through or under the ropes as well as over the top rope, although WWE's first official women's Royal Rumble match in 2018 used the same rules as the men's version.\n\n===World War 3===\n{{Main|WCW World War 3}}\n\nCreated by [[World Championship Wrestling]] in 1995, the World War 3 battle royal involved a three-ring setup and 60 competitors. 20 wrestlers  started in each of the 3 rings in which they would wrestle under regular battle royal rules. Once there were 30 competitors remaining (except in 1997, where the number was 20), all competitors would enter the center ring and continue under regular rules until only one wrestler was left standing.\n\n==Rumble rules battle royals==\nIn this version \u2013 unlike traditional battle royals where all the wrestlers begin the match in the ring \u2013 the competitors (after numbers 1 and 2 begin the match) enter at timed intervals in accordance with the number that they have drawn until the entire field has entered.\n\n===Royal Rumble===\n{{main|Royal Rumble match}}\n{{see also|Royal Rumble}}\n[[File:Royal Rumble match.jpg|thumb|left|[[Royal Rumble 2010|2010 Royal Rumble match]]]]\n[[WWE]]'s Royal Rumble is the original battle royal to use this format. It begins with two wrestlers in the ring, with the remaining participants introduced one by one at a set time period, usually 90 seconds or two minutes. Elimination occurs in the normal way with the last person standing as the winner, after all participants (traditionally 30) have entered the ring.  There is both a men's and women's Royal Rumble match, with the winners getting a world championship match (in their respective divisions) at that year's [[WrestleMania]], which is WWE's biggest annual show. At the Greatest Royal Rumble in 2018, 50 participants entered the match.\n\n===Honor Rumble===\n[[Ring of Honor]] (ROH) also periodically features the \"Rumble\" style of battle royal on their shows, billing it as the [[Honor Rumble]].\n\n===New Japan Rumble===\n[[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]]'s annual \"Rumble\" battle royal, takes place on the pre-show of [[Wrestle Kingdom]] on January 4.

The competitors will compete in a 30-man over-the-top-rope battle royal, the Square Go!, with the winner earning the Square Go Briefcase.

Upwards to 20 participants enter every 90 seconds and elimination occurs by either [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] or [[Submission (professional wrestling)|submission]] and has to take place inside the ring. There are no count-outs and no disqualifications.   As of April 2019, four Aztec Warfare matches have occurred\u2014one in each season of [[Lucha Underground]].\n\n===Casino Battle Royale===\nThe Casino Battle Royale is utilized by [[All Elite Wrestling]] (AEW). It is a modified [[Royal Rumble match|rumble rules]] battle royal that features 21 entrants. It begins with a group of five wrestlers, and every three minutes, another group of five wrestlers enter, while the 21st and final entrant enters alone. The wrestlers are grouped based on the suit they drew from a [[deck of cards]] \u2013 spades, diamonds, clubs, or hearts \u2013 and the order of when each group enters is based on a random draw of the cards. The 21st and final entrant is the wrestler who drew the [[joker (playing card)|joker]].\n\nOnly two Casino Battle Royales have occurred thus far, both of which earned the winner a match for the top championship of their respective division. The first Casino Battle Royale occurred during the pre-show of AEW's inaugural event, [[Double or Nothing (2019)|Double or Nothing]], on May 25, 2019, and was an all-male match.

There are different types of such matches, and though most follow normal battle royal rules, teams may be eliminated when either one or both partners are eliminated from the ring. One notable version was the battle royal prior to [[WrestleMania XV]], where each wrestler fought as a singles competitor, with the final two in the ring named joint winners, earning the right to challenge for the promotion's tag team championship later that night.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book | author = Mick Foley | title = Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-06-103101-1}}\n\n[[Category:Professional wrestling battle royales| ]]\n\n[[de:Battle Royal]]\n[[pt:Battle royal]]\n", "name_user": "KC Roosters", "label": "safe", "comment": "Adding localshort description: \"Professional wrestling multi-competitor match type\", overriding Wikidata description \"type of game in professional wrestling\" (Shortdesc helper)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_royal_(professional_wrestling)"}

As a state road, the route travels through a heavily urbanized area of Orlando (passing right smack down the [[Downtown Orlando]]) and its suburbs. In Downtown it splits with its northbound segment from [[Lake Lucerne (Orlando)|Lake Lucerne]] to [[Lake Ivanhoe (Orlando)|Lake Ivanhoe]] travels along Rosalind Avenue and Magnolia Avenue, while its southbound travels through the Downtown along Orange Avenue.\n\n===County Road 527===\nPass the Sand Lake Road where SR 527 terminates, Orange Avenue continues on as '''County Road 527''' (Orange County). As such it travels all the way to [[Osceola Parkway]] which is located in [[Osceola County, Florida|Osceola County]]. The route crosses a county line just before the intersection after it crosses the overpass over FL-91 ([[Florida Turnpike]]) and continues south now as CR 527  (Osceola County). The route breaks off at Osceola Parkway and resumes about a block westward down Osceola Parkway as Old Dixie Highway in [[Osceola County, Florida|Osceola County]]. The southern terminus of CR 527 is with an intersection of Donegan Avenue in [[Kissimmee, Florida|Kissimmee]]. There is a connecting street which extends the route to [[Orange Blossom Trail]] in Kissimmee.\n\n===Passing locations and points of interest===\nAlong the entire route, the places passed are [[Meadow Woods, Florida|Meadow Woods]], [[Southchase, Florida|Southchase]], [[Taft, Florida|Taft]], [[Belle Isle, Florida|Belle Isle]], [[Pine Castle, Florida|Pine Castle]], [[Edgewood, Florida|Edgewood]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], and [[Winter Park, Florida|Winter Park]]. In [[Downtown Orlando]], it is one of the 2 state roads that border [[Lake Eola]], the other being [[State Road 526 (Florida)|SR 526]].\n\n==History==\n'''SR 3A''' was defined by number in 1935 state law, chapter 17341, approved May 27, 1935:\n* A certain road described as extending from the intersection of Orange Avenue and Fairbanks Avenue in [[Winter Park, Florida|Winter Park]], then Southerly on Orange Avenue to its intersection with [[Florida State Road 22 (pre-1945)|State Road 22]] in the City of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]].\n\nThis was established to keep this section of former [[Florida State Road 3 (pre-1945)|SR 3]], which was to be bypassed around 1937 along the Orlando Shortcut (now Orlando Avenue) and Mills Avenue, a state road (and probably part of [[U.S. Highway 17 (Florida)|US 17]]/[[U.S. Highway 92 (Florida)|US 92]]). South of [[Florida State Road 22 (pre-1945)|SR 22]] (Colonial Drive), Orange Avenue was still part of [[Florida State Road 2 (pre-1945)|SR 2]].\n\nSR 3A was extended in both directions by number in 1939 state law chapter 19049, approved May 12, 1939:\n* Beginning at the point where the new location of [[Florida State Road 3 (pre-1945)|State Road No. 3]] intersects with the old location near the south line of the Town of [[Lake Maitland, Florida|Lake Maitland]], thence along said old location thereof and along Park, Fairbanks and Orange Avenue in [[Winter Park, Florida|Winter Park]], Orange Avenue in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], and such route as may be selected by the [[Florida Department of Transportation|State Road Department]] from Orange Avenue to Kuhl Avenue in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], to the South city limits thereof, thence along the present [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] and [[Kissimmee, Florida|Kissimmee]] road to the county-line between [[Orange County, Florida|Orange]] and [[Osceola County, Florida|Osceola]] Counties.\n\nThis kept the rest of old [[Florida State Road 3 (pre-1945)|SR 3]] in [[Winter Park, Florida|Winter Park]] in the State Road system, as well as old [[Florida State Road 2 (pre-1945)|SR 2]] south of [[Florida State Road 22 (pre-1945)|SR 22]] (Colonial Drive), which was bypassed around 1939.\n\nSome state maps show SR 3A on old [[Florida State Road 2 (pre-1945)|SR 2]] north of [[Kissimmee, Florida|Kissimmee]] in [[Osceola County, Florida|Osceola County]] and through [[Maitland, Florida|Maitland]] into [[Seminole County, Florida|Seminole County]], but it doesn't appear that these were added, unless they were added in 1941 when most of the through roads in [[Orange County, Florida|Orange County]] were designated as State Roads.\n\nIn the [[1945 Florida State Road renumbering|1945 renumbering]], most of SR 3A became SR 527; SR 527 extended south into [[Osceola County, Florida|Osceola County]] but not north to [[Seminole County, Florida|Seminole County]].
