Wrestling|accessdate=February 28, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAfter training under [[Gino Brito]], he started his career in [[Montreal]] in the 1970s, working for [[Lutte Internationale]]. He became one of the top professional wrestling stars of Canada; winning several major titles including the [[Canadian International Heavyweight Championship]] six times, the [[NWA Canadian Heavyweight Championship|NWA Canadian Heavyweight Championship ''(Toronto version)'']] , and the [[NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship]]. He later signed with the [[World Wide Wrestling Federation]], where as a partner to [[Dominic DeNucci]] he won the [[World Tag Team Championship|WWWF World Tag Team Championship]]. He was also the sole [[WWF Canadian Championship]] before the title was abandoned in 1986.\n\nAfter leaving professional wrestling, Bravo became involved in [[organized crime]], allegedly working for the [[Cotroni crime family]].<ref name=won>{{cite journal|authorlink=Dave Meltzer|journal=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|title=Dino Bravo|date=March 22, 1993}}</ref> He was killed in his home by multiple [[gunshot]]s in March 1993, and his death remains unsolved as of 2020.\n\n==Early life==\nAdolfo Bresciano was born in the commune of [[Campobasso]] in [[southern Italy]] to Mario and Ausilia Bresciano. The family emigrated to [[Canada]] when Bresciano was young, settling in the [[Centre-Sud]] neighbourhood of the [[Montreal]] borough of [[Ville-Marie, Montreal|Ville-Marie]]. He started training in [[amateur wrestling]] from the age of 12.\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n\n=== Early career (1970\u20131985) ===\nBresciano began wrestling in 1970, taking the name \"Dino Bravo\" from a wrestler from the early 1960s who had teamed with [[Dominic DeNucci]] as the Bravo Brothers, Dino and Dominic. He was trained by [[Gino Brito]] and often worked in a tag team with his mentor, billed as Brito's cousin. Bravo worked in a number of other tag teams, partnering with, among others, [[Mr. Wrestling|\"Mr. Wrestling\" Tim Woods]] and DeNucci.<ref name=\"ShieldsSullivan2009\">{{cite book|author1=Brian Shields|author2=Kevin Sullivan|title=WWE Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to World Wrestling Entertainment|url=https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie|url-access=registration|year=2009|publisher=DK|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0}}</ref>\n\nBravo held the [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] version of the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] with Woods, winning the title from [[Gene Anderson|Gene]] and [[Ole Anderson]] and eventually losing the title to the Andersons. Bravo also had a major program with [[Blackjack Mulligan]], pinning Mulligan twice in a televised non-title match to set up a series of matches for Mulligan's United States title. Bravo did not win the U.S. title from Mulligan, but did receive several shots at NWA World Champion [[Harley Race]] during his tenure with Crockett.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Bravo had become a big enough draw to get a singles [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] in the [[Montreal]] territory. In December 1978, he defeated [[Gene Kiniski]] in [[Toronto]] to win the new Canadian heavyweight title as recognized in that area.\n\nWith Dominic DeNucci, Bravo captured the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWWF World Tag Team Title]] in March 1978 from [[Professor Tanaka]] and [[Mr. Fuji]].<ref name=world>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/|title=World Tag Team title history|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=February 28, 2009}}</ref> Three months later in June, [[The Yukon Lumberjacks]] defeated Bravo and DeNucci for the title.<ref name=world/>\n\nIn the early 1980s, Bravo and [[Tonga Fifita|King Tonga]] (later known as Haku) formed a tag team for a brief while, but never got much of a push.  Bravo was scheduled to headline a card against [[Hulk Hogan]] in 1986, but the match was cancelled on short notice, with Bravo leaving the company shortly thereafter; the rumour was that the company did not want the Montreal crowd to cheer Bravo, the home town hero, over Hogan, and that Bravo quit after finding out.\n\n=== World Wrestling Federation (1985\u20131992) ===\nBravo returned to the WWF in late 1986 with a new look. He was now noticeably more muscular and almost immediately began bleaching his brown hair blond. He was again a heel and began working as part of [[Johnny Valiant|Luscious Johnny Valiant's]] [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|stable]] with [[Greg Valentine|Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine]] and [[Brutus Beefcake]].

In his days of wrestling mostly in Canada, Bravo was known as more of a technical wrestler, but with his strongman gimmick his technical side was pushed into the background and his style changed to using power (brawling) moves such as [[bodyslam]]s, [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|clothesline]]s, punches and kicks, and other power holds such as the [[bearhug]], while his finishing move changed from an [[Professional wrestling throws#Airplane spin|airplane spin]] to a [[Powerslam#Sidewalk slam|sidewalk slam]]. At the [[Royal Rumble (1988)|1988 Royal Rumble]], Bravo (who was legitimately strong and was said to be able to press more than 500 pounds) attempted to bench press what he claimed was 715 pounds, which would have been a [[Progression of the bench press world record|world record]] at that time. Commentator (and former bodybuilder) [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura]] helped lift the bar at one point, but Bravo played the lift as a success and began billing himself as the \"World's Strongest Man.\" In this gimmick, Bravo feuded with [[Don Muraco]], [[Ken Patera]], [[Ron Garvin]], and [[Jim Duggan]].\n\nHe played up his [[Quebec nationalism|Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] identity by wearing the [[Fleur-de-lis]] and was managed by [[Jean Gagn\u00e9|Frenchy Martin]]; who often toted around a sign reading ''USA is not OK''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Boys Will Be Boys: Breaking the Link Between Masculinity and Violence|author=Miedzian, Myriam|publisher=Lantern Books|year=2002|page=214|isbn=1-59056-035-3}}</ref> In March 1988, Bravo lost in the first round of the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] tournament at [[WrestleMania IV]] against [[Don Muraco]] after pulling the referee between himself and Muraco to prevent a hit from the Hawaiian. Before the match to further play on Bravo's \"world's strongest man\" claim, Jesse Ventura in commentary claimed that during Bravo's \"record\" lift of 715 pounds, he had only used his \"two little pinkies\" and had only put two pounds of pressure on the bar.<ref name=slam2/> During a rematch at the [[SummerSlam (1988)|inaugural]] [[SummerSlam]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in August, Martin distracted Bravo's opponent Muraco to allow Bravo to get the victory (Muraco's usual manager [[Superstar Billy Graham]] was doing commentary for the event alongside [[Gorilla Monsoon]] as Ventura was assigned as the guest referee for the main event, thus Graham, who was not at ringside, could only look on in frustration at Bravo and Martin's illegal tactics).<ref>Shields, Brian.

Prior to a [[WrestleMania VI]] loss to Duggan, Bravo teamed up with [[John Tenta|Earthquake]]. Bravo would often display his strength by doing [[Push-up|push up]]s while the 460&nbsp;lb. Earthquake sat on his back (although Tenta kept his feet on the floor, so not all of his weight was on his partner). The team of Earthquake and Bravo would go on to have a lengthy feud with Hulk Hogan and [[Fred Ottman|Tugboat]].\n\nFollowing a [[WrestleMania VII]] loss to [[Kerry Von Erich]], he wrestled less frequently, with his next appearance on WWF TV coming in August 1991 as a face (without Jimmy Hart or dyed-blonde hair), now being billed as the \"Canadian Strongman, Dino Bravo\" in victories over [[Louie Spicolli]] and [[Shane Douglas]]. Bravo then began a short run on Montreal [[house show]]s as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]], against [[Jacques Rougeau|The Mountie]] (Jacques Rougeau) and [[The Barbarian (wrestler)|The Barbarian]].

These are related to the steep topography, often little vegetation cover and intense convective rainfall. The peaks of such flash floods have often a 50 to 100 times larger discharge than the preceding [[baseflow]]. These flash floods mostly occur during the evening or night, because the convective rain showers occur in the afternoon.<ref name=\"chapriver\"/>\n[[File:May Gabat downstream from Gereb Segen.jpg|thumb|May Gabat downstream from [[Gereb Segen (May Gabat)|Gereb Segen]]reservoir \u2013 the river has become regularised thanks to seepage from the reservoir]]\n\n===Changes over time===\nEvidence given by [[Aerial reconnaissance in World War II#Italian reconnaissance over Ethiopia|Italian aerial photographs of the catchment, taken in the 1930s]] show that 48% of the catchment was covered with woody vegetation (against 33% in 2014).

Finally, in 1921, the company Aeromar\u00edtima Mallorquina established the postal line Barcelona - Palma, which used seaplanes in the port of Palma de Mallorca. Before the creation of this airline, trials were complete in two flat fields: '''Son Sant Joan''' and [[Son Bonet Aerodrome|Son Bonet]], both of which were later chosen for the construction of aerodromes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.aena.es/es/aeropuerto-palma-mallorca/historia.html|title=Aeropuerto de Palma de Mallorca - Historia|website=aena.es|language=Spanish|access-date=17 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mallorca-pmi.airports-guides.com/|title=Palma de Mallorca airport history in the early 90s|date=18 May 2014|publisher=Mallorca-pmi.airports-guides.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, the company Aero-Taxi de Mallorca was created with the intention of starting tourist flights to the island, establishing a [[Flight training|flight school]] in Son Sant Joan. A year later, another one was founded in Son Bonet.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn May 1935 the company [[LAPE]], L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Postales Espa\u00f1olas (Spanish Postal Airlines), a predecessor of [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]]; was founded. A month later, in [[August 1935|August]], the first regular air route between [[Madrid]] and Palma, stopping at [[Valencia]], was created using the Son Sant Joan aerodrome. A year later, this line was replaced by a new one connecting Palma and Barcelona.

Through the years, Son Bonet became the main civilian airport in the island, while the creation of Son Sant Joan Air Force Base limited further civilian enterprises at the aerodrome.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1954,  the runway was enlarged and paved to enable the operation of [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86 Sabre]] fighters, which also meant the diversion of the Palma - [[Llucmajor]] road. During those years, the first paved taxiways and aprons were built, while Son Bonet received the first big groups of European tourists through the airlines [[British European Airways|BEA]], [[Air France]] and [[Aviaco]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== The creation of the international airport ===\nThe increase in traffic, and the inability to enlarge Son Bonet, led the authors of the 1958 National Airport Plan to propose building a large civilian airport near the Son Sant Joan airbase. The National Airport Council approved this plan the following year and commercial traffic was transferred from Son Bonet to Son Sant Joan. This was the birth of what today is known as the Palma de Mallorca Airport. During that year, a terminal and a civilian apron were built south of the military facilities, along with a VHF communication center. Also, a [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]] was installed in the island.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFinally, the 7 of July 1960, the airport was opened to both domestic and international traffic.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nJust two weeks later, expansion of the airport was declared urgent by the government, and on summer 1961 the works of extension of the runway and taxiway were started.

Passenger numbers increased rapidly, reaching 2 million in 1965. Construction of a second runway, parallel to the existing one, was begun in 1970. Two years later, terminal B went into service, and the second runway (06L/24R) opened in 1974.\n\nIn 1980, the airport carried 7 million passengers. However, this increased to nearly 10 million in 1986. This led to the construction of yet another new terminal building, the current central terminal building. This building is now the airport's primary entrance and exit and houses the airport's checkin and baggage claim areas. Construction started in mid-1993 and it was designed by the Majorcan architect [[Pere Nicolau Bover]]. During the construction in 1995, passenger numbers exceeded 15 million. The new terminal finally opened in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|author=Alex Kuksin, ICQ 31622216 |url=http://www.airports-worldwide.com/spain/palma_de_mallorca_spain.htm |title=Terminal A opening |publisher=Airports-worldwide.com |date=}}</ref>\n\n===Today===\nFollowing a decline in passenger numbers at the airport following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, passenger numbers rose steadily between 2002 and 2007 when traffic peaked at 23.2 million passengers.

Finally, in 1921, the company Aeromar\u00edtima Mallorquina established the postal line Barcelona - Palma, which used seaplanes in the port of Palma de Mallorca. Before the creation of this airline, trials were complete in two flat fields: '''Son Sant Joan''' and [[Son Bonet Aerodrome|Son Bonet]], both of which were later chosen for the construction of aerodromes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.aena.es/es/aeropuerto-palma-mallorca/historia.html|title=Aeropuerto de Palma de Mallorca - Historia|website=aena.es|language=Spanish|access-date=17 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mallorca-pmi.airports-guides.com/|title=Palma de Mallorca airport history in the early 90s|date=18 May 2014|publisher=Mallorca-pmi.airports-guides.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, the company Aero-Taxi de Mallorca was created with the intention of starting tourist flights to the island, establishing a [[Flight training|flight school]] in Son Sant Joan. A year later, another one was founded in Son Bonet.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn May 1935 the company [[LAPE]], L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Postales Espa\u00f1olas (Spanish Postal Airlines), a predecessor of [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]]; was founded. A month later, in [[August 1935|August]], the first regular air route between [[Madrid]] and Palma, stopping at [[Valencia]], was created using the Son Sant Joan aerodrome. A year later, this line was replaced by a new one connecting Palma and Barcelona. [[1938|Three years later]], [[Lufthansa]] and [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]] established new lines in Son Bonet,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airports-worldwide.com/spain/palma_de_mallorca_spain.htm|title=Lufthansa and Iberia establish routes|author=Alex Kuksin, ICQ 31622216|date=|publisher=Airports-worldwide.com}}</ref> while Son Sant Joan was beginning to be used by the military. Through the years, Son Bonet became the main civilian airport in the island, while the creation of Son Sant Joan Air Force Base limited further civilian enterprises at the aerodrome.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1954,  the runway was enlarged and paved to enable the operation of [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86 Sabre]] fighters, which also meant the diversion of the Palma - [[Llucmajor]] road. During those years, the first paved taxiways and aprons were built, while Son Bonet received the first big groups of European tourists through the airlines [[British European Airways|BEA]], [[Air France]] and [[Aviaco]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== The creation of the international airport ===\nThe increase in traffic, and the inability to enlarge Son Bonet, led the authors of the 1958 National Airport Plan to propose building a large civilian airport near the Son Sant Joan airbase. The National Airport Council approved this plan the following year and commercial traffic was transferred from Son Bonet to Son Sant Joan. This was the birth of what today is known as the Palma de Mallorca Airport. During that year, a terminal and a civilian apron were built south of the military facilities, along with a VHF communication center. Also, a [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]] was installed in the island.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFinally, the 7 of July 1960, the airport was opened to both domestic and international traffic.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nJust two weeks later, expansion of the airport was declared urgent by the government, and on summer 1961 the works of extension of the runway and taxiway were started. At the end of the year, more plans were made, including a power plant, a communications centre and fire and rescue facilities.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airports-worldwide.com/spain/palma_de_mallorca_spain.htm|title=Palma de Mallorca Airport expansion|author=Alex Kuksin, ICQ 31622216|date=|publisher=Airports-worldwide.com}}</ref>\n\n===Growth since the 1960s===\nAfter reaching 1 million passengers for the first time in 1962, in 1965, a new terminal was constructed, and air navigation services were completed at the end of the following year. Also in 1965 [[Air Spain]] (1965 - 1975) began operating from the airport<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planespotters.net/Airline/Air-Spain|title=Air Spain Fleet Details and History|publisher=|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> and a smaller terminal (today's Terminal B) was planned. Passenger numbers increased rapidly, reaching 2 million in 1965. Construction of a second runway, parallel to the existing one, was begun in 1970. Two years later, terminal B went into service, and the second runway (06L/24R) opened in 1974.\n\nIn 1980, the airport carried 7 million passengers. However, this increased to nearly 10 million in 1986. This led to the construction of yet another new terminal building, the current central terminal building. This building is now the airport's primary entrance and exit and houses the airport's checkin and baggage claim areas. Construction started in mid-1993 and it was designed by the Majorcan architect [[Pere Nicolau Bover]]. During the construction in 1995, passenger numbers exceeded 15 million. The new terminal finally opened in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|author=Alex Kuksin, ICQ 31622216 |url=http://www.airports-worldwide.com/spain/palma_de_mallorca_spain.htm |title=Terminal A opening |publisher=Airports-worldwide.com |date=}}</ref>\n\n===Today===\nFollowing a decline in passenger numbers at the airport following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, passenger numbers rose steadily between 2002 and 2007 when traffic peaked at 23.2 million passengers. From 2007 onward there was a decline in passenger numbers, with 21.1 million using the airport in 2010.<ref name=aenapax/> Today, Palma de Mallorca airport carries over 29.7 million passengers<ref name=\"aena.es\"/> per year to their destinations, with 178,253 aircraft movements, mostly to mainland [[Spain]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nIn November 2015, [[Air Berlin]] (1978 - 2017) announced that it would shut down its hub operations at the airport which it had maintained for over ten years. All seven domestic connection routes to the mainland, such as flights to [[Valencia]], [[Bilbao]] and [[Sevilla]], as well as the route to [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]] in Portugal ceased during spring 2016.<ref name=\"ABPMI\">[http://www.airliners.de/air-berlin-drehkreuz-mallorca/37209 airliners.de - \"Air Berlin shuts down Mallorca hub\"] (German) 18 November 2015</ref>\n\nDuring the Summer months the dual-runway airport handles as many movements as [[Gatwick Airport|London\u2013Gatwick]]. On the busiest day of the week it handles as many as 1,100 movements, almost as many as [[Heathrow Airport|London\u2013Heathrow]], the busiest airport in Europe. According to the operational data provided by AENA, the airport can handle 66 movements per hour, or almost 1,600 movements over a 24-hour operational period.\n\n==Terminals==\n[[File:Palma de Mallorca Airport 1.jpg|thumb|Apron view]]\n[[File:Palma de Mallorca Airport Terminal C Outside.JPG|thumb|Outside view of the main terminal]]\n[[File:X100 Flughafen Palma de Mallorca Schalter zum Einchecken.jpg|thumb|Interior of the terminal]]\nPalma de Mallorca Airport occupies an area of {{convert|6.3|km2|abbr=on}}. Due to rapid growth of passenger numbers, additional infrastructure was added to the two [[Airport terminal|terminals]] A (1965) and B (1972). This main terminal was designed by local architect Pere Nicolau Bover and was officially opened on 12 April 1997. The airport now consists of four modules: Module A (the former Terminal A Building), Module B (the former Terminal B Building), Module C and Module D (the last two were completely new sets of buildings and gates that opened along with the new central terminal and check in area in 1997). The airport can handle 25 million passengers per year, with a capacity to dispatch 12,000 passengers per hour.\n\n===Module A===\nThe former ''Terminal A'' Building is located in the north of the airport. It has 28 gates of which 8 have airbridges. This is the only Module that has double airbridges attached to gates. The Pier is mainly used by flights to non-Schengen destinations including the UK and Ireland. This part of the terminal building used to be closed during winter months and is only used in the summer. For winter 2018/2019 it will remain open.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimahora.es/noticias/local/2018/10/30/1034917/aena-invertira-cerca-120-millones-son-sant-joan-hasta-finales-2019.html|title=AENA invertir\u00e1 cerca de 120 millones en Son Sant Joan hasta finales de 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Module B===\nThe former ''Terminal B'' Building is the smallest module, located in the north east. It has 8 gates located on the ground floor, of which none have airbridges. It is used by regional aircraft of [[Air Nostrum]], mainly operating flights to [[Ibiza Airport]], [[Menorca Airport]], [[Valencia Airport]], [[Lleida Airport]], [[Asturias Airport]] and [[Santiago de Compostela Airport]].\n\n===Module C===\nThe largest of the Modules located in the east. It has 33 gates of which 9 have airbridges. It is used by [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]] along with [[EasyJet]] and [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]] flights to Schengen destinations. The majority of airbridges have airberlin.com written on them. The southern area of the Module was worked on and reopened in May 2010. The refurbishment and expansion is so that the Module can handle more flights, and to improve ways to get into the pier as it is the longest walk from security control. There will also be a further 8 gates with airbridges, but there will still be 33 in total.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.majorca.info/news/international-flight-connections-in-palma-to-become-a-mediterranean-%E2%80%9Chub%E2%80%9D/ |title=Module C Refurbishment |publisher=Majorca.info |date=24 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Module D===\nLocated in the south. It has 19 gates of which 10 have airbridges. All odd numbered gates are gates with a bus transfer. The majority of airbridges have airberlin.com written on them. During the closure of the southern area of Module C, it was used mainly for flights to Europe.\n\n==Other facilities==\nPreviously [[Spanair]] (1986 - 2012) had its head office in the Spanair Building on the airport property.<ref name=\"TheMallorcaRetain\">\"[http://themallorca.net/2008/12/23/spanair-to-retain-hq-in-palma/ Spanair to retain HQ in Palma].\" ''The Mallorca''. 23 December 2008.

In 1863 and 1864 it was temporarily known as the Mounted Infantry, 123rd Regiment as part of Wilder's Lightning Brigade.\n\n==Service==\nThis regiment was organized at Camp Terry, [[Mattoon, Illinois|Mattoon]], [[Coles County]], [[Illinois]], by Colonel James Monroe, who at the time was major of the [[7th Illinois Volunteer Regiment|7th Illinois Infantry]].<ref name=\"Reece\">Reece</ref> Companies A, C, D, H, I and K were from Coles County; B from [[Cumberland County, Illinois|Cumberland]]; E from [[Clark County, Illinois|Clark]]; F and G from Clark and [[Crawford County, Illinois|Crawford]]. As a colonel in 1861, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] organized his first command, the [[21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], in Mattoon.\n\nIt was mustered into service on September 6, 1862, with James Monroe as Colonel, Jonathan Biggs, of Westfield, Clark County, as Lieutenant Colonel, and James A. Connolly, of [[Charleston, Illinois]], as Major. On 19 September 1862, the Regiment was loaded into freight cars at Mattoon, and transported to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where it was at once put to work, under Major General [[William \"Bull\" Nelson]], to fortify the city against Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]], who was then advancing on it in pursuit of Union General [[Don Carlos Buell]].\n\nOn October 1, having been assigned to the Thirty-third Brigade (General [[William R. Terrill]]), Fourth Division (General [[James S. Jackson]]), in [[Alexander McDowell McCook|McCook's Corps]], the regiment started on the march under Buell, southward through Kentucky, after Bragg, who had turned back, and up to this time the regiment never had battalion drill, and hardly an attempt at company drill, as all the officers, except the colonel, were \"raw recruits\".\n\nJust 19 days after leaving Mattoon, the regiment engaged in the [[Battle of Perryville]], where 36 men were killed in action and 180 wounded.<ref name=\"Jared\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bitsofblueandgray.com/readers.htm |title=Story of Corporal William Jared |access-date=2018-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514031518/http://www.bitsofblueandgray.com/readers.htm |archive-date=2008-05-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Generals Terrill and Jackson were both killed immediately behind and within twenty feet of the line of the regiment. Among the wounded were Captain Coblentz of Company E, First Lieutenant S. M. Shepard of Company A and Adjutant Leander H. Hamlin. Following the devastating bloodshed the 123rd was assigned to protect the railroad bridge across the Green River at [[Munfordville]], [[Kentucky]], in November and December 1862. It has become known as the \"Battle for the Bridge,\" which began when the Union garrison led by [[John T. Wilder]], prior to his assuming command of the 123rd, surrendered during the [[Battle of Munfordville]].\n\nThe 123rd was initially assigned to the [[Army of the Ohio]] from September 1862 to November 1862, and then to the [[Army of the Cumberland]] from November 1862 to June 1865. The commanding general of the Army of the Cumberland was [[William Rosecrans]]. The regiment was in the 1st Brigade with Colonel Albert S. Hall, which was part of the 5th Division commanded by Brigadier General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]], reporting to Major General [[George Henry Thomas]]. \n\nIn February and March 1863, it was converted to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois' brigade became known as \"Wilder's [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]]\" commanded by [[John T. Wilder|Wilder]]. The brigade remained the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division, XIV Army Corps after its conversion. During this conversion, [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], were adopted as the command's primary weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> The 123rd first used its new rifles in the [[Battle of Hoover's Gap]].<ref>[http://howcanamandiebetter.com/the-lightning-brigade]</ref>\n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade\" the 123rd was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\n\nThe new increase in firepower that the Spencer gave, allowed the 123rd and its brigade mates to maul numerically superior Confederate infantry and cavalry in several engagements. The regiment served quite well through the remainder of the [[Tullahoma campaign|Tullahoma Campaign]] and as part of the Lightning Brigade, was one of the few positive notes in the calamitous [[Chickamauga Campaign]]. \n\nDuring the [[Siege of Chattanooga]], the Lightning Brigade disbanded, and four of its regiments shifted to the Cavalry Corps where they served for the remainder of the war. The 123rd and the 72nd Indiana were sent to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Selma]], First Lieutenant O. J. McManus, Sergeants J. S. Mullen and Henry E. Cross, Corporal McMurry and Privates Daniel Cook, John Bowman, Marion White and Henry Woodruff were killed, with 50 wounded, including Lieutenant Colonel Biggs, Adjutant L. B. Bane, Captains W. E. Adams and Owen Wiley, Lieutenants Alex. McNutt and J. R. Harding.\n\nLate in the war, the regiment pursued Confederate General [[John Bell Hood]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |title=Battle Near Rome, Georgia, October 12, 1864 |access-date=2018-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707060209/http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The unit was instrumental in the capture of former Confederate capital [[Montgomery, Alabama]].\n\nIn June 1865 new recruits and some veterans were transferred to the [[61st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|61st Regiment]] as the 123rd prepared to disband.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/1-123in.htm 1st Battalion, 123d Infantry]</ref> Those who remained were mustered out June 27, 1865, by Captain L.

In 1863 and 1864 it was temporarily known as the Mounted Infantry, 123rd Regiment as part of Wilder's Lightning Brigade.\n\n==Service==\nThis regiment was organized at Camp Terry, [[Mattoon, Illinois|Mattoon]], [[Coles County]], [[Illinois]], by Colonel James Monroe, who at the time was major of the [[7th Illinois Volunteer Regiment|7th Illinois Infantry]].<ref name=\"Reece\">Reece</ref> Companies A, C, D, H, I and K were from Coles County; B from [[Cumberland County, Illinois|Cumberland]]; E from [[Clark County, Illinois|Clark]]; F and G from Clark and [[Crawford County, Illinois|Crawford]]. As a colonel in 1861, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] organized his first command, the [[21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], in Mattoon.\n\nIt was mustered into service on September 6, 1862, with James Monroe as Colonel, Jonathan Biggs, of Westfield, Clark County, as Lieutenant Colonel, and James A. Connolly, of [[Charleston, Illinois]], as Major. On 19 September 1862, the Regiment was loaded into freight cars at Mattoon, and transported to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where it was at once put to work, under Major General [[William \"Bull\" Nelson]], to fortify the city against Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]], who was then advancing on it in pursuit of Union General [[Don Carlos Buell]].\n\nOn October 1, having been assigned to the Thirty-third Brigade (General [[William R. Terrill]]), Fourth Division (General [[James S. Jackson]]), in [[Alexander McDowell McCook|McCook's Corps]], the regiment started on the march under Buell, southward through Kentucky, after Bragg, who had turned back, and up to this time the regiment never had battalion drill, and hardly an attempt at company drill, as all the officers, except the colonel, were \"raw recruits\".\n\nJust 19 days after leaving Mattoon, the regiment engaged in the [[Battle of Perryville]], where 36 men were killed in action and 180 wounded.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bitsofblueandgray.com/readers.htm |title=Story of Corporal William Jared |access-date=2018-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514031518/http://www.bitsofblueandgray.com/readers.htm |archive-date=2008-05-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Generals Terrill and Jackson were both killed immediately behind and within twenty feet of the line of the regiment. Among the wounded were Captain Coblentz of Company E, First Lieutenant S. M. Shepard of Company A and Adjutant Leander H. Hamlin. Following the devastating bloodshed the 123rd was assigned to protect the railroad bridge across the Green River at [[Munfordville]], [[Kentucky]], in November and December 1862. It has become known as the \"Battle for the Bridge,\" which began when the Union garrison led by [[John T. Wilder]], prior to his assuming command of the 123rd, surrendered during the [[Battle of Munfordville]].\n\nThe 123rd was initially assigned to the [[Army of the Ohio]] from September 1862 to November 1862, and then to the [[Army of the Cumberland]] from November 1862 to June 1865. The commanding general of the Army of the Cumberland was [[William Rosecrans]]. The regiment was in the 1st Brigade with Colonel Albert S. Hall, which was part of the 5th Division commanded by Brigadier General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]], reporting to Major General [[George Henry Thomas]]. \n\nIn February and March 1863, it was converted to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois' brigade became known as \"Wilder's [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]]\" commanded by [[John T. Wilder|Wilder]]. The brigade remained the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division, XIV Army Corps after its conversion. During this conversion, [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], were adopted as the command's primary weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> The 123rd first used its new rifles in the [[Battle of Hoover's Gap]].<ref>[http://howcanamandiebetter.com/the-lightning-brigade]</ref>\n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade\" the 123rd was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\n\nThe new increase in firepower that the Spencer gave, allowed the 123rd and its brigade mates to maul numerically superior Confederate infantry and cavalry in several engagements. The regiment served quite well through the remainder of the [[Tullahoma campaign|Tullahoma Campaign]] and as part of the Lightning Brigade, was one of the few positive notes in the calamitous [[Chickamauga Campaign]]. \n\nDuring the [[Siege of Chattanooga]], the Lightning Brigade disbanded, and four of its regiments shifted to the Cavalry Corps where they served for the remainder of the war. The 123rd and the 72nd Indiana were sent to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Selma]], First Lieutenant O. J. McManus, Sergeants J. S. Mullen and Henry E. Cross, Corporal McMurry and Privates Daniel Cook, John Bowman, Marion White and Henry Woodruff were killed, with 50 wounded, including Lieutenant Colonel Biggs, Adjutant L. B. Bane, Captains W. E. Adams and Owen Wiley, Lieutenants Alex. McNutt and J. R. Harding.\n\nLate in the war, the regiment pursued Confederate General [[John Bell Hood]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |title=Battle Near Rome, Georgia, October 12, 1864 |access-date=2018-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707060209/http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The unit was instrumental in the capture of former Confederate capital [[Montgomery, Alabama]].\n\nIn June 1865 new recruits and some veterans were transferred to the [[61st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|61st Regiment]] as the 123rd prepared to disband.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/1-123in.htm 1st Battalion, 123d Infantry]</ref> Those who remained were mustered out June 27, 1865, by Captain L.

The album was initially conceived as a solo project and followup to Hole frontwoman [[Courtney Love]]'s debut solo record, ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'' (2004). At the urging of her friend and former producer, [[Linda Perry]], Love began writing material while in a lockdown [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] center in 2005 following a protracted [[cocaine]] addiction and numerous related legal troubles. In 2006, Love, along with Perry and [[Billy Corgan]], began recording the album, which at that time was tentatively titled ''How Dirty Girls Get Clean''.\n\nFollowing a number of live performances of the new songs between 2006 and 2007, Love decided to scrap the project, and began writing new material with guitarist [[Micko Larkin]], who had joined her backing band in 2007. She subsequently hired [[Michael Beinhorn]] to produce the record, and began a second run of recording sessions in [[Los Angeles]] before relocating to [[New York City]] in 2009, after which Beinhorn left the project; Larkin subsequently took the role of producer. In mid-2009, it was announced that the album, retitled ''Nobody's Daughter'', would be released as a Hole record, with guitarist Larkin, bassist Shawn Dailey, and drummer [[Stu Fisher]] as members.\n\nPrior to the album's release, former Hole guitarist [[Eric Erlandson]] publicly disputed Love's use of the Hole name, claiming it violated a previous agreement between the two, which Love contested. Upon its release, ''Nobody's Daughter'' received generally mixed reviews from [[music criticism|music critic]]s, with some praising its instrumentation and lyrics, while others criticized it for its [[folk rock]] elements as well as Love's vocals. Despite this, Love stated in 2010 that she considered it the best record she had made.<ref>{{cite episode|network=Fuse |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqt0ofwE3g |series=On The Record |title=Courtney Love |date=May 10, 2010 |accessdate=August 13, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130072237/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqt0ofwE3g |archivedate=January 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn September 2005, after violating a legal drug probation, singer and musician [[Courtney Love]] was sentenced to a six-month program in a lock-down rehabilitation center, Beau Monde, from which she was released after one half of the sentenced time and completed the other three months under house arrest.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-mar-10-me-courtney10-story.html|date=March 10, 2007|title=Rehab center is suing Courtney Love over fees|author=Powers, Ashley|url-status=live|archive-date=April 8, 2020|archive-url=http://archive.is/wip/7ln3O}}</ref> While Love was in rehab, her friend and producer [[Linda Perry]]\u2014who had previously produced her 2004 debut solo album, ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]''\u2014visited Love and supported her by encouraging to write new songs, gifting her a [[C.

The album was initially conceived as a solo project and followup to Hole frontwoman [[Courtney Love]]'s debut solo record, ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'' (2004). At the urging of her friend and former producer, [[Linda Perry]], Love began writing material while in a lockdown [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] center in 2005 following a protracted [[cocaine]] addiction and numerous related legal troubles. In 2006, Love, along with Perry and [[Billy Corgan]], began recording the album, which at that time was tentatively titled ''How Dirty Girls Get Clean''.\n\nFollowing a number of live performances of the new songs between 2006 and 2007, Love decided to scrap the project, and began writing new material with guitarist [[Micko Larkin]], who had joined her backing band in 2007. She subsequently hired [[Michael Beinhorn]] to produce the record, and began a second run of recording sessions in [[Los Angeles]] before relocating to [[New York City]] in 2009, after which Beinhorn left the project; Larkin subsequently took the role of producer. In mid-2009, it was announced that the album, retitled ''Nobody's Daughter'', would be released as a Hole record, with guitarist Larkin, bassist Shawn Dailey, and drummer [[Stu Fisher]] as members.\n\nPrior to the album's release, former Hole guitarist [[Eric Erlandson]] publicly disputed Love's use of the Hole name, claiming it violated a previous agreement between the two, which Love contested. Upon its release, ''Nobody's Daughter'' received generally mixed reviews from [[music criticism|music critic]]s, with some praising its instrumentation and lyrics, while others criticized it for its [[folk rock]] elements as well as Love's vocals.

noted that, as with Love's previous works, ''Nobody's Daughter'' \"habitually contests notions of family,\" as well as observing the record overall is \"perceptibly the product of two distinct song cycles: one immediately post-rehab, written on the acoustic guitar Love claimed saved her life, developed and given shape by Linda Perry, Love's longtime foil and the reassuring voice behind her disastrous solo album; and another, more recent cycle, the product of more active collaboration, largely with Larkin and Billy Corgan.\"<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The

He is based in [[Biel/Bienne]] ([[Switzerland]]) since the late 1990s. \n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name = \n| background = non_vocal_instrumentalist\n| image = Acc jk 4.jpg\n| l\u00e9gende = Jonas Kocher 2014\n| caption = \n| birth_date = {{Birth date and age|df=yes|1977|08|22}}\n| birth_place = [[Nyon]], Switzerland\n| genre = [[Free improvisation]], [[experimental music]]\n| occupation = Musician, composer\n| instrument = Accordion\n| website = {{url|jonaskocher.net}}\n}}\n\n== Biography ==\nComposer and [[accordionist]], Jonas Kocher followed his musical studies at the University of the Arts in [[Bern]] between 1996 and 2004 with Teodoro Anzellotti, Pierre Sublet and [[Georges Aperghis]]. He soon developed a keen interest in experimental practices in sound and performance, which led him to explore musical theater as a performer in productions by [[:de:Ruedi H\u00e4usermann|Ruedy H\u00e4usermann]] and [[:de:Daniel Ott|Daniel Ott]] and electronic music in the BlindeKinder duo. Since 2003 he has been creating his own pieces of composed theatre, various sound performances and he also dedicates himself to composition and free improvisation. Starting from 2006 and for a few years, he has worked closely with Association Rue du Nord ([[Lausanne]]).\n\nSince 2008, he has performed as accordionist with regular partners such as [[:de:Jacques Demierre|Jacques Demierre]], [[:de:Axel D\u00f6rner|Axel D\u00f6rner]], [[:de: Joke Lanz|Joke Lanz]], Christian Wolfarth, Gaudenz Badrutt, [[:fr:Michel Doneda|Michel Doneda]], Chris Heenan, [[:de: Christof Kurzmann|Christof Kurzmann]], [[:pl:Alfredo Costa Monteiro|Alfredo Costa Monteiro]] (in the accordion trio 300 basses with [[:de:Luca Venitucci|Luca Venitucci]]), [[Leonel Kaplan]], [[:de:Hans Koch (Holzbl\u00e4ser)|Hans Koch]], [[Burkhard Beins]], [[Radu Malfatti]], [[Ilan Manouach]] and many others. His musical activity has led him to perform throughout Europe and in Russia, Japan and the USA and to collaborate with dancers and visual artists.\n\nAs interpreter, he encourages collaborations with musicians and composers such as Christian Kesten, Stefan Thut, [[Antoine Chessex]], Chiyoko Szlavnics or [[Radu Malfatti]]. If his practice of improvisation seems to contrast with his parallel interest in composition and sound performance, it is only because the creative dimension of these areas is not taken into account in its entirety; this is an area where Jonas Kocher sees a field of privileged artistic experimentation and where listening, sound and space are constantly explored.\n\nAs a composer, he has produced works that range between composed theatre, installations and concert pieces. He has composed occasionally for [[Radio drama|audio drama]], dance and theater. Jonas Kocher is active as an organizer of concerts in Switzerland and elsewhere and he is running BRUIT, a platform dedicated to experimental sound practices.\n\nIn 2005 he received the Art award of the city of [[Nyon]] and in 2010 the prize of recognition of the music committee of the [[Canton of Bern]]e. His works have been performed at the Biennale Bern 2010, Musikfestival Bern 2017 and 2018, Umlaut festival Berlin, the Jardins Musicaux festival of Cernier, the Forge London, the Zagreb Biennale, SMC Lausanne, Thessaloniki Art Biennale, etc.\n\n== Works ==\n* 2019: ''Perspectives and echoes'', for 6 players (percussion, live electronics and four instruments)\n* 2018: ''Avec Bataille'', performance for 7 participants with headphones and one improvising musician\n* 2018: ''HOME (M\u00fcnstergasse 37)'', in situ sound performance for 4 musicians and 2 actors\n* 2017: ''Irrlicht'', for loudspeakers and four performers in a resonant space\n* 2017: ''Rough'', for 10 musicians\n* 2015: ''h\u00e1los'', for harp solo\n* 2015: ''Intervention No. 2 [pasquart]'', in situ sound performance\n* 2015: ''Intervention No. 1 [cave12]'', in situ sound performance\n* 2013: ''Hornussen'', in situ sound performance\n* 2013: ''Nichi Nichi Kore Ko Nichi'', sound performance\n* 2012: ''Commedia'', for piano, clarinet, violin, vcello and pre-recorded sounds\n* 2011: ''Agitations (Adagio)'', for small symphony orchestra (young interpreters) and pre-recorded sounds\n* 2010: ''Frictions'', musical theater\n* 2010: ''Promenade \u00e0 travers une \u0153uvre'', in situ sound performance\n* 2010: ''Grrrrr!!'', for string quartet (young interpreters)\n* 2009: ''Serge'', for ensemble\n* 2008: ''3 ombres'', for ensemble (three compositions intended to be played with Pierrot Lunaire of A.

Starting from 2006 and for a few years, he has worked closely with Association Rue du Nord ([[Lausanne]]).\n\nSince 2008, he has performed as accordionist with regular partners such as [[:de:Jacques Demierre|Jacques Demierre]], [[:de:Axel D\u00f6rner|Axel D\u00f6rner]], [[:de: Joke Lanz|Joke Lanz]], Christian Wolfarth, Gaudenz Badrutt, [[:fr:Michel Doneda|Michel Doneda]], Chris Heenan, [[:de: Christof Kurzmann|Christof Kurzmann]], [[:pl:Alfredo Costa Monteiro|Alfredo Costa Monteiro]] (in the accordion trio 300 basses with [[:de:Luca Venitucci|Luca Venitucci]]), [[Leonel Kaplan]], [[:de:Hans Koch (Holzbl\u00e4ser)|Hans Koch]], [[Burkhard Beins]], [[Radu Malfatti]], [[Ilan Manouach]] and many others. His musical activity has led him to perform throughout Europe and in Russia, Japan and the USA and to collaborate with dancers and visual artists.\n\nAs interpreter, he encourages collaborations with musicians and composers such as Christian Kesten, Stefan Thut, [[Antoine Chessex]], Chiyoko Szlavnics or [[Radu Malfatti]]. If his practice of improvisation seems to contrast with his parallel interest in composition and sound performance, it is only because the creative dimension of these areas is not taken into account in its entirety; this is an area where Jonas Kocher sees a field of privileged artistic experimentation and where listening, sound and space are constantly explored.\n\nAs a composer, he has produced works that range between composed theatre, installations and concert pieces. He has composed occasionally for [[Radio drama|audio drama]], dance and theater. Jonas Kocher is active as an organizer of concerts in Switzerland and elsewhere and he is running BRUIT, a platform dedicated to experimental sound practices.\n\nIn 2005 he received the Art award of the city of [[Nyon]] and in 2010 the prize of recognition of the music committee of the [[Canton of Bern]]e. His works have been performed at the Biennale Bern 2010, Musikfestival Bern 2017 and 2018, Umlaut festival Berlin, the Jardins Musicaux festival of Cernier, the Forge London, the Zagreb Biennale, SMC Lausanne, Thessaloniki Art Biennale, etc.\n\n== Works ==\n* 2019: ''Perspectives and echoes'', for 6 players (percussion, live electronics and four instruments)\n* 2018: ''Avec Bataille'', performance for 7 participants with headphones and one improvising musician\n* 2018: ''HOME (M\u00fcnstergasse 37)'', in situ sound performance for 4 musicians and 2 actors\n* 2017: ''Irrlicht'', for loudspeakers and four performers in a resonant space\n* 2017: ''Rough'', for 10 musicians\n* 2015: ''h\u00e1los'', for harp solo\n* 2015: ''Intervention No. 2 [pasquart]'', in situ sound performance\n* 2015: ''Intervention No. 1 [cave12]'', in situ sound performance\n* 2013: ''Hornussen'', in situ sound performance\n* 2013: ''Nichi Nichi Kore Ko Nichi'', sound performance\n* 2012: ''Commedia'', for piano, clarinet, violin, vcello and pre-recorded sounds\n* 2011: ''Agitations (Adagio)'', for small symphony orchestra (young interpreters) and pre-recorded sounds\n* 2010: ''Frictions'', musical theater\n* 2010: ''Promenade \u00e0 travers une \u0153uvre'', in situ sound performance\n* 2010: ''Grrrrr!!'', for string quartet (young interpreters)\n* 2009: ''Serge'', for ensemble\n* 2008: ''3 ombres'', for ensemble (three compositions intended to be played with Pierrot Lunaire of A.

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. This also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to a [[desert]] and the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Copper-basin-satellite-1984.png|thumb|right|Satellite image showing the Copper Basin in 1984]]\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. This also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to a [[desert]] and the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Copper-basin-satellite-1984.png|thumb|right|Satellite image showing the Copper Basin in 1984]]\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia.

Additionally, the [[Federal Transfer Center, Oklahoma City|Federal Transfer Center]] at Oklahoma City's [[Will Rogers World Airport]] was built especially to facilitate prisoner transport on JPATS.\n\nUsually, the [[airline]] employs [[Boeing 737-400]] aircraft to transport convicts and illegal residents of the [[United States]] for extradition.  Smaller jets and turboprops are also used to transport individual prisoners who are considered particularly dangerous or notorious, as well as individuals in the witness protection program.\n\nAccording to the Boeing Jetliner Databook, JPATS operates three Boeing 737s. JPATS also operates an additional [[Saab 2000|Saab 2000 turboprop]].<ref name=\"http://registry.faa.gov\">{{Cite web|url=https://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=92225|title=FAA Registry - Aircraft - N-Number Inquiry|website=registry.faa.gov}}</ref>\n\nJPATS aircraft use the [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] designator '''DOJ''' with the callsign '''JUSTICE'''.\n\nImmediately after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], when the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] [[Closings and cancellations following the September 11, 2001 attacks#Travel effects|grounded all civilian air service]], JPATS was the only civilian passenger-carrying air service allowed to continue flying in U.S. airspace.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==History and evolution==\nPrior to the existence of JPATS, the air transport of federal inmates over long distances was complicated. The process required an escort by two U.S. Marshals, accompanying the inmate on a regular passenger airplane. This posed numerous problems, including danger to civilians, a backlog of marshals needed to perform such escorts, and a high taxpayer expense.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the U.S. Marshals were offered a transfer from the [[Federal Aviation Administration|Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)]] of a [[Boeing 727]] aircraft. Though no purpose was originally designated for this plane, one official had the idea of using it for the mass transportation of federal inmates. JPATS' predecessor was the ''National Prisoner Transportation System'' of the U.S. Marshals Service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmarshals.gov/history/npts/index.html |title=U.S. Marshals Service, History, National Prisoner Transportation System |publisher=Usmarshals.gov |date=1985-08-20 |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref>\n\nThe airline ultimately improved the efficiency of inmate transportation and made the sight of a shackled commercial airline passenger largely a thing of the past. For a plane full of 200 inmates, only 12 marshals are required. Marshals are trained with aircraft emergency procedures very similar to those [[flight attendant]]s learn to protect the aircraft's occupants.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n==Today==\n[[File:JPATS-prisoners stepping down an aircraft.jpg|thumb|Prisoners deplaning|right|upright=1.15]]\nToday's{{When|date=November 2019}} JPATS fleet has expanded to three full-sized aircraft.<ref name=\"wired\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mro-network.com/maintenance-repair-overhaul/aar-maintain-aircraft-us-marshals-service|title=AAR to Maintain Aircraft for U.S. Marshals Service|date=2018-12-04|website=MRO Network|language=en|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref> These planes fly a large series of routes that serve nearly every major U.S. city.<ref name=\"usmarshals.gov\"/>\n\nThe flight schedules are kept secret from the public, and are known only to those directly involved in its operation.

Additionally, the [[Federal Transfer Center, Oklahoma City|Federal Transfer Center]] at Oklahoma City's [[Will Rogers World Airport]] was built especially to facilitate prisoner transport on JPATS.\n\nUsually, the [[airline]] employs [[Boeing 737-400]] aircraft to transport convicts and illegal residents of the [[United States]] for extradition.  Smaller jets and turboprops are also used to transport individual prisoners who are considered particularly dangerous or notorious, as well as individuals in the witness protection program.\n\nAccording to the Boeing Jetliner Databook, JPATS operates three Boeing 737s. JPATS also operates an additional [[Saab 2000|Saab 2000 turboprop]].<ref name=\"http://registry.faa.gov\">{{Cite web|url=https://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=92225|title=FAA Registry - Aircraft - N-Number Inquiry|website=registry.faa.gov}}</ref>\n\nJPATS aircraft use the [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] designator '''DOJ''' with the callsign '''JUSTICE'''.\n\nImmediately after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], when the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] [[Closings and cancellations following the September 11, 2001 attacks#Travel effects|grounded all civilian air service]], JPATS was the only civilian passenger-carrying air service allowed to continue flying in U.S. airspace.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==History and evolution==\nPrior to the existence of JPATS, the air transport of federal inmates over long distances was complicated. The process required an escort by two U.S. Marshals, accompanying the inmate on a regular passenger airplane. This posed numerous problems, including danger to civilians, a backlog of marshals needed to perform such escorts, and a high taxpayer expense.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the U.S. Marshals were offered a transfer from the [[Federal Aviation Administration|Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)]] of a [[Boeing 727]] aircraft. Though no purpose was originally designated for this plane, one official had the idea of using it for the mass transportation of federal inmates. JPATS' predecessor was the ''National Prisoner Transportation System'' of the U.S. Marshals Service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmarshals.gov/history/npts/index.html |title=U.S. Marshals Service, History, National Prisoner Transportation System |publisher=Usmarshals.gov |date=1985-08-20 |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref>\n\nThe airline ultimately improved the efficiency of inmate transportation and made the sight of a shackled commercial airline passenger largely a thing of the past. For a plane full of 200 inmates, only 12 marshals are required. Marshals are trained with aircraft emergency procedures very similar to those [[flight attendant]]s learn to protect the aircraft's occupants.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n==Today==\n[[File:JPATS-prisoners stepping down an aircraft.jpg|thumb|Prisoners deplaning|right|upright=1.15]]\nToday's{{When|date=November 2019}} JPATS fleet has expanded to three full-sized aircraft.<ref name=\"wired\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mro-network.com/maintenance-repair-overhaul/aar-maintain-aircraft-us-marshals-service|title=AAR to Maintain Aircraft for U.S. Marshals Service|date=2018-12-04|website=MRO Network|language=en|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref> These planes fly a large series of routes that serve nearly every major U.S. city.<ref name=\"usmarshals.gov\"/>\n\nThe flight schedules are kept secret from the public, and are known only to those directly involved in its operation.
