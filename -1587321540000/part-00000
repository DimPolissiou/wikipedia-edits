L. Poole speculates that Adrian may have been born many years later, as he was sent on a lengthy trip to Scandinavia in 1152, and, says Poole, \"so onerous a task would hardly have been imposed on a man past middle age\"{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=295}}|group=note}}{{snd}}1 September 1159, also '''Hadrian IV'''),{{sfn|Parry|1997|p=18}} was [[Pope]] from 4 December 1154 to his death in 1159. Born in [[Hertfordshire]], England, his father may have been a [[clerk]] and a [[monk]] called Robert, but his mother is unknown, and he may have been illegitimate. Although he does not appear to have received a great degree of schooling, while still a youth he travelled to France where he was schooled in [[Arles]], studying law. He then travelled to [[Avignon]], in the south, where he joined the abbey of [[St Ruf]]. There he became a [[Canons regular|canon regular]] and was eventually appointed abbot. He travelled to [[Rome]] several times, where he appears to have caught the attention of [[Pope Eugenius III]]. Eugenius sent him on a mission to [[Catalonia]], where the [[Reconquista]] was attempting to reclaim land from the Muslim [[Al-Andalus]]. Around this time his abbey complained to Eugenius that Breakspear was too heavy a [[disciplinarian]], and in order to make use of him as a [[papal legate]] as well as to pacify his monks, the Pope appointed Breakspear [[Bishop of Albano]] some time around 1149.\n\nAs Bishop, Breakspear was soon sent on another diplomatic mission, this time to [[Scandinavia]]. In the middle of [[Civil war era in Norway|a civil war]], Breakspear reorganised the church in Norway and then moved on to Sweden. Here he was very much accclamed by the people, and when he left, [[Chronicle|chroniclers]] called him a saint. Breakspear returned to Rome in 1154; the Pope had died only a few weeks previously. For reasons now unknown, but possibly at his predecessor's request, Breakspear was elected next Pope by the cardinals. He took the name Adrian IV. He was unable to complete his coronation service, however, because of the parlous state of politics in Rome, which at the time was a den of [[heresy]] and [[republicanism]]. Adrian decisively restored the papal authority there, but his other major policy issue\u2014relations with the newly-crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I\u2014]]<nowiki/>started off badly and got progressively worse. Each party, as a result of a particular aggravating incident, found something to condemn the other for. As a result, Adrian entered into an alliance with the [[Byzantine emperor]], [[Manuel I Komnenos]] who was keen to re-assert his authority in the south of Italy, but was unable to do so due to the [[Norman Kingdom of Sicily|Norman Kings]]' occupation of the region, now under [[William I of Sicily]].\n\nAdrian's alliance with the Byzantie emperor came to nothing, as William decisively defeated Manuel and forced Adrian to come to terms at the [[Treaty of Benevento]]. This alienated Emperor Frederick even more, as he saw it as a repudiation of [[Treaty of Constance (1153)|their existing treaty]]. Relations souted further when Frederick laid claim to a large swathe of territory in northern Italy. Adrian's elations with his country of birth, however, seem to have remained generally good. Certainly he showered [[St Albans Abbey]] with privileges, and he appears to have forwarded [[Henry II of England|King Henry II's]] policies where he could. Most famously, in 1158 Adrian is supposed to have granted Henry the [[papal bull]] ''[[Laudabiliter]]'', which is thought to have authorised Henry to invade Ireland. Henry did not do so, however, for another 14 years, and scholars are uncertain whether the bull ever existed.\n\nFollowing Adrian's death at [[Anagni]], there was uncertainty as to who to succeed him, with both pro- and anti-imperial cardinals voting for different candidates. Although officially [[Pope Alexander III]] officially took over, the concomitant election of an [[Antipope]] led to a 22-year-long schism. Scholars have debated Adrian's pontificate widely. Much of a positive nature\u2014his building program and reorganisation of papal finances, for example\u2014has been identified, particularly in the context of such a short reign. He was also up against powerful forces out of his control, which, while he never overcame them, he managed effectively.\n\n==Early life==\nThe son of Richard Breakspear,{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} his family was a relatively humble one.{{sfn|Summerson|2004}} The exact year of his birth is unknown but he was probably around 55 years old on his election.{{sfn|Norwich|2011}} Little is known{{refn|The only reliable source closest to his own life is that by Cardinal Boso in the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', but, comments Brooke, \"this is exceedingly terse on his early life\", noting only his nationality and voyage to France for learning.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=4}}|group=note}} of his background, and that which is, comments Brooke, \"savour[s] of gossip rather than sober history.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=4}} He was probably born in or around the Hertfordshire town of [[St Albans]]. As a result, much of that that is thought to be known may well be mythological \"tradition woven at the great abbey\" there.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} Much of what is known is brought to historians by the writings of [[Boso (Cardinal)|Cardinal Boso]] and [[William of Newburgh]], both of whom were, however, writing over 30 years after Breakspear's death.{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=291}} As a result, notes Poole, there is a dearth of information\u2014and especially dates\u2014for Breakspear's life until his election as Pope, and \"all that can be said is that the dates commonly given are in every instance wrong\".{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=293}} The contemporary English [[chronicle]]r [[Matthew Paris]] says he came from [[Abbots Langley]],{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|1997|p=97}} although Paris mistakenly ascribes to his father the name [[Robert de Camera]].{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=5}} Robert may have been a clerk{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|1997|p=97}}{{refn|Christopher Brooke also surmises that, with a surname such as \"Camera\", he was likely to have been a clerk.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=6}}|group=note}} although Sayers suggests that Paris' claim that Robert was a priest is probably correct, as is the likelihood that he later became a monk.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}}{{refn|Richard may have been a married priest, as, during his son's later struggle with the Holy Roman Emperor, the latter asserted it was the case as a slur.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} This was not unusual in the 12th-century church. The historian [[Anne Llewellyn Barstow]] says: \"Despite six hundred years of decrees, canons, and increasingly harsh penalties, the Latin clergy still...lived with their wives and raised families. In practice, ordination was not an impediment to marriage; therefore some priests did marry even after ordination.\"{{sfn|Barstow|1982|p=45}} The practice was generally confined to lower orders, such as [[subdeacon]]s, however, it may be that de Camera was one such.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=19}}|group=note}} As such, there are grounds for believing him to have been illegitimate.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=4}} Nicholas had a brother called either Ranulf or Randall, a [[clerk]] in [[Feering]], Essex.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} Paris is also the source for Nicholas' surname being Breakspear.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}}\n\nParis recounts a story that Nicholas was rejected by [[Abbot of St Albans|Abbot Robert de Gorron]] from taking his [[novitiate]] at the abbey, although as Poole points out, the story is demonstrably incorrect as Robert did not become abbot until 1151.{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=292}} Sayers, suggests that, true or not, during and after Breakspear's pontificate, \"certainly St Albans fed upon the story of the local boy who had made good\".{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} William of Newburgh reports that Nicholas was too poor to receive anything more than a rudimentary education, and Brooke speculates that he travelled to France to learn the skills of a clerk. This was, he notes, a normal path to preferment in the 12th century, although it was more unusual for those that did so to have Breakspear's inauspicious background.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=19}} He may have become a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] at the [[Augustinian priory]] in [[Merton, Surrey]].{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} Poole subscribes to this theory, citing a letter to Breakspear when Pope in which he is reminded that \"your worship was wont to speak\" of Merton in conversation.{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=293}}\n\n===Move to France and promotion===\n[[File:St Alban&#039;s cathedral - geograph.org.uk - 1344.jpg|thumb|St Albans Abbey, now a Cathedral, seen in 2005|alt=Colour photograph of St Albans Abbey, now a cathedral|left]]\nThe next point at which Breakspear can be positively identified is in the French town of [[Arles]], where he continued his studies{{sfn|Parry|1997|p=18}} in [[canon law]],{{sfn|Duggan|2004|p=189 n.80}} and probably under the masters of Roman law also.{{sfn|Egger|2003|p=20}} On completion of his studies, he travelled south and became a [[canon regular]] at the priory of [[St Ruf]],{{refn|Also called St Rufus,{{sfn|Parry|1997|p=18}} this was an important regional [[motherhouse]].{{sfn|Zinn|1995|p=1481}}{{sfn|Morris|1989|p=190}}|group=note}} [[Avignon]]. He was soon appointed [[prior]]{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=291}} and then abbot.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} While still a canon, in 1140 he appears to have written a charter in [[Barcelona]].{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=294}} However, there appear to have been complaints that he was overly strict,{{sfn|Norwich|2011}} and the monks rebelled.{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=294}} As a result he was summoned to Rome;{{sfn|Parry|1997|p=18}}{{sfn|Norwich|2011}} a temporary peace was established, but it was not long until the monks rebelled again.{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=294}} Breakspear may have visited Rome three times while at St Ruf\u2014\"each time with more conspicuous success\"\u2014and which would have consumed many months of his time.{{sfn|Poole|1969|pp=294\u2013295}}\n\nSayers suggests that it was while Breakspear was at St Ruf that he attracted the attention of [[Pope Eugenius III]],{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} who saw in him useful leadership qualities.{{sfn|Parry|1997|p=18}}{{refn|Eugenius may also have been an [[Anglophile]], as it appears that he once told John of Salisbury \"that he found the English admirably fitted to perform any task they turned their hand to, and thus to be preferred to all other races\u2014except, he added, when frivolity got the better of them\".{{sfn|Norwich|1970|p=172}}|group=note}} It is known that in 1147, while Eugenius was in [[Vico Pancellorum|Vico]] he granted one \"N. abbot of St Rufus\".{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=294}} It was probably in 1148 that Breakspear met who would become his good friend, John of Salisbury, in [[Rheims]],{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=7}} and soon after when {{sfn|Morris|1989|p=190}}{{sfn|Bolton|2003a|p=75}} Eugenius appointed hi [[Cardinal-Bishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Suburbicarian Diocese of Albano|Albano]],{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} making Adrian at the time only the second Englishman to have been promoted to that rank.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=355}}{{refn|The first had been the theologian [[Robert Pullen]], to the Cardinalate of [[SS. Martino e Silvestro]].{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=355}}|group=note}} in which capacity he attended the [[Council of Reims (1148)|Council of Reims]] in November 1148.{{sfn|Duggan|2004|p=180}}{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=33}} Poole suggests that Breakspear's promotion was Eugenius' method of alleviating the monks' complaints, as Eugenius told them to \"go forth [and] elect you a father with whom ye can or will live in peace; he [Breakspear] shall no longer be a burthen to you\".{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=294}} When Breakspear was later Pope, however, he seemed to favour St Ruf well, for example authorising them to send a delegation to the [[Cathedral chapter|chapter]] of [[Pisa Cathedral]] to cut stone and columns. The chapter was requested, says Egger, to \"help them in every possible way to conduct their business\".{{sfn|Egger|2003|p=27}}\n\nPoole questions the reasoning for Breakspear's episcopal promotion. Not only was his abbey an obscure one, with no political value or great endowment, but Breakspear's reasons for attending the Papal court were unlikely to have enabled him to make a name for himself. Indeed, on at least one occasion it was in response to a summons concerning his behaviour. However, suggest Poole, a possible explanation may have its roots in Breakspear's residency at Merton.{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=295}}{{refn|Poole suggests that in the early-to-mid-portion of the 12th century, Merton was much favoured by [[Roman Catholic Diocese of S\u00e9ez#Bishops|John, Bishop of S\u00e9ez]], and it had been Bishop John who had appointed Robert Pullen to the [[Archdeacon of Rochester#High Medieval|Archdeaconry of Rochester]]; by 1149, Pullen was Papal Chancellor and, Poole suggests, listened favourably to the recommendation of S\u00e9ez regarding Breakspeare, particularly as he was a fellow countryman.{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=295}}|group=note}} Duggan notes that the Cardinal Bishopric of Albino was part of the Pope's inner circle, which she suggests makes his rapid elevation to such a sensitive position all the more remarkable and indicative of the now-unrecognisable qualities that Eugenius saw in him.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=201}}\n\n===Voyage to Catalonia===\nIt was probably at the Council of Reims that Eugenius selected Breakspear for a mission to Catalonia,{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=33}}{{refn|The scholar Damian Smith notes a pre-existing connection between Breakspear and the region through his predecessor at St Ruf, Olegarius, abbot between 1113 and 1118,{{sfn|McCrank|1978|pp=162, nn.15+17}} and who had then been unwillingly promoted to the [[Bishopric of Barcelona]] and subsequently the [[Archbishopric of Tarragona]]. He also became an important advisor to Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=33}}|group=note}} possibly as a kind of unofficial legate to the crusaders.{{sfn|Constable|1953|p=25}} Breakspear met [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona]] who had been waging the latest campaign against the Moors since 1147. Although no records exist to show Breakspear was involved in the campaign itself, he was heavily involved in the reorganisation and administration of the [[Cistercian Order]], as well as arbitrating disputes within its congregation.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=35}} It is likely that he was present at the [[Lleida|Siege of Lleida]] during the summer of 1149. He is less likely to have still been there in October, when it fell, as e had returned to Rome by December. However, he may well have brought news of another successful siege\u2014that of [[Tortosa]]\u2014which would have been particularly welcome to the \"bruised and battered\" papacy of Eugenius, says Damian Smith.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=36}} Smith also notes that Breakspear's lengthy absence from St Ruf may have been a source of complaint by his monks, \"but this was surely not of prime importance to the Pope\".{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=36}} Egger suggests, however, that Breakspear's Catalonian mission was of great benefit to St Ruf, which became the blueprint for the religious houses created by Berenguer in the wake of the retreating Muslim empire.{{sfn|Egger|2003|p=25}}{{refn|St Ruf's observances, suggests Egger, became popular with the Catalonian nobility as well as the church, so was \"of no small advantage to the order\".{{sfn|Egger|2003|p=25}}|group=note}}\n\nAround mid-1152, he was despatched to [[Scandinavia]] as [[Papal legate]].{{sfn|Sayers|2004}}\n\n===Visit to Scandinavia, 1152===\n[[File:Trondheim-cathedral-1.jpg|thumb|upright=|Trondheim Cathedral, as seen in 2005|alt=modern photo of Trondheim Cathedral]]\nFormer [[Canon residentiary]] of St Albans Abbey, Andes Bergquist has described Breakspear's journey to northern Europe as \"one of the better documented\" of his career. It is possible that Boso\u2014from whom much of the information comes\u2014was in his entourage, although this is not certain.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|pp=41, 42}} On his arrival, Norway was in a [[Civil war era in Norway|state of civil war]] and the authority of the King, [[Inge I of Norway|Inge I]], was neither strong nor respected. Breakspear reconciled the warring factions\u2014albeit temporarily\u2014and restored the monarchy.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} although no official record of his instructions survives, Bergquist suggests that they can be inferred from his actions: to divide the existing Archbishopric of Lund\u2014which covered both Norway and Sweden\u2013into two distinct national metropolitans, to arrange payment of Peter's Pence and to generally reorganise the church along Italian and European lines.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=42}}\n\nBreakspear may have travelled to Norway via France and England{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=43}}\u2014where, Sayers speculates, he could have recruited merchant contacts who knew the region.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}}{{sfn|And\u00e5s|Ekroll|Haug|Petersen|2007|p=9}} His mission may have been kept quiet, as Bergquist notes his arrival seems t have been unexpected: Archbishop Eskil of Lund had recently left to visit France, and the King of Norway was on a military campaign.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=44}} His first stop was Norway. At some point, Breakspear presided over a council at [[Nidaros]]. This council, says Robinson, \"strengthened the economic position of the church and the social status of the clergy\".{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} Its timing though is difficult to ascertain, says Bergquist: Autumn 1152 seems to allow too little time to organise such a major council following his arrival, yet much later and the depth of a Norwegian winter is even more unlikely.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nThe focal point of the [[Olaf II of Norway#Liturgical cult|cult of St Olaf]],{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} Nidaros had until that point been only an episcopate.{{sfn|And\u00e5s|Ekroll|Haug|Petersen|2007|p=9}} Adrian's council was intended to promulgate [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canons]].{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} To this end Breakspear made Nidaros a geographically-extensive ecclesiastical [[province]], covering the whole of Norway, Iceland and Greenland, as well as the [[Faroe Islands|Faroe]], [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland Island]]s. Breakspear also authorised the expansion of what was to become Europe's [[Trondheim Cathedral|most northerly medieval cathedral]], and its largest.{{sfn|And\u00e5s|Ekroll|Haug|Petersen|2007|p=9}} While in Norway he founded three [[cathedral schools]], at Nidaros in 1152 and two more at [[Bergen]] and [[Hamar]] the following year.{{sfn|Sj\u00e5vik|2008|p=63}} His work in Norway earned him the praise of contemporary Norwegian writer and politician, [[Snorri Sturluson]].{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=200}}\n\nIf the Council of Nidaros was held in the early months of 1143, suggests Bergquist, then it appears that Breakspear sailed to Sweden as soon as it was concluded.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=44}} His activities in Sweden followed a similar course to those in Norway.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=46}} He called another council, this time at [[Link\u00f6ping]], which reorganised the Swedish church under the [[Archbishop of Lund]] (it had previously been subject to German patriarchy).{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} He also received permission from the [[Swedish monarchy]] to introduce [[Peter's pence]]{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} and to reduce the influence of the lay community on the church generally.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=46}} His visit to Sweden was recorded by contemporary chroniclers and published in the 13th century.{{sfn|Phelpstead|2001|p=xxxiv}} Similarly to what he had done in Norway with Trondheim,{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} Adrian attempted to create an archepiscopal see for Sweden. This was opposed by one of the three provinces, [[Gothland]], and the venture came to nothing.{{sfn|Eden|2006|pp=292\u2013293}} According to Bergquist, Breakspear \"\"was taken aback by this unseemly conflict, and declared that neither people deserved this highest ecclesiastical honour\".{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=46}} Indeed, he suggests that it is possible that Breakspear's plans fell through thanks to the machinations of the recently-returned Archbishop Eskil. Eskil, having discovered that he had lost half his archepiscopate in his absence, may have stirred up the Swedes' and Goths' rivalries to ensure against losing any more. In the event, Breakspear appears to have repaired relations with Eskil, assuring him that Eskil would receive far more than he had lost. As a result, he placed Eskil in charge of the new Swedish metropolitan.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=46}} \n\nDuggan describes Adrian's legation in the north has a \"diplomatic triumph\",{{sfn|Duggan|2003a|p=153}} being so successful, says Sayers, \"that he was later seen as the apostle of Scandinavia\".{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} Boso later lauded how Breakspear brought \"peace to the kingdoms, law to the barbarians, tranquillity to the monasteries, order to the churches, discipline to the clergy and a people pleasing to God, devoted to good works\".{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} He successfully introduced a new Scandinavian [[tythe]]\u2014the ''denarium sancti Petri'', or payment to St Peter\u2014a financial acknowledgement by the Scandinavian church of Papal primacy.{{sfn|Sheehy|1961|pp=48\u201349}} Breakspear, argues the scholar Andrew Beck, \"gave the Swedish church its hierarchy and its attachment to Rome\".{{sfn|Beck|1940|p=383}}{{refn|Breakspear was one of two English clerics who influenced Scandinavian Christianity at this time; the other was [[Henry (bishop of Finland)|Henry, Bishop of Uppsala]], who was originally from St Albans.{{sfn|Singleton|1998|p=18}}|group=note}} He left Scandinavia in autumn 1154; he seems to have left a generally good impression in the region: A later [[Kings' sagas|saga]] refers to Breaksperare as \"the good cardinal...now considered a saint\".{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=41}} On his return to Rome he found Pope Eugenius had died the previous year, and that his successor had followed him only a few weeks before; the [[College of Cardinals]] was seeking a successor.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=41}}\n\n==Political background==\n[[File:Plan of Rome in the Middle Ages - Historical Atlas by William R.

The [[Hohenstaufen]] [[Frederick Barbarossa]] had been elected [[Holy Roman Emperor]] on 4 March 1152.{{sfn|Barber|1992|p=101}} Barbarossa and Eugenius had contracted, at the [[Treaty of Constance]], to unite against both William of Sicily and the Roman Commune.{{sfn|Barber|1992|p=101}} {{refn|However, the contemporary chronicler of 12th-century Popes Boso, noted that\u2014notwithstanding the hostility of Rome to the Pope at this time\u2014these elections were peaceful and unanimous, although Boso did describe the election of Eugenius III as taking place in \"unexpected harmony\".{{sfn|Robinson|1996|p=78}} Sicily, a Papal fief in name only, provided its theoretical Papal lords with neither status nor income.{{sfn|Loud|2004|p=465}} Adrian's predecessor, Anastasia, had possessed a good grasp of the intricacies of Roman politics and had used his knowledge to maintain peaceful relations between all factions where possible.{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|1997|p=97}}|group=note}}\n\nUllmann has identified four major areas of concern for Adrian at the beginning of his pontificate: the city of Rome under Arnold of Brescia, the new Emperor who was marching towards Rome for his coronation, his counterpart in the east whose army had recently invaded southern Italy, and restlessness among the Pope's own vassals in his patrimony.{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=235}} By the time of Adrian's consecration, the city of Rome was a major player in Papal-Aristocatric regional politics.{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=446}} Under the governance of a republican commune since 1144,{{sfn|Twyman|2003|p=49}} Pope Eugenius had recognised it the following year.

In other words, all Christians, East or West, should be subjugated to the church of St Peter.{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=249}}\n\n===Norman victory===\nStrategically, King William's position was not looking good, and he offered Adrian large sums in financial compensation for the Pope to withdraw his forces.

embittered relations between him and the Pope further.{{sfn|Matthew|1992|p=193}}|group=note}} Adrian's treaty with William angered the Emperor, who took it as a personal slight that Adrian had treated with the two Imperial rivals to Italy and confirmed his view of Adrian's Papal arrogance.{{sfn|Norwich|1970|p=180}} This, suggests Robinson, sowed the seeds of the disputed election following Adrian's death.{{sfn|Robinson|1996|p=79}}{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=378}}\n\nThe defeat of Manuel's army left the Pope vulnerable, and in June 1156 Adrian was forced to come to terms with the Sicilian

At the Treaty of Benevento, Adrian was represented by the Cardinals Ubald, Julius and Roland;{{sfn|Matthew|1992|p=65}} the Papacy was forced to cede much valuable land, rights and income to William.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=367}} The Emperor felt personally betrayed: according to the contemporary chronicler [[Geoffrey of Viterbo]], the Pope, \"wish[ed] to be an enemy of

south (by his alliance with Sicily) and the commune as peaceful as it had been for some time, Adrian was able to reside in Rome again and \"stood in a more secure position than any of his predecessors had for decades\".{{sfn|Whalen|2014|p=126}} They were made worse in 1157 when, in a letter to the Emperor, Adrian referred to the Empire by the Latin term ''beneficium'', which some of Barbarossa's councillors translated as [[fief]], rather than [[benefice]]. This, they claimed, implied that the Pope saw the Empire as subordinate to the Papacy.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}}{{refn|The two parties used different terms to mean the same thing. Both originally used ''beneficium'' to mean a feudal holding. The church had begun using the term ''feudum'' a few years earlier; the Empire had not.

Equally provocative, Freed suggests, was Adrian's later assertion that letters which criticised the Emperor's behaviour were somehow to his advantage.{{sfn|Freed|2016|pp=202\u2013203}} Adrian's \"sharp\" words also contributed to the Emperor's advisors increasing discontent with his messengers. The Pope had also ordered that, before any negotiations took place, the Emperor's council would accept Adrian's letters \"without any hesitation...as though proceeding from our mouth\".{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=205}} The cardinals appear to have worsened their reception by calling Frederick \"brother\".{{sfn|Duggan|2003a|p=132}}\n\nThe Emperor was also exasperated to find, on ordering the legates' quarters searched, blank parchments with the Papal seal attached.

Adrian's reasoning was that a [[sacrement]] outweighed a feudal due and that no Christian had the right to stand in the way of another's receiving of a sacrament. This was to become the definitive statement of marriage as a sacrament,{{sfn|Reynolds|2016|pp=40, 451}} and remained such until the recodification of [[1917 Code of Canon Law|Canon Law in 1917]].{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=190}} The same year, Adrian consecrated the [[Bishop of Gradisca|Bishop of Grado]], [[Enrico Dandolo (patriarch)|Enrico Dandolo]] as [[Dalmatia|Primate of Dalmatia]].{{sfn|Madden|2007|p=36}} Two years later, Adrian granted him primacy over all the Venetian churches in the Eastern Empire.{{sfn|Madden|2018|p=63}} This has been described as \"a remarkable move\": The historian [[Thomas F. Madden]] notes that not only did was this the first occasion on which one metropolitan had been given jurisdiction over another, but in doing so Adrian had created the equivalent of an Eastern [[Patriarch]] in the west.{{sfn|Madden|2012|p=80}} He also confirmed the degradation of [[Baume Abbey]] imposed by Eugenius for its failure to obey a Papal legate.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=325 n.48}}\n\nAdrian confirmed the prerogatives of the [[Knights Templar]] and documented in the ''[[Liber Censuum]]''.{{sfn|Bellomo|2008|p=268}} He also enforced the rules against unfree ecclesiastical elections and condemned ecclesiastics who used physical force against the church.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=191}} Perhaps reflecting his earlier career, he also promulgated several bulls in favour of the [[Austin canon]]s. Again, he particularly focussed on houses of his personal association; St Ruf, for example, received at least 10 bulls of privilege. In one of these, he expressed a \"special bond of affection\" for his old abbey, which he said had been like a mother to him.{{sfn|Egger|2003|p=27}}\n\nAdrian argued that, in the troubled succession to [[Alfonso the Battler|Alfonso I of Aragon]], even though Alfonso had legally nominated an heir\u2014his brother\u2014because he had not had a son, his brother was not a direct heir to the Kingdom.{{sfn|Martindale|1989|p=27}} This was the context for the projected crusade into Spain as suggested by the Kings of England and France, which Adrian rejected. He did, however, welcome their new friendship.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=39}}\n\nIt was probably Adrian who [[canonised]] [[Sigfrid of Sweden]] around 1158, thus making Sigfrid Sweden's [[apostle]].{{sfn|Beck|1940|p=384}} Robinson notes that Adrian's fascination with Scandinavia continued into his pontificate, particularly in his efforts to create a Swedish metropolis. He was also keen to defend its church against lay encroachment.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} In January 1157 Archbishop Eskil{{refn|Eskil was a personal friend of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] and had been responsible for originally introducing [[monasticism]] to Denmark and Sweden.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=350}}|group=note}} personally presented a petition to Adrian in Rome, requesting protection from [[Sweyn III of Denmark|King Swein of Denmark]].{{refn|Swein was also a vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=350}}|group=note}} Adrian both appointed the [[Bishop of Lund]] his Legate in the region{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=350}} and recognised him as [[primate]] over both Sweden and Denmark.{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=203}}{{refn|Eventually the three provinces agreed on Uppsala as the centre of the proposed metropolitan, and Alexander III conferred it in 1164.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}}|group=note}} \n\nOther cardinalate appointments of Adrian's included that of Alberto di Morra in 1156. Di Mora, also a canon regular like Adrian, later reigned briefly as [[Pope Gregory VIII]] in 1187. Boso, already papal chamberlain since 1154, was appointed the same year. Adrian also elevated one Walter to the Pope's own Cardinal Bishopric of Albino; Walter is thought to have been an Englishman\u2014possible also from St Ruf\u2014but very little record of his career has survived. In contrast, his appointment of Raymond des Ar\u00e9nes in 1158 was of a well-known lawyer with an established career under Adrian's predecessors.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|pp=182\u2013183}} These were all worthy additions to the Curial office, argues Duggan, being all men of \"experience, academic learning and administrative and diplomatic skill\", which in turn reflects the wisdom of the appointer.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=183}} He may have received the hermit and later saint [[Silvester of Troina]], whose only recorded journey was from Siciliy to Rome during Adrian's pontificate.{{sfn|Oldfield|2014|p=131}}\n\nAdrian continued the reform of the Papacy's finances that had begun under his predecessor in an attempt at boosting revenue,{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=238}}{{refn|This process involved Boso, as Chamberlain examining old rent books from the archives in the hope of discovering lost Papal dues,{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=238}} and Adrian also ordered the keeping of more precise fiscal records,{{sfn|Whalen|2014|p=125}} which became the nucleus of the ''[[Liber Censuum]]''.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=182}}|group=note}} although he regularly had to resort to requesting large loans from major noble families such as the Corsi and [[Frangipane]].{{sfn|Wickham|2015|pp=164, 165 n.170}}{{refn|For example, a loan from Pietro Frangipane in 1158 of 1,000 [[Mark (currency)|marks]], for which a number of Papal castles had been given as security, was not paid off until 1190.{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=228}}|group=note}} His appointment of Boso as Chamberlain\u2014or ''camerius''\u2014of the Papal patrimony did much to improve the Papacy's finances by way of streamlining its financial bureaucracy.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2004|p=23}} However, he also recognised the expense that the Papay was put to defending its own, commenting ''nemo potest sine stipendiis militare'', or \"no-one can make war without pay\".{{sfn|Morris|1989|p=214}} Adrian also consolidated the Papacy's position as the feudal lord of the regional baronage;{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=54}} indeed, his success n doing so has been described as \"never less than impressive\".{{sfn|Bolton|2003a|p=178}} In 1157, for example, Adrian made [[Oddone Frangipane]] donate his castle to him, which Adrian then granted back to Oddone in fee.{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=54}}{{refn|Wickhma argues this was Papal policy: \"aristocrats in Rome had to resign themselves to having possession of their lands, not full property\".{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=54}}|group=note}} occasionally Adrian simply purchased castles and lordships for the papacy, as he did [[Corchiano]].{{sfn|Partner|1972|p=194}} Adrian received the personal oaths of fealty of a number of north-Roman nobles, thus making them vassals of St Peter.{{sfn|Whalen|2014|p=125}} In 1158, for example, for fighting in the ''[[Reconquista]]''\u2014\"subduing the barbarous peoples and the savage nations, that is, the fury of the Saracens\"\u2014Ramon Berenguer, Count of Barcelona was accepted \"under St Peter's and our protection\".{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=348}} In 1159 Adrian ratified an agreement with the civic leadership of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]]\u2014an otherwise semi-independent town\u2014agreed to pay the Pope an annual feudal rent for his lordship.{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=106}} Adrian's vassals, and their family and vassals, took oaths of fealty to the Pope, and in doing so the vassal absolved his own vassals of their oaths to him. All now became direct vassals of the Papacy.{{sfn|Bolton|2003b|pp=178\u2013179}} One of Adrian's greatest achievements, believed Boso, was acquiring [[Orvieto]] as a Papal fief, because this city had \"for a very long time withdrawn itself from the jurisdiction of St Peter\"{{sfn|Bolton|Duggan|2003|pp=230\u2013231}}{{sfn|Partner|1972|p=194}} Adrian, in 1156, was the first Pope to enter Orvieto, emphasised Boso, and to \"have any temporal power there\".{{sfn|Partner|1972|p=194}}\n\nAdrian appears to have been an advocate of the [[crusade]] since his abbacy of St Ruf,{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=32}} and was equally keen to rekindle the crusading spirit among Christian rulers as Pope. The [[Second Crusade|most recent crusade]] had ended, poorly, in 1150, but Adrian made what has been called a \"novel approach\" to launching a new one. In 1157 he announced that, whereas previously [[indulgence]]s were available to those who fought in the East, from now on they would be also available to those who supported the war effort without necessarily campaigning abroad. This opened the benefits of crusading up to those who supplied money, men or [[materiel]]. However, his proposal, novel or otherwise, appears to have met with little interest, and no further crusading was to take place until 1189.{{sfn|Freed|2016|pp=472\u2013473}}{{sfn|Tyerman|1998|pp=14\u201315}} He did not, however, approve of Crusading within Christendom itself, as when the French and English kings both proposed a crusade into [[Muslim Spain]], he urged cation upon them. In his January 1159{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=39}} letter ''Satis laudabiliter'', while flattering both kings diplomatically, he advised that \"it would seem to be neither wise nor safe to enter a foreign land without first seeking the advice of the princes and people of the area\".{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=191}} Indeed, Adrian reminded Henry and Louis of the consequences of badly planned and mismanaged crusades by reference to the Second Crusade\u2014of which Louis had been a leader\u2014reminding him that, there too, Louis had invaded \"without consulting the people of the area\".{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=192}}{{refn|He did however defer rather than deny the request for a crusade, as he intimated that, if his conditions were met\u2014i.e. that western princes were invited to do so\u2014he would then countenance their crusade.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=192}}|group=note}} \n\nAdrian also undertook a building program throughout Rome and the patrimony, although Duggan notes that the shortness of his pontificate reduced the amount of his work that remains visible in the 21st century. The work ranged from the restoration of public buildings and spaces to the city's physical defence.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=201}} Boso reported how, for example, \"in the church of St Peter [Adrian] richly restored the roof of St. Processo which he found collapsed\", while in the Lateran, he \"he caused to be made a very necessary and extremely large cistern\".{{sfn|Bolton|Duggan|2003|pp=230\u2013231}} Due to the peripatetic nature of his pontificate he also built a large number of summer palaces across the patrimony, including at [[Segni]], Ferentino, [[Alatri]], [[Anagni]] and [[Rieti]].{{sfn|Bolton|2003b|p=166}} Much of this fortification and building work\u2014particularly in the vicinity of Rome\u2014was for the protection of pilgrims, the safety of whom Adrian was both spiritually and physically reliable for.{{sfn|Partner|1972|pp=193\u2013194}}\n\nAlthough his pontificate was a relatively short one\u2014four years, six months and 28 days\u2014he spent nearly half that time outside of Rome, either in the enclave of Benevento or journeying around the Papal States and patrimony. Particularly in the early years of the reign, his travels reflected the political context, consisting of \"short bursts\" as he sought to either meet or avoid the Emperor or William of Sicily as the situation required.{{sfn|Bolton|2003b|p=164}}\n\n==Personal philosophy and religious views==\n[[File:Ego adrianus Catholicae.png|thumb|The [[autograph]] of Pope Adrian IV, reading ''Ego Adrianus Catholicae''{{sfn|Charter|2020}}|alt=image of Pope Adrian's signature]]\nThe Pope was conscious, comments Sayers, \"of the crushing responsibilities\" of his office,{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} telling John of Salisbury that he felt his Papal tiara to be \"splendid because it burned with fire\".{{sfn|Curtin|2019|p=23}} He was also highly conscious of the historicity of the Petrine tradition; as much as any of his predecessors, says Duggan, Adrian upheld the \"unifying and an co-ordinating role of the Papal office\", and regularly expressed himself on how he viewed his position as that akin to being a steward:{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=196}} He also recognised his own smallness within that tradition, telling John of Salisbury that \"the Lord has long since placed me between the hammer and the anvil, and now he must support the burden he has placed upon me, for I cannot carry it\".{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=197}} This explains his use of the [[Pope#Title|epithet]] ''[[Servus servorum Dei]]'', comments Duggan: more than purely rhetorical, it amalgamated his concept of \"stewardship, duty and usefulness\" in three words.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=197}}\n\n{{blockquote|text=Having been placed by the Lord's disposition in a lofty watchtower, if the rights of all churches are not preserved whole and unimpaired, we would seem to occupy the place of St Peter Prince of the Apostles unprofitably and to exercise the office of stewardship entrusted to us negligently.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=196}}}}\n \nAdrian was keen to emphasise the superiority of the Western Church over that of the East, and lost no opportunity to tell members of that body so.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} \nAdrian described his approach to relations with his political rivals in a letter to the [[Metropolis of Thessaloniki#List of bishops|Archbishop of Thessaloniki]]. St Peter's authority was indivisible and could not be shared with temporal rulers, he argued. As such\u2014as [[Petrine doctrine|the descendent of St Peter]]\u2014neither should he.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} Central to Adrian's view of his Papacy, says Sayers, was the conviction that his court was the highest court in Christendom and, so, the final court of appeal, and he encouraged appeals from many countries.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} In an early letter, defending the principle of Papal Monarchy, he compares [[Christendom]] to the human body: all the parts can only function as they should if they have an overarching guide and facilitator. To Adrian, Christian Europe was the body, and the Pope the head.{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=236}} The historian Neil Hegarty has suggested that, on the assumption that ''Laudabiliter'' as is extant can be believed, Adrian firmly believed in \"enlarging the borders of the Church, setting bounds to the progress of wickedness, reforming evil manners, planting virtue, and increasing the Christian religion\".{{sfn|Hegarty|2011|p=60}} Adrian was keen to know what people thought of the Roman Church, and often asked the question of [[John of Salisbury]].{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} John also recorded Adrian's view's on the Papacy accepting gifts from Christians, which some viewed as [[Simony|simonaical]] and evidence of corruption. Adrian, reported John, replied with reference to the [[The Belly and the Members|fable of the belly]]. The European analyst Andreas Musolff explains the Pope's position as \"deducing from it the church\u2019s right to receive, and allocate, the nourishment to the Christian body according to merit and utility\".{{sfn|Musolff|2004|p=59}}  \n\nAdrian, argues Ullmann, was a man of action with little \"inclination towards lengthy theoretical discussions\",{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=234}} although Norwich argues that he could still be hesitant. For instance, following his radical change of Papal policy at Benevento, he may still not have grasped the significance of what he had done, and certainly not to the extent of radically exploiting the new policy.{{sfn|Norwich|1970|p=186}} Partner suggests that Adrian was \"an able administrator who used able agents\".{{sfn|Partner|1972|p=192}} He was also a traditionalist;{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=234}} a firm follower of Pope Gregory VII, Adrian believed it his duty to not just believe in those ideals, but to enforce them. He also believed in the necessity of reform,{{sfn|Richter|1974|p=206}} as his clarification of the marriage sacrament and enforcement of free episcopal elections demonstrates.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=191}} He was also, like Eugenius had been before him, a firm believer in the supremacy of the Bishops of Rome over both the Empire and other churches, writing how the Papacy,{{sfn|Robinson|2004|pp=323, 325}}{{blockquote|text=Like a diligent mother provides for the individual churches with constant vigilance: all must have recourse to her, as to their head and origin, to be defended by her authority, to be nourished by her breasts and freed of their oppressions.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=325}}}}\n\n===Writings===\nThe 16th century [[jesuit]] commentator [[Augustino Oldoini]], in his re-edition of [[Alphonsus Ciacconius]]' ''Papal History'', that Adrian had authored a number of works prior to his election.

Adrian brought Rome brought back under firm Papal control{{sfn|Wickham|2015|pp=39, 51}}\u2014with considerable success, argues Wickham,{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=419}} and also expanded the Papal estate around the city, particularly in the northern [[Lazio]] region.{{sfn|Wickham|2015|pp=39, 51}} \n\nAlthough his Papacy was shorter than either Eugenius III or Alexander III he bought more castles and lordships within papal jurisdiction than either of them, and in a more onerous political context.{{sfn|Bolton|2003b|p=178}} He was also a tougher Pope than his two immediate predecessors, says Wickham{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=445}} and his was an \"extremely formative\" Papacy, says Sayers, and his policy of reform was a legacy taken up again by reforming popes of the 13th century.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} His Papacy though, suggests Eden, was \"fraught with political intrigue and conflict\".{{sfn|Eden|2006|p=293}} Adrian has been described as having \"theocratic pretensions\",{{sfn|Pixton|2001|p=727}} although it was also during his pontificate that the term \"Vicar of Christ\" became a common synonym for the Pope.{{sfn|McBrien|1997}}\n\nHenry Summerson suggests that on his death, Adrian \"left a high reputation\", and quotes the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' in saying that he also became \"something of a role model for later popes\".{{sfn|Summerson|2004}} The scholar Michael Frassetto suggests that blame for the poor relations between Pope and Emperor can be placed as much upon their advisors\u2014Roland and Reinald specifically\u2014who both \"stressed principle over compromise\".{{sfn|Frassetto|2001|p=296}} Summerson also notes that although England provided no subsequent Popes, relations between that country and the Papacy remained strong after Adrian's death and into the 13th century.{{refn|Culminating, suggest Summerson, after [[John of England|King John]] made the country a Papal fief in 1215.{{sfn|Summerson|2004}}|group=note}} Adrian's generous treatment of St Albans also had repercussions. He had granted it privileges of such breadth and grandeur\u2014which were confirmed by his successors\u2014that they caused rancour and jealousy in the English church.{{sfn|Bolton|2003a|p=95}}\n\nUllman suggests that it was Adrian who began the restoration of the [[Papal monarchy]] that would reach its apotheosis under Innocent III,{{sfn|Ullmann|2003|p=122}} while Bolton argues that \"only Innocent, the great Roman, realised the value to the papacy of following where Adrian, the unique Englishman, had led\".{{sfn|Bolton|2003b|p=178}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of popes]]\n*[[Cardinals created by Adrian IV]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|45em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book|last=Abulafia|first=D.|title=Frederrick II: A Medieval Emperor|year=1988|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19508-040-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=And\u00e5s|first1=M.

L. Poole speculates that Adrian may have been born many years later, as he was sent on a lengthy trip to Scandinavia in 1152, and, says Poole, \"so onerous a task would hardly have been imposed on a man past middle age\"{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=295}}|group=note}}{{snd}}1 September 1159, also '''Hadrian IV'''),{{sfn|Parry|1997|p=18}} was [[Pope]] from 4 December 1154 to his death in 1159. Born in [[Hertfordshire]], England, his father may have been a [[clerk]] and a [[monk]] called Robert, but his mother is unknown, and he may have been illegitimate. Although he does not appear to have received a great degree of schooling, while still a youth he travelled to France where he was schooled in [[Arles]], studying law. He then travelled to [[Avignon]], in the south, where he joined the abbey of [[St Ruf]]. There he became a [[Canons regular|canon regular]] and was eventually appointed abbot. He travelled to [[Rome]] several times, where he appears to have caught the attention of [[Pope Eugenius III]]. Eugenius sent him on a mission to [[Catalonia]], where the [[Reconquista]] was attempting to reclaim land from the Muslim [[Al-Andalus]]. Around this time his abbey complained to Eugenius that Breakspear was too heavy a [[disciplinarian]], and in order to make use of him as a [[papal legate]] as well as to pacify his monks, the Pope appointed Breakspear [[Bishop of Albano]] some time around 1149.\n\nAs Bishop, Breakspear was soon sent on another diplomatic mission, this time to [[Scandinavia]]. In the middle of [[Civil war era in Norway|a civil war]], Breakspear reorganised the church in Norway and then moved on to Sweden. Here he was very much accclamed by the people, and when he left, [[Chronicle|chroniclers]] called him a saint. Breakspear returned to Rome in 1154; the Pope had died only a few weeks previously. For reasons now unknown, but possibly at his predecessor's request, Breakspear was elected next Pope by the cardinals. He took the name Adrian IV. He was unable to complete his coronation service, however, because of the parlous state of politics in Rome, which at the time was a den of [[heresy]] and [[republicanism]]. Adrian decisively restored the papal authority there, but his other major policy issue\u2014relations with the newly-crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I\u2014]]<nowiki/>started off badly and got progressively worse. Each party, as a result of a particular aggravating incident, found something to condemn the other for. As a result, Adrian entered into an alliance with the [[Byzantine emperor]], [[Manuel I Komnenos]] who was keen to re-assert his authority in the south of Italy, but was unable to do so due to the [[Norman Kingdom of Sicily|Norman Kings]]' occupation of the region, now under [[William I of Sicily]].\n\nAdrian's alliance with the Byzantie emperor came to nothing, as William decisively defeated Manuel and forced Adrian to come to terms at the [[Treaty of Benevento]]. This alienated Emperor Frederick even more, as he saw it as a repudiation of [[Treaty of Constance (1153)|their existing treaty]]. Relations souted further when Frederick laid claim to a large swathe of territory in northern Italy. Adrian's elations with his country of birth, however, seem to have remained generally good. Certainly he showered [[St Albans Abbey]] with privileges, and he appears to have forwarded [[Henry II of England|King Henry II's]] policies where he could. Most famously, in 1158 Adrian is supposed to have granted Henry the [[papal bull]] ''[[Laudabiliter]]'', which is thought to have authorised Henry to invade Ireland. Henry did not do so, however, for another 14 years, and scholars are uncertain whether the bull ever existed.\n\nFollowing Adrian's death at [[Anagni]], there was uncertainty as to who to succeed him, with both pro- and anti-imperial cardinals voting for different candidates. Although officially [[Pope Alexander III]] officially took over, the concomitant election of an [[Antipope]] led to a 22-year-long schism. Scholars have debated Adrian's pontificate widely. Much of a positive nature\u2014his building program and reorganisation of papal finances, for example\u2014has been identified, particularly in the context of such a short reign. He was also up against powerful forces out of his control, which, while he never overcame them, he managed effectively.\n\n==Early life==\nThe son of Richard Breakspear,{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} his family was a relatively humble one.{{sfn|Summerson|2004}} The exact year of his birth is unknown but he was probably around 55 years old on his election.{{sfn|Norwich|2011}} Little is known{{refn|The only reliable source closest to his own life is that by Cardinal Boso in the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', but, comments Brooke, \"this is exceedingly terse on his early life\", noting only his nationality and voyage to France for learning.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=4}}|group=note}} of his background, and that which is, comments Brooke, \"savour[s] of gossip rather than sober history.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=4}} He was probably born in or around the Hertfordshire town of [[St Albans]]. As a result, much of that that is thought to be known may well be mythological \"tradition woven at the great abbey\" there.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} Much of what is known is brought to historians by the writings of [[Boso (Cardinal)|Cardinal Boso]] and [[William of Newburgh]], both of whom were, however, writing over 30 years after Breakspear's death.{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=291}} As a result, notes Poole, there is a dearth of information\u2014and especially dates\u2014for Breakspear's life until his election as Pope, and \"all that can be said is that the dates commonly given are in every instance wrong\".{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=293}} The contemporary English [[chronicle]]r [[Matthew Paris]] says he came from [[Abbots Langley]],{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|1997|p=97}} although Paris mistakenly ascribes to his father the name [[Robert de Camera]].{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=5}} Robert may have been a clerk{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|1997|p=97}}{{refn|Christopher Brooke also surmises that, with a surname such as \"Camera\", he was likely to have been a clerk.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=6}}|group=note}} although Sayers suggests that Paris' claim that Robert was a priest is probably correct, as is the likelihood that he later became a monk.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}}{{refn|Richard may have been a married priest, as, during his son's later struggle with the Holy Roman Emperor, the latter asserted it was the case as a slur.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} This was not unusual in the 12th-century church. The historian [[Anne Llewellyn Barstow]] says: \"Despite six hundred years of decrees, canons, and increasingly harsh penalties, the Latin clergy still...lived with their wives and raised families.

This was, he notes, a normal path to preferment in the 12th century, although it was more unusual for those that did so to have Breakspear's inauspicious background.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=19}} He may have become a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] at the [[Augustinian priory]] in [[Merton, Surrey]].{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} Poole subscribes to this theory, citing a letter to Breakspear when Pope in which he is reminded that \"your worship was wont to speak\" of Merton in conversation.{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=293}}\n\n===Move to France and promotion===\n[[File:St Alban&#039;s cathedral - geograph.org.uk - 1344.jpg|thumb|St Albans Abbey, now a Cathedral, seen in 2005|alt=Colour photograph of St Albans Abbey, now a cathedral|left]]\nThe next point at which Breakspear can be positively identified is in the French town of [[Arles]], where he continued his studies{{sfn|Parry|1997|p=18}} in [[canon law]],{{sfn|Duggan|2004|p=189 n.80}} and probably under the masters of Roman law also.{{sfn|Egger|2003|p=20}} On completion of his studies, he travelled south and became a [[canon regular]] at the priory of [[St Ruf]],{{refn|Also called St Rufus,{{sfn|Parry|1997|p=18}} this was an important regional [[motherhouse]].{{sfn|Zinn|1995|p=1481}}{{sfn|Morris|1989|p=190}}|group=note}} [[Avignon]].

The chapter was requested, says Egger, to \"help them in every possible way to conduct their business\".{{sfn|Egger|2003|p=27}}\n\nPoole questions the reasoning for Breakspear's episcopal promotion. Not only was his abbey an obscure one, with no political value or great endowment, but Breakspear's reasons for attending the Papal court were unlikely to have enabled him to make a name for himself. Indeed, on at least one occasion it was in response to a summons concerning his behaviour. However, suggest Poole, a possible explanation may have its roots in Breakspear's residency at Merton.{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=295}}{{refn|Poole suggests that in the early-to-mid-portion of the 12th century, Merton was much favoured by [[Roman Catholic Diocese of S\u00e9ez#Bishops|John, Bishop of S\u00e9ez]], and it had been Bishop John who had appointed Robert Pullen to the [[Archdeacon of Rochester#High Medieval|Archdeaconry of Rochester]]; by 1149, Pullen was Papal Chancellor and, Poole suggests, listened favourably to the recommendation of S\u00e9ez regarding Breakspeare, particularly as he was a fellow countryman.{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=295}}|group=note}} Duggan notes that the Cardinal Bishopric of Albino was part of the Pope's inner circle, which she suggests makes his rapid elevation to such a sensitive position all the more remarkable and indicative of the now-unrecognisable qualities that Eugenius saw in him.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=201}}\n\n===Voyage to Catalonia===\nIt was probably at the Council of Reims that Eugenius selected Breakspear for a mission to Catalonia,{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=33}}{{refn|The scholar Damian Smith notes a pre-existing connection between Breakspear and the region through his predecessor at St Ruf, Olegarius, abbot between 1113 and 1118,{{sfn|McCrank|1978|pp=162, nn.15+17}} and who had then been unwillingly promoted to the [[Bishopric of Barcelona]] and subsequently the [[Archbishopric of Tarragona]].

Although no records exist to show Breakspear was involved in the campaign itself, he was heavily involved in the reorganisation and administration of the [[Cistercian Order]], as well as arbitrating disputes within its congregation.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=35}} It is likely that he was present at the [[Lleida|Siege of Lleida]] during the summer of 1149. He is less likely to have still been there in October, when it fell, as e had returned to Rome by December. However, he may well have brought news of another successful siege\u2014that of [[Tortosa]]\u2014which would have been particularly welcome to the \"bruised and battered\" papacy of Eugenius, says Damian Smith.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=36}} Smith also notes that Breakspear's lengthy absence from St Ruf may have been a source of complaint by his monks, \"but this was surely not of prime importance to the Pope\".{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=36}} Egger suggests, however, that Breakspear's Catalonian mission was of great benefit to St Ruf, which became the blueprint for the religious houses created by Berenguer in the wake of the retreating Muslim empire.{{sfn|Egger|2003|p=25}}{{refn|St Ruf's observances, suggests Egger, became popular with the Catalonian nobility as well as the church, so was \"of no small advantage to the order\".{{sfn|Egger|2003|p=25}}|group=note}}\n\nAround mid-1152, he was despatched to [[Scandinavia]] as [[Papal legate]].{{sfn|Sayers|2004}}\n\n===Visit to Scandinavia, 1152===\n[[File:Trondheim-cathedral-1.jpg|thumb|upright=|Trondheim Cathedral, as seen in 2005|alt=modern photo of Trondheim Cathedral]]\nFormer [[Canon residentiary]] of St Albans Abbey, Andes Bergquist has described Breakspear's journey to northern Europe as \"one of the better documented\" of his career.

Breakspear reconciled the warring factions\u2014albeit temporarily\u2014and restored the monarchy.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} although no official record of his instructions survives, Bergquist suggests that they can be inferred from his actions: to divide the existing Archbishopric of Lund\u2014which covered both Norway and Sweden\u2013into two distinct national metropolitans, to arrange payment of Peter's Pence and to generally reorganise the church along Italian and European lines.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=42}}\n\nBreakspear may have travelled to Norway via France and England{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=43}}\u2014where, Sayers speculates, he could have recruited merchant contacts who knew the region.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}}{{sfn|And\u00e5s|Ekroll|Haug|Petersen|2007|p=9}} His mission may have been kept quiet, as Bergquist notes his arrival seems t have been unexpected: Archbishop Eskil of Lund had recently left to visit France, and the King of Norway was on a military campaign.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=44}} His first stop was Norway. At some point, Breakspear presided over a council at [[Nidaros]]. This council, says Robinson, \"strengthened the economic position of the church and the social status of the clergy\".{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} Its timing though is difficult to ascertain, says Bergquist: Autumn 1152 seems to allow too little time to organise such a major council following his arrival, yet much later and the depth of a Norwegian winter is even more unlikely.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nThe focal point of the [[Olaf II of Norway#Liturgical cult|cult of St Olaf]],{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} Nidaros had until that point been only an episcopate.{{sfn|And\u00e5s|Ekroll|Haug|Petersen|2007|p=9}} Adrian's council was intended to promulgate [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canons]].{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} To this end Breakspear made Nidaros a geographically-extensive ecclesiastical [[province]], covering the whole of Norway, Iceland and Greenland, as well as the [[Faroe Islands|Faroe]], [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland Island]]s. Breakspear also authorised the expansion of what was to become Europe's [[Trondheim Cathedral|most northerly medieval cathedral]], and its largest.{{sfn|And\u00e5s|Ekroll|Haug|Petersen|2007|p=9}} While in Norway he founded three [[cathedral schools]], at Nidaros in 1152 and two more at [[Bergen]] and [[Hamar]] the following year.{{sfn|Sj\u00e5vik|2008|p=63}} His work in Norway earned him the praise of contemporary Norwegian writer and politician, [[Snorri Sturluson]].{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=200}}\n\nIf the Council of Nidaros was held in the early months of 1143, suggests Bergquist, then it appears that Breakspear sailed to Sweden as soon as it was concluded.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=44}} His activities in Sweden followed a similar course to those in Norway.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=46}} He called another council, this time at [[Link\u00f6ping]], which reorganised the Swedish church under the [[Archbishop of Lund]] (it had previously been subject to German patriarchy).{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} He also received permission from the [[Swedish monarchy]] to introduce [[Peter's pence]]{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} and to reduce the influence of the lay community on the church generally.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=46}} His visit to Sweden was recorded by contemporary chroniclers and published in the 13th century.{{sfn|Phelpstead|2001|p=xxxiv}} Similarly to what he had done in Norway with Trondheim,{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} Adrian attempted to create an archepiscopal see for Sweden. This was opposed by one of the three provinces, [[Gothland]], and the venture came to nothing.{{sfn|Eden|2006|pp=292\u2013293}} According to Bergquist, Breakspear \"\"was taken aback by this unseemly conflict, and declared that neither people deserved this highest ecclesiastical honour\".{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=46}} Indeed, he suggests that it is possible that Breakspear's plans fell through thanks to the machinations of the recently-returned Archbishop Eskil. Eskil, having discovered that he had lost half his archepiscopate in his absence, may have stirred up the Swedes' and Goths' rivalries to ensure against losing any more. In the event, Breakspear appears to have repaired relations with Eskil, assuring him that Eskil would receive far more than he had lost. As a result, he placed Eskil in charge of the new Swedish metropolitan.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=46}} \n\nDuggan describes Adrian's legation in the north has a \"diplomatic triumph\",{{sfn|Duggan|2003a|p=153}} being so successful, says Sayers, \"that he was later seen as the apostle of Scandinavia\".{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} Boso later lauded how Breakspear brought \"peace to the kingdoms, law to the barbarians, tranquillity to the monasteries, order to the churches, discipline to the clergy and a people pleasing to God, devoted to good works\".{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} He successfully introduced a new Scandinavian [[tythe]]\u2014the ''denarium sancti Petri'', or payment to St Peter\u2014a financial acknowledgement by the Scandinavian church of Papal primacy.{{sfn|Sheehy|1961|pp=48\u201349}} Breakspear, argues the scholar Andrew Beck, \"gave the Swedish church its hierarchy and its attachment to Rome\".{{sfn|Beck|1940|p=383}}{{refn|Breakspear was one of two English clerics who influenced Scandinavian Christianity at this time; the other was [[Henry (bishop of Finland)|Henry, Bishop of Uppsala]], who was originally from St Albans.{{sfn|Singleton|1998|p=18}}|group=note}} He left Scandinavia in autumn 1154; he seems to have left a generally good impression in the region: A later [[Kings' sagas|saga]] refers to Breaksperare as \"the good cardinal...now considered a saint\".{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=41}} On his return to Rome he found Pope Eugenius had died the previous year, and that his successor had followed him only a few weeks before; the [[College of Cardinals]] was seeking a successor.{{sfn|Bergquist|2003|p=41}}\n\n==Political background==\n[[File:Plan of Rome in the Middle Ages - Historical Atlas by William R.

Adrian's reasoning was that a [[sacrement]] outweighed a feudal due and that no Christian had the right to stand in the way of another's receiving of a sacrament. This was to become the definitive statement of marriage as a sacrament,{{sfn|Reynolds|2016|pp=40, 451}} and remained such until the recodification of [[1917 Code of Canon Law|Canon Law in 1917]].{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=190}} The same year, Adrian consecrated the [[Bishop of Gradisca|Bishop of Grado]], [[Enrico Dandolo (patriarch)|Enrico Dandolo]] as [[Dalmatia|Primate of Dalmatia]].{{sfn|Madden|2007|p=36}} Two years later, Adrian granted him primacy over all the Venetian churches in the Eastern Empire.{{sfn|Madden|2018|p=63}} This has been described as \"a remarkable move\": The historian [[Thomas F. Madden]] notes that not only did was this the first occasion on which one metropolitan had been given jurisdiction over another, but in doing so Adrian had created the equivalent of an Eastern [[Patriarch]] in the west.{{sfn|Madden|2012|p=80}} He also confirmed the degradation of [[Baume Abbey]] imposed by Eugenius for its failure to obey a Papal legate.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=325 n.48}}\n\nAdrian confirmed the prerogatives of the [[Knights Templar]] and documented in the ''[[Liber Censuum]]''.{{sfn|Bellomo|2008|p=268}} He also enforced the rules against unfree ecclesiastical elections and condemned ecclesiastics who used physical force against the church.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=191}} Perhaps reflecting his earlier career, he also promulgated several bulls in favour of the [[Austin canon]]s. Again, he particularly focussed on houses of his personal association; St Ruf, for example, received at least 10 bulls of privilege. In one of these, he expressed a \"special bond of affection\" for his old abbey, which he said had been like a mother to him.{{sfn|Egger|2003|p=27}}\n\nAdrian argued that, in the troubled succession to [[Alfonso the Battler|Alfonso I of Aragon]], even though Alfonso had legally nominated an heir\u2014his brother\u2014because he had not had a son, his brother was not a direct heir to the Kingdom.{{sfn|Martindale|1989|p=27}} This was the context for the projected crusade into Spain as suggested by the Kings of England and France, which Adrian rejected. He did, however, welcome their new friendship.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=39}}\n\nIt was probably Adrian who [[canonised]] [[Sigfrid of Sweden]] around 1158, thus making Sigfrid Sweden's [[apostle]].{{sfn|Beck|1940|p=384}} Robinson notes that Adrian's fascination with Scandinavia continued into his pontificate, particularly in his efforts to create a Swedish metropolis. He was also keen to defend its church against lay encroachment.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} In January 1157 Archbishop Eskil{{refn|Eskil was a personal friend of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] and had been responsible for originally introducing [[monasticism]] to Denmark and Sweden.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=350}}|group=note}} personally presented a petition to Adrian in Rome, requesting protection from [[Sweyn III of Denmark|King Swein of Denmark]].{{refn|Swein was also a vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=350}}|group=note}} Adrian both appointed the [[Bishop of Lund]] his Legate in the region{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=350}} and recognised him as [[primate]] over both Sweden and Denmark.{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=203}}{{refn|Eventually the three provinces agreed on Uppsala as the centre of the proposed metropolitan, and Alexander III conferred it in 1164.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}}|group=note}} \n\nOther cardinalate appointments of Adrian's included that of Alberto di Morra in 1156. Di Mora, also a canon regular like Adrian, later reigned briefly as [[Pope Gregory VIII]] in 1187. Boso, already papal chamberlain since 1154, was appointed the same year. Adrian also elevated one Walter to the Pope's own Cardinal Bishopric of Albino; Walter is thought to have been an Englishman\u2014possible also from St Ruf\u2014but very little record of his career has survived. In contrast, his appointment of Raymond des Ar\u00e9nes in 1158 was of a well-known lawyer with an established career under Adrian's predecessors.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|pp=182\u2013183}} These were all worthy additions to the Curial office, argues Duggan, being all men of \"experience, academic learning and administrative and diplomatic skill\", which in turn reflects the wisdom of the appointer.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=183}} He may have received the hermit and later saint [[Silvester of Troina]], whose only recorded journey was from Siciliy to Rome during Adrian's pontificate.{{sfn|Oldfield|2014|p=131}}\n\nAdrian continued the reform of the Papacy's finances that had begun under his predecessor in an attempt at boosting revenue,{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=238}}{{refn|This process involved Boso, as Chamberlain examining old rent books from the archives in the hope of discovering lost Papal dues,{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=238}} and Adrian also ordered the keeping of more precise fiscal records,{{sfn|Whalen|2014|p=125}} which became the nucleus of the ''[[Liber Censuum]]''.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=182}}|group=note}} although he regularly had to resort to requesting large loans from major noble families such as the Corsi and [[Frangipane]].{{sfn|Wickham|2015|pp=164, 165 n.170}}{{refn|For example, a loan from Pietro Frangipane in 1158 of 1,000 [[Mark (currency)|marks]], for which a number of Papal castles had been given as security, was not paid off until 1190.{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=228}}|group=note}} His appointment of Boso as Chamberlain\u2014or ''camerius''\u2014of the Papal patrimony did much to improve the Papacy's finances by way of streamlining its financial bureaucracy.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2004|p=23}} However, he also recognised the expense that the Papay was put to defending its own, commenting ''nemo potest sine stipendiis militare'', or \"no-one can make war without pay\".{{sfn|Morris|1989|p=214}} Adrian also consolidated the Papacy's position as the feudal lord of the regional baronage;{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=54}} indeed, his success n doing so has been described as \"never less than impressive\".{{sfn|Bolton|2003a|p=178}} In 1157, for example, Adrian made [[Oddone Frangipane]] donate his castle to him, which Adrian then granted back to Oddone in fee.{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=54}}{{refn|Wickhma argues this was Papal policy: \"aristocrats in Rome had to resign themselves to having possession of their lands, not full property\".{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=54}}|group=note}} occasionally Adrian simply purchased castles and lordships for the papacy, as he did [[Corchiano]].{{sfn|Partner|1972|p=194}} Adrian received the personal oaths of fealty of a number of north-Roman nobles, thus making them vassals of St Peter.{{sfn|Whalen|2014|p=125}} In 1158, for example, for fighting in the ''[[Reconquista]]''\u2014\"subduing the barbarous peoples and the savage nations, that is, the fury of the Saracens\"\u2014Ramon Berenguer, Count of Barcelona was accepted \"under St Peter's and our protection\".{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=348}} In 1159 Adrian ratified an agreement with the civic leadership of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]]\u2014an otherwise semi-independent town\u2014agreed to pay the Pope an annual feudal rent for his lordship.{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=106}} Adrian's vassals, and their family and vassals, took oaths of fealty to the Pope, and in doing so the vassal absolved his own vassals of their oaths to him. All now became direct vassals of the Papacy.{{sfn|Bolton|2003b|pp=178\u2013179}} One of Adrian's greatest achievements, believed Boso, was acquiring [[Orvieto]] as a Papal fief, because this city had \"for a very long time withdrawn itself from the jurisdiction of St Peter\"{{sfn|Bolton|Duggan|2003|pp=230\u2013231}}{{sfn|Partner|1972|p=194}} Adrian, in 1156, was the first Pope to enter Orvieto, emphasised Boso, and to \"have any temporal power there\".{{sfn|Partner|1972|p=194}}\n\nAdrian appears to have been an advocate of the [[crusade]] since his abbacy of St Ruf,{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=32}} and was equally keen to rekindle the crusading spirit among Christian rulers as Pope. The [[Second Crusade|most recent crusade]] had ended, poorly, in 1150, but Adrian made what has been called a \"novel approach\" to launching a new one. In 1157 he announced that, whereas previously [[indulgence]]s were available to those who fought in the East, from now on they would be also available to those who supported the war effort without necessarily campaigning abroad. This opened the benefits of crusading up to those who supplied money, men or [[materiel]]. However, his proposal, novel or otherwise, appears to have met with little interest, and no further crusading was to take place until 1189.{{sfn|Freed|2016|pp=472\u2013473}}{{sfn|Tyerman|1998|pp=14\u201315}} He did not, however, approve of Crusading within Christendom itself, as when the French and English kings both proposed a crusade into [[Muslim Spain]], he urged cation upon them. In his January 1159{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=39}} letter ''Satis laudabiliter'', while flattering both kings diplomatically, he advised that \"it would seem to be neither wise nor safe to enter a foreign land without first seeking the advice of the princes and people of the area\".{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=191}} Indeed, Adrian reminded Henry and Louis of the consequences of badly planned and mismanaged crusades by reference to the Second Crusade\u2014of which Louis had been a leader\u2014reminding him that, there too, Louis had invaded \"without consulting the people of the area\".{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=192}}{{refn|He did however defer rather than deny the request for a crusade, as he intimated that, if his conditions were met\u2014i.e. that western princes were invited to do so\u2014he would then countenance their crusade.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=192}}|group=note}} \n\nAdrian also undertook a building program throughout Rome and the patrimony, although Duggan notes that the shortness of his pontificate reduced the amount of his work that remains visible in the 21st century. The work ranged from the restoration of public buildings and spaces to the city's physical defence.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=201}} Boso reported how, for example, \"in the church of St Peter [Adrian] richly restored the roof of St. Processo which he found collapsed\", while in the Lateran, he \"he caused to be made a very necessary and extremely large cistern\".{{sfn|Bolton|Duggan|2003|pp=230\u2013231}} Due to the peripatetic nature of his pontificate he also built a large number of summer palaces across the patrimony, including at [[Segni]], Ferentino, [[Alatri]], [[Anagni]] and [[Rieti]].{{sfn|Bolton|2003b|p=166}} Much of this fortification and building work\u2014particularly in the vicinity of Rome\u2014was for the protection of pilgrims, the safety of whom Adrian was both spiritually and physically reliable for.{{sfn|Partner|1972|pp=193\u2013194}}\n\nAlthough his pontificate was a relatively short one\u2014four years, six months and 28 days\u2014he spent nearly half that time outside of Rome, either in the enclave of Benevento or journeying around the Papal States and patrimony. Particularly in the early years of the reign, his travels reflected the political context, consisting of \"short bursts\" as he sought to either meet or avoid the Emperor or William of Sicily as the situation required.{{sfn|Bolton|2003b|p=164}}\n\n==Personal philosophy and religious views==\n[[File:Ego adrianus Catholicae.png|thumb|The [[autograph]] of Pope Adrian IV, reading ''Ego Adrianus Catholicae''{{sfn|Charter|2020}}|alt=image of Pope Adrian's signature]]\nThe Pope was conscious, comments Sayers, \"of the crushing responsibilities\" of his office,{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} telling John of Salisbury that he felt his Papal tiara to be \"splendid because it burned with fire\".{{sfn|Curtin|2019|p=23}} He was also highly conscious of the historicity of the Petrine tradition; as much as any of his predecessors, says Duggan, Adrian upheld the \"unifying and an co-ordinating role of the Papal office\", and regularly expressed himself on how he viewed his position as that akin to being a steward:{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=196}} He also recognised his own smallness within that tradition, telling John of Salisbury that \"the Lord has long since placed me between the hammer and the anvil, and now he must support the burden he has placed upon me, for I cannot carry it\".{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=197}} This explains his use of the [[Pope#Title|epithet]] ''[[Servus servorum Dei]]'', comments Duggan: more than purely rhetorical, it amalgamated his concept of \"stewardship, duty and usefulness\" in three words.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=197}}\n\n{{blockquote|text=Having been placed by the Lord's disposition in a lofty watchtower, if the rights of all churches are not preserved whole and unimpaired, we would seem to occupy the place of St Peter Prince of the Apostles unprofitably and to exercise the office of stewardship entrusted to us negligently.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=196}}}}\n \nAdrian was keen to emphasise the superiority of the Western Church over that of the East, and lost no opportunity to tell members of that body so.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} \nAdrian described his approach to relations with his political rivals in a letter to the [[Metropolis of Thessaloniki#List of bishops|Archbishop of Thessaloniki]]. St Peter's authority was indivisible and could not be shared with temporal rulers, he argued. As such\u2014as [[Petrine doctrine|the descendent of St Peter]]\u2014neither should he.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} Central to Adrian's view of his Papacy, says Sayers, was the conviction that his court was the highest court in Christendom and, so, the final court of appeal, and he encouraged appeals from many countries.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} In an early letter, defending the principle of Papal Monarchy, he compares [[Christendom]] to the human body: all the parts can only function as they should if they have an overarching guide and facilitator. To Adrian, Christian Europe was the body, and the Pope the head.{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=236}} The historian Neil Hegarty has suggested that, on the assumption that ''Laudabiliter'' as is extant can be believed, Adrian firmly believed in \"enlarging the borders of the Church, setting bounds to the progress of wickedness, reforming evil manners, planting virtue, and increasing the Christian religion\".{{sfn|Hegarty|2011|p=60}} Adrian was keen to know what people thought of the Roman Church, and often asked the question of [[John of Salisbury]].{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} John also recorded Adrian's view's on the Papacy accepting gifts from Christians, which some viewed as [[Simony|simonaical]] and evidence of corruption. Adrian, reported John, replied with reference to the [[The Belly and the Members|fable of the belly]]. The European analyst Andreas Musolff explains the Pope's position as \"deducing from it the church\u2019s right to receive, and allocate, the nourishment to the Christian body according to merit and utility\".{{sfn|Musolff|2004|p=59}}  \n\nAdrian, argues Ullmann, was a man of action with little \"inclination towards lengthy theoretical discussions\",{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=234}} although Norwich argues that he could still be hesitant. For instance, following his radical change of Papal policy at Benevento, he may still not have grasped the significance of what he had done, and certainly not to the extent of radically exploiting the new policy.{{sfn|Norwich|1970|p=186}} Partner suggests that Adrian was \"an able administrator who used able agents\".{{sfn|Partner|1972|p=192}} He was also a traditionalist;{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=234}} a firm follower of Pope Gregory VII, Adrian believed it his duty to not just believe in those ideals, but to enforce them. He also believed in the necessity of reform,{{sfn|Richter|1974|p=206}} as his clarification of the marriage sacrament and enforcement of free episcopal elections demonstrates.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=191}} He was also, like Eugenius had been before him, a firm believer in the supremacy of the Bishops of Rome over both the Empire and other churches, writing how the Papacy,{{sfn|Robinson|2004|pp=323, 325}}{{blockquote|text=Like a diligent mother provides for the individual churches with constant vigilance: all must have recourse to her, as to their head and origin, to be defended by her authority, to be nourished by her breasts and freed of their oppressions.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=325}}}}\n\n===Writings===\nThe 16th century [[jesuit]] commentator [[Augustino Oldoini]], in his re-edition of [[Alphonsus Ciacconius]]' ''Papal History'', that Adrian had authored a number of works prior to his election.

One such letter, from Hildegarde, exhorts him to crush the Roman commune. Joseph Baird and Radd Ehrman, editors of a collection of Hildegard's letters, note that it was \"perhaps unneeded\", as Adrian placed the city under Interdict almost immediately.{{sfn|Baird|Ehrman|1994|pp=20, 44}}{{refn|This particular letter has been described as expressing \"ideas which are themselves highly abstruse...where either the imagery is so contorted as to be intelligible only to the recipient, if in fact even to him, or as to be deliberately indecipherable\", as it contains references to a large number of [[allegorical]] animals.{{sfn|Baird|Ehrman|1994|pp=20, 44}}|group=note}} Much of Adrian's correspondence with both Archbishop Theobald and John of Salisbury has also been published in collections of the latter's letters.{{sfn|Millor|Butler|1986|pp=ix\u2013xii}}{{refn|In an early letter, Theobald berates Adrian for sending a messenger who \"has either betrayed his trust out of malice or lost them [Theobald's letters] through negligence or has falsely pretended that they were lost\", and advises Adrian to \"speak to your messenger at your good pleasure and, if it please you, give him instructions to carry out your business with greater caution and fidelity\".{{sfn|Millor|Butler|1986|p=20}}|group=note}}\n\nAdrian's episcopal registry is now lost,{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=142}} although some decretals\u2014formal rulings\u2014survive.{{sfn|Morris|1989|p=402}}{{sfn|Heather|2014|p=401}}{{refn|This compares, however, to 713 from Alexander III's pontificate.{{sfn|Morris|1989|p=402}}|group=note}} These covered such questions as to whether it was possible to restore a priest to his office when he had been responsible for the death of an apprentice, the payment of [[tithes]], and the marriage of the unfree.

He had granted it privileges of such breadth and grandeur\u2014which were confirmed by his successors\u2014that they caused rancour and jealousy in the English church.{{sfn|Bolton|2003a|p=95}}\n\nUllman suggests that it was Adrian who began the restoration of the [[Papal monarchy]] that would reach its apotheosis under Innocent III,{{sfn|Ullmann|2003|p=122}} while Bolton argues that \"only Innocent, the great Roman, realised the value to the papacy of following where Adrian, the unique Englishman, had led\".{{sfn|Bolton|2003b|p=178}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of popes]]\n*[[Cardinals created by Adrian IV]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|45em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book|last=Abulafia|first=D.|title=Frederrick II: A Medieval Emperor|year=1988|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19508-040-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=And\u00e5s|first1=M.

{"title_page": "Lamrim", "text_new": "{{Tibetan Buddhism}}\n'''Lamrim''' (Tibetan: \"stages of the path\") is a [[Tibetan Buddhist]] textual  form for presenting the stages in the complete path to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] as taught by [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. In Tibetan Buddhist history there have been many different versions of ''lamrim'', presented by different teachers of the [[Nyingma]], [[Kagyu]] and [[Gelug]] schools.<ref>The [[Sakya]] school, too, has a somewhat similar textual form, the ''[[lamdr\u00e9]]''.</ref> However, all versions of the ''lamrim'' are elaborations of [[Atisha|Ati\u015ba]]'s 11th-century root text ''[[Bodhipathaprad\u012bpa|A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment]]'' (''Bodhipathaprad\u012bpa'').<ref name=\"thubten\">[http://www.thubtenchodron.org/GradualPathToEnlightenment/index.html Lamrim: the Gradual Path to Enlightenment]</ref> \n\n==History==\n{{Buddhism|terse=1}}\nWhen [[Ati\u015ba]], the originator of the ''lamrim'' came from India to Tibet,<ref name=\"vajraus\">[http://vajra.us/lamrim/gus_lamrim_1.html Lam Rim Meditation \u2014 What is it?]</ref> he was asked by king Jang Chub \u00d6 to give a complete and easily accessible summary of the doctrine<ref name=\"vajraus\"/> in order to clarify wrong views, especially those resulting from apparent contradictions across the [[sutra]]s and their commentaries. Based upon this request he wrote the ''[[Bodhipathaprad\u012bpa]]'' (\"A Lamp for the Path to Awakening\"), teaching what came to be known as the ''lamrim'' for the Tibetans.<ref name=\"vajraus\"/> Ati\u015ba's presentation of the doctrine later became known as the [[Kadampa]] tradition in Tibet.\n\nAccording to Tsong Khapa, in his ''Lam Rim Chen Mo'' (\"The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment\"), Ati\u015ba took the number and order of the subjects in [[Maitreya]] and [[Asanga|Asa\u1e45ga]]s ''[[Abhisamayalankara]]'' (\"Ornament of clear realizations\"), which was based on the [[Prajnaparamita|wisdom sutras]], as the basis to write the ''Bodhipathaprad\u012bpa''. In the ''Abhisamayalankara'' they emphasised the hidden meanings of the sutras.<ref>[http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Abhisamayalankara Abhisamayalankara]</ref> Tibetan Buddhists thus believe that the teachings of the ''lamrim'' are based on the sutras that the Buddha taught<ref>[http://www.thubtenchodron.org/GradualPathToEnlightenment/LR_001_Qual_29Apr91.pdf Introduction to the Lamrim series; Preeminent qualities of the compilers and of the teachings ] pgs. 4-6</ref><ref name=\"kadampa\">[http://kadampa.org/en/buddhism/stages-of-the-path Lamrim - The Stages of the Path]</ref> and therefore contains the essential points of all sutra teachings in their logical order for practice.\n\n[[Gampopa]], a Kadampa monk and student of the famed ''yogi'' [[Milarepa]], introduced the ''lamrim'' to his disciples as a way of developing the mind gradually.  His exposition of ''lamrim'' is known in English translation as \"''The Jewel Ornament of Liberation''\" and is studied to this day in the various [[Kagyu]] schools of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\n[[Tsongkhapa]], founder of the [[Gelug]] school which is primarily based on Ati\u015ba's [[Kadampa]] school, wrote one of his masterpieces on ''lamrim'': ''The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment'' (Tib. ''Lam-rim Chen-mo'')<ref name=\"thubten\"/> which has about 1000 pages, and is primarily based on literary sources. There is also a medium-length ''lamrim'' text by Tsongkhapa (200 pages) and a short one, called ''Lam-rim D\u00fc-d\u00f6n'' (Tib.), which is recited daily by many Gelugpas and is about 10 pages long.{{refn|group=note|See [https://studybuddhism.com/en/tibetan-buddhism/original-texts/sutra-texts/the-abbreviated-points-of-the-graded-path ''The Abbreviated Points of the Graded Path'']}}\n\nThe Lamrim was the first Tibetan text translated into a European language by [[Ippolito Desideri]], a Jesuit missionary, who visited Tibet and made an extensive study of Tibetan Buddhism from 1716\u20131721.<ref>Alison Gopnik, Could David Hume Have Known about Buddhism?

Disregarded in this division are individuals whose motives revolve around benefits in their current life. Striving for a favorable rebirth is implicitly the minimum requirement for an activity or practice to be classified as spiritual.\n\nAti\u015ba wrote in \"Lamp of the Path\" (verse 2) that one should understand that there are three kind of persons:\n# Persons of modest motive search for happiness within [[samsara]]; their motive is to achieve high rebirth. Buddhists traditionally consider that this domain includes followers of most non-Buddhist religions who strive for a rebirth in a heaven.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n# Persons of medium motive are searching for their own ultimate peace and abandon worldly pleasure. This includes the paths of ''[[pratyekabuddha]]s'' and ''[[sravakabuddha|\u015bravakabuddhas]]'', which seek personal liberation alone, the traditional goal of [[Hinayana|H\u012bnay\u0101na]] practice.\n# Persons of high motive, who, based on their insight of their own suffering, seek by all means to stop the suffering of all beings. This is the [[Mahayana|Mah\u0101y\u0101na]] [[Bodhisattva path]] of the ''[[Samyaksambuddha|samyaksa\u1e43buddhas]]'', who practice the [[six Perfections]].\n\nOne of the formulaic presentations of the Buddhist path in the Nikayas is ''[[anupubbikath\u0101]]'', \"graduated talk\"<ref name=\"CA\"/> or \"progressive instruction,\"<ref name=\"MN_v18\"/> in which the Buddha talks on generosity (''[[Dana (Buddhism)|d\u0101na]]''), virtue (''[[\u015a\u012bla|s\u012bla]]''), heaven (''[[sagga]]''), danger of sensual pleasure (''[[k\u0101ma|{{IAST|k\u0101m\u0101na\u1e43}}]] \u0101d\u012bnava'')<ref>In regards to translating ''\u0101d\u012bnava'', Bullitt uses the word \"drawbacks\" while \u00d1\u0101\u1e47amoli & Bodhi (2001) use \"danger\" (p. 485), and Rhys Davids & Stede (1921-25) recommend \"disadvantage, danger\" (p. 99, entry for \"\u0100d\u012bnava,\" retrieved 2007-11-13 from http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:2695.pali{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}).</ref> and renunciation (''[[nekkhamma]]''). When the listener is prepared by these topics, the Buddha then delivers \"the teaching special to the Buddhas,\"<ref name=\"MN_v18\">Majjhima Nikaya 56, ''To Upali'', verse 18.Bhikkhu Nanamoli & Bhikku Bodhi.</ref>\nthe [[Four Noble Truths]] (''catt\u0101ri ariya-[[sacca|sacc\u0101]]ni''),<ref>See, for instance, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/index.html Bullitt (2005).]</ref> by which arises \"the spotless immaculate vision of the Dhamma.\"<ref name=\"MN_v18\"/><ref name=\"CA\">Carole Anderson (2013), ''Pain and its Ending'', p.143</ref> In the Tibetan Lamrim teachings, the Bodhisattva-path, with its training of the six perfections, is added to this formula.\n\n===Subjects of the ''lamrim''===\nAlthough ''lamrim'' texts cover much the same subject areas, subjects within them may be arranged in different ways. The ''lamrim'' of Ati\u015ba starts with [[bodhicitta]], the altruistic mind of enlightenment, followed by taking the bodhisattva vows. Gampopa's ''lamrim'', however,  starts with the [[Buddha-nature]], followed by the preciousness of human rebirth. Tsongkhapa's texts start with reliance on a guru (Tib.: ''lama''), followed by the preciousness of human rebirth, and continue with the paths of the modest, medium and high scopes.\n\n[[Gampopa]] and [[Tsongkhapa]] expanded the short root-text of Ati\u015ba into an extensive system to understand the entire Buddhist philosophy. In this way, subjects like [[karma]], [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], Buddhist cosmology and the practice of [[meditation]] are gradually explained in logical order.\n\n====''Liberation in the Palm of your Hand''====\nAn example of the outline for ''lamrim'' teachings is that of ''Liberation in the Palm of your Hand'' by [[Pabongkhapa D\u00e9chen Nyingpo]].

In Tibetan Buddhist history there have been many different versions of ''lamrim'', presented by different teachers of the [[Nyingma]], [[Kagyu]] and [[Gelug]] schools.<ref>The [[Sakya]] school, too, has a somewhat similar textual form, the ''[[lamdr\u00e9]]''.</ref> However, all versions of the ''lamrim'' are elaborations of [[Atisha|Ati\u015ba]]'s 11th-century root text ''[[Bodhipathaprad\u012bpa|A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment]]'' (''Bodhipathaprad\u012bpa'').<ref name=\"thubten\">[http://www.thubtenchodron.org/GradualPathToEnlightenment/index.html Lamrim: the Gradual Path to Enlightenment]</ref> \n\n==History==\n{{Buddhism|terse=1}}\nWhen [[Ati\u015ba]], the originator of the ''lamrim'' came from India to Tibet,<ref name=\"vajraus\">[http://vajra.us/lamrim/gus_lamrim_1.html Lam Rim Meditation \u2014 What is it?]</ref> he was asked by king Jang Chub \u00d6 to give a complete and easily accessible summary of the doctrine<ref name=\"vajraus\"/> in order to clarify wrong views, especially those resulting from apparent contradictions across the [[sutra]]s and their commentaries. Based upon this request he wrote the ''[[Bodhipathaprad\u012bpa]]'' (\"A Lamp for the Path to Awakening\"), teaching what came to be known as the ''lamrim'' for the Tibetans.<ref name=\"vajraus\"/> Ati\u015ba's presentation of the doctrine later became known as the [[Kadampa]] tradition in Tibet.\n\nAccording to Tsong Khapa, in his ''Lam Rim Chen Mo'' (\"The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment\"), Ati\u015ba took the number and order of the subjects in [[Maitreya]] and [[Asanga|Asa\u1e45ga]]s ''[[Abhisamayalankara]]'' (\"Ornament of clear realizations\"), which was based on the [[Prajnaparamita|wisdom sutras]], as the basis to write the ''Bodhipathaprad\u012bpa''. In the ''Abhisamayalankara'' they emphasised the hidden meanings of the sutras.<ref>[http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Abhisamayalankara Abhisamayalankara]</ref> Tibetan Buddhists thus believe that the teachings of the ''lamrim'' are based on the sutras that the Buddha taught<ref>[http://www.thubtenchodron.org/GradualPathToEnlightenment/LR_001_Qual_29Apr91.pdf Introduction to the Lamrim series; Preeminent qualities of the compilers and of the teachings ] pgs. 4-6</ref><ref name=\"kadampa\">[http://kadampa.org/en/buddhism/stages-of-the-path Lamrim - The Stages of the Path]</ref> and therefore contains the essential points of all sutra teachings in their logical order for practice.\n\n[[Gampopa]], a Kadampa monk and student of the famed ''yogi'' [[Milarepa]], introduced the ''lamrim'' to his disciples as a way of developing the mind gradually.  His exposition of ''lamrim'' is known in English translation as \"''The Jewel Ornament of Liberation''\" and is studied to this day in the various [[Kagyu]] schools of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\n[[Tsongkhapa]], founder of the [[Gelug]] school which is primarily based on Ati\u015ba's [[Kadampa]] school, wrote one of his masterpieces on ''lamrim'': ''The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment'' (Tib. ''Lam-rim Chen-mo'')<ref name=\"thubten\"/> which has about 1000 pages, and is primarily based on literary sources. There is also a medium-length ''lamrim'' text by Tsongkhapa (200 pages) and a short one, called ''Lam-rim D\u00fc-d\u00f6n'' (Tib.), which is recited daily by many Gelugpas and is about 10 pages long.{{refn|group=note|See [https://studybuddhism.com/en/tibetan-buddhism/original-texts/sutra-texts/the-abbreviated-points-of-the-graded-path ''The Abbreviated Points of the Graded Path'']}}\n\nThe Lamrim was the first Tibetan text translated into a European language by [[Ippolito Desideri]], a Jesuit missionary, who visited Tibet and made an extensive study of Tibetan Buddhism from 1716\u20131721.<ref>Alison Gopnik, Could David Hume Have Known about Buddhism?

Disregarded in this division are individuals whose motives revolve around benefits in their current life. Striving for a favorable rebirth is implicitly the minimum requirement for an activity or practice to be classified as spiritual.\n\nAti\u015ba wrote in \"Lamp of the Path\" (verse 2) that one should understand that there are three kind of persons:\n# Persons of modest motive search for happiness within [[samsara]]; their motive is to achieve high rebirth. Buddhists traditionally consider that this domain includes followers of most non-Buddhist religions who strive for a rebirth in a heaven.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n# Persons of medium motive are searching for their own ultimate peace and abandon worldly pleasure. This includes the paths of ''[[pratyekabuddha]]s'' and ''[[sravakabuddha|\u015bravakabuddhas]]'', which seek personal liberation alone, the traditional goal of [[Hinayana|H\u012bnay\u0101na]] practice.\n# Persons of high motive, who, based on their insight of their own suffering, seek by all means to stop the suffering of all beings. This is the [[Mahayana|Mah\u0101y\u0101na]] [[Bodhisattva path]] of the ''[[Samyaksambuddha|samyaksa\u1e43buddhas]]'', who practice the [[six Perfections]].\n\nOne of the formulaic presentations of the Buddhist path in the Nikayas is ''[[anupubbikath\u0101]]'', \"graduated talk\"<ref name=\"CA\"/> or \"progressive instruction,\"<ref name=\"MN_v18\"/> in which the Buddha talks on generosity (''[[Dana (Buddhism)|d\u0101na]]''), virtue (''[[\u015a\u012bla|s\u012bla]]''), heaven (''[[sagga]]''), danger of sensual pleasure (''[[k\u0101ma|{{IAST|k\u0101m\u0101na\u1e43}}]] \u0101d\u012bnava'')<ref>In regards to translating ''\u0101d\u012bnava'', Bullitt uses the word \"drawbacks\" while \u00d1\u0101\u1e47amoli & Bodhi (2001) use \"danger\" (p. 485), and Rhys Davids & Stede (1921-25) recommend \"disadvantage, danger\" (p. 99, entry for \"\u0100d\u012bnava,\" retrieved 2007-11-13 from http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:2695.pali{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}).</ref> and renunciation (''[[nekkhamma]]''). When the listener is prepared by these topics, the Buddha then delivers \"the teaching special to the Buddhas,\"<ref name=\"MN_v18\">Majjhima Nikaya 56, ''To Upali'', verse 18.Bhikkhu Nanamoli & Bhikku Bodhi.</ref>\nthe [[Four Noble Truths]] (''catt\u0101ri ariya-[[sacca|sacc\u0101]]ni''),<ref>See, for instance, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/index.html Bullitt (2005).]</ref> by which arises \"the spotless immaculate vision of the Dhamma.\"<ref name=\"MN_v18\"/><ref name=\"CA\">Carole Anderson (2013), ''Pain and its Ending'', p.143</ref> In the Tibetan Lamrim teachings, the Bodhisattva-path, with its training of the six perfections, is added to this formula.\n\n===Subjects of the ''lamrim''===\nAlthough ''lamrim'' texts cover much the same subject areas, subjects within them may be arranged in different ways. The ''lamrim'' of Ati\u015ba starts with [[bodhicitta]], the altruistic mind of enlightenment, followed by taking the bodhisattva vows. Gampopa's ''lamrim'', however,  starts with the [[Buddha-nature]], followed by the preciousness of human rebirth. Tsongkhapa's texts start with reliance on a guru (Tib.: ''lama''), followed by the preciousness of human rebirth, and continue with the paths of the modest, medium and high scopes.\n\n[[Gampopa]] and [[Tsongkhapa]] expanded the short root-text of Ati\u015ba into an extensive system to understand the entire Buddhist philosophy. In this way, subjects like [[karma]], [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], Buddhist cosmology and the practice of [[meditation]] are gradually explained in logical order.\n\n====''Liberation in the Palm of your Hand''====\nAn example of the outline for ''lamrim'' teachings is that of ''Liberation in the Palm of your Hand'' by [[Pabongkhapa D\u00e9chen Nyingpo]].

The Buckeyes played their home games at [[Ohio Stadium]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. This was the Buckeyes' 130th overall season and 107th as a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]]. They were led by [[Ryan Day (American football)|Ryan Day]], in his first season as Ohio State's full-time head coach.\n\nOhio State began the year ranked fifth in the preseason [[AP Poll]]. The Buckeyes climbed to number one in the [[College Football Playoff]] rankings by the end of the regular season, after dominating wins over [[Conference USA]] champion [[2019 Florida Atlantic Owls football team|Florida Atlantic]], [[American Athletic Conference]] runner-up [[2019 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]], and [[Mid-American Conference]] champion [[2019 Miami RedHawks football team|Miami (OH)]] in the non-conference schedule; and comfortable wins over ranked Big Ten teams [[2019 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]], [[2019 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]], and [[2019 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]] in conference play. In the [[2019 Big Ten Championship Game|Big Ten Championship Game]], Ohio State defeated Wisconsin a second time, by a score of 34\u201321 to win their third consecutive conference title. In the final CFP rankings of the season, Ohio State dropped from first to second, passed by SEC champion [[2019 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]], which placed Ohio State in the [[2019 Fiesta Bowl (December)|Fiesta Bowl]] to play defending national champion and third-seeded [[2019 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]]. Ohio State lost that game, 29\u201323, to end the year at 13\u20131.\n\nThe Buckeyes were led on offense by sophomore quarterback [[Justin Fields]], an incoming transfer from [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia]] that was granted a waiver for immediate eligibility by the NCAA. He led the Big Ten with 3,273 passing yards and 41 passing touchdowns to go along with 10 rushing touchdowns, and finished third in voting for the [[Heisman Trophy]]. Running back [[J. K. Dobbins]] became the first Buckeye running back to eclipse the 2,000 yard mark, finishing tied atop the Big Ten with Wisconsin's [[Jonathan Taylor (American football)|Jonathan Taylor]] at 2,003 yards and 21 touchdowns. On defense, Ohio State was led by [[Chuck Bednarik Award]], [[Ted Hendricks Award]], and [[Bronko Nagurski Trophy]]-winning defensive end [[Chase Young]], who led the country with 16.5 sacks and also finished in fourth in Heisman Trophy voting. He was joined on the [[2019 College Football All-America Team|first-team All-America]] by cornerback [[Jeff Okudah]]. Head coach Ryan Day was named [[Big Ten Coach of the Year]] by the media, becoming the first Ohio State head coach to win it since [[Earle Bruce]] in [[1979 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|1979]].\n\n== Previous season==\nThe [[2018 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Buckeyes]] finished the [[2018 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2018 season]] 13\u20131, 8\u20131 in [[2018 Big Ten Conference football season|Big Ten play]] to win the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|East division]]. They defeated [[2018 Northwestern Wildcats football team|Northwestern]] in the [[2018 Big Ten Football Championship Game|Big Ten Championship]] 45\u201324. However, despite a 12\u20131 record, they failed to receive an invitation to the [[College Football Playoff]]. Instead, they received a bid to the [[2019 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]] where they defeated [[2018 Washington Huskies football team|Washington]] 28\u201323. This was the final season for [[Urban Meyer]] as the Buckeyes' head coach, who coached at Ohio State for seven seasons.

Ohio State was able to halt Wisconsin's ensuing drive and get the ball back with 2:37 remaining. The Buckeyes found success on the drive and were able to drive 85 yards and score on a 27-yard pass from [[Justin Fields]] to Chris Olave. This score gave the Buckeyes a 10\u20130 lead at halftime.\n\nOhio State received the second-half kick which ended after failing to convert a first down. The Badgers were able to partially block their punt and it only went 13 yards, giving Wisconsin prime field position. In three plays, Wisconsin scored on a 26-yard touchdown pass from [[Jack Coan]] to AJ Taylor, making the score 10\u20137. Following the Wisconsin score, Ohio State would go on to score touchdowns on their next four drives, while Wisconsin would punt twice and fumble twice.

The Buckeyes played their home games at [[Ohio Stadium]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. This was the Buckeyes' 130th overall season and 107th as a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]]. They were led by [[Ryan Day (American football)|Ryan Day]], in his first season as Ohio State's full-time head coach.\n\nOhio State began the year ranked fifth in the preseason [[AP Poll]]. The Buckeyes climbed to number one in the [[College Football Playoff]] rankings by the end of the regular season, after dominating wins over [[Conference USA]] champion [[2019 Florida Atlantic Owls football team|Florida Atlantic]], [[American Athletic Conference]] runner-up [[2019 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]], and [[Mid-American Conference]] champion [[2019 Miami RedHawks football team|Miami (OH)]] in the non-conference schedule; and comfortable wins over ranked Big Ten teams [[2019 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]], [[2019 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]], and [[2019 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]] in conference play. In the [[2019 Big Ten Championship Game|Big Ten Championship Game]], Ohio State defeated Wisconsin a second time, by a score of 34\u201321 to win their third consecutive conference title. In the final CFP rankings of the season, Ohio State dropped from first to second, passed by SEC champion [[2019 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]], which placed Ohio State in the [[2019 Fiesta Bowl (December)|Fiesta Bowl]] to play defending national champion and third-seeded [[2019 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]]. Ohio State lost that game, 29\u201323, to end the year at 13\u20131.\n\nThe Buckeyes were led on offense by sophomore quarterback [[Justin Fields]], an incoming transfer from [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia]] that was granted a waiver for immediate eligibility by the NCAA. He led the Big Ten with 3,273 passing yards and 41 passing touchdowns to go along with 10 rushing touchdowns, and finished third in voting for the [[Heisman Trophy]]. Running back [[J. K. Dobbins]] became the first Buckeye running back to eclipse the 2,000 yard mark, finishing tied atop the Big Ten with Wisconsin's [[Jonathan Taylor (American football)|Jonathan Taylor]] at 2,003 yards and 21 touchdowns. On defense, Ohio State was led by [[Chuck Bednarik Award]], [[Ted Hendricks Award]], and [[Bronko Nagurski Trophy]]-winning defensive end [[Chase Young]], who led the country with 16.5 sacks and also finished in fourth in Heisman Trophy voting. He was joined on the [[2019 College Football All-America Team|first-team All-America]] by cornerback [[Jeff Okudah]]. Head coach Ryan Day was named [[Big Ten Coach of the Year]] by the media, becoming the first Ohio State head coach to win it since [[Earle Bruce]] in [[1979 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|1979]].\n\n== Previous season==\nThe [[2018 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Buckeyes]] finished the [[2018 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2018 season]] 13\u20131, 8\u20131 in [[2018 Big Ten Conference football season|Big Ten play]] to win the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|East division]]. They defeated [[2018 Northwestern Wildcats football team|Northwestern]] in the [[2018 Big Ten Football Championship Game|Big Ten Championship]] 45\u201324. However, despite a 12\u20131 record, they failed to receive an invitation to the [[College Football Playoff]]. Instead, they received a bid to the [[2019 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]] where they defeated [[2018 Washington Huskies football team|Washington]] 28\u201323. This was the final season for [[Urban Meyer]] as the Buckeyes' head coach, who coached at Ohio State for seven seasons. In January 2019, it was announced [[University of Georgia|Georgia]] Quarterback [[Justin Fields]] would be transferring to Ohio State.\n\n==Preseason==\n===Spring Game===\nThe 2019 Spring Game was held at Ohio Stadium on April 13, 2019, with the Gray team defeating the Scarlet team, 35\u201317.<ref>{{cite web |title=3 things learned from the Ohio State spring game |url=https://www.landgrantholyland.com/2019/4/13/18309275/ohio-state-spring-game-analysis-justin-fields-matthew-baldwin-garrett-wilson-jahsen-wint |website=www.landgrantholyland.com |publisher=SBNation |accessdate=13 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!

Defense reigned supreme in the first quarter, as was expected. The Buckeyes were only able to gain 44 yards of total offense while Wisconsin put together 59.

The game was tied at 0\u20130 at the end of the first.\n\nIt wasn't until the 6:56 mark of the second quarter, when Ohio State's Blake Haubeil made a 49-yard field goal, that the stalemate was broken. Ohio State was able to halt Wisconsin's ensuing drive and get the ball back with 2:37 remaining. The Buckeyes found success on the drive and were able to drive 85 yards and score on a 27-yard pass from [[Justin Fields]] to Chris Olave. This score gave the Buckeyes a 10\u20130 lead at halftime.\n\nOhio State received the second-half kick which ended after failing to convert a first down. The Badgers were able to partially block their punt and it only went 13 yards, giving Wisconsin prime field position. In three plays, Wisconsin scored on a 26-yard touchdown pass from [[Jack Coan]] to AJ Taylor, making the score 10\u20137. Following the Wisconsin score, Ohio State would go on to score touchdowns on their next four drives, while Wisconsin would punt twice and fumble twice.

The best known of these attractions are [[Haunted Mansion]] as a singing bust, [[Country Bear Jamboree]], [[Mark Twain Riverboat]], [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]], [[Disneyland Railroad]], and [[Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room]] as \"Fritz\". \n\nHis voice acting career began in 1940 and lasted until his death in 2005 at age 91.<ref name=\"Death\" />\n\n==Early life and career==\n\nRavenscroft left his native [[Norfolk, Nebraska]], in 1933 for [[California]], where he studied at Otis Art Institute. He achieved early success as part of a singing group called [[The Mellomen]]. The Mellomen can be heard on many popular recordings of the [[Big Band]] Era, including backup for [[Bing Crosby]], [[Frankie Laine]], [[Spike Jones]], [[Jo Stafford]], and [[Rosemary Clooney]].  Their earliest contribution to a Disney film was for ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940), to which they contributed the song \"Honest John\". This was deleted from the film, but can still be heard in the supplements on the 2009 DVD. Ravenscroft also voiced [[The Terrible Dogfish#In Disney version|Monstro the Whale]] in ''Pinocchio''. The Mellomen contributed to other Disney films, such as ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''. The group appeared on camera in a few episodes of the [[Disney anthology television series]]; in one instance recording a canine chorus for ''Lady and the Tramp'' and in another as a [[barbershop quartet]] that reminds [[Walt Disney]] of the name of the young newspaper reporter ''Gallegher''.\n\nRavenscroft is also heard with the quartet on some of the ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' and ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' with [[Mel Blanc]] at [[Warner Bros.]] as well as on radio \"driving [[Jack Benny]] crazy\" on [[The Jack Benny Program]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Ravenscroft served as a civilian [[flight officer|navigator]] contracted to the [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)#Record of the ATC|U.S. Air Transport Command]], spending five years flying [[courier]] missions across the north and south [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].  Among the notables carried on board his flights were [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Bob Hope]]. As he told an interviewer: \"I flew Winston Churchill to a conference in Algiers and flew Bob Hope to the troops a couple of times. So it was fun.\"<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/hes-grrrrreat-the-thurl-ravenscroft-interview/ \"He\u2019s Grrrrreat!

He sang on the soundtrack for [[Ken Clark (actor)|Ken Clark]] as \"Stewpot\" in ''[[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]]'', one of the top-selling albums of the 1950s.

He was also the bass singer on [[Bobby Vee]]'s 1960 Liberty hit record \"[[Devil or Angel]]\". [[Andy Williams]]' recording of \"The 12 Days of Christmas\" features him as well. In the 1980s and 1990s, Ravenscroft was narrator for the annual [[Pageant of the Masters]] art show at the [[Laguna Beach, California]], Festival of the Arts.\n\nHe sang the opening songs for the two Disney serials used on ''The Mickey Mouse Club'', ''Boys of the Western Sea'' and ''The Hardy Boys: Mystery of the Applegate Treasure''.\n\nHe sang the \"Twitterpatter Song\" and \"Thumper's Song\" on the Disneyland record ''Peter Cottontail and other Funny Bunnies''.\n\nOn the Disneyland record ''All About Dragons'', he both provided the narration and sang the songs \"The Reluctant Dragon\" and \"The Loch Ness Monster\".<ref>Disneyland Record \"All About Dragons\", DQ-1301.</ref>\n\nHis voice was heard during the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]] ride as well as the [[Haunted Mansion]] at [[Disneyland]] as Uncle Theodore, the lead vocalist of the [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Singing Busts|singing busts]] in the cemetery near the end of the ride.<ref>[http://365daysofmagic.com/history/listen-to-the-unmistakable-voice-of-thurl-ravenscroft 365 Days of Magic blog] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130804060240/http://365daysofmagic.com/history/listen-to-the-unmistakable-voice-of-thurl-ravenscroft |date=August 4, 2013 }}</ref>  He also played the Narrator in ''[[A Spooky Night in Disney's Haunted Mansion|The Story and Song From the Haunted Mansion]]''. Ravenscroft is also heard in the [[Enchanted Tiki Room]] as the voice of Fritz the [[Animatronics]] parrot, as well as the tree-like Tangaroa tiki god in the pre-show outside the attraction. He was also the voice of the Disneyland Railroad in the 1990s. Further roles include that of The First Mate on The Mark Twain Riverboat and of the American bison head named Buff at The Country Bear Jamboree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disney.go.com/disneyinsider/history/legends/thurl-ravenscroft|title=Insider - Oh My Disney|website=Oh My Disney}}</ref>\n\n==Later career==\nOne of Ravenscroft's best-known uncredited works is as the vocalist for the song \"[[You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch]].\"  His name was accidentally omitted from the credits, leading many to believe that the cartoon's narrator, [[Boris Karloff]], sang the song, while others cited [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]] as the song's signature voice.<ref name=\"Grinch\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/magazine/25raven.html|title=Our Cereal Hero|accessdate=December 27, 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Elizabeth|last=McCracken|date=December 25, 2005}}</ref>\n\nRavenscroft also sang \"[[No Dogs Allowed]]\" in the ''[[Peanuts]]'' animated motion picture ''[[Snoopy, Come Home]]'' and ''I Was a Teenaged Brain Surgeon'' for [[Spike Jones]].\n\nFor more than 50 years, he was the uncredited voice of [[Tony the Tiger]] for [[Kellogg's Frosted Flakes]].  His booming bass gave the cereal's tiger mascot a voice with the catchphrase \"They're g-r-r-r-eat!!!!\".<ref>{{cite news|title= He's 'G-r-r-r-eat!!!' : Tony the Tiger Voices Pleasure  |work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 3, 1987|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-03/local/me-8443_1_thurl-ravenscroft|accessdate=March 23, 2012|first=Marcos|last=Breton}}</ref>\n\nVarious record companies, such as Abbott, Coral, Brunswick, and \"X\" (a division of [[RCA]]) also released singles by Ravenscroft, often in duets with little-known female vocalists, in an attempt to turn the bass-voiced veteran into a pop singer. These efforts were commercially unsuccessful, if often quite interesting. He was also teamed up with [[the Andrews Sisters]] (on the [[Dot Records]] album ''The Andrews Sisters Present'') on the cover of [[Johnny Cymbal]]'s \"[[Mr. Bass Man]]\". The Mellomen released some [[doo-wop]] records under the name Big John & the Buzzards, a name apparently given to them by the rock-and-roll-hating [[Mitch Miller]].\n\nHis lifelong dream, which he shared in an interview in 1999 with Peter Anthony Holder, was to record the entire [[Bible]] on tape, but [[James Earl Jones]] \"beat him out\". However, being a devoted Christian, he appeared on many religious television shows such as ''[[The Hour of Power]]''.  In 1970, he recorded an album called \"Great Hymns in Story and Song\", which featured him singing 10 hymns, each prefaced with the stories of how each hymn came to be, with the background vocals and instrumentals arranged and conducted by [[Ralph Carmichael]].\n\n==Later life and death==\nRavenscroft married June Seamans in 1946 and they had two children. June died in 1999 from unknown causes. Ravenscroft semi-retired and did not work at any other studio, but continued to voice Tony the Tiger through 2004 (with limo transportation by Kellogg's) and was also interviewed that year by the Disney \"Extinct Attractions Club\" website. He died in his home on May&nbsp;22, 2005 from [[prostate cancer]]. He was buried at the Memorial Gardens at the [[Crystal Cathedral]] in [[Garden Grove, California]].<ref name=\"Death\">{{cite news|title= Thurl Ravenscroft, Voice of Tony the Tiger, Dies at 91  |work= [[The New York Times]]|date=May 25, 2005|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/25/arts/television/25ravenscroft.html|accessdate=March 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the June 6, 2005 issue of the advertising industry journal ''[[Advertising Age]]'', Kellogg's ran an advertisement commemorating Ravenscroft, the [[headline]] reading: \"Behind every great character is an even greater man.\"  After his death, [[Lee Marshall (announcer)|Lee Marshall]] replaced him as the voice of Tony the Tiger in the Kellogg's commercials, but some commercials still recycle clips of Ravenscroft.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The best known of these attractions are [[Haunted Mansion]] as a singing bust, [[Country Bear Jamboree]], [[Mark Twain Riverboat]], [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]], [[Disneyland Railroad]], and [[Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room]] as \"Fritz\". \n\nHis voice acting career began in 1940 and lasted until his death in 2005 at age 91.<ref name=\"Death\" />\n\n==Early life and career==\n\nRavenscroft left his native [[Norfolk, Nebraska]], in 1933 for [[California]], where he studied at Otis Art Institute. He achieved early success as part of a singing group called [[The Mellomen]]. The Mellomen can be heard on many popular recordings of the [[Big Band]] Era, including backup for [[Bing Crosby]], [[Frankie Laine]], [[Spike Jones]], [[Jo Stafford]], and [[Rosemary Clooney]].  Their earliest contribution to a Disney film was for ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940), to which they contributed the song \"Honest John\". This was deleted from the film, but can still be heard in the supplements on the 2009 DVD. Ravenscroft also voiced [[The Terrible Dogfish#In Disney version|Monstro the Whale]] in ''Pinocchio''. The Mellomen contributed to other Disney films, such as ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''. The group appeared on camera in a few episodes of the [[Disney anthology television series]]; in one instance recording a canine chorus for ''Lady and the Tramp'' and in another as a [[barbershop quartet]] that reminds [[Walt Disney]] of the name of the young newspaper reporter ''Gallegher''.\n\nRavenscroft is also heard with the quartet on some of the ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' and ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' with [[Mel Blanc]] at [[Warner Bros.]] as well as on radio \"driving [[Jack Benny]] crazy\" on [[The Jack Benny Program]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Ravenscroft served as a civilian [[flight officer|navigator]] contracted to the [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)#Record of the ATC|U.S. Air Transport Command]], spending five years flying [[courier]] missions across the north and south [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].  Among the notables carried on board his flights were [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Bob Hope]]. As he told an interviewer: \"I flew Winston Churchill to a conference in Algiers and flew Bob Hope to the troops a couple of times. So it was fun.\"<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/hes-grrrrreat-the-thurl-ravenscroft-interview/ \"He\u2019s Grrrrreat!

He sang on the soundtrack for [[Ken Clark (actor)|Ken Clark]] as \"Stewpot\" in ''[[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]]'', one of the top-selling albums of the 1950s.

He was also the bass singer on [[Bobby Vee]]'s 1960 Liberty hit record \"[[Devil or Angel]]\". [[Andy Williams]]' recording of \"The 12 Days of Christmas\" features him as well. In the 1980s and 1990s, Ravenscroft was narrator for the annual [[Pageant of the Masters]] art show at the [[Laguna Beach, California]], Festival of the Arts.\n\nHe sang the opening songs for the two Disney serials used on ''The Mickey Mouse Club'', ''Boys of the Western Sea'' and ''The Hardy Boys: Mystery of the Applegate Treasure''.\n\nHe sang the \"Twitterpatter Song\" and \"Thumper's Song\" on the Disneyland record ''Peter Cottontail and other Funny Bunnies''.\n\nOn the Disneyland record ''All About Dragons'', he both provided the narration and sang the songs \"The Reluctant Dragon\" and \"The Loch Ness Monster\".<ref>Disneyland Record \"All About Dragons\", DQ-1301.</ref>\n\nHis voice was heard during the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]] ride as well as the [[Haunted Mansion]] at [[Disneyland]] as Uncle Theodore, the lead vocalist of the [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Singing Busts|singing busts]] in the cemetery near the end of the ride.<ref>[http://365daysofmagic.com/history/listen-to-the-unmistakable-voice-of-thurl-ravenscroft 365 Days of Magic blog] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130804060240/http://365daysofmagic.com/history/listen-to-the-unmistakable-voice-of-thurl-ravenscroft |date=August 4, 2013 }}</ref>  He also played the Narrator in ''[[A Spooky Night in Disney's Haunted Mansion|The Story and Song From the Haunted Mansion]]''. Ravenscroft is also heard in the [[Enchanted Tiki Room]] as the voice of Fritz the [[Animatronics]] parrot, as well as the tree-like Tangaroa tiki god in the pre-show outside the attraction. He was also the voice of the Disneyland Railroad in the 1990s. Further roles include that of The First Mate on The Mark Twain Riverboat and of the American bison head named Buff at The Country Bear Jamboree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disney.go.com/disneyinsider/history/legends/thurl-ravenscroft|title=Insider - Oh My Disney|website=Oh My Disney}}</ref>\n\n==Later career==\nOne of Ravenscroft's best-known uncredited works is as the vocalist for the song \"[[You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch]].\"  His name was accidentally omitted from the credits, leading many to believe that the cartoon's narrator, [[Boris Karloff]], sang the song, while others cited [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]] as the song's signature voice.<ref name=\"Grinch\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/magazine/25raven.html|title=Our Cereal Hero|accessdate=December 27, 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Elizabeth|last=McCracken|date=December 25, 2005}}</ref>\n\nRavenscroft also sang \"[[No Dogs Allowed]]\" in the ''[[Peanuts]]'' animated motion picture ''[[Snoopy, Come Home]]'' and ''I Was a Teenaged Brain Surgeon'' for [[Spike Jones]].\n\nFor more than 50 years, he was the uncredited voice of [[Tony the Tiger]] for [[Kellogg's Frosted Flakes]].

These efforts were commercially unsuccessful, if often quite interesting. He was also teamed up with [[the Andrews Sisters]] (on the [[Dot Records]] album ''The Andrews Sisters Present'') on the cover of [[Johnny Cymbal]]'s \"[[Mr. Bass Man]]\". The Mellomen released some [[doo-wop]] records under the name Big John & the Buzzards, a name apparently given to them by the rock-and-roll-hating [[Mitch Miller]].\n\nHis lifelong dream, which he shared in an interview in 1999 with Peter Anthony Holder, was to record the entire [[Bible]] on tape, but [[James Earl Jones]] \"beat him out\". However, being a devoted Christian, he appeared on many religious television shows such as ''[[The Hour of Power]]''.  In 1970, he recorded an album called \"Great Hymns in Story and Song\", which featured him singing 10 hymns, each prefaced with the stories of how each hymn came to be, with the background vocals and instrumentals arranged and conducted by [[Ralph Carmichael]].\n\n==Later life and death==\nRavenscroft married June Seamans in 1946 and they had two children. June died in 1999 from unknown causes. Ravenscroft semi-retired and did not work at any other studio, but continued to voice Tony the Tiger through 2004 (with limo transportation by Kellogg's) and was also interviewed that year by the Disney \"Extinct Attractions Club\" website. He died in his home on May&nbsp;22, 2005 from [[prostate cancer]]. He was buried at the Memorial Gardens at the [[Crystal Cathedral]] in [[Garden Grove, California]].<ref name=\"Death\">{{cite news|title= Thurl Ravenscroft, Voice of Tony the Tiger, Dies at 91  |work= [[The New York Times]]|date=May 25, 2005|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/25/arts/television/25ravenscroft.html|accessdate=March 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the June 6, 2005 issue of the advertising industry journal ''[[Advertising Age]]'', Kellogg's ran an advertisement commemorating Ravenscroft, the [[headline]] reading: \"Behind every great character is an even greater man.\"  After his death, [[Lee Marshall (announcer)|Lee Marshall]] replaced him as the voice of Tony the Tiger in the Kellogg's commercials, but some commercials still recycle clips of Ravenscroft.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Under the umbrella of [[Emergency Use Authorization]]s, the old policy stated that laboratory-developed tests \"should not be used for clinical diagnoses without FDA's approval, clearance, or authorization during an emergency declaration\".

Under the umbrella of [[Emergency Use Authorization]]s, the old policy stated that laboratory-developed tests \"should not be used for clinical diagnoses without FDA's approval, clearance, or authorization during an emergency declaration\".
