McRaven]], the commander of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), about the compound in January 2011. McRaven said a commando raid would be fairly straightforward but he was concerned about the Pakistani response. He assigned a captain from the [[SEAL Team Six|U.S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU)]] to work with a CIA team at their campus in [[Langley, Virginia]]. The captain, named \"Brian\", set up an office in the printing plant in the CIA's Langley compound and, with six other JSOC officers, began to plan the raid.<ref name=\"Getting Bin Laden\" /> Administration attorneys considered legal implications and options before the raid.<ref>{{cite news|title=Before Osama bin Laden Raid, Obama Administration's Secret Legal Deliberations|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/us/politics/obama-legal-authorization-osama-bin-laden-raid.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 28, 2015|access-date=October 28, 2015|issn=0362-4331|first=Charlie|last=Savage}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to a helicopter raid, planners considered attacking the compound with [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]] stealth bombers. They also considered a joint operation with Pakistani forces. Obama decided that the Pakistani government and military could not be trusted to maintain [[operational security]] for the operation against bin Laden. \"There was a real lack of confidence that the Pakistanis could keep this secret for more than a nanosecond,\" a senior adviser to the President told ''[[The New Yorker]]''.<ref name=\"Getting Bin Laden\" />\n\nObama met with the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] on March 14 to review the options; he was concerned that the mission would be exposed and wanted to proceed quickly. For that reason he ruled out involving the Pakistanis. Defense Secretary [[Robert Gates]] and other military officials expressed doubts as to whether bin Laden was in the compound, and whether a commando raid was worth the risk. At the end of the meeting, the president seemed to be leaning toward a bombing mission. Two [[U.S. Air Force]] officers were tasked with exploring that option further.<ref name=\"spymilitary\" />\n\nThe CIA was unable to rule out the existence of an underground [[bunker]] below the compound. Presuming that one existed, 32 {{convert|2000|lb|adj=on}} bombs fitted with [[Joint Direct Attack Munition|JDAM]] guidance systems would be required to destroy it.<ref name=\"behindthehunt\" /> With that amount of [[Ammunition|ordnance]], at least one other house was in the [[blast radius]]. Estimates were that up to a dozen civilians would be killed in addition to those in the compound. Furthermore, it was unlikely there would be enough evidence remaining to prove that bin Laden was dead. Presented with this information at the next Security Council meeting on March 29, Obama put the bombing plan on hold. Instead he directed Admiral McRaven to develop the plan for a helicopter raid. The U.S. intelligence community also studied an option of hitting bin Laden with a drone-fired [[Pyros (bomb)|small tactical munition]] as he paced in his compound's vegetable garden.<ref name=\"Bowden144\">{{cite magazine |last=Bowden |first=Mark |author-link=Mark Bowden |title=The Hunt For 'Geronimo' |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=November 2012 |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/11/inside-osama-bin-laden-assassination-plot|accessdate=January 27, 2012}}, p.&nbsp;144</ref>\n\nMcRaven hand-picked a team drawing from the most experienced and senior operators from Red Squadron,<ref name=\"RelentStrike\">{{cite book|last1=Naylor|first1=Sean|title=Relentless Strike|location=Chapter 27}}</ref> one of four that make up DEVGRU.

The helicopters (modified [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk Helicopters]]) to be used in the raid had been designed to be quiet and to have low radar visibility. Since the U.S. had helped equip and train the Pakistanis, their defensive capabilities were known.

As a measure to bolster the \"fight your way out\" scenario, [[Chinook helicopter]]s were to be positioned nearby with additional troops. The greater part of the advisers in the meeting supported going forward with the raid. Only Vice President Biden completely opposed it. Gates advocated using the drone missile option but changed his support the next day to the helicopter raid plan. Obama said he wanted to speak directly to Admiral McRaven before he gave the order to proceed. The president asked if McRaven had learned anything since arriving in Afghanistan that caused him to lose confidence in the mission. McRaven told him the team was ready and that the next few nights would have little moonlight over Abbottabad, good conditions for a raid.<ref name=\"Getting Bin Laden\" /><ref name=\"Bowden144\" />\n\nOn April 29 at 8:20&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern daylight time|EDT]],<ref name=targetchapter6 /> Obama conferred with his advisers and gave the final go-ahead.

McRaven]], the commander of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), about the compound in January 2011. McRaven said a commando raid would be fairly straightforward but he was concerned about the Pakistani response. He assigned a captain from the [[SEAL Team Six|U.S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU)]] to work with a CIA team at their campus in [[Langley, Virginia]]. The captain, named \"Brian\", set up an office in the printing plant in the CIA's Langley compound and, with six other JSOC officers, began to plan the raid.<ref name=\"Getting Bin Laden\" /> Administration attorneys considered legal implications and options before the raid.<ref>{{cite news|title=Before Osama bin Laden Raid, Obama Administration's Secret Legal Deliberations|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/us/politics/obama-legal-authorization-osama-bin-laden-raid.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 28, 2015|access-date=October 28, 2015|issn=0362-4331|first=Charlie|last=Savage}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to a helicopter raid, planners considered attacking the compound with [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]] stealth bombers. They also considered a joint operation with Pakistani forces. Obama decided that the Pakistani government and military could not be trusted to maintain [[operational security]] for the operation against bin Laden. \"There was a real lack of confidence that the Pakistanis could keep this secret for more than a nanosecond,\" a senior adviser to the President told ''[[The New Yorker]]''.<ref name=\"Getting Bin Laden\" />\n\nObama met with the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] on March 14 to review the options; he was concerned that the mission would be exposed and wanted to proceed quickly. For that reason he ruled out involving the Pakistanis. Defense Secretary [[Robert Gates]] and other military officials expressed doubts as to whether bin Laden was in the compound, and whether a commando raid was worth the risk. At the end of the meeting, the president seemed to be leaning toward a bombing mission. Two [[U.S. Air Force]] officers were tasked with exploring that option further.<ref name=\"spymilitary\" />\n\nThe CIA was unable to rule out the existence of an underground [[bunker]] below the compound. Presuming that one existed, 32 {{convert|2000|lb|adj=on}} bombs fitted with [[Joint Direct Attack Munition|JDAM]] guidance systems would be required to destroy it.<ref name=\"behindthehunt\" /> With that amount of [[Ammunition|ordnance]], at least one other house was in the [[blast radius]]. Estimates were that up to a dozen civilians would be killed in addition to those in the compound. Furthermore, it was unlikely there would be enough evidence remaining to prove that bin Laden was dead. Presented with this information at the next Security Council meeting on March 29, Obama put the bombing plan on hold. Instead he directed Admiral McRaven to develop the plan for a helicopter raid. The U.S. intelligence community also studied an option of hitting bin Laden with a drone-fired [[Pyros (bomb)|small tactical munition]] as he paced in his compound's vegetable garden.<ref name=\"Bowden144\">{{cite magazine |last=Bowden |first=Mark |author-link=Mark Bowden |title=The Hunt For 'Geronimo' |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=November 2012 |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/11/inside-osama-bin-laden-assassination-plot|accessdate=January 27, 2012}}, p.&nbsp;144</ref>\n\nMcRaven hand-picked a team drawing from the most experienced and senior operators from Red Squadron,<ref name=\"RelentStrike\">{{cite book|last1=Naylor|first1=Sean|title=Relentless Strike|location=Chapter 27}}</ref> one of four that make up DEVGRU.

The helicopters (modified [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk Helicopters]]) to be used in the raid had been designed to be quiet and to have low radar visibility. Since the U.S. had helped equip and train the Pakistanis, their defensive capabilities were known.

As a measure to bolster the \"fight your way out\" scenario, [[Chinook helicopter]]s were to be positioned nearby with additional troops. The greater part of the advisers in the meeting supported going forward with the raid. Only Vice President Biden completely opposed it. Gates advocated using the drone missile option but changed his support the next day to the helicopter raid plan. Obama said he wanted to speak directly to Admiral McRaven before he gave the order to proceed. The president asked if McRaven had learned anything since arriving in Afghanistan that caused him to lose confidence in the mission. McRaven told him the team was ready and that the next few nights would have little moonlight over Abbottabad, good conditions for a raid.<ref name=\"Getting Bin Laden\" /><ref name=\"Bowden144\" />\n\nOn April 29 at 8:20&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern daylight time|EDT]],<ref name=targetchapter6 /> Obama conferred with his advisers and gave the final go-ahead.

Other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance-like quality, including [[martial arts]], [[gymnastics]], [[cheerleading]], [[figure skating]], [[synchronised swimming]], marching bands, and many other forms of athletics.\n\n==Performance and participation==\n[[File:GDC onlywayaround.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Members of an American jazz dance company perform a formal group routine in a concert dance setting]]\n\nTheatrical dance, also called performance or concert dance, is intended primarily as a spectacle, usually a [[performance]] upon a [[Stage (theater)|stage]] by [[virtuoso]] dancers. It often tells a [[narrative|story]], perhaps using [[Mime artist|mime]], [[Dance costumes|costume]] and [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]], or else it may simply [[Interpretive dance|interpret the musical accompaniment]], which is often specially composed. Examples are western [[ballet]] and [[modern dance]], [[Classical Indian dance]] and Chinese and Japanese song and dance dramas. Most classical forms are centred upon dance alone, but performance dance may also appear in [[opera]] and other forms of [[musical theatre]].\n\nParticipatory dance, on the other hand, whether it be a [[folk dance]], a [[social dance]], a [[group dance]] such as a [[Line dance|line]], [[Circle dance|circle]], [[Medieval dance#Other Chain Dances|chain]] or [[square dance]], or a [[partner dance]] such as is common in western [[Ballroom dance|Western ballroom dancing]], is undertaken primarily for a common purpose, such as [[social interaction]] or [[exercise]], of participants rather than onlookers. Such dance seldom has any narrative. A group dance and a ''[[corps de ballet]]'', a social partner dance and a ''[[pas de deux]]'', differ profoundly. Even a [[solo dance]] may be undertaken solely for the satisfaction of the dancer. Participatory dancers often all employ the same movements and steps but, for example, in the [[rave culture]] of [[electronic dance music]], vast crowds may engage in [[free dance]], uncoordinated with those around them. On the other hand, some cultures lay down strict rules as to the particular dances in which, for example, men, women and children may or must participate.\n\n==Origins==\n{{Main|History of Dance}}\n[[File:Dancing painting at Bhimbetka.jpg|thumb|left|Mesolithic dancers at Bhimbetka]]\n\n[[archeology|Archeological]] evidence for early dance includes 9,000-year-old paintings in [[India]] at the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tomb paintings depicting dancing figures, dated c. 3300 BC.

[[Bharata Muni]]'s ''[[Natyashastra]]'' (literally ''\"the text of dramaturgy\"'') is one of the earlier texts. It mainly deals with drama, in which dance plays an important part in Indian culture. It categorizes dance into four types \u2013 secular, ritual, abstract, and, interpretive \u2013 and into four regional varieties. The text elaborates various hand-gestures (''[[mudras]]'') and classifies movements of the various limbs, steps and so on. A strong continuous tradition of dance has since continued in India, through to modern times, where it continues to play a role in culture, ritual, and, notably, the [[Bollywood]] entertainment industry. Many other [[contemporary dance]] forms can likewise be traced back to [[Historical dance|historical]], [[Traditional dance|traditional]], [[Ceremonial dance|ceremonial]], and [[List of dances sorted by ethnicity|ethnic]] dance.\n\n==Dance and music==\n{{main|Dance music}}\n[[File:Dancing girls in concert.jpg|thumb|right|Dancing girls in pop-concert, Sofia, Bulgaria.]]\nDance is generally, though not exclusively, performed with the accompaniment of music and may or may not be performed ''in [[time signature|time]]'' to such music. Some dance (such as [[tap dance]]) may provide its own audible accompaniment in place of (or in addition to) music. Many early forms of music and dance were created for each other and are frequently performed together. Notable examples of traditional dance/music couplings include the [[jig]], [[waltz]], [[Tango music|tango]], [[disco]], and [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]]. Some [[musical genre]]s have a parallel dance form such as [[baroque music]] and [[baroque dance]]; other varieties of dance and music may share nomenclature but developed separately, such as [[Classical music era|classical music]] and [[classical ballet]].\n\n== Dance and rhythm ==\n[[Rhythm]] and dance are deeply linked in history and practice. The American dancer [[Ted Shawn]] wrote; \"The conception of rhythm which underlies all studies of the dance is something about which we could talk forever, and still not finish.\"<ref name=\"Shawn 50\">Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, p. 50</ref> A musical rhythm requires two main elements; first, a regularly-repeating [[pulse (music)|pulse]] (also called the \"beat\" or \"tactus\") that establishes the [[tempo]] and, second, a pattern of [[Accent (music)|accents]] and [[Rest (music)|rests]] that establishes the character of the [[Meter (music)|metre or basic rhythmic pattern]]. The basic pulse is roughly equal in duration to a simple step or gesture.\n[[File:Tango rhythm.svg|thumb|A basic tango rhythm]]\nDances generally have a characteristic tempo and rhythmic pattern. The tango, for example, is usually danced in {{music|time|2|4}} time at approximately 66 beats per minute. The basic slow step, called a \"slow\", lasts for one beat, so that a full \"right\u2013left\" step is equal to one {{music|time|2|4}} measure. The basic forward and backward walk of the dance is so counted \u2013 \"slow-slow\" \u2013 while many additional figures are counted \"slow \u2013 quick-quick.<ref>Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing, ''Ballroom Dancing'', Teach Yourself Books, Hodder and Stoughton, 1977, p. 38</ref>\n\nJust as musical rhythms are defined by a pattern of strong and weak beats, so repetitive body movements often depends on alternating \"strong\" and \"weak\" muscular movements.<ref name=\"Kirstein 4\">Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 4</ref> Given this alternation of left-right, of forward-backward and rise-fall, along with the [[Symmetry in biology|bilateral symmetry]] of the human body, it is natural that many dances and much music are in [[duple and quadruple meter]]. However, since some such movements require more time in one phase than the other \u2013 such as the longer time required to lift a hammer than to strike \u2013 some dance rhythms fall equally naturally into [[triple metre]].<ref>Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, p. 49</ref> Occasionally, as in [[Music of Southeastern Europe|the folk dances of the Balkans]], dance traditions depend heavily on more complex rhythms. Further, complex dances composed of a fixed sequence of steps always require phrases and melodies of a certain fixed length to accompany that sequence.\n\n[[File:Lululaund - The Dancing Girl (painting and silk cloth. A.L. Baldry 1901, before p.107).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|''Lululaund \u2013 The Dancing Girl'' (painting and silk cloth. A.L. Baldry 1901, before p. 107), The inscription reads; \"Dancing is a form of rhythm/ Rhythm is a form of music/ Music is a form of thought/ And thought is a form of divinity.\"]]\nThe very act of dancing, the steps themselves, generate an \"initial skeleton of rhythmic beats\" that must have preceded any separate musical accompaniment, while dance itself, as much as music, requires time-keeping<ref>Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 3</ref> just as utilitarian repetitive movements such as walking, hauling and digging take on, as they become refined, something of the quality of dance.<ref name=\"Kirstein 4\"/>\n\nMusical accompaniment therefore arose in the earliest dance, so that ancient Egyptians attributed the origin of the dance to the divine Athotus, who was said to have observed that music accompanying religious rituals caused participants to move rhythmically and to have brought these movements into proportional measure. The same idea, that dance arises from musical rhythm, is still found in [[renaissance]] Europe in the works of the dancing master [[Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro]] who speaks of dance as a physical movement that arises from and expresses inward, spiritual motion agreeing with the \"measures and perfect concords of harmony\" that fall upon the human ear,<ref name=\"Kirstein 4\"/> while, earlier, [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]], seizing upon dance as a symbol of the holy life foreshadowed in Jesus' saying \"I have piped and ye have not danced\",<ref>Matthew 11:17</ref> writes;\n\n{{quote|I can not dance unless thou leadest.

Shawn concurs, stating that dance \"was the first art of the human race, and the matrix out of which all other arts grew\" and that even the \"[[Meter (poetry)|metre]] in our poetry today is a result of the accents necessitated by body movement, as the dancing and reciting were performed simultaneously\"<ref name=\"Shawn 50\"/> \u2013 an assertion somewhat supported by the common use of the term \"foot\" to describe the fundamental rhythmic units of poetry.\n\n[[Percy Scholes|Scholes]], not a dancer but a musician, offers support for this view, stating that the steady measures of music, of two, three or four beats to the bar, its equal and balanced phrases, regular cadences, contrasts and repetitions, may all be attributed to the \"incalculable\" influence of dance upon music.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scholes |first=Percy A. |authorlink1= Percy Scholes |title= The Oxford Companion to Music |edition= 10 |year= 1977 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= |chapter=Dance |ref= CITEREFScholes1977}}</ref>\n\n[[\u00c9mile Jaques-Dalcroze]], primarily a musician and teacher, relates how a study of the physical movements of pianists led him \"to the discovery that musical sensations of a rhythmic nature call for the muscular and nervous response of the whole organism\", to develop \"a special training designed to regulate nervous reactions and effect a co-ordination of muscles and nerves\" and ultimately to seek the connections between \"the art of music and the art of dance\", which he formulated into his system of [[Dalcroze Eurhythmics|eurhythmics]].<ref>\u00c9mile Jaques-Dalcroze, ''Rhythm, Music and Education'', 1973, The Dalcroze Society, London, p. viii</ref> He concluded that \"musical rhythm is only the transposition into sound of movements and dynamisms spontaneously and involuntarily expressing emotion\".<ref>\u00c9mile Jaques-Dalcroze, ''Rhythm, Music and Education'', 1973, The Dalcroze Society, London, p. 181</ref>\n\nHence, though doubtless, as Shawn asserts, \"it is quite possible to develop the dance without music and... music is perfectly capable of standing on its own feet without any assistance from the dance\", nevertheless the \"two arts will always be related and the relationship can be profitable both to the dance and to music\",<ref>Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, p. 54</ref> the precedence of one art over the other being a moot point. The [[Common metre|common ballad measures]] of hymns and folk-songs takes their name from dance, as does the [[Carol (music)|carol]], originally a [[circle dance]]. Many purely musical pieces have been named \"[[waltz]]\" or \"[[minuet]]\", for example, while many [[concert dance]]s have been produced that are based upon abstract musical pieces, such as ''[[2 and 3 Part Inventions]], [[Adams Violin Concerto]]'' and ''[[Andantino (ballet)|Andantino]]''. Similarly, poems are often structured and named after dances or musical works, while dance and music have both drawn their conception of \"measure\" or \"metre\" from poetry.\n\nShawn quotes with approval the statement of Dalcroze that, while the art of musical rhythm consists in differentiating and combining time durations, pauses and accents \"according to physiological law\", that of \"plastic rhythm\" (i.e. dance) \"is to designate movement in space, to interpret long time-values by slow movements and short ones by quick movements, regulate pauses by their divers successions and express sound accentuations in their multiple nuances by additions of bodily weight, by means of muscular innervations\".\n\nShawn nevertheless points out that the system of musical time is a \"man-made, artificial thing.... a manufactured tool, whereas rhythm is something that has always existed and depends on man not at all\", being \"the continuous flowing time which our human minds cut up into convenient units\", suggesting that music might be revivified by a return to the values and the time-perception of dancing.<ref>Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, pp. 50\u201351</ref>\n\nThe early-20th-century American dancer Helen Moller stated simply that \"it is rhythm and form more than harmony and color which, from the beginning, has bound music, poetry and dancing together in a union that is indissoluble.\"<ref>Moller, Helen and Dunham, Curtis, ''Dancing with Helen Moller'', 1918, John Lane (New York and London), p. 74</ref>\n\n==Approaches to dance==\n\n===Concert dance===\nConcert dance, like [[opera]], generally depends for its large-scale form upon a [[narrative]] [[dramatic structure]]. The movements and gestures of the [[choreography]] are primarily intended to [[mime]] the personality and aims of the characters and their part in the plot.<ref>Laban, Rudolf, ''The Mastery of Movement'', MacDonald and Evans, London, 1960, p. 2</ref> Such theatrical requirements tend towards longer, freer movements than those usual in non-narrative dance styles. On the other hand, the ''[[ballet blanc]]'', developed in the 19th century, allows interludes of rhythmic dance that developed into entirely \"plotless\" ballets in the 20th century<ref>Minden, Eliza Gaynor, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S-RuSzcrBnAC&dq=%22ballet+blanc%22&source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The Ballet Companion: A Dancer's Guide''], Simon and Schuster, 2007, p. 92</ref> and that allowed fast, rhythmic dance-steps such as those of the ''petit allegro''. A well-known example is ''[[Danse des petits cygnes|The Cygnets' Dance]]'' in act two of ''[[Swan Lake]]''.\n\nThe [[ballet]] developed out of courtly dramatic productions of 16th- and 17th-century France and Italy and for some time dancers performed dances developed from those familiar from the musical suite,<ref>Thoinot Arbeau, ''Orchesography'', trans. by Mary Stewart Evans, with notes by Julia Sutton, New York: Dover, 1967</ref> all of which were defined by definite rhythms closely identified with each dance. These appeared as [[character dance]]s in the era of [[romantic nationalism]].\n\nBallet reached widespread vogue in the romantic era, accompanied by a larger orchestra and grander musical conceptions that did not lend themselves easily to rhythmic clarity and by dance that emphasised dramatic mime. A broader concept of rhythm was needed, that which [[Rudolf Laban]] terms the \"rhythm and shape\" of movement that communicates character, emotion and intention,<ref>Laban, Rudolf, ''The Mastery of Movement'', MacDonald and Evans, London, 1960, pp. 2, 4 ''et passim''</ref> while only certain scenes required the exact synchronisation of step and music essential to other dance styles, so that, to Laban, modern Europeans seemed totally unable to grasp the meaning of \"primitive rhythmic movements\",<ref>Laban, Rudolf, ''The Mastery of Movement'', MacDonald and Evans, London, 1960, p. 86</ref> a situation that began to change in the 20th century with such productions as [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' with its new rhythmic language evoking primal feelings of a primitive past.<ref>Abigail Wagner, [https://www.lawrence.edu/mfhe/www_web_student/Everyone/A%20Different%20Type%20of%20Rhythm.pdf ''A Different Type of Rhythm''], Lawrence University, Wisconsin</ref>\n\nIndian classical dance styles, like ballet, are often in dramatic form, so that there is a similar complementarity between narrative expression and \"pure\" dance. In this case, however, the two are separately defined, though not always separately performed. The rhythmic elements, which are abstract and technical, are known as ''nritta''. Both this and expressive dance ''(nritya)'', though, are closely tied to the rhythmic system (''[[Tala (music)|tala]]''). Teachers have adapted the spoken rhythmic mnemonic system called ''[[Bol (music)|bol]]'' to the needs of dancers.\n\nJapanese classical dance-theatre styles such as [[Kabuki]] and [[Noh]], like Indian dance-drama, distinguish between narrative and abstract dance productions. The three main categories of kabuki are ''[[jidaimono]]'' (historical), ''[[sewamono]]'' (domestic) and ''[[shosagoto]]'' (dance pieces).<ref name=\"Kabuki MIT Global Shakespeares\">{{cite web | url=http://globalshakespeares.mit.edu/glossary/kabuki/ | title=Kabuki \u00ab MIT Global Shakespeares | accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref> Somewhat similarly, Noh distinguishes between ''Geki Noh'', based around the advancement of plot and the narration of action, and ''Fury\u016b Noh'', dance pieces involving acrobatics, stage properties, multiple characters and elaborate stage action.<ref name=\"Ortolani\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ge8cWl8OT3gC&pg=PA132&dq=mugen-no+Genzai-no+waki-no#v=onepage&q=mugen-no%20Genzai-no%20waki-no&f=false |page=132 |title=The Japanese theatre: from shamanistic ritual to contemporary pluralism |first=Benito |last=Ortolani| publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995 |isbn=978-0-691-04333-3}}</ref>\n\n===Participatory and social dance===\n[[Social dances]], those intended for participation rather than for an audience, may include various forms of mime and narrative, but are typically set much more closely to the rhythmic pattern of music, so that terms like [[waltz]] and [[polka]] refer as much to musical pieces as to the dance itself. The rhythm of the dancers' feet may even form an essential part of the music, as in [[tap dance]]. African dance, for example, is rooted in fixed basic steps, but may also allow a high degree of rhythmic interpretation: the feet or the trunk mark the basic pulse while cross-rhythms are picked up by shoulders, knees, or head, with the best dancers simultaneously giving plastic expression to all the elements of the [[polyrhythm]]ic pattern.<ref>Ayansu, E.S. and Whitfield, P.

It is widely known both as a style of music and a dance. It is mostly related to ancient harvest celebrations, love, patriotism or social issues. Its music is coordinated by a musical instrument called the 'Dhol'. Bhangra is not just music but a dance, a celebration of the harvest where people beat the dhol (drum), sing Boliyaan (lyrics) and dance. It developed further with the Vaisakhi festival of the [[Sikh]]s.\n\nThe [[dances of Sri Lanka]] include the devil dances (''yakun natima''), a carefully crafted ritual reaching far back into Sri Lanka's pre-Buddhist past that combines ancient \"[[Ayurvedic]]\" concepts of disease causation with [[psychological manipulation]] and combines many aspects including Sinhalese cosmology.

Some European folk dances such as the [[square dance]] were brought to the [[New World]] and subsequently became part of American culture.\n\n[[Ballet]] developed first in Italy and then in France from lavish court spectacles that combined music, drama, poetry, song, costumes and dance. Members of the court nobility took part as performers. During the reign of [[Louis XIV]], himself a dancer, dance became more codified. Professional dancers began to take the place of court amateurs, and ballet masters were licensed by the French government. The first ballet dance academy was the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Danse (Royal Dance Academy), opened in Paris in 1661. Shortly thereafter, the first institutionalized ballet troupe, associated with the Academy, was formed; this troupe began as an all-male ensemble but by 1681 opened to include women as well.<ref name=\"lecomte\"/>\n\n[[20th century concert dance]] brought an explosion of innovation in dance style characterized by an exploration of freer technique. Early pioneers of what became known as [[modern dance]] include [[Loie Fuller]], [[Isadora Duncan]], [[Mary Wigman]] and [[Ruth St. Denis]]. The relationship of music to dance serves as the basis for [[Eurhythmics]], devised by [[Emile Jaques-Dalcroze]], which was influential to the development of Modern dance and modern ballet through artists such as [[Marie Rambert]]. [[Eurythmy]], developed by [[Rudolf Steiner]] and [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers]], combines formal elements reminiscent of traditional dance with the new freer style, and introduced a complex new vocabulary to dance. In the 1920s, important founders of the new style such as [[Martha Graham]] and [[Doris Humphrey]] began their work. Since this time, a wide variety of dance styles have been developed; see [[Modern dance]].\n\n[[African American dance]] developed in everyday spaces, rather than in dance studios, schools or companies. [[Tap dance]], [[disco]], [[jazz dance]], [[swing dance]], [[hip hop dance]], the [[lindy hop]] with its relationship to [[rock and roll|rock and roll music]] and [[rock and roll (dance)|rock and roll dance]] have had a global influence.

Other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance-like quality, including [[martial arts]], [[gymnastics]], [[cheerleading]], [[figure skating]], [[synchronised swimming]], marching bands, and many other forms of athletics.\n\n==Performance and participation==\n[[File:GDC onlywayaround.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Members of an American jazz dance company perform a formal group routine in a concert dance setting]]\n\nTheatrical dance, also called performance or concert dance, is intended primarily as a spectacle, usually a [[performance]] upon a [[Stage (theater)|stage]] by [[virtuoso]] dancers. It often tells a [[narrative|story]], perhaps using [[Mime artist|mime]], [[Dance costumes|costume]] and [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]], or else it may simply [[Interpretive dance|interpret the musical accompaniment]], which is often specially composed. Examples are western [[ballet]] and [[modern dance]], [[Classical Indian dance]] and Chinese and Japanese song and dance dramas. Most classical forms are centred upon dance alone, but performance dance may also appear in [[opera]] and other forms of [[musical theatre]].\n\nParticipatory dance, on the other hand, whether it be a [[folk dance]], a [[social dance]], a [[group dance]] such as a [[Line dance|line]], [[Circle dance|circle]], [[Medieval dance#Other Chain Dances|chain]] or [[square dance]], or a [[partner dance]] such as is common in western [[Ballroom dance|Western ballroom dancing]], is undertaken primarily for a common purpose, such as [[social interaction]] or [[exercise]], of participants rather than onlookers. Such dance seldom has any narrative. A group dance and a ''[[corps de ballet]]'', a social partner dance and a ''[[pas de deux]]'', differ profoundly. Even a [[solo dance]] may be undertaken solely for the satisfaction of the dancer. Participatory dancers often all employ the same movements and steps but, for example, in the [[rave culture]] of [[electronic dance music]], vast crowds may engage in [[free dance]], uncoordinated with those around them. On the other hand, some cultures lay down strict rules as to the particular dances in which, for example, men, women and children may or must participate.\n\n==Origins==\n{{Main|History of Dance}}\n[[File:Dancing painting at Bhimbetka.jpg|thumb|left|Mesolithic dancers at Bhimbetka]]\n\n[[archeology|Archeological]] evidence for early dance includes 9,000-year-old paintings in [[India]] at the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tomb paintings depicting dancing figures, dated c. 3300 BC.

[[Bharata Muni]]'s ''[[Natyashastra]]'' (literally ''\"the text of dramaturgy\"'') is one of the earlier texts. It mainly deals with drama, in which dance plays an important part in Indian culture. It categorizes dance into four types \u2013 secular, ritual, abstract, and, interpretive \u2013 and into four regional varieties. The text elaborates various hand-gestures (''[[mudras]]'') and classifies movements of the various limbs, steps and so on. A strong continuous tradition of dance has since continued in India, through to modern times, where it continues to play a role in culture, ritual, and, notably, the [[Bollywood]] entertainment industry. Many other [[contemporary dance]] forms can likewise be traced back to [[Historical dance|historical]], [[Traditional dance|traditional]], [[Ceremonial dance|ceremonial]], and [[List of dances sorted by ethnicity|ethnic]] dance.\n\n==Dance and music==\n{{main|Dance music}}\n[[File:Dancing girls in concert.jpg|thumb|right|Dancing girls in pop-concert, Sofia, Bulgaria.]]\nDance is generally, though not exclusively, performed with the accompaniment of music and may or may not be performed ''in [[time signature|time]]'' to such music. Some dance (such as [[tap dance]]) may provide its own audible accompaniment in place of (or in addition to) music. Many early forms of music and dance were created for each other and are frequently performed together. Notable examples of traditional dance/music couplings include the [[jig]], [[waltz]], [[Tango music|tango]], [[disco]], and [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]]. Some [[musical genre]]s have a parallel dance form such as [[baroque music]] and [[baroque dance]]; other varieties of dance and music may share nomenclature but developed separately, such as [[Classical music era|classical music]] and [[classical ballet]].\n\n== Dance and rhythm ==\n[[Rhythm]] and dance are deeply linked in history and practice. The American dancer [[Ted Shawn]] wrote; \"The conception of rhythm which underlies all studies of the dance is something about which we could talk forever, and still not finish.\"<ref name=\"Shawn 50\">Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, p. 50</ref> A musical rhythm requires two main elements; first, a regularly-repeating [[pulse (music)|pulse]] (also called the \"beat\" or \"tactus\") that establishes the [[tempo]] and, second, a pattern of [[Accent (music)|accents]] and [[Rest (music)|rests]] that establishes the character of the [[Meter (music)|metre or basic rhythmic pattern]]. The basic pulse is roughly equal in duration to a simple step or gesture.\n[[File:Tango rhythm.svg|thumb|A basic tango rhythm]]\nDances generally have a characteristic tempo and rhythmic pattern. The tango, for example, is usually danced in {{music|time|2|4}} time at approximately 66 beats per minute. The basic slow step, called a \"slow\", lasts for one beat, so that a full \"right\u2013left\" step is equal to one {{music|time|2|4}} measure. The basic forward and backward walk of the dance is so counted \u2013 \"slow-slow\" \u2013 while many additional figures are counted \"slow \u2013 quick-quick.<ref>Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing, ''Ballroom Dancing'', Teach Yourself Books, Hodder and Stoughton, 1977, p. 38</ref>\n\nJust as musical rhythms are defined by a pattern of strong and weak beats, so repetitive body movements often depends on alternating \"strong\" and \"weak\" muscular movements.<ref name=\"Kirstein 4\">Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 4</ref> Given this alternation of left-right, of forward-backward and rise-fall, along with the [[Symmetry in biology|bilateral symmetry]] of the human body, it is natural that many dances and much music are in [[duple and quadruple meter]]. However, since some such movements require more time in one phase than the other \u2013 such as the longer time required to lift a hammer than to strike \u2013 some dance rhythms fall equally naturally into [[triple metre]].<ref>Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, p. 49</ref> Occasionally, as in [[Music of Southeastern Europe|the folk dances of the Balkans]], dance traditions depend heavily on more complex rhythms. Further, complex dances composed of a fixed sequence of steps always require phrases and melodies of a certain fixed length to accompany that sequence.\n\n[[File:Lululaund - The Dancing Girl (painting and silk cloth. A.L. Baldry 1901, before p.107).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|''Lululaund \u2013 The Dancing Girl'' (painting and silk cloth. A.L. Baldry 1901, before p. 107), The inscription reads; \"Dancing is a form of rhythm/ Rhythm is a form of music/ Music is a form of thought/ And thought is a form of divinity.\"]]\nThe very act of dancing, the steps themselves, generate an \"initial skeleton of rhythmic beats\" that must have preceded any separate musical accompaniment, while dance itself, as much as music, requires time-keeping<ref>Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 3</ref> just as utilitarian repetitive movements such as walking, hauling and digging take on, as they become refined, something of the quality of dance.<ref name=\"Kirstein 4\"/>\n\nMusical accompaniment therefore arose in the earliest dance, so that ancient Egyptians attributed the origin of the dance to the divine Athotus, who was said to have observed that music accompanying religious rituals caused participants to move rhythmically and to have brought these movements into proportional measure. The same idea, that dance arises from musical rhythm, is still found in [[renaissance]] Europe in the works of the dancing master [[Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro]] who speaks of dance as a physical movement that arises from and expresses inward, spiritual motion agreeing with the \"measures and perfect concords of harmony\" that fall upon the human ear,<ref name=\"Kirstein 4\"/> while, earlier, [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]], seizing upon dance as a symbol of the holy life foreshadowed in Jesus' saying \"I have piped and ye have not danced\",<ref>Matthew 11:17</ref> writes;\n\n{{quote|I can not dance unless thou leadest. If thou wouldst have me spring aloft, sing thou and I will spring, into love and from love to knowledge and from knowledge to ecstasy above all human sense<ref>Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 108</ref>}}\n\n[[Thoinot Arbeau]]'s celebrated 16th century dance-treatise ''Orch\u00e9sographie'', indeed, begins with definitions of over eighty distinct drum-rhythms.<ref>Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 157</ref>\n\n[[File:Dancing with Helen Moller; her own statement of her philosophy and practice and teaching formed upon the classic Greek model, and adapted to meet the aesthetic and hygienic needs of to-day, with (14784705065).jpg|thumb|right|Helen Moller]]\nAs has been shown above, dance has been represented through the ages as having emerged as a response to music yet, as [[Lincoln Kirstein]] implied, it is at least as likely that primitive music arose from dance. Shawn concurs, stating that dance \"was the first art of the human race, and the matrix out of which all other arts grew\" and that even the \"[[Meter (poetry)|metre]] in our poetry today is a result of the accents necessitated by body movement, as the dancing and reciting were performed simultaneously\"<ref name=\"Shawn 50\"/> \u2013 an assertion somewhat supported by the common use of the term \"foot\" to describe the fundamental rhythmic units of poetry.\n\n[[Percy Scholes|Scholes]], not a dancer but a musician, offers support for this view, stating that the steady measures of music, of two, three or four beats to the bar, its equal and balanced phrases, regular cadences, contrasts and repetitions, may all be attributed to the \"incalculable\" influence of dance upon music.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scholes |first=Percy A. |authorlink1= Percy Scholes |title= The Oxford Companion to Music |edition= 10 |year= 1977 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= |chapter=Dance |ref= CITEREFScholes1977}}</ref>\n\n[[\u00c9mile Jaques-Dalcroze]], primarily a musician and teacher, relates how a study of the physical movements of pianists led him \"to the discovery that musical sensations of a rhythmic nature call for the muscular and nervous response of the whole organism\", to develop \"a special training designed to regulate nervous reactions and effect a co-ordination of muscles and nerves\" and ultimately to seek the connections between \"the art of music and the art of dance\", which he formulated into his system of [[Dalcroze Eurhythmics|eurhythmics]].<ref>\u00c9mile Jaques-Dalcroze, ''Rhythm, Music and Education'', 1973, The Dalcroze Society, London, p. viii</ref> He concluded that \"musical rhythm is only the transposition into sound of movements and dynamisms spontaneously and involuntarily expressing emotion\".<ref>\u00c9mile Jaques-Dalcroze, ''Rhythm, Music and Education'', 1973, The Dalcroze Society, London, p. 181</ref>\n\nHence, though doubtless, as Shawn asserts, \"it is quite possible to develop the dance without music and... music is perfectly capable of standing on its own feet without any assistance from the dance\", nevertheless the \"two arts will always be related and the relationship can be profitable both to the dance and to music\",<ref>Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, p. 54</ref> the precedence of one art over the other being a moot point. The [[Common metre|common ballad measures]] of hymns and folk-songs takes their name from dance, as does the [[Carol (music)|carol]], originally a [[circle dance]]. Many purely musical pieces have been named \"[[waltz]]\" or \"[[minuet]]\", for example, while many [[concert dance]]s have been produced that are based upon abstract musical pieces, such as ''[[2 and 3 Part Inventions]], [[Adams Violin Concerto]]'' and ''[[Andantino (ballet)|Andantino]]''. Similarly, poems are often structured and named after dances or musical works, while dance and music have both drawn their conception of \"measure\" or \"metre\" from poetry.\n\nShawn quotes with approval the statement of Dalcroze that, while the art of musical rhythm consists in differentiating and combining time durations, pauses and accents \"according to physiological law\", that of \"plastic rhythm\" (i.e. dance) \"is to designate movement in space, to interpret long time-values by slow movements and short ones by quick movements, regulate pauses by their divers successions and express sound accentuations in their multiple nuances by additions of bodily weight, by means of muscular innervations\".\n\nShawn nevertheless points out that the system of musical time is a \"man-made, artificial thing.... a manufactured tool, whereas rhythm is something that has always existed and depends on man not at all\", being \"the continuous flowing time which our human minds cut up into convenient units\", suggesting that music might be revivified by a return to the values and the time-perception of dancing.<ref>Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, pp. 50\u201351</ref>\n\nThe early-20th-century American dancer Helen Moller stated simply that \"it is rhythm and form more than harmony and color which, from the beginning, has bound music, poetry and dancing together in a union that is indissoluble.\"<ref>Moller, Helen and Dunham, Curtis, ''Dancing with Helen Moller'', 1918, John Lane (New York and London), p. 74</ref>\n\n==Approaches to dance==\n\n===Concert dance===\nConcert dance, like [[opera]], generally depends for its large-scale form upon a [[narrative]] [[dramatic structure]]. The movements and gestures of the [[choreography]] are primarily intended to [[mime]] the personality and aims of the characters and their part in the plot.<ref>Laban, Rudolf, ''The Mastery of Movement'', MacDonald and Evans, London, 1960, p. 2</ref> Such theatrical requirements tend towards longer, freer movements than those usual in non-narrative dance styles. On the other hand, the ''[[ballet blanc]]'', developed in the 19th century, allows interludes of rhythmic dance that developed into entirely \"plotless\" ballets in the 20th century<ref>Minden, Eliza Gaynor, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S-RuSzcrBnAC&dq=%22ballet+blanc%22&source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The Ballet Companion: A Dancer's Guide''], Simon and Schuster, 2007, p. 92</ref> and that allowed fast, rhythmic dance-steps such as those of the ''petit allegro''. A well-known example is ''[[Danse des petits cygnes|The Cygnets' Dance]]'' in act two of ''[[Swan Lake]]''.\n\nThe [[ballet]] developed out of courtly dramatic productions of 16th- and 17th-century France and Italy and for some time dancers performed dances developed from those familiar from the musical suite,<ref>Thoinot Arbeau, ''Orchesography'', trans. by Mary Stewart Evans, with notes by Julia Sutton, New York: Dover, 1967</ref> all of which were defined by definite rhythms closely identified with each dance. These appeared as [[character dance]]s in the era of [[romantic nationalism]].\n\nBallet reached widespread vogue in the romantic era, accompanied by a larger orchestra and grander musical conceptions that did not lend themselves easily to rhythmic clarity and by dance that emphasised dramatic mime. A broader concept of rhythm was needed, that which [[Rudolf Laban]] terms the \"rhythm and shape\" of movement that communicates character, emotion and intention,<ref>Laban, Rudolf, ''The Mastery of Movement'', MacDonald and Evans, London, 1960, pp. 2, 4 ''et passim''</ref> while only certain scenes required the exact synchronisation of step and music essential to other dance styles, so that, to Laban, modern Europeans seemed totally unable to grasp the meaning of \"primitive rhythmic movements\",<ref>Laban, Rudolf, ''The Mastery of Movement'', MacDonald and Evans, London, 1960, p. 86</ref> a situation that began to change in the 20th century with such productions as [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' with its new rhythmic language evoking primal feelings of a primitive past.<ref>Abigail Wagner, [https://www.lawrence.edu/mfhe/www_web_student/Everyone/A%20Different%20Type%20of%20Rhythm.pdf ''A Different Type of Rhythm''], Lawrence University, Wisconsin</ref>\n\nIndian classical dance styles, like ballet, are often in dramatic form, so that there is a similar complementarity between narrative expression and \"pure\" dance. In this case, however, the two are separately defined, though not always separately performed. The rhythmic elements, which are abstract and technical, are known as ''nritta''. Both this and expressive dance ''(nritya)'', though, are closely tied to the rhythmic system (''[[Tala (music)|tala]]''). Teachers have adapted the spoken rhythmic mnemonic system called ''[[Bol (music)|bol]]'' to the needs of dancers.\n\nJapanese classical dance-theatre styles such as [[Kabuki]] and [[Noh]], like Indian dance-drama, distinguish between narrative and abstract dance productions. The three main categories of kabuki are ''[[jidaimono]]'' (historical), ''[[sewamono]]'' (domestic) and ''[[shosagoto]]'' (dance pieces).<ref name=\"Kabuki MIT Global Shakespeares\">{{cite web | url=http://globalshakespeares.mit.edu/glossary/kabuki/ | title=Kabuki \u00ab MIT Global Shakespeares | accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref> Somewhat similarly, Noh distinguishes between ''Geki Noh'', based around the advancement of plot and the narration of action, and ''Fury\u016b Noh'', dance pieces involving acrobatics, stage properties, multiple characters and elaborate stage action.<ref name=\"Ortolani\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ge8cWl8OT3gC&pg=PA132&dq=mugen-no+Genzai-no+waki-no#v=onepage&q=mugen-no%20Genzai-no%20waki-no&f=false |page=132 |title=The Japanese theatre: from shamanistic ritual to contemporary pluralism |first=Benito |last=Ortolani| publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995 |isbn=978-0-691-04333-3}}</ref>\n\n===Participatory and social dance===\n[[Social dances]], those intended for participation rather than for an audience, may include various forms of mime and narrative, but are typically set much more closely to the rhythmic pattern of music, so that terms like [[waltz]] and [[polka]] refer as much to musical pieces as to the dance itself. The rhythm of the dancers' feet may even form an essential part of the music, as in [[tap dance]]. African dance, for example, is rooted in fixed basic steps, but may also allow a high degree of rhythmic interpretation: the feet or the trunk mark the basic pulse while cross-rhythms are picked up by shoulders, knees, or head, with the best dancers simultaneously giving plastic expression to all the elements of the [[polyrhythm]]ic pattern.<ref>Ayansu, E.S. and Whitfield, P.

Indian classical music provides accompaniment and dancers of nearly all the styles wear bells around their ankles to counterpoint and complement the percussion.\n\nThere are now many regional varieties of [[Indian classical dance]]. Dances like ''\"Odra Magadhi\"'', which after decades long debate, has been traced to present day Mithila, [[Odisha]] region's dance form of [[Odissi]] (Orissi), indicate influence of dances in cultural interactions between different regions.<ref>[http://www.exoticindiaart.com/article/dance Exoticindiaart.com], Dance: The Living Spirit of Indian Arts, by Prof. P.C. Jain and Dr. Daljeet.</ref>\n\nThe [[Punjab region|Punjab]] area overlapping India and [[Pakistan]] is the place of origin of [[Bhangra (dance)|Bhangra]]. It is widely known both as a style of music and a dance. It is mostly related to ancient harvest celebrations, love, patriotism or social issues. Its music is coordinated by a musical instrument called the 'Dhol'. Bhangra is not just music but a dance, a celebration of the harvest where people beat the dhol (drum), sing Boliyaan (lyrics) and dance. It developed further with the Vaisakhi festival of the [[Sikh]]s.\n\nThe [[dances of Sri Lanka]] include the devil dances (''yakun natima''), a carefully crafted ritual reaching far back into Sri Lanka's pre-Buddhist past that combines ancient \"[[Ayurvedic]]\" concepts of disease causation with [[psychological manipulation]] and combines many aspects including Sinhalese cosmology. Their influence can be seen on the [[classical dances of Sri Lanka]].<ref>[http://www.lankalibrary.com/rit/yakun%20natuma.htm Lankalibrary.com], \"The yakun natima&nbsp;\u2014 devil dance ritual of Sri Lanka\"</ref>\n\n[[File:NutcrackerSnowPas.JPG|thumb|right|Two classical ballet dancers perform a sequence of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', one of the best known works of classical dance]]\n[[File:Dance-At-Bougival.jpg|thumb|''[[Dance at Bougival]]'' by [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] (1883)]]\nThe [[Middle Eastern dance|dances of the Middle East]] are usually the traditional forms of [[circle dance|circle dancing]] which are modernized to an extent.

Some European folk dances such as the [[square dance]] were brought to the [[New World]] and subsequently became part of American culture.\n\n[[Ballet]] developed first in Italy and then in France from lavish court spectacles that combined music, drama, poetry, song, costumes and dance. Members of the court nobility took part as performers. During the reign of [[Louis XIV]], himself a dancer, dance became more codified. Professional dancers began to take the place of court amateurs, and ballet masters were licensed by the French government. The first ballet dance academy was the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Danse (Royal Dance Academy), opened in Paris in 1661. Shortly thereafter, the first institutionalized ballet troupe, associated with the Academy, was formed; this troupe began as an all-male ensemble but by 1681 opened to include women as well.<ref name=\"lecomte\"/>\n\n[[20th century concert dance]] brought an explosion of innovation in dance style characterized by an exploration of freer technique. Early pioneers of what became known as [[modern dance]] include [[Loie Fuller]], [[Isadora Duncan]], [[Mary Wigman]] and [[Ruth St. Denis]]. The relationship of music to dance serves as the basis for [[Eurhythmics]], devised by [[Emile Jaques-Dalcroze]], which was influential to the development of Modern dance and modern ballet through artists such as [[Marie Rambert]]. [[Eurythmy]], developed by [[Rudolf Steiner]] and [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers]], combines formal elements reminiscent of traditional dance with the new freer style, and introduced a complex new vocabulary to dance. In the 1920s, important founders of the new style such as [[Martha Graham]] and [[Doris Humphrey]] began their work. Since this time, a wide variety of dance styles have been developed; see [[Modern dance]].\n\n[[African American dance]] developed in everyday spaces, rather than in dance studios, schools or companies. [[Tap dance]], [[disco]], [[jazz dance]], [[swing dance]], [[hip hop dance]], the [[lindy hop]] with its relationship to [[rock and roll|rock and roll music]] and [[rock and roll (dance)|rock and roll dance]] have had a global influence.

The professional life of a dancer is generally one of constantly changing work situations, strong competitive pressure and low pay. Consequently, professional dancers often must supplement their incomes to achieve financial stability. In the U.S. many professional dancers belong to unions (such as the [[American Guild of Musical Artists]], [[Screen Actors Guild]] and [[Actors' Equity Association]]) that establish working conditions and minimum salaries for their members. Professional dancers must possess large amounts of athleticism. To lead a successful career, it is advantageous to be versatile in many styles of dance, have a strong technical background and to utilize other forms of physical training to remain fit and healthy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sagolla|first=Lisa|date=April 24, 2008|title=Untitled|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=fa35d8ae-239b-4764-b82f-f58a07a15475%40sessionmgr4006&vid=11&hid=4104&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=32038206&db=ibh|journal=International Bibliography of Theatre & Dance with Full Text|volume= 15| issue = 17 |page=1}}</ref>\n\n===Dance teachers===\nDance teachers typically focus on teaching dance performance, or coaching competitive dancers, or both. They typically have performance experience in the types of dance they teach or coach. For example, [[dancesport]] teachers and coaches are often tournament dancers or former dancesport performers. Dance teachers may be self-employed, or employed by [[dance school]]s or general education institutions with dance programs. Some work for university programs or other schools that are associated with professional classical dance (e.g., ballet) or modern dance companies. Others are employed by smaller, privately owned dance schools that offer dance training and performance coaching for various types of dance.\n\n===Choreographers===\n[[Choreography (dance)|Choreographers]] are the ones that design the dancing movements within a dance, they are often university trained and are typically employed for particular projects or, more rarely may work on contract as the resident choreographer for a specific dance company.\n\n==Competitions==\n[[File:MIT 2006 Standard Prechamp Final 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.45|An amateur dancesport competition, featuring the [[Viennese Waltz]]]]\n\nA '''dance competition''' is an organized event in which contestants perform dances before a judge or judges for awards, and in some cases, monetary prizes.

{"title_page": "Electronic communication network", "text_new": "{{Distinguish|Computer network}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Update|date=May 2015}}\n{{refimprove|date=February 2012}}\n}}\nAn '''electronic communication network''' ('''ECN''') is a type of computerized forum or network that facilitates the trading of financial products outside traditional [[stock exchange]]s. An ECN is generally an electronic system that widely disseminates orders entered by market makers to third parties and permits the orders to be executed against in whole or in part. The primary products that are traded on ECNs are [[stock]]s and [[currency|currencies]]. ECNs are generally passive computer-driven networks that internally match limit orders and charge a very small per share transaction fee (often a fraction of a cent per share).<ref>Lemke and Lins, ''Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities'', \u00a72:27 (Thomson West, 2013-2014 ed.).</ref>  \n\nThe first ECN, [[Instinet]], was created in 1969. ECNs increase competition among trading firms by lowering transaction costs, giving clients full access to their order books, and offering [[Order matching system|order matching]] outside traditional exchange hours.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} ECNs are sometimes also referred to as [[alternative trading system]]s or alternative trading networks.\n\n==Function==\nTo trade with an ECN, one must be a subscriber or have an account with a broker that provides [[direct access trading]]. ECN subscribers can enter [[Order (exchange)|orders]] into the ECN via a custom computer terminal or network protocols. The ECN will then match contra-side orders (i.e. a sell-order is \"contra-side\" to a buy-order with the same price and share count) for execution. The ECN will post unmatched orders on the system for other subscribers to view. Generally, the buyer and seller are anonymous, with the trade execution reports listing the ECN as the party.\n\nSome ECN brokers may offer additional features to subscribers such as negotiation, reserve size, and pegging, and may have access to the entire ECN book (as opposed to the \"top of the book\") that real-time market data regarding depth of trading interest.\n\nECNs are generally facilitated by electronic negotiation, a type of communication between agents that allows cooperative and competitive sharing of information to determine a proper price.\n\n===Negotiation types===\nThe most common paradigm is the electronic [[auction]] type.  As of 2005, most [[e-business]] negotiation systems can only support price negotiations. Traditional negotiations typically include discussion of other attributes of a deal, such as delivery terms or payment conditions. This one-dimensional approach is one of the reasons why electronic markets struggle for acceptance.  Multiattributive and [[combinatorial auction]] mechanisms are emerging to allow further types of negotiation.\n\nSupport for complex multi-attribute negotiations is a [[critical success factor]] for the next generation of electronic markets and, more generally, for all types of electronic exchanges. This is what the second type of '''electronic negotiation''', namely Negotiation Support, addresses. While [[auction]]s are essentially mechanisms, bargaining is often the only choice in complex cases or those cases where no choice of partners is given.  Bargaining is a hard, error-prone, ambiguous task often performed under time pressure. [[Information technology]] has some potential to facilitate negotiation processes which are analyzed in research projects/prototypes such as INSPIRE, Negoisst or WebNS.\n\nThe third type of negotiation is automated argumentation, where agents exchange not only values, but also arguments for their offers/counter-offers. This requires agents to be able to reason about the mental states of other market participants.\n\n===Technologies===\nOne research area that has paid particular attention to modeling automated negotiations is that of [[autonomous agent]]s. If negotiations occur frequently, possibly on a minute per minute basis in order to schedule network capacity, or negotiation topics can be clearly defined it may be desirable to automate this coordination.\n\nAutomated negotiation is a key form of interaction in complex systems composed of autonomous agents. Negotiation is a process of making offers and counteroffers, with the aim of finding an acceptable agreement. During negotiation, each offer is based on its own utility and expectation of what other . This means that a multi criteria decision making is need to be taken for each offer.\n\n==In the stock market==\nFor stock trading, ECNs exist as a class of SEC-permitted [[alternative trading system]]s (ATS). As an ATS, ECNs exclude broker-dealers' internal [[crossing network]]s \u2013 i.e., systems that match orders in private using prices from a public exchange. \nECNs, as alternative trading systems, have increased competition with institutional trading systems. Alternative trading systems have been found to have lower execution costs, however as new ECNs emerge, some of this cost reduction has dissipated.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Conrad|first1=Jennifer|title=Institutional Trading and Alternative Trading Systems|journal=Journal of Financial Economics|date=2003|volume=70|issue=1|doi=10.1016/s0304-405x(03)00143-0|pages=99\u2013134}}</ref> Simultaneously, the growth of ECNs has been found to disrupt institutional trading. An analysis of impact of ECNs on NASDAQ found \"tighter spreads, greater depths, and less concentrated markets\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fink|first1=Jason|title=Competition on the NASDAQ and the Growth of Electronic Communication Networks|journal=Journal of Banking of Finance|date=2006|volume=30|issue=9}}</ref> ECNs provide historical orders and price data to subscribers. As a result, ECNs compete through their ability to attract \"more informed orders\" during \"periods of high volume and return volatility\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barclay|first1=Michael|title=Electronic Communications Networks and Market Quality|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal}}</ref> Today \"ECN\u2019s capture 40% of the volume in NASDAQ securities\", and are considerably changing the securities trading market<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hendershott|first1=T|title=Electronic Trading in Financial Markets|date=2003}}</ref> (Hendershott).\n\nECNs have influenced the stock market by eliminating dealer functions in order-matching. With the automation of orders on mass scale, the role of intermediary traders has been reconfigured. While the ECNs don\u2019t execute decision-making algorithms to the extent of algorithmic trading, nevertheless they have impacted the role of human traders in financial exchange.\n\n==Fee structure==\nECN's fee structure can be grouped in two basic structures: a classic structure and a credit (or rebate) structure. Both fee structures offer advantages of their own. The classic structure tends to attract liquidity removers while the credit structure appeals to liquidity providers. However, since both removers and providers of liquidity are necessary to create a market, ECNs must choose their fee structures carefully.\n\nIn a credit structure ECNs make a profit from paying liquidity providers a credit while charging a debit to liquidity removers. Credits range from $0.002 to $0.00295 per share for liquidity providers, and debits from $0.0025 to $0.003 per share for liquidity removers. The fee can be determined by monthly volume provided and removed, or by a fixed structure, depending on the ECN. This structure is common on the [[NASDAQ]] market. [http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=PriceListTrading2 NASDAQ Price List]. Traders commonly quote the fees in millicents or mils (e.g. $0.00295 is 29.5 mils).\n\nIn a classic structure, the ECN will charge a small fee to all market participants using their network, both liquidity providers and removers. They also can attract volume to their networks by giving lower prices to large liquidity providers. Fees for ECNs that operate under a classic structure range from $0 to $0.0015, or even higher depending on each ECN. This fee structure is more common in the [[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE]], however recently some ECNs have moved their NYSE operations into a credit structure.\n\n==Currency trading==\nThe first ECN for internet currency trading was New-York based [[Matchbook FX]] formed in 1999. Back then, all the prices were created & supplied by Matchbook FX's traders/users, including banks, within its ECN network. This was quite unique at the time, as it empowered buy-side FX market participants, historically always \"price takers\", to finally be price makers as well. Today, multiple FX ECNs provide access to an electronic trading network, supplied with streaming quotes from the top tier banks in the world. Their matching engines perform limit checks and match orders, usually in less than 100 milliseconds per order. The matching is quote driven and these are the prices that match against all orders. \n\nSpreads are discretionary but in general multibank competition creates 1-2 pip spreads on USD Majors and Euro Crosses. The order book is not a routing system that sends orders to individual market makers. It is a live exchange type book working against the best bid/offer of all quotes. By trading through an ECN, a currency trader generally benefits from greater price [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]], faster processing, increased [[market liquidity|liquidity]] and more availability in the marketplace. [[Bank]]s also reduce their costs as there is less manual effort involved in using an ECN for trading.\n\n==History==\nThe term ECN was used by the SEC to define, \"any electronic system that widely disseminates to third parties orders entered therein by an exchange market maker or OTC market maker, and permits such orders to be executed against in whole or in part\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Regulation NMS SEC Act Release No 51808|url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-51808.pdf}}</ref> The first ECN, the Instinet, was released in 1969 and provided an early application of the advances in computing.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Stafford|title=Equity Markets and Portfolio Analysis|date=2014|publisher=John Wiley & Songs}}</ref> The spread of ECNs was encouraged through changes in regulatory law set forth by the SEC, and in 1975 the SEC adopted the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, encouraging the \"linking of all markets for qualified securities through communication and data processing facilities\".<ref>{{cite web|title=The 1975 SEC Act Amendments|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-89/pdf/STATUTE-89-Pg97.pdf}}</ref>\n\nECNs have complicated stock exchanges through their interaction with NASDAQ. One of the key developments in the history of ECNs was the [[NASDAQ]] over-the-counter [[quotation system]]. NASDAQ was created following a 1969 [[American Stock Exchange]] study which estimated that errors in the processing of handwritten securities orders cost brokerage firms approximately $100 million per year. The NASDAQ system automated such order processing and provided brokers with the latest competitive price quotes via a computer terminal. In March 1994, a study by two economists, William Christie and Paul Schultz, noted that NASDAQ [[bid\u2013ask spread]]s were larger than was statistically likely, indicating \"We are unable to envision any scenario in which 40 to 60 dealers who are competing for [[Payment for order flow|order flow]] would simultaneously and consistently avoid using odd-eighth quotes without an implicit agreement to post quotes only on the even price fractions. However, our data do not provide direct evidence of tacit collusion among NASDAQ market makers\".\n\nThese results led to an [[Nasdaq Market Makers Antitrust Litigation|antitrust lawsuit]] being filed against NASDAQ. As part of NASDAQ's settlement of the antitrust charges, NASDAQ adopted new order handling rules that integrated ECNs into the NASDAQ system. Shortly after this settlement, the SEC adopted [[Alternative trading system|Regulation ATS]], which permitted ECNs the option of registering as stock exchanges or else being regulated under a separate set of standards for ECNs.<ref name=\"Christie94\">Christie, William G. and Schultz, Paul H.

However, increasingly ECNs have adopted an \"open book\" format, addressing the potential fragmented liquidity by integrating orders with those of other ECNs or market makers, thus increasing the overall pool of orders.<ref>Lemke and Lins, ''Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities'', \u00a72:27 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.).</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[TAE connector|TAE]]\n* [[Extended hours trading]]\n* [[NASDAQ]]\n* [[NYSE Arca]]\n* [[Inet]]\n* [[Island ECN]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.sec.gov/news/studies/ecnafter.htm Special Study: Electronic Communication Networks and After-Hours Trading]\n* [https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrecn.shtml ECNs/Alternative Trading Systems]\n\n{{stock market}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Electronic Communication Network}}\n[[Category:Stock market]]\n", "text_old": "{{Distinguish|Computer network}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Update|date=May 2015}}\n{{refimprove|date=February 2012}}\n}}\nAn '''electronic communication network''' ('''ECN''') is a type of computerized forum or network that facilitates the trading of financial products outside traditional [[stock exchange]]s.

ECNs increase competition among trading firms by lowering transaction costs, giving clients full access to their order books, and offering [[Order matching system|order matching]] outside traditional exchange hours.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} ECNs are sometimes also referred to as [[alternative trading system]]s or alternative trading networks.\n\n==Function==\nTo trade with an ECN, one must be a subscriber or have an account with a broker that provides [[direct access trading]]. ECN subscribers can enter [[Order (exchange)|orders]] into the ECN via a custom computer terminal or network protocols. The ECN will then match contra-side orders (i.e. a sell-order is \"contra-side\" to a buy-order with the same price and share count) for execution. The ECN will post unmatched orders on the system for other subscribers to view. Generally, the buyer and seller are anonymous, with the trade execution reports listing the ECN as the party.\n\nSome ECN brokers may offer additional features to subscribers such as negotiation, reserve size, and pegging, and may have access to the entire ECN book (as opposed to the \"top of the book\") that real-time market data regarding depth of trading interest.\n\nECNs are generally facilitated by electronic negotiation, a type of communication between agents that allows cooperative and competitive sharing of information to determine a proper price.\n\n===Negotiation types===\nThe most common paradigm is the electronic [[auction]] type.  As of 2005, most [[e-business]] negotiation systems can only support price negotiations. Traditional negotiations typically include discussion of other attributes of a deal, such as delivery terms or payment conditions. This one-dimensional approach is one of the reasons why electronic markets struggle for acceptance.  Multiattributive and [[combinatorial auction]] mechanisms are emerging to allow further types of negotiation.\n\nSupport for complex multi-attribute negotiations is a [[critical success factor]] for the next generation of electronic markets and, more generally, for all types of electronic exchanges. This is what the second type of '''electronic negotiation''', namely Negotiation Support, addresses. While [[auction]]s are essentially mechanisms, bargaining is often the only choice in complex cases or those cases where no choice of partners is given.  Bargaining is a hard, error-prone, ambiguous task often performed under time pressure. [[Information technology]] has some potential to facilitate negotiation processes which are analyzed in research projects/prototypes such as INSPIRE, Negoisst or WebNS.\n\nThe third type of negotiation is automated argumentation, where agents exchange not only values, but also arguments for their offers/counter-offers. This requires agents to be able to reason about the mental states of other market participants.\n\n===Technologies===\nOne research area that has paid particular attention to modeling automated negotiations is that of [[autonomous agent]]s. If negotiations occur frequently, possibly on a minute per minute basis in order to schedule network capacity, or negotiation topics can be clearly defined it may be desirable to automate this coordination.\n\nAutomated negotiation is a key form of interaction in complex systems composed of autonomous agents. Negotiation is a process of making offers and counteroffers, with the aim of finding an acceptable agreement. During negotiation, each offer is based on its own utility and expectation of what other . This means that a multi criteria decision making is need to be taken for each offer.\n\n==In the stock market==\nFor stock trading, ECNs exist as a class of SEC-permitted [[alternative trading system]]s (ATS). As an ATS, ECNs exclude broker-dealers' internal [[crossing network]]s \u2013 i.e., systems that match orders in private using prices from a public exchange. \nECNs, as alternative trading systems, have increased competition with institutional trading systems. Alternative trading systems have been found to have lower execution costs, however as new ECNs emerge, some of this cost reduction has dissipated.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Conrad|first1=Jennifer|title=Institutional Trading and Alternative Trading Systems|journal=Journal of Financial Economics|date=2003|volume=70|issue=1|doi=10.1016/s0304-405x(03)00143-0}}</ref> Simultaneously, the growth of ECNs has been found to disrupt institutional trading. An analysis of impact of ECNs on NASDAQ found \"tighter spreads, greater depths, and less concentrated markets\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fink|first1=Jason|title=Competition on the NASDAQ and the Growth of Electronic Communication Networks|journal=Journal of Banking of Finance|date=2006|volume=30|issue=9}}</ref> ECNs provide historical orders and price data to subscribers. As a result, ECNs compete through their ability to attract \"more informed orders\" during \"periods of high volume and return volatility\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barclay|first1=Michael|title=Electronic Communications Networks and Market Quality|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal}}</ref> Today \"ECN\u2019s capture 40% of the volume in NASDAQ securities\", and are considerably changing the securities trading market<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hendershott|first1=T|title=Electronic Trading in Financial Markets|date=2003}}</ref> (Hendershott).\n\nECNs have influenced the stock market by eliminating dealer functions in order-matching. With the automation of orders on mass scale, the role of intermediary traders has been reconfigured. While the ECNs don\u2019t execute decision-making algorithms to the extent of algorithmic trading, nevertheless they have impacted the role of human traders in financial exchange.\n\n==Fee structure==\nECN's fee structure can be grouped in two basic structures: a classic structure and a credit (or rebate) structure. Both fee structures offer advantages of their own. The classic structure tends to attract liquidity removers while the credit structure appeals to liquidity providers. However, since both removers and providers of liquidity are necessary to create a market, ECNs must choose their fee structures carefully.\n\nIn a credit structure ECNs make a profit from paying liquidity providers a credit while charging a debit to liquidity removers. Credits range from $0.002 to $0.00295 per share for liquidity providers, and debits from $0.0025 to $0.003 per share for liquidity removers. The fee can be determined by monthly volume provided and removed, or by a fixed structure, depending on the ECN. This structure is common on the [[NASDAQ]] market. [http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=PriceListTrading2 NASDAQ Price List]. Traders commonly quote the fees in millicents or mils (e.g. $0.00295 is 29.5 mils).\n\nIn a classic structure, the ECN will charge a small fee to all market participants using their network, both liquidity providers and removers. They also can attract volume to their networks by giving lower prices to large liquidity providers. Fees for ECNs that operate under a classic structure range from $0 to $0.0015, or even higher depending on each ECN. This fee structure is more common in the [[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE]], however recently some ECNs have moved their NYSE operations into a credit structure.\n\n==Currency trading==\nThe first ECN for internet currency trading was New-York based [[Matchbook FX]] formed in 1999. Back then, all the prices were created & supplied by Matchbook FX's traders/users, including banks, within its ECN network. This was quite unique at the time, as it empowered buy-side FX market participants, historically always \"price takers\", to finally be price makers as well. Today, multiple FX ECNs provide access to an electronic trading network, supplied with streaming quotes from the top tier banks in the world. Their matching engines perform limit checks and match orders, usually in less than 100 milliseconds per order. The matching is quote driven and these are the prices that match against all orders. \n\nSpreads are discretionary but in general multibank competition creates 1-2 pip spreads on USD Majors and Euro Crosses. The order book is not a routing system that sends orders to individual market makers. It is a live exchange type book working against the best bid/offer of all quotes. By trading through an ECN, a currency trader generally benefits from greater price [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]], faster processing, increased [[market liquidity|liquidity]] and more availability in the marketplace. [[Bank]]s also reduce their costs as there is less manual effort involved in using an ECN for trading.\n\n==History==\nThe term ECN was used by the SEC to define, \"any electronic system that widely disseminates to third parties orders entered therein by an exchange market maker or OTC market maker, and permits such orders to be executed against in whole or in part\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Regulation NMS SEC Act Release No 51808|url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-51808.pdf}}</ref> The first ECN, the Instinet, was released in 1969 and provided an early application of the advances in computing.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Stafford|title=Equity Markets and Portfolio Analysis|date=2014|publisher=John Wiley & Songs}}</ref> The spread of ECNs was encouraged through changes in regulatory law set forth by the SEC, and in 1975 the SEC adopted the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, encouraging the \"linking of all markets for qualified securities through communication and data processing facilities\".<ref>{{cite web|title=The 1975 SEC Act Amendments|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-89/pdf/STATUTE-89-Pg97.pdf}}</ref>\n\nECNs have complicated stock exchanges through their interaction with NASDAQ. One of the key developments in the history of ECNs was the [[NASDAQ]] over-the-counter [[quotation system]]. NASDAQ was created following a 1969 [[American Stock Exchange]] study which estimated that errors in the processing of handwritten securities orders cost brokerage firms approximately $100 million per year. The NASDAQ system automated such order processing and provided brokers with the latest competitive price quotes via a computer terminal. In March 1994, a study by two economists, William Christie and Paul Schultz, noted that NASDAQ [[bid\u2013ask spread]]s were larger than was statistically likely, indicating \"We are unable to envision any scenario in which 40 to 60 dealers who are competing for [[Payment for order flow|order flow]] would simultaneously and consistently avoid using odd-eighth quotes without an implicit agreement to post quotes only on the even price fractions. However, our data do not provide direct evidence of tacit collusion among NASDAQ market makers\".\n\nThese results led to an [[Nasdaq Market Makers Antitrust Litigation|antitrust lawsuit]] being filed against NASDAQ. As part of NASDAQ's settlement of the antitrust charges, NASDAQ adopted new order handling rules that integrated ECNs into the NASDAQ system. Shortly after this settlement, the SEC adopted [[Alternative trading system|Regulation ATS]], which permitted ECNs the option of registering as stock exchanges or else being regulated under a separate set of standards for ECNs.<ref name=\"Christie94\">Christie, William G. and Schultz, Paul H.

{"title_page": "Nucleic acid structure prediction", "text_new": "{{About|the computational prediction of nucleic acid structure|experimental methods|Nucleic acid structure determination}}\n\n'''Nucleic acid structure prediction''' is a computational method to determine ''secondary'' and ''tertiary'' [[nucleic acid structure]] from its sequence. Secondary structure can be predicted from one or several nucleic acid sequences. Tertiary structure can be predicted from the sequence, or by comparative modeling (when the structure of a homologous sequence is known).\n\nThe problem of predicting nucleic acid secondary structure is dependent mainly on [[base pair]]ing and [[base stacking]] interactions; many molecules have several possible three-dimensional structures, so predicting these structures remains out of reach unless obvious sequence and functional similarity to a known class of nucleic acid molecules, such as [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) or [[microRNA]] (miRNA), is observed. Many secondary structure prediction methods rely on variations of [[dynamic programming]] and therefore are unable to efficiently identify [[pseudoknot]]s.\n\nWhile the methods are similar, there are slight differences in the approaches to RNA and DNA structure prediction. ''[[In vivo]]'', DNA structures are more likely to be duplexes with full [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementarity]] between two strands, while RNA structures are more likely to fold into complex secondary and tertiary structures such as in the [[ribosome]], [[spliceosome]], or [[transfer RNA]]. This is partly because the extra oxygen in RNA increases the propensity for [[hydrogen bond]]ing in the nucleic acid backbone. The [[Nucleic acid thermodynamics|energy parameters]] are also different for the two nucleic acids. The structure prediction methods can follow a completely theoretical approach, or a hybrid one incorporating experimental data.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ponce-Salvatierra|first=Almudena|last2=--|first2=Astha|last3=Merdas|first3=Katarzyna|last4=Chandran|first4=Nithin|last5=Ghosh|first5=Pritha|last6=Mukherjee|first6=Sunandan|last7=Bujnicki|first7=Janusz M|date=2019-01-22|title=Computational modeling of RNA 3D structure based on experimental data|journal=Bioscience Reports|volume=39|issue=2|pages=BSR20180430|doi=10.1042/bsr20180430|pmid=30670629|issn=0144-8463|pmc=6367127}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Magnus|first=Marcin|last2=Matelska|first2=Dorota|last3=\u0141ach|first3=Grzegorz|last4=Chojnowski|first4=Grzegorz|last5=Boniecki|first5=Michal J|last6=Purta|first6=Elzbieta|last7=Dawson|first7=Wayne|last8=Dunin-Horkawicz|first8=Stanislaw|last9=Bujnicki|first9=Janusz M|date=2014-04-23|title=Computational modeling of RNA 3D structures, with the aid of experimental restraints|journal=RNA Biology|volume=11|issue=5|pages=522\u2013536|doi=10.4161/rna.28826|pmid=24785264|pmc=4152360|issn=1547-6286}}</ref>\n\n==Single sequence structure prediction==\n\nA common problem for researchers working with RNA is to determine the three-dimensional structure of the molecule given only a nucleic acid sequence. However, in the case of RNA much of the final structure is determined by the [[secondary structure]] or intra-molecular [[base pair]]ing interactions of the molecule. This is shown by the high conservation of base pairings across diverse species.\n\n===The most stable structure===\n\nSecondary structure of small RNA molecules is largely determined by strong, local interactions such as [[hydrogen bond]]s and [[base stacking]]. Summing the free energy for such interactions should provide an approximation for the stability of a given structure. To predict the folding free energy of a given secondary structure, an empirical [[Nucleic acid thermodynamics#Nearest-neighbor method|nearest-neighbor model]] is used. In the nearest neighbor model the free energy change for each motif depends on the sequence of the motif and of its closest base-pairs.<ref name=\"Mathews06\"/> The model and parameters of minimal energy for Watson\u2013Crick pairs, GU pairs and loop regions were derived from empirical calorimetric experiments, the most up-to-date parameters were published in 2004,<ref name=\"Mathews04\"/> although most software packages use the prior set assembled in 1999.<ref name=\"Mathews99\"/>\n\nThe simplest way to find the lowest free energy structure would be to generate all possible structures and calculate the free energy for it, but the number of possible structures for a sequence increases exponentially with the length of RNA: <code>number of secondary structures = (1,8)<sup>N</sup>, N- number of nucleotides</code>.<ref name=\"Zuker84\"/> For longer molecules, the number of possible secondary structures is huge: a sequence of 100 nucleotides has more than 10<sup>25</sup> possible secondary structures.<ref name=\"Mathews06\"/>\n\n===Dynamic programming algorithms===\n\nMost popular methods for predicting RNA and DNA's secondary structure involve [[dynamic programming]].<ref name=\"Nussinov78\"/><ref name=\"Nussinov80\"/> One of the early attempts at predicting RNA secondary structure was made by [[Ruth Nussinov]] and co-workers who developed a dynamic programming-based algorithm that maximized the length and number of a series of \"blocks\" (polynucleotide chains).<ref name=\"Nussinov78\"/> Each \"block\" required at least two nucleotides, which reduced the algorithm's storage requirements over single base-matching approaches.<ref name=\"Nussinov78\"/> Nussinov et al. later published an adapted approach with improved performance that increased the RNA size limit to ~1,000 bases by folding increasingly sized subsections while storing the results of prior folds.<ref name=\"Nussinov80\"/> In 1981, Michael Zuker and Patrick Stiegler proposed a refined approach with performance comparable to Nussinov et al.'s solution but with the additional ability to find also find \"suboptimal\" secondary structures.<ref name=\"Zuker81\"/>\n\nDynamic programming algorithms provide a means to implicitly check all variants of possible RNA secondary structures without explicitly generating the structures. First, the lowest conformational free energy is determined for each possible sequence fragment starting with the shortest fragments and then for longer fragments. For longer fragments, recursion on the optimal free energy changes determined for shorter sequences speeds the determination of the lowest folding free energy. Once the lowest free energy of the complete sequence is calculated, the exact structure of RNA molecule is determined.<ref name=\"Mathews06\"/>\n\nDynamic programming algorithms are commonly used to detect [[base pair]]ing patterns that are \"well-nested\", that is, form [[hydrogen bond]]s only to bases that do not overlap one another in sequence position. Secondary structures that fall into this category include [[double helix|double helices]], [[stem-loop]]s, and variants of the \"cloverleaf\" pattern found in [[transfer RNA]] molecules. These methods rely on pre-calculated parameters which estimate the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] associated with certain types of base-pairing interactions, including [[Watson-Crick base pair|Watson-Crick]] and [[Hoogsteen base pair]]s. Depending on the complexity of the method, single base pairs may be considered, and short two- or three-base segments, to incorporate the effects of base stacking. This method cannot identify [[pseudoknot]]s, which are not well nested, without substantial algorithmic modifications that are computationally very costly.<ref name=\"Rivas99\"/>\n\n===Suboptimal structures===\n\nThe accuracy of RNA secondary structure prediction from one sequence by free energy minimization is limited by several factors:\n# The free energy value's list in nearest neighbor model is incomplete\n# Not all known RNA folds in such a way as to conform with the thermodynamic minimum.\n# Some RNA sequences have more than one biologically active conformation (i.e., [[riboswitch]]es)\nFor this reason, the ability to predict structures which have similar low free energy can provide significant information. Such structures are termed [[Mathematical optimization|suboptimal]] structures. MFOLD is one program that generates suboptimal structures.<ref name=\"Zuker03\"/>\n\n===Predicting pseudoknots===\n\nOne of the issues when predicting RNA secondary structure is that the standard free energy minimization and statistical sampling methods can not find [[pseudoknot]]s.<ref name=\"Mathews99\"/> The major problem is that the usual dynamic programing algorithms, when predicting secondary structure, consider only the interactions between the closest nucleotides, while pseudoknotted structures are formed due to interactions between distant nucleotides. Rivas and Eddy published a dynamic programming algorithm for predicting pseudoknots.<ref name=\"Rivas99\"/> However, this dynamic programming algorithm is very slow. The standard dynamic programming algorithm for free energy minimization scales O(N<sup>3</sup>) in time (N is the number of nucleotides in the sequence), while the Rivas and Eddy algorithm scales O(N<sup>6</sup>) in time. This has prompted several researchers to implement versions of the algorithm that restrict classes of pseudoknots, resulting in performance gains. For example, pknotsRG tool includes only the class of simple recursive pseudoknots and scales O(N4) in time.<ref name=\"Reeder04\"/>\n\n===Other approaches for RNA secondary structure prediction===\n\nAnother approach for RNA secondary structure determination is to sample structures from the [[Boltzmann]] ensemble,<ref name=\"McCaskill90\"/><ref name=\"Ding03\"/> as exemplified by the program SFOLD. The program generates a statistical sample of all possible RNA secondary structures. The algorithm samples secondary structures according to the [[Boltzmann distribution]]. The sampling method offers an appealing solution to the problem of uncertainties in folding.<ref name=\"Ding03\"/>\n\n==Comparative secondary structure prediction==\n\n[[File:TRNA structure space.png|thumb|S. cerevisiae tRNA-PHE structure space: the energies and structures were calculated using RNAsubopt and the structure distances computed using RNAdistance.]]\n\nSequence covariation methods rely on the existence of a data set composed of multiple [[homology (biology)|homologous]] RNA sequences with related but dissimilar sequences. These methods analyze the covariation of individual base sites in [[evolution]]; maintenance at two widely separated sites of a pair of base-pairing nucleotides indicates the presence of a structurally required hydrogen bond between those positions. The general problem of pseudoknot prediction has been shown to be [[NP-complete]].<ref name=\"Lyngso00\"/>\n\nIn general, the problem of alignment and consensus structure prediction are closely related. Three different approaches to the prediction of consensus structures can be distinguished:<ref name=\"Gardner04\"/>\n# Folding of alignment\n# Simultaneous sequence alignment and folding\n# Alignment of predicted structures\n\n===Align then fold===\n\nA practical [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] approach is to use [[multiple sequence alignment]] tools to produce an alignment of several RNA sequences, to find consensus sequence and then fold it. The quality of the alignment determines the accuracy of the consensus structure model. Consensus sequences are folded using various approaches similarly as in individual structure prediction problem. The thermodynamic folding approach is exemplified by RNAalifold program.<ref name=\"Hofacker02\"/> The different approaches are exemplified by Pfold and ILM programs. Pfold program implements a [[Stochastic context-free grammar|SCFGs]].<ref name=\"Knudsen03\"/> ILM (iterated loop matching) unlike the other algorithms for folding of alignments, can return pseudoknoted structures. It uses combination of [[thermodynamics]] and [[mutual information]] content scores.<ref name=\"Ruan04\"/>\n\n===Align and fold===\n[[Evolution]] frequently preserves functional RNA structure better than RNA sequence.<ref name=\"Hofacker02\"/> Hence, a common biological problem is to infer a common structure for two or more highly diverged but homologous RNA sequences. In practice, sequence alignments become unsuitable and do not help to improve the accuracy of structure prediction, when sequence similarity of two sequences is less than 50%.<ref name=\"pmid19833701\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bfgp/elp043 |vauthors=Bernhart SH, Hofacker IL |title=From consensus structure prediction to RNA gene finding|journal=Brief Funct Genomic Proteomic |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=461\u201371 |year=2009 |pmid=19833701}}</ref>\n\nStructure-based alignment programs improves the performance of these alignments and most of them are variants of the Sankoff algorithm.<ref name=\"Sankoff85\"/> Basically, Sankoff algorithm is a merger of sequence alignment and Nussinov <ref name=\"Nussinov78\"/> (maximal-pairing) folding dynamic programming method.<ref name=\"Hofacker04\"/> Sankoff algorithm itself is a theoretical exercise because it requires extreme computational resources (O<sup>(n3m)</sup> in time, and O<sup>(n2m)</sup> in space, where n is the sequence length and m is the number of sequences). Some notable attempts at implementing restricted versions of Sankoff's algorithm are Foldalign,<ref name=\"Havgaard05\"/><ref name=\"Torarinsson07\"/> Dynalign,<ref name=\"Mathews02\"/><ref name=\"Harmanci07\"/> PMmulti/PMcomp,<ref name=\"Hofacker04\"/> [[Stemloc]],<ref name=\"Holmes05\"/> and Murlet.<ref name=\"Kiryu07\"/> In these implementations the maximal length of alignment or variants of possible consensus structures are restricted. For example, Foldalign focuses on local alignments and restricts the possible length of the sequences alignment. <!--While Dynalign is a-->\n\n===Fold then align===\n\nA less widely used approach is to fold the sequences using single sequence structure prediction methods and align the resulting structures using tree-based metrics.<ref name=\"Shapiro90\"/> The fundamental weakness with this approach is that single sequence predictions are often inaccurate, thus all further analyses are affected.\n\n==Tertiary structure prediction==\n\nOnce secondary structure of RNA is known, the next challenge is to predict [[RNA tertiary structure|tertiary structure]]. The biggest problem is to determine the structure of regions between double stranded helical regions. Also RNA molecules often contain posttranscriptionally modified nucleosides, which because of new possible non-canonical interactions, cause a lot of troubles for tertiary structure prediction.<ref name=\"Shapiro07\"/><ref name=\"Major91\"/><ref name=\"Major93\"/><ref name=\"pmid19543381\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000406 |vauthors=Frellsen J, Moltke I, Thiim M, Mardia KV, Ferkinghoff-Borg J, Hamelryck T |title=A probabilistic model of RNA conformational space|journal=PLoS Comput Biol |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=e1000406 |year=2009 |pmid=19543381 |pmc=2691987|bibcode=2009PLSCB...5E0406F }}</ref>\n\nThe three-dimensional structure prediction methods can use comparative modeling which starts from a related known structure known as the template.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rother|first=Magdalena|last2=Rother|first2=Kristian|last3=Puton|first3=Tomasz|last4=Bujnicki|first4=Janusz M.|date=2011-02-07|title=ModeRNA: a tool for comparative modeling of RNA 3D structure|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=39|issue=10|pages=4007\u20134022|doi=10.1093/nar/gkq1320|issn=1362-4962|pmc=3105415|pmid=21300639}}</ref> The alternative strategy is de novo modeling of RNA secondary structure<ref>{{Cite book|title=RNA 3D structure analysis and prediction|editor=Neocles B Leontis|editor2=Eric Westhof|date=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642257407|oclc=795570014}}</ref> which uses physics-based principles such as molecular dynamics<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vangaveti|first=Sweta|last2=Ranganathan|first2=Srivathsan V.|last3=Chen|first3=Alan A.|date=2016-10-04|title=Advances in RNA molecular dynamics: a simulator's guide to RNA force fields|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: RNA|volume=8|issue=2|pages=e1396|doi=10.1002/wrna.1396|pmid=27704698|issn=1757-7004}}</ref> or random sampling of the conformational landscape<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Shi-Jie|date=June 2008|title=RNA Folding: Conformational Statistics, Folding Kinetics, and Ion Electrostatics|journal=Annual Review of Biophysics|volume=37|issue=1|pages=197\u2013214|doi=10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125957|issn=1936-122X|pmc=2473866|pmid=18573079}}</ref> followed by screening with a statistical potential for scoring.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Laing|first=Christian|last2=Schlick|first2=Tamar|date=June 2011|title=Computational approaches to RNA structure prediction, analysis, and design|journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology|volume=21|issue=3|pages=306\u2013318|doi=10.1016/j.sbi.2011.03.015|issn=0959-440X|pmc=3112238|pmid=21514143}}</ref> These methods either use an all-atom representation<ref>{{Citation|last=Zhao|first=Chenhan|title=Predicting RNA Structure with Vfold|volume=1654|date=2017|journal=Methods in Molecular Biology|pages=3\u201315|publisher=Springer New York|isbn=9781493972302|last2=Xu|first2=Xiaojun|last3=Chen|first3=Shi-Jie|doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-7231-9_1|pmid=28986779|pmc=5762135}}</ref> of the nucleic acid structure or a coarse-grained representation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boniecki|first=Michal J.|last2=Lach|first2=Grzegorz|last3=Dawson|first3=Wayne K.|last4=Tomala|first4=Konrad|last5=Lukasz|first5=Pawel|last6=Soltysinski|first6=Tomasz|last7=Rother|first7=Kristian M.|last8=Bujnicki|first8=Janusz M.|date=2015-12-19|title=SimRNA: a coarse-grained method for RNA folding simulations and 3D structure prediction|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=44|issue=7|pages=e63|doi=10.1093/nar/gkv1479|issn=0305-1048|pmid=26687716|pmc=4838351}}</ref> The low-resolution structures generated by many of these modeling methods are then subjected to high-resolution refinement.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stasiewicz|first=Juliusz|last2=Mukherjee|first2=Sunandan|last3=Nithin|first3=Chandran|last4=Bujnicki|first4=Janusz M.|date=2019-03-21|title=QRNAS: software tool for refinement of nucleic acid structures|journal=BMC Structural Biology|volume=19|issue=1|pages=5|doi=10.1186/s12900-019-0103-1|pmid=30898165|pmc=6429776|issn=1472-6807}}</ref>\n\n<!--\n===Tertiary structure from a sequence===\n===Comparative modeling=== \n-->\n\n==See also==\n* [[RNA]]\n* [[RNA structure]]\n* [[Non-coding RNA]]\n* [[List of RNA structure prediction software]]\n* [[Comparison of nucleic acid simulation software]]\n* [[Comparison of software for molecular mechanics modeling]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!--<ref name=\"Baker01\">Baker D and Sali A.

Secondary structure can be predicted from one or several nucleic acid sequences. Tertiary structure can be predicted from the sequence, or by comparative modeling (when the structure of a homologous sequence is known).\n\nThe problem of predicting nucleic acid secondary structure is dependent mainly on [[base pair]]ing and [[base stacking]] interactions; many molecules have several possible three-dimensional structures, so predicting these structures remains out of reach unless obvious sequence and functional similarity to a known class of nucleic acid molecules, such as [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) or [[microRNA]] (miRNA), is observed. Many secondary structure prediction methods rely on variations of [[dynamic programming]] and therefore are unable to efficiently identify [[pseudoknot]]s.\n\nWhile the methods are similar, there are slight differences in the approaches to RNA and DNA structure prediction. ''[[In vivo]]'', DNA structures are more likely to be duplexes with full [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementarity]] between two strands, while RNA structures are more likely to fold into complex secondary and tertiary structures such as in the [[ribosome]], [[spliceosome]], or [[transfer RNA]]. This is partly because the extra oxygen in RNA increases the propensity for [[hydrogen bond]]ing in the nucleic acid backbone. The [[Nucleic acid thermodynamics|energy parameters]] are also different for the two nucleic acids. The structure prediction methods can follow a completely theoretical approach, or a hybrid one incorporating experimental data.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ponce-Salvatierra|first=Almudena|last2=--|first2=Astha|last3=Merdas|first3=Katarzyna|last4=Chandran|first4=Nithin|last5=Ghosh|first5=Pritha|last6=Mukherjee|first6=Sunandan|last7=Bujnicki|first7=Janusz M|date=2019-01-22|title=Computational modeling of RNA 3D structure based on experimental data|journal=Bioscience Reports|volume=39|issue=2|pages=BSR20180430|doi=10.1042/bsr20180430|pmid=30670629|issn=0144-8463|pmc=6367127}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Magnus|first=Marcin|last2=Matelska|first2=Dorota|last3=\u0141ach|first3=Grzegorz|last4=Chojnowski|first4=Grzegorz|last5=Boniecki|first5=Michal J|last6=Purta|first6=Elzbieta|last7=Dawson|first7=Wayne|last8=Dunin-Horkawicz|first8=Stanislaw|last9=Bujnicki|first9=Janusz M|date=2014-04-23|title=Computational modeling of RNA 3D structures, with the aid of experimental restraints|journal=RNA Biology|volume=11|issue=5|pages=522\u2013536|doi=10.4161/rna.28826|pmid=24785264|pmc=4152360|issn=1547-6286}}</ref>\n\n==Single sequence structure prediction==\n\nA common problem for researchers working with RNA is to determine the three-dimensional structure of the molecule given only a nucleic acid sequence. However, in the case of RNA much of the final structure is determined by the [[secondary structure]] or intra-molecular [[base pair]]ing interactions of the molecule. This is shown by the high conservation of base pairings across diverse species.\n\n===The most stable structure===\n\nSecondary structure of small RNA molecules is largely determined by strong, local interactions such as [[hydrogen bond]]s and [[base stacking]]. Summing the free energy for such interactions should provide an approximation for the stability of a given structure. To predict the folding free energy of a given secondary structure, an empirical [[Nucleic acid thermodynamics#Nearest-neighbor method|nearest-neighbor model]] is used. In the nearest neighbor model the free energy change for each motif depends on the sequence of the motif and of its closest base-pairs.<ref name=\"Mathews06\"/> The model and parameters of minimal energy for Watson\u2013Crick pairs, GU pairs and loop regions were derived from empirical calorimetric experiments, the most up-to-date parameters were published in 2004,<ref name=\"Mathews04\"/> although most software packages use the prior set assembled in 1999.<ref name=\"Mathews99\"/>\n\nThe simplest way to find the lowest free energy structure would be to generate all possible structures and calculate the free energy for it, but the number of possible structures for a sequence increases exponentially with the length of RNA: <code>number of secondary structures = (1,8)<sup>N</sup>, N- number of nucleotides</code>.<ref name=\"Zuker84\"/> For longer molecules, the number of possible secondary structures is huge: a sequence of 100 nucleotides has more than 10<sup>25</sup> possible secondary structures.<ref name=\"Mathews06\"/>\n\n===Dynamic programming algorithms===\n\nMost popular methods for predicting RNA and DNA's secondary structure involve [[dynamic programming]].<ref name=\"Nussinov78\"/><ref name=\"Nussinov80\"/> One of the early attempts at predicting RNA secondary structure was made by [[Ruth Nussinov]] and co-workers who developed a dynamic programming-based algorithm that maximized the length and number of a series of \"blocks\" (polynucleotide chains).<ref name=\"Nussinov78\"/> Each \"block\" required at least two nucleotides, which reduced the algorithm's storage requirements over single base-matching approaches.<ref name=\"Nussinov78\"/> Nussinov et al. later published an adapted approach with improved performance that increased the RNA size limit to ~1,000 bases by folding increasingly sized subsections while storing the results of prior folds.<ref name=\"Nussinov80\"/> In 1981, Michael Zuker and Patrick Stiegler proposed a refined approach with performance comparable to Nussinov et al.'s solution but with the additional ability to find also find \"suboptimal\" secondary structures.<ref name=\"Zuker81\"/>\n\nDynamic programming algorithms provide a means to implicitly check all variants of possible RNA secondary structures without explicitly generating the structures. First, the lowest conformational free energy is determined for each possible sequence fragment starting with the shortest fragments and then for longer fragments. For longer fragments, recursion on the optimal free energy changes determined for shorter sequences speeds the determination of the lowest folding free energy. Once the lowest free energy of the complete sequence is calculated, the exact structure of RNA molecule is determined.<ref name=\"Mathews06\"/>\n\nDynamic programming algorithms are commonly used to detect [[base pair]]ing patterns that are \"well-nested\", that is, form [[hydrogen bond]]s only to bases that do not overlap one another in sequence position. Secondary structures that fall into this category include [[double helix|double helices]], [[stem-loop]]s, and variants of the \"cloverleaf\" pattern found in [[transfer RNA]] molecules. These methods rely on pre-calculated parameters which estimate the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] associated with certain types of base-pairing interactions, including [[Watson-Crick base pair|Watson-Crick]] and [[Hoogsteen base pair]]s. Depending on the complexity of the method, single base pairs may be considered, and short two- or three-base segments, to incorporate the effects of base stacking. This method cannot identify [[pseudoknot]]s, which are not well nested, without substantial algorithmic modifications that are computationally very costly.<ref name=\"Rivas99\"/>\n\n===Suboptimal structures===\n\nThe accuracy of RNA secondary structure prediction from one sequence by free energy minimization is limited by several factors:\n# The free energy value's list in nearest neighbor model is incomplete\n# Not all known RNA folds in such a way as to conform with the thermodynamic minimum.\n# Some RNA sequences have more than one biologically active conformation (i.e., [[riboswitch]]es)\nFor this reason, the ability to predict structures which have similar low free energy can provide significant information. Such structures are termed [[Mathematical optimization|suboptimal]] structures. MFOLD is one program that generates suboptimal structures.<ref name=\"Zuker03\"/>\n\n===Predicting pseudoknots===\n\nOne of the issues when predicting RNA secondary structure is that the standard free energy minimization and statistical sampling methods can not find [[pseudoknot]]s.<ref name=\"Mathews99\"/> The major problem is that the usual dynamic programing algorithms, when predicting secondary structure, consider only the interactions between the closest nucleotides, while pseudoknotted structures are formed due to interactions between distant nucleotides. Rivas and Eddy published a dynamic programming algorithm for predicting pseudoknots.<ref name=\"Rivas99\"/> However, this dynamic programming algorithm is very slow. The standard dynamic programming algorithm for free energy minimization scales O(N<sup>3</sup>) in time (N is the number of nucleotides in the sequence), while the Rivas and Eddy algorithm scales O(N<sup>6</sup>) in time. This has prompted several researchers to implement versions of the algorithm that restrict classes of pseudoknots, resulting in performance gains. For example, pknotsRG tool includes only the class of simple recursive pseudoknots and scales O(N4) in time.<ref name=\"Reeder04\"/>\n\n===Other approaches for RNA secondary structure prediction===\n\nAnother approach for RNA secondary structure determination is to sample structures from the [[Boltzmann]] ensemble,<ref name=\"McCaskill90\"/><ref name=\"Ding03\"/> as exemplified by the program SFOLD. The program generates a statistical sample of all possible RNA secondary structures. The algorithm samples secondary structures according to the [[Boltzmann distribution]]. The sampling method offers an appealing solution to the problem of uncertainties in folding.<ref name=\"Ding03\"/>\n\n==Comparative secondary structure prediction==\n\n[[File:TRNA structure space.png|thumb|S. cerevisiae tRNA-PHE structure space: the energies and structures were calculated using RNAsubopt and the structure distances computed using RNAdistance.]]\n\nSequence covariation methods rely on the existence of a data set composed of multiple [[homology (biology)|homologous]] RNA sequences with related but dissimilar sequences. These methods analyze the covariation of individual base sites in [[evolution]]; maintenance at two widely separated sites of a pair of base-pairing nucleotides indicates the presence of a structurally required hydrogen bond between those positions. The general problem of pseudoknot prediction has been shown to be [[NP-complete]].<ref name=\"Lyngso00\"/>\n\nIn general, the problem of alignment and consensus structure prediction are closely related. Three different approaches to the prediction of consensus structures can be distinguished:<ref name=\"Gardner04\"/>\n# Folding of alignment\n# Simultaneous sequence alignment and folding\n# Alignment of predicted structures\n\n===Align then fold===\n\nA practical [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] approach is to use [[multiple sequence alignment]] tools to produce an alignment of several RNA sequences, to find consensus sequence and then fold it. The quality of the alignment determines the accuracy of the consensus structure model. Consensus sequences are folded using various approaches similarly as in individual structure prediction problem. The thermodynamic folding approach is exemplified by RNAalifold program.<ref name=\"Hofacker02\"/> The different approaches are exemplified by Pfold and ILM programs. Pfold program implements a [[Stochastic context-free grammar|SCFGs]].<ref name=\"Knudsen03\"/> ILM (iterated loop matching) unlike the other algorithms for folding of alignments, can return pseudoknoted structures. It uses combination of [[thermodynamics]] and [[mutual information]] content scores.<ref name=\"Ruan04\"/>\n\n===Align and fold===\n[[Evolution]] frequently preserves functional RNA structure better than RNA sequence.<ref name=\"Hofacker02\"/> Hence, a common biological problem is to infer a common structure for two or more highly diverged but homologous RNA sequences. In practice, sequence alignments become unsuitable and do not help to improve the accuracy of structure prediction, when sequence similarity of two sequences is less than 50%.<ref name=\"pmid19833701\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bfgp/elp043 |vauthors=Bernhart SH, Hofacker IL |title=From consensus structure prediction to RNA gene finding|journal=Brief Funct Genomic Proteomic |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=461\u201371 |year=2009 |pmid=19833701}}</ref>\n\nStructure-based alignment programs improves the performance of these alignments and most of them are variants of the Sankoff algorithm.<ref name=\"Sankoff85\"/> Basically, Sankoff algorithm is a merger of sequence alignment and Nussinov <ref name=\"Nussinov78\"/> (maximal-pairing) folding dynamic programming method.<ref name=\"Hofacker04\"/> Sankoff algorithm itself is a theoretical exercise because it requires extreme computational resources (O<sup>(n3m)</sup> in time, and O<sup>(n2m)</sup> in space, where n is the sequence length and m is the number of sequences). Some notable attempts at implementing restricted versions of Sankoff's algorithm are Foldalign,<ref name=\"Havgaard05\"/><ref name=\"Torarinsson07\"/> Dynalign,<ref name=\"Mathews02\"/><ref name=\"Harmanci07\"/> PMmulti/PMcomp,<ref name=\"Hofacker04\"/> [[Stemloc]],<ref name=\"Holmes05\"/> and Murlet.<ref name=\"Kiryu07\"/> In these implementations the maximal length of alignment or variants of possible consensus structures are restricted. For example, Foldalign focuses on local alignments and restricts the possible length of the sequences alignment. <!--While Dynalign is a-->\n\n===Fold then align===\n\nA less widely used approach is to fold the sequences using single sequence structure prediction methods and align the resulting structures using tree-based metrics.<ref name=\"Shapiro90\"/> The fundamental weakness with this approach is that single sequence predictions are often inaccurate, thus all further analyses are affected.\n\n==Tertiary structure prediction==\n\nOnce secondary structure of RNA is known, the next challenge is to predict [[RNA tertiary structure|tertiary structure]]. The biggest problem is to determine the structure of regions between double stranded helical regions. Also RNA molecules often contain posttranscriptionally modified nucleosides, which because of new possible non-canonical interactions, cause a lot of troubles for tertiary structure prediction.<ref name=\"Shapiro07\"/><ref name=\"Major91\"/><ref name=\"Major93\"/><ref name=\"pmid19543381\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000406 |vauthors=Frellsen J, Moltke I, Thiim M, Mardia KV, Ferkinghoff-Borg J, Hamelryck T |title=A probabilistic model of RNA conformational space|journal=PLoS Comput Biol |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=e1000406 |year=2009 |pmid=19543381 |pmc=2691987|bibcode=2009PLSCB...5E0406F }}</ref>\n\nThe three-dimensional structure prediction methods can use comparative modeling which starts from a related known structure known as the template.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rother|first=Magdalena|last2=Rother|first2=Kristian|last3=Puton|first3=Tomasz|last4=Bujnicki|first4=Janusz M.|date=2011-02-07|title=ModeRNA: a tool for comparative modeling of RNA 3D structure|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=39|issue=10|pages=4007\u20134022|doi=10.1093/nar/gkq1320|issn=1362-4962|pmc=3105415|pmid=21300639}}</ref> The alternative strategy is de novo modeling of RNA secondary structure<ref>{{Cite book|title=RNA 3D structure analysis and prediction|editor=Neocles B Leontis|editor2=Eric Westhof|date=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642257407|oclc=795570014}}</ref> which uses physics-based principles such as molecular dynamics<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vangaveti|first=Sweta|last2=Ranganathan|first2=Srivathsan V.|last3=Chen|first3=Alan A.|date=2016-10-04|title=Advances in RNA molecular dynamics: a simulator's guide to RNA force fields|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: RNA|volume=8|issue=2|pages=e1396|doi=10.1002/wrna.1396|pmid=27704698|issn=1757-7004}}</ref> or random sampling of the conformational landscape<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Shi-Jie|date=June 2008|title=RNA Folding: Conformational Statistics, Folding Kinetics, and Ion Electrostatics|journal=Annual Review of Biophysics|volume=37|issue=1|pages=197\u2013214|doi=10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125957|issn=1936-122X|pmc=2473866|pmid=18573079}}</ref> followed by screening with a statistical potential for scoring.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Laing|first=Christian|last2=Schlick|first2=Tamar|date=June 2011|title=Computational approaches to RNA structure prediction, analysis, and design|journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology|volume=21|issue=3|pages=306\u2013318|doi=10.1016/j.sbi.2011.03.015|issn=0959-440X|pmc=3112238|pmid=21514143}}</ref> These methods either use an all-atom representation<ref>{{Citation|last=Zhao|first=Chenhan|title=Predicting RNA Structure with Vfold|volume=1654|date=2017|journal=Methods in Molecular Biology|pages=3\u201315|publisher=Springer New York|isbn=9781493972302|last2=Xu|first2=Xiaojun|last3=Chen|first3=Shi-Jie|doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-7231-9_1|pmid=28986779|pmc=5762135}}</ref> of the nucleic acid structure or a coarse-grained representation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boniecki|first=Michal J.|last2=Lach|first2=Grzegorz|last3=Dawson|first3=Wayne K.|last4=Tomala|first4=Konrad|last5=Lukasz|first5=Pawel|last6=Soltysinski|first6=Tomasz|last7=Rother|first7=Kristian M.|last8=Bujnicki|first8=Janusz M.|date=2015-12-19|title=SimRNA: a coarse-grained method for RNA folding simulations and 3D structure prediction|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=44|issue=7|pages=e63|doi=10.1093/nar/gkv1479|issn=0305-1048|pmid=26687716|pmc=4838351}}</ref> The low-resolution structures generated by many of these modeling methods are then subjected to high-resolution refinement.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stasiewicz|first=Juliusz|last2=Mukherjee|first2=Sunandan|last3=Nithin|first3=Chandran|last4=Bujnicki|first4=Janusz M.|date=2019-03-21|title=QRNAS: software tool for refinement of nucleic acid structures|journal=BMC Structural Biology|volume=19|issue=1|pages=5|doi=10.1186/s12900-019-0103-1|pmid=30898165|pmc=6429776|issn=1472-6807}}</ref>\n\n<!--\n===Tertiary structure from a sequence===\n===Comparative modeling=== \n-->\n\n==See also==\n* [[RNA]]\n* [[RNA structure]]\n* [[Non-coding RNA]]\n* [[List of RNA structure prediction software]]\n* [[Comparison of nucleic acid simulation software]]\n* [[Comparison of software for molecular mechanics modeling]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!--<ref name=\"Baker01\">Baker D and Sali A.
