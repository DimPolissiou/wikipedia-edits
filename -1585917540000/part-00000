When his elderly grandfather tells him that Margaret is the embodiment of a curse that was set upon the family generations ago (which ends up being a fabrication of a senile old man), Ashton attempts to have her killed, only to later call it off.

He later relocates to San Diego, only to discover, four years later, that Margaret has moved there with the intention of destroying his new life.\n* '''Margaret Sheldon''' The new girl in town who destroys Ashton's luck and confidence. She moves to San Diego with her twin brother. She seeks to ruin Ashton because of his egotistical, chauvinistic habits.\n* '''Drake Sheldon''' Margaret's twin brother, an avid fan of [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]]. He later becomes friends with Ashton. Drake is secretly in love with Kitty.\n* '''Kitty''' A blonde girl who has a crush on Drake. She moves to San Diego some time after Ashton, yet before Margaret and Drake. It is noted several times in the comic that Kitty is from the American Southeast.\n* '''Desmond''' Drug-dealer with extraordinarily strange luck, which has resulted in the death of three people. This has given Desmond a reputation as a hardened criminal. Ashton hires him to assassinate Margaret in the 4th issue.\n* '''Dick''' Ashton's best friend after Ashton moves to San Diego. Dick is commonly left with the girls Ashton dumps.\n* '''Sheila''' One of the girls in the San Diego scene. She also happens to be a large, hefty, mean woman. Sheila is tormented by Ashton's bad luck around Margaret, causing her to be poisoned twice, hit with beer bottles, as well as having her scooter crushed. This often ends with her pummeling Ashton to a pulp.\n\n==Reception==\nIn her book ''We Are the Mods'', Christine Feldman wrote that \"though male and female roles are shaken up within the plot, the story's \"happy ending\" is nothing if not traditional.\"<ref>Feldman, Christine Jaqueline.

He is best known for being a member of satirical team [[The Chaser]]. He hosted the [[Balls of Steel (Australia)|Australian version of ''Balls of Steel'']], which premiered in April 2011. Since 2013, Reucassel and fellow Chaser [[Julian Morrow]] have been main presenters on the ABC program ''[[The Checkout]]''. In 2017, Reucassel presented the four-part ABC TV series ''[[War on Waste]]'' which focused on clothing and food waste in Australia, its environmental impacts and what can be done to help reduce waste. This was followed by a second series in 2018, which focused on the use of plastics, and particularly 'single-use' plastics such as straws.\n\n== Early life ==\nReucassel was born in South Africa on 1 January 1977 and later moved to [[Adelaide]] with his parents.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone Australia\">{{cite journal |author= Simon Wooldridge|title= Burning with the times |work= Rolling Stone Australia |date= 1 September 2007}}</ref> There, he attended [[Semaphore, South Australia|Semaphore]] Park Primary School.<ref name=\"advertiser 05\">{{cite news |author= Rebekah Devlin |author2=Peter Woods |author3=Carla Caruso |author4=Noami Jellicoe |title= Ducking the dark days of childhood |work= The Advertiser |date= 20 June 2005}}</ref> Reucassel later attended Bowral Public School and [[Bowral High School]] in the [[Southern Highlands (New South Wales)|Southern Highlands]] of New South Wales,<ref name=\"McClellan 2011\">{{cite web | last=McClellan | first=Ben | title=Chaser star at White Ribbon do | website=Southern Highland News | date=March 15, 2011 | url=http://www.southernhighlandnews.com.au/story/1070387/chaser-star-at-white-ribbon-do/ | access-date=September 1, 2018}}</ref> becoming the only Chaser member to be public school educated.

Reucassel did receive the hug, but a later approach while holding a running [[chainsaw]] was not so successful. There was much debate surrounding whether to turn on the chainsaw and whether they would be shot at for doing this.<ref>{{Cite

This was followed by a second series in 2018, which focused on the use of plastics, and particularly 'single-use' plastics such as straws.\n\n== Early life ==\nReucassel was born in South Africa on 1 January 1977 and later moved to [[Adelaide]] with his parents.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone Australia\">{{cite journal |author= Simon Wooldridge|title= Burning with the times |work= Rolling Stone Australia |date= 1 September 2007}}</ref> There, he attended [[Semaphore, South Australia|Semaphore]] Park Primary School.<ref name=\"advertiser 05\">{{cite news |author= Rebekah Devlin |author2=Peter Woods |author3=Carla Caruso |author4=Noami Jellicoe |title= Ducking the dark days of childhood |work= The Advertiser |date= 20 June 2005}}</ref> Reucassel later attended Bowral Public School and [[Bowral High School]] in the [[Southern Highlands (New South Wales)|Southern Highlands]] of New South Wales,<ref name=\"McClellan 2011\">{{cite web | last=McClellan | first=Ben | title=Chaser star at White Ribbon do | website=Southern Highland News | date=March 15, 2011 | url=http://www.southernhighlandnews.com.au/story/1070387/chaser-star-at-white-ribbon-do/ | access-date=September 1, 2018}}</ref> becoming the only Chaser member to be public school educated.

{"title_page": "Common Electrical I/O", "text_new": "The '''Common Electrical I/O''' (CEI)  refers to a series of influential Interoperability Agreements (IAs) that have been published by the [[Optical Internetworking Forum]] (OIF).  CEI defines the electrical and jitter requirements for 3.125, 6, 11, 25-28, and 56 [[Gbit/s]] electrical interfaces.\n\n==CEI, the Common Electrical I/O==\nThe Common Electrical I/O (CEI)  Interoperability Agreement published by the OIF defines the electrical and jitter requirements for 3.125, 6, 11, 25-28, and 56 Gbit/s SerDes interfaces.  This CEI specification has defined [[SerDes]] interfaces for the industry since 2004, and it has been highly influential.  The development of electrical interfaces at the OIF began with SPI-3 in 2000, and the first differential interface was published in 2003.  The seventh generation electrical interface, CEI-56G, defines five reaches of 56 Gbit/s interfaces. The OIF began work on its eighth generation with its CEI-112G project.<ref name=112G>{{cite web |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160830005339/en/OIF-Launches-CEI-112G-Project-100G-Serial-Electrical |title=OIF Launches CEI-112G Project for 100G Serial Electrical Links |publisher=Businesswire, 30 Aug 2016 }}</ref>  CEI has influenced or has been adopted or adapted in many other serial interface standards by many different standards organizations over its long lifetime.  SerDes interfaces have been developed based on CEI for most [[ASIC]] and [[FPGA]] products.\n\n==CEI direct predecessors==\nThroughout the 2000s, the OIF produced an important series of interfaces that influenced the development of multiple generations of devices.  Beginning with the donation of the [[PL-3]] interface by [[PMC-Sierra]] in 2000, the OIF produced the [[System Packet Interface]] (SPI) family of packet interfaces.  [[SPI-3]] and [[SPI-4.2]] defined two generations of devices before they were supplanted by the closely related [[Interlaken (networking)|Interlaken]] standard in the SPI-5 generation in 2006.\n\nThe OIF also defined the SerDes Framer Interface (SFI) family of specifications in parallel with SPI.  As a part of the SPI-5 and SFI-5 development, a common electrical interface was developed termed SxI-5.  SxI-5 abstracted the electrical I/O interface away from the individual SPI and SFI documents.  This abstraction laid the groundwork for the highly successful CEI family of Interoperability Agreements and was incorporated in the original release of CEI 1.0 a generation later.\n\n==Generations of OIF Electrical Interfaces==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|- style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|<br>Gen.\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|<br>IA <br>Title\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|<br>Pub. <br>as\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|<br>Clause <br>#'s\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|<br>Max<br>per pair\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|<br>Mult.<br>of bit<br>rate<br>per wire\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|<br>Typical<br>appli<br>-cation\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" scope=\"col\" |<br>Year <br>pub.\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" scope=\"col\" |<br>Adopted, <br>adapted or <br>influenced\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" scope=\"col\" |<br>Num. <br>ranges\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" scope=\"col\" |<br>Modu-<br>lations\n\n|-\n|8\n|CEI-112G\n||Presumably CEI 5.0\n|\n|116 Gbit/s\n|580x\n|800GE thru 100GE\n| (started in 2016)\n| \n| 5\n| \n|\n|-\n|7\n|CEI-56G\n|CEI 4.0<ref name=CEI4>{{cite web |url=http://www.oiforum.com/wp-content/uploads/OIF_CEI_04.0.pdf |title=Common Electrical I/O (CEI) - Electrical and Jitter Interoperability agreements for 6G+ bps, 11G+ bps, 25G+, and 56G+ bps I/O |publisher=OIF, Dec 2017 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=CEI4PR>{{cite web |url=http://www.oiforum.com/oif-cei-technology-for-56-gbps-available-for-wider-industry-adoption/  |title=OIF CEI Technology For 56 Gbps Available For Wider Industry Adoption |publisher=OIF, Jan 2018 }}</ref> \n|16-22\n|56 Gbit/s\n|290x\n|[[400 Gigabit Ethernet|400GE]] thru 50GE\n|2017\n|IEEE 802.3bs and 802.3cd, [[Infiniband]] HDR, 64G [[Fibre Channel]]\n|5\n|NRZ, PAM-4 and ENRZ\n|-\n|6.5\n|CEI-28G (added 25G LR)\n|CEI 3.1 <ref name=CEI31>{{cite web |url=https://www.oiforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/OIF_CEI_03.1.pdf  |title=Common Electrical I/O (CEI) - Electrical and Jitter Interoperability agreements for 6G+ bps, 11G+ bps and 25G+ bps I/O |publisher=OIF, 8 Feb 2014 }}</ref>\n|11\n|28 Gbit/s (25 for LR)\n|140x\n| 100GE thru 25GE\n|2011\n|[[InfiniBand]] EDR, 32G Fibre Channel, [[Serial ATA|SATA]] 3.2, [[IEEE 802.3]] 100GBASE-KR4, 100GBASE-CR4 and CAUI4, [[Serial Attached SCSI|SAS]]-4, Interlaken 1.9\n|4\n|NRZ\n|-\n|6\n|CEI-28G\n|CEI 3.0,<ref name=CEI3>{{cite web |url=http://www.oiforum.com/wp-content/uploads/OIF_CEI_03.0.pdf  |title=Common Electrical I/O (CEI) - Electrical and Jitter Interoperability agreements for 6G+ bps, 11G+ bps and 25G+ bps I/O |publisher=OIF, Sept 2011 }}</ref> \n|10, 12-14\n|28 Gbit/s\n|140x\n| 100GE thru 25GE\n|2008\n|[[InfiniBand]] EDR, 32GFC, [[Serial ATA|SATA]] 3.2, [[IEEE 802.3]] CAUI4, [[Serial Attached SCSI|SAS]]-4, Interlaken 1.9\n|4\n|NRZ\n|-\n|5\n|CEI-11G\n| CEI 2.0 \n|8-9\n|11 Gbit/s \n|55x\n|OC-768, [[100 Gigabit Ethernet|100GE]], 40GE\n|2008\n|InfiniBand QDR, 10GBASE-KR, 10GFC, 16GFC, SAS-3, RapidIO v3, Interlaken\n|3\n|NRZ\n|-\n|4\n|CEI-6G\n| CEI 1.0\n|6-7\n|6 Gbit/s \n|30x\n|[[Optical_Carrier_transmission_rates#OC-768_.2F_STM-256|OC-768]] (~40 Gbit/s)\n|2004\n|4GFC, 8GFC, InfiniBand DDR, SATA 3.0, SAS-2, RapidIO v2, [[HyperTransport]] 3.1, Interlaken\n|2\n|NRZ\n|-\n|3\n|SxI-5\n| SxI-5 <ref name=SxI5>{{cite web |url=http://www.oiforum.com/wp-content/uploads/OIF-SxI5-01.0.pdf  |title=System Interface Level 5 (SxI-5): Common Electrical Characteristics for 2.488 \u2013 3.125Gbps Parallel Interfaces |publisher=OIF, Oct 2005 }}</ref> and CEI 1.0\n|4-5\n|3.125 Gbit/s \n|16x\n|[[Optical_Carrier_transmission_rates#OC-192_.2F_STM-64_.2F_10G_SONET|OC-192]], [[10 Gigabit Ethernet|10GE]]\n|2002, 2004\n|[[Interlaken (networking)|Interlaken]], [[System Packet Interface|SPI-5]], [[SerDes Framer Interface|SFI-5]], FC 2G, InfiniBand SDR, XAUI, 10GBASE-KX4, 10GBASE-CX4, SATA 2.0, SAS-1, RapidIO v1\n|1\n|NRZ\n|-\n|2\n|[[SPI-4.2]]\n| SPI-4, 4.2 <ref name=SPI42>{{cite web |url=http://www.oiforum.com/wp-content/uploads/OIF-SPI4-2.01v2.pdf  |title=System Packet Interface Level 4 (SPI-4) Phase 2 Revision 1: OC-192 System Interface for Physical and Link Layer Devices.  |publisher=OIF, 15 Oct 2003 }}</ref>\n|\n|0.8 Gbit/s \n|4x\n|OC-48 (2.488 Gbit/s)\n|2001-2\n|HyperTransport 1.03\n|1\n|NRZ\n|-\n|1\n|[[SPI-3]]\n| SPI-3\n|\n|0.1 Gbit/s (single ended) \n|1 (ref)\n|[[Optical_Carrier_transmission_rates#OC-12_.2F_STM-4|OC-12]] (0.622 Gbit/s)\n|2000\n|(From PMC-Sierra's [[PL-3]])\n|1\n|NRZ\n|-\n|}\n\nTwo earlier generations in this development path were defined by some of the same individuals at the [[ATM Forum]] in 1994 and 1995.

BETH aims to contribute to the development of [[theological libraries]] in Europe by promoting cooperation between its members.\nBETH has member associations and libraries in 14 European countries, and each year it organizes a meeting in different European cities. The topics of the annual meetings reflect the challenges of modern theologian librarianship like future of the theological libraries, digitization, open access, information literacy, and so on.\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1957, at the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the ''Arbeitsgemeinschaft Katholisch-Theologischer Bibliotheken'', some librarians gathered in [[Frankfurt]] and created the outline for an association which prefigured what was to become BETH. These librarians, Father Luchesius Smits (VKSB, Vereniging voor Seminarie- en Kloosterbibliothecarissen, The Netherlands), Father Francis Courtney (ABTAPL, United Kingdom), and Father Paul Mech (Association des biblioth\u00e8ques de sciences religieuses, France), in the spirit of reconstruction and reconciliation that was characteristic for the period after the WW II,<ref>Andr\u00e9 J. Geuns and Barbara Wolf-Dahm, \"[http://forge.fh-potsdam.de/~IFLA/INSPEL/98-3geunsdahm.pdf Theological Libraries : an overview on history and present activities of the international council of associations of theological libraries]\" [archive], in INSPEL, International Journal of Special Libraries, 32 (1998) 3, pp 139-158.</ref> wanted to contribute to the growth of the [[Christianity|Christian]] faith\u202fby developing exchange between libraries specialized in religious studies. They considered it necessary to improve the professional level of the librarians, to work on international bibliographies and to work together for their common objectives. As for this, one can quote Johan van Wyngaerden who comments the work of the founders of the Dutch association VSKB as follows: \"They considered it as and apostolic mission\u202fnot just to take responsibility of the conservation of the valuable collections of the books of the seminaries and monasteries, but also to make them available for wider audience.\"<ref>J. van Wyngaerden, \"Vereniging voor het Theologisch Bibliothecariaat (VTB)\", in ''Conseil International des Associations de Biblioth\u00e8ques de Th\u00e9ologie, 1961-1996, Leuven: Bibliotheek van de Faculteit Godgeleerdheid van de K.U. Leuven, 1996.''</ref>\n\nIt was in Frankfurt, however, on 18 October 1961 that the ''International Committee for the Coordination of [[Catholic (term)|Catholic]] Theological Library Associations (le Comit\u00e9 international de coordination des associations de biblioth\u00e8ques de th\u00e9ologie catholique)'' was established when librarians from Germany, France and the Netherlands met at a meeting of German librarians. This committee had a rather informal structure. After some ten years, the members decided to create a formal association. In 1970, the \u2018Committee\u2019 became the ''International Council of Theological Library Associations (le Conseil international des associations de biblioth\u00e8ques de th\u00e9ologie)'' when it had grown to include a number of national associations. The statutes of the new association were adopted in a meeting held in 26 September 1973, and they received royal approval in the Netherlands. The secretarial office of the association was in Nijmegen. During the following years, several national associations joined the ''council'', which, in turn, joined [[IFLA World Library and Information Congress|IFLA]] (1971-1986). \nFrom 1961 to 1999 several collaborative publications testify to the enterprising activities of the Council: ''Scripta recenter edita,'' which is a current [[Bibliography|bibliographies]] of philosophical and theological works, was published from 1950 to 1973, and ''Bibliographia ad usum seminariorum'', a selection of the necessary tools for theological studies (liturgical, missiological, ecumenical) from 1959 to 1965.\n\nVery soon after its creation, the International Council of Theological Library Associations began to publish a listing science of religion periodicals, both active and terminated ones, that were in collections of its member libraries. The members of the national associations made a thorough survey of the libraries of their country to clarify the history of each title, and then these files were circulated among the other members who could supplement, correct and localize the data. This effort that was started back in the 1960\u2019s was laborious and took a long time. Out of this work emerged only one single publication, Clavis foliorum periodicorum\u202f: Benelux, which covered the periodicals in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxemburg and was published in 1994 by Peeters. \nCarried on more or less effectively in the different member countries, this project was definitely finished in the beginning of the 2000s at the same time when the old catalogues were digitized and new digital catalogues were created. Although the project was halted in its initial stage, it provided the national associations with a tool that could be used by their member libraries. \n\nIn 1999, the Council, in order to emphasize the specifically European character of its activities, changed the name of the association into ''BETH\u202f:\u202fBiblioth\u00e8ques Europ\u00e9ennes de Th\u00e9ologie / European Theological Libraries / Europ\u00e4ische Bibliotheken f\u00fcr Theologie,'' equipped with a website (www.beth.be) that has been administrated by the Leuven Catholic University ([[KU Leuven|KULeuven]]).\n\nBETH, supported by the national organizations and the exceptionally rich heritage of the libraries involved, organizes a conference each year. Libraries from all areas of Europe (and their native languages) are welcome in the association, although communications among the membership are principally conducted in English.

BETH aims to contribute to the development of [[theological libraries]] in Europe by promoting cooperation between its members.\nBETH has member associations and libraries in 14 European countries, and each year it organizes a meeting in different European cities. The topics of the annual meetings reflect the challenges of modern theologian librarianship like future of the theological libraries, digitization, open access, information literacy, and so on.\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1957, at the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the ''Arbeitsgemeinschaft Katholisch-Theologischer Bibliotheken'', some librarians gathered in [[Frankfurt]] and created the outline for an association which prefigured what was to become BETH. These librarians, Father Luchesius Smits (VKSB, Vereniging voor Seminarie- en Kloosterbibliothecarissen, The Netherlands), Father Francis Courtney (ABTAPL, United Kingdom), and Father Paul Mech (Association des biblioth\u00e8ques de sciences religieuses, France), in the spirit of reconstruction and reconciliation that was characteristic for the period after the WW II,<ref>Andr\u00e9 J. Geuns and Barbara Wolf-Dahm, \"[http://forge.fh-potsdam.de/~IFLA/INSPEL/98-3geunsdahm.pdf Theological Libraries : an overview on history and present activities of the international council of associations of theological libraries]\" [archive], in INSPEL, International Journal of Special Libraries, 32 (1998) 3, pp 139-158.</ref> wanted to contribute to the growth of the [[Christianity|Christian]] faith\u202fby developing exchange between libraries specialized in religious studies. They considered it necessary to improve the professional level of the librarians, to work on international bibliographies and to work together for their common objectives. As for this, one can quote Johan van Wyngaerden who comments the work of the founders of the Dutch association VSKB as follows: \"They considered it as and apostolic mission\u202fnot just to take responsibility of the conservation of the valuable collections of the books of the seminaries and monasteries, but also to make them available for wider audience.\"<ref>J. van Wyngaerden, \"Vereniging voor het Theologisch Bibliothecariaat (VTB)\", in ''Conseil International des Associations de Biblioth\u00e8ques de Th\u00e9ologie, 1961-1996, Leuven: Bibliotheek van de Faculteit Godgeleerdheid van de K.U. Leuven, 1996.''</ref>\n\nIt was in Frankfurt, however, on 18 October 1961 that the ''International Committee for the Coordination of [[Catholic (term)|Catholic]] Theological Library Associations (le Comit\u00e9 international de coordination des associations de biblioth\u00e8ques de th\u00e9ologie catholique)'' was established when librarians from Germany, France and the Netherlands met at a meeting of German librarians. This committee had a rather informal structure. After some ten years, the members decided to create a formal association. In 1970, the \u2018Committee\u2019 became the ''International Council of Theological Library Associations (le Conseil international des associations de biblioth\u00e8ques de th\u00e9ologie)'' when it had grown to include a number of national associations. The statutes of the new association were adopted in a meeting held in 26 September 1973, and they received royal approval in the Netherlands. The secretarial office of the association was in Nijmegen. During the following years, several national associations joined the ''council'', which, in turn, joined [[IFLA World Library and Information Congress|IFLA]] (1971-1986). \nFrom 1961 to 1999 several collaborative publications testify to the enterprising activities of the Council: ''Scripta recenter edita,'' which is a current [[Bibliography|bibliographies]] of philosophical and theological works, was published from 1950 to 1973, and ''Bibliographia ad usum seminariorum'', a selection of the necessary tools for theological studies (liturgical, missiological, ecumenical) from 1959 to 1965.\n\nVery soon after its creation, the International Council of Theological Library Associations began to publish a listing science of religion periodicals, both active and terminated ones, that were in collections of its member libraries. The members of the national associations made a thorough survey of the libraries of their country to clarify the history of each title, and then these files were circulated among the other members who could supplement, correct and localize the data. This effort that was started back in the 1960\u2019s was laborious and took a long time. Out of this work emerged only one single publication, Clavis foliorum periodicorum\u202f: Benelux, which covered the periodicals in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxemburg and was published in 1994 by Peeters. \nCarried on more or less effectively in the different member countries, this project was definitely finished in the beginning of the 2000\u2019s at the same time when the old catalogues were digitized and new digital catalogues were created. Although the project was halted in its initial stage, it provided the national associations with a tool that could be used by their member libraries. \n\nIn 1999, the Council, in order to emphasize the specifically European character of its activities, changed the name of the association into ''BETH\u202f:\u202fBiblioth\u00e8ques Europ\u00e9ennes de Th\u00e9ologie / European Theological Libraries / Europ\u00e4ische Bibliotheken f\u00fcr Theologie,'' equipped with a website (www.beth.be) that has been administrated by the Leuven Catholic University ([[KU Leuven|KULeuven]]).\n\nBETH, supported by the national organizations and the exceptionally rich heritage of the libraries involved, organizes a conference each year. Libraries from all areas of Europe (and their native languages) are welcome in the association, although communications among the membership are principally conducted in English.

The Magpies returned to finals, though were quickly eliminated, in the [[1992 AFL season|1992 season]] against [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] and in [[1994 AFL season|1994]] against [[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]]. Matthews left as head coach at the end of the [[1995 AFL season|1995 season]] and was replaced at the start of the following year by 1990 premiership captain [[Tony Shaw]], who had only retired from football 18 months earlier. Mid-table finishes under Shaw were achieved for the next two seasons, before poor results in 1998 and 1999 saw Shaw announce his resignation.\n\n===2000\u201311: The Malthouse era===\nMedia personality, sports journalist and administrator [[Eddie McGuire]] was elected [[List of Collingwood Football Club presidents|President]] in October 1998. He oversaw the installation of new head coach [[Michael Malthouse]] in October 1999, whose appointment proved to be a masterstroke in reviving the club on-field. Under Malthouse, the acquisition and emergence of players such as [[Paul Licuria]], [[Alan Didak]], [[Anthony Rocca]] and [[Nathan Buckley]] resulted in Collingwood quickly moving up the ladder in [[2000 AFL season|2000]] and [[2001 AFL season|2001]], only narrowly missing the finals in the latter year. Collingwood met reigning premiers the [[Brisbane Lions]] in the [[2002 AFL Grand Final|2002 Grand Final]] and were regarded as massive underdogs, eventually falling just 9 points short of an improbable premiership. Buckley, the captain, became just the third player to win the [[Norm Smith Medal]] as best afield in the Grand Final despite being a member of the losing side. Despite a very successful home-and-away next season, they were again defeated by the Lions in the [[2003 AFL Grand Final|2003 Grand Final]], this time in thoroughly convincingly fashion.\n\nFollowing those Grand Final losses, Collingwood struggled for the next two years, finishing 13th in 2004 and second-last in 2005; the latter meant Collingwood was eligible for a priority pick which the club used to recruit [[Dale Thomas (footballer)|Dale Thomas]]. Collingwood made a return to the finals in 2006, finishing fifth, but were defeated by the [[Western Bulldogs]] by 41 points in its elimination final.

Having earned a preliminary final against {{AFL Gee}}, Collingwood lost to the eventual premiers, by five points in one of the most memorable preliminary finals in over a decade. Nathan Buckley would announce his retirement at season's end after playing just five games in 2007 due to injury.\n\nCollingwood finished eighth in [[2008 AFL season|2008]] and were assigned an away final against {{AFL Ade}} at [[AAMI Stadium]]. After at one point trailing in the match, Collingwood went on to end Adelaide's season and earn a semi-final meeting against {{AFL StK}}. Having defeated the Saints in both their regular season meetings, Collingwood lost convincingly, ending their 2008 season. The [[2009 AFL season|2009 season]] saw Collingwood finish inside the top-four for the first time since 2003, but in the qualifying final were beaten by minor premiers St Kilda convincingly. Having won a second chance, Collingwood struggled against Adelaide for the second year in a row before John Anthony kicked the match-winning goal with a minute left to send them into another preliminary final meeting with Geelong. But the season ended abruptly for the Magpies, with a 73-point loss to Geelong.\n\nIn 2010, Collingwood finished as minor premiers, and after wins in the qualifying and preliminary finals, reached the first [[2010 AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] against {{AFL StK}}. The match finished as a draw, forcing the first [[grand final replay]] in 33 years. Collingwood won the replay by 56 points. Key defensive player [[Nick Maxwell]] captained the club to victory and midfielder [[Scott Pendlebury]] (who had already won his first of eventually three [[Anzac Day match|Anzac medals]] earlier in the year) was awarded the [[Norm Smith Medal]]. The club won a second consecutive minor premiership in 2011, and qualified for the [[2011 AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] after a three-point victory against Hawthorn in the preliminary final. However, Collingwood was then beaten by Geelong by 38 points in the decider, after trailing by seven points at three-quarter time.

The club qualified for finals once more in 2013, though were surprisingly eliminated in the first week by underdogs [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] at home. The result prompted the Magpies coaching staff to begin making radical changes to the club's playing list, which saw premiership players [[Heath Shaw]], [[Sharrod Wellingham]], [[Heritier Lumumba]] among others leave for other clubs or retire. Over the next four years, younger talent was drafted but the club's win-loss recorded continued to deteriorate. Collingwood failed to make finals from 2014 through to the end of the [[2017 AFL season|2017 season]], progressively sliding down the ladder each year. Buckley came under intense media pressure to resign or be sacked from his position, though club administrators elected to grant him a two-year extension to his contract in October 2017 after a broad-ranging internal review.<ref name=Buckleyarticle1>{{cite web|url=https://themongrelpunt.com/afl/2018/10/17/an-imperfect-perfection-the-transformation-of-nathan-buckley|title=An Imperfect Perfection \u2013 The Transformation of Nathan Buckley|work=The Mongrel Punt|date=1 June 2019}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe emergence of new-generation players such as [[Taylor Adams]], [[Adam Treloar]] and [[Jordan De Goey]], alongside key talls [[Brodie Grundy]] and [[Mason Cox]] mixed well with veterans Pendlebury and [[Steele Sidebottom]].

The current incarnation of the guernsey is mostly black, with white stripes on the front and lower half of the back, and white numbers. The main clash guernsey is the reverse of this: mostly white, with black stripes and black numbers, worn in away matches against clubs with a predominantly dark guernsey such as [[Fremantle|Fremantle Football Club]] and [[Port Adelaide|Port Adelaide Football Club]]. A secondary clash guernsey was introduced in 2011 and is used only in matches against {{AFL Nor}} due to similarity between the two uniforms. The alternate uniform is black with only two white stripes on each side instead of three.\n\nTraditionally, Collingwood has worn a white guernsey with black stripes.

In Round 8 2002 Collingwood beat Brisbane by three points in a tense match in front of 46,279 people at [[Colonial Stadium]]. This victory over the reigning premier took the Magpies to equal top of the league table (2nd on percentage) with Brisbane. The rivalry grew with the 2002 Grand Final when Brisbane beat Collingwood by nine points. The rivalry grew again in 2003 when the two clubs clashed on four occasions. The Lions defeated the Magpies at [[The Gabba]] in Round 4 before thrashing them in Heritage Round \u2013 Round 19 at the MCG. Collingwood then defeated Brisbane in the Qualifying Final with [[Alan Didak]] ensuring victory late in the final quarter, with two goals from the boundary line.

This included the 1958 Grand Final where Collingwood's victory prevented Melbourne from equalling Collingwood's record of four premierships in succession (1927\u20131930). The old rivalry with [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] has faded in recent decades due to Melbourne not enjoying the same level of on-field success, however, it remains strong and is an annual scheduled fixture on the Queens Birthday public holiday.\n\n==== [[AFL team rivalries#Essendon v Collingwood|Essendon]] ====\n[[AFL team rivalries#Essendon v Collingwood|Collingwood's rivalry with Essendon]] has become more significant since 1995, when the first [[Anzac Day clash|ANZAC Day clash]] took place. After the 2019 match, Collingwood have won this contest 15 times and Essendon 9 times, with the first match being drawn.\n\n==== [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] ====\nThe rivalry with [[Port Adelaide FC|Port Adelaide]] stems from them being known as the Magpies in their local [[South Australian National Football League|SANFL]] competition before switching to the Power when entering the League in 1997. Feelings were heightened when Port midfielder [[Kane Cornes]] 'flipped the bird' at [[Nick Davis (footballer)|Nick Davis]] following the Power's five-point victory over the Magpies at [[AAMI Stadium]] in Round 9, 2002, only moments after [[Anthony Rocca]] had missed the opportunity to tie the scores. [[Jarrod Molloy]] and [[Brodie Holland]] remonstrated with Cornes after the match, with a feeling of hostility lingering after the two sides had left the field. Collingwood unexpectedly beat the Power in the Qualifying Final that season, also at AAMI stadium. Collingwood again defeated Port Adelaide in the 2003 Preliminary Final at the MCG. This added to the 'choking' phenomenon directed at the Power. The off-field battle over Port's desire to wear its black and white \"prison bar\" guernsey has been a major talking point, especially between 2002 and 2007, which added to the rivalry. A resolution was reached in favour of Collingwood.\n\n==== [[AFL team rivalries#Collingwood v Geelong|Geelong]] ====\n[[AFL team rivalries#Collingwood v Geelong|Games between Collingwood and Geelong]] have become highly anticipated since 2007. In Round 15 Geelong beat Collingwood by 16 points in a high-quality match. In the Preliminary final Collingwood surprised many when they came within 5 points of the eventual premiers. In 2008 Collingwood thrashed Geelong by 86 points\u201420.14 (134)- 7.6 (48) causing Geelong's only loss of the year. In 2009, the sides again met in the preliminary final, but despite high hopes the Cats, who would again win the premiership, won by 73 points in front of another massive crowd of 87,258.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lovett|2010|p=92}}</ref> In 2010, the two sides emerged as the favourites for the flag and twice met in front of blockbuster crowds at the MCG when they were placed 1st and 2nd on the ladder\u2014with the results evenly split. They again met in a Preliminary final, this time a resounding win to Collingwood by 41 points. In 2011, both teams were undefeated going into their round eight 'blockbuster' at the 'G. Geelong won by three points, after a controversial advantage was not paid to Magpie Scott Pendlebury in the dying minutes. Pendlebury kicked a goal and would have put the Pies in front, but the free kick was contentiously called back and Geelong managed to whisk the ball away. In the round 24 match, Geelong thumped the Magpies by a record margin of 96 points, which was also Collingwood's biggest ever loss at the MCG. The 2011 Grand Final against the Cats concluded with a 38-point loss for the Pies.\n\n===Supporters===\n[[File:Magpie mascot.jpg|thumb|200px|Collingwood Magpies mascot]]\nCollingwood is a working-class suburb and the Collingwood Football Club supporter base traditionally came from the working class (though its supporter base today goes far beyond).

Collingwood.\n\n===Off field===\nCollingwood was one of the last clubs to abandon its traditional stadium, the famous inner-city [[Victoria Park, Melbourne|Victoria Park]]. Collingwood now plays home games at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]. It now also has its headquarters situated in the [[Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Center|former Glasshouse Entertainment Centre]]. Due to a sponsorship deal, this facility is known as 'The Holden Centre'.\n\nCollingwood continues to be financially viable through the loyal support of its huge following and numerous sponsors. After finishing 2nd in 2002 and 2003 the team fell to 13th and 15th (out of 16) in 2004 and 2005 respectively. This trend has plagued the club since the glory days of pre-World War II VFL football. Since 1958, the club has won only two VFL/AFL Premiership (the inaugural AFL Premiership in 1990, and in 2010). Despite this, the club still has won more individual games, more finals and made more grand final appearances than any other club.\n\nOn 9 March 2007, former Collingwood and Fitzroy defender [[Gary Pert]] was appointed the Magpies' CEO, seven weeks after Greg Swann departed for Carlton. In accepting the key Magpie post, Pert quit as a club director and as managing director of Channel 9 in Melbourne. In a press conference, it was stated that Collingwood has budgeted to turn over about $50&nbsp;million this year. McGuire hopes the new administration will soon double that figure. \"A finance administration review has come up with how we are going to turn Collingwood in to its next phase of its life\", McGuire said. \"What do we do to make ourselves go from a $45&nbsp;million a year turnover business to a $100&nbsp;million turnover business? \"They sound like big figures but in 1999 we turned over $13&nbsp;million, so that is where we are heading as a football club.\"\n\nThe club made an operating profit of $5.23 million for the 2013 season, revenue increased from $2.6 million to more than $75 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brw.com.au/p/marketing/collingwood_afl_club_builds_build_wIkGxHPlYSn6K0EX6MJTgK|title=Collingwood AFL&nbsp;club builds build TV studio for digital marketing expansion|date=8 January 2014|access-date=17 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923223834/http://www.brw.com.au/p/marketing/collingwood_afl_club_builds_build_wIkGxHPlYSn6K0EX6MJTgK|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 24 July 2017, Pert resigned from his position as CEO of the club, with Peter Murphy replacing him as an interim CEO.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/collingwood-chief-executive-gary-pert-resigns-20170724-gxhbu4.html|title=Collingwood chief executive Gary Pert resigns|first=Jon|last=Pierik|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=24 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Sponsorship===\nThe Collingwood guernsey is the most valuable sports sponsorship in Australia.<ref name=\"Magpies guernsey most valuable\">{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/afls-success-in-black-and-white-20110308-1bmk6.html |title=Magpies guernsey most valuable |work=The Age |location=Australia |date=9 March 2011 |accessdate=22 September 2011}}</ref> Collingwood has different guernsey sponsors for home and away matches, generating an estimated $6.3&nbsp;million worth of media exposure for the primary sponsor and $5.7&nbsp;million for the secondary sponsor.

Collingwood were premiers six times during this time, including four consecutive premierships between [[1927 VFL season|1927]] and [[1930 VFL season|1930]], a VFL/AFL record, and two consecutive premierships in [[1935 VFL season|1935]] and [[1936 VFL season|1936]]. The club's coach during this period was [[Jock McHale]], who served as coach from 1912 to 1949. Collingwood also had three [[Brownlow Medal]]lists during the period, with [[Syd Coventry]] winning in [[1927 VFL season|1927]], [[Albert Collier]] in [[1929 VFL season|1929]] and [[Harry Collier]] in [[1930 VFL season|1930]]. The club's ruthlessly successful period later earned the club the nickname \"The Machine\". American journalist and author Sam Walker included the Machine team in his book ''The Captain Class'', which listed some the author's greatest teams in the history of world sport.<ref name=Hello12>{{cite web|url=https://forever.collingwoodfc.com.au/machine-named-among-worlds-best-ever-sporting-teams/|title=Machine named among world's best ever sporting teams|work=forever.collingwoodfc.com.au}}</ref> The Collingwood team of 1927\u201330 not only won four straight premierships, but did so with a winning percentage of around 86% across the four seasons, and an average winning margin of about five goals. In 1929 they also became the only team in history to go through a home-and-away season undefeated.<ref name=Hello12/> Collingwood remains the only club in the history of the VFL/AFL to have [[List of VFL/AFL premiers|won the premiership]] on four successive occasions.\n\n===1950s: Melbourne rivalry===\n\nIn the 1950s, rival club [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] enjoyed an era of unprecedented success, winning five premierships in six years (the last coming in 1960, and having been runner up in 1954). Collingwood lost two Grand Finals to Melbourne in this decade, but bounced back to win premierships in 1953 and 1958. Collingwood's 1958 premiership is much cherished by the club as it prevented Melbourne from equalling Collingwood's record four premierships in a row.\n\nThe 1958 premiership was however to be Collingwood's last for 32 years, as the club was to suffer a string of Grand Final defeats in coming decades.\n\n===1959\u201389: \"Colliwobbles\"===\n{{main|Colliwobbles}}\nA string of eight Grand Final losses, often by narrow margins, between 1960 and 1981 gave rise to a perception that the club was prone to \"choking\", a phenomenon wittily dubbed \"Colliwobbles\".<ref>[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/opinion/lets-banish-memories-of-colliwobbles-forever/story-e6frfhqf-1225929137935 Let's banish memories of Colliwobbles forever] The Herald Sun, 24 September 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/sport/putting-a-price-on-colliwobbles-20100811-11zpj.html Putting a price on Colliwobbles] The Melbourne Age, 12 August 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/its-still-neck-and-neck-after-44-years-20100925-15rpk.html?rand=1285423503336?autostart=1 It's still neck and neck after 44 years] The Melbourne Age, 25 September 2010</ref> Whether this perception is accurate remains a subject of debate;<ref name=footyalmanac>[http://footyalmanac.com.au/?p=14663 Colliwobbles: fact or fantasy?] ''Footy Almanac''</ref> having only won one and drawn one of its last six Grand Finals.

The sight of club great [[Darren Millane]], who died in a car-crash one year later, holding the ball aloft in triumph at the final siren is one of the indelible images of the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.collingwoodfc.com.au/news/2015-07-29/1990-premiership-exhibition|title=Re-live the triumph \u2013 1990 Premiership exhibition|work=Collingwood Football Club|date=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the drought-breaking premiership, the club lapsed into a state of decline for the remainder of the decade, culminating with the club's second [[wooden spoon]] in 1999. The Magpies returned to finals, though were quickly eliminated, in the [[1992 AFL season|1992 season]] against [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] and in [[1994 AFL season|1994]] against [[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]]. Matthews left as head coach at the end of the [[1995 AFL season|1995 season]] and was replaced at the start of the following year by 1990 premiership captain [[Tony Shaw]], who had only retired from football 18 months earlier. Mid-table finishes under Shaw were achieved for the next two seasons, before poor results in 1998 and 1999 saw Shaw announce his resignation.\n\n===2000\u201311: The Malthouse era===\nMedia personality, sports journalist and administrator [[Eddie McGuire]] was elected [[List of Collingwood Football Club presidents|President]] in October 1998. He oversaw the installation of new head coach [[Michael Malthouse]] in October 1999, whose appointment proved to be a masterstroke in reviving the club on-field. Under Malthouse, the acquisition and emergence of players such as [[Paul Licuria]], [[Alan Didak]], [[Anthony Rocca]] and [[Nathan Buckley]] resulted in Collingwood quickly moving up the ladder in [[2000 AFL season|2000]] and [[2001 AFL season|2001]], only narrowly missing the finals in the latter year. Collingwood met reigning premiers the [[Brisbane Lions]] in the [[2002 AFL Grand Final|2002 Grand Final]] and were regarded as massive underdogs, eventually falling just 9 points short of an improbable premiership. Buckley, the captain, became just the third player to win the [[Norm Smith Medal]] as best afield in the Grand Final despite being a member of the losing side. Despite a very successful home-and-away next season, they were again defeated by the Lions in the [[2003 AFL Grand Final|2003 Grand Final]], this time in thoroughly convincingly fashion.\n\nFollowing those Grand Final losses, Collingwood struggled for the next two years, finishing 13th in 2004 and second-last in 2005; the latter meant Collingwood was eligible for a priority pick which the club used to recruit [[Dale Thomas (footballer)|Dale Thomas]]. Collingwood made a return to the finals in 2006, finishing fifth, but were defeated by the [[Western Bulldogs]] by 41 points in its elimination final. A loss to {{AFL Ess}} late in the season was to cost them the double chance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collingwoodfc.com.au/news/2012-08-30/beyond-2000-essendon|title=Beyond 2000 \u2013 Essendon|publisher=Collingwood FC|first=Luke|last=Mason|date=30 August 2012|accessdate=10 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524151821/http://www.collingwoodfc.com.au/news/2012-08-30/beyond-2000-essendon|archive-date=24 May 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-08-11/bombers-shock-magpies/1237690|title=Bombers shock Magpies|publisher=ABC News ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]])|date=11 August 2006|accessdate=10 June 2017}}</ref> The 2007 season saw them finish sixth on the ladder at season's conclusion, and in the finals they knocked out the grand finalists of the past two years, [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]], in the elimination final and then [[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]] in overtime at [[Subiaco Oval]] in the semi-final. Having earned a preliminary final against {{AFL Gee}}, Collingwood lost to the eventual premiers, by five points in one of the most memorable preliminary finals in over a decade. Nathan Buckley would announce his retirement at season's end after playing just five games in 2007 due to injury.\n\nCollingwood finished eighth in [[2008 AFL season|2008]] and were assigned an away final against {{AFL Ade}} at [[AAMI Stadium]]. After at one point trailing in the match, Collingwood went on to end Adelaide's season and earn a semi-final meeting against {{AFL StK}}. Having defeated the Saints in both their regular season meetings, Collingwood lost convincingly, ending their 2008 season. The [[2009 AFL season|2009 season]] saw Collingwood finish inside the top-four for the first time since 2003, but in the qualifying final were beaten by minor premiers St Kilda convincingly. Having won a second chance, Collingwood struggled against Adelaide for the second year in a row before John Anthony kicked the match-winning goal with a minute left to send them into another preliminary final meeting with Geelong. But the season ended abruptly for the Magpies, with a 73-point loss to Geelong.\n\nIn 2010, Collingwood finished as minor premiers, and after wins in the qualifying and preliminary finals, reached the first [[2010 AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] against {{AFL StK}}. The match finished as a draw, forcing the first [[grand final replay]] in 33 years. Collingwood won the replay by 56 points. Key defensive player [[Nick Maxwell]] captained the club to victory and midfielder [[Scott Pendlebury]] (who had already won his first of eventually three [[Anzac Day match|Anzac medals]] earlier in the year) was awarded the [[Norm Smith Medal]]. The club won a second consecutive minor premiership in 2011, and qualified for the [[2011 AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] after a three-point victory against Hawthorn in the preliminary final. However, Collingwood was then beaten by Geelong by 38 points in the decider, after trailing by seven points at three-quarter time. Following the Grand Final loss, which also marked the end of the club's 2011 AFL season, Malthouse left Collingwood after deciding not to stay on as \"director of coaching\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-01/malthouse-to-part-ways-with-pies/3205206 |title=Malthouse parts ways with Pies |access-date=22 September 2018 |website=ABC News |agency=Australian Associated Press}}</ref> Star midfielder [[Dane Swan]] won the [[2011 Brownlow Medal]] with a then-record 34 votes.

The club qualified for finals once more in 2013, though were surprisingly eliminated in the first week by underdogs [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] at home. The result prompted the Magpies coaching staff to begin making radical changes to the club's playing list, which saw premiership players [[Heath Shaw]], [[Sharrod Wellingham]], [[Heritier Lumumba]] among others leave for other clubs or retire. Over the next four years, younger talent was drafted but the club's win-loss recorded continued to deteriorate. Collingwood failed to make finals from 2014 through to the end of the [[2017 AFL season|2017 season]], progressively sliding down the ladder each year. Buckley came under intense media pressure to resign or be sacked from his position, though club administrators elected to grant him a two-year extension to his contract in October 2017 after a broad-ranging internal review.<ref name=Buckleyarticle1>{{cite web|url=https://themongrelpunt.com/afl/2018/10/17/an-imperfect-perfection-the-transformation-of-nathan-buckley|title=An Imperfect Perfection \u2013 The Transformation of Nathan Buckley|work=The Mongrel Punt|date=1 June 2019}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe emergence of new-generation players such as [[Taylor Adams]], [[Adam Treloar]] and [[Jordan De Goey]], alongside key talls [[Brodie Grundy]] and [[Mason Cox]] mixed well with veterans Pendlebury and [[Steele Sidebottom]].

The all white jumper, with the three black vertical stripes is the iconic strip that the club is most associated with.  The current incarnation of the guernsey is mostly black, with white stripes on the front and lower half of the back, and white numbers. The main clash guernsey is the reverse of this: mostly white, with black stripes and black numbers, worn in away matches against clubs with a predominantly dark guernsey such as [[Fremantle|Fremantle Football Club]] and [[Port Adelaide|Port Adelaide Football Club]]. A secondary clash guernsey was introduced in 2011 and is used only in matches against {{AFL Nor}} due to similarity between the two uniforms. The alternate uniform is black with only two white stripes on each side instead of three.\n\nTraditionally, Collingwood has worn a white guernsey with black stripes.

In Round 8 2002 Collingwood beat Brisbane by three points in a tense match in front of 46,279 people at [[Colonial Stadium]]. This victory over the reigning premier took the Magpies to equal top of the league table (2nd on percentage) with Brisbane. The rivalry grew with the 2002 Grand Final when Brisbane beat Collingwood by nine points. The rivalry grew again in 2003 when the two clubs clashed on four occasions. The Lions defeated the Magpies at [[The Gabba]] in Round 4 before thrashing them in Heritage Round \u2013 Round 19 at the MCG. Collingwood then defeated Brisbane in the Qualifying Final with [[Alan Didak]] ensuring victory late in the final quarter, with two goals from the boundary line.

This included the 1958 Grand Final where Collingwood's victory prevented Melbourne from equalling Collingwood's record of four premierships in succession (1927\u20131930). The old rivalry with [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] has faded in recent decades due to Melbourne not enjoying the same level of on-field success, however, it remains strong and is an annual scheduled fixture on the Queens Birthday public holiday.\n\n==== [[AFL team rivalries#Essendon v Collingwood|Essendon]] ====\n[[AFL team rivalries#Essendon v Collingwood|Collingwood's rivalry with Essendon]] has become more significant since 1995, when the first [[Anzac Day clash|ANZAC Day clash]] took place. After the 2019 match, Collingwood have won this contest 15 times and Essendon 9 times, with the first match being drawn.\n\n==== [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] ====\nThe rivalry with [[Port Adelaide FC|Port Adelaide]] stems from them being known as the Magpies in their local [[South Australian National Football League|SANFL]] competition before switching to the Power when entering the League in 1997. Feelings were heightened when Port midfielder [[Kane Cornes]] 'flipped the bird' at [[Nick Davis (footballer)|Nick Davis]] following the Power's five-point victory over the Magpies at [[AAMI Stadium]] in Round 9, 2002, only moments after [[Anthony Rocca]] had missed the opportunity to tie the scores. [[Jarrod Molloy]] and [[Brodie Holland]] remonstrated with Cornes after the match, with a feeling of hostility lingering after the two sides had left the field. Collingwood unexpectedly beat the Power in the Qualifying Final that season, also at AAMI stadium. Collingwood again defeated Port Adelaide in the 2003 Preliminary Final at the MCG. This added to the 'choking' phenomenon directed at the Power. The off-field battle over Port's desire to wear its black and white \"prison bar\" guernsey has been a major talking point, especially between 2002 and 2007, which added to the rivalry. A resolution was reached in favour of Collingwood.\n\n==== [[AFL team rivalries#Collingwood v Geelong|Geelong]] ====\n[[AFL team rivalries#Collingwood v Geelong|Games between Collingwood and Geelong]] have become highly anticipated since 2007. In Round 15 Geelong beat Collingwood by 16 points in a high-quality match. In the Preliminary final Collingwood surprised many when they came within 5 points of the eventual premiers. In 2008 Collingwood thrashed Geelong by 86 points\u201420.14 (134)- 7.6 (48) causing Geelong's only loss of the year. In 2009, the sides again met in the preliminary final, but despite high hopes the Cats, who would again win the premiership, won by 73 points in front of another massive crowd of 87,258.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lovett|2010|p=92}}</ref> In 2010, the two sides emerged as the favourites for the flag and twice met in front of blockbuster crowds at the MCG when they were placed 1st and 2nd on the ladder\u2014with the results evenly split. They again met in a Preliminary final, this time a resounding win to Collingwood by 41 points. In 2011, both teams were undefeated going into their round eight 'blockbuster' at the 'G. Geelong won by three points, after a controversial advantage was not paid to Magpie Scott Pendlebury in the dying minutes. Pendlebury kicked a goal and would have put the Pies in front, but the free kick was contentiously called back and Geelong managed to whisk the ball away. In the round 24 match, Geelong thumped the Magpies by a record margin of 96 points, which was also Collingwood's biggest ever loss at the MCG. The 2011 Grand Final against the Cats concluded with a 38-point loss for the Pies.\n\n===Supporters===\n[[File:Magpie mascot.jpg|thumb|200px|Collingwood Magpies mascot]]\nCollingwood is a working-class suburb and the Collingwood Football Club supporter base traditionally came from the working class (though its supporter base today goes far beyond). Many of the club's supporters who regularly attend games still come from the working class or from lower socio-economic groups, leading to jokes from supporters of other clubs which typically stereotype their Collingwood counterparts as poor, crude and ignorant.<ref>{{cite web|last=Humphrys|first=Elizabeth|title=Beyond a joke: Bogan loathing bring us all to shame|url=http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/3571876.html|work=The Drum|publisher=ABC|accessdate=8 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003204636/http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/3571876.html|archive-date=3 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCollingwood is traditionally reviled by non-Collingwood supporters (\"You either love 'em or you hate 'em\"). The dislike of the club by outsiders is said to have originated during the 1920s and 1930s, a period of great success for the club which drew the envy and resentment of other clubs. In this period, Collingwood was also perceived as a Catholic and Irish club, at a time when these groups were looked down upon by the rest of Australian society and subjected to a considerable degree of social exclusion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cordy|first=Neil|title=AFL AFL DEPARTMENT OF TRADE NAB CUP SHOWS VIDEO GWS Giants supporters are about to learn why footy fans love to hate Collingwood, writes Neil Cordy|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/gws-giants-supporters-are-about-to-learn-why-footy-fans-love-to-hate-collingwood-writes-neil-cordy/story-e6frf3e3-1226436342075}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sapienza|first=Joseph|title=Everybody hates Collingwood ... but why?|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/everybody-hates-collingwood--but-why-20100921-15l4l.html|work=The Age|accessdate=8 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nUntil recent years, racial vilification of opposition players in VFL/AFL games was not uncommon.

Collingwood.\n\n===Off field===\nCollingwood was one of the last clubs to abandon its traditional stadium, the famous inner-city [[Victoria Park, Melbourne|Victoria Park]]. Collingwood now plays home games at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]. It now also has its headquarters situated in the [[Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Center|former Glasshouse Entertainment Centre]]. Due to a sponsorship deal, this facility is known as 'The Holden Centre'.\n\nCollingwood continues to be financially viable through the loyal support of its huge following and numerous sponsors. After finishing 2nd in 2002 and 2003 the team fell to 13th and 15th (out of 16) in 2004 and 2005 respectively. This trend has plagued the club since the glory days of pre-World War II VFL football. Since 1958, the club has won only two VFL/AFL Premiership (the inaugural AFL Premiership in 1990, and in 2010). Despite this, the club still has won more individual games, more finals and made more grand final appearances than any other club.\n\nOn 9 March 2007, former Collingwood and Fitzroy defender [[Gary Pert]] was appointed the Magpies' CEO, seven weeks after Greg Swann departed for Carlton. In accepting the key Magpie post, Pert quit as a club director and as managing director of Channel 9 in Melbourne. In a press conference, it was stated that Collingwood has budgeted to turn over about $50&nbsp;million this year. McGuire hopes the new administration will soon double that figure. \"A finance administration review has come up with how we are going to turn Collingwood in to its next phase of its life\", McGuire said. \"What do we do to make ourselves go from a $45&nbsp;million a year turnover business to a $100&nbsp;million turnover business? \"They sound like big figures but in 1999 we turned over $13&nbsp;million, so that is where we are heading as a football club.\"\n\nThe club made an operating profit of $5.23 million for the 2013 season, revenue increased from $2.6 million to more than $75 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brw.com.au/p/marketing/collingwood_afl_club_builds_build_wIkGxHPlYSn6K0EX6MJTgK|title=Collingwood AFL&nbsp;club builds build TV studio for digital marketing expansion|date=8 January 2014|access-date=17 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923223834/http://www.brw.com.au/p/marketing/collingwood_afl_club_builds_build_wIkGxHPlYSn6K0EX6MJTgK|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 24 July 2017, Pert resigned from his position as CEO of the club, with Peter Murphy replacing him as an interim CEO.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/collingwood-chief-executive-gary-pert-resigns-20170724-gxhbu4.html|title=Collingwood chief executive Gary Pert resigns|first=Jon|last=Pierik|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=24 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Sponsorship===\nThe Collingwood guernsey is the most valuable sports sponsorship in Australia.<ref name=\"Magpies guernsey most valuable\">{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/afls-success-in-black-and-white-20110308-1bmk6.html |title=Magpies guernsey most valuable |work=The Age |location=Australia |date=9 March 2011 |accessdate=22 September 2011}}</ref> Collingwood has different guernsey sponsors for home and away matches, generating an estimated $6.3&nbsp;million worth of media exposure for the primary sponsor and $5.7&nbsp;million for the secondary sponsor.
