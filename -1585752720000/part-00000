The aircraft safely landed at [[Lajes Field|Lajes Air Base]], on [[Terceira Island]]. The aircraft was evacuated in 90 seconds. All 306 passengers on board survived. An investigation revealed that the cause of the accident was a fuel leak in the number two engine which was caused by an incorrect part installed in the hydraulics system by Air Transat maintenance staff. The part did not maintain adequate clearance between the hydraulic lines and the fuel line, allowing vibration in the hydraulic lines to degrade the fuel line and cause the leak.

The crew returned to Cuba, where they made a safe landing. It has been established that no unusual rudder inputs had been used by the crew during the flight, they were not manipulating the rudder when it failed and there was no obvious fault in the rudder or yaw-damper system. The investigation that followed determined that the manufacturer's inspection procedure for the composite rudder was not adequate. Inspection procedures for composite structures on airliners were changed because of this incident.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/Articles/2005/07/19/200307/Weakest+points.html Weakest points.] [[Flight International]], 19 July 2005.

It is still used today for emergency training.<ref>https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20010706-1</ref>\n* On August&nbsp;24, 2001, [[Air Transat Flight 236]], an [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-200]], en route from [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Toronto]] to [[Lisbon Portela Airport|Lisbon]] with 306 crew and passengers, piloted by Captain [[Robert Piche]] and First Officer Dirk de Jager, made an emergency landing in the [[Azores]] without engine power due to [[fuel starvation]] over the Atlantic Ocean. The aircraft safely landed at [[Lajes Field|Lajes Air Base]], on [[Terceira Island]]. The aircraft was evacuated in 90 seconds. All 306 passengers on board survived. An investigation revealed that the cause of the accident was a fuel leak in the number two engine which was caused by an incorrect part installed in the hydraulics system by Air Transat maintenance staff. The part did not maintain adequate clearance between the hydraulic lines and the fuel line, allowing vibration in the hydraulic lines to degrade the fuel line and cause the leak. The aircraft involved in the incident was repaired and remains in service with Air Transat. The incident went down in history as the longest non-powered flight and landing by a commercial airliner.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/a330-glider-drama-facts-revealed-189183/ A330 'glider' drama facts revealed.] [[Flight International]], 26 Oct 2004.

The crew returned to Cuba, where they made a safe landing. It has been established that no unusual rudder inputs had been used by the crew during the flight, they were not manipulating the rudder when it failed and there was no obvious fault in the rudder or yaw-damper system. The investigation that followed determined that the manufacturer's inspection procedure for the composite rudder was not adequate. Inspection procedures for composite structures on airliners were changed because of this incident.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/Articles/2005/07/19/200307/Weakest+points.html Weakest points.] [[Flight International]], 19 July 2005.

More than 300 passengers were kept on the plane without water, electricity, or air conditioning and rationed food for 6 hours. A passenger called 911 due to the deteriorating situation with some passengers complaining of suffocation. Airport authorities responded by delivering water and disembarking passengers including those complaining of suffocation injuries.

Additionally, many personalities who are active in [[Bollywood]], [[cricket]], and [[politics]] reside in the suburb.\n\n==History==\nThe name \"Bandra\" possibly originates from the [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu]] word for port, or \"bandar.\" <ref>{{cite web |url=https://theculturetrip.com/asia/india/articles/a-tour-through-mumbai-s-historical-neighbourhoods/|title=A Tour Through Mumbai's Historical Neighbourhoods}}</ref> It is described by [[Duncan Forbes (linguist)|Duncan Forbes]]'s ''A Dictionary, Hindustani and English'''(1848) as \"a city; an emporium; a port, harbor; a trading town to which numbers of foreign merchants resort\".<ref name=\"Forbes1848\">{{cite book|author=Duncan Forbes|title=A Dictionary, Hindustani and English: To which is Added a Reversed Part, English and Hindustani|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7klIAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=12 April 2012|year=1848|publisher=W.H. Allen}}</ref> In [[Marathi language|Marathi]], Bandra is known as ''Vandre'', which also means 'port' and is possibly derived from the same Urdu/Persian word.\n\nThe area was under the rule of the [[Silhara dynasty]] in the 12th century. Bandra was a tiny fishing village inhabited by [[Kolis]] (fishermen) and farmers. It was under the Portuguese before it was acquired by the [[British East India Company]].\n\n===Portuguese Bandra===\nIn 1534, a sea captain, [[Diego da Silveira]], entered Bandra's creek and burned the fishing town he found there. With that, Bandra came under the rule of the [[Portuguese crown]].\n\nThis turmoil was the start of a long period of [[Christianization]] of Bandra. Father [[Manuel Gomes da Costa|Manuel Gomes]], a Catholic priest, was instrumental in increasing the Church's prominence in Bandra. In 1580, he baptized 2,000 fishermen. By the time he died 11 years later, Father Gomes' \"invincible strength of soul\", as one historian describes it, had helped convert close to 6,000 people in the area. Father Gomes also established [[St. Andrew's Church, Mumbai|St. Andrew's Church]].\n\nBandra became a Portuguese possession when the Sultanate of Cambay ceded the region in the Treaty of St. Matthew, which was signed aboard the Portuguese brig ''Sao Mateus'' in [[Vasai|Ba\u00e7aim]] harbor in 1534 and aided by Governor-General [[Nuno da Cunha]] and Diego da Silveira. The Portuguese [[enfeoffed]] (gave) Bandra, [[Kurla]], [[Mazagaon|Mazgaon]] and four other villages in 1548 to [[Ant\u00f3nio Pessoa]] as a reward for his military services. This was confirmed by the Royal Chancellery on 2 February 1550.\n\nAs these villages were given for a period of 'two lives', they reverted to the Crown after the death of Isabel Botelha, Pessoa's widow. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], who had applied for acquisition of these villages in anticipation of Isabel's death, obtained them from the viceroy in 1568 and received royal confirmation in 1570.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.firstpost.com/blogs/have-bandras-xenophobes-forgotten-their-own-history-238786.html\n|title=Have Bandra's xenophobes forgotten their own history?\n|publisher=[[First Post]]\n|date = 9 March 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1661, when King Charles married Catherine of Portugal, the island of [[Mumbai|Bombay]] was given to [[England]] as part of the dowry.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2998461\n|title=Catherine of Bragan\u00e7a (1638\u20131705)\n|publisher=BBC\n}}</ref> However, [[Salsette Island]], on which Bandra lay, was not part of this treaty and remained with the Portuguese.<ref>{{harvnb|Greater Bombay District Gazetteer|1960|p=174|Ref=bom}}</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese built additional churches in Bandra, one of the earliest being [[St. Andrew's Church, Mumbai|St. Andrew's Church]] in 1575. Their Jesuit missionaries, who learned local languages and cultures, attracted many Indian converts to Catholicism among the villagers on the island. Their descendants continued to support the six Catholic parish churches\u2014[[Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Bandra|Mount Carmel]], St. Peter's, St. Andrew's, St. Theresa's, St. Anne's and St. Francis d'Assisi\u2014that lie within an area of four square kilometres.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-mumbai-once-a-part-of-bandras-catholic-heritage-a-chapel-at-pali-hill-will-soon-be-history-1824997\n|title=Mumbai: Once a part of Bandra's Catholic heritage, a chapel at Pali Hill will soon be history\n|publisher=[[DNA India]]\n|date = 21 April 2013\n}}</ref> \n\n===British Bandra===\nBandra became part of English territory with the signing of the [[Treaty of Surat]] in 1775, but was retroceded to the [[Marathas]] in 1779 during the [[First Anglo-Maratha War]]. In 1802, [[Bajirao II]] signed the [[Treaty of Bassein (1802)|Treaty of Bassein]] with the English, surrendering sovereignty and again ceding Bandra, and it remained under British control until 14 August 1947.\n\nOn 12 April 1867, the first railway service was inaugurated, with one train per day between [[Virar]] and Bombay. Six years later, it was increased to 24 each day. As of 2018, 940 trains stop daily at Bandra. As late as the 1930s, Bandra had only one bus service from [[Pali Naka]], [[Hill Road]] to the Railway station. Other people just walked to the nearest railway station. After [[World War II]], the building boom began to accommodate immigrants.\n\nBandra was raised to the status of a [[Bandra Municipal Committee|municipality]] in 1876 and then was expanded. In 1950, following independence, it was merged into the Bombay Municipal Corporation to form the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay. Bandra consisted of many villages, among them Sherly, Malla, Rajan, Kantwady, Waroda, Ranwar, Boran, Pali, and Chuim. These have been lost to urban development of the island.\n\n====Mount Mary's Church====\n[[File:Mother mary.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Mother Mary at [[Mount Mary Church, Bandra]].]]\nThe Catholic [[chapel]] of [[Mount Mary Church, Bandra|Mount Mary]] was built around 1640 by the Portuguese. The chapel was destroyed in 1738 by the Marathas during their campaign to evict the Portuguese. The statue of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin]] was recovered from the sea by fishermen and temporarily installed in St. Andrew's Church, before being shifted to the rebuilt Mount Mary's Church in 1761. 2018 marked the beginning of the \"Feast of Our Lady of the Mount\", also known as the \"Monti Fest\" or the \"Bandra Feast\". To this day, the statue is venerated and many miracles, minor and major, are attributed to the Lady of the Mount. The architect of Mount Mary's Church was Bombay architect [[Shahpoorjee Chandabhoy]]. The basilica was built in 1904 at a cost of INR 1 lakh. The original church was built to serve the garrison posted at the [[Castella de Aguada]] (Fortress of Aguada) at [[Land's End, Bandra]]. In 1879, [[Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy|Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy]] constructed a flight of steps to Mount Mary's Church; these are known as the ''Degrados de Bomanjee'' ('Steps of Bomanjee').\n\nPeople of all faiths and communities visit the church, giving the place a syncretic nature. The [[Bandra Fair]] is held during the eight days of the Octave of the Nativity of Our Lady, beginning 8 September, when pilgrims throng the church.<ref>[http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=255163 Mount Mary fair begins today]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''[[Indian Express]]'', 8 September 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_devotees-throng-to-bandra-fair-on-opening-day-as-stall-owners-protest_1437121 \"Devotees throng to Bandra Fair on opening day as stall owners protest\"], ''[[DNA (newspaper)]]'', 13 September 2010.</ref>\n\n====Educational institutions====\nThe first school founded in Bandra after Bombay passed on to the English was St Andrew's Parish School, started by Fr. [[Francisco de Melo]] in 1780 to teach catechism to the children of the parish. This later became [[St. Andrew's High School, Mumbai|St. Andrew's High School]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://saintandrewschoolbandra.in/content/history-0|publisher=St Andrew High School, Bandra|access-date=19 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331133206/http://saintandrewschoolbandra.in/content/history-0|archive-date=31 March 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The school is located in Bandra West.\n\nSt. Theresa's High School grew out of St. Andrew's Indian Christians' School, housed in a very dilapidated building situated in Old Khar.

Later, it grew to be a full-fledged educational institution for day-scholars as well as boarders. What started out as a school for 40 orphans has grown to support 2,300 students. St. Stanislaus High School is located on Hill Road, in Bandra West. [[Cardinal Gracias High School]] is a [[convent school]] located in Bandra East.

National College]] was originally set up in 1922 in [[Hyderabad, Pakistan]] under the guidance of [[Annie Besant]]. In the run-up to the [[Partition of India]], it was relocated to its present site in 1949 in Bandra. The [[Thadomal Shahani Engineering College]] was established in 1983 by the [[Hyderabad (Sind) National Collegiate Board]]. It was the first private engineering institute to be affiliated with the federal [[University of Mumbai]] to offer courses in [[Computer Engineering]], [[Information Technology]], [[Biomedical Engineering]] and [[Biotechnology]].\n\nThe Rizvi Education Complex, located off [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]], comprises the Rizvi College of Arts, Science and Commerce (established in 1985); Rizvi High School (established in 1985); [[Rizvi College of Engineering]] (established in 1998); Rizvi College of Architecture; Rizvi College of Hotel Management & Catering Technology; [[Rizvi Law College]]; Rizvi College of Education and the Rizvi College of Fashion Designing & Creative Arts<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rizvi.edu.in/|title=Rizvi Education Society|author=|date=|website=www.rizvi.edu.in}}</ref> All are managed by the Rizvi Education Society, and may have the status of Muslim religious minority institution.\n\n====Bandra lake====\n{{main|Bandra Talao}}\n[[Bandra Lake]], also called Bandra Talao or Motha Reservoir was constructed by a rich [[Konkani]] Muslim of [[Navapada]] (also spelt Naupada or Naopara), an adjoining village.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal |title=Gazetteer of Thane District \u2013 Places of Interest, 1882| url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/pdf/gazeetter_reprint/Thane-III/places_Bandra.html}}</ref>\n\nThe lake was later acquired by the [[Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai]].

In the mid-2000s, the city of Bandra started an audacious task to reclaim lands on the [[Mithi River]] in the eastern portion of the city, near the [[Kurla]] border. The newly-formed [[Bandra-Kurla Complex]] (BKC) has attracted several equity and technology firms, such as Blackstone, Google, and Amazon, who chose Bandra instead of Mumbai City for its location, lower-cost of land, and new development.\n\nAs the last suburb before entering Mumbai City, Bandra has for a while been strained with traffic, particularly around the railway station and S.V. Road. The development of a business centre has only exacerbated the traffic problems, as unlike other commercial hubs, Bandra's BKC is located between [[Banda Station|Bandra]] and [[Kurla railway station|Kurla]] stations and requires approximately 10-15 minute vehicular commute from either of the stations. Nearly 300,000 office-goers alight daily at Bandra Railway Station and take a taxi or bus to BKC. This has made [[Banda Station|Bandra]] among the busiest stations in India, surpassing [[Andheri]] and [[Bombay Central]], and the second-busiest station in Maharashtra's Western Railway after [[Churchgate railway station]].\n\n==Urban art==\nBandra has a large collection of street art or graffiti. The paintings on walls are principally located in the vicinity of Chapel Road and Veronica Street, but prominent works are also visible near Bandstand and Mount Mary Church.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.minorsights.com/2016/03/india-ranwar-village.html|title=Ranwar Village|accessdate= 22 March 2016|publisher=Minor Sights}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.minorsights.com/2016/03/india-bollywood-art-project.html|title=Bollywood Art Project|accessdate= 22 March 2016|publisher=Minor Sights}}</ref> They consist of various types of graffiti, including pieces, stencils, tags, etc. Globally renowned artists such as Gomez have created works on these walls.\nSt+art Mumbai, Bollywood Art Project<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/BollywoodArtProject/|title=Bollywood Art Project \u2013 BAP|author=|date=|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref> and Dharavi Art Room are some of the organizations that conduct various programs to encourage the artists.

The part of Bandra located on the western side of the railway line developed into a fashionable suburb by the middle of the 20th century. Film director [[Mehboob Khan]] established the [[Mehboob Studio]]s here in 1954. Soon the area became a center for the Indian movie industry, [[Bollywood]]. A recording studio was set up in the 1970s.<ref name=pn>{{cite news |title=Mehboob mere, Mehboob tere |url=http://www.punemirror.in/index.aspx?Page=article&sectname=News%20-%20Mumbai&sectid=3&contentid=20081101200811012008337798596fdb6 |newspaper=Pune Mirror |date=1 November 2008 |access-date=21 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718051651/http://www.punemirror.in/index.aspx?Page=article&sectname=News%20-%20Mumbai&sectid=3&contentid=20081101200811012008337798596fdb6 |archive-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=dn>{{cite news |title=Mumbai, meri mehboob?|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/column_mumbai-meri-mehboob_1504231 |newspaper=[[DNA (newspaper)|DNA]]|date=  7 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, the eastern part emerged as a commercial and administrative hub. It houses the Family Court, [[Bandra-Kurla complex|Bandra-Kurla Commercial Complex]], the office of the state housing development authority ([[Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority|MHADA]]) and the office of the [[District Collector]]. The residential quarters of the employees of the Maharashtra State Government are also located here.\n\nMost roads and places in Bandra were given English names during [[British rule]]. They have been renamed over time but many are still popularly known by their old names.\n\n* Neighbouring suburbs: [[Dharavi]], [[Khar, Mumbai|Khar]], [[Kurla]], [[Mahim]], [[Santa Cruz (Mumbai)|Santacruz]]\n* Arterial Roads: [[Swami Vivekanand Road (Mumbai)|Swami Vivekanand Road]] (S.V Road), [[Linking Road]], Turner Road (Guru Nanak Marg), [[Hill Road]] (renamed Ramdas Nayak Marg), [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]] (renamed Naushad Ali Marg), Navpada Road (Balsamant), [[Western Express Highway]]. The [[Bandra-Worli Sea Link]] connects the western part of Bandra to [[Worli]] by the sea route, thus diverting a lot of road traffic.\n\n[[File:Worli skyline from Bandra.jpg|thumb|300px|Worli skyline as seen from Bandra Reclamation]]\n[[File:Bandra Linking road.jpg|thumb|A stall on Linking Road]]\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:India Mumbai Bridge .jpg|thumb|[[Bandra-Worli Sealink]] Project]]\n[[Bandra railway station]] is connected with the [[Western Railway Zone (India)|Western Railway]] and the [[Harbour Line]], which is an offshoot of the suburban [[Central Railway (India)|Central Railway]]. It also has a newly built terminus called [[Bandra Terminus]] in Bandra (E) from where trains bound for northern and western India are scheduled regularly. The important trains include the Bandra-[[New Delhi]] Rajdhani Express, Bandra-[[Indore]] Express, Bandra-[[Patna]] Express, Bandra-[[Jaipur]] Express, Bandra-[[Jodhpur]] Express and the Bandra-[[Amritsar]] Express\n\nPublic transport also includes [[Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport|BEST]] buses, auto rickshaws and taxis, which are abundant. Bandra is the last southern point from Mumbai where auto rickshaws ply. Beyond Bandra, entering [[Mahim]], only taxis are allowed to ply.\n\nThe [[Bandra-Worli Sea Link]] bridge connects Bandra West with [[Worli]], located in central Mumbai.

Allen}}</ref> In [[Marathi language|Marathi]], Bandra is known as ''Vandre'', which also means 'port' and is possibly derived from the same Urdu/Persian word.\n\nThe area was under the rule of the [[Silhara dynasty]] in the 12th century. Bandra was a tiny fishing village inhabited by [[Kolis]] (fishermen) and farmers. It was under the Portuguese before it was acquired by the [[British East India Company]].\n\n===Portuguese Bandra===\nIn 1534, a sea captain, [[Diego da Silveira]], entered Bandra's creek and burned the fishing town he found there. With that, Bandra came under the rule of the [[Portuguese crown]].\n\nThis turmoil was the start of a long period of [[Christianization]] of Bandra. Father [[Manuel Gomes da Costa|Manuel Gomes]], a Catholic priest, was instrumental in increasing the Church's prominence in Bandra. In 1580, he baptized 2,000 fishermen. By the time he died 11 years later, Father Gomes' \"invincible strength of soul\", as one historian describes it, had helped convert close to 6,000 people in the area. Father Gomes also established [[St. Andrew's Church, Mumbai|St. Andrew's Church]].\n\nBandra became a Portuguese possession when the Sultanate of Cambay ceded the region in the Treaty of St. Matthew, which was signed aboard the Portuguese brig ''Sao Mateus'' in [[Vasai|Ba\u00e7aim]] harbor in 1534 and aided by Governor-General [[Nuno da Cunha]] and Diego da Silveira. The Portuguese [[enfeoffed]] (gave) Bandra, [[Kurla]], [[Mazagaon|Mazgaon]] and four other villages in 1548 to [[Ant\u00f3nio Pessoa]] as a reward for his military services. This was confirmed by the Royal Chancellery on 2 February 1550.\n\nAs these villages were given for a period of 'two lives', they reverted to the Crown after the death of Isabel Botelha, Pessoa's widow. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], who had applied for acquisition of these villages in anticipation of Isabel's death, obtained them from the viceroy in 1568 and received royal confirmation in 1570.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.firstpost.com/blogs/have-bandras-xenophobes-forgotten-their-own-history-238786.html\n|title=Have Bandra's xenophobes forgotten their own history?\n|publisher=[[First Post]]\n|date = 9 March 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1661, when King Charles married Catherine of Portugal, the island of [[Mumbai|Bombay]] was given to [[England]] as part of the dowry.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2998461\n|title=Catherine of Bragan\u00e7a (1638\u20131705)\n|publisher=BBC\n}}</ref> However, [[Salsette Island]], on which Bandra lay, was not part of this treaty and remained with the Portuguese.<ref>{{harvnb|Greater Bombay District Gazetteer|1960|p=174|Ref=bom}}</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese built additional churches in Bandra, one of the earliest being St. Andrew's Church in 1575. Their Jesuit missionaries, who learned local languages and cultures, attracted many Indian converts to Catholicism among the villagers on the island. Their descendants continued to support the six Catholic parish churches\u2014[[Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Bandra|Mount Carmel]], St. Peter's, St. Andrew's, St. Theresa's, St. Anne's and St. Francis d'Assisi\u2014that lie within an area of four square kilometres.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-mumbai-once-a-part-of-bandras-catholic-heritage-a-chapel-at-pali-hill-will-soon-be-history-1824997\n|title=Mumbai: Once a part of Bandra's Catholic heritage, a chapel at Pali Hill will soon be history\n|publisher=[[DNA India]]\n|date = 21 April 2013\n}}</ref>\n\n===British Bandra===\nBandra became part of English territory with the signing of the [[Treaty of Surat]] in 1775, but was retroceded to the [[Marathas]] in 1779 during the [[First Anglo-Maratha War]]. In 1802, [[Bajirao II]] signed the [[Treaty of Bassein (1802)|Treaty of Bassein]] with the English, surrendering sovereignty and again ceding Bandra, and it remained under British control until 14 August 1947.\n\nOn 12 April 1867, the first railway service was inaugurated, with one train per day between [[Virar]] and Bombay. Six years later, it was increased to 24 each day. As of 2018, 940 trains stop daily at Bandra. As late as the 1930s, Bandra had only one bus service from [[Pali Naka]], [[Hill Road]] to the Railway station. Other people just walked to the nearest railway station. After [[World War II]], the building boom began to accommodate immigrants.\n\nBandra was raised to the status of a [[Bandra Municipal Committee|municipality]] in 1876 and then was expanded. In 1950, following independence, it was merged into the Bombay Municipal Corporation to form the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay. Bandra consisted of many villages, among them Sherly, Malla, Rajan, Kantwady, Waroda, Ranwar, Boran, Pali, and Chuim. These have been lost to urban development of the island.\n\n====Mount Mary's Church====\n[[File:Mother mary.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Mother Mary at [[Mount Mary Church, Bandra]].]]\nThe Catholic [[chapel]] of [[Mount Mary Church, Bandra|Mount Mary]] was built around 1640 by the Portuguese. The chapel was destroyed in 1738 by the Marathas during their campaign to evict the Portuguese. The statue of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin]] was recovered from the sea by fishermen and temporarily installed in St. Andrew's Church, before being shifted to the rebuilt Mount Mary's Church in 1761. 2018 marked the beginning of the \"Feast of Our Lady of the Mount\", also known as the \"Monti Fest\" or the \"Bandra Feast\". To this day, the statue is venerated and many miracles, minor and major, are attributed to the Lady of the Mount. The architect of Mount Mary's Church was Bombay architect [[Shahpoorjee Chandabhoy]]. The basilica was built in 1904 at a cost of INR 1 lakh. The original church was built to serve the garrison posted at the [[Castella de Aguada]] (Fortress of Aguada) at [[Land's End, Bandra]]. In 1879, [[Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy|Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy]] constructed a flight of steps to Mount Mary's Church; these are known as the ''Degrados de Bomanjee'' ('Steps of Bomanjee').\n\nPeople of all faiths and communities visit the church, giving the place a syncretic nature. The [[Bandra Fair]] is held during the eight days of the Octave of the Nativity of Our Lady, beginning 8 September, when pilgrims throng the church.<ref>[http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=255163 Mount Mary fair begins today]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''[[Indian Express]]'', 8 September 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_devotees-throng-to-bandra-fair-on-opening-day-as-stall-owners-protest_1437121 \"Devotees throng to Bandra Fair on opening day as stall owners protest\"], ''[[DNA (newspaper)]]'', 13 September 2010.</ref>\n\n====Educational institutions====\nThe first school founded in Bandra after Bombay passed on to the English was St Andrew's Parish School, started by Fr.

In the mid-2000s, the city of Bandra started an audacious task to reclaim lands on the [[Mithi River]] in the eastern portion of the city, near the [[Kurla]] border. The newly-formed [[Bandra-Kurla Complex]] (BKC) has attracted several equity and technology firms, such as Blackstone, Google, and Amazon, who chose Bandra instead of Mumbai City for its location, lower-cost of land, and new development.\n\nAs the last suburb before entering Mumbai City, Bandra has for a while been strained with traffic, particularly around the railway station and S.V. Road. The development of a business centre has only exacerbated the traffic problems, as unlike other commercial hubs, Bandra's BKC is located between [[Banda Station|Bandra]] and [[Kurla railway station|Kurla]] stations and requires approximately 10-15 minute vehicular commute from either of the stations. Nearly 300,000 office-goers alight daily at Bandra Railway Station and take a taxi or bus to BKC. This has made [[Banda Station|Bandra]] among the busiest stations in India, surpassing [[Andheri]] and [[Bombay Central]], and the second-busiest station in Maharashtra's Western Railway after [[Churchgate railway station]].\n\n==Urban art==\nBandra has a large collection of street art or graffiti. The paintings on walls are principally located in the vicinity of Chapel Road and Veronica Street, but prominent works are also visible near Bandstand and Mount Mary Church.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.minorsights.com/2016/03/india-ranwar-village.html|title=Ranwar Village|accessdate= 22 March 2016|publisher=Minor Sights}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.minorsights.com/2016/03/india-bollywood-art-project.html|title=Bollywood Art Project|accessdate= 22 March 2016|publisher=Minor Sights}}</ref> They consist of various types of graffiti, including pieces, stencils, tags, etc. Globally renowned artists such as Gomez have created works on these walls.\nSt+art Mumbai, Bollywood Art Project<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/BollywoodArtProject/|title=Bollywood Art Project \u2013 BAP|author=|date=|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref> and Dharavi Art Room are some of the organizations that conduct various programs to encourage the artists.

The part of Bandra located on the western side of the railway line developed into a fashionable suburb by the middle of the 20th century. Film director [[Mehboob Khan]] established the [[Mehboob Studio]]s here in 1954. Soon the area became a center for the Indian movie industry, [[Bollywood]]. A recording studio was set up in the 1970s.<ref name=pn>{{cite news |title=Mehboob mere, Mehboob tere |url=http://www.punemirror.in/index.aspx?Page=article&sectname=News%20-%20Mumbai&sectid=3&contentid=20081101200811012008337798596fdb6 |newspaper=Pune Mirror |date=1 November 2008 |access-date=21 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718051651/http://www.punemirror.in/index.aspx?Page=article&sectname=News%20-%20Mumbai&sectid=3&contentid=20081101200811012008337798596fdb6 |archive-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=dn>{{cite news |title=Mumbai, meri mehboob?|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/column_mumbai-meri-mehboob_1504231 |newspaper=[[DNA (newspaper)|DNA]]|date=  7 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, the eastern part emerged as a commercial and administrative hub. It houses the Family Court, [[Bandra-Kurla complex|Bandra-Kurla Commercial Complex]], the office of the state housing development authority ([[Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority|MHADA]]) and the office of the [[District Collector]]. The residential quarters of the employees of the Maharashtra State Government are also located here.\n\nMost roads and places in Bandra were given English names during [[British rule]]. They have been renamed over time but many are still popularly known by their old names.\n\n* Neighbouring suburbs: [[Dharavi]], [[Khar, Mumbai|Khar]], [[Kurla]], [[Mahim]], [[Santa Cruz (Mumbai)|Santacruz]]\n* Arterial Roads: [[Swami Vivekanand Road (Mumbai)|Swami Vivekanand Road]] (S.V Road), [[Linking Road]], Turner Road (Guru Nanak Marg), [[Hill Road]] (renamed Ramdas Nayak Marg), [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]] (renamed Naushad Ali Marg), Navpada Road (Balsamant), [[Western Express Highway]].

The important trains include the Bandra-[[New Delhi]] Rajdhani Express, Bandra-[[Indore]] Express, Bandra-[[Patna]] Express, Bandra-[[Jaipur]] Express, Bandra-[[Jodhpur]] Express and the Bandra-[[Amritsar]] Express\n\nPublic transport also includes [[Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport|BEST]] buses, auto rickshaws and taxis, which are abundant. Bandra is the last southern point from Mumbai where auto rickshaws ply. Beyond Bandra, entering [[Mahim]], only taxis are allowed to ply.\n\nThe [[Bandra-Worli Sea Link]] bridge connects Bandra West with [[Worli]], located in central Mumbai.

The name refers to its historic position as \"[[bank (geography)|The East Bank]]\" of the [[Huangpu River]], which flows through central Shanghai, although it is now administered as the '''Pudong New Area''', a [[new areas|state-level new area]] which extends all the way to the [[East China Sea]].\n\nThe traditional area of Pudong is now home to the [[Lujiazui|Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone]] and the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]] and many of Shanghai's best-known buildings, such as the [[Oriental Pearl Tower]], the [[Jin Mao Tower]], the [[Shanghai World Financial Center]], and the [[Shanghai Tower]]. These modern skyscrapers directly face [[Puxi]]'s historic [[The Bund (Shanghai)|Bund]], a remnant of former [[concessions in China|foreign concessions]] in China. The rest of the new area includes the [[Port of Shanghai]], the [[Shanghai Expo Park|Shanghai Expo]] and [[Century Park (Shanghai)|Century Park]], [[Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park]], [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]], the [[Jiuduansha Wetland Nature Reserve]], [[Nanhui New City]], and the [[Shanghai Disney Resort]].\n\n==History==\n''Pudong''&mdash;literally \"The East Bank of the Huangpu River\"&mdash;originally referred only to the less-developed land across from Shanghai's [[Old City of Shanghai|Old City]] and [[Shanghai International Settlement|foreign concessions]]. The area was mainly farmland and only slowly developed, with warehouses and wharfs near the shore administered by the districts of [[Puxi]] on the west bank: [[Huangpu District, Shanghai|Huangpu]], [[Yangpu District|Yangpu]], and [[Nanshi District, Shanghai|Nanshi]]. Pudong was originally established as a county in 1958 until 1961 which the county was split among [[Huangpu District, Shanghai|Huangpu]], [[Yangpu District|Yangpu]], [[Nanshi District, Shanghai|Nanshi]], [[Wusong District|Wusong]] and [[Chuansha County]]. In October 1, 1992 the original area of Pudong County and Chuansha County merged and established Pudong New Area.\n\nIn 1993, the Chinese government set up a [[Special Economic Zone]] in Chuansha, creating the Pudong New Area. The western tip of the Pudong district was designated as the [[Lujiazui|Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone]] and has become a financial hub of modern China.  Several landmark buildings were constructed, including the Oriental Pearl Tower, and the [[supertall]] Jin Mao Building ({{convert|420.5|m|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or}}), Shanghai World Financial Center ({{convert|494|m|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and Shanghai Tower ({{convert|632|m|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or}}), the world's first trio of adjacent supertall skyscrapers. These buildings&mdash;all along Century Avenue and visible from the historic Bund&mdash;now form the most common [[skyline]] of Shanghai.\n\nOn May 6, 2009, it was disclosed that the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] had approved the proposal to merge [[Nanhui District]] with Pudong and comprise the majority of eastern Shanghai. In 2010, Pudong was host to the main venues of the [[Shanghai Expo]], whose grounds now form a [[Shanghai Expo Park|public park]].\n\nPudong New Area consist of the original Pudong County (northeastern portion of Shanghai County), [[Chuansha County]], and [[Nanhui District|Nanhui County]].\n\n==Government==\n[[District of China|Districts]] of the [[direct-controlled municipality]] of Shanghai are administratively on the same level as [[prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]]. However, the government of Pudong has a status equivalent to that of a [[sub-provincial city]], which is a half-level above a prefecture-level city. This is due to Pudong's size and importance as the financial hub of China. The Pudong Communist Party Secretary is the top office of the district, followed by the district governor of Pudong.  The Pudong party chief is customarily also a member of the Shanghai [[Party Standing Committee]].\n\nOn April 27, 2015, People's Government of Pudong New Area is working with China (Shanghai) Pilot Free-Trade Zone Administrative Committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ifeng.com/a/20150428/43646093_0.shtml |script-title=zh:\u4e0a\u6d77\u81ea\u8d38\u533a\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u59274\u500d \u5c06\u4e0e\u6d66\u4e1c\u65b0\u533a\u5408\u7f72\u529e\u516c |date=April 27, 2015|accessdate =April 27, 2015|publisher=People's Daily}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nPudong literally means \"East Bank\".

An extension brought the line further east, where it serves the [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport|airport]]. Other lines, namely Lines [[Line 4, Shanghai Metro|4]], [[Line 6, Shanghai Metro|6]], [[Line 7, Shanghai Metro|7]], [[Line 8, Shanghai Metro|8]], [[Line 9, Shanghai Metro|9]], [[Line 11, Shanghai Metro|11]], [[Line 12, Shanghai Metro|12]], [[Line 13, Shanghai Metro|13]] and [[Line 16, Shanghai Metro|16]] also have sections that serve parts of Pudong. A [[Shanghai Maglev Train|magnetic levitation train]] began operating in 2004, moving passengers between the airport and Longyang Road Metro station.\n[[Image:Huangpu River-The Bund.JPG|thumb|Ships on the Huangpu River with Pudong in view]]\n\nPudong is connected to [[Puxi]] by several tunnels and four major [[bridge]]s. The first of these bridges were the [[Nanpu Bridge]] (1991) and the [[Yangpu Bridge]] (1993).  The [[Xupu Bridge]] opened in 1996. The latest of these is [[Lupu Bridge]], which is the world's second longest [[arch bridge]] and was completed in 2002. Currently there are five tunnels that link the two sides, Dapu Rd. Tunnel, the first tunnel across the Huangpu River, Yan'an Rd. Tunnel, running east\u2013west, and Dalian Rd. Tunnel, running north\u2013south, [[Fuxing Rd.]] Tunnel, complementing the Yan'an Rd. Tunnel, Waihuan Tunnel, one part of Shanghai Outer Ring Express. Two new tunnels linking [[Lujiazui]] to [[Puxi]] are under construction.\n\nRoads in Pudong have no particular longitudinal or latitudinal orientation. Major thoroughfares Pudong Avenue, Zhangyang Road and Yanggao Road run east\u2013west until [[Yangpu Bridge]] before turning gradually to become north\u2013south. Century Avenue crosses all three major roads and extends from [[Lujiazui]] to Century Park. Yanggao Road extends south to the A20, Shanghai's outer Ring road, which runs east\u2013west from [[Xupu Bridge]] and then north\u2013south beginning at the interchange near Renxi Village, when the east\u2013west expressway turns into Yingbin Avenue, headed for Pudong International Airport.\n\n===Metro===\nPudong is currently served by ten metro lines and one tram line operated by [[Shanghai Metro]] and one maglev line operated by [[Shanghai Maglev Train]] and one suburban line operated by [[China Railway]]:\n\n*{{Rail color box|system=SHM|line=2|inline=yes}} -

The rest of the new area includes the [[Port of Shanghai]], the [[Shanghai Expo Park|Shanghai Expo]] and [[Century Park (Shanghai)|Century Park]], [[Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park]], [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]], the [[Jiuduansha Wetland Nature Reserve]], [[Nanhui New City]], and the [[Shanghai Disney Resort]].\n\n==History==\n''Pudong''&mdash;literally \"The East Bank of the Huangpu River\"&mdash;originally referred only to the less-developed land across from Shanghai's [[Old City of Shanghai|Old City]] and [[Shanghai International Settlement|foreign concessions]]. The area was mainly farmland and only slowly developed, with warehouses and wharfs near the shore administered by the districts of [[Puxi]] on the west bank: [[Huangpu District, Shanghai|Huangpu]], [[Yangpu District|Yangpu]], and [[Nanshi District, Shanghai|Nanshi]]. Pudong was originally established as a county in 1958 until 1961 which the county was split among [[Huangpu District, Shanghai|Huangpu]], [[Yangpu District|Yangpu]], [[Nanshi District, Shanghai|Nanshi]], [[Wusong District|Wusong]] and [[Chuansha County]]. In October 1, 1992 the original area of Pudong County and Chuansha County merged and established Pudong New Area.\n\nIn 1993, the Chinese government set up a [[Special Economic Zone]] in Chuansha, creating the Pudong New Area. The western tip of the Pudong district was designated as the [[Lujiazui|Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone]] and has become a financial hub of modern China.  Several landmark buildings were constructed, including the Oriental Pearl Tower, and the [[supertall]] Jin Mao Building ({{convert|420.5|m|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or}}), Shanghai World Financial Center ({{convert|494|m|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and Shanghai Tower ({{convert|632|m|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or}}), the world's first trio of adjacent supertall skyscrapers. These buildings&mdash;all along Century Avenue and visible from the historic Bund&mdash;now form the most common [[skyline]] of Shanghai.\n\nOn May 6, 2009, it was disclosed that the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] had approved the proposal to merge [[Nanhui District]] with Pudong and comprise the majority of eastern Shanghai. In 2010, Pudong was host to the main venues of the [[Shanghai Expo]], whose grounds now form a [[Shanghai Expo Park|public park]].\n\nPudong New Area consist of the original Pudong County (northeastern portion of Shanghai County), [[Chuansha County]], and [[Nanhui District|Nanhui County]].\n\n==Government==\n[[District of China|Districts]] of the [[direct-controlled municipality]] of Shanghai are administratively on the same level as [[prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]]. However, the government of Pudong has a status equivalent to that of a [[sub-provincial city]], which is a half-level above a prefecture-level city. This is due to Pudong's size and importance as the financial hub of China. The Pudong Communist Party Secretary is the top office of the district, followed by the district governor of Pudong.  The Pudong party chief is customarily also a member of the Shanghai [[Party Standing Committee]].\n\nOn April 27, 2015, People's Government of Pudong New Area is working with China (Shanghai) Pilot Free-Trade Zone Administrative Committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ifeng.com/a/20150428/43646093_0.shtml |script-title=zh:\u4e0a\u6d77\u81ea\u8d38\u533a\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u59274\u500d \u5c06\u4e0e\u6d66\u4e1c\u65b0\u533a\u5408\u7f72\u529e\u516c |date=April 27, 2015|accessdate =April 27, 2015|publisher=People's Daily}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nPudong literally means \"East Bank\". Pudong is bounded by the [[Huangpu River]] in the west and the [[East China Sea]] in the east. Pudong is distinguished from [[Puxi]] (\"West Bank\"), the older part of [[Shanghai]]. It has an area of {{convert|1210.4|km2}} and according to the [[Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China|2010 Census]], a population of 5,044,430 inhabitants, 1.9 million more than in 2000. Currently, at least 2.1 million of residents of Pudong are newcomers from other provinces or cities in China.<ref>{{in lang|zh}} China Statistical Office.

According to the [[Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China|2010 Census]], it has 5,044,430 people in 1,814,802 families, around 1/4 of Shanghai's total population, an explosive growth since the last census thanks to immigrants.<ref name=\"10thcencus\">Summary of Pudong Data from the Sixth National Population Census http://gov.pudong.gov.cn/pudongNews_inform/Info/Detail_365360.htm</ref> Pudong's resident population growth is well above national average because it is a popular immigration destination.

About 3/4 of the population live in the northern part and part of city center called \"Northern Territory\". 1/4 live in the \"Southern Territory\" that was the Nanhui District. The Northern Territory has a 6,667 population density, while the Southern Territory has 1,732/km<sup>2</sup>. Suburbs saw a greater increase in population during 2000-2010 with the help of the city's suburb expansion policy.

(2003), p. 1.</ref> }} [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (22 November 1635 \u2013 3 July 1672) was a psychiatric condition in which there was a persistent false belief and preoccupation with the idea of emitting abnormal body odors which the patient thought were foul and offensive to other individuals. He was born and raised at [[Middleton Hall, Warwickshire]], the only son of an affluent country family. He was a student at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he was tutored by the mathematician and naturalist [[John Ray]], who became a lifetime friend and colleague, and lived with Willughby after 1662 when he lost his livelihood through his refusal to sign the [[Act of Uniformity 1662|Act of Uniformity]]. Willughby was elected as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1661, then aged 27.\n\nWillughby, Ray, and others such as [[John Wilkins]] were advocates of a new way of studying science, relying on observation and classification, rather than the received authority of [[Aristotle]] and the Bible. To this end, Willughby, Ray and their friends undertook a number of journeys to gather information and specimens, initially in England and Wales, but culminating in an extensive tour of continental Europe, visiting museums, libraries and private collections as well as studying local animals and plants. After their continental tour, he and Ray lived and worked mainly at Middleton Hall. Willughby married Emma Barnard in 1668 and the couple had three children.\n\nWillughby had suffered bouts of illness over the years, and eventually died of [[pleurisy]] in July 1672, aged 36. His premature death meant that it fell to Ray to complete the works on animals they had jointly planned.

Furthermore, there were far more known species of fish than there were birds to describe, and Ray was working on his own ''History of Plants''.<ref name= birkhead241/><ref name=jardine303>Jardine (1999) pp. 303\u2013306.</ref> The ''Historia Piscium'' was finally published in Latin in 1686 with a dedication to [[Samuel Pepys]], President of the Royal Society, who had made a generous financial contribution to the project. The book had four sections: an introduction to fish biology; [[cetacea]]ns; [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fish]] (sharks and [[Batoidea|rays]]); and [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]], the last group being further classified by the number and nature of their fins. 187 plates completed the work, their cost making the book a financial disaster for the Royal Society, which had largely funded its publication.<ref name= birkhead241>Birkhead (2018) pp. 241\u2013245.</ref><ref name=jardine307>Jardine (1999) pp. 307\u2013310.</ref><ref name=Kusukawa309>Kusukawa (2016) p. 309.</ref>\n\n===\"Insects\"===\n[[File:Megachile willughbiella male (21626826474).jpg|thumb|upright=0.60|Willughby studied this [[Megachile|leaf-cutter bee]], named by [[William Kirby (entomologist)|Kirby]] in 1802 as ''[[Megachile willughbiella]]''.|alt=a bee on a flower]]\nIn the seventeenth century, the term \"insect\" had a much wider meaning than it does today, so the third major book, ''Historia Insectorum'', included many other [[invertebrate]]s, such as worms, spiders and [[millipede]]s. It excluded [[Mollusca|molluscs]], perhaps because [[Martin Lister]], another Fellow of the Royal Society, was writing his own ''Historia Animalium'' that covered that group. Ray's problems with completing this publication were much the same as with the fish book, although in 1704 he was able to see manuscripts prepared independently by Sir Thomas Willoughby and the scholar Thomas Man, Sir Thomas having moved into Wollaton Hall in 1687 and regained access to Middleton and his father's papers and possessions.<ref name= birkhead246>Birkhead (2018) pp. 246\u2013251.</ref>\n\nRay died in January 1705, and little happened with the ''Historia Insectorum'' until [[William Derham]] and the Royal Society finally published it in 1710 in Latin, incomplete, unillustrated and under Ray's name only.<ref name= birkhead246/> Ray, however, makes it clear that Willughby did the bulk of the insect research,<ref name=kusukawa336>Kusukawa (2016) pp. 336\u2013337.</ref> including, for example, 20 pages of beetle descriptions.<ref name=ogilvie352>Ogilvie (2016) p. 352.</ref> The book had four sections, starting with an innovative [[Taxonomy (biology)|classification system]] based on  [[metamorphosis]].<ref name= birkhead246/> The second section contained the main species descriptions, followed by Ray's observations of [[lepidoptera|butterflies and moths]] and their caterpillars, and an appendix by Martin Lister on British beetles.<ref name=ogilvie340>Ogilvie (2016) p. 340.</ref> Plates prepared by Sir Thomas Willoughby were not used, and they have now been lost, as have the manuscripts Sir Thomas showed to Ray.<ref name= birkhead246/>\n\n===Games and probability===\n[[File:Playingcardsvanda.jpg|thumb|upright=0.60|Willughby is believed to have studied [[probability]] with respect to card games.

Willughby's own extensive collection included paintings he had bought on his European travels, and he also borrowed pictures owned by friends like Skippon and Sir [[Thomas Browne]]. Many illustrations were taken from previous publications by other writers,<ref name= birkhead216>Birkhead (2018) pp. 216\u2013217.</ref> and some were based on [[Francis Barlow (artist)|Francis Barlow's]] oil-paintings of birds in [[Charles II of England|Charles II's]] [[aviary]] in [[St James's Park]].<ref name= birkhead227>Birkhead (2018) pp. 227\u2013228.</ref><ref name= jackson>Jackson (2006) pp. 114\u2013115.</ref>\n\nThe illustrations taken from earlier books were from many sources, particularly the earlier natural histories or ornithologies by [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]], [[Giovanni Pietro Olina|Pietro Olina]], [[Georg Marcgrave]] and [[Willem Piso]].<ref name= birkhead2016292>Birkhead ''et al'' (2016) pp. 292\u2013295.</ref> Where feasible, Willughby and Ray compared the available illustrations with life or specimens, or, if that were not possible, against each other, to select the most accurate version for publication.<ref name=flis/> In addition to these authors, sources used for the text included works by [[Carolus Clusius]], [[Adriaen Collaert]], [[Gervase Markham]], [[Juan Eusebio Nieremberg]] and [[Ole Worm]].<ref name= birkhead2016292/><ref name=Gurney>Gurney (1921) pp. [https://archive.org/details/cu31924005489558/page/n220 210\u2013211]</ref> Olina's ''Ucelliera'', at least, seems to have been revisited between the Latin and English editions of the ''Ornithology'', since the later version contains a description of [[territory (animal)|territorial]] behaviour by the [[common nightingale|nightingale]] absent from the earlier work.<ref name= birkhead2011223>Birkhead (2011) p. 223.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:FMIB 46268 Willoughby's Char.jpeg|thumb| Windermere or Willughby's charr, ''[[Salvelinus willughbii]]''|alt=Drawing of a trout-like fish]]\n\nMuch of Willughby's written work has been lost, along with his scientific equipment and most of his collections of items of natural history interest;<ref name =birkhead89>Birkhead (2018) pp. 89\u201393.</ref><ref name=charm>Charmantier ''et al'' (2016) pp. 360\u2013361.</ref> what remains is largely owned by the family and housed in the University of Nottingham Middleton archive.<ref name=charm373>Charmantier ''et al'' (2016) p. 373.</ref> The ''Ornithology'' influenced [[Ren\u00e9 Antoine Ferchault de R\u00e9aumur|R\u00e9amur]] in organising his great bird collection, and [[Mathurin Jacques Brisson|Brisson]] in the compilation of his own work on the topic.

He was born and raised at [[Middleton Hall, Warwickshire]], the only son of an affluent country family. He was a student at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he was tutored by the mathematician and naturalist [[John Ray]], who became a lifetime friend and colleague, and lived with Willughby after 1662 when he lost his livelihood through his refusal to sign the [[Act of Uniformity 1662|Act of Uniformity]]. Willughby was elected as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1661, then aged 27.\n\nWillughby, Ray, and others such as [[John Wilkins]] were advocates of a new way of studying science, relying on observation and classification, rather than the received authority of [[Aristotle]] and the Bible. To this end, Willughby, Ray and their friends undertook a number of journeys to gather information and specimens, initially in England and Wales, but culminating in an extensive tour of continental Europe, visiting museums, libraries and private collections as well as studying local animals and plants. After their continental tour, he and Ray lived and worked mainly at Middleton Hall. Willughby married Emma Barnard in 1668 and the couple had three children.\n\nWillughby had suffered bouts of illness over the years, and eventually died of [[pleurisy]] in July 1672, aged 36. His premature death meant that it fell to Ray to complete the works on animals they had jointly planned. In due course, Ray published books on birds, fish and [[invertebrate]]s, the ''Ornithologiae Libri Tres'', ''Historia Piscium'' and ''Historia Insectorum''. The ''Ornithology'' was also published in an expanded form in English. The books included innovative and effective ways of classifying animals, and all three were influential in the history of [[List of life sciences|life science]], including their effect on subsequent [[natural history]] writers and their importance in the development of [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus's]] [[binomial nomenclature]].\n\n==Early life==\n\n[[File:Middleton Hall 04.jpg|thumb|The Willughby family home at [[Middleton Hall, Warwickshire|Middleton Hall]]{{efn| Middleton Hall is a grade II* [[Listed building#Categories of listed buildings|listed building]].
