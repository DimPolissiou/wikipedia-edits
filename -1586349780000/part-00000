Phytoplankton live in the [[photic zone]] of the ocean, where [[photosynthesis]] is possible. During photosynthesis, they assimilate carbon dioxide and release oxygen. If solar radiation is too high, phytoplankton may fall victim to [[photodegradation]]. For growth, phytoplankton cells depend on nutrients, which enter the ocean by rivers, continental weathering, and glacial ice meltwater on the poles. Phytoplankton release [[dissolved organic carbon]] (DOC) into the ocean. Since phytoplankton are the basis of [[marine food web]]s, they serve as prey for [[zooplankton]], [[fish larvae]] and other [[heterotrophic]] organisms. They can also be degraded by bacteria or by [[viral lysis]].

Culture sizes range from small-scale [[laboratory]] cultures of less than 1L to several tens of thousands of liters for commercial aquaculture.<ref name=mcvey/> Regardless of the size of the culture, certain conditions must be provided for efficient growth of plankton. The majority of cultured plankton is marine, and [[seawater]] of a [[specific gravity]] of 1.010 to 1.026 may be used as a culture medium. This water must be [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]], usually by either high temperatures in an [[autoclave]] or by exposure to [[ultraviolet radiation]], to prevent [[biological]] [[contamination]] of the culture. Various [[fertilizers]] are added to the culture medium to facilitate the growth of plankton. A culture must be aerated or agitated in some way to keep plankton suspended, as well as to provide dissolved [[carbon dioxide]] for [[photosynthesis]]. In addition to constant aeration, most cultures are manually mixed or stirred on a regular basis. Light must be provided for the growth of phytoplankton. The [[colour temperature]] of illumination should be approximately 6,500 K, but values from 4,000 K to upwards of 20,000 K have been used successfully. The duration of light exposure should be approximately 16 hours daily; this is the most efficient artificial day length.<ref name=mcvey/>\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{commons category|Phytoplankton}}\n{{commons category|Algal blooms}}\n{{div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Algae}}\n* {{annotated link|Algaculture}}\n* {{annotated link|AlgaeBase}}\n* {{annotated link|Bacterioplankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Biological pump}}\n* {{annotated link|CLAW hypothesis}}\n* {{annotated link|Cyanobacteria}}\n* {{annotated link|Freshwater phytoplankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Iron fertilization}}\n* {{annotated link|Microphyte}} (microalgae)\n* {{annotated link|Ocean acidification}}\n* {{annotated link|Paradox of the plankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Photosynthetic picoplankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Plankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Whiting event}}\n* {{annotated link|Zooplankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Thin layers (oceanography)}}\n* {{annotated link|Harmful algal bloom}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite book |last1=Greeson |first1=Phillip E. |year=1982 |title=An annotated key to the identification of commonly occurring and dominant genera of Algae observed in the Phytoplankton of the United States |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/wsp2079 |isbn=978-0-607-68844-3 }}\n*{{cite book |last1=Kirby |first1=Richard R. |year=2010 |title=Ocean Drifters: A Secret World Beneath the Waves |publisher=Studio Cactus  |isbn=978-1-904239-10-9 }}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Martin |first1=Ronald |last2=Quigg |first2=Antonietta |title=Tiny Plants That Once Ruled the Seas |journal=Scientific American |volume=308 |issue=6 |year=2013 |pages=40\u20135 |pmid=23729069 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0613-40 |bibcode=2013SciAm.308f..40M }}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.secchidisk.org Secchi Disk and Secchi app], a citizen science project to study the phytoplankton\n* [http://vimeo.com/84872751/ Ocean Drifters], a short film narrated by David Attenborough about the varied roles of plankton\n* [http://www.planktonchronicles.org/en Plankton Chronicles], a short documentary films & photos\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150214081038/http://saga.pmel.noaa.gov/review/dms_climate.html DMS and Climate], NOAA\n* [http://planktonnet.awi.de/ Plankton*Net], images of planktonic species\n\n{{plankton|state=expanded}}\n{{aquatic ecosystem topics|expanded=none}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Aquatic ecology]]\n[[Category:Biological oceanography]]\n[[Category:Planktology]]\n[[Category:Climate change]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description| Autotrophic members of the plankton ecosystem }}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n[[File:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Diatom]]s are one of the most common types of phytoplankton.]]\n\n'''Phytoplankton''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|f|a\u026a|t|o\u028a|\u02c8|p|l|\u00e6|\u014b|k|t|\u0259|n}}) are the [[autotrophic]] (self-feeding) components of the [[plankton]] community and a key part of oceans, seas and freshwater basin [[Aquatic ecosystem|ecosystem]]s.

Both utilize phytoplankton as food for the animals being farmed. In mariculture, the phytoplankton is naturally occurring and is introduced into enclosures with the normal circulation of seawater. In aquaculture, phytoplankton must be obtained and introduced directly. The plankton can either be collected from a body of water or cultured, though the former method is seldom used. Phytoplankton is used as a foodstock for the production of [[rotifers]],<ref name=mcvey>McVey, James P., Nai-Hsien Chao, and Cheng-Sheng Lee. CRC Handbook of Mariculture Vol. 1 : Crustacean Aquaculture. New York: C R C P LLC, 1993.{{page needed|date=February 2016}}</ref> which are in turn used to feed other organisms. Phytoplankton is also used to feed many varieties of aquacultured [[molluscs]], including [[pearl]] [[oysters]] and [[giant clam]]s. A 2018 study estimated the nutritional value of natural phytoplankton in terms of carbohydrate, protein and lipid across the world ocean using ocean-colour data from satellites,<ref name=sroy>{{cite journal|last1=Roy|first1=Shovonlal|title=Distributions of phytoplankton carbohydrate, protein and lipid in the world oceans from satellite ocean colour|journal=The ISME Journal|volume=12|issue=6|pages=1457\u20131472|date=12 February 2018|doi=10.1038/s41396-018-0054-8|pmid=29434313|pmc=5955997|language=En|issn=1751-7370}}</ref> and found the calorific value of phytoplankton to vary considerably across different oceanic regions and between different time of the year.<ref name=sroy/><ref>{{cite news|title=Nutrition study reveals instability in world's most important fishing regions|url=https://phys.org/news/2018-02-nutrition-reveals-instability-world-important.html}}</ref>\n\nThe production of phytoplankton under artificial conditions is itself a form of aquaculture. Phytoplankton is cultured for a variety of purposes, including foodstock for other aquacultured organisms,<ref name=mcvey/> a nutritional supplement for captive [[invertebrates]] in [[Aquarium|aquaria]]. Culture sizes range from small-scale [[laboratory]] cultures of less than 1L to several tens of thousands of liters for commercial aquaculture.<ref name=mcvey/> Regardless of the size of the culture, certain conditions must be provided for efficient growth of plankton. The majority of cultured plankton is marine, and [[seawater]] of a [[specific gravity]] of 1.010 to 1.026 may be used as a culture medium. This water must be [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]], usually by either high temperatures in an [[autoclave]] or by exposure to [[ultraviolet radiation]], to prevent [[biological]] [[contamination]] of the culture. Various [[fertilizers]] are added to the culture medium to facilitate the growth of plankton. A culture must be aerated or agitated in some way to keep plankton suspended, as well as to provide dissolved [[carbon dioxide]] for [[photosynthesis]]. In addition to constant aeration, most cultures are manually mixed or stirred on a regular basis. Light must be provided for the growth of phytoplankton. The [[colour temperature]] of illumination should be approximately 6,500 K, but values from 4,000 K to upwards of 20,000 K have been used successfully. The duration of light exposure should be approximately 16 hours daily; this is the most efficient artificial day length.<ref name=mcvey/>\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{commons category|Phytoplankton}}\n{{commons category|Algal blooms}}\n{{div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Algae}}\n* {{annotated link|Algaculture}}\n* {{annotated link|AlgaeBase}}\n* {{annotated link|Bacterioplankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Biological pump}}\n* {{annotated link|CLAW hypothesis}}\n* {{annotated link|Cyanobacteria}}\n* {{annotated link|Freshwater phytoplankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Iron fertilization}}\n* {{annotated link|Microphyte}} (microalgae)\n* {{annotated link|Ocean acidification}}\n* {{annotated link|Paradox of the plankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Photosynthetic picoplankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Plankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Whiting event}}\n* {{annotated link|Zooplankton}}\n* {{annotated link|Thin layers (oceanography)}}\n* {{annotated link|Harmful algal bloom}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite book |last1=Greeson |first1=Phillip E. |year=1982 |title=An annotated key to the identification of commonly occurring and dominant genera of Algae observed in the Phytoplankton of the United States |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/wsp2079 |isbn=978-0-607-68844-3 }}\n*{{cite book |last1=Kirby |first1=Richard R. |year=2010 |title=Ocean Drifters: A Secret World Beneath the Waves |publisher=Studio Cactus  |isbn=978-1-904239-10-9 }}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Martin |first1=Ronald |last2=Quigg |first2=Antonietta |title=Tiny Plants That Once Ruled the Seas |journal=Scientific American |volume=308 |issue=6 |year=2013 |pages=40\u20135 |pmid=23729069 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0613-40 |bibcode=2013SciAm.308f..40M }}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.secchidisk.org Secchi Disk and Secchi app], a citizen science project to study the phytoplankton\n* [http://vimeo.com/84872751/ Ocean Drifters], a short film narrated by David Attenborough about the varied roles of plankton\n* [http://www.planktonchronicles.org/en Plankton Chronicles], a short documentary films & photos\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150214081038/http://saga.pmel.noaa.gov/review/dms_climate.html DMS and Climate], NOAA\n* [http://planktonnet.awi.de/ Plankton*Net], images of planktonic species\n\n{{plankton|state=expanded}}\n{{aquatic ecosystem topics|expanded=none}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Aquatic ecology]]\n[[Category:Biological oceanography]]\n[[Category:Planktology]]\n[[Category:Climate change]]\n", "name_user": "185.70.52.93", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eCarbon)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton"}

The nation now has a tiered governmental system consisting of a [[federal government]] overseeing ethnically based regional states, zones, [[Districts of Ethiopia|districts]] (''woreda''), and ''[[kebele]]s'' (\"neighbourhoods\").\n\nSince 1996, Ethiopia has been divided into nine ethnically-based and politically autonomous [[Regions of Ethiopia|regional states]] (''kililoch'', singular ''kilil''&thinsp;) and two chartered cities (''astedader akababiwoch'', singular ''astedader akababi''&thinsp;), the latter being [[Addis Ababa]] and [[Dire Dawa]]. The ''kililoch'' are subdivided into sixty-eight [[Zones of Ethiopia|zones]], and then further into 550 ''woredas'' and several special ''woredas''.\n\nThe constitution assigns extensive power to regional states, which can establish their own government and democracy as long as it is in line with the federal government's constitution. Each region has at its apex a regional council where members are directly elected to represent the districts and the council has legislative and executive power to direct internal affairs of the regions.\n\nArticle 39 of the Ethiopian Constitution further gives every regional state the right to secede from Ethiopia. There is debate, however, as to how much of the power guaranteed in the constitution is actually given to the states. The councils implement their mandate through an executive committee and regional sectoral bureaus. Such elaborate structure of council, executive, and sectoral public institutions is replicated to the next level (''woreda'').\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"| Region or city (\u12ad\u120d\u120d/\u12e8\u12a8\u1270\u121b \u12a0\u1235\u1270\u12f3\u12f5\u122d)\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Capital\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Area {{smaller|{{nobold|(km<sup>2</sup>)}}}}\n! colspan=\"4\" | Population<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csa.gov.et/Central |title=Statistical Agency of Ethiopia, 2005\u20132013 |accessdate=2 May 2017 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n|-\n!

It lies between the [[3rd parallel north]] and the [[15th parallel north]] and longitudes [[33rd meridian east]] and [[48th meridian east]].\n\nThe major portion of Ethiopia lies in the [[Horn of Africa]], which is the easternmost part of the African landmass. The territories that have frontiers with Ethiopia are Eritrea to the north and then, moving in a clockwise direction, Djibouti, the ''de facto'' state of [[Somaliland]], Somalia, Kenya, South Sudan and Sudan. Within Ethiopia is a vast highland complex of mountains and dissected plateaus divided by the [[Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia|Great Rift Valley]], which runs generally southwest to northeast and is surrounded by lowlands, [[steppe]]s, or semi-desert. There is a great diversity of terrain with wide variations in climate, soils, natural vegetation and settlement patterns.\n\nEthiopia is an ecologically diverse country, ranging from the deserts along the eastern border to the tropical forests in the south to extensive [[Afromontane]] in the northern and southwestern parts. [[Lake Tana]] in the north is the source of the [[Blue Nile]]. It also has many [[endemism|endemic]] species, notably the [[gelada]], the [[walia ibex]] and the [[Ethiopian wolf]] (\"Simien fox\"). The wide range of altitude has given the country a variety of ecologically distinct areas, and this has helped to encourage the evolution of endemic species in ecological isolation.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Geography of Ethiopia#Climate}}\n[[File:Semien Mountains 13.jpg|thumb|[[Semien Mountains]]]]\n\nThe predominant climate type is tropical monsoon, with wide topographic-induced variation. The [[Ethiopian Highlands]] cover most of the country and have a climate which is generally considerably cooler than other regions at similar proximity to the Equator. Most of the country's major cities are located at elevations of around {{convert|2000|\u2013|2500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, including historic capitals such as Gondar and Axum.\n[[File:Wonchi Lake of Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|left|Wonchi Lake]]\nThe modern capital, Addis Ababa, is situated on the foothills of [[Mount Entoto]] at an elevation of around {{convert|2400|m}}. It experiences a mild climate year round. With temperatures fairly uniform year round, the seasons in Addis Ababa are largely defined by rainfall: a dry season from October to February, a light rainy season from March to May, and a heavy rainy season from June to September. The average annual rainfall is approximately {{convert|1200|mm|}}.\n\nThere are on average seven hours of sunshine per day. The dry season is the sunniest time of the year, though even at the height of the rainy season in July and August there are still usually several hours per day of bright sunshine. The average annual temperature in Addis Ababa is {{convert|16|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}, with daily maximum temperatures averaging {{convert|20|-|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} throughout the year, and overnight lows averaging {{convert|5|-|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}.\n\nMost major cities and tourist sites in Ethiopia lie at a similar elevation to Addis Ababa and have a comparable climate. In less elevated regions, particularly the lower lying [[Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands]] in the east of the country, the climate can be significantly hotter and drier. Dallol, in the [[Danakil Depression]] in this eastern zone, has the world's highest average annual temperature of {{convert|34|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}.\n\n==Environment==\n{{see also|Environmental issues in Ethiopia}}\n\n===Wildlife===\n{{Main|Wildlife of Ethiopia}}\n[[File:Canis simensis -Simien Mountains, Ethiopia-8.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Ethiopian wolf]]]]\n\nEthiopia has 31 endemic species of mammals.<ref name=\"Massicot\"/> The [[African wild dog]] prehistorically had widespread distribution in the territory. However, with last sightings at [[Finicha'a]], this canid is thought to be potentially [[local extinction|locally extinct]]. The Ethiopian wolf is perhaps the most researched of all the endangered species within Ethiopia.\n\nEthiopia is a global center of avian diversity.

As people moved from rural areas to the cities, there were fewer people to grow food for the population. The Land Reform Act was meant to increase agriculture since food production was not keeping up with population growth over the period of 1970\u20131983. This program proliferated the formation of peasant associations, large villages based on agriculture. The act did lead to an increase in food production, although there is debate over the cause; it may be related to weather conditions more than the reform act.<ref name=\"Anderson, Frank 1991.

The current system follows school expansion schemes which are very similar to the system in the rural areas during the 1980s, with an addition of deeper regionalization, providing rural education in students' own languages starting at the elementary level, and with more budget finances allocated to the education sector. The sequence of general education in Ethiopia is six years of primary school, four years of lower secondary school and two years of higher secondary school.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Teferra|first1=Damtew|last2=Altbach|first2=Philip G.|title=African Higher Education: An International Reference Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RROdAAAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-34186-0|pages= 316\u201325}}</ref>\n\nAccess to education in Ethiopia has improved significantly.

Children add the [[given name]]s of their father and paternal grandfather consecutively to their own given name. For compatibility purposes, as is done in passports, the grandfather's given name is taken as a family [[surname]], and a person's given name and their father's given name form the first names.\n\nEveryone is addressed by their given name. In official situations, the prefixes ''Ato'' ('''\u12a0\u1276''') is used for men; ''Weyzero'' ('''\u12c8\u12ed\u12d8\u122e''') for married women; and ''Weyzer\u012bt'' ('''\u12c8\u12ed\u12d8\u122a\u1275''') for unmarried women.\n\n===Calendar===\n{{Main|Ethiopian calendar|Oromo calendar}}\n[[File:Celebrate The Return of Axum Obelisk (Detail) (3172365788).jpg|thumb|Model commemorating the [[Obelisk of Axum|Obelisk of Aksum]]'s return to Ethiopia from Italy, showing the date of its departure and return according to the [[Ethiopian calendar]]]]\n\nEthiopia has several local calendars. The most widely known is the [[Ethiopian calendar]], also known as the Ge'ez calendar. It is based on the older Alexandrian or [[Coptic calendar]], which in turn derives from the [[Egyptian calendar]]. Like the Coptic calendar, the Ethiopian calendar has twelve months of exactly 30 days each plus five or six [[epagomenal]] days, which comprise a thirteenth month. The Ethiopian months begin on the same days as those of the Coptic calendar, but their names are in Ge'ez.\n\nLike the [[Julian calendar]], the sixth epagomenal day\u2014which in essence is a [[leap day]]\u2014is added every four years without exception on 29 August of the Julian calendar, six months before the Julian leap day. Thus, the first day of the Ethiopian year, 1{{nbsp}}M\u00e4sk\u00e4r\u00e4m, for years between 1901 and 2099 (inclusive), is usually 11 September ([[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]), but falls on 12 September in years before the Gregorian leap year. Also, a seven- to eight-year gap between the Ethiopian and Gregorian calendars results from an alternate calculation in determining the date of the [[Annunciation]] of [[Jesus]].\n\nAnother calendrical system was developed around 300 BC by the [[Oromo people|Oromo]]. A lunar-stellar calendar, this [[Oromo calendar]] relies on astronomical observations of the moon in conjunction with seven particular stars or constellations. Oromo months (stars/lunar phases) are Bittottessa (Iangulum), Camsa (Pleiades), Bufa (Aldebarran), Waxabajjii (Belletrix), Obora Gudda (Central Orion-Saiph), Obora Dikka (Sirius), Birra (full moon), Cikawa (gibbous moon), Sadasaa (quarter moon), Abrasa (large crescent), Ammaji (medium crescent), and Gurrandala (small crescent).<ref>{{cite web|first=Lawrence R |last=Doyle |url=http://www.tusker.com/Archaeo/art.currentanthro.htm |title=The Borana Calendar Reinterpreted |work=tusker.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029073246/http://www.tusker.com/Archaeo/art.currentanthro.htm |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Time===\n\n[[Time in Ethiopia]] is counted differently from most countries. The Ethiopian day is reckoned as beginning at 06:00 as opposed to 00:00, coinciding with sunrise throughout the year. To convert between the Ethiopian clock and Western clocks, one must add (or subtract) six hours to the Western time. For example, 02:00 local Addis Ababa time is called \"8 at night\" in Ethiopia, while 20:00 is called \"2 in the evening\".\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Ethiopian cuisine}}\n{{see also|List of Ethiopian dishes and foods}}\n[[File:Alicha 1.jpg|thumb|Typical Ethiopian cuisine: ''[[injera]]'' (pancake-like bread) and several kinds of ''wat'' (stew)]]\n\nThe best-known [[Ethiopian cuisine]] consists of various types of thick [[meat]] [[stew]]s, known as ''[[wat (food)|wat]]'' in Ethiopian culture, and [[vegetable]] side dishes served atop [[injera]], a large [[sourdough]] [[flatbread]] made of [[teff]] flour. This is not eaten with utensils, but instead one uses the injera to scoop up the entr\u00e9es and side dishes.

The nation now has a tiered governmental system consisting of a [[federal government]] overseeing ethnically based regional states, zones, [[Districts of Ethiopia|districts]] (''woreda''), and ''[[kebele]]s'' (\"neighbourhoods\").\n\nSince 1996, Ethiopia has been divided into nine ethnically-based and politically autonomous [[Regions of Ethiopia|regional states]] (''kililoch'', singular ''kilil''&thinsp;) and two chartered cities (''astedader akababiwoch'', singular ''astedader akababi''&thinsp;), the latter being [[Addis Ababa]] and [[Dire Dawa]]. The ''kililoch'' are subdivided into sixty-eight [[Zones of Ethiopia|zones]], and then further into 550 ''woredas'' and several special ''woredas''.\n\nThe constitution assigns extensive power to regional states, which can establish their own government and democracy as long as it is in line with the federal government's constitution. Each region has at its apex a regional council where members are directly elected to represent the districts and the council has legislative and executive power to direct internal affairs of the regions.\n\nArticle 39 of the Ethiopian Constitution further gives every regional state the right to secede from Ethiopia. There is debate, however, as to how much of the power guaranteed in the constitution is actually given to the states. The councils implement their mandate through an executive committee and regional sectoral bureaus.

It lies between the [[3rd parallel north]] and the [[15th parallel north]] and longitudes [[33rd meridian east]] and [[48th meridian east]].\n\nThe major portion of Ethiopia lies in the [[Horn of Africa]], which is the easternmost part of the African landmass. The territories that have frontiers with Ethiopia are Eritrea to the north and then, moving in a clockwise direction, Djibouti, the ''de facto'' state of [[Somaliland]], Somalia, Kenya, South Sudan and Sudan. Within Ethiopia is a vast highland complex of mountains and dissected plateaus divided by the [[Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia|Great Rift Valley]], which runs generally southwest to northeast and is surrounded by lowlands, [[steppe]]s, or semi-desert. There is a great diversity of terrain with wide variations in climate, soils, natural vegetation and settlement patterns.\n\nEthiopia is an ecologically diverse country, ranging from the deserts along the eastern border to the tropical forests in the south to extensive [[Afromontane]] in the northern and southwestern parts. [[Lake Tana]] in the north is the source of the [[Blue Nile]]. It also has many [[endemism|endemic]] species, notably the [[gelada]], the [[walia ibex]] and the [[Ethiopian wolf]] (\"Simien fox\"). The wide range of altitude has given the country a variety of ecologically distinct areas, and this has helped to encourage the evolution of endemic species in ecological isolation.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Geography of Ethiopia#Climate}}\n[[File:Semien Mountains 13.jpg|thumb|[[Semien Mountains]]]]\n\nThe predominant climate type is tropical monsoon, with wide topographic-induced variation. The [[Ethiopian Highlands]] cover most of the country and have a climate which is generally considerably cooler than other regions at similar proximity to the Equator. Most of the country's major cities are located at elevations of around {{convert|2000|\u2013|2500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, including historic capitals such as Gondar and Axum.\n[[File:Wonchi Lake of Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|left|Wonchi Lake]]\nThe modern capital, Addis Ababa, is situated on the foothills of [[Mount Entoto]] at an elevation of around {{convert|2400|m}}. It experiences a mild climate year round. With temperatures fairly uniform year round, the seasons in Addis Ababa are largely defined by rainfall: a dry season from October to February, a light rainy season from March to May, and a heavy rainy season from June to September. The average annual rainfall is approximately {{convert|1200|mm|}}.\n\nThere are on average seven hours of sunshine per day. The dry season is the sunniest time of the year, though even at the height of the rainy season in July and August there are still usually several hours per day of bright sunshine. The average annual temperature in Addis Ababa is {{convert|16|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}, with daily maximum temperatures averaging {{convert|20|-|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} throughout the year, and overnight lows averaging {{convert|5|-|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}.\n\nMost major cities and tourist sites in Ethiopia lie at a similar elevation to Addis Ababa and have a comparable climate. In less elevated regions, particularly the lower lying [[Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands]] in the east of the country, the climate can be significantly hotter and drier. Dallol, in the [[Danakil Depression]] in this eastern zone, has the world's highest average annual temperature of {{convert|34|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}.\n\n==Environment==\n{{see also|Environmental issues in Ethiopia}}\n\n===Wildlife===\n{{Main|Wildlife of Ethiopia}}\n[[File:Canis simensis -Simien Mountains, Ethiopia-8.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Ethiopian wolf]]]]\n\nEthiopia has 31 endemic species of mammals.<ref name=\"Massicot\"/> The [[African wild dog]] prehistorically had widespread distribution in the territory. However, with last sightings at [[Finicha'a]], this canid is thought to be potentially [[local extinction|locally extinct]]. The Ethiopian wolf is perhaps the most researched of all the endangered species within Ethiopia.\n\nEthiopia is a global center of avian diversity. To date more than 856 bird species have been recorded in Ethiopia, twenty of which are endemic to the country.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lepage|first=Denis|title=Bird Checklists of the World|url=http://avibase.bsc-eoc.org/checklist.jsp?region=et&list=clements|publisher=Avibase|accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref> Sixteen species are endangered or critically endangered.

In 1959, Egypt and Sudan signed a bilateral treaty, the [[Water politics in the Nile Basin|1959 Nile Waters Agreement]], which gave both countries exclusive maritime rights over the Nile waters. Ever since, Egypt has discouraged almost all projects in Ethiopia that sought to utilize the local Nile tributaries. This had the effect of discouraging external financing of hydropower and irrigation projects in western Ethiopia, thereby impeding water resource-based economic development projects. However, Ethiopia is in the process of constructing a large 6,450 MW hydroelectric dam on the Blue Nile river. When completed, this [[Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam]] is slated to be the largest hydroelectric power station in Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/31/business/ethiopia-grand-renaissance-dam/index.html|title=Ethiopia powers on with controversial dam project |author1= Victoria Eastwood |author2=Nima Elbagir|access-date=24 June 2016}}</ref> \n\nThe [[Gilgel Gibe III Dam|Gibe III]] hydroelectric project is so far the largest in the country with an installed capacity of 1,870&nbsp;MW.

Children add the [[given name]]s of their father and paternal grandfather consecutively to their own given name. For compatibility purposes, as is done in passports, the grandfather's given name is taken as a family [[surname]], and a person's given name and their father's given name form the first names.\n\nEveryone is addressed by their given name. In official situations, the prefixes ''Ato'' ('''\u12a0\u1276''') is used for men; ''Weyzero'' ('''\u12c8\u12ed\u12d8\u122e''') for married women; and ''Weyzer\u012bt'' ('''\u12c8\u12ed\u12d8\u122a\u1275''') for unmarried women.\n\n===Calendar===\n{{Main|Ethiopian calendar|Oromo calendar}}\n[[File:Celebrate The Return of Axum Obelisk (Detail) (3172365788).jpg|thumb|Model commemorating the [[Obelisk of Axum|Obelisk of Aksum]]'s return to Ethiopia from Italy, showing the date of its departure and return according to the [[Ethiopian calendar]]]]\n\nEthiopia has several local calendars. The most widely known is the [[Ethiopian calendar]], also known as the Ge'ez calendar. It is based on the older Alexandrian or [[Coptic calendar]], which in turn derives from the [[Egyptian calendar]]. Like the Coptic calendar, the Ethiopian calendar has twelve months of exactly 30 days each plus five or six [[epagomenal]] days, which comprise a thirteenth month. The Ethiopian months begin on the same days as those of the Coptic calendar, but their names are in Ge'ez.\n\nLike the [[Julian calendar]], the sixth epagomenal day\u2014which in essence is a [[leap day]]\u2014is added every four years without exception on 29 August of the Julian calendar, six months before the Julian leap day. Thus, the first day of the Ethiopian year, 1{{nbsp}}M\u00e4sk\u00e4r\u00e4m, for years between 1901 and 2099 (inclusive), is usually 11 September ([[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]), but falls on 12 September in years before the Gregorian leap year. Also, a seven- to eight-year gap between the Ethiopian and Gregorian calendars results from an alternate calculation in determining the date of the [[Annunciation]] of [[Jesus]].\n\nAnother calendrical system was developed around 300 BC by the [[Oromo people|Oromo]]. A lunar-stellar calendar, this [[Oromo calendar]] relies on astronomical observations of the moon in conjunction with seven particular stars or constellations. Oromo months (stars/lunar phases) are Bittottessa (Iangulum), Camsa (Pleiades), Bufa (Aldebarran), Waxabajjii (Belletrix), Obora Gudda (Central Orion-Saiph), Obora Dikka (Sirius), Birra (full moon), Cikawa (gibbous moon), Sadasaa (quarter moon), Abrasa (large crescent), Ammaji (medium crescent), and Gurrandala (small crescent).<ref>{{cite web|first=Lawrence R |last=Doyle |url=http://www.tusker.com/Archaeo/art.currentanthro.htm |title=The Borana Calendar Reinterpreted |work=tusker.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029073246/http://www.tusker.com/Archaeo/art.currentanthro.htm |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Time===\n\n[[Time in Ethiopia]] is counted differently from most countries. The Ethiopian day is reckoned as beginning at 06:00 as opposed to 00:00, coinciding with sunrise throughout the year. To convert between the Ethiopian clock and Western clocks, one must add (or subtract) six hours to the Western time. For example, 02:00 local Addis Ababa time is called \"8 at night\" in Ethiopia, while 20:00 is called \"2 in the evening\".\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Ethiopian cuisine}}\n{{see also|List of Ethiopian dishes and foods}}\n[[File:Alicha 1.jpg|thumb|Typical Ethiopian cuisine: ''[[injera]]'' (pancake-like bread) and several kinds of ''wat'' (stew)]]\n\nThe best-known [[Ethiopian cuisine]] consists of various types of thick [[meat]] [[stew]]s, known as ''[[wat (food)|wat]]'' in Ethiopian culture, and [[vegetable]] side dishes served atop [[injera]], a large [[sourdough]] [[flatbread]] made of [[teff]] flour.

For example, according to this thinking, programs that satisfy both employees' [[need]]s and stockholders' [[want]]s are doubly valuable because they address two legitimate sets of stakeholders at the same time. There is evidence that the combined effects of such a policy are not only additive but even multiplicative. For instance, by simultaneously addressing customer wishes in addition to employee and stockholder interests, both of the latter two groups also benefit from increased sales.\n# Supporters also take issue with the preeminent role given to stockholders by many business thinkers, especially in the past. The argument is that debt holders, employees, and suppliers also make contributions and thus also take risks in creating a successful firm.\n# These [[Normative economics|normative]] arguments would matter little if [[stockholders]] ([[shareholders]]) had complete control in guiding the firm.  However, many believe that due to certain kinds of [[board of directors]] structures, top managers like [[Chief executive officer|CEOs]] are mostly in control of the firm.\n# The greatest value of a company is its image and brand. By attempting to fulfill the needs and wants of many different people ranging from the local population and customers to their own employees and owners, companies can prevent damage to their image and brand, prevent losing large amounts of sales and disgruntled customers, and prevent costly legal expenses. While the stakeholder view has an increased cost, many firms have decided that the concept improves their image, increases sales, reduces the risks of liability for [[corporate negligence]], and makes them less likely to be targeted by pressure groups, campaigning groups and NGOs.\n\nA corporate stakeholder can affect or be affected by the actions of a business as a whole. Whereas [[shareholder]]s are often the party with the most direct and obvious interest [[wikt:at stake#Prepositional phrase|at stake]] in business decisions, they are one of various subsets of stakeholders, as [[customer]]s and [[employment#Employees and employers|employees]] also have [[wikt:stake#Noun|stakes]] in the outcome. In the most developed sense of stakeholders in terms of real [[corporate social responsibility|corporate responsibility]], the bearers of [[externality|externalities]] are included in stakeholdership.\n\n== In management ==\nIn the last decades of the 20th century, the word \"stakeholder\" became more commonly used to mean a person or organization that has a legitimate interest in a project or entity. In discussing the decision-making process for institutions\u2014including large business [[corporation]]s, [[government agency|government agencies]], and [[non-profit organization]]s\u2014the concept has been broadened to include everyone with an interest (or \"stake\") in what the entity does. This includes not only vendors, [[Employment|employees]], and [[customer]]s, but even members of a community where its offices or factory may affect the local economy or environment. In this context, a \"stakeholder\" includes not only the directors or trustees on its governing board (who are stakeholders in the traditional sense of the word) but also all persons who paid into the figurative stake and the persons to whom it may be \"paid out\" (in the sense of a \"payoff\" in [[game theory]], meaning the outcome of the transaction). Therefore, in order to effectively engage with a community of stakeholders, the organisation's management needs to be aware of the stakeholders, understand their wants and expectations, understand their attitude (supportive, neutral or opposed), and be able to prioritize the members of the overall community to focus the organisation's scarce resources on the most significant stakeholders.<ref>[http://www.stakeholdermapping.com/stakeholder-management-resources/#Books Stakeholder Relationship Management: A Maturity Model for Organisational Implementation], Dr. Lynda Bourne, 2007</ref>\n\n'''Example'''\n\n*For example, in the case of a professional landlord undertaking the refurbishment of some rented housing that is occupied while the work is being carried out, key stakeholders would be the residents, neighbors (for whom the work is a nuisance), and the tenancy-management team and housing-maintenance team employed by the landlord. Other stakeholders would be funders and the design-and-construction team.\n\nThe holders of each separate kind of interest in the entity's affairs are called a ''constituency,'' so there may be a constituency of [[Shareholder|stockholders]], a constituency of adjoining property owners, a constituency of [[bank]]s the entity owes money to, and so on.  In that usage, \"constituent\" is a synonym for \"stakeholder\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shiller|first1=R|year=2003|title=From Efficient Markets Theory to Behavioral Finance|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=17|issue=1|pages=83\u2013104|doi=10.1257/089533003321164967}}</ref>\n\n== Stakeholder theory ==\n{{Main|Stakeholder theory}}\nPost, Preston, Sachs (2002), use the following definition of the term \"stakeholder\":\n\"A person, group or organization that has interest or concern in an organization.\nStakeholders can affect or be affected by the organization's actions, objectives and policies. Some examples of key stakeholders are creditors, directors, employees, government (and its agencies), owners (shareholders), suppliers, unions, and the community from which the business draws its resources.\nNot all stakeholders are equal. A company's customers are entitled to fair trading practices but they are not entitled to the same consideration as the company's employees. The stakeholders in a corporation are the individuals and constituencies that contribute, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to its wealth-creating capacity and activities, and that are therefore its potential beneficiaries and/or risk bearers.\"<ref>http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=1967</ref> This definition differs from the older definition of the term stakeholder in [[Stakeholder theory]] (Freeman, 1983) that also includes competitors as stakeholders of a corporation. [[Robert Allen Phillips]] provides a moral foundation for stakeholder theory in ''Stakeholder Theory and Organizational Ethics''. There he defends a \"principle of stakeholder fairness\" based on the work of [[John Rawls]], as well as a distinction between normative and derivative legitimate stakeholders. Real stakeholders, labelled stakeholders: genuine stakeholders with a legitimate stake, the loyal partners who strive for mutual benefits. Stake owners own and deserve a stake in the firm.

For examples these are parents, children, customers, owners, employees, associates, partners, contractors, and suppliers, people that are related or located nearby.

For example, according to this thinking, programs that satisfy both employees' [[need]]s and stockholders' [[want]]s are doubly valuable because they address two legitimate sets of stakeholders at the same time. There is evidence that the combined effects of such a policy are not only additive but even multiplicative. For instance, by simultaneously addressing customer wishes in addition to employee and stockholder interests, both of the latter two groups also benefit from increased sales.\n# Supporters also take issue with the preeminent role given to stockholders by many business thinkers, especially in the past. The argument is that debt holders, employees, and suppliers also make contributions and thus also take risks in creating a successful firm.\n# These [[Normative economics|normative]] arguments would matter little if [[stockholders]] ([[shareholders]]) had complete control in guiding the firm.  However, many believe that due to certain kinds of [[board of directors]] structures, top managers like [[Chief executive officer|CEOs]] are mostly in control of the firm.\n# The greatest value of a company is its image and brand. By attempting to fulfill the needs and wants of many different people ranging from the local population and customers to their own employees and owners, companies can prevent damage to their image and brand, prevent losing large amounts of sales and disgruntled customers, and prevent costly legal expenses. While the stakeholder view has an increased cost, many firms have decided that the concept improves their image, increases sales, reduces the risks of liability for [[corporate negligence]], and makes them less likely to be targeted by pressure groups, campaigning groups and NGOs.\n\nA corporate stakeholder can affect or be affected by the actions of a business as a whole. Whereas [[shareholder]]s are often the party with the most direct and obvious interest [[wikt:at stake#Prepositional phrase|at stake]] in business decisions, they are one of various subsets of stakeholders, as [[customer]]s and [[employment#Employees and employers|employees]] also have [[wikt:stake#Noun|stakes]] in the outcome. In the most developed sense of stakeholders in terms of real [[corporate social responsibility|corporate responsibility]], the bearers of [[externality|externalities]] are included in stakeholdership.\n\n== In management ==\nIn the last decades of the 20th century, the word \"stakeholder\" became more commonly used to mean a person or organization that has a legitimate interest in a project or entity. In discussing the decision-making process for institutions\u2014including large business [[corporation]]s, [[government agency|government agencies]], and [[non-profit organization]]s\u2014the concept has been broadened to include everyone with an interest (or \"stake\") in what the entity does. This includes not only vendors, [[Employment|employees]], and [[customer]]s, but even members of a community where its offices or factory may affect the local economy or environment. In this context, a \"stakeholder\" includes not only the directors or trustees on its governing board (who are stakeholders in the traditional sense of the word) but also all persons who paid into the figurative stake and the persons to whom it may be \"paid out\" (in the sense of a \"payoff\" in [[game theory]], meaning the outcome of the transaction). Therefore, in order to effectively engage with a community of stakeholders, the organisation's management needs to be aware of the stakeholders, understand their wants and expectations, understand their attitude (supportive, neutral or opposed), and be able to prioritize the members of the overall community to focus the organisation's scarce resources on the most significant stakeholders.<ref>[http://www.stakeholdermapping.com/stakeholder-management-resources/#Books Stakeholder Relationship Management: A Maturity Model for Organisational Implementation], Dr. Lynda Bourne, 2007</ref>\n\n'''Example'''\n\n*For example, in the case of a professional landlord undertaking the refurbishment of some rented housing that is occupied while the work is being carried out, key stakeholders would be the residents, neighbors (for whom the work is a nuisance), and the tenancy-management team and housing-maintenance team employed by the landlord. Other stakeholders would be funders and the design-and-construction team.\n\nThe holders of each separate kind of interest in the entity's affairs are called a ''constituency,'' so there may be a constituency of [[Shareholder|stockholders]], a constituency of adjoining property owners, a constituency of [[bank]]s the entity owes money to, and so on.  In that usage, \"constituent\" is a synonym for \"stakeholder\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shiller|first1=R|year=2003|title=From Efficient Markets Theory to Behavioral Finance|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=17|issue=1|pages=83\u2013104|doi=10.1257/089533003321164967}}</ref>\n\n== Stakeholder theory ==\n{{Main|Stakeholder theory}}\nPost, Preston, Sachs (2002), use the following definition of the term \"stakeholder\":\n\"A person, group or organization that has interest or concern in an organization.\nStakeholders can affect or be affected by the organization's actions, objectives and policies. Some examples of key stakeholders are creditors, directors, employees, government (and its agencies), owners (shareholders), suppliers, unions, and the community from which the business draws its resources.\nNot all stakeholders are equal. A company's customers are entitled to fair trading practices but they are not entitled to the same consideration as the company's employees. The stakeholders in a corporation are the individuals and constituencies that contribute, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to its wealth-creating capacity and activities, and that are therefore its potential beneficiaries and/or risk bearers.\"<ref>http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=1967</ref> This definition differs from the older definition of the term stakeholder in [[Stakeholder theory]] (Freeman, 1983) that also includes competitors as stakeholders of a corporation. [[Robert Allen Phillips]] provides a moral foundation for stakeholder theory in ''Stakeholder Theory and Organizational Ethics''. There he defends a \"principle of stakeholder fairness\" based on the work of [[John Rawls]], as well as a distinction between normative and derivative legitimate stakeholders. Real stakeholders, labelled stakeholders: genuine stakeholders with a legitimate stake, the loyal partners who strive for mutual benefits. Stake owners own and deserve a stake in the firm. Stakeholder reciprocity could be an innovative criterion in the corporate governance debate as to who should be accorded representation on the board. Corporate social responsibility should imply a corporate stakeholder responsibility.\n\n== Examples of a company's stakeholders ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Stakeholders:\n!

European settlement of the area dates from 1763, when King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] granted a charter for land in the [[Winooski River]] valley. James Marsh became the first permanent white settler in the region in 1783. Many of the early settlers came from [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Connecticut]], and named their new town in honor of the hometown.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The village of Waterbury was incorporated in 1882 with a population of over 2,000.\n\nThe [[Central Vermont Railroad]] came to Waterbury in 1849.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.greatamericanstations.com/stations/waterbury-vt-wab/|title=Waterbury, VT (WAB)|work=Great American Stations|access-date=2017-03-03|language=en-US}}</ref> The railroad expanded a passenger station for the railroad in 1875, making the station a more major stop on the Vermonter.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[Green Mountain Seminary]] was built in Waterbury Center in 1869.\n\nThe state opened the Vermont State Asylum for the Insane here in 1891.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crjc.org/heritage/V02-34.htm|title=Brattleboro Retreat (Vermont Asylum for the Insane)|last=Sanders|first=Stephen|date=1984-04-12|website=www.crjc.org|access-date=2008-05-13}}</ref> The hospital, renamed the [[Vermont State Hospital]], grew to occupy over 40 buildings, but by the 1980s the number of patients had declined to the point where only one building was required.

The mills produced products such as [[lumber]] and finished wood products, wicker products, leather, starch, and alcohol. The agriculture was based on [[sheep husbandry|sheep]] through the 19th century but switched over to [[dairy farming]] by the 20th century. Waterbury had a ski factory in the 1940s, the Derby & Ball Company.\n\nIn 1927, Waterbury, like many other Vermont communities, was devastated by [[flood]]ing. Inscriptions on the sides of some buildings in Waterbury village purport to show where the level of the water rose during the [[Great Vermont Flood of 1927|1927 flood]].
