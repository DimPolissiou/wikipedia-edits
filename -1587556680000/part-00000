The phrase may be used either to refer to the period of time or the academic discipline.\n\nThe span of [[recorded history]] is roughly 5,000 years, beginning with the [[Sumer]]ian [[cuneiform]] script, with the oldest coherent texts from about 2600 BC.<ref>See also ''The Origin and Development of the Cuneiform System of Writing'', [[Samuel Noah Kramer]], ''Thirty Nine Firsts In Recorded History'', pp. 381\u2013383.</ref> Ancient history covers all continents inhabited by humans in the period 3000 BC \u2013 AD 500.\n\nThe broad term \"ancient history\" is not to be confused with \"classical antiquity\". The term [[classical antiquity]] is often used to refer to [[Western world#Historical divisions|Western history]] in the [[History of the Mediterranean region|Ancient Mediterranean]] from the beginning of recorded Greek history in 776 BC (first [[Olympiad]]). This roughly coincides with the traditional date of the [[founding of Rome]] in 753 BC, the beginning of the history of [[ancient Rome]], and the beginning of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] in [[Ancient Greece]].\n\nThe academic term \"history\" is not to be confused with colloquial references to times past. History is fundamentally the study of the past, and can be either scientific ([[archaeology]]) or [[Humanistic historiography|humanistic]] (history through language).\n\nAlthough the ending date of ancient history is disputed, some [[Western culture|Western]] scholars use the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in 476 AD (the most used),<ref>Clare, I.S.

According to HYDE estimates from the Netherlands, world population increased exponentially in this period. In 10,000 BC in [[prehistory]], the world population had stood at 2 million, rising to 45 million by 3,000 BC.  By the rise of the [[Iron Age]] in 1,000 BC, the population had risen to 72 million. By the end of the period in 500 AD, the world population is thought to have stood at 209 million.

Although it is important to take into account the bias of each ancient author, their accounts are the basis for our understanding of the ancient past. Some of the more notable ancient writers include [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]], [[Arrian]], [[Plutarch]], [[Polybius]], [[Sima Qian]], [[Sallust]], [[Livy]], [[Josephus]], [[Suetonius]], and [[Tacitus]].\n\nA fundamental difficulty of studying ancient history is that [[recorded history|recorded histories]] cannot document the entirety of human events, and only a fraction of those documents have survived into the present day.<ref name=\"GardnerP\">Gardner, P.

[[Thucydides]] largely eliminated divine causality in his account of the war between Athens and Sparta,<ref name=\"Cochrane, Charles Norris 1929. p. 179\">Cochrane, Charles Norris.

(1989). Ancient literacy. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. p. 175.</ref> but many works by its most widely read historians are lost. For example, [[Livy]], a Roman historian who lived in the 1st century BC, wrote a history of Rome called ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' (''From the Founding of the City'') in 144 volumes; only 35 volumes still exist, although short summaries of most of the rest do exist.

It follows the [[Neolithic Age]] in some areas of the world. In most areas of civilization bronze smelting became a foundation for more advanced societies.

From Sumer, civilization and bronze smelting spread westward to Egypt, the [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]] and the [[Hittites]].\n\nThe [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]] of the 22nd century BC was followed by the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] between the 21st to 17th centuries BC. The [[Sumerian Renaissance]] also developed c. the 21st century BC in [[Ur]]. Around the 18th century BC, the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt]] began. Egypt was a superpower at the time. By 1600 BC, [[Mycenaean Greece]] developed and invaded the remains of [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Civilization]]. The beginning of [[Hittites|Hittite]] dominance of the Eastern [[Mediterranean]] region is also seen in the 1600s BC. The time from the 16th to the 11th centuries BC around the Nile is called the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]]. Between 1550 BC and 1292 BC, the [[Amarna Period]] developed in Egypt.\n\nEast of Iranian world, was the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus River Valley civilization]] which organized cities neatly on grid patterns.<ref>{{Cite book|title=World History Cultures, States and Society to 1500|last=Berger|first=Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|last4=Parkinson|first4=Brian|last5=Reeves|first5=Andrew|last6=Williams|first6=Nadejda|publisher=University of North Georgia, Press|isbn=978-1-940771-10-6|location=Dahlonega, Georgia|page=79|date=2016-09-30}}</ref>\nHowever the Indus River Valley civilization diminished after 1900 BC and was later replaced with [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Ayran peoples]] who established [[Vedic period|Vedic Culture]].\n\nThe beginning of the [[Shang dynasty]] emerged in China in this period, and there was evidence of a fully developed [[Chinese writing system]]. The Shang Dynasty is the first Chinese regime recognized by western scholars though Chinese historians insist that the [[Xia dynasty|Xia Dynasty]] preceded it. The Shang Dynasty practiced forced labor to complete public projects. There is evidence of massive ritual burial.\n\nAcross the ocean, the earliest known civilization of the Americas appeared in the river valleys of the dessertic coast of central modern day Peru. The Norte Chico civilization's first city flourished around 3100 BC.  The Olmecs are supposed to appear later in [[Mesoamerica]] between the 14th and 13th century.\n\n====Early Iron Age====\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2018}}{{Main|Iron Age}}\n\nThe [[Iron Age]] is the last principal period in the three-age system, preceded by the Bronze Age. Its date and context vary depending on the country or geographical region. The Iron Age over all was characterized by the prevalent smelting of iron with [[Ferrous metallurgy]] and the use of [[Carbon steel]]. Smelted iron proved more durable than earlier metals such as [[Copper]] or [[Bronze]] and allowed for more productive societies. The Iron Age took place at different times in different parts of the world, and comes to an end when a society began to maintain historical records.[[File:Bronze Age End.svg|thumb|500x500px|Map of the [[late Bronze Age collapse]], c. 1200 BC|alt=|center]]During the 13th to 12th centuries BC, the [[Ramesside Period]] occurred in Egypt.

Simon & Schuster {{ISBN|0-7432-6441-X}}</ref> By around 1180&nbsp;BC, the disintegration of the [[Hittite Empire]] was under way. The collapse of the Hitties was part of the larger scale Bronze Age Collapse which took place in the Ancient Near East around 1200&nbsp;BC. In Greece the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenae]] and [[Minoan civilization|Minona]] both disintegrated. A wave of [[Sea Peoples]] attacked many countries, only [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] survived intact. Afterwards some entirely new successor civilizations arose in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nIn 1046 BC, the Zhou force, led by [[King Wu of Zhou]], overthrew the last king of the Shang dynasty. The [[Zhou dynasty]] was established in China shortly thereafter. During this Zhou era China embraced a feudal society of decentralized power. Iron Age China then dissolved into the [[Warring States period|warring states]] period where possibly millions of soldiers fought each other over feudal struggles.\n\n[[Pirak]] is an early iron-age site in [[Balochistan]], [[Pakistan]], going back to about 1200&nbsp;BC.

The [[Axial Age]] is used to describe history between 800 and 200 BC of Eurasia, including [[Ancient Greece]], [[History of Iran|Iran]], [[Middle kingdoms of India|India]] and [[History of China|China]]. Widespread trade and communication between distinct regions in this period, including the rise of the [[Silk Road]]. This period saw the rise of [[philosophy]] and proselytizing religions.\n\nPhilosophy, religion and science were diverse in the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] producing thinkers such as [[Confucius]], [[Laozi|Lao Tzu]] and [[Mozi]] during the sixth century BC. Similar trends emerged throughout Eurasia in India with the rise of [[Early Buddhism|Buddhism]], in the Near East with [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Judaism]] and in the west with [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek Philosophy]]. In these developments religious and philosophical figures were all searching for human meaning.<ref name = \"Neville\">{{cite book | last = Neville | first = Robert Cummings | title=Religion in Late Modernity | url= https://books.google.com/?id=OWkrdZ2yh3EC&pg=PA104&vq=%22Axial+Age | year = 2002 | publisher = SUNY Press | isbn =978-0-7914-5424-4 | page = 104}}</ref>\n\nThe Axial Age and its aftermath saw large wars and the formation of large empires that stretched beyond the limits of earlier Iron Age Societies. Significant for the time was the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Achaemenid Empire]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peter|first=Turchin|date=14 April 2012|title=Religion and Empire in the Axial Age|url=http://peterturchin.com/PDF/Bellah_RBB.pdf|journal=Religion, Brain & Behavior|volume=|page=3|via=}}</ref> The empire's vast territory extended from modern day [[Egypt]] to [[Xinjiang]]. The empire's legacy include the rise of commerce over land routes through Eurasia as well as the spreading of Persian culture through the middle east. The [[Royal Road]] allowed for efficient trade and taxation.  Though Macedonian [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in its entirety, the unity of Alexander's conquests did not survive past his lifetime. Greek culture, and technology spread through West and South Asia often synthesizing with local cultures.\n\n'''Formation of Empires and Fragmentation'''\n\nSeparate [[Diadochi|Greek Kingdoms]] Egypt and Asia encouraged trade and communication like earlier Persian administrations.<ref>\"Mastering World History\" by Philip L. Groisser, New York, 1970, p.17</ref> Combined with the expansion of the [[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]] westward the [[Silk Road]] as a series of routes made possible the exchange of goods between the Mediterranean Basin, South Asia and East Asia.  In South Asia, the Mauryan empire briefly annexed much of the Indian Subcontinent though short lived, its reign had the legacies of spreading Buddhism and providing an inspiration to later Indian states.\n\nSupplanting the warring Greek Kingdoms in the western world came the growing [[Roman Republic]] and the Iranian [[Parthian Empire]].  As a result of empires, urbanization and literary spread to locations which had previously been at the periphery of civilization as known by the large empires. Upon the turn of the millennium the independence of tribal peoples and  smaller kingdoms were threatened by more advanced states. Empires were not just remarkable for their territorial size but for their administration and the dissemination of culture and trade, in this way the influence of empires often extended far beyond their national boundaries. Trade routes expanded by land and sea and allowed for flow of goods between distant regions even in the absence of communication. Distant nations such as Imperial Rome and the Chinese Han Dynasty [[Sino-Roman relations|rarely communicated]] but trade of goods did occur as evidenced by  archaeological discoveries such as Roman coins in Vietnam. At this time most of the world's population inhabited only a small part of the earth's surface. Outside of civilization large geographic areas such as [[Siberia]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub Saharan Africa]] and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] remained sparsely populated. The [[New World]] hosted a variety of separate civilizations in the but its own trade networks were smaller due to the lack of draft animals and the wheel.\n\nEmpires with their immense military strength remained fragile to civil wars, economic decline and a changing political environment internationally. In 220 AD Han China collapsed into [[Three Kingdoms|warring states]] while the European Roman Empire began to suffer from turmoil in the [[Crisis of the Third Century|Third Century Crisis]]. In Persia regime change took place from [[Parthia|Parthian Empire]] to the more centralized [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian Empire]]. The land based Silk Road continued to deliver profits in trade but came under continual assault by nomads all on the northern frontiers of Eurasian nations. Safer sea routes began to gain preference in the early centuries AD\n\nProselytizing religions began to replace [[polytheism]] and [[folk religion]]s in many areas. [[History of Christianity|Christianity]] gained a wide following in the Roman Empire, [[Zoroastrianism]] became the state enforced religion of Iran and [[History of Buddhism|Buddhism]] spread to East Asia from South Asia. Social change, political transformation as well as ecological events all contributed to the end of Ancient Times and the beginning of the Post Classical era in Eurasia roughly around the year 500.\n\n==Developments==\n\n===Religion and philosophy===\n{{Main|Axial age|History of philosophy|Development of religion|History of religion}}\n{{Further|Axial Age|Religions of the Ancient Near East|Ancient Egyptian religion|Historical Vedic religion|Ancient Greek religion|Hellenistic philosophy|Roman imperial cult|Early Christianity|Decline of Greco-Roman polytheism}}\n[[File:Museo Barracco - Giove Ammone 1010637.JPG|alt=Jupiter Ammon|thumb|Roman cast [[terracotta]] of ram-horned ''Jupiter Ammon'', a form of [[Zeus]] 1st century AD. Gods, could sometimes be transferred or adopted by many civilizations, and then adjusted for local conditions.]]\nThe rise of civilization corresponded with the institutional sponsorship of belief in gods, supernatural forces and the afterlife. During the [[Bronze Age]], many civilizations adopted their own form of [[Polytheism]]. Usually, polytheistic Gods manifested human personalities, strengths and failings.  Early religion was often based on location, with cities or entire countries selecting a deity, that would grant them preferences and advantages over their competitors. Worship involved the construction of representation of deities, and the granting of sacrifices. Sacrifices could be material goods, food, or in extreme cases human sacrifice to please a deity.   New [[philosophy|philosophies]] and [[religions]] arose in both east and west, particularly about the 6th century BC. Over time, a great variety of religions developed around the world, with some of the earliest major ones being [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]] in [[India]], and [[Zoroastrianism]] in [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]]. The [[Abrahamic religion]]s trace their origin to [[Judaism]], around 1800 BC.\n\nThe ancient [[Indian philosophy]] is a fusion of two ancient traditions: [[Sramana]] tradition and [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic tradition]]. Indian philosophy begins with the ''[[Vedas]]'' where questions related to laws of nature, the origin of the universe and the place of man in it are asked. Jainism and Buddhism are continuation of the Sramana school of thought. The Sramanas cultivated a pessimistic world view of the samsara as full of suffering and advocated renunciation and austerities. They laid stress on philosophical concepts like [[Ahimsa]], [[Karma]], [[Jnana]], [[Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra|Samsara]] and [[Moksha|Moksa]]. While there are ancient relations between the Indian [[Vedas]] and the Iranian [[Avesta]], the two main families of the [[Iranian philosophy|Indo-Iranian philosophical traditions]] were characterized by fundamental differences in their implications for the human being's position in society and their view on the role of man in the universe.\n\nIn the east, three schools of thought were to dominate [[China|Chinese]] thinking until the modern day. These were [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] and [[Confucianism]]. The Confucian tradition, which would attain dominance, looked for [[political]] [[morality]] not to the force of law but to the power and example of tradition. Confucianism would later spread into the [[Korean peninsula]] and [[Goguryeo]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skkok.com/?_page=43 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081713/http://www.skkok.com/?_page=43 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-07-16 |title= \uc790\ub791\uc2a4\ub7f0 \uc131\uade0\uad00 \uaf43\ud53c\uc6b0\ub294 \uc720\uad50\ubb38\ud654 \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \uc778\uc131\uad50\uc721 \uc131\uade0\uad00 \uc608\uc808\uad50\uc2e4  |publisher=Skkok.com |accessdate=2010-01-09}}</ref> and toward [[Japan]].\n\nIn the west, the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophical tradition, represented by [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]], was diffused throughout [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] in the 4th century BC by the conquests of [[Alexander III of Macedon]], more commonly known as [[Alexander the Great]]. After the [[Bronze and Iron Age religion]]s formed, the rise and spread of [[Christianity]] through the Roman world marked the end of [[Hellenistic]] philosophy and ushered in the beginnings of [[Medieval philosophy]].\n\n===Science and technology===\n{{Main|Ancient technology}}\n{{Further|History of science in early cultures|History of mathematics}}\n{{Ancient technology}}\n[[File:Pont Du Gard.jpg|thumb|The [[Pont du Gard]], a Roman aqueduct in France.]]\n\nIn the [[history of technology]] and [[ancient science]] during the growth of the ancient civilizations, [[ancient technology|ancient technological]] advances were produced in [[engineering]].

Traditional [[Chinese medicine]], [[acupuncture]] and herbal medicine were also practiced.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n[[Ancient Greek technology]] developed at an unprecedented speed during the 5th century BC, continuing up to and including the Roman period, and beyond. Inventions that are credited to the ancient Greeks such as the gear, screw, bronze casting techniques, water clock, water organ, torsion catapult and the use of steam to operate some experimental machines and toys. Many of these inventions occurred late in the Greek period, often inspired by the need to improve weapons and tactics in war. [[Roman technology]] is the engineering practice which supported Roman civilization and made the expansion of Roman commerce and Roman military possible over nearly a thousand years. The Roman Empire had the most advanced set of technology of their time, some of which may have been lost during the turbulent eras of Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. Roman technological feats of many different areas, like civil engineering, construction materials, transport technology, and some inventions such as the mechanical reaper went unmatched until the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Maritime activity===\n{{Main|Ancient maritime history}}\n\nThe history of ancient navigation began in earnest when men took to the sea in [[Plank (wood)|planked]] boats and ships propelled by [[sail]]s hung on [[Mast (sailing)|masts]], like the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Khufu ship]] from the mid-3rd millennium BC. According to the [[Greece|Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]], [[Necho II]] sent out an expedition of [[Phoenicians]], which in three years sailed from the [[Red Sea]] around [[Africa]] to the mouth of the [[Nile]]. Many current historians tend to believe Herodotus on this point, even though Herodotus himself was in disbelief that the Phoenicians had accomplished the act.\n\n[[Hannu]] was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[exploration|explorer]] (around 2750 BC) and the first explorer of whom there is any knowledge. He made the first recorded exploring expedition, writing his account of his exploration in stone. Hannu travelled along the Red Sea to [[Punt (region)|Punt]], and sailed to what is now part of eastern [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]]. He returned to Egypt with great treasures, including precious [[myrrh]], [[metals|metal]] and [[wood]].\n\n===Warfare===\n[[File:Ballista (PSF) vector.svg|left|thumb|Technical drawing of Roman [[Ballista]] mechanism. ]]\n{{Main|Ancient warfare}}\n\n[[Ancient warfare]] is war as conducted from the beginnings of recorded history to the end of the ancient period. In Europe, the end of antiquity is often equated with the fall of Rome in 476. In China, it can also be seen as ending in the 5th century, with the growing role of mounted warriors needed to counter the ever-growing threat from the north.\n\nThe difference between [[prehistoric warfare]] and ancient warfare is less one of technology than of organization. The development of the first [[city-state]]s, and then [[empire]]s, allowed warfare to change dramatically. Beginning in [[Mesopotamia]], states produced sufficient agricultural surplus that full-time ruling elites and military commanders could emerge. While the bulk of military forces were still farmers, the society could support having them campaigning rather than working the land for a portion of each year. Thus, organized armies developed for the first time.\n\nThese new armies could help states grow in size and became increasingly centralized, and the first empire, that of the [[Sumer]]ians, formed in Mesopotamia. Early ancient armies continued to primarily use [[bow and arrow|bows]] and [[spear]]s, the same weapons that had been developed in prehistoric times for hunting. Early armies in [[Egypt]] and [[China]] followed a similar pattern of using massed infantry armed with bows and spears.\n\n===Artwork and music===\n{{Ancient art history}}\n\n{{Main|Ancient art history|Ancient music|Ancient art}}\n\n[[Ancient music]] is music that developed in literate cultures, replacing prehistoric music. Ancient music refers to the various musical systems that were developed across various geographical regions such as Persia, India, China, Greece, Rome, Egypt and Mesopotamia (see [[music of Mesopotamia]], [[music of ancient Greece]], [[music of ancient Rome]], [[music of Iran]]). Ancient music is designated by the characterization of the basic audible tones and scales. It may have been transmitted through oral or written systems. [[Ancient art|Arts of the ancient world]] refers to the many types of art that were in the cultures of ancient societies, such as those of ancient China, Egypt, Greece, India, Persia, Mesopotamia and Rome.\n\n==Timelines==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Comparative timeline===\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:835 height:500\nPlotArea = left:100 right:20 top:20 bottom:20\nAlignBars = justify\n\nColors =\n    id:time value:rgb(0.7,0.7,1) #\n    id:period value:rgb(1,0.7,0.5) #\n    id:age value:rgb(0.95,0.85,0.5) #\n    id:era value:rgb(1,0.85,0.5) #\n    id:eon value:rgb(1,0.85,0.7) #\n    id:filler value:gray(0.8) # background bar\n    id:black value:black\n\nPeriod     = from:-3000 till:1000\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:500 start:-3000\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:100 start:-3000\n\nBarData =\n  bar:ages text:\"Historical Ages........\"\n  bar:Time text:Age\n\n  bar:blank\n  bar:sw_asia text:\"South-west Asia......\"\n  bar:Mes.  text:Mes.\n  bar:Elam  text:Elam\n  bar:Ach.  text:Ach.\n\n  bar:blank\n  bar:africa text:\"Africa......................\"\n  bar:Egypt text:Egypt\n  bar:Kush  text:Kush\n  bar:Aksumite text:Aksumite\n  bar:Carthage text:Carthage\n\n  bar:blank\n  bar:s_asia text:\"South Asia..............\"\n  bar:Indus.Valley\n\n  bar:blank\n  bar:e_asia text:\"East Asia.................\"\n  bar:China\n\n  bar:blank\n  bar:americas text:\"Americas.................\"\n  bar:N.Americas text:N.Americas\n  bar:C.Americas text:C.Americas\n  bar:S.Americas text:S.Americas\n\n  bar:blank\n  bar:eur text:\"Europe.....................\"\n  bar:Europe\n\nPlotData =\n  align:center textcolor:black fontsize:8 mark:(line,black) width:15 shift:(0,-5)\n\n  bar:ages color:skyblue from: start till: end text:\"Historical ages\"\n  bar:Time color:period\n  from: -3000 till: -1200 text:[[Bronze Age]]\n  from: -1200 till: 400 text:[[Iron Age]]\n  from: 400 till: 1000 text:[[postclassical age|Middle Ages]]\n\n  bar:blank at:-3000\n  bar:sw_asia color:skyblue from: start till: end text:\"Southwest Asia (Near East)\"\n  bar:Mes. color:era\n  from: -3000 till: -750 text:[[Mesopotamia]]\n  bar:Elam color:era\n  from: -3000 till: -2700 shift:(8,0) text:Proto-Elamite\n  from: -2700 till: -1500 text:Old Elamite\n  from: -1500 till: -1100 text:Middle Elamite\n  from: -1100 till: -539 text:Neo-Elamite\n  bar:Ach. color:era\n  from: -550 till: -330 text:[[Achaemenid Empire]]\n\n  bar:blank at:-3000\n  bar:africa color:skyblue from: start till: end text:\"Africa\"\n  bar:Egypt  color:age\n  from: -3000 till: -30 text:[[Ancient Egypt]]\n\n  bar:Kush color: era\n  from: -3000 till: -1650 text: Kerma\n  from: -1650 till: -1070 text: Ancient Egypt\n  from: -1070 till: -591 text: Napata\n  from: -591 till: 350 text: Meroe\n\n  bar:Aksumite color:age\n  from: -400 till: 940 text:[[Aksumite Empire]]\n  bar:Carthage color:eon\n  from: -650 till: 146 text:[[Ancient Carthage]]\n\n  bar:blank at:-3000\n  bar:s_asia color:skyblue from: start till: end text:\"South Asia\"\n  bar:Indus.Valley color:era\n  from: -3000 till: -1200 text:[[Indus Valley Civilization]]\n  from: -1200 till: -180 text:[[Iron Age India]]\n  from: -180 till: 1 text:[[Indo-Greeks]]\n  from: 1 till: 1000 text:[[Middle kingdoms of India]]\n\n  bar:blank at:-3000\n  bar:e_asia color:skyblue from: start till: end text:\"East Asia\"\n  bar:China color:era\n  from: -3000 till: -2000 text:[[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors]]\n  from: -2000 till: -200 text:[[Ancient China]]\n  from: -200 till: 1000 text:[[Imperial China]]\n\n  bar:blank at:-3000\n  bar:americas color:skyblue from: start till: end text:\"Americas\"\n  bar:N.Americas color:age\n  from: -3000 till: -1500 text:Archaic\n  from: -1500 till: 650 text:Classic\n  from:  650 till: 1000 text:Pre-Columbian\n  bar:C.Americas color:era\n  from: -3000 till: -1500 text:Archaic\n  from: -1500 till: 250 text:Formative\n  from:  250 till: 900 text:Classic\n  from:  900 till: 1000 text:Postclassic\n  bar:S.Americas color:age\n  from: -3000 till: -1900 text:Archaic\n  from: -1900 till: 200 text:Preclassic\n  from: 200 till: 1000 text:Classic\n\n  bar:blank at:-3000\n  bar:eur color:skyblue from: start till: end text:\"Europe\"\n  bar:Europe color:era\n  from: -3000 till: -1200 text:Archaic\n  from: -1200 till: -650 text:[[Phoenicia]]\n  from: -650 till: -146 text:[[Ancient Greece]]\n  from: -146 till: 1000 text:[[Ancient Rome]]\n\n# add here\n</timeline>\n\n===Comparison table===\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"font-size:90%; border=; margin:auto;\" 1\"\n|- style=\"background:#f8eaba; fontsize:105%; textalign:center;\"\n!

It was the first to practice intensive year-round [[agriculture]]; created the first [[history of writing|coherent writing system]], invented the [[potter's wheel]] and then the vehicular- and mill [[wheel]], created the first [[centralized government]]s, [[law code]]s and [[empire]]s, as well as introducing [[social stratification]], [[slavery]] and organized [[warfare]], and it laid the foundation for the fields of [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]].\n\n[[File:Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia c. 1450 BC.png|thumb|Overview map in the 15th century BC showing the core territory of [[Assyria]] with its two major cities [[Assur]] and [[Nineveh]] wedged between [[Babylonia]] downstream and the states of [[Mitanni]] and [[Hittite Empire|Hatti]] upstream.|alt=|center|368x368px]]\n\n====Mesopotamia====\n{{further|Mesopotamia|History of Iraq}}\n\n[[Mesopotamia]] is the site of some of the earliest known [[civilization]]s in the world. Early settlement of the alluvial plain lasted from the [[Ubaid period]] (late 6th millennium BC) through the [[Uruk period]] (4th millennium BC) and the Dynastic periods (3rd millennium BC) until the rise of [[Babylon]] in the early 2nd millennium BC. The surplus of storable foodstuffs created by this economy allowed the population to settle in one place instead of migrating after crops and herds. It also allowed for a much greater population density, and in turn required an extensive labor force and [[division of labor]]. This organization led to the necessity of record keeping and the development of [[history of writing|writing]] (c. 3500 BC).\n\n[[Babylonia]] was an [[Amorite]] state in lower [[Mesopotamia]] (modern southern [[Iraq]]), with Babylon as its capital. Babylonia emerged when [[Hammurabi]] (fl. c. 1728\u20131686 BC, according to the [[short chronology]]) created an empire out of the territories of the former kingdoms of [[Sumer]] and [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]. The Amorites being [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]], Babylonia adopted the written [[Akkadian language]] for official use; they retained the [[Sumerian language]] for religious use, which by that time was no longer a spoken language. The Akkadian and Sumerian cultures played a major role in later Babylonian culture, and the region would remain an important cultural center, even under outside rule. The earliest mention of the city of [[Babylon]] can be found in a tablet from the reign of [[Sargon of Akkad]], dating back to the 23rd century BC.\n\nThe [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], or [[Chaldea]], was Babylonia under the rule of the 11th (\"Chaldean\") dynasty, from the revolt of [[Nabopolassar]] in 626 BC until the invasion of [[Cyrus the Great]] in 539 BC. Notably, it included the reign of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], who conquered the [[Kingdom of Judah]] and [[Jerusalem]].\n\nAkkad was a city and its surrounding region in central Mesopotamia. Akkad also became the capital of the [[Akkadian Empire]].<ref name=\"WebsterNinthNewCollege\">Mish, Frederick C., Editor in Chief. \"Akkad.\" ''[[Webster's Dictionary#The Collegiate Dictionary|Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary]]''. 9th ed.

Despite an extensive search, the precise site has never been found. Akkad reached the height of its power between the 24th and 22nd centuries BC, following the conquests of king Sargon of Akkad. Because of the policies of the Akkadian Empire toward linguistic assimilation, Akkad also gave its name to the predominant Semitic dialect: the Akkadian language, reflecting use of ''akkad\u00fb'' (\"in the language of Akkad\") in the Old Babylonian period to denote the Semitic version of a Sumerian text.\n\n[[Assyria]] was originally (in the [[Middle Bronze Age]]) a region on the Upper [[Tigris]], named for its original capital, the ancient city of [[Assur]]. Later, as a nation and empire that came to control all of the [[Fertile Crescent]], [[Egypt]] and much of [[Anatolia]], the term \"Assyria proper\" referred to roughly the northern half of Mesopotamia (the southern half being Babylonia), with [[Nineveh]] as its capital. The Assyrian kings controlled a large kingdom at three different times in history. These are called the ''Old'' (20th to 15th centuries BC), ''Middle'' (15th to 10th centuries BC), and ''[[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]]'' (911\u2013612 BC) kingdoms, or periods, of which the last is the most well known and best documented. Assyrians invented [[sapping|excavation to undermine]] [[fortification|city walls]], [[battering ram]]s to knock down gates, as well as the concept of a corps of [[engineers]], who bridged rivers with pontoons or provided soldiers with inflatable skins for swimming.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bertman|first=Stephen|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|location=New York|publisher=Oxford UP|year=2005|pages=}}</ref>\n\n[[Mitanni]] was an Indo-Iranian<ref>\"Mitanni.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. 2008.

The Elamite period is considered a starting point for the [[history of Iran]].\nThe [[Medes]] were an [[Ancient Iranian peoples|ancient Iranian people]]. They had established their own empire by the 6th century BC, having defeated the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] with the [[Chaldea]]ns. They overthrew [[Urartu]] later on as well. The Medes are credited with the foundation of the first Iranian empire, the largest of its day until [[Cyrus the Great]] established a unified Iranian empire of the Medes and [[Persian people|Persian]], often referred to as the [[Achaemenid Empire]], by defeating his grandfather and overlord, [[Astyages]] the king of Media.[[File:Achaemenid Empire at its greatest extent according to Oxford Atlas of World History 2002.jpg|thumb|533x533px|The [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Achaemenid Empire]] at its greatest extent, c. 500 BC|alt=|center]]The [[Achaemenid Empire]] was the largest and most significant of the [[Persian Empire]]s, and followed the [[Median Empire]] as the second great empire of the Iranians. It is noted in western history as the foe of the [[Greek city states]] in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], for freeing the [[Israelites]] from their [[Babylonian captivity]], for its successful model of a centralized bureaucratic administration, the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]] (one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]), and for instituting [[Aramaic]] as the empire's [[official language]]. Because of the Empire's vast extent and long endurance, Persian influence upon the language, religion, architecture, philosophy, law and government of nations around the world lasts to this day. At the height of its power, the Achaemenid dynasty encompassed approximately 8.0&nbsp;million square kilometers, held the greatest percentage of world population to date, stretched three continents (Europe, Asia and Africa) and was territorially the largest empire of classical antiquity.\n[[File:Scythia-Parthia 100 BC.png|Geographical extent of Iranian influence in the 1st century BC.

Their power was based on a combination of the guerrilla warfare of a mounted nomadic tribe, with organizational skills to build and administer a vast empire \u2013 even though it never matched in power and extent the Persian empires that preceded and followed it. The [[Parthian Empire]] was led by the Arsacid dynasty, which reunited and ruled over significant portions of the [[Near East]] and beyond, after defeating and disposing the Hellenistic [[Seleucid Empire]], beginning in the late 3rd century BC. It was the third native dynasty of ancient Iran (after the [[Medes|Median]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] dynasties). Parthia had many wars with the [[Roman Republic]] (and subsequently the [[Roman Empire]]), which marked the start of what would be over 700 years of frequent [[Roman-Persian Wars]].\n\nThe [[Sassanid Empire]], lasting the length of the [[Late Antiquity]] period, is considered to be one of Iran's most important and influential historical periods. In many ways the Sassanid period witnessed the highest achievements of [[Persian culture|Persian civilization]] and constituted the last great Iranian Empire before the [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Muslim conquest]] and the adoption of Islam.<ref>Hourani, Albert (1991), A History of the Arab Peoples, London: Faber and Faber. {{ISBN|0-571-22664-7}}. p. 87.</ref> During Sassanid times, Persia influenced Roman civilization considerably,<ref>Bury, J.B.

These tablets, known collectively as the [[Anitta]] text,<ref>ed. [[StBoT]] 18</ref> begin by telling how [[Pithana]] the king of [[Kussara]] or Kussar (a small [[city-state]] yet to be identified by archaeologists) conquered the neighbouring city of [[Ne\u0161a]] ([[Kanesh]]). However, the real subject of these tablets is [[Pithana]]'s son [[Anitta]], who conquered several neighbouring cities, including [[Hattusa]] and [[Zalpuwa]] ([[Zalpa]]).\n\nAssyrian inscriptions of [[Shalmaneser I]] (c. 1270 BC) first mention ''[[Urartu|Uruartri]]'' as one of the states of [[Nairi (people)|Nairi]] \u2013 a loose confederation of small kingdoms and tribal states in the [[Armenian Highland]] from the 13th to 11th centuries BC. Uruartri itself was in the region around [[Lake Van]]. The Nairi states were repeatedly subjected to attacks by the Assyrians, especially under Tukulti-Ninurta I (c. 1240 BC), [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (c. 1100 BC), Ashur-bel-kala (c. 1070 BC), [[Adad-nirari II]] (c. 900), [[Tukulti-Ninurta II]] (c. 890), and [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883\u2013859 BC).\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] was an independent kingdom from 321 BC to 428 AD, and a client state of the Roman and Persian empires until 428. Between 95\u201355 BC under the rule of [[Tigranes the Great|King Tigranes the Great]], the kingdom of Armenia became a large and powerful empire stretching from the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]s.

Judah emerged somewhat later than Israel, probably during the 9th century BC, but the subject is one of considerable controversy.<ref>Grabbe 2008, pp. 225\u2013226</ref> Israel came into increasing conflict with the expanding [[neo-Assyrian empire]], which first split its territory into several smaller units and then destroyed its capital, Samaria (722). A series of campaigns by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] between 597 and 582 led to the destruction of Judah.\n\nFollowed by the fall of Babylon to the [[Persian empire]], Jews were allowed, by [[Cyrus the Great]], to [[Return to Zion|return to Judea]]. The [[Hasmonean Kingdom]] (followed by the [[Maccabean revolt]]) had existed during the Hellenistic period and then the [[Herodian kingdom]] during the Roman period.\n\n====Others====\n{{Main|Pre-Islamic Arabia|Ancient history of Yemen}}\n\nThe history of [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]] before the rise of [[Islam]] in the 630s is not known in great detail. Archaeological exploration in the [[Arabian peninsula]] has been sparse; indigenous written sources are limited to the many inscriptions and coins from southern Arabia. Existing material consists primarily of written sources from other traditions (such as [[Egypt]]ians, [[Greece|Greeks]], [[Persia]]ns, [[Roman Empire|Romans]], etc.) and [[oral tradition]]s later recorded by Islamic scholars. Many small kingdoms prospered from Red sea and [[Indian Ocean trade]]. Major kingdoms included the [[Sabaeans]], [[Kingdom of Awsan|Awsan]], [[Lakhmids|Lahkimid]] [[Himyarite Kingdom|Himyar]] and the [[Nabataeans|Nabateans]]. Arab kingdoms are occasionally mentioned in the Hebrew [[Old Testament]] under the name of [[Edom]].\nThough the [[Ugarit]]ic site is thought to have been inhabited earlier, [[Neolithic]] Ugarit was already important enough to be fortified with a wall early on. The first written evidence mentioning the city comes from the nearby city of [[Ebla]], c. 1800 BC. [[Ugarit]] passed into the sphere of influence of Egypt, which deeply influenced its art. On the Mediterranean coast of modern-day Israel, Palestine and Lebanon, Canaanite peoples became wealth through trade inspiring Phoenicians.\n\n[[Phoenicia]] was an ancient civilization centered in the north of ancient [[Canaan]], with its heartland along the coastal regions of modern-day [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Israel]]. Phoenician civilization was an enterprising [[thalassocracy|maritime trading culture]] that spread across the [[Mediterranean]] between the period of 1550 to 300 BC.

It was concentrated along the middle to lower reaches of the [[Nile River]] reaching its greatest extension during the 2nd millennium [[Before Christ|BC]], which is referred to as the [[New Kingdom]] period. It reached broadly from the [[Nile Delta]] in the north, as far south as [[Jebel Barkal]] at the [[Fourth Cataract]] of the Nile. Extensions to the geographical range of ancient Egyptian civilization included, at different times, areas of the southern [[Levant]], the Eastern Desert and the [[Red Sea]] coastline, the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the [[Libyan Desert|Western Desert]] (focused on the several [[oasis|oases]]).\n\nAncient Egypt developed over at least three and a half [[millennia]]. It began with the incipient unification of Nile Valley polities around 3500 BC and is conventionally thought to have ended in 30 BC when the early [[Roman Empire]] conquered and absorbed [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] as a province. (Though this last did not represent the first period of foreign domination, the Roman period was to witness a marked, if gradual transformation in the political and religious life of the Nile Valley, effectively marking the termination of independent civilisational development).\n\nThe civilization of ancient Egypt was based on a finely balanced control of natural and human resources, characterised primarily by controlled [[irrigation]] of the fertile Nile Valley; the mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions; the early development of an independent [[writing|writing system]] and [[literature]]; the organisation of collective projects; [[trade]] with surrounding regions in east / central Africa and the eastern [[Mediterranean]]; finally, [[military]] ventures that exhibited strong characteristics of imperial hegemony and territorial domination of neighbouring cultures at different periods. Motivating and organizing these activities were a socio-political and economic [[elite]] that achieved social consensus by means of an elaborate system of [[religion|religious belief]] under the figure of a (semi)-divine ruler (usually male) from a succession of ruling [[dynasty|dynasties]] and which related to the larger world by means of [[polytheism|polytheistic beliefs]].\n\n==== Nubia ====\n[[File:NubianPharoahs.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pharaoh]]s of Nubia]]\n\nThe [[Kushite]] civilization, which is also known as Nubia, was formed before a period of Egyptian incursion into the area. The first cultures arose in what is now [[Sudan]] before the time of a unified [[Egypt]], and the most widespread culture is known as the [[Kerma culture|Kerma civilization]]. Egyptians referred to Nubia as \"Ta-Seti,\" or \"The Land of the Bow,\" since the Nubians were known to be expert archers. The two civilization shared an abundance of peaceful cultural interchange and cooperation, including mixed marriages and even the same gods. In the New Kingdom, Nubians became indistinguishable in the archaeological record from Egyptians. The Kingdom of Kush survived longer than that of Egypt and at its greatest extent Nubia ruled over Egypt (under the leadership of king [[Piye]]), and controlled Egypt during the 8th century BC as the [[Kushite Empire|25th Dynasty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientsudan.org/history_06_nubconegypt.htm|title=Ancient Sudan~ Nubia: History: The Kushite Conquest of Egypt|work=ancientsudan.org}}</ref>\n\nIt is also referred to as [[Aethiopia|Ethiopia]] in ancient Greek and Roman records. According to Josephus and other classical writers, the Kushite Empire covered all of Africa, and some parts of Asia and Europe at one time or another. In contrast to the Egyptians the Nubians had an unusually high number of ruling queens also known as [[Kandake]], especially during the golden age of the Meroitic Kingdom. . Unlike the rest of the world at the time, women in Nubia exercised significant control in society.<ref>{{cite web |last= Kneller  |first=Tara L. |url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Role_Women.html |title=Role of Women in Nubia [Kneller] |website=africa.upenn.edu|access-date=2018-09-20}}</ref> The Kushites are also famous for having buried their monarchs along with all their courtiers in mass graves.

They cultivated six-row barley, einkorn and emmer wheat, jujubes and dates, and herded sheep, goats and cattle.

The largest of these nations were [[Magadha]], [[Kosala]], [[Kuru (India)|Kuru]] and [[Gandhara]]. Notably, the great epics of [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] are rooted in this classical period.\n\nAmongst the sixteen Mahajanapadas, the kingdom of [[Magadha]] rose to prominence under a number of dynasties that peaked in power under the reign of [[Ashoka]] [[Maurya]] one of India's most legendary and famous emperors. During the reign of [[Ashoka]], the four dynasties of [[Chola dynasty|Chola]], [[Chera dynasty|Chera]], and [[Pandya]] were ruling in the South, while the King [[Devanampiya Tissa]] was controlling the Anuradhapura Kingdom (now [[Sri Lanka]]). These kingdoms, while not part of Ashoka's empire, were in friendly terms with the [[Maurya Empire]]. There was a strong alliance existed between [[Devanampiya Tissa]] (250\u2013210 BC) and [[Ashoka]] of India,<ref>Mendis (1999), p. 11</ref> who sent [[Arahat]] [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahinda]], four monks, and a novice being sent to Sri Lanka.<ref>Wijesooriya (2006), p. 34</ref>\n\nThey encountered Devanampiya Tissa at [[Mihintale]]. After this meeting, Devanampiya Tissa embraced Buddhism the order of monks was established in the country.<ref>Wijesooriya (2006), p. 38</ref> Devanampiya Tissa, guided by Arahat Mahinda, took steps to firmly establish Buddhism in the country.\n\nThe period between AD 320\u2013550 is known as the Classical Age, when most of [[North India]] was reunited under the [[Gupta Empire]] (c. AD 320\u2013550). This was a period of relative peace, law and order, and extensive achievements in religion, education, mathematics, arts, Sanskrit literature and drama. Grammar, composition, logic, metaphysics, mathematics, medicine, and [[astronomy]] became increasingly specialized and reached an advanced level. The Gupta Empire was weakened and ultimately ruined by the raids of [[Huna people|Hunas]] (a branch of the [[Hephthalite]]s emanating from Central Asia). Under [[Harsha]] (r. 606\u201347), North India was reunited briefly.\n\nThe educated speech at that time was [[Sanskrit]], while the dialects of the general population of northern India were referred to as [[Prakrit]]s. The South Indian [[Malabar Coast]] and the [[Tamil people]] of the [[Sangam period|Sangam]] age traded with the [[Graeco-Roman]] world. They were in contact with the [[Phoenicians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Greeks]], [[Arabs]], [[Demographics of Syria|Syrians]], [[Jew]]s, and the [[China|Chinese]].<ref name=\"Blandstrom\">(Bjorn Landstrom, 1964; Miller, J.

Prior to the formation of civilization neolithic cultures such as the [[Longshan culture|Longshan]] and [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] dating to 5,000 BC lived in wall cities and likely had social organizations of complex chiefdoms. The practice of rice cultivation was vital to settled life in China.\n\nChinese history records such as the ''Records of the Grand Historian'' claim of the existence of the [[Xia dynasty|Xia Dynasty]]. However, as the Xia left behind no written record themselves, the time and location of their civilization has been in doubt. Some historians believe that the neolithic Erlitou culture (1900-1600 BC) is the [[Xia dynasty|Xia Dynasty]] but whether archaeological discoveries in the area Xia Dynasty or a different culture remains in doubt.\n<ref>{{Cite book|title=World History Cultures, States and Society to 1500|last=Berger|first=Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|last4=Parkinson|first4=Brian|last5=Reeves|first5=Andrew|last6=Williams|first6=Nadejda|publisher=University of North Georgia, Press|isbn=978-1-940771-10-6|location=Dahlonega, Georgia|page=127|date=2016-09-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=China: Five Thousand Years of History and Civilization|year=2007|publisher=City University of HK Press|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-fAxn_9f8wC&pg=PA25 |isbn=9789629371401}}</ref>\nThe early part of the [[Shang dynasty]] described in traditional histories (c. 1600\u20131300) is commonly identified with archaeological finds at [[Erligang culture|Erligang]], [[Zhengzhou]] and [[Yanshi]], south of the [[Yellow River]] in modern-day [[Henan]] province.\nThe last capital of the Shang (c. 1300\u20131046 BC) at [[Anyang]] (also in Henan) has been directly confirmed by the discovery there of the earliest Chinese texts, inscriptions of divination records on the bones or shells of animals&nbsp;\u2013 the so-called \"[[oracle bones]]\".\n\nTowards the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the Shang were overrun by the [[Zhou dynasty]] from the [[Wei River]] valley to the west. The death of [[King Wu of Zhou]] soon after the conquest triggered a succession crisis and civil war that was suppressed by Wu's brother, the [[Duke of Zhou]], acting as regent. The Zhou rulers at this time invoked the concept of the [[Mandate of Heaven]] to legitimize their rule, a concept that would be influential for almost every successive dynasty. The Zhou initially established their capital in the west near modern [[Xi'an]], near the Yellow River, but they would preside over a series of expansions into the [[Yangtze River]] valley. This would be the first of many population migrations from north to south in Chinese history.\n[[File:01 terracottawarriorsgroup.jpg|left|thumb|[[Terracotta Army|Terracotta Warriors]] from the time of [[Qin Shi Huang]]]]\nIn the 8th century BC, power became decentralized during the [[Spring and Autumn period]], named after the influential ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]''. In this period, local military leaders used by the Zhou began to assert their power and vie for hegemony. The situation was aggravated by the invasion of other peoples from the northwest, such as the [[Quanrong]], forcing the Zhou to move their capital east to [[Luoyang]]. This marks the second large phase of the Zhou dynasty: the Eastern Zhou. In each of the hundreds of states that eventually arose, local strongmen held most of the political power and continued their subservience to the Zhou kings in name only. Local leaders for instance started using royal titles for themselves. The [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] of Chinese philosophy blossomed during this period, and such influential intellectual movements as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] and [[Mohism]] were founded, partly in response to the changing political world. The Spring and Autumn period is marked by a falling apart of the central Zhou power. China now consisted of hundreds of states, some only as large as a village with a fort.\n\nAfter further political consolidation, seven prominent states remained by the end of the 5th century BC, and the years in which these few states battled each other is known as the [[Warring States period]]. Though there remained a nominal [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] king until 256 BC, he was largely a figurehead and held little power. As neighboring territories of these warring states, including areas of modern [[Sichuan]] and [[Liaoning]], were annexed, they were governed under the new local administrative system of [[Commandery (China)|commandery]] and [[prefecture]]. This system had been in use since the Spring and Autumn period and parts can still be seen in the modern system of [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|Sheng and Xian]] (province and county). The final expansion in this period began during the reign of Ying Zheng, the king of Qin. His unification of the other six powers, and further annexations in the modern regions of [[Zhejiang]], [[Fujian]], [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] in 214 BC enabled him to proclaim himself the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]] (Qin Shi Huangdi).[[File:Han foreign relations CE 2.jpg|alt=Han Dynasty Map. 1 AD |center|thumb|500x500px|The Chinese [[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]] dominated the East Asia region at the beginning of the first millennium AD ]]\n\nQin Shi Huangdi ruled the unified China directly with absolute power. In contrast to the decentralized and feudal rule of earlier dynasties the Qin set up a number of 'commandries' around the country which answered directly to the emperor. Nationwide the philosophy of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]] was enforced and publications promoting rival ideas such as Confucianism were prohibited. In his reign unified China created the first continuous [[Great Wall]] with the use of forced labor. [[Qin's campaign against the Yue tribes|Invasions]] were launched southward to annex Vietnam.  After the emperor's death rebels rose against the Qin's brutal reign in new civil wars. Ultimately the Han Dynasty arose and ruled China for over four centuries in what accounted for a long period in prosperity, with a brief interruption by the [[Xin dynasty|Xin Dynasty]].  The Han Dynasty played a great role in developing the Silk Road which would transfer wealth and ideas for millennia, and also invented paper. Though the Han enjoyed great military and economic success it was strained by the rise of aristocrats who disobeyed the central government. Public frustration provoked the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] \u2013 though a failure it nonetheless accelerated the empire's downfall. After 208 AD the Han Dynasty broke up into [[Three Kingdoms period|rival kingdoms]]. China would remain divided until 581 under the Sui Dynasty, during the era of division Buddhism would be introduced to China for the first time.\n\n====Neighbors of China====\n[[File:Gold monster.jpg|thumb|231x231px|Gold stag with eagle's head, and ten further heads in the antlers. From a [[Xiongnu]] tomb. 4th\u20133rd century BC]]\nThe East Asian nations adjacent to China were all profoundly influenced by their interactions with [[East Asian cultural sphere|Chinese civilization]]. Mongolia, Korea and Vietnam often were at war with, [[Imperial Chinese Tributary System|paid tribute]] to, or annexed by Imperial Chinese states. [[Yayoi period|Yayoi]] Japan, though not occupied, had interactions with Imperial China that shaped its cultural development.\n\nMongolia in ancient times was nomadic. The ethnicities, cultures and languages in modern Mongolian territory were fluid and changed frequently. The use of horses to herd and migrate started during the Iron Age. These were [[Tengriism|Tengriist]] horse-riding pastoral kingdoms that had close contact with the sedentary agrarian Chinese. To appease the aggressive nomads, local Chinese rulers often gave important hostages and arranged marriages. In 208 BC the Xiongnu emperor [[Modu Chanyu]], in his first major military campaign, defeated the [[Donghu people|Donghu]], who split into the new tribes [[Xianbei]] and [[Wuhuan]]. The [[Xiongnu]] were the largest nomadic enemies of the Han Dynasty fighting [[Han\u2013Xiongnu War|wars]] for over three centuries with the Han Dynasty before dissolving. Afterwards the Xianbei returned to rule the Steppe north of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]]. The titles of Khangan and Khan come from the [[Xianbei]].\n\nAccording to the [[Records of the Grand Historian]] by the Chinese historian [[Sima Qian]], [[Wiman Joseon]] of Korea was founded by General [[Wei Man|Wiman]] from China who originally served but usurped the throne of [[Gojoseon]] (the name of ancient Korea) in 194 BC.<ref>[[Records of the Grand Historian]] Vol.55 Korea \u53f2\u8a18 \u671d\u9bae\u5217\u4f1d\u7b2c\u4e94\u5341\u4e94 \"\u671d\u9bae\u738b\u6e80\u8005\u3001\u6545\u71d5\u4eba\u4e5f\"</ref> In 108 BC, the [[Han dynasty]] of China destroyed Wiman Joseon and established four commanderies on the northern Korean peninsula. Three of the commanderies were shortly lost but the [[Lelang commandery]] remained on the northwestern Korean peninsula for about 400 years. The [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] of [[Baekje]], [[Goguryeo]] and [[Silla]] emerged after the fall of Gojoseon and eventually expelled the Chinese. The Three Kingdoms competed with each other both economically and militarily; Goguryeo and Baekje were the main players for much of the Three Kingdoms era and controlled most of the Korean peninsula. At times more powerful than neighboring Chinese dynasties, Goguryeo (where the name \"Korea\" comes from) was a regional power that defeated [[Goguryeo-Sui Wars|massive invasions]] by the [[Sui dynasty]] multiple times.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/history.htm#The%20Ko%20Choson|title=Korea's History (Ko-Choson, Three Kingdoms, Parhae Kingdom, Unified Shilla, Koryo Dynasty, Colonial Period, Independence Struggle, Provisional Government of Korea, Independence Army, Republic of Korea,)|publisher=Asianinfo.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128065300/http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/history.htm|archivedate=28 January 2010|url-status=dead|accessdate=2010-01-09}}</ref> Goguryeo and Baekje were eventually destroyed by a [[Tang dynasty]] and Silla alliance.

Large scale rice cultivation began around 1200 BC, onward. Pottery and Bamboo working became common in this time period as well as widespread trade and navigation on inland rivers. During this time Vietnam was allegedly ruled by the semi-mythical [[Hong Bang Dynasty]], the last Hong King was deposed by a Chinese Qin Invasion, in turn however a Chinese General declared independence and founded the [[Nanyue]] combining Chinese and Vietnamese traditions.\n[[File:Bronze Mirror in Ancient Japan.jpg|alt=Ancient Japanese Bronze Mirror|left|thumb|175x175px|Bronze Mirror, from the [[Yayoi period]] of Japan]]\n[[Nanyue|Nan Yue]], after a century of political maneuvers the country was annexed by the [[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]] in 111 B.C Originally the Han were lenient governors and attempted to integrate the Vietnamese upper class into Chinese Patriarchy. However Chinese abuse of certain vassals led to the famous but futile revolt of the [[Tr\u01b0ng Sisters|Trung Sisters]]. Afterwards Chinese authorities ruled Vietnam directly and attempted to push Chinese culture upon the populace though peasants continued to speak [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. Vietnam would be under Chinese domination for a millennium.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/4.htm|title=Vietnam \u2013 The Chinese Millennium|website=countrystudies.us|access-date=2018-07-25}}</ref> Meanwhile, South Vietnam held a completely different identity, populated mainly by [[Chams|Cham]] People. While Northern Vietnam came under Chinese Domination, the [[Champa|Champa Kingdom]] became closer to Indian kingdoms through trade and embraced [[Hinduism in Vietnam|Hinduism]].\n\n[[History of Japan|Japan]] first appeared in written records in AD 57 with the following mention in China's ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'':<ref>\u5f8c\u6f22\u66f8, \u6703\u7a3d\u6d77\u5916\u6709\u6771\u9bf7\u4eba \u5206\u7232\u4e8c\u5341\u9918\u570b</ref> \"Across the ocean from [[Luoyang]] are the people of [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]].

In its twelve centuries of existence, Roman civilization shifted from a monarchy to an oligarchic republic to an increasingly autocratic empire.\n\nRoman civilization is often grouped into \"classical antiquity\" with [[ancient Greece]], a civilization that inspired much of the [[culture of ancient Rome]]. Ancient Rome contributed greatly to the development of [[Roman law|law]], [[Roman military|war]], [[Roman art|art]], [[Roman literature|literature]], [[Roman architecture|architecture]], and [[Romance languages|language]] in the [[Western world]], and its [[history of Rome|history]] continues to have a major influence on the world today. The Roman civilization came to dominate Europe and the Mediterranean region through conquest and assimilation.\n\nThroughout the territory under the control of ancient Rome, residential [[architecture]] ranged from very modest houses to [[Roman villa|country villas]]. A number of Roman founded cities had [[monument]]al structures. Many contained fountains with fresh drinking-water supplied by hundreds of miles of [[Aqueduct (Roman)|aqueducts]], [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatres]], [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasiums]], [[thermae|bath complexes]] sometime with libraries and shops, marketplaces, and occasionally functional sewers. A number of factors led to the eventual [[decline of the Roman Empire]]. The western half of the empire, including [[Hispania]], [[Gaul]], and Italy, eventually broke into independent kingdoms in the 5th century; the Eastern Roman Empire, governed from [[Constantinople]], is referred to as the [[Byzantine Empire]] after AD 476, the traditional date for the \"fall of Rome\" and subsequent onset of the [[post-classical age|Middle Ages]].\n\n====Late Antiquity====\n[[File:Invasions of the Roman Empire 1.png|center|thumb|400x400px|The [[Migration Period|Age of Migrations]] in Europe was deeply detrimental to the late [[Roman Empire]]. ]]\n{{Main|Late Antiquity}}\n\nThe [[Roman Empire]] underwent considerable social, cultural and organizational change starting with reign of [[Diocletian]], who began the custom of splitting the Empire into [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] and [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] halves ruled by multiple emperors.

The phrase may be used either to refer to the period of time or the academic discipline.\n\nThe span of [[recorded history]] is roughly 5,000 years, beginning with the [[Sumer]]ian [[cuneiform]] script, with the oldest coherent texts from about 2600 BC.<ref>See also ''The Origin and Development of the Cuneiform System of Writing'', [[Samuel Noah Kramer]], ''Thirty Nine Firsts In Recorded History'', pp. 381\u2013383</ref> Ancient history covers all continents inhabited by humans in the 3000 BC \u2013 AD 500 period.\n\nThe broad term \"ancient history\" is not to be confused with \"classical antiquity\". The term [[classical antiquity]] is often used to refer to [[Western world#Historical divisions|Western History]] in the [[History of the Mediterranean region|Ancient Mediterranean]] from the beginning of recorded Greek history in 776 BC (first [[Olympiad]]). This roughly coincides with the traditional date of the [[founding of Rome]] in 753 BC, the beginning of the history of [[ancient Rome]], and the beginning of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] in [[Ancient Greece]].\n\nThe academic term \"history\" is not to be confused with colloquial references to times past. History is fundamentally the study of the past, and can be either scientific ([[archaeology]]) or [[Humanistic historiography|humanistic]] (history through language).\n\nAlthough the ending date of ancient history is disputed, some [[Western culture|Western]] scholars use the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in 476 AD (the most used),<ref>Clare, I.S.

According to HYDE estimates from the Netherlands, world population increased exponentially in this period. In 10,000 BC in [[prehistory]], the world population had stood at 2 million, rising to 45 million by 3,000 BC.  By the rise of the [[Iron Age]] in 1,000 BC, the population had risen to 72 million. By the end of the period in 500 AD, the world population is thought to have stood at 209 million. In 3,500 years, the world population increased by 100 times.<ref name=\"mnp.nl\">[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0959683609356587 Data] from [http://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/themasites/hyde/index.html History Database of the Global Environment.]  K.

Although it is important to take into account the bias of each ancient author, their accounts are the basis for our understanding of the ancient past. Some of the more notable ancient writers include [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]], [[Arrian]], [[Plutarch]], [[Polybius]], [[Sima Qian]], [[Sallust]], [[Livy]], [[Josephus]], [[Suetonius]], and [[Tacitus]].\n\nA fundamental difficulty of studying ancient history is that [[recorded history|recorded histories]] cannot document the entirety of human events, and only a fraction of those documents have survived into the present day.<ref name=\"GardnerP\">Gardner, P. (1892). New chapters in Greek history, historical results of recent excavations in Greece and Asia Minor. New York: G.P.

(1997). The civilization of illiteracy. Dresden: Dresden University Press.</ref>\n\nThe earliest known systematic historical thought emerged in [[ancient Greece]], beginning with [[Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] (484\u2013c. 425 BC). [[Thucydides]] largely eliminated divine causality in his account of the war between Athens and Sparta,<ref name=\"Cochrane, Charles Norris 1929. p. 179\">Cochrane, Charles Norris. ''Thucydides and the Science of History'', Oxford University Press, 1929. p. 179.</ref> establishing a rationalistic element which set a precedent for subsequent Western historical writings. He was also the first to distinguish between cause and immediate origins of an event.<ref name=\"Cochrane, Charles Norris 1929. p. 179\" />\n\nThe [[Roman Empire]] was an ancient culture with a relatively high literacy rate,<ref>Harris, W.V. (1989). Ancient literacy. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. p. 175.</ref> but many works by its most widely read historians are lost. For example, [[Livy]], a Roman historian who lived in the 1st century BC, wrote a history of Rome called ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' (''From the Founding of the City'') in 144 volumes; only 35 volumes still exist, although short summaries of most of the rest do exist. Indeed, no more than a minority of the work of any major Roman historian has survived.\n\n===Timeline of ancient history===\n{{Main|Timeline of ancient history}}\n{{Ancient chronology}}\nThis gives a listed timeline, ranging from 3200 BC to 400 AD, that provides an overview of ancient history.\n\n==Chronology==\n\n===Prehistory===\n{{Main|Prehistory|Neolithic Revolution}}\n\nPrehistory is the period before [[Recorded history|written history]]. The [[early human migration]]s<ref>H. Liu, F. Prugnolle, A. Manica, [[Francois Balloux|F. Balloux]], ''A Geographically Explicit Genetic Model of Worldwide Human-Settlement History.'' The American Journal of Human Genetics, Volume 79, Issue 2, pp. 230\u2013237</ref> in the [[Lower Paleolithic]] saw [[Homo erectus]] spread across Eurasia 1.8 million years ago. The controlled use of fire first occurred 800,000 years ago in the [[Middle Paleolithic]]. 250,000 years ago, [[Homo sapiens]] (modern humans) [[Human evolution|emerged]] in [[Africa]]. 60\u201370,000 years ago, Homo sapiens migrated out of Africa along a coastal route to [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] and reached [[Australia]]. 50,000 years ago, modern humans spread from [[Asia]] to the [[Near East]]. [[Europe]] was first reached by modern humans 40,000 years ago. Humans [[migration to the New World|migrated to the Americas]] about 15,000 years ago in the [[Upper Paleolithic]].\n\nThe 10th millennium BC is the earliest given date for the [[Neolithic revolution|invention of agriculture]] and the beginning of the ancient era. [[G\u00f6bekli Tepe]] was erected by [[hunter-gatherer]]s in the [[10th millennium BC]] (c. 11,500 years ago), before the advent of [[sedentism]]. Together with [[Nevali Cori|Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori]], it has revolutionized understanding of the Eurasian [[Neolithic]]. In the 7th millennium BC, [[Jiahu]] culture began in [[China]]. By the 5th millennium BC, the late Neolithic civilizations saw the invention of the [[wheel]] and the spread of [[proto-writing]]. In the 4th millennium BC, the [[Cucuteni culture|Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]] in the [[Ukraine]]-[[Moldova]]-[[Romania]] region develops. By 3400 BC, \"proto-literate\" [[cuneiform]] is spread in the Middle East.<ref>{{Harvnb|Diamond|1999|p=218}}</ref> The 30th century BC, referred to as the [[Early Bronze Age II]], saw the beginning of the literate period in [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt]]. Around the 27th century BC, the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]] and the First Dynasty of [[Uruk]] are founded, according to the earliest reliable [[regnal era]]s.\n\n====Middle to Late Bronze Age====\n{{Main|Bronze Age|Cradle of civilization}}\n{| class=\"mw-collapsible toccolours\" style=\"margin: 1em auto;\"\n! style=\"background:#f8eaba;\" | Original Civilizations\n|-\n|<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100\">\nFile:Ancient cities of Sumer, Akad and Elam.jpg|[[Mesopotamia]] \u2013 [[Sumer]]\nFile:Indus Valley Civilization, Mature Phase (2600-1900 BCE).png|[[History of India|India]] \u2013 [[Indus Valley Civilization]]\nFile:ErlitouXia.PNG|[[History of China|China]] \u2013 [[Erlitou culture|Erlitou]]\nFile:Peru site locations.png|[[Andean civilizations|Andean]] \u2013 [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]]\nFile:Olmec Heartland Overview 4.svg|[[Mesoamerica|Measoamerica]] \u2013 [[Olmecs|Olmec]]\n</gallery>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nVAM - F\u00fcrbitterin.jpg|Figurine \u2013 [[Sumer]]\nUnicorn.

It follows the [[Neolithic Age]] in some areas of the world. In most areas of civilization bronze smelting became a foundation for more advanced societies. There was some contrast with New World societies, who often still preferred stone to metal for utilitarian purposes. Modern historians have identified five original civilizations which emerged in the time period.<ref name=\"Haviland 2013\">{{cite book |last1=Haviland |first1=William |displayauthors=etal |title=Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2013 |page=250 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DfEWAAAAQBAJ&q=%22civilization+refers+to+societies%22|isbn=978-1285675305 }}</ref><ref>''Understanding Early Civilizations: A Comparative Study'', Trigger, Bruce G., Cambridge University Press, 2007</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n* [[Sumer]] in the [[Fertile Crescent]]\n* [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]] in the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]]\n* [[Erlitou culture|Erlitou]] in the [[North China Plain]]\n* [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]] in the [[Andes]]\n* [[Olmecs|Olmec]] in [[Mesoamerica]]\n\nThe first civilization emerged in Sumer in the southern region of [[Mesopotamia]], now part of modern-day Iraq. By 3000 BC, Sumerian city states had collectively formed [[civilization]], with government, religion, division of labor and writing. Among the city states [[Ur]] was among the most significant.\n\nIn the 24th century BC, the [[Akkadian Empire]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/nt/Gilgamesh/akkadian.html|title=Akkadian Empire|work=angelfire.com}}</ref><ref>Wells, H.G.

From Sumer, civilization and bronze smelting spread westward to Egypt, the [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]] and the [[Hittites]].\n\nThe [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]] of the 22nd century BC was followed by the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] between the 21st to 17th centuries BC. The [[Sumerian Renaissance]] also developed c. the 21st century BC in [[Ur]]. Around the 18th century BC, the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt]] began. Egypt was a superpower at the time. By 1600 BC, [[Mycenaean Greece]] developed and invaded the remains of [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Civilization]]. The beginning of [[Hittites|Hittite]] dominance of the Eastern [[Mediterranean]] region is also seen in the 1600s BC. The time from the 16th to the 11th centuries BC around the Nile is called the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]]. Between 1550 BC and 1292 BC, the [[Amarna Period]] developed in Egypt.\n\nEast of Iranian world, was the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus River Valley civilization]] which organized cities neatly on grid patterns.<ref>{{Cite book|title=World History Cultures, States and Society to 1500|last=Berger|first=Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|last4=Parkinson|first4=Brian|last5=Reeves|first5=Andrew|last6=Williams|first6=Nadejda|publisher=University of North Georgia, Press|isbn=978-1-940771-10-6|location=Dahlonega, Georgia|page=79|date=2016-09-30}}</ref>\nHowever the Indus River Valley civilization diminished after 1900 BC and was later replaced with [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Ayran peoples]] who established [[Vedic period|Vedic Culture]].\n\nThe beginning of the [[Shang dynasty]] emerged in China in this period, and there was evidence of a fully developed [[Chinese writing system]]. The Shang Dynasty is the first Chinese regime recognized by western scholars though Chinese historians insist that the [[Xia dynasty|Xia Dynasty]] preceded it. The Shang Dynasty practiced forced labor to complete public projects. There is evidence of massive ritual burial.\n\nAcross the ocean, the earliest known civilization of the Americas appeared in the river valleys of the dessertic coast of central modern day Peru. The Norte Chico civilization's first city flourished around 3100 BC.  The Olmecs are supposed to appear later in [[Mesoamerica]] between the 14th and 13th century.\n\n====Early Iron Age====\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2018}}{{Main|Iron Age}}\n\nThe [[Iron Age]] is the last principal period in the three-age system, preceded by the Bronze Age. Its date and context vary depending on the country or geographical region. The Iron Age over all was characterized by the prevalent smelting of iron with [[Ferrous metallurgy]] and the use of [[Carbon steel]]. Smelted iron proved more durable than earlier metals such as [[Copper]] or [[Bronze]] and allowed for more productive societies. The Iron Age took place at different times in different parts of the world, and comes to an end when a society began to maintain historical records.[[File:Bronze Age End.svg|thumb|500x500px|Map of the [[late Bronze Age collapse]], c. 1200 BC|alt=|center]]During the 13th to 12th centuries BC, the [[Ramesside Period]] occurred in Egypt.

Simon & Schuster {{ISBN|0-7432-6441-X}}</ref> By around 1180&nbsp;BC, the disintegration of the [[Hittite Empire]] was under way. The collapse of the Hitties was part of the larger scale Bronze Age Collapse which took place in the Ancient Near East around 1200&nbsp;BC. In Greece the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenae]] and [[Minoan civilization|Minona]] both disintegrated. A wave of [[Sea Peoples]] attacked many countries, only [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] survived intact. Afterwards some entirely new successor civilizations arose in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nIn 1046 BC, the Zhou force, led by [[King Wu of Zhou]], overthrew the last king of the Shang dynasty. The [[Zhou dynasty]] was established in China shortly thereafter. During this Zhou era China embraced a feudal society of decentralized power. Iron Age China then dissolved into the [[Warring States period|warring states]] period where possibly millions of soldiers fought each other over feudal struggles.\n\n[[Pirak]] is an early iron-age site in [[Balochistan]], [[Pakistan]], going back to about 1200&nbsp;BC.

The [[Axial Age]] is used to describe history between 800 and 200 BC of Eurasia, including [[Ancient Greece]], [[History of Iran|Iran]], [[Middle kingdoms of India|India]] and [[History of China|China]]. Widespread trade and communication between distinct regions in this period, including the rise of the [[Silk Road]]. This period saw the rise of [[philosophy]] and proselytizing religions.\n\nPhilosophy, religion and science were diverse in the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] producing thinkers such as [[Confucius]], [[Laozi|Lao Tzu]] and [[Mozi]] during the sixth century BC. Similar trends emerged throughout Eurasia in India with the rise of [[Early Buddhism|Buddhism]], in the Near East with [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Judaism]] and in the west with [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek Philosophy]]. In these developments religious and philosophical figures were all searching for human meaning.<ref name = \"Neville\">{{cite book | last = Neville | first = Robert Cummings | title=Religion in Late Modernity | url= https://books.google.com/?id=OWkrdZ2yh3EC&pg=PA104&vq=%22Axial+Age | year = 2002 | publisher = SUNY Press | isbn =978-0-7914-5424-4 | page = 104}}</ref>\n\nThe Axial Age and its aftermath saw large wars and the formation of large empires that stretched beyond the limits of earlier Iron Age Societies. Significant for the time was the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Achaemenid Empire]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peter|first=Turchin|date=14 April 2012|title=Religion and Empire in the Axial Age|url=http://peterturchin.com/PDF/Bellah_RBB.pdf|journal=Religion, Brain & Behavior|volume=|page=3|via=}}</ref> The empire's vast territory extended from modern day [[Egypt]] to [[Xinjiang]]. The empire's legacy include the rise of commerce over land routes through Eurasia as well as the spreading of Persian culture through the middle east. The [[Royal Road]] allowed for efficient trade and taxation.  Though Macedonian [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in its entirety, the unity of Alexander's conquests did not survive past his lifetime. Greek culture, and technology spread through West and South Asia often synthesizing with local cultures.\n\n'''Formation of Empires and Fragmentation'''\n\nSeparate [[Diadochi|Greek Kingdoms]] Egypt and Asia encouraged trade and communication like earlier Persian administrations.<ref>\"Mastering World History\" by Philip L. Groisser, New York, 1970, p.17</ref> Combined with the expansion of the [[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]] westward the [[Silk Road]] as a series of routes made possible the exchange of goods between the Mediterranean Basin, South Asia and East Asia.  In South Asia, the Mauryan empire briefly annexed much of the Indian Subcontinent though short lived, its reign had the legacies of spreading Buddhism and providing an inspiration to later Indian states.\n\nSupplanting the warring Greek Kingdoms in the western world came the growing [[Roman Republic]] and the Iranian [[Parthian Empire]].  As a result of empires, urbanization and literary spread to locations which had previously been at the periphery of civilization as known by the large empires. Upon the turn of the millennium the independence of tribal peoples and  smaller kingdoms were threatened by more advanced states. Empires were not just remarkable for their territorial size but for their administration and the dissemination of culture and trade, in this way the influence of empires often extended far beyond their national boundaries. Trade routes expanded by land and sea and allowed for flow of goods between distant regions even in the absence of communication. Distant nations such as Imperial Rome and the Chinese Han Dynasty [[Sino-Roman relations|rarely communicated]] but trade of goods did occur as evidenced by  archaeological discoveries such as Roman coins in Vietnam. At this time most of the world's population inhabited only a small part of the earth's surface. Outside of civilization large geographic areas such as [[Siberia]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub Saharan Africa]] and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] remained sparsely populated. The [[New World]] hosted a variety of separate civilizations in the but its own trade networks were smaller due to the lack of draft animals and the wheel.\n\nEmpires with their immense military strength remained fragile to civil wars, economic decline and a changing political environment internationally. In 220 AD Han China collapsed into [[Three Kingdoms|warring states]] while the European Roman Empire began to suffer from turmoil in the [[Crisis of the Third Century|Third Century Crisis]]. In Persia regime change took place from [[Parthia|Parthian Empire]] to the more centralized [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian Empire]]. The land based Silk Road continued to deliver profits in trade but came under continual assault by nomads all on the northern frontiers of Eurasian nations. Safer sea routes began to gain preference in the early centuries AD\n\nProselytizing religions began to replace [[polytheism]] and [[folk religion]]s in many areas. [[History of Christianity|Christianity]] gained a wide following in the Roman Empire, [[Zoroastrianism]] became the state enforced religion of Iran and [[History of Buddhism|Buddhism]] spread to East Asia from South Asia. Social change, political transformation as well as ecological events all contributed to the end of Ancient Times and the beginning of the Post Classical era in Eurasia roughly around the year 500.\n\n==Developments==\n\n===Religion and philosophy===\n{{Main|Axial age|History of philosophy|Development of religion|History of religion}}\n{{Further|Axial Age|Religions of the Ancient Near East|Ancient Egyptian religion|Historical Vedic religion|Ancient Greek religion|Hellenistic philosophy|Roman imperial cult|Early Christianity|Decline of Greco-Roman polytheism}}\n[[File:Museo Barracco - Giove Ammone 1010637.JPG|alt=Jupiter Ammon|thumb|Roman cast [[terracotta]] of ram-horned ''Jupiter Ammon'', a form of [[Zeus]] 1st century AD. Gods, could sometimes be transferred or adopted by many civilizations, and then adjusted for local conditions.]]\nThe rise of civilization corresponded with the institutional sponsorship of belief in gods, supernatural forces and the afterlife. During the [[Bronze Age]], many civilizations adopted their own form of [[Polytheism]]. Usually, polytheistic Gods manifested human personalities, strengths and failings.  Early religion was often based on location, with cities or entire countries selecting a deity, that would grant them preferences and advantages over their competitors. Worship involved the construction of representation of deities, and the granting of sacrifices. Sacrifices could be material goods, food, or in extreme cases human sacrifice to please a deity.   New [[philosophy|philosophies]] and [[religions]] arose in both east and west, particularly about the 6th century BC. Over time, a great variety of religions developed around the world, with some of the earliest major ones being [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]] in [[India]], and [[Zoroastrianism]] in [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]]. The [[Abrahamic religion]]s trace their origin to [[Judaism]], around 1800 BC.\n\nThe ancient [[Indian philosophy]] is a fusion of two ancient traditions: [[Sramana]] tradition and [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic tradition]]. Indian philosophy begins with the ''[[Vedas]]'' where questions related to laws of nature, the origin of the universe and the place of man in it are asked. Jainism and Buddhism are continuation of the Sramana school of thought. The Sramanas cultivated a pessimistic world view of the samsara as full of suffering and advocated renunciation and austerities. They laid stress on philosophical concepts like [[Ahimsa]], [[Karma]], [[Jnana]], [[Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra|Samsara]] and [[Moksha|Moksa]]. While there are ancient relations between the Indian [[Vedas]] and the Iranian [[Avesta]], the two main families of the [[Iranian philosophy|Indo-Iranian philosophical traditions]] were characterized by fundamental differences in their implications for the human being's position in society and their view on the role of man in the universe.\n\nIn the east, three schools of thought were to dominate [[China|Chinese]] thinking until the modern day. These were [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] and [[Confucianism]]. The Confucian tradition, which would attain dominance, looked for [[political]] [[morality]] not to the force of law but to the power and example of tradition. Confucianism would later spread into the [[Korean peninsula]] and [[Goguryeo]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skkok.com/?_page=43 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081713/http://www.skkok.com/?_page=43 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-07-16 |title= \uc790\ub791\uc2a4\ub7f0 \uc131\uade0\uad00 \uaf43\ud53c\uc6b0\ub294 \uc720\uad50\ubb38\ud654 \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \uc778\uc131\uad50\uc721 \uc131\uade0\uad00 \uc608\uc808\uad50\uc2e4  |publisher=Skkok.com |accessdate=2010-01-09}}</ref> and toward [[Japan]].\n\nIn the west, the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophical tradition, represented by [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]], was diffused throughout [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] in the 4th century BC by the conquests of [[Alexander III of Macedon]], more commonly known as [[Alexander the Great]]. After the [[Bronze and Iron Age religion]]s formed, the rise and spread of [[Christianity]] through the Roman world marked the end of [[Hellenistic]] philosophy and ushered in the beginnings of [[Medieval philosophy]].\n\n===Science and technology===\n{{Main|Ancient technology}}\n{{Further|History of science in early cultures|History of mathematics}}\n{{Ancient technology}}\n[[File:Pont Du Gard.jpg|thumb|The [[Pont du Gard]], a Roman aqueduct in France.]]\n\nIn the [[history of technology]] and [[ancient science]] during the growth of the ancient civilizations, [[ancient technology|ancient technological]] advances were produced in [[engineering]]. These advances stimulated other societies to adopt new ways of living and governance. Sometimes, technological development was sponsored by the state.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe characteristics of [[Ancient Egyptian technology]] are indicated by a set of artifacts and customs that lasted for thousands of years. The Egyptians invented and used many basic machines, such as the ramp and the lever, to aid construction processes. The Egyptians also played an important role in developing Mediterranean maritime technology including ships and lighthouses.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nWater managing [[Qanat]]s which likely emerged on the [[Iran]]ian plateau and possibly also in the [[Arabian peninsula]] sometime in the early 1st millennium BC spread from there slowly west- and eastward.<ref>[[Andrew Wilson (classical archaeologist)|Andrew Wilson]]: \"Hydraulic Engineering and Water Supply\", in: [[John Peter Oleson]]: ''Handbook of Engineering and Technology in the Classical World'', New York: Oxford University Press, 2008 (editor), {{ISBN|978-0-19-973485-6}}, pp. 291f.</ref>\n\nThe [[history of Science and Technology in India|history of science and technology in India]] dates back to ancient times. The Indus Valley civilization yields evidence of [[hydrography]],  and sewage collection and disposal being practiced by its inhabitants. Among the fields of science and technology pursued in India were [[History of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent|metallurgy]], [[Indian astronomy|astronomy]], [[Indian mathematics|mathematics]] and [[Ayurveda]]. Some ancient [[List of Indian inventions|inventions]] include [[plastic surgery]], [[cataract surgery]], [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]] and [[Wootz steel]].\nThe [[history of science and technology in China]] show significant advances in science, technology, mathematics, and astronomy. The first recorded observations of comets and [[SN 185|supernovae]] were made in China. Traditional [[Chinese medicine]], [[acupuncture]] and herbal medicine were also practiced.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n[[Ancient Greek technology]] developed at an unprecedented speed during the 5th century BC, continuing up to and including the Roman period, and beyond. Inventions that are credited to the ancient Greeks such as the gear, screw, bronze casting techniques, water clock, water organ, torsion catapult and the use of steam to operate some experimental machines and toys. Many of these inventions occurred late in the Greek period, often inspired by the need to improve weapons and tactics in war. [[Roman technology]] is the engineering practice which supported Roman civilization and made the expansion of Roman commerce and Roman military possible over nearly a thousand years. The Roman Empire had the most advanced set of technology of their time, some of which may have been lost during the turbulent eras of Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. Roman technological feats of many different areas, like civil engineering, construction materials, transport technology, and some inventions such as the mechanical reaper went unmatched until the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Maritime activity===\n{{Main|Ancient maritime history}}\n\nThe history of ancient navigation began in earnest when men took to the sea in [[Plank (wood)|planked]] boats and ships propelled by [[sail]]s hung on [[Mast (sailing)|masts]], like the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Khufu ship]] from the mid-3rd millennium BC. According to the [[Greece|Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]], [[Necho II]] sent out an expedition of [[Phoenicians]], which in three years sailed from the [[Red Sea]] around [[Africa]] to the mouth of the [[Nile]]. Many current historians tend to believe Herodotus on this point, even though Herodotus himself was in disbelief that the Phoenicians had accomplished the act.\n\n[[Hannu]] was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[exploration|explorer]] (around 2750 BC) and the first explorer of whom there is any knowledge. He made the first recorded exploring expedition, writing his account of his exploration in stone. Hannu travelled along the Red Sea to [[Punt (region)|Punt]], and sailed to what is now part of eastern [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]]. He returned to Egypt with great treasures, including precious [[myrrh]], [[metals|metal]] and [[wood]].\n\n===Warfare===\n[[File:Ballista (PSF) vector.svg|left|thumb|Technical drawing of Roman [[Ballista]] mechanism. ]]\n{{Main|Ancient warfare}}\n\n[[Ancient warfare]] is war as conducted from the beginnings of recorded history to the end of the ancient period. In Europe, the end of antiquity is often equated with the fall of Rome in 476. In China, it can also be seen as ending in the 5th century, with the growing role of mounted warriors needed to counter the ever-growing threat from the north.\n\nThe difference between [[prehistoric warfare]] and ancient warfare is less one of technology than of organization. The development of the first [[city-state]]s, and then [[empire]]s, allowed warfare to change dramatically. Beginning in [[Mesopotamia]], states produced sufficient agricultural surplus that full-time ruling elites and military commanders could emerge. While the bulk of military forces were still farmers, the society could support having them campaigning rather than working the land for a portion of each year. Thus, organized armies developed for the first time.\n\nThese new armies could help states grow in size and became increasingly centralized, and the first empire, that of the [[Sumer]]ians, formed in Mesopotamia. Early ancient armies continued to primarily use [[bow and arrow|bows]] and [[spear]]s, the same weapons that had been developed in prehistoric times for hunting. Early armies in [[Egypt]] and [[China]] followed a similar pattern of using massed infantry armed with bows and spears.\n\n===Artwork and music===\n{{Ancient art history}}\n\n{{Main|Ancient art history|Ancient music|Ancient art}}\n\n[[Ancient music]] is music that developed in literate cultures, replacing prehistoric music. Ancient music refers to the various musical systems that were developed across various geographical regions such as Persia, India, China, Greece, Rome, Egypt and Mesopotamia (see [[music of Mesopotamia]], [[music of ancient Greece]], [[music of ancient Rome]], [[music of Iran]]). Ancient music is designated by the characterization of the basic audible tones and scales. It may have been transmitted through oral or written systems. [[Ancient art|Arts of the ancient world]] refers to the many types of art that were in the cultures of ancient societies, such as those of ancient China, Egypt, Greece, India, Persia, Mesopotamia and Rome.\n\n==Timelines==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Comparative timeline===\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:835 height:500\nPlotArea = left:100 right:20 top:20 bottom:20\nAlignBars = justify\n\nColors =\n    id:time value:rgb(0.7,0.7,1) #\n    id:period value:rgb(1,0.7,0.5) #\n    id:age value:rgb(0.95,0.85,0.5) #\n    id:era value:rgb(1,0.85,0.5) #\n    id:eon value:rgb(1,0.85,0.7) #\n    id:filler value:gray(0.8) # background bar\n    id:black value:black\n\nPeriod     = from:-3000 till:1000\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:500 start:-3000\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:100 start:-3000\n\nBarData =\n  bar:ages text:\"Historical Ages........\"\n  bar:Time text:Age\n\n  bar:blank\n  bar:sw_asia text:\"South-west Asia......\"\n  bar:Mes.  text:Mes.\n  bar:Elam  text:Elam\n  bar:Ach.  text:Ach.\n\n  bar:blank\n  bar:africa text:\"Africa......................\"\n  bar:Egypt text:Egypt\n  bar:Kush  text:Kush\n  bar:Aksumite text:Aksumite\n  bar:Carthage text:Carthage\n\n  bar:blank\n  bar:s_asia text:\"South Asia..............\"\n  bar:Indus.Valley\n\n  bar:blank\n  bar:e_asia text:\"East Asia.................\"\n  bar:China\n\n  bar:blank\n  bar:americas text:\"Americas.................\"\n  bar:N.Americas text:N.Americas\n  bar:C.Americas text:C.Americas\n  bar:S.Americas text:S.Americas\n\n  bar:blank\n  bar:eur text:\"Europe.....................\"\n  bar:Europe\n\nPlotData =\n  align:center textcolor:black fontsize:8 mark:(line,black) width:15 shift:(0,-5)\n\n  bar:ages color:skyblue from: start till: end text:\"Historical ages\"\n  bar:Time color:period\n  from: -3000 till: -1200 text:[[Bronze Age]]\n  from: -1200 till: 400 text:[[Iron Age]]\n  from: 400 till: 1000 text:[[postclassical age|Middle Ages]]\n\n  bar:blank at:-3000\n  bar:sw_asia color:skyblue from: start till: end text:\"Southwest Asia (Near East)\"\n  bar:Mes. color:era\n  from: -3000 till: -750 text:[[Mesopotamia]]\n  bar:Elam color:era\n  from: -3000 till: -2700 shift:(8,0) text:Proto-Elamite\n  from: -2700 till: -1500 text:Old Elamite\n  from: -1500 till: -1100 text:Middle Elamite\n  from: -1100 till: -539 text:Neo-Elamite\n  bar:Ach. color:era\n  from: -550 till: -330 text:[[Achaemenid Empire]]\n\n  bar:blank at:-3000\n  bar:africa color:skyblue from: start till: end text:\"Africa\"\n  bar:Egypt  color:age\n  from: -3000 till: -30 text:[[Ancient Egypt]]\n\n  bar:Kush color: era\n  from: -3000 till: -1650 text: Kerma\n  from: -1650 till: -1070 text: Ancient Egypt\n  from: -1070 till: -591 text: Napata\n  from: -591 till: 350 text: Meroe\n\n  bar:Aksumite color:age\n  from: -400 till: 940 text:[[Aksumite Empire]]\n  bar:Carthage color:eon\n  from: -650 till: 146 text:[[Ancient Carthage]]\n\n  bar:blank at:-3000\n  bar:s_asia color:skyblue from: start till: end text:\"South Asia\"\n  bar:Indus.Valley color:era\n  from: -3000 till: -1200 text:[[Indus Valley Civilization]]\n  from: -1200 till: -180 text:[[Iron Age India]]\n  from: -180 till: 1 text:[[Indo-Greeks]]\n  from: 1 till: 1000 text:[[Middle kingdoms of India]]\n\n  bar:blank at:-3000\n  bar:e_asia color:skyblue from: start till: end text:\"East Asia\"\n  bar:China color:era\n  from: -3000 till: -2000 text:[[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors]]\n  from: -2000 till: -200 text:[[Ancient China]]\n  from: -200 till: 1000 text:[[Imperial China]]\n\n  bar:blank at:-3000\n  bar:americas color:skyblue from: start till: end text:\"Americas\"\n  bar:N.Americas color:age\n  from: -3000 till: -1500 text:Archaic\n  from: -1500 till: 650 text:Classic\n  from:  650 till: 1000 text:Pre-Columbian\n  bar:C.Americas color:era\n  from: -3000 till: -1500 text:Archaic\n  from: -1500 till: 250 text:Formative\n  from:  250 till: 900 text:Classic\n  from:  900 till: 1000 text:Postclassic\n  bar:S.Americas color:age\n  from: -3000 till: -1900 text:Archaic\n  from: -1900 till: 200 text:Preclassic\n  from: 200 till: 1000 text:Classic\n\n  bar:blank at:-3000\n  bar:eur color:skyblue from: start till: end text:\"Europe\"\n  bar:Europe color:era\n  from: -3000 till: -1200 text:Archaic\n  from: -1200 till: -650 text:[[Phoenicia]]\n  from: -650 till: -146 text:[[Ancient Greece]]\n  from: -146 till: 1000 text:[[Ancient Rome]]\n\n# add here\n</timeline>\n\n===Comparison table===\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"font-size:90%; border=; margin:auto;\" 1\"\n|- style=\"background:#f8eaba; fontsize:105%; textalign:center;\"\n!

It was the first to practice intensive year-round [[agriculture]]; created the first [[history of writing|coherent writing system]], invented the [[potter's wheel]] and then the vehicular- and mill [[wheel]], created the first [[centralized government]]s, [[law code]]s and [[empire]]s, as well as introducing [[social stratification]], [[slavery]] and organized [[warfare]], and it laid the foundation for the fields of [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]].\n\n[[File:Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia c. 1450 BC.png|thumb|Overview map in the 15th century BC showing the core territory of [[Assyria]] with its two major cities [[Assur]] and [[Nineveh]] wedged between [[Babylonia]] downstream and the states of [[Mitanni]] and [[Hittite Empire|Hatti]] upstream.|alt=|center|368x368px]]\n\n====Mesopotamia====\n{{further|Mesopotamia|History of Iraq}}\n\n[[Mesopotamia]] is the site of some of the earliest known [[civilization]]s in the world. Early settlement of the alluvial plain lasted from the [[Ubaid period]] (late 6th millennium BC) through the [[Uruk period]] (4th millennium BC) and the Dynastic periods (3rd millennium BC) until the rise of [[Babylon]] in the early 2nd millennium BC. The surplus of storable foodstuffs created by this economy allowed the population to settle in one place instead of migrating after crops and herds. It also allowed for a much greater population density, and in turn required an extensive labor force and [[division of labor]]. This organization led to the necessity of record keeping and the development of [[history of writing|writing]] (c. 3500 BC).\n\n[[Babylonia]] was an [[Amorite]] state in lower [[Mesopotamia]] (modern southern [[Iraq]]), with Babylon as its capital. Babylonia emerged when [[Hammurabi]] (fl. c. 1728\u20131686 BC, according to the [[short chronology]]) created an empire out of the territories of the former kingdoms of [[Sumer]] and [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]. The Amorites being [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]], Babylonia adopted the written [[Akkadian language]] for official use; they retained the [[Sumerian language]] for religious use, which by that time was no longer a spoken language. The Akkadian and Sumerian cultures played a major role in later Babylonian culture, and the region would remain an important cultural center, even under outside rule. The earliest mention of the city of [[Babylon]] can be found in a tablet from the reign of [[Sargon of Akkad]], dating back to the 23rd century BC.\n\nThe [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], or [[Chaldea]], was Babylonia under the rule of the 11th (\"Chaldean\") dynasty, from the revolt of [[Nabopolassar]] in 626 BC until the invasion of [[Cyrus the Great]] in 539 BC. Notably, it included the reign of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], who conquered the [[Kingdom of Judah]] and [[Jerusalem]].\n\nAkkad was a city and its surrounding region in central Mesopotamia. Akkad also became the capital of the [[Akkadian Empire]].<ref name=\"WebsterNinthNewCollege\">Mish, Frederick C., Editor in Chief. \"Akkad.\" ''[[Webster's Dictionary#The Collegiate Dictionary|Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary]]''. 9th ed.

Despite an extensive search, the precise site has never been found. Akkad reached the height of its power between the 24th and 22nd centuries BC, following the conquests of king Sargon of Akkad. Because of the policies of the Akkadian Empire toward linguistic assimilation, Akkad also gave its name to the predominant Semitic dialect: the Akkadian language, reflecting use of ''akkad\u00fb'' (\"in the language of Akkad\") in the Old Babylonian period to denote the Semitic version of a Sumerian text.\n\n[[Assyria]] was originally (in the [[Middle Bronze Age]]) a region on the Upper [[Tigris]], named for its original capital, the ancient city of [[Assur]]. Later, as a nation and empire that came to control all of the [[Fertile Crescent]], [[Egypt]] and much of [[Anatolia]], the term \"Assyria proper\" referred to roughly the northern half of Mesopotamia (the southern half being Babylonia), with [[Nineveh]] as its capital. The Assyrian kings controlled a large kingdom at three different times in history. These are called the ''Old'' (20th to 15th centuries BC), ''Middle'' (15th to 10th centuries BC), and ''[[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]]'' (911\u2013612 BC) kingdoms, or periods, of which the last is the most well known and best documented. Assyrians invented [[sapping|excavation to undermine]] [[fortification|city walls]], [[battering ram]]s to knock down gates, as well as the concept of a corps of [[engineers]], who bridged rivers with pontoons or provided soldiers with inflatable skins for swimming.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bertman|first=Stephen|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|location=New York|publisher=Oxford UP|year=2005|pages=}}</ref>\n\n[[Mitanni]] was an Indo-Iranian<ref>\"Mitanni.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. 2008.

The Elamite period is considered a starting point for the [[history of Iran]].\nThe [[Medes]] were an [[Ancient Iranian peoples|ancient Iranian people]]. They had established their own empire by the 6th century BC, having defeated the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] with the [[Chaldea]]ns. They overthrew [[Urartu]] later on as well. The Medes are credited with the foundation of the first Iranian empire, the largest of its day until [[Cyrus the Great]] established a unified Iranian empire of the Medes and [[Persian people|Persian]], often referred to as the [[Achaemenid Empire]], by defeating his grandfather and overlord, [[Astyages]] the king of Media.[[File:Achaemenid Empire at its greatest extent according to Oxford Atlas of World History 2002.jpg|thumb|533x533px|The [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Achaemenid Empire]] at its greatest extent, c. 500 BC|alt=|center]]The [[Achaemenid Empire]] was the largest and most significant of the [[Persian Empire]]s, and followed the [[Median Empire]] as the second great empire of the Iranians. It is noted in western history as the foe of the [[Greek city states]] in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], for freeing the [[Israelites]] from their [[Babylonian captivity]], for its successful model of a centralized bureaucratic administration, the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]] (one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]), and for instituting [[Aramaic]] as the empire's [[official language]]. Because of the Empire's vast extent and long endurance, Persian influence upon the language, religion, architecture, philosophy, law and government of nations around the world lasts to this day. At the height of its power, the Achaemenid dynasty encompassed approximately 8.0&nbsp;million square kilometers, held the greatest percentage of world population to date, stretched three continents (Europe, Asia and Africa) and was territorially the largest empire of classical antiquity.\n[[File:Scythia-Parthia 100 BC.png|Geographical extent of Iranian influence in the 1st century BC.

Their power was based on a combination of the guerrilla warfare of a mounted nomadic tribe, with organizational skills to build and administer a vast empire \u2013 even though it never matched in power and extent the Persian empires that preceded and followed it. The [[Parthian Empire]] was led by the Arsacid dynasty, which reunited and ruled over significant portions of the [[Near East]] and beyond, after defeating and disposing the Hellenistic [[Seleucid Empire]], beginning in the late 3rd century BC. It was the third native dynasty of ancient Iran (after the [[Medes|Median]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] dynasties). Parthia had many wars with the [[Roman Republic]] (and subsequently the [[Roman Empire]]), which marked the start of what would be over 700 years of frequent [[Roman-Persian Wars]].\n\nThe [[Sassanid Empire]], lasting the length of the [[Late Antiquity]] period, is considered to be one of Iran's most important and influential historical periods.

These tablets, known collectively as the [[Anitta]] text,<ref>ed. [[StBoT]] 18</ref> begin by telling how [[Pithana]] the king of [[Kussara]] or Kussar (a small [[city-state]] yet to be identified by archaeologists) conquered the neighbouring city of [[Ne\u0161a]] ([[Kanesh]]). However, the real subject of these tablets is [[Pithana]]'s son [[Anitta]], who conquered several neighbouring cities, including [[Hattusa]] and [[Zalpuwa]] ([[Zalpa]]).\n\nAssyrian inscriptions of [[Shalmaneser I]] (c. 1270 BC) first mention ''[[Urartu|Uruartri]]'' as one of the states of [[Nairi (people)|Nairi]] \u2013 a loose confederation of small kingdoms and tribal states in the [[Armenian Highland]] from the 13th to 11th centuries BC. Uruartri itself was in the region around [[Lake Van]]. The Nairi states were repeatedly subjected to attacks by the Assyrians, especially under Tukulti-Ninurta I (c. 1240 BC), [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (c. 1100 BC), Ashur-bel-kala (c. 1070 BC), [[Adad-nirari II]] (c. 900), [[Tukulti-Ninurta II]] (c. 890), and [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883\u2013859 BC).\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] was an independent kingdom from 321 BC to 428 AD, and a client state of the Roman and Persian empires until 428. Between 95\u201355 BC under the rule of [[Tigranes the Great|King Tigranes the Great]], the kingdom of Armenia became a large and powerful empire stretching from the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]s.

Judah emerged somewhat later than Israel, probably during the 9th century BC, but the subject is one of considerable controversy.<ref>Grabbe 2008, pp. 225\u2013226</ref> Israel came into increasing conflict with the expanding [[neo-Assyrian empire]], which first split its territory into several smaller units and then destroyed its capital, Samaria (722). A series of campaigns by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] between 597 and 582 led to the destruction of Judah.\n\nFollowed by the fall of Babylon to the [[Persian empire]], Jews were allowed, by [[Cyrus the Great]], to [[Return to Zion|return to Judea]]. The [[Hasmonean Kingdom]] (followed by the [[Maccabean revolt]]) had existed during the Hellenistic period and then the [[Herodian kingdom]] during the Roman period.\n\n====Others====\n{{Main|Pre-Islamic Arabia|Ancient history of Yemen}}\n\nThe history of [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]] before the rise of [[Islam]] in the 630s is not known in great detail. Archaeological exploration in the [[Arabian peninsula]] has been sparse; indigenous written sources are limited to the many inscriptions and coins from southern Arabia. Existing material consists primarily of written sources from other traditions (such as [[Egypt]]ians, [[Greece|Greeks]], [[Persia]]ns, [[Roman Empire|Romans]], etc.) and [[oral tradition]]s later recorded by Islamic scholars. Many small kingdoms prospered from Red sea and [[Indian Ocean trade]]. Major kingdoms included the [[Sabaeans]], [[Kingdom of Awsan|Awsan]], [[Lakhmids|Lahkimid]] [[Himyarite Kingdom|Himyar]] and the [[Nabataeans|Nabateans]]. Arab kingdoms are occasionally mentioned in the Hebrew [[Old Testament]] under the name of [[Edom]].\nThough the [[Ugarit]]ic site is thought to have been inhabited earlier, [[Neolithic]] Ugarit was already important enough to be fortified with a wall early on. The first written evidence mentioning the city comes from the nearby city of [[Ebla]], c. 1800 BC. [[Ugarit]] passed into the sphere of influence of Egypt, which deeply influenced its art.

It was concentrated along the middle to lower reaches of the [[Nile River]] reaching its greatest extension during the 2nd millennium [[Before Christ|BC]], which is referred to as the [[New Kingdom]] period. It reached broadly from the [[Nile Delta]] in the north, as far south as [[Jebel Barkal]] at the [[Fourth Cataract]] of the Nile. Extensions to the geographical range of ancient Egyptian civilization included, at different times, areas of the southern [[Levant]], the Eastern Desert and the [[Red Sea]] coastline, the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the [[Libyan Desert|Western Desert]] (focused on the several [[oasis|oases]]).\n\nAncient Egypt developed over at least three and a half [[millennia]]. It began with the incipient unification of Nile Valley polities around 3500 BC and is conventionally thought to have ended in 30 BC when the early [[Roman Empire]] conquered and absorbed [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] as a province. (Though this last did not represent the first period of foreign domination, the Roman period was to witness a marked, if gradual transformation in the political and religious life of the Nile Valley, effectively marking the termination of independent civilisational development).\n\nThe civilization of ancient Egypt was based on a finely balanced control of natural and human resources, characterised primarily by controlled [[irrigation]] of the fertile Nile Valley; the mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions; the early development of an independent [[writing|writing system]] and [[literature]]; the organisation of collective projects; [[trade]] with surrounding regions in east / central Africa and the eastern [[Mediterranean]]; finally, [[military]] ventures that exhibited strong characteristics of imperial hegemony and territorial domination of neighbouring cultures at different periods. Motivating and organizing these activities were a socio-political and economic [[elite]] that achieved social consensus by means of an elaborate system of [[religion|religious belief]] under the figure of a (semi)-divine ruler (usually male) from a succession of ruling [[dynasty|dynasties]] and which related to the larger world by means of [[polytheism|polytheistic beliefs]].\n\n==== Nubia ====\n[[File:NubianPharoahs.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pharaoh]]s of Nubia]]\n\nThe [[Kushite]] civilization, which is also known as Nubia, was formed before a period of Egyptian incursion into the area. The first cultures arose in what is now [[Sudan]] before the time of a unified [[Egypt]], and the most widespread culture is known as the [[Kerma culture|Kerma civilization]]. Egyptians referred to Nubia as \"Ta-Seti,\" or \"The Land of the Bow,\" since the Nubians were known to be expert archers. The two civilization shared an abundance of peaceful cultural interchange and cooperation, including mixed marriages and even the same gods. In the New Kingdom, Nubians became indistinguishable in the archaeological record from Egyptians. The Kingdom of Kush survived longer than that of Egypt and at its greatest extent Nubia ruled over Egypt (under the leadership of king [[Piye]]), and controlled Egypt during the 8th century BC as the [[Kushite Empire|25th Dynasty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientsudan.org/history_06_nubconegypt.htm|title=Ancient Sudan~ Nubia: History: The Kushite Conquest of Egypt|work=ancientsudan.org}}</ref>\n\nIt is also referred to as [[Aethiopia|Ethiopia]] in ancient Greek and Roman records. According to Josephus and other classical writers, the Kushite Empire covered all of Africa, and some parts of Asia and Europe at one time or another. In contrast to the Egyptians the Nubians had an unusually high number of ruling queens also known as [[Kandake]], especially during the golden age of the Meroitic Kingdom. . Unlike the rest of the world at the time, women in Nubia exercised significant control in society.<ref>{{cite web |last= Kneller  |first=Tara L. |url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Role_Women.html |title=Role of Women in Nubia [Kneller] |website=africa.upenn.edu|access-date=2018-09-20}}</ref> The Kushites are also famous for having buried their monarchs along with all their courtiers in mass graves.

Located near the Bolan Pass, to the west of the Indus River valley and between the present-day Pakistani cities of [[Quetta]], [[Kalat, Pakistan|Kalat]] and [[Sibi]], Mehrgarh was discovered in 1974 by an archaeological team directed by French archaeologist Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Jarrige, and was excavated continuously between 1974 and 1986. The earliest settlement at Mehrgarh&nbsp;\u2013 in the northeast corner of the {{convert|495|acre|km2}} site&nbsp;\u2013 was a small farming village dated between 7000\u20135500 BC.\nEarly Mehrgarh residents lived in mud brick houses, stored their grain in granaries, fashioned tools with local copper ore, and lined their large basket containers with bitumen. They cultivated six-row barley, einkorn and emmer wheat, jujubes and dates, and herded sheep, goats and cattle. Residents of the later period (5500 BC to 2600 BC) put much effort into crafts, including flint knapping, tanning, bead production, and metal working.

The largest of these nations were [[Magadha]], [[Kosala]], [[Kuru (India)|Kuru]] and [[Gandhara]]. Notably, the great epics of [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] are rooted in this classical period.\n\nAmongst the sixteen Mahajanapadas, the kingdom of [[Magadha]] rose to prominence under a number of dynasties that peaked in power under the reign of [[Ashoka]] [[Maurya]] one of India's most legendary and famous emperors. During the reign of [[Ashoka]], the four dynasties of [[Chola dynasty|Chola]], [[Chera dynasty|Chera]], and [[Pandya]] were ruling in the South, while the King [[Devanampiya Tissa]] was controlling the Anuradhapura Kingdom (now [[Sri Lanka]]).

AD 320\u2013550). This was a period of relative peace, law and order, and extensive achievements in religion, education, mathematics, arts, Sanskrit literature and drama. Grammar, composition, logic, metaphysics, mathematics, medicine, and [[astronomy]] became increasingly specialized and reached an advanced level. The Gupta Empire was weakened and ultimately ruined by the raids of [[Huna people|Hunas]] (a branch of the [[Hephthalite]]s emanating from Central Asia). Under [[Harsha]] (r. 606\u201347), North India was reunited briefly.\n\nThe educated speech at that time was [[Sanskrit]], while the dialects of the general population of northern India were referred to as [[Prakrit]]s.

Some historians believe that the neolithic Erlitou culture (1900-1600 BC) is the [[Xia dynasty|Xia Dynasty]] but whether archaeological discoveries in the area Xia Dynasty or a different culture remains in doubt.\n<ref>{{Cite book|title=World History Cultures, States and Society to 1500|last=Berger|first=Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|last4=Parkinson|first4=Brian|last5=Reeves|first5=Andrew|last6=Williams|first6=Nadejda|publisher=University of North Georgia, Press|isbn=978-1-940771-10-6|location=Dahlonega, Georgia|page=127|date=2016-09-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=China: Five Thousand Years of History and Civilization|year=2007|publisher=City University of HK Press|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-fAxn_9f8wC&pg=PA25 |isbn=9789629371401}}</ref>\nThe early part of the [[Shang dynasty]] described in traditional histories (c. 1600\u20131300) is commonly identified with archaeological finds at [[Erligang culture|Erligang]], [[Zhengzhou]] and [[Yanshi]], south of the [[Yellow River]] in modern-day [[Henan]] province.\nThe last capital of the Shang (c. 1300\u20131046 BC) at [[Anyang]] (also in Henan) has been directly confirmed by the discovery there of the earliest Chinese texts, inscriptions of divination records on the bones or shells of animals&nbsp;\u2013 the so-called \"[[oracle bones]]\".\n\nTowards the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the Shang were overrun by the [[Zhou dynasty]] from the [[Wei River]] valley to the west. The death of [[King Wu of Zhou]] soon after the conquest triggered a succession crisis and civil war that was suppressed by Wu's brother, the [[Duke of Zhou]], acting as regent. The Zhou rulers at this time invoked the concept of the [[Mandate of Heaven]] to legitimize their rule, a concept that would be influential for almost every successive dynasty. The Zhou initially established their capital in the west near modern [[Xi'an]], near the Yellow River, but they would preside over a series of expansions into the [[Yangtze River]] valley. This would be the first of many population migrations from north to south in Chinese history.\n[[File:01 terracottawarriorsgroup.jpg|left|thumb|[[Terracotta Army|Terracotta Warriors]] from the time of [[Qin Shi Huang]]]]\nIn the 8th century BC, power became decentralized during the [[Spring and Autumn period]], named after the influential ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]''. In this period, local military leaders used by the Zhou began to assert their power and vie for hegemony. The situation was aggravated by the invasion of other peoples from the northwest, such as the [[Quanrong]], forcing the Zhou to move their capital east to [[Luoyang]]. This marks the second large phase of the Zhou dynasty: the Eastern Zhou. In each of the hundreds of states that eventually arose, local strongmen held most of the political power and continued their subservience to the Zhou kings in name only. Local leaders for instance started using royal titles for themselves. The [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] of Chinese philosophy blossomed during this period, and such influential intellectual movements as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] and [[Mohism]] were founded, partly in response to the changing political world. The Spring and Autumn period is marked by a falling apart of the central Zhou power. China now consisted of hundreds of states, some only as large as a village with a fort.\n\nAfter further political consolidation, seven prominent states remained by the end of the 5th century BC, and the years in which these few states battled each other is known as the [[Warring States period]]. Though there remained a nominal [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] king until 256 BC, he was largely a figurehead and held little power. As neighboring territories of these warring states, including areas of modern [[Sichuan]] and [[Liaoning]], were annexed, they were governed under the new local administrative system of [[Commandery (China)|commandery]] and [[prefecture]]. This system had been in use since the Spring and Autumn period and parts can still be seen in the modern system of [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|Sheng and Xian]] (province and county). The final expansion in this period began during the reign of Ying Zheng, the king of Qin. His unification of the other six powers, and further annexations in the modern regions of [[Zhejiang]], [[Fujian]], [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] in 214 BC enabled him to proclaim himself the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]] (Qin Shi Huangdi).[[File:Han foreign relations CE 2.jpg|alt=Han Dynasty Map. 1 AD |center|thumb|500x500px|The Chinese [[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]] dominated the East Asia region at the beginning of the first millennium AD ]]\n\nQin Shi Huangdi ruled the unified China directly with absolute power. In contrast to the decentralized and feudal rule of earlier dynasties the Qin set up a number of 'commandries' around the country which answered directly to the emperor. Nationwide the philosophy of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]] was enforced and publications promoting rival ideas such as Confucianism were prohibited. In his reign unified China created the first continuous [[Great Wall]] with the use of forced labor. [[Qin's campaign against the Yue tribes|Invasions]] were launched southward to annex Vietnam.  After the emperor's death rebels rose against the Qin's brutal reign in new civil wars. Ultimately the Han Dynasty arose and ruled China for over four centuries in what accounted for a long period in prosperity, with a brief interruption by the [[Xin dynasty|Xin Dynasty]].  The Han Dynasty played a great role in developing the Silk Road which would transfer wealth and ideas for millennia, and also invented paper. Though the Han enjoyed great military and economic success it was strained by the rise of aristocrats who disobeyed the central government. Public frustration provoked the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] \u2013 though a failure it nonetheless accelerated the empire's downfall. After 208 AD the Han Dynasty broke up into [[Three Kingdoms period|rival kingdoms]]. China would remain divided until 581 under the Sui Dynasty, during the era of division Buddhism would be introduced to China for the first time.\n\n====Neighbors of China====\n[[File:Gold monster.jpg|thumb|231x231px|Gold stag with eagle's head, and ten further heads in the antlers. From a [[Xiongnu]] tomb. 4th\u20133rd century BC]]\nThe East Asian nations adjacent to China were all profoundly influenced by their interactions with [[East Asian cultural sphere|Chinese civilization]]. Mongolia, Korea and Vietnam often were at war with, [[Imperial Chinese Tributary System|paid tribute]] to, or annexed by Imperial Chinese states. [[Yayoi period|Yayoi]] Japan, though not occupied, had interactions with Imperial China that shaped its cultural development.\n\nMongolia in ancient times was nomadic. The ethnicities, cultures and languages in modern Mongolian territory were fluid and changed frequently. The use of horses to herd and migrate started during the Iron Age. These were [[Tengriism|Tengriist]] horse-riding pastoral kingdoms that had close contact with the sedentary agrarian Chinese. To appease the aggressive nomads, local Chinese rulers often gave important hostages and arranged marriages. In 208 BC the Xiongnu emperor [[Modu Chanyu]], in his first major military campaign, defeated the [[Donghu people|Donghu]], who split into the new tribes [[Xianbei]] and [[Wuhuan]]. The [[Xiongnu]] were the largest nomadic enemies of the Han Dynasty fighting [[Han\u2013Xiongnu War|wars]] for over three centuries with the Han Dynasty before dissolving. Afterwards the Xianbei returned to rule the Steppe north of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]]. The titles of Khangan and Khan come from the [[Xianbei]].\n\nAccording to the [[Records of the Grand Historian]] by the Chinese historian [[Sima Qian]], [[Wiman Joseon]] of Korea was founded by General [[Wei Man|Wiman]] from China who originally served but usurped the throne of [[Gojoseon]] (the name of ancient Korea) in 194 BC.<ref>[[Records of the Grand Historian]] Vol.55 Korea \u53f2\u8a18 \u671d\u9bae\u5217\u4f1d\u7b2c\u4e94\u5341\u4e94 \"\u671d\u9bae\u738b\u6e80\u8005\u3001\u6545\u71d5\u4eba\u4e5f\"</ref> In 108 BC, the [[Han dynasty]] of China destroyed Wiman Joseon and established four commanderies on the northern Korean peninsula. Three of the commanderies were shortly lost but the [[Lelang commandery]] remained on the northwestern Korean peninsula for about 400 years. The [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] of [[Baekje]], [[Goguryeo]] and [[Silla]] emerged after the fall of Gojoseon and eventually expelled the Chinese. The Three Kingdoms competed with each other both economically and militarily; Goguryeo and Baekje were the main players for much of the Three Kingdoms era and controlled most of the Korean peninsula. At times more powerful than neighboring Chinese dynasties, Goguryeo (where the name \"Korea\" comes from) was a regional power that defeated [[Goguryeo-Sui Wars|massive invasions]] by the [[Sui dynasty]] multiple times.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/history.htm#The%20Ko%20Choson|title=Korea's History (Ko-Choson, Three Kingdoms, Parhae Kingdom, Unified Shilla, Koryo Dynasty, Colonial Period, Independence Struggle, Provisional Government of Korea, Independence Army, Republic of Korea,)|publisher=Asianinfo.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128065300/http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/history.htm|archivedate=28 January 2010|url-status=dead|accessdate=2010-01-09}}</ref> Goguryeo and Baekje were eventually destroyed by a [[Tang dynasty]] and Silla alliance.

Large scale rice cultivation began around 1200 BC, onward. Pottery and Bamboo working became common in this time period as well as widespread trade and navigation on inland rivers. During this time Vietnam was allegedly ruled by the semi-mythical [[Hong Bang Dynasty]], the last Hong King was deposed by a Chinese Qin Invasion, in turn however a Chinese General declared independence and founded the [[Nanyue]] combining Chinese and Vietnamese traditions.\n[[File:Bronze Mirror in Ancient Japan.jpg|alt=Ancient Japanese Bronze Mirror|left|thumb|175x175px|Bronze Mirror, from the [[Yayoi period]] of Japan]]\n[[Nanyue|Nan Yue]], after a century of political maneuvers the country was annexed by the [[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]] in 111 B.C Originally the Han were lenient governors and attempted to integrate the Vietnamese upper class into Chinese Patriarchy. However Chinese abuse of certain vassals led to the famous but futile revolt of the [[Tr\u01b0ng Sisters|Trung Sisters]]. Afterwards Chinese authorities ruled Vietnam directly and attempted to push Chinese culture upon the populace though peasants continued to speak [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. Vietnam would be under Chinese domination for a millennium.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/4.htm|title=Vietnam \u2013 The Chinese Millennium|website=countrystudies.us|access-date=2018-07-25}}</ref> Meanwhile, South Vietnam held a completely different identity, populated mainly by [[Chams|Cham]] People. While Northern Vietnam came under Chinese Domination, the [[Champa|Champa Kingdom]] became closer to Indian kingdoms through trade and embraced [[Hinduism in Vietnam|Hinduism]].\n\n[[History of Japan|Japan]] first appeared in written records in AD 57 with the following mention in China's ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'':<ref>\u5f8c\u6f22\u66f8, \u6703\u7a3d\u6d77\u5916\u6709\u6771\u9bf7\u4eba \u5206\u7232\u4e8c\u5341\u9918\u570b</ref> \"Across the ocean from [[Luoyang]] are the people of [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]].

The inhabitants also show traits of the pre-sinicized Wu people with tattooing, teeth-pulling and baby-carrying. The ''Book of Wei'' records the physical descriptions which are similar to ones on ''[[Haniwa]]'' statues, such men with braided hair, tattooing and women wearing large, single-piece clothing.

This period saw the expansion of the Greek world around the Mediterranean, with the founding of Greek city-states as far afield as Sicily in the West and the Black sea in the East.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Boardman|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Hammond|editor2-first=N.G.L|title=The Cambridge Ancient History Volume III, Part 3: The Expansion of the Greek World, Eighth to Sixth Centuries B.C.|page=xiii|chapter=Preface|isbn=978-0-521-23447-4|year=1970}}</ref> Politically, the Archaic period in Greece saw the collapse of the power of the old aristocracies,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Boardman|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Hammond|editor2-first=N.G.L|title=The Cambridge Ancient History Volume III, Part 3: The Expansion of the Greek World, Eighth to Sixth Centuries B.C.|page=xv|chapter=Preface|isbn=978-0-521-23447-4|year=1970}}</ref> with democratic reforms in Athens and the development of Sparta's unique [[Spartan Constitution|constitution]]. The end of the Archaic period also saw the rise of Athens, which would come to be a dominant power in the Classical period, after the reforms of [[Solon]] and the tyranny of [[Pisistratus]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe Classical Greek world was dominated throughout the fifth century BC by the major powers of Athens and Sparta. Through the Delian League, Athens was able to convert Pan-hellenist sentiment and fear of the Persian threat into a powerful empire, and this, along with the conflict between Sparta and Athens culminating in the [[Peloponnesian war]], was the major political development of the first part of the Classical period.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Lewis|editor2-last=Boardman|editor3-last=Davies|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Ostwald|editor1-first=D.M.|editor2-first=John|editor3-first=J.K.|editor4-first=M.|title=The Cambridge Ancient History Volume V: The Fifth Century B.C.|chapter=preface|pages=xiii\u2013xiv|isbn=978-0-521-23347-7}}</ref>\n\nThe period in Greek history from the death of [[Alexander the Great]] until the rise of the Roman empire and its conquest of Egypt in 30 BC is known as the [[Hellenistic period]]. The name derives from the Greek word ''Hellenistes'' (\"the Greek speaking ones\"), and describes the spread of Greek culture into the non-Greek world following the conquests of Alexander and the rise of his successors.\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|Battle of Corinth]] in 146 BC, Greece came under [[ancient Rome|Roman]] rule, ruled from the province of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]]. In 27 BC, Augustus organised the Greek peninsula into the province of [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]]. Greece remained under Roman control until the [[Tetrarchy|break up]] of the Roman empire, in which it remained part of the Eastern Empire. Much of Greece remained under Byzantine control until the end of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine empire]] in 1453 AD.{{Main|Ancient Rome}}[[File:RomanEmpire 117 recoloured 2.svg|center|thumb|Roman Empire 117 AD. The Senatorial Provinces marked on the map were considered to be the 'developed' areas of the empire by Ancient Romans. |500x500px]]<nowiki> </nowiki>[[Ancient Rome]] was a civilization that grew out of the city-state of Rome, originating as a small agricultural community founded on the Italian Peninsula in the 9th century BC. In its twelve centuries of existence, Roman civilization shifted from a monarchy to an oligarchic republic to an increasingly autocratic empire.\n\nRoman civilization is often grouped into \"classical antiquity\" with [[ancient Greece]], a civilization that inspired much of the [[culture of ancient Rome]]. Ancient Rome contributed greatly to the development of [[Roman law|law]], [[Roman military|war]], [[Roman art|art]], [[Roman literature|literature]], [[Roman architecture|architecture]], and [[Romance languages|language]] in the [[Western world]], and its [[history of Rome|history]] continues to have a major influence on the world today. The Roman civilization came to dominate Europe and the Mediterranean region through conquest and assimilation.\n\nThroughout the territory under the control of ancient Rome, residential [[architecture]] ranged from very modest houses to [[Roman villa|country villas]]. A number of Roman founded cities had [[monument]]al structures. Many contained fountains with fresh drinking-water supplied by hundreds of miles of [[Aqueduct (Roman)|aqueducts]], [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatres]], [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasiums]], [[thermae|bath complexes]] sometime with libraries and shops, marketplaces, and occasionally functional sewers. A number of factors led to the eventual [[decline of the Roman Empire]]. The western half of the empire, including [[Hispania]], [[Gaul]], and Italy, eventually broke into independent kingdoms in the 5th century; the Eastern Roman Empire, governed from [[Constantinople]], is referred to as the [[Byzantine Empire]] after AD 476, the traditional date for the \"fall of Rome\" and subsequent onset of the [[post-classical age|Middle Ages]].\n\n====Late Antiquity====\n[[File:Invasions of the Roman Empire 1.png|center|thumb|400x400px|The [[Migration Period|Age of Migrations]] in Europe was deeply detrimental to the late [[Roman Empire]]. ]]\n{{Main|Late Antiquity}}\n\nThe [[Roman Empire]] underwent considerable social, cultural and organizational change starting with reign of [[Diocletian]], who began the custom of splitting the Empire into [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] and [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] halves ruled by multiple emperors. Beginning with [[Constantine the Great]] the Empire was [[Christianization|Christianized]], and a new capital founded at [[Constantinople]]. [[Germanic migrations|Migrations]] of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes disrupted Roman rule from the late 4th century onwards, culminating in the eventual [[Decline of the Roman Empire|collapse of the Empire in the West]] in 476, replaced by the so-called [[Germanic monarchy|barbarian kingdoms]]. The resultant cultural fusion of [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] and Christian traditions formed the cultural foundations of [[Europe]].\n\n====Nomads and Iron Age Peoples====\n{{Further|Anglo-Saxons|Celts|Viking|Norsemen|Viking Age|Barbarian}}\nThe Huns left practically no written records. There is no record of what happened between the time they left [[Mongolian Plateau]] and arrived in Europe 150 years later. The last mention of the northern Xiongnu was their defeat by the Chinese in 151 at the [[lake of Barkol]],<ref>[[Barkol Kazakh Autonomous County|Barkol]]</ref> after which they fled to the western steppe at [[Kangju]] (centered on the city of [[Hazrat-e Turkestan|Turkistan]] in [[Kazakhstan]]). Chinese records between the 3rd and 4th centuries suggest that a small tribe called [[Yueban]], remnants of Northern Xiongnu, was distributed about the steppe of Kazakhstan.\n\nThe [[Huns|Hun-Xiongnu]] connection is controversial at best and is often disputed but is also not completely discredited.{{sfn|Wright|2011|p=60}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=The fall of the Roman Empire : a new history of Rome and the Barbarians|last=J.)|first=Heather, P.J.

The [[Western Roman Empire]] in Europe and the [[Gupta Empire]] in India, and the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin]] in [[North China]] were overwhelmed by tribal invasions. Nomadic invasions along with worldwide natural climate change, the [[Plague of Justinian]] and the rise of proselytizing religions changed the face of the Old World. Still disconnected was the New World who also built complex societies but at a separate and different pace. By 500 the world era of [[Post-classical history]] had begun. \nDespite being placed in different eras of history in an academic view of world history, Ancient and Post Classical eras are linked with each other in the case of the Old World. Land and coastal trade routes, often went on similar or the same directions, and many of the inventions and religions which were birthed prior to 500 A.D such as Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism  and Buddhism grew to be even more important for societies and individuals.\n\n==Maps==\n{{Gallery\n| title        = Political and Societal maps depicting the Ancient World\n| align        = center\n| footer       = Depicts placement of peoples and national boundaries\n| height       = 200\n| width        = 150\n| File:World 2000 BCE.png\n | alt1=Map of the world in 2000 BC\n | Map of the world in 2000 BC.\n| File:World 1000 BCE.png\n | alt2=Map of the world in 1000 BC.\n | Map of the world in 1000 BC.\n| File:World 200 BCE.PNG\n | alt3= Map of the world in 200 BC.\n | Map of the world in 200 BC.\n| File:World in 300 CE.PNG\n | alt4= Map of the World in 300 AD.\n | Map of the World in 300 AD.\n}}\n\n==See also==\n* {{Portal inline|size=tiny|History}}\n* [[Outline of ancient history]]\n** [[Outline of ancient China]]\n** [[Outline of ancient Egypt]]\n** [[Outline of ancient India]]\n** [[Outline of classical studies]]\n*** [[Outline of ancient Greece]]\n*** [[Outline of ancient Rome]]\n* [[List of ancient dishes|List of ancient dishes and foods]]\n* [[List of historians]], inclusive of most major historians\n* [[List of history journals#Classical]]\n* [[Classics]]\n* [[Timeline of ancient history]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n'''General information'''\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n#{{Cite book\n| first =\n| last =\n| author-link =\n| first2 =\n| last2 =\n| editor-last = Alcock\n| editor-first = Susan E.\n| editor2-first = D'Altroy\n| editor2-last = Terence N.\n| editor3-first =Morrison\n| editor3-last = Terence N.\n| editor4-first =Sinopoli\n| display-editors = 3\n| editor4-last = Carla M.\n| title =Empires: Perspectives from Archaeology and History\n| year =201\n| page =546\n| place =Cambridge\n| publisher =Cambridge University Press\n| url =\n| isbn = 978-0-521-77020-0 }}\n#{{cite book |last = Carr |first=E.H.
