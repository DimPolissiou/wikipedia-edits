She was the daughter of John Evan Thomas, a tenant farmer and churchwarden, and his wife, Jane. She had two older sisters, an older brother, John, and a younger brother, Edward. Her parents' house, Dolwar Fechan, was an isolated farmhouse some {{convert|2+1/2|mi|spell=in|0}} south of Llanfihangel and {{convert|1|mi|spell=in}} north of Dolanog, set among hills and streams.\n\nNot far away lay [[St Melangell's Church, Pennant Melangell|Pennant Melangell]], where Saint [[Melangell]] had lived as a hermit in the 6th century.<ref>''[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]'', Journal of the Cambrian Archaeological Association, Vol. III, 6th Series, London, 1903.</ref>\n\nAnn was brought up in the Anglican church. In 1794, her mother died when she was 18, and about that time or perhaps earlier she followed her brothers John and Edward in being drawn to the Methodists. In 1796 she joined the [[Calvinistic Methodism|Calvinistic Methodist]] movement after hearing the preaching of Benjamin Jones of [[Pwllheli]].\n\nAfter the deaths of both her parents, she married Thomas Griffiths, a farmer from the parish of [[Meifod]] and an elder of the Calvinistic Methodist church. However, she died after childbirth in August 1805, at the age of 29, and was buried on 12 August 1805 at Llanfihangel-yng-Ngwynfa.\n\nAnn Griffiths left a handful of stanzas in the [[Welsh language]]. These were preserved and published by her mentor, the Calvinistic Methodist minister, John Hughes of [[Pontrobert]], and his wife, Ruth, who had been a maid at Ann Griffiths' farm and was a close confidante.\n\n==Poetry==\nAnn's poems express her fervent evangelical Christian faith and reflect her incisive intellect and thorough scriptural knowledge. She is the most prominent female hymnist in Welsh.

Her poetry reflects fervent evangelical Christian faith and thorough scriptural knowledge.<ref>James E. Wyn: ''Introduction to the Life and Work of Ann Griffiths'' [http://www.anngriffiths.cardiff.ac.uk/introduction.html Retrieved 29 January 2018.]</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:A letter in the hand of Ann Griffiths (1776-1805) NLW3365236.jpg|thumb|A letter in the hand of Ann Griffiths]]\nAnn was born in April 1776 near the village of [[Llanfihangel-yng-Ngwynfa]], {{convert|6|mi|spell=in|0}} from the market town of [[Llanfyllin]] in the former county of [[Montgomeryshire]] (now in [[Powys]]). She was the daughter of John Evan Thomas, a tenant farmer and churchwarden, and his wife, Jane. She had two older sisters, an older brother, John, and a younger brother, Edward. Her parents' house, Dolwar Fechan, was an isolated farmhouse some {{convert|2+1/2|mi|spell=in|0}} south of Llanfihangel and {{convert|1|mi|spell=in}} north of Dolanog, set among hills and streams.\n\nNot far away lay [[St Melangell's Church, Pennant Melangell|Pennant Melangell]], where Saint [[Melangell]] had lived as a hermit in the 6th century.<ref>''[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]'', Journal of the Cambrian Archaeological Association, Vol. III, 6th Series, London, 1903.</ref>\n\nAnn was brought up in the Anglican church. In 1794, her mother died when she was 18, and about that time or perhaps earlier she followed her brothers John and Edward in being drawn to the Methodists. In 1796 she joined the [[Calvinistic Methodism|Calvinistic Methodist]] movement after hearing the preaching of Benjamin Jones of [[Pwllheli]].\n\nAfter the deaths of both her parents, she married Thomas Griffiths, a farmer from the parish of [[Meifod]] and an elder of the Calvinistic Methodist church. However, she died after childbirth in August 1805, at the age of 29, and was buried on 12 August 1805 at Llanfihangel-yng-Ngwynfa.\n\nAnn Griffiths left a handful of stanzas in the [[Welsh language]]. These were preserved and published by her mentor, the Calvinistic Methodist minister, John Hughes of [[Pontrobert]], and his wife, Ruth, who had been a maid at Ann Griffiths' farm and was a close confidante.\n\n==Poetry==\nAnn's poems express her fervent evangelical Christian faith and reflect her incisive intellect and thorough scriptural knowledge. She is the most prominent female hymnist in Welsh. Her work is regarded as a highlight of [[Literature of Wales (Welsh language)|Welsh literature]], and her longest poem ''{{lang|cy|Rhyfedd, rhyfedd gan angylion...}}'' (Wondrous, wondrous to angels...)<ref>{{cite web |last1=James |first1=E.

From the indexes located in the back of the hymnary, on pages 926ff entitled \"Translated Hymns\", it is clear that the majority of the hymns come from German, Scandinavian and Latin sources, however Greek, Czech, French, and other sources are also present.\n\nThe cover of this hymnary is black with a gold imprinted logo on the front cover. The logo used is a Latin cross with budded arms superimposed over a lyre, on a diamond-shaped background. Inside these covers one finds more than hymn texts: The Church Year is summarized; followed by the full texts of the [[Augsburg Confession]]; the texts of the [[Apostles' Creed]], the [[Nicene Creed]], and the [[Athanasian Creed]]; and the [[Luther's Small Catechism|Small Catechism]] by Dr. [[Martin Luther]]. Prayers are included as well as four different rites of The Divine Service. ''The Divine Service: Rite One'' is based on the ''Danish Ritual of 1685''; ''The Divine Service Rite Two'' is from the ''Common Service'' from 1888; ''The Divine Service: Rite Three'' is a new setting by Dr. Alfred Fremder; and ''The Divine Service: Rite Four'' is the ''Lutheran \"Chorale Mass\"''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blc.edu/comm/gargy/gargy1/ELH.ELS.report.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-19 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913003036/http://www.blc.edu/comm/gargy/gargy1/ELH.ELS.report.html |archivedate=2009-09-13 }}</ref>   Other services included here are The Office of the Prime, Matins, Vespers, Compline, and others. A Service of Private Confession and Absolution is also included. Psalms, canticles, and other resources are also found here.\n\nWhile most American Lutherans are familiar with a joint confession of sins followed by a spoken absolution from the pastor, this hymnary features an optional Individual Absolution (on page 43). Before each worshipper hears the word of absolution, the pastor says, \"Upon this your confession, come forward to the altar of the Lord and receive the declaration of the forgiveness of all your sins. ''The communicants come forward and kneel at the altar rail.''\"\n\nA total of 602 hymns appear in this work. Some appear merely as lyrics with only a suggested tune listed, others include musical notation. The text is enriched by language like that in the New King James Version.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}{{Lutheran Divine Service}}\n{{Lutheran hymnody}}\n{{Christianity-stub}}\n\n[[Category:Lutheran hymnals]]\n[[Category:1996 books]]\n[[Category:1996 in Christianity]]\n[[Category:1996 in music]]\n", "text_old": "#REDIRECT [[Evangelical Lutheran Synod#Hymnal]]\n\n[[Category:Lutheran hymnals]]\n", "name_user": "Shruti14", "label": "safe", "comment": "made to new page", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_Lutheran_Hymnary"}

The game is free-to-play; however, to progress quickly within the game, players are encouraged to spend ''Farm Cash'' (in ''FarmVille'') or ''Farm Bucks'' (in ''FarmVille 2''), which are purchasable with real-world [[currency]].\n\nAfter launching on Facebook in 2009, ''FarmVille'' became the most popular game on the site, and held that position for over two years. At its peak, in March, 2010, the game had 83.76 million monthly [[active users]].

By May 2012, the game was ranked as the seventh most popular Facebook game. As of April 30, 2016, its rank had fallen to the one-hundred-and-tenth most popular Facebook game as measured by daily active users, while ''FarmVille 2'' had climbed to forty-second.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.appdata.com/leaderboard/apps?metric_select=mau_estimate&style=classic|title=Facebook Apps Leaderboard - AppData|work=appdata.com|access-date=30 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416114456/http://appdata.com/leaderboard/apps?metric_select=mau_estimate&style=classic|archive-date=16 April 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\nOnce players begin a farm, they first create a customizable avatar, which may be changed at any point.\n\n[[Image:Farmville.png|thumb|left|One player's customized farm]]\nThe player begins with an empty farm and a fixed starting number of Farm Coins, the primary currency in the game. Players earn XP ([[experience point]]s) for performing certain actions in the game such as plowing land or buying items. At certain XP benchmarks, the player's level rises. As the player obtains more items and progresses through levels, crops and animals become available to them via the \"market\" where items can be purchased using either Farm Coins or Farm Cash. Farm Cash is earned by leveling up or completing offers, or purchased for real money.\n\nThe main way a player earns Farm Coins, the less important of the two in-game currencies, is through harvesting crops or visiting their neighbors. The player does this by paying coins for plowing a unit of land. This readies the land for planting seeds, which will eventually be harvested after a set amount of time. The amount of time it takes for a crop to mature, and how much money a crop yields when harvested, is dependent on the crop planted and is noted on its entry in the \"market\" dialog.<ref name=\"custhelp\">\n{{cite web\n| url = http://zynga.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/583\n| title = How long does it take for a crop to wither?\n| author = \n| authorlink = \n| accessdate = 28 October 2009\n| date = 1 October 2009\n| publisher = [[Zynga]]\n}}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n</ref> They will wither, or they will be of no use when a crop-specific amount of time has elapsed, the amount of time being equal to 2.5 times the amount of time taken to grow the crop (for example, crops which take 8 hours to grow will wither after 2.5\u00d78=20 hours). However, a player can use Farm Cash (purchasable with real-world cash) to purchase an \"unwither\" to rejuvenate the crops or can use a biplane with \"instant grow\" to cause crops to be immediately available for harvest. Although the biplane can be purchased with coins, this special feature is only available for Farm Cash. As a player levels up more, crops with a higher payoff and economy will become available. Sometimes a crop will need a permit that costs Farm Cash in order to be planted.\n\nA player may buy or receive from friends livestock and trees or bushels, such as [[cherry]] trees or [[chicken]]s, which do not wither but instead become ready for harvest for preset amounts of money a set amount of time from their last harvest. Trees and livestock cannot die.\n\n=== In-game purchases ===\nThe two main in-game currencies, Farm Coins and Farm Cash (in ''FarmVille'') or Farm Bucks (in ''FarmVille 2''), are available for purchase from Zynga with real-world money. Coins can also be \"earned\" within the game by completing tasks or selling crops, and can be spent on basic in-game items such as seeds. Farm Cash and Farm Bucks are more difficult to acquire within the game, and cannot be earned within the farm's economic system, only by special actions like leveling up or completing tasks. Farm Cash and Farm Bucks provide a route to acquire further in-game items, such as additional animals for the farm, or to acquire in-game resources like animal feed, water, fuel and power, which are otherwise slow and/or laborious for players to acquire.\n\n===Social interaction===\nLike most Zynga games, ''FarmVille'' incorporates the [[social networking]] aspect of Facebook into many areas of gameplay. Contacting other players allows the player to improve their farm more quickly, by using their help as farmhands or by gaining rewards from helping them. Often the aid of other players is a substitute for Farm Cash, the game's purchasable in-game currency, giving players an effective choice between spamming their friends with ''FarmVille'' messages and requests, or paying real-world cash. ''FarmVille'' has allowed players to add neighbors that are not Facebook friends, thus allowing the player to have many neighbors at hand. Players invite friends or other players that are not Facebook friends to be their neighbors, allowing them to perform five actions on each other's farms per day by \"visiting\" it. Neighbors may also send gifts and supplies to each other, complete specialized tasks together for rewards, and join \"co-ops\" - joint efforts to grow a certain amount of certain crops. Gifts are sent as mystery gifts with expensive, but random items, special deliveries with building supplies, or by choosing a particular item to send. They cost the sending user nothing. For ''FarmVille''{{'}}s 2nd birthday, a series of different mystery gifts were added to the Gifts Page.\n\n==Development==\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n===Partnerships===\n''FarmVille'' occasionally runs in-game partnerships where users can visit another company's virtual farm and buy or receive items with their brand logo. For example, as of June 9, 2011, users could get free [[McDonald's]] hot air balloons, McCafe products and the ability to visit McDonald's' virtual farm.

Players earn XP ([[experience point]]s) for performing certain actions in the game such as plowing land or buying items. At certain XP benchmarks, the player's level rises. As the player obtains more items and progresses through levels, crops and animals become available to them via the \"market\" where items can be purchased using either Farm Coins or Farm Cash. Farm Cash is earned by leveling up or completing offers, or purchased for real money.\n\nThe main way a player earns Farm Coins, the less important of the two in-game currencies, is through harvesting crops or visiting their neighbors. The player does this by paying coins for plowing a unit of land. This readies the land for planting seeds, which will eventually be harvested after a set amount of time. The amount of time it takes for a crop to mature, and how much money a crop yields when harvested, is dependent on the crop planted and is noted on its entry in the \"market\" dialog.<ref name=\"custhelp\">\n{{cite web\n| url = http://zynga.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/583\n| title = How long does it take for a crop to wither?\n| author = \n| authorlink = \n| accessdate = 28 October 2009\n| date = 1 October 2009\n| publisher = [[Zynga]]\n}}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n</ref> They will wither, or they will be of no use when a crop-specific amount of time has elapsed, the amount of time being equal to 2.5 times the amount of time taken to grow the crop (for example, crops which take 8 hours to grow will wither after 2.5\u00d78=20 hours). However, a player can use Farm Cash (purchasable with real-world cash) to purchase an \"unwither\" to rejuvenate the crops or can use a biplane with \"instant grow\" to cause crops to be immediately available for harvest. Although the biplane can be purchased with coins, this special feature is only available for Farm Cash. As a player levels up more, crops with a higher payoff and economy will become available. Sometimes a crop will need a permit that costs Farm Cash in order to be planted.\n\nA player may buy or receive from friends livestock and trees or bushels, such as [[cherry]] trees or [[chicken]]s, which do not wither but instead become ready for harvest for preset amounts of money a set amount of time from their last harvest. Trees and livestock cannot die.\n\n=== In-game purchases ===\nThe two main in-game currencies, Farm Coins and Farm Cash (in ''FarmVille'') or Farm Bucks (in ''FarmVille 2''), are available for purchase from Zynga with real-world money. Coins can also be \"earned\" within the game by completing tasks or selling crops, and can be spent on basic in-game items such as seeds. Farm Cash and Farm Bucks are more difficult to acquire within the game, and cannot be earned within the farm's economic system, only by special actions like leveling up or completing tasks. Farm Cash and Farm Bucks provide a route to acquire further in-game items, such as additional animals for the farm, or to acquire in-game resources like animal feed, water, fuel and power, which are otherwise slow and/or laborious for players to acquire.\n\n===Social interaction===\nLike most Zynga games, ''FarmVille'' incorporates the [[social networking]] aspect of Facebook into many areas of gameplay. Contacting other players allows the player to improve their farm more quickly, by using their help as farmhands or by gaining rewards from helping them. Often the aid of other players is a substitute for Farm Cash, the game's purchasable in-game currency, giving players an effective choice between spamming their friends with ''FarmVille'' messages and requests, or paying real-world cash. ''FarmVille'' has allowed players to add neighbors that are not Facebook friends, thus allowing the player to have many neighbors at hand. Players invite friends or other players that are not Facebook friends to be their neighbors, allowing them to perform five actions on each other's farms per day by \"visiting\" it. Neighbors may also send gifts and supplies to each other, complete specialized tasks together for rewards, and join \"co-ops\" - joint efforts to grow a certain amount of certain crops. Gifts are sent as mystery gifts with expensive, but random items, special deliveries with building supplies, or by choosing a particular item to send. They cost the sending user nothing. For ''FarmVille''{{'}}s 2nd birthday, a series of different mystery gifts were added to the Gifts Page.\n\n==Development==\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n===Partnerships===\n''FarmVille'' occasionally runs in-game partnerships where users can visit another company's virtual farm and buy or receive items with their brand logo. For example, as of June 9, 2011, users could get free [[McDonald's]] hot air balloons, McCafe products and the ability to visit McDonald's' virtual farm.
