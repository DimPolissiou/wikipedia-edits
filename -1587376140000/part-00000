It forms part of a contiguous urban area with [[Gourock]] to the west and [[Port Glasgow]] to the east.\n\nThe [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 UK Census]] showed that Greenock had a population of 44,248, a decrease from the 46,861 recorded in the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 UK Census]]. It lies on the south bank of the Clyde at the \"[[Tail of the Bank]]\" where the [[River Clyde]] expands into the [[Firth of Clyde]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Name ===\nPlace-name scholar [[William J. Watson]] wrote that \"Greenock is well known in Gaelic as Grian\u00e1ig, dative of grian\u00e1g, a sunny knoll\".<ref>W. J. Watson, ''The History of the Celtic Place-Names of Scotland'' (Edinburgh, 1926), p. 201.</ref> The [[Scottish Gaelic]] place-name ''Grianaig'' is relatively common, with another (Greenock) near [[Callander]] in [[Menteith]] (formerly in Perthshire) and yet another at [[Muirkirk]] in [[Kyle, Ayrshire|Kyle]], now in [[East Ayrshire]].<ref>Watson, ''The History of the Celtic Place-Names of Scotland'', p. 201.</ref> Local writer R. M. Smith (1921) described the alternative derivation from [[Common Brittonic]] *''Graenag'', a \"gravelly\" or \"sandy place\", as more appropriate, accurately describing the original foreshore.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1921|pp=8\u20139}}</ref> Johnston (1934) notes that \"some Gaels call the seaport Gh\u00f3nait\", and that a possible derivation may be ''greannach'', meaning \"rough, gravelly\".<ref>Johnston, J.B. (1934) ''Place-names of Scotland\", John Murray, p. 197</ref> \n\nThe name of the town has had various spellings over time. It was printed in early Acts of Parliament as ''Grinok'', ''Greenhok'', ''Grinock'', ''Greenhoke'', ''Greinnock'', and later as ''Greinok''. Old Presbyterial records used ''Grenok'', a common spelling until it was changed to Greenock around 1700. \n\nThe spelling ''Greenoak'' was found in two factory accounts dating back to 1717, and a legend developed of a green oak tree at the edge of the Clyde at William Street being used by fishermen to tie up their boats. No reliable source has been found referencing green oaks, however, and so this has been generally dismissed as imaginative Anglophone [[folk etymology]].

It reappeared in 1992 as the new shopping centre's name: ''The Oak Mall'', which uses a green tree as its logo. The name is also recalled in a local song (''The Green Oak Tree'').  Significantly, no green oak appears on the former burgh [[coat of arms]] which features the three chalices of the Shaw Stewarts, a sailing ship in full sail and two [[herring]] above the motto ''God Speed Greenock''.\n\n=== Early history: baronies and kirks ===\n[[File:Old West Kirk east 18.jpg|thumb|The [[Old West Kirk]] of 1591, much altered over the years, was moved in 1928 to a new location, again close to the [[Firth of Clyde]].]]\nHugh de Grenock was created a Scottish [[Baron]] in 1296, and the seat of the [[Scottish feudal barony|feudal barony]] of Greenock was apparently what became [[Easter Greenock Castle]]. Around 1400 his successor Malcolm Galbraith died with no sons, and his estate was divided between his two daughters to become two baronies: the eldest inherited Easter Greenock and married a Crawfurd, while [[Wester Greenock]] went to the younger daughter who married Schaw of Sauchie. Around 1540 the adjoining barony of [[Finnart]] was passed to the Schaw family, extending their holdings westward to the boundary of [[Gourock]], and in 1542 Sir John Schaw founded Wester Greenock castle.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1921|pp=4\u20135}}</ref><ref name=\"Sweet\">{{cite web | last=Sweet | first=Andy | title=Greenock Castle (site of) - Castle in Greenock, Renfrewshire | website=Stravaiging around Scotland | url=http://www.stravaiging.com/history/castle/wester-greenock-schaw | access-date=19 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Scottish Reformation]] of 1560 closed the chapels in the parish, and as the parish church was some {{convert|6|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} distant at [[Inverkip]] over a difficult route which was impassable in winter, in 1589 John Schaw obtained a charter from [[King James VI]] to build a kirk for the \"poor people upon his lands who were all fishers and of a reasonable number\". Later known as the Old Kirk or the [[Old West Kirk]], it was constructed on the west bank of the West Burn estuary and is reputed to have been the first [[Protestant]] church built in Scotland after the Reformation.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1921|pp=9, 86, 109}}<br />{{harvnb|Monteith|2004|p=3}}</ref>\n\n=== Fishing villages, harbours and shipbuilding ===\nThe coast of Greenock formed a broad bay with three smaller indentations: the Bay of Quick was known as a safe anchorage as far back as 1164. To its east, a sandy bay ran eastwards from the Old Kirk and the West Burn as far as Wester Greenock castle. The fishing village of Greenock developed along this bay, and around 1635 Sir John Schaw had a jetty built into the bay which became known as Sir John's Bay. In that year he obtained a Charter raising Greenock to a Burgh of Barony with rights to a weekly market. Further east, Saint Laurence Bay curved round past the Crawfurd Barony of Easter Greenock to Garvel (or Gravel) Point. When a pier (or dyke) was built making the bay an important harbour, the fishing village of Cartsburn gained the alternative name of Crawfurdsdyke. In 1642 it was made into the Burgh of Barony of Crawfurdsdyke, and part of the ill-fated [[Darien Scheme]] set out from this pier in 1697. This town was later renamed Cartsdyke.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1921|pp=6, 9, 64}}<br />{{harvnb|Brown|1905|p=4}}</ref>\n\nThe fishing trade grew prosperous, with barrels of salted [[herring]] exported widely, and shipping trade developed. As seagoing ships could not go further up the [[River Clyde]], the [[Glasgow]] merchants including the [[Tobacco Lords]] wanted harbour access but were in disputes with Greenock over harbour dues and warehouses. They tried to buy the Garvel estate for a harbour when Easter Greenock lands were put up for sale to meet debts, but were outbid by Sir John Schaw who then got a Crown Charter of 1670 uniting Easter and Wester Greenock into the Burgh Barony of Greenock. A separate [[Barony of Cartsburn]] was created, the first baron being Thomas Craufurd. In 1668 the City of Glasgow got the lease of {{convert|13|acre|ha|0|abbr=off}} of land upriver close to [[Newark Castle, Port Glasgow|Newark Castle]], and construction promptly started on [[Port Glasgow|Newport Glasgow]] harbour which by 1710 had the principal Clyde [[custom house]].<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1921|pp=6, 55, 85}}<br />{{harvnb|Monteith|2003|p=3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Greenock Gazeteer of Scotland.jpg|thumb|The harbour, c.&nbsp;1838]]\nIn 1696 and 1700 Schaw and residents of the town made unsuccessful bids to the Scottish Parliament for grants for a Greenock harbour, then when the [[Act of Union 1707]] opened up trade to the Americas and the associated slave trade with West Africa, they raised their own funds. The work was completed in 1710, with [[wharf|quays]] extended out into Sir John's Bay to enclose the harbour. In 1711 the shipbuilding industry was founded when [[Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Scotts]] leased ground between the harbour and the West Burn to build fishing boats. Greenock rapidly became a major port and shipbuilding centre, and though tobacco imported from the colonies was taken to Glasgow by pack horse, the more bulky imports of sugar were processed locally. From 1774 the dredging of the River Clyde increasingly allowed ships to take merchandise directly to Glasgow, but merchants continued to use Greenock harbour. The [[American Revolutionary War]] temporarily interrupted trade, and the gun battery of [[Fort Beauclerc]] near the West Burn was extended to guard against the threat of [[privateer]]s, but the emphasis shifted to wider markets including imports of [[rum]] and sugar from the [[Caribbean]], wines from Spain, and fish from North America. A [[whaling]] business operated for about 40 years.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1921|pp=6, 55, 85, 87, 94}}</ref> In 1868, in what became a ''[[cause celebre]]'',<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=B.|title=Popular Crime: Reflections on the Celebration of Violence|year=2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-1-41655-274-1|p=51}}</ref> seven young Greenock males [[Greenock stowaways|stowed away on a cargo ship]] bound for [[Quebec]].

Receipts rose rapidly with the expansion of colonial trade, and in 1778 the custom house moved to new built premises at the West Quay of the harbour.<ref name=\"customhouse\">{{harvnb|Monteith|2004|p=19}}</ref>\n\nBy 1791 a new pier was constructed at the East Quay. In 1812 Europe's first steamboat service was introduced by {{PS|Comet}} with frequent sailings between Glasgow, Greenock and [[Helensburgh]], and as trade built up the pier became known as Steamboat Quay. The custom house needed larger premises, and in May 1817 the foundation stone was laid at the quay for a Custom House building designed by [[William Burn]], which was completed in 1818. Its gracious [[neoclassical architecture]] features a Grecian [[Doric order|Doric]] [[portico]] looking out over the quayside, which was given the name Customhouse Quay.<ref name=\"customhouse\" /> In 1828 the Custom House was praised as \"a grand National Structure\" in \"the highest style of elegance\". By then there were scheduled steamboat sailings to [[Belfast]], [[Derry|Londonderry]], Liverpool, [[Inverness]], [[Campbeltown]], the [[Hebrides]] and \"all the principal places in the Highlands\".<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|1828|pp=172\u2013175}}</ref>\n\nThe Custom House underwent extensive refurbishment which was completed in 1989 and, until closure of the building in 2010, housed a customs and [[excise]] museum which was open to the public. In June 2008 [[HM Revenue and Customs]] (HMRC) announced that the building would close in 2011 as part of a rationalisation project with any jobs being transferred to offices in [[Glasgow]], and despite a campaign to oppose these plans, the building closed in August 2010.\n\nRiverside Inverclyde arranged further refurbishment works, and in 2013 announced that space had already been let to companies including [[PG Paper Company]] Ltd and [[Toshiba]] which had planning permission to form meeting rooms and an executive office in the building.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title       = Regeneration Projects Attracting Interest\n  | url         = http://www.inverclydenow.com/today/10801-regeneration-projects-attracting-interest\n  | publisher   = Inverclyde Now\n  | date        = 16 November 2013\n  | accessdate  = 10 December 2013\n  | url-status     = dead\n  | archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131212223938/http://www.inverclydenow.com/today/10801-regeneration-projects-attracting-interest\n  | archivedate = 12 December 2013\n  | df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web\n  | url         = http://www.heraldscotland.com/business/13774549.PG_Paper_moves_to_Greenock_s_Custom_House/\n  | title       = PG Paper moves to Greenock's Custom House\n  | website     = HeraldScotland\n  | language    = en\n  | access-date = 2017-02-06\n}}</ref> [[Greenock Telegraph]] estimated that \u00a34.1 million has been spent over 5-year period for the renovation works.<ref>{{Cite web\n  | url         = http://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk/news/14497370.__4m_Greenock_Custom_House_project_nears_an_end/\n  | title       = \u00a34m Greenock Custom House project nears an end\n  | website     = Greenock Telegraph\n  | language    = en\n  | access-date = 2017-02-06\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Industry and railways ===\n[[File:Cornalees 31806.jpg|thumb|''The Cut'' \u2013 visitor centre]]\n[[File:Greenock Cut 011006 nr Overton.jpg|thumb|''The Cut'' \u2013 [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]]]\n\nGreenock became a centre of industry, with water power being used to process imported goods. In 1827 [[Loch Thom]] was constructed as a reservoir with ''The Cut'' [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]], bringing water to two lines of falls for water mills to power a paper mill, cotton and woollen mills, sugar refineries and shipbuilding\n\n[[Greenock Central railway station]] at Cathcart Street opened in 1841, for the first time providing a fast route from Glasgow to the coast linking up with [[Clyde steamer]] services. The provision of this new line meant there was no need to take the steamer all the way down river from Glasgow. In 1869 the [[Caledonian Railway]] was bypassed by the rival [[Glasgow and South Western Railway]] which opened a station on the waterfront at Princes Pier, served by a tunnel under Greenock's west end. To regain custom, the Caledonian Railway extended (what is now known as the [[Inverclyde Line]]) the [[Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway]] west to Gourock; this line was built to run inland through deep cuttings and tunnels, with a tunnel under the whole length of Newton Street crossing under the other railway tunnel to emerge near [[Fort Matilda railway station]]. Spoil from the cuttings and tunnels was used to build an embankment out from the shore to a long timber wharf at [[Gourock railway station]], providing space for railway sidings.{{sfn|Montheith|2004|pp=40, 47, 84, 70, 94.}} The railway bought Wester Greenock castle and its extension, the Mansion House, and demolished them before constructing the tunnel immediately west of Greenock Central station, running under the castle grounds which now form Well Park.<ref name=\"Sweet\" />\n\n=== Victoria Tower ===\n[[File:Greenock muni blgs2.jpg|thumb|upright|View from above Cathcart Street over Cathcart Square to the Municipal Buildings, with the Victoria Tower to the right of \"Cowan's Corner\", and the ''Mid Kirk'' spire of 1781 to the left.]]\nGreenock's increasing importance and wealth was manifested in the construction of the [[Italianate]] Municipal Buildings, whose Victoria Tower, completed in 1886, stands {{convert|245|ft|m|abbr=off}} tall.<ref name=\"ArtStrachan2008\">{{cite book\n  | author1   = Sphinx Fine Art\n  | author2   = Edward Strachan\n  | author3   = Roy Bolton\n  | title     = Russia & Europe in the Nineteenth Century\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/books?id=vnf_0IVt1GgC&pg=PA30\n  | year      = 2008\n  | publisher = Sphinx Fine Art\n  | isbn      = 978-1-907200-02-1\n  | pages     = 30\u2013\n}}</ref> Begun five years previously in a competition won by architects [[H & D Barclay]], it exceeds the height of the tower of [[Glasgow City Chambers]] by more than a metre. The Municipal Buildings were bombed during World War 2 and what is known as Cowans Corner on the southern elevation of the building was destroyed beyond repair and remains like so today.\n\nCowan's Corner is named so after the story of how an obstinate shop owner took on the town council and thwarted its plans for the construction of the Municipal Buildings. In the 1850s, the council started buying up all the property on the projected Municipal Building site, but the council did not anticipate it would run into problems when attempting to negotiate with a certain Robert Cowan, one of the owners of the firm of Cowan & Lawrie that operated a shop on a corner site in Cathcart Square. The council made every effort to reach a compromise but Robert refused to sell his property. Only when the plans were altered, owing to the fact the corner site could not be acquired, was Greenock's famous landmark \u2014 the Victoria Tower \u2014 designed.\n\nWork started on the Municipal Buildings in 1881 and was completed in 1886. The total cost was \u00a3197,061 \u2014 a colossal amount then \u2014 and it left the town with a debt not finally cleared until 1952. After the buildings were finished, further legal proceedings started and a court decision meant Robert Cowan had to move. He opened new premises at the corner of Westburn Street and West Blackhall Street. The property at the corner of the square was destroyed during the Blitz of 1941.\n\nDespite Robert Cowan being forced out, it would appear the council could not proceed with any plans it had for the site prior to the Blitz. A 1957 Telegraph story stated that only a few years earlier had Greenock Corporation managed to negotiate its purchase due to conflicting claims by descendants of the original owners. The article said that it had been suggested the corporation might finally be able to complete the Municipal Buildings to approximately the original designs. Cowan's Corner remains vacant but is a landscaped area with seating.\n\n=== Villas ===\nFurther evidence of this wealth can be seen in the large villas of Greenock's west end, one time home to the ship owners, industrialists and investors. The area is fronted by the mile long (1.6&nbsp;km) sweep of the Esplanade with its views across the Clyde to [[Kilcreggan]] which almost convinces the visitor that no heavy industry could have been anywhere nearby.\n\n=== Battery Park and torpedoes ===\nThe [[War of 1812]] reawakened fears of American raids against Britain's ports. Earlier gun batteries had been dismantled and in 1813 ground was granted for a battery at Whitefarland Point. [[Fort Matilda]] was completed in 1818 and was sporadically modified over the century. The land to the west of this was common ground for inhabitants of the town, but in 1907 the [[Admiralty]] compulsorily purchased part of this land for a torpedo factory. The remaining space was handed over to Greenock Corporation in 1914 as a public park.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1921|pp=148, 168\u2013169}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Clyde Torpedo Factory'' opened in 1910, with 700 workers transferred from the [[Royal Arsenal]], [[Woolwich]]. The site was tasked with designing and testing of [[torpedoes]], the testing taking place in [[Loch Long]]. During the [[Second World War]] the site switched entirely to manufacturing torpedoes. The original gun battery site was occupied by the ''Navy Buildings'', the main offices, just to the east of the torpedo factory buildings.\nFollowing WW2, in 1947,<ref>{{cite web\n  | url       = http://www.secretscotland.org.uk/index.php/Secrets/RoyalNavalTorpedoFactories\n  | title     = Secret Scotland \u2013 Royal Naval Torpedo Factories\n  | publisher =\n}}</ref>  the site became fully committed to R&D as the Torpedo Experimental Establishment (TEE).  TEE was closed in 1959, when all torpedo research, development and design were concentrated at the newly formed Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment (AUWE), Portland.<ref>I worked there 1957\u201359</ref>\n\n=== Old West Kirk ===\n[[File:Old West Kirk Farmer's Loft.jpg|thumb|left|The Old West Kirk features a scale model of a 20-gun frigate above its Sailor's loft: the Laird's Gallery is on the right.]]\nA church which became known as the [[Old West Kirk]] had been established in Greenock in 1591 under the patronage of [[John Schaw]], the first built in Scotland since the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]]. It was extended over the years, at an early stage the Schaw aisle provided pews for the Laird of the Barony, built as a gallery to the east of the nave of the church. Opposite it, above the front entrance, is the Crawfurdsburn or Choir Gallery. At the south end of the nave, the Sailor's Loft gallery was built in 1698 and features a 19th-century model frigate, which replaced earlier models. At the north end, the Farmer's Gallery is above the main seating area. A tower was added in the mid 19th century.\n\nIn 1926, to make way for expansion of the [[Harland & Wolff]] shipyard (the present-day location of Container Way), the Old West Kirk was relocated to a new site on the Esplanade where it still stands. The shipbuilders provided the Pirrie Hall to the south of the site: this was opened in February 1925, just after the old church closed for work to commence, and was used during the works to accommodate services, enabling the congregation to see progress on the rebuilt kirk. It then came into use as the church hall.\n\nThe church is notable for [[stained glass]] by artists such as [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and Sir [[Edward Burne-Jones]]. The Church has a website.<ref>{{cite web\n  | url        = http://www.lylekirk.org/owk%20web2/Page0.html\n  | title      = Welcome To The Old West Kirk,Greenock\n  | publisher  = Lyle Kirk\n  | accessdate = 2016-09-15\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Second World War ===\n[[File:Free French Memorial Greenock.jpg|thumb|right|[[Free French Forces|Free French]] Memorial on [[Lyle Hill]] overlooking Gourock]]\n[[File:James Watt Memorial College.jpg|thumb|upright|The original [[James Watt Memorial College]] building]]\n[[File:Greenock Town hall.jpg|thumb|right|Greenock Town Hall]]\n\nGreenock suffered badly during the [[Second World War]] and its anchorage at the [[Tail of the Bank]] became the base for the [[Home Fleet]] as well as the main assembly point for [[Atlantic]] convoys. On 30 April 1940 the French [[Vauquelin class destroyer]] ''[[French destroyer Maill\u00e9 Br\u00e9z\u00e9 (1931)|Maill\u00e9 Br\u00e9z\u00e9]]'' blew up off Greenock with heavy loss of life following an accident involving two of her own torpedoes. Although this disaster occurred before the [[Free French Forces#Cross of Lorraine|Free French]] Naval Forces were established, many people tend to regard the [[Cross of Lorraine]] on [[Lyle Hill]] as a memorial to the loss of the ''Maill\u00e9 Br\u00e9z\u00e9'' as well as to the later losses of the [[Free French Naval Forces]] which sailed from the town. On the nights of 6 May and 7 May 1941 around 300 [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft attacked the town in the [[Greenock Blitz]].\n\nOn 10 October 1940, [[RAF Greenock]] was created as a maintenance base for RAF flying boats. The base was hit on 7 May 1941 during the Greenock Blitz.<ref>http://www.abct.org.uk/airfields/airfield-finder/greenock/</ref>\n\nA large building housing a drapery business constructed on Cowan's property at the corner of the Municipal Buildings was badly damaged and was demolished, leaving the blank brick corner area still known as \"Cowan's Corner\". This was later set as a garden for the blind.\n\nThe original blank brick of Cowans Corner was covered in 2008 as part of the continuing work to improve the look of the town centre.\n\n=== Postwar years ===\nGreenock thrived in the post-war years but as the heavy industries declined in the 1970s and 1980s unemployment became a major problem, and it has only been in the last ten years with reinvestment and the redevelopment of large sections of the town that the local economy has started to revive. Tourism has appeared as an unexpected bonus with the development of the Clydeport Container Terminal as Ocean Terminal, a [[passenger terminal (maritime)|passenger terminal]] for cruise ships crossing the Atlantic. Students who do not travel further afield for study often attend the Greenock campus of West College (formerly known as [[James Watt College]] of Further and Higher Education).\n\nGreenock reached its population peak in 1921 (81,123) and was once the sixth largest town in Scotland.\n\n== Governance ==\n{{Main|Greenock (UK Parliament constituency)}}\n\nUntil 1974, Greenock was a [[parliamentary burgh]] in its own right. It was merged with Port Glasgow to form [[Greenock and Port Glasgow (UK Parliament constituency)|Greenock and Port Glasgow]] constituency. In 1997, it became [[Greenock and Inverclyde (UK Parliament constituency)|Greenock and Inverclyde]]. After the redistribution of Scottish seats, it was merged into an enlarged ''[[Inverclyde (UK Parliament constituency)|Inverclyde]]'' constituency \u2013 the first time in political history that Greenock has not been named in a parliamentary seat. ''[[Greenock and Inverclyde (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Greenock and Inverclyde]]'' remains a [[Scottish Parliament]] constituency.\n\n== Health ==\nThe [[Inverclyde Royal Hospital]] is located in Greenock serving the population of [[Inverclyde]], [[Largs]], the [[Isle of Bute]] and the [[Cowal]] Peninsula.<ref>{{cite web\n  | url        = http://www.nhsggc.org.uk/content/default.asp?page=s762&loc_id=2528\n  | publisher  = NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde\n  | title      = Inverclyde Royal Hospital\n  | accessdate = 2010-05-07\n}}</ref> \n\nLanghill Clinic situated behind Inverclyde Royal Hospital is now the main psychiatric hospital with an IPCU unit and [[Day hospital]] alongside the main psychiatric ward.\n\n== Geography ==\n=== Areas and suburbs ===\n[[File:View of Greenock from Auchmountain Road (Inverclyde, Scotland, DSCF9281).jpg|thumb|View of Greenock from Auchmountain Road]]\n[[Arran View, Greenock|Arran View]], [[Bogston railway station|Bogston]], [[Bow Farm, Greenock|Bow Farm]], [[Braeside, Greenock|Braeside]], [[Branchton, Greenock|Branchton]], [[Bridgend, Greenock|Bridgend]], [[Broomhill, Greenock|Broomhill]], [[Barony of Cartsburn|Cartsburn]], [[Cornhaddock, Greenock|Cornhaddock]], [[Fancy Farm, Greenock|Fancy Farm]], [[Fort Matilda railway station|Fort Matilda]], [[Gibshill]], [[Greenock West, Greenock|Greenock West]], [[Grieve hill , Greenock|Grieve Hill]], [[Hole Farm, Greenock|Hole Farm]], [[Larkfield, Greenock|Larkfield]], [[Lyle Hill, Greenock|Lyle Hill]], [[Lynedoch Street, Grenock|Lynedoch]], [[Overton, Greenock|Overton]], [[Pennyfern, Greenock|Pennyfern]], [[Strone, Greenock|Strone]], [[Strone Farm, Greenock|Strone Farm]] and [[Whinhill railway station|Whinhill]].

More recently the town relied heavily on [[electronics]] manufacture. However, this has given way mostly to: [[call centre]] business, insurance, banking and shipping export.\n\nThe Fleming and Reid merino wool mill employed 500 people \u2013 mostly women and produced wool garments spun and woven at the mill. This mill was at the corner of Drumfrochar Road and Mill Road.\n\nAs of October 2012 Greenock has an unemployment rate of 5.3%, above the Scottish average of 3.9% (figure is for the [[Scottish Parliament]] [[Greenock and Inverclyde (Scottish Parliament constituency)|constituency]] and includes [[Gourock]], [[Inverkip]], [[Port Glasgow]] and [[Wemyss Bay]]).<ref>{{cite web\n  | url        = https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/wpca/1929380450/report.aspx#tabwab\n  | title      = nomis \u2013 official labour market statistics\n  | publisher  = Nomisweb.co.uk\n  | date       = 30 September 2010\n  | accessdate = 2013-01-26\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Shipbuilding ===\n[[File:Greenock waterfront.jpg|thumb|right|Greenock waterfront from Victoria Harbour to Ocean Terminal, the skyline dominated by Victoria Tower.]]\n[[File:Greenock Central 190906b.jpg|thumb|right|[[Greenock Central railway station|Greenock Central]]]]\n[[File:Finnarrow at Inchgreen Drydock 02.jpg|thumb|right|The Inchgreen [[Dry dock|Drydock]] lacked major repair work for almost a decade, then in March 2013 it was used for urgent repairs to the ro-ro [[Stena Line]] ferry ''Finnarrow''.]]\n[[File:Inchgreen Drydock and repair quay,.jpg|thumb|View looking north over the Inchgreen Drydock and repair quay, with the Greenock Great Harbour to the left, after the announcement that the dry dock cranes are to be demolished.]]\n\nIn the early 17th century, the first [[pier]] was built in Greenock. Shipbuilding was already an important employer by this time. The first proper [[harbour]] was constructed in 1710 and the first well-known shipbuilders, [[Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company]], was established the following year. It was the oldest shipbuilding business in the world {{citation needed|date=October 2016}} and gained numerous contracts with the [[Royal Navy]] from 1806, building ships such as ''[[HMS Glasgow (C21)|Glasgow]]''.\n\nIn 1967 Scott's was merged with [[Lithgows]] (founded 1874, later the largest privately owned yard in the world) the same year becoming [[Scott Lithgow]], which was later nationalised as part of [[British Shipbuilders]] in 1977. From 1800 to 1980 many thousands of people worked to design, build and repair ships. The reduction in shipbuilding in the 1970s and 1980s meant that none of these companies are still trading.\n\nGreenock Shipbuilders included: Scotts, Browns, William Lithgows, Fergusons, Head the Boat Builder (lifeboats). Other marine engineering related companies included engine-makers \u2013 Kincaids, Scotts, Rankin and Blackmore (which included the Eagle Foundry) \u2013 ship repair (Lamonts) and Hasties for steering gear. Yacht builders included Adams and McLean (at Cardwell Bay). Other yards included Cartsburn, Cartsdyke, and Klondyke \u2013 all of which closed during the 1970s and 1980s due to competition from [[South Korea]] and Japan.\n\nPart of the site of the ''Scott's'' yard, is now an [[EE (telecommunications company)|EE]] call centre, and the Kingston Yard was redeveloped for housing. Shipbuilding is now continued at [[Ferguson Marine Engineering]] in nearby [[Port Glasgow]], after Ferguson Shipbuilders was taken over by [[Jim McColl]] and began modernisation.\nShip repair work continues at the Garvel Drydock in Greenock's Great Harbour.\n\nThe Inchgreen Drydock was opened in 1964 as one of the largest in the world at 305&nbsp;m long and 48&nbsp;m wide.

The same terminal is a regular port of call for [[cruise liner]]s visiting the west of Scotland.\n\nGreenock was a regular port of call for Cunard Line and Canadian Pacific in the 1950s and 1960s. Ships on the Montreal to Liverpool transit would anchor at the Tail of the Bank off Greenock in the Firth of Clyde and steam paddlewheel ferries would service the liners. Cunard operated: the RMS Ivernia (1954), RMS Saxonia (1955), RMS Carinthia (1956) and RMS Sylvania (1957). These four ships were built at John Brown & Company shipyards, typically 22,000 tons, twin screw, 600 passengers. CP operated the Empress of Britain (1956), Empress of Canada and Empress of England.\n\nGreenock's Great Harbour is one of the three main ports providing marine services support to the Royal Navy, in dual site operation with [[Faslane]] at [[HMNB Clyde]] on the [[Gare Loch]]. 240 staff of the former [[Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service]] were transferred to [[Serco Denholm]] under a 15-year \u00a31bn PFI contract awarded in December 2007.<ref>{{cite web\n  | url         = http://www.serco.com/media/market/defencenews/marineservicescontract.asp\n  | title       = Signing of Marine Services Contract\n  | publisher   = Serco Group plc\n  | date        = 14 December 2007\n  | accessdate  = 2010-05-07\n  | url-status     = dead\n  | archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719040924/http://www.serco.com/media/market/defencenews/marineservicescontract.asp\n  | archivedate = 19 July 2011\n  | df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> This facility means that \"Admiralty\" boats and tugs are a common sight on the Clyde.\n\nGreenock's attractive esplanade provides a gently curving riverside walk just over a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) long extending to the west from ''Ocean Terminal'' to the ''Royal West of Scotland Amateur Boat Club'' sailing, kayaking and rowing facilities, which originated as a rowing club built against the east wall of [[Fort Matilda]] in 1866, and was granted its present title in 1885. The present clubhouse dates from 1878, and was subsequently extended.<ref>[https://www.inverclyde.gov.uk/assets/attach/4612/West%20of%20Scotland%20Boat%20Club%20Jubilee%201926%20Web%20CS63-1-1.pdf Royal West of Scotland Amateur Boat Club Jubilee 1926 CS63-1-1], from {{cite web | title=Local History Downloads | website=Inverclyde Council | date=2016 | url=https://www.inverclyde.gov.uk/community-life-and-leisure/heritage/local-history-downloads | access-date=20 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nFort Matilda was adapted for various purposes, eventually becoming the ''Navy Buildings'' which housed a main [[Her Majesty's Coastguard]] centre until it closed in December 2012, as well as a [[Royal Naval Reserve]] establishment, [[HMS Dalriada]]. The buildings have now been demolished, as a site for blocks of flats off Eldon Street.\n\n=== Sugar ===\nSugar refining began in Greenock in 1765.<ref name=brit11>{{cite EB1911\n  | wstitle = Greenock\n  | volume  = 12\n  | pages   = 548\u2013549\n}}</ref> John Walker began a sugar refinery in Greenock in 1850 followed by the prominent local [[cooper (profession)|cooper]] and shipowner [[Abram Lyle]] who, with four partners, purchased the ''Glebe Sugar Refinery'' in 1865. Another 12 refineries were active at one point. The most successful of these was [[Tate & Lyle]]. It was formed from a merger in 1921 between Abram Lyle, who had expanded into [[Plaistow, Newham|Plaistow]], and [[Henry Tate]], who had set up a sugar refinery in [[Liverpool]] and had expanded into [[London]].\n[[File:Sugar Warehouse.jpg|thumb|The Sugar Shed dominates the James Watt Dock]]\n\nThe James Watt Dock, opened in 1886, provided shipping and shipbuilding facilities including a large warehouse (known as the Sugar Shed) which was used for both imported raw sugar, and refined sugar ready for delivery.<ref name=\"JWD hist\">{{cite web | author=JWDAdministrator | title=JWD History | website=James Watt Dock Marina, Greenock, Scotland | url=http://www.jameswattdockmarina.co.uk/jwd-history.html | access-date=11 February 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180212083252/http://www.jameswattdockmarina.co.uk/jwd-history.html | archive-date=12 February 2018 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Canmore JWD\">{{cite web | title=Greenock, James Watt Dock | website=Canmore | url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/68371/greenock-james-watt-dock | access-date=11 February 2018}}</ref>\nBy the end of the 19th century, around 400 ships a year were transporting sugar from Caribbean holdings to Greenock for processing. There were 14 sugar refineries, including The Westburn, Walkers, The Glebe, Lochore and Ferguson and Dempster, plus a sugar beet factory on Ingleston Street. Tobacco from the Americas also arrived here.\n\nWhen Tate and Lyle finally closed its Greenock refinery in 1997 it brought to an end the town's 150-year-old connections with sugar manufacture. A newly built sugar warehouse continued shipping operations at Greenock's ''Ocean Terminal''. The former sugar warehouse at the James Watt Dock was by then scheduled as a category A [[listed building]] as a fine example of early industrial architecture, with an unusual feature of a [[colonnade]] of cast iron columns forming a sheltered unloading area next to the [[quay]]side. This building has since lain empty, with various schemes being proposed for conversion and restoration. The photographs show the building still intact in February 2006, but a fire on the evening of 12 June 2006 caused severe damage to much of the building before being brought under control in the early hours of 13 June. The local council confirmed that parts of the building will have to be taken down to ensure public safety, but promised an investigation and emphasised the importance of this world heritage building.<ref>{{cite web\n  | url         = http://www.inverclydenow.com/ShowGallery.asp?ID=249\n  | title       = Picture Gallery\n  | url-status     = dead\n  | archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20061026085138/http://www.inverclydenow.com/ShowGallery.asp?ID=249\n  | archivedate = 26 October 2006\n  | df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, approval was given to proposals for a major regeneration project.<ref>{{cite web\n  | url         = http://www.inverclyde.gov.uk/news/2010/jan/163-180-million-regeneration-project-approved/\n  | title       = \u00a3180 million Regeneration Project Approved\n  | publisher   = Inverclyde Council\n  | date        = 7 January 2010\n  | accessdate  = 20 February 2010\n  | url-status     = dead\n  | archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130919190850/http://www.inverclyde.gov.uk/news/2010/jan/163-180-million-regeneration-project-approved/\n  | archivedate = 19 September 2013\n  | df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> As of 2018, the building and adjacent area of the dock accommodated a [[marina]].<ref name=\"JWD hist\" />\n\n=== Electronics ===\nSince [[IBM]] arrived in the town in 1951, electronics and light manufacturing have, until recently, been the mainstay of local employment. [[Texas Instruments]] (Formerly [[National Semiconductor]]) has run a [[silicon]] wafer manufacturing plant in the town since 1970.\n\nHowever, with manufacturing moving to Eastern Europe and Asia, work has shifted to the [[service sector]], especially call centres. EE and IBM both have major call centre operations in Greenock, while the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] Mortgage Centre processes Mortgage applications from throughout the UK & Ireland.\n\nIBM closed their entire factory in Greenock which is in the process of being demolished. [[Sanmina]], another electronics company, took over much of the IBM installation but moved 370 jobs to [[Hungary]] in 2006.<ref>{{citation\n  | title       = Workers' disgust at Hungary move\n  | journal     = Greenock Telegraph\n  | date        = 15 February 2006\n  | url         = http://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk/news/roundup/articles/2006/02/16/6819-workers034-disgust-at-hungary-move/\n  | accessdate  = 2010-05-07\n  | url-status     = dead\n  | archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120227192955/http://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk/news/roundup/articles/2006/02/16/6819-workers034-disgust-at-hungary-move/\n  | archivedate = 27 February 2012\n  | df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> The Sanmina plant, which consisted of the former IBM AMDC (Automated Materials Distribution Centre) and Modules buildings 1 to 5, has since ceased operation and was demolished in 2009. The [[Spango Valley]] site was rebranded as \"Valley Park\" in late 2009.\n\nLenovo has also re-located away from Greenock, and the plant is now at 10% of the 1999/2000 capacity.\n\n=== Trade and commerce ===\nGreenock's main shopping thoroughfare was Hamilton Street, which connected West Blackhall Street in the west to Clyde Square in the east. In 1975 it disappeared, along with several other central streets, as the area was [[pedestrianised]] as Hamilton Way. In 1992 it was covered and enclosed as an 85-unit centre by Covell Matthews for then-clients Ossory Road Estates as ''The Oak Mall'' (in administration as of 21 November 2013).<ref>{{cite web\n  | url   = http://www.insolventcompanies.co.uk/oak-mall-greenock-limited-04384548/\n  | title = OAK MALL GREENOCK LIMITED [04384548]\n  | work  = Insolvent, Winding Up, Bankrupt & Administration Information\n}}</ref> It has since been supplanted as Inverclyde's main shopping area by the retail park at Port Glasgow. Occupants of the mall now include [[Boots Group|Boots]], [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]], [[The Body Shop]], [[C. & J. Clark|Clarks]] and [[New Look (store)|New Look]]. [[Marks and Spencer]] was in its original building (of 1936) which was simply built round during the first phase of pedestrianisation, where it remained until the store moved to a new unit at Port Glasgow.<ref>''Greenock from Old Photographs'', 1984</ref> [[Tesco]] and [[Morrisons]] also have a presence in the town. A small retail estate is opposite the ''Waterfront'' swimming pool and leisure centre. Elsewhere, small groups of shops in most of the areas of the town provide for day-to-day needs. The town contains one diplomatic mission, an Italian consulate.\n\n== Transport ==\nGreenock's most significant transportation connection is the Container Terminal (see above).\n\nGreenock is Scotland's best served town in terms of railway stations. It boasts eight: [[Bogston railway station|Bogston]], [[Cartsdyke railway station|Cartsdyke]], [[Greenock Central railway station|Greenock Central]], [[Greenock West railway station|Greenock West]], [[Fort Matilda railway station|Fort Matilda]], [[Whinhill railway station|Whinhill]], [[Drumfrochar railway station|Drumfrochar]] and [[Branchton railway station|Branchton]]. A ninth station, located at the [[IBM railway station|former IBM complex]], is currently mothballed pending redevelopment of the site. Only Glasgow has a much greater number of stations and Edinburgh possesses only two more. Greenock has the longest bored railway tunnel in Scotland{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} at {{convert|1.2|mi|km}} in length. Located directly under Newton Street in the town, the tunnel allowed for the extension of the railway to [[Gourock]].\n\nGreenock is served by a number of local bus routes covering the majority of Greenock, Gourock and Port Glasgow. Long distance services travel regularly to Glasgow, Largs and Dunoon. The majority of routes are run by [[McGill's Bus Services]]. The Largs to Glasgow corridor is served by two services, the 901, 906, which provide a bus along this route every 15 minutes for most of the day. The 531 service also offers travel from Greenock to Glasgow, serving the Slaemuir area of Port Glasgow before connecting with the X7 Service and continuing through Bridge of Weir, Houston and Linwood, then joining the motorway to Braehead before heading into Glasgow City Centre.\n\nGreenock is located at the end of the [[A8 road (Great Britain)|A8 road]]/[[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8 motorway]] which begins in [[Edinburgh]]. It is also the northern terminus of [[Euroroute]] [[European route E05|E05]] which heads south through England, France and Spain, ending at the Spanish port and container terminal of [[Algeciras]].\n\n== Culture ==\nGreenock is one of the settings for [[Alan Sharp]]'s 1965 novel ''A Green Tree in Gedde''. It is fictionalised as 'Gantock' by [[Robin Jenkins]] in his 1979 novel ''Fergus Lamont'' (The Gantocks are a rocky [[shoal]] in the [[Firth of Clyde]] nearby, just off [[Dunoon]]). [[Alasdair Gray]]'s 1984 novel ''[[1982, Janine]]'' is set in a Greenock hotel room. [[Matthew Fitt]]'s [[cyberpunk]] novel ''[[But'n'Ben A-Go-Go]]'' features a submerged Greenock after the effects of [[global warming]]. Greenock has featured in the poetry of W.S. Graham (evoking his childhood) and [[Douglas Dunn]].\n\nGreenock is home to the world's first [[Burns Supper|Burns Club]], [[The Mother Club]], which was founded in 1801 by merchants born in [[Ayrshire]], some of whom had known Robert Burns. They held the first Burns Supper on what they thought was his birthday on 29 January 1802, but in 1803 discovered from the Ayr parish records that the correct date was 25 January 1759.<ref>{{cite web\n  | url         = http://www.worldburnsclub.com/newsletter/0107/greenock_burns_club.htm\n  | title       = Congratulation Greenock Burns Club\n  | publisher   = The Robert Burns World Federation Limited\n  | accessdate  = 2010-01-18\n  | url-status     = dead\n  | archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100126011456/http://www.worldburnsclub.com/newsletter/0107/greenock_burns_club.htm\n  | archivedate = 26 January 2010\n  | df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Victorian era|Victorian]] landscape artist [[John Atkinson Grimshaw]] depicted a somewhat idealised Greenock in several of his paintings.\n\nThe [[Mclean Museum]] is the largest museum in the Inverclyde area, featuring exhibitions on [[James Watt]] and a collection of [[Ancient Egyptian]] artefacts.\n\n[[File:Beacon Arts Centre & clock tower w.jpg|thumb|The Beacon Arts Centre, with the Gallery Suite and caf\u00e9 / bistro looking out over the Custom House Quay waterfront and the Clyde.]]\nThe [[Greenock Arts Guild]]'s ''Beacon Arts Centre'' (replacing the former ''Arts Guild Theatre'') opened in 2013 in a new building at Greenock's Custom House Quay.

Its location means that the heat retentive properties of seawater help keep winter temperatures higher. Additionally, the effect of the [[Gulf Stream]] on the Clyde helps Greenock's average temperature stay approximately one degree above that of eastern coastal towns on the same [[latitude]]. Indeed, Greenock's latitude (55.94 degrees north with a longitude of 4.75 degrees west) places it at the same latitude as the Moscow area. The warming effect of the Gulf Stream however, keeps the winter weather in Greenock much milder than that of [[Moscow]].\n\nGreenock anecdotally has the reputation for having higher than average rainfall (the song ''The Green Oak Tree'' comments on this) but this is not statistically true; northwest of Fort William has the highest average rainfall in Scotland.<ref>{{cite web\n  | url         = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/ns/\n  | title       = Northern Scotland: climate\n  | publisher   = Met Office\n  | accessdate  = 2010-05-07\n  | url-status     = dead\n  | archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110813193523/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/ns/\n  | archivedate = 13 August 2011\n  | df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> Greenock's location gives long hours of [[daylight]] in [[midsummer]] with the opposite true in [[winter solstice|midwinter]].

It forms part of a contiguous urban area with [[Gourock]] to the west and [[Port Glasgow]] to the east.\n\nThe [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 UK Census]] showed that Greenock had a population of 44,248, a decrease from the 46,861 recorded in the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 UK Census]]. It lies on the south bank of the Clyde at the \"[[Tail of the Bank]]\" where the [[River Clyde]] expands into the [[Firth of Clyde]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Name ===\nPlace-name scholar [[William J. Watson]] wrote that \"Greenock is well known in Gaelic as Grian\u00e1ig, dative of grian\u00e1g, a sunny knoll\".<ref>W. J. Watson, ''The History of the Celtic Place-Names of Scotland'' (Edinburgh, 1926), p. 201.</ref> The [[Scottish Gaelic]] place-name ''Grianaig'' is relatively common, with another (Greenock) near [[Callander]] in [[Menteith]] (formerly in Perthshire) and yet another at [[Muirkirk]] in [[Kyle, Ayrshire|Kyle]], now in [[East Ayrshire]].<ref>Watson, ''The History of the Celtic Place-Names of Scotland'', p. 201.</ref> Local writer R. M. Smith (1921) described the alternative derivation from [[Common Brittonic]] *''Graenag'', a \"gravelly\" or \"sandy place\", as more appropriate, accurately describing the original foreshore.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1921|pp=8\u20139}}</ref> Johnston (1934) notes that \"some Gaels call the seaport Gh\u00f3nait\", and that a possible derivation may be ''greannach'', meaning \"rough, gravelly\".<ref>Johnston, J.B. (1934) ''Place-names of Scotland\", John Murray, p. 197</ref> \n\nThe name of the town has had various spellings over time. It was printed in early Acts of Parliament as ''Grinok'', ''Greenhok'', ''Grinock'', ''Greenhoke'', ''Greinnock'', and later as ''Greinok''. Old Presbyterial records used ''Grenok'', a common spelling until it was changed to Greenock around 1700. \n\nThe spelling ''Greenoak'' was found in two factory accounts dating back to 1717, and a legend developed of a green oak tree at the edge of the Clyde at William Street being used by fishermen to tie up their boats. No reliable source has been found referencing green oaks, however, and so this has been generally dismissed as imaginative Anglophone [[folk etymology]]. Nonetheless the image has frequently been used as an emblem or logo, carved on public buildings, used on banners and badges,<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1921|p=9}}</ref> and was once emblazoned on the local [[Co-op UK|Co-operative Society]] emblem. It reappeared in 1992 as the new shopping centre's name: ''The Oak Mall'', which uses a green tree as its logo. The name is also recalled in a local song (''The Green Oak Tree'').  Significantly, no green oak appears on the former burgh [[coat of arms]] which features the three chalices of the Shaw Stewarts, a sailing ship in full sail and two [[herring]] above the motto ''God Speed Greenock''.\n\n=== Early history: baronies and kirks ===\n[[File:Old West Kirk east 18.jpg|thumb|The [[Old West Kirk]] of 1591, much altered over the years, was moved in 1928 to a new location, again close to the [[Firth of Clyde]].]]\nHugh de Grenock was created a Scottish [[Baron]] in 1296, and the seat of the [[Scottish feudal barony|feudal barony]] of Greenock was apparently what became [[Easter Greenock Castle]]. Around 1400 his successor Malcolm Galbraith died with no sons, and his estate was divided between his two daughters to become two baronies: the eldest inherited Easter Greenock and married a Crawfurd, while [[Wester Greenock]] went to the younger daughter who married Schaw of Sauchie. Around 1540 the adjoining barony of [[Finnart]] was passed to the Schaw family, extending their holdings westward to the boundary of [[Gourock]], and in 1542 Sir John Schaw founded Wester Greenock castle.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1921|pp=4\u20135}}</ref><ref name=\"Sweet\">{{cite web | last=Sweet | first=Andy | title=Greenock Castle (site of) - Castle in Greenock, Renfrewshire | website=Stravaiging around Scotland | url=http://www.stravaiging.com/history/castle/wester-greenock-schaw | access-date=19 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Scottish Reformation]] of 1560 closed the chapels in the parish, and as the parish church was some {{convert|6|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} distant at [[Inverkip]] over a difficult route which was impassable in winter, in 1589 John Schaw obtained a charter from [[King James VI]] to build a kirk for the \"poor people upon his lands who were all fishers and of a reasonable number\". Later known as the Old Kirk or the [[Old West Kirk]], it was constructed on the west bank of the West Burn estuary and is reputed to have been the first [[Protestant]] church built in Scotland after the Reformation.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1921|pp=9, 86, 109}}<br />{{harvnb|Monteith|2004|p=3}}</ref>\n\n=== Fishing villages, harbours and shipbuilding ===\nThe coast of Greenock formed a broad bay with three smaller indentations: the Bay of Quick was known as a safe anchorage as far back as 1164. To its east, a sandy bay ran eastwards from the Old Kirk and the West Burn as far as Wester Greenock castle. The fishing village of Greenock developed along this bay, and around 1635 Sir John Schaw had a jetty built into the bay which became known as Sir John's Bay. In that year he obtained a Charter raising Greenock to a Burgh of Barony with rights to a weekly market. Further east, Saint Laurence Bay curved round past the Crawfurd Barony of Easter Greenock to Garvel (or Gravel) Point. When a pier (or dyke) was built making the bay an important harbour, the fishing village of Cartsburn gained the alternative name of Crawfurdsdyke. In 1642 it was made into the Burgh of Barony of Crawfurdsdyke, and part of the ill-fated [[Darien Scheme]] set out from this pier in 1697. This town was later renamed Cartsdyke.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1921|pp=6, 9, 64}}<br />{{harvnb|Brown|1905|p=4}}</ref>\n\nThe fishing trade grew prosperous, with barrels of salted [[herring]] exported widely, and shipping trade developed. As seagoing ships could not go further up the [[River Clyde]], the [[Glasgow]] merchants including the [[Tobacco Lords]] wanted harbour access but were in disputes with Greenock over harbour dues and warehouses. They tried to buy the Garvel estate for a harbour when Easter Greenock lands were put up for sale to meet debts, but were outbid by Sir John Schaw who then got a Crown Charter of 1670 uniting Easter and Wester Greenock into the Burgh Barony of Greenock. A separate [[Barony of Cartsburn]] was created, the first baron being Thomas Craufurd. In 1668 the City of Glasgow got the lease of {{convert|13|acre|ha|0|abbr=off}} of land upriver close to [[Newark Castle, Port Glasgow|Newark Castle]], and construction promptly started on [[Port Glasgow|Newport Glasgow]] harbour which by 1710 had the principal Clyde [[custom house]].<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1921|pp=6, 55, 85}}<br />{{harvnb|Monteith|2003|p=3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Greenock Gazeteer of Scotland.jpg|thumb|The harbour, c.&nbsp;1838]]\nIn 1696 and 1700 Schaw and residents of the town made unsuccessful bids to the Scottish Parliament for grants for a Greenock harbour, then when the [[Act of Union 1707]] opened up trade to the Americas and the associated slave trade with West Africa, they raised their own funds. The work was completed in 1710, with [[wharf|quays]] extended out into Sir John's Bay to enclose the harbour. In 1711 the shipbuilding industry was founded when [[Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Scotts]] leased ground between the harbour and the West Burn to build fishing boats. Greenock rapidly became a major port and shipbuilding centre, and though tobacco imported from the colonies was taken to Glasgow by pack horse, the more bulky imports of sugar were processed locally. From 1774 the dredging of the River Clyde increasingly allowed ships to take merchandise directly to Glasgow, but merchants continued to use Greenock harbour. The [[American Revolutionary War]] temporarily interrupted trade, and the gun battery of [[Fort Beauclerc]] near the West Burn was extended to guard against the threat of [[privateer]]s, but the emphasis shifted to wider markets including imports of [[rum]] and sugar from the [[Caribbean]], wines from Spain, and fish from North America. A [[whaling]] business operated for about 40 years.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1921|pp=6, 55, 85, 87, 94}}</ref> In 1868, in what became a ''[[cause celebre]]'',<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=B.|title=Popular Crime: Reflections on the Celebration of Violence|year=2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-1-41655-274-1|p=51}}</ref> seven young Greenock males [[Greenock stowaways|stowed away on a cargo ship]] bound for [[Quebec]].

Receipts rose rapidly with the expansion of colonial trade, and in 1778 the custom house moved to new built premises at the West Quay of the harbour.<ref name=\"customhouse\">{{harvnb|Monteith|2004|p=19}}</ref>\n\nBy 1791 a new pier was constructed at the East Quay. In 1812 Europe's first steamboat service was introduced by {{PS|Comet}} with frequent sailings between Glasgow, Greenock and [[Helensburgh]], and as trade built up the pier became known as Steamboat Quay. The custom house needed larger premises, and in May 1817 the foundation stone was laid at the quay for a Custom House building designed by [[William Burn]], which was completed in 1818. Its gracious [[neoclassical architecture]] features a Grecian [[Doric order|Doric]] [[portico]] looking out over the quayside, which was given the name Customhouse Quay.<ref name=\"customhouse\" /> In 1828 the Custom House was praised as \"a grand National Structure\" in \"the highest style of elegance\".

In June 2008 [[HM Revenue and Customs]] (HMRC) announced that the building would close in 2011 as part of a rationalisation project with any jobs being transferred to offices in [[Glasgow]], and despite a campaign to oppose these plans, the building closed in August 2010.\n\nRiverside Inverclyde arranged further refurbishment works, and in 2013 announced that space had already been let to companies including [[PG Paper Company]] Ltd and [[Toshiba]] which had planning permission to form meeting rooms and an executive office in the building.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title       = Regeneration Projects Attracting Interest\n  | url         = http://www.inverclydenow.com/today/10801-regeneration-projects-attracting-interest\n  | publisher   = Inverclyde Now\n  | date        = 16 November 2013\n  | accessdate  = 10 December 2013\n  | url-status     = dead\n  | archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131212223938/http://www.inverclydenow.com/today/10801-regeneration-projects-attracting-interest\n  | archivedate = 12 December 2013\n  | df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web\n  | url         = http://www.heraldscotland.com/business/13774549.PG_Paper_moves_to_Greenock_s_Custom_House/\n  | title       = PG Paper moves to Greenock's Custom House\n  | website     = HeraldScotland\n  | language    = en\n  | access-date = 2017-02-06\n}}</ref> [[Greenock Telegraph]] estimated that \u00a34.1 million has been spent over 5-year period for the renovation works.<ref>{{Cite web\n  | url         = http://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk/news/14497370.__4m_Greenock_Custom_House_project_nears_an_end/\n  | title       = \u00a34m Greenock Custom House project nears an end\n  | website     = Greenock Telegraph\n  | language    = en\n  | access-date = 2017-02-06\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Industry and railways ===\n[[File:Cornalees 31806.jpg|thumb|''The Cut'' \u2013 visitor centre]]\n[[File:Greenock Cut 011006 nr Overton.jpg|thumb|''The Cut'' \u2013 [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]]]\n\nGreenock became a centre of industry, with water power being used to process imported goods. In 1827 [[Loch Thom]] was constructed as a reservoir with ''The Cut'' [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]], bringing water to two lines of falls for water mills to power a paper mill, cotton and woollen mills, sugar refineries and shipbuilding\n\n[[Greenock Central railway station]] at Cathcart Street opened in 1841, for the first time providing a fast route from Glasgow to the coast linking up with [[Clyde steamer]] services. The provision of this new line meant there was no need to take the steamer all the way down river from Glasgow. In 1869 the [[Caledonian Railway]] was bypassed by the rival [[Glasgow and South Western Railway]] which opened a station on the waterfront at Princes Pier, served by a tunnel under Greenock's west end. To regain custom, the Caledonian Railway extended (what is now known as the [[Inverclyde Line]]) the [[Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway]] west to Gourock; this line was built to run inland through deep cuttings and tunnels, with a tunnel under the whole length of Newton Street crossing under the other railway tunnel to emerge near [[Fort Matilda railway station]]. Spoil from the cuttings and tunnels was used to build an embankment out from the shore to a long timber wharf at [[Gourock railway station]], providing space for railway sidings.{{sfn|Montheith|2004|pp=40, 47, 84, 70, 94.}} The railway bought Wester Greenock castle and its extension, the Mansion House, and demolished them before constructing the tunnel immediately west of Greenock Central station, running under the castle grounds which now form Well Park.<ref name=\"Sweet\" />\n\n=== Victoria Tower ===\n[[File:Greenock muni blgs2.jpg|thumb|upright|View from above Cathcart Street over Cathcart Square to the Municipal Buildings, with the Victoria Tower to the right of \"Cowan's Corner\", and the ''Mid Kirk'' spire of 1781 to the left.]]\nGreenock's increasing importance and wealth was manifested in the construction of the [[Italianate]] Municipal Buildings, whose Victoria Tower, completed in 1886, stands {{convert|245|ft|m|abbr=off}} tall.<ref name=\"ArtStrachan2008\">{{cite book\n  | author1   = Sphinx Fine Art\n  | author2   = Edward Strachan\n  | author3   = Roy Bolton\n  | title     = Russia & Europe in the Nineteenth Century\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/books?id=vnf_0IVt1GgC&pg=PA30\n  | year      = 2008\n  | publisher = Sphinx Fine Art\n  | isbn      = 978-1-907200-02-1\n  | pages     = 30\u2013\n}}</ref> Begun five years previously in a competition won by architects [[H & D Barclay]], it exceeds the height of the tower of [[Glasgow City Chambers]] by more than a metre. The Municipal Buildings were bombed during World War 2 and what is known as Cowans Corner on the southern elevation of the building was destroyed beyond repair and remains like so today.\n\nCowan's Corner is named so after the story of how an obstinate shop owner took on the town council and thwarted its plans for the construction of the Municipal Buildings. In the 1850s, the council started buying up all the property on the projected Municipal Building site, but the council did not anticipate it would run into problems when attempting to negotiate with a certain Robert Cowan, one of the owners of the firm of Cowan & Lawrie that operated a shop on a corner site in Cathcart Square. The council made every effort to reach a compromise but Robert refused to sell his property. Only when the plans were altered, owing to the fact the corner site could not be acquired, was Greenock's famous landmark \u2014 the Victoria Tower \u2014 designed.\n\nWork started on the Municipal Buildings in 1881 and was completed in 1886. The total cost was \u00a3197,061 \u2014 a colossal amount then \u2014 and it left the town with a debt not finally cleared until 1952. After the buildings were finished, further legal proceedings started and a court decision meant Robert Cowan had to move. He opened new premises at the corner of Westburn Street and West Blackhall Street. The property at the corner of the square was destroyed during the Blitz of 1941.\n\nDespite Robert Cowan being forced out, it would appear the council could not proceed with any plans it had for the site prior to the Blitz. A 1957 Telegraph story stated that only a few years earlier had Greenock Corporation managed to negotiate its purchase due to conflicting claims by descendants of the original owners. The article said that it had been suggested the corporation might finally be able to complete the Municipal Buildings to approximately the original designs. Cowan's Corner remains vacant but is a landscaped area with seating.\n\n=== Villas ===\nFurther evidence of this wealth can be seen in the large villas of Greenock's west end, one time home to the ship owners, industrialists and investors. The area is fronted by the mile long (1.6&nbsp;km) sweep of the Esplanade with its views across the Clyde to [[Kilcreggan]] which almost convinces the visitor that no heavy industry could have been anywhere nearby.\n\n=== Battery Park and torpedoes ===\nThe [[War of 1812]] reawakened fears of American raids against Britain's ports. Earlier gun batteries, had been dismantled, and in 1813 ground was granted for a battery at Whitefarland Point: [[Fort Matilda]] was completed in 1818 and was sporadically modified over the century. The land to the west of this was common ground for inhabitants of the town, but in 1907 the [[Admiralty]] compulsorily purchased part of this land for a torpedo factory. The remaining space was handed over to Greenock Corporation in 1914 as a public park.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1921|pp=148, 168\u2013169}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Clyde Torpedo Factory'', which opened in 1910, with 700 workers transferred from the [[Royal Arsenal]], [[Woolwich]]. The site was tasked with designing and testing of [[torpedoes]]. These were then tested in [[Loch Long]]. During the [[Second World War]] the site switched entirely to manufacturing torpedoes. The original gun battery site was occupied by the ''Navy Buildings'', the main offices, just to the east of the torpedo factory buildings.\nFollowing WW2, in 1947,<ref>{{cite web\n  | url       = http://www.secretscotland.org.uk/index.php/Secrets/RoyalNavalTorpedoFactories\n  | title     = Secret Scotland \u2013 Royal Naval Torpedo Factories\n  | publisher =\n}}</ref>  the site became fully committed to R&D as the Torpedo Experimental Establishment (TEE).  TEE was closed in 1959, when all torpedo research, development and design were concentrated at the newly formed Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment (AUWE), Portland.<ref>I worked there 1957\u201359</ref>\n\n=== Old West Kirk ===\n[[File:Old West Kirk Farmer's Loft.jpg|thumb|left|The Old West Kirk features a scale model of a 20-gun frigate above its Sailor's loft: the Laird's Gallery is on the right.]]\nA church which became known as the [[Old West Kirk]] had been established in Greenock in 1591 under the patronage of [[John Schaw]], the first built in Scotland since the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]]. It was extended over the years, at an early stage the Schaw aisle provided pews for the Laird of the Barony, built as a gallery to the east of the nave of the church. Opposite it, above the front entrance, is the Crawfurdsburn or Choir Gallery. At the south end of the nave, the Sailor's Loft gallery was built in 1698 and features a 19th-century model frigate, which replaced earlier models. At the north end, the Farmer's Gallery is above the main seating area. A tower was added in the mid 19th century.\n\nIn 1926, to make way for expansion of the [[Harland & Wolff]] shipyard (the present-day location of Container Way), the Old West Kirk was relocated to a new site on the Esplanade where it still stands. The shipbuilders provided the Pirrie Hall to the south of the site: this was opened in February 1925, just after the old church closed for work to commence, and was used during the works to accommodate services, enabling the congregation to see progress on the rebuilt kirk. It then came into use as the church hall.\n\nThe church is notable for [[stained glass]] by artists such as [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and Sir [[Edward Burne-Jones]]. The Church has a website.<ref>{{cite web\n  | url        = http://www.lylekirk.org/owk%20web2/Page0.html\n  | title      = Welcome To The Old West Kirk,Greenock\n  | publisher  = Lyle Kirk\n  | accessdate = 2016-09-15\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Second World War ===\n[[File:Free French Memorial Greenock.jpg|thumb|right|[[Free French Forces|Free French]] Memorial on [[Lyle Hill]] overlooking Gourock]]\n[[File:James Watt Memorial College.jpg|thumb|upright|The original [[James Watt Memorial College]] building]]\n[[File:Greenock Town hall.jpg|thumb|right|Greenock Town Hall]]\n\nGreenock suffered badly during the [[Second World War]] and its anchorage at the [[Tail of the Bank]] became the base for the [[Home Fleet]] as well as the main assembly point for [[Atlantic]] convoys. On 30 April 1940 the French [[Vauquelin class destroyer]] ''[[French destroyer Maill\u00e9 Br\u00e9z\u00e9 (1931)|Maill\u00e9 Br\u00e9z\u00e9]]'' blew up off Greenock with heavy loss of life following an accident involving two of her own torpedoes. Although this disaster occurred before the [[Free French Forces#Cross of Lorraine|Free French]] Naval Forces were established, many people tend to regard the [[Cross of Lorraine]] on [[Lyle Hill]] as a memorial to the loss of the ''Maill\u00e9 Br\u00e9z\u00e9'' as well as to the later losses of the [[Free French Naval Forces]] which sailed from the town. On the nights of 6 May and 7 May 1941 around 300 [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft attacked the town in the [[Greenock Blitz]].\n\nOn 10 October 1940, [[RAF Greenock]] was created as a maintenance base for RAF flying boats. The base was hit on 7 May 1941 during the Greenock Blitz.<ref>http://www.abct.org.uk/airfields/airfield-finder/greenock/</ref>\n\nA large building housing a drapery business constructed on Cowan's property at the corner of the Municipal Buildings was badly damaged and was demolished, leaving the blank brick corner area still known as \"Cowan's Corner\". This was later set as a garden for the blind.\n\nThe original blank brick of Cowans Corner was covered in 2008 as part of the continuing work to improve the look of the town centre.\n\n=== Postwar years ===\nGreenock thrived in the post-war years but as the heavy industries declined in the 1970s and 1980s unemployment became a major problem, and it has only been in the last ten years with reinvestment and the redevelopment of large sections of the town that the local economy has started to revive. Tourism has appeared as an unexpected bonus with the development of the Clydeport Container Terminal as Ocean Terminal, a [[passenger terminal (maritime)|passenger terminal]] for cruise ships crossing the Atlantic. Students who do not travel further afield for study often attend the Greenock campus of West College (formerly known as [[James Watt College]] of Further and Higher Education).\n\nGreenock reached its population peak in 1921 (81,123) and was once the sixth largest town in Scotland.\n\n== Governance ==\n{{Main|Greenock (UK Parliament constituency)}}\n\nUntil 1974, Greenock was a [[parliamentary burgh]] in its own right. It was merged with Port Glasgow to form [[Greenock and Port Glasgow (UK Parliament constituency)|Greenock and Port Glasgow]] constituency. In 1997, it became [[Greenock and Inverclyde (UK Parliament constituency)|Greenock and Inverclyde]]. After the redistribution of Scottish seats, it was merged into an enlarged ''[[Inverclyde (UK Parliament constituency)|Inverclyde]]'' constituency \u2013 the first time in political history that Greenock has not been named in a parliamentary seat. ''[[Greenock and Inverclyde (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Greenock and Inverclyde]]'' remains a [[Scottish Parliament]] constituency.\n\n== Health ==\nThe [[Inverclyde Royal Hospital]] is located in Greenock serving the population of [[Inverclyde]], [[Largs]], the [[Isle of Bute]] and the [[Cowal]] Peninsula.<ref>{{cite web\n  | url        = http://www.nhsggc.org.uk/content/default.asp?page=s762&loc_id=2528\n  | publisher  = NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde\n  | title      = Inverclyde Royal Hospital\n  | accessdate = 2010-05-07\n}}</ref> \n\nLanghill Clinic situated behind Inverclyde Royal Hospital is now the main psychiatric hospital with an IPCU unit and [[Day hospital]] alongside the main psychiatric ward.\n\n== Geography ==\n=== Areas and suburbs ===\n[[File:View of Greenock from Auchmountain Road (Inverclyde, Scotland, DSCF9281).jpg|thumb|View of Greenock from Auchmountain Road]]\n[[Arran View, Greenock|Arran View]], [[Bogston railway station|Bogston]], [[Bow Farm, Greenock|Bow Farm]], [[Braeside, Greenock|Braeside]], [[Branchton, Greenock|Branchton]], [[Bridgend, Greenock|Bridgend]], [[Broomhill, Greenock|Broomhill]], [[Barony of Cartsburn|Cartsburn]], [[Cornhaddock, Greenock|Cornhaddock]], [[Fancy Farm, Greenock|Fancy Farm]], [[Fort Matilda railway station|Fort Matilda]], [[Gibshill]], [[Greenock West, Greenock|Greenock West]], [[Grieve hill , Greenock|Grieve Hill]], [[Hole Farm, Greenock|Hole Farm]], [[Larkfield, Greenock|Larkfield]], [[Lyle Hill, Greenock|Lyle Hill]], [[Lynedoch Street, Grenock|Lynedoch]], [[Overton, Greenock|Overton]], [[Pennyfern, Greenock|Pennyfern]], [[Strone, Greenock|Strone]], [[Strone Farm, Greenock|Strone Farm]] and [[Whinhill railway station|Whinhill]]. [[Spango Valley]] is located to the west of the town.\n\n== Economy ==\nHistorically, the town relied on [[shipbuilding]], sugar refining and [[wool]] manufacturing for employment, but none of these industries are today part of Greenock's economy. More recently the town relied heavily on [[electronics]] manufacture. However, this has given way mostly to: [[call centre]] business, insurance, banking and shipping export.\n\nThe Fleming and Reid merino wool mill employed 500 people \u2013 mostly women and produced wool garments spun and woven at the mill. This mill was at the corner of Drumfrochar Road and Mill Road.\n\nAs of October 2012 Greenock has an unemployment rate of 5.3%, above the Scottish average of 3.9% (figure is for the [[Scottish Parliament]] [[Greenock and Inverclyde (Scottish Parliament constituency)|constituency]] and includes [[Gourock]], [[Inverkip]], [[Port Glasgow]] and [[Wemyss Bay]]).<ref>{{cite web\n  | url        = https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/wpca/1929380450/report.aspx#tabwab\n  | title      = nomis \u2013 official labour market statistics\n  | publisher  = Nomisweb.co.uk\n  | date       = 30 September 2010\n  | accessdate = 2013-01-26\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Shipbuilding ===\n[[File:Greenock waterfront.jpg|thumb|right|Greenock waterfront from Victoria Harbour to Ocean Terminal, the skyline dominated by Victoria Tower.]]\n[[File:Greenock Central 190906b.jpg|thumb|right|[[Greenock Central railway station|Greenock Central]]]]\n[[File:Finnarrow at Inchgreen Drydock 02.jpg|thumb|right|The Inchgreen [[Dry dock|Drydock]] lacked major repair work for almost a decade, then in March 2013 it was used for urgent repairs to the ro-ro [[Stena Line]] ferry ''Finnarrow''.]]\n[[File:Inchgreen Drydock and repair quay,.jpg|thumb|View looking north over the Inchgreen Drydock and repair quay, with the Greenock Great Harbour to the left, after the announcement that the dry dock cranes are to be demolished.]]\n\nIn the early 17th century, the first [[pier]] was built in Greenock. Shipbuilding was already an important employer by this time. The first proper [[harbour]] was constructed in 1710 and the first well-known shipbuilders, [[Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company]], was established the following year. It was the oldest shipbuilding business in the world {{citation needed|date=October 2016}} and gained numerous contracts with the [[Royal Navy]] from 1806, building ships such as ''[[HMS Glasgow (C21)|Glasgow]]''.\n\nIn 1967 Scott's was merged with [[Lithgows]] (founded 1874, later the largest privately owned yard in the world) the same year becoming [[Scott Lithgow]], which was later nationalised as part of [[British Shipbuilders]] in 1977. From 1800 to 1980 many thousands of people worked to design, build and repair ships. The reduction in shipbuilding in the 1970s and 1980s meant that none of these companies are still trading.\n\nGreenock Shipbuilders included: Scotts, Browns, William Lithgows, Fergusons, Head the Boat Builder (lifeboats). Other marine engineering related companies included engine-makers \u2013 Kincaids, Scotts, Rankin and Blackmore (which included the Eagle Foundry) \u2013 ship repair (Lamonts) and Hasties for steering gear. Yacht builders included Adams and McLean (at Cardwell Bay). Other yards included Cartsburn, Cartsdyke, and Klondyke \u2013 all of which closed during the 1970s and 1980s due to competition from [[South Korea]] and Japan.\n\nPart of the site of the ''Scott's'' yard, is now an [[EE (telecommunications company)|EE]] call centre, and the Kingston Yard was redeveloped for housing. Shipbuilding is now continued at [[Ferguson Marine Engineering]] in nearby [[Port Glasgow]], after Ferguson Shipbuilders was taken over by [[Jim McColl]] and began modernisation.\nShip repair work continues at the Garvel Drydock in Greenock's Great Harbour.\n\nThe Inchgreen Drydock was opened in 1964 as one of the largest in the world at 305&nbsp;m long and 48&nbsp;m wide.

Ships on the Montreal to Liverpool transit would anchor at the Tail of the Bank off Greenock in the Firth of Clyde and steam paddlewheel ferries would service the liners. Cunard operated: the RMS Ivernia (1954), RMS Saxonia (1955), RMS Carinthia (1956) and RMS Sylvania (1957). These four ships were built at John Brown & Company shipyards, typically 22,000 tons, twin screw, 600 passengers.

There were 14 sugar refineries, including The Westburn, Walkers, The Glebe, Lochore and Ferguson and Dempster, plus a sugar beet factory on Ingleston Street. Tobacco from the Americas also arrived here.\n\nWhen Tate and Lyle finally closed its Greenock refinery in 1997 it brought to an end the town's 150-year-old connections with sugar manufacture. A newly built sugar warehouse continued shipping operations at Greenock's ''Ocean Terminal''. The former sugar warehouse at the James Watt Dock was by then scheduled as a category A [[listed building]] as a fine example of early industrial architecture, with an unusual feature of a [[colonnade]] of cast iron columns forming a sheltered unloading area next to the [[quay]]side.

The photographs show the building still intact in February 2006, but a fire on the evening of 12 June 2006 caused severe damage to much of the building before being brought under control in the early hours of 13 June.

[[Texas Instruments]] (Formerly [[National Semiconductor]]) has run a [[silicon]] wafer manufacturing plant in the town since 1970.\n\nHowever, with manufacturing moving to Eastern Europe and Asia, work has shifted to the [[service sector]], especially call centres. EE and IBM both have major call centre operations in Greenock, while the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] Mortgage Centre processes Mortgage applications from throughout the UK & Ireland.\n\nIBM closed their entire factory in Greenock which is in the process of being demolished. [[Sanmina]], another electronics company, took over much of the IBM installation but moved 370 jobs to [[Hungary]] in 2006.<ref>{{citation\n  | title       = Workers' disgust at Hungary move\n  | journal     = Greenock Telegraph\n  | date        = 15 February 2006\n  | url         = http://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk/news/roundup/articles/2006/02/16/6819-workers034-disgust-at-hungary-move/\n  | accessdate  = 2010-05-07\n  | url-status     = dead\n  | archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120227192955/http://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk/news/roundup/articles/2006/02/16/6819-workers034-disgust-at-hungary-move/\n  | archivedate = 27 February 2012\n  | df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> The Sanmina plant, which consisted of the former IBM AMDC (Automated Materials Distribution Centre) and Modules buildings 1 to 5, has since ceased operation and was demolished in 2009.

In 1975 it disappeared, along with several other central streets, as the area was [[pedestrianised]] as Hamilton Way. In 1992 it was covered and enclosed as an 85-unit centre by Covell Matthews for then-clients Ossory Road Estates as ''The Oak Mall'' (in administration as of 21 November 2013).<ref>{{cite web\n  | url   = http://www.insolventcompanies.co.uk/oak-mall-greenock-limited-04384548/\n  | title = OAK MALL GREENOCK LIMITED [04384548]\n  | work  = Insolvent, Winding Up, Bankrupt & Administration Information\n}}</ref> It has since been supplanted as Inverclyde's main shopping area by the retail park at Port Glasgow.

[[Marks and Spencer]] was in its original building (of 1936) which was simply built round during the first phase of pedestrianisation, where it remained until the store moved to a new unit at Port Glasgow.<ref>''Greenock from Old Photographs'', 1984</ref> [[Tesco]] and [[Morrisons]] also have a presence in the town. A small retail estate is opposite the ''Waterfront'' swimming pool and leisure centre. Elsewhere, small groups of shops in most of the areas of the town provide for day-to-day needs. The town contains one diplomatic mission, an Italian consulate.\n\n== Transport ==\nGreenock's most significant transportation connection is the Container Terminal (see above).\n\nGreenock is Scotland's best served town in terms of railway stations. It boasts eight: [[Bogston railway station|Bogston]], [[Cartsdyke railway station|Cartsdyke]], [[Greenock Central railway station|Greenock Central]], [[Greenock West railway station|Greenock West]], [[Fort Matilda railway station|Fort Matilda]], [[Whinhill railway station|Whinhill]], [[Drumfrochar railway station|Drumfrochar]] and [[Branchton railway station|Branchton]]. A ninth station, located at the [[IBM railway station|former IBM complex]], is currently mothballed pending redevelopment of the site. Only Glasgow has a much greater number of stations and Edinburgh possesses only two more. Greenock has the longest bored railway tunnel in Scotland{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} at {{convert|1.2|mi|km}} in length. Located directly under Newton Street in the town, the tunnel allowed for the extension of the railway to [[Gourock]].\n\nGreenock is served by a number of local bus routes covering the majority of Greenock, Gourock and Port Glasgow. Long distance services travel regularly to Glasgow, Largs and Dunoon. The majority of routes are run by [[McGill's Bus Services]]. The Largs to Glasgow corridor is served by two services, the 901, 906, which provide a bus along this route every 15 minutes for most of the day. The 531 service also offers travel from Greenock to Glasgow, serving the Slaemuir area of Port Glasgow before connecting with the X7 Service and continuing through Bridge of Weir, Houston and Linwood, then joining the motorway to Braehead before heading into Glasgow City Centre.\n\nGreenock is located at the end of the [[A8 road (Great Britain)|A8 road]]/[[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8 motorway]] which begins in [[Edinburgh]]. It is also the northern terminus of [[Euroroute]] [[European route E05|E05]] which heads south through England, France and Spain, ending at the Spanish port and container terminal of [[Algeciras]].\n\n== Culture ==\nGreenock is one of the settings for [[Alan Sharp]]'s 1965 novel ''A Green Tree in Gedde''. It is fictionalised as 'Gantock' by [[Robin Jenkins]] in his 1979 novel ''Fergus Lamont'' (The Gantocks are a rocky [[shoal]] in the [[Firth of Clyde]] nearby, just off [[Dunoon]]). [[Alasdair Gray]]'s 1984 novel ''[[1982, Janine]]'' is set in a Greenock hotel room. [[Matthew Fitt]]'s [[cyberpunk]] novel ''[[But'n'Ben A-Go-Go]]'' features a submerged Greenock after the effects of [[global warming]]. Greenock has featured in the poetry of W.S. Graham (evoking his childhood) and [[Douglas Dunn]].\n\nGreenock is home to the world's first [[Burns Supper|Burns Club]], [[The Mother Club]], which was founded in 1801 by merchants born in [[Ayrshire]], some of whom had known Robert Burns. They held the first Burns Supper on what they thought was his birthday on 29 January 1802, but in 1803 discovered from the Ayr parish records that the correct date was 25 January 1759.<ref>{{cite web\n  | url         = http://www.worldburnsclub.com/newsletter/0107/greenock_burns_club.htm\n  | title       = Congratulation Greenock Burns Club\n  | publisher   = The Robert Burns World Federation Limited\n  | accessdate  = 2010-01-18\n  | url-status     = dead\n  | archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100126011456/http://www.worldburnsclub.com/newsletter/0107/greenock_burns_club.htm\n  | archivedate = 26 January 2010\n  | df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Victorian era|Victorian]] landscape artist [[John Atkinson Grimshaw]] depicted a somewhat idealised Greenock in several of his paintings.\n\nThe [[Mclean Museum]] is the largest museum in the Inverclyde area, featuring exhibitions on [[James Watt]] and a collection of [[Ancient Egyptian]] artefacts.\n\n[[File:Beacon Arts Centre & clock tower w.jpg|thumb|The Beacon Arts Centre, with the Gallery Suite and caf\u00e9 / bistro looking out over the Custom House Quay waterfront and the Clyde.]]\nThe [[Greenock Arts Guild]]'s ''Beacon Arts Centre'' (replacing the former ''Arts Guild Theatre'') opened in 2013 in a new building at Greenock's Custom House Quay.

All faculty are evaluated by students each semester, and there are annual faculty activity reports and faculty peer evaluations.<br>\nFacilities are developed to support this approach: in 2004 the Matteo Ricci Study Hall was completed and in 2006 the Manuel V. Pangilinan Center for Student Leadership housing student organizations and services.\n=== Centers of Excellence & Development for Excellence ===\nCenters of Excellence (COEs) and Centers of Development (CODs) are programs identified by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) as exhibiting the highest standards of instruction, research, and extension. Such programs are expected to provide leadership and networking arrangements to ensure the accelerated development of all the schools. The COEs/CODs are given funding assistance for student scholarships, faculty development, library and laboratory upgrading, research and extension services, instructional materials development, and networking among existing COEs and CODs.

One of the first Dutch [[feminism|feminists]], she was also known under her pseudonyms Gipsy, Gitano, and E. Prezcier.\n\n== Life ==\nDrucker was one of two daughters born to the seamstress Constantia Christina Lensing and the banker Louis Drucker but her father refused to marry her mother or to legally recognise their children, meaning Wilhelmina grew up in difficult circumstances. She took up the same profession as her mother and from 1886 onwards attended meetings of the [[Sociaal-Democratische Bond]], the De Unie union, the Nederlandsche Bond voor Algemeen Kies- en Stemrecht (Dutch League for General Suffrage) and the freethinkers' association De Dageraad. In the following years [[socialism]] had a major formative influence on her. She argued from her personal experience against a wider background, analysing and understanding the social mechanisms affecting women and thus able to conceive of what action to take to bring about change. Under a pseudonym, she wrote a book attacking the [[double standard]]s of her father's morality in only recognising children born to him by a richer woman.\n\n[[File:Wilhelmina Drucker 1917.jpg|thumb|left|Wilhelmina Drucker with her portrait painted by [[Truus Claes]] in 1917 on the occasion of Drucker's seventieth birthday.]]\nShe also began a lawsuit against her half-brother, the liberal politician [[Hendrik Lodewijk Drucker]], who had received an inheritance from Louis - she won it in 1888 and thus gained financial independence. Immediately after this she and other women from radical and socialist circles set up ''De Vrouw'' (The Woman), a weekly magazine for women and girls. In 1889 Drucker founded the [[Vrije Vrouwen Vereeniging]] (VVV, or Free Women's Association), which in 1894 developed into the [[Vereeniging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht]] (Women's Rights Association). In 1891 Drucker represented the VVV at the [[International Socialist Labor Congress of Brussels, 1891|International Socialist Labor Congress]] in [[Brussels]], the second congress of the [[Second International]], where she and delegates from Germany, Austria and Italy called for a resolution that the manifestos of all countries' socialist parties' should include a call for full legal and political equality of men and women - this resolution was adopted by the congress.\n\nIn 1893 Drucker and her right-hand-woman Dora Schook-Haver founded the weekly magazine ''Evolutie'' (Evolution) - this lasted until 1926. Drucker also lectured throughout the Netherlands, got involved in the establishment of several women's trade unions and in 1897 became a member of the newly founded Vereeniging Onderlinge Vrouwenbescherming (VOV, or Women's Mutual Protection Society), which worked for the rights of unmarried mothers and their children. Drucker stated that the VOV should be a militant organisation uniting all women - married or unmarried, with or without children - to work in the public sphere for women's rights and against unjust laws and outdated morality.<ref>{{in lang|nl}} [http://socialhistory.org/bwsa/biografie/lensing Article Myriam Everard on the website for the Biografisch Woordenboek van het Socialisme en de Arbeidersbeweging in Nederland (BWSA).]</ref> She explained her thinking and ideas on the mission and role of the VOV, laying the foundations for later activist organisations such as Blijf van mijn Lijf (literally 'Stay away from my body, a network of [[women's shelter]]s) and Vrouwen tegen Verkrachting (Women against Rape). For her militant calls for action to achieve women's equality she was nicknamed 'Ijzeren'(iron) or 'Dolle'(mad) Mina, monikers that gained even more traction after her staging of a symbolic public burning of women's corsets. The highly publicised activist feminist group [[Dolle Mina]], started in 1970, was named in honour of Wilhelmina Drucker, which was celebrated by a public brassiere-burning ceremony in Amsterdam.\n\n== Works ==\n* {{in lang|nl}} ''Over vrijen en trouwen, waar velen van houwen'' - [S.l.] : [s.n.], 1905. - p.&nbsp;138-139\n* {{in lang|nl}} ''Vrouwenarbeid in het verleden en in het heden'': rede gehouden op de Algemeene Vergadering van den Nationalen Vrouwenraad in Nederland op 26 April 1906 te Groningen / Wilhelmina Drucker. - [S.l.] : [s.n.], 1906. - 10p.\n* {{in lang|fr}} ''Autour du travail de la femme'' - Amsterdam : [s.n.], 1911. - 14p.\n* {{in lang|nl}} ''Moederschap : sexueele ethiek'' / M.

He is commemorated by the [[Museum De Cruquius]].\n\nHe was a perfectionist who liked to measure things and he calculated temperature measurements in [[Fahrenheit]] from 1706 to 1734. His historical calculations are still used today by the [[KNMI (institute)|KNMI]], the Dutch [[meteorological]] institute. He not only measured weather changes in wind speed, rainfall, air pressure, temperature, and humidity, but also measured sea level. His method of visualising planes of water level to illustrate contours of depth ([[isobath]]s) in his map of the [[Merwede]] (1728) was the first of its kind.<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Map |volume=17 |page=630}}</ref> He was an advocate of pumping out the [[Haarlemmermeer]] (Haarlem lake),<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Haarlem Lake |volume=12 |page=781}}</ref> which was done a century after his death.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Spaarndam-Gemeenlandshuis Rijnland zuidzijde.jpg|thumb|left|Rijnlandshuis, the [[Gemeenlandshuis]] where Cruquius lived and worked in Spaarndam]]\nHe became a surveyor at the age of 19 and began to draw maps, a lucrative job in his day. Though born in Vlieland, he moved to [[Delft]] a few years after he was born and it is there in 1705 that he started his first weather observations. In 1717 at the age of 39, though firmly established as a respected surveyor, he moved to the family farm in [[Rijnsburg]] outside Leiden and chose to study in [[Leiden]] under [[Herman Boerhaave]], at that time the most famous scientist in the Netherlands. He signed himself in as \"Krukius, medical student, born in Delft\". Thanks to Boerhaave, Kruik became a member of the [[Royal Society of London]]. The secretary of the Royal Society at that time, [[James Jurin]], started the first European network of meteorological weather stations, and the Dutch members played a large part. Kruik was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1724.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28%28text%29%3D%27Cruquius%27%29|title=The Raymond and Beverly Sackler Archive Resource entry for Cruquius; Nicolaus|publisher=[[Royal Society]]|accessdate=9 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1721 and 1723 [[Luigi Ferdinando Marsigli]] travelled to Holland and he and Boerhaave stimulated Kruik to keep systematic observations in the belief that climate changes had an effect on public health. Kruik started to travel the various beaches and rivers in the Netherlands and study the waterlevels while continuing his mapmaking work. On these trips he was sometimes accompanied by Boerhaave and Marsigli. While studying the [[Merwede]], he began to form plans to help keep the lower areas of the Netherlands dry. \n\nIt was at this time that Kruik changed his name to the Latin ''Cruquius'' after his first publications of maps and measurements. In 1725 he wrote a famous letter to [[Willem 's Gravesande]], a Dutch professor of physics and astronomy at Leiden, proposing an empirical deductive research method to solve the water problems of the Netherlands. This letter started the chain of events in working that eventually led to a plan presented to the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] to create a water defence plan in 1727. It was this unified water plan that in turn led to the creation of [[Haarlemmermeer]] bij pumping the Haarlem lake dry more than a century later. \n[[File:Cruquius-Diagram-eclipse-1732.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Diagram showing the distance of the planets to the earth in 1732, also showing a complete lunar eclipse and a partial solar eclipse in that year]]\nIn 1733 he became a member of the '[[Hoogheemraadschap Rijnland]]', the Dutch Waterboard Agency, and worked as a Waterboard inspector in [[Spaarndam]]. It was here that he met Jan Noppen (1706\u20131734), the [[Halfweg]] inspector, who started the earliest continuous weatherstation in [[Zwanenburg]] with measurements 3 times daily of temperature, air pressure, humidity, and rainfall.\n\nAn eccentric man, Kruik wrote music, and had an obsessive need to measure things. This need included measuring his own weight and amount of urine daily. According to contemporary accounts, only Boerhaave could successfully work with him.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* \"In een opslag van het oog: de Hollandse rivierkartografie en waterstaatszorg in opkomst, 1725\u20131754\",Paul van den Brink,Canaletto/Repro-Holland, 1998\n* \"Het oudste weerboekje van Nederland: de weerwaarnemingen van Nicolaas Cruquius, met een inleiding van Harry Geurts, KNMI\", a reprint of the \"Hoogheemraadschap van Rijnland\" (Dutch Waterboard agency) archive of the observations of Nicolaas Cruquius with a foreword by Harry Geurts of the Dutch Meteorological Institute KNMI, by Nicolaas Cruquius & Harry Geurts, Van Wijnen, Franeker,2006\n{{Commons category|Nicolaas Samuel Crucquius}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.museumdecruquius.nl Museum De Cruquius website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070808062308/http://www.knmi.nl/VinkCMS/explained_subject_detail.jsp?id=3807 Dutch Meteorological Institute (KNMI) website] Link with historical information about Cruquius (retrieved dec 2007)\n* [http://www.verkeerenwaterstaat.nl/kennisplein/1/9/197688/HistorischeWeerkundigeWaarnemingen_deel_IV.pdf Historische weerkundige waarnemingen, A.F.V. van Engelen en H.A.M.

Kruik was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1724.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28%28text%29%3D%27Cruquius%27%29|title=The Raymond and Beverly Sackler Archive Resource entry for Cruquius; Nicolaus|publisher=[[Royal Society]]|accessdate=9 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1721 and 1723 [[Luigi Ferdinando Marsigli]] travelled to Holland and he and Boerhaave stimulated Kruik to keep systematic observations in the belief that climate changes had an effect on public health. Kruik started to travel the various beaches and rivers in the Netherlands and study the waterlevels while continuing his mapmaking work. On these trips he was sometimes accompanied by Boerhaave and Marsigli. While studying the [[Merwede]], he began to form plans to help keep the lower areas of the Netherlands dry. \n\nIt was at this time that Kruik changed his name to the Latin ''Cruquius'' after his first publications of maps and measurements. In 1725 he wrote a famous letter to [[Willem 's Gravesande]], a Dutch professor of physics and astronomy at Leiden, proposing an empirical deductive research method to solve the water problems of the Netherlands. This letter started the chain of events in working that eventually led to a plan presented to the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] to create a water defence plan in 1727. It was this unified water plan that in turn led to the creation of [[Haarlemmermeer]] bij pumping the Haarlem lake dry more than a century later. \n[[File:Cruquius-Diagram-eclipse-1732.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Diagram showing the distance of the planets to the earth in 1732, also showing a complete lunar eclipse and a partial solar eclipse in that year]]\nIn 1733 he became a member of the '[[Hoogheemraadschap Rijnland]]', the Dutch Waterboard Agency, and worked as a Waterboard inspector in [[Spaarndam]]. It was here that he met Jan Noppen (1706\u20131734), the [[Halfweg]] inspector, who started the earliest continuous weatherstation in [[Zwanenburg]] with measurements 3 times daily of temperature, air pressure, humidity, and rainfall.\n\nAn eccentric man, Kruik wrote music, and had an obsessive need to measure things. This need included measuring his own weight and amount of urine daily. According to contemporary accounts, only Boerhaave could successfully work with him.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* \"In een opslag van het oog: de Hollandse rivierkartografie en waterstaatszorg in opkomst, 1725\u20131754\",Paul van den Brink,Canaletto/Repro-Holland, 1998\n* \"Het oudste weerboekje van Nederland: de weerwaarnemingen van Nicolaas Cruquius, met een inleiding van Harry Geurts, KNMI\", a reprint of the \"Hoogheemraadschap van Rijnland\" (Dutch Waterboard agency) archive of the observations of Nicolaas Cruquius with a foreword by Harry Geurts of the Dutch Meteorological Institute KNMI, by Nicolaas Cruquius & Harry Geurts, Van Wijnen, Franeker,2006\n{{Commons category|Nicolaas Samuel Crucquius}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.museumdecruquius.nl Museum De Cruquius website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070808062308/http://www.knmi.nl/VinkCMS/explained_subject_detail.jsp?id=3807 Dutch Meteorological Institute (KNMI) website] Link with historical information about Cruquius (retrieved dec 2007)\n* [http://www.verkeerenwaterstaat.nl/kennisplein/1/9/197688/HistorischeWeerkundigeWaarnemingen_deel_IV.pdf Historische weerkundige waarnemingen, A.F.V. van Engelen en H.A.M.
