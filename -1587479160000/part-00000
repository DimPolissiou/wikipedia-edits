It is based on the ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' comic strip ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' and its eponymous character created by [[John Wagner]] and [[Carlos Ezquerra]]. [[Karl Urban]] stars as Judge Dredd, a law enforcer given the power of judge, jury and executioner in a vast, [[dystopia|dystopic]] metropolis called [[Mega-City One]] that lies in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] wasteland. Dredd and his apprentice partner, [[Judge Anderson]] ([[Olivia Thirlby]]), are forced to bring order to a 200-storey<!--British spelling of \"story\"--> high-rise block of [[apartment|flats]] and deal with its resident drug lord, Ma-Ma ([[Lena Headey]]).\n\nGarland began writing the script in 2006, although the development of a new ''Judge Dredd'' film adaptation, unrelated to the 1995 film ''[[Judge Dredd (film)|Judge Dredd]]'', was not announced until December 2008. Produced by British studio [[DNA Films]], ''Dredd'' began [[principal photography]], using [[3D film|3D]] cameras throughout, in November 2010. Filming took place on [[practical effect|practical]] sets and locations in [[Cape Town]] and [[Johannesburg]].\n\n''Dredd'' was released on 7 September 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 21 September worldwide. Critics were generally positive about the film's [[visual effects]], [[casting (performing arts)|casting]] and action, while criticism focused on excessive violence as well as a perceived lack of the [[satire|satirical]] elements that are found in the source comic. Despite the positive critical response, the film earned just over $41 million at the box office on an estimated budget of $30\u201345 million. ''Dredd'' saw greater success following its home release, and has since been recognised as a [[cult film]]. The theatrical gross made a sequel unlikely, but home media sales and fan efforts endorsed by ''2000 AD''{{'}}s publisher [[Rebellion Developments]] have maintained the possibility of a second film.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe future United States is a dystopic irradiated wasteland known as the Cursed Earth. On the east coast lies [[Mega-City One]], a violent metropolis with 800 million residents and 17,000 serious crimes reported daily. The only force for order are the [[Judge (2000 AD)|Judges]], who act as judge, jury and executioner. [[Judge Dredd]] is tasked by the Chief Judge with evaluating new recruit [[Judge Anderson|Cassandra Anderson]], a powerful psychic who marginally failed the aptitude tests to become a Judge.\n\nIn Peach Trees, a 200-storey<!--British spelling of \"story\"--> slum tower block, drug lord Madeline Madrigal, also known as \"Ma-Ma\", executes three rogue drug dealers by having them [[flaying|skinned alive]], infused with Slo-Mo (an addictive new drug which reduces the user's perception of time to 1% of normal) and thrown down the atrium from the top floor. Dredd and Anderson are sent in to investigate and learn of a drug den, which they raid. They arrest a thug named Kay, whom Anderson's mind probe reveals to be the one who carried out the drug dealers' executions. Dredd decides to take him in for questioning. In response, Ma-Ma's forces seize the tower's security control room and seal the building, using its blast shields under the pretence of a security test to prevent the Judges from leaving or summoning help.\n\nMa-Ma orders Dredd and Anderson killed, forcing the Judges to fight their way through dozens of armed thugs. Arriving at the 76th floor, the Judges are assaulted by Ma-Ma and her men with [[rotary cannons]] that rip through the walls, killing numerous residents. The Judges breach an outer wall and call for backup. Meanwhile, Ma-Ma sends her henchman Caleb to search for the Judges. When they meet, Dredd throws Caleb off the tower in full view of Ma-Ma.\n\nDredd suspects Ma-Ma is desperate to keep Kay quiet and beats him for information. Anderson reads Kay's mind and learns that Peach Trees is the centre of Slo-Mo production and distribution. Anderson suggests they hide while awaiting assistance, but Dredd insists they move up the tower and pursue Ma-Ma. Judges Volt and [[Judge Guthrie|Guthrie]] respond to Dredd's call, but Ma-Ma's computer expert denies them entry by persuading them the security system is malfunctioning. A pair of armed teens confront Dredd and Anderson, allowing Kay to disarm and overpower Anderson. Kay then escapes with her as hostage, and takes her to Ma-Ma's base on the top floor.\n\nWhile Dredd works his way towards Ma-Ma, she calls in the corrupt Judges Lex, Kaplan, Chan and Alvarez. The four relieve Volt and Guthrie from duty and are allowed into the building. Dredd encounters Chan and is suspicious that he does not ask about Anderson's status. Seeing his cover blown, Chan attacks Dredd, but is killed. Meanwhile, Kay tries to execute Anderson with her own weapon, but the pistol's [[biometric device|DNA scanner]] does not recognise him and explodes, taking his arm off. She escapes and later encounters Kaplan, whom she promptly kills after reading her mind. Elsewhere, Dredd kills Alvarez but runs out of ammunition. He is subsequently shot and injured by Lex, but Dredd stalls him long enough for Anderson to arrive and kill Lex.\n\nAnderson and Dredd obtain the code to Ma-Ma's apartment from her computer expert and confront her. Ma-Ma tells Dredd that, in the case of her death, a device on her wrist will detonate explosives on the top floors, destroying the building. Dredd reasons that the detonator's signal will not reach the explosives from the ground floor, so he forces Ma-Ma to inhale Slo-Mo and throws her down the atrium to her death.\n\nIn the aftermath, Anderson accepts that she has failed her evaluation by getting disarmed, and leaves. The Chief Judge asks Dredd about Anderson's performance; he responds that she has passed.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Olivia Thirlby 2012.jpg|thumb|[[Olivia Thirlby]] promoting the film at the 2012 [[Fantastic Fest]]]]\n* [[Karl Urban]] as [[Judge Dredd (character)|Dredd]]: <br />A famed and feared [[Judge (2000 AD)|Judge]].{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=2}} Producer Allon Reich described Dredd as \"an extreme character, and he administers justice with an extreme lack of prejudice\". Urban approached the producers about joining the film. He found the role challenging because the character never removes his helmet, requiring Urban to convey emotion without using his eyes. He viewed the character as an average man with an insanely tough job in a fragmenting society and likened Dredd's heroism to that of a fireman.{{Sfn|Production|2012|pp=7\u20139}} The role also demanded physical preparation; Urban undertook intensive physical training to become a \"beast of a man\".<ref name=\"ShaveMagazine\" /> He also underwent weapons and technical training to learn how to operate under fire, arrest criminals and breach doors. He insisted on performing his own motorcycle stunts for the film.

I tried to be true to that.\"|source=Alex Garland concerning writing Dredd's character.<ref name=\"2012Empire\" />|width=35%|}}\n\nGarland began writing ''Dredd'' during post-production of his other writing credit ''[[Sunshine (2007 film)|Sunshine]]'', and completed his first draft while serving as an executive producer during filming of ''[[28 Weeks Later]]''. Garland's draft revolved around one of Dredd's main enemies, the undead [[Judge Death]]. He described the story as a \"riff on the whole Judge system\", but that it did not work because the Judge system had not yet been established and required too much knowledge about the ''Judge Dredd'' comic from the audience. He also considered the end result too surreal and extreme. From this script, Garland decided that the story needed to be more focused and grounded. He instead considered adapting some of the notable Judge Dredd storylines, including \"[[Democracy (Judge Dredd storyline)|Democracy]]\" (1986) and \"[[Origins (Judge Dredd story)|Origins]]\" (2006). He decided to avoid these lengthy tales in favour of a shorter, day-in-the-life story about Dredd and his function as a cop in the dystopian environment of Mega-City One. When developing the Judge Dredd character, Garland tried to closely follow that of the comic-book character, who undergoes only small personality changes over a lengthy period of time. He said: \"I didn't think Dredd could have a great epiphany, but there is definitely a change in him over the course of the movie. He makes a very clear statement at the beginning of the film which he then contradicts at the end. That's about as far as the shift goes.\"<ref name=\"2012Empire\" /> Garland intentionally gave the traditional character development to Anderson to compensate for Dredd's character stability.<ref name=\"SequelSep12\" />\n\nDiscussing the film's setting within the Peach Tree Block tower, Garland said the buildings were \"like micro city states&nbsp;...&nbsp;you could live and die in those buildings\". He also considered that the setting met Wagner's suggestion that the future portrayed in ''Dredd'' should relate to modern ways of living. Garland named the tower after a restaurant called \"The Peach Tree\" in [[Shrewsbury]], England, where he first met with Wagner. The budget limited his ability to represent some of the comic aspects of Mega-City One, such as robots and aliens.<ref name=\"2012Empire\" /> Throughout the production, Garland would send his script to Wagner, who would revise some of the dialogue. Urban would then further revise the script during his performance.<ref name=\"2012Empire\" />\n\n=== Design ===\n[[File:Dredd (film) - Visual Effects.ogv|thumb|left|alt=A man fires a gun at another man raising his gun.

Alex Garland questioned if the effect could make the film's violence beautiful.<ref name=\"SequelSep12\" /><ref name=\"DesignSloMo\" /><ref name=\"FX\" />]]\n\nThe filmmakers decided that Dredd should appear lean and fast like a boxer rather than bulky like \"someone who spends hours sort of [[anabolic steroid|steroiding]] himself up.\" His Judge uniform was altered from the comic version; an extruded eagle statuette was removed from his shoulder pad to emphasise the outfit's functionality and give it a sense of realism.<ref name=\"2012Empire\" /> Garland said: \"If you did a very faithful adaptation of the uniform you'd have someone who if he got stabbed in the stomach he'd be in big trouble. Dredd is out there on the frontline so he needed protection.\"<ref name=\"SequelSep12\" /> Remaining faithful to the comic,<ref name=\"TheGuardian\" /> Dredd's face, except for his mouth, is never shown and his helmet is not removed throughout the film.<ref name=\"IgnSep2010\" /> Urban said: \"He is supposed to be the faceless representative of the law and I think that is part of his enigma&nbsp;...&nbsp;You wouldn't get to the end of a [[Sergio Leone]] Western and go, 'God, I didn't even know the character's name!' It's irrelevant.\"<ref name=\"Urbanquote\" />\n\nDredd's signature weapon, the \"[[Lawgiver (Judge Dredd)|Lawgiver]]\" was developed as a fully operational weapon based on a [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9mm firing system]], capable of firing ammunition and being changed from automatic to semi-auto fire.{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=9}} His motorcycle \"Lawmaster\" was a modified 500cc motorcycle. A large [[motorcycle fairing|fairing]] was added over the motorcycle with machine guns, an extended wheel base and the largest functional tyres possible. The vehicle was also operational and Urban insisted on riding it himself rather than relying on [[Chroma key]] visual effects. Wagner described the necessity of adaptation from the source material and said that the 1995 film's attempt to directly replicate the comic's  motorcycle was unable to steer because the tyres were too large.{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=9}}\n\nGarland and VFX supervisor [[Jon Thum]] began developing the Slo-Mo concept sequences in 2009 during filming for ''[[Never Let Me Go (2010 film)|Never Let Me Go]]''. They experimented with an effect to replicate the visual effects of [[hallucinogen]]ic drugs to see how long it could be used before it distracted the viewer from the story or action sequence. They continued to develop and modify the effect until the end of post-production, tweaking colours, colour saturation, image framing and camera motion.<ref name=\"SequelSep12\" /> Slo-Mo scenes also feature a rainbow colour scheme and sparkle highlights to create an unreal and otherworldly effect. The filmmakers experimented with blood bags, prosthetics, shooting real bullets, and compressed air to see the effect of direct body hits in slow motion. In the finished film, compressed air was used to create impact ripples on flesh.<ref name=\"FX\" /> Garland said the concept was inspired by nature documentaries that used high-speed photography to capture animals in slow motion. He said, \"You see a whale or a shark breach the water&nbsp;...&nbsp;then you'd stop thinking about the animal and you get transfixed by&nbsp;...&nbsp;how water droplets connect and touch against each other. Somehow like a real [drug] trip, sort of stepping outside it but staying attached at the same time.\" He questioned whether the technique could be used with violence to make it purely aesthetic. He said: \"Can it be so abstract that it becomes genuinely beautiful? ...really aesthetically beautiful even if someone is having their cheek blown out or their head crushing into concrete.\"<ref name=\"DesignSloMo\" /> Comic artist [[Jock (artist)|Jock]] provided concept art for the film design.<ref name=\"DevelopmentSep09\" /><ref name=\"Reelz3\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:Dredd-Film-City-View.jpg|thumb|Final art of the city by VFX art director Neil Miller; Peach Trees is on the left. The \"micro-city state\"-like towers were gradually positioned further apart to emphasise their size and allow for a more detailed city to exist between them, highlighting the scale of Mega-City One.]]\nWith a $45 million production budget, filming began on 12 November 2010 in Cape Town and took approximately 13 weeks, with [[second unit]] photography occurring over seven weeks.<ref name=\"VarietySep2010\" /><ref name=\"VarietyNov2010\" /><ref name=\"BSCine\" /> Filming locations included Johannesburg and Cape Town Film Studios (''Dredd'' was the first project filmed at the studio).{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=31}}<ref name=\"DevTime\" /> The project involved a majority of Cape Town crew members and about 40 imported crew. The producers chose to film in South Africa because of the lowered cost of employing cast and crew compared to locations in Europe and North America, and government incentives that offered to rebate up to 25% of the production costs.<ref name=\"DevTime\" /> The film was shot [[digital cinematography|digitally]] and primarily in 3D using [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|RED MX]], SI2K and Phantom Flex high-speed cameras for the Slo-Mo sequences, producing 4,000 frames per second. Multiple camera rigs were used.<ref name=\"BSCine\" /><ref name=\"EmpireSep2010\" /> Some 2D elements were converted to 3D in post-production.<ref name=\"Pf3df\" /><ref name=\"ColliderFrames\" />\n\nDNA Films' co-founder Andrew Macdonald engaged cinematographer [[Anthony Dod Mantle]] to manage the shoot; it was the first time Mantle had worked with 3D.<ref name=\"BSCine\" />{{Sfn|Production|2012|pp=12\u201313}} The filmmakers wanted ''Dredd'' to have a realistic, visceral look, and drew inspiration from crime and gangster films. For scenes conveying the time and space altering effects of Slo-Mo, Mantle aimed to create images that would be beautiful but disorienting.{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=13}}\n\nMega-City One and its high rise towers were created in Cape Town Film Studios. Finding a suitable set for the expansive Peach Trees atrium proved difficult, and the producers did not want to build an expensive set. While observing scouting photos of Cape Town, the filmmakers noticed a large three-walled external space that looked like an interior when filmed at night. A key sequence involving Ma-Ma and her gang firing [[rotary cannon]]s across the atrium in their attempt to kill Judge Dredd required ten days of filming and eight different sets inside and outside the studio which were blended together with visual effects.{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=13}} Visual effects supervisor Jon Thum was unable to accompany a helicopter flight to obtain planned aerial shots of Johannesburg due to last-minute flight permissions; the resulting shots were non-specific and Thum had to pick out ones that could tell the story.<ref name=\"FX\" /> Mantle had to develop new rigs to obtain close-up shots. Describing the aesthetic he aimed to achieve, he said: \"I hope it will be more painterly. If we get it right, it will be a cross between ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|Clockwork Orange]]''.\"<ref name=\"BSCine\" /> Garland was a constant presence on the shoot; Urban turned to Garland for direction instead of Travis.<ref name=\"FilmingGarland\" />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nThe filmmakers experimented with the visuals of Mega-City One, including the design and positioning of the city's tower blocks, to create the impression that the city had risen out of the remains of another. They found that replicating the comic visuals of blocks close together made the blocks appear small. Instead they allowed more space between the buildings to emphasise the larger buildings and allow for the presence of roads and cars to allow for extrapolation outside of the picture. Outcrops and appendages were added to break up the buildings' straight lines.<ref name=\"SequelSep12\" /><ref name=\"FX\" /> On 7 October 2011, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that Travis was prohibited from participating in the editing process following creative disagreements between producers and executives. Garland took over the editing process; his contribution was considered significant enough for him to seek a co-director credit\u2014a situation considered unusual as Garland had never directed a film before and had not been in charge of any filming. The disagreement concerned a disapproval over the footage that Travis was providing. Although Travis was removed from the editing process, he was monitoring the progress of the film. On 10 October, Travis and Garland released a joint statement claiming that they had agreed on an \"unorthodox collaboration\" before production began, that Travis was still involved in the film and that Garland was not seeking a co-director credit.<ref name=\"PPContro\" /> In March 2018, Urban said that he believed ''Dredd'' should be considered Garland's directorial debut.<ref name=\"GarlandDirector\" />\n\n== Music ==\n{{Listen|filename=Dredd - Ma Ma's Requiem Sample.ogg|title=\"Ma-Ma's Requiem\"|description=Tracks matching the slow motion visuals of the film were composed with real instruments before being slowed down hundreds of times (0:21).|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n[[Paul Leonard-Morgan]] wrote the film's [[industrial music]] score.<ref name=\"Music1\" /><ref name=\"Music2\" /> Leonard-Morgan created music to suit the film's futuristic setting. He experimented with band-based music, but decided it sounded over-produced and too safe. He turned to electronic music and used 1980s-style synthesisers and modern sound modules to create various combinations and applied distortion and other effects to the result. Leonard-Morgan said, \"I was looking to create a timeless score which couldn't be placed in any particular era. So it's ended up being a cross between a modern dance track and evocative soundscapes.\" For scenes conveying the effect of the Slo-Mo narcotic, he composed new music with real instruments and then slowed the songs down hundreds of times to match the visuals, such that one second of his composed score could last ten minutes (slowed to 0.17% of original). He then added additional real-time score to the slowed track.<ref name=\"Music3\" />\n\nAn unofficially altered [[Justin Bieber]] song served as inspiration for the Slo-Mo theme. Garland said that [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]] instrumentalist [[Geoff Barrow]] \"sent me a link to a Justin Bieber song slowed down 800 times and it became this stunning trippy choral music.\" Morgan recreated the effect based on the modified track, which was used in the finished film. The film used Bieber's music as a [[temp track|temporary placeholder]] during editing before the score was finalised.<ref name=\"MusicBieber\" />\n\nThe film also features songs by artists including: \"Poison Lips\" by [[Vitalic]]; \"Dubstride\" by Yann McCullough and Gemma Kicks; \"Snuffbox\" by [[Matt Berry]]; \"Pontiac Moon\" by Robert J.

Hewitt also called Thirlby's Anderson engaging and wrote that the film is \"a solid, occasionally excellent take on [Judge Dredd], with Urban's chin particularly impressive.\"<ref name=\"RevEmpire\" /> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Geoff Berkshire said the film is \"Grim, gritty and ultra-violent\", called Dredd a \"badass of few words\", and wrote that Urban \"does a fine job embodying the more mythic qualities of Dredd as an upright law enforcer no lowlife would want to confront.\" He also praised Thirlby for carrying the film's emotional story and said, \"one of the film's true thrills comes in watching Thirlby effortlessly balance the conflict between a Judge's merciless duties and a psychic's compassionate understanding.\"<ref name=\"RevVariety\" />\n\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Darren Franich said that the film is a \"darkly funny blood-soaked romp\" and singled out Urban for his \"credibly wry performance using little more than his gravelly, imitation-[[Clint Eastwood|[Clint] Eastwood]] voice\u2014and his chin.\"<ref name=\"RevEW\" /> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Phelim O'Neill scored the film 4 stars out of 5 and praised Urban's performance, saying, \"The essence of Dredd is that he is almost an anti-character\u2014he doesn't change or learn\u2014and Urban nails it in an ego-free performance\". He also wrote, \"In a world of compromised adaptations, ''Dredd'' is something of a triumph.\"<ref name=\"RevGuardian\" /> The ''[[New Statesman]]''{{'}}s Laura Sneddon noted that ''Dredd'' passed the [[Bechdel test]], lacking in sexism or misogyny and positively portraying female characters who are no weaker, more sexualised or shown less than their male counterparts.

Berkshire said that they are notable and eye-catching with \"impressively utilised 3D.\"<ref name=\"RevVariety\" /> Hewitt said the visuals were \"genuinely surreal splashes of heightened colour that&nbsp;...&nbsp;don't outstay their welcome. The film's use of 3D is often excellent (including the credits) and it really comes to life in the Slo-mo scenes\".<ref name=\"RevEmpire\" /> Dalton said the film \"constantly impresses on a visual level, with a gritty style more akin to cult hits like ''[[District 9]]'' or ''[[28 Days Later]]'' than to standard Hollywood comic-book blockbusters.\" Dalton said, \"[Mantle's] first venture into 3D is a blaze of saturated colours, gorgeous high-resolution close-ups and dazzling slow-motion sequences.\"<ref name=\"RevTHR\" /> ''Dredd'' won ''The Art of 3D'' award at the 2013 [[Empire Awards]], and was nominated for ''Best British Film'' and ''Best Science-fiction/Fantasy''.<ref name=\"AccoEmpire\" />\n\n''Judge Dredd'' creator John Wagner, who had been critical of the 1995 adaptation, gave a positive review of ''Dredd''.

It is based on the ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' comic strip ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' and its eponymous character created by [[John Wagner]] and [[Carlos Ezquerra]]. [[Karl Urban]] stars as Judge Dredd, a law enforcer given the power of judge, jury and executioner in a vast, [[dystopia|dystopic]] metropolis called [[Mega-City One]] that lies in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] wasteland. Dredd and his apprentice partner, [[Judge Anderson]] ([[Olivia Thirlby]]), are forced to bring order to a 200-storey<!--British spelling of \"story\"--> high-rise block of [[apartment|flats]] and deal with its resident drug lord, Ma-Ma ([[Lena Headey]]).\n\nGarland began writing the script in 2006, although the development of a new ''Judge Dredd'' film adaptation, unrelated to the 1995 film ''[[Judge Dredd (film)|Judge Dredd]]'', was not announced until December 2008. Produced by British studio [[DNA Films]], ''Dredd'' began [[principal photography]], using [[3D film|3D]] cameras throughout, in November 2010. Filming took place on [[practical effect|practical]] sets and locations in [[Cape Town]] and [[Johannesburg]].\n\n''Dredd'' was released on 7 September 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 21 September worldwide. Critics were generally positive about the film's [[visual effects]], [[casting (performing arts)|casting]] and action, while criticism focused on excessive violence as well as a perceived lack of the [[satire|satirical]] elements that are found in the source comic. Despite the positive critical response, the film earned just over $41 million at the box office on an estimated budget of $30\u201345 million. ''Dredd'' saw greater success following its home release, and has since been recognised as a [[cult film]]. The theatrical gross made a sequel unlikely, but home media sales and fan efforts endorsed by ''2000 AD''{{'}}s publisher [[Rebellion Developments]] have maintained the possibility of a second film.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe future United States is a dystopic irradiated wasteland known as the Cursed Earth. On the east coast lies [[Mega-City One]], a violent metropolis with 800 million residents and 17,000 serious crimes reported daily. The only force for order are the [[Judge (2000 AD)|Judges]], who act as judge, jury and executioner. [[Judge Dredd]] is tasked by the Chief Judge with evaluating new recruit [[Judge Anderson|Cassandra Anderson]], a powerful psychic who marginally failed the aptitude tests to become a Judge.\n\nIn Peach Trees, a 200-storey<!--British spelling of \"story\"--> slum tower block, drug lord Madeline Madrigal, also known as \"Ma-Ma\", executes three rogue drug dealers by having them [[flaying|skinned alive]], infused with Slo-Mo (an addictive new drug which reduces the user's perception of time to 1% of normal) and thrown down the atrium from the top floor. Dredd and Anderson are sent in to investigate and learn of a drug den, which they raid. They arrest a thug named Kay, whom Anderson's mind probe reveals to be the one who carried out the drug dealers' executions. Dredd decides to take him in for questioning. In response, Ma-Ma's forces seize the tower's security control room and seal the building, using its blast shields under the pretence of a security test to prevent the Judges from leaving or summoning help.\n\nMa-Ma orders Dredd and Anderson killed, forcing the Judges to fight their way through dozens of armed thugs. Arriving at the 76th floor, the Judges are assaulted by Ma-Ma and her men with [[rotary cannons]] that rip through the walls, killing numerous residents. The Judges breach an outer wall and call for backup. Meanwhile, Ma-Ma sends her henchman Caleb to search for the Judges. When they meet, Dredd throws Caleb off the tower in full view of Ma-Ma.\n\nDredd suspects Ma-Ma is desperate to keep Kay quiet and beats him for information. Anderson reads Kay's mind and learns that Peach Trees is the centre of Slo-Mo production and distribution. Anderson suggests they hide while awaiting assistance, but Dredd insists they move up the tower and pursue Ma-Ma. Judges Volt and [[Judge Guthrie|Guthrie]] respond to Dredd's call, but Ma-Ma's computer expert denies them entry by persuading them the security system is malfunctioning. A pair of armed teens confront Dredd and Anderson, allowing Kay to disarm and overpower Anderson. Kay then escapes with her as hostage, and takes her to Ma-Ma's base on the top floor.\n\nWhile Dredd works his way towards Ma-Ma, she calls in the corrupt Judges Lex, Kaplan, Chan and Alvarez. The four relieve Volt and Guthrie from duty and are allowed into the building. Dredd encounters Chan and is suspicious that he does not ask about Anderson's status. Seeing his cover blown, Chan attacks Dredd, but is killed. Meanwhile, Kay tries to execute Anderson with her own weapon, but the pistol's [[biometric device|DNA scanner]] does not recognise him and explodes, taking his arm off. She escapes and later encounters Kaplan, whom she promptly kills after reading her mind. Elsewhere, Dredd kills Alvarez but runs out of ammunition. He is subsequently shot and injured by Lex, but Dredd stalls him long enough for Anderson to arrive and kill Lex.\n\nAnderson and Dredd obtain the code to Ma-Ma's apartment from her computer expert and confront her. Ma-Ma tells Dredd that, in the case of her death, a device on her wrist will detonate explosives on the top floors, destroying the building. Dredd reasons that the detonator's signal will not reach the explosives from the ground floor, so he forces Ma-Ma to inhale Slo-Mo and throws her down the atrium to her death.\n\nIn the aftermath, Anderson accepts that she has failed her evaluation by getting disarmed, and leaves. The Chief Judge asks Dredd about Anderson's performance; he responds that she has passed.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Olivia Thirlby 2012.jpg|thumb|[[Olivia Thirlby]] promoting the film at the 2012 [[Fantastic Fest]]]]\n* [[Karl Urban]] as [[Judge Dredd (character)|Dredd]]: <br />A famed and feared [[Judge (2000 AD)|Judge]].{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=2}} Producer Allon Reich described Dredd as \"an extreme character, and he administers justice with an extreme lack of prejudice\". Urban approached the producers about joining the film. He found the role challenging because the character never removes his helmet, requiring Urban to convey emotion without using his eyes. He viewed the character as an average man with an insanely tough job in a fragmenting society and likened Dredd's heroism to that of a fireman.{{Sfn|Production|2012|pp=7\u20139}} The role also demanded physical preparation; Urban undertook intensive physical training to become a \"beast of a man\".<ref name=\"ShaveMagazine\" /> He also underwent weapons and technical training to learn how to operate under fire, arrest criminals and breach doors. He insisted on performing his own motorcycle stunts for the film. He played Dredd with a raspy and harsh vocal tone akin to \"a saw cutting through bone\", which he found difficult to sustain.{{Sfn|Production|2012|pp=7\u20139}}\n* [[Olivia Thirlby]] as [[Judge Anderson|Cassandra Anderson]]: <br />A rookie Judge and genetic mutant with powerful psychic abilities.{{Sfn|Production|2012|pp=3\u20134}} Anderson can sense the thoughts and emotions of others.{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=11}} Thirlby contrasted her character with Dredd's \"black and white\" perspective, describing Anderson as existing \"in a grey area where everything is enhanced or clouded by the fact [that] she knows what is going on in the very interior of a person\". She undertook weapons and combat training, learning to perform a [[roundhouse kick]] to make her believably physically commanding. The character was partially inspired by singer [[Debbie Harry]].{{Sfn|Production|2012|pp=10\u201311}}\n* [[Lena Headey]] as Madeline \"Ma-Ma\" Madrigal: <br />A former prostitute turned drug lord and criminal kingpin who is the sole supplier of Slo-Mo, a new and addictive drug.{{Sfn|Production|2012|pp=3,11}} Headey's performance was inspired by punk-rock singer [[Patti Smith]]. Reich described the character as someone who does \"not care at all about what anybody thinks or feels and she will do, and behave, as she wants\".{{Sfn|Production|2012|pp=11\u201312}} Headey said: \"I think of [Ma-Ma] like an old great white shark who is just waiting for someone bigger and stronger to show up and kill her&nbsp;...&nbsp;she's ready for it. In fact, she can't wait for it to happen&nbsp;...&nbsp;She's an addict, so she's dead in that way, but that last knock just hasn't come.\"<ref name=\"CastHeadey\" /> Before Headey's casting, the character was described as a heavily made-up, scarred and obese older woman.<ref name=\"2011JanPlaylist\" /><ref name=\"Marketing1\" />\n* [[Wood Harris]] as Kay: <br />Ma-Ma's clansman.{{Sfn|Production|2012|pp=3,16}} Harris described the character as a villain, but one that sees himself as no worse than the Judges.

''Dredd'' also features Junior Singo as Amos and Luke Tyler as Freel, young boys who confront Dredd; [[Jason Cope]] as Zwirner, the thug executed by Dredd during the opening scene; Joe Vaz as Big Joe, the thug that leads the confrontation outside of the med station; Scott Sparrow as Japhet, Anderson's first execution; and Nicole Bailey as Cathy, Japhet's wife, in whose apartment the Judges take refuge.{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=2, 20}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nDevelopment of the film was announced on 20 December 2008, although writer [[Alex Garland]] had begun working on the script in 2006.<ref name=\"2012Empire\" /> British studio [[DNA Films]] produced the film, and partnered with sales agency [[IM Global]] to sell the worldwide distribution rights.<ref name=\"DevelopmentDec08\" /><ref name=\"SequelSep12\" /> By May 2010, this partnership saw IM Global and its owner [[Reliance Entertainment|Reliance Big Pictures]] agree to co-finance the [[3D film|3-D]] project with a $45 million production budget, and a schedule to begin filming in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa in late 2010.<ref name=\"Development1\" /><ref name=\"Development2\" /> [[Pete Travis]] was named as the film's director and Garland, [[Andrew Macdonald (producer)|Andrew Macdonald]] and Allon Reich would produce it.<ref name=\"Development2\" /><ref name=\"DevelopmentJul1\" /> [[Duncan Jones]] had previously been offered the role of director.<ref name=\"Reelz4\" /> In a 2010 interview, Jones said that his vision for the film was unconventional\u2014describing it as weird, dark, and funny\u2014and it did not mesh well with Garland's script.<ref name=\"DevJones\" /> In September 2010, it was reported that the film would be titled ''Dredd''.<ref name=\"DevelopmentSep10\" />\n\n[[Pre-production]] commenced on 23 August 2010 at Cape Town Film Studios in [[Cape Town]], South Africa.<ref name=\"ReelzChannel\" /> During the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] in July, Urban confirmed that he had been offered the role of Judge Dredd, and on 18 August 2010, it was reported that Urban officially had the role.<ref name=\"VarietyAug2010\" /> In September 2010, it was announced that Thirlby would play Dredd's telepathic rookie Cassandra Anderson.<ref name=\"VarietySep2010\" /> In the same month during the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], the film attracted $30 million in worldwide pre-sales to distributors in 90% of theatrical markets.<ref name=\"DevelopmentSep10B\" /><ref name=\"GuardianSep2010\" /> The sales included a $7 million deal with British distributor [[Entertainment Film Distributors]].\n\nOn 2 November 2010, [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] secured the North American distribution rights to ''Dredd''.<ref name=\"VarietyNov2010\" /> Headey joined the cast as drug-dealer Ma-Ma in January 2011.<ref name=\"2011JanPlaylist\" /> ''Judge Dredd'' creator [[John Wagner]] acted as a consultant on the film.<ref name=\"TheGuardian\" /> In 2012, he confirmed that it was a new adaptation of the comic material and was not a remake of the 1995 adaptation ''[[Judge Dredd (film)|Judge Dredd]]'', which starred [[Sylvester Stallone]].<ref name=\"2012Empire\" />\n\n=== Writing ===\n{{quote box|quote=\"...what John [Wagner] does [in the comic] is have Dredd evolve, in the way that a glacier moves: you look a year later and something actually has shifted! I tried to be true to that.\"|source=Alex Garland concerning writing Dredd's character.<ref name=\"2012Empire\" />|width=35%|}}\n\nGarland began writing ''Dredd'' during post-production of his other writing credit ''[[Sunshine (2007 film)|Sunshine]]'', and completed his first draft while serving as an executive producer during filming of ''[[28 Weeks Later]]''. Garland's draft revolved around one of Dredd's main enemies, the undead [[Judge Death]]. He described the story as a \"riff on the whole Judge system\", but that it did not work because the Judge system had not yet been established and required too much knowledge about the ''Judge Dredd'' comic from the audience. He also considered the end result too surreal and extreme. From this script, Garland decided that the story needed to be more focused and grounded. He instead considered adapting some of the notable Judge Dredd storylines, including \"[[Democracy (Judge Dredd storyline)|Democracy]]\" (1986) and \"[[Origins (Judge Dredd story)|Origins]]\" (2006). He decided to avoid these lengthy tales in favour of a shorter, day-in-the-life story about Dredd and his function as a cop in the dystopian environment of Mega-City One. When developing the Judge Dredd character, Garland tried to closely follow that of the comic-book character, who undergoes only small personality changes over a lengthy period of time. He said: \"I didn't think Dredd could have a great epiphany, but there is definitely a change in him over the course of the movie. He makes a very clear statement at the beginning of the film which he then contradicts at the end. That's about as far as the shift goes.\"<ref name=\"2012Empire\" /> Garland intentionally gave the traditional character development to Anderson to compensate for Dredd's character stability.<ref name=\"SequelSep12\" />\n\nDiscussing the film's setting within the Peach Tree Block tower, Garland said the buildings were \"like micro city states&nbsp;...&nbsp;you could live and die in those buildings\". He also considered that the setting met Wagner's suggestion that the future portrayed in ''Dredd'' should relate to modern ways of living. Garland named the tower after a restaurant called \"The Peach Tree\" in [[Shrewsbury]], England, where he first met with Wagner. The budget limited his ability to represent some of the comic aspects of Mega-City One, such as robots and aliens.<ref name=\"2012Empire\" /> Throughout the production, Garland would send his script to Wagner, who would revise some of the dialogue. Urban would then further revise the script during his performance.<ref name=\"2012Empire\" />\n\n=== Design ===\n[[File:Dredd (film) - Visual Effects.ogv|thumb|left|alt=A man fires a gun at another man raising his gun. The bullet enters one side of the man's face and erupts out of the other, sending blood towards the camera. The scene plays entirely in slow motion.|The Slo-Mo sequences were designed over several years with the intention of replicating the effects of hallucinogenic drugs, combining high-speed photography and colour saturation. Alex Garland questioned if the effect could make the film's violence beautiful.<ref name=\"SequelSep12\" /><ref name=\"DesignSloMo\" /><ref name=\"FX\" />]]\n\nThe filmmakers decided that Dredd should appear lean and fast like a boxer rather than bulky like \"someone who spends hours sort of [[anabolic steroid|steroiding]] himself up.\" His Judge uniform was altered from the comic version; an extruded eagle statuette was removed from his shoulder pad to emphasise the outfit's functionality and give it a sense of realism.<ref name=\"2012Empire\" /> Garland said: \"If you did a very faithful adaptation of the uniform you'd have someone who if he got stabbed in the stomach he'd be in big trouble. Dredd is out there on the frontline so he needed protection.\"<ref name=\"SequelSep12\" /> Remaining faithful to the comic,<ref name=\"TheGuardian\" /> Dredd's face, except for his mouth, is never shown and his helmet is not removed throughout the film.<ref name=\"IgnSep2010\" /> Urban said: \"He is supposed to be the faceless representative of the law and I think that is part of his enigma&nbsp;...&nbsp;You wouldn't get to the end of a [[Sergio Leone]] Western and go, 'God, I didn't even know the character's name!' It's irrelevant.\"<ref name=\"Urbanquote\" />\n\nDredd's signature weapon, the \"[[Lawgiver (Judge Dredd)|Lawgiver]]\" was developed as a fully operational weapon based on a [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9mm firing system]], capable of firing ammunition and being changed from automatic to semi-auto fire.{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=9}} His motorcycle \"Lawmaster\" was a modified 500cc motorcycle. A large [[motorcycle fairing|fairing]] was added over the motorcycle with machine guns, an extended wheel base and the largest functional tyres possible. The vehicle was also operational and Urban insisted on riding it himself rather than relying on [[Chroma key]] visual effects. Wagner described the necessity of adaptation from the source material and said that the 1995 film's attempt to directly replicate the comic's  motorcycle was unable to steer because the tyres were too large.{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=9}}\n\nGarland and VFX supervisor [[Jon Thum]] began developing the Slo-Mo concept sequences in 2009 during filming for ''[[Never Let Me Go (2010 film)|Never Let Me Go]]''. They experimented with an effect to replicate the visual effects of [[hallucinogen]]ic drugs to see how long it could be used before it distracted the viewer from the story or action sequence. They continued to develop and modify the effect until the end of post-production, tweaking colours, colour saturation, image framing and camera motion.<ref name=\"SequelSep12\" /> Slo-Mo scenes also feature a rainbow colour scheme and sparkle highlights to create an unreal and otherworldly effect. The filmmakers experimented with blood bags, prosthetics, shooting real bullets, and compressed air to see the effect of direct body hits in slow motion. In the finished film, compressed air was used to create impact ripples on flesh.<ref name=\"FX\" /> Garland said the concept was inspired by nature documentaries that used high-speed photography to capture animals in slow motion. He said, \"You see a whale or a shark breach the water&nbsp;...&nbsp;then you'd stop thinking about the animal and you get transfixed by&nbsp;...&nbsp;how water droplets connect and touch against each other. Somehow like a real [drug] trip, sort of stepping outside it but staying attached at the same time.\" He questioned whether the technique could be used with violence to make it purely aesthetic. He said: \"Can it be so abstract that it becomes genuinely beautiful? ...really aesthetically beautiful even if someone is having their cheek blown out or their head crushing into concrete.\"<ref name=\"DesignSloMo\" /> Comic artist [[Jock (artist)|Jock]] provided concept art for the film design.<ref name=\"DevelopmentSep09\" /><ref name=\"Reelz3\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:Dredd-Film-City-View.jpg|thumb|Final art of the city by VFX art director Neil Miller; Peach Trees is on the left. The \"micro-city state\"-like towers were gradually positioned further apart to emphasise their size and allow for a more detailed city to exist between them, highlighting the scale of Mega-City One.]]\nWith a $45 million production budget, filming began on 12 November 2010 in Cape Town and took approximately 13 weeks, with [[second unit]] photography occurring over seven weeks.<ref name=\"VarietySep2010\" /><ref name=\"VarietyNov2010\" /><ref name=\"BSCine\" /> Filming locations included Johannesburg and Cape Town Film Studios (''Dredd'' was the first project filmed at the studio).{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=31}}<ref name=\"DevTime\" /> The project involved a majority of Cape Town crew members and about 40 imported crew. The producers chose to film in South Africa because of the lowered cost of employing cast and crew compared to locations in Europe and North America, and government incentives that offered to rebate up to 25% of the production costs.<ref name=\"DevTime\" /> The film was shot [[digital cinematography|digitally]] and primarily in 3D using [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|RED MX]], SI2K and Phantom Flex high-speed cameras for the Slo-Mo sequences, producing 4,000 frames per second. Multiple camera rigs were used.<ref name=\"BSCine\" /><ref name=\"EmpireSep2010\" /> Some 2D elements were converted to 3D in post-production.<ref name=\"Pf3df\" /><ref name=\"ColliderFrames\" />\n\nDNA Films' co-founder Andrew Macdonald engaged cinematographer [[Anthony Dod Mantle]] to manage the shoot; it was the first time Mantle had worked with 3D.<ref name=\"BSCine\" />{{Sfn|Production|2012|pp=12\u201313}} The filmmakers wanted ''Dredd'' to have a realistic, visceral look, and drew inspiration from crime and gangster films. For scenes conveying the time and space altering effects of Slo-Mo, Mantle aimed to create images that would be beautiful but disorienting.{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=13}}\n\nMega-City One and its high rise towers were created in Cape Town Film Studios. Finding a suitable set for the expansive Peach Trees atrium proved difficult, and the producers did not want to build an expensive set. While observing scouting photos of Cape Town, the filmmakers noticed a large three-walled external space that looked like an interior when filmed at night. A key sequence involving Ma-Ma and her gang firing [[rotary cannon]]s across the atrium in their attempt to kill Judge Dredd required ten days of filming and eight different sets inside and outside the studio which were blended together with visual effects.{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=13}} Visual effects supervisor Jon Thum was unable to accompany a helicopter flight to obtain planned aerial shots of Johannesburg due to last-minute flight permissions; the resulting shots were non-specific and Thum had to pick out ones that could tell the story.<ref name=\"FX\" /> Mantle had to develop new rigs to obtain close-up shots. Describing the aesthetic he aimed to achieve, he said: \"I hope it will be more painterly. If we get it right, it will be a cross between ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|Clockwork Orange]]''.\"<ref name=\"BSCine\" /> Garland was a constant presence on the shoot; Urban turned to Garland for direction instead of Travis.<ref name=\"FilmingGarland\" />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nThe filmmakers experimented with the visuals of Mega-City One, including the design and positioning of the city's tower blocks, to create the impression that the city had risen out of the remains of another. They found that replicating the comic visuals of blocks close together made the blocks appear small. Instead they allowed more space between the buildings to emphasise the larger buildings and allow for the presence of roads and cars to allow for extrapolation outside of the picture. Outcrops and appendages were added to break up the buildings' straight lines.<ref name=\"SequelSep12\" /><ref name=\"FX\" /> On 7 October 2011, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that Travis was prohibited from participating in the editing process following creative disagreements between producers and executives. Garland took over the editing process; his contribution was considered significant enough for him to seek a co-director credit\u2014a situation considered unusual as Garland had never directed a film before and had not been in charge of any filming. The disagreement concerned a disapproval over the footage that Travis was providing. Although Travis was removed from the editing process, he was monitoring the progress of the film. On 10 October, Travis and Garland released a joint statement claiming that they had agreed on an \"unorthodox collaboration\" before production began, that Travis was still involved in the film and that Garland was not seeking a co-director credit.<ref name=\"PPContro\" /> In March 2018, Urban said that he believed ''Dredd'' should be considered Garland's directorial debut.<ref name=\"GarlandDirector\" />\n\n== Music ==\n{{Listen|filename=Dredd - Ma Ma's Requiem Sample.ogg|title=\"Ma-Ma's Requiem\"|description=Tracks matching the slow motion visuals of the film were composed with real instruments before being slowed down by thousands of percent (0:21).|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n[[Paul Leonard-Morgan]] wrote the film's [[industrial music]] score.<ref name=\"Music1\" /><ref name=\"Music2\" /> Leonard-Morgan created music to suit the film's futuristic setting. He experimented with band-based music, but decided it sounded over-produced and too safe. He turned to electronic music and used 1980s-style synthesisers and modern sound modules to create various combinations and applied distortion and other effects to the result. Leonard-Morgan said, \"I was looking to create a timeless score which couldn't be placed in any particular era. So it's ended up being a cross between a modern dance track and evocative soundscapes.\" For scenes conveying the effect of the Slo-Mo narcotic, he composed new music with real instruments and then slowed the songs down by thousandths of a percent to match the visuals, such that one second of his composed score could last ten minutes (slowed to 0.17% of original). He then added additional real-time score to the slowed track.<ref name=\"Music3\" />\n\nAn unofficially altered [[Justin Bieber]] song served as inspiration for the Slo-Mo theme. Garland said that [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]] instrumentalist [[Geoff Barrow]] \"sent me a link to a Justin Bieber song slowed down 800 times and it became this stunning trippy choral music.\" Morgan recreated the effect based on the modified track, which was used in the finished film. The film used Bieber's music as a [[temp track|temporary placeholder]] during editing before the score was finalised.<ref name=\"MusicBieber\" />\n\nThe film also features songs by artists including: \"Poison Lips\" by [[Vitalic]]; \"Dubstride\" by Yann McCullough and Gemma Kicks; \"Snuffbox\" by [[Matt Berry]]; \"Pontiac Moon\" by Robert J.

The website's critical consensus reads, \"Fueled by bombastic violence and impressive special effects, rooted in self-satire and deadpan humor, ''Dredd 3D'' does a remarkable job of capturing its source material's gritty spirit.\"<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\" /> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 60 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref name=\"Metacritic\" /> [[CinemaScore]] polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a \"B\" on a scale of A+ to F.<ref name=\"BONA2\" />\n\nAt its premiere screening at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International, ''Dredd'' received positive reviews.<ref name=\"RevSDCC\" /> [[IGN]] awarded the film eight out of ten and said, \"''Dredd'' is a character study, primarily, one fuelled by violence and action, and we can't think of a better way to re-introduce this character to cinema audiences.\"<ref name=\"RevIGN\" /> [[Indiewire]] said, \"As Dredd, Urban either has a better character to play than [Sylvester Stallone] did, or simply has a better grasp on what makes him tick, but the actor continues to distinguish himself as a versatile performer who turns mimicry into emotional meaning.\"<ref name=\"RevIndie\" /> ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''{{'}}s Chris Hewitt scored the film three out of five stars, and said it gets the lead character \"absolutely, incontrovertibly right\" and that Urban's Dredd is \"a deadpan delight\u2014he doesn't grow as a person and he doesn't crack wise&nbsp;...&nbsp;the movie generates its few laughs from his sheer intractability\". Hewitt also called Thirlby's Anderson engaging and wrote that the film is \"a solid, occasionally excellent take on [Judge Dredd], with Urban's chin particularly impressive.\"<ref name=\"RevEmpire\" /> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Geoff Berkshire said the film is \"Grim, gritty and ultra-violent\", called Dredd a \"badass of few words\", and wrote that Urban \"does a fine job embodying the more mythic qualities of Dredd as an upright law enforcer no lowlife would want to confront.\" He also praised Thirlby for carrying the film's emotional story and said, \"one of the film's true thrills comes in watching Thirlby effortlessly balance the conflict between a Judge's merciless duties and a psychic's compassionate understanding.\"<ref name=\"RevVariety\" />\n\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Darren Franich said that the film is a \"darkly funny blood-soaked romp\" and singled out Urban for his \"credibly wry performance using little more than his gravelly, imitation-[[Clint Eastwood|[Clint] Eastwood]] voice\u2014and his chin.\"<ref name=\"RevEW\" /> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Phelim O'Neill scored the film 4 stars out of 5 and praised Urban's performance, saying, \"The essence of Dredd is that he is almost an anti-character\u2014he doesn't change or learn\u2014and Urban nails it in an ego-free performance\". He also wrote, \"In a world of compromised adaptations, ''Dredd'' is something of a triumph.\"<ref name=\"RevGuardian\" /> The ''[[New Statesman]]''{{'}}s Laura Sneddon noted that ''Dredd'' passed the [[Bechdel test]], lacking in sexism or misogyny and positively portraying female characters who are no weaker, more sexualised or shown less than their male counterparts. Sneddon described Anderson as repeatedly shown to have power over men who underestimate her, while Ma-Ma displays more intelligence and sadism than any of her male gang members, and neither woman interacts with the other on the basis of their gender.<ref name=\"RevStatesman\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Stephen Dalton wrote that the \"dark, ironic, very British humour of the original strip\" was largely absent from the film and that \"[t]he limited location, computer game-style plot and muted humour\" of the film might disappoint some fans of the comic. Dalton also said that Urban's performance, while close to the comic, lacked something. Overall Dalton said, \"[p]itched at the right level to please original fans, but still slick and accessible enough to attract new ones, [Dredd] feels like a smart and muscular addition to the sci-fi action genre.\"<ref name=\"RevTHR\" />\n\nMany US newspaper critics were less taken with the film. Mark Olsen of the ''Los Angeles Times'' called it \"a clunk-headed action picture\" that \"simply becomes a monotonous series of bad-guy confrontations.\"<ref name=\"RevLATimes\" /> [[Frank Lovece]] of ''[[Newsday]]'' described it as a \"soullessly gritty\" film, which apart from one believable scene involving Thirlby, is \"all tough-guy talk and humorless cynicism\".<ref name=\"RevNewsDay\" /> [[Kyle Smith]] of the ''[[New York Post]]'', who found the police tactics distasteful, wrote, \"Justice is supposed to be blind, but in this case I think what the Law really wants is unaccountability\" and called ''Dredd'' a \"thudding, repetitive movie\". He also wrote, \"It's not that the movie is in bad taste or cheesy (though it is) but that all of its hyper-violence adds up to nothing\".<ref name=\"RevNYP\" /> Stephen Whitty of ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' called it a \"gray and ugly film\", said that there was little to draw viewers in, and wrote that apart from the drug-induced slow-motion sequences, the film offers nothing new.<ref name=\"RevStarLedger\" />\n\nThe visual effects and slow-motion sequences induced by Slo-Mo received broad praise. Berkshire said that they are notable and eye-catching with \"impressively utilised 3D.\"<ref name=\"RevVariety\" /> Hewitt said the visuals were \"genuinely surreal splashes of heightened colour that&nbsp;...&nbsp;don't outstay their welcome. The film's use of 3D is often excellent (including the credits) and it really comes to life in the Slo-mo scenes\".<ref name=\"RevEmpire\" /> Dalton said the film \"constantly impresses on a visual level, with a gritty style more akin to cult hits like ''[[District 9]]'' or ''[[28 Days Later]]'' than to standard Hollywood comic-book blockbusters.\" Dalton said, \"[Mantle's] first venture into 3D is a blaze of saturated colours, gorgeous high-resolution close-ups and dazzling slow-motion sequences.\"<ref name=\"RevTHR\" /> ''Dredd'' won ''The Art of 3D'' award at the 2013 [[Empire Awards]], and was nominated for ''Best British Film'' and ''Best Science-fiction/Fantasy''.<ref name=\"AccoEmpire\" />\n\n''Judge Dredd'' creator John Wagner, who had been critical of the 1995 adaptation, gave a positive review of ''Dredd''. He said: \"I liked the movie. It was, unlike the first film, a true representation of Judge Dredd&nbsp;...&nbsp;Karl Urban was a fine Dredd and I'd be more than happy to see him in the follow-up. Olivia Thirlby excelled as Anderson&nbsp;...&nbsp;The character and storyline are pure Dredd.\"<ref name=\"2012Empire \" /><ref name=\"RevWagner\" /> ''Dredd'' has been recognised as a [[cult film]] since its release.<ref name=\"TheGuardianOrigins\" /><ref name=\"Cult\" /><ref name=\"Cult2\" /><ref name=\"SequelMay15\" /> Some reviewers drew comparisons between ''Dredd'' and ''[[The Raid: Redemption]]'', another action film released a few months earlier, noting that similar elements in setting, story, and characters made ''Dredd'' appear derivative.<ref name=\"2012Empire\" /><ref name=\"RevIGN\" /><ref name=\"RevEmpire\" /> However, Garland and Urban explained that the timing of when the films were shot would have made plagiarism impossible.<ref name=\"IntGarlandCrave\" /><ref name=\"IntUrbanSlash\" />\n\n=== Home media ===\n''Dredd'' was released on [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray]] and [[Digital distribution|Digital Download]] on 8 January 2013 in North America, and 14 January in the UK.<ref name=\"HomeMediaUKDate\" /> The Blu-ray edition contains the 2D and 3D versions of the film and a digital copy. The DVD and Blu-ray editions contain seven featurettes: \"Mega-City Masters: 35 Years of Judge Dredd\", \"Day of Chaos: The Visual Effects of ''Dredd'' 3D\", \"Dredd\", \"Dredd's Gear\", \"The 3rd Dimension\", \"Welcome to Peachtrees\", and a \"''Dredd'' Motion Comic Prequel\" narrated by Urban.<ref name=\"HomeMedia1\" /><ref name=\"HomeMedia2\" /> During its first week on sale in the UK, ''Dredd'' was the number 1 selling DVD and Blu-ray.<ref name=\"HomeUK1\" /> During the week of its release in North America, it was the number 1 selling DVD and Blu-ray with approximately 650,000 units sold, and Blu-ray units accounting for nearly 50% of that figure. It was also the best-selling digital download for that period.<ref name=\"HomeMediaNASale\" /> Sales spiked in the United Kingdom in June 2013, following a reported rumour that it could influence DNA Films' decision to pursue a sequel.<ref name=\"SequelJune13\" /> By September 2013, ''Dredd'' was estimated to have earned approximately $10 million in home media sales in North America, while in the UK it marked over 270 days in online-retailer [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s top 100 selling home media.<ref name=\"HomeMediaSep2013\" /> By July 2017, this sales figure was estimated to have increased to $20 million.<ref name=\"HomeMediaJul17\" />\n\n== Future ==\nAt the [[London Film and Comic Con]] in July 2012, Garland said that a North American gross of over $50 million for ''Dredd'' would make sequels possible and that he had plans for a trilogy of films. A second film would focus on the origins of Dredd and Mega-City One, and a third would introduce Dredd's nemeses, the undead Judge Death and his [[Dark Judges]].<ref name=\"2012Empire\" /><ref name=\"Sequel1\" /> In August 2012, Garland said that a Judge Dredd television series would be a positive future step for the series.<ref name=\"Sequel2\" /> In September 2012, Garland said that he would explore the \"Origins\" and \"Democracy\" storylines, would introduce characters [[Judge Cal]] and [[Chopper (Judge Dredd character)|Chopper]], and would pursue the concept that Judge Dredd is a [[fascism|fascist]].<ref name=\"SequelSep12\" /> That same month, Macdonald said that further films would be made in partnership with IM Global and would likely be shot in South Africa.<ref name=\"SequelSep12B\" />\n\nIn March 2013, executive producer [[Adi Shankar]] said that a sequel was unlikely.<ref name=\"SequelApr13\" /> In May 2013, Urban said that a sequel was still possible, noting that the film had found an audience, and the response of fans could resurrect the project.<ref name=\"SequelMay15\" /> ''Dredd'' fans on [[Facebook]] launched a petition calling for a sequel. In July 2013, ''2000 AD'' endorsed the fan petition, supporting the campaign by printing advertisements in their publications, and by September 2013 it had attracted over 80,000 signatures.<ref name=\"Cult2\" /><ref name=\"HomeMediaSep2013\" /><ref name=\"SequelFan\" /><ref name=\"SequelJuly13\" /><ref name=\"SequelJuly13B\" /> In April 2013, ''2000 AD'' released an image teasing a continuation of the film in comic book form with a release date scheduled for September 2013.<ref name=\"SequelApr13B\" /> The comic, titled ''Dredd: Underbelly'', was made available in ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' #340 which was released on 18 September 2013.<ref name=\"SequelComic1\" /><ref name=\"SequelComic2\" /> In October 2014, Shankar announced the production of an unofficial spinoff online series based on the Dark Judges that would be released later that month.<ref name=\"Darkjudge\" /> The animated miniseries was titled ''Judge Dredd: Superfiend'' and all its six episodes were released on 27 October 2014 on [[YouTube]].<ref name=\"DarkJudgesReleased\" /> In March 2015, Garland said that a direct sequel would likely not happen in the near future, at least not with the crew involved in the original film.<ref name=\"SequelMar15\" />\n\nIn 2016, Urban said that \"conversations are happening\" regarding a ''Dredd'' continuation on streaming services [[Netflix]] or [[Amazon Prime]].<ref name=\"TVSequel\" /> In an interview in May 2016, Urban said that while the film's \"mishandled\" marketing strategy and \"unfortunate\" box office performance meant that it was \"problematic\" to try to make a sequel, \"the success it has achieved in all post-theatrical mediums has definitely strengthened the argument in favour of a sequel.\"<ref name=\"DenOfGeekMay2016\" /> In May 2017, a television series named ''Judge Dredd: Mega-City One'' was announced to be in development by IM Global Television and Rebellion.<ref name=\"SequelTVMay17\" /> In August 2017, Urban stated he was in discussion to star in the series.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mithaiwala |first=Mansoor |url=https://screenrant.com/dredd-tv-series-karl-urban-cast/ |title=Judge Dredd: Karl Urban 'In

It is the second book in the [[Artemis Fowl (series)|''Artemis Fowl'' series]], preceded by [[Artemis Fowl (novel)|''Artemis Fowl'']] and followed by ''[[Artemis Fowl: The Eternity Code]]''. It follows the adventures of the thirteen-year-old criminal mastermind, [[Artemis Fowl II]], as he thwarts a goblin rebellion and rescues his father, [[Artemis Fowl I]]. The [[Third-person narrative|third-person]] narration switches back and forth constantly, allowing the reader to understand more of what is going on. A [[The New York Times Best Seller list|New York Times bestseller]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Children's Books|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/19/books/bestseller/0519bestchildren.html|accessdate=7 February 2012|newspaper=The New York Times Best Sellers|date=19 May 2002}}</ref> the novel was well received by critics, and reviews compared its quality and success to those of its predecessor.\n\n==Plot==\nSpoiler Alert!\n\nThe story opens at the [[Kola Bay|Bay of Kola]], just after the Russian Mafia have sunk the Fowl Star. Two low-ranking Mafia members discover the body of the former Irish crime lord Artemis Fowl I, who has survived despite losing a leg and the use of one eye. Three years later, his son and heir Artemis Fowl II, while at school talking to the guidance counselor, Dr. Po, receives a call from his manservant and bodyguard [[List of Artemis Fowl characters#Domovoi Butler|Butler]]. Butler shows Artemis a video of his father, showing that he is in the hands of the Mafia. Knowing that a ransom demand will soon be coming, and that payment will in no way guarantee his father's release or his own safety, Artemis prepares to devise a plan while Butler drives them back to Fowl Manor.\n\nWhile Artemis Fowl's plight plays out above ground, the Lower Elements Police of the fairy realm are having their own problems. A routine [[stakeout]] group consisting of the disgraced Captain [[Holly Short]] and Private [[Chix Verbil]] is attacked by a group of heavily armed goblins carrying old outlawed Softnose weaponry powered by human [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], a Class A [[contraband]]. Captain Short is quick to accuse young Artemis Fowl and against his own wishes, LEP Commander [[List of Artemis Fowl characters#Julius Root|Julius Root]] sends Holly to apprehend Artemis Fowl and Butler for [[interrogation]]. However, [[Foaly]]'s Retimager proves Artemis's [[innocence]]. Against Holly's instincts, Root decides to recruit Fowl and Butler to locate the supplier.\n\nUnknown to all, the attacks are being organised by [[Briar Cudgeon]], a former LEP Lieutenant disgraced, deformed and demoted following his disastrous involvement in the Artemis Fowl affair. Briar is working alongside Foaly's biggest technology rival, the [[megalomanic]] pixie [[Opal Koboi]], who is above suspicion thanks to the fact the goblins have been staging attacks on Koboi property. Neither are concerned by Root's attempts to find out the truth, and choose to bide their time so they can kill him, and begin their plan to take over Haven once he is out of the way.\n\nFoaly's investigation points to French personal investigator Luc Carr\u00e9re. Holly leads a squad consisting of Root, Artemis and Butler, and herself above ground to France to interrogate Luc. Butler breaks into his apartment in Paris, but finds only a heavily mesmerized Luc, [[counterfeit]] [[Euro]]s, and a fairy handgun. Butler neutralises Luc, ensures the Parisian knows nothing of the goblin use of batteries, and leaves the private eye to be arrested. Although Artemis is concerned by the ease of the operation, he puts aside his concerns to travel to Murmansk with Butler, Root and Holly to attempt a rescue for Artemis Fowl I. Cudgeon sees this as the perfect opportunity to kill Root, and sends a goblin [[wikt:hit squad|hit squad]] to ambush the party. The goblins nearly succeed in killing the four as all fairy weapons currently in use by the force have just been disabled by Koboi. The resulting attack leaves Butler unconscious and trapped under rubble from an overhang with Commander Root. Holly and Artemis use a nuclear train to free Root and Butler, but the group is then forced to perform an emergency healing when the train door cuts off Holly's trigger finger. Holly questions Artemis about his father and how he came to be so ruthless in the events of the previous book, and, in a rare moment of sincerity, Artemis admits he made a mistake, a sign of his moral development that continues through the series.<ref>{{AF Cite Book |publisher = Hyperion Books for Children | booknumber = 2| pages = yes| startpage = 120| endpage = 147| month = July| year = 2008}}</ref>\n\nBelow ground, Briar Cudgeon ambushes and locks Foaly in his Operations Booth, while Opal disables LEP weapons, framing him as the mastermind behind the rebellion against the LEP and leaving the rescue group powerless to stop the goblins as they begin their attack on Haven city. The situation becomes increasingly desperate for the LEP in Haven, as Foaly uses Artemis's laptop to send a text message to boy's phone, alerting the rescue group that all fairy weapons and communications are controlled by [[Opal Koboi]].<ref>{{AF Cite Book |publisher = Hyperion Books for Children | booknumber = 2| pages = yes| startpage = 174| endpage = | month = July| year = 2008}}</ref>\n\nHaving received the secret message, Artemis decides the only option is to break into Koboi Laboratories and return all weapon control to the LEP, interrupting the rescue mission. Root bitterly acknowledges the only fairy who ever succeeded in doing so was the [[kleptomaniac]] dwarf [[Mulch Diggums]], who had worked as a builder of the facility, but was presumed dead following his break-in to Fowl Manor. Holly then reveals that Foaly had a hunch that Mulch had survived by placing the iris cam that scanned his vitals into local wildlife. Foaly realized that some of the gold returned by Artemis to the fairies was missing, and then traced several bars to Los Angeles, where Mulch was living as diminutive millionaire and legendary Oscar thief. The group then head to Los Angeles and apprehend Mulch once again.<ref>{{AF Cite Book |publisher = Hyperion Books for Children | booknumber = 2| pages = yes| startpage = 175| endpage = 177| month = July| year = 2008}}</ref>\n\nRoot threatens Mulch with imprisonment in the goblin prison Howler's Peak, and offers the dwarf a two-day head start if he assists in the break-in. The team use Mulch's original strategy to enter through one of the titanium foundation rods. One rod was not actually solid as Mulch and his cousin had diverted sewage into the shaft instead.<ref>{{AF Cite Book |publisher = Hyperion Books for Children | booknumber = 2| pages = yes| startpage = 222| endpage = 229| month = July| year = 2008}}</ref> After reaching the bottom of the foundation rod, and climbing through Mulch's recyclings, Butler, Root and Holly mount a desperate charge to the communications centre. While the three soldiers battle through an army of goblins, Artemis enters the network of deactivated plasma cannons to reach the centre by another route. Artemis manages to sneak into the hub long enough to communicate with Foaly, who uses Artemis's laptop to play back Cudgeon's own voice, revealing that Cudgeon planned to betray the goblins. Cudgeon is unfazed, and reactivates the plasma cannons to knock out all the goblins in Koboi Labs. Butler, Root and Holly smash their way into the centre, where Cudgeon holds Artemis at gunpoint. However, Foaly calls Artemis' mobile phone, and Artemis hands it to Koboi, who is then enraged to find that Cudgeon planned to betray her too. The two masterminds grapple with each other on Opal's hoverchair, and Cudgeon is killed when he is thrown into the open DNA cannon plasma feed, while the crash causes Opal to blackout, and destroys the remote control used by Opal to control LEP weaponry. Foaly uses the restored power to activate DNA cannons in Police Plaza, neutralizing most of the goblins involved in the revolt. Foaly remains in the Operations Booth, as the LEP outside, commanded by Captain Trouble Kelp, still think he is to blame for the revolt.<ref>{{AF Cite Book |publisher = Hyperion Books for Children | booknumber = 2| pages = yes| startpage = 248| endpage = 256| month = July| year = 2008}}</ref>\n\nArtemis, Holly, Butler and Root then head to Murmansk and rescue Artemis Fowl I. Artemis's plan to fake the shooting of his father nearly ends in disaster when the Russians throw the man overboard, but Holly manages to rescue Artemis Senior and heal his most severe injuries, apart from his lost leg. The Russian Mafia are foiled in their attempt to take the money, as Artemis has Foaly run up some fake notes that will dissolve upon being delivered to their boss. The group return to Europe where Holly deposits Artemis Fowl I on the steps of a hospital in [[Helsinki]]. The story closes with Dr. Po asking Artemis if he has learned anything and found a person he admires.

It is the second book in the [[Artemis Fowl (series)|''Artemis Fowl'' series]], preceded by [[Artemis Fowl (novel)|''Artemis Fowl'']] and followed by ''[[Artemis Fowl: The Eternity Code]]''. It follows the adventures of the thirteen-year-old criminal mastermind, [[Artemis Fowl II]], as he thwarts a goblin rebellion and rescues his father, [[Artemis Fowl I]]. The [[Third-person narrative|third-person]] narration switches back and forth constantly, allowing the reader to understand more of what is going on. A [[The New York Times Best Seller list|New York Times bestseller]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Children's Books|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/19/books/bestseller/0519bestchildren.html|accessdate=7 February 2012|newspaper=The New York Times Best Sellers|date=19 May 2002}}</ref> the novel was well received by critics, and reviews compared its quality and success to those of its predecessor.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story opens at the [[Kola Bay|Bay of Kola]], just after the Russian Mafia have sunk the Fowl Star. Two low-ranking Mafia members discover the body of the former Irish crime lord Artemis Fowl I, who has survived despite losing a leg and the use of one eye. Three years later, his son and heir Artemis Fowl II, while at school talking to the guidance counselor, Dr. Po, receives a call from his manservant and bodyguard [[List of Artemis Fowl characters#Domovoi Butler|Butler]]. Butler shows Artemis a video of his father, showing that he is in the hands of the Mafia. Knowing that a ransom demand will soon be coming, and that payment will in no way guarantee his father's release or his own safety, Artemis prepares to devise a plan while Butler drives them back to Fowl Manor.\n\nWhile Artemis Fowl's plight plays out above ground, the Lower Elements Police of the fairy realm are having their own problems. A routine [[stakeout]] group consisting of the disgraced Captain [[Holly Short]] and Private [[Chix Verbil]] is attacked by a group of heavily armed goblins carrying old outlawed Softnose weaponry powered by human [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], a Class A [[contraband]]. Captain Short is quick to accuse young Artemis Fowl and against his own wishes, LEP Commander [[List of Artemis Fowl characters#Julius Root|Julius Root]] sends Holly to apprehend Artemis Fowl and Butler for [[interrogation]]. However, [[Foaly]]'s Retimager proves Artemis's [[innocence]]. Against Holly's instincts, Root decides to recruit Fowl and Butler to locate the supplier.\n\nUnknown to all, the attacks are being organised by [[Briar Cudgeon]], a former LEP Lieutenant disgraced, deformed and demoted following his disastrous involvement in the Artemis Fowl affair. Briar is working alongside Foaly's biggest technology rival, the [[megalomanic]] pixie [[Opal Koboi]], who is above suspicion thanks to the fact the goblins have been staging attacks on Koboi property. Neither are concerned by Root's attempts to find out the truth, and choose to bide their time so they can kill him, and begin their plan to take over Haven once he is out of the way.\n\nFoaly's investigation points to French personal investigator Luc Carr\u00e9re. Holly leads a squad consisting of Root, Artemis and Butler, and herself above ground to France to interrogate Luc. Butler breaks into his apartment in Paris, but finds only a heavily mesmerized Luc, [[counterfeit]] [[Euro]]s, and a fairy handgun. Butler neutralises Luc, ensures the Parisian knows nothing of the goblin use of batteries, and leaves the private eye to be arrested. Although Artemis is concerned by the ease of the operation, he puts aside his concerns to travel to Murmansk with Butler, Root and Holly to attempt a rescue for Artemis Fowl I. Cudgeon sees this as the perfect opportunity to kill Root, and sends a goblin [[wikt:hit squad|hit squad]] to ambush the party. The goblins nearly succeed in killing the four as all fairy weapons currently in use by the force have just been disabled by Koboi. The resulting attack leaves Butler unconscious and trapped under rubble from an overhang with Commander Root. Holly and Artemis use a nuclear train to free Root and Butler, but the group is then forced to perform an emergency healing when the train door cuts off Holly's trigger finger. Holly questions Artemis about his father and how he came to be so ruthless in the events of the previous book, and, in a rare moment of sincerity, Artemis admits he made a mistake, a sign of his moral development that continues through the series.<ref>{{AF Cite Book |publisher = Hyperion Books for Children | booknumber = 2| pages = yes| startpage = 120| endpage = 147| month = July| year = 2008}}</ref>\n\nBelow ground, Briar Cudgeon ambushes and locks Foaly in his Operations Booth, while Opal disables LEP weapons, framing him as the mastermind behind the rebellion against the LEP and leaving the rescue group powerless to stop the goblins as they begin their attack on Haven city. The situation becomes increasingly desperate for the LEP in Haven, as Foaly uses Artemis's laptop to send a text message to boy's phone, alerting the rescue group that all fairy weapons and communications are controlled by [[Opal Koboi]].<ref>{{AF Cite Book |publisher = Hyperion Books for Children | booknumber = 2| pages = yes| startpage = 174| endpage = | month = July| year = 2008}}</ref>\n\nHaving received the secret message, Artemis decides the only option is to break into Koboi Laboratories and return all weapon control to the LEP, interrupting the rescue mission. Root bitterly acknowledges the only fairy who ever succeeded in doing so was the [[kleptomaniac]] dwarf [[Mulch Diggums]], who had worked as a builder of the facility, but was presumed dead following his break-in to Fowl Manor. Holly then reveals that Foaly had a hunch that Mulch had survived by placing the iris cam that scanned his vitals into local wildlife. Foaly realized that some of the gold returned by Artemis to the fairies was missing, and then traced several bars to Los Angeles, where Mulch was living as diminutive millionaire and legendary Oscar thief. The group then head to Los Angeles and apprehend Mulch once again.<ref>{{AF Cite Book |publisher = Hyperion Books for Children | booknumber = 2| pages = yes| startpage = 175| endpage = 177| month = July| year = 2008}}</ref>\n\nRoot threatens Mulch with imprisonment in the goblin prison Howler's Peak, and offers the dwarf a two-day head start if he assists in the break-in. The team use Mulch's original strategy to enter through one of the titanium foundation rods. One rod was not actually solid as Mulch and his cousin had diverted sewage into the shaft instead.<ref>{{AF Cite Book |publisher = Hyperion Books for Children | booknumber = 2| pages = yes| startpage = 222| endpage = 229| month = July| year = 2008}}</ref> After reaching the bottom of the foundation rod, and climbing through Mulch's recyclings, Butler, Root and Holly mount a desperate charge to the communications centre. While the three soldiers battle through an army of goblins, Artemis enters the network of deactivated plasma cannons to reach the centre by another route. Artemis manages to sneak into the hub long enough to communicate with Foaly, who uses Artemis's laptop to play back Cudgeon's own voice, revealing that Cudgeon planned to betray the goblins. Cudgeon is unfazed, and reactivates the plasma cannons to knock out all the goblins in Koboi Labs. Butler, Root and Holly smash their way into the centre, where Cudgeon holds Artemis at gunpoint. However, Foaly calls Artemis' mobile phone, and Artemis hands it to Koboi, who is then enraged to find that Cudgeon planned to betray her too. The two masterminds grapple with each other on Opal's hoverchair, and Cudgeon is killed when he is thrown into the open DNA cannon plasma feed, while the crash causes Opal to blackout, and destroys the remote control used by Opal to control LEP weaponry. Foaly uses the restored power to activate DNA cannons in Police Plaza, neutralizing most of the goblins involved in the revolt. Foaly remains in the Operations Booth, as the LEP outside, commanded by Captain Trouble Kelp, still think he is to blame for the revolt.<ref>{{AF Cite Book |publisher = Hyperion Books for Children | booknumber = 2| pages = yes| startpage = 248| endpage = 256| month = July| year = 2008}}</ref>\n\nArtemis, Holly, Butler and Root then head to Murmansk and rescue Artemis Fowl I. Artemis's plan to fake the shooting of his father nearly ends in disaster when the Russians throw the man overboard, but Holly manages to rescue Artemis Senior and heal his most severe injuries, apart from his lost leg. The Russian Mafia are foiled in their attempt to take the money, as Artemis has Foaly run up some fake notes that will dissolve upon being delivered to their boss. The group return to Europe where Holly deposits Artemis Fowl I on the steps of a hospital in [[Helsinki]]. The story closes with Dr. Po asking Artemis if he has learned anything and found a person he admires. Artemis, thinking of his father and the many who helped to rescue him, then answers \"Yes, I believe I have.\"\n\n==Critical reception==\nCritical reception was generally positive.\n''[[January Magazine]]'' noted that after the success of the novel's [[Artemis Fowl (novel)|predecessor]], ''Arctic Incident'' had \"a lot to live up to\".

While the [[Baptist Union of New Zealand|Baptist Union]] endeavoured to get alcohol-[[prohibition]] policies passed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the [[Catholic Church]] urged its members to vote against such laws, concerned that the measures would outlaw wine for the [[Eucharist]]. A referendum on prohibition took place in 1919, but the return of demobilised New Zealand soldiers from [[World War I]] defeated the measure. Evangelical and [[Catholic]] New Zealanders did not respond as corporate institutions to the debates on [[capital punishment in New Zealand]] in the thirties, forties and fifties, but individual laypeople and clergy did make their opposition heard. The [[Anglican Church of New Zealand]] became more forthright in its opposition to the death penalty, and as the largest [[Christian denomination]] in New Zealand, it made its presence felt.\n\n== Christianity within mainstream political parties ==\nNeither the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] nor the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], the two traditional dominant mainstream political parties in New Zealand since the 1930s, represent explicitly religious traditions. Nevertheless, both parties have occasionally contained people who saw their political mission in religious terms. A number of early politicians, both in Labour and in National, saw their respective political ideologies as an extension of \"[[Christian values]]\".\n\nIn the early Labour Party a significant sub-set of the party promoted what one might call \"[[Christian socialism]]\", {{citation needed span|date=November 2013|text=claiming that \"Christian kindness and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]\" fitted socialism better than it did conservatism.}} New Zealand's first Labour Prime Minister [[Michael Joseph Savage]] is said to have personified Labour's \"Applied Christianity.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Joseph Savage|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/people/michael-joseph-savage-biography|title=Ministry for Culture and Heritage, updated 9 July 2010|publisher=Nzhistory.net.nz|accessdate=20 May 2015}}</ref>  Labour won an overwhelming victory by presenting itself as the party of practical Christian compassion, in contrast to the \"anti-family\" depression-era coalition government.

Shortly afterward, many of the same liberal Christians participated in the [[peace movement]] of the 1980s, which resulted in New Zealand becoming a declared  [[nuclear free zone]] in 1987. During the [[New Zealand National Party]] governments of the 1990s, these liberal Christians became involved in organising against [[New Right]] cutbacks to social-welfare benefits (cutbacks supported by the [[New Zealand Business Roundtable]], [[ACT New Zealand]] and similar organisations).\n\n==Evangelical political activism: 1980s: Moral Activism==\nBy the early 1980s, the Christian evangelical revival of the 1960s had developed into a social movement that utilized community and political action in response to \"moral\" issues.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vodanovich |first1=I |year=1985 |title=Women's Place in God's World |journal=Women's Studies Journal |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=68\u201379 |publisher=Women's Studies Association N.Z. and Otago University Press |doi= }}</ref> These developments were influenced by the emergence of a vocal [[Christian Right]] in the Reagan-era [[United States]], represented by figures such as [[Jerry Falwell]] and [[Pat Robertson]] and groups such as the [[Moral Majority]] and [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]].

At about the same time, the [[Coalition of Concerned Citizens]] (CCC) formed, using the motto \"For God, Family and Country\", while many liberal [[Anglican]]s and [[Methodists]] formed a \"Christians for Homosexual Law Reform\" network to counter their efforts. The campaign against homosexual law reform eventually failed, however, and the bill became law in 1986.<ref name=\"Allan Davidson Pg 176-77\" />\n\nLike their American counterparts, conservative evangelical movements in New Zealand also tended to be strongly [[anti-Communist]].

As Dirk Vanderpyl noted in his denominational history of the Reformed Churches, ''Trust and Obey'' (1994), the SGP, [[ChristenUnie]] and other Reformed fundamentalist-based political parties were involved in \"[[testimonial party]]\" politics within the Dutch Parliament, based more on principle than concrete political objectives.\n\nThe Christian Heritage Party formed in 1989. The driving force behind its creation, [[Bill van Rij]], had had previous involvement in the [[Coalition of Concerned Citizens]]. Van Rij took direct inspiration from the Christian Heritage Party of Canada, and believed that a similar party could have success in New Zealand. In January 1988, van Rij and several friends established a steering committee for a new political party based on the Canadian model. In February, a meeting in [[Christchurch]] confirmed the plan, and John Allen, a former National Party candidate, became ''de facto'' interim leader. By 20 July 1989, a sufficient number of people had gathered for the party to launch officially. The party took a strict [[Bible|biblical]] line, and strongly condemned things such as [[abortion]], [[pornography]], and the perceived erosion of [[marriage]] and the family. Shortly after the party's official launch, the Reverend [[Graham Capill]] gained  appointment as leader, a position he would hold for the next fourteen years.\n\nReligious conservatives gave a mixed reaction to the formation of the Christian Heritage Party. Some groups, such as [[SPUC]], welcomed the party. Others, however, believed that an independent Christian conservative party would not succeed, or worse, would split the conservative vote. [[Graeme Lee (politician)|Graeme Lee]], a National member of parliament who had fought against homosexual law-reform, did not support the new party, seeing fighting for Christian values within the National Party as more effective.\n\nOne controversial issue associated with the Christian Heritage Party centred on the party's rigidly \"[[confessionalism (religion)|confessional]]\" nature. Under this policy, all members of the party had to declare themselves as Christians. The Christian Heritage Party saw this requirement as only natural, and as a guarantee of the party's ideological purity. Other Christian activists, however, particularly those with more moderate views, believed that confessionalism unnecessarily restricted the support base of the party. Instead, they advocated a party \"based on Christian values\", rather than a \"Christians only\" party. The non-confessionalists claimed that anyone, even if not followers of the Christian religion, could see the benefits of Christian values to society.\n\nAs for the Christian Democrats, they had a relatively broader base. In New Zealand, the [[New Life Churches]] (some of which were then known as \"New Life Centres\") had a history of recent anti-abortion, anti-feminist and anti-gay activism, particularly in Christchurch, from the mid-seventies onward. Like Lee, many had joined the National Party, only to become disillusioned as it rejected social conservatism in favour of a more pluralist model as it sought to reach out to urban liberals. Brett Knowles documented and analysed the New Life Churches and their denominational history in 1999.\n\nGraeme Lee, the National MP, opposed [[confessionalism (religion)|confessionalism]], believing that a party which followed this doctrine would never gain sufficient support. For this reason, among others, Lee, when invited, refused to join the new Christian Heritage Party. Lee had disliked the idea of having a separate Christian or Christian-based party at all, believing that remaining with National could prove more effective. In 1993, however, Lee had fallen out with the National Party's leadership, mainly due to losing his ministerial role in a [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]] reshuffle. Lee's demotion, combined with his belief that National had started to become gradually more and more [[liberalism|liberal]], had prompted him to plan a departure. At this point Christian Heritage contacted Lee and invited him to join the party. According to some accounts, Lee actually received an offer of leadership.\n\nThe negotiations between Lee and Christian Heritage eventually broke down, however. The issue of confessionalism, which Lee continued to oppose, remained a major sticking-point. Lee eventually pulled out of the talks, and in 1994, established his own group, known as the United Progressive Party. The prospect of two competing Christian parties alarmed many Christian conservative activists, and repeated attempts took place to get the two sides talking once again, but the issue of confessionalism (as well as several other policy differences that had emerged) made this difficult. In November, however, talks re-opened, partly at the urging of Bill van Rij.\n\nIt seemed obvious to both sides that co-operation would bring mutual benefits \u2014 Lee had the advantage of a current Parliamentary seat, while the Christian Heritage Party had the advantage of superior organisation and a \"grass-roots\" network. Policy-issues once again proved difficult, but on 20 December 1994 a proposed agreement finally emerged. The proposal, which needed ratification by both Christian Heritage and the United Progressives, would have seen both parties dissolved, with a new united, non-confessional party set up in their place. Lee reportedly endorsed the plan, and believed that it would succeed. Graham Capill, of Christian Heritage, showed less enthusiasm. Later, a Christian Heritage Party convention rejected the proposal, although it did offer an alliance which would have seen the parties contest the election together. Lee, deeply disappointed at the rejection, refused the alliance. Van Rij also expressed disappointment with the decision.\n\nOn 17 May 1995, Lee re-launched his party, calling it the [[Christian Democrat Party (New Zealand)|Christian Democrat Party]]. (The Christian Heritage Party complained to the [[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]] that the name too closely resembled their own, but the commission rejected thiscomplaint.). The launch of the party generated considerable attention in the media. Lee also received considerable publicity for his attacks on the \"Death with Dignity\" bill, an attempt by dissident National MP [[Michael Laws]] to legalise [[euthanasia]].\n\n=== The Christian Coalition ===\nOccasional attempts at talks between Christian Heritage and the Christian Democrats continued during the early part of 1995, but these proved generally ineffectual. Towards the end of 1995, however, pressure for a united front began to increase substantially. Bill van Rij became particularly prominent in this effort, as did a number of Christian associations which threatened to withhold their endorsement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} At the instigation of [[Murray Smith (New Zealand politician)|Murray Smith]], an Executive Member with Christian Democrats, more talks took place, and eventually decided an alliance possible, with everything split exactly equally between the two parties. The joint party list would alternate between the Christian Democrats and Christian Heritage, beginning with Lee (as a sitting MP) in first place and Capill in second. While the two parties would campaign together, they would function separately in Parliament.\n\nThe new [[Christian Coalition (New Zealand)|Christian Coalition]] launched on 29 March 1996. It received considerable public attention, and prospered in [[opinion poll|opinion-poll]]s. The coalition issued its manifesto in September, though \u2014 due to an inability to resolve certain differences between the two parties \u2014 the manifesto lacked a degree of detail. The Christian Heritage Party expressed a certain amount of dissatisfaction over the manifesto, which it considered \"too moderate\". Lee and the Christian Democrats, however, strongly believed moderation crucial to electoral success, and that Christian Heritage's more extreme policies would alienate many voters. Even with Lee's attempt at moderation, however, the party's more controversial views tended to receive the most media attention, and many criticised the coalition as \"extremist\".\n\nIn the [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996 election]] itself, the Christian Coalition gained 4.33% of the vote. This fell short of the 5% necessary for [[proportional representation]] under the [[Mixed Member Proportional]] (MMP) system, and none of the party's electorate candidates won a seat. As many polls had once shown the coalition as passing the 5% threshold, this result led to disappointment in some circles. Considerable acrimony ensued between Christian Heritage and the Christian Democrats, with both believing that the other had caused the loss. Christian Heritage generally believed that the Christian Democrats had \"watered down\" the coalition's message in the name of political pragmatism, surrendering the [[moral high ground]] and giving up the party's clear focus. The Christian Democrats, on the other hand, said that Christian Heritage's extremism and unwillingness to compromise had led to the defeat. Each side essentially blamed the other for dragging the coalition down.\n\nIn May 1997, the Christian Coalition dissolved, and its constituent parties went their separate ways. Shortly afterwards, Bill van Rij left Christian Heritage and joined the Christian Democrats, blaming Capill for the collapse of the Coalition. A number of other senior Christian Heritage members, led by a former Deputy Leader, Geoff Hounsell, also resigned; and the party expelled others. Ex-members joined the Christian Democrats following an unsuccessful attempt to have Christian Heritage agree to a merger with Christian Democrats.\n\n===After the Christian Coalition===\n\n==== Christian Heritage ====\nThe Christian Heritage Party remained somewhat bitter about the collapse of the Christian Coalition.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} While considerable tension had existed between Christian Heritage and the Christian Democrats, Graham Capill apparently believed a resolution possible. After the Christian Democrats left, however, Christian Heritage re-affirmed all its traditional policies, including those that had seemed too extreme for the Coalition.\n\nChristian Heritage stood [[Ewen McQueen]] as its candidate in the 1998 Taranaki-King Country byelection. McQueen out-polled candidates for the larger New Zealand First and Green parties.\n\nSix months before the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 general election]], [[Frank Grover]], leader of the Liberal Party, a component of the Alliance, defected to Christian Heritage, giving it one seat in Parliament. Grover had won election as an Alliance [[list MP]] in 1996. High-profile broadcaster Philip Sherry also joined the party in 1999 and stood in the number 2 position on the party list. Christian Heritage gained 2.4% of the vote in the 1999 election, well short of the threshold for entering Parliament, although enough to make it easily the largest party outside parliament.\n\nIn the [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002 general election]], Australian political consultant David Elliot, a prominent campaigner against [[republicanism in Australia]], became the campaign manager for Christian Heritage. A strategy developed of focusing on a single electorate, [[Wairarapa]], whereby Christian Heritage could gain entry to parliament and bypass the 5% requirement. However, the result proved disappointing \u2013 the party gained only 1.4% of the vote, and its Wairarapa candidate, deputy leader [[Merepeka Raukawa-Tait]], came third. Christian Heritage's support defected to United Future New Zealand, a merger of Future New Zealand (a successor to the Christian Democrats) and Peter Dunne's United New Zealand, which had occurred in 2000.\n\nIn 2003, Capill stepped down as party leader and Ewen McQueen succeeded him. The party renamed itself ''Christian Heritage New Zealand'' (CHNZ).\n\nIn 2005 a court convicted former leader Capill for the repeated rape and sexual violation of a girl aged eight, and jailed him for nine years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3345358a10,00.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 July 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050716045254/http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3345358a10,00.html |archive-date=16 July 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nThe new Christian Heritage leadership condemned Capill's conduct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chnz.org.nz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=105&Itemid=47 |accessdate=16 February 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 October 2006, ex-CHNZ Leader Ewen McQueen announced that Christian Heritage would disband<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3817191a11,00.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 October 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015015/http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3817191a11,00.html |archive-date=30 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> \nto allow \"new things to arise in Christian politics in New Zealand\". Former Christian Heritage Leader, Ewen McQueen announced that the hypothetical new party would \"make a strong and clear stand for the importance of family life, the primacy of marriage and the sanctity of human life.\" McQueen later joined the [[New Zealand National Party]] and unsuccessfully stood for the nomination for the [[Epsom (New Zealand electorate)|Epsom]] electorate in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10739361|title=Paul Goldsmith chosen as new National candidate for Epsom|work=The New Zealand Herald}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2007}} debate continued over whether Christian Heritage ever amounted to anything more than a \"[[testimonial party]]\". As noted above, this model of politics refers to a particular model of partisan 'politics of principle' that eschews pragmatic political objectives. If this is the case, then there are certain implications. As the Netherlands has a demographically based electoral system, this means that the testimonial party model could rely on Reformed fundamentalist constituencies in [[Zeeland]], [[Veluwe]] and parts of [[Overijssel]], the Dutch \"[[Bible Belt (Netherlands)|Bible Belt]].\" However, New Zealand's [[Mixed Member Proportional]] electoral system imposes a five percent threshold before a party that has no constituency seat representation can be represented within the New Zealand Parliament, as does its own German model. As CHNZ never cleared that threshold, it may therefore be seen as an imported 'testimonial party' model that did not work in a foreign political context or electoral system.\n\nBy contrast, [[United Future New Zealand]] worked that same electoral system well. However, Christian Heritage's constitution seemed to rule out Christian Heritage functioning as a purely \"testimonial party\". While it allowed as an objective of the party to \"promote and uphold biblical principles\", the constitution went on to state that the party had as a goal to \"gain seats in parliament so that it can have a direct influence on legislation, policy, and the governing of New Zealand.\"\n\n==== Christian Democrats, Future NZ, and the Kiwi Party ====\n\nThe Christian Democrats, by contrast, took a considerably different path. Not long after the Christian Coalition fell apart, Graeme Lee announced that he would step down as leader of the party. He had contemplated retiring for some time, and had already determined that if the Coalition failed he would make his exit from politics. For some considerable period of time the party remained with Lee as temporary leader, as no satisfactory new candidate had emerged. Eventually [[Anthony Walton (politician)|Anthony Walton]] became its new leader. Under Walton, the Christian Democrats went further down the non-confessional path, removing all explicit references to Christianity from their party platform. The party adopted the name \"[[Future New Zealand]]\" (rejecting \"Future Vision\" as a proposed alternative), and positioned itself as a \"values-based\" rather than as a religion-based party.\n\nFuture New Zealand contested the 1999 general election but gained only 1.1% of the party vote. The party considered becoming an apolitical [[lobby group|lobby-group]], but led by its General Secretary, [[Murray Smith (New Zealand politician)|Murray Smith]], who had instigated discussions with [[Peter Dunne]], the leader of [[United New Zealand]] and the holder of a \"safe\" [[constituency]] seat, the party decided to explore a coalition with United New Zealand instead. Following further discussions with United, the two parties entered into a coalition to contest the 2002 general election under the name [[United Future New Zealand]]. The group gained 6.7% of the party vote, giving it eight seats.  In 2003 the two parties merged. For a time there was debate as to whether to classify the resultant group as a Christian party, but the party's rejection of that label appears to have clarified matters. According to United Future, the party does indeed have a grounding in traditional values, but remains open to anyone who shares those values, not merely to Christians.\n\nIn the [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005 general election]], United Future's support slump to 2.67%, leaving it with only three MPs. The precise reasons for this remain difficult to identify, but it appears that many former Christian supporters of United Future cast their votes for the National Party in the 2005 election.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\nIn 2006\u20132007, Peter Dunne decided to vote in favour of a bill banning parental [[corporal punishment]] of children, while his surviving party caucus-members, [[Gordon Copeland]] and [[Judy Turner]] voted against it. As a result of Dunne's exercise of his right to a [[conscience vote]] over this issue, Gordon Copeland seceded from the United Future caucus. Copeland and former UFNZ List MP [[Larry Baldock]] announced their intention to re-form an independent Future New Zealand party{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} (renamed [[the Kiwi Party]] on 25 January 2008). Baldock has said that over one hundred former UFNZ board members and candidates joined them.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} However, UFNZ President [[Denise Krum]] contested Baldock's assertion over resignations. According to its website, [[Future New Zealand]]  enrolling the five hundred party-members required for registration under the Electoral Act 1993. It remains unclear whether these figures represent former disgruntled FNZ members who had quit after the merger with United, or new supporters, possibly from the disintegrated [[Christian Heritage New Zealand]].\n\nIn the event, the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 general election]] was a disappointment for the Kiwi Party. They polled 11,658 votes in total, only 0.54% of the total party votes cast for all New Zealand political parties, and far short of the five-percent threshold required for list-only electoral representation. It even polled behind the avowedly satirical [[Bill and Ben Party]].\n\nOn 14 October 2011 the Kiwi Party announced that it would not be standing any candidates in the 2011 general election, and that several members had joined the Conservative Party and would be standing for it.

While the [[Baptist Union of New Zealand|Baptist Union]] endeavoured to get alcohol-[[prohibition]] policies passed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the [[Catholic Church]] urged its members to vote against such laws, concerned that the measures would outlaw wine for the [[Eucharist]]. A referendum on prohibition took place in 1919, but the return of demobilised New Zealand soldiers from [[World War I]] defeated the measure. Evangelical and [[Catholic]] New Zealanders did not respond as corporate institutions to the debates on [[capital punishment in New Zealand]] in the thirties, forties and fifties, but individual laypeople and clergy did make their opposition heard. The [[Anglican Church of New Zealand]] became more forthright in its opposition to the death penalty, and as the largest [[Christian denomination]] in New Zealand, it made its presence felt.\n\n== Christianity within mainstream political parties ==\nNeither the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] nor the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], the two traditional dominant mainstream political parties in New Zealand since the 1930s, represent explicitly religious traditions.

Organizations such as the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child ([[SPUC]]- now [[Voice for Life]]) and the [[Society for the Promotion of Community Standards]] (SPCS) served as a focus for Christian conservatism.<ref name=\"Allan Davidson Pg 176-77\">{{cite book |last=Davidson |first=Allan |authorlink= |title=Christianity in Aotearoa: A History of Church and Society in New Zealand |url= |accessdate= |year=2004 |publisher=Education for Ministry|location=Wellington |isbn=0-476-00229-X |pages=176\u201377}}</ref> Eventually, the conservatives won their initial battles against homosexual law reform, but lost their ongoing battle over abortion during the late seventies and early eighties.

Shortly afterward, many of the same liberal Christians participated in the [[peace movement]] of the 1980s, which resulted in New Zealand becoming a declared  [[nuclear free zone]] in 1987. During the [[New Zealand National Party]] governments of the 1990s, these liberal Christians became involved in organising against [[New Right]] cutbacks to social-welfare benefits (cutbacks supported by the [[New Zealand Business Roundtable]], [[ACT New Zealand]] and similar organisations).\n\n==Evangelical political activism: 1980s: Moral Activism==\nBy the early 1980s, the Christian evangelical revival of the 1960s had developed into a social movement that utilized community and political action in response to \"moral\" issues.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vodanovich |first1=I |year=1985 |title=Women's Place in God's World |journal=Women's Studies Journal |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=68\u201379 |publisher=Women's Studies Association N.Z. and Otago University Press |doi= }}</ref> These developments were influenced by the emergence of a vocal [[Christian Right]] in the Reagan-era [[United States]], represented by figures such as [[Jerry Falwell]] and [[Pat Robertson]] and groups such as the [[Moral Majority]] and [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]].

At about the same time, the [[Coalition of Concerned Citizens]] (CCC) formed, using the motto \"For God, Family and Country\", while many liberal [[Anglican]]s and [[Methodists]] formed a \"Christians for Homosexual Law Reform\" network to counter their efforts. The campaign against homosexual law reform eventually failed, however, and the bill became law in 1986.<ref name=\"Allan Davidson Pg 176-77\" />\n\nLike their American counterparts, conservative evangelical movements in New Zealand also tended to be strongly [[anti-Communist]].

As Dirk Vanderpyl noted in his denominational history of the Reformed Churches, ''Trust and Obey'' (1994), the SGP, [[ChristenUnie]] and other Reformed fundamentalist-based political parties were involved in \"[[testimonial party]]\" politics within the Dutch Parliament, based more on principle than concrete political objectives.\n\nThe Christian Heritage Party formed in 1989. The driving force behind its creation, [[Bill van Rij]], had had previous involvement in the [[Coalition of Concerned Citizens]]. Van Rij took direct inspiration from the Christian Heritage Party of Canada, and believed that a similar party could have success in New Zealand. In January 1988, van Rij and several friends established a steering committee for a new political party based on the Canadian model. In February, a meeting in [[Christchurch]] confirmed the plan, and John Allen, a former National Party candidate, became ''de facto'' interim leader. By 20 July 1989, a sufficient number of people had gathered for the party to launch officially. The party took a strict [[Bible|biblical]] line, and strongly condemned things such as [[abortion]], [[pornography]], and the perceived erosion of [[marriage]] and the family. Shortly after the party's official launch, the Reverend [[Graham Capill]] gained  appointment as leader, a position he would hold for the next fourteen years.\n\nReligious conservatives gave a mixed reaction to the formation of the Christian Heritage Party. Some groups, such as [[SPUC]], welcomed the party. Others, however, believed that an independent Christian conservative party would not succeed, or worse, would split the conservative vote. [[Graeme Lee (politician)|Graeme Lee]], a National member of parliament who had fought against homosexual law-reform, did not support the new party, seeing fighting for Christian values within the National Party as more effective.\n\nOne controversial issue associated with the Christian Heritage Party centred on the party's rigidly \"[[confessionalism (religion)|confessional]]\" nature. Under this policy, all members of the party had to declare themselves as Christians. The Christian Heritage Party saw this requirement as only natural, and as a guarantee of the party's ideological purity. Other Christian activists, however, particularly those with more moderate views, believed that confessionalism unnecessarily restricted the support base of the party. Instead, they advocated a party \"based on Christian values\", rather than a \"Christians only\" party. The non-confessionalists claimed that anyone, even if not followers of the Christian religion, could see the benefits of Christian values to society.\n\nAs for the Christian Democrats, they had a relatively broader base. In New Zealand, the [[New Life Churches]] (some of which were then known as \"New Life Centres\") had a history of recent anti-abortion, anti-feminist and anti-gay activism, particularly in Christchurch, from the mid-seventies onward. Like Lee, many had joined the National Party, only to become disillusioned as it rejected social conservatism in favour of a more pluralist model as it sought to reach out to urban liberals. Brett Knowles documented and analysed the New Life Churches and their denominational history in 1999.\n\nGraeme Lee, the National MP, opposed [[confessionalism (religion)|confessionalism]], believing that a party which followed this doctrine would never gain sufficient support. For this reason, among others, Lee, when invited, refused to join the new Christian Heritage Party. Lee had disliked the idea of having a separate Christian or Christian-based party at all, believing that remaining with National could prove more effective. In 1993, however, Lee had fallen out with the National Party's leadership, mainly due to losing his ministerial role in a [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]] reshuffle. Lee's demotion, combined with his belief that National had started to become gradually more and more [[liberalism|liberal]], had prompted him to plan a departure. At this point Christian Heritage contacted Lee and invited him to join the party. According to some accounts, Lee actually received an offer of leadership.\n\nThe negotiations between Lee and Christian Heritage eventually broke down, however. The issue of confessionalism, which Lee continued to oppose, remained a major sticking-point. Lee eventually pulled out of the talks, and in 1994, established his own group, known as the United Progressive Party. The prospect of two competing Christian parties alarmed many Christian conservative activists, and repeated attempts took place to get the two sides talking once again, but the issue of confessionalism (as well as several other policy differences that had emerged) made this difficult. In November, however, talks re-opened, partly at the urging of Bill van Rij.\n\nIt seemed obvious to both sides that co-operation would bring mutual benefits \u2014 Lee had the advantage of a current Parliamentary seat, while the Christian Heritage Party had the advantage of superior organisation and a \"grass-roots\" network. Policy-issues once again proved difficult, but on 20 December 1994 a proposed agreement finally emerged. The proposal, which needed ratification by both Christian Heritage and the United Progressives, would have seen both parties dissolved, with a new united, non-confessional party set up in their place. Lee reportedly endorsed the plan, and believed that it would succeed. Graham Capill, of Christian Heritage, showed less enthusiasm. Later, a Christian Heritage Party convention rejected the proposal, although it did offer an alliance which would have seen the parties contest the election together. Lee, deeply disappointed at the rejection, refused the alliance. Van Rij also expressed disappointment with the decision.\n\nOn 17 May 1995, Lee re-launched his party, calling it the [[Christian Democrat Party (New Zealand)|Christian Democrat Party]]. (The Christian Heritage Party complained to the [[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]] that the name too closely resembled their own, but the commission rejected thiscomplaint.). The launch of the party generated considerable attention in the media. Lee also received considerable publicity for his attacks on the \"Death with Dignity\" bill, an attempt by dissident National MP [[Michael Laws]] to legalise [[euthanasia]].\n\n=== The Christian Coalition ===\nOccasional attempts at talks between Christian Heritage and the Christian Democrats continued during the early part of 1995, but these proved generally ineffectual. Towards the end of 1995, however, pressure for a united front began to increase substantially. Bill van Rij became particularly prominent in this effort, as did a number of Christian associations which threatened to withhold their endorsement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} At the instigation of [[Murray Smith (New Zealand politician)|Murray Smith]], an Executive Member with Christian Democrats, more talks took place, and eventually decided an alliance possible, with everything split exactly equally between the two parties. The joint party list would alternate between the Christian Democrats and Christian Heritage, beginning with Lee (as a sitting MP) in first place and Capill in second. While the two parties would campaign together, they would function separately in Parliament.\n\nThe new [[Christian Coalition (New Zealand)|Christian Coalition]] launched on 29 March 1996. It received considerable public attention, and prospered in [[opinion poll|opinion-poll]]s. The coalition issued its manifesto in September, though \u2014 due to an inability to resolve certain differences between the two parties \u2014 the manifesto lacked a degree of detail. The Christian Heritage Party expressed a certain amount of dissatisfaction over the manifesto, which it considered \"too moderate\". Lee and the Christian Democrats, however, strongly believed moderation crucial to electoral success, and that Christian Heritage's more extreme policies would alienate many voters. Even with Lee's attempt at moderation, however, the party's more controversial views tended to receive the most media attention, and many criticised the coalition as \"extremist\".\n\nIn the [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996 election]] itself, the Christian Coalition gained 4.33% of the vote. This fell short of the 5% necessary for [[proportional representation]] under the [[Mixed Member Proportional]] (MMP) system, and none of the party's electorate candidates won a seat. As many polls had once shown the coalition as passing the 5% threshold, this result led to disappointment in some circles. Considerable acrimony ensued between Christian Heritage and the Christian Democrats, with both believing that the other had caused the loss. Christian Heritage generally believed that the Christian Democrats had \"watered down\" the coalition's message in the name of political pragmatism, surrendering the [[moral high ground]] and giving up the party's clear focus. The Christian Democrats, on the other hand, said that Christian Heritage's extremism and unwillingness to compromise had led to the defeat. Each side essentially blamed the other for dragging the coalition down.\n\nIn May 1997, the Christian Coalition dissolved, and its constituent parties went their separate ways. Shortly afterwards, Bill van Rij left Christian Heritage and joined the Christian Democrats, blaming Capill for the collapse of the Coalition. A number of other senior Christian Heritage members, led by a former Deputy Leader, Geoff Hounsell, also resigned; and the party expelled others. Ex-members joined the Christian Democrats following an unsuccessful attempt to have Christian Heritage agree to a merger with Christian Democrats.\n\n===After the Christian Coalition===\n\n==== Christian Heritage ====\nThe Christian Heritage Party remained somewhat bitter about the collapse of the Christian Coalition.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} While considerable tension had existed between Christian Heritage and the Christian Democrats, Graham Capill apparently believed a resolution possible. After the Christian Democrats left, however, Christian Heritage re-affirmed all its traditional policies, including those that had seemed too extreme for the Coalition.\n\nChristian Heritage stood [[Ewen McQueen]] as its candidate in the 1998 Taranaki-King Country byelection. McQueen out-polled candidates for the larger New Zealand First and Green parties.\n\nSix months before the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 general election]], [[Frank Grover]], leader of the Liberal Party, a component of the Alliance, defected to Christian Heritage, giving it one seat in Parliament. Grover had won election as an Alliance [[list MP]] in 1996. High-profile broadcaster Philip Sherry also joined the party in 1999 and stood in the number 2 position on the party list. Christian Heritage gained 2.4% of the vote in the 1999 election, well short of the threshold for entering Parliament, although enough to make it easily the largest party outside parliament.\n\nIn the [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002 general election]], Australian political consultant David Elliot, a prominent campaigner against [[republicanism in Australia]], became the campaign manager for Christian Heritage. A strategy developed of focusing on a single electorate, [[Wairarapa]], whereby Christian Heritage could gain entry to parliament and bypass the 5% requirement. However, the result proved disappointing \u2013 the party gained only 1.4% of the vote, and its Wairarapa candidate, deputy leader [[Merepeka Raukawa-Tait]], came third. Christian Heritage's support defected to United Future New Zealand, a merger of Future New Zealand (a successor to the Christian Democrats) and Peter Dunne's United New Zealand, which had occurred in 2000.\n\nIn 2003, Capill stepped down as party leader and Ewen McQueen succeeded him. The party renamed itself ''Christian Heritage New Zealand'' (CHNZ).\n\nIn 2005 a court convicted former leader Capill for the repeated rape and sexual violation of a girl aged eight, and jailed him for nine years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3345358a10,00.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 July 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050716045254/http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3345358a10,00.html |archive-date=16 July 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nThe new Christian Heritage leadership condemned Capill's conduct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chnz.org.nz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=105&Itemid=47 |accessdate=16 February 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 October 2006, ex-CHNZ Leader Ewen McQueen announced that Christian Heritage would disband<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3817191a11,00.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 October 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015015/http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3817191a11,00.html |archive-date=30 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> \nto allow \"new things to arise in Christian politics in New Zealand\". Former Christian Heritage Leader, Ewen McQueen announced that the hypothetical new party would \"make a strong and clear stand for the importance of family life, the primacy of marriage and the sanctity of human life.\" McQueen later joined the [[New Zealand National Party]] and unsuccessfully stood for the nomination for the [[Epsom (New Zealand electorate)|Epsom]] electorate in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10739361|title=Paul Goldsmith chosen as new National candidate for Epsom|work=The New Zealand Herald}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2007}} debate continued over whether Christian Heritage ever amounted to anything more than a \"[[testimonial party]]\". As noted above, this model of politics refers to a particular model of partisan 'politics of principle' that eschews pragmatic political objectives. If this is the case, then there are certain implications. As the Netherlands has a demographically based electoral system, this means that the testimonial party model could rely on Reformed fundamentalist constituencies in [[Zeeland]], [[Veluwe]] and parts of [[Overijssel]], the Dutch \"[[Bible Belt (Netherlands)|Bible Belt]].\" However, New Zealand's [[Mixed Member Proportional]] electoral system imposes a five percent threshold before a party that has no constituency seat representation can be represented within the New Zealand Parliament, as does its own German model. As CHNZ never cleared that threshold, it may therefore be seen as an imported 'testimonial party' model that did not work in a foreign political context or electoral system.\n\nBy contrast, [[United Future New Zealand]] worked that same electoral system well. However, Christian Heritage's constitution seemed to rule out Christian Heritage functioning as a purely \"testimonial party\". While it allowed as an objective of the party to \"promote and uphold biblical principles\", the constitution went on to state that the party had as a goal to \"gain seats in parliament so that it can have a direct influence on legislation, policy, and the governing of New Zealand.\"\n\n==== Christian Democrats, Future NZ, and the Kiwi Party ====\n\nThe Christian Democrats, by contrast, took a considerably different path. Not long after the Christian Coalition fell apart, Graeme Lee announced that he would step down as leader of the party. He had contemplated retiring for some time, and had already determined that if the Coalition failed he would make his exit from politics. For some considerable period of time the party remained with Lee as temporary leader, as no satisfactory new candidate had emerged. Eventually [[Anthony Walton (politician)|Anthony Walton]] became its new leader. Under Walton, the Christian Democrats went further down the non-confessional path, removing all explicit references to Christianity from their party platform. The party adopted the name \"[[Future New Zealand]]\" (rejecting \"Future Vision\" as a proposed alternative), and positioned itself as a \"values-based\" rather than as a religion-based party.\n\nFuture New Zealand contested the 1999 general election but gained only 1.1% of the party vote. The party considered becoming an apolitical [[lobby group|lobby-group]], but led by its General Secretary, [[Murray Smith (New Zealand politician)|Murray Smith]], who had instigated discussions with [[Peter Dunne]], the leader of [[United New Zealand]] and the holder of a \"safe\" [[constituency]] seat, the party decided to explore a coalition with United New Zealand instead. Following further discussions with United, the two parties entered into a coalition to contest the 2002 general election under the name [[United Future New Zealand]]. The group gained 6.7% of the party vote, giving it eight seats.  In 2003 the two parties merged. For a time there was debate as to whether to classify the resultant group as a Christian party, but the party's rejection of that label appears to have clarified matters. According to United Future, the party does indeed have a grounding in traditional values, but remains open to anyone who shares those values, not merely to Christians.\n\nIn the [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005 general election]], United Future's support slump to 2.67%, leaving it with only three MPs. The precise reasons for this remain difficult to identify, but it appears that many former Christian supporters of United Future cast their votes for the National Party in the 2005 election.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\nIn 2006\u20132007, Peter Dunne decided to vote in favour of a bill banning parental [[corporal punishment]] of children, while his surviving party caucus-members, [[Gordon Copeland]] and [[Judy Turner]] voted against it. As a result of Dunne's exercise of his right to a [[conscience vote]] over this issue, Gordon Copeland seceded from the United Future caucus. Copeland and former UFNZ List MP [[Larry Baldock]] announced their intention to re-form an independent Future New Zealand party{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} (renamed [[the Kiwi Party]] on 25 January 2008). Baldock has said that over one hundred former UFNZ board members and candidates joined them.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} However, UFNZ President [[Denise Krum]] contested Baldock's assertion over resignations. According to its website, [[Future New Zealand]]  enrolling the five hundred party-members required for registration under the Electoral Act 1993. It remains unclear whether these figures represent former disgruntled FNZ members who had quit after the merger with United, or new supporters, possibly from the disintegrated [[Christian Heritage New Zealand]].\n\nIn the event, the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 general election]] was a disappointment for the Kiwi Party. They polled 11,658 votes in total, only 0.54% of the total party votes cast for all New Zealand political parties, and far short of the five-percent threshold required for list-only electoral representation. It even polled behind the avowedly satirical [[Bill and Ben Party]].\n\nOn 14 October 2011 the Kiwi Party announced that it would not be standing any candidates in the 2011 general election, and that several members had joined the Conservative Party and would be standing for it. On 8 February 2012 the Kiwi Party was de-registered as a political party under the Electoral Act 1993, at its own request and was disbanded.\n\n==== Destiny New Zealand (2005\u20132007) and the Family Party (2007\u20132010) ====\n\nIn 2003 another Christian party was formed in New Zealand: [[Destiny New Zealand]], based on the evangelical [[Destiny Church (New Zealand)|Destiny Church]] pastored by controversial figure [[Brian Tamaki]]. Bishop Tamaki claimed that Destiny would rule New Zealand by 2008, but in the 2005 general election the party only polled 0.6%, far short of the support required to enter Parliament. This was also far short of the over 2% support managed by the Christian Heritage Party in 1993 and 1999.\n\nIn April 2007, Brian Tamaki and Samoan-born evangelical Christian and independent former [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] MP for [[Mangere]] [[Taito Phillip Field]] held talks about a possible rapprochement between Destiny New Zealand and Field's fledgling \"Pacific Party\".<ref>[http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/newsdetail1.asp?storyID=116347 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429210827/http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/newsdetail1.asp?storyID=116347 |date=29 April 2007 }}</ref>\nHowever, Field was under police investigation for allegedly questionable financial dealings.\n\nOn 18 September 2007, Destiny New Zealand announced that it would de-register itself under the terms of the Electoral Act 1993 to allow the formation of a new composite evangelical/fundamentalist political party. This would have become an amalgam of Destiny New Zealand, [[Future New Zealand]] and Taito Phillip Field, if the latter survived the criminal investigations. [[Richard Lewis (New Zealand politician)|Richard Lewis]] and [[Gordon Copeland]] would have become joint leaders of the new fundamentalist party. However, reports emerged that Copeland and Future New Zealand had refused to work with Lewis, and had sought to marginalise Brian Tamaki's influence in the proposed new party. This led to recriminations from the National Advisory Committee established to advance this process, including former UFNZ MP [[Paul Adams (New Zealand politician)|Paul Adams]] and a representative of Field.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/4208556a11.htm |title=Speed wobbles hit Christian party plan |date=20 September 2007 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nRichard Lewis and Paul Adams became co-leaders of the [[The Family Party|Family Party]], which hoped to harness [[Pacific Island]] immigrant [[evangelicalism|evangelical]]s in Mangere, [[South Auckland]], who traditionally vote for the Labour Party. [[Jerry Filipaina]] stood as their Mangere candidate in the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 general election]], running against Taito Phillip Field who had formed the [[New Zealand Pacific Party]]. The Family Party's hopes proved futile, winning 999 votes in Mangere and coming fourth. Labour's [[William Sio]] retook the seat for his party from Taito Phillip Field by 7126 votes. Altogether, the Family Party accumulated only 8176 (0.35%) of total party votes cast in New Zealand,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.org.nz|title=Electoral Commission}}</ref> and disbanded in 2010.\n\nThe New Zealand Pacific Party polled only 8640 (0.37 percent) of the total party votes cast, and did not win another anchoring constituency seat, it lacked representation in the 49th New Zealand Parliament.

The Ratana Church, established by [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] spiritual leader [[T. W. Ratana|Tahupotiki Wiremu Ratana]] in 1925, gained particularly strong support from M\u0101ori of lower socio-economic status. The Ratana movement actively participated in the world of politics, and the first Ratana Member of Parliament gained election in a [[1932 Southern Maori by-election|1932 by-election]].\n\nIn [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]], the Ratana movement co-operated closely with the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]], the rising force in New Zealand politics in the 1930s. In the [[1935 New Zealand general election|1935 elections]], Ratana won two of the four of the M\u0101ori seats, and shortly afterwards, allied itself with the Labour Party, which had won the election. The Labour Party and the Ratana movement have remained closely allied since this point, although the alliance has grown strained at times, and both National and the Maori Party also vie for their support.<ref name=\"Stuff.co.nz_805876\">{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/805876 |title=Large political contingents head to Ratana |date=22 January 2009 |work=[[NZPA]] |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Piri Wiri Tua Movement===\nIn {{As of|2007|alt= recent}} years at least one independent attempt has occurred to bring the Ratana religion to politics \u2014 the [[Piri Wiri Tua Movement|Piri Wiri Tua]] party, although not part of the Ratana Church, has strong roots in Ratanadom.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Religion in New Zealand]]\n* [[Family First New Zealand]]\n* [[Politics of New Zealand]]\n* [[Raven-Taylor-Hales Brethren]] (Exclusive Brethren)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* J.Cocker and J.Malton Murray (eds) ''Temperance and Prohibition in New Zealand'': the New Zealand Alliance for Abolition of the Liquor Trade: [Electronic Resource]: 2005: [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-MurTemp.html]\n* Allan Davidson: ''Christianity in Aotearoa: A History of Church and Society in New Zealand:'' Wellington: The New Zealand Education for Ministry Board: 2004. {{ISBN|0-476-00229-X}}\n* Pauline Engel: ''The Abolition of Capital Punishment in New Zealand'': Wellington: Department of Justice: 1977.\n* Maureen Goring: \"Lex Talionis and the Christian Churches: The Question of Capital Punishment in New Zealand\" in James Veitch (ed) ''To Strive and Not to Yield: Essays in Honour of Colin Brown''.
