Two years later, the artist came to prominence as a singer after the release of \"Trava Trava\". A hit on [[Spotify]] and [[YouTube]], it led to a national tour and to the release of the [[extended play]] (EP) ''Clark Boom'' in 2016. In the following year, the EP spawned hits like \"Chifrudo\", \"TOME CUrtindo\" and \"Boquet\u00e1xi\". The first two marked collaborations with trans singer {{ill|Mulher Pepita|pt}} and drag queen [[Pabllo Vittar]] respectively, while the latter was involved in a polemic when its YouTube video was restricted because of alleged improper sexual content.\n\nDuring 2018, Clark's singles \"Tipo de Garota\", \"Q.M.T.\" and \"Bumbum no Ar\" anticipated the release of the album, ''\u00c9 da Pista''. The latter song gained notoriety because of the partnership with [[Lexa (singer)|Lexa]] and its politically motivated music video.\n\n==Biography==\n===1992\u20132015: Early life and musical

Born in [[Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo]], Rhael grew up listening to [[Brazilian funk]]. Inspired by [[Valesca Popozuda]] and [[Tati Quebra-Barraco]], in 2014, Rhael became the drag queen \"Lia Clark\", working as DJ known to play funk. Two years later, the artist came to prominence as a singer after the release of \"Trava Trava\". A hit on [[Spotify]] and [[YouTube]], it led to a national tour and to the release of the [[extended play]] (EP) ''Clark Boom'' in 2016. In the following year, the EP spawned hits like \"Chifrudo\", \"TOME CUrtindo\" and \"Boquet\u00e1xi\". The first two marked collaborations with trans singer {{ill|Mulher Pepita|pt}} and drag queen [[Pabllo Vittar]] respectively, while the latter was involved in a polemic when its YouTube video was restricted because of alleged improper sexual content.\n\nDuring 2018, Clark's singles \"Tipo de Garota\", \"Q.M.T.\" and \"Bumbum no Ar\" anticipated the release of the album, ''\u00c9 da Pista''. The latter song gained notoriety because of the partnership with [[Wanessa Camargo]] and its politically motivated music video.\n\n==Biography==\n===1992\u20132015: Early life and musical

This was a homegrown engine derived from the engine used by Tata in their line of pick-ups and SUVs earlier, but with a shortened stroke. The original engine was designated as 483DL which stood for four-cylinder and 83-mm stroke.\n\nThe Indica offered options such as air conditioning and electric windows, which were previously restricted to upmarket imported cars in India. Three years later, the Indica was exported to European markets for the first time, and from 2003, the Indica was [[badge engineered]] and sold in Great Britain by [[MG Rover Group]] as the [[Rover CityRover|CityRover]]. This vehicle ceased production in April 2005 when Rover went bankrupt, and did not resume production when Rover's new Chinese owner [[Nanjing Automobile]] launched its own versions of the Rover range in 2007.\n\nThe outer body styling was designed by the Italian design house [[I.DE.A Institute]], under contract from Tata Motors, in close collaboration interaction with Tata's in-house design team. The engine, however, was indigenous.\n\nWhen first launched, the Indica prompted many complaints from early purchasers, who claimed that the vehicle did not deliver horsepower and gas mileage as promised.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} In response to the customer complaints, Tata Motors re-engineered the internals of the car and launched it as Indica V2 (version 2)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tatawestside.com/article/inside/!$$$!2XU!$$$!G9IArE=/TLYVr3YPkMU= |title=New Generation Indica V2 launched |publisher=[[Tata Motors|TataWestSide.com]]|date=31 January 2001 |accessdate=19 July 2018}}</ref>, which solved most of the complaints and emerged as one of the most sought-after cars in the Indian automobile industry.

It was released from LaBelle's first [[platinum album]], ''[[Winner in You]]'' and was written and produced by [[Burt Bacharach]] and his former wife [[Carole Bayer Sager]]. The song was originally recorded by singer [[Dionne Warwick]] for inclusion on her album ''[[Friends (Dionne Warwick album)|Friends]]''. It is unclear why the song was not included on the final track list. The song was based on a relationship that had reached its end with both parties going their separate ways in a melancholy state with the occasional option of coming back together again one day.\n\nIt was often stated{{by whom|date=September 2018}} the two performers were in separate cities when they recorded their individual parts which were then \"married\" during mixing.

The views from their respective porches, where they finished the song, made clear their separation by the continent.\n\n==Chart performance==\nThe song became the biggest hit single ever for both singers as it reached number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart for three weeks, as well as charting highly on the R&B and Adult Contemporary charts. In the United Kingdom, the song peaked at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]], going [[RIAA|gold]] (it was the 22nd best-selling single of 1986 in the United Kingdom). The song was initially not intended to be a duet at all, but LaBelle decided to invite McDonald to help her turn the song into a duet, as she stated: \"The song was sent to me and I did a version of it but somehow it just didn't quite work. We were going over things I'd done and we talked about turning it into a duet. Someone asked, 'If you could do it with anyone, who would you sing it with?', and Michael was my first choice.\"<ref>[http://www.infobuddy.com/articles/bios/pattilabellebio.html Patti LaBelle Biography<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1986)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref>{{Cite book|title=[[Kent Music Report|Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992]]|last=Kent|first=David|authorlink=David Kent (historian)|publisher=Australian Chart Book|location=[[St Ives, New South Wales|St Ives, NSW]]|year=1993|isbn=0-646-11917-6 }}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|12\n|-\n|Austrian Singles chart\n|align=\"center\"|20\n|-\n|Canadian ''RPM'' 100\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|Dutch Singles chart\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|New Zealand [[RIANZ]] chart\n|align=\"center\"|4\n|-\n|Swedish Singles chart\n|align=\"center\"|15\n|-\n|UK Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot Black Singles\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

It was released from LaBelle's first [[platinum album]], ''[[Winner in You]]'' and was written and produced by [[Burt Bacharach]] and his former wife [[Carole Bayer Sager]]. The song was originally recorded by singer [[Dionne Warwick]] for inclusion on her album ''[[Friends (Dionne Warwick album)|Friends]]''. It is unclear why the song was not included on the final track list. The song was based on a relationship that had reached its end with both parties going their separate ways in a melancholy state with the occasional option of coming back together again one day.\n\nIt was often stated{{by whom|date=September 2018}} the two performers were in separate cities when they recorded their individual parts which were then \"married\" during mixing. This was reflected in the music video produced to promote the song, which depicted LaBelle and McDonald performing the song simultaneously on different coasts.<ref>{{cite web|last=LaBelle|first=Patti|title=On My Own|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsH63qJlIMM|work=music video|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=April 18, 2013}}</ref> The singers were shown on separate sides of a split screen, each singing the song while walking through apartments which had identical layouts but different decor and furniture. The views from their respective porches, where they finished the song, made clear their separation by the continent.\n\n==Chart performance==\nThe song became the biggest hit single ever for both singers as it reached number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart for three weeks, as well as charting highly on the R&B and Adult Contemporary charts. In the United Kingdom, the song peaked at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]], going [[RIAA|gold]] (it was the 22nd best-selling single of 1986 in the United Kingdom). The song was initially not intended to be a duet at all, but LaBelle decided to invite McDonald to help her turn the song into a duet, as she stated: \"The song was sent to me and I did a version of it but somehow it just didn't quite work. We were going over things I'd done and we talked about turning it into a duet. Someone asked, 'If you could do it with anyone, who would you sing it with?', and Michael was my first choice.\"<ref>[http://www.infobuddy.com/articles/bios/pattilabellebio.html Patti LaBelle Biography<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1986)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref>{{Cite book|title=[[Kent Music Report|Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992]]|last=Kent|first=David|authorlink=David Kent (historian)|publisher=Australian Chart Book|location=[[St Ives, New South Wales|St Ives, NSW]]|year=1993|isbn=0-646-11917-6 }}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|12\n|-\n|Austrian Singles chart\n|align=\"center\"|20\n|-\n|Canadian ''RPM'' 100\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|Dutch Singles chart\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|New Zealand [[RIANZ]] chart\n|align=\"center\"|4\n|-\n|Swedish Singles chart\n|align=\"center\"|15\n|-\n|UK Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot Black Singles\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

It existed from 1922 to 2000, though for most of the period it was not the sole governing body in Ireland for either sport. Its refusal to recognise [[partition of Ireland|the partition of Ireland]] got it expelled from the [[International Amateur Athletics Federation]] (IAAF) and the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI). Clubs formerly in the NACAI are now affiliated to [[Athletics Ireland]] or [[Cycling Ireland]], each formed by the merger of the NACAI with rival bodies respectively affiliated to the IAAF and the UCI.\n\n==Foundation==\nThe NACA was formed on 19 July 1922,<ref name=\"OCallaghan5\">O'Callaghan (2012) p.5</ref> from a merger of the [[Irish Amateur Athletic Association]] or IAAA (including its subsidiary the [[cross country running|Cross Country]] Association of Ireland), the Irish Cycling Association (ICA) and the Athletics Council of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA).<ref name=\"athleticsireland\"/><ref name=\"cain\">{{Cite web |first=John |last=Sugden |author2=Scott Harvie |year=1995 |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/csc/reports/sugdenharvie/sugdenharvie95-1.htm |title=Sport and Community Relations in Northern Ireland}}</ref> The GAA was [[Irish nationalist]] and mainly rural, while the IAAA and ICA members were mainly [[Irish unionist|unionists]], universities, and the urban middle class. The IAAA was linked to the [[Amateur Athletic Association of England]] (AAA).\n\nThe unionist-dominated [[Northern Ireland]] and the nationalist [[Irish Free State]] had recently been separated politically, and the GAA was prepared to surrender its authority to ensure national unity in athletics and cycling and avoid a division which would reinforce the reality of partition. The GAA after 1923 thus restricted itself to [[Gaelic games]], ceding athletics and cycling to NACA, with which it remained on friendly terms.  [[John J. Keane (Olympics)|John J. Keane]], previously Chairman of the GAA Athletic Council, became first NACA President.<ref>O'Callaghan (2012) pp.1,4</ref> Whereas the GAA had [[Rule 21|a ban on members of the RUC and British Army]], the NACA narrowly voted not to introduce such a measure.<ref>Coyle 2003, p.192</ref>\n\nThe NACA affiliated to the IAAF on 11 January 1924,<ref name=\"OCallaghan5\"/> and sent teams to the Olympics of [[Ireland at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924]], [[Ireland at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928]], and [[Ireland at the 1932 Summer Olympics|1932]].<ref name=\"athleticsireland\"/> It also sent [[Ireland at the Commonwealth Games#1930|five athletes]] to the [[1930 British Empire Games]] in Canada. In each case, the team was claimed to represent \"Ireland\" rather than the Irish Free State.\n\nIn 1937, the National Cycling Association (NCA) was formed as a NACA subsidiary for cycling clubs, and affiliated to the UCI. The [[R\u00e1s Tailteann]] was its headline event, an 8-day stage race whose name reflected the [[Tailteann Games (ancient)|Tailteann Games]].\n\n==Splits and isolation==\nAlready by 1925 there was a split, with the Northern Ireland Amateur Athletic, Cycling and Cross Country Association (NIAAA) formed over a dispute concerning an Easter Monday sports meeting in Belfast, which as well as athletics featured [[greyhound racing]] and associated betting, which had been allowed by the IAAA but not by NACA.<ref name=\"reynolds\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/a-first-class-splitpolitical-conflict-in-irish-athletics-1924-40/ |title='A first-class split':political conflict in Irish athletics, 1924\u201340 |journal=History Ireland |volume=20 |issue=4 |date=July\u2013August 2012 |accessdate=27 May 2013 |first=Pearse |last=Reynolds |location=Dublin }}</ref> Since the meeting was to raise funds for [[Belfast Celtic F.C.]], with an [[Irish nationalist]] fanbase, the NACA alienated nationalists as well as unionists in Belfast.<ref name=\"reynolds\" /> The NIAAA affiliated to the English AAA in 1930, with its unionist president [[Thomas Moles]] encouraging links within the UK,<ref name=\"athleticsireland\"/><ref name=\"reynolds\" /> and [[Dawson Bates]], the [[Minister of Home Affairs (Northern Ireland)|NI Home Affairs minister]], lobbying the AAA.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hunt |first1=Tom |title=The National Athletic Association of Ireland and Irish Athletics, 1922\u20131937: steps on the road to athletic isolation |journal=Sport in Society |date=17 July 2015 |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=130\u2013146 |doi=10.1080/17430437.2015.1038918}}; reprinted as  {{cite book |editor-last1=Hassan |editor-first1=David |editor-last2=McElligott |editor-first2=Richard |title=A Social and Cultural History of Sport in Ireland |date=2018 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317326472 |chapter-url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=xnRUDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT310 |accessdate=30 July 2018 |language=en |chapter=Chapter 10}}</ref>\n\nIn 1931, [[Eoin O'Duffy]] was president of the NACA, and raised at the IAAF the dispute with the British AAA over jurisdiction over Northern Ireland.

It existed from 1922 to 2000, though for most of the period it was not the sole governing body in Ireland for either sport. Its refusal to recognise [[partition of Ireland|the partition of Ireland]] got it expelled from the [[International Amateur Athletics Federation]] (IAAF) and the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI).

The IAAA was linked to the [[Amateur Athletic Association of England]] (AAA).\n\nThe unionist-dominated [[Northern Ireland]] and the nationalist [[Irish Free State]] had recently been separated politically, and the GAA was prepared to surrender its authority to ensure national unity in athletics and cycling and avoid a division which would reinforce the reality of partition.

It saw action at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras]] and [[Battle of Passchendaele|Ypres]], before moving the the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian Front]]. It returned to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] to fight in the German [[Spring Offensive]] and the victorious Allied [[Hundred Days Offensive]].\n\n==Recruitment==\n[[File:30a Sammlung Eybl Gro\u00dfbritannien. Alfred Leete (1882\u20131933) Britons (Kitchener) wants you (Briten Kitchener braucht Euch). 1914 (Nachdruck), 74 x 50 cm. (Slg.Nr. 552).jpg|right|thumb|[[Alfred Leete]]'s recruitment poster for Kitchener's Army.]]\nOn 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular [[British Army]], and the newly-appointed [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Earl Kitchener of Khartoum]] issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1'.<ref>Army Council Instructions No 32 (6 August) and No 37 (7 August).</ref><ref>Becke, Pt 3a, pp. 2 & 8; Appendix I.</ref><ref name = Grist53>Grist, p. 53.</ref> A flood of volunteers poured into the recruiting offices across the country and were formed into 'Service' battalions of the county regiments. However, the Bristol Chamber of Commerce considered that the city's response was inadequate and formed a Bristol Citizens' Recruiting Committee under the leadership of the former Lord Mayor, Sir [[Herbert Ashman]], to encourage enlistment. The city's Colston Hall was opened as a recruiting centre on 14 August, and 2274 men enlisted by 2 September. Eighty men calling themselves the Weston Comrades Company also joined from [[Weston-super-Mare]]. It was clear that many of these men wanted to serve together in a special Bristol battalion, similar to other '[[Pals battalion]]s' being formed around the country. The [[War Office]] (WO) gave the committee authority to form the '''Bristol Battalion''', [[Gloucestershire Regiment]], on 30 August. Later in the year it became part of Kitchener's Fifth New Army (K5) and was officially numbered as the '''12th (Service) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment (Bristol)''', but the subtitle was usually rendered as 'Bristol's Own'. The recruiting committee encouraged 'mercantile and professional' men to apply, both through reasons of social exclusiveness and with a view to Kitchener's directive that workers in vital industries could not be spared. The first commanding officer (CO) was William Burges, who had retired from command of the 3rd Militia Battalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment some years before. Several of the other officers appointed had experience in the Regular or Auxiliary forces, and a number of junior officers had been members of their school or university [[Officer Training Corps]].<ref>Marks, pp. 8\u201320, 32\u20133, 39.</ref><ref name = Grist54>Grist, pp. 54\u20135.</ref><ref name = Daniell227>Daniell, p. 227.</ref><ref>Army Council Instructions, October 1914, Appendix VIII; December 1914, Appendix III.</ref><ref name = Frederick>Frederick, p. 102.</ref><ref name = James>James, p. 72.</ref><ref name = TrailGlos>[http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-british-infantry-regiments-of-1914-1918/gloucestershire-regiment/ Glosters at Long, Long Trail.]</ref><ref name = GlosCO>[http://www.ww1infantrycos.co.uk/gloucs.html Glosters at Infantry Battalion COs.]</ref>\n\n==Training==\nThe rush of recruits had overwhelmed the Army's ability to absorb them, so the Pals Battalions of K5 were left for some time in the hands of the recruiting committees. Initially the Bristol men lived at home and drilled by squads at Colston Hall in their civilian clothes, distinguished only by a lapel badge bearing the words 'New Bristol Battalion Gloucestershire Regt'. They then began battalion drills at the Artillery Grounds in [[Whiteladies Road]], the headquarters of the [[Gloucestershire Volunteer Artillery|I South Midland (Gloucestershire) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery]] of the [[Territorial Force]]. But in late September the recruiting committee persuaded the WO to buy up the site of the abandoned Bristol International Exhibition in Greville Smyth Park, the buildings of which were converted into barracks by the [[Royal Engineers]] and [[Army Service Corps]]. The 'Weston Comrades' joined the rest of the battalion here in November and were posted to D Company. Some of the battalion's best men were already being posted away, for officer training for example, and on 30 November the WO authorised the recruiting committee to raise a fifth, reserve company (E Company); F Company was raised as a further reserve in April 1915. Old rifles had been issued to the battalion for drill purposes, with just a few modern [[Lee-Enfield|Lee-Enfield]] .303 SMLE rifles for musketry training. Uniforms were finally received in December 1914. In March 1915 the battalion began field training by companies at [[Chipping Sodbury]].<ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Marks, pp. 22\u201331, 40\u201351, 69, 71.</ref><ref>[http://www.drillhalls.org/Counties/Gloucestershire/TownBristol.htm Bristol at Drill Hall Project.]</ref>\n\nThe locally-raised units to form K5 were assigned to brigades on 10 December 1914: the Bristol Battalion was brigaded with the 1st, 2nd and 3rd [[Birmingham Pals]] (later 14th, 15th and 16th (Service) Battalions, [[Royal Warwickshire Regiment]]). The brigade was\ninitially numbered 116th Brigade in 39th Division, but in April 1915 the WO decided to convert the K4 battalions into reserve units to train reinforcements for the K1\u2013K3 units, and on 27 April the K5 divisions were renumbered to take up the designations of the K4 formations. The short-lived 39th Division thus became [[32nd Division (United Kingdom)|32nd Division]] and 116th Brigade became [[95th Brigade (United Kingdom)|95th Brigade]].<ref name = TrailGlos/><ref>Army Council Instruction No 101 (10 December 1914).</ref><ref>Becke, Pt 3b, Appendix I2</ref><ref name = Becke32>Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 21\u201328.</ref><ref>Marks, p. 64.</ref>\n\nIn May 1915 the brigade was to have gathered in [[Shropshire]], but the ground selected at [[Prees Heath Army Camp|Prees Heath]] proved unsuitable for brigade training and on 23 June the 12th Gloucesters left Bristol to join 95th Brigade at [[Wensley, North Yorkshire]]. The two reserve or depot companies joined those of the Birmingham Pals at [[Sutton Coldfield]] to continue training. Brigade training started in earnest at Wensley, and 12th Gloucesters was finally adopted by the WO on 23 June 1915. Previously, most of the shooting had been on miniature ranges with .22 ammunition; now the men began weekly musketry courses (12th Gloucesters at [[Whitburn, Tyne and Wear|Whitburn]]) although many of the rifles were worn and defective. In August 32nd Division gathered on [[Salisbury Plain]] to begin final battle training, with 12th Gloucesters in camp at [[Codford]].<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Marks, pp. 79\u201389.</ref>\n\nThe battalion's strength at this time was about 1550, or more than 50 per cent over establishment; during August a large number of skilled men were transferred to other arms, others went to officer cadet training units, and older or unfit men were sent to the 15th (Reserve) Battalion at Sutton Coldfield into which the depot companies had been absorbed. Now that the battalion was almost ready to go overseas, the 59-year-old Lt-Col Burges was ordered to remain in the UK. He was succeeded in command by Lt-Col [[Martin Archer-Shee]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], a former Regular Army officer who was now [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Finsbury Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Finsbury Central]].<ref name = James/><ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Daniell227/><ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Marks, pp. 89\u201390, 95.</ref>\n\n==Service==\nOn 11 November 1915 32nd Division was ordered to join the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and 12th Gloucesters landed at [[Boulogne]] on 21 November. By 28 November the division had concentrated round [[Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher]], north of the [[Somme (river)|River Somme]]. For its initiation into trench warfare with experienced units of [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th Division]], 12th Gloucesters moved into a section of trenches thick with mud at [[Maricourt, Somme|Maricourt]] on 6 December. A Company was with 1st Bn [[East Surrey Regiment]] for instruction, and B Company with 2nd Bn [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]]. 95th Brigade was exchanged with a brigade from 5th Division on 26 December as part of a policy to even-up experience levels between formations. The Pals battalions were scattered among 5th Division's brigades; although 12th Gloucesters remained with 95th Brigade, it was now brigaded with three Regular Army battalions that had been fighting since the beginning of the war.<ref name = Grist54/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Grist, pp. 97\u20138.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 95\u2013106.</ref><ref name = Becke5>Becke, Part 1, pp, 65\u201371.</ref>\n[[File:Daily_Mail_Postcard_-The_High_Street_of_Guillemont.jpg|thumb|right|The high street of Guillemont, captured on 3 September.]]\n===Somme===\n5th Division moved to the [[Arras]] sector in mid-February 1916, and 12th Gloucesters took over dry, well-made trenches with deep dug-outs, and lived in cellars in Arras when out of the line.<ref>Grist, p. 100.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 111\u20135.</ref> Steel helmets began to be issued to British troops early in 1916, but there were great shortages: Lt-Col Archer-Shee used his position as an MP and own observations in the trenches to ask embarrassing questions of the [[Under-Secretary of State for War]].<ref name = Daniell227/>\n\nThe battalion's first real taste of offensive warfare came during the [[Battle of the Somme]]. The offensive had begun on 1 July, and 5th Division took over part of the line in the Delville Wood sector near [[Longueval]] between 18 and 20 July, where 95th Brigade was to deal with German strongpoints in the orchards. When the commander of 95th Brigade, [[Brigadier_(United_Kingdom)#Historical_rank_of_brigadier_general|Brigadier-General]] C.R. Ballard, was wounded on 20 July, Lt-Col Archer-Shee took temporary command until Brig-Gen Lord Esme Gordon-Lennox arrived to take over.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Marks, pp. 118\u20139.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 106\u20137, 141.</ref> From 23 to 26 July the battalion was in the front line and was heavily shelled, with [[High explosive shell|high explosive]], [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] and [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gas]], suffering many casualties. It went back into Longueval on 28 July, when the line was advanced to 'Duke Street' without opposition, but shelling was heavier than ever. At 15.30 next day 95th Brigade attacked to complete the capture of Longueval in support of the main attack (the [[Battle of Delville Wood]]). 12th Gloucesters put in two companies on the left of the brigade after a half-hour bombardment, and they successfully advanced the line some {{convert|500|yd|m}} beyond Duke Street. The battalion held these positions until relieved next day.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, pp. 140\u20131.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 119\u201327.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, p. 160.</ref>\n[[File:Glosters_at_Guillemont.png|thumb|right|12th Bn Gloucesters' attack at Guillemont, 3 September 1916.]]\nThe phase of the offensive that began on 22 July culminated in the [[Battle of Guillemont]]. The village of [[Guillemont]] had withstood repeated British attacks, but 5th Division made a new attempt on 3 September. The bombardment began at 08.30 and the attack began at 12.00, with the men advancing behind a [[Creeping barrage]] (a recent innovation) moving at {{convert|50|yd|m}} a minute; the men were instructed to keep within {{convert|25|yd|m}} of the bursting shells. However, a flanking position at Falfemont Farm, which should have been captured in the morning, was still in enemy hands and threatened 95th Brigade's advance. The two leading companies of 12th Gloucesters took their first objective, a sunken lane, and found the [[Dugout_(shelter)#World_War_I|dugouts]] beyond to be unoccupied. But then they came under [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire from a machine gun off to the right in the Falfemont direction, which caused numerous casualties before A Company eliminated it. At 12.50 the battalion moved on to its second objective, the German line between Wedge Wood and the south of Guillemont village, which was taken without too much trouble. It then moved on at 14.50 to the third objective, a sunken lane running north from Wedge Wood towards [[Ginchy]]. Amidst the devastation of the battlefield C Company mistook Leuze Wood for Wedge Wood, got too far ahead and were caught by their own artillery fire. Although no enemy could be seen at Leuze Wood, the battalion was ordered to halt and consolidate its position rather than push into an awkward [[Salient (military)|salient]].<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist151>Grist, pp. 151\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 132\u201340.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 252\u20134; Sketch 32.</ref>\n[[File:The_Battle_of_the_Somme,_July-november_1916_Q4287.jpg|thumb|left|12th Gloucesters moving up in support near Ginchy, 25 September 1916.]]\nThe 12th Gloucesters was now only 300 strong and took no active part in the [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette|Flers-Courcelette]] (18\u201322 September) though the battalion was later awarded it as a [[Battle honour]]. Although the battalion had been told that it would not have to go back into the line, it received a draft of 116 reinforcements and was given a role in 95th Brigade's next attack, the [[Battle of Morval]] on 25 September. The battalion was in support while 1st Bn [[Devonshire Regiment]] and 1st Bn East Surreys suffered heavy casualties taking the first and second objectives. 12th Gloucesters and 2nd [[King's Own Scottish Borderers]] then moved through the village of Morval itself and dug in on the far side. The battalion's casualties were 12 killed and 61 wounded. The next night the battalion was relieved and went into camp in Happy Valley.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist151/><ref>Marks, pp. 146\u20138.</ref>\n<ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 373\u20135.</ref>\n\nAccording to Lt-Col Archer-Shee, of the 950 members of 12th Gloucesters who entered the Battle of the Somme, 736 became casualties.<ref>Marks, p. 149.</ref> After the end of the Somme offensive the battalion continued to do duty in the appalling trenches in the area, alternating with tents in devastated [[Mametz, Somme|Mametz Wood]]. 5th Division moved to the [[B\u00e9thune]] sector in October and spent the next six months in this quieter area. On 22 October Lt-Col Archer-Shee returned to the UK for treatment to an old wound and was succeeded on 20 November by Lt-Col Robert Rawson, a Regular officer of the Gloucesters who had commanded 6th [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] for two years. Rawson also acted as 95th Brigade's commander during the winter. Archer-Shee returned to the battalion in January 1917, but resigned his command on 10 February 1917 to devote himself to his parliamentary duties. Rawson returned from Brigade HQ on 18 March and took over full command.<ref>Grist, pp. 182\u20137.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 150\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Arras===\n12th Gloucesters was in reserve to the [[Canadian Corps]] for the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] on 9 April. Then on the night of 4/5 May, as the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras Offensive]] continued, 95th Brigade relieved a Canadian Brigade that had captured [[Fresnoy-en-Gohelle|Fresnoy]]. Because of casualties, 12th Gloucesters was reduced to three companies, so it had two companies of 1st [[Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry]] (DCLI) under its command in order to hold the wood north of the town. During 7 May the British trenches were heavily bombarded, then that night two successive attacks came in. 12th Gloucesters repulsed the first at 03.45 (which may have been an unplanned clash as the German storm troops moved into position) but the battalion was overwhelmed by the second attack at 05.45, which completely broke through the British lines and recaptured Fresnoy. Rawson sent up D Company DCLI and his own C Company to try to restore the situation, followed later by D Company 12th Gloucesters, but all they could do was hold a sunken lane behind the lost positions until relieved at 10.00. The battalion lost 389 casualties, including 94 dead; A and B Companies had completely disappeared, killed or captured, and there were no officers left in the frontline companies.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Falls, ''1917'', Vol I, pp. 520\u20131.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 188\u201393.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 157\u201365.</ref>\n\n===Ypres===\n[[File:Hill-62-Museum-Tranches-Ypres-Belgium.jpg|thumb|right|Preserved trenches at [[Sanctuary Wood Museum Hill 62]]: when 12th Gloucesters were stationed here it was 'an unimaginably foul and miserable place'. There were no trees left and the battalion was sheltering in shell craters and dugouts.<ref>Grist, p. 213.</ref>]]\nThe battered battalions were slowly built up to strength and trained hard, but 12th Gloucesters did not see major action again until the latter stages of the [[Battle of Passchendaele|Third Ypres Offensive]]. 5th Division moved into [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps']] area on the night of 2/3 October during the [[Battle of Polygon Wood]], then attacked on 4 October (the [[Battle of Broodseinde]]). Launched at 06.00, 95th Brigade advanced {{convert|500|yd|m}} with the help of a tank to deal with German [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]]. 12th Gloucesters had been in reserve to the attacking battalion, 1st East Surreys, and moved three companies up into the Surreys' forming-up trenches 40 minutes after Zero hour, where they suffered badly from the German counter-barrage. Later in the morning C Company was sent up to help 1st Devons. The following day the battalion held the captured line, under continuing artillery fire. In preparation for the next attack (the [[Battle of Poelcappelle]] on 9 October), 12th Gloucesters was in [[Sanctuary Wood Museum Hill 62|Sanctuary Wood]], where it was under observation and artillery fire from the enemy and movement was restricted to duckboard tracks. On 8 October the battalion was split, with two companies providing carrying parties and the other two in the support line behind 1st Bn [[Cheshire Regiment]]. When the attack was delivered, the companies in Sanctuary Wood provided carrying and burial parties, while the two in the support line were pinned by artillery and could not be relieved until 10/11 October. Despite not actually attacking itself, 12th Gloucesters lost 359 casualties (150 from gas), of whom 88 died, in the period 1\u201312 October.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds, ''1917'', Vol II, pp. 314, 334.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 210\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 167\u201370.</ref>\n\nWhile 5th Division continued to attack (the Second Battle of Passchendaele), 12th Gloucesters remained out of the line after Poelcapelle, resting, absorbing a few reinforcements, and training. It spent two short spells holding the line, suffering only light casualties, and then the whole division was pulled out. At the end of October Lt-Col Rawson left the battalion for a six-month tour of duty in the UK and the second-in-command, Maj H.A. Colt, was promoted to succeed him.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, p. 214.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 170\u20131.</ref>\n\n===Italy===\nFollowing the Austro-German breakthrough at the [[Battle of Caporetto]], the BEF was required to release divisions to reinforce the [[Italian Army]]. On 23 November, 5th Division was warned that it would be moved to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]]. Entrainment began at [[Hesdin]] on 27 November, but after A and C Companies were got away, B and D were held back under orders to move at a moment's notice to the [[Cambrai]] sector, where the German counter-attack following the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] threatened to break through. The fighting died down after 3 December, and the two companies were released. 5th Division completed its concentration to the east of the [[Brenta (river)|River Brenta]], not far from [[Padua]], by 20 December. When 5th Division took over part of the line along the [[Piave (river)|River Piave]] on 27 January 1918 12th Gloucesters relieved an Italian unit, and was ordered to wear Italian helmets to conceal the fact that British troops had taken over. The battalion carried out several fighting patrols against the opposing Hungarian units until 5th Division was relieved on 18 March.<ref name = James/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds, ''1917'', Vol II, pp. 352, 391.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 222\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 174\u201380.</ref>\n\n===Spring Offensive===\nThe Germans began their [[Spring Offensive]] on the Western Front on 21 March and achieved rapid successes. On 24 March 5th Division was warned that it would return to France. Entrainment began on 1 April, 12th Gloucesters started on 2 April, and the division completed its concentration between [[Doullens]] and [[Fr\u00e9vent]] on 9 April.<ref name = James/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, pp. 224, 267.</ref><ref>Marks, p. 181.</ref>\n[[File:British_Lewis_gun_team_Battle_of_Hazebrouck_1918_IWM_Q_10902.jpg|thumb|right|A British Lewis gun team at the Battle of Hazebrouck]]\nThe second phase of the Spring Offensive (Operation Georgette, or the [[Battle_of_the_Lys_(1918)|Battle of the Lys]]) had opened on 7 April and 5th Division took up positions from the Lys Canal to the [[Nieppe|Forest of Nieppe]], where it came under immediate attack (the [[Battle_of_the_Lys_(1918)#Battle_of_Hazebrouck_(12\u201315_April)|Battle of Hazebrouck]]). On 13 April 12th Gloucesters held off one German attack for the loss of 76 casualties, including 18 killed. By 15 April the battalion was well dug in and held off another attack. The battalion was out of the line from 16 to 21 April, and then carried out an attack of its own on 22 April. Close behind a creeping barrage it captured Le Vert Bois Farm (later renamed 'Gloucester Farm') without serious opposition, but it took all day to take Le Vert Bois itself. The battalion captured three German machine guns and 39 prisoners. The Germans abandoned Operation Georgette a few days later. <ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, p. 267.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 182\u20135.</ref>\n\nOn 28 June the British launched a limited operation to improve their positions along the edge of the Nieppe Forest. 12th Gloucesters was tasked with capturing Le Cornet Perdu, moving up in darkness to attack at 06.00. It took all its objectives by 09.30, and pushed patrols up to the PLate Becq river, though a handful of German machine guns had caused 164 casualties, of whom 45 died.<ref name = Becke5/> <ref>Grist, p. 270.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 186\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Hundred Days Offensive===\nThe [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] launched their own [[Hundred Days Offensive]] on 8 August 1918, when 5th Division was in reserve. It then came into action at the [[Battle of Albert (1918)|Third Battle of Albert]] on 21 August. This was a three-phase attack, with 5th Division passing through [[37th Division (United Kingdom)|37th Division ]] for the second phase. 95th Brigade led, with 12th Gloucesters as its reserve. Once the second objective had been taken, 12th Gloucesters took over and despite having lost the barrage advanced over a mile of open country with some of 1st East Surreys and just reached the Arras\u2013[[Albert, Somme|Albert]] railway before meeting stronger opposition. Mist now hampered the artillery and tanks and the battalion was unable to push beyond the railway to the final objective. It had lost an officer and 11 other ranks killed, and nearly100 wounded. Next day the battalion consolidated, then drove off a German counter-attack at 17.30, capturing 180 prisoners and five machine guns in the process. On 23 August, reinforced by two companies of 1st DCLI, the battalion launched an attack at 11.00 behind a creeping barrage to capture the railway line itself. The Germans had numerous machine gun nests along it and caused numerous casualties before they were overrun. Having lost the barrage, the battalion was unable to advance beyond the ridge to [[Irles]], and requested reinforcements. Before they arrived, the neighbouring brigade attacked, so Lt-Col Colt led a charge by the remainder of 12th Gloucesters and the DCLI companies to capture the village, though losses were heavy: 30 men were killed and nine officers and 170 men wounded, including Lt-Col Colt (who was awarded the DSO). The previous CO, Lt-Col Rawson, returned to command the battalion.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Edmonds, ''1918'', Vol IV, pp. 191, 229\u201330.</ref><ref name = Grist275>Grist, p. 275.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 189\u201393.</ref> \n\nThe weakened battalion was withdrawn into reserve while the rest of 95th Brigade attacked on 30 August (the [[Battle of the Scarpe (1918)|Battle of the Scarpe]]) and then took over holding part of the front line. 95th Brigade was relieved on 4 September after the conclusion of the [[Second Battle of Bapaume]]. Part of 5th Division went into action at the [[Battle of \u00c9pehy]] on 18 September, and  12th Gloucesters later received the battle honour despite not being engaged.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist275/><ref>Edmonds, ''1918'', Vol IV, p. 363, 493.</ref><ref name = Grist279>Grist, p, 279.</ref>\n\nAll the Allied armies began a rolling offensive all the way along the Western Front on 26 September. The BEF's [[Third Army (United Kingdom)|Third Army]] stormed across the [[Battle of the Canal du Nord|Canal du Nord]] on 27 September, and next morning 5th Division launched a follow-up attack. Because the designated assault brigade ([[13th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|13th Brigade]]) had suffered heavy casualties, 95th Brigade was substituted for it at short notice and only just got to the jumping-off position in time for Zero hour at 02.40. It ran into considerable opposition and 12th Gloucesters found both its flanks were open; 1st DCLI came up on the left later, but the right remained  exposed and isolated German machine gun posts had to be dealt with using [[Rifle grenade|rifle grenades]]. It was not until 08.00 that the first village was taken. The brigade then had to resort to trench warfare methods to work its way up to the second objective on the slopes of Welsh Ridge by evening. 95th Brigade was also hung up when it attacked again next day, finding the pace of the creeping barrage too fast over broken ground. By the time it was relieved on 30 September 12th Gloucesters' casualties amounted to 52, 24 of them fatal, though it had taken about 120 prisoners.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist279/><ref>Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, ''1918'', Vol V, pp. 48, 118.</ref>\n\n==Disbandment==\nWhile 5th Division had been in Italy, the BEF's manpower shortage led to infantry brigades being reduced from four to three battalions. 5th Division's brigades had retained the four-battalion establishment, but by late 1918 the shortage of manpower was critical, and the division had to fall in line. As the only New Army battalion in 95th Brigade, 12th Gloucesters was ordered to disband and the remaining men were drafted to other units. 12th (Service) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, (Bristol's Own) commenced disbandment on 19 October 1918 while the [[Battle of the Selle]] was raging. Most of D Company was posted to 14th Warwicks, which became the divisional pioneer battalion. Others went to 1st Devons and 1st DCLI. The war ended less than a month later when the [[Armistice with Germany]] came into effect.<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, ''1918'', Vol V, p. 338.</ref><ref name = Marks194>Marks, p. 194.</ref>\n\nDuring its service the battalion had suffered losses of 32 officers and 754 other ranks killed. Of the original 990 men who landed in France in November 1915, 205 had died with the battalion, and over 100 more after being posted to other units.<ref name = Daniell227/><ref name = Marks194/><ref name = DaniellApp>Daniell, Appendix I.</ref>\n\n==15th (Reserve) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment==\n15th (Reserve) Battalion was formed at Sutton Coldfield on 31 August 1915 from the depot companies of the 12th (Bristol's Own) and 14th (West of England) Battalions of the Gloucesters. The 14th (Service) Battalion was a '[[Bantam (military)|Bantam]]' battalion that had been raised by the Bristol Citizens' Recruiting Committee on 22 April 1915. It moved to [[Chiseldon|Chiseldon Camp]] and joined [[22nd Reserve Brigade]]. The CO from 10 August 1915 to 31 August 1916 was Lt-Col Stephen Willcock.

It saw action at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras]] and [[Battle of Passchendaele|Ypres]], before moving the the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian Front]]. It returned to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] to fight in the German [[Spring Offensive]] and the victorious Allied [[Hundred Days Offensive]].\n\n==Recruitment==\n[[File:30a Sammlung Eybl Gro\u00dfbritannien. Alfred Leete (1882\u20131933) Britons (Kitchener) wants you (Briten Kitchener braucht Euch). 1914 (Nachdruck), 74 x 50 cm. (Slg.Nr. 552).jpg|right|thumb|[[Alfred Leete]]'s recruitment poster for Kitchener's Army.]]\nOn 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular [[British Army]], and the newly-appointed [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Earl Kitchener of Khartoum]] issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1'.<ref>Army Council Instructions No 32 (6 August) and No 37 (7 August).</ref><ref>Becke, Pt 3a, pp. 2 & 8; Appendix I.</ref><ref name = Grist53>Grist, p. 53.</ref> A flood of volunteers poured into the recruiting offices across the country and were formed into 'Service' battalions of the county regiments. However, the Bristol Chamber of Commerce considered that the city's response was inadequate and formed a Bristol Citizens' Recruiting Committee under the leadership of the former Lord Mayor, Sir [[Herbert Ashman]], to encourage enlistment. The city's Colston Hall was opened as a recruiting centre on 14 August, and 2274 men enlisted by 2 September. Eighty men calling themselves the Weston Comrades Company also joined from [[Weston-super-Mare]]. It was clear that many of these men wanted to serve together in a special Bristol battalion, similar to other '[[Pals battalion]]s' being formed around the country. The [[War Office]] (WO) gave the committee authority to form the '''Bristol Battalion''', [[Gloucestershire Regiment]], on 30 August. Later in the year it became part of Kitchener's Fifth New Army (K5) and was officially numbered as the '''12th (Service) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment (Bristol)''', but the subtitle was usually rendered as 'Bristol's Own'. The recruiting committee encouraged 'mercantile and professional' men to apply, both through reasons of social exclusiveness and with a view to Kitchener's directive that workers in vital industries could not be spared. The first commanding officer (CO) was William Burges, who had retired from command of the 3rd Militia Battalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment some years before. Several of the other officers appointed had experience in the Regular or Auxiliary forces, and a number of junior officers had been members of their school or university [[Officer Training Corps]].<ref>Marks, pp. 8\u201320, 32\u20133, 39.</ref><ref name = Grist54>Grist, pp. 54\u20135.</ref><ref name = Daniell227>Daniell, p. 227.</ref><ref>Army Council Instructions, October 1914, Appendix VIII; December 1914, Appendix III.</ref><ref name = Frederick>Frederick, p. 102.</ref><ref name = James>James, p. 72.</ref><ref name = TrailGlos>[http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-british-infantry-regiments-of-1914-1918/gloucestershire-regiment/ Glosters at Long, Long Trail.]</ref><ref name = GlosCO>[http://www.ww1infantrycos.co.uk/gloucs.html Glosters at Infantry Battalion COs.]</ref>\n\n==Training==\nThe rush of recruits had overwhelmed the Army's ability to absorb them, so the Pals Battalions of K5 were left for some time in the hands of the recruiting committees. Initially the Bristol men lived at home and drilled by squads at Colston Hall in their civilian clothes, distinguished only by a lapel badge bearing the words 'New Bristol Battalion Gloucestershire Regt'. They then began battalion drills at the Artillery Grounds in [[Whiteladies Road]], the headquarters of the [[Gloucestershire Volunteer Artillery|I South Midland (Gloucestershire) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery]] of the [[Territorial Force]]. But in late September the recruiting committee persuaded the WO to buy up the site of the abandoned Bristol International Exhibition in Greville Smyth Park, the buildings of which were converted into barracks by the [[Royal Engineers]] and [[Army Service Corps]]. The 'Weston Comrades' joined the rest of the battalion here in November and were posted to D Company. Some of the battalion's best men were already being posted away, for officer training for example, and on 30 November the WO authorised the recruiting committee to raise a fifth, reserve company (E Company); F Company was raised as a further reserve in April 1915. Old rifles had been issued to the battalion for drill purposes, with just a few modern [[Lee-Enfield|Lee-Enfield]] .303 SMLE rifles for musketry training. Uniforms were finally received in December 1914. In March 1915 the battalion began field training by companies at [[Chipping Sodbury]].<ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Marks, pp. 22\u201331, 40\u201351, 69, 71.</ref><ref>[http://www.drillhalls.org/Counties/Gloucestershire/TownBristol.htm Bristol at Drill Hall Project.]</ref>\n\nThe locally-raised units to form K5 were assigned to brigades on 10 December 1914: the Bristol Battalion was brigaded with the 1st, 2nd and 3rd [[Birmingham Pals]] (later 14th, 15th and 16th (Service) Battalions, [[Royal Warwickshire Regiment]]). The brigade was\ninitially numbered 116th Brigade in 39th Division, but in April 1915 the WO decided to convert the K4 battalions into reserve units to train reinforcements for the K1\u2013K3 units, and on 27 April the K5 divisions were renumbered to take up the designations of the K4 formations. The short-lived 39th Division thus became [[32nd Division (United Kingdom)|32nd Division]] and 116th Brigade became [[95th Brigade (United Kingdom)|95th Brigade]].<ref name = TrailGlos/><ref>Army Council Instruction No 101 (10 December 1914).</ref><ref>Becke, Pt 3b, Appendix I2</ref><ref name = Becke32>Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 21\u201328.</ref><ref>Marks, p. 64.</ref>\n\nIn May 1915 the brigade was to have gathered in [[Shropshire]], but the ground selected at [[Prees Heath Army Camp|Prees Heath]] proved unsuitable for brigade training and on 23 June the 12th Gloucesters left Bristol to join 95th Brigade at [[Wensley, North Yorkshire]]. The two reserve or depot companies joined those of the Birmingham Pals at [[Sutton Coldfield]] to continue training. Brigade training started in earnest at Wensley, and 12th Gloucesters was finally adopted by the WO on 23 June 1915. Previously, most of the shooting had been on miniature ranges with .22 ammunition; now the men began weekly musketry courses (12th Gloucesters at [[Whitburn, Tyne and Wear|Whitburn]]) although many of the rifles were worn and defective. In August 32nd Division gathered on [[Salisbury Plain]] to begin final battle training, with 12th Gloucesters in camp at [[Codford]].<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Marks, pp. 79\u201389.</ref>\n\nThe battalion's strength at this time was about 1550, or more than 50 per cent over establishment; during August a large number of skilled men were transferred to other arms, others went to officer cadet training units, and older or unfit men were sent to the 15th (Reserve) Battalion at Sutton Coldfield into which the depot companies had been absorbed. Now that the battalion was almost ready to go overseas, the 59-year-old Lt-Col Burges was ordered to remain in the UK. He was succeeded in command by Lt-Col [[Martin Archer-Shee]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], a former Regular Army officer who was now [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Finsbury Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Finsbury Central]].<ref name = James/><ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Daniell227/><ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Marks, pp. 89\u201390, 95.</ref>\n\n==Service==\nOn 11 November 1915 32nd Division was ordered to join the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and 12th Gloucesters landed at [[Boulogne]] on 21 November. By 28 November the division had concentrated round [[Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher]], north of the [[Somme (river)|River Somme]]. For its initiation into trench warfare with experienced units of [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th Division]], 12th Gloucesters moved into a section of trenches thick with mud at [[Maricourt, Somme|Maricourt]] on 6 December. A Company was with 1st Bn [[East Surrey Regiment]] for instruction, and B Company with 2nd Bn [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]]. 95th Brigade was exchanged with a brigade from 5th Division on 26 December as part of a policy to even-up experience levels between formations. The Pals battalions were scattered among 5th Division's brigades; although 12th Gloucesters remained with 95th Brigade, it was now brigaded with three Regular Army battalions that had been fighting since the beginning of the war.<ref name = Grist54/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Grist, pp. 97\u20138.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 95\u2013106.</ref><ref name = Becke5>Becke, Part 1, pp, 65\u201371.</ref>\n[[File:Daily_Mail_Postcard_-The_High_Street_of_Guillemont.jpg|thumb|right|The high street of Guillemont, captured on 3 September.]]\n===Somme===\n5th Division moved to the [[Arras]] sector in mid-February 1916, and 12th Gloucesters took over dry, well-made trenches with deep dug-outs, and lived in cellars in Arras when out of the line.<ref>Grist, p. 100.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 111\u20135.</ref> Steel helmets began to be issued to British troops early in 1916, but there were great shortages: Lt-Col Archer-Shee used his position as an MP and own observations in the trenches to ask embarrassing questions of the [[Under-Secretary of State for War]].<ref name = Daniell227/>\n\nThe battalion's first real taste of offensive warfare came during the [[Battle of the Somme]]. The offensive had begun on 1 July, and 5th Division took over part of the line in the Delville Wood sector near [[Longueval]] between 18 and 20 July, where 95th Brigade was to deal with German strongpoints in the orchards. When the commander of 95th Brigade, [[Brigadier_(United_Kingdom)#Historical_rank_of_brigadier_general|Brigadier-General]] C.R. Ballard, was wounded on 20 July, Lt-Col Archer-Shee took temporary command until Brig-Gen Lord Esme Gordon-Lennox arrived to take over.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Marks, pp. 118\u20139.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 106\u20137, 141.</ref> From 23 to 26 July the battalion was in the front line and was heavily shelled, with [[High explosive shell|high explosive]], [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] and [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gas]], suffering many casualties. It went back into Longueval on 28 July, when the line was advanced to 'Duke Street' without opposition, but shelling was heavier than ever. At 15.30 next day 95th Brigade attacked to complete the capture of Longueval in support of the main attack (the [[Battle of Delville Wood]]). 12th Gloucesters put in two companies on the left of the brigade after a half-hour bombardment, and they successfully advanced the line some {{convert|500|yd|m}} beyond Duke Street. The battalion held these positions until relieved next day.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, pp. 140\u20131.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 119\u201327.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, p. 160.</ref>\n[[File:Glosters_at_Guillemont.png|thumb|right|12th Bn Gloucesters' attack at Guillemont, 3 September 1916.]]\nThe phase of the offensive that began on 22 July culminated in the [[Battle of Guillemont]]. The village of [[Guillemont]] had withstood repeated British attacks, but 5th Division made a new attempt on 3 September. The bombardment began at 08.30 and the attack began at 12.00, with the men advancing behind a [[Creeping barrage]] (a recent innovation) moving at {{convert|50|yd|m}} a minute; the men were instructed to keep within {{convert|25|yd|m}} of the bursting shells. However, a flanking position at Falfemont Farm, which should have been captured in the morning, was still in enemy hands and threatened 95th Brigade's advance. The two leading companies of 12th Gloucesters took their first objective, a sunken lane, and found the [[Dugout_(shelter)#World_War_I|dugouts]] beyond to be unoccupied. But then they came under [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire from a machine gun off to the right in the Falfemont direction, which caused numerous casualties before A Company eliminated it. At 12.50 the battalion moved on to its second objective, the German line between Wedge Wood and the south of Guillemont village, which was taken without too much trouble. It then moved on at 14.50 to the third objective, a sunken lane running north from Wedge Wood towards [[Ginchy]]. Amidst the devastation of the battlefield C Company mistook Leuze Wood for Wedge Wood, got too far ahead and were caught by their own artillery fire. Although no enemy could be seen at Leuze Wood, the battalion was ordered to halt and consolidate its position rather than push into an awkward [[Salient (military)|salient]].<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist151>Grist, pp. 151\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 132\u201340.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 252\u20134; Sketch 32.</ref>\n[[File:The_Battle_of_the_Somme,_July-november_1916_Q4287.jpg|thumb|left|12th Gloucesters moving up in support near Ginchy, 25 September 1916.]]\nThe 12th Gloucesters was now only 300 strong and took no active part in the [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette|Flers-Courcelette]] (18\u201322 September) though the battalion was later awarded it as a [[Battle honour]]. Although the battalion had been told that it would not have to go back into the line, it received a draft of 116 reinforcements and was given a role in 95th Brigade's next attack, the [[Battle of Morval]] on 25 September. The battalion was in support while 1st Bn [[Devonshire Regiment]] and 1st Bn East Surreys suffered heavy casualties taking the first and second objectives. 12th Gloucesters and 2nd [[King's Own Scottish Borderers]] then moved through the village of Morval itself and dug in on the far side. The battalion's casualties were 12 killed and 61 wounded. The next night the battalion was relieved and went into camp in Happy Valley.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist151/><ref>Marks, pp. 146\u20138.</ref>\n<ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 373\u20135.</ref>\n\nAccording to Lt-Col Archer-Shee, of the 950 members of 12th Gloucesters who entered the Battle of the Somme, 736 became casualties.<ref>Marks, p. 149.</ref> After the end of the Somme offensive the battalion continued to do duty in the appalling trenches in the area, alternating with tents in devastated [[Mametz, Somme|Mametz Wood]]. 5th Division moved to the [[B\u00e9thune]] sector in October and spent the next six months in this quieter area. On 22 October Lt-Col Archer-Shee returned to the UK for treatment to an old wound and was succeeded on 20 November by Lt-Col Robert Rawson, a Regular officer of the Gloucesters who had commanded 6th [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] for two years. Rawson also acted as 95th Brigade's commander during the winter. Archer-Shee returned to the battalion in January 1917, but resigned his command on 10 February 1917 to devote himself to his parliamentary duties. Rawson returned from Brigade HQ on 18 March and took over full command.<ref>Grist, pp. 182\u20137.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 150\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Arras===\n12th Gloucesters was in reserve to the [[Canadian Corps]] for the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] on 9 April. Then on the night of 4/5 May, as the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras Offensive]] continued, 95th Brigade relieved a Canadian Brigade that had captured [[Fresnoy-en-Gohelle|Fresnoy]]. Because of casualties, 12th Gloucesters was reduced to three companies, so it had two companies of 1st [[Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry]] (DCLI) under its command in order to hold the wood north of the town. During 7 May the British trenches were heavily bombarded, then that night two successive attacks came in. 12th Gloucesters repulsed the first at 03.45 (which may have been an unplanned clash as the German storm troops moved into position) but the battalion was overwhelmed by the second attack at 05.45, which completely broke through the British lines and recaptured Fresnoy. Rawson sent up D Company DCLI and his own C Company to try to restore the situation, followed later by D Company 12th Gloucesters, but all they could do was hold a sunken lane behind the lost positions until relieved at 10.00. The battalion lost 389 casualties, including 94 dead; A and B Companies had completely disappeared, killed or captured, and there were no officers left in the frontline companies.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Falls, ''1917'', Vol I, pp. 520\u20131.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 188\u201393.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 157\u201365.</ref>\n\n===Ypres===\n[[File:Hill-62-Museum-Tranches-Ypres-Belgium.jpg|thumb|right|Preserved trenches at [[Sanctuary Wood Museum Hill 62]]: when 12th Gloucesters were stationed here it was 'an unimaginably foul and miserable place'.

Launched at 06.00, 95th Brigade advanced {{convert|500|yd|m}} with the help of a tank to deal with German [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]]. 12th Gloucesters had been in reserve to the attacking battalion, 1st [[East Surrey Regiment]], and moved three companies up into the Surreys' forming-up trenches 40 minutes after Zero hour, where they suffered badly from the German counter-barrage. Later in the morning C Company was sent up to help 1st [[Devonshire Regiment]]. The following day the battalion held the captured line, under continuing artillery fire. In preparation for the next attack (the [[Battle of Poelcappelle]] on 9 October), 12th Gloucesters was in [[Sanctuary Wood Museum Hill 62|Sanctuary Wood]], where it was under observation and artillery fire from the enemy and movement was restricted to duckboard tracks. On 8 October the battalion was split, with two companies providing carrying parties and the other two in the support line behind 1st Bn [[Cheshire Regiment]]. When the attack was delivered, the companies in Sanctuary Wood provided carrying and burial parties, while the two in the support line were pinned by artillery and could not be relieved until 10/11 October. Despite not actually attacking itself, 12th Gloucesters lost 359 casualties (150 from gas), of whom 88 died, in the period 1\u201312 October.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds, ''1917'', Vol II, pp. 314, 334.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 210\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 167\u201370.</ref>\n\nWhile 5th Division continued to attack (the Second Battle of Passchendaele), 12th Gloucesters remained out of the line after Poelcapelle, resting, absorbing a few reinforcements, and training. It spent two short spells holding the line, suffering only light casualties, and then the whole division was pulled out. At the end of October Lt-Col Rawson left the battalion for a six-month tour of duty in the UK and the second-in-command, Maj H.A. Colt, was promoted to succeed him.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, p. 214.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 170\u20131.</ref>\n\n===Italy===\nFollowing the Austro-German breakthrough at the [[Battle of Caporetto]], the BEF was required to release divisions to reinforce the [[Italian Army]]. On 23 November, 5th Division was warned that it would be moved to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]]. Entrainment began at [[Hesdin]] on 27 November, but after A and C Companies were got away, B and D were held back under orders to move at a moment's notice to the [[Cambrai]] sector, where the German counter-attack following the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] threatened to break through. The fighting died down after 3 December, and the two companies were released. 5th Division completed its concentration to the east of the [[Brenta (river)|River Brenta]], not far from [[Padua]], by 20 December. When 5th Division took over part of the line along the [[Piave (river)|River Piave]] on 27 January 1918 12th Gloucesters relieved an Italian unit, and was ordered to wear Italian helmets to conceal the fact that British troops had taken over. The battalion carried out several fighting patrols against the opposing Hungarian units until 5th Division was relieved on 18 March.<ref name = James/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds, ''1917'', Vol II, pp. 352, 391.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 222\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 174\u201380.</ref>\n\n===Spring Offensive===\nThe Germans began their [[Spring Offensive]] on the Western Front on 21 March and achieved rapid successes. On 24 March 5th Division was warned that it would return to France. Entrainment began on 1 April, 12th Gloucesters started on 2 April, and the division completed its concentration between [[Doullens]] and [[Fr\u00e9vent]] on 9 April.<ref name = James/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, pp. 224, 267.</ref><ref>Marks, p. 181.</ref>\n[[File:British_Lewis_gun_team_Battle_of_Hazebrouck_1918_IWM_Q_10902.jpg|thumb|right|A British Lewis gun team at the Battle of Hazebrouck]]\nThe second phase of the Spring Offensive (Operation Georgette, or the [[Battle_of_the_Lys_(1918)|Battle of the Lys]]) had opened on 7 April and 5th Division took up positions from the Lys Canal to the [[Nieppe|Forest of Nieppe]], where it came under immediate attack (the [[Battle_of_the_Lys_(1918)#Battle_of_Hazebrouck_(12\u201315_April)|Battle of Hazebrouck]]). On 13 April 12th Gloucesters held off one German attack for the loss of 76 casualties, including 18 killed. By 15 April the battalion was well dug in and held off another attack. The battalion was out of the line from 16 to 21 April, and then carried out an attack of its own on 22 April. Close behind a creeping barrage it captured Le Vert Bois Farm (later renamed 'Gloucester Farm') without serious opposition, but it took all day to take Le Vert Bois itself. The battalion captured three German machine guns and 39 prisoners. The Germans abandoned Operation Georgette a few days later. <ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, p. 267.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 182\u20135.</ref>\n\nOn 28 June the British launched a limited operation to improve their positions along the edge of the Nieppe Forest. 12th Gloucesters was tasked with capturing Le Cornet Perdu, moving up in darkness to attack at 06.00. It took all its objectives by 09.30, and pushed patrols up to the PLate Becq river, though a handful of German machine guns had caused 164 casualties, of whom 45 died.<ref name = Becke5/> <ref>Grist, p. 270.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 186\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Hundred Days Offensive===\nThe [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] launched their own [[Hundred Days Offensive]] on 8 August 1918, when 5th Division was in reserve. It then came into action at the [[Battle of Albert (1918)|Third Battle of Albert]] on 21 August. This was a three-phase attack, with 5th Division passing through [[37th Division (United Kingdom)|37th Division ]] for the second phase. 95th Brigade led, with 12th Gloucesters as its reserve. Once the second objective had been taken, 12th Gloucesters took over and despite having lost the barrage advanced over a mile of open country with some of 1st East Surreys and just reached the Arras\u2013[[Albert, Somme|Albert]] railway before meeting stronger opposition. Mist now hampered the artillery and tanks and the battalion was unable to push beyond the railway to the final objective. It had lost an officer and 11 other ranks killed, and nearly100 wounded. Next day the battalion consolidated, then drove off a German counter-attack at 17.30, capturing 180 prisoners and five machine guns in the process. On 23 August, reinforced by two companies of 1st DCLI, the battalion launched an attack at 11.00 behind a creeping barrage to capture the railway line itself. The Germans had numerous machine gun nests along it and caused numerous casualties before they were overrun. Having lost the barrage, the battalion was unable to advance beyond the ridge to [[Irles]], and requested reinforcements. Before they arrived, the neighbouring brigade attacked, so Lt-Col Colt led a charge by the remainder of 12th Gloucesters and the DCLI companies to capture the village, though losses were heavy: 30 men were killed and nine officers and 170 men wounded, including Lt-Col Colt (who was awarded the DSO). The previous CO, Lt-Col Rawson, returned to command the battalion.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Edmonds, ''1918'', Vol IV, pp. 191, 229\u201330.</ref><ref name = Grist275>Grist, p. 275.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 189\u201393.</ref> \n\nThe weakened battalion was withdrawn into reserve while the rest of 95th Brigade attacked on 30 August (the [[Battle of the Scarpe (1918)|Battle of the Scarpe]]) and then took over holding part of the front line. 95th Brigade was relieved on 4 September after the conclusion of the [[Second Battle of Bapaume]]. Part of 5th Division went into action at the [[Battle of \u00c9pehy]] on 18 September, and  12th Gloucesters later received the battle honour despite not being engaged.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist275/><ref>Edmonds, ''1918'', Vol IV, p. 363, 493.</ref><ref name = Grist279>Grist, p, 279.</ref>\n\nAll the Allied armies began a rolling offensive all the way along the Western Front on 26 September. The BEF's [[Third Army (United Kingdom)|Third Army]] stormed across the [[Battle of the Canal du Nord|Canal du Nord]] on 27 September, and next morning 5th Division launched a follow-up attack. Because the designated assault brigade ([[13th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|13th Brigade]]) had suffered heavy casualties, 95th Brigade was substituted for it at short notice and only just got to the jumping-off position in time for Zero hour at 02.40. It ran into considerable opposition and 12th Gloucesters found both its flanks were open; 1st DCLI came up on the left later, but the right remained  exposed and isolated German machine gun posts had to be dealt with using [[Rifle grenade|rifle grenades]]. It was not until 08.00 that the first village was taken. The brigade then had to resort to trench warfare methods to work its way up to the second objective on the slopes of Welsh Ridge by evening. 95th Brigade was also hung up when it attacked again next day, finding the pace of the creeping barrage too fast over broken ground. By the time it was relieved on 30 September 12th Gloucesters' casualties amounted to 52, 24 of them fatal, though it had taken about 120 prisoners.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist279/><ref>Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, ''1918'', Vol V, pp. 48, 118.</ref>\n\n==Disbandment==\nWhile 5th Division had been in Italy, the BEF's manpower shortage led to infantry brigades being reduced from four to three battalions. 5th Division's brigades had retained the four-battalion establishment, but by late 1918 the shortage of manpower was critical, and the division had to fall in line. As the only New Army battalion in 95th Brigade, 12th Gloucesters was ordered to disband and the remaining men were drafted to other units. 12th (Service) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, (Bristol's Own) commenced disbandment on 19 October 1918 while the [[Battle of the Selle]] was raging. Most of D Company was posted to 14th Warwicks, which became the divisional pioneer battalion. Others went to 1st Devons and 1st DCLI. The war ended less than a month later when the [[Armistice with Germany]] came into effect.<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, ''1918'', Vol V, p. 338.</ref><ref name = Marks194>Marks, p. 194.</ref>\n\nDuring its service the battalion had suffered losses of 32 officers and 754 other ranks killed. Of the original 990 men who landed in France in November 1915, 205 had died with the battalion, and over 100 more after being posted to other units.<ref name = Daniell227/><ref name = Marks194/><ref name = DaniellApp>Daniell, Appendix I.</ref>\n\n==15th (Reserve) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment==\n15th (Reserve) Battalion was formed at Sutton Coldfield on 31 August 1915 from the depot companies of the 12th (Bristol's Own) and 14th (West of England) Battalions of the Gloucesters. The 14th (Service) Battalion was a '[[Bantam (military)|Bantam]]' battalion that had been raised by the Bristol Citizens' Recruiting Committee on 22 April 1915. It moved to [[Chiseldon|Chiseldon Camp]] and joined [[22nd Reserve Brigade]]. The CO from 10 August 1915 to 31 August 1916 was Lt-Col Stephen Willcock. On 1 September 1916 it became 93rd Training Reserve Battalion in 22nd Reserve Bde and on 4 July 1917 it was redesignated 262nd (Infantry) Battalion of the Training Reserve. When the Training Reserve was reorganised in late 1917, the battalion became 51st (Graduated) Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment.<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Grist, p. 56.</ref><ref>[http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-british-infantry-regiments-of-1914-1918/royal-warwickshire-regiment/ Warwicks at Long, Long Trail.]</ref>\n\n==Commanding officers==\nThe following commanded the battalion during its service:<ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Marks, p 152 & Appendix I.</ref>\n* Lt-Col William Burges from 1 September 1914 to 12 August 1915\n* Lt-Col [[Martin Archer-Shee]] from 12 August 1915 to 22 October 1916\n* Maj W.A.R.

{"title_page": "Glossary of machine vision", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia glossary}}\n{{unreferenced|date=December 2011}}\nThe following are common definitions related to the [[machine vision]] field.\n\n'''General related fields'''\n* [[Machine vision]]\n* [[Computer vision]]\n* [[Image processing]]\n* [[Signal processing]]\n\n{{compact ToC|side=yes|top=yes|num=yes|center=yes}}\n\n==0-9==\n* '''[[FireWire|1394]]'''. FireWire is Apple Inc.'s brand name for the IEEE 1394 interface. It is also known as i.Link (Sony's name) or IEEE 1394 (although the 1394 standard also defines a backplane interface). It is a personal computer (and digital audio/digital video) serial bus interface standard, offering high-speed communications and isochronous real-time data services.\n* '''1D'''. One-dimensional.\n* '''[[2D computer graphics]]'''. The computer-based generation of digital images\u2014mostly from two-dimensional models (such as 2D geometric models, text, and digital images) and by techniques specific to them.\n[[File:Engine movingparts.jpg|thumb|left|250px|3D rendering example]]\n* '''[[3D computer graphics]]'''. '''3D computer graphics''' are different from [[2D computer graphics]] in that a [[Cartesian coordinate system#Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions|three-dimensional]] representation of geometric data is stored in the computer for the purposes of performing calculations and rendering 2D images. Such images may be for later display or for real-time viewing. Despite these differences, 3D computer graphics rely on many of the same [[algorithm]]s as 2D computer [[vector graphics]] in the [[wire frame model]] and 2D computer [[raster graphics]] in the final rendered display. In computer graphics software, the distinction between 2D and 3D is occasionally blurred; 2D applications may use 3D techniques to achieve effects such as lighting, and primarily 3D may use 2D rendering techniques.\n\n[[File:3D-Laserscanner on tripod.jpg|thumb|right|235px|3D-laser-scanner mounted on a tripod]]\n* '''[[3D scanner]]'''. This is a device that analyzes a real-world object or environment to collect data on its shape and possibly color. The collected data can then be used to construct digital, three dimensional models useful for a wide variety of applications.\n\n==A==\n* '''[[Defocus aberration|Aberration]]'''. Optically, defocus refers to a translation along the optical axis away from the plane or surface of best focus. In general, defocus reduces the sharpness and contrast of the image. What should be sharp, high-contrast edges in a scene become gradual transitions.\n* '''[[Aperture]]'''. In context of photography or machine vision, aperture refers to the diameter of the aperture stop of a photographic lens. The aperture stop can be adjusted to control the amount of light reaching the film or image sensor.\n* '''[[aspect ratio (image)]]'''. The aspect ratio of an image is its displayed width divided by its height (usually expressed as \"''x'':''y''\").\n* '''[[Angular resolution]]'''. Describes the resolving power of any image forming device such as an optical or radio telescope, a microscope, a camera, or an eye.\n* '''[[Automated optical inspection]]'''.\n\n==B==\n[[File:Wikipedia-barcode-128B.png|framed|left|\"''Wikipedia''\" encoded in Code 128-B]]\n* '''[[Barcode]]'''. A barcode (also bar code) is a machine-readable representation of information in a visual format on a surface.\n* '''[[Blob discovery]]'''. Inspecting an image for discrete blobs of connected pixels (e.g. a black hole in a grey object) as image landmarks. These blobs frequently represent optical targets for machining, robotic capture, or manufacturing failure.\n* '''[[Bitmap]]'''. A raster graphics image, digital image, or bitmap, is a data file or structure representing a generally rectangular grid of pixels, or points of color, on a computer monitor, paper, or other display device.\n\n==C==\n[[File:CVoverview2.svg|thumb|400px|Relation between Computer vision and various other fields]]\n* '''[[Camera]]'''. A camera is a device used to take pictures, either singly or in sequence. A camera that takes pictures singly is sometimes called a photo camera to distinguish it from a video camera.\n* '''[[Camera Link]]'''. Camera Link is a serial communication protocol designed for computer vision applications based on the National Semiconductor interface Channel-link. It was designed for the purpose of standardizing scientific and industrial video products including cameras, cables and frame grabbers. The standard is maintained and administered by the Automated Imaging Association or AIA, the global machine vision industry's trade group.\n* '''[[Charge-coupled device]]'''. A charge-coupled device (CCD) is a sensor for recording images, consisting of an integrated circuit containing an array of linked, or coupled, capacitors. CCD sensors and cameras tend to be more sensitive, less noisy, and more expensive than CMOS sensors and cameras.\n\n[[File:CIExy1931.png|left|thumb|325px|The CIE 1931 color space chromaticity diagram. The outer curved boundary is the spectral (or monochromatic) locus, with wavelengths shown in nanometers. Note that the colors depicted depend on the [[color space]] of the device on which you are viewing the image, and no device has a [[gamut]] large enough to present an accurate representation of the chromaticity at every position.]]\n* '''[[CIE 1931 color space|CIE 1931 Color Space]]'''. In the study of the perception of [[color]], one of the first mathematically defined [[color space]]s was the '''CIE XYZ color space''' (also known as '''CIE 1931 color space'''), created by the [[International Commission on Illumination]] (CIE) in 1931.\n* '''[[CMOS]]'''. CMOS (\"see-moss\")stands for complementary metal-oxide semiconductor, is a major class of integrated circuits. CMOS imaging sensors for machine vision are cheaper than CCD sensors but more noisy.\n*'''[[CoaXPress]]'''. CoaXPress (CXP) is an asymmetric high speed serial communication standard over [[coaxial]] cable. CoaXPress combines high speed image data, low speed camera control and power over a single coaxial cable. The standard is maintained by JIIA, the Japan Industrial Imaging Association\n* '''[[Color]]'''. The perception of the frequency (or wavelength) of light, and can be compared to how pitch (or a musical note) is the perception of the frequency or wavelength of sound.\n* '''[[Color blindness]]'''. Also known as color vision deficiency, in humans is the inability to perceive differences between some or all colors that other people can distinguish\n* '''[[Color temperature]]'''. \"White light\" is commonly described by its color temperature. A traditional incandescent light source's color temperature is determined by comparing its hue with a theoretical, heated black-body radiator. The lamp's color temperature is the temperature in kelvins at which the heated black-body radiator matches the hue of the lamp.\n* '''[[Color vision]]'''. CV is the capacity of an organism or machine to distinguish objects based on the [[wavelength]]s (or [[frequency|frequencies]]) of the [[light]] they reflect or emit.\n* '''[[computer vision]]'''. The study and application of methods which allow computers to \"understand\" image content.\n* '''[[contrast (vision)|Contrast]]'''. In visual perception, contrast is the difference in visual properties that makes an object (or its representation in an image) distinguishable from other objects and the background.\n* '''[[C mount|C-Mount]]'''. Standardized adapter for optical lenses on CCD - cameras. C-Mount lenses have a back focal distance 17.5&nbsp;mm vs. 12.5&nbsp;mm for \"CS-mount\" lenses. A C-Mount lens can be used on a CS-Mount camera through the use of a 5&nbsp;mm extension adapter. C-mount is a 1\" diameter, 32 threads per inch mounting thread (1\"-32UN-2A.)\n* '''[[CS-Mount]]'''. Same as [[C mount|C-Mount]] but the focal point is 5&nbsp;mm shorter. A CS-Mount lens will not work on a C-Mount camera. CS-mount is a 1\" diameter, 32 threads per inch mounting thread.\n\n==D==\n[[File:Datamatrix.svg|right|framed|\"''Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia''\" encoded in the DataMatrix 2D barcode]]\n* '''[[Data matrix (computer)|Data matrix]]'''. A two dimensional [[Barcode]].\n* '''[[Depth of field]]'''. In optics, particularly photography and machine vision, the depth of field (DOF) is the distance in front of and behind the subject which appears to be in focus.\n* '''[[Depth perception]]'''. DP is the [[visual perception|visual]] ability to perceive the world in three [[dimension]]s. It is a trait common to many higher [[animal]]s. Depth perception allows the beholder to accurately gauge the distance to an object.\n* '''[[Diaphragm (optics)|Diaphragm]]'''.

Lens controllers may be internal to a camera, a set of switches used manually, or a sophisticated device that allows control of a lens with a computer.\n* '''[[Lighting]]'''. Lighting refers to either artificial light sources such as lamps or to natural illumination.\n\n==M==\n* '''[[Metrology]]'''. Metrology is the science of measurement. There are lots of applications for machine vision in metrology.\n* '''[[machine vision]]'''. MV is the application of computer vision to industry and manufacturing.\n* '''[[Motion perception]]'''. MP is the process of inferring the speed and direction of objects and surfaces that move in a visual scene given some visual input\n\n==N==\n[[File:Neural network.svg|thumb|right|170px|Simplified view of an artificial neural network]]\n* '''[[Neural network]]'''. A NN is an interconnected group of artificial neurons that uses a mathematical or computational model for information processing based on a connectionist approach to computation. In most cases an ANN is an adaptive system that changes its structure based on external or internal information that flows through the network.\n* '''[[Normal lens]]'''. In machine vision a normal or entrocentric lens is a lens that generates images that are generally held to have a \"natural\" perspective compared with lenses with longer or shorter focal lengths. Lenses of shorter focal length are called wide-angle lenses, while longer focal length lenses are called telephoto lenses.\n\n==O==\n* '''[[Optical character recognition]]'''. Usually abbreviated to OCR, involves computer software designed to translate images of typewritten text (usually captured by a scanner) into machine-editable text, or to translate pictures of characters into a standard encoding scheme representing them in (ASCII or Unicode).\n* '''[[Optical resolution]]'''. Describes the ability of a system to distinguish, detect, and/or record physical details by electromagnetic means. The system may be imaging (e.g., a camera) or non-imaging (e.g., a quad-cell laser detector).\n* '''[[Optical transfer function]]'''.\n\n==P==\n[[File:lens aperture side.jpg|125px|thumb|right|Prime lens with a maximum aperture of [[f-number|f/2]]]]\n* '''[[Pattern recognition]]'''. This is a field within the area of machine learning. Alternatively, it can be defined as the act of taking in raw data and taking an action based on the category of the data. It is a collection of methods for supervised learning.\n* '''[[Pixel]]'''. A pixel is one of the many tiny dots that make up the representation of a picture in a computer's memory or screen.\n* '''[[Pixelation]]'''.

Mechanical assembly of lenses whose focal length is fixed, as opposed to a zoom lens, which has a variable focal length.\n\n==Q==\n* '''[[Q factor#Optical systems|Q-Factor (Optics)]]'''. In [[optics]], the ''Q'' factor of a [[resonant cavity]] is given by\n:<math>\nQ = \\frac{2\\pi f_o \\mathcal{E}}{P}\n</math>,\nwhere <math>f_o</math> is the resonant frequency, <math>\\mathcal{E}</math> is the stored energy in the cavity, and <math>P=-\\frac{dE}{dt}</math> is the power dissipated. The optical ''Q'' is equal to the ratio of the resonant frequency to the bandwidth of the cavity resonance. The average lifetime of a resonant [[photon]] in the cavity is proportional to the cavity's ''Q''. If the ''Q'' factor of a [[laser|laser's]] cavity is abruptly changed from a low value to a high one, the laser will emit a [[pulse]] of light that is much more intense than the laser's normal continuous output. This technique is known as [[Q-switching]].\n\n==R==\n* '''[[Region of interest]]'''. A Region of Interest, often abbreviated ROI, is a selected subset of samples within a dataset identified for a particular purpose.\n[[File:AdditiveColorMixiing.svg|100px|thumb|left|''A Representation of RGB additive color mixing.'']]\n* '''[[RGB]]'''. The RGB color model utilizes the additive model in which red, green, and blue light are combined in various ways to create other colors.\n* '''[[Region of interest|ROI]]'''. See Region of Interest.\n* '''[[Foreground, figure and objects]]'''. See also spatial-taxon.\n\n==S==\n* '''[[S-video]]'''. '''Separate video''', abbreviated '''S-Video''' and also known as '''Y/C''' (or ''erroneously'', [[S-VHS]] and \"super video\") is an [[analog signal|analog]] video signal that carries the video data as two separate signals (brightness and color), unlike [[composite video]] which carries the entire set of signals in one signal line. S-Video, as most commonly implemented, carries high-bandwidth [[480i]] or [[576i]] resolution video, i.e. [[standard definition]] video. It does not carry audio on the same cable.\n* '''[[Scheimpflug principle]]'''.\n* '''[[shutter (photography)|Shutter]]'''. A shutter is a device that allows light to pass for a determined period of time, for the purpose of exposing the image sensor to the right amount of light to create a permanent image of a view.\n* '''[[Shutter speed]]'''. In machine vision the shutter speed is the time for which the shutter is held open during the taking an image to allow light to reach the imaging sensor. In combination with variation of the lens aperture, this regulates how much light the imaging sensor in a digital camera will receive.\n* '''[[Smart camera]]'''. A smart camera is an integrated machine vision system which, in addition to image capture circuitry, includes a processor, which can extract information from images without need for an external processing unit, and interface devices used to make results available to other devices.\n* '''[[Spatial-Taxon]]'''.   Spatial-taxons are information granules, composed of non-mutually exclusive pixel regions, within scene architecture. They are similar to the Gestalt psychological designation of figure-ground, but are extended to include foreground, object groups, objects and salient object parts.  \n* '''[[Structured-light 3D scanner]]'''. The process of projecting a known pattern of illumination (often grids or horizontal bars) on to a scene. The way that these patterns appear to deform when striking surfaces allows vision systems to calculate the depth and surface information of the objects in the scene.\n* '''[[SVGA]]'''. Super Video Graphics Array, almost always abbreviated to Super VGA or just SVGA is a broad term that covers a wide range of computer display standards.\n\n==T==\n* '''[[Telecentric lens]]'''. Compound lens with an unusual property concerning its geometry of image-forming rays. In machine vision systems telecentric lenses are usually employed in order to achieve dimensional and geometric invariance of images within a range of different distances from the lens and across the whole field of view.\n* '''[[Telephoto lens]]'''. Lens whose focal length is significantly longer than the focal length of a normal lens.\n* '''[[Thermography]]'''. Thermal imaging, a type of [[Infrared imaging]].\n* '''[[TIFF]]'''. Tagged Image File Format (abbreviated TIFF) is a file format for mainly storing images, including photographs and line art.\n\n==U==\n* '''[[USB]]'''. Universal Serial Bus (USB) provides a serial bus standard for connecting devices, usually to computers such as PCs, but is also becoming commonplace on cameras.\n\n==V==\n* '''[[VESA]]'''. The Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) is an international body, founded in the late 1980s by [[NEC Corporation|NEC Home Electronics]] and eight other video display adapter manufacturers. The initial goal was to produce a standard for 800\u00d7600 [[SVGA]] resolution video displays.

A form of electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength in the range of 10 to 0.01 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 to 3000 [[petahertz|PHz]] (10<sup>15</sup> hertz). X-rays are primarily used for diagnostic medical and industrial imaging as well as crystallography. X-rays are a form of ionizing radiation and as such can be dangerous.\n\n==Y==\n* '''[[Y-cable]]'''. A '''Y-cable''' or '''Y cable''' is an [[electrical cable]] containing three ends of which one is a common end that in turn leads to a split into the remaining two ends, resembling the letter \"[[Y]]\". Y-cables are typically, but not necessarily, short (less than 12 inches), and often the ends connect to other cables. Uses may be as simple as splitting one [[Sound|audio]] or [[video]] [[communication channel|channel]] into two, to more complex uses such as splicing signals from a high density [[computer]] [[electrical connector|connector]] to its appropriate [[peripheral]] .\n\n==Z==\n[[File:Canon EF 70-200mm.jpg|thumb|left|100px|A 70-200mm [[Zoom lens]]]]\n* '''[[Zoom lens]]'''.
