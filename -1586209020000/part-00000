{"title_page": "History of the Ontario Hockey League", "text_new": "In 1970, the Junior A level was divided into two more levels, Tier I (Major Junior A) and Tier II (Minor Junior A). In 1974, the \"Major Junior A\" division of the OHA  became the '''Ontario Major Junior Hockey League''' (OMJHL) and began to operate independently of the OHA. Finally in 1980, the OMJHL became the '''Ontario Hockey League'''.\n\n==Ontario Hockey Association history==\nHockey started as a challenge series in the winter of 1889 when a team from [[Ottawa]] challenged teams from [[Lindsay, Ontario|Lindsay]] and [[Toronto]]. A year later the Ontario Hockey Association was formed on November 27, 1890 in Toronto at the [[Queen's Hotel, Toronto|Queen's Hotel]].\n\n===Junior hockey (1892\u20131933)===\nThe first junior teams started play in 1892, without enforced age limits; the first champions Kingston Limestones over Galt.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=Junior Ontario Championship |date=March 6, 1893 |page=8}}</ref> In 1896, the OHA re-organized into three divisions, senior, intermediate and junior. Junior hockey now became age-limited to players 20 years of age or younger by January 1 of the season being played. Out of its modest beginnings at the turn of the century, junior hockey quickly grew into an organized and entertaining brand of hockey. The end of [[World War I]] marked the beginning of the [[Memorial Cup]], the symbol of junior hockey supremacy in [[Canada]]. Teams from all across the [[province]] participated in provincial playoffs in the hope of winning the [[George Richardson Memorial Trophy]] and representing Eastern Canada in the Memorial Cup finals. As each year passed, the number of communities participating in junior hockey grew and the calibre of play increased.\n\n===OHA Junior 'A' (1933\u20131972)===\nFor the 1933\u201334 season, junior hockey was split into 'A' and 'B' divisions. Two new championship trophies were created at the same time. The 'A' level teams competing for the [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]] as OHA champions and the Memorial Cup as national champions. The 'B' level teams competed for the [[Sutherland Cup]], which is still Ontario's Junior B championship trophy.\n\nThe 1930s gave birth to noted teams such as the [[Oshawa Generals]], [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors|St. Michael's Majors]] and the [[Toronto Marlboros]]. Other notable teams of that era were the [[Toronto Young Rangers]], [[Toronto Native Sons]], and the [[Stratford Midgets]].\n\nThe 1940s welcomed new communities to the limelight such as the [[Barrie Flyers]], [[Guelph Biltmore Mad Hatters]], [[Stratford Kroehlers]] and the [[St. Catharines Teepees]]. The first version of the [[Windsor Spitfires]] also appeared in the 1940s only to fade away in the early 1950s.\n\nThe OHA awarded its first individual player trophies in 1945. The [[Red Tilson Trophy]] was awarded to the player voted \"Most Outstanding\" in the league. The [[Eddie Powers Memorial Trophy]] was awarded to the league's top scorer.\n\nThe 1950s saw other cities join in. The [[Kitchener Greenshirts]] entered the league only to move on to become the [[Peterborough Petes]]. Hamilton also joined as the [[Hamilton Tiger Cubs|Tiger Cubs]] (later the [[Hamilton Red Wings|Red Wings]]). The 1950s also saw inter-league play with [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League|Quebec-based teams]].\n\n====A divided league (1961\u201363)====\n[[Stafford Smythe]], owner of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], started the [[Metro Junior A League]] in an attempt to rival the OHA. The [[Toronto Marlboros]], who were owned by the Leafs, were withdrawn from the OHA and placed in a league with promoted Junior B teams including the [[Whitby Mohawks]], the [[Brampton Warriors|Brampton 7 Ups]], and the [[Unionville Seaforths]]. The other member of the league was the former [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors|St. Michael's Majors]] franchise, who would be later transferred to [[Toronto Neil McNeil Maroons|Neil McNeil High School]] in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Ontario]]. [[David Bauer (ice hockey)|Father David Bauer]], the legendary coach and St. Michael's teacher, had decided to withdraw the private school from participation following their Memorial Cup win in 1961.\n\nIn response, the OHA managed to convince [[Sam Pollock]]'s [[Montreal Junior Canadiens]] to join. The league that year consisted of the [[Guelph Royals (ice hockey)|Guelph Royals]], Hamilton Red Wings, [[St. Catharines Black Hawks]], [[Peterborough Petes|Peterborough T.P.T.]], Montreal Junior Canadiens and the [[Niagara Falls Flyers]].\n\nThe rival league was a failure on and off the ice, and it effectively became a second division. Although it was independent from the OHA, the champions of the OHA and the Metro Junior A would play each other in the playoffs each year on the road to the Memorial Cup.\n\nFor its second season, the Metro League underwent sweeping changes, with the Whitby Mohawks renamed the [[Whitby Dunlops]], the Unionville Seaforths becoming [[Toronto Knob Hill Farms]], and the Majors became the [[Toronto Neil McNeil Maroons]]. The new sixth team in the league would be the reborn [[Oshawa Generals]].\n\n====Re-unified league (1963\u201367)====\nHowever, after two seasons of the Metro Junior A League, it failed, and a new unified Junior A league emerged. Unfortunately, this meant the end of Neil McNeil, Brampton, Knob Hill and Unionville. The Marlboros and the reborn Oshawa Generals re-joined the OHA in 1964. The Guelph Royals also became the [[Kitchener Rangers]].\n\n====Beginning of NHL Amateur Draft====\nThe first [[NHL Entry Draft|NHL Amateur Draft]] was held in 1963 for any junior player was not already sponsored by an NHL team. When the NHL expanded in 1969, the rules of the draft were changed to allow any amateur player under the age of 20 to be chosen. The OHA ceased being a direct farm system and began to compete with other junior leagues to graduate players. [[R\u00e9jean Houle]] became the first OHA player to be drafted first overall in 1969 by the [[Montreal Canadiens]]. The Canadiens took advantage of a grandfather clause that gave them first right to [[francophone]] players. In 1970 that clause was revoked, and [[Gilbert Perreault]] was drafted first overall by the [[Buffalo Sabres]]. Both R\u00e9jean Houle and Gilbert Perreault played in the OHA with the [[Montreal Junior Canadiens]].\n\n====End of NHL sponsorship====\nIn 1965 the London Nationals (later [[London Knights|Knights]]) were added to the OHA as the last NHL-sponsored team. By 1967, direct NHL sponsorship of teams and individual players had ended. Prior to this time, all of the [[Original Six]] NHL teams had involvement in OHA teams:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!NHL Team\n!OHA Farm Team\n|-\n|[[Boston Bruins]]\n|[[Barrie Flyers]] (1945\u20131960) <br />[[Niagara Falls Flyers]] (1960\u20131967) <br />[[Oshawa Generals]] (1962\u201367)\n|-\n|[[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]]\n|[[Galt Black Hawks]] (1949\u20131955) <br />[[St. Catharines Black Hawks]] (1962\u20131967)\n|-\n|[[Detroit Red Wings]]\n|[[Galt Red Wings]] (1944\u201347)<br />[[Oshawa Generals]] (1950\u20131953) <br />[[Hamilton Red Wings]] (1960\u20131967)\n|-\n|[[New York Rangers]]\n|[[Guelph Biltmore Mad Hatters]] (1947\u20131960)<br />[[Guelph Royals (ice hockey)|Guelph Royals]] (1960\u20131963)<br />[[Kitchener Rangers]] (1963\u20131967)\n|-\n|[[Montreal Canadiens]]\n|[[Peterborough Petes]] (1956\u20131967)<br /> [[Montreal Junior Canadiens]] (1961\u20131967)  \n|-\n|[[Toronto Maple Leafs]]\n|[[Toronto Marlboros]] (1927\u20131967)<br />[[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] (19??-1961)<br />[[London Knights|London Nationals]] (1965\u20131967)\n|}\n\nIn 1967 the [[Ottawa 67's]] were added to the league, named after Canada's [[Canadian Centennial|centennial]] [[anniversary]]. The OHA existed with ten teams until 1972, upon the creation of a new level of junior hockey, and the folding of the [[Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League]].\n\n====Feud between the OHA and the QMJHL====\nThe competitiveness between the Ontario Hockey Association and the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League had grown since 1969 when the QMJHL was born. It was further escalated by the incidents of the 1971 [[George Richardson Memorial Trophy|Richardson Cup]], and the lawsuit over the [[Montreal Junior Canadiens]].\n\n=====1971 Richardson Cup=====\nThe Eastern Canadian championship of 1971 was a controversial series, and would be the last time teams played for the Richardson Cup. It would be replaced the following season in 1972, with the [[Memorial Cup]] tournament, as part of reshaping junior hockey. The 1971 series featured future NHL stars [[Guy Lafleur]] and [[Marcel Dionne]], but never lived up to the potential on ice brilliance that could have been. Disputes off the ice and erupting violence abrupted the series before it was finished.\n\nThe [[St. Catharines Black Hawks]] and [[Quebec Remparts]] series was intense on many levels. Besides the strong rivalry between [[English Canadian|Anglophone]] and [[Francophone]] hockey teams, there was personal rift between Marcel Dionne and the Remparts coach Maurice Filion over Dionne playing in the OHA, which was seen as a higher-calibre level of competition. This rivalry was further fueled by the desire of Francophone nationalists to have a Canadian champion from a Quebec team in a Quebec-based league.\n\nThe Remparts won the first game 4\u20132 played in St. Catharines and televised by closed circuit to over 8,000 spectators in Quebec arenas. Despite the win, Filion complained about the OHA referee's bias against his players, calling it anti-Francophone. The Black Hawks won game two by a score of 8\u20133, to tie the series at 1 game each.\n\nGame three was played in the [[Colis\u00e9e de Qu\u00e9bec]] to an overflow crowd, seeing the Remparts win 3\u20131. There were a total of 102 penalty minutes called, 77 of those were against the Black Hawks. Brian MacKenize of St. Catharines would be suspended for one game after confronting a linesman. After this game, the OHA lodged a complaint to the CAHA about QMHL appointed referees.\n\nThe next game of the series was uglier than the last game. Another overflow crowd saw the Remparts win game 4 by a score of 6\u20131. As the game wore on, more and more fights broke out on the ice, involving players leaving the penalty box to join the fray. The St. Catharines players were escorted off the ice by police amidst the hurling of debris from Quebec fans. After the game an angry mob surrounded the St. Catharines team bus on its way to the motel, and was given a police escort to safety. The mob circled the motel until the early hours of the morning.\n\nAfter disputes between the teams and leagues, game five was played on neutral ice at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in Toronto, which the Black Hawks won 6\u20133 to narrow the series 3 games to 2 for Quebec. That was the last game played.\n\nThe parents of the St. Catharines players refused to send their children back to Quebec City for fear of the violence that occurred after game four. The Remparts refused to play anywhere else but their home rink, including any neutral ice in the province of Quebec. The problem was further confounded with threats surfacing from the [[Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec|FLQ (Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec)]] against St. Catharines players.\n\nCAHA president Dawson declared the series to be over when no further compromise could be reached, and he had received official notice from St. Catharines that the team would not return to the Colis\u00e9e. As a result, the Remparts went on to compete for the [[Memorial Cup]] by default, which they won, defeating the Edmonton Oil Kings.\n\n=====Departure of the Montreal Junior Canadiens=====\nThe QMJHL threatened a lawsuit against the OHA to force the Junior Canadiens to return to the Quebec-based league, from which it departed in 1961 in favour of competing in the higher calibre OHA. The QMJHL not only wanted a team in the province's biggest city, but also felt the Junior Canadiens had violated the territorial right of the QMJHL. Ironically, the QMJHL had previously granted franchise rights to the [[Cornwall Royals]] of the [[Central Junior A Hockey League]] in 1969, when the OHA had denied the Royals bid.\n\nTo solve the problem, the OHA granted the Junior Canadiens franchise a \"one-year suspension\" of operations, while team ownership transferred the team and players into the QMJHL, renaming themselves the [[Montreal Bleu Blanc Rouge]] in the process.\n\nThe OHA then \"re-established\" the suspended franchise after a one-year hiatus, under new ownership and with new players, calling the team the Kingston Canadians. The new Kingston team was essentially an expansion franchise, that had only common name to share with the departed team, but has some claim to the legacy of the Junior Canadiens.\n\n===OHA Major Junior 'A' (1970\u20131974)===\nFor the 1970\u201371 season, Junior A hockey split again into Tier I and Tier II. The only Tier I league in the province became known as the OHA Major Jr. A. Its winner represented Ontario in a round-robin Memorial Cup with a team from the [[Western Hockey League]] and another team from the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]]. The Tier II teams would compete for the newly created [[Royal Bank Cup|Manitoba Centennial Trophy]].\n\nCommunities such as [[Sudbury Wolves|Sudbury]] (transfer from Niagara Falls) and [[Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds|Sault Ste. Marie]] that had been part of the [[Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League]] (NOJHL) prior to the Tier I/Tier II split, joined the Major Jr. A ranks in 1972 to rejoin the Memorial Cup hunt. The 1970s also saw the Montreal Junior Canadiens moving back into the QJHL's successor, the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]]. The [[Kingston Canadians]] joined the OHL in their place as the Junior Canadiens' successors, albeit with different ownership and players. The league also witnessed the rebirth of the [[Windsor Spitfires]] during this time period.\n\n===OHA timeline of teams===\n*'''[[1937\u201338 OHA season|1937]]''' - The OHA (Ontario Hockey Association) consists of seven teams. Six are based in [[Toronto]] and one from [[Oshawa, Ontario|Oshawa]].

The new league opened up administration offices and appointed its own commissioner.\n\nThe OMJHL instituted many rules changes to distinguish itself from Tier II (Minor Jr. A), including allowing one overage player on the roster. The Central Scouting Bureau was started in 1975 to provide teams with more information about players available in the upcoming draft. The same year the league divided into a two division format. Then in 1977, the OMHJL held its first All-Star game in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]].\n\n===OMJHL timeline of teams===\n*'''[[1974\u201375 OMJHL season|1974]]''' - The Ontario Hockey Association's Junior A Tier I league becomes the Ontario Major Junior Hockey League. The Hamilton Red Wings become the [[Hamilton Fincups]].\n*'''[[1975\u201376 OMJHL season|1975]]''' - The [[Windsor Spitfires]] are granted a franchise.\n*'''[[1976\u201377 OMJHL season|1976]]''' - The St. Catharines Black Hawks become the [[Niagara Falls Flyers]].

The OMJHL separated itself from the [[Ontario Hockey Association]], becoming the '''Ontario Hockey League.'''\n\nAn agreement was struck between the two sides where the OHL would pay the OHA $30,000 annually in affiliation fees and the right to compete for the Memorial Cup, and the OHL teams would have complete control over finances and ticket sales. The OHA would continue to operate hockey from Junior A Tier II, and below. [[David Branch]] has been the only Commissioner of the OHL from this time. Since 1980, the league has grown rapidly into a high-profile marketable product, with many games broadcast on television and radio.\n\nIn the 1980s, the league added the [[Guelph Platers]] and [[Belleville Bulls]], and welcomed the [[Cornwall Royals]] from the QMJHL. [[North Bay Centennials|North Bay]] took in the second version of the [[Niagara Falls Flyers]]. The former Fincups franchise was recycled through Brantford as the [[Brantford Alexanders]] and back to [[Hamilton Steelhawks (junior)|Hamilton]], and by the end of the decade it was in [[Niagara Falls Thunder|Niagara Falls]]. The end of the decade saw the end of another storied team, the [[Toronto Marlboros]], as they relocated to become the [[Hamilton Dukes]]. It also saw the end of the Kingston Canadians name as they were renamed the [[Kingston Raiders|Raiders]], and renamed again to the [[Kingston Frontenacs|Frontenacs]] the following year. During the 1980s, the OHL experimented with [[Cooperalls]] as standardized league equipment, but reverted to hockey shorts.\n\nThe 1990s saw the league expand into the USA. The first franchise the expansion [[Detroit Compuware Ambassadors]] (later the [[Detroit Junior Red Wings]], [[Detroit Whalers]] and [[Plymouth Whalers]]) and the secondly the [[Erie Otters]], who relocated from Niagara Falls. The Otters could trace their heritage back to the Hamilton Tiger Cubs of 1953. [[Newmarket Royals|Newmarket]] also briefly had the Royals before moving on to become the [[Sarnia Sting]]. The Dukes became the [[Guelph Storm]]; filling the void left when the Platers relocated to [[Owen Sound Platers|Owen Sound]]. [[Barrie Colts|Barrie]] rejoined the league in 1995 with the Colts and the Toronto St. Michael's Majors also rejoined the league in 1997 after a 34-year absence. The league continued to expand with two new teams in 1998; Don Cherry's [[Mississauga IceDogs]] and the [[Brampton Battalion]]. In 2000 The Owen Sound Platers were renamed to the [[Owen Sound Attack|Attack]] after being bought by local interests. In 2002, the Centennials moved to Saginaw, Michigan to become the [[Saginaw Spirit]].\n\nThere are currently 20 teams in the OHL; 17 are based in Ontario, 2 teams from Michigan and 1 team from Pennsylvania.\n\n===OHL timeline of teams===\n*'''[[1980\u201381 OHL season|1980]]''' - The Ontario Major Junior Hockey League renames itself the Ontario Hockey League, further separating from the Ontario Hockey Association.\n*'''[[1981\u201382 OHL season|1981]]''' - The [[Cornwall Royals]] transfer to the OHL from the QMJHL.

The game's winner was awarded the OHL Chrysler Cup. This format continued through 1985.\n\nThe OHL / QMJHL All-Star Challenge Series was held from 1986 to 1991. The game's winner was awarded the Chrysler Challenge Cup. Chrysler Canada was the corporate sponsor from 1977 to 1991.\n\nThe [[Canadian Hockey League]] created the CHL All-Star Challenge in 1992. For four seasons from 1992 to 1995, it incorporated the [[Western Hockey League]], the Ontario Hockey League and the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] into one showcase event. The host league in this case would challenge a combined team from the other two leagues. In 1996 this was replaced with the [[CHL Top Prospects Game]]. There was no OHL All-Star game held in 1996.\n\nThe OHL All-Star Game was revived in 1997. It was played for 4 consecutive seasons until 2000. Officially it was called the '''OHL All-Star Classic.''' The games during this period had different corporate sponsors.\n\nIn 2001, the three CHL leagues would play a round-robin style All-Star game named the CHL All-Star Series, the winning league being awarded the Hershey Cup. Each league made two Conference All-Star teams. One would play at home versus a Conference All-Star team from another league, and the other conference would visit another league's team. This format was played for the 2001, 2002 & 2003 seasons.\n\nThe event was rebranded as the OHL All-Star Classic from the 2003\u201304 season onward. The game was previously sponsored by [[Direct Energy]], the most recent corporate sponsor is [[Bell Canada]]. The 2007 All Star game was played in [[Saginaw, Michigan]], [[United States]], the first time the game has been hosted outside of Canada.\n\nThe OHL discontinued the All-star game as of the 2010\u201311 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/juniorhockey/news?slug=ss-ohlallstar092110|title=Yahoo Canada Sports - Sports News, Scores, Rumours, Fantasy Games, and more|author=|date=|website=Yahoo Sports|accessdate=13 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===List of All-Star Game hosts===\n{| cellpadding=\"20\"\n|-----\n| valign=\"top\" |\n:'''OHL Chrysler Cup'''\n*''1977'' - Sudbury Wolves\n*''1978'' - Windsor Spitfires\n*''1979'' - S.S.

In 1974, the \"Major Junior A\" division of the OHA  became the '''Ontario Major Junior Hockey League''' (OMJHL) and began to operate independently of the OHA. Finally in 1980, the OMJHL became the '''Ontario Hockey League'''.\n\n==Ontario Hockey Association history==\nHockey started as a challenge series in the winter of 1889 when a team from [[Ottawa]] challenged teams from [[Lindsay, Ontario|Lindsay]] and [[Toronto]]. A year later the Ontario Hockey Association was formed on November 27, 1890 in Toronto at the [[Queen's Hotel, Toronto|Queen's Hotel]].\n\n===Junior hockey (1892\u20131933)===\nThe first junior teams started play in 1892, without enforced age limits; the first champions Kingston Limestones over Galt.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=Junior Ontario Championship |date=March 6, 1893 |page=8}}</ref> In 1896, the OHA re-organized into three divisions, senior, intermediate and junior. Junior hockey now became age-limited to players 20 years of age or younger by January 1 of the season being played. Out of its modest beginnings at the turn of the century, junior hockey quickly grew into an organized and entertaining brand of hockey. The end of [[World War I]] marked the beginning of the [[Memorial Cup]], the symbol of junior hockey supremacy in [[Canada]]. Teams from all across the [[province]] participated in provincial playoffs in the hope of winning the [[George Richardson Memorial Trophy]] and representing Eastern Canada in the Memorial Cup finals. As each year passed, the number of communities participating in junior hockey grew and the calibre of play increased.\n\n===OHA Junior 'A' (1933\u20131972)===\nFor the 1933\u201334 season, junior hockey was split into 'A' and 'B' divisions. Two new championship trophies were created at the same time. The 'A' level teams competing for the [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]] as OHA champions and the Memorial Cup as national champions. The 'B' level teams competed for the [[Sutherland Cup]], which is still Ontario's Junior B championship trophy.\n\nThe 1930s gave birth to noted teams such as the [[Oshawa Generals]], [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors|St. Michael's Majors]] and the [[Toronto Marlboros]]. Other notable teams of that era were the [[Toronto Young Rangers]], [[Toronto Native Sons]], and the [[Stratford Midgets]].\n\nThe 1940s welcomed new communities to the limelight such as the [[Barrie Flyers]], [[Guelph Biltmore Mad Hatters]], [[Stratford Kroehlers]] and the [[St. Catharines Teepees]]. The first version of the [[Windsor Spitfires]] also appeared in the 1940s only to fade away in the early 1950s.\n\nThe OHA awarded its first individual player trophies in 1945. The [[Red Tilson Trophy]] was awarded to the player voted \"Most Outstanding\" in the league. The [[Eddie Powers Memorial Trophy]] was awarded to the league's top scorer.\n\nThe 1950s saw other cities join in. The [[Kitchener Greenshirts]] entered the league only to move on to become the [[Peterborough Petes]]. Hamilton also joined as the [[Hamilton Tiger Cubs|Tiger Cubs]] (later the [[Hamilton Red Wings|Red Wings]]). The 1950s also saw inter-league play with [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League|Quebec-based teams]].\n\n====A divided league (1961\u201363)====\n[[Stafford Smythe]], owner of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], started the [[Metro Junior A League]] in an attempt to rival the OHA. The [[Toronto Marlboros]], who were owned by the Leafs, were withdrawn from the OHA and placed in a league with promoted Junior B teams including the [[Whitby Mohawks]], the [[Brampton Warriors|Brampton 7 Ups]], and the [[Unionville Seaforths]]. The other member of the league was the former [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors|St. Michael's Majors]] franchise, who would be later transferred to [[Toronto Neil McNeil Maroons|Neil McNeil High School]] in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Ontario]]. [[David Bauer (ice hockey)|Father David Bauer]], the legendary coach and St. Michael's teacher, had decided to withdraw the private school from participation following their Memorial Cup win in 1961.\n\nIn response, the OHA managed to convince [[Sam Pollock]]'s [[Montreal Junior Canadiens]] to join. The league that year consisted of the [[Guelph Royals (ice hockey)|Guelph Royals]], Hamilton Red Wings, [[St. Catharines Black Hawks]], [[Peterborough Petes|Peterborough T.P.T.]], Montreal Junior Canadiens and the [[Niagara Falls Flyers]].\n\nThe rival league was a failure on and off the ice, and it effectively became a second division. Although it was independent from the OHA, the champions of the OHA and the Metro Junior A would play each other in the playoffs each year on the road to the Memorial Cup.\n\nFor its second season, the Metro League underwent sweeping changes, with the Whitby Mohawks renamed the [[Whitby Dunlops]], the Unionville Seaforths becoming [[Toronto Knob Hill Farms]], and the Majors became the [[Toronto Neil McNeil Maroons]]. The new sixth team in the league would be the reborn [[Oshawa Generals]].\n\n====Re-unified league (1963\u201367)====\nHowever, after two seasons of the Metro Junior A League, it failed, and a new unified Junior A league emerged. Unfortunately, this meant the end of Neil McNeil, Brampton, Knob Hill and Unionville. The Marlboros and the reborn Oshawa Generals re-joined the OHA in 1964. The Guelph Royals also became the [[Kitchener Rangers]].\n\n====Beginning of NHL Amateur Draft====\nThe first [[NHL Entry Draft|NHL Amateur Draft]] was held in 1963 for any junior player was not already sponsored by an NHL team. When the NHL expanded in 1969, the rules of the draft were changed to allow any amateur player under the age of 20 to be chosen. The OHA ceased being a direct farm system and began to compete with other junior leagues to graduate players. [[R\u00e9jean Houle]] became the first OHA player to be drafted first overall in 1969 by the [[Montreal Canadiens]]. The Canadiens took advantage of a grandfather clause that gave them first right to [[francophone]] players. In 1970 that clause was revoked, and [[Gilbert Perreault]] was drafted first overall by the [[Buffalo Sabres]]. Both R\u00e9jean Houle and Gilbert Perreault played in the OHA with the [[Montreal Junior Canadiens]].\n\n====End of NHL sponsorship====\nIn 1965 the London Nationals (later [[London Knights|Knights]]) were added to the OHA as the last NHL-sponsored team. By 1967, direct NHL sponsorship of teams and individual players had ended. Prior to this time, all of the [[Original Six]] NHL teams had involvement in OHA teams:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!NHL Team\n!OHA Farm Team\n|-\n|[[Boston Bruins]]\n|[[Barrie Flyers]] (1945\u20131960) <br />[[Niagara Falls Flyers]] (1960\u20131967) <br />[[Oshawa Generals]] (1962\u201367)\n|-\n|[[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]]\n|[[Galt Black Hawks]] (1949\u20131955) <br />[[St. Catharines Black Hawks]] (1962\u20131967)\n|-\n|[[Detroit Red Wings]]\n|[[Galt Red Wings]] (1944\u201347)<br />[[Oshawa Generals]] (1950\u20131953) <br />[[Hamilton Red Wings]] (1960\u20131967)\n|-\n|[[New York Rangers]]\n|[[Guelph Biltmore Mad Hatters]] (1947\u20131960)<br />[[Guelph Royals (ice hockey)|Guelph Royals]] (1960\u20131963)<br />[[Kitchener Rangers]] (1963\u20131967)\n|-\n|[[Montreal Canadiens]]\n|[[Peterborough Petes]] (1956\u20131967)<br /> [[Montreal Junior Canadiens]] (1961\u20131967)  \n|-\n|[[Toronto Maple Leafs]]\n|[[Toronto Marlboros]] (1927\u20131967)<br />[[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] (19??-1961)<br />[[London Knights|London Nationals]] (1965\u20131967)\n|}\n\nIn 1967 the [[Ottawa 67's]] were added to the league, named after Canada's [[Canadian Centennial|centennial]] [[anniversary]]. The OHA existed with ten teams until 1972, upon the creation of a new level of junior hockey, and the folding of the [[Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League]].\n\n====Feud between the OHA and the QMJHL====\nThe competitiveness between the Ontario Hockey Association and the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League had grown since 1969 when the QMJHL was born. It was further escalated by the incidents of the 1971 [[George Richardson Memorial Trophy|Richardson Cup]], and the lawsuit over the [[Montreal Junior Canadiens]].\n\n=====1971 Richardson Cup=====\nThe Eastern Canadian championship of 1971 was a controversial series, and would be the last time teams played for the Richardson Cup. It would be replaced the following season in 1972, with the [[Memorial Cup]] tournament, as part of reshaping junior hockey. The 1971 series featured future NHL stars [[Guy Lafleur]] and [[Marcel Dionne]], but never lived up to the potential on ice brilliance that could have been. Disputes off the ice and erupting violence abrupted the series before it was finished.\n\nThe [[St. Catharines Black Hawks]] and [[Quebec Remparts]] series was intense on many levels. Besides the strong rivalry between [[English Canadian|Anglophone]] and [[Francophone]] hockey teams, there was personal rift between Marcel Dionne and the Remparts coach Maurice Filion over Dionne playing in the OHA, which was seen as a higher-calibre level of competition. This rivalry was further fueled by the desire of Francophone nationalists to have a Canadian champion from a Quebec team in a Quebec-based league.\n\nThe Remparts won the first game 4\u20132 played in St. Catharines and televised by closed circuit to over 8,000 spectators in Quebec arenas. Despite the win, Filion complained about the OHA referee's bias against his players, calling it anti-Francophone. The Black Hawks won game two by a score of 8\u20133, to tie the series at 1 game each.\n\nGame three was played in the [[Colis\u00e9e de Qu\u00e9bec]] to an overflow crowd, seeing the Remparts win 3\u20131. There were a total of 102 penalty minutes called, 77 of those were against the Black Hawks. Brian MacKenize of St. Catharines would be suspended for one game after confronting a linesman. After this game, the OHA lodged a complaint to the CAHA about QMHL appointed referees.\n\nThe next game of the series was uglier than the last game. Another overflow crowd saw the Remparts win game 4 by a score of 6\u20131. As the game wore on, more and more fights broke out on the ice, involving players leaving the penalty box to join the fray. The St. Catharines players were escorted off the ice by police amidst the hurling of debris from Quebec fans. After the game an angry mob surrounded the St. Catharines team bus on its way to the motel, and was given a police escort to safety. The mob circled the motel until the early hours of the morning.\n\nAfter disputes between the teams and leagues, game five was played on neutral ice at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in Toronto, which the Black Hawks won 6\u20133 to narrow the series 3 games to 2 for Quebec. That was the last game played.\n\nThe parents of the St. Catharines players refused to send their children back to Quebec City for fear of the violence that occurred after game four. The Remparts refused to play anywhere else but their home rink, including any neutral ice in the province of Quebec. The problem was further confounded with threats surfacing from the [[Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec|FLQ (Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec)]] against St. Catharines players.\n\nCAHA president Dawson declared the series to be over when no further compromise could be reached, and he had received official notice from St. Catharines that the team would not return to the Colis\u00e9e. As a result, the Remparts went on to compete for the [[Memorial Cup]] by default, which they won, defeating the Edmonton Oil Kings.\n\n=====Departure of the Montreal Junior Canadiens=====\nThe QMJHL threatened a lawsuit against the OHA to force the Junior Canadiens to return to the Quebec-based league, from which it departed in 1961 in favour of competing in the higher calibre OHA. The QMJHL not only wanted a team in the province's biggest city, but also felt the Junior Canadiens had violated the territorial right of the QMJHL. Ironically, the QMJHL had previously granted franchise rights to the [[Cornwall Royals]] of the [[Central Junior A Hockey League]] in 1969, when the OHA had denied the Royals bid.\n\nTo solve the problem, the OHA granted the Junior Canadiens franchise a \"one-year suspension\" of operations, while team ownership transferred the team and players into the QMJHL, renaming themselves the [[Montreal Bleu Blanc Rouge]] in the process.\n\nThe OHA then \"re-established\" the suspended franchise after a one-year hiatus, under new ownership and with new players, calling the team the Kingston Canadians. The new Kingston team was essentially an expansion franchise, that had only common name to share with the departed team, but has some claim to the legacy of the Junior Canadiens.\n\n===OHA Major Junior 'A' (1970\u20131974)===\nFor the 1970\u201371 season, Junior A hockey split again into Tier I and Tier II. The only Tier I league in the province became known as the OHA Major Jr. A. Its winner represented Ontario in a round-robin Memorial Cup with a team from the [[Western Hockey League]] and another team from the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]]. The Tier II teams would compete for the newly created [[Royal Bank Cup|Manitoba Centennial Trophy]].\n\nCommunities such as [[Sudbury Wolves|Sudbury]] (transfer from Niagara Falls) and [[Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds|Sault Ste. Marie]] that had been part of the [[Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League]] (NOJHL) prior to the Tier I/Tier II split, joined the Major Jr. A ranks in 1972 to rejoin the Memorial Cup hunt. The 1970s also saw the Montreal Junior Canadiens moving back into the QJHL's successor, the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]]. The [[Kingston Canadians]] joined the OHL in their place as the Junior Canadiens' successors, albeit with different ownership and players. The league also witnessed the rebirth of the [[Windsor Spitfires]] during this time period.\n\n===OHA timeline of teams===\n*'''[[1937\u201338 OHA season|1937]]''' - The OHA (Ontario Hockey Association) consists of seven teams.

The new league opened up administration offices and appointed its own commissioner.\n\nThe OMJHL instituted many rules changes to distinguish itself from Tier II (Minor Jr. A), including allowing one overage player on the roster. The Central Scouting Bureau was started in 1975 to provide teams with more information about players available in the upcoming draft. The same year the league divided into a two division format. Then in 1977, the OMHJL held its first All-Star game in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]].\n\n===OMJHL timeline of teams===\n*'''[[1974\u201375 OMJHL season|1974]]''' - The Ontario Hockey Association's Junior A Tier I league becomes the Ontario Major Junior Hockey League. The Hamilton Red Wings become the [[Hamilton Fincups]].\n*'''[[1975\u201376 OMJHL season|1975]]''' - The [[Windsor Spitfires]] are granted a franchise.\n*'''[[1976\u201377 OMJHL season|1976]]''' - The St. Catharines Black Hawks become the [[Niagara Falls Flyers]].

The OMJHL separated itself from the [[Ontario Hockey Association]], becoming the '''Ontario Hockey League.'''\n\nAn agreement was struck between the two sides where the OHL would pay the OHA $30,000 annually in affiliation fees and the right to compete for the Memorial Cup, and the OHL teams would have complete control over finances and ticket sales. The OHA would continue to operate hockey from Junior A Tier II, and below. [[David Branch]] has been the only Commissioner of the OHL from this time. Since 1980, the league has grown rapidly into a high-profile marketable product, with many games broadcast on television and radio.\n\nIn the 1980s, the league added the [[Guelph Platers]] and [[Belleville Bulls]], and welcomed the [[Cornwall Royals]] from the QMJHL. [[North Bay Centennials|North Bay]] took in the second version of the [[Niagara Falls Flyers]]. The former Fincups franchise was recycled through Brantford as the [[Brantford Alexanders]] and back to [[Hamilton Steelhawks (junior)|Hamilton]], and by the end of the decade it was in [[Niagara Falls Thunder|Niagara Falls]]. The end of the decade saw the end of another storied team, the [[Toronto Marlboros]], as they relocated to become the [[Hamilton Dukes]]. It also saw the end of the Kingston Canadians name as they were renamed the [[Kingston Raiders|Raiders]], and renamed again to the [[Kingston Frontenacs|Frontenacs]] the following year. During the 1980s, the OHL experimented with [[Cooperalls]] as standardized league equipment, but reverted to hockey shorts.\n\nThe 1990s saw the league expand into the USA. The first franchise the expansion [[Detroit Compuware Ambassadors]] (later the [[Detroit Junior Red Wings]], [[Detroit Whalers]] and [[Plymouth Whalers]]) and the secondly the [[Erie Otters]], who relocated from Niagara Falls. The Otters could trace their heritage back to the Hamilton Tiger Cubs of 1953. [[Newmarket Royals|Newmarket]] also briefly had the Royals before moving on to become the [[Sarnia Sting]]. The Dukes became the [[Guelph Storm]]; filling the void left when the Platers relocated to [[Owen Sound Platers|Owen Sound]]. [[Barrie Colts|Barrie]] rejoined the league in 1995 with the Colts and the Toronto St. Michael's Majors also rejoined the league in 1997 after a 34-year absence. The league continued to expand with two new teams in 1998; Don Cherry's [[Mississauga IceDogs]] and the [[Brampton Battalion]]. In 2000 The Owen Sound Platers were renamed to the [[Owen Sound Attack|Attack]] after being bought by local interests. In 2002, the Centennials moved to Saginaw, Michigan to become the [[Saginaw Spirit]].\n\nThere are currently 20 teams in the OHL; 17 are based in Ontario, 2 teams from Michigan and 1 team from Pennsylvania.\n\n===OHL timeline of teams===\n*'''[[1980\u201381 OHL season|1980]]''' - The Ontario Major Junior Hockey League renames itself the Ontario Hockey League, further separating from the Ontario Hockey Association.\n*'''[[1981\u201382 OHL season|1981]]''' - The [[Cornwall Royals]] transfer to the OHL from the QMJHL.

The game's winner was awarded the OHL Chrysler Cup. This format continued through 1985.\n\nThe OHL / QMJHL All-Star Challenge Series was held from 1986 to 1991. The game's winner was awarded the Chrysler Challenge Cup. Chrysler Canada was the corporate sponsor from 1977 to 1991.\n\nThe [[Canadian Hockey League]] created the CHL All-Star Challenge in 1992. For four seasons from 1992 to 1995, it incorporated the [[Western Hockey League]], the Ontario Hockey League and the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] into one showcase event. The host league in this case would challenge a combined team from the other two leagues. In 1996 this was replaced with the [[CHL Top Prospects Game]]. There was no OHL All-Star game held in 1996.\n\nThe OHL All-Star Game was revived in 1997. It was played for 4 consecutive seasons until 2000. Officially it was called the '''OHL All-Star Classic.''' The games during this period had different corporate sponsors.\n\nIn 2001, the three CHL leagues would play a round-robin style All-Star game named the CHL All-Star Series, the winning league being awarded the Hershey Cup. Each league made two Conference All-Star teams. One would play at home versus a Conference All-Star team from another league, and the other conference would visit another league's team. This format was played for the 2001, 2002 & 2003 seasons.\n\nThe event was rebranded as the OHL All-Star Classic from the 2003\u201304 season onward. The game was previously sponsored by [[Direct Energy]], the most recent corporate sponsor is [[Bell Canada]]. The 2007 All Star game was played in [[Saginaw, Michigan]], [[United States]], the first time the game has been hosted outside of Canada.\n\nThe OHL discontinued the All-star game as of the 2010-11 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/juniorhockey/news?slug=ss-ohlallstar092110|title=Yahoo Canada Sports - Sports News, Scores, Rumours, Fantasy Games, and more|author=|date=|website=Yahoo Sports|accessdate=13 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===List of All-Star Game hosts===\n{| cellpadding=\"20\"\n|-----\n| valign=\"top\" |\n:'''OHL Chrysler Cup'''\n*''1977'' - Sudbury Wolves\n*''1978'' - Windsor Spitfires\n*''1979'' - S.S.

His family settled from [[Drobnjaci]], and his mother was born in [[Ozrini\u0107i]], [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]] (in present-day [[Montenegro]].) His family had a low infant survival rate, thus he was named Vuk (\"wolf\") so that witches and evil spirits would not hurt him (the name was traditionally given to strengthen the bearer).\n\n===Education===\n[[File:\u0412\u0443\u043a \u0421\u0442\u0435\u0444\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u045f\u0438\u045b.1816.jpg|thumb|Oil painting by [[Pavel \u0110urkovi\u0107]], dating to 1816 (age 29)]]\nKarad\u017ei\u0107 was fortunate to be a relative of Jevta Savi\u0107 \u010cotri\u0107, the only literate person in the area at the time, who taught him how to read and write. Karad\u017ei\u0107 continued his education in the [[Trono\u0161a Monastery]] in Loznica. As a boy he learned [[calligraphy]] there, using a reed instead of a pen and a solution of gunpowder for ink. In lieu of proper writing paper he was lucky if he could get cartridge wrappings. Throughout the whole region, regular schooling was not widespread at that time and his father at first did not allow him to go to Austria. Since most of the time while in the monastery Karad\u017ei\u0107 was forced to pasture the livestock instead of studying, his father brought him back home. Meanwhile, the [[First Serbian Uprising]] seeking to overthrow the Ottomans began in 1804.

Later on, he met highly respected scholar [[Dositej Obradovi\u0107]] in [[Belgrade]], which was now in the hands of the [[Revolutionary Serbia]], in order to ask Obradovi\u0107 to support his studies. Unfortunately, Obradovi\u0107 dismissed him. Disappointed, Karad\u017ei\u0107 left for [[Jadar (Serbia)|Jadar]] and began working as a scribe for [[Jakov Nenadovi\u0107]]. After the founding of the [[Belgrade Higher School]], Karad\u017ei\u0107 became one of its first students.\n\n===Later life and death===\nSoon afterwards, he grew ill and left for medical treatment in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] and [[Novi Sad]], but was unable to receive treatment for his leg. It was rumored that Karad\u017ei\u0107 deliberately refused to undergo amputation, instead deciding to make do with a [[prosthetic]] wooden [[pegleg]], of which there were several sarcastic references in some of his works.{{clarify|reason=If his leg was not amputated, how could he have a prosthetic one?|date=November 2015}} Karad\u017ei\u0107 returned to Serbia by 1810, and as unfit for military service, he served as the secretary for commanders [[\u0110or\u0111e \u0106ur\u010dija|\u0106ur\u010dija]] and [[Hajduk-Veljko]]. His experiences would later give rise to two books. With the Ottoman defeat of the Serbian rebels in 1813, he left for [[Vienna]] and later met [[Jernej Kopitar]], an experienced linguist with a strong interest in secular [[slavistics]]. Kopitar's influence helped Karad\u017ei\u0107 with his struggle in reforming the [[Serbian language]] and its orthography.

[[Goethe]] characterized some of them as \"excellent and worthy of comparison with Solomon's ''Song of Songs''.\"\n\nIn 1824, he sent a copy of his folksong collection to [[Jacob Grimm]], who was enthralled particularly by [[The Building of Skadar]] which Karad\u017ei\u0107 recorded from singing of [[Old Rashko]].

This, in turn, would prove detrimental to Prince Milo\u0161's politics toward the Ottoman Empire, with whom he had recently forged an uneasy peace. In Montenegro, however, Njego\u0161's printing press operated without the archaic letter known as the \"[[hard sign]]\". Prince Milo\u0161 was to resent Njego\u0161's abandonment of the hard sign, over which, at that time, furious intellectual battles were being waged, with ecclesiastical hierarchy involved as well. Karad\u017ei\u0107's works, however, did receive high praise and recognition elsewhere, especially in [[Russian Empire]]. In addition to this, Karad\u017ei\u0107 was granted a full pension from the [[Emperor of All Russia]] in [[1826]].\n\nHe died in Vienna, and was survived by his daughter [[Mina Karad\u017ei\u0107]], who was a painter and writer, and by his son Dimitrije Karad\u017ei\u0107, a military officer.

Karad\u017ei\u0107's reforms of the Serbian literary language modernised it and distanced it from Serbian and Russian [[Church Slavonic]], instead bringing it closer to common folk speech, specifically, to the dialect of Eastern [[Herzegovina]] which he spoke. Karad\u017ei\u0107 was, together with [[\u0110uro Dani\u010di\u0107]], the main Serbian signatory to the [[Vienna Literary Agreement]] of 1850 which, encouraged by [[Austria]]n authorities, laid the foundation for the Serbian language. Karad\u017ei\u0107 also translated the [[New Testament]] into Serbian, which was published in 1847. The Vukovian effort of language standardization lasted the remainder of the century. Before then the Serbs had achieved a fully independent state (1878), and a flourishing national culture based in Belgrade and Novi Sad. Despite the Vienna agreement, the Serbs had by this time developed an [[Ekavian accent|Ekavian pronunciation]], which was the native speech of their two cultural capitals as well as the great majority of the Serbian population.\n\n===Literature===\nIn addition to his linguistic reforms, Karad\u017ei\u0107 also contributed to folk literature, using peasant culture as the foundation.  Because of his peasant upbringing, he closely associated with the oral literature of the peasants, compiling it to use in his collection of folk songs, tales, and proverbs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sudimac|first=Nina|last2=Stojkovi\u0107|first2=Jelena S.|title=SYNTAX OF VERB FORMS IN SERBIAN FOLK PROVERBS BY VUK STEFANOVI\u0106 KARAD\u017dI\u0106|url=https://www.academia.edu/12887204/SYNTAX_OF_VERB_FORMS_IN_SERBIAN_FOLK_PROVERBS_BY_VUK_STEFANOVI%C4%86_KARAD%C5%BDI%C4%86|language=en}}</ref>  While Karad\u017ei\u0107 hardly considered peasant life romantic, he regarded it as an integral part of Serbian culture.  He collected several volumes of folk prose and poetry, including a book of over 100 lyrical and epic songs learned as a child and written down from memory.  He also published the first dictionary of vernacular Serbian. For his work he received little financial aid, at times living in poverty, though in the very last 9 years he did receive a pension from [[prince]] [[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mojedete.info/zivotni-put-vuka-karadzica/|title=\u017divotni put Vuka Karad\u017ei\u0107a po godinama (Biografija)|last=Anti\u0107|first=Dragan|date=2017-09-06|website=Moje dete|language=sr-RS|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref> In some cases Karad\u017ei\u0107 hid the fact that he had not only collected folk poetry by recording the oral literature but transcribed it from manuscript songbooks of other collectors from [[Srem]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Prilozi za knji\u017eevnost, jezik, istoriju i folklor|year=1965|publisher=\u0414\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u0430\u043c\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430, \u0425\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0430|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CnpHAQAAIAAJ&q=%22%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8+%D1%83+%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%22&dq=%22%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8+%D1%83+%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%22|accessdate=19 January 2012|page=264|language=Serbian}}</ref> His work had a chief role in establishing the importance of [[Kosovo]] in Serbian national identity and history.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Selvelli|first=Giustina|title=The Cultural Collaboration between Jacob Grimm and Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107.

His family settled from [[Drobnjaci]], and his mother was born in [[Ozrini\u0107i]], [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]] (in present-day [[Montenegro]].) His family had a low infant survival rate, thus he was named Vuk (\"wolf\") so that witches and evil spirits would not hurt him (the name was traditionally given to strengthen the bearer).\n\n===Education===\n[[File:\u0412\u0443\u043a \u0421\u0442\u0435\u0444\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u045f\u0438\u045b.1816.jpg|thumb|Oil painting by [[Pavel \u0110urkovi\u0107]], dating to 1816 (age 29)]]\nKarad\u017ei\u0107 was fortunate to be a relative of Jevta Savi\u0107 \u010cotri\u0107, the only literate person in the area at the time, who taught him how to read and write. Karad\u017ei\u0107 continued his education in the [[Trono\u0161a Monastery]] in Loznica. As a boy he learned [[calligraphy]] there, using a reed instead of a pen and a solution of gunpowder for ink. In lieu of proper writing paper he was lucky if he could get cartridge wrappings. Throughout the whole region, regular schooling was not widespread at that time and his father at first did not allow him to go to Austria. Since most of the time while in the monastery Karad\u017ei\u0107 was forced to pasture the livestock instead of studying, his father brought him back home. Meanwhile, the [[First Serbian Uprising]] seeking to overthrow the Ottomans began in 1804.

Later on, he met highly respected scholar [[Dositej Obradovi\u0107]] in [[Belgrade]], which was now in the hands of the [[Revolutionary Serbia]], in order to ask Obradovi\u0107 to support his studies. Unfortunately, Obradovi\u0107 dismissed him. Disappointed, Karad\u017ei\u0107 left for [[Jadar (Serbia)|Jadar]] and began working as a scribe for [[Jakov Nenadovi\u0107]]. After the founding of the [[Belgrade Higher School]], Karad\u017ei\u0107 became one of its first students.\n\n===Later life and death===\nSoon afterwards, he grew ill and left for medical treatment in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] and [[Novi Sad]], but was unable to receive treatment for his leg. It was rumored that Karad\u017ei\u0107 deliberately refused to undergo amputation, instead deciding to make do with a [[prosthetic]] wooden [[pegleg]], of which there were several sarcastic references in some of his works.{{clarify|reason=If his leg was not amputated, how could he have a prosthetic one?|date=November 2015}} Karad\u017ei\u0107 returned to Serbia by 1810, and as unfit for military service, he served as the secretary for commanders [[\u0110or\u0111e \u0106ur\u010dija|\u0106ur\u010dija]] and [[Hajduk-Veljko]]. His experiences would later give rise to two books. With the Ottoman defeat of the Serbian rebels in 1813, he left for [[Vienna]] and later met [[Jernej Kopitar]], an experienced linguist with a strong interest in secular [[slavistics]]. Kopitar's influence helped Karad\u017ei\u0107 with his struggle in reforming the [[Serbian language]] and its orthography.

In enlarged editions, these admirable songs drew towards themselves the attention of all literary Europe and America. [[Goethe]] characterized some of them as \"excellent and worthy of comparison with Solomon's ''Song of Songs''.\"\n\nIn 1824, he sent a copy of his folksong collection to [[Jacob Grimm]], who was enthralled particularly by [[The Building of Skadar]] which Karad\u017ei\u0107 recorded from singing of [[Old Rashko]].

This, in turn, would prove detrimental to Prince Milo\u0161's politics toward the Ottoman Empire, with whom he had recently forged an uneasy peace. In Montenegro, however, Njego\u0161's printing press operated without the archaic letter known as the \"[[hard sign]]\". Prince Milo\u0161 was to resent Njego\u0161's abandonment of the hard sign, over which, at that time, furious intellectual battles were being waged, with ecclesiastical hierarchy involved as well. Karad\u017ei\u0107's works, however, did receive high praise and recognition elsewhere, especially in [[Russian Empire]]. In addition to this, Karad\u017ei\u0107 was granted a full pension from the [[Emperor of All Russia]] in [[1826]].\n\nHe died in Vienna, and was survived by his daughter [[Mina Karad\u017ei\u0107]], who was a painter and writer, and by his son Dimitrije Karad\u017ei\u0107, a military officer. His remains were relocated to Belgrade in 1897 and buried with great honours next to the grave of [[Dositej Obradovi\u0107]], in front of [[St. Michael's Cathedral (Belgrade)]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.loznica.rs/OpstinaLoznica-Vuk-Stefanovi%C4%87-Karad%C5%BEi%C4%87_160_|title=Vuk Stefanovic Karadzic|website=www.loznica.rs|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref>\n\n==Work==\n\n===Linguistic reforms===\n[[File:1836 pre-reform Serbian transcript.png|thumb|Transcript of a hand-written debt note written in Sarajevo 1836, an example of pre-reform Serbian vernacular writing. Note that the three witnesses in the end of the letter each use their own spelling standards.]]\nKarad\u017ei\u0107 reformed the Serbian literary language and standardised the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]] by following strict [[Phoneme|phonemic]] principles on the [[Johann Christoph Adelung]]' model and [[Jan Hus]]' [[Czech alphabet]]. Karad\u017ei\u0107's reforms of the Serbian literary language modernised it and distanced it from Serbian and Russian [[Church Slavonic]], instead bringing it closer to common folk speech, specifically, to the dialect of Eastern [[Herzegovina]] which he spoke. Karad\u017ei\u0107 was, together with [[\u0110uro Dani\u010di\u0107]], the main Serbian signatory to the [[Vienna Literary Agreement]] of 1850 which, encouraged by [[Austria]]n authorities, laid the foundation for the Serbian language. Karad\u017ei\u0107 also translated the [[New Testament]] into Serbian, which was published in 1847. The Vukovian effort of language standardization lasted the remainder of the century. Before then the Serbs had achieved a fully independent state (1878), and a flourishing national culture based in Belgrade and Novi Sad. Despite the Vienna agreement, the Serbs had by this time developed an [[Ekavian accent|Ekavian pronunciation]], which was the native speech of their two cultural capitals as well as the great majority of the Serbian population.\n\n===Literature===\nIn addition to his linguistic reforms, Karad\u017ei\u0107 also contributed to folk literature, using peasant culture as the foundation.  Because of his peasant upbringing, he closely associated with the oral literature of the peasants, compiling it to use in his collection of folk songs, tales, and proverbs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sudimac|first=Nina|last2=Stojkovi\u0107|first2=Jelena S.|title=SYNTAX OF VERB FORMS IN SERBIAN FOLK PROVERBS BY VUK STEFANOVI\u0106 KARAD\u017dI\u0106|url=https://www.academia.edu/12887204/SYNTAX_OF_VERB_FORMS_IN_SERBIAN_FOLK_PROVERBS_BY_VUK_STEFANOVI%C4%86_KARAD%C5%BDI%C4%86|language=en}}</ref>  While Karad\u017ei\u0107 hardly considered peasant life romantic, he regarded it as an integral part of Serbian culture.  He collected several volumes of folk prose and poetry, including a book of over 100 lyrical and epic songs learned as a child and written down from memory.  He also published the first dictionary of vernacular Serbian. For his work he received little financial aid, at times living in poverty, though in the very last 9 years he did receive a pension from [[prince]] [[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mojedete.info/zivotni-put-vuka-karadzica/|title=\u017divotni put Vuka Karad\u017ei\u0107a po godinama (Biografija)|last=Anti\u0107|first=Dragan|date=2017-09-06|website=Moje dete|language=sr-RS|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref> In some cases Karad\u017ei\u0107 hid the fact that he had not only collected folk poetry by recording the oral literature but transcribed it from manuscript songbooks of other collectors from [[Srem]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Prilozi za knji\u017eevnost, jezik, istoriju i folklor|year=1965|publisher=\u0414\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u0430\u043c\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430, \u0425\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0430|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CnpHAQAAIAAJ&q=%22%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8+%D1%83+%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%22&dq=%22%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8+%D1%83+%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%22|accessdate=19 January 2012|page=264|language=Serbian}}</ref> His work had a chief role in establishing the importance of [[Kosovo]] in Serbian national identity and history.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Selvelli|first=Giustina|title=The Cultural Collaboration between Jacob Grimm and Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107.

Leskovac was known as Leskof\u00e7a during Ottoman rule and was bounded to [[Ni\u0161|Ni\u015f]] sanjak until 1878.\n\nSoon there were three watermill-driven lace producers in the region. In 1896, the founders of these companies pooled their resources and bought factory equipment for the production of woollen cloth from the [[German Empire]]. This was the first factory on the outskirts of the town. In 1903, a factory for hemp processing was built on the riverbank north of the old town centre. Amidst the [[First Serbian Uprising]] of the [[Serbian revolution]] (1804\u20131815), a forbidden [[Serbian Orthodox church]] was built in the town, through tricking the Turkish lords that the building would instead serve as a residence for the town-priest, and added a chimney, hence its name ''[[Od\u017eaklija]]'' (''Chimney''). In 1922, the Teokarevi\u0107 family opened a wool cloth factory in the small town of Vu\u010dje near Leskovac. By 1938, the private textile factories of Leskovac town employed 2,560 workers. In the 1870s, there were thousands of hemp-processors in Leskovac, producing up to 150,000 cartloads per year.\nThe city was once known as ''\"Little Manchester\"'', because of its 19th-century textile industry which was second only to that of [[Manchester]], [[England]]. The city continued to be a major textile center until the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, but due to the economic isolation of Serbia resulting from ethnic wars, its remote location, and failure to privatize the mills, the industry collapsed resulting in depression of the economy in the area.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"A Serbian Region Unravels With Its Textile Industry\", article by Nicholas Wood in ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 29, 2007</ref>\n\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Leskovac was part of the [[Vardar Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\n===World War II===\n{{main article|World War II in Yugoslavia}} [[File:Spomen park NOB, Leskovac 02.jpg|thumb|left|160px|WWII memorial park and \u201cGoddess of Victory\u201d statue]]\nDuring the [[World War II]], the city was part of [[German-occupied Serbia]].

Overall, industry has a minor growth, but its growth is safe and in the future, industry will certainly face another growth that will increase its status among Serbia's largest cities. Its main industry is light industry such as textile, household commodities and medical industries. Leskovac has mine of lead and zinc called \"Leskovac Lece\". \n\nThe first boom occurred after WW1 and lasted until 1941. It was \"succeeded\" in the late 1940s. During so called \"Yugoslav economic miracle\" (1950s \u2013 c.1980) Leskovac has developed into not just regional, but textile center in entire Southeast Europe.

Full independence from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Balkans]] initially had a negative impact on trade. However, by the end of the 19th century, the town of Leskovac was famous across the Balkans for its workshops which turned hemp into rope. Leskovac was known as Leskof\u00e7a during Ottoman rule and was bounded to [[Ni\u0161|Ni\u015f]] sanjak until 1878.\n\nSoon there were three watermill-driven lace producers in the region. In 1896, the founders of these companies pooled their resources and bought factory equipment for the production of woollen cloth from the [[German Empire]]. This was the first factory on the outskirts of the town. In 1903, a factory for hemp processing was built on the riverbank north of the old town centre. Amidst the [[First Serbian Uprising]] of the [[Serbian revolution]] (1804\u20131815), a forbidden [[Serbian Orthodox church]] was built in the town, through tricking the Turkish lords that the building would instead serve as a residence for the town-priest, and added a chimney, hence its name ''[[Od\u017eaklija]]'' (''Chimney''). In 1922, the Teokarevi\u0107 family opened a wool cloth factory in the small town of Vu\u010dje near Leskovac. By 1938, the private textile factories of Leskovac town employed 2,560 workers. In the 1870s, there were thousands of hemp-processors in Leskovac, producing up to 150,000 cartloads per year.\nThe city was once known as ''\"Little Manchester\"'', because of its 19th-century textile industry which was second only to that of [[Manchester]], [[England]]. The city continued to be a major textile center until the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, but due to the economic isolation of Serbia resulting from ethnic wars, its remote location, and failure to privatize the mills, the industry collapsed resulting in depression of the economy in the area.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"A Serbian Region Unravels With Its Textile Industry\", article by Nicholas Wood in ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 29, 2007</ref>\n\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Leskovac was part of the [[Vardar Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\n===World War II===\n{{main article|World War II in Yugoslavia}} [[File:Spomen park NOB, Leskovac 02.jpg|thumb|left|160px|WWII memorial park and \u201cGoddess of Victory\u201d statue]]\nDuring the [[World War II]], the city was part of [[German-occupied Serbia]].

It became known as \"Serbian Manchester\". Leskovac Lece was constructed during that era.

The late-season successes of the Thunder contributed to the signing of Scott Brooks as the team's official head coach.\n\nAfter moving to Oklahoma City from Seattle, the team's operating situation improved markedly.

Oklahoma City did not make any major moves in the offseason, other than drafting [[James Harden (basketball)|James Harden]] from [[Arizona State University]] with the third overall pick in the [[2009 NBA Draft|NBA Draft]].  The Thunder selected [[Rodrigue Beaubois]] with the 25th pick in the 2009 draft before immediately trading him to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] for the 24th pick, center [[Byron Mullens]] from [[Ohio State University]].  The team then added veteran center [[Etan Thomas]] and guard [[Kevin Ollie]].  The last major change to their roster occurred on December 22, 2009, when the team traded for [[Eric Maynor]] from the [[Utah Jazz]].  Maynor immediately supplanted Ollie as the backup point guard.\n\nFrom the outset the young team looked determined and cohesive. The increasing leadership of [[Kevin Durant]], along with the growing experience of the Thunder's younger players (including future [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Stars]] [[Russell Westbrook]], [[James Harden]] and [[Serge Ibaka]]), were signs of the Thunder's improvement. The 2009\u201310 season included several victories over the NBA's elite teams, including a 28-point blowout over the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] champion [[Orlando Magic]] and a 16-point blowout of the reigning NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers.  Road victories over the [[San Antonio Spurs]], [[Utah Jazz]], [[Miami Heat]], [[Boston Celtics]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]] further enhanced their reputation. Though they hovered around .500 for the first half of the season, they went on a 9-game winning streak that sent them into serious playoff contention. Kevin Durant became the youngest player in league history to win the scoring title, averaging 30.1 points per game while playing in all 82 games.\n\nThe Thunder finished 50\u201332, more than doubling their win total from the previous season. The 50\u201332 tied with the 2008 Denver Nuggets as the best 8th seed in the modern Playoffs era, at least in terms of record.

The Thunder selected [[Rodrigue Beaubois]] with the 25th pick in the 2009 draft before immediately trading him to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] for the 24th pick, center [[Byron Mullens]] from [[Ohio State University]].  The team then added veteran center [[Etan Thomas]] and guard [[Kevin Ollie]].  The last major change to their roster occurred on December 22, 2009, when the team traded for [[Eric Maynor]] from the [[Utah Jazz]].  Maynor immediately supplanted Ollie as the backup point guard.\n\nFrom the outset the young team looked determined and cohesive. The increasing leadership of [[Kevin Durant]], along with the growing experience of the Thunder's younger players (including future [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Stars]] [[Russell Westbrook]], [[James Harden]] and [[Serge Ibaka]]), were signs of the Thunder's improvement. The 2009\u201310 season included several victories over the NBA's elite teams, including a 28-point blowout over the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] champion [[Orlando Magic]] and a 16-point blowout of the reigning NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers.  Road victories over the [[San Antonio Spurs]], [[Utah Jazz]], [[Miami Heat]], [[Boston Celtics]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]] further enhanced their reputation. Though they hovered around .500 for the first half of the season, they went on a 9-game winning streak that sent them into serious playoff contention. Kevin Durant became the youngest player in league history to win the scoring title, averaging 30.1 points per game while playing in all 82 games.\n\nThe Thunder finished 50\u201332, more than doubling their win total from the previous season.

He left school at the age of sixteen due to financial problems. During the [[American War of Independence]] he served in military roles in the southern states, fighting under General [[Francis Marion]].  He participated with Colonel William Harden in the capture of Fort Balfour.\n\nFollowing the war, he was a planter and public figure.  Hamilton served South Carolina in many public offices including state Representative (1787), State Senator (1794), Comptroller (1800), and the [[List of Governors of South Carolina|42nd]] [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] (1804).\n\nIn 1809, President [[James Madison]] selected Hamilton to become the third Secretary of the Navy. His term in office included the first months of the [[War of 1812]], during which time the small [[United States Navy]] achieved several remarkable victories over British warships.\nHamilton was a proponent of military preparedness, especially sea fortifications. Although he wanted to strengthen the Navy, he found the Congress hostile and the President indifferent to his ideas. However, he was responsible for the Naval Hospitals Act of 1811.  Secretary Hamilton resigned at the end of 1812 and returned to South Carolina, where he died in Beaufort on June 30, 1816.\n\nThree Navy [[destroyer]]s have been named {{USS|Paul Hamilton}} in his honor along with {{USS|Hamilton|1809|6}} and one Liberty ship named {{SS|Paul Hamilton}}.

He left school at the age of sixteen due to financial problems. During the [[American War of Independence]] he served in military roles in the southern states, fighting under General [[Francis Marion]].  He participated with Colonel William Harden in the capture of Fort Balfour.\n\nFollowing the war, he was a planter and public figure.  Hamilton served South Carolina in many public offices including state Representative (1787), State Senator (1794), Comptroller (1800), and the [[List of Governors of South Carolina|42nd]] [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] (1804).\n\nIn 1809, President [[James Madison]] selected Hamilton to become the third Secretary of the Navy. His term in office included the first months of the [[War of 1812]], during which time the small [[United States Navy]] achieved several remarkable victories over British warships.\nHamilton was a proponent of military preparedness, especially sea fortifications. Although he wanted to strengthen the Navy, he found the Congress hostile and the President indifferent to his ideas. However, he was responsible for the Naval Hospitals Act of 1811.  Secretary Hamilton resigned at the end of 1812 and returned to South Carolina, where he died in Beaufort on June 30, 1816.\n\nThree Navy [[destroyer]]s have been named {{USS|Paul Hamilton}} in his honor along with {{USS|Hamilton|1809|6}} and one Liberty ship named {{SS|Paul Hamilton}}.

The Nottingham Panthers would go on to play for fourteen seasons, claiming three league championships and one Autumn Cup title. The Panthers joined the new British National League in 1954 and following the league's collapse in 1960 the club were left with little option but to fold. The Nottingham Panthers would eventually be reformed two decades later and continue play to this day.\n\n==1939-50: Formation, World War II and early years==\n\nThe [[Nottingham Ice Stadium]] opened on 10 April 1939 and hosted its first game of [[ice hockey]] two days later when the [[Harringay Racers]] defeated the [[Harringay Greyhounds]] 10\u20136 in a challenge game.<ref>Nottingham Evening Post, 13 April 1939, 'Ice Hockey Thrills Crowd of 5,000 at Nottingham Match - Harringay Teams in Opposition'</ref> The souvenir brochure published to mark the Stadium's opening included details of a new professional ice hockey team called the Nottingham Panthers to begin play in the [[English National League]] that autumn.<ref name=\"footballpost\">Mick Holland, ''[[Nottingham Evening Post]] Football Post (November 18, 2006), No. 18, Vol. LXXXVI</ref> A team was assembled in [[Canada]] and brought to the [[United Kingdom]] but were promptly sent home having not played a single game due to the outbreak of [[World War II]].<ref name=\"footballpost\"/> Some of the players from this team didn't even get the chance to see the Ice Stadium.<ref name=\"homes\">Martin C Harris, Homes of British Ice Hockey</ref>\n\nHowever, three challenge games were played by teams calling themselves the Nottingham Panthers during 1939\u201340. The first was on November 15, 1939 when the Panthers were defeated 7-4 by a team of Canadians based at the nearby [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[Grantham]]. The second took place on December 2, 1939 when the Panthers defeated 'RAF (Canadians Section)' 8-7 and the final game took place on February 2, 1940 when a team known as the 'Cambridge Canadians' were defeated 12\u20131.

The new club appointed [[Winter Olympics|Olympic]] [[Ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics|gold medalist]] and former [[Wembley Lions]] player [[Alex Archer|Alex 'Sandy' Archer]] as their coach and he recruited a team largely from his home city of [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Chick Zamick| work=The Times Chick Zamick obituary | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article2885407.ece | accessdate=November 21, 2007  | location=London | date=November 17, 2007}}</ref> The Panthers made their competitive debut on November 22, 1946 when they defeated the [[Wembley Monarchs]] 3\u20132 at the Ice Stadium.

The Panthers defeated [[AIK Hockey|AIK]] and [[Hammarby IF Hockey (1921\u20132008)|Hammarby IF]] before again splitting two games against the Swedish national side. After a second-place finish in the Autumn Cup, the Panthers' season took a turn for the worse in February 1952 when Zamick broke his left arm.<ref name=\"scrapbook\"/> The team won only eight more games and the reigning league champions fell to the bottom of the standings.

This new structure involved four of the five members of the English League and the eight members of the [[Scottish National League (1932\u20131954)|Scottish National League]]. The membership of the league fell to eleven following the withdrawal of [[Dunfermline Vikings]] early in the league campaign and it was soon announced that all [[Scotland|Scottish]] clubs apart from [[Paisley Pirates]] would be withdrawing at the end of the season.<ref name=\"guidebook\"/> The Panthers finished in second place in the league behind [[Harringay Racers]].

During December, Nottingham toured [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Germany]] where they played the Czechoslovakian national team and club sides including [[K\u00f6lner Haie|K\u00f6ln]], [[DEG Metro Stars|D\u00fcsseldorf]] and [[Adler Mannheim|Mannheim]].<ref name=\"scrapbook\"/> In 1957-58 the Panthers finished third in the Autumn Cup table and a runner-up to [[Brighton Tigers]] in the league and again undertook a tour of Czechoslovakia.\n\nAfter an eleven association with the Panthers, [[Chick Zamick]] left Nottingham in the summer of 1958 to take up a coaching position in [[Geneva]].<ref name=\"zamick\"/> He was replaced by player [[Lorne Smith]].<ref name=\"scrapbook\"/> Though [[Murrayfield Racers|Edinburgh]] took part in the Autumn Cup, the 1958-59 league consisted of only four teams after the closure of the [[Harringay Arena]].<ref name=\"guidebook\"/> Panthers finished bottom in both competitions. The following season [[Streatham Redskins|Streatham]] rejoined the league after a five-year absence. The 1959\u201360 season also saw the reintroduction of the [[British Championship (ice hockey)|British Championship]] after a thirty-year absence. After a third-place finish in the Autumn Cup, the Panthers finished second in the league to qualify for Championships.\n\nIn the semi final the Panthers faced the league champions Streatham. The Panthers were defeated 5\u20134 in the first leg in [[London]] but won the second leg 3\u20131 to win the tie 7\u20136. In the final the Panthers faced Brighton who had defeated Paisley 11\u20138 in the other semi final. The first leg was played in Brighton, with the Tigers winning 3\u20132. A week later, on 6 May 1960, the Panthers won the second leg by the same scoreline, forcing the first [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] the club had ever taken part in.

With an area of 45,110 ''km''<sup>''2''</sup>, it is the second largest district in the country (after [[Kutch District|Kutch]], [[Gujarat]]) in terms of area. It is bounded on the north by [[Gilgit-Baltistan]]'s Kharmang and Ghanche districts and [[Xinjiang]]'s Kashgar and Hotan prefectures linked via the historic [[Karakoram Pass]]. It has [[Aksai Chin]] and [[Tibet]] are to the east, [[Kargil district]] to the west, and [[Lahul and Spiti]] to the south. The district headquarters is in [[Leh]]. It lies between [[32nd parallel north|32]] to [[36th parallel north|36 degree]] north latitude and [[75th meridian east|75]] to [[80th meridian east|80 degree]] east longitude.\n\nThe whole of Ladakh was under the administration of Leh until 1 July 1979, when the Kargil and Leh administrative districts were created. Religion has been a source of grievances between Buddhists and Muslims since the late 20th century and was a contributor to this division.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081006063842/http://kashmirsentinel.com/aug2002/8.html Muslim Precedence Politics - How it operates in Ladakh]</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the district was declared a tobacco-free zone.

In [[1998 FIFA World Cup|France 1998]], Norway was eliminated by Italy in the first round of the knock out stage after finishing second in their group, having drawn against [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and won 2\u20131 against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. \n\nThe former under-21 coach [[Nils Johan Semb]] replaced Olsen after the planned retirement of the latter, but did not manage to achieve the same results as Olsen.

In fact, Norway is the only team in the world who has played [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and never lost, winning two matches and drawing on two other occasions.\n\n==Early history==\n[[Association football]] came to Norway from [[Great Britain]] in the 1880s, and quickly became popular both in terms of active players and as a spectator sport. Norway's first football club, Christiania FC was founded in 1885. The oldest club still in existence is [[Odd Grenland]], formed in 1894. In the following years, several more clubs were formed, and in 1902 the [[Football Association of Norway]] was formed. Later that year, the inaugural [[Norwegian Football Cup]] was held. However, it wasn't until 1908, at the invitation of the Swedish FA, that a national team was put together.\n\n==The first international match==\nNorway's first-ever international game was played on 12 July 1908 in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]].<ref name=\"RSSF1908\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.no/1908/National.html |title=Norwegian national team 1908 |accessdate=2007-11-11 |last=Aarhus |first=Lars |work=RSSF}}</ref> This was also [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]'s first-ever international match.

Gran would later become famous as an aviator and polar explorer.<ref name=\"bestiverden\"/> The Norway team also included Paul Hauman, a Belgian engineer who was working in Norway at the time. Because he played for Mercantile, and because there were no clear international eligibility rules at the time, Hauman was able to play for Norway in this match despite being a citizen of [[Belgium]]. To this day, Hauman remains the only player who has played for the Norway team without holding a Norwegian passport.<ref name=\"bestiverden\"/>\n\nThe match started off good for the Norwegians. Within the first minute, [[:no:Minotti B\u00f8hn|Minotti B\u00f8hn]] scored the first goal of the game, but then Sweden took over and scored the next five goals before Hans Endrerud reduced the deficit right before half-time. Sweden continued to run rampant in the second half, and Norway's only consolation was a second goal from B\u00f8hn. When the referee blew the final whistle, Sweden had won by a score of 11\u20133.<ref name=\"oppslagsbok324\"/><ref name=\"1908matchreport\"/>\n\nA popular anecdote from this match is the story of Tryggve Gran literally fighting for the flag. At the time of the match, only three years had passed since [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|Norway's independence from Sweden]], and there was still bitterness about the dissolution of the union on both sides of the border. Near the end of the match, some Swedish spectators mockingly lowered the Norwegian flag at the stadium to [[half mast]], which Gran took as a great insult. While the match was still being played, he walked off the pitch to the flagpole to raise the flag back to the top.<ref name=\"bestiverden\"/>\n\n==1910s==\nAfter the heavy defeat against Sweden, it would take two years until the next time a Norwegian national side was put together. Once again, the Swedes were the opposition, and this time it was the Norwegians who held the home-field advantage. It was, however, the Swedes who won the match. This time, the final score was 4\u20130. Norway also went home with two straight defeats when they participated in the [[Stockholm]] [[Football at the 1912 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] of [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912]]. The opponents were [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and [[Austria national football team|Austria]].\n\nOverall, the period between 1908 and 1917 is a sorry chapter in the Norwegian national team's history. In those nine years, Norway failed to win a single game. Rock bottom was reached on 7 October 1917 when Norway were routed 12\u20130 against Denmark. To this date, this is Norway's heaviest ever defeat.<ref name=\"oppslagsbok327\">{{cite book |editor= Bertelsen, Ingvald|others= Berglund, Tom Harald and Odden, Iver|title= Oppslagsbok om norsk fotball |type= paperback |year=2000 |publisher=[[Wagner & Flust Forlag]] |location=[[Oslo]] |isbn=82-92228-00-4 |pages=327 |language=no}}</ref>\n\nNear the end of the decade, things began to improve. A new national team coach was hired in 1918. His name was Birger M\u00f6ller, and he was Swedish. M\u00f6ller is said to have been an excellent motivator, and spent a lot of time practicing team play and technical skills &ndash; and good results followed. On 16 June 1918, after 27 straight games without a win, Norway avenged the embarrassing defeat in [[Copenhagen]] the year before by winning 3\u20131 against Denmark in [[Oslo]] to record its first-ever victory. A few months later, Norway defeated arch-rivals Sweden by a score of 5\u20131 in Gothenburg, which was Norway's first-ever away victory.\n\n==1920s==\n[[File:Norway national football team 1921.jpg|thumb|The Norway team at the 1920 Olympics.]]\nNorway's biggest star in the 1920s was unquestionably [[Einar Gundersen|Einar \"Jeja\" Gundersen]], who scored a total of 26 international goals between 1917 and 1928. Other stars at the time were team captain [[Gunnar Andersen]] ([[FK Lyn|Lyn]]), [[Per Skou]] (Lyn and [[Odd Grenland|Odd]]) and [[Asbj\u00f8rn Halvorsen]] ([[Sarpsborg FK|Sarpsborg]]). These players formed the core of the side that participated in the [[Football at the 1912 Summer Olympics|1920 Olympics]] in [[Antwerp]], where Norway got their greatest win to that date.\n\nIn the opening match of the [[1912 Summer Olympics|Olympic tournament]], Norway faced pre-tournament favorites [[England national football team|England]]. It may have been an amateur side, but England was nevertheless the home of football, and the team was expected to ease past Norway. It is said that Gunnar Andersen was the first to show that the English players were not supermen, by dribbling past several players. His confidence passed on to the other Norwegian players, and when the smoke cleared, Norway had won 3\u20131 courtesy of two goals by \"Jeja\" Gundersen and one goal by [[Einar Wilhelms]].\n\nIn the next round, Norway faced [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], but there was to be no repeat of the sensational win against England. The Czechoslovakians won the game 4\u20130.\n\nNorway claimed a few more scalps in the following years, including a 2\u20130 win against [[France national football team|France]] in [[Paris]] in 1923, as well as a few more wins against arch-rivals Sweden. However, in the latter half of the 1920s, the golden era was over. Between 1924 and 1928, Norway won only four matches &ndash; all of them against [[Finland national football team|Finland]].\n\nThe bad spell began to end near the turn of the decade, largely thanks to new star players like goalkeeper [[Henry Johansen|Henry \"Tippen\" Johansen]] and striker [[J\u00f8rgen Juve]], who is Norway's all-time leading scorer on international level with 33 goals. On 23 June 1929, Juve scored twice as Norway defeated Denmark by a score of 5\u20132 in Copenhagen. It was Norway's first-ever away win against Denmark.\n\n==1930s==\nIn 1933, [[Viking FK|Viking]]'s brilliant inside-forward [[Reidar Kvammen]] made his international debut. Two years later, Lyn's wing wizard [[Arne Brustad]] made his debut. Furthermore, in 1934, former national team hero [[Asbj\u00f8rn Halvorsen]] returned home after 12 years in Germany. These events mark the start of what is known as Norwegian football's \"Bronze Age\".\n\nWhen Halvorsen returned from Germany, he was hired as general secretary of the NFF, and thus also became chairman of the national team's selection committee. At the time, team selection was handled by the selection committee, while the coach's sole responsibility was training the players the selection committee had picked. However, Halvorsen also named himself team coach, and thus became Norway's first \"modern\" national team manager.\n\nNorway had gotten several good results leading up to the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Berlin Olympics]], including wins against [[Austria national football team|Austria]] and [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]. Even so, few people believed Norway would stand a chance in the Olympic tournament, especially since they were scheduled to face the host nation in the second round (if they could get past [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] in the opener). The match against Turkey went easier than expected, as Norway won 4\u20130. The next match was against the [[Germany national football team|Germans]], who had demolished [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] 9\u20130 in their opener. It is said that the [[Norwegians]] were so sure of defeat that they had booked return tickets to Norway two days after the Germany game. If this is true, the travel arrangements would have had to be altered.\n\nIn front of a capacity crowd that included [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]], Norway got a fully deserved 2\u20130 win against the hosts. Both goals were scored by [[Magnar Isaksen]], and the win meant that Germany were knocked out and Norway advanced to the semi-finals, where they faced [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. The match against Italy was a closely contested one, but the Italians eventually won the game 2\u20131 after extra time. Arne Brustad scored the Norwegian goal. Next up was the third-place match against [[Poland national football team|Poland]], where Brustad scored a hat-trick and guided Norway to a 3\u20132 victory. Norway had won the bronze medals, and Brustad was hailed as one of the best players of the tournament.\n\nTwo years later, Norway took part in their first [[FIFA World Cup]]. Norway had qualified after defeating the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] by an aggregate score of 6\u20135. Reidar Kvammen was the big hero, having scored twice in both matches. The [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup]] was a straight knockout tournament, and in the opening round, Norway were drawn against defending world champions Italy.\n\nThe match, which was played in [[Marseille]], was very tight and exciting. Italy took an early lead, but Norway equalised seven minuted before the final whistle, when Brustad ran past the entire Italian defence and slotted the ball past the keeper. A few minutes later, everyone believed that Brustad had added his second, but this goal was disallowed because of a highly disputed offside call. So, just like in the Olympic tournament two years earlier, the game went to extra time &ndash; and once again, the Italians came out on top thanks to a goal by [[Silvio Piola]]. And just like in the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]], Italy went on to win the entire tournament. There was a small consolation for Brustad later that year, when he was picked in the \"Rest of Europe XI\" that played against England at Wembley.\n\nOn 22 October 1939, Norway lost 4\u20131 against Denmark in Copenhagen. This would turn out to become Norway's last international match for nearly six years.\n\n==1940s==\nWhen Norway was invaded by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in 1940, practically all organized football operations were ceased. Asbj\u00f8rn Halvorsen was among the figureheads of the sports boycott, and was arrested and sent to a [[internment#Concentration camp|concentration camp]]. Many other sports figures, including Reidar Kvammen, were also put in concentration camps. Although many players tried to keep fit, and a few illegal matches were organized, the six-year hiatus set Norwegian football back by several years &ndash; which became painstakingly evident in the first post-war game against Sweden in Stockholm on 21 October 1945.\n\nMany of the old heroes were in the side that faced Sweden that day. Brustad, [[\u00d8ivind Holmsen]] and [[Alf Martinsen|Alf \"Kaka\" Martinsen]] had played for the \"Bronze Team\", while [[Kristian Henriksen]], [[Knut Brynildsen]] and [[Rolf Johannessen]] had played in the 1938 World Cup. However, six years is a long time in football, and the Swedes, who had not been involved in [[World War II|the war]], had a great side in the making, and won the game by a score of 10\u20130. When Sweden scored their ninth goal, team joker Kristian Henriksen reportedly told his teammates, ''\"OK lads, lets go for a draw\"''. The Bronze Age was over.\n\nEventually, new players were added to the team towards the end of the 1940s. Two of the biggest names were striker [[Gunnar Thoresen (footballer)|Gunnar Thoresen]] and defender [[Thorbj\u00f8rn Svenssen]], who was nicknamed \"Klippen\" (''\"The Rock\"''). Also, Bronze Team hero Reidar Kvammen still had some skills remaining in his feet and became the first Norwegian to reach 50 caps in 1948. Although the team was nowhere near the levels of the pre-war side, they did notch up a few big wins. In 1946, [[Finland national football team|Finland]] were routed by a score of 12\u20130, and two years later, Norway won 11\u20130 against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] in a match where [[Odd Wang S\u00f8rensen]] scored five goals &ndash; which to this day is the team record for most goals scored by one player in a single game.\n\nIn 1949, an 18-year-old inside-forward from \u00d8rn-Horten named [[Per Bredesen]] made his international debut. He scored in his debut and received rave reviews. Norway had uncovered a new star, and as Norway entered the 1950s, people believed Norway had a new great side in the making. Unfortunately, young Bredesen's national team career was short-lived. In 1952, Bredesen was signed a professional contract with Italian giants [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] &ndash; and according to the NFF's self-imposed amateur rules, he was banished from the national team. In an age where most countries in [[western Europe]] had introduced professional football, the old amateur ideals of the 19th century were still the rule in Norway.\n\n==1950s==\nVictories were few and far between for the Norwegian national side in the 1950s, and the few games Norway actually did manage to win were usually against fellow minnows Finland and [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]]. Norway did manage a sensational 2\u20131 win against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in a [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] qualifier, but other than that, there were few highlights. In the return game against the Hungarians, Norway were beaten 5\u20130.\n\nThorbj\u00f8rn Svenssen remained a mainstay in Norway's central defence throughout the decade, and when he finally bowed down in 1962, he had played an amazing 104 full internationals. At the time, he was only the second footballer in history to reach a [[List of football (soccer) players with 100 or more caps|century of caps]] (the first was England captain [[Billy Wright (footballer born 1924)|Billy Wright]]). Another national team star at the time was striker [[Harald Hennum]], whose 25 international goals is a post-war record.\n\nNobody knows what Norway might have achieved if Per Bredesen had been available, but the amateur rules were still in force, even though they were somewhat relaxed in 1960 to allow another Italian exile, [[Ragnar Larsen]], who had recently returned home, to once again play for his country.\n\nIn 1959, Norway finished the year with four straight defeats and 22 conceded goals.\n\n==1960s==\nFollowing the dismal end to the last year, Austrian [[Wilhelm Kment]] was hired as new national team coach in 1960. Another newcomer was a 17-year-old winger from [[SK Brann|Brann]] named [[Roald Jensen]], but became known only by his nickname \"''Kniksen''\". The slightly built teenager was a wizard with the ball, and suddenly, Norway had a new star \u2013 and new-found optimism. Another talented youngster, attacking midfielder [[Olav Nilsen]] made his debut a couple of years later. Nilsen would be a mainstay in the side throughout the decade. \"Kniksen\" on the other hand, went abroad just like Per Bredesen before him, and thus became disqualified from further national team play.\n\nThere was little improvement to be found in the results column, but once in a while, Norway pulled off a shock result. They won against Sweden and [[Netherlands national football team|Holland]] in 1962, and defeated [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] by a score of 4\u20133 in 1963. However, this fine win was followed by a 9\u20130 defeat against [[Poland national football team|Poland]], just to confirm that despite the occasional victory, Norway were still among the bottom-feeders of European football.\n\nIn the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] qualifiers, Norway emerged as serious contenders for qualification for the first time in three decades. Though the home-based amateur only rule was retained, Norway boasted a promising side including Finn Seemann, Harald Berg, Olav Nilsen and Egil Olsen. All told, they finished runners up behind [[France national football team|France]] with 7 points (3 wins, 1 draw and 2 defeats) with two narrow defeats by France proving costly.\n\nOne of Norway's most shocking results in the 1960s was the victory against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] in a [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] qualifier. The Yugoslavs had finished second in the [[1960 European Nations' Cup|1960 European Championship]] a few years earlier, and was rated as one of the continent's top sides &ndash; but they had to travel home from Ullevaal with a 3\u20130 defeat in their bags thanks to goals from [[Finn Seemann]], [[Odd Iversen]] and the new star player from northern Norway, [[Harald Berg|Harald \"Dutte\" Berg]]. Norway also played well against [[France national football team|France]] in this qualifying campaign, but both matches ended with narrow defeats. This was nevertheless the closest Norway had come to reaching a major tournament since the glory days of the 1930s.\n\nNorway once again faced France in the qualifying tournament for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]]. The home match ended with a rather predictable 3\u20131 defeat, but in the first leg in [[Strasbourg]], Norway had pulled off another shock result and won the game 1\u20130. [[Odd Iversen]] scored the only goal of the game. France never recovered and were eventually eliminated by Sweden.\n\nAmong the other notable facts, it might be mentioned that [[Fredrikstad FK|Fredrikstad]] defender [[Roar Johansen (footballer)|Roar Johansen]] played 54 consecutive internationals between 1960 and 1967. Not even Thorbj\u00f8rn Svenssen managed a streak like that. Another piece of trivia was that goalkeeper [[Kjell Kaspersen]] scored on a penalty in the 7\u20130 friendly win against [[Thailand national football team|Thailand]] in 1965. This makes Kaspersen the only goalkeeper to have scored for the Norwegian national side.\n\n==1970s==\nIn 1969, the self-imposed amateur rule was finally abolished, and foreign-based professionals like \"Kniksen\" and Finn Seemann could once again play with the flag on their chest. It also meant that domestic stars like Odd Iversen and Harald Berg could move abroad without jeopardizing their national team eligibility.\n\nHowever, the rule change did not improve the results. If anything, the national team's results in the early 1970s got even worse. During the [[UEFA Euro 1972]] qualifying campaign, Norway picked up only one point in six games, and in a [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] qualifier against Holland, Norway lost 9\u20130. The next year, they suffered a perhaps even more humiliating result by losing against [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]].\n\nThere were, however, a few bright spots. A new star emerged in the form of [[Tom Lund]], who made his international debut in 1971. A playmaker in the [[Johan Cruyff]] mold, \"Tommy\" was without question a great player. Many consider him to be the Norway's finest player ever, but even he couldn't carry the team on his own, and Norway continued to finish last in their [[FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA European Football Championship|UEFA European Championship]] qualifying groups.\n\nIn the late 1970s, however, there were signs of improvement. Guided by Tom Lund and new head coach [[Tor R\u00f8ste Fossen]], Norway defeated both Sweden and [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in the qualifying campaign for the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]]. The win against Sweden was somewhat marred by [[Svein Gr\u00f8ndalen]]'s vicious tackle on Swedish star player [[Ralf Edstr\u00f6m]], but when Norway played their last World Cup qualifier away against Switzerland, they still had a theoretical chance of reaching the finals. However, the game ended with a 1\u20130 defeat, and Norway once again had to stay home.\n\nIn addition to the \"A\" team, Norway also fielded an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] side in the late 1970s. To play for the Olympic side, you had to be an amateur, and not have played any World Cup qualifiers. The Olympic side was, in other words, a \"B\" side, but their matches are nonetheless regarded as full internationals by the NFF (but not recognized by [[FIFA]]). The Olympic team got quite good results, and in 1979, they qualified for the [[Moscow]] [[1980 Summer Olympics|Games]] after beating Finland and [[Germany national football team|West Germany]]'s amateur side in the qualifiers. [[Arne Larsen \u00d8kland]] became the hero with the winning goal against the Germans. Incidentally, \u00d8kland became a professional in the [[Fu\u00dfball-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] shortly afterwards.\n\nThe Olympic side never got the chance to play in the Olympics, because Norway [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycotted]] the games along with the United States and most of the Western European countries as a protest against the Soviet invasion of [[Afghanistan]].\n\n==1980s==\nThe 1980s got off to a promising start for Norway with a victory against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]]. The good run continued with a 6\u20131 win against Finland (a game where [[P\u00e5l Jacobsen]] scored four goals) and victory against Switzerland in a World Cup qualifier. Even a 4\u20130 loss against [[England national football team|England]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] did not kill the optimism, because after all, England were one of the best teams in the world &ndash; at least in the eyes of the Norwegian public.\n\nNarrow defeats against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] and [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in the spring of 1981 ensured that Norway once again failed to reach the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|World Cup finals]], but they still had pride to play for when England entered [[Ullevaal Stadion|Ullevaal]] on 9 September 1981. Norway's previous five encounters against England's full-time pros had all ended with heavy defeats and a combined goal difference of 2\u201324. Few people believed that trend was about to end that day. The most optimistic pundits hoped for a narrow defeat. In this game, Norway had Tom Lund and the new star [[Hallvar Thoresen]] back in the side. Both had missed the match at Wembley the year before.\n\nThe match started badly for Norway. England got off to an early lead through [[Bryan Robson]], but Norway clawed their way back into the game, and midway through the first half, Norway got an equaliser from a Tom Lund cross. The goal was awarded to [[Roger Albertsen]], but television replays have later shown that Albertsen did in fact not touch the ball, and Lund's cross went straight into the net. When Hallvar Thoresen added a second shortly before half time, the shock was in the making. Despite a heavy English pressure in the second half, Norway held on, and had achieved (in the eyes of the Norwegian media) their greatest result ever. It was after this game that radio commentator [[Bj\u00f8rge Lillelien]] gave his famous \"Your boys took a hell of a beating\" routine.\n\nLed by Tom Lund, Norway had a fairly good team in the early 1980s. In 1982, Norway beat [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] 3\u20131 in a [[UEFA Euro 1984]] qualifier with goals by Lund, \u00d8kland and [[\u00c5ge Hareide]]. At the halfway mark, Norway looked to have a good chance of reaching the European Championship. However, Tom Lund retired at the end of the 1982 season, and without their playmaker, Norway was once again a mediocrity and gained only one point in the remaining Euro qualifiers, and once again finished last in the group.\n\nThe Olympic team was also put back together, this time to qualify for the Los Angeles Olympics. Norway only finished third in the group, behind [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and the [[East Germany national football team|GDR]] &ndash; but when the [[Eastern Bloc]] later decided to boycott the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]], Norway were handed the vacant spot. In the finals, Norway gave a pretty good performance. The opening game against [[Chile national football team|Chile]] finished goalless, and the second game against [[France national football team|France]] finished with a narrow defeat, which meant that the 2\u20130 victory in the final game against [[Qatar national football team|Qatar]] was to no avail. Norway were knocked out in the group stage. On the bright side, the Olympic team included several players who would become mainstays in the \"A\" team in the following years, such as [[Per Egil Ahlsen]], [[Terje Kojedal]], [[Tom Sundby]] and last but not least goalkeeper [[Erik Thorstvedt]].\n\nThe team got a few more scalps in the mid-1980s. In 1985, Norway won 2\u20131 away against defending world champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]], and the next spring, future world champions [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] were defeated 1\u20130 at Ullevaal. However, both these matches were friendlies, and in the games that really mattered, Norway were still also-rans. A few weeks after the win against Italy, Norway lost 5\u20131 at home to Denmark in a [[1986 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifier. In short, Norway in the 1980s was a team that could beat anyone on a given day, but they could also lose against anyone on a given day &ndash; and there were a lot more bad days than good days.\n\n==1990s==\nIn October 1990, national team coach [[Ingvar Stadheim]] resigned after a bad start to the Euro 92 qualifying campaign. His replacement was U21 coach [[Egil Olsen|Egil \"Drillo\" Olsen]], and this coaching change would signal the start of Norway's best period in modern times. Olsen's style of play may not always have been pretty to watch, and got a lot of criticism both at home and abroad, but the style got results.\n\nIn terms of individual players, Norway in the early 1990s was probably not the best team in their history. Only defender [[Rune Bratseth]] and goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt were regarded as true stars on the international level. These two formed the backbone of a side that otherwise included youngsters like [[\u00d8yvind Leonhardsen]], [[Stig Inge Bj\u00f8rnebye]], [[Lars Bohinen]] and [[Erik Mykland]].\n\nThe first indication that Norway had a great team in the making came in the Euro qualifier against Italy on 5 June 1991, where goals from Bohinen and [[Tore Andr\u00e9 Dahlum]] led the side to a 2\u20131 win. Earlier that night, the Norwegian U21 side had defeated the Italian youngsters 6\u20130. Norway failed to reach the [[UEFA Euro 1992|European Championship]] finals, but they remained in contention until the very last game, and finished a respectable third behind [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] and Italy.\n\nTowards the end of the Euro qualifiers, Olsen recalled former youth prodigy [[Kjetil Rekdal]], who had been out of the national team for more than two years after a failed spell in the Bundesliga. As the midfield anchorman, Rekdal would become one of the team's most important players throughout the 1990s.\n\nIn the qualifying tournament for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], Norway were drawn in the same group as [[England national football team|England]], [[Netherlands national football team|Holland]] and [[Poland national football team|Poland]]. Getting to the World Cup from this group was impossible, according to the pundits, but Olsen had other ideas. The qualifying campaign got off to a great start with a 10\u20130 win against minnows [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]]. This match was followed by a surprising win against Holland, and when Norway managed a draw in the away game against England through Kjetil Rekdal's 35-yard screamer, the Norwegian public were starting to believe that the national team might actually reach the finals.\n\nThe road to the World Cup continued in 1993, when Norway won 3\u20131 against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], followed by a great 2\u20130 win against England and a somewhat fortunate goalless draw against Holland in Rotterdam. The World Cup tickets were secured on October 13, when Norway defeated Poland by 3\u20130 in [[Pozna\u0144]] after goals by [[Jostein Flo]], [[Jan \u00c5ge Fj\u00f8rtoft]] and [[Ronny Johnsen]].  A 2\u20131 defeat by Turkey in their next match meant nothing: Norway had reached the World Cup finals for the first time since 1938. In October 1993, Norway had managed the amazing feat of being ranked the second best team in the world (behind Brazil) on the [[FIFA World Rankings]].\n\nThe finals were somewhat of a disappointment for the Norwegian team. The tournament got off to a fine start with a win against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] in a match that won't go down in history as a classic. Substitute Kjetil Rekdal scored a late winner. This match was followed by a 0\u20131, 11\u201310 men defeat against Italy, and after two games, all four teams in the group had collected three points. This meant that Norway would progress to the next round with a win against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]. They would also progress with a draw if the match between Italy and Mexico got a winner. The match against Ireland ended in a disappointing goalless draw &ndash; and since the Italy v Mexico game also ended with a draw, Norway were knocked out by the slimmest of margins.\n\nNext up was the [[UEFA Euro 1996]] qualifiers. Norway looked like qualifying through most of the campaign, but stumbled in the last two games against the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] and Holland, and were knocked out. At this point, Bratseth and Thorstvedt had both retired and been replaced with [[Henning Berg]] and [[Frode Grod\u00e5s]] respectively. Two other new faces in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifying campaign for the 1998 World Cup]] were young strikers [[Tore Andr\u00e9 Flo]] and [[Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r]]. Solskj\u00e6r scored twice in the 5\u20130 win against [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]], and was later signed by [[Manchester United F.C.]]. Flo got his breakthrough on the international stage when he scored twice in the 4\u20132 friendly win against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at Ullevaal. Norway clinched the World Cup spot with a 4\u20130 win against Finland two rounds before the end of the qualifying campaign.\n\nJust like 60 years earlier, Norway had reached a [[1998 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] played in France. History would repeat itself in more ways. Just like in the last World Cup, Norway were unimpressive in the opening matches. The first two matches against [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] ended with draws, which meant that Norway faced the difficult task of beating Brazil if they were to advance to the second round.\n\n\"23 June 1998\" and [[Marseille]] will always be remembered as the date and venue of one of Norway's greatest victories. Brazil did have most of the attacking play, and when [[Bebeto]] gave the Brazilians the lead after 78 minutes, it looked like Norway were heading for another early exit. However, in a few minutes, Tore Andr\u00e9 Flo got an equalizer, and when he was pulled down in the area two minutes before the final whistle, Norway got a penalty. Kjetil Rekdal fired the penalty into the back of the net. Norway had come from behind to win against Brazil, and advanced to the second round &ndash; once again in Marseille, and once again against Italy. The game was also notable for the Flo foul leading to the penalty not being shown on FIFA's official cameras, only for a few days later footage captured by a camera operated by Swedish broadcaster [[Sveriges Television|SVT]] was released showing otherwise.\n\nThe match against the Italians was a disappointing performance from the Norwegians. Italy got an early lead through [[Christian Vieri]], and Norway rarely threatened the solid Italian defence &ndash; and just like in 1938, Norway were knocked out of the World Cup by Italy. This loss also ended Norway's undefeated run of 17 matches, a record for the team. After the tournament, Egil Olsen stepped down as national team coach and was replaced by his assistant [[Nils Johan Semb]].\n\n==2000s==\nSemb's style of play was roughly the same as his predecessor's, although new players like [[Steffen Iversen]], [[John Carew]] and [[John Arne Riise]] were added. After a slow start to the [[UEFA Euro 2000]] qualifying campaign, Norway won their last seven games and reached the European Championship finals for the first time in their history. The finals started well, but ended with disappointment. In the opener, Norway got a deserved win against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] through Steffen Iversen's goal. In the second match, Norway played poorly and lost 1\u20130 against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], but Norway would still qualify for the second round if they could win their last group match against [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]]. A draw would also be good enough if the match between Spain and Yugoslavia ended with a draw or a Yugoslavia win.\n\nIn what must be described as an awful match, the game between Norway and Slovenia ended goalless. In the other match, Yugoslavia had a 3\u20132 lead after 90 minutes, which would be enough for Norway to advance. However, when Spain scored twice in stoppage time to win the game, Norway were knocked out. After the tournament, Semb had to suffer a lot of criticism for his tactics.\n\nA slow start to the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] qualifiers did not stop the criticism. After five games, Norway had gained only two points, and after a decade of glory, it became clear that Norway would not reach the finals in [[South Korea|Korea]] and [[Japan]]. Norway did finish the qualifying campaign with two wins, but it was too little, too late.\n\nDespite the ever-increasing criticism, Semb remained in charge for the [[UEFA Euro 2004]] [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying|qualifiers]], where Norway eventually finished second behind [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], and faced a two-leg playoff against Spain. In the away leg, Norway got a respectable 2\u20131 defeat, which provided some cautious optimism before the return leg at Ullevaal. However, the return leg was a nightmare for the Norwegians. Spain dominated the game completely and won 3\u20130. After this match, Semb resigned.\n\nNorway's next national coach became former national team hero [[\u00c5ge Hareide]], who was hired in January 2004, having coached [[Rosenborg BK]] to the domestic league title the previous season. The team, which was dubbed \"New Norway\", won their first six games, although it must be said that many of these games were against second-rate opposition. In the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifying]] campaign, results have been varying &ndash; ranging from an impressive 3\u20130 win against Slovenia to a disappointing home defeat against Scotland. Norway eventually finished second behind Italy, and played the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] in a playoff to reach the finals. In the first playoff match the Czech Republic won 1\u20130 in Oslo. Norway lost the match 0\u20131 in [[Prague]] on 16 November 2005, thus failing to make it to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nIn the [[UEFA Euro 2008]] [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying|qualifiers]] Norway was drawn in a group with [[Greece national football team|Greece]], [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]], and [[Malta national football team|Malta]].\n\nOn 16 August 2006, Norway faced Brazil in a friendly match at Ullevaal Stadium. The game ended 1\u20131, and Norway remained unbeaten by the Brazilians.\n\nA successful start to the [[UEFA Euro 2008]] [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying|qualifiers]] followed, breaking a run of eight games without victory, as Norway won 4\u20131 in Hungary, their largest away win in a qualifier since October 2001,<ref>[http://rsssf.no/2001/National.html Norwegian national team 2001] from RSSSF, retrieved 6 September 2001</ref> after a string of \"amateurish mistakes\" by the hosts.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/soccer/09/02/bc.eu.spt.soc.hungary.norway.ap/ Solskjaer, Norway roll past Hungary], from Associated Press, retrieved 6 September 2006</ref> It was followed by another victory, against Moldova, but after that, Norway scored only one point in the next three qualifying matches. The team improved with two home ground 4\u20130 wins in a row (against Hungary and Malta). They also showed great shape by beating Argentina 2\u20131 in a friendly match at Ullevaal. Then they got a 1\u20130 victory in Moldova before drawing 2\u20132 with Greece, in a match Norway had the upper hand. Norway then played away to Bosnia and Hercegovina, winning 2\u20130 without really impressing. This gave Norway a very good chance of qualification if they won their following game against Turkey. However, Norway lost 1\u20132 after a poor performance, and were eliminated in the final round of qualification, with Turkey securing their place with a victory against Bosnia and Hercegovina.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/standings/index.html |title=UEFA EURO 2008 \u2013 Standings |accessdate=2007-09-13 |work=[http://www.uefa.com uefa.com] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824172127/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/standings/index.html |archivedate=2007-08-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nNorway competed against [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]] and [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] in Group 9 of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers]] in Europe,<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7109776.stm |title= 2010 World Cup qualifying draw \u2013 Europe|accessdate=2007-11-25 |work= [http://news.bbc.co.uk news.bbc.co.uk] | date=25 November 2007}}</ref> considered by many to be the weakest of the 9 groups due to Norway's poor play in recent matches.

However, Norway would tie with Macedonia 0\u20130 on June 6 and suffered a 2\u20130 defeat against Holland. As it looked all over for Norway to the Norwegian media and fans, Norway defeated Scotland 4\u20130. Goals from [[John Arne Riise]], 2 of them from [[Morten Gamst Pedersen]], and another from [[Erik Huseklepp]] kept their chances alive. However, a 1\u20131 tie with Iceland slowed down Norway. [[John Arne Riise]] scored early in the game, but [[Ei\u00f0ur Gu\u00f0johnsen]] equalized. Scotland defeated Macedonia 2\u20130. Now needing the Netherlands to win against Scotland, and needing to beat Macedonia, Norway defeated Macedonia 2\u20131 with goals from [[Thorstein Helstad]] and [[John Arne Riise]] early in the match. While at Hampden Park, [[Eljero Elia]] scored the winner for the Netherlands to eliminate Scotland and give Norway second. However, due to Norway having the weakest record of all the nine runners-up they failed to qualify for the World Cup play-offs.\n\n==2010s==\nIn November 2009, it was announced that Egil Olsen would manage the national team until the end of [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying]]. [[St\u00e5le Solbakken]], who managed [[F.C.

Olsen was replaced by [[Per-Mathias H\u00f8gmo]] after the 2\u20130 defeat at home to Switzerland, but Norway dropped out of play-off contention after the following match, a 3\u20130 defeat at [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]]. H\u00f8gmo continued to manage Norway for [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]]. They finished third in their qualifying group and entered a two-legged play-off against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], but lost 3\u20131 on aggregate. Former Sweden and Iceland coach [[Lars Lagerb\u00e4ck]] took charge in the middle of [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2018 World Cup qualifying]].

Olsen started his training career with Norway with a 6\u20131 home victory against surprise 1990 quarter-finalists [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] on 31 October 1990 and ended it on 27 June 1998 after a 0\u20131 defeat against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the second stage of the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nIn the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] in the United States, Norway was knocked out at the group stage after a win against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], a defeat against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and a draw against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]. In [[1998 FIFA World Cup|France 1998]], Norway was eliminated by Italy in the first round of the knock out stage after finishing second in their group, having drawn against [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and won 2\u20131 against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. \n\nThe former under-21 coach [[Nils Johan Semb]] replaced Olsen after the planned retirement of the latter, but did not manage to achieve the same results as Olsen. He was replaced by [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]] coach [[\u00c5ge Hareide]] at the end of 2003.\n\nSome of Norway's best single results are: Norway\u2013[[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] 2\u20131 on 23 June 1998 in the World Cup group stage, and Norway\u2013Brazil 4\u20132 on 30 May 1997. In fact, Norway is the only team in the world who has played [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and never lost, winning two matches and drawing on two other occasions.\n\n==Early history==\n[[Association football]] came to Norway from [[Great Britain]] in the 1880s, and quickly became popular both in terms of active players and as a spectator sport. Norway's first football club, Christiania FC was founded in 1885. The oldest club still in existence is [[Odd Grenland]], formed in 1894. In the following years, several more clubs were formed, and in 1902 the [[Football Association of Norway]] was formed. Later that year, the inaugural [[Norwegian Football Cup]] was held. However, it wasn't until 1908, at the invitation of the Swedish FA, that a national team was put together.\n\n==The first international match==\nNorway's first-ever international game was played on 12 July 1908 in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]].<ref name=\"RSSF1908\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.no/1908/National.html |title=Norwegian national team 1908 |accessdate=2007-11-11 |last=Aarhus |first=Lars |work=RSSF}}</ref> This was also [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]'s first-ever international match. It was decided that Oslo club Mercantile FK, who were the reigning [[Norwegian football cup|Norwegian champions]], should represent Norway in this match.<ref name=\"bestiverden\">{{cite book |author1=Aune, Thomas |author2=Schau, Aleksander |title= Vi er best i verden |year=2010 |publisher=[[Gyldendal Norsk Forlag]] |location=[[Oslo]] |isbn=978-82-05-40134-1 |pages=34 |language=no}}</ref> However, some of the players from the 1907 team were injured or otherwise unable to travel, so a couple of players from other clubs had to be called up as replacements.

Gran would later become famous as an aviator and polar explorer.<ref name=\"bestiverden\"/> The Norway team also included Paul Hauman, a Belgian engineer who was working in Norway at the time. Because he played for Mercantile, and because there were no clear international eligibility rules at the time, Hauman was able to play for Norway in this match despite being a citizen of [[Belgium]]. To this day, Hauman remains the only player who has played for the Norway team without holding a Norwegian passport.<ref name=\"bestiverden\"/>\n\nThe match started off good for the Norwegians. Within the first minute, [[:no:Minotti B\u00f8hn|Minotti B\u00f8hn]] scored the first goal of the game, but then Sweden took over and scored the next five goals before Hans Endrerud reduced the deficit right before half-time. Sweden continued to run rampant in the second half, and Norway's only consolation was a second goal from B\u00f8hn. When the referee blew the final whistle, Sweden had won by a score of 11\u20133.<ref name=\"oppslagsbok324\"/><ref name=\"1908matchreport\"/>\n\nA popular anecdote from this match is the story of Tryggve Gran literally fighting for the flag. At the time of the match, only three years had passed since [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|Norway's independence from Sweden]], and there was still bitterness about the dissolution of the union on both sides of the border. Near the end of the match, some Swedish spectators mockingly lowered the Norwegian flag at the stadium to [[half mast]], which Gran took as a great insult. While the match was still being played, he walked off the pitch to the flagpole to raise the flag back to the top.<ref name=\"bestiverden\"/>\n\n==1910s==\nAfter the heavy defeat against Sweden, it would take two years until the next time a Norwegian national side was put together. Once again, the Swedes were the opposition, and this time it was the Norwegians who held the home-field advantage. It was, however, the Swedes who won the match. This time, the final score was 4\u20130. Norway also went home with two straight defeats when they participated in the [[Stockholm]] [[Football at the 1912 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] of [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912]]. The opponents were [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and [[Austria national football team|Austria]].\n\nOverall, the period between 1908 and 1917 is a sorry chapter in the Norwegian national team's history. In those nine years, Norway failed to win a single game. Rock bottom was reached on 7 October 1917 when Norway were routed 12\u20130 against Denmark. To this date, this is Norway's heaviest ever defeat.<ref name=\"oppslagsbok327\">{{cite book |editor= Bertelsen, Ingvald|others= Berglund, Tom Harald and Odden, Iver|title= Oppslagsbok om norsk fotball |type= paperback |year=2000 |publisher=[[Wagner & Flust Forlag]] |location=[[Oslo]] |isbn=82-92228-00-4 |pages=327 |language=no}}</ref>\n\nNear the end of the decade, things began to improve. A new national team coach was hired in 1918. His name was Birger M\u00f6ller, and he was Swedish. M\u00f6ller is said to have been an excellent motivator, and spent a lot of time practicing team play and technical skills &ndash; and good results followed. On 16 June 1918, after 27 straight games without a win, Norway avenged the embarrassing defeat in [[Copenhagen]] the year before by winning 3\u20131 against Denmark in [[Oslo]] to record its first-ever victory. A few months later, Norway defeated arch-rivals Sweden by a score of 5\u20131 in Gothenburg, which was Norway's first-ever away victory.\n\n==1920s==\n[[File:Norway national football team 1921.jpg|thumb|The Norway team at the 1920 Olympics.]]\nNorway's biggest star in the 1920s was unquestionably [[Einar Gundersen|Einar \"Jeja\" Gundersen]], who scored a total of 26 international goals between 1917 and 1928. Other stars at the time were team captain [[Gunnar Andersen]] ([[FK Lyn|Lyn]]), [[Per Skou]] (Lyn and [[Odd Grenland|Odd]]) and [[Asbj\u00f8rn Halvorsen]] ([[Sarpsborg FK|Sarpsborg]]). These players formed the core of the side that participated in the [[Football at the 1912 Summer Olympics|1920 Olympics]] in [[Antwerp]], where Norway got their greatest win to that date.\n\nIn the opening match of the [[1912 Summer Olympics|Olympic tournament]], Norway faced pre-tournament favorites [[England national football team|England]]. It may have been an amateur side, but England was nevertheless the home of football, and the team was expected to ease past Norway. It is said that Gunnar Andersen was the first to show that the English players were not supermen, by dribbling past several players. His confidence passed on to the other Norwegian players, and when the smoke cleared, Norway had won 3\u20131 courtesy of two goals by \"Jeja\" Gundersen and one goal by [[Einar Wilhelms]].\n\nIn the next round, Norway faced [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], but there was to be no repeat of the sensational win against England. The Czechoslovakians won the game 4\u20130.\n\nNorway claimed a few more scalps in the following years, including a 2\u20130 win against [[France national football team|France]] in [[Paris]] in 1923, as well as a few more wins against arch-rivals Sweden. However, in the latter half of the 1920s, the golden era was over. Between 1924 and 1928, Norway won only four matches &ndash; all of them against [[Finland national football team|Finland]].\n\nThe bad spell began to end near the turn of the decade, largely thanks to new star players like goalkeeper [[Henry Johansen|Henry \"Tippen\" Johansen]] and striker [[J\u00f8rgen Juve]], who is Norway's all-time leading scorer on international level with 33 goals. On 23 June 1929, Juve scored twice as Norway defeated Denmark by a score of 5\u20132 in Copenhagen. It was Norway's first-ever away win against Denmark.\n\n==1930s==\nIn 1933, [[Viking FK|Viking]]'s brilliant inside-forward [[Reidar Kvammen]] made his international debut. Two years later, Lyn's wing wizard [[Arne Brustad]] made his debut. Furthermore, in 1934, former national team hero [[Asbj\u00f8rn Halvorsen]] returned home after 12 years in Germany. These events mark the start of what is known as Norwegian football's \"Bronze Age\".\n\nWhen Halvorsen returned from Germany, he was hired as general secretary of the NFF, and thus also became chairman of the national team's selection committee. At the time, team selection was handled by the selection committee, while the coach's sole responsibility was training the players the selection committee had picked. However, Halvorsen also named himself team coach, and thus became Norway's first \"modern\" national team manager.\n\nNorway had gotten several good results leading up to the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Berlin Olympics]], including wins against [[Austria national football team|Austria]] and [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]. Even so, few people believed Norway would stand a chance in the Olympic tournament, especially since they were scheduled to face the host nation in the second round (if they could get past [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] in the opener). The match against Turkey went easier than expected, as Norway won 4\u20130. The next match was against the [[Germany national football team|Germans]], who had demolished [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] 9\u20130 in their opener. It is said that the [[Norwegians]] were so sure of defeat that they had booked return tickets to Norway two days after the Germany game. If this is true, the travel arrangements would have had to be altered.\n\nIn front of a capacity crowd that included [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]], Norway got a fully deserved 2\u20130 win against the hosts. Both goals were scored by [[Magnar Isaksen]], and the win meant that Germany were knocked out and Norway advanced to the semi-finals, where they faced [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. The match against Italy was a closely contested one, but the Italians eventually won the game 2\u20131 after extra time. Arne Brustad scored the Norwegian goal. Next up was the third-place match against [[Poland national football team|Poland]], where Brustad scored a hat-trick and guided Norway to a 3\u20132 victory. Norway had won the bronze medals, and Brustad was hailed as one of the best players of the tournament.\n\nTwo years later, Norway took part in their first [[FIFA World Cup]]. Norway had qualified after defeating the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] by an aggregate score of 6\u20135. Reidar Kvammen was the big hero, having scored twice in both matches. The [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup]] was a straight knockout tournament, and in the opening round, Norway were drawn against defending world champions Italy.\n\nThe match, which was played in [[Marseille]], was very tight and exciting. Italy took an early lead, but Norway equalised seven minuted before the final whistle, when Brustad ran past the entire Italian defence and slotted the ball past the keeper. A few minutes later, everyone believed that Brustad had added his second, but this goal was disallowed because of a highly disputed offside call. So, just like in the Olympic tournament two years earlier, the game went to extra time &ndash; and once again, the Italians came out on top thanks to a goal by [[Silvio Piola]]. And just like in the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]], Italy went on to win the entire tournament. There was a small consolation for Brustad later that year, when he was picked in the \"Rest of Europe XI\" that played against England at Wembley.\n\nOn 22 October 1939, Norway lost 4\u20131 against Denmark in Copenhagen. This would turn out to become Norway's last international match for nearly six years.\n\n==1940s==\nWhen Norway was invaded by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in 1940, practically all organized football operations were ceased. Asbj\u00f8rn Halvorsen was among the figureheads of the sports boycott, and was arrested and sent to a [[internment#Concentration camp|concentration camp]]. Many other sports figures, including Reidar Kvammen, were also put in concentration camps. Although many players tried to keep fit, and a few illegal matches were organized, the six-year hiatus set Norwegian football back by several years &ndash; which became painstakingly evident in the first post-war game against Sweden in Stockholm on 21 October 1945.\n\nMany of the old heroes were in the side that faced Sweden that day. Brustad, [[\u00d8ivind Holmsen]] and [[Alf Martinsen|Alf \"Kaka\" Martinsen]] had played for the \"Bronze Team\", while [[Kristian Henriksen]], [[Knut Brynildsen]] and [[Rolf Johannessen]] had played in the 1938 World Cup. However, six years is a long time in football, and the Swedes, who had not been involved in [[World War II|the war]], had a great side in the making, and won the game by a score of 10\u20130. When Sweden scored their ninth goal, team joker Kristian Henriksen reportedly told his teammates, ''\"OK lads, lets go for a draw\"''. The Bronze Age was over.\n\nEventually, new players were added to the team towards the end of the 1940s. Two of the biggest names were striker [[Gunnar Thoresen (footballer)|Gunnar Thoresen]] and defender [[Thorbj\u00f8rn Svenssen]], who was nicknamed \"Klippen\" (''\"The Rock\"''). Also, Bronze Team hero Reidar Kvammen still had some skills remaining in his feet and became the first Norwegian to reach 50 caps in 1948. Although the team was nowhere near the levels of the pre-war side, they did notch up a few big wins. In 1946, [[Finland national football team|Finland]] were routed by a score of 12\u20130, and two years later, Norway won 11\u20130 against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] in a match where [[Odd Wang S\u00f8rensen]] scored five goals &ndash; which to this day is the team record for most goals scored by one player in a single game.\n\nIn 1949, an 18-year-old inside-forward from \u00d8rn-Horten named [[Per Bredesen]] made his international debut. He scored in his debut and received rave reviews. Norway had uncovered a new star, and as Norway entered the 1950s, people believed Norway had a new great side in the making. Unfortunately, young Bredesen's national team career was short-lived. In 1952, Bredesen was signed a professional contract with Italian giants [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] &ndash; and according to the NFF's self-imposed amateur rules, he was banished from the national team. In an age where most countries in [[western Europe]] had introduced professional football, the old amateur ideals of the 19th century were still the rule in Norway.\n\n==1950s==\nVictories were few and far between for the Norwegian national side in the 1950s, and the few games Norway actually did manage to win were usually against fellow minnows Finland and [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]]. Norway did manage a sensational 2\u20131 win against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in a [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] qualifier, but other than that, there were few highlights. In the return game against the Hungarians, Norway were beaten 5\u20130.\n\nThorbj\u00f8rn Svenssen remained a mainstay in Norway's central defence throughout the decade, and when he finally bowed down in 1962, he had played an amazing 104 full internationals. At the time, he was only the second footballer in history to reach a [[List of football (soccer) players with 100 or more caps|century of caps]] (the first was England captain [[Billy Wright (footballer born 1924)|Billy Wright]]). Another national team star at the time was striker [[Harald Hennum]], whose 25 international goals is a post-war record.\n\nNobody knows what Norway might have achieved if Per Bredesen had been available, but the amateur rules were still in force, even though they were somewhat relaxed in 1960 to allow another Italian exile, [[Ragnar Larsen]], who had recently returned home, to once again play for his country.\n\nIn 1959, Norway finished the year with four straight defeats and 22 conceded goals.\n\n==1960s==\nFollowing the dismal end to the last year, Austrian [[Wilhelm Kment]] was hired as new national team coach in 1960. Another newcomer was a 17-year-old winger from [[SK Brann|Brann]] named [[Roald Jensen]], but became known only by his nickname \"''Kniksen''\". The slightly built teenager was a wizard with the ball, and suddenly, Norway had a new star \u2013 and new-found optimism. Another talented youngster, attacking midfielder [[Olav Nilsen]] made his debut a couple of years later. Nilsen would be a mainstay in the side throughout the decade. \"Kniksen\" on the other hand, went abroad just like Per Bredesen before him, and thus became disqualified from further national team play.\n\nThere was little improvement to be found in the results column, but once in a while, Norway pulled off a shock result. They won against Sweden and [[Netherlands national football team|Holland]] in 1962, and defeated [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] by a score of 4\u20133 in 1963. However, this fine win was followed by a 9\u20130 defeat against [[Poland national football team|Poland]], just to confirm that despite the occasional victory, Norway were still among the bottom-feeders of European football.\n\nIn the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] qualifiers, Norway emerged as serious contenders for qualification for the first time in three decades. Though the home-based amateur only rule was retained, Norway boasted a promising side including Finn Seemann, Harald Berg, Olav Nilsen and Egil Olsen. All told, they finished runners up behind [[France national football team|France]] with 7 points (3 wins, 1 draw and 2 defeats) with two narrow defeats by France proving costly.\n\nOne of Norway's most shocking results in the 1960s was the victory against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] in a [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] qualifier. The Yugoslavs had finished second in the [[1960 European Nations' Cup|1960 European Championship]] a few years earlier, and was rated as one of the continent's top sides &ndash; but they had to travel home from Ullevaal with a 3\u20130 defeat in their bags thanks to goals from [[Finn Seemann]], [[Odd Iversen]] and the new star player from northern Norway, [[Harald Berg|Harald \"Dutte\" Berg]]. Norway also played well against [[France national football team|France]] in this qualifying campaign, but both matches ended with narrow defeats. This was nevertheless the closest Norway had come to reaching a major tournament since the glory days of the 1930s.\n\nNorway once again faced France in the qualifying tournament for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]]. The home match ended with a rather predictable 3\u20131 defeat, but in the first leg in [[Strasbourg]], Norway had pulled off another shock result and won the game 1\u20130. [[Odd Iversen]] scored the only goal of the game. France never recovered and were eventually eliminated by Sweden.\n\nAmong the other notable facts, it might be mentioned that [[Fredrikstad FK|Fredrikstad]] defender [[Roar Johansen (footballer)|Roar Johansen]] played 54 consecutive internationals between 1960 and 1967. Not even Thorbj\u00f8rn Svenssen managed a streak like that. Another piece of trivia was that goalkeeper [[Kjell Kaspersen]] scored on a penalty in the 7\u20130 friendly win against [[Thailand national football team|Thailand]] in 1965. This makes Kaspersen the only goalkeeper to have scored for the Norwegian national side.\n\n==1970s==\nIn 1969, the self-imposed amateur rule was finally abolished, and foreign-based professionals like \"Kniksen\" and Finn Seemann could once again play with the flag on their chest. It also meant that domestic stars like Odd Iversen and Harald Berg could move abroad without jeopardizing their national team eligibility.\n\nHowever, the rule change did not improve the results. If anything, the national team's results in the early 1970s got even worse. During the [[UEFA Euro 1972]] qualifying campaign, Norway picked up only one point in six games, and in a [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] qualifier against Holland, Norway lost 9\u20130. The next year, they suffered a perhaps even more humiliating result by losing against [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]].\n\nThere were, however, a few bright spots. A new star emerged in the form of [[Tom Lund]], who made his international debut in 1971. A playmaker in the [[Johan Cruyff]] mold, \"Tommy\" was without question a great player. Many consider him to be the Norway's finest player ever, but even he couldn't carry the team on his own, and Norway continued to finish last in their [[FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA European Football Championship|UEFA European Championship]] qualifying groups.\n\nIn the late 1970s, however, there were signs of improvement. Guided by Tom Lund and new head coach [[Tor R\u00f8ste Fossen]], Norway defeated both Sweden and [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in the qualifying campaign for the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]]. The win against Sweden was somewhat marred by [[Svein Gr\u00f8ndalen]]'s vicious tackle on Swedish star player [[Ralf Edstr\u00f6m]], but when Norway played their last World Cup qualifier away against Switzerland, they still had a theoretical chance of reaching the finals. However, the game ended with a 1\u20130 defeat, and Norway once again had to stay home.\n\nIn addition to the \"A\" team, Norway also fielded an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] side in the late 1970s. To play for the Olympic side, you had to be an amateur, and not have played any World Cup qualifiers. The Olympic side was, in other words, a \"B\" side, but their matches are nonetheless regarded as full internationals by the NFF (but not recognized by [[FIFA]]). The Olympic team got quite good results, and in 1979, they qualified for the [[Moscow]] [[1980 Summer Olympics|Games]] after beating Finland and [[Germany national football team|West Germany]]'s amateur side in the qualifiers. [[Arne Larsen \u00d8kland]] became the hero with the winning goal against the Germans. Incidentally, \u00d8kland became a professional in the [[Fu\u00dfball-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] shortly afterwards.\n\nThe Olympic side never got the chance to play in the Olympics, because Norway [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycotted]] the games along with the United States and most of the Western European countries as a protest against the Soviet invasion of [[Afghanistan]].\n\n==1980s==\nThe 1980s got off to a promising start for Norway with a victory against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]]. The good run continued with a 6\u20131 win against Finland (a game where [[P\u00e5l Jacobsen]] scored four goals) and victory against Switzerland in a World Cup qualifier. Even a 4\u20130 loss against [[England national football team|England]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] did not kill the optimism, because after all, England were one of the best teams in the world &ndash; at least in the eyes of the Norwegian public.\n\nNarrow defeats against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] and [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in the spring of 1981 ensured that Norway once again failed to reach the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|World Cup finals]], but they still had pride to play for when England entered [[Ullevaal Stadion|Ullevaal]] on 9 September 1981. Norway's previous five encounters against England's full-time pros had all ended with heavy defeats and a combined goal difference of 2\u201324. Few people believed that trend was about to end that day. The most optimistic pundits hoped for a narrow defeat. In this game, Norway had Tom Lund and the new star [[Hallvar Thoresen]] back in the side. Both had missed the match at Wembley the year before.\n\nThe match started badly for Norway. England got off to an early lead through [[Bryan Robson]], but Norway clawed their way back into the game, and midway through the first half, Norway got an equaliser from a Tom Lund cross. The goal was awarded to [[Roger Albertsen]], but television replays have later shown that Albertsen did in fact not touch the ball, and Lund's cross went straight into the net. When Hallvar Thoresen added a second shortly before half time, the shock was in the making. Despite a heavy English pressure in the second half, Norway held on, and had achieved (in the eyes of the Norwegian media) their greatest result ever. It was after this game that radio commentator [[Bj\u00f8rge Lillelien]] gave his famous \"Your boys took a hell of a beating\" routine.\n\nLed by Tom Lund, Norway had a fairly good team in the early 1980s. In 1982, Norway beat [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] 3\u20131 in a [[UEFA Euro 1984]] qualifier with goals by Lund, \u00d8kland and [[\u00c5ge Hareide]]. At the halfway mark, Norway looked to have a good chance of reaching the European Championship. However, Tom Lund retired at the end of the 1982 season, and without their playmaker, Norway was once again a mediocrity and gained only one point in the remaining Euro qualifiers, and once again finished last in the group.\n\nThe Olympic team was also put back together, this time to qualify for the Los Angeles Olympics. Norway only finished third in the group, behind [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and the [[East Germany national football team|GDR]] &ndash; but when the [[Eastern Bloc]] later decided to boycott the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]], Norway were handed the vacant spot. In the finals, Norway gave a pretty good performance. The opening game against [[Chile national football team|Chile]] finished goalless, and the second game against [[France national football team|France]] finished with a narrow defeat, which meant that the 2\u20130 victory in the final game against [[Qatar national football team|Qatar]] was to no avail. Norway were knocked out in the group stage. On the bright side, the Olympic team included several players who would become mainstays in the \"A\" team in the following years, such as [[Per Egil Ahlsen]], [[Terje Kojedal]], [[Tom Sundby]] and last but not least goalkeeper [[Erik Thorstvedt]].\n\nThe team got a few more scalps in the mid-1980s. In 1985, Norway won 2\u20131 away against defending world champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]], and the next spring, future world champions [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] were defeated 1\u20130 at Ullevaal. However, both these matches were friendlies, and in the games that really mattered, Norway were still also-rans. A few weeks after the win against Italy, Norway lost 5\u20131 at home to Denmark in a [[1986 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifier. In short, Norway in the 1980s was a team that could beat anyone on a given day, but they could also lose against anyone on a given day &ndash; and there were a lot more bad days than good days.\n\n==1990s==\nIn October 1990, national team coach [[Ingvar Stadheim]] resigned after a bad start to the Euro 92 qualifying campaign. His replacement was U21 coach [[Egil Olsen|Egil \"Drillo\" Olsen]], and this coaching change would signal the start of Norway's best period in modern times. Olsen's style of play may not always have been pretty to watch, and got a lot of criticism both at home and abroad, but the style got results.\n\nIn terms of individual players, Norway in the early 1990s was probably not the best team in their history. Only defender [[Rune Bratseth]] and goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt were regarded as true stars on the international level. These two formed the backbone of a side that otherwise included youngsters like [[\u00d8yvind Leonhardsen]], [[Stig Inge Bj\u00f8rnebye]], [[Lars Bohinen]] and [[Erik Mykland]].\n\nThe first indication that Norway had a great team in the making came in the Euro qualifier against Italy on 5 June 1991, where goals from Bohinen and [[Tore Andr\u00e9 Dahlum]] led the side to a 2\u20131 win. Earlier that night, the Norwegian U21 side had defeated the Italian youngsters 6\u20130. Norway failed to reach the [[UEFA Euro 1992|European Championship]] finals, but they remained in contention until the very last game, and finished a respectable third behind [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] and Italy.\n\nTowards the end of the Euro qualifiers, Olsen recalled former youth prodigy [[Kjetil Rekdal]], who had been out of the national team for more than two years after a failed spell in the Bundesliga. As the midfield anchorman, Rekdal would become one of the team's most important players throughout the 1990s.\n\nIn the qualifying tournament for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], Norway were drawn in the same group as [[England national football team|England]], [[Netherlands national football team|Holland]] and [[Poland national football team|Poland]]. Getting to the World Cup from this group was impossible, according to the pundits, but Olsen had other ideas. The qualifying campaign got off to a great start with a 10\u20130 win against minnows [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]]. This match was followed by a surprising win against Holland, and when Norway managed a draw in the away game against England through Kjetil Rekdal's 35-yard screamer, the Norwegian public were starting to believe that the national team might actually reach the finals.\n\nThe road to the World Cup continued in 1993, when Norway won 3\u20131 against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], followed by a great 2\u20130 win against England and a somewhat fortunate goalless draw against Holland in Rotterdam. The World Cup tickets were secured on October 13, when Norway defeated Poland by 3\u20130 in [[Pozna\u0144]] after goals by [[Jostein Flo]], [[Jan \u00c5ge Fj\u00f8rtoft]] and [[Ronny Johnsen]].  A 2-1 defeat by Turkey in their next match meant nothing: Norway had reached the World Cup finals for the first time since 1938. In October 1993, Norway had managed the amazing feat of being ranked the second best team in the world (behind Brazil) on the [[FIFA World Rankings]].\n\nThe finals were somewhat of a disappointment for the Norwegian team. The tournament got off to a fine start with a win against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] in a match that won't go down in history as a classic. Substitute Kjetil Rekdal scored a late winner. This match was followed by a 0\u20131, 11\u201310 men defeat against Italy, and after two games, all four teams in the group had collected three points. This meant that Norway would progress to the next round with a win against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]. They would also progress with a draw if the match between Italy and Mexico got a winner. The match against Ireland ended in a disappointing goalless draw &ndash; and since the Italy v Mexico game also ended with a draw, Norway were knocked out by the slimmest of margins.\n\nNext up was the [[UEFA Euro 1996]] qualifiers. Norway looked like qualifying through most of the campaign, but stumbled in the last two games against the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] and Holland, and were knocked out. At this point, Bratseth and Thorstvedt had both retired and been replaced with [[Henning Berg]] and [[Frode Grod\u00e5s]] respectively. Two other new faces in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifying campaign for the 1998 World Cup]] were young strikers [[Tore Andr\u00e9 Flo]] and [[Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r]]. Solskj\u00e6r scored twice in the 5\u20130 win against [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]], and was later signed by [[Manchester United F.C.]]. Flo got his breakthrough on the international stage when he scored twice in the 4\u20132 friendly win against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at Ullevaal. Norway clinched the World Cup spot with a 4\u20130 win against Finland two rounds before the end of the qualifying campaign.\n\nJust like 60 years earlier, Norway had reached a [[1998 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] played in France. History would repeat itself in more ways. Just like in the last World Cup, Norway were unimpressive in the opening matches. The first two matches against [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] ended with draws, which meant that Norway faced the difficult task of beating Brazil if they were to advance to the second round.\n\n\"23 June 1998\" and [[Marseille]] will always be remembered as the date and venue of one of Norway's greatest victories. Brazil did have most of the attacking play, and when [[Bebeto]] gave the Brazilians the lead after 78 minutes, it looked like Norway were heading for another early exit. However, in a few minutes, Tore Andr\u00e9 Flo got an equalizer, and when he was pulled down in the area two minutes before the final whistle, Norway got a penalty. Kjetil Rekdal fired the penalty into the back of the net. Norway had come from behind to win against Brazil, and advanced to the second round &ndash; once again in Marseille, and once again against Italy. The game was also notable for the Flo foul leading to the penalty not being shown on FIFA's official cameras, only for a few days later footage captured by a camera operated by Swedish broadcaster [[Sveriges Television|SVT]] was released showing otherwise.\n\nThe match against the Italians was a disappointing performance from the Norwegians. Italy got an early lead through [[Christian Vieri]], and Norway rarely threatened the solid Italian defence &ndash; and just like in 1938, Norway were knocked out of the World Cup by Italy. This loss also ended Norway's undefeated run of 17 matches, a record for the team. After the tournament, Egil Olsen stepped down as national team coach and was replaced by his assistant [[Nils Johan Semb]].\n\n==2000s==\nSemb's style of play was roughly the same as his predecessor's, although new players like [[Steffen Iversen]], [[John Carew]] and [[John Arne Riise]] were added. After a slow start to the [[UEFA Euro 2000]] qualifying campaign, Norway won their last seven games and reached the European Championship finals for the first time in their history. The finals started well, but ended with disappointment. In the opener, Norway got a deserved win against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] through Steffen Iversen's goal. In the second match, Norway played poorly and lost 1\u20130 against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], but Norway would still qualify for the second round if they could win their last group match against [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]]. A draw would also be good enough if the match between Spain and Yugoslavia ended with a draw or a Yugoslavia win.\n\nIn what must be described as an awful match, the game between Norway and Slovenia ended goalless. In the other match, Yugoslavia had a 3\u20132 lead after 90 minutes, which would be enough for Norway to advance. However, when Spain scored twice in stoppage time to win the game, Norway were knocked out. After the tournament, Semb had to suffer a lot of criticism for his tactics.\n\nA slow start to the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] qualifiers did not stop the criticism. After five games, Norway had gained only two points, and after a decade of glory, it became clear that Norway would not reach the finals in [[South Korea|Korea]] and [[Japan]]. Norway did finish the qualifying campaign with two wins, but it was too little, too late.\n\nDespite the ever-increasing criticism, Semb remained in charge for the [[UEFA Euro 2004]] [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying|qualifiers]], where Norway eventually finished second behind [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], and faced a two-leg playoff against Spain. In the away leg, Norway got a respectable 2\u20131 defeat, which provided some cautious optimism before the return leg at Ullevaal. However, the return leg was a nightmare for the Norwegians. Spain dominated the game completely and won 3\u20130. After this match, Semb resigned.\n\nNorway's next national coach became former national team hero [[\u00c5ge Hareide]], who was hired in January 2004, having coached [[Rosenborg BK]] to the domestic league title the previous season. The team, which was dubbed \"New Norway\", won their first six games, although it must be said that many of these games were against second-rate opposition. In the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifying]] campaign, results have been varying &ndash; ranging from an impressive 3\u20130 win against Slovenia to a disappointing home defeat against Scotland. Norway eventually finished second behind Italy, and played the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] in a playoff to reach the finals. In the first playoff match the Czech Republic won 1\u20130 in Oslo. Norway lost the match 0\u20131 in [[Prague]] on 16 November 2005, thus failing to make it to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nIn the [[UEFA Euro 2008]] [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying|qualifiers]] Norway was drawn in a group with [[Greece national football team|Greece]], [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]], and [[Malta national football team|Malta]].\n\nOn 16 August 2006, Norway faced Brazil in a friendly match at Ullevaal Stadium. The game ended 1\u20131, and Norway remained unbeaten by the Brazilians.\n\nA successful start to the [[UEFA Euro 2008]] [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying|qualifiers]] followed, breaking a run of eight games without victory, as Norway won 4\u20131 in Hungary, their largest away win in a qualifier since October 2001,<ref>[http://rsssf.no/2001/National.html Norwegian national team 2001] from RSSSF, retrieved 6 September 2001</ref> after a string of \"amateurish mistakes\" by the hosts.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/soccer/09/02/bc.eu.spt.soc.hungary.norway.ap/ Solskjaer, Norway roll past Hungary], from Associated Press, retrieved 6 September 2006</ref> It was followed by another victory, against Moldova, but after that, Norway scored only one point in the next three qualifying matches. The team improved with two home ground 4\u20130 wins in a row (against Hungary and Malta). They also showed great shape by beating Argentina 2\u20131 in a friendly match at Ullevaal. Then they got a 1\u20130 victory in Moldova before drawing 2\u20132 with Greece, in a match Norway had the upper hand. Norway then played away to Bosnia and Hercegovina, winning 2\u20130 without really impressing. This gave Norway a very good chance of qualification if they won their following game against Turkey. However, Norway lost 1\u20132 after a poor performance, and were eliminated in the final round of qualification, with Turkey securing their place with a victory against Bosnia and Hercegovina.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/standings/index.html |title=UEFA EURO 2008 \u2013 Standings |accessdate=2007-09-13 |work=[http://www.uefa.com uefa.com] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824172127/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/standings/index.html |archivedate=2007-08-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nNorway competed against [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]] and [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] in Group 9 of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers]] in Europe,<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7109776.stm |title= 2010 World Cup qualifying draw \u2013 Europe|accessdate=2007-11-25 |work= [http://news.bbc.co.uk news.bbc.co.uk] | date=25 November 2007}}</ref> considered by many to be the weakest of the 9 groups due to Norway's poor play in recent matches.

However, Norway would tie with Macedonia 0-0 on June 6 and suffered a 2-0 defeat against Holland. As it looked all over for Norway to the Norwegian media and fans, Norway defeated Scotland 4-0. Goals from [[John Arne Riise]], 2 of them from [[Morten Gamst Pedersen]], and another from [[Erik Huseklepp]] kept their chances alive. However, a 1-1 tie with Iceland slowed down Norway. [[John Arne Riise]] scored early in the game, but [[Ei\u00f0ur Gu\u00f0johnsen]] equalized. Scotland defeated Macedonia 2-0. Now needing the Netherlands to win against Scotland, and needing to beat Macedonia, Norway defeated Macedonia 2-1 with goals from [[Thorstein Helstad]] and [[John Arne Riise]] early in the match. While at Hampden Park, [[Eljero Elia]] scored the winner for the Netherlands to eliminate Scotland and give Norway second. However, due to Norway having the weakest record of all the nine runners-up they failed to qualify for the World Cup play-offs.\n\n==2010s==\nIn November 2009, it was announced that Egil Olsen would manage the national team until the end of [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying]].
