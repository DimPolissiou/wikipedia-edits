The birds are sparsely distributed through the [[South Island, New Zealand|South Island]] and [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]], although the distribution is not continuous. The nominate, and the Stewart Island robin (''P. australis rakiura'') are the two [[subspecies]]. The species is closely related to the [[North Island robin]] (formerly ''P. australis longipes'', now considered a distinct species<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Hilary C.|last2=Lambert|first2=David M.|year=2006|title=A molecular phylogeny of New Zealand's Petroica (Aves: Petroicidae) species based on mitochondrial DNA sequences|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=40|issue=3|pages=844\u2013855|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.04.012|pmid=16750641}}</ref>), and also to the extremely rare [[black robin]] (''P. traversi'') of the [[Chatham Islands]].\n\n==Description==\n\nThe South Island robin is a small passerine, 10\u201318&nbsp;cm in length and weighing around 35 g. North Island robins do resemble both females and juveniles of the South Island robins, as well as all the Stewart Island robins, which can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish between the three. The females and juveniles within a particular group of robins look similar to each other, although newly independent juveniles may not yet have the more lightly coloured breast patch.<ref name=\"ref2\">{{cite book|last=Powlesland|first=R.

Females and juveniles are greyer with more variable pale patches on their breasts and throats. Male South Island robins are dark grey, except for the distinct yellowish-white lower chest, while females and juveniles are again lighter grey with a less distinct breast. Finally, Stewart Island robins look similar to North Island robins (both males and females).<ref name=IUCN/>\n\nNew Zealand robins are relatively long-lived; life-spans of at least 14 years have been recorded in the wild.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:New Zealand Robin.jpg|thumb|left|South Island robin]]\nThe South Island robin has two subspecies: ''P. australis australis'', the nominate form, and ''P. australis rakiura'', the Stewart Island robin. These subspecies do not overlap in their distributions. The [[North Island robin]] (''P. longipes''), the [[tomtit]] (''Petroica macrocephala''), and the [[black robin]] (''Petroica traversi'') in the Chatham Islands are closely related species. ''P. traversi'' seems to be a Chatham Island derivative of ''P. australis'', although the position of the most recent common ancestor has yet to be determined.<ref name=\"ref1\"/> The family [[Petroicidae]] of Australasian robins has a total of 49 species, mostly in Australia, [[New Zealand]], and [[New Guinea]].<ref>Gill, F. and D.

Doi 10.14344/IOC.ML.10.1.  http://www.worldbirdnames.org/</ref>.\n\n==Fossil record==\nThere is molecular phylogenetic evidence to suggest two waves of immigration by the Petroica genus from Australia. ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' can be traced to the first and ''P. macrocephala'' to the second wave. The evidence suggests that ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' began to diverge prior to the [[Pleistocene]] era, and that the two South Island subspecies of ''P. australis'' began to diverge after the [[Pleistocene]] era. The separation time for the former was about three million years, and only 10,000 years (i.e., postglacial) for the latter.

As they do typically remain monogamous, are non-migratory, and remain on their breeding territories year-round, a male and female in one territory will compete for food resources during non-breeding times. Competition is reduced somewhat by slightly different foraging methods; however, they will steal from their mate's cache if given the opportunity.<ref name=Powlesland/> Males do dominate females, and thus will aggressively exclude females from food, such that females will only access food sources when unattended by the males.<ref name=SteerBurns>{{cite journal|last1=Steer|first1=Jamie|last2=Burns|first2=KC|year=2008|title=Seasonal variation in male-female competition, cooperation and selfish hoarding in a monogamous songbird|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=62|issue=7|pages=1175\u20131183|doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0546-z}}</ref> During breeding season, the female is solely responsible for nest building and incubation, and the male will provide the female and the hatchlings with food.<ref name=\"ref2\"/>\n\nSouth Island robins become sexually mature between six and 12 months of age.

The birds are sparsely distributed through the [[South Island, New Zealand|South Island]] and [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]], although the distribution is not continuous. The nominate, and the Stewart Island robin (''P. australis rakiura'') are the two [[subspecies]]. The species is closely related to the [[North Island robin]] (formerly ''P. australis longipes'', now considered a distinct species<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Hilary C.|last2=Lambert|first2=David M.|year=2006|title=A molecular phylogeny of New Zealand's Petroica (Aves: Petroicidae) species based on mitochondrial DNA sequences|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=40|issue=3|pages=844\u2013855|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.04.012|pmid=16750641}}</ref>), and also to the extremely rare [[black robin]] (''P. traversi'') of the [[Chatham Islands]].\n\n==Description==\n\nThe South Island robin is a small passerine, 10\u201318&nbsp;cm in length and weighing around 35 g. North Island robins do resemble both females and juveniles of the South Island robins, as well as all the Stewart Island robins, which can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish between the three. The females and juveniles within a particular group of robins look similar to each other, although newly independent juveniles may not yet have the more lightly coloured breast patch.<ref name=\"ref2\">{{cite book|last=Powlesland|first=R.

Females and juveniles are greyer with more variable pale patches on their breasts and throats. Male South Island robins are dark grey, except for the distinct yellowish-white lower chest, while females and juveniles are again lighter grey with a less distinct breast. Finally, Stewart Island robins look similar to North Island robins (both males and females).<ref name=IUCN/>\n\nNew Zealand robins are relatively long-lived; life-spans of at least 14 years have been recorded in the wild.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:New Zealand Robin.jpg|thumb|left|South Island robin]]\nThe South Island robin has two subspecies: ''P. australis australis'', the nominate form, and ''P. australis rakiura'', the Stewart Island robin. These subspecies do not overlap in their distributions. The [[North Island robin]] (''P. longipes''), the [[tomtit]] (''Petroica macrocephala''), and the [[black robin]] (''Petroica traversi'') in the Chatham Islands are closely related species. ''P. traversi'' seems to be a Chatham Island derivative of ''P. australis'', although the position of the most recent common ancestor has yet to be determined.<ref name=\"ref1\"/> The family [[Petroicidae]] of Australasian robins has a total of 49 species, mostly in Australia, [[New Zealand]], and [[New Guinea]].<ref>Gill, F. and D.

''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' can be traced to the first and ''P. macrocephala'' to the second wave. The evidence suggests that ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' began to diverge prior to the [[Pleistocene]] era, and that the two South Island subspecies of ''P. australis'' began to diverge after the [[Pleistocene]] era. The separation time for the former was about three million years, and only 10,000 years (i.e., postglacial) for the latter.

If proven to be a leech, it would be the oldest in the fossil record.]]\nPrior to the discovery of the Waukesha Biota, very little was known about the soft-bodied animals that were sure to have lived in the Silurian seas. Thanks to the famous [[Burgess Shale]] of the [[Canadian Rockies]], we knew that the seas were already teaming with soft-bodied and lightly skeletonized animals as far back as the [[Cambrian]], yet relatively few were known to be preserved in later [[Paleozoic]] rocks. This is because the fossil record is greatly skewed toward biomineralized skeletal remains. The announcement of the Waukesha Biota in 1985 thus marked a major turning point in our knowledge of Silurian life. In his popular book, ''Wonderful Life'', [[Stephen Jay Gould]] compared the \"anatomical disparity\" of the Burgess Shale with that of only five other occurrences in the world \u2013one of which was the Waukesha Biota, which he referred to as the \"Brandon Bridge fauna\"\u2013 and none of the others were Silurian.<ref name=Gould1989>{{cite book |last=Gould  |first=S.J. |title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History |date=1989 |publisher=W.W.

If proven to be a leech, it would be the oldest in the fossil record.]]\nPrior to the discovery of the Waukesha Biota, very little was known about the soft-bodied animals that were sure to have lived in the Silurian seas. Thanks to the famous [[Burgess Shale]] of the [[Canadian Rockies]], we knew that the seas were already teaming with soft-bodied and lightly skeletonized animals as far back as the [[Cambrian]], yet relatively few were known to be preserved in later [[Paleozoic]] rocks. This is because the fossil record is greatly skewed toward biomineralized skeletal remains. The announcement of the Waukesha Biota in 1985 thus marked a major turning point in our knowledge of Silurian life. In his popular book, ''Wonderful Life'', [[Stephen Jay Gould]] compared the \"anatomical disparity\" of the Burgess Shale with that of only five other occurrences in the world \u2013one of which was the Waukesha Biota, which he referred to as the \"Brandon Bridge fauna\"\u2013 and none of the others were Silurian.<ref name=Gould1989>{{cite book |last=Gould  |first=S.J. |title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History |date=1989 |publisher=W.W.
