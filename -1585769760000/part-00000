{"title_page": "Oropom people", "text_new": "The '''Oropom''' (also known as '''Iworopom''', '''Oworopom''', '''Oyoropom''' or '''Oropoi''') were the [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|aboriginal]] inhabitants of much of [[Karamoja]] in [[Uganda]], [[Mt. Elgon]] area and [[West Pokot County|West Pokot]], [[Trans-Nzoia County|Trans Nzoia]] and [[Turkana County|Turkana]] regions in [[Kenya]]. Their descendants were largely assimilated into various communities present in their former territories, including the [[Iteso]], [[Karamojong people|Karamojong]], [[Pokot people|Pokot]], [[Turkana people|Turkana]] and [[Bukusu]]. They are or were found in scattered pockets between the [[Turkwel River]], [[Chemorongit Mountains]] and [[Mount Elgon|Mt. Elgon]]. One report indicates that they formerly spoke the unclassified [[Oropom language]].\n\n==Sources==\nThe first indication of the past existence of a people known as Oropom was through fieldwork done by J.G.Wilson in the mid-20th century. While resident in Karamoja region of Uganda, he came across widespread and abundant archaeological material including stone tools and pottery of a nature also found in Karasuk, Turkana and West Pokot districts in Kenya. Wilson noted that \"the material collected, particularly the pottery, reflects such a high degree of skill and artistry in its manufacture, that it is obviously not connected with the much cruder pots of the present occupants of these areas\". His supposition was confirmed by most residents who had no traditions indicating the manufacture of the items save for a few people who claimed to be descendants of a people known as Oropom.<ref>Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observations On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 125-126</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nAccording to Webster,<ref>J. B. Webster, \"The Iworopom settlers\", ''The Iteso during the Asonya'', Nairobi, E. A. P. H., 1973, pp. 28-40.</ref> the Oropom nursery was located near [[Mt. Moroto]], from which they moved west to the plain between [[Napak]] and [[Mount Elgon]].\n\nOropom traditions recorded by Wilson capture the extent of their ancient territories: the whole [[Turkana County|Turkana]] to a point east of [[Lake Turkana]] which the Oropom called \"Malimalte\", the [[Cherangani Hills]] eastward to [[Lake Baringo]], much of the [[Trans-Nzoia District, Kenya|Trans-Nzoia District]] - all in present-day Kenya; Mt. Elgon and all of [[Teso sub-region]] in Uganda; as well as the areas of [[Didinga]] and [[Topossa]] in [[Sudan]].\n\n==Assimilation==\n{{See also|Maliri people}}\nIt is currently assumed that the Oropom were the original inhabitants of their territory, and that successive waves of migrants invaded the territory;<ref>Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observations On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 129 [http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00080855/00054/10j online]</ref>\n\nWilson suggests that the first invaders of the Oropom territory were proto-Kalenjin speakers who may have included the Nyangea, [[Teuso language|Teuso]] and [[Tepes language|Tepes]].<ref>Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observations On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 129-130</ref>\nThey were followed by the Maliri who had occupied with certainty what are now [[Jie people|Jie country]] and large parts of [[Dodoth people|Dodoth country]] in Uganda. It is estimated that their arrival in those districts occurred 600 to 800 years ago (i.e. c.1200 to 1400 AD)<ref>Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observations On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 130</ref>\n\n==Society==\n===Appearance===\nWilson (1970) noted that some individuals living among the Karimojong and who claimed Oropom ancestry could be distinguished by their reddish brown skin, \"peppercorn hair\", slanted eyes, and prominent cheekbones. On this basis he ascribed them to the [[Khoisan]] group.\n\nIn 1970, their main mark was a custom of wearing a single [[cowrie]] shell attached to a forelock placed over the centre of the forehead (for women), or an indented mark in the centre of the forehead (for men.)\n\n===Housing===\nTraditions also captured by Wilson note that the Oropom had well-built houses of three to four rooms (unlike the Karamojong), big gardens, and long-horned cattle. They also had a reputation as good [[pottery|potters]], and pottery attributed to them is found all over the area.\n\n===Clothing===\nThe women wore skin clothing and large [[earring]]s, and did not plait their hair; the men wore nothing but a belt covering their penis, and had long pigtails. Both sexes wore many [[bangle]]s, and covered themselves in a red oil-[[ochre]] mixture.\n\n===Industry===\nWilson postulates that they had no knowledge of [[iron]] working as most of their tools and implements were [[Stone Age]].\n\n===Religion and customs===\nTheir religious rites are said to have invariably taken place at [[sunrise]], usually on rock outcrops. Some involved [[animal sacrifice]]s.  Some were reserved for elders, while others were open to all.  Ritual [[meal|feast]]s were held at [[stone circle]]s. Most accounts of the Oropom state that they did not practice circumcision as a rite of initiation .\n\n==Pokotozek - Oropom conflict==\nOral traditions indicate that the expansion of Lwoo speakers into Acholi caused the breakaway of a group who were initially known as Jie. The Jie came from the vicinity of [[Gulu]] though there was a section of the group who came from a hill known as Got Turkan. The Jie who are said to have been Luo speaking though governed by elders and not chiefs (indicating that their culture was not fully Lwoo-ised), advanced eastward and entered the present Karamoja boundary at Adilang. The territory they entered was then occupied by the Maliri who were pushed to the vicinity of Koten mountains.\n\nThe Jie from Got Turkan, now calling themselves Turkana, broke away from the main Jie populace at Kotido and advanced eastward bringing extreme pressure to bear on the Maliri at Koten causing that group to split into two. One section came to be known as Merille while the other referred to themselves as Pokotozek.<ref>Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observations On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 130-131</ref>\n\nThe Pokotozek whose movements would have greatest impact on the Oropom, moved south, arriving at Nakiloro which lies on the lip of the Turkana escarpment just north of Moroto mountain, where they stayed for a short while before moving further south, proceeding down the eastern side of the Chemorongit and Cherangani mountains before finally branching off in the direction of Lake Baringo.<ref>Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observations On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 131</ref>\n\nThis incursion disturbed Oropom who were settled around Baringo, causing a break-up of that group which led to migrations in various directions;\n\n===Turkwell===\nSome Oropom moved towards the Turkwell, both below and above Turkwell gorge.\n\n===Uasin Gishu===\nOther Oropom moved into Uasin Gishu Maasai held territory.<ref>Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observations On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 131-132</ref> According to Maasai tradition, an alliance of the Uasin Gishu and Siria communities attacked the Chemngal who then occupied the Plateau today known as Uasin Gishu.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Jennings |first=Christian |date=2005 |title=Scatterlings of East Africa: Revisions of Parakuyo Identity and History, c. 1830-1926 |type=PhD |chapter=1 |page=98 |publisher=The University of Texas at Austin | |url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/1580/jenningsc57449.pdf |access-date=August 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA Karamojong informant noted in 1916 that Nandi occupied territory previously stretched as far north as the sources of the Nzoia River i.e. Mt. Elgon, a territory that had been occupied by the Nandi as lately as the time of the grandfathers of that generation (i.e early to mid-19th century). \n\nThe Karamojong raided the northern Nandi sections twice before the Nandi launched a big raid against them at Choo hill near the junction of Kanyangareng & Turkwel rivers. The Masinko clan of Karamojong who were pasturing here counterattacked and successfully drove of the Nandi raiders.\n\nIn response to the Nandi raid, the Karimojong organized a powerful force to break up the Nandi nearest the Turkwel-Nzoia watershed but the expedition returned and reported that the Nandi had withdrawn too far south. The Karamojong were unmolested by the Nandi from that time and the Turkwel-Nzoia watershed became a no-mans land.<ref>Turpin, C., The occupation of the Turkwel river area by the Karamojong tribe, The Uganda Journal, 1916 [http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00080855/00062/55j online]</ref>\n\n===Chemorongit===\nYet others moved to the Chemorongit mountains (Karasuk) which were still part of Oropom territory, as well as the area west of there and south of Moroto mountain.\n\nThe Pokotozek finding that they were no longer facing a formidable tribal grouping to the north and west of Baringo, themselves expanded in that direction, expelling other Oropom from the Cherangani mountains and further west right up to the slopes of Mt Elgon hence limiting Turkana southern movement.<ref>Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observations On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 131-132</ref>\n\nIt is notable that the emerging Sebei referred to the Mt Elgon Oropom as Sirikwa. The Sirikwa population at Mt Elgon, as evidenced by Sirkwa holes, was fairly dense and it is likely that their identity was still largely intact. It would take the Karimojong dispersion of the Oropom at Kapcheliba in the early 18th century to finally submerge the Oropom-Sirikwa identity.<ref>Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observations On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 132</ref>\n\n==The Battle at Kacheliba==\nA notable battle that occurred around 1825<ref>Spear, T. and Waller, R. Being Maasai: Ethnicity & Identity in East Africa. James Currey Publishers, 1993, p. 90</ref> or 1830<ref>Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observations On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 132</ref> near Kacheliba is largely perceived to have signaled the snuffing out of Oropom identity. A notable element of the battle is the Oropom tying themselves together with leather ropes. Oropom descendants romanticise the encounter, noting that;\n\n''The Karimajong kept beating the Oropom and drove them further and further south. Finally the Oropom became tired of running. They began killing their cattle to make leather ropes out of their skins. They tied themselves together with those ropes so that none could run away. They said \u2018we are tired of running \u2013 it is better that we should all die here together\u2019''<ref>Spear, T. and Waller, R. Being Maasai: Ethnicity & Identity in East Africa. James Currey Publishers, 1993, p. 90</ref>\n\nThe Karimajong on the other hand provide a brutal military assessment of the encounter and the state of Oropom society at that point, they note that;\n\n''\"...Their shields were larger than ours but were ineffective as they were made of cowhide. Their spears were unlike ours, more like those of the Nandi. When we were strong enough we desired their cattle which had long horns, and we fought a great battle with them. However they were cowards and their elders had to force the young men to fight us; in doing this, they gathered them together in long lines, securing them one to the other by ropes, to prevent them running away. This was very foolish as when we killed one or two of them, the whole line collapsed with the weight of their bodies and we slaughtered them where they fell.\"''<ref>Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observations On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 133</ref>\n\nSome then fled east or south; a few Oropom settlements are claimed to have remained between Kacheliba and Karta as late as 1927.

Elgon]] area and [[West Pokot County|West Pokot]], [[Trans-Nzoia County|Trans Nzoia]] and [[Turkana County|Turkana]] regions in [[Kenya]]. Their descendants were largely assimilated into various communities present in their former territories, including the [[Iteso]], [[Karamojong people|Karamojong]], [[Pokot people|Pokot]], [[Turkana people|Turkana]] and [[Bukusu]]. They are or were found in scattered pockets between the [[Turkwel River]], [[Chemorongit Mountains]] and [[Mount Elgon|Mt. Elgon]]. One report indicates that they formerly spoke the unclassified [[Oropom language]].\n\n==Sources==\nThe first indication of the past existence of a people known as Oropom was through fieldwork done by J.G.Wilson in the mid-20th century. While resident in Karamoja region of Uganda, he came across widespread and abundant archaeological material including stone tools and pottery of a nature also found in Karasuk, Turkana and West Pokot districts in Kenya. Wilson noted that \"the material collected, particularly the pottery, reflects such a high degree of skill and artistry in its manufacture, that it is obviously not connected with the much cruder pots of the present occupants of these areas\". His supposition was confirmed by most residents who had no traditions indicating the manufacture of the items save for a few people who claimed to be descendants of a people known as Oropom.<ref>Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observations On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 125-126</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nAccording to Webster,<ref>J. B. Webster, \"The Iworopom settlers\", ''The Iteso during the Asonya'', Nairobi, E. A. P. H., 1973, pp. 28-40.</ref> the Oropom nursery was located near [[Mt. Moroto]], from which they moved west to the plain between [[Napak]] and [[Mount Elgon]].\n\nOropom traditions recorded by Wilson capture the extent of their ancient territories: the whole [[Turkana County|Turkana]] to a point east of [[Lake Turkana]] which the Oropom called \"Malimalte\", the [[Cherangani Hills]] eastward to [[Lake Baringo]], much of the [[Trans-Nzoia District, Kenya|Trans-Nzoia District]] - all in present-day Kenya; Mt. Elgon and all of [[Teso sub-region]] in Uganda; as well as the areas of [[Didinga]] and [[Topossa]] in [[Sudan]].\n\n==Assimilation==\n{{See also|Maliri people}}\nIt is currently assumed that the Oropom were the original inhabitants of their territory, and that successive waves of migrants invaded the territory;<ref>Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observations On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 129 [http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00080855/00054/10j online]</ref>\n\nWilson suggests that the first invaders of the Oropom territory were proto-Kalenjin speakers who may have included the Nyangea, [[Teuso language|Teuso]] and [[Tepes language|Tepes]].<ref>Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observations On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 129-130</ref>\nThey were followed by the Maliri who had occupied with certainty what are now [[Jie people|Jie country]] and large parts of [[Dodoth people|Dodoth country]] in Uganda. It is estimated that their arrival in those districts occurred 600 to 800 years ago (i.e. c.1200 to 1400 AD)<ref>Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observations On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 130</ref>\n\n==Society==\n===Appearance===\nWilson (1970) noted that some individuals living among the Karimojong and who claimed Oropom ancestry could be distinguished by their reddish brown skin, \"peppercorn hair\", slanted eyes, and prominent cheekbones. On this basis he ascribed them to the [[Khoisan]] group.\n\nIn 1970, their main mark was a custom of wearing a single [[cowrie]] shell attached to a forelock placed over the centre of the forehead (for women), or an indented mark in the centre of the forehead (for men.)\n\n===Housing===\nTraditions also captured by Wilson note that the Oropom had well-built houses of three to four rooms (unlike the Karamojong), big gardens, and long-horned cattle. They also had a reputation as good [[pottery|potters]], and pottery attributed to them is found all over the area.\n\n===Clothing===\nThe women wore skin clothing and large [[earring]]s, and did not plait their hair; the men wore nothing but a belt covering their penis, and had long pigtails. Both sexes wore many [[bangle]]s, and covered themselves in a red oil-[[ochre]] mixture.\n\n===Industry===\nWilson postulates that they had no knowledge of [[iron]] working as most of their tools and implements were [[Stone Age]].\n\n===Religion & customs===\nTheir religious rites are said to have invariably taken place at [[sunrise]], usually on rock outcrops. Some involved [[animal sacrifice]]s.  Some were reserved for elders, while others were open to all.  Ritual [[meal|feast]]s were held at [[stone circle]]s. Most accounts of the Oropom state that they did not practice circumcision as a rite of initiation .\n\n==Pokotozek - Oropom conflict==\nOral traditions indicate that the expansion of Lwoo speakers into Acholi caused the breakaway of a group who were initially known as Jie. The Jie came from the vicinity of [[Gulu]] though there was a section of the group who came from a hill known as Got Turkan. The Jie who are said to have been Luo speaking though governed by elders and not chiefs (indicating that their culture was not fully Lwoo-ised), advanced eastward and entered the present Karamoja boundary at Adilang. The territory they entered was then occupied by the Maliri who were pushed to the vicinity of Koten mountains.\n\nThe Jie from Got Turkan, now calling themselves Turkana, broke away from the main Jie populace at Kotido and advanced eastward bringing extreme pressure to bear on the Maliri at Koten causing that group to split into two. One section came to be known as Merille while the other referred to themselves as Pokotozek.<ref>Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observations On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 130-131</ref>\n\nThe Pokotozek whose movements would have greatest impact on the Oropom, moved south, arriving at Nakiloro which lies on the lip of the Turkana escarpment just north of Moroto mountain, where they stayed for a short while before moving further south, proceeding down the eastern side of the Chemorongit and Cherangani mountains before finally branching off in the direction of Lake Baringo.<ref>Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observations On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 131</ref>\n\nThis incursion disturbed Oropom who were settled around Baringo, causing a break-up of that group which led to migrations in various directions;\n\n===Turkwell===\nSome Oropom moved towards the Turkwell, both below and above Turkwell gorge.\n\n===Uasin Gishu===\nOther Oropom moved into Uasin Gishu Maasai held territory.<ref>Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observations On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 131-132</ref> According to Maasai tradition, an alliance of the Uasin Gishu and Siria communities attacked the Chemngal who then occupied the Plateau today known as Uasin Gishu.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Jennings |first=Christian |date=2005 |title=Scatterlings of East Africa: Revisions of Parakuyo Identity and History, c. 1830-1926 |type=PhD |chapter=1 |page=98 |publisher=The University of Texas at Austin | |url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/1580/jenningsc57449.pdf |access-date=August 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA Karamojong informant noted in 1916 that Nandi occupied territory previously stretched as far north as the sources of the Nzoia River i.e. Mt. Elgon, a territory that had been occupied by the Nandi as lately as the time of the grandfathers of that generation (i.e early to mid-19th century). \n\nThe Karamojong raided the northern Nandi sections twice before the Nandi launched a big raid against them at Choo hill near the junction of Kanyangareng & Turkwel rivers. The Masinko clan of Karamojong who were pasturing here counterattacked and successfully drove of the Nandi raiders.\n\nIn response to the Nandi raid, the Karimojong organized a powerful force to break up the Nandi nearest the Turkwel-Nzoia watershed but the expedition returned and reported that the Nandi had withdrawn too far south. The Karamojong were unmolested by the Nandi from that time and the Turkwel-Nzoia watershed became a no-mans land.<ref>Turpin, C., The occupation of the Turkwel river area by the Karamojong tribe, The Uganda Journal, 1916 [http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00080855/00062/55j online]</ref>\n\n===Chemorongit===\nYet others moved to the Chemorongit mountains (Karasuk) which were still part of Oropom territory, as well as the area west of there and south of Moroto mountain.\n\nThe Pokotozek finding that they were no longer facing a formidable tribal grouping to the north and west of Baringo, themselves expanded in that direction, expelling other Oropom from the Cherangani mountains and further west right up to the slopes of Mt Elgon hence limiting Turkana southern movement.<ref>Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observations On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 131-132</ref>\n\nIt is notable that the emerging Sebei referred to the Mt Elgon Oropom as Sirikwa. The Sirikwa population at Mt Elgon, as evidenced by Sirkwa holes, was fairly dense and it is likely that their identity was still largely intact. It would take the Karimojong dispersion of the Oropom at Kapcheliba in the early 18th century to finally submerge the Oropom-Sirikwa identity.<ref>Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observations On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 132</ref>\n\n==The Battle at Kacheliba==\nA notable battle that occurred around 1825<ref>Spear, T. and Waller, R. Being Maasai: Ethnicity & Identity in East Africa. James Currey Publishers, 1993, p. 90</ref> or 1830<ref>Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observations On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 132</ref> near Kacheliba is largely perceived to have signaled the snuffing out of Oropom identity. A notable element of the battle is the Oropom tying themselves together with leather ropes. Oropom descendants romanticise the encounter, noting that;\n\n''The Karimajong kept beating the Oropom and drove them further and further south. Finally the Oropom became tired of running. They began killing their cattle to make leather ropes out of their skins. They tied themselves together with those ropes so that none could run away. They said \u2018we are tired of running \u2013 it is better that we should all die here together\u2019''<ref>Spear, T. and Waller, R. Being Maasai: Ethnicity & Identity in East Africa. James Currey Publishers, 1993, p. 90</ref>\n\nThe Karimajong on the other hand provide a brutal military assessment of the encounter and the state of Oropom society at that point, they note that;\n\n''\"...Their shields were larger than ours but were ineffective as they were made of cowhide. Their spears were unlike ours, more like those of the Nandi. When we were strong enough we desired their cattle which had long horns, and we fought a great battle with them. However they were cowards and their elders had to force the young men to fight us; in doing this, they gathered them together in long lines, securing them one to the other by ropes, to prevent them running away.

Since the 1255 partition of the Wittelsbach territories, his father ruled over the [[Electoral Palatinate]] and [[Upper Bavaria]] with his residence at [[Alter Hof]] in Munich and [[Heidelberg Castle]], while his younger brother Duke [[Henry XIII, Duke of Bavaria|Henry XIII]] ruled over the lands of [[Lower Bavaria]].  \n\nAs the eldest surviving son, Rudolf succeeded his father as Duke of Upper Bavaria upon his death in February 1294. In September he married [[Mechtild of Nassau]], daughter of King [[Adolf, King of Germany|Adolf of Germany]], thereby continuing the marriage politics of his father. However, King Adolf dashed the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|Princes]]' expectations and in 1298 was declared deposed in favour of late King Rudolf's son and heir Duke [[Albert I of Germany|Albert of Austria]]. In the [[Battle of G\u00f6llheim]], Rudolf supported his father-in-law Adolf against his maternal uncle Albert. The Habsburg duke won the fight, while the king was killed in battle. \n\nAlbert was elected on 27 July 1298 and Rudolf then joined the Habsburg party, however, the strong dynastic policy of the new king caused led to a resurgence of the Wittelsbach dynastic conflicts. In 1301 King Albert put pressure on Rudolf to accept his ambitious younger brother [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]], the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]], as co-regent. He broke Rudolf's remaining resistance by laying siege to his [[Heidelberg]] residence in 1301. \n\nAfter Albert's assassination in 1308, both Rudolf and Louis hoped to become his successor. Nevertheless, the Princes around the mighty Archbishop of Mainz, [[Peter von Aspelt]], arranged the candidacy of the [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] count [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]]. In the election on 27 November Rudolf voted for Henry. In 1310 he accompanied the new king on his campaign to [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]]. However, he had to terminate his participation when upon the death of Duke [[Stephen I, Duke of Bavaria|Stephen I of Bavaria]] new disputes on the partition of the Wittelsbach lands and the [[Prince-elector|electoral]] dignity between Rudolf and Louis IV culminated in a civil war. \n\nFinally on 21 June 1313, peace between the brothers was made at Munich: while Rudolf retained the Electoral Palatinate, the treaty provided Louis with the opportunity to secure his election as German king when Henry of Luxembourg died on 24 August. Much to the annoyance of his brother, Louis was able to defeat his Habsburg rival [[Frederick the Fair]] at the [[Battle of Gammelsdorf]] on 9 November.  After the renunciation of Henry's son King [[John of Bohemia]], he finally was elected King of the Romans in [[Frankfurt]] on 20 October 1314 \u2013 against the vote of his envious brother Rudolf, who supported Frederick of Habsburg. \n\nIn the following throne quarrel with the Habsburgs, Rudolf was attacked by his brother in both Bavaria and the Palatinate. Put on the defensive, Rudolf in 1317 agreed to give up his rule in favour of Louis, until the conflict with the Habsburg rival was ended. According to the [[Renaissance]] historian [[Johannes Aventinus]] (1477\u20131534), Rudolf proceeded to [[Kingdom of England|England]] where he died two years later. He later received the epithet \"the Stammerer\" due to his many desperate fights against his capable younger brother.\n\nLouis IV, crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1328, by the 1329 [[Treaty of Pavia (1329)|Treaty of Pavia]] granted the Electoral Palatinate to late Rudolf's sons [[Rudolf II, Duke of Bavaria|Rudolf II the Blind]] and [[Rupert I, Elector Palatine of the Rhine|Rupert I]] and Rudolf's grandson [[Rupert II, Elector Palatine of the Rhine|Rupert II]], a son of [[Adolf, Count Palatine of the Rhine|Adolf]]. This way finally Rudolf I and his grandson Rupert II became the ancestors of the elder (Palatinate) line of the Wittelsbach dynasty, which returned to power also in Bavaria in 1777 after the extinction of the younger (Bavarian) line, the descendants of Louis IV.\n\n==Family and children==\nRudolf was married on 1 September 1294 in the [[Free Imperial City of Nuremberg]] to [[Mechtild of Nassau]], daughter of King [[Adolf, King of Germany|Adolf of Germany]].

The club competes in Group East of [[Divisi\u00f3n de Honor B de Rugby|Divisi\u00f3n de Honor B]].\n\n==History==\nThe club was established in May 1966 by a group of young players who wanted to see a team from the city of Valencia playing in the national leagues. There were problems securing a field, and the club played on a football field in [[Picanya]] and sometimes on the river banks by the teacher's training college in the early years. They acquired their own ground, the Campo de La Pechina (Field of The Pendant), the very first rugby ground in the city.\n\nThe following season a youth team was started, which won the regional championship.\n\nThe senior team reached the national leagues in 1973/1974 for the first time, and was promoted to the [[Divisi\u00f3n de Honor de Rugby|Divisi\u00f3n de Honor]] in the 1976/1977 season, winning the title in 1982/1983.\n\nIn 1990 the club gained their primary sponsor, Tecnidex, a company providing chemicals and disinfectants for agricultural purposes.\n\n==Honours==\n*'''[[Divisi\u00f3n de Honor de Rugby|Divisi\u00f3n de Honor]]:''' '''1'''\n**1983\n*'''[[Divisi\u00f3n de Honor B de Rugby|Divisi\u00f3n de Honor B]]:''' '''3'''\n**1976,
