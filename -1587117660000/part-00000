In 2018, the event gave the region a $5.2M economic boost, an estimated $1.5M up from 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/news/103315407/superstock-teams-champs-rake-in-52-million-economic-boost-for-manawat|title=Superstock Teams Champs rake in $5.2 million economic boost for Manawat\u016b|last=|first=|date=|website=Stuff|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Racing==\n\n[[Superstocks]] racing allows for full contact, hardcore racing around oval dirt tracks with concrete walls in close proximity to the outside of the track. Drivers are entitled to push one another into the infield, up the wall or into one another in the fight for victory. With no blue flags backmarker cars may wait for the lead pack and if drivers wish, may take out lead cars to best suit their team. [[Superstocks]] teams racing consists of 2 teams facing off in each race progressing through qualifying night for a chance to be in the grand final. Teams of 5 cars take part with 1 car from either team sitting out each race as a reserve car. With a total of 4 cars in the race for each team most teams use a 2:2 tactic with 2 cars attacking and going to the victory while 2 cars block the other team from taking out their attackers. Because of the all-out nature of the sport there are often many rollovers and cars up into the catch fencing, leading to red flags where cars must stop in as little distance as possible, hold position and wait until the accident is cleared and the green flag is shown once again.<ref>https://www.sporty.co.nz/asset/downloadasset?id=0c20c0f7-bb66-4d9d-9578-4258e07e8f65</ref>\n\n==Deaths==\nPeter Barry, 44, has been the only death in Superstock Teams Racing history. On 9 February 2009 he was flown to Wellington Hospital in a critical condition with severe head injury, succumbing to his injuries six days later at 6pm, February 12.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/news/1399703/Teams-tribute-to-dead-stockie|title=Team's tribute to dead stockie|last=|first=|date=|website=Stuff|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBarry was driving a block car for the Kihikihi Kings versus the Hawkes Bay Hawkeyes when he lost consciousness from multiple hits against between cars and the concrete wall, after a severe blow into the outside wall Barry lost consciousness. Barry's car continued to move slowly along the track for three quarters of a lap before a flag marshall stopped it. The coroner accepted fatalities were relatively rare in superstock racing, although the likelihood of injury was not.

The event attracts crowds of 14,000 people on each day of the event, as they are entertained by up to 14 teams, all fighting with full-contact allowed for the ultimate New Zealand speedway crown. In 2018, the event gave the region a $5.2M economic boost, an estimated $1.5M up from 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/news/103315407/superstock-teams-champs-rake-in-52-million-economic-boost-for-manawat|title=Superstock Teams Champs rake in $5.2 million economic boost for Manawat\u016b|last=|first=|date=|website=Stuff|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Racing==\n\n[[Superstocks]] racing allows for full contact, hardcore racing around oval dirt tracks with concrete walls in close proximity to the outside of the track. Drivers are entitled to push one another into the infield, up the wall or into one another in the fight for victory. With no blue flags backmarker cars may wait for the lead pack and if drivers wish, may take out lead cars to best suit their team. [[Superstocks]] teams racing consists of 2 teams facing off in each race progressing through qualifying night for a chance to be in the grand final. Teams of 5 cars take part with 1 car from either team sitting out each race as a reserve car. With a total of 4 cars in the race for each team most teams use a 2:2 tactic with 2 cars attacking and going to the victory while 2 cars block the other team from taking out their attackers. Because of the all-out nature of the sport there are often many rollovers and cars up into the catch fencing, leading to red flags where cars must stop in as little distance as possible, hold position and wait until the accident is cleared and the green flag is shown once again.<ref>https://www.sporty.co.nz/asset/downloadasset?id=0c20c0f7-bb66-4d9d-9578-4258e07e8f65</ref>\n\n==Deaths==\nPeter Barry, 44, has been the only death in Superstock Teams Racing history. On 9 February 2009 he was flown to Wellington Hospital in a critical condition with severe head injury, succumbing to his injuries six days later at 6pm, February 12.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/news/1399703/Teams-tribute-to-dead-stockie|title=Team's tribute to dead stockie|last=|first=|date=|website=Stuff|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBarry was driving a block car for the Kihikihi Kings versus the Hawkes Bay Hawkeyes when he lost consciousness from multiple hits against between cars and the concrete wall, after a severe blow into the outside wall Barry lost consciousness. Barry's car continued to move slowly along the track for three quarters of a lap before a flag marshall stopped it. The coroner accepted fatalities were relatively rare in superstock racing, although the likelihood of injury was not. It was inherently high risk and violent, especially in teams' racing, where drivers crashed into each other on purpose. The coroner raised concerns about the [[HANS]] (head and neck restraint system) device, a safety item compulsory in many [[motorsports]].

The film won two awards, including [[Filmfare Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]] for Kapoor and [[Filmfare Award for Best Background Score|Best Background Score]] for Hitesh Sonik.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe film begins with Govind \"Govi\" Patel ([[Rajkumar Rao]]) giving a presentation in a school about the services provided by his sports club. In a parallel scene, Omkar \"Omi\" Shastri ([[Amit Sadh]]) is released from prison. While halting at a restaurant mid-way, Govind and Omi recall their days back to the year 2000 with the life of their late friend Ishaan.\n\n12 years ago\n\nIshaan \"Ish\" Bhatt ([[Sushant Singh Rajput]]) is an ex-district level cricketer who is a victim of politics in the cricketing selection fraternity, Omi is the nephew of a Hindu politician, Bittu, who funds his father's temple and Govind is a geek with a penchant for business and numbers. Together they open a sports shop and an academy to train and promote talented budding cricketers. After toiling hard, they succeed in establishing it as a center for cricket among the local youth and start to incur profits.\n\nIshaan requests Govind to teach his sister Vidya \"V\" Bhatt ([[Amrita Puri]]) mathematics as her exams are coming up. Govind is reluctant at first but agrees eventually. Vidya and Govind gradually fall in love with each other and secretly begin a physical relationship. Omi discovers the same and warns Govind of the consequences, as Ishaan is very protective of his sister.\n\nThe three friends spot a budding cricketing talent in a local boy, Ali Hashmi ([[Digvijay Deshmukh]]), who has a rare talent, and Ishaan starts training him vigorously. Govind is ambitious and wants to expand the budding business by opening a shop in a mall being constructed in Navrangpura, an upcoming part of the city. With financial help coming from Omi's maternal uncle, Bishakh \"Bittu\" Joshi ([[Manav Kaul]]), the trio secure the deal and set up shop in the mall. Disaster strikes when a [[2001 Gujarat earthquake|destructive earthquake]] hits Gujarat and the mall is destroyed. Govind is shattered as the amount of money they invested was very large and they are now loaded with a huge debt. Omi is reluctantly forced to work for Bittu's right-wing party due to the money they owe him.\n\nWhen relief camps of Bittu's party declines to give Muslims shelter in troubled times, Ishaan and Omi quarrel over their politico-religious outlook and temporarily break off their friendship. They again reunite after India's surprise win in the [[Second Test, 2000\u201301 Border\u2013Gavaskar Trophy|test match]] against Australia. Omi gets busy with religious politics and joins Bittu's party. Ishaan and Govind, meanwhile, are busy with Ali and Vidya respectively. Tension arises in the political sphere when Bittu loses the elections in his constituency to his opponent. As a part of their campaigning, Bittu sends pilgrims ([[kar sevaks]]) to [[Ayodhya]] to the Ram Temple. Omi's parents were also among them. On the returning day, the shocking news of the [[Godhra train massacre]] reaches the people. Omi is shattered but Bittu convinces him to take revenge on the murderers of his parents.\n\nIshaan and Govind hide in Ali's house, fearing the [[2002 Gujarat riots|communal riots]] which were about to start. As expected, the violence starts by sunset, and the mob led by Bittu storms into the Muslim locality, killing each and every Muslim in sight. A fight ensues between Ali's father Nasir ([[Asif Basra]]) and Bittu. Nasir stabs Bittu in defense and rushes to save Ali and take shelter in their attic. Omi, enraged at the death of his uncle Bittu, follows him with a gun. Meanwhile, Ishaan comes to know about Vidya and Govind's relationship, when he reads Vidya's text message in Govind's mobile phone about her periods. Enraged, he starts thrashing Govind while Omi enters the premises with a gun in hand, desperate to find and kill Ali and Nasir. Ishaan and Govind break their own fighting and try to stop Omi as he desperately searches for Ali and Nasir. Omi finally aims and shoots at Ali. Ishaan in a bid to save Ali takes the bullet himself and consequently dies, leaving both friends and Vidya devastated.\n\nPresent day\n\nThe film then goes back to where it started, with Omi being released from prison ten years later. Govind and Vidya are married and have a son, whom they have named Ishaan after their late friend. Vidya forgives Omi when he breaks down in front of her.

The film won two awards, including [[Filmfare Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]] for Kapoor and [[Filmfare Award for Best Background Score|Best Background Score]] for Hitesh Sonik.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe film begins with Govind \"Govi\" Patel ([[Rajkumar Rao]]) giving a presentation in a school about the services provided by his sports club. In a parallel scene, Omkar \"Omi\" Shastri ([[Amit Sadh]]) is released from prison. While halting at a restaurant mid-way, Govind and Omi recall their days back to the year 2000 with the life of their late friend Ishaan.\n\n12 years ago\n\nIshaan \"Ish\" Bhatt ([[Sushant Singh Rajput]]) is an ex-district level cricketer who is a victim of politics in the cricketing selection fraternity, Omi is the nephew of a Hindu politician, Bittu, who funds his father's temple and Govind is a geek with a penchant for business and numbers. Together they open a sports shop and an academy to train and promote talented budding cricketers. After toiling hard, they succeed in establishing it as a center for cricket among the local youth and start to incur profits.\n\nIshaan requests Govind to teach his sister Vidya \"V\" Bhatt ([[Amrita Puri]]) mathematics as her exams are coming up. Govind is reluctant at first but agrees eventually. Vidya and Govind gradually fall in love with each other and secretly begin a physical relationship. Omi discovers the same and warns Govind of the consequences, as Ishaan is very protective of his sister.\n\nThe three friends spot a budding cricketing talent in a local boy, Ali Hashmi ([[Digvijay Deshmukh]]), who has a rare talent, and Ishaan starts training him vigorously. Govind is ambitious and wants to expand the budding business by opening a shop in a mall being constructed in Navrangpura, an upcoming part of the city. With financial help coming from Omi's maternal uncle, Bishakh \"Bittu\" Joshi ([[Manav Kaul]]), the trio secure the deal and set up shop in the mall. Disaster strikes when a [[2001 Gujarat earthquake|destructive earthquake]] hits Gujarat and the mall is destroyed. Govind is shattered as the amount of money they invested was very large and they are now loaded with a huge debt. Omi is reluctantly forced to work for Bittu's right-wing party due to the money they owe him.\n\nWhen relief camps of Bittu's party declines to give Muslims shelter in troubled times, Ishaan and Omi quarrel over their politico-religious outlook and temporarily break off their friendship. They again reunite after India's surprise win in the [[Second Test, 2000\u201301 Border\u2013Gavaskar Trophy|test match]] against Australia. Omi gets busy with religious politics and joins Bittu's party. Ishaan and Govind, meanwhile, are busy with Ali and Vidya respectively. Tension arises in the political sphere when Bittu loses the elections in his constituency to his opponent. As a part of their campaigning, Bittu sends pilgrims ([[kar sevaks]]) to [[Ayodhya]] to the Ram Temple. Omi's parents were also among them. On the returning day, the shocking news of the [[Godhra train massacre]] reaches the people. Omi is shattered but Bittu convinces him to take revenge on the murderers of his parents.\n\nIshaan and Govind hide in Ali's house, fearing the [[2002 Gujarat riots|communal riots]] which were about to start. As expected, the violence starts by sunset, and the mob led by Bittu storms into the Muslim locality, killing each and every Muslim in sight. A fight ensues between Ali's father Nasir ([[Asif Basra]]) and Bittu. Nasir stabs Bittu in defense and rushes to save Ali and take shelter in their attic. Omi, enraged at the death of his uncle Bittu, follows him with a gun. Meanwhile, Ishaan comes to know about Vidya and Govind's relationship, when he reads Vidya's text message in Govind's mobile phone about her periods. Enraged, he starts thrashing Govind while Omi enters the premises with a gun in hand, desperate to find and kill Ali and Nasir. Ishaan and Govind break their own fighting and try to stop Omi as he desperately searches for Ali and Nasir. Omi finally aims and shoots at Ali. Ishaan in a bid to save Ali takes the bullet himself and consequently dies, leaving both friends and Vidya devastated.\n\nPresent day\n\nThe film then goes back to where it started, with Omi being released from prison ten years later. Govind and Vidya are married and have a son, whom they have named Ishaan after their late friend. Vidya forgives Omi when he breaks down in front of her. The film ends with a now grown up Ali ([[Tahir Raj Bhasin]]) debuting for the [[India national cricket team|Indian cricket team]] against [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]]. He plays his first shot by hitting the ball to the boundary with a cover drive just like Ishaan had taught him. Ishaan's spirit smiles at Ali's achievement, and goes away smiling.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sushant Singh Rajput]] as Ishaan \"Ish\" Bhatt\n* [[Amit Sadh]] as Omkar \"Omi\" Shastri\n* [[Rajkummar Rao]] as Govind \"Govi\" Patel\n* [[Amrita Puri]] as Vidya Bhatt\n* [[Digvijay Deshmukh]] as Ali Hashmi\n* [[Asif Basra]] as Nasir Hashmi, Ali's father\n* [[Manav Kaul]] as Bishakh \"Bittu\" Joshi,  Omi's uncle\n* [[Tahir Raj Bhasin]] in a special appearance as an adult Ali\n* Ishaan Bhagat  as Ishaan Patel<ref>{{cite web|author=Mehul S Thakkar |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-22/news-interviews/37240897_1_kai-po-che-kai-po-che-chetan-bhagat |title=Chetan Bhagat's son in Kai Po Che |work=The Times of India |date= 22 February 2013 |accessdate=24 February 2013}}</ref> in a special appearance\n* Dinesh Kumar as John\n* Ashish Kakkad as Vishwas\n* [[Ajay Jadeja]] in a cameo appearance as cricket commentator\n* [[Gaurav Kapur]] in a cameo appearance as cricket commentator\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began in [[Vadnagar]] in [[Mehsana]] district of [[Gujarat]] along majority of scenes canned in old [[Ahmedabad]] and continued further in [[Porbandar]], [[Diu, India|Diu]].<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/more/news/view/id/1431589 | title = 'I am happy that Kai Po Che is on floors' \u2013 Ashish Phadtare | date = 24 April 2012 | accessdate = 1 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =http://ibnlive.in.com/generalnewsfeed/news/kai-po-che-to-release-in-january-next-year/1000254.html | title = 'Kai Po Che' to release in January next year | publisher = [[IBN Live]] | date = 18 May 2012 | accessdate = 1 June 2012}}</ref> A scene featuring the trio was shot at Hatkeshwar Mahadev temple.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/Sacred-start-to-Kai-Po-Che/Article1-851015.aspx | title = Sacred start to Kai Po Che! |work = [[Hindustan Times]] | date = 5 May 2012 | accessdate = 8 May 2012}}</ref> One of the songs Meethi Boliyan was exclusively shot around [[Daman, Daman and Diu|Daman]] and [[Diu, India|Diu]].

The [[Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico]] was founded by royal decree in 1551, a few months after the [[National University of San Marcos]] in Lima. By comparison, [[Harvard College]], the oldest in the USA,was founded in 1636 and the oldest Canadian University, [[Universit\u00e9 Laval]] dates from 1663. Education in Mexico was, until the twentieth-century, largely confined to males from the urban and aristocratic elite and under the auspices of the [[History of Roman Catholicism in Mexico|Roman Catholic Church in Mexico]].\n\nThe Mexican state has been directly involved in education since the nineteenth century, promoting secular education.  Control of education was a source of ongoing conflict between the Mexican state and the Roman Catholic Church, which since the colonial era had exclusive charge of education.<ref>Pilar Gonzalbo Aizpuru, \"Education: Colonial\" in ''Encyclopedia or Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 434\u2013438.</ref><ref>Antonio Escobar Ohmstede, \"Education: 1821\u20131989\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 438\u2013441.</ref><ref>Mary Kay Vaughan, \"Education: 1889\u20131940\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 441\u2013445.</ref><ref>Valentina Torres Septi\u00e9n, \"Education: 1940\u20131996\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 445\u2013449.</ref>  The mid-nineteenth-century Liberal Reform separated church and state, which had a direct impact on education.  President [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] sought the expansion of public schools. During the lengthy tenure of president [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]], the expansion of education became a priority under a cabinet-level post held by [[Justo Sierra]]; Sierra also served President [[Francisco I. Madero]] in the early years of the [[Mexican Revolution]].\n\nThe [[1917 Constitution of Mexico|1917 Constitution]] strengthened the Mexican state's power in education, undermining the power of the Roman Catholic Church to shape the educational development of Mexicans. During presidency of [[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]] in the early 1920s, his Minister of Public Education [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]] implemented a massive expansion of access to public, secular education and expanded access to secular schooling in rural areas. This work was built on and expanded in the administration of [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]] by [[Mois\u00e9s S\u00e1enz]]. In the 1930s, the Mexican government under [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] mandated socialist education in Mexico and there was considerable push back from the Roman Catholic Church as an institution.  Socialist education was repealed during the 1940s, with the administration of [[Manuel \u00c1vila Camacho]]. A number of private universities have opened since the mid-twentieth century. The [[Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educaci\u00f3n|Mexican Teachers' Union]] (SNTE), founded in the late 1940s, has had tremendous national political power.  The Mexican federal government has undertaken reforms to improve education in Mexico, which have been resisted by the SNTE.{{Cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nEducation in Mexico is currently regulated by the [[Secretariat of Public Education]] ({{lang-es|Secretar\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica}}) ('''SEP'''). Education standards are set by this Ministry at all levels except in \"autonomous\" universities chartered by the government (e.g., [[Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico]]). Accreditation of private schools is accomplished by a mandatory approval and registration with this institution. Religious instruction is prohibited in public schools; however, religious associations are free to maintain [[private school]]s, which receive no public funds.\n\nIn the same fashion as other education systems, education has identifiable stages: Primary School, Junior High School (or Secondary School), High School, Higher education, and Postgraduate education.\n\n==Structure of the basic education system==\n[[Image:Inukshuk Monterrey 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Students in [[Monterrey]], [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]]]\nIn Mexico, basic education is normally divided in three steps: [[primary school]] (''primaria''), comprising grades 1\u20136; [[Middle school|junior high school]] (''secundaria''), comprising grades 7\u20139; and [[high school]] (''preparatoria''), comprising grades 10\u201312.\n\nDepending on definitions, Primary education comprises ''primaria'' and ''secundaria'', which are compulsory by law, while Secondary education only includes ''preparatoria'', which was not compulsory a few years ago, but it has been made mandatory as well.\n\n===Primary school===\n{{See also|Primary education}}\nThe terms \"Primary School\" or \"Elementary School\" usually corresponds to ''primaria'', comprising grades 1\u20136, when the student's offer is 6 to 12 years old. It starts the basic compulsory education system. These are the first years of schooling.\n\nDepending on the school, a bilingual education may be offered from the beginning, where half the day instruction is in Spanish, and the rest is in a second language, for example, [[English language|English]] or [[French language|French]].\n\n===Junior high school===\n{{See also|Secondary education}}\nThe terms \"Junior High School\" or \"Middle School\" usually correspond to ''secundaria'', comprising grades 7\u20139 when the student's age is 12 to 15 years old it is part of the basic compulsory education system, it follows primary school, and comes before  \"high school\" (''preparatoria'').\n\nAt this level, more specialized subjects may be taught such as Physics, Chemistry, and World History.\nThere is also the ''t\u00e9cnica'' which provides vocational training, and the ''telesecundaria'' which provides [[distance learning]].<ref name=\"transition63\"/>\n\n[[File:Sal\u00f3n_de_clase.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A class room operated by the [[Instituto de Educaci\u00f3n Media Superior de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico|High School Education Institute of Mexico City]].]]\n\nDespite the similarities of the words \"Secondary school\" and ''secundaria'', in Mexico the former is usually translated to ''preparatoria'', while in other countries, such as [[Puerto Rico]], or within the Spanish-speaking populations of the United States, the term ''secundaria'' refers to university.\n\n===High school===\nThe terms \"High School\"<ref>United States</ref> usually corresponds to ''preparatoria'' or ''bachillerato'', and follow \"secundaria\" comprising grades 10\u201312, when the student's age is 15 to 18 years old. Students may choose between two main kinds of high school programs: The SEP incorporated, and a University Incorporated one, depending on the state. Other minority of programs are available only for private schools, such as the [[International Baccalaureate]] which carries a completely different system. Nevertheless, in order to be taught, it must include a national subject at least. In addition, there are programs such as ''tecnolog\u00eda'' and ''comercio'' that prepare students for a particular vocational career.<ref name=\"transition63\">{{cite book|title=Mexico's Transition to a Knowledge-Based Economy: Challenges and Opportunities|page=63|first1=Yevgeny N.|last1=Kuznetsov|first2=Carl J.|last2=Dahlman|year=2008|publisher=[[World Bank Publications]]|isbn=978-0-8213-6921-0|doi=10.1596/978-0-8213-6921-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gq3pw2fE-vkC&pg=PA63|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n''Preparatoria'' traditionally consists of three years of education, divided into six semesters, with the first semesters having a common curriculum, and the latter ones allowing some degree of specialization, either in physical sciences (physics, [[chemistry]], [[biology]], etc.) or social sciences ([[commerce]], [[philosophy]], [[law]], etc.). The term ''preparatoria'' is most commonly used for institutions that offer a three-year education program that \"prepares\" the student with general knowledge to continue studying at a university. In contrast, the term ''bachillerato'' is most often used for institutions that provide [[vocational school|vocational training]], in two or three years, so the graduate can get a job as a [[skilled worker]], for example, an assistant [[accountant]], a bilingual [[secretary]] or a [[technician]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}.\n\n== Educational integration ==\n[[Image:Biblioteca_Palafoxiana_de_Puebla.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Biblioteca Palafoxiana]] founded in 1646, was the first [[public library]] in colonial Mexico,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brescia|first=Michael M.|title=Liturgical Expressions of Episcopal Power: Juan de Palafox y Mendoza and Tridentine Reform in Colonial Mexico|journal=The Catholic Historical Review|date=July 2004|volume=90|issue=3|pages=497\u2013518|doi=10.1353/cat.2004.0116|jstor=25026636}}</ref> and is sometimes considered the first in the Americas.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oxford Companion to the Book|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Sherman, William H.|chapter=Palafoxiana, Biblioteca|editor1=Suarez, Michael F. |editor2=Woudhuysen, H.

This law mandates the integration of students with special needs into regular classrooms.<ref>Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n. (1993). ''Ley General de Educaci\u00f3n'' retrieved August 10, 2018), from <nowiki>http://www.sep.gob.mx/work/models/sep1/Resource/b490561c-5c33-4254-ad1caad33765928a/07104.pdf</nowiki></ref> Although formally, the term \u2018educational integration\u2019 is used, \u2018inclusive education\u2019 is often used to describe the educational system.<ref name=\":1\">Fletcher, T., Dejud, C., Klingler, C., & Lopez-Marisca, I. (2003) The changing paradigm of special education in Mexico: Voices from the field. ''Bilingual Research Journal, 27''(3), 409\u2013430.</ref> Implementation of educational integration has taken many years and still continues to face obstacles. Under the current model, students with severe disabilities that would not benefit from inclusion, study the same curriculum as regular classrooms in separate schools called Centros de Atencion Multiple [Multiple Attention Center], or CAM. Otherwise, special needs students are placed in regular classrooms and are supported by the Unidades de Servicio y Apoyo a la Educaci\u00f3n Regular or the Unit of Support Services for Regular Education, (USAER). This group is made up of special education teachers, speech therapists, psychologists and other professionals to help special needs students in the classroom and minimize barriers to their learning.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n=== Challenges to educational integration ===\nThe combination of USAER professionals and regular teaching working in the same classroom has caused some issues for educational integration. Specifically, there is confusion about the roles of USAER professionals who work in regular classrooms. A study of USAER members found that regardless of urban or rural contexts, professionals had\u00a0four common concerns. First, USAER professionals felt that they lacked preparation for working in the classroom. The second issue was feeling like their role had changed due to more demands being placed on them. The last two concerns were the lack of communication and collaboration between teachers and USAER professionals. Although the two work in the same classroom, they often work independently. However, this creates problems when adjusting the curriculum for special needs students.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAccessibility is another challenge for educational integration. Schools are required to have accessible buildings and classrooms, provide technical support and appropriate materials for special needs students,<ref name=\":2\">Flores Barrera, V.J., & Garc\u00eda Cedillo, I. (2016) Apoyos que reciben estudiantes de secundaria con discapacidad en escuelas regulares: \u00bfCorresponden a lo que dicen las leyes? ''Revista Educaci\u00f3n, 40''(2), 1\u201320.</ref> but a case study found that the school was not equipped for students with sensory disabilities. The school lacked accessible furniture, handicapped restrooms or proper modification for students with sensory disabilities.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFinally, training for new teachers doesn't provide them enough experience with special needs students, making the shift to educational integration difficult. A study of 286 pre-service teachers found that a third of didn't have any experience working with special needs students. Additionally, 44% of the teachers reported having no formal training in working with this population.<ref>Forlin, C., Garc\u00eda-Cedillo, I., Romero\u2010Contreras, S., Fletcher, T., & Rodr\u00edguez-Hern\u00e1ndez, H.J., (2010) Inclusion in Mexico: ensuring supportive attitudes by newly graduated teachers.

A formal system of writing was created in various parts of central and southern Mexico, with trained experts in its practice.  After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], friars embarked on a widespread program of evangelization of Christianity. In the colonial era, schooling of elite men of European descent was established under the auspices of the Catholic Church.  Liberals' attempts to separate church and state in post-independence Mexico included removal of the Catholic Church from education.  Education remains an important aspect of Mexican institutional and cultural life, and conflicts continue about how it should be conducted. The history of education in Mexico gives insight into the larger history of the nation.\n\n===Education in Mesoamerica Before the Spanish===\n[[File:Quetzalcoatl Mural in Acapulco, Mexico.jpg|thumb|left|[[Quetzalcoatl]] Mural in [[Acapulco]] by [[Diego Rivera]].]]\n[[File:Codex Mendoza folio 61r.jpg|thumb|right|[[Codex Mendoza]], Folio 61 recto<br>''(top)'' Formal education of 15-year-old Aztec boys trained for the military or the priesthood.<br>''(bottom)'' A 15-year-old girl gets married.]]\n\nIn central Mexico in the cultural area known as [[Mesoamerica]], the [[Aztecs]] set up schools called [[calmecac]] for the training of warriors and schools for the training of priests, called ''cuicacalli''. An early post-conquest manuscript prepared by native scribes for the viceroy of Mexico, [[Codex Mendoza]] shows these two types of schools. Aztec religion was highly complex and priests held a higher status, so that the creation of schools to train them in ritual and other aspects of religion was important. Overseeing an expansionist empire, Aztec rulers needed trained warriors, so that the creation of formal schools for their training was as important.\n\nQuetzalcoatl, the Aztec god of wind, air, and [[learning]], wears around his neck the \"wind breastplate\" ''ehecailacocozcatl'', \"the spirally voluted wind jewel\" made of a conch shell. This talisman was a conch shell cut at the cross-section and was likely worn as a necklace by religious rulers, as such objects have been discovered in burials in archaeological sites throughout Mesoamerica,<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/the-wine-gods-breastplate/|title= The Wind God's Breastplate|first= Stephan F. |last= De Borhegyi |magazine= Expedition |volume= 8 |issue= 4 |year= 1966 | quote = This breastplate, the insignia of the wind god, called in Nahuatl the ehecailacacozcatl, (the 'spirally voluted wind jewel') was made by cutting across the upper portion of a marine conch shell, and drilling holes for suspension by a cord. Such conch shell breastplates were either hung on the sculpture of the god himself or were worn by the high priests, the earthly representatives of this god. According to such sixteenth century Spanish authorities as Fray Bernardino de Sahagun, [...] the title of Quetzalcoatl was reserved for the high priests or pontiffs among the Aztecs and other inhabitants of Mexico. Only they were entitled to wear the emblem of ehecailacacozcatl, the insignia of this god. Such marine shell breastplates are therefore extremely rare. Of the few that survived the Spanish Conquest, most were destroyed by overly zealous friars; only a handful have been turned up by archaeologists.}}</ref>\n\n===Colonial-era education, 1521\u20131821===\n{{See also|Academy of San Carlos}}\n\n====Education of the indigenous in Central Mexico====\n[[File:Biblioteca P\u00fablica UMSNH 093.jpg|thumb|left|Public library of the [[Universidad Michoacana de San Nicol\u00e1s de Hidalgo]] UMSNH.

All the mendicant orders in Mexico, the Franciscans, Dominicans, and Augustinians, built churches in large indigenous communities as places of worship and to teach the catechism, so that large outdoor atriums functioned as classrooms.<ref>Aizpuru, \u201cEducation: Colonial,\u201d p. 435.</ref> Elite indigenous lads were tapped for training as catechists and helpers to the priests, whose small numbers could in no way minister to large numbers of ordinary indigenous.\n\nIn 1536, the Franciscans and the Spanish crown established a school to train an indigenous Catholic priesthood, the [[Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco]], which was deemed a failure in its goal of training priests, but did create a small cohort of indigenous men who were literate in their native language of [[Nahuatl]], as well as Spanish and Latin.  The Franciscans also founded the school of San Jos\u00e9 de los Naturales in Mexico City, which taught trades and crafts to boys. The [[Colegio de San Gregorio]] was also founded for the education of indigenous elites, the most famous of whom was [[Chimalpahin]], (also known as Don Domingo Francisco de San Ant\u00f3n Mu\u00f1\u00f3n Chimalpahin Quauhtlehuanitzin).\n\nReligious orders, particularly the Franciscans, taught indigenous scribes in central Mexico to be literate in their own languages, allowing the creation of documents at the local level for colonial officials and communities to enable crown administration as well as production of last will and testaments, petitions to the crown, bills of sale, censuses and other types of legal record to be produced at the local level.<ref>[[Frances Karttunen|Karttunen, Frances]]. \u201cNahuatl Literacy\u201d in ''The Inca and Aztec States'', New York:  Academic Press,</ref>  The large number of indigenous language documents found in the archives in Mexico and elsewhere have enabled scholars of the [[New Philology]] to analyze life of Mexico's colonial-era indigenous from indigenous perspectives.

However, there were seminaries to train priests in provincial cities, such as the Colegio de San Nicol\u00e1s, founded by Bishop [[Vasco de Quiroga]] in the city now called [[Morelia]]. Insurgent leader Father [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] served as rector there until he was relieved of his position. One of his students was insurgent leader Father [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos]].

Since the 1940s, Catholic universities have re-emerged.

The number of schools expanded and the federal government expanded centralized control. Municipal governments had to yield control to state governments, and the federal bureaucracy for public schooling was established under the Ministry of Education, a cabinet-level position. More money was spent on public schools in this era, increasing faster than other public expenditures.\u00a0 Public schooling was part of Mexico's project of modernization, to create an educated workforce. Those overseeing school sought to instill the virtues of punctuality, thrift, valuable work habits, abstinence from alcohol and tobacco use, and gambling, along with creating a literate population. Although these were a lofty aim, implementation was hampered by poorly trained teachers who were poorly trained.<ref>Vaughan,\u00a0Mary Kay, ''The State, Education, and Social Class in Mexico, 1880\u20131928''.

Although the schools were aimed at creating an educated populace envisioned by Porfirian elites, quite a number of school teachers were active in opposing the D\u00edaz regime and participated in the [[Mexican Revolution]],<ref>Vaughan, ''State, Education, and Social Class in Mexico'', p. 76-77</ref> including [[Pascual Orozco]] and [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]].

Centralization of education was via the federal Ministry of Education (''Secretaria de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica'' or SEP). [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]] became its head in 1921 and proceeded to enact a wide range of educational programs, including indigenous education. The so-called \"Indian problem,\" the lack of incorporation of Mexico's indigenous population into the nation as citizens, was an issue that the SEP tackled. Indigenous children were not to be taught in separate schools in their own languages, but taught in Spanish along with non-indigenous, mestizo students. An early program was the formation of \"Missionaries of Indigenous Culture and Public Education,\" which had the aim of imparting a secular worldview emphasizing \"community development, modernization, and incorporation into the mestizo mainstream.\"<ref>Lewis, Stephen E. \"The Nation, Education, and the 'Indian Problem' in Mexico, 1920\u20131940\" in ''The Eagle and the Virgin: Nation and Cultural Revolution in Mexico, 1920\u20131940'', Mary Kay Vaughan and Stephen E.

Public schools became a means for the government to directly influence the countryside ideologically through education of the next generations. Public school teachers saw themselves \"as part of a mystical crusade for the nation, modernity, and social justice,\" but SEP personnel often held campesinos and rural culture in contempt.  In the 1930s, during the early presidency of [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] (1934\u201340) there was a push for \"socialist education\" at all levels. The policy made public schools sources of anti-religious ideology fueling resistance by Catholics.<ref>Vaughan, \"Nationalizing the Countryside\" pp. 158\u201359</ref>\n\nThe government expanded [[normal schools]] for teacher training after the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1910.<ref name=\"Agren 4A\">{{Cite news | first=David | last=Agren | title='Normalistas' fight changes in Mexico education system | url=http://www.floridatoday.com/usatoday/article/1748405 | newspaper=[[Florida Today]] | location=Melbourne, Florida | pages= 4A | date=December 10, 2012 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref><!---hard copy source different from soft copy but is the identical article---> As the federal government consolidated power through the formation of the National Revolutionary Party (PNR) in 1928 and its new iteration in 1936, the Mexican Revolutionary Party (PRM), teachers played an important role in the creation of national worker and national peasant organizations.  Public education \"contributed to the consolidation of an authoritarian single-party regime.\"<ref>Vaughan, \"Nationalizing the Countryside\" p. 159.</ref>\n\nWhen the Mexican government implemented its policy of socialist education, it directly targeted religious-affiliated, private schooling. Students in these schools were barred from receiving valid educational certification, which effectively prevented many from entering professions. The aim of socialist education was create a \"useful and efficient worker capable of assuming leadership of the national economy, employing methods of modern science with a profound consciousness of collective responsibility ... an indispensable precondition for the coming of a state in the hands of the working classes.\"<ref>Alberto Bremauntz, ''La educaci\u00f3n socialista en M\u00e9xico''.

C\u00e1rdenas backed away from socialist education. Catholic student groups' mobilization against socialist education had lasting consequences, with leaders in the Catholic Student Union playing an important role in the founding of the conservative, pro-Catholic [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] in 1939.<ref>Espinosa, David.

Created by presidential decree in 1943.]]\n\nWhen President C\u00e1rdenas chose [[Manuel Avila Camacho]] as his successor, he chose a moderate, particularly on church-state issues where education was contentious.  In office, Avila Camacho ended socialist education. Initially, the Ministry of Education continued various policies from the C\u00e1rdenas era, but with Avila Camacho's appointment of [[Jaime Torres Bodet]] as head of the SEP, government policy sought to raise educational standards and invest in teacher training.  Torres Bodet founded the National Institute of Teacher Training. He sought to create a curriculum that was nationalist and democratic. \"Education was to be secular, free of religious doctrine, and based on scientific truths.\"<ref>Valentina Torres Septi\u00e9n, \"Education: 1940\u20131996\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 446.</ref>\n\n[[File:Conservatorio_Nacional_de_M\u00fasica_de_M\u00e9xico.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[National Conservatory of Music of Mexico]] founded on July 1, 1866.]]\nDuring the period ca. 1940\u20131960, Mexico experienced sustained economic growth, the so-called [[Mexican Miracle]], which saw increased urbanization and industrialization.  The idea that education was a determinant of economic development took hold and the government of President [[Adolfo L\u00f3pez Mateos]], who appointed Torres Bodet Minister of Education.  Torres Bodet made a comprehensive assessment of Mexican education, which led to the Eleven-Year Plan for Education, attempting to make a commitment that forced the next president to continue implementation. The assessment of Mexican primary-level schools showed that 50% of Mexican children, or 3 million, had access to primary education. Of those, fewer than 25% finished 4th grade. Only about 1,000 of those primary school students would succeed in pursuing a profession. A basic finding was that only 50% of Mexicans could read or write. L\u00f3pez Mateos sought reforms to remedy the situation, including training 27,000 more teachers and building more schools. He also created a program to provide free textbooks to students and made their use obligatory in schools.<ref>Torres Septi\u00e9n, \"Education: 1940\u20131996\" pp. 446\u201347.</ref>\n\nIn 1949, Mexican teachers formed a national union that was affiliated with the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) and came to be a powerful bloc within it. The [[Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educaci\u00f3n]] (SNTE), (National Union of Education Workers) was formed as a section within the umbrella organization of the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), the labor sector of the dominant party. In the late 1930s, teachers had begun to form unions that were eventually brought into the SNTE.\n\n[[File:Logo snte.png|600px|thumb|left|Logo of the National Union of Education Workers]]\n[[File:Musee_National_Anthropologie-Entree.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[National Museum of Anthropology]] the largest and most visited museum in Mexico opened in 1964.]]\nIn 1968, when Mexico hosted the Olympic Games in the capital, there were widespread demonstrations against spending so much on such an event, when there were higher national priorities.  University students participated in a major way in these demonstrations, with the government reacting violently in the [[Tlatelolco massacre]] of October 1968. In June 1971, there was further student activism in Mexico City that resulted in more violent government repression, known as the [[Corpus Christi massacre]]. Recognizing that failures in the educational system was a cause of the 1968 student activism, the government of [[Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz]] (1964\u20131970) attempted to implement educational reform as part of a wider social reform. The government sought to reach Mexicans who had not had access to education previously and the use of radio and television were seen as ways to do this. Adult education became a focus of the expansion. With the presidency of [[Luis Echeverr\u00eda]] (1970\u20131976), the expansion included the use of [[telenovela]]s (soap operas) to shape public understandings, and Mexico became a pioneer in the use of this medium for policy matters. Better health care in earlier years had resulted in a population boom as infant mortality declined and fertility increased. With Catholic Church opposition to birth control, the secular format of telenovela were a means to bring a message of the benefits of family planning to women.<ref>Gabriela Soto Laveaga, \"'Let's become fewer': Soap operas, contraception, and nationalizing the Mexican family in an overpopulated world.\" ''Sexuality Research and Social Policy'' September 2007, vol. 4 no. 3.</ref>  The government sought to strengthen higher education particularly in the sciences and technology, establishing [[Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (Mexico)|the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT)]] in 1970. It funds fellowships for graduate students to study abroad to increase their specialized knowledge. Despite sustained government efforts over several presidential administrations, Mexican education had not significantly affected low education levels and high levels of illiteracy in the country, especially in rural areas. President [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo]] (1976\u20131982) created a National Literacy Program (''Pronalf'') in 1980 and then established an independent institute for adult education (Instituto Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n para Adultos INEA).<ref>Torres Septi\u00e9n, \"Education: 1940\u20131996\" pp. 448\u201348</ref>  With the collapse of the Mexican economy during the oil crisis of 1982, educational reform awaited economic recovery.\n\n[[File:DeniseDresserG.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Noted commentator and political science professor [[Denise Dresser]].

Curriculum reform was also undertaken by the SEP, which included the creation of new textbooks.  Protests resulted in the government's withdrawing the textbooks.<ref>Dennis Gilbert, \"Rewriting History: Salinas, Zedillo and the 1992 Textbook Controversy\", ''Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos'',  Vol. 13  No. 2,  Summer, 1997; (pp. 271\u2013297) DOI: 10.2307/1052017</ref> A third component of the accord was the creation of a system of merit pay for teachers.<ref>Hecock, R.

The [[Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico]] was founded by royal decree in 1551, a few months after the [[National University of San Marcos]] in Lima. By comparison, [[Harvard College]], the oldest in the USA,was founded in 1636 and the oldest Canadian University, [[Universit\u00e9 Laval]], dates from 1663. Education in Mexico was, until the twentieth-century, largely confined to males from the urban and aristocratic elite and under the auspices of the [[History of Roman Catholicism in Mexico|Roman Catholic Church in Mexico]].\n\nThe Mexican state has been directly involved in education since the nineteenth century, promoting secular education.  Control of education was a source of ongoing conflict between the Mexican state and the Roman Catholic Church, which since the colonial era had exclusive charge of education.<ref>Pilar Gonzalbo Aizpuru, \"Education: Colonial\" in ''Encyclopedia or Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 434\u2013438.</ref><ref>Antonio Escobar Ohmstede, \"Education: 1821\u20131989\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 438\u2013441.</ref><ref>Mary Kay Vaughan, \"Education: 1889\u20131940\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 441\u2013445.</ref><ref>Valentina Torres Septi\u00e9n, \"Education: 1940\u20131996\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 445\u2013449.</ref>  The mid-nineteenth-century Liberal Reform separated church and state, which had a direct impact on education.  President [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] sought the expansion of public schools. During the lengthy tenure of president [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]], the expansion of education became a priority under a cabinet-level post held by [[Justo Sierra]]; Sierra also served President [[Francisco I. Madero]] in the early years of the [[Mexican Revolution]].\n\nThe [[1917 Constitution of Mexico|1917 Constitution]] strengthened the Mexican state's power in education, undermining the power of the Roman Catholic Church to shape the educational development of Mexicans. During presidency of [[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]] in the early 1920s, his Minister of Public Education [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]] implemented a massive expansion of access to public, secular education and expanded access to secular schooling in rural areas. This work was built on and expanded in the administration of [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]] by [[Mois\u00e9s S\u00e1enz]]. In the 1930s, the Mexican government under [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] mandated socialist education in Mexico and there was considerable push back from the Roman Catholic Church as an institution.  Socialist education was repealed during the 1940s, with the administration of [[Manuel \u00c1vila Camacho]]. A number of private universities have opened since the mid-twentieth century. The [[Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educaci\u00f3n|Mexican Teachers' Union]] (SNTE), founded in the late 1940s, has had tremendous national political power.  The Mexican federal government has undertaken reforms to improve education in Mexico, which have been resisted by the SNTE.{{Cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nEducation in Mexico is currently regulated by the [[Secretariat of Public Education]] ({{lang-es|Secretar\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica}}) ('''SEP'''). Education standards are set by this Ministry at all levels except in \"autonomous\" universities chartered by the government (e.g., [[Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico]]). Accreditation of private schools is accomplished by a mandatory approval and registration with this institution. Religious instruction is prohibited in public schools; however, religious associations are free to maintain [[private school]]s, which receive no public funds.\n\nIn the same fashion as other education systems, education has identifiable stages: Primary School, Junior High School (or Secondary School), High School, Higher education, and Postgraduate education.\n\n==Structure of the basic education system==\n[[Image:Inukshuk Monterrey 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Students in [[Monterrey]], [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]]]\nIn Mexico, basic education is normally divided in three steps: [[primary school]] (''primaria''), comprising grades 1\u20136; [[Middle school|junior high school]] (''secundaria''), comprising grades 7\u20139; and [[high school]] (''preparatoria''), comprising grades 10\u201312.\n\nDepending on definitions, Primary education comprises ''primaria'' and ''secundaria'', which are compulsory by law, while Secondary education only includes ''preparatoria'', which was not compulsory a few years ago, but it has been made mandatory as well.\n\n===Primary school===\n{{See also|Primary education}}\nThe terms \"Primary School\" or \"Elementary School\" usually corresponds to ''primaria'', comprising grades 1\u20136, when the student's offer is 6 to 12 years old. It starts the basic compulsory education system. These are the first years of schooling.\n\nDepending on the school, a bilingual education may be offered from the beginning, where half the day instruction is in Spanish, and the rest is in a second language, for example, [[English language|English]] or [[French language|French]].\n\n===Junior high school===\n{{See also|Secondary education}}\nThe terms \"Junior High School\" or \"Middle School\" usually correspond to ''secundaria'', comprising grades 7\u20139 when the student's age is 12 to 15 years old it is part of the basic compulsory education system, it follows primary school, and comes before  \"high school\" (''preparatoria'').\n\nAt this level, more specialized subjects may be taught such as Physics, Chemistry, and World History.\nThere is also the ''t\u00e9cnica'' which provides vocational training, and the ''telesecundaria'' which provides [[distance learning]].<ref name=\"transition63\"/>\n\n[[File:Sal\u00f3n_de_clase.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A class room operated by the [[Instituto de Educaci\u00f3n Media Superior de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico|High School Education Institute of Mexico City]].]]\n\nDespite the similarities of the words \"Secondary school\" and ''secundaria'', in Mexico the former is usually translated to ''preparatoria'', while in other countries, such as [[Puerto Rico]], or within the Spanish-speaking populations of the United States, the term ''secundaria'' refers to university.\n\n===High school===\nThe terms \"High School\"<ref>United States</ref> usually corresponds to ''preparatoria'' or ''bachillerato'', and follow \"secundaria\" comprising grades 10\u201312, when the student's age is 15 to 18 years old. Students may choose between two main kinds of high school programs: The SEP incorporated, and a University Incorporated one, depending on the state. Other minority of programs are available only for private schools, such as the [[International Baccalaureate]] which carries a completely different system. Nevertheless, in order to be taught, it must include a national subject at least. In addition, there are programs such as ''tecnolog\u00eda'' and ''comercio'' that prepare students for a particular vocational career.<ref name=\"transition63\">{{cite book|title=Mexico's Transition to a Knowledge-Based Economy: Challenges and Opportunities|page=63|first1=Yevgeny N.|last1=Kuznetsov|first2=Carl J.|last2=Dahlman|year=2008|publisher=[[World Bank Publications]]|isbn=978-0-8213-6921-0|doi=10.1596/978-0-8213-6921-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gq3pw2fE-vkC&pg=PA63|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n''Preparatoria'' traditionally consists of three years of education, divided into six semesters, with the first semesters having a common curriculum, and the latter ones allowing some degree of specialization, either in physical sciences (physics, [[chemistry]], [[biology]], etc.) or social sciences ([[commerce]], [[philosophy]], [[law]], etc.). The term ''preparatoria'' is most commonly used for institutions that offer a three-year education program that \"prepares\" the student with general knowledge to continue studying at a university. In contrast, the term ''bachillerato'' is most often used for institutions that provide [[vocational school|vocational training]], in two or three years, so the graduate can get a job as a [[skilled worker]], for example, an assistant [[accountant]], a bilingual [[secretary]] or a [[technician]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}.\n\n== Educational integration ==\n[[Image:Biblioteca_Palafoxiana_de_Puebla.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Biblioteca Palafoxiana]] founded in 1646, was the first [[public library]] in colonial Mexico,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brescia|first=Michael M.|title=Liturgical Expressions of Episcopal Power: Juan de Palafox y Mendoza and Tridentine Reform in Colonial Mexico|journal=The Catholic Historical Review|date=July 2004|volume=90|issue=3|pages=497\u2013518|doi=10.1353/cat.2004.0116|jstor=25026636}}</ref> and is sometimes considered the first in the Americas.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oxford Companion to the Book|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Sherman, William H.|chapter=Palafoxiana, Biblioteca|editor1=Suarez, Michael F. |editor2=Woudhuysen, H.

This law mandates the integration of students with special needs into regular classrooms.<ref>Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n. (1993). ''Ley General de Educaci\u00f3n'' retrieved August 10, 2018), from <nowiki>http://www.sep.gob.mx/work/models/sep1/Resource/b490561c-5c33-4254-ad1caad33765928a/07104.pdf</nowiki></ref> Although formally, the term \u2018educational integration\u2019 is used, \u2018inclusive education\u2019 is often used to describe the educational system.<ref name=\":1\">Fletcher, T., Dejud, C., Klingler, C., & Lopez-Marisca, I. (2003) The changing paradigm of special education in Mexico: Voices from the field. ''Bilingual Research Journal, 27''(3), 409\u2013430.</ref> Implementation of educational integration has taken many years and still continues to face obstacles. Under the current model, students with severe disabilities that would not benefit from inclusion, study the same curriculum as regular classrooms in separate schools called Centros de Atencion Multiple [Multiple Attention Center], or CAM. Otherwise, special needs students are placed in regular classrooms and are supported by the Unidades de Servicio y Apoyo a la Educaci\u00f3n Regular or the Unit of Support Services for Regular Education, (USAER). This group is made up of special education teachers, speech therapists, psychologists and other professionals to help special needs students in the classroom and minimize barriers to their learning.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n=== Challenges to educational integration ===\nThe combination of USAER professionals and regular teaching working in the same classroom has caused some issues for educational integration. Specifically, there is confusion about the roles of USAER professionals who work in regular classrooms. A study of USAER members found that regardless of urban or rural contexts, professionals had\u00a0four common concerns. First, USAER professionals felt that they lacked preparation for working in the classroom. The second issue was feeling like their role had changed due to more demands being placed on them. The last two concerns were the lack of communication and collaboration between teachers and USAER professionals. Although the two work in the same classroom, they often work independently. However, this creates problems when adjusting the curriculum for special needs students.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAccessibility is another challenge for educational integration. Schools are required to have accessible buildings and classrooms, provide technical support and appropriate materials for special needs students,<ref name=\":2\">Flores Barrera, V.J., & Garc\u00eda Cedillo, I. (2016) Apoyos que reciben estudiantes de secundaria con discapacidad en escuelas regulares: \u00bfCorresponden a lo que dicen las leyes?

The school lacked accessible furniture, handicapped restrooms or proper modification for students with sensory disabilities.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFinally, training for new teachers doesn't provide them enough experience with special needs students, making the shift to educational integration difficult. A study of 286 pre-service teachers found that a third of didn't have any experience working with special needs students. Additionally, 44% of the teachers reported having no formal training in working with this population.<ref>Forlin, C., Garc\u00eda-Cedillo, I., Romero\u2010Contreras, S., Fletcher, T., & Rodr\u00edguez-Hern\u00e1ndez, H.J., (2010) Inclusion in Mexico: ensuring supportive attitudes by newly graduated teachers.

While an estimated 10% of the population of [[Mexico]] is indigenous, it is the least represented in higher education. According to estimates, only between 1% and 3% of [[higher education]] enrollment in Mexico is indigenous. In response to this inequality, the General Coordination for Intercultural and Bilingual Education at the Ministry of Education established Intercultural Universities with the active participation of indigenous organizations and academic institutions in each region.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/FIELD/Cairo/images/RethinkingEducation.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location=|pages=47}}</ref>\n\n== International education ==\nAs of January 2015, the International Schools Consultancy (ISC)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iscresearch.com/|title=Home - International School Consultancy|website=www.iscresearch.com}}</ref> listed Mexico as having 151 international schools.<ref name=\"iscresearch.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000123/http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref> ISC defines an 'international school' in the following terms \"ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country\u2019s national curriculum and is international in its orientation.\"<ref name=\"iscresearch.com\"/> This definition is used by publications including [[The Economist]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21636757-english-language-schools-once-aimed-expatriates-now-cater-domestic-elites-new|title=The new local|website=The Economist}}</ref>\n\n==Educational years==\n[[Image:Rector\u00eda_1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education|ITESM Tec de Monterrey]].]]\n[[File:Entrada IPN.JPG|thumb|250px|[[National Polytechnic Institute]]]]\n[[File:UAM Cuajimalpa.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Metropolitana]]]]\n[[File:El Colegio de Mexico 2.JPG|250px|thumb|[[El Colegio de M\u00e9xico]] (The college of Mexico)]]\n[[File:Universidad_Iberoamericana,_Sede_Mexico_Santa_Fe,_edificio_Gris.JPG|right|thumb|250px|[[Universidad Iberoamericana]], a private institution founded in the early 1940s]]\n\n===School years===\n\nThe table below describes the most common patterns for schooling in the state sector:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

A formal system of writing was created in various parts of central and southern Mexico, with trained experts in its practice.  After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], friars embarked on a widespread program of evangelization of Christianity. In the colonial era, schooling of elite men of European descent was established under the auspices of the Catholic Church.  Liberals' attempts to separate church and state in post-independence Mexico included removal of the Catholic Church from education.  Education remains an important aspect of Mexican institutional and cultural life, and conflicts continue about how it should be conducted. The history of education in Mexico gives insight into the larger history of the nation.\n\n===Education in Mesoamerica Before the Spanish===\n[[File:Quetzalcoatl Mural in Acapulco, Mexico.jpg|thumb|left|[[Quetzalcoatl]] Mural in [[Acapulco]] by [[Diego Rivera]].]]\n[[File:Codex Mendoza folio 61r.jpg|thumb|right|[[Codex Mendoza]], Folio 61 recto<br>''(top)'' Formal education of 15-year-old Aztec boys trained for the military or the priesthood.<br>''(bottom)'' A 15-year-old girl gets married.]]\n\nIn central Mexico in the cultural area known as [[Mesoamerica]], the [[Aztecs]] set up schools called [[calmecac]] for the training of warriors and schools for the training of priests, called ''cuicacalli''. An early post-conquest manuscript prepared by native scribes for the viceroy of Mexico, [[Codex Mendoza]] shows these two types of schools. Aztec religion was highly complex and priests held a higher status, so that the creation of schools to train them in ritual and other aspects of religion was important. Overseeing an expansionist empire, Aztec rulers needed trained warriors, so that the creation of formal schools for their training was as important.\n\nQuetzalcoatl, the Aztec god of wind, air, and [[learning]], wears around his neck the \"wind breastplate\" ''ehecailacocozcatl'', \"the spirally voluted wind jewel\" made of a conch shell. This talisman was a conch shell cut at the cross-section and was likely worn as a necklace by religious rulers, as such objects have been discovered in burials in archaeological sites throughout Mesoamerica,<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/the-wine-gods-breastplate/|title= The Wind God's Breastplate|first= Stephan F. |last= De Borhegyi |magazine= Expedition |volume= 8 |issue= 4 |year= 1966 | quote = This breastplate, the insignia of the wind god, called in Nahuatl the ehecailacacozcatl, (the 'spirally voluted wind jewel') was made by cutting across the upper portion of a marine conch shell, and drilling holes for suspension by a cord. Such conch shell breastplates were either hung on the sculpture of the god himself or were worn by the high priests, the earthly representatives of this god. According to such sixteenth century Spanish authorities as Fray Bernardino de Sahagun, [...] the title of Quetzalcoatl was reserved for the high priests or pontiffs among the Aztecs and other inhabitants of Mexico. Only they were entitled to wear the emblem of ehecailacacozcatl, the insignia of this god. Such marine shell breastplates are therefore extremely rare. Of the few that survived the Spanish Conquest, most were destroyed by overly zealous friars; only a handful have been turned up by archaeologists.}}</ref>\n\n===Colonial-era education, 1521\u20131821===\n{{See also|Academy of San Carlos}}\n\n====Education of the indigenous in Central Mexico====\n[[File:Biblioteca P\u00fablica UMSNH 093.jpg|thumb|left|Public library of the [[Universidad Michoacana de San Nicol\u00e1s de Hidalgo]] UMSNH.

The first efforts of schooling in Mexico were friars\u2019 evangelization of indigenous populations. \u201cEducating the native population was a crucial justification of the colonizing enterprise, and that ''criollo'' (Spanish American) culture was encouraged as a vehicle for integrating\u201d the indigenous.<ref>Pilar Gonzalbo Aizpuru, \u201cEducation: Colonial\u201d in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 435.</ref>   Fray [[Pedro de Gante]] established schools for indigenous in the immediate post-conquest years and produced pictorial texts to teach Catholic doctrine.  All the mendicant orders in Mexico, the Franciscans, Dominicans, and Augustinians, built churches in large indigenous communities as places of worship and to teach the catechism, so that large outdoor atriums functioned as classrooms.<ref>Aizpuru, \u201cEducation: Colonial,\u201d p. 435.</ref> Elite indigenous lads were tapped for training as catechists and helpers to the priests, whose small numbers could in no way minister to large numbers of ordinary indigenous.\n\nIn 1536, the Franciscans and the Spanish crown established a school to train an indigenous Catholic priesthood, the [[Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco]], which was deemed a failure in its goal of training priests, but did create a small cohort of indigenous men who were literate in their native language of [[Nahuatl]], as well as Spanish and Latin.  The Franciscans also founded the school of San Jos\u00e9 de los Naturales in Mexico City, which taught trades and crafts to boys. The [[Colegio de San Gregorio]] was also founded for the education of indigenous elites, the most famous of whom was [[Chimalpahin]], (also known as Don Domingo Francisco de San Ant\u00f3n Mu\u00f1\u00f3n Chimalpahin Quauhtlehuanitzin).\n\nReligious orders, particularly the Franciscans, taught indigenous scribes in central Mexico to be literate in their own languages, allowing the creation of documents at the local level for colonial officials and communities to enable crown administration as well as production of last will and testaments, petitions to the crown, bills of sale, censuses and other types of legal record to be produced at the local level.<ref>[[Frances Karttunen|Karttunen, Frances]]. \u201cNahuatl Literacy\u201d in ''The Inca and Aztec States'', New York:  Academic Press,</ref>  The large number of indigenous language documents found in the archives in Mexico and elsewhere have enabled scholars of the [[New Philology]] to analyze life of Mexico's colonial-era indigenous from indigenous perspectives.

The university was located in the central core (''traza'') of [[Mexico City|History of Mexico City]].  Its first rector, [[Francisco Cervantes de Salazar]], wrote an account of the university.

One of its best-known graduates was Don [[Carlos de Sig\u00fcenza y G\u00f3ngora]], a Mexican savant of the seventeenth century, who was a friend of Sor [[Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]], a cloistered nun and intellectual, famous in her lifetime as the \u201cTenth Muse.\u201d   Sor Juana was barred from attending the university due to her gender.\n\nIn general, educational institutions were urban-based, with the capital Mexico City having the largest concentration.  However, there were seminaries to train priests in provincial cities, such as the Colegio de San Nicol\u00e1s, founded by Bishop [[Vasco de Quiroga]] in the city now called [[Morelia]]. Insurgent leader Father [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] served as rector there until he was relieved of his position. One of his students was insurgent leader Father [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos]].

[[Liberalism in Mexico|Liberalism]] emerged as an ideology in the post-independence period, with a major tenet being public secular education.  Conflict in the realm of education has been an ongoing issue in Mexican history, since the Catholic Church sought to retain its role in this sphere, while liberals have sought to undermine the Church's role. Since the 1940s, Catholic universities have re-emerged. Unionized school teachers have become a powerful force in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century Mexican politics.{{Cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Post-Independence Era, 1821\u20131850===\nWhen [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] put his Liberal vice president [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]] in charge of running the government, the vice president created in 1833 a public education system.

The number of schools expanded and the federal government expanded centralized control. Municipal governments had to yield control to state governments, and the federal bureaucracy for public schooling was established under the Ministry of Education, a cabinet-level position. More money was spent on public schools in this era, increasing faster than other public expenditures.\u00a0 Public schooling was part of Mexico's project of modernization, to create an educated workforce. Those overseeing school sought to instill the virtues of punctuality, thrift, valuable work habits, abstinence from alcohol and tobacco use, and gambling, along with creating a literate population. Although these were a lofty aim, implementation was hampered by poorly trained teachers who were poorly trained.<ref>Vaughan,\u00a0Mary Kay, ''The State, Education, and Social Class in Mexico, 1880\u20131928''. DeKalb IL: Northern Illinois University Press 1982, pp. 74\u201377</ref> Illiteracy was widespread, with the 1910 census indicating only 33% of men and 27% of women were literate. Few students went on to secondary or post-secondary education.  \"Porfirian schools were more important in their production of middle-class talent for the post-revolutionary educational and cultural efforts than they were in transforming popular behavior and illiteracy.\"<ref>Mary Kay Vaughan, \"Nationalizing the Countryside: Schools and Communities in the 1930s\" in ''The Eagle and the Virgin: Nation and Cultural Revolution in Mexico, 1920\u20131940'', Vaughan, Mary Kay and Stephen E.

He established the secular, state-controlled [[Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico|Universidad Nacional de M\u00e9xico]]; The [[Pontifical University of Mexico]] under religious authority was suppressed in 1865.\n\nWomen entered the teaching profession, which was considered a proper one for women who worked outside the home. Although the schools were aimed at creating an educated populace envisioned by Porfirian elites, quite a number of school teachers were active in opposing the D\u00edaz regime and participated in the [[Mexican Revolution]],<ref>Vaughan, ''State, Education, and Social Class in Mexico'', p. 76-77</ref> including [[Pascual Orozco]] and [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]].

Centralization of education was via the federal Ministry of Education (''Secretaria de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica'' or SEP). [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]] became its head in 1921 and proceeded to enact a wide range of educational programs, including indigenous education. The so-called \"Indian problem,\" the lack of incorporation of Mexico's indigenous population into the nation as citizens, was an issue that the SEP tackled. Indigenous children were not to be taught in separate schools in their own languages, but taught in Spanish along with non-indigenous, mestizo students. An early program was the formation of \"Missionaries of Indigenous Culture and Public Education,\" which had the aim of imparting a secular worldview emphasizing \"community development, modernization, and incorporation into the mestizo mainstream.\"<ref>Lewis, Stephen E. \"The Nation, Education, and the 'Indian Problem' in Mexico, 1920\u20131940\" in ''The Eagle and the Virgin: Nation and Cultural Revolution in Mexico, 1920\u20131940'', Mary Kay Vaughan and Stephen E.

Public schools became a means for the government to directly influence the countryside ideologically through education of the next generations. Public school teachers saw themselves \"as part of a mystical crusade for the nation, modernity, and social justice,\" but SEP personnel often held campesinos and rural culture in contempt.  In the 1930s, during the early presidency of [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] (1934\u201340) there was a push for \"socialist education\" at all levels.

Students in these schools were barred from receiving valid educational certification, which effectively prevented many from entering professions.

Initially, the Ministry of Education continued various policies from the C\u00e1rdenas era, but with Avila Camacho's appointment of [[Jaime Torres Bodet]] as head of the SEP, government policy sought to raise educational standards and invest in teacher training.  Torres Bodet founded the National Institute of Teacher Training. He sought to create a curriculum that was nationalist and democratic. \"Education was to be secular, free of religious doctrine, and based on scientific truths.\"<ref>Valentina Torres Septi\u00e9n, \"Education: 1940\u20131996\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 446.</ref>\n\n[[File:Conservatorio_Nacional_de_M\u00fasica_de_M\u00e9xico.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[National Conservatory of Music of Mexico]] founded on July 1, 1866.]]\nDuring the period ca. 1940\u20131960, Mexico experienced sustained economic growth, the so-called [[Mexican Miracle]], which saw increased urbanization and industrialization.  The idea that education was a determinant of economic development took hold and the government of President [[Adolfo L\u00f3pez Mateos]], who appointed Torres Bodet Minister of Education.  Torres Bodet made a comprehensive assessment of Mexican education, which led to the Eleven-Year Plan for Education, attempting to make a commitment that forced the next president to continue implementation. The assessment of Mexican primary-level schools showed that 50% of Mexican children, or 3 million, had access to primary education. Of those, fewer than 25% finished 4th grade. Only about 1,000 of those primary school students would succeed in pursuing a profession. A basic finding was that only 50% of Mexicans could read or write. L\u00f3pez Mateos sought reforms to remedy the situation, including training 27,000 more teachers and building more schools. He also created a program to provide free textbooks to students and made their use obligatory in schools.<ref>Torres Septi\u00e9n, \"Education: 1940\u20131996\" pp. 446\u201347.</ref>\n\nIn 1949, Mexican teachers formed a national union that was affiliated with the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) and came to be a powerful bloc within it. The [[Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educaci\u00f3n]] (SNTE), (National Union of Education Workers) was formed as a section within the umbrella organization of the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), the labor sector of the dominant party. In the late 1930s, teachers had begun to form unions that were eventually brought into the SNTE.\n\n[[File:Logo snte.png|600px|thumb|left|Logo of the National Union of Education Workers]]\n[[File:Musee_National_Anthropologie-Entree.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[National Museum of Anthropology]] the largest and most visited museum in Mexico opened in 1964.]]\nIn 1968, when Mexico hosted the Olympic Games in the capital, there were widespread demonstrations against spending so much on such an event, when there were higher national priorities.  University students participated in a major way in these demonstrations, with the government reacting violently in the [[Tlatelolco massacre]] of October 1968. In June 1971, there was further student activism in Mexico City that resulted in more violent government repression, known as the [[Corpus Christi massacre]]. Recognizing that failures in the educational system was a cause of the 1968 student activism, the government of [[Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz]] (1964\u20131970) attempted to implement educational reform as part of a wider social reform. The government sought to reach Mexicans who had not had access to education previously and the use of radio and television were seen as ways to do this. Adult education became a focus of the expansion. With the presidency of [[Luis Echeverr\u00eda]] (1970\u20131976), the expansion included the use of [[telenovela]]s (soap operas) to shape public understandings, and Mexico became a pioneer in the use of this medium for policy matters. Better health care in earlier years had resulted in a population boom as infant mortality declined and fertility increased. With Catholic Church opposition to birth control, the secular format of telenovela were a means to bring a message of the benefits of family planning to women.<ref>Gabriela Soto Laveaga, \"'Let's become fewer': Soap operas, contraception, and nationalizing the Mexican family in an overpopulated world.\" ''Sexuality Research and Social Policy'' September 2007, vol. 4 no. 3.</ref>  The government sought to strengthen higher education particularly in the sciences and technology, establishing [[Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (Mexico)|the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT)]] in 1970. It funds fellowships for graduate students to study abroad to increase their specialized knowledge. Despite sustained government efforts over several presidential administrations, Mexican education had not significantly affected low education levels and high levels of illiteracy in the country, especially in rural areas. President [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo]] (1976\u20131982) created a National Literacy Program (''Pronalf'') in 1980 and then established an independent institute for adult education (Instituto Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n para Adultos INEA).<ref>Torres Septi\u00e9n, \"Education: 1940\u20131996\" pp. 448\u201348</ref>  With the collapse of the Mexican economy during the oil crisis of 1982, educational reform awaited economic recovery.\n\n[[File:DeniseDresserG.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Noted commentator and political science professor [[Denise Dresser]].

Adopting [[neoliberal]] economic policies to promote development, Salinas saw education as a key factor.<ref>Lorey, David E. \"Education and the challenges of Mexican development.\" Challenge 38.2 (1995): 51\u201355.</ref>  In an accord with the SNTE, education was decentralized from its control by the Ministry of Public Education (SEP) and came under the control of Mexican state government. Curriculum reform was also undertaken by the SEP, which included the creation of new textbooks.  Protests resulted in the government's withdrawing the textbooks.<ref>Dennis Gilbert, \"Rewriting History: Salinas, Zedillo and the 1992 Textbook Controversy\", ''Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos'',  Vol. 13  No. 2,  Summer, 1997; (pp. 271\u2013297) DOI: 10.2307/1052017</ref> A third component of the accord was the creation of a system of merit pay for teachers.<ref>Hecock, R.
