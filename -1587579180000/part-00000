Each year almost 500,000 people are entertained by the band, which plays at home football at [[Sun Devil Stadium]] and as a pep band for basketball games at [[Wells Fargo Arena (Tempe)|Wells Fargo Arena]], homecoming, bowl game parades, other community events in the Valley, across the country, and even abroad.\n\n==History==\nOn September 20, 1915, the Arizona Board of Education accepted and ratified the creation of the Tempe Bulldogs Marching Band under Mrs. Lillian Williams (1915\u20131917).<ref name=\"library.lib.asu.edu\">http://library.lib.asu.edu/record=b1709820~S3</ref> Under her guidance she furnished on her own the band's instruments, uniforms, and repertoire of standard classical music. The Bulldogs Marching Band though would be discontinued due to [[World War I]]. Williams last appearance was during 1947 concert as then Sun Devil Marching Band director Felix E. McKernan honored her. The Bulldogs Marching Band return in 1929 under short tenure of the direction of John Paul Jones. In transition under the direction of Carl G. Hoyer in 1937 the band's first bowl appearance for the Tournament of Roses Parade where the band won second prize. Though that year Hoyer would leave after then Arizona governor, [[Benjamin Baker Moeur]], rejected his Arizona State Song for the state song of Arizona. During Dr. Robert G. Lyon five-year tenure was the addition of new parade and marching formations as well as [[swing music]]. Under Felix E. McKernan direction saw the various changes taken place for the band and the school. In 1946, the school's, mascot was redesigned by former [[Disney]] illustrator, Bert Anthony, from the Bulldog to [[Sparky the Sun Devil|Sparky, the Sun Devil]]. McKernan made his marks in the band by composing the school's fight song [[Maroon & Gold]], implementing script drill formations in pregame and halftime shows, holding auditions for instrumentation placing, offering scholarships to boost membership, recruiting high school band members, establishing [[Band Day]], and formatting three weekly rehearsals. All of which laid the basis for band to grow rapidly. The band's growing reputation brought a lot of praise from directors across the nation such as Clarence Sawhill (1947\u20131952) of the [[Spirit of Troy|USC Trojan Band]] proclaimed the band as \"The Best Marching Band in the Southwest.\"<ref name=\"library.lib.asu.edu\"/>  McKernan's successor, Harold C. Hines, as well added to McKernan's body of work by holding band camp a week before the Fall semester begins, additions to pregame pageantry, 1957 implementing fireworks, band's active role in Proposition 200 in 1958 for university status, and establishing the Alumni Band for Homecoming Games. August 1974 initiated a new period in the history of the Sun Devil Band program with the hiring of two new directors. The two men brought a new style of marching and philosophy to ASU's band program. Dr. Richard E. \"Doc\" Strange (1974\u20131999) became Director of Bands and brought (now) Dr. Robert C. \"Coach\" Fleming (1974\u20132002) as Assistant Director of Bands; this position was ultimately elevated to Associate Director of Bands, and is now designated Director of Athletic Bands. The Marching Band gained national recognition by performing at the 1987 and 1997 Rose Bowl games and [[Tournament of Roses Parade]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tournamentofroses.com/photogallery/RBGtimeline/1980sb.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-07-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5iUFWe141?url=http://www.tournamentofroses.com/photogallery/RBGtimeline/1980sb.htm |archive-date=2009-07-23 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tournamentofroses.com/photogallery/RBGtimeline/1990sb.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-10-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023045828/http://www.tournamentofroses.com/photogallery/RBGtimeline/1990sb.htm |archive-date=2008-10-23 |df= }}</ref> Also to the band's credit are performances at [[Arizona Cardinals]], [[San Francisco 49ers]], the then [[Los Angeles Raiders]] and [[Los Angeles Rams]] professional football games, [[Phoenix Suns]] professional basketball games, [[SeaWorld]], [[Knott's Berry Farm]], [[Disneyland]], [[Universal Studios]], [[SeaWorld San Diego]], on the deck of the Navy carrier [[USS Ranger (CV-61)]], and the 1990 [[Coca-Cola Bowl]] in Tokyo, Japan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music.asu.edu/sundevilband/history/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-07-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715040953/http://music.asu.edu/sundevilband/history/ |archive-date=2009-07-15 |df= }}</ref> Of note during the San Francisco 49er gig fans were impressed by the Sun Devil Marching Band rendition of George Cory's [[I Left My Heart in San Francisco]] the franchise insisted on the band making a 1963 recording and continued on using it at 49ers home games.

In order to receive one credit hour for the class for full-time ASU students and non-degree community college students seeking the credit, enrollment in the class is required in order to obtain the credit hour. For individuals interested in participating in the Sun Devil Marching Band, but are not considered full-time degree seeking students at ASU are required to apply to ASU as non-degree students in order to register for the course. Currently an alternate \u201cregistration\u201d route is offered for those who will only be registered for the marching band course(s), giving them the opportunity to participate in the Sun Devil Marching Band without incurring full tuition costs. Undergraduate music education majors in the School of Music are required to achieve 2 credit hours of marching band to fulfill the School of Music requirements. Color Guard, Spirit Squad and Percussion have an additional class to add for one credit hour.\n\n===The Fight Songs===\n[[File:BlockADrillFormation.jpg|thumb|2007 SDMB Block A Formation during Pregame]]\n{{Main|Maroon & Gold}}\n\n\"Maroon & Gold\", ASU\u2019s fight song, is a familiar tune for Sun Devils all over the country, but is not the only \"fight song\" at ASU. In 1940, during World War II, Fred Waring composed a piece for the Arizona State College called \"Fight, Arizona State (March On, Arizona)\" which had become lost in history until 2015 when director James G. Hudson discovered it in the archives. He arranged it to be a part of the pregame show during the band program's 100th anniversary. Also in the 1940s, band director Albert Davis wrote \"Go, Go Sun Devils\" (more commonly known to the band as \"The Al Davis Fight Song\"); to this day, though Davis retired in the 1950s, the Sun Devil Marching Band continues to play the Al Davis Fight Song in their pregame performance as the Sun Devils come out of the tunnel onto the field, and occasionally make up humorous lyrics.\n\nAnother fight song that was written for the school but used sparingly was the song penned by former ASU President, G. Homer Durham. It was called \"Sing a Song for ASU\" and was last used at homecomings in the very early 1970s.\n\n=== Stand Tunes Repertoire ===\n\nThe band not only performs during pregame and halftime of the football games, but also in the stands. The music in the stands is a combination of short and long tunes to help keep the energy in the stadium and keep the crowd excited. Songs used for stand tunes include popular past and contemporary songs from many genres of music. One such example is the excerpt from \"The Imperial March (Darth Vader's Theme)\" that the band plays when ASU's defense takes the field.\n\n===Special Appearance Performances===\nIn the 2006 and 2007 seasons the band had opportunities of bringing in guest appearances of nationally and world-renowned recording artists for halftime performances.\n\n*Horn-based soul band [[Tower of Power]] performing their hits [[Bump City|You're Still a Young Man]]/ [[Soul Vaccination: Live|Diggin' on James Brown]] and [[Tower of PSo]] \"[[So Very Hard to Go]]\" / \"What is Hip?\" during November 18, 2006 game against [[UCLA Bruins]]<ref name=\"arizonastate.rivals.com\">http://arizonastate.rivals.com/content.asp?CID=708677</ref>\n* Rendition of [[Juan Tizol| Juan Tizol's]] [[Caravan (1937 song)|Caravan]] with The [[Boston Brass]] quintet during the October 13, 2007 game against [[Washington Huskies]]<ref name=\"arizonastate.rivals.com\"/>\n*Musical legend and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member [[Little Richard]] performing his hits [[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]; Jenny, Jenny; and [[Good Golly Miss Molly]] during Thanksgiving Day November 22, 2007 game against [[USC Trojans]]<ref>http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/102589{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>\n* [[Journey (band)|Journey]] founding member and lead guitarist [[Neal Schon]] accompanied by long-time keyboardist and backing vocalist [[Jonathan Cain]] performed the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|National Anthem]] before the September 28, 2013 game against [[USC Trojans]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thesundevils.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=30300&ATCLID=209267820 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-10-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005011523/http://www.thesundevils.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=30300&ATCLID=209267820 |archive-date=2013-10-05 |df= }}</ref>\n* Medley of [[Duke Ellington]] jazz standards with The [[Boston Brass]] during the football season opener against [[Northern Arizona University]] on September 3, 2016\n\n==Arizona State University Band Day==\nThe first [[Band Day]] was held on December 4, 1948 in conjunction with the 1948 Homecoming.

High school bands from all over the state of Arizona come to play for judges and their peers.  About 50+ high school bands perform, followed by the Sun Devil Marching Band. There is a morning block for one half of the bands to perform and a night block known as Sun Devil Showdown of the rest of the bands to perform which makes Band Day an all-day event, as well as making ASU Band Day the biggest marching band competition in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music.asu.edu/sundevilband/bandday/information.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-08-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026205729/http://music.asu.edu/sundevilband/bandday/information.php |archive-date=2009-10-26 |df= }}</ref> For the 2008 Band Day, the top high school band, [[Mountain View High School (Mesa)|Mesa Mountain View Toro Band]] won the first Dr. Robert \"Coach\" Fleming Outstanding Band Award in honor of the Sun Devil Marching Band's eleventh band director.

Providing a central point to tempo and beat by conducting on the sideline are the four Drum Majors. The hornline is divided into two major groups: woodwinds and brass. In addition to the hornline, the band also uses a percussion section that is divided into a marching battery of drums and a stationary sideline pit. With presence of a pit as part of the percussion section, it makes the Sun Devil Devil Marching Band one of the few college marching bands to field a pit.

The Bulldogs Marching Band though would be discontinued due to [[World War I]]. Williams last appearance was during 1947 concert as then Sun Devil Marching Band director Felix E. McKernan honored her. The Bulldogs Marching Band return in 1929 under short tenure of the direction of John Paul Jones. In transition under the direction of Carl G. Hoyer in 1937 the band's first bowl appearance for the Tournament of Roses Parade where the band won second prize. Though that year Hoyer would leave after then Arizona governor, [[Benjamin Baker Moeur]], rejected his Arizona State Song for the state song of Arizona. During Dr. Robert G. Lyon five-year tenure was the addition of new parade and marching formations as well as [[swing music]]. Under Felix E. McKernan direction saw the various changes taken place for the band and the school. In 1946, the school's, mascot was redesigned by former [[Disney]] illustrator, Bert Anthony, from the Bulldog to [[Sparky the Sun Devil|Sparky, the Sun Devil]]. McKernan made his marks in the band by composing the school's fight song [[Maroon & Gold]], implementing script drill formations in pregame and halftime shows, holding auditions for instrumentation placing, offering scholarships to boost membership, recruiting high school band members, establishing [[Band Day]], and formatting three weekly rehearsals. All of which laid the basis for band to grow rapidly. The band's growing reputation brought a lot of praise from directors across the nation such as Clarence Sawhill (1947\u20131952) of the [[Spirit of Troy|USC Trojan Band]] proclaimed the band as \"The Best Marching Band in the Southwest.\"<ref name=\"library.lib.asu.edu\"/>  McKernan's successor, Harold C. Hines, as well added to McKernan's body of work by holding band camp a week before the Fall semester begins, additions to pregame pageantry, 1957 implementing fireworks, band's active role in Proposition 200 in 1958 for university status, and establishing the Alumni Band for Homecoming Games. August 1974 initiated a new period in the history of the Sun Devil Band program with the hiring of two new directors. The two men brought a new style of marching and philosophy to ASU's band program. Dr. Richard E. \"Doc\" Strange (1974\u20131999) became Director of Bands and brought (now) Dr. Robert C. \"Coach\" Fleming (1974\u20132002) as Assistant Director of Bands; this position was ultimately elevated to Associate Director of Bands, and is now designated Director of Athletic Bands.

In order to receive one credit hour for the class for full-time ASU students and non-degree community college students seeking the credit, enrollment in the class is required in order to obtain the credit hour. For individuals interested in participating in the Sun Devil Marching Band, but are not considered full-time degree seeking students at ASU are required to apply to ASU as non-degree students in order to register for the course. Currently an alternate \u201cregistration\u201d route is offered for those who will only be registered for the marching band course(s), giving them the opportunity to participate in the Sun Devil Marching Band without incurring full tuition costs. Undergraduate music education majors in the School of Music are required to achieve 2 credit hours of marching band to fulfill the School of Music requirements. Color Guard, Spirit Squad and Percussion have an additional class to add for one credit hour.\n\n===The Fight Songs===\n[[File:BlockADrillFormation.jpg|thumb|2007 SDMB Block A Formation during Pregame]]\n{{Main|Maroon & Gold}}\n\n\"Maroon & Gold\", ASU\u2019s fight song, is a familiar tune for Sun Devils all over the country, but is not the only \"fight song\" at ASU. In 1940, during World War II, Fred Waring composed a piece for the Arizona State College called \"Fight, Arizona State (March On, Arizona)\" which had become lost in history until 2015 when director James G. Hudson discovered it in the archives. He arranged it to be a part of the pregame show during the band program's 100th anniversary. Also in the 1940s, band director Albert Davis wrote \"Go, Go Sun Devils\" (more commonly known to the band as \"The Al Davis Fight Song\"); to this day, though Davis retired in the 1950s, the Sun Devil Marching Band continues to play the Al Davis Fight Song in their pregame performance as the Sun Devils come out of the tunnel onto the field, and occasionally make up humorous lyrics.\n\nAnother fight song that was written for the school but used sparingly was the song penned by former ASU President, G. Homer Durham. It was called \"Sing a Song for ASU\" and was last used at homecomings in the very early 1970s.\n\n=== Stand Tunes Repertoire ===\n\nThe band not only performs during pregame and halftime of the football games, but also in the stands. The music in the stands is a combination of short and long tunes to help keep the energy in the stadium and keep the crowd excited. Songs used for stand tunes include popular past and contemporary songs from many genres of music. One such example is the excerpt from \"The Imperial March (Darth Vader's Theme)\" that the band plays when ASU's defense takes the field.\n\n===Special Appearance Performances===\nIn the 2006 and 2007 seasons the band had opportunities of bringing in guest appearances of nationally and world-renowned recording artists for halftime performances.\n\n*Horn-based soul band [[Tower of Power]] performing their hits [[Bump City|You're Still a Young Man]]/ [[Soul Vaccination: Live|Diggin' on James Brown]] and [[Tower of PSo]] \"[[So Very Hard to Go]]\" / \"What is Hip?\" during November 18, 2006 game against [[UCLA Bruins]]<ref name=\"arizonastate.rivals.com\">http://arizonastate.rivals.com/content.asp?CID=708677</ref>\n* Rendition of [[Juan Tizol| Juan Tizol's]] [[Caravan (1937 song)|Caravan]] with The [[Boston Brass]] quintet during the October 13, 2007 game against [[Washington Huskies]]<ref name=\"arizonastate.rivals.com\"/>\n*Musical legend and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member [[Little Richard]] performing his hits [[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]; Jenny, Jenny; and [[Good Golly Miss Molly]] during Thanksgiving Day November 22, 2007 game against [[USC Trojans]]<ref>http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/102589{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>\n* [[Journey (band)|Journey]] founding member and lead guitarist [[Neal Schon]] accompanied by long-time keyboardist and backing vocalist [[Jonathan Cain]] performed the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|National Anthem]] before the September 28, 2013 game against [[USC Trojans]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thesundevils.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=30300&ATCLID=209267820 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-10-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005011523/http://www.thesundevils.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=30300&ATCLID=209267820 |archive-date=2013-10-05 |df= }}</ref>\n* Medley of [[Duke Ellington]] jazz standards with The [[Boston Brass]] during the football season opener against [[Northern Arizona University]] on September 3, 2016\n\n==Arizona State University Band Day==\nThe first [[Band Day]] was held on December 4, 1948 in conjunction with the 1948 Homecoming. Since then, the ASU Sun Devil Marching Band hosts its Band Day on the football team's road game or bye week at Sun Devil Stadium. High school bands from all over the state of Arizona come to play for judges and their peers.  About 50+ high school bands perform, followed by the Sun Devil Marching Band. There is a morning block for one half of the bands to perform and a night block known as Sun Devil Showdown of the rest of the bands to perform which makes Band Day an all-day event, as well as making ASU Band Day the biggest marching band competition in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music.asu.edu/sundevilband/bandday/information.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-08-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026205729/http://music.asu.edu/sundevilband/bandday/information.php |archive-date=2009-10-26 |df= }}</ref> For the 2008 Band Day, the top high school band, [[Mountain View High School (Mesa)|Mesa Mountain View Toro Band]] won the first Dr. Robert \"Coach\" Fleming Outstanding Band Award in honor of the Sun Devil Marching Band's eleventh band director.

One arm of the jacket is maroon, while the other is gold. White gauntlets fastened with suns, and white gloves using Velcro finish the sleeves. A cape with the ASU lettering is added to the ensemble as a throwback to capes worn by the band in years past.  The pants are purely black, rising to about chest level with the aid of suspenders.

Providing a central point to tempo and beat by conducting on the sideline are the four Drum Majors. The hornline is divided into two major groups: woodwinds and brass. In addition to the hornline, the band also uses a percussion section that is divided into a marching battery of drums and a stationary sideline pit. With presence of a pit as part of the percussion section, it makes the Sun Devil Devil Marching Band one of the few college marching bands to field a pit. The other [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]] marching band currently fielding a pit is the [[Oregon Marching Band]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music.asu.edu/sundevilband/history/instrumentation.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-08-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611212652/http://music.asu.edu/sundevilband/history/instrumentation.php |archive-date=2010-06-11 |df= }}</ref> The bottom bass drum in the battery section was known as \"thumper\".

(Rossum's Universal Robots)|R.U.R.]]'' in 1920. While it is frequently thought that he was the originator of the word, he wrote a short letter in reference to an article in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' [[etymology]] in which he named his brother, painter and writer [[Josef \u010capek]], as its actual inventor.<ref>[http://capek.misto.cz/english/robot.html Karel Capek&nbsp;\u2013 Who did actually invent the word \"robot\" and what does it mean?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204135259/http://capek.misto.cz/english/robot.html |date=February 4, 2012 }} at capek.misto.cz</ref><ref>[[Ivan Margolius]],'The Robot of Prague',  Newsletter, The Friends of Czech Heritage no. 17, Autumn 2017, pp. 3 - 6.  https://czechfriends.net/images/RobotsMargoliusJul2017.pdf</ref> In an article in the Czech journal ''[[Lidov\u00e9 noviny]]'' in 1933, he also explained that he had originally wanted to call the creatures ''labo\u0159i'' (from Latin ''labor'', work). However, he did not like the word, seeing it as too artificial, and sought advice from his brother Josef, who suggested ''roboti'' (''robots'' in English).\n\nThe word ''robot'' comes from the word ''robota''. The word robota means literally \"[[corv\u00e9e]]\", \"serf labor\", and figuratively \"drudgery\" or \"hard work\" in Czech. It also means \"work\", \"labor\" in Slovak, archaic Czech, and many other Slavic languages (e.g., Bulgarian, Russian, Serbian, Polish, Macedonian, Ukrainian, etc.). It derives from the reconstructed [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] word [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/orbota|*orbota]], meaning \"work, hard work, obligatory work for the king, or a short form used for plowing\".\n\n==Awards and honors==\nThe asteroid [[1931 \u010capek]], discovered by [[Lubo\u0161 Kohoutek]] was named after him.<ref name=\"springer\">{{cite book |title = Dictionary of Minor Planet Names \u2013 (1931) \u010capek  |last  = Schmadel | first = Lutz |publisher  = [[Springer Berlin Heidelberg]]  |page  = 155  |date  = 2007 |isbn  = 978-3-540-00238-3|doi  = 10.1007/978-3-540-29925-7_1932 |chapter  = (1931) \u010capek }}</ref>\n\n\u010capek received the [[Order of Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk]],  in memoriam, in 1991.\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n=== Plays ===\n* 1920&nbsp;\u2013 ''The Outlaw'' (''Loupe\u017en\u00edk'')\n* 1920&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[R.U.R.]]'' (''Rossum's Universal Robots'') or meaning (''Intelligent Universal Robots''), (''Rossumovi univerz\u00e1ln\u00ed roboti'')&nbsp;\u2013 play with one of the first examples of artificial intelligence human-like beings in art and literature.\n* 1921&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[Pictures from the Insects' Life]]'' (''Ze \u017eivota hmyzu''), also known as ''The Insect Play'' or ''The Life of the Insects'', with Josef \u010capek, a satire in which insects stand in for various human characteristics: the flighty, vain [[butterfly]], the obsequious, self-serving [[dung beetle]].\n* 1922&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Makropulos Affair]]'' (''V\u011bc Makropulos'')&nbsp;\u2013 play about human immortality, not really from a science-fiction point of view.
