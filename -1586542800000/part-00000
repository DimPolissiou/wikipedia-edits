Several small settlements on the West Bank of the Mississippi River north of [[Fort Jackson, Louisiana|Fort Jackson]] became known collectively as the Quartiers des Burats, the Burat Settlement, anchored on the property of Sebastian Burat, near where Cazezu Boulevard meets Parish Highway 11 today. Burat was later anglicized to Buras. In 1854, the Buras Post Office was established, along with a regular mail route by packet boat on the river. By 1864, a new church, Our Lady of Good Harbor, was established in Buras as the community grew.\n\n=== Civil War ===\nIn April 1862, during the [[American Civil War]], the [[Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip]] took place near Buras. Union Flag Officer [[David Farragut]] led a fleet up the river to capture New Orleans and engaged the forts in the early morning hours of April 23. A single Union vessel, the [[USS Varuna (1861)|USS ''Varuna'']], was sunk near Buras in an engagement with the Confederate steamer ''[[CSS Governor Moore]]'' and the ''[[CSS Stonewall Jackson]]''. The heavily damaged ''Governor Moore'' also sank, not far from its Union opponent.\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn first decades of the 20th century, Buras' primary industries were oyster fishing and citrus farming. In the 1930s, petroleum was discovered in the region, along with natural gas and sulfur. One of the first producing fields was established in Quarantine Bay, east of Buras, by Gulf Oil Company. With the coming of the oil and gas industries, Buras began to slowly evolve from a farming and fishing village into a larger community.\n\n=== Hurricanes ===\n\nBuras-Triumph and the surrounding communities have been subjected to many devastating hurricanes over the years, including the [[1893 Cheniere Caminada hurricane]], which destroyed the original church, the [[1901 Louisiana hurricane]], the [[1915 New Orleans hurricane]], [[Hurricane Betsy]] in 1965, and [[Hurricane Camille]] in 1969.\n\nMore recently, this area was the location where, on August 29, 2005, the eye of [[Hurricane Katrina]] first made landfall in Louisiana. Although Katrina was one of the costliest natural disasters to strike the U.S., according to the Hurricane Severity Index, at landfall both Betsy and Camille were higher-intensity hurricanes than Katrina. However, the loss of surrounding marsh lands to erosion and [[subsidence]] allowed the energy of Hurricane Katrina's [[storm surge]] to overtop the [[levee]] system and the area was devastated yet again.\n\nEmblematic of the rebuilding and recovery is the new Buras water tower. The image of the previous tower, collapsed in the rubble, was an icon of the destruction Katrina brought. (See photos.)\n\n==Geography==\nBuras-Triumph is located along the west bank of the [[Mississippi River]] at {{Coord|29|21|6|N|89|30|50|W|type:city}} (29.351783, -89.513815)<ref name=\"GR1\" /> and has an elevation of {{convert|3|ft|m|0}}.<ref name=\"GR3\">{{cite web|url=http://geonames.usgs.gov|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=US Board on Geographic Names|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=2007-10-25}}</ref> Buras-Triumph is within the federal hurricane protection levee system.

The population was 3,358 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. For the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], Buras-Triumph was split into the CDPs of [[Buras, Louisiana|Buras]] and [[Triumph, Louisiana|Triumph]].<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> On the peninsula, Buras has been located higher, with Triumph located southeast of Buras.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed|date=July 2014}}\nThe town of Buras was established, informally, in the 1840s. Several small settlements on the West Bank of the Mississippi River north of [[Fort Jackson, Louisiana|Fort Jackson]] became known collectively as the Quartiers des Burats, the Burat Settlement, anchored on the property of Sebastian Burat, near where Cazezu Boulevard meets Parish Highway 11 today. Burat was later anglicized to Buras. In 1854, the Buras Post Office was established, along with a regular mail route by packet boat on the river. By 1864, a new church, Our Lady of Good Harbor, was established in Buras as the community grew.\n\n=== Civil War ===\nIn April 1862, during the [[American Civil War]], the [[Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip]] took place near Buras. Union Flag Officer [[David Farragut]] led a fleet up the river to capture New Orleans and engaged the forts in the early morning hours of April 23. A single Union vessel, the [[USS Varuna (1861)|USS ''Varuna'']], was sunk near Buras in an engagement with the Confederate steamer ''[[CSS Governor Moore]]'' and the ''[[CSS Stonewall Jackson]]''. The heavily damaged ''Governor Moore'' also sank, not far from its Union opponent.\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn first decades of the 20th century, Buras' primary industries were oyster fishing and citrus farming. In the 1930s, petroleum was discovered in the region, along with natural gas and sulfur. One of the first producing fields was established in Quarantine Bay, east of Buras, by Gulf Oil Company. With the coming of the oil and gas industries, Buras began to slowly evolve from a farming and fishing village into a larger community.\n\n=== Hurricanes ===\n\nBuras-Triumph and the surrounding communities have been subjected to many devastating hurricanes over the years, including the [[1893 Cheniere Caminada hurricane]], which destroyed the original church, the [[1901 Louisiana hurricane]], the [[1915 New Orleans hurricane]], [[Hurricane Betsy]] in 1965, and [[Hurricane Camille]] in 1969.\n\nMore recently, this area was the location where, on August 29, 2005, the eye of [[Hurricane Katrina]] first made landfall in Louisiana. Although Katrina was one of the costliest natural disasters to strike the U.S., according to the Hurricane Severity Index, at landfall both Betsy and Camille were higher-intensity hurricanes than Katrina. However, the loss of surrounding marsh lands to erosion and [[subsidence]] allowed the energy of Hurricane Katrina's [[storm surge]] to overtop the [[levee]] system and the area was devastated yet again.\n\nEmblematic of the rebuilding and recovery is the new Buras water tower. The image of the previous tower, collapsed in the rubble, was an icon of the destruction Katrina brought. (See photos.)\n\n==Geography==\nBuras-Triumph is located along the west bank of the [[Mississippi River]] at {{Coord|29|21|6|N|89|30|50|W|type:city}} (29.351783, -89.513815)<ref name=\"GR1\" /> and has an elevation of {{convert|3|ft|m|0}}.<ref name=\"GR3\">{{cite web|url=http://geonames.usgs.gov|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=US Board on Geographic Names|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=2007-10-25}}</ref> Buras-Triumph is within the federal hurricane protection levee system.

{"title_page": "Calkin\u2013Wilf tree", "text_new": "{{multiple image|image1=Calkin\u2013Wilf tree.svg|caption1=The Calkin\u2013Wilf tree|width1=300|image2=Calkin-Wilf tree children from parent.gif|caption2=How values are derived from their parent|width2=175}}\n[[File:Kepler Tree-original.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The tree from [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler's]] ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' (1619)]]\nIn [[number theory]], the '''Calkin\u2013Wilf tree''' is a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] in which the vertices correspond [[bijection|one-to-one]] to the [[positive number|positive]] [[rational number]]s. The tree is rooted at the number 1, and any rational number expressed in simplest terms as the [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} has as its two children the numbers {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''a'' + ''b''}}}} and {{math|{{sfrac|''a'' + ''b''|''b''}}}}. Every positive rational number appears exactly once in the tree.\n\nThe sequence of rational numbers in a [[breadth-first search|breadth-first traversal]] of the Calkin\u2013Wilf tree is known as the '''Calkin\u2013Wilf sequence'''. Its sequence of numerators (or, offset by one, denominators) is '''Stern's diatomic series''', and can be computed by the '''fusc function'''.\n\nThe Calkin\u2013Wilf tree is named after Neil Calkin and [[Herbert Wilf]], who considered it in their 2000 paper. The tree was introduced earlier by [[Jean Berstel]] and Aldo de Luca<ref>{{harvtxt|Berstel|de Luca|1997}}, Section 6.</ref> as ''Raney tree'', since they drew some ideas from a paper by George N. Raney.<ref>{{harvtxt|Raney|1973}}.</ref> Stern's diatomic series was formulated much earlier by [[Moritz Abraham Stern]], a 19th-century German mathematician who also invented the closely related [[Stern\u2013Brocot tree]]. Even earlier, a similar tree appears in [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler's]] ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' (1619).<ref>{{citation|first=J.|last=Kepler|authorlink=Johannes Kepler|title=Harmonices Mundi|volume=III|page=27|url=https://archive.org/stream/ioanniskepplerih00kepl#page/26/mode/2up|year=1619}}.</ref>\n\n==Definition and structure==\n[[File:Calkin-Wilf tree.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|The Calkin\u2013Wilf tree, drawn using an [[H tree]] layout.]]\nThe Calkin\u2013Wilf tree may be defined as a directed graph in which each positive rational number {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} occurs as a vertex and has one outgoing edge to another vertex, its parent. We assume that {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} is in simplest terms; that is, the [[greatest common divisor]] of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is 1. If {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} < 1}}, the parent of {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} is {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b'' \u2212 ''a''}}}}; if {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} > 1}}, the parent of {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} is {{math|{{sfrac|''a'' \u2212 ''b''|''b''}}}}. Thus, in either case, the parent is a fraction with a smaller sum of numerator and denominator, so repeated reduction of this type must eventually reach the number 1. As a graph with one outgoing edge per vertex and one root reachable by all other vertices, the Calkin\u2013Wilf tree must indeed be a tree.\n\nThe children of any vertex in the Calkin\u2013Wilf tree may be computed by inverting the formula for the parents of a vertex. Each vertex {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} has one child whose value is less than 1, {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''a'' + ''b''}}}}, because this is the only value less than 1 whose parent formula leads back to {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}}.

The tree is rooted at the number 1, and any rational number expressed in simplest terms as the [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} has as its two children the numbers {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''a'' + ''b''}}}} and {{math|{{sfrac|''a'' + ''b''|''b''}}}}. Every positive rational number appears exactly once in the tree.\n\nThe sequence of rational numbers in a [[breadth-first search|breadth-first traversal]] of the Calkin\u2013Wilf tree is known as the '''Calkin\u2013Wilf sequence'''. Its sequence of numerators (or, offset by one, denominators) is '''Stern's diatomic series''', and can be computed by the '''fusc function'''.\n\nThe Calkin\u2013Wilf tree is named after Neil Calkin and [[Herbert Wilf]], who considered it in their 2000 paper. The tree was introduced earlier by [[Jean Berstel]] and Aldo de Luca<ref>{{harvtxt|Berstel|de Luca|1997}}, Section 6.</ref> as ''Raney tree'', since they drew some ideas from a paper by George N. Raney.<ref>{{harvtxt|Raney|1973}}.</ref> Stern's diatomic series was formulated much earlier by [[Moritz Abraham Stern]], a 19th-century German mathematician who also invented the closely related [[Stern\u2013Brocot tree]]. Even earlier, a similar tree appears in [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler's]] ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' (1619).<ref>{{citation|first=J.|last=Kepler|authorlink=Johannes Kepler|title=Harmonices Mundi|volume=III|page=27|url=https://archive.org/stream/ioanniskepplerih00kepl#page/26/mode/2up|year=1619}}.</ref>\n\n==Definition and structure==\n[[File:Calkin-Wilf tree.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|The Calkin\u2013Wilf tree, drawn using an [[H tree]] layout.]]\nThe Calkin\u2013Wilf tree may be defined as a directed graph in which each positive rational number {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} occurs as a vertex and has one outgoing edge to another vertex, its parent. We assume that {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} is in simplest terms; that is, the [[greatest common divisor]] of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is 1. If {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} < 1}}, the parent of {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} is {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b'' \u2212 ''a''}}}}; if {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} > 1}}, the parent of {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} is {{math|{{sfrac|''a'' \u2212 ''b''|''b''}}}}. Thus, in either case, the parent is a fraction with a smaller sum of numerator and denominator, so repeated reduction of this type must eventually reach the number 1. As a graph with one outgoing edge per vertex and one root reachable by all other vertices, the Calkin\u2013Wilf tree must indeed be a tree.\n\nThe children of any vertex in the Calkin\u2013Wilf tree may be computed by inverting the formula for the parents of a vertex. Each vertex {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} has one child whose value is less than 1, {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''a'' + ''b''}}}}, because this is the only value less than 1 whose parent formula leads back to {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}}. Similarly, each vertex {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} has one child whose value is greater than 1, {{math|{{sfrac|''a'' + ''b''|''b''}}}}.<ref>The description here is dual to the original definition by Calkin and Wilf, which begins by defining the child relationship and derives the parent relationship as part of a proof that every rational appears once in the tree.

It is serves part of [[Leith]], formerly an independent [[burgh]] and since 1920 a part of the city of [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]].\n\n==Building==\n[[File:The portico at North Leith Parish Church.jpg|thumb|The portico at North Leith Parish Church]]\nThe current building in Madeira Street (at the junction with Prince Regent Street), Leith, was designed by the architect [[William Burn]] and was completed in 1816. It has a notable neo-classical portico (with four large [[Ionic columns]]), above which is a clock tower surmounted by a slender [[spire]]. A [[pipe organ]] (by Wadsworth of [[Manchester]]) was added in 1880. The building was damaged by bombing during [[World War II]] (in 1941), but was repaired by 1950. It is a category A [[listed building]].<ref name=lbr>{{Historic Environment Scotland|num=LB27134|desc=51 Madeira Street, North Leith Parish Church with Burial Enclosure, Hall and Beadle's House, (1a Madeira Place) Gates, Railings and Boundary Wall; EH6 4AX|cat=A|access-date=18 March 2019}}</ref> The church was designed to accommodate 1300 people.<ref>1854 OS map</ref>\n\nWilliam Burn was also responsible for several other notable buildings in Edinburgh, including the [[Edinburgh Academy]] and John Watson's College (now the [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art]]).\n\nThe associated manse (presumably also by Burn) and known as \"Leith Mount\", stood on a substantial plot to the south-east of the church, on Ferry Road. The manse and its gardens and orchards were removed in 1920 to provide the site for [[Leith Theatre]].<ref>OS maps 1845 to 1945</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:St Ninian's Manse.jpg|thumb|250px|St Ninian's Manse incorporates the tower of the 17th-century former parish church]]\nThe church connection dates to 1128, when King [[David I of Scotland]] granted lands for the construction of [[Holyrood Abbey]]. In 1493 Robert Bellenden, [[Abbot of Holyrood]], built St Ninian's Chapel on the north-west bank of the [[Water of Leith]], on lands owned by the Abbey.<ref name=ninian>{{Historic Environment Scotland|num=LB27395|desc=3-9 Quayside Street, Quayside Mills (Mcgregor & Co) incorporating former Manse, remains of St Ninian's Church, Tenement, Granary and Mill; EH6 6EJ|cat=A|access-date=18 March 2019|fewer-links=yes}}</ref> The small chapel was subsequently rebuilt after the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]]. The replacement church opened in 1586, and later became the parish church of North Leith, which was created a ''[[Quoad sacra parish|quoad omnia]]'' parish, i.e. a civil and sacred [[parish]], by a resolution of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] in 1606. A Dutch-style tower was added in 1675. The discovery of rot in this building in the 18th century led to extensive renovation and the construction of galleries within the building, but the church remained too small for the congregation, leading to its replacement by the current building in 1816 (then in fields just outside the built-up part of Leith). The Dutch-style tower of the old church still stands, although it was later incorporated into a mill.<ref name=ninian/> In the old churchyard of St.Ninians stands the altar tomb of [[Thomas Gladstones]] (1732 - 1809), a prosperous Leith merchant, and the grandfather of the famous Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]]. Thomas Gladstones was a church elder for the 'Hill' district of Leith for over 40 years.<ref>Russell, John, ''The Story of Leith'', Edinburgh, 1922, p.177.</ref>\n\nAt the point of the [[Disruption of 1843]] North Leith parish was \"vacant\" (having no fixed minister) which seemed an encouragement to many to leave. North Leith Free Church was built on the corner of Coburg Street and North Junction Street, east of the church. 600 members of the congregation left, together with all the elders. The first minister was Rev William MacKenzie. The church could hold 1000 people. In 1857 [[Robert MacDonald (minister)|Rev Robert MacDonald]] replaced MacKenzie. He organised the building of a magnificent new free church on Ferry Road, south of the original church. This was completed in 1859 and could hold 1100 people. The 1844 site was redeveloped as tenements. The 1859 church was demolished in 1981. A datestone was salvaged and re-used in the current church halls.

It is serves part of [[Leith]], formerly an independent [[burgh]] and since 1920 a part of the city of [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]].\n\n==Building==\n[[File:The portico at North Leith Parish Church.jpg|thumb|The portico at North Leith Parish Church]]\nThe current building in Madeira Street (at the junction with Prince Regent Street), Leith, was designed by the architect [[William Burn]] and was completed in 1816. It has a notable neo-classical portico (with four large [[Ionic columns]]), above which is a clock tower surmounted by a slender [[spire]]. A [[pipe organ]] (by Wadsworth of [[Manchester]]) was added in 1880. The building was damaged by bombing during [[World War II]] (in 1941), but was repaired by 1950. It is a category A [[listed building]].<ref name=lbr>{{Historic Environment Scotland|num=LB27134|desc=51 Madeira Street, North Leith Parish Church with Burial Enclosure, Hall and Beadle's House, (1a Madeira Place) Gates, Railings and Boundary Wall; EH6 4AX|cat=A|access-date=18 March 2019}}</ref> The church was designed to accommodate 1300 people.<ref>1854 OS map</ref>\n\nWilliam Burn was also responsible for several other notable buildings in Edinburgh, including the [[Edinburgh Academy]] and John Watson's College (now the [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art]]).\n\nThe associated manse (presumably also by Burn) and known as \"Leith Mount\", stood on a substantial plot to the south-east of the church, on Ferry Road. The manse and its gardens and orchards were removed in 1920 to provide the site for [[Leith Theatre]].<ref>OS maps 1845 to 1945</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:St Ninian's Manse.jpg|thumb|250px|St Ninian's Manse incorporates the tower of the 17th-century former parish church]]\nThe church connection dates to 1128, when King [[David I of Scotland]] granted lands for the construction of [[Holyrood Abbey]]. In 1493 Robert Bellenden, [[Abbot of Holyrood]], built St Ninian's Chapel on the north-west bank of the [[Water of Leith]], on lands owned by the Abbey.<ref name=ninian>{{Historic Environment Scotland|num=LB27395|desc=3-9 Quayside Street, Quayside Mills (Mcgregor & Co) incorporating former Manse, remains of St Ninian's Church, Tenement, Granary and Mill; EH6 6EJ|cat=A|access-date=18 March 2019|fewer-links=yes}}</ref> The small chapel was subsequently rebuilt after the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]]. The replacement church opened in 1586, and later became the parish church of North Leith, which was created a ''[[Quoad sacra parish|quoad omnia]]'' parish, i.e. a civil and sacred [[parish]], by a resolution of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] in 1606. A Dutch-style tower was added in 1675. The discovery of rot in this building in the 18th century led to extensive renovation and the construction of galleries within the building, but the church remained too small for the congregation, leading to its replacement by the current building in 1816 (then in fields just outside the built-up part of Leith). The Dutch-style tower of the old church still stands, although it was later incorporated into a mill.<ref name=ninian/> In the old churchyard of St.Ninians stands the altar tomb of [[Thomas Gladstones]] (1732 - 1809), a prosperous Leith merchant, and the grandfather of the famous Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]]. Thomas Gladstones was a church elder for the 'Hill' district of Leith for over 40 years.<ref>Russell, John, ''The Story of Leith'', Edinburgh, 1922, p.177.</ref>\n\nAt the point of the [[Disruption of 1843]] North Leith parish was \"vacant\" (having no fixed minister) which seemed an encouragement to many to leave. North Leith Free Church was built on the corner of Coburg Street and North Junction Street, east of the church. 600 members of the congregation left, together with all the elders. The first minister was Rev William MacKenzie. The church could hold 1000 people. In 1857 [[Robert MacDonald (minister)|Rev Robert MacDonald]] replaced MacKenzie. He organised the building of a magnificent new free church on Ferry Road, south of the original church. This was completed in 1859 and could hold 1100 people. The 1844 site was redeveloped as tenements. The 1859 church was demolished in 1981. A datestone was salvaged and re-used in the current church halls. North Leith Free Church no longer exists in any form. Rev Robert MacDonald served as [[Moderator of the General Assembly]] for the Free Church in 1882.<ref>Ewing, William ''Annals of the Free Church''</ref>\n\nNorth Leith Parish Church united with [[Bonnington, Edinburgh|Bonnington]] Church in 1968, creating Leith North & Bonnington Church (using the Madeira Street building).
