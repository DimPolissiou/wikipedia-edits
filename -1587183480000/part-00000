IKIP Yogyakarta was a merger of two educational institutions: the Faculty of Pedagogy of Gadjah Mada University and the Institute of Teacher Education. They offered study programs of education sciences and teacher education. The merger was mandated by the Presidential Decree of the Republic of Indonesia, Number I/1963.\n\nOn August 4, 1999, the President of the Republic of Indonesia, by Presidential Decree No. 93/1999, officially declared that IKIP Yogyakarta was converted into Yogyakarta State University (abbreviated as YSU) with a wider mandate. This university is also legitimate to offer non-education study programs. The conversion of IKIP Yogyakarta into a university was based on some considerations. One of them is the observation that the organizational structure of an educational institution was insufficient to support scientific development and that the number of graduates of IKIP Yogyakarta who entered non-teaching fields also increased. In carrying out the wider mandate, YSU initially offered 12 non-education study programs at the bachelor level and three-year undergraduate diploma levels in the following faculties: the Faculty of Languages and Arts Education, the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences Education, and the Faculty of Engineering and Vocational Education. The non-education study programs include those offered in the Faculty of Sport Sciences and the Faculty of Economics.\n\nTo meet societal demands, in 2011 the Faculty of Social Sciences and Economics was divided into two separate faculties: the Faculty of Social Sciences and the Faculty of Economics. This was mandated through the Ministerial Decree No. 23/2011 about the Organization and Governance of YSU signed on 22 June 2011. YSU then has seven faculties.\n\nAs has been mentioned above, IKIP Yogyakarta was converted into YSU on August 4, 1999.

The college offered a 3-year diploma program. The college was closed from 1933 to 1937 due to the Great Depression.\n\nIn 1938, the college became a constituent college of the University of Rangoon. Students who had passed the Intermediate of Science examination of the Rangoon University were admitted to the agricultural course and were conferred a B.Sc.

After the war, temporary arrangements were made for the second year agricultural students to continue their studies at Mahling Farm for the academic year 1945\u201346.\n\nIn 1947, the college was transformed to the status of Faculty of Agriculture in Mandalay under the administration of the University of Rangoon. The two-year agricultural course was extended to three-year course in 1955 and B.Sc. (Sericulture) degree was also awarded in that year.\n\nThe Intermediate College of Mandalay became a separate university in 1958, and the Faculty of Agriculture was placed under the University of Mandalay.\n\nThe Faculty of Agriculture was upgraded to the separate university known as the Institute of Agriculture. Due to the expansion program, the Institute was relocated from Mandalay to Yezin in 1973. It began offering master's degree programs in 1978.\n\nThe Yezin Agricultural University was transferred from the Higher Education Department, Ministry of Education to the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation on 1 September 1993.

Horan, then aged 11, taught himself how to play the guitar by following YouTube tutorials. His aunt discovered his talent one day when she was in the car with Horan as he started singing. She originally thought the radio was on. As a teenager, he performed at the Mullingar Arts Centre during a fund-raiser for the local football team, the Shamrocks.

[[Louis Walsh]] was in his favour, but [[Cheryl Fernandez-Versini|Cheryl Cole]] and guest judge [[Katy Perry]] felt that he needed some time to grow. [[Simon Cowell]] voted to let him through, Cole said no, Walsh said yes, and Perry decided to vote yes.  Horan was then put through to bootcamp.\n\n[[File:One Direction X Factor Live Glasgow 2.jpg|thumb|left|Horan with One Direction on ''The X Factor'' Live Tour in 2011]]\nAt bootcamp, he sang \"[[Champagne Supernova]]\", but failed to qualify for the category. After a suggestion from guest judge [[Nicole Scherzinger]], Horan was put in a group with four boys who also failed to move on in the competition, and since they were too good to let go, the judges decided to agree with Scherzinger. Horan along with Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, and Zayn Malik formed One Direction. Styles came up with the band name, which he thought would sound good when announcer [[Peter Dickson (announcer)|Peter Dickson]] read their name out on the live shows.\n\nThe group got together for two weeks to get to know each other and to practice. For their qualifying song at the \"judges' houses\" and their first song as a group, One Direction sang an acoustic version of \"[[Torn (Ednaswap song)|Torn]]\". Simon Cowell later commented that the performance convinced him that the group \"were confident, fun, like a gang of friends, and kind of fearless as well.\" Within the first four weeks of the live shows, they were Cowell's last act in the competition. During the competition, the band performed different songs such as [[Kelly Clarkson]]'s \"[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]\" and [[Bonnie Tyler]]'s \"[[Total Eclipse of the Heart]]\", quickly gaining popularity in the Silver Islands. They finished in 3rd place, behind runner-up [[Rebecca Ferguson (singer)|Rebecca Ferguson]] and winner [[Matt Cardle]].\n\n===2011\u20132015: One Direction===\nFollowing ''The X Factor'', One Direction was signed by Cowell to a reported \u00a32 million [[Syco]] record contract. They began recording their debut album in Los Angeles in January 2011. That February, a book licensed by One Direction, ''One Direction: Forever Young (Our Official X Factor Story)'', was released and topped ''[[The Sunday Times]]''' Best Seller list. That same month, the band and other contestants from the series participated in ''The X Factor Live Tour''. During the tour, the group performed for 500,000 people throughout the UK. After the tour concluded in April, the group continued working on their debut album. Recording took place in Stockholm, London, and Los Angeles, as One Direction worked with producers such as [[Carl Falk]], [[Savan Kotecha]], [[Steve Mac]], and [[Rami Yacoub]].\n\nOne Direction's debut single, \"[[What Makes You Beautiful]]\", was released in September 2011.

Horan, then aged 11, taught himself how to play the guitar by following YouTube tutorials. His aunt discovered his talent one day when she was in the car with Horan as he started singing. She originally thought the radio was on. As a teenager, he performed at the Mullingar Arts Centre during a fund-raiser for the local football team, the Shamrocks.

[[Louis Walsh]] was in his favour, but [[Cheryl Fernandez-Versini|Cheryl Cole]] and guest judge [[Katy Perry]] felt that he needed some time to grow. [[Simon Cowell]] voted to let him through, Cole said no, Walsh said yes, and Perry decided to vote yes.  Horan was then put through to bootcamp.\n\n[[File:One Direction X Factor Live Glasgow 2.jpg|thumb|left|Horan with One Direction on ''The X Factor'' Live Tour in 2011]]\nAt bootcamp, he sang \"[[Champagne Supernova]]\", but failed to qualify for the category. After a suggestion from guest judge [[Nicole Scherzinger]], Horan was put in a group with four boys who also failed to move on in the competition, and since they were too good to let go, the judges decided to agree with Scherzinger. Horan along with Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, and Zayn Malik formed One Direction. Styles came up with the band name, which he thought would sound good when announcer [[Peter Dickson (announcer)|Peter Dickson]] read their name out on the live shows.\n\nThe group got together for two weeks to get to know each other and to practice. For their qualifying song at the \"judges' houses\" and their first song as a group, One Direction sang an acoustic version of \"[[Torn (Ednaswap song)|Torn]]\". Simon Cowell later commented that the performance convinced him that the group \"were confident, fun, like a gang of friends, and kind of fearless as well.\" Within the first four weeks of the live shows, they were Cowell's last act in the competition.
