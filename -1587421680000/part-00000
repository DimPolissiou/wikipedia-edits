In 1609, he landed in North America and explored the region around the modern [[New York metropolitan area]], looking for a [[Northwest Passage]] to Asia on behalf of the [[Dutch East India Company]].<ref>{{cite book|last = De Laet|first = J.|date = 1625|title = Nieuvve wereldt, ofte, Beschrijvinghe van West-Indien|url = https://archive.org/details/nieuvvewereldtof00laetrich|language = nl|location = Leyden|publisher = Elzevier|page = [https://archive.org/details/nieuvvewereldtof00laetrich/page/83 83]|oclc = 65327738}}</ref> On his ship the ''Half Moon'' he sailed up the [[Hudson River]], which was later named after him, and thereby laid the foundation for [[New Netherland|Dutch colonization of the region]].\n\nHudson discovered the [[Hudson Strait]] and the immense [[Hudson Bay]] on his final expedition, while still searching for the Northwest Passage.<ref>{{cite book|last = Rink|first = O.

At the time, the English were engaged in an economic battle with the Dutch for control of northwest routes. It was thought that, because the sun shone for three months in the northern latitudes in the summer, the ice would melt and a ship could make it across the \"top of the world\".{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nOn 1 May 1607, Hudson sailed with a crew of ten men and a boy on the 80-ton ''Hopewell''.{{sfn|Asher|1860|pp=1\u201322}}{{sfn|Conway|1906|pp=23\u201330}} They reached the east coast of [[Greenland]] on 14&nbsp;June, coasting it northward until the 22nd. Here the party named a headland \"Young's Cape\", a \"very high mount, like a round castle\" near it \"Mount of God's Mercy\" and land at 73\u00b0&nbsp;north latitude \"[[Hold-with-Hope]]\". After turning east, they sighted \"Newland\"\u2014i.e [[Spitsbergen]]\u2014on the 27th, near the mouth of the great bay Hudson later simply named the \"Great Indraught\" ([[Isfjord (Svalbard)|Isfjorden]]).\n\nOn 13 July, Hudson and his crew estimated that they had sailed as far north as 80\u00b0&nbsp;23'&nbsp;N,{{efn|Observations made during this voyage were often wrong, sometimes greatly so. See Conway 1906.}} but more likely only reached 79\u00b0&nbsp;23'&nbsp;N. The following day they entered what Hudson later in the voyage named \"Whales Bay\" ([[Krossfjorden]] and [[Kongsfjorden]]), naming its northwestern point \"Collins Cape\" (Kapp Mitra) after his [[boatswain]], William Collins. They sailed north the following two days. On the 16th, they reached as far north as Hakluyt's Headland (which [[Thomas Edge]] claims Hudson named on this voyage) at 79\u00b0&nbsp;49'&nbsp;N, thinking they saw the land continue to 82\u00b0&nbsp;N ([[Svalbard]]'s northernmost point is 80\u00b0&nbsp;49'&nbsp;N) when really it trended to the east. Encountering ice packed along the north coast, they were forced to turn back south. Hudson wanted to make his return \"by the north of Greenland to Davis his Streights ([[Davis Strait]]), and so for Kingdom of England,\" but ice conditions would have made this impossible. The expedition returned to [[Tilbury Hope]] on the [[Thames]] on 15&nbsp;September.\n\nHudson reported large numbers of whales in Spitsbergen waters during this voyage.

This claim is contentious- others have pointed to strong evidence that it was [[Jonas Poole]]'s reports in 1610, that led to the establishment of English whaling, and voyages of [[Nicholas Woodcock]] and [[Willem Cornelisz. van Muyden]] in 1612, which led to the establishment of Dutch, French and Spanish whaling.<ref>Purchas 1625, p.&nbsp;24.; Conway 1906, p.&nbsp;53.</ref> The industry itself was built by neither Hudson nor Poole&nbsp;\u2013 both were dead by 1612.\n\nIn 1608, English merchants of the [[East India Company|East India]] and Muscovy Companies again sent Hudson in the ''Hopewell'' to attempt to locate a passage to the Indies, this time to the east around northern Russia. Leaving London on 22&nbsp;April, the ship traveled almost {{convert|2500|mi}}, making it to [[Novaya Zemlya]] well above the [[Arctic Circle]] in July, but even in the summer they found the ice impenetrable and turned back, arriving at [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] on 26&nbsp;August.{{sfn|Hunter|2009|pp=19\u201320}}\n\n==== Alleged discovery of Jan Mayen ====\nAccording to Thomas Edge, \"William {{sic}} Hudson\" in 1608 discovered an island he named \"Hudson's Tutches\" (Touches) at 71\u00b0&nbsp;N,<ref>Purchas 1625, p.&nbsp;11.</ref> the latitude of [[Jan Mayen]]. However, records of Hudson's voyages suggest that he could only have come across Jan Mayen in 1607 by making an illogical detour, and historians have pointed out that Hudson himself made no mention of it in his journal.{{efn|\"The above relation by Thomas Edge is obviously incorrect. Hudson's Christian name is wrongly given, and the year in which he visited the north coast of Spitsbergen was 1607, not 1608. Moreover, Hudson himself has given an account of the voyage and makes absolutely no mention of Hudson's Tutches. It would have been hardly possible indeed for him to visit Jan Mayen on his way home from Bear Island to the Thames.\" Wordie 1922, p.&nbsp;182.}} There is also no cartographical proof of this supposed discovery.{{sfn|Hacquebord|2004|p=229}}\n\n[[Jonas Poole]] in 1611 and [[Robert Fotherby]] in 1615 both had possession of Hudson's journal while searching for his elusive Hold-with-Hope\u2014which is now believed to have been on the east coast of Greenland\u2014but neither had any knowledge of any discovery of Jan Mayen, an achievement which was only later attributed to Hudson. Fotherby eventually stumbled across Jan Mayen, thinking it a new discovery and naming it \"Sir Thomas Smith's Island\",<ref>Purchas 1625, pp.&nbsp;82\u201389.</ref>{{sfn|Hacquebord|2004|pp=230\u2013231}} though the first verifiable records of the discovery of the island had been made a year earlier, in 1614.\n\n=== Expedition of 1609 ===\n[[File:Henry Hudson Map 26.png|thumb|Hudson's voyages to North America]]\nIn 1609, Hudson was chosen by merchants of the [[Dutch East India Company]] in the Netherlands to find an easterly passage to Asia.

At that point, acting outside his instructions, Hudson pointed the ship west and decided to try to seek a westerly passage through North America.{{sfn|Hunter|2009|pp=56\u201357}}\n\nThey reached the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]] on 2&nbsp;July, and in mid-July made landfall near the [[LaHave, Nova Scotia|LaHave area]] of [[Nova Scotia]].{{sfn|Hunter|2000|pp=92\u201394}} Here they encountered Native Americans who were accustomed to trading with the French; they were willing to trade beaver pelts, but apparently no trades occurred.{{sfn|Hunter|2009|p=98}}<ref>Juet 1609, entry of 19&nbsp;July.</ref> The ship stayed in the area about ten days, the crew replacing a broken mast and fishing for food.

Rather than entering the Chesapeake he explored the coast to the north, finding [[Delaware Bay]] but continuing on north. On 3 September he reached the estuary of the river that initially was called the \"North River\" or \"Mauritius\" and now carries his name. He was not the first European to discover the estuary, though, as it had been known since the voyage of [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in 1524.\n\nOn 6 September 1609, [[John Colman]] of his crew was killed by [[Native Americans in the United States|natives]] with an arrow to his neck.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Roberts |title=New York's Coldest Case: A Murder 400 Years Old |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=4 September 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/05/nyregion/05murder.html}}</ref> Hudson sailed into the [[Upper New York Bay]] on 11 September,<ref>[http://blog.insidetheapple.net/2008/09/new-yorks-many-911-anniversaries-staten.html Nevius, Michelle and James, \"New York's many 9/11 anniversaries: the Staten Island Peace Conference\"], ''Inside the Apple: A Streetwise History of New York City'', 8 September 2008.

He managed to pass the log to the Dutch ambassador to England, who sent it, along with his report, to Amsterdam.{{sfn|Shorto|2004|p=31}}\n\nWhile exploring the river, Hudson had traded with several native groups, mainly obtaining furs. His voyage was used to establish Dutch claims to the region and to the [[fur trade]] that prospered there when a trading post was established at Albany in 1614. [[New Amsterdam]] on [[Manhattan]] Island became the capital of [[New Netherland]] in 1625.\n\n=== Expedition of 1610\u20131611 ===\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}\nIn 1610, Hudson obtained backing for another voyage, this time under the English flag. The funding came from the [[Virginia Company]] and the [[British East India Company]]. At the helm of his new ship, the {{ship||Discovery|1602 ship|2}}, he stayed to the north&nbsp;\u2014 some claim he deliberately stayed too far south on his Dutch-funded voyage&nbsp;\u2014 reached [[Iceland]] on 11&nbsp;May, the south of Greenland on 4&nbsp;June, and rounded the southern tip of Greenland.\n\nOn 25 June, the explorers reached what is now the [[Hudson Strait]] at the northern tip of [[Labrador]]. Following the southern coast of the strait on 2&nbsp;August, the ship entered [[Hudson Bay]]. Excitement was very high due to the expectation that the ship had finally found the [[Northwest Passage]] through the continent. Hudson spent the following months mapping and exploring its eastern shores, but he and his crew did not find a passage to Asia. In November, however, the ship became trapped in the ice in the [[James Bay]], and the crew moved ashore for the winter.\n\n==== Mutiny ====\nWhen the ice cleared in the spring of 1611, Hudson planned to use his ''Discovery'' to further explore Hudson Bay with the continuing goal of discovering the Passage; however, most of the members of his crew ardently desired to return home. Matters came to a head and much of the crew mutinied in June. Descriptions of the successful mutiny are one-sided, because the only survivors who could tell their story were the mutineers and those who went along with the mutiny.\n\nIn the latter class was ship's navigator, [[Abacuk Pricket]], a survivor who kept a journal that was to become a key source for the narrative of the mutiny. According to Pricket, the leaders of the mutiny were Henry Greene and Robert Juet. Pricket's narrative tells how the mutineers set Hudson, his teenage son John, and seven crewmen\u2014men who were either sick and infirm or loyal to Hudson\u2014adrift from the ''Discovery'' in a small [[shallop]], an open boat, effectively marooning them in Hudson Bay. The Pricket journal reports that the mutineers provided the castaways with clothing, powder and shot, some pikes, an iron pot, some food, and other miscellaneous items.\n\n==== Set adrift ====\n[[File:Last Voyage Of Henry Hudson.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|[[John Collier (painter)|John Collier]]'s painting of Hudson, his son, and loyal crew set adrift]]\nAfter the mutiny, Hudson's shallop broke out oars and tried to keep pace with the ''Discovery'' for some time. Pricket recalled that the mutineers finally tired of the David\u2013Goliath pursuit and unfurled additional sails aboard the ''Discovery'', enabling the larger vessel to leave the tiny open boat behind. Hudson and the other seven aboard the shallop were never seen again. Despite subsequent searches, including those conducted by [[Thomas Button]] in 1612, and by [[Zachariah Gillam]] in 1668\u20131670, their fate is unknown.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thomas Button Searches for Remains of Henry Hudson|url=http://canadiancoinnews.com/thomas-button-searches-for-remains-of-henry-hudson/|publisher=Trajan Publishing Corporation|date=14 April 2015|accessdate=28 March 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329051646/http://canadiancoinnews.com/thomas-button-searches-for-remains-of-henry-hudson/|archivedate=29 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Aftermath of Hudson's Voyages and Related Notes|url=http://www.ianchadwick.com/hudson/hudson_05.htm|publisher=Ian Chadwick|date=19 January 2007|accessdate=28 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nPricket's journal and testimony have been severely criticized for bias, on two grounds. Firstly, prior to the mutiny the alleged leaders of the uprising, Greene and Juet, had been friends and loyal seamen of Hudson. Secondly, Greene and Juet did not survive the return voyage to England. Pricket knew he and the other survivors of the mutiny would be tried in England for [[piracy]], and it would have been in his interest, and the interest of the other survivors, to put together a narrative that would place the blame for the mutiny upon men who were no longer alive to defend themselves.\n\nThe Pricket narrative became the controlling story of the expedition's disastrous end. Only eight of the thirteen mutinous crewmen survived the return voyage to Europe. They were arrested in England, and some were put on trial, but no punishment was imposed for the mutiny. One theory holds that the survivors were considered too valuable as sources of information to execute, as they had traveled to the New World and could describe sailing routes and conditions.<ref>{{cite DCB|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/hudson_henry_1E.html |title=Hudson, Henry |volume=1 |first=L. H. |last=Neatby}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe gulf or bay discovered by Hudson is twice the size of the [[Baltic Sea]], and its [[List of Hudson Bay rivers|many large estuaries]] afford access to otherwise landlocked parts of Western Canada and the Arctic. This allowed the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] to exploit a lucrative fur trade along its shores for more than two centuries, growing powerful enough to influence the history and present international boundaries of western North America. [[Hudson Strait]] became the entrance to the Arctic for all ships engaged in the historic search for the [[Northwest Passage]] from the Atlantic side&nbsp;\u2013 though modern voyages take more northerly routes.\n\nAlong with Hudson Bay, many other topographical features and landmarks are named for Hudson. The [[Hudson River]] in New York and New Jersey is named after him, as are [[Hudson County, New Jersey]], the [[Henry Hudson Bridge]], the [[Henry Hudson Parkway]], and the town of [[Hudson, New York]]. The unbuilt [[Hendrik Hudson Hotel]] in New York was also to have been named after him. \n\nHudson and his marooned crewmates appear as mythic characters in the famous story \"[[Rip Van Winkle]]\" by [[Washington Irving]]. He also appears in the time-travel novel ''[[Torn (Haddix novel)|Torn]]'' by [[Margaret Peterson Haddix]].\n\nA orange bloomed ''[[Tulip vvedenskyi]]'' cultivar is named 'Henry Hudson'.<ref>{{cite web |title=Top Tulips that Come Back Every Year |url=https://www.bhg.com/gardening/flowers/bulbs/top-perennial-tulips/ |website=Better Homes & Gardens |accessdate=20 April 2020 |language=EN}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Age of Discovery]]\n* [[List of people who disappeared mysteriously: pre-1970|List of people who disappeared before 1970]]\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{notelist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last = Asher|first = G.

At the time, the English were engaged in an economic battle with the Dutch for control of northwest routes. It was thought that, because the sun shone for three months in the northern latitudes in the summer, the ice would melt and a ship could make it across the \"top of the world\".{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nOn 1 May 1607, Hudson sailed with a crew of ten men and a boy on the 80-ton ''Hopewell''.{{sfn|Asher|1860|pp=1\u201322}}{{sfn|Conway|1906|pp=23\u201330}} They reached the east coast of [[Greenland]] on 14&nbsp;June, coasting it northward until the 22nd. Here the party named a headland \"Young's Cape\", a \"very high mount, like a round castle\" near it \"Mount of God's Mercy\" and land at 73\u00b0&nbsp;north latitude \"[[Hold-with-Hope]]\". After turning east, they sighted \"Newland\"\u2014i.e [[Spitsbergen]]\u2014on the 27th, near the mouth of the great bay Hudson later simply named the \"Great Indraught\" ([[Isfjord (Svalbard)|Isfjorden]]).\n\nOn 13 July, Hudson and his crew estimated that they had sailed as far north as 80\u00b0&nbsp;23'&nbsp;N,{{efn|Observations made during this voyage were often wrong, sometimes greatly so. See Conway 1906.}} but more likely only reached 79\u00b0&nbsp;23'&nbsp;N. The following day they entered what Hudson later in the voyage named \"Whales Bay\" ([[Krossfjorden]] and [[Kongsfjorden]]), naming its northwestern point \"Collins Cape\" (Kapp Mitra) after his [[boatswain]], William Collins. They sailed north the following two days. On the 16th, they reached as far north as Hakluyt's Headland (which [[Thomas Edge]] claims Hudson named on this voyage) at 79\u00b0&nbsp;49'&nbsp;N, thinking they saw the land continue to 82\u00b0&nbsp;N ([[Svalbard]]'s northernmost point is 80\u00b0&nbsp;49'&nbsp;N) when really it trended to the east. Encountering ice packed along the north coast, they were forced to turn back south. Hudson wanted to make his return \"by the north of Greenland to Davis his Streights ([[Davis Strait]]), and so for Kingdom of England,\" but ice conditions would have made this impossible. The expedition returned to [[Tilbury Hope]] on the [[Thames]] on 15&nbsp;September.\n\nHudson reported large numbers of whales in Spitsbergen waters during this voyage.

This claim is contentious- others have pointed to strong evidence that it was [[Jonas Poole]]'s reports in 1610, that led to the establishment of English whaling, and voyages of [[Nicholas Woodcock]] and [[Willem Cornelisz. van Muyden]] in 1612, which led to the establishment of Dutch, French and Spanish whaling.<ref>Purchas 1625, p.&nbsp;24.; Conway 1906, p.&nbsp;53.</ref> The industry itself was built by neither Hudson nor Poole&nbsp;\u2013 both were dead by 1612.\n\nIn 1608, English merchants of the [[East India Company|East India]] and Muscovy Companies again sent Hudson in the ''Hopewell'' to attempt to locate a passage to the Indies, this time to the east around northern Russia. Leaving London on 22&nbsp;April, the ship traveled almost {{convert|2500|mi}}, making it to [[Novaya Zemlya]] well above the [[Arctic Circle]] in July, but even in the summer they found the ice impenetrable and turned back, arriving at [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] on 26&nbsp;August.{{sfn|Hunter|2009|pp=19\u201320}}\n\n==== Alleged discovery of Jan Mayen ====\nAccording to Thomas Edge, \"William {{sic}} Hudson\" in 1608 discovered an island he named \"Hudson's Tutches\" (Touches) at 71\u00b0&nbsp;N,<ref>Purchas 1625, p.&nbsp;11.</ref> the latitude of [[Jan Mayen]]. However, records of Hudson's voyages suggest that he could only have come across Jan Mayen in 1607 by making an illogical detour, and historians have pointed out that Hudson himself made no mention of it in his journal.{{efn|\"The above relation by Thomas Edge is obviously incorrect. Hudson's Christian name is wrongly given, and the year in which he visited the north coast of Spitsbergen was 1607, not 1608. Moreover, Hudson himself has given an account of the voyage and makes absolutely no mention of Hudson's Tutches. It would have been hardly possible indeed for him to visit Jan Mayen on his way home from Bear Island to the Thames.\" Wordie 1922, p.&nbsp;182.}} There is also no cartographical proof of this supposed discovery.{{sfn|Hacquebord|2004|p=229}}\n\n[[Jonas Poole]] in 1611 and [[Robert Fotherby]] in 1615 both had possession of Hudson's journal while searching for his elusive Hold-with-Hope\u2014which is now believed to have been on the east coast of Greenland\u2014but neither had any knowledge of any discovery of Jan Mayen, an achievement which was only later attributed to Hudson.

At that point, acting outside his instructions, Hudson pointed the ship west and decided to try to seek a westerly passage through North America.{{sfn|Hunter|2009|pp=56\u201357}}\n\nThey reached the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]] on 2&nbsp;July, and in mid-July made landfall near the [[LaHave, Nova Scotia|LaHave area]] of [[Nova Scotia]].{{sfn|Hunter|2000|pp=92\u201394}} Here they encountered Native Americans who were accustomed to trading with the French; they were willing to trade beaver pelts, but apparently no trades occurred.{{sfn|Hunter|2009|p=98}}<ref>Juet 1609, entry of 19&nbsp;July.</ref> The ship stayed in the area about ten days, the crew replacing a broken mast and fishing for food.

Rather than entering the Chesapeake he explored the coast to the north, finding [[Delaware Bay]] but continuing on north. On 3 September he reached the estuary of the river that initially was called the \"North River\" or \"Mauritius\" and now carries his name. He was not the first European to discover the estuary, though, as it had been known since the voyage of [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in 1524.\n\nOn 6 September 1609, [[John Colman]] of his crew was killed by [[Native Americans in the United States|natives]] with an arrow to his neck.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Roberts |title=New York's Coldest Case: A Murder 400 Years Old |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=4 September 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/05/nyregion/05murder.html}}</ref> Hudson sailed into the [[Upper New York Bay]] on 11 September,<ref>[http://blog.insidetheapple.net/2008/09/new-yorks-many-911-anniversaries-staten.html Nevius, Michelle and James, \"New York's many 9/11 anniversaries: the Staten Island Peace Conference\"], ''Inside the Apple: A Streetwise History of New York City'', 8 September 2008.

He managed to pass the log to the Dutch ambassador to England, who sent it, along with his report, to Amsterdam.{{sfn|Shorto|2004|p=31}}\n\nWhile exploring the river, Hudson had traded with several native groups, mainly obtaining furs. His voyage was used to establish Dutch claims to the region and to the [[fur trade]] that prospered there when a trading post was established at Albany in 1614. [[New Amsterdam]] on [[Manhattan]] Island became the capital of [[New Netherland]] in 1625.\n\n=== Expedition of 1610\u20131611 ===\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}\nIn 1610, Hudson obtained backing for another voyage, this time under the English flag. The funding came from the [[Virginia Company]] and the [[British East India Company]]. At the helm of his new ship, the {{ship||Discovery|1602 ship|2}}, he stayed to the north&nbsp;\u2014 some claim he deliberately stayed too far south on his Dutch-funded voyage&nbsp;\u2014 reached [[Iceland]] on 11&nbsp;May, the south of Greenland on 4&nbsp;June, and rounded the southern tip of Greenland.\n\nOn 25 June, the explorers reached what is now the [[Hudson Strait]] at the northern tip of [[Labrador]]. Following the southern coast of the strait on 2&nbsp;August, the ship entered [[Hudson Bay]]. Excitement was very high due to the expectation that the ship had finally found the [[Northwest Passage]] through the continent. Hudson spent the following months mapping and exploring its eastern shores, but he and his crew did not find a passage to Asia. In November, however, the ship became trapped in the ice in the [[James Bay]], and the crew moved ashore for the winter.\n\n==== Mutiny ====\nWhen the ice cleared in the spring of 1611, Hudson planned to use his ''Discovery'' to further explore Hudson Bay with the continuing goal of discovering the Passage; however, most of the members of his crew ardently desired to return home. Matters came to a head and much of the crew mutinied in June. Descriptions of the successful mutiny are one-sided, because the only survivors who could tell their story were the mutineers and those who went along with the mutiny.\n\nIn the latter class was ship's navigator, [[Abacuk Pricket]], a survivor who kept a journal that was to become a key source for the narrative of the mutiny. According to Pricket, the leaders of the mutiny were Henry Greene and Robert Juet. Pricket's narrative tells how the mutineers set Hudson, his teenage son John, and seven crewmen\u2014men who were either sick and infirm or loyal to Hudson\u2014adrift from the ''Discovery'' in a small [[shallop]], an open boat, effectively marooning them in Hudson Bay. The Pricket journal reports that the mutineers provided the castaways with clothing, powder and shot, some pikes, an iron pot, some food, and other miscellaneous items.\n\n==== Set adrift ====\n[[File:Last Voyage Of Henry Hudson.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|[[John Collier (painter)|John Collier]]'s painting of Hudson, his son, and loyal crew set adrift]]\nAfter the mutiny, Hudson's shallop broke out oars and tried to keep pace with the ''Discovery'' for some time. Pricket recalled that the mutineers finally tired of the David\u2013Goliath pursuit and unfurled additional sails aboard the ''Discovery'', enabling the larger vessel to leave the tiny open boat behind. Hudson and the other seven aboard the shallop were never seen again. Despite subsequent searches, including those conducted by [[Thomas Button]] in 1612, and by [[Zachariah Gillam]] in 1668\u20131670, their fate is unknown.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thomas Button Searches for Remains of Henry Hudson|url=http://canadiancoinnews.com/thomas-button-searches-for-remains-of-henry-hudson/|publisher=Trajan Publishing Corporation|date=14 April 2015|accessdate=28 March 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329051646/http://canadiancoinnews.com/thomas-button-searches-for-remains-of-henry-hudson/|archivedate=29 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Aftermath of Hudson's Voyages and Related Notes|url=http://www.ianchadwick.com/hudson/hudson_05.htm|publisher=Ian Chadwick|date=19 January 2007|accessdate=28 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nPricket's journal and testimony have been severely criticized for bias, on two grounds. Firstly, prior to the mutiny the alleged leaders of the uprising, Greene and Juet, had been friends and loyal seamen of Hudson. Secondly, Greene and Juet did not survive the return voyage to England. Pricket knew he and the other survivors of the mutiny would be tried in England for [[piracy]], and it would have been in his interest, and the interest of the other survivors, to put together a narrative that would place the blame for the mutiny upon men who were no longer alive to defend themselves.\n\nThe Pricket narrative became the controlling story of the expedition's disastrous end. Only eight of the thirteen mutinous crewmen survived the return voyage to Europe. They were arrested in England, and some were put on trial, but no punishment was imposed for the mutiny. One theory holds that the survivors were considered too valuable as sources of information to execute, as they had traveled to the New World and could describe sailing routes and conditions.<ref>{{cite DCB|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/hudson_henry_1E.html |title=Hudson, Henry |volume=1 |first=L. H. |last=Neatby}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe gulf or bay discovered by Hudson is twice the size of the [[Baltic Sea]], and its [[List of Hudson Bay rivers|many large estuaries]] afford access to otherwise landlocked parts of Western Canada and the Arctic. This allowed the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] to exploit a lucrative fur trade along its shores for more than two centuries, growing powerful enough to influence the history and present international boundaries of western North America. [[Hudson Strait]] became the entrance to the Arctic for all ships engaged in the historic search for the [[Northwest Passage]] from the Atlantic side&nbsp;\u2013 though modern voyages take more northerly routes.\n\nAlong with Hudson Bay, many other topographical features and landmarks are named for Hudson. The [[Hudson River]] in New York and New Jersey is named after him, as are [[Hudson County, New Jersey]], the [[Henry Hudson Bridge]], the [[Henry Hudson Parkway]], and the town of [[Hudson, New York]]. The unbuilt [[Hendrik Hudson Hotel]] in New York was also to have been named after him. \n\nHudson and his marooned crewmates appear as mythic characters in the famous story \"[[Rip Van Winkle]]\" by [[Washington Irving]].

In his childhood he was a [[Boy Scout]]. At 16 years of age he was apprenticed as an engineer at the Parnall Aircraft Factory works in [[Tolworth]], and was a part-time student of engineering at [[Kingston College (England)|Kingston Technical College]], in [[Kingston-upon-Thames]], Surrey.<ref>'Essential Surrey and S.W. London' online magazine, 'Bomber Command Hero, Cyril Barton, V.C.', 24 June 2014. http://www.essentialsurrey.co.uk/culture/bomber-command-hero%3A-cyril-barton-vc/</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\nBarton left his [[reserved occupation]] apprenticeship at the Parnall Aircraft Factory and volunteered for the [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]] on 16 April 1941, when he was 19 years of age.\n\nAfter pilot training via the [[Arnold Scheme]] at Maxwell Field, [[Montgomery, Alabama]], and 'Darr Aero Tech' at [[Albany, Georgia]] in the United States,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Victoria Cross citation, London Gazette, 27 June 1944</ref> he qualified as a sergeant pilot on 10 November 1942. He then returned to England and completed his training with No. 1663 Heavy Conversion Unit at [[Rufforth]], Yorkshire.\n\nOn 5 September 1943, he joined an aircrew assigned to [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]]'s [[No. 78 Squadron RAF|No. 78 Squadron]], with Barton receiving a commission as a [[pilot officer]] three weeks later. Their first operational mission was against a target at [[Montlucon]] in occupied France. Barton completed nine sorties with No. 78 Squadron until 15 January 1944, when he was posted to [[No. 578 Squadron RAF|No. 578 Squadron]], based at [[RAF Burn]] in [[North Yorkshire]]. His second sortie with the new squadron was an attack upon the city of [[Stuttgart]] in Germany, flying in Halifax LK797 (codename LK-E). By 30 March 1944, he had completed six sorties in LK797, which the crew had named ''[[Excalibur]]''. Prior to his final mission from RAF Burn, Barton had already taken part in four attacks upon [[Berlin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Attack on Nuremberg===\nOn the night of 30 March 1944, while flying in an attack on the city of [[Nuremberg]], in Germany, during the [[Battle of Berlin (RAF campaign)|Battle of Berlin]] air offensive, whilst {{convert|70|mi}} from the target, Pilot Officer Barton's [[Handley Page Halifax]] bomber ([[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|Serial number]]: LK797) was badly shot-up in attacks by two ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' night-fighters, a [[Junkers Ju 88]] and a [[Messerschmitt 210]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> resulting in two of its fuel tanks being punctured, both its radio and rear turret gun port being disabled, the [[starboard]] inner engine being critically damaged and the internal intercom lines being cut. In a running battle, despite the attacks being persistent and determined, Barton as captain of the aircraft succeeded by good flying in throwing off and escaping his faster and more agile assailants. However, a misunderstanding in on-board communications in the aircraft at the height of the crisis resulted in three of the 7-man crew [[parachuting|bailing out]], leaving Barton with no navigator, bombardier or wireless operator. Rather than turn back for England, he decided to press on with the mission, against the odds of further attacks in a semi-wrecked aircraft that was leaking fuel and handicapped by lack of a full crew. Arriving over the target, he released the bomb payload himself and then, as Barton turned the aircraft for home, its ailing starboard engine blew-up. Subsequently he nursed the damaged airframe over a four-and-a-half hour flight with no navigational assistance back across the hostile defences of Germany and occupied Europe, and across the [[North Sea]]. As LK797 crossed the English coast at dawn 90 miles to the north of its base its fuel ran out because of the battle damage leakage and, with only one engine still running on vapours, and at too low a height to allow a remaining crew bail-out by parachute, Barton crash-landed the bomber at the village of [[Ryhope]], steering away in the final descent from the houses and coal pit-head workings. Barton was pulled from the wrecked aircraft alive but died of injuries sustained in the landing before he reached the hospital. The three remaining on-board members of the crew survived the forced landing. One local man, a miner, also died when he was struck by a piece of the aeroplane's wreckage during the impact of the crash.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jones|1978|pp=121\u2013128.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Moyes|1976|p=357.}}</ref>\n\nAfter Barton's death his mother received a posthumous letter addressed to her from him containing the following passage: \"I hope that you will never receive this letter, but I quite expect that you will.

In ''Official Records'' it states that he was in 5th Regiment Kentucky Mounted Infantry. This enlistment is also mentioned in ''Kentucky Adjutant General's Report \u2013 Confederate Volunteers 1861\u20131865, Vol.1'' page 254 entry 80, where Kiney's enlistment is dated on November 1st 1861. Wikipedia's entry on this unit states that they were disbanded in October 1862 and the troops were given a three way choice, discharge, reenlistment or joining the Kentucky Cavalry. Kiney went with the last option as he enlisted in Company l of Diamond's 10th Kentucky Cavalry on 18th November 1863. (This extract is from the book ''The 10th Kentucky Cavalry CSA'' by John B. Wells & Jim Pritchard. See ''Roster of Diamond's 10th Kentucky Cavalry CSA'' www.potterflats.com10thKyhtml) Professor Hoare's segment on Kiney in ''The South's Last Boys in Gray'' reproduces an excerpt of Lloyd B. Walton's article \"He's a Man Even at 109\" from ''The Indianapolis Times'' September 14th 1952. Here Kiney speaks of his Civil War experience, recalling that he was in most of the war and that Shiloh was his toughest fight.

Sheets of that same company kept a diary where Thomas Riddle is mentioned on February 26th 1863.\n        Against this evidence is the fact that Lowry cautions against believing Riddle and that some of Riddle's descendants warn that due to census information, he could not have served in the Civil War.

Unlike the U.S. military archives, the Confederate records had no official archive system after the war. However, for most of the cases investigated, the ages of the claimants alone were enough to prove their claim was false. Walter Williams was generally acknowledged as the \"last Confederate veteran\" in 1950s newspapers. However, in September 1959 an expos\u00e9 by ''The New York Times'' revealed that he was in fact born in 1854 in [[Itawamba County, Mississippi]], and not 1842 as claimed. Still, since [[John B. Salling]] and all the other claimants were dead, Williams was celebrated as the last Confederate veteran after his death on 20 December 1959.<ref name=\"Associated Press\">{{cite web|author=Associated Press|work=The New York Times|date=20 December 1959|title=Reputed Last Civil War Veteran Dies in Texas After Long Illness: Walter Williams Put His Age at 117 \u2013 Tributes Note the End of an Era|accessdate=17 October 2011|url=http://alt.nntp2http.com/obituaries/2006/12/11e4275470a2d5ff1e43f077fe39bbdd.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328015838/http://alt.nntp2http.com/obituaries/2006/12/11e4275470a2d5ff1e43f077fe39bbdd.html|archive-date=28 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSalling's own status is disputed. In 1991, William Marvel examined the claims of Salling and several other \"last Civil War veterans\" for a piece in the Civil War history magazine ''Blue & Gray.'' Marvel found census data that indicated Salling was born in 1858, not 1846. Although in 1900 Salling supplied a birthdate of March 1858, he appears to have been born around 1856, still too late to have served in the Confederate Army. The 1860 census lists him as 4 years old, and the 1870 census as 14.<ref name=\"impostors\">{{cite book|title=The great imposters|first=William|last=Marvel|publisher=Blue and Gray|volume=VIII|issue=3|year=1991|pages=32\u201333|location=Columbus}}</ref> William Lundy is listed as 1 year old on the 1860 census, and from 1870 until 1930 he gave census marshals ages that reflected birthdates as early as 1853 and as late as 1860. He did not push his birthdate back to the 1840s until he applied for a Confederate pension from the state of Florida. In the same piece, Marvel confirmed Woolson's claim to be the last surviving Union veteran and asserted that Woolson was the last genuine Civil War veteran on either side. However, Marvel did not present research establishing who, among the several other Confederate claims from the 1950s, some of which appear to be genuine, was the real last Confederate veteran.\n\n=== [[French invasion of Mexico]] (1861\u201367) ===\n* Jules Pujos (1846\u20131942)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Second French Empire|French Empire]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6fMjAQAAMAAJ&dq=ancien+%22Pujos%22+%22mexique%22&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Jules+Pujos|title=l\u00e9gion d'honneur|publisher=Journal officiel de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise|date=12 January 1937|page=508|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"DDD\" />\n* Francisco Arellano Zenteno (1842\u20131935)&nbsp;\u2013 Mexico.

In ''Official Records'' it states that he was in 5th Regiment Kentucky Mounted Infantry. This enlistment is also mentioned in ''Kentucky Adjutant General's Report \u2013 Confederate Volunteers 1861\u20131865, Vol.1'' page 254 entry 80, where Kiney's enlistment is dated on November 1st 1861. Wikipedia's entry on this unit states that they were disbanded in October 1862 and the troops were given a three way choice, discharge, reenlistment or joining the Kentucky Cavalry. Kiney went with the last option as he enlisted in Company l of Diamond's 10th Kentucky Cavalry on 18th November 1863. (This extract is from the book ''The 10th Kentucky Cavalry CSA'' by John B. Wells & Jim Pritchard. See ''Roster of Diamond's 10th Kentucky Cavalry CSA'' www.potterflats.com10thKyhtml) Professor Hoare's segment on Kiney in ''The South's Last Boys in Gray'' reproduces an excerpt of Lloyd B. Walton's article \"He's a Man Even at 109\" from ''The Indianapolis Times'' September 14th 1952. Here Kiney speaks of his Civil War experience, recalling that he was in most of the war and that Shiloh was his toughest fight.

Sheets of that same company kept a diary where Thomas Riddle is mentioned on February 26th 1863.\n        Against this evidence is the fact that Lowry cautions against believing Riddle and that some of Riddle's descendants warn that due to census information, he could not have served in the Civil War.

Unlike the U.S. military archives, the Confederate records had no official archive system after the war. However, for most of the cases investigated, the ages of the claimants alone were enough to prove their claim was false. Walter Williams was generally acknowledged as the \"last Confederate veteran\" in 1950s newspapers. However, in September 1959 an expos\u00e9 by ''The New York Times'' revealed that he was in fact born in 1854 in [[Itawamba County, Mississippi]], and not 1842 as claimed. Still, since [[John B. Salling]] and all the other claimants were dead, Williams was celebrated as the last Confederate veteran after his death on 20 December 1959.<ref name=\"Associated Press\">{{cite web|author=Associated Press|work=The New York Times|date=20 December 1959|title=Reputed Last Civil War Veteran Dies in Texas After Long Illness: Walter Williams Put His Age at 117 \u2013 Tributes Note the End of an Era|accessdate=17 October 2011|url=http://alt.nntp2http.com/obituaries/2006/12/11e4275470a2d5ff1e43f077fe39bbdd.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328015838/http://alt.nntp2http.com/obituaries/2006/12/11e4275470a2d5ff1e43f077fe39bbdd.html|archive-date=28 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSalling's own status is disputed. In 1991, William Marvel examined the claims of Salling and several other \"last Civil War veterans\" for a piece in the Civil War history magazine ''Blue & Gray.'' Marvel found census data that indicated Salling was born in 1858, not 1846. Although in 1900 Salling supplied a birthdate of March 1858, he appears to have been born around 1856, still too late to have served in the Confederate Army. The 1860 census lists him as 4 years old, and the 1870 census as 14.<ref name=\"impostors\">{{cite book|title=The great imposters|first=William|last=Marvel|publisher=Blue and Gray|volume=VIII|issue=3|year=1991|pages=32\u201333|location=Columbus}}</ref> William Lundy is listed as 1 year old on the 1860 census, and from 1870 until 1930 he gave census marshals ages that reflected birthdates as early as 1853 and as late as 1860. He did not push his birthdate back to the 1840s until he applied for a Confederate pension from the state of Florida. In the same piece, Marvel confirmed Woolson's claim to be the last surviving Union veteran and asserted that Woolson was the last genuine Civil War veteran on either side. However, Marvel did not present research establishing who, among the several other Confederate claims from the 1950s, some of which appear to be genuine, was the real last Confederate veteran.\n\n=== [[French invasion of Mexico]] (1861\u201367) ===\n* Jules Pujos (1846\u20131942)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Second French Empire|French Empire]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6fMjAQAAMAAJ&dq=ancien+%22Pujos%22+%22mexique%22&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Jules+Pujos|title=l\u00e9gion d'honneur|publisher=Journal officiel de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise|date=12 January 1937|page=508|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"DDD\" />\n* Francisco Arellano Zenteno (1842\u20131935)&nbsp;\u2013 Mexico.
