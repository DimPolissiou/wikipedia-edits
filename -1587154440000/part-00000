Major was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher Government]] from 1989 to 1990, and was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] from 1979 until his retirement in 2001. Since the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 2013, he has been both the oldest and earliest-serving of all [[Living prime ministers of the United Kingdom|living former prime ministers]].\n\nBorn in [[St Helier, London|St Helier, Surrey]], Major grew up in [[Brixton]]. He initially worked as an insurance clerk, and then at the [[London Electricity Board]], before becoming an executive at [[Standard Chartered]]. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, Assistant Whip and as a Minister for Social Security. In 1987, he joined the Cabinet as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], and was promoted to foreign secretary two years later. Just three months later in October 1989, he was appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, where he presented the 1990 budget. Major became prime minister after Thatcher resigned in November 1990. He presided over British participation in the [[Gulf War]] in March 1991, and negotiated the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/dec/11/european-council-maastricht |title=European Council (Maastricht) |website=Hansard |date=11 December 1991 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> He went on to lead the Conservatives to a record fourth consecutive electoral victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history with over 14&nbsp;million votes at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], albeit with a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, in what came to be known as [[Black Wednesday]] (September 1992), his government was forced to withdraw the [[pound sterling]] from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. This event led to a loss of confidence in Conservative economic policies and Major was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again.\n\nDespite the eventual revival of economic growth amongst other successes such as the beginnings of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], by the mid-1990s, the Conservative Party was embroiled in scandals involving various MPs (including cabinet ministers). Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as party leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by [[John Redwood]] but was easily re-elected. By this time, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had moved toward the [[Centrism|centre]] under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and won many by-elections, eventually depriving Major's government of a parliamentary majority in December 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Major minority|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-major-minority-1314246.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=13 December 1996}}</ref> Major went on to lose the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] five months later, in one of the largest electoral defeats since the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832.\n\nMajor was succeeded by [[William Hague]] as Leader of the Conservative Party in June 1997. He went on to retire from active politics, leaving the House of Commons at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]].

He later decided to undertake a correspondence course in banking. Major took up a post as an executive at the [[Standard Chartered |Standard Chartered Bank]] in May 1965 and he rose quickly through the ranks.

He won the seat in the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]].<ref name=\"johnmajor8\"/> Following boundary changes, Major became the MP for the newly formed seat of [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] in [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] (retaining the seat in [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]] and [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]] before retiring from Parliament in [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]]).\n\nHe was appointed as a [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] in January 1981, becoming an [[whip (politics)|assistant whip]] in 1983. He was later made [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State|Under-Secretary of State]] for [[Department for Work and Pensions|Social Security]] in 1985, before being promoted to become [[Minister of State]] in the same department in September 1986, first attracting national media attention over [[cold weather payment]]s to the elderly in January 1987, when Britain was in the depths of a severe winter.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deer|first=Brian|title=MINISTERS RIG 'COLD' CASH FOR OLD|url=http://briandeer.com/social/john-major.htm|website=The Sunday Times (London) |date=11 January 1987|publisher=The Sunday Times (London)|accessdate=3 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite Hansard | house=House of Commons | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1987/jan/20/severe-weather-payments|title=Severe Weather Payments | date = 20 January 1987 | column_start = 747 | column_end = 754 }}</ref>\n\n==In Cabinet==\n{{blp sources|section|date=November 2019}}\nFollowing the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 election]], Major was promoted to the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]]. Two years later, in a surprise July 1989 reshuffle, Major succeeded [[Geoffrey Howe]] as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. The rapid promotion surprised many, due to Major's relative lack of experience in the Cabinet. Just three months later, in October 1989, Major was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the sudden resignation of [[Nigel Lawson]]. This meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the [[Great Offices of State]].\n\nAs Chancellor, Major presented only one Budget, the first to be televised live, in early 1990. He publicised it as ''a budget for savings'' and announced the [[Tax-exempt special savings account|Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account]] (TESSA), arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household [[Average propensity to save|savings ratio]] that had been apparent during the previous [[Fiscal year|financial year]]. In June 1990, Major suggested that the proposed Single European Currency should be a \"hard [[wikt:ecu|ecu]]\", competing against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and [[Douglas Hurd]], Major's successor as Foreign Secretary, persuaded Thatcher to support British entry to the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a move which she had resisted for many years, and which had played a part in the resignation of Nigel Lawson.<ref>Edmund Dell, ''The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945\u201390'' (HarperCollins, 1997), pp. 541\u201350.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Michael Heseltine]] challenged Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|in November 1990]], Major and Douglas Hurd were the proposer and seconder on her nomination papers for the leadership ballot. After Thatcher was unable to win enough support to prevent a second ballot, she announced her resignation as Prime Minister and Conservative Leader. Major subsequently announced on 22 November that he would stand in the second ballot. A close ally of Thatcher, Major was supported by her during the remainder of the leadership contest. Major had been at home in Huntingdon recovering from a wisdom tooth operation during the first leadership ballot. Thatcher's nomination papers for the second ballot were sent to him by car for him to sign \u2013 it later emerged that he had signed both Thatcher's papers and a set of papers for his own candidacy in case she withdrew.\n\nUnlike in the first ballot, a candidate only required a simple majority of Conservative MPs to win, in this case 186 of 372 MPs. The ballot was held on the afternoon of 27 November; although Major fell two votes short of the required winning total, he polled far enough ahead of both Douglas Hurd and [[Michael Heseltine]] to secure immediate concessions from them. With no remaining challengers, Major was formally named Leader of the Conservative Party that evening and was duly appointed Prime Minister the following day. He was the first Prime Minister younger than the Monarch since [[Stanley Baldwin]] (under [[George V]] between 1935 and 1936).\n\n==Prime Minister==\n{{Infobox administration\n| image = John Major 1996.jpg\n| image_size = \n| name = Premiership of John Major\n| term_start = 28 November 1990\n| term_end = 2 May 1997\n| premier = John Major\n| premier_link = Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n| cabinet = [[First Major ministry|1st Major ministry]]<br />[[Second Major ministry|2nd Major ministry]]\n| party = [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n| election = [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]]\n| appointer = Elizabeth II\n| seat = [[10 Downing Street]]\n| predecessor = [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]]\n| successor = [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Tony Blair]]\n| seal = Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (HM Government).svg\n| seal_size = \n| seal_caption = Royal Arms of the Government\n| official_url = \n}}\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of John Major]], [[Prime ministership of John Major]] -->\n{{Further|First Major ministry|Second Major ministry}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = \n   | footer    =\n   | image1    = Arcbushmaj.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Major with President [[George H.

The Conservatives had been consistently behind Labour in the opinion polls since 1989, and the gap had widened significantly during 1990. Within two months of Major becoming Prime Minister, Major was required to lead Britain through the first [[Gulf War]], playing a key role in persuading US President [[George H. W. Bush]] to support [[no-fly zone]]s. During this period, Major and his Cabinet survived an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] assassination attempt by [[Downing Street mortar attack|mortar attack]]. The Conservatives managed to regain a lead in the opinion polls after this period, with polls also showing Major as the most popular Prime Minister since [[Harold Macmillan]] in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/673348.stm John Major: A life in politics], BBC News, 28 September 2002.</ref>\n\nIn spite of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]] [[Neil Kinnock]]'s repeated calls for an immediate general election after Major became Prime Minister, it wasn't until March 1992 that Major called an election for 9 April. Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned [[soapbox]] as he had done in his days on Lambeth Council. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting [[Negative campaigning|negative campaign]] advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. During the campaign, both parties were either tied or within one point of each other in opinion polls, leading to uncertainty over who would win \u2013 or whether there would be an outright election winner at all. On the night of the election, exit polls indicated a very slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into either a [[hung parliament]] or a small Labour majority, with Major's best hope of retaining power being with the Tories remaining in government as a minority government or as part of a coalition.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 March 2010 | date=29 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nDespite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election outright, gaining in excess of 14&nbsp;million votes, the highest popular vote ever recorded by a British political party in a general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons (down from a majority of 102 seats at the previous election), this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.\n\nMajor's Brixton roots were used in a campaign poster during the Conservative Party's 1992 election campaign: \"What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton?

On 16 September 1992, the UK was forced to exit the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) in difficult circumstances, in a day which would come to be known as \"Black Wednesday\", with billions of pounds wasted in a futile attempt to defend the value of sterling. The upheaval caused by the day's events was such that Major came close to resigning as Prime Minister, preparing an unsent letter of resignation addressed to the Queen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foi/story/0,,1409254,00.html|title=Treasury papers reveal cost of Black Wednesday |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 February 2005|accessdate=2 October 2006  | first=Matthew | last=Tempest}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1483186/Major-was-ready-to-quit-over-Black-Wednesday.html|title= Major was ready to quit over Black Wednesday|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= 10 February 2005|accessdate=30 September 2009  | first1=Toby | last1=Helm}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Major continued to defend Britain's membership of the ERM, stating that \"the ERM was the medicine to cure the ailment, but it was not the ailment\", the disaster of Black Wednesday left the Government's economic credibility irreparably damaged.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=341}} Major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before eventually sacking [[Norman Lamont]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], replacing him with [[Kenneth Clarke]]. This came after months of press criticism of Lamont during his 1993 budget and a heavy defeat at a by-election in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. His delay in sacking Lamont was exploited by Major's critics both inside and outside of his party, who used it to claim Major was too indecisive. Immediately after Black Wednesday, the Conservatives fell far behind Labour in the opinion polls and Major would never be able to regain the lead for the rest of his time as Prime Minister, being trounced in local council elections and the European Parliament elections on the way, as well as suffering a string of by-election defeats which gradually wiped out the Conservative majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/historical-polls/voting-intention-1992-1997 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWithin a year of his triumphant election victory, public opinion on Major plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the [[Maastricht Treaty|Maastricht]] dispute and high unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister. Newspapers which traditionally supported the Conservatives and had championed Major at the election were now being severely critical of him almost daily.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/leading-article-john-major-is-he-up-to-the-job-1453316.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=4 April 1993 | title=Leading Article: John Major: Is he up to the job?}}</ref> The UK's forced withdrawal from the ERM was succeeded by a partial economic recovery with a new policy of flexible [[exchange rate]]s, allowing lower interest rates and [[devaluation]], thereby increasing demand for UK goods in export markets. The recession that had started shortly before Major became Prime Minister was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%. Unemployment also started to fall; it had stood at nearly 3 million by the end of 1992, but by the spring of 1997 it had fallen to 1.7&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1993: Recession over&nbsp;\u2013 it's official |publisher=BBC News |date=26 April 1962 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/wanted-a-wartsandall-tally-of-uks-jobless-1316516.html |title=Wanted: a warts-and-all tally of UK's jobless&nbsp;\u2013 Business, News |work=The Independent |location=London |date=30 December 1996 |accessdate=17 April 2010  | first=John | last=Philpott}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nOn becoming Prime Minister, Major had promised to keep Britain \"at the very heart of Europe\", and claimed to have won \"game, set and match for Britain\" \u2013 by negotiating the Social Chapter and Single Currency opt-outs from the [[Maastricht Treaty]], and by ensuring that there was no overt mention of a \"Federal\" Europe and that foreign and defence policy were kept as matters of inter-governmental co-operation, in separate \"pillars\" from the supranational European Union. By 2010 some of these concessions, although not Britain's non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.\n\nEven these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] wing of Major's party and his Cabinet, as the Government attempted to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in the first half of 1993. Although Labour supported the treaty, they tactically opposed certain provisions of the Treaty to exploit divisions in the Government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the Social Chapter aspects of the Treaty before it could be ratified. On 22 July 1993, several Conservative MPs, known as the [[Maastricht Rebels]], voted against the Treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, which he declared as a [[1993 vote of confidence in the Major ministry|vote of confidence]]. He won the vote but the damage had been done to his authority in Parliament.\n\nLater that day, Major gave an interview to [[ITN]]'s [[Michael Brunson]]. During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: \"Just think it through from my perspective. You are the Prime Minister, with a majority of 18&nbsp;... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? What's [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s maxim?\"<ref>The maxim referred to is Johnson's comment about [[J. Edgar Hoover]]: Johnson had once sought a way to remove Hoover from his post as head of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), but upon realising that the problems involved in such a plan were insurmountable, he accepted Hoover's presence philosophically, reasoning that it would be \"better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in\".</ref> Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to \"former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities\",{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=343\u201344}} but many journalists suggested that the three were [[Peter Lilley]], [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Howard]], three of the more prominent \"[[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s\" within his Cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk|title=Major hits out at Cabinet|first1=Paul|last1=Routledge|first2=Simon|last2=Hoggart|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 July 1993|accessdate=10 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Throughout the rest of Major's time as Prime Minister the exact identity of the three was blurred, with [[John Redwood]]'s name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and widely reported, embarrassing Major.\n\nBy April 1993, a mere 12 months after his general election triumph, John Major's popularity as Prime Minister had slumped. As well as his party's dismal showings in the opinion polls, Major's own personal ratings in opinion polls were similarly low. He was now being reviled on an almost daily basis by newspapers whose support the Conservatives had once appeared to have taken for granted. Critics from all corners were also criticising his 'consensus' approach to politics, which contrasted sharply to the confrontational approach of [[Margaret Thatcher]] \u2013 while others were keen to point out that Major's conciliatory approach to the job was something that many observers had been hoping for when Thatcher left office in 1990. Comparisons were being drawn up with an earlier Conservative prime minister, [[Anthony Eden]] \u2013 who had risen through the ranks as a highly respected government minister before becoming prime minister, only to be seen as a disappointment after he did take over.\n\nArguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to succeed [[Jacques Delors]] as [[President of the European Commission]] for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views, [[Jacques Santer]], instead. Around this time Major \u2013 who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as \"Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels\" \u2013 tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly enlarged European Union (i.e. making it easier for Britain, in alliance with other countries, to block federalist measures). After Major had to back down on this issue [[Tony Marlow]] called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with [[mad cow disease]] \u2013 the British government withheld co-operation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted, only a timetable of lifting it. The conflict has been named the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#The ban on British beef|Beef war]]. By April 2013, [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#Epidemiology|vCJD]] \u2013 the human form of the disease \u2013 had killed 280 people (176 of them in Britain).\n\nFor the rest of Major's premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives, including Chancellor [[Ken Clarke]], favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire [[James Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]] had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.\n\n===Bosnia===\nMajor's premiership saw the ongoing war in [[Bosnia]]. Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose airstrikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Government's reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a \"level killing field\" and that airstrikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort. This policy was criticised by Thatcher and others who saw the Bosnian Muslims as the main victims of Serb aggression and compared the situation to events in the Second World War. The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], by contrast, was committed to a policy of \"lift and strike\" (lifting the arms embargo and inflicting airstrikes on the Serbs) causing tensions in the \"special relationship\" ([[Douglas Hurd]] and others strongly opposed this policy).\n\n[[File:Sea King HC4 with PM John Major Sarajevo 1996.JPEG|thumb|A [[Westland Sea King]] helicopter carrying Major above the Ilidza Compound in [[Sarajevo, Bosnia]], during [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] in 1996.]]\nSome commentators compared the Major Government's policy to \"amoral equivalency\" because it appeared to judge the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs equally culpable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bogdanor |first=Vernon |url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |title=No apologies for Bosnia  |publisher=Bosnia.org.uk |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724040607/http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |archive-date=24 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> To some extent, these critics of Major's policy were later vindicated when, in an article published in 2011, the then-Defence Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]] accepted that the arms embargo was a \"serious mistake\" by the UN.<ref>{{cite web|last=Attila |first=Marko |url=http://greatersurbiton.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/sir-malcolm-rifkind-arms-embargo-on-bosnia-was-the-most-serious-mistake-made-by-the-un/ |title=Sir Malcolm Rifkind: Arms embargo on Bosnia was 'the most serious mistake made by the UN' \" Greater Surbiton |publisher=Greatersurbiton.wordpress.com |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nMajor opened talks with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) upon taking office.

The [[Downing Street Declaration]] was issued on 15 December 1993 by Major and [[Albert Reynolds]], the Irish [[Taoiseach]], with whom he had a friendly relationship: an IRA ceasefire followed in 1994. In the House of Commons, Major refused to sign up to the first draft of the \"[[George J. Mitchell|Mitchell]] Principles\", which resulted in the ending of the ceasefire. Major paved the way for the Good Friday Agreement, also known as the 'Belfast Agreement', which was signed after he left office.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Good-Friday-Agreement |title=Good Friday Agreement |encyclopedia= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date= 15 April 2019}}</ref>\nIn March 1995, Major refused to answer the phone calls of United States President [[Bill Clinton]] for several days because of his anger at Clinton's decision to invite Gerry Adams to the [[White House]] for [[Saint Patrick's Day|St Patrick's Day]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,12271,1243638,00.html|title='Mandela helped me survive Monicagate, Arafat could not make the leap to peace&nbsp;\u2013 and for days John Major wouldn't take my calls'|work=The Guardian |location=London | date= 21 June 2004 | accessdate=17 September 2006 | first=Alan | last=Rusbridger}}</ref>\n\n===Rail===\nFrom 1994 to 1997, Major [[privatisation of British Rail|privatised British Rail]], splitting it up into [[Passenger rail franchising in Great Britain|franchises to be run by the private sector]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=12| title=Railways Act 1993| author=Her Majesty's Government | year=1903| website=The Railways Archive| publisher=originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office| accessdate=26 November 2006}}</ref> The process was controversial at the time, and the [[Impact of the privatisation of British Rail|effect of privatising the railway]] is still disputed, with large growth in passenger numbers and increasing efficiency matched by large public subsidy<ref>{{cite news|title= Have train fares gone up or down since British Rail?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21056703|accessdate=2 August 2015|date=22 January 2013|publisher=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/regulation-industry/what-would-we-consider-a-successful-railway-system|title=What would we consider a successful railway system?|last=Southwood|first=Ben|date=19 August 2014|publisher=[[Adam Smith Institute]]|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref> and concern about foreign companies running British railways.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/revealed-how-the-world-gets-rich-from-privatising-british-public-services-9874048.html|title=Revealed: How the world gets rich \u2013 from privatising British public services|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate= 30 December 2015|date=20 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===\"Sleaze\"===\nAt the 1993 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Conference, Major began the \"[[Back to Basics (campaign)|Back to Basics]]\" campaign, which he intended to also be about a wide variety of issues including the economy, education and policing, but which was interpreted by many (including Conservative cabinet ministers) purely in the context of returning to the moral and [[family values]] that they associated with the Conservative Party.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=403\u201308}}\n\nInstead of being well received, \"Back to Basics\" instead became synonymous with scandal, often exposed in lurid and embarrassing detail by [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid newspapers]] such as ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''.

Later, [[David Willetts]] resigned as [[Paymaster General]] after he was accused of rigging evidence to do with ''Cash for Questions''.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=476, 500\u201301, 691}}\n\nDefence Minister [[Jonathan Aitken]] was accused by the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[investigative journalism]] series ''[[World in Action]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper of secretly doing deals with leading Saudi princes. He denied all accusations and promised to wield the \"sword of truth\" in libel proceedings which he brought against ''The Guardian'' and the producers of ''World in Action'' [[Granada Television]]. At an early stage in the trial, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently (after the Major government had fallen from power) convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=480, 500\u201302}}\n\nMajor attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries \u2013 the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=344\u201345, 501}}\n\nAlthough [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]] stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, both Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamilton's case by the former BBC Reporter [[Martin Bell]], who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=717\u201319}}\n\nMajor later commented in his memoirs on the \"routine\" with which he would be telephoned over the weekend to be warned of the latest embarrassing story due to break. He wrote that he took a stern line against financial impropriety, but was angered at the way in which a host of scandals, many of them petty sexual misdemeanours by a small number of MPs, were exploited by the press and Opposition for political advantage. He also conceded that the issue \"fed the public belief that the Conservative(s)&nbsp;... had been in government too long, and had got into bad habits\" and quoted Labour's claim in 1997: \"Nothing better encapsulates what people think of this government. Sleaze will be one of the things which brings this government down.\"{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=550\u201352}}\n\n===Leadership crisis===\nOn 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting [[1995 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] \u2013 he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority. [[John Redwood]] resigned as [[Secretary of State for Wales]] to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwood's 89, with 12 spoiled ballots, eight 'active' abstentions and two MPs abstaining, enough to easily win in the first round. The amount was three more than the target he had privately set himself, having earlier resolved to resign if he could not carry the support of at least 215 of his MPs, the two-thirds threshold of his own parliamentary party.{{sfn|Major|1999}}\n\n''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front-page headline \"Redwood versus Deadwood\".<ref>{{cite news |title=PM assails 'malcontent' Redwood |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Donald | last1=Macintyre | first2=Colin | last2=Brown | date=27 June 1995}}</ref>\n\n===1997 election and resignation===\nMajor's comfortable re-election as Conservative Leader failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to improve the popularity of the Conservative Party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By-election losses and defections meant that in December 1996, the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, leading what had effectively become a minority government, and called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major had deliberately delayed the election until close to the last possible moment in the hope that a still-improving economy would help the Conservatives hold a greater number of seats, and that voters would be deterred from Labour by exposing the party's policies with slogans like \"New Labour, New Danger\". He was also accused by the opposition of proroguing Parliament earlier than usual for political purposes, to delay the publication of a report into the \"Cash for Questions\" scandal.<ref>{{cite news | author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | title        = Fury as sleaze report buried | url          = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/mar/19/conservatives.uk | work         = The Guardian | location     = London | date         = 19 March 1997 | access-date  =10 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Major, his attempts to win public support and swing the election in favour of the Tories did not work. Even ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, which had championed the Conservatives five years earlier and claimed to have won the 1992 general election for the party, declared its support for [[Tony Blair]]'s \"New Labour\", condemning the Tories as \"tired, divided and rudderless\".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|worst electoral defeat]] by a ruling party since the [[Reform Act 1832]]. In the new Parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179; it was the lowest number of Conservative seats in Parliament for over a century, and the new political landscape appeared likely to guarantee Labour at least two successive parliamentary terms in government. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with a reduced majority of 18,140, but 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet Ministers such as Norman Lamont, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo. The huge election defeat also left the Conservatives without any MPs in Scotland or Wales for the first time in history. The party would not return to government until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], and did not win a parliamentary majority until [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], which only lasted two years.\n\nThe following day Major travelled to [[Buckingham Palace]] to inform the Queen of his resignation as Prime Minister. Shortly before this he had announced his intention to also resign as Conservative Leader, giving his final statement outside [[10 Downing Street]] in which he said; \"When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage\u2014and that is what I propose to do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page824.html|title=Mr Major's Resignation Statement|date=27 June 2011}}</ref> Major then announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to [[The Oval]] to watch [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] play cricket.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\n==Final years in Parliament==\nAlthough many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]], his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip, [[Alastair Goodlad]], both pleaded with him to stay on. They argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=38\u201339}} Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony.\"{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\nMajor served as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] for seven weeks while the [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to replace him was underway. He formed [[Shadow Cabinet of John Major|a temporary Shadow Cabinet]], but with seven of his Cabinet Ministers having lost their seats at the election, and with few senior MPs left to replace them, several MPs had to hold multiple briefs.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major himself served as [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Defence]], and the office of [[Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland|Shadow Scotland Secretary]] was left vacant until after the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] as the party had no MPs from Scotland.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major's resignation as Conservative Leader formally took effect on 19 June 1997 after the election of [[William Hague]].

In spite of this, conflict raged within the parliamentary Conservative Party, particularly over the extent of Britain's integration with the [[European Union]].

The additional bitterness on the right wing of the Conservative Party at the manner in which [[Margaret Thatcher]] had been deposed did not make Major's task any easier.

[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] from 1990 to 1997. Major was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher Government]] from 1989 to 1990, and was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] from 1979 until his retirement in 2001. Since the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 2013, he has been both the oldest and earliest-serving of all [[Living prime ministers of the United Kingdom|living former prime ministers]].\n\nBorn in [[St Helier, London|St Helier, Surrey]], Major grew up in [[Brixton]]. He initially worked as an insurance clerk, and then at the [[London Electricity Board]], before becoming an executive at [[Standard Chartered]]. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, Assistant Whip and as a Minister for Social Security. In 1987, he joined the Cabinet as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], and was promoted to foreign secretary two years later. Just three months later in October 1989, he was appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, where he presented the 1990 budget. Major became prime minister after Thatcher resigned in November 1990. He presided over British participation in the [[Gulf War]] in March 1991, and negotiated the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/dec/11/european-council-maastricht |title=European Council (Maastricht) |website=Hansard |date=11 December 1991 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> He went on to lead the Conservatives to a record fourth consecutive electoral victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history with over 14&nbsp;million votes at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], albeit with a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, in what came to be known as [[Black Wednesday]] (September 1992), his government was forced to withdraw the [[pound sterling]] from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. This event led to a loss of confidence in Conservative economic policies and Major was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again.\n\nDespite the eventual revival of economic growth amongst other successes such as the beginnings of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], by the mid-1990s, the Conservative Party was embroiled in scandals involving various MPs (including cabinet ministers). Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as party leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by [[John Redwood]] but was easily re-elected. By this time, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had moved toward the [[Centrism|centre]] under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and won many by-elections, eventually depriving Major's government of a parliamentary majority in December 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Major minority|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-major-minority-1314246.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=13 December 1996}}</ref> Major went on to lose the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] five months later, in one of the largest electoral defeats since the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832.\n\nMajor was succeeded by [[William Hague]] as Leader of the Conservative Party in June 1997. He went on to retire from active politics, leaving the House of Commons at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]]. In 1999, a BBC Radio 4 poll [[Historical rankings of prime ministers of the United Kingdom|ranked him 17th of 19]] among 20th-century British prime ministers;<ref>{{cite news|title=Churchill 'greatest PM of 20th Century'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/579061.stm|publisher=BBC|date=26 December 1999|accessdate=20 October 2018}}</ref> in 2016, a [[Historical rankings of prime ministers of the United Kingdom#2016 University of Leeds survey|University of Leeds survey]] ranked him 6th of 13 among post-war prime ministers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Britain's post-war prime ministers ranked by politics experts |url=https://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/3930/britains_post-war_prime_ministers_ranked_by_politics_experts |publisher=University of Leeds |accessdate=6 December 2019 |date=13 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nMajor was born on 29 March 1943 at [[St Helier Hospital|St Helier Hospital and Queen Mary's Hospital for Children]] in [[St Helier, London|St Helier]], Surrey, the son of Gwen Major (n\u00e9e Coates, 1905\u20131970) and former [[music hall]] performer [[Tom Major-Ball]] (1879\u20131962), who was sixty-three years old when Major was born.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sole.org.uk/johnmajor.htm |title=Ex Prime Minister Sir John Major and his Sewell Ancestors |publisher=Sole.org.uk |accessdate=22 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030417/http://www.sole.org.uk/johnmajor.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was christened \"John Roy Major\" but only \"John Major\" was recorded on his [[birth certificate]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=V%2FaNpVve33l1lx1XfR4O5g&scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=2 January 2018|website=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}</ref> He used his middle name until the early 1980s.<ref name=\"number2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/prime-ministers-in-history/john-major |title=John Major |website=History and Tour |publisher=[[10 Downing Street]] |accessdate=31 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011051246/http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/prime-ministers-in-history/john-major |archivedate=11 October 2008 }}</ref> Major grew up in Longfellow Road, [[Worcester Park]], Surrey, where he attended primary school at Cheam Common and from 1954, he attended [[Rutlish School]], a grammar school in the [[London Borough of Merton]].\n\nIn 1955, with his father's garden ornaments business in decline, the family moved to [[Brixton]]. The following year, Major watched his first debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], where [[Harold Macmillan]] presented his only Budget as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], and has attributed his political ambitions to that event.<ref name=\"number2\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Harold MacMillan's only budget|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/budget97/background/bud1945_79.shtml|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nMajor left school just before his 16th birthday in 1959 with three [[General Certificate of Education|O-levels]] in History, English Language and English Literature.

Disliking this job, he resigned. Major joined the [[Young Conservatives (UK)|Young Conservatives]] in Brixton at this time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Young Conservatives|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page1279.html|website=John Major|accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref> Major was almost nineteen years old when his father died, at the age of 82 on 27 March 1962.

He had in fact passed all of the necessary tests but had been passed over owing to his height.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=30}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=18}}\n\nAfter a period of unemployment, Major started working at the [[London Electricity Board]] in 1963 which is where incidentally his successor as Prime Minister, [[Tony Blair]], also worked when he was young. He later decided to undertake a correspondence course in banking. Major took up a post as an executive at the [[Standard Chartered |Standard Chartered Bank]] in May 1965 and he rose quickly through the ranks.

He won the seat in the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]].<ref name=\"johnmajor8\"/> Following boundary changes, Major became the MP for the newly formed seat of [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] in [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] (retaining the seat in [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]] and [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]] before retiring from Parliament in [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]]).\n\nHe was appointed as a [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] in January 1981, becoming an [[whip (politics)|assistant whip]] in 1983.

Two years later, in a surprise July 1989 reshuffle, Major succeeded [[Geoffrey Howe]] as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. The rapid promotion surprised many, due to Major's relative lack of experience in the Cabinet. Just three months later, in October 1989, Major was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the sudden resignation of [[Nigel Lawson]]. This meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the [[Great Offices of State]].\n\nAs Chancellor, Major presented only one Budget, the first to be televised live, in early 1990. He publicised it as ''a budget for savings'' and announced the [[Tax-exempt special savings account|Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account]] (TESSA), arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household [[Average propensity to save|savings ratio]] that had been apparent during the previous [[Fiscal year|financial year]]. In June 1990, Major suggested that the proposed Single European Currency should be a \"hard [[wikt:ecu|ecu]]\", competing against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and [[Douglas Hurd]], Major's successor as Foreign Secretary, persuaded Thatcher to support British entry to the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a move which she had resisted for many years, and which had played a part in the resignation of Nigel Lawson.<ref>Edmund Dell, ''The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945\u201390'' (HarperCollins, 1997), pp. 541\u201350.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Michael Heseltine]] challenged Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|in November 1990]], Major and Douglas Hurd were the proposer and seconder on her nomination papers for the leadership ballot. After Thatcher was unable to win enough support to prevent a second ballot, she announced her resignation as Prime Minister and Conservative Leader. Major subsequently announced on 22 November that he would stand in the second ballot. A close ally of Thatcher, Major was supported by her during the remainder of the leadership contest. Major had been at home in Huntingdon recovering from a wisdom tooth operation during the first leadership ballot. Thatcher's nomination papers for the second ballot were sent to him by car for him to sign \u2013 it later emerged that he had signed both Thatcher's papers and a set of papers for his own candidacy in case she withdrew.\n\nUnlike in the first ballot, a candidate only required a simple majority of Conservative MPs to win, in this case 186 of 372 MPs. The ballot was held on the afternoon of 27 November; although Major fell two votes short of the required winning total, he polled far enough ahead of both Douglas Hurd and [[Michael Heseltine]] to secure immediate concessions from them. With no remaining challengers, Major was formally named Leader of the Conservative Party that evening and was duly appointed Prime Minister the following day. He was the first Prime Minister younger than the Monarch since [[Stanley Baldwin]] (under [[George V]] between 1935 and 1936).\n\n==Prime Minister==\n{{Infobox administration\n| image = John Major 1996.jpg\n| image_size = \n| name = Premiership of John Major\n| term_start = 28 November 1990\n| term_end = 2 May 1997\n| premier = John Major\n| premier_link = Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n| cabinet = [[First Major ministry|1st Major ministry]]<br />[[Second Major ministry|2nd Major ministry]]\n| party = [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n| election = [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]]\n| appointer = Elizabeth II\n| seat = [[10 Downing Street]]\n| predecessor = [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]]\n| successor = [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Tony Blair]]\n| seal = Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (HM Government).svg\n| seal_size = \n| seal_caption = Royal Arms of the Government\n| official_url = \n}}\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of John Major]], [[Prime ministership of John Major]] -->\n{{Further|First Major ministry|Second Major ministry}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = \n   | footer    =\n   | image1    = Arcbushmaj.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Major with President [[George H.

The Conservatives had been consistently behind Labour in the opinion polls since 1989, and the gap had widened significantly during 1990. Within two months of Major becoming Prime Minister, Major was required to lead Britain through the first [[Gulf War]], playing a key role in persuading US President [[George H. W. Bush]] to support [[no-fly zone]]s. During this period, Major and his Cabinet survived an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] assassination attempt by [[Downing Street mortar attack|mortar attack]]. The Conservatives managed to regain a lead in the opinion polls after this period, with polls also showing Major as the most popular Prime Minister since [[Harold Macmillan]] in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/673348.stm John Major: A life in politics], BBC News, 28 September 2002.</ref>\n\nIn spite of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]] [[Neil Kinnock]]'s repeated calls for an immediate general election after Major became Prime Minister, it wasn't until March 1992 that Major called an election for 9 April. Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned [[soapbox]] as he had done in his days on Lambeth Council. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting [[Negative campaigning|negative campaign]] advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. During the campaign, both parties were either tied or within one point of each other in opinion polls, leading to uncertainty over who would win \u2013 or whether there would be an outright election winner at all. On the night of the election, exit polls indicated a very slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into either a [[hung parliament]] or a small Labour majority, with Major's best hope of retaining power being with the Tories remaining in government as a minority government or as part of a coalition.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 March 2010 | date=29 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nDespite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election outright, gaining in excess of 14&nbsp;million votes, the highest popular vote ever recorded by a British political party in a general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons (down from a majority of 102 seats at the previous election), this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.\n\nMajor's Brixton roots were used in a campaign poster during the Conservative Party's 1992 election campaign: \"What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton? They made him Prime Minister.\"{{sfn|Bennett|1996}}\n\n===Black Wednesday===\n{{Main|Black Wednesday}}\nMajor's second honeymoon as Prime Minister following his election victory did not last long. On 16 September 1992, the UK was forced to exit the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) in difficult circumstances, in a day which would come to be known as \"Black Wednesday\", with billions of pounds wasted in a futile attempt to defend the value of sterling. The upheaval caused by the day's events was such that Major came close to resigning as Prime Minister, preparing an unsent letter of resignation addressed to the Queen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foi/story/0,,1409254,00.html|title=Treasury papers reveal cost of Black Wednesday |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 February 2005|accessdate=2 October 2006  | first=Matthew | last=Tempest}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1483186/Major-was-ready-to-quit-over-Black-Wednesday.html|title= Major was ready to quit over Black Wednesday|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= 10 February 2005|accessdate=30 September 2009  | first1=Toby | last1=Helm}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Major continued to defend Britain's membership of the ERM, stating that \"the ERM was the medicine to cure the ailment, but it was not the ailment\", the disaster of Black Wednesday left the Government's economic credibility irreparably damaged.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=341}} Major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before eventually sacking [[Norman Lamont]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], replacing him with [[Kenneth Clarke]]. This came after months of press criticism of Lamont during his 1993 budget and a heavy defeat at a by-election in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. His delay in sacking Lamont was exploited by Major's critics both inside and outside of his party, who used it to claim Major was too indecisive. Immediately after Black Wednesday, the Conservatives fell far behind Labour in the opinion polls and Major would never be able to regain the lead for the rest of his time as Prime Minister, being trounced in local council elections and the European Parliament elections on the way, as well as suffering a string of by-election defeats which gradually wiped out the Conservative majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/historical-polls/voting-intention-1992-1997 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWithin a year of his triumphant election victory, public opinion on Major plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the [[Maastricht Treaty|Maastricht]] dispute and high unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister. Newspapers which traditionally supported the Conservatives and had championed Major at the election were now being severely critical of him almost daily.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/leading-article-john-major-is-he-up-to-the-job-1453316.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=4 April 1993 | title=Leading Article: John Major: Is he up to the job?}}</ref> The UK's forced withdrawal from the ERM was succeeded by a partial economic recovery with a new policy of flexible [[exchange rate]]s, allowing lower interest rates and [[devaluation]], thereby increasing demand for UK goods in export markets. The recession that had started shortly before Major became Prime Minister was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%. Unemployment also started to fall; it had stood at nearly 3 million by the end of 1992, but by the spring of 1997 it had fallen to 1.7&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1993: Recession over&nbsp;\u2013 it's official |publisher=BBC News |date=26 April 1962 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/wanted-a-wartsandall-tally-of-uks-jobless-1316516.html |title=Wanted: a warts-and-all tally of UK's jobless&nbsp;\u2013 Business, News |work=The Independent |location=London |date=30 December 1996 |accessdate=17 April 2010  | first=John | last=Philpott}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nOn becoming Prime Minister, Major had promised to keep Britain \"at the very heart of Europe\", and claimed to have won \"game, set and match for Britain\" \u2013 by negotiating the Social Chapter and Single Currency opt-outs from the [[Maastricht Treaty]], and by ensuring that there was no overt mention of a \"Federal\" Europe and that foreign and defence policy were kept as matters of inter-governmental co-operation, in separate \"pillars\" from the supranational European Union. By 2010 some of these concessions, although not Britain's non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.\n\nEven these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] wing of Major's party and his Cabinet, as the Government attempted to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in the first half of 1993. Although Labour supported the treaty, they tactically opposed certain provisions of the Treaty to exploit divisions in the Government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the Social Chapter aspects of the Treaty before it could be ratified. On 22 July 1993, several Conservative MPs, known as the [[Maastricht Rebels]], voted against the Treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, which he declared as a [[1993 vote of confidence in the Major ministry|vote of confidence]]. He won the vote but the damage had been done to his authority in Parliament.\n\nLater that day, Major gave an interview to [[ITN]]'s [[Michael Brunson]]. During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: \"Just think it through from my perspective. You are the Prime Minister, with a majority of 18&nbsp;... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? What's [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s maxim?\"<ref>The maxim referred to is Johnson's comment about [[J. Edgar Hoover]]: Johnson had once sought a way to remove Hoover from his post as head of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), but upon realising that the problems involved in such a plan were insurmountable, he accepted Hoover's presence philosophically, reasoning that it would be \"better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in\".</ref> Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to \"former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities\",{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=343\u201344}} but many journalists suggested that the three were [[Peter Lilley]], [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Howard]], three of the more prominent \"[[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s\" within his Cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk|title=Major hits out at Cabinet|first1=Paul|last1=Routledge|first2=Simon|last2=Hoggart|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 July 1993|accessdate=10 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Throughout the rest of Major's time as Prime Minister the exact identity of the three was blurred, with [[John Redwood]]'s name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and widely reported, embarrassing Major.\n\nBy April 1993, a mere 12 months after his general election triumph, John Major's popularity as Prime Minister had slumped. As well as his party's dismal showings in the opinion polls, Major's own personal ratings in opinion polls were similarly low. He was now being reviled on an almost daily basis by newspapers whose support the Conservatives had once appeared to have taken for granted. Critics from all corners were also criticising his 'consensus' approach to politics, which contrasted sharply to the confrontational approach of [[Margaret Thatcher]] \u2013 while others were keen to point out that Major's conciliatory approach to the job was something that many observers had been hoping for when Thatcher left office in 1990. Comparisons were being drawn up with an earlier Conservative prime minister, [[Anthony Eden]] \u2013 who had risen through the ranks as a highly respected government minister before becoming prime minister, only to be seen as a disappointment after he did take over.\n\nArguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to succeed [[Jacques Delors]] as [[President of the European Commission]] for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views, [[Jacques Santer]], instead. Around this time Major \u2013 who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as \"Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels\" \u2013 tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly enlarged European Union (i.e. making it easier for Britain, in alliance with other countries, to block federalist measures). After Major had to back down on this issue [[Tony Marlow]] called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with [[mad cow disease]] \u2013 the British government withheld co-operation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted, only a timetable of lifting it. The conflict has been named the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#The ban on British beef|Beef war]]. By April 2013, [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#Epidemiology|vCJD]] \u2013 the human form of the disease \u2013 had killed 280 people (176 of them in Britain).\n\nFor the rest of Major's premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives, including Chancellor [[Ken Clarke]], favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire [[James Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]] had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.\n\n===Bosnia===\nMajor's premiership saw the ongoing war in [[Bosnia]]. Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose airstrikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Government's reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a \"level killing field\" and that airstrikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort. This policy was criticised by Thatcher and others who saw the Bosnian Muslims as the main victims of Serb aggression and compared the situation to events in the Second World War. The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], by contrast, was committed to a policy of \"lift and strike\" (lifting the arms embargo and inflicting airstrikes on the Serbs) causing tensions in the \"special relationship\" ([[Douglas Hurd]] and others strongly opposed this policy).\n\n[[File:Sea King HC4 with PM John Major Sarajevo 1996.JPEG|thumb|A [[Westland Sea King]] helicopter carrying Major above the Ilidza Compound in [[Sarajevo, Bosnia]], during [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] in 1996.]]\nSome commentators compared the Major Government's policy to \"amoral equivalency\" because it appeared to judge the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs equally culpable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bogdanor |first=Vernon |url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |title=No apologies for Bosnia  |publisher=Bosnia.org.uk |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724040607/http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |archive-date=24 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> To some extent, these critics of Major's policy were later vindicated when, in an article published in 2011, the then-Defence Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]] accepted that the arms embargo was a \"serious mistake\" by the UN.<ref>{{cite web|last=Attila |first=Marko |url=http://greatersurbiton.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/sir-malcolm-rifkind-arms-embargo-on-bosnia-was-the-most-serious-mistake-made-by-the-un/ |title=Sir Malcolm Rifkind: Arms embargo on Bosnia was 'the most serious mistake made by the UN' \" Greater Surbiton |publisher=Greatersurbiton.wordpress.com |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nMajor opened talks with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) upon taking office.

Later, [[David Willetts]] resigned as [[Paymaster General]] after he was accused of rigging evidence to do with ''Cash for Questions''.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=476, 500\u201301, 691}}\n\nDefence Minister [[Jonathan Aitken]] was accused by the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[investigative journalism]] series ''[[World in Action]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper of secretly doing deals with leading Saudi princes. He denied all accusations and promised to wield the \"sword of truth\" in libel proceedings which he brought against ''The Guardian'' and the producers of ''World in Action'' [[Granada Television]]. At an early stage in the trial, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently (after the Major government had fallen from power) convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=480, 500\u201302}}\n\nMajor attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries \u2013 the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=344\u201345, 501}}\n\nAlthough [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]] stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, both Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamilton's case by the former BBC Reporter [[Martin Bell]], who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=717\u201319}}\n\nMajor later commented in his memoirs on the \"routine\" with which he would be telephoned over the weekend to be warned of the latest embarrassing story due to break. He wrote that he took a stern line against financial impropriety, but was angered at the way in which a host of scandals, many of them petty sexual misdemeanours by a small number of MPs, were exploited by the press and Opposition for political advantage. He also conceded that the issue \"fed the public belief that the Conservative(s)&nbsp;... had been in government too long, and had got into bad habits\" and quoted Labour's claim in 1997: \"Nothing better encapsulates what people think of this government. Sleaze will be one of the things which brings this government down.\"{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=550\u201352}}\n\n===Leadership crisis===\nOn 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting [[1995 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] \u2013 he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority. [[John Redwood]] resigned as [[Secretary of State for Wales]] to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwood's 89, with 12 spoiled ballots, eight 'active' abstentions and two MPs abstaining, enough to easily win in the first round. The amount was three more than the target he had privately set himself, having earlier resolved to resign if he could not carry the support of at least 215 of his MPs, the two-thirds threshold of his own parliamentary party.{{sfn|Major|1999}}\n\n''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front-page headline \"Redwood versus Deadwood\".<ref>{{cite news |title=PM assails 'malcontent' Redwood |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Donald | last1=Macintyre | first2=Colin | last2=Brown | date=27 June 1995}}</ref>\n\n===1997 election and resignation===\nMajor's comfortable re-election as Conservative Leader failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to improve the popularity of the Conservative Party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By-election losses and defections meant that in December 1996, the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, leading what had effectively become a minority government, and called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major had deliberately delayed the election until close to the last possible moment in the hope that a still-improving economy would help the Conservatives hold a greater number of seats, and that voters would be deterred from Labour by exposing the party's policies with slogans like \"New Labour, New Danger\". He was also accused by the opposition of proroguing Parliament earlier than usual for political purposes, to delay the publication of a report into the \"Cash for Questions\" scandal.<ref>{{cite news | author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | title        = Fury as sleaze report buried | url          = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/mar/19/conservatives.uk | work         = The Guardian | location     = London | date         = 19 March 1997 | access-date  =10 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Major, his attempts to win public support and swing the election in favour of the Tories did not work. Even ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, which had championed the Conservatives five years earlier and claimed to have won the 1992 general election for the party, declared its support for [[Tony Blair]]'s \"New Labour\", condemning the Tories as \"tired, divided and rudderless\".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|worst electoral defeat]] by a ruling party since the [[Reform Act 1832]]. In the new Parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179; it was the lowest number of Conservative seats in Parliament for over a century, and the new political landscape appeared likely to guarantee Labour at least two successive parliamentary terms in government. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with a reduced majority of 18,140, but 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet Ministers such as Norman Lamont, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo. The huge election defeat also left the Conservatives without any MPs in Scotland or Wales for the first time in history. The party would not return to government until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], and did not win a parliamentary majority until [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], which only lasted two years.\n\nThe following day Major travelled to [[Buckingham Palace]] to inform the Queen of his resignation as Prime Minister. Shortly before this he had announced his intention to also resign as Conservative Leader, giving his final statement outside [[10 Downing Street]] in which he said; \"When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage\u2014and that is what I propose to do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page824.html|title=Mr Major's Resignation Statement|date=27 June 2011}}</ref> Major then announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to [[The Oval]] to watch [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] play cricket.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\n==Final years in Parliament==\nAlthough many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]], his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip, [[Alastair Goodlad]], both pleaded with him to stay on. They argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=38\u201339}} Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony.\"{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\nMajor served as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] for seven weeks while the [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to replace him was underway. He formed [[Shadow Cabinet of John Major|a temporary Shadow Cabinet]], but with seven of his Cabinet Ministers having lost their seats at the election, and with few senior MPs left to replace them, several MPs had to hold multiple briefs.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major himself served as [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Defence]], and the office of [[Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland|Shadow Scotland Secretary]] was left vacant until after the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] as the party had no MPs from Scotland.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major's resignation as Conservative Leader formally took effect on 19 June 1997 after the election of [[William Hague]]. His [[1997 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours|Resignation Honours]] were announced in August 1997.\n\nMajor remained active in Parliament after his resignation, regularly attending and contributing in debates.

In spite of this, conflict raged within the parliamentary Conservative Party, particularly over the extent of Britain's integration with the [[European Union]]. Major never succeeded in reconciling the \"Euro-rebels\" among his MPs to his European policy, who although relatively few in number, wielded great influence because of his small majority and their wider following among Conservative activists and voters. Episodes such as the Maastricht Rebellion led by [[Bill Cash]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]] inflicted serious political damage on him and his government. The additional bitterness on the right wing of the Conservative Party at the manner in which [[Margaret Thatcher]] had been deposed did not make Major's task any easier. A series of scandals among leading Conservative MPs also did Major and his government no favours. His task became even more difficult after the well-received election of [[Tony Blair]] as [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour leader]] in July 1994.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7593554.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Who has been UK's greatest post-war PM? | date=16 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nMajor defended his government in his memoirs, focusing particularly on how under him the British economy had recovered from the recession of 1990\u20131992.

Players earn XP ([[experience point]]s) for performing certain actions in the game such as plowing land or buying items. At certain XP benchmarks, the player's level rises. As the player obtains more items and progresses through levels, crops and animals become available to them via the \"market\" where items can be purchased using either Farm Coins or Farm Cash. Farm Cash is earned by leveling up or completing offers, or purchased for real money.\n\nThe main way a player earns Farm Coins, the less important of the two in-game currencies, is through harvesting crops or visiting their neighbors. The player does this by paying coins for plowing a unit of land. This readies the land for planting seeds, which will eventually be harvested after a set amount of time. The amount of time it takes for a crop to mature, and how much money a crop yields when harvested, is dependent on the crop planted and is noted on its entry in the \"market\" dialog.<ref name=\"custhelp\">\n{{cite web\n| url = http://zynga.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/583\n| title = How long does it take for a crop to wither?\n| author = \n| authorlink = \n| accessdate = 28 October 2009\n| date = 1 October 2009\n| publisher = [[Zynga]]\n}}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n</ref> They will wither, or they will be of no use when a crop-specific amount of time has elapsed, the amount of time being equal to 2.5 times the amount of time taken to grow the crop (for example, crops which take 8 hours to grow will wither after 2.5\u00d78=20 hours). However, a player can use Farm Cash (purchasable with real-world cash) to purchase an \"unwither\" to rejuvenate the crops or can use a biplane with \"instant grow\" to cause crops to be immediately available for harvest. Although the biplane can be purchased with coins, this special feature is only available for Farm Cash. As a player levels up more, crops with a higher payoff and economy will become available. Sometimes a crop will need a permit that costs Farm Cash in order to be planted.\n\nA player may buy or receive from friends livestock and trees or bushels, such as [[cherry]] trees or [[chicken]]s, which do not wither but instead become ready for harvest for preset amounts of money a set amount of time from their last harvest. Trees and livestock cannot die.\n\n=== In-game purchases ===\nThe two main in-game currencies, Farm Coins and Farm Cash (in ''FarmVille'') or Farm Bucks (in ''FarmVille 2''), are available for purchase from Zynga with real-world money. Coins can also be \"earned\" within the game by completing tasks or selling crops, and can be spent on basic in-game items such as seeds. Farm Cash and Farm Bucks are more difficult to acquire within the game, and cannot be earned within the farm's economic system, only by special actions like leveling up or completing tasks. Farm Cash and Farm Bucks provide a route to acquire further in-game items, such as additional animals for the farm, or to acquire in-game resources like animal feed, water, fuel and power, which are otherwise slow and/or laborious for players to acquire.\n\n===Social interaction===\nLike most Zynga games, ''FarmVille'' incorporates the [[social networking]] aspect of Facebook into many areas of gameplay. Contacting other players allows the player to improve their farm more quickly, by using their help as farmhands or by gaining rewards from helping them. Often the aid of other players is a substitute for Farm Cash, the game's purchasable in-game currency, giving players an effective choice between spamming their friends with ''FarmVille'' messages and requests, or paying real-world cash. ''FarmVille'' has allowed players to add neighbors that are not Facebook friends, thus allowing the player to have many neighbors at hand. Players invite friends or other players that are not Facebook friends to be their neighbors, allowing them to perform five actions on each other's farms per day by \"visiting\" it. Neighbors may also send gifts and supplies to each other, complete specialized tasks together for rewards, and join \"co-ops\" - joint efforts to grow a certain amount of certain crops. Gifts are sent as mystery gifts with expensive, but random items, special deliveries with building supplies, or by choosing a particular item to send. They cost the sending user nothing. For ''FarmVille''{{'}}s 2nd birthday, a series of different mystery gifts were added to the Gifts Page.\n\n==Development==\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n===Partnerships===\n''FarmVille'' occasionally runs in-game partnerships where users can visit another company's virtual farm and buy or receive items with their brand logo.

Often the aid of other players is a substitute for Farm Cash, the game's purchasable in-game currency, giving players an effective choice between spamming their friends with ''FarmVille'' messages and requests, or paying real-world cash. ''FarmVille'' has allowed players to add neighbors that are not Facebook friends, thus allowing the player to have many neighbors at hand. Players invite friends or other players that are not Facebook friends to be their neighbors, allowing them to perform five actions on each other's farms per day by \"visiting\" it. Neighbors may also send gifts and supplies to each other, complete specialized tasks together for rewards, and join \"co-ops\" - joint efforts to grow a certain amount of certain crops. Gifts are sent as mystery gifts with expensive, but random items, special deliveries with building supplies, or by choosing a particular item to send. They cost the sending user nothing. For ''FarmVille''{{'}}s 2nd birthday, a series of different mystery gifts were added to the Gifts Page.\n\n==Development==\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n===Partnerships===\n''FarmVille'' occasionally runs in-game partnerships where users can visit another company's virtual farm and buy or receive items with their brand logo. For example, as of June 9, 2011, users could get free [[McDonald's]] hot air balloons, McCafe products and the ability to visit McDonald's' virtual farm.

A supplement, '''''With One Voice''''' ('''''WOV'''''), contains additional hymns and service music. The ''LBW'' is sometimes called the \"green book\", as opposed to ''With One Voice'', which is bound in blue; or ''[[Service Book and Hymnal]]'', which is bound in red; or ''[[The Lutheran Hymnal]]'', which is also bound in red, with a simple gold cross.\n\n== History ==\nWhen Lutheran churches were first established in North America, the immigrants from [[Germany]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], and other non-English-speaking countries retained services in their native languages. However, as the children and grandchildren of these immigrants began speaking English in their everyday lives and the various Lutheran denominations began uniting, many felt that the North American Lutheran churches needed a common English-language [[liturgy]] and hymns. Although the eighteenth-century missionary [[Henry Melchior Muhlenberg]] had hoped for the day when Lutherans would be \"one church [with] one book\", it was not until the 1888 \"Common Service\" that a majority of English-speaking Lutherans in North America began to use the same texts for worship, albeit with minor adaptations. (Senn, 584-591.) The \"Common Liturgy\" included in the 1958 [[Service Book and Hymnal]] was a major revision of the \"Common Service\", and introduced a Eucharistic Prayer into American Lutheran usage. ''Culto Cristiano'', a 1964 service book, attempted to offer a unified liturgy for Spanish-speaking Lutherans.\n\nThe process leading to the publication of the ''LBW'' was started in 1965 when the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) invited other North American Lutheran denominations to join it to work on a common service book. Together with the LCMS, the [[Lutheran Church in America]], the [[American Lutheran Church]], and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada|Evangelical Lutheran Church of Canada]] formed the '''Inter-Lutheran Commission on Worship''' to undertake this project. The commission conducted its work through four sub-committees: Liturgical Text Committee, Liturgical Music Committee, Hymn Text Committee, Hymn Music Committee. The work of the committees was validated via provisional liturgical and hymn materials, questionnaires, conferences, and dialogs. The Rev. Dr. Eugene Brand was named project director for the development work and The Rev. Leonard Flachman was named publishers' representative and managing editor. The ''LBW'' was published in [[1978 in literature|1978]]. The LCMS pulled out of the ILCW just prior to the publication of the ''LBW'', but having been a participant in the development of the materials its name appears on the title page. The LCMS published its own hymnal, ''[[Lutheran Worship]]'' (LW), in 1982.  Although the ''LW'' liturgies are very similar to those in the ''LBW'', there are differences which reflect differing theologies. For example, ''LW'' lacks the option for a Eucharistic Prayer.\n\nThe ''Lutheran Book of Worship'' has remained in use for thirty years. There are a couple reasons for that longevity. The first is the careful, forward-looking, inclusive work of the ILCW and the four subcommittees. The second is the careful work done by the staff of [[Augsburg Fortress|Augsburg Publishing House]] in selecting and testing the materials with which the book was manufactured. The books did not wear out.\n\nThe first printing of the ''LBW'' was one million copies and required 19 semi-trailers to carry the book from the printer to 14 distribution points around the United States.\n\nWhile it is in its twenty-seventh printing and widely used by the ELCA and the ELCIC, the ''LBW'' was replaced in October 2006 as the primary worship resource in the two denominations by ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]''. The new book is intended to reflect the changing demographic of the church bodies and the subsequent changes in language and ritual practice.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of English-language hymnals by denomination]]\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite book|title=Lutheran Book of Worship|last=|first=|publisher=Augsburg Publishing House and Lutheran Church in America Publication Board|year=1978|isbn=0-8006-3330-X|location=|pages=}}\n*{{Cite book|title=With One Voice|last=|first=|publisher=[[Augsburg Fortress]]|year=1995|isbn=0-8066-0051-9|location=|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/withonevoiceluth00evan}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Christian Liturgy: Catholic and Evangelical|last=Senn|first=Frank C.|publisher=Augsburg Fortress|year=1997|isbn=0-8006-2726-1|location=|pages=}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Encountering God: The Legacy of Lutheran Book of Worship|last=|first=|publisher=Kirk House Publishers|year=1998|isbn=1-886513-15-5|editor-last=Van Loon|editor-first=Ralph R.|location=|pages=}}\n*{{Cite book|title=In the Context of Unity: A History of the Development of Lutheran Book of Worship|last=Quere|first=Ralph W.|publisher=Lutheran University Press|year=2003|isbn=1-932688-00-5|location=|pages=}}\n\n{{Lutheran Divine Service}}\n{{Lutheran hymnody}}\n\n[[Category:Lutheran hymnals]]\n[[Category:1978 books]]\n[[Category:Christian prayer books]]\n[[Category:20th-century Christian texts]]\n[[Category:1978 in music]]\n[[Category:1978 in Christianity]]\n[[Category:Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]]\n[[Category:Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Worship book and hymnal used by several Lutheran denominations in North America}}\n{{italic title}}\n{{Infobox hymnal\n| name            = '''Lutheran Book of Worship'''\n| cover           = Lutheran Book of Worship.JPG\n| caption         = 1978 edition of the ''Lutheran Book of Worship''\n| commissioned_by =\n| approved_for    =\n| country         = United States\n| pages           =\n| publisher       = [[Augsburg Fortress]]\n| released        = 1978\n| number_of_hymns = 569\n| psalms          = 150\n| service_music   =\n| last_hymnal     = ''[[Service Book and Hymnal]]''\n| next_hymnal     = '''''With One Voice'''''\n}}\n{{Infobox hymnal\n| name            = '''With One Voice'''\n| cover           = With One Voice.JPG\n| caption         = 1978 edition of ''With One Voice''\n| commissioned_by =\n| approved_for    =\n| country         = United States\n| pages           =\n| publisher       = [[Augsburg Fortress]]\n| released        = \n| number_of_hymns = \n| psalms          = \n| service_music   =\n| last_hymnal     = '''''Lutheran Book of Worship'''''\n| next_hymnal     = ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]''\n}}\n\nThe '''''Lutheran Book of Worship''''' ('''''LBW''''') is a [[worship]] book and [[hymn]]al used by several [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[religious denomination|denominations]] in [[North America]].

Due to Cobain's reluctance to record multiple takes, Vig claims he often had to trick Cobain by falsely claiming that certain parts were not recorded correctly or were out of tune, and needed to be recorded again. Cobain recorded three vocal takes, with all three takes being used throughout the recording.<ref name=\"classic rock albums\">{{cite book|first1=Charles|last1=Cross R.|authorlink=Charles R.

Due to Cobain's reluctance to record multiple takes, Vig claims he often had to trick Cobain by falsely claiming that certain parts were not recorded correctly or were out of tune, and needed to be recorded again. Cobain recorded three vocal takes, with all three takes being used throughout the recording.<ref name=\"classic rock albums\">{{cite book|first1=Charles|last1=Cross R.|authorlink=Charles R.

They rest and prepare for the journey to rescue their friends and the kidnapped ymbrynes. The group manages to narrow down where their friends may have been taken and, with the help of a boatsman named Sharon, they cross over a polluted river by the name of Fever Ditch to a dilapidated village corrupted with drugs and run by the wights (Devil's Acre). \n\nThere Addison is captured, and Jacob and Emma are shocked to find many peculiar people who have become trapped there and, in some cases, have put themselves up for viewing and sale.  The worst of these peculiars have also become addicted to a specific drug known as ambrosia, which is taken by being poured into the eyes and is supposed to imbue the taker with great physical strength. This has led to frequent fights and matches between peculiars and hollows, where the peculiars take the ambrosia to further augment their abilities. While trying to navigate their way around without being spotted, they are invited into a man's house to take cover. The man, Bentham, is revealed to be the one who caused the explosion in the Siberian tundra that created hollows and essentially wights (as told in the first book), and he is also Miss Peregrine's brother. \n\nTo prove that he truly wants to help, he unveils secret information about the wights and helps Jacob and Emma get into the wights' building using a hollow Jacob rescued from a cage in the fighting ring. The pair sneak into the building and manage to evade capture, but they also stumble upon a hospital complex where many peculiars are having their peculiar souls drained, including Melina and the echolocators. The other peculiar children, however, are nowhere to be found. \n\nEmma and Jacob proceed to stop the draining operations, and successfully find their friends in a basement cell and free them, save for Fiona who had supposedly died when the hollows and wights invaded the loop where the peculiar menagerie were living. With no time to mourn, the group come across the room where all the ymbrynes are being kept, but Caul already knows that Jacob and Emma are here. He then threatens to release a whole horde of hollows into the room with them and the ymbrynes unless Jacob is willing to use his ability to help him find the soul jars hidden in the legendary Library of Souls - a place where it was rumored peculiars kept their souls after their death for others to borrow later, but was later cut off from the rest of peculiardom after a horrible war that was also responsible for scattering peculiars across the world. \n\nDespite that, Jacob does not give in to Caul's demands and instead uses his ability to control the hollows. The group then frees Miss Peregrine and the rest of the trapped ymbrynes and fight their way through the building. The peculiar children manage to keep up a good fight, but in the end are betrayed by Bentham, who wanted nothing more than to prove he could do some good for Miss Peregrine after she banished him, but sought revenge after she refused to forgive him. Caul takes the rest of the peculiars and ymbrynes hostage and forces them along with him to the Library of Souls, which Caul had managed to successfully rediscover.  Here it is discovered that like his grandfather before him, Jacob is the only one who can see the soul jars hidden within the library. With Caul holding his friends hostage, Jacob obediently procures the most powerful soul jars for Caul and his brother, with the other wights dying because of ingesting the souls like ambrosia and not pouring them into a well where the souls can successfully bond with the user. Miss Peregrine's brothers grow into gigantic monsters who eventually end up dueling each other, but thanks to a recipe given to Jacob by Bentham that's used by the ymbrynes as the fight goes on, the library collapses in on Caul and Bentham. \n\nWith the help of Miss Peregrine and Emma following along with them, Jacob returns to his home, where his parents and a new psychiatrist are waiting for him, wanting to know what happened. Miss Peregrine and Emma tell them what happened before Miss Peregrine makes them forget, for the time being, everything that had just been told to them. Jacob and Emma decide to keep a regular correspondence with each other, but this later fails as his parents find a few of Emma's letters and assume Jacob wrote them to himself. They decide to send him to a mental asylum, but on the night they're supposed to leave, Miss Peregrine and her peculiar children come and visit Jacob, affirming his insistence to his shocked parents that the peculiars are indeed real. It is also revealed that, because of the loop closing around them, the internal time clocks of the peculiars have been restored so that they no longer have to worry about the years they've lived in loops catching up to them - they age like regular human beings while being in the present. Closing the book, Emma and Jacob decide to keep being friends for the time being before taking things slow in properly restarting their romantic relationship, now that they have time enough to do so.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:2015 American novels]]\n[[Category:American children's novels]]\n\n[[Category:Dark fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Quirk Books books]]\n[[Category:2015 children's books]]\n[[Category:Novels by Ransom Riggs]]\n", "text_old": "{{all plot|date=March 2017}}\n{{Infobox book\n<!-- |italic title = (see above) -->\n| name             = Library of Souls\n| image            = Library of Souls cover.jpg\n| caption          = \n| author           = [[Ransom Riggs]]\n| title_orig       =\n| translator       =\n| illustrator      =\n| cover_artist     =\n| country          = United States\n| language         = English\n| series           =\n| subject          =\n| genre            = [[Young adult literature]], [[horror literature]], [[dark fantasy]]\n| publisher        = [[Quirk Books]]\n| pub_date         =\n| english_pub_date = September 22, 2015\n| media_type       = Print, e-book, audiobook\n| pages            = 464 pp.\n| isbn             = 9781594747588\n| oclc             =\n| dewey            =\n| congress         =\n| preceded_by      = [[Hollow City (novel)|Hollow City]]\n| followed_by      = [[A Map of Days]]\n}} \n\n'''''Library of Souls''''' is a sequel to 2014 novel ''[[Hollow City (novel)|Hollow City]]'' written by [[Ransom Riggs]] and third book in the series of ''[[Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children]]''.

At the height of its territorial jurisdiction, it covered large parts of what is now [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Bengal proper covered the ethno-linguistic region of [[Bengal]] (present-day [[Bangladesh]] and the [[West Bengal|Indian state of West Bengal]]). [[Calcutta]], the city which grew around Fort William, was the capital of the Bengal Presidency. For many years, the [[Governor of Bengal]] was concurrently the [[Viceroy of India]] and Calcutta was the de facto [[capital of India]] until the early 20th-century.\n\nThe Bengal Presidency emerged from trading posts established in [[Mughal Bengal]] during the reign of Emperor Jahangir in 1612. The Honourable East India Company (HEIC), a British monopoly with a Royal Charter, competed with other European companies to gain influence in Bengal. After the decisive overthrow of the Nawab of Bengal in 1757 and the [[Battle of Buxar]] in 1765, the HEIC expanded its control over much of the Indian subcontinent. This marked the beginning of [[Company rule in India]], when the HEIC emerged as the most powerful military force in the subcontinent. The British Parliament gradually withdrew the monopoly of the HEIC. By the 1850s, the HEIC struggled with finances.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">William Dalrymple (10 September 2019).

Bloomsbury Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-4088-6440-1}}.</ref> After the [[Indian Mutiny]] of 1857, the British government assumed direct administration of India. The Bengal Presidency was re-organized. In the early 20th-century, Bengal emerged as a hotbed of the [[Indian independence movement]], as well as the epicenter of the [[Bengali Renaissance]].\n\nBengal was the economic, cultural and educational hub of the [[British Raj]]. During the period of [[proto-industrialization]], Bengal significantly contributed directly to the [[Industrial revolution]] in Britain, although it was soon overtaken by the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] ruled by [[Tipu Sultan]] as [[South Asia]]'s dominant economic power.<ref name=\"Parthasarathi\">{{Citation |title=Why Europe Grew Rich and Asia Did Not: Global Economic Divergence, 1600\u20131850 |given=Prasannan |surname=Parthasarathi |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-139-49889-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_YEcvo-jqcC}}</ref> When Bengal was reorganized, [[Penang]], [[Singapore]] and [[Malacca]] were separated into the [[Straits Settlements]] in 1867.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/bd541c73-58ef-4bb1-9de7-173f00913286 |title=The Straits Settlements becomes a residency - Singapore History |publisher=Eresources.nlb.gov.sg |date= |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> [[British Burma]] became a province of India and a later a [[Crown Colony]] in itself. Western areas, including the [[Ceded and Conquered Provinces]] and [[Punjab Province (British India)|The Punjab]], were further reorganized. Northeastern areas became [[Colonial Assam]]. The [[Partition of British India]] in 1947 resulted in [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Bengal's division]] on religious grounds.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n[[File:Jahangir of India.jpg|thumb|Jahangir first permitted the East India Company (HEIC) to trade in Bengal]]\nIn 1599, a [[Royal Charter]] was granted by [[Queen Elizabeth I]] to allow the creation of a trading company in [[London]] for the purposes of trade with the East Indies. The governance of the company was placed in the hands of a governor and a 24-member Court of Directors. The corporation became known as the Honourable East India Company (HEIC). It rose to account for half of the world's trade. The company was given a monopoly for British trade in the Indian ocean.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>  \n \nIn 1608, [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Jahangir]] allowed the English East India Company to establish a small trading post on the west coast of India. It was followed in 1611 by a [[factory (trading post)|factory]] on the [[Coromandel Coast]] in South India, and in 1612 the company joined other already established European trading companies to trade in the wealthy [[Bengal Subah]] in the east.<ref>{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. II|1908|pp=452\u2013472}}</ref> However, the power of the Mughal Empire declined from 1707, as the Nawab of Bengal in [[Murshidabad]] became financially independent with the help of bankers such as the [[Jagat Seth]]. The Nawabs began entering into treaties with numerous European companies, including the [[French East India Company]], the [[Dutch East India Company]], and the [[Danish East India Company]]. The Mughal court in [[Delhi]] was weakened by [[Nader Shah]]'s invasion from Persia (1739) and [[Ahmed Shah Durrani]]'s invasion from Afghanistan (1761). The East India Company's victories at the [[Battle of Plassey]] (against the last independent Nawab of Bengal in 1757) and the [[Battle of Buxar]] (against the Nawabs of Bengal and [[Nawab of Oudh|Oudh]] in 1764) led to the abolition of local rule (Nizamat) in Bengal in 1793. The Company gradually began to formally expand its territories across India and [[Southeast Asia]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol.

Acting through [[Lord Cornwallis]], then Governor-General, he ascertained and defined the rights of the landholders over the soil. These landholders under the previous system had started, for the most part, as collectors of the revenues, and gradually acquired certain prescriptive rights as quasi-proprietors of the estates entrusted to them by the government. In 1793 Lord Cornwallis declared their rights perpetual, and gave over the land of Bengal to the previous quasi-proprietors or ''zamindars'', on condition of the payment of a fixed land tax. This piece of legislation is known as the [[Permanent Settlement]] of the Land Revenue. It was designed to \"introduce\" ideas of property rights to India, and stimulate a market in land. The former aim misunderstood the nature of landholding in India, and the latter was an abject failure.\n\nThe ''Cornwallis Code'', while defining the rights of the proprietors, failed to give adequate recognition to the rights of the under-tenants and the cultivators. This remained a serious problem for the duration of British Rule, as throughout the Bengal Presidency ''ryots'' (peasants) found themselves oppressed by rack-renting landlords, who knew that every rupee they could squeeze from their tenants over and above the fixed revenue demanded from the Government represented pure profit. Furthermore, the Permanent Settlement took no account of inflation, meaning that the value of the revenue to Government declined year by year, whilst the heavy burden on the peasantry grew no less. This was compounded in the early 19th century by compulsory schemes for the cultivation of [[opium]] and [[indigo]], the former by the state, and the latter by British planters. Peasants were forced to grow a certain area of these crops, which were then purchased at below market rates for export. This added greatly to rural poverty.\n\nSo unsuccessful was the Permanent Settlement that it was not introduced in the North-Western Provinces (taken from the Marathas during the campaigns of [[Lord Lake]] and [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]]) after 1831, in Punjab after its conquest in 1849, or in [[Oudh]] which was annexed in 1856. These regions were nominally part of the Bengal Presidency, but remained administratively distinct. The area of the Presidency under direct administration was sometimes referred to as Lower Bengal to distinguish it from the Presidency as a whole. Officially Punjab, Agra and Allahabad had Lieutenant-Governors subject to the authority of the Governor of Bengal in Calcutta, but in practice they were more or less independent. The only all-Presidency institutions which remained were the Bengal Army and the Civil Service. The Bengal Army was finally amalgamated into the new [[British-Indian Army]] in 1904\u20135, after a lengthy struggle over its reform between [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], the Commander-in-Chief, and [[Lord Curzon]], the Viceroy.\n\n===Straits Settlements===\nIn 1830, the British Straits Settlements on the coast of the [[Malacca Straits]] was made a residency of the Presidency of Bengal in Calcutta. The area included the erstwhile [[Prince of Wales Island (Malaysia)|Prince of Wales Island]] and [[Province Wellesley]], as well as the ports of [[Malacca]] and [[Singapore]]. Previously, the Straits Settlements (formed by the HEIC in 1826) was administered as a separate presidency with [[George Town, Penang|George Town]] as the capital. However, the presidency was found to be too costly to administer. Hence, the HEIC decided to reduce the status of the Straits Settlements from a presidency to a residency of the Presidency of Bengal, which was under the governor-general of India based in Calcutta.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> As a residency, all administrative decisions and legislations concerning the Straits Settlements were made in Calcutta, and the governor of the Straits Settlements became a mere resident without executive and legislative powers. Overall, this arrangement proved to be ineffective. Without proper representation in Calcutta and due to the distance between the Straits Settlements and Calcutta, the Indian government found it difficult to advance their interests in the Straits such as by cultivating better ties with the Malay states.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nNonetheless, the Straits Settlements remained in the Presidency of Bengal for more than three decades. During this period, the Straits Settlements underwent a number of administrative changes. In 1832, Singapore replaced George Town as the capital of the Straits Settlements. In 1851, direct control over the Straits Settlements was transferred to the Governor-General of India in Calcutta. Under the administration of the East India Company, the Settlements were used as [[penal settlements]] for Indian civilian and military prisoners,<ref>Anderson, C (2007) ''The Indian Uprising of 1857\u20138: prisons, prisoners, and rebellion'', Anthem Press.

The [[Chittagong Division|Chittagong]], [[Dhaka Division|Dhaka]] and [[Rajshahi Division|Rajshahi]] divisions, the [[Malda District]] and the States of [[Tripura (princely state)|Hill Tripura]], [[Sylhet]] and [[Comilla]] were transferred from Bengal to a new province, [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]]; the five Hindi-speaking states of [[Chota Nagpur States|Chota Nagpur]], namely [[Changbhakar State|Changbhakar]], [[Koriya State|Korea]], [[Surguja State|Surguja]], [[Udaipur State, Chhattisgarh|Udaipur]] and [[Jashpur State]], were transferred from Bengal to the Central Provinces; and [[Sambalpur State]] and the five Oriya states of [[Bamra State|Bamra]], [[Rairakhol State|Rairakhol]], [[Sonepur State|Sonepur]], [[Patna State|Patna]] and [[Kalahandi State|Kalahandi]] were transferred from the [[Central Provinces]] to Bengal.\n\nThe province of West Bengal then consisted of the thirty-three districts of [[Burdwan District|Burdwan]], [[Birbhum District|Birbhum]], [[Bankura]], [[Midnapur]], [[Hooghly District|Hughli]], [[Howrah]], [[Twenty-four Parganas]], [[Calcutta]], [[Nadia District|Nadia]], [[Murshidabad]], [[Jessore]], [[Khulna]], [[Patna]], [[Gaya, India|Gaya]], [[Shahabad District|Shahabad]], [[Saran district|Saran]], [[Champaran District|Champaran]], [[Muzaffarpur District|Muzaffarpur]], [[Darbhanga]], [[Monghyr]], [[Bhagalpur]], [[Purnea]], [[Santhal Parganas]], [[Cuttack]], [[Balasore]], [[Angul]] and [[Kandhmal]], [[Puri]], [[Sambalpur]], [[Singhbhum]], [[Hazaribagh]], [[Ranchi]], [[Palamau]], and [[Manbhum]]. The [[princely states]] of [[Sikkim]] and the [[tributary state]]s of [[Odisha]] and [[Chhota Nagpur States|Chhota Nagpur]] were not part of Bengal, but British relations with them were managed by its government.\n\nThe [[Indian Councils Act 1909]] expanded the legislative councils of Bengal and Eastern Bengal and Assam provinces to include up to 50 nominated and elected members, in addition to three ''ex officio'' members from the executive council.<ref>Ilbert, Sir Courtenay Peregrine (1907). \"Appendix II: Constitution of the Legislative Councils under the Regulations of November 1909\", in ''The Government of India''. Clarendon Press. pp. 431.</ref>\n\nBengal's legislative council included 22 nominated members, of which not more than 17 could be officials, and two nominated experts. Of the 26 elected members, one was elected by the [[Corporation of Calcutta]], six by municipalities, six by district boards, one by the [[University of Calcutta]], five by landholders, four by Muslims, two by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce, and one by the Calcutta Trades Association. Eastern Bengal and Assam's legislative council included 22 nominated members, of which not more than 17 be officials and one representing Indian commerce, and two nominated experts. Of the 18 elected members, three were elected by municipalities, five by district and local boards, two by landowners, four by Muslims, two by the tea interest, one by the jute interest, and one by the Commissioners of the [[Port of Chittagong]].<ref>Ilbert, Sir Courtenay Peregrine (1907). \"Appendix II: Constitution of the Legislative Councils under the Regulations of November 1909\", in ''The Government of India''. Clarendon Press. pp. 432\u20135.</ref>\n\nThe partition of Bengal proved highly controversial, as it resulted in a largely Hindu West Bengal and a largely Muslim East. Serious popular agitation followed the step, partly on the grounds that this was part of a cynical policy of divide and rule, and partly that the Bengali population, the centre of whose interests and prosperity was Calcutta, would now be divided under two governments, instead of being concentrated and numerically dominant under the one, while the bulk would be in the new division. In 1906\u20131909 the unrest developed to a considerable extent, requiring special attention from the Indian and Home governments, and this led to the decision being reversed in 1911.\n\n===Reorganisation of Bengal, 1912===\nAt the [[Delhi Durbar]] on 12 December 1911, King George V announced the transfer of the seat of the Government of India from Calcutta to Delhi, the reunification of the five predominantly Bengali-speaking divisions into a Presidency (or province) of Bengal under a Governor, the creation of a new province of [[Bihar and Orissa Province|Bihar and Orissa]] under a lieutenant-governor, and that [[Assam Province]] would be reconstituted under a chief commissioner. On 21 March 1912 [[Thomas Gibson-Carmichael, 1st Baron Carmichael|Thomas Gibson-Carmichael]] was appointed Governor of Bengal; prior to that date the Governor-General of India had also served as the governor of Bengal Presidency. On 22 March the provinces of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa and Assam were constituted.<ref>Ilbert, Sir Courtenay Peregrine (1922). ''The Government of India'', Third Edition, revised and updated.

Bengal remained in its 1912 boundaries until Independence in 1947, when it was again partitioned between the dominions of India and Pakistan.\n\n===1947 Partition of Bengal===\nThe British government considered the possibility of an [[United Bengal|independent, undivided Bengal]]. The partition was opposed by the last Governor of Bengal Sir [[Frederick Burrows]].<ref>''The Transfer of Power in India'' By [[V.P.

It was the only province that would be allowed to remain independent should it  choose to do so. On May 23, the British Cabinet meeting also hoped that Bengal would remain united. British Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] informed the [[US Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] on 2 June 1947 that there was a\"distinct possibility Bengal might decide against partition and against joining either Hindustan or Pakistan\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Shoaib Daniyal |url=https://scroll.in/article/907754/why-did-british-prime-minister-attlee-think-bengal-was-going-to-be-an-independent-country-in-1947 |title=Why did British prime minister Attlee think Bengal was going to be an independent country in 1947? |publisher=Scroll.in |date=2019-01-06 |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> On 6 June 1947, the [[Sylhet referendum]] gave a mandate for [[Sylhet Division]] to be re-united into Bengal. However, Hindu nationalist leaders in West Bengal and conservative East Bengali Muslim leaders were against the prospect.\n\nOn 20 June 1947, the Bengal Legislative Assembly met to vote on partition plans. At the preliminary joint session, the assembly decided by 120 votes to 90 that it should remain united if it joined the new Constituent Assembly of Pakistan. Later, a separate meeting of legislators from West Bengal decided by 58 votes to 21 that the province should be partitioned and that West Bengal should join the existing Constituent Assembly of India. In another separate meeting of legislators from East Bengal, it was decided by 106 votes to 35 that the province should not be partitioned and 107 votes to 34 that East Bengal should join Pakistan in the event of partition.<ref>Mukherjee, Soumyendra Nath (1987).

The governor of Bengal was concurrently the governor-general of India for many years. The East India Company maintained control with its private armies and administrative machinery. Nevertheless, the East India Company was a quasi-official entity, having received a [[Royal Charter]] from [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in 1600. The [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] caused the British government to assume direct control of India's administration under the [[Government of India Act, 1858]]. The head of state became the [[British monarch]], who was also given the title of [[Emperor of India]]/[[Empress of India]]. The monarch was represented through a viceroy. The [[Viceroy of India]] was based in the Bengal Presidency until 1911. The [[Secretary of State for India]] was also an important official. The Bengal Civil Service managed the provincial government. Modern scholars decry the colonial system as bureaucratic authoritarianism.<ref name=\"JalalJalal1995\">{{cite book|author1=Associate Professor History Ayesha Jalal|author2=Ayesha Jalal|title=Democracy and Authoritarianism in South Asia: A Comparative and Historical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mHPok4epvlIC|date=6 April 1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-47862-5|page=19}}</ref>\n\n===Executive councils===\nEstablished by [[Charter Act of 1833]], the [[Council of India|Governor-General in Council]] was subordinate to the Court of Directors of the East India Company and the British Crown. The Governor-General in Council in Fort William enacted legislation, such as the prohibition of Persian as an official language under Act no. XXIX of 1837 passed by the President of the Council of India in Council on 20 November 1837.\n\n===Judiciary===\n[[File:Calcutta High Court 1860.jpg|thumb|Calcutta High Court, 1860s]]\nThe [[Calcutta High Court]] was set up in 1862. The building was designed on the model of [[Ypres Cloth Hall]] in Belgium. The [[Dhaka High Court|Dacca High Court]] building was built during the early 20th century, with elements of a Roman [[Pantheon (Rome)|pantheon]]. District courts were established in all district headquarters of the Bengal Presidency. At the district level, tax collectors and revenue officers acted with the power of [[magistrates]]. In 1814, the East India Company pressed the Bengal Government to consider the [[Madras Presidency]]'s model of uniting of judicial and executive powers at the district level. Ultimately Lord Hastings empowered the Governor General-in-Council by Regulation IV of 1821 to authorize the Collectors and Revenue Officers to exercise powers of magistrates. In 1829, magisterial power was given to all Collectors and Revenue Officers. The controversy regarding the lack of [[separation of powers]] continued until 1921. During the period from 1853 to 1921, as many as four reports were prepared on the issue of separation of the judiciary from the executive. The first was in 1893, the second in 1900, the third in 1908 and the fourth in 1913. The Islington Commission was formed by the Secretary of State for India in 1912 to enquire into the problems of judicial administration in India. In its report submitted on August 14, 1915; the Commission opined that legislation would be necessary to effect separation of executive and judicial functions of the officers. Despite these reports, the structure as laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure continued until 1921. On April 5, 1921 the Bengal Legislative Council adopted the following resolution: \"This Council recommends to the Government that early steps be taken for the separation of the judiciary from the executive functions in the administration of this Presidency.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Separation_of_the_Judiciary |title=Separation of the Judiciary - Banglapedia |publisher=En.banglapedia.org |date= |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\n===Bengal Legislative Council (1862-1947)===\n{{Main|Bengal Legislative Council}}\n{{See also|Legislative Council of Eastern Bengal and Assam}}\n[[File:The Town Hall, Calcutta in the 1860s.jpg|thumb|The Legislative Council met in Calcutta Town Hall]]\nThe British government began to appoint legislative councils under the [[Indian Councils Act 1861]]. The Bengal Legislative Council was established in 1862. It was one of the largest and most important legislative councils in British India. Over the years, the council's powers were gradually expanded from an advisory role to debating government policies and enacting legislation. Under the [[Government of India Act, 1935]], the council became the [[upper chamber]] of the Bengali legislature.\n\n===Dyarchy (1920\u201337)===\nBritish India's [[Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms]] of 1919, enacted in 1921, expanded the Bengal Legislative Council to 140 members to include more elected Indian members. The reforms also introduced the principle of [[dyarchy]], whereby certain responsibilities such as agriculture, health, education, and local government, were transferred to elected ministers. However, the important portfolios like finance, police and irrigation were reserved with members of the Governor's Executive Council. Some of the prominent ministers were [[Surendranath Banerjee]] (Local Self-government and Public Health 1921-1923), Sir Provash Chunder Mitter (Education 1921\u20131924, Local Self-government, Public Health, Agriculture and Public Works 1927\u20131928), Nawab Saiyid Nawab Ali Chaudhuri (Agriculture and Public Works) and [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]] (Education 1924). [[Bhupendra Nath Bose]] and [[Abdur Rahim (judge)|Sir Abdur Rahim]] were Executive Members in the Governor's Council.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Working Of Dyarchy In India 1919 1928|publisher=D.B.Taraporevala Sons And Company.|url=https://archive.org/details/workingofdyarchy029425mbp}}</ref>\n\n===Bengal Legislative Assembly (1935-1947)===      \n{{Main|Bengal Legislative Assembly}}\n[[File:Bengal PMs.png|thumb|Statesmen who served as the [[Prime Minister of Bengal]]]]\nThe Government of India Act, 1935 established the Bengal Legislative Assembly as the lower chamber of the Bengali legislature. It was a 250-seat assembly where most members were elected by either the General Electorate or the Muslim Electorate (under the [[Communal Award]]). Other members were nominated. The separate electorate dividing Muslims from the general electorate was deeply controversial. The [[Prime Minister of Bengal]] was a member of the assembly.\n\nIn the [[1937 Indian provincial elections|1937 election]], the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] emerged as the single largest party but short of an absolute majority. The second-largest party was the [[Bengal Provincial Muslim League]] (BPML), followed in third place by the [[Krishak Praja Party]]. The BPML, Krishak Praja Party and independent legislators formed a coalition government.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jalal |first=Ayesha |authorlink=Ayesha Jalal |date=1994 |title=The Sole Spokesman: Jinnah, the Muslim League and the Demand for Pakistan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D63KMRN1SJ8C&pg=PA26 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=26\u201327 |isbn=978-0-521-45850-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Sanaullah|first1=Muhammad|title=A.K.

Fazlul Huq]], a founder of the BPML who later broke away to form the Krishak Praja Party, was elected as parliamentary leader and prime minister. Huq pursued a policy of [[Hindu-Muslim unity]]. His cabinet included leading Hindu and Muslim figures, including [[Nalini Ranjan Sarkar]] (finance), Bijoy Prasad Singha Roy (revenue), Maharaja [[Srish Chandra Nandy]] (communications and public works), Prasanna Deb Raikut (forest and excise), Mukunda Behari Mallick (cooperative credit and rural indebtedness), Sir Khwaja Nazimuddin (home), Nawab [[Khwaja Habibullah]] (agriculture and industry), Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy (commerce and labour), [[Musharraf Hussain (nawab)|Nawab Musharraf Hussain]] (judicial and legislative affairs), and [[Syed Nausher Ali]] (public health and local self-government).<ref name=\"en.banglapedia.org\">http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Huq,_AK_Fazlul</ref> Huq promoted financial and [[land reform]]s with the Bengal Agricultural Debtors' Act (1938), The Money Lenders' Act (1938), and the Bengal Tenancy (Amendment) Act (1938). He introduced the Primary Education Bill to make primary education free and compulsory. He established schools such as the [[Lady Brabourne College]]. In 1941, Prime Minister Huq joined the [[Viceroy of India|Viceroy's]] Defence Council in support of [[Allied Powers|Allied]] war efforts. In a letter to Governor [[John Herbert (Conservative politician)|John Herbert]], Huq called for the resurrection of a Bengal Army. He wrote \"I want you to consent to the formation of a Bengali Army of a hundred thousand young Bengalis consisting of Hindu and Muslim youths on a fifty-fifty basis. There is an insistent demand for such a step being taken at once, and the people of Bengal will not be satisfied with any excuses. It is a national demand which must be immediately conceded\".<ref name=\"thedailystar1\">{{cite web|author=Syed Ashraf Ali |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-60600 |title=Sher-e-Bangla: A natural leader |publisher=The Daily Star |date= |accessdate=2017-08-10}}</ref> Huq supported the adoption of the [[Lahore Resolution]] in 1940. He envisaged Bengal as one of the \"independent states\" outlined by the resolution.\n\nThe first Huq cabinet dissolved after the BPML withdrew from his government. Huq then formed a second coalition with the [[Hindu Mahasabha]] led by [[Syama Prasad Mukherjee]]. This cabinet was known as the Shyama-Huq Coalition.<ref name=\"en.banglapedia.org\"/> The cabinet included Nawab Bahabur Khwaja Habibullah, Khan Bahadur Abdul Karim, Khan Bahadur Hashem Ali Khan, Shamsuddin Ahmed, Syama Prasad Mukherjee, Santosh Kumar Bose and Upendranath Barman. Huq's government fell in 1943 and a BPML government under [[Khawaja Nazimuddin|Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin]] as [[Prime Minister of Bengal|Prime Minister]] was formed. Nazimuddin's tenure coincided with the Bengal famine of 1943. His government was replaced by [[Governor's rule]]. After the end of World War II, [[1946 Indian provincial elections|elections were held in 1946]] in which the BPML won an overwhelming majority of 113 seats in the 250-seat assembly. A government under [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]] was formed.<ref>{{cite book|title=Nalanda Year-book & Who's who in India|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zja2AAAAIAAJ|year=1946}}</ref> Prime Minister Suhrawardy continued with the policy of power-sharing between Hindus and Muslims. He also advocated a plan for a Bengali sovereign state with a [[Multiconfessionalism|multiconfessionalist]] political system. The breakdown of Hindu-Muslim unity across India eventually upended Bengali power-sharing. Religious violence, including the [[Noakhali riots]] and [[Direct Action Day]] riots, contributed to the polarization. When the Bengal Assembly met to vote on Partition, most West Bengali legislators held a separate meeting and resolved to partition the province and join the Indian union. Most East Bengali legislators favored an undivided Bengal.\n\nThe Bengal Assembly was divided into the [[West Bengal Legislative Assembly]] and [[East Bengal Legislative Assembly]] during the Partition of British India.\n\n===Civil liberties===\n[[English common law]] was applied to Bengal. Local legislation was enacted by the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly. [[Case law]] was also an important source of law. Many laws enacted in British Bengal are still in use today, including the [[Indian Penal Code]]. In 1919, the [[Rowlatt Act]] extended wartime powers under the Defence of India Act 1915, including arbitrary arrests and trial without juries. Press freedom was muzzled by the Indian Press Act 1910. The Seditious Meetings Act 1908 curtailed freedom of assembly. Regulation III of 1818 was also considered draconian. King [[George V]] granted a royal amnesty to free political prisoners. Some draconian laws were repealed, including the Rowlatt Act.<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/gentlemanly-terrorists/reforms-of-1919-montaguchelmsford-the-rowlatt-act-jails-commission-and-the-royal-amnesty/D97CA2DF6D0AEBDD9AD2066DB1504C04/core-reader</ref> Despite being a common law jurisdiction, British India did not enjoy the same level of protection for civil liberties as in the United Kingdom. It was only after independence in 1947 and the adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948, that human rights were clearly enshrined in law.\n\n===Princely states===\n[[File:Thirteenth Dalai Lama Thubten Gyatso.jpg|thumb|upright|The 13th [[Dalai Lama]] in Calcutta in 1910]]\n[[Princely states]] were autonomous principalities under the [[suzerainty]] of the British Crown in India. Initially, the Bengal Presidency managed the British government's relations with most princely states in the northern subcontinent, extending from [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] in the north to [[Manipur (princely state)|Manipur]] in the northeast. An [[Agencies of British India|Agency]] was often formed to be the liaison between the government and the princely states. The largest of these agencies under Bengal once included the [[Rajputana Agency]]. Other agencies covered the [[Chota Nagpur Tributary States]] and the [[Orissa Tributary States]]. Agents were also appointed to deal with tribal chiefs, such as the three tribal kings in the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]]. At the time of the partition of India in 1947, the jurisdiction of the [[Bengal States Agency]] included [[Cooch Behar State]] and [[Hill Tipperah]].\n\n===Himalayan kingdoms===\nBengal was strategically important for the Himalayan regions of Nepal, [[Tibet]], Bhutan and Sikkim. The [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] between the East India Company and the [[Kingdom of Nepal]] was concluded with the [[Treaty of Sugauli]], which ended [[Gorkha Kingdom|Gorkha]] territorial expansion. The [[Treaty of Titalia]] was signed in 1817 between the HEIC and the [[Kingdom of Sikkim]] to establish British hegemony over Sikkim. The [[Bhutan War]] in the 1860s saw the [[Kingdom of Bhutan]] lose control of the [[Bengal Duars]] to the British. The [[British Expedition to Tibet]] took place between 1903 and 1904 which resulted in the [[Treaty of Lhasa]] and an acknowledgment of [[Qing China]]'s supremacy over Tibet.\n\n===Foreign relations===\nThe [[United States of America]] began sending envoys to Fort William in the 18th-century. President [[George Washington]] nominated Benjamin Joy as the first Consul to Fort William on 19 November 1792. The nomination was supported by the erstwhile Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]] and approved by the U. S. Senate on 21 November 1792. Benjamin Joy reached Calcutta in 1794. The HEIC did not recognize Joy as an official consul but allowed him to be a Commercial Agent.<ref>https://in.usembassy.gov/embassy-consulates/kolkata/</ref> The American [[Consulate General]] was established during formal British rule. A consular agency for Chittagong was created in the 1860s. Many other countries also set up consulates in Calcutta.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:A statue at victoria memorial. kolkata.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of [[Lord William Bentinck]] in Calcutta Victoria Memorial. As Governor-General, Bentinck made English the medium of instruction in schools and phased out Persian.]]\n[[File:Ram Mohan Roy statue.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Raja Ram Mohun Roy]], a native reformer and educationist]]\nBritish rule saw the establishment of [[liberal arts colleges]] in many districts of Bengal. There were only two full-fledged universities in Bengal during British rule, including the University of Calcutta and the University of Dacca. Both universities were represented in the Bengal Legislative Assembly under the Government of India Act, 1935.\n\nPrimary education was mandatory under the Compulsory Education Acts.<ref name=\"banglapedia1\">{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Education |title=Education - Banglapedia |publisher=En.banglapedia.org |date= |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> Despite significant advances and the emergence of a large educated middle class, most of the population did not have access to a proper education. During 1946-47, there were 5,298 high schools with an enrolment of 21,99,000 pupils whereas the corresponding figures for 1916-17 were 1,507 and 57,200. The demand for secondary education increased with the growth of political consciousness amongst the masses. The result was the establishment of schools in villages and towns where backward communities could enroll. Female education too received a good deal of attention during the period. Consequently, between 1921\u201322 and 1946\u201347, the number of educational institutions for girls nearly doubled.<ref name=\"banglapedia1\"/> Some of the leading schools included the [[Oriental Seminary]] in Calcutta, the [[St. Gregory's High School]] in Dacca, the [[Rajshahi Collegiate School]] in Rajshahi and the [[Chittagong Collegiate School]] in Chittagong. European missionaries, Hindu philanthropists and Muslim aristocrats were influential promoters of education. Ethnic minorities maintained their own institutions, such as the Armenian [[Pogose School]].\n\nEach district of Bengal had a [[List of Zilla Schools of Bangladesh|district school]], which were the leading secondary institutions. Due to Calcutta being the colonial capital, the city had a large concentration of educational institutions. It was followed by Dacca, which served as a provincial capital between 1905 and 1912. Libraries were established in each district of Bengal by the colonial government and the [[Zamindar]]s. In 1854, four major public libraries were opened, including the Bogra Woodburn Library, the Rangpur Public Library, the Jessore Institute Public Library and the Barisal Public Library. [[Northbrook Hall]] was established in 1882 in honor of Governor-General [[Lord Northbrook]]. Other libraries built include the Victoria Public Library, Natore (1901), the Sirajganj Public Library (1882), the [[Rajshahi Public Library]] (1884), the Comilla Birchandra Library (1885), the Shah Makhdum Institute Public Library, Rajshahi (1891), the Noakhali Town Hall Public Library (1896), the Prize Memorial Library, Sylhet (1897), the Chittagong Municipality Public Library (1904) and the Varendra Research Library (1910).

However, Bengal received little attention for industrialization due to the entrenched peasant-zamindar relationship under the Permanent Settlement.<ref>https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/30f0/3c45a7353c581c40ac39dbe4ee88621304a2.pdf</ref> The [[Zamindars of Bengal]] built mansions, lodges, modern bungalows, townhouses, and palaces on their estates.

The earliest organized anti-colonial groups appeared in Bengal. The region produced many of the subcontinent's political leaders during the early 20th century. Political parties and rebel groups were formed across the region.\n\n===Architecture===\nCivic architecture began following European styles after the advent of the East India Company's authority. The [[Indo-Saracenic]] style, merging [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Indo-Islamic architecture]], was started by British architects in the late 19th-century. While cities such as Calcutta and Dacca featured more civic architecture, [[country houses]] were built in many towns and villages across Bengal. [[Art deco]] influences began in the 1930s. Wealthy Bengali families (especially [[zamindar]] estates) employed European firms to design houses and palaces. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Architecture in British Bengal\" style=\"font-size:88%; line-height:130%; border-bottom:1px #aaa solid;\" heights=\"180\">\nThe Hooghly Bridge (BOND 0034).jpeg|[[Howrah Bridge]] in 1945\nVictoria Memorial, Calcutta - LIFE.jpg|[[Victoria Memorial, Kolkata]]\nWriters Building.jpg|[[Writer's Building]]\nRuplal House old.jpg|[[Ruplal House]]\nCompleted Bridge.

Historians have argued that the British used a policy of [[divide and rule]] among Hindus and Muslims. This meant favoring Hindus over Muslims and vice versa in certain sectors. For example, after the [[Permanent Settlement]], Hindu merchants such as the [[Tagore family]] were awarded large land grants that previously belonged to the Mughal aristocracy. In Calcutta, where Hindus formed a majority, wealthy Muslims were often given favors over Hindus. One aspect that benefitted the Hindu community was increased literacy rates. Many Muslims, however, remained alienated from English education after the abolition of Persian. Bengali society continued to experience religious nationalism which led to the partition of Bengal in 1947.\n\nBritish Bengali cities included a cosmopolitan population, including Armenians and Jews. [[Anglo-Indians]] formed a prominent part of the urban population. Several [[Gentlemen's clubs]] were established, including the [[Bengal Club]], [[Calcutta Club]], [[Dhaka Club|Dacca Club]], [[Chittagong Club]], [[Tollygunge Club]] and [[Saturday Club (Kolkata)|Saturday Club]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of governors of Bengal]]\n* [[Advocate-General of Bengal]]\n\n== References == \n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Works cited == \n{{EB1911|wstitle=Bengal}}\n* [[Christopher Bayly|C.

At the height of its territorial jurisdiction, it covered large parts of what is now [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Bengal proper covered the ethno-linguistic region of [[Bengal]] (present-day [[Bangladesh]] and the [[West Bengal|Indian state of West Bengal]]). [[Calcutta]], the city which grew around Fort William, was the capital of the Bengal Presidency. For many years, the [[Governor of Bengal]] was concurrently the [[Viceroy of India]] and Calcutta was the de facto [[capital of India]] until the early 20th-century.\n\nThe Bengal Presidency emerged from trading posts established in [[Mughal Bengal]] during the reign of Emperor Jahangir in 1612. The Honourable East India Company (HEIC), a British monopoly with a Royal Charter, competed with other European companies to gain influence in Bengal. After the decisive overthrow of the Nawab of Bengal in 1757 and the [[Battle of Buxar]] in 1765, the HEIC expanded its control over much of the Indian subcontinent. This marked the beginning of [[Company rule in India]], when the HEIC emerged as the most powerful military force in the subcontinent. The British Parliament gradually withdrew the monopoly of the HEIC. By the 1850s, the HEIC struggled with finances.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">William Dalrymple (10 September 2019).

Bloomsbury Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-4088-6440-1}}.</ref> After the [[Indian Mutiny]] of 1857, the British government assumed direct administration of India. The Bengal Presidency was re-organized. In the early 20th-century, Bengal emerged as a hotbed of the [[Indian independence movement]], as well as the epicenter of the [[Bengali Renaissance]].\n\nBengal was the economic, cultural and educational hub of the [[British Raj]]. During the period of [[proto-industrialization]], Bengal significantly contributed directly to the [[Industrial revolution]] in Britain, although it was soon overtaken by the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] ruled by [[Tipu Sultan]] as [[South Asia]]'s dominant economic power.<ref name=\"Parthasarathi\">{{Citation |title=Why Europe Grew Rich and Asia Did Not: Global Economic Divergence, 1600\u20131850 |given=Prasannan |surname=Parthasarathi |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-139-49889-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_YEcvo-jqcC}}</ref> When Bengal was reorganized, [[Penang]], [[Singapore]] and [[Malacca]] were separated into the [[Straits Settlements]] in 1867.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/bd541c73-58ef-4bb1-9de7-173f00913286 |title=The Straits Settlements becomes a residency - Singapore History |publisher=Eresources.nlb.gov.sg |date= |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> [[British Burma]] became a province of India and a later a [[Crown Colony]] in itself. Western areas, including the [[Ceded and Conquered Provinces]] and [[Punjab Province (British India)|The Punjab]], were further reorganized. Northeastern areas became [[Colonial Assam]]. The [[Partition of British India]] in 1947 resulted in [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Bengal's division]] on religious grounds.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n[[File:Jahangir of India.jpg|thumb|Jahangir first permitted the East India Company (HEIC) to trade in Bengal]]\nIn 1599, a [[Royal Charter]] was granted by [[Queen Elizabeth I]] to allow the creation of a trading company in [[London]] for the purposes of trade with the East Indies. The governance of the company was placed in the hands of a governor and a 24-member Court of Directors. The corporation became known as the Honourable East India Company (HEIC). It rose to account for half of the world's trade. The company was given a monopoly for British trade in the Indian ocean.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>  \n \nIn 1608, [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Jahangir]] allowed the English East India Company to establish a small trading post on the west coast of India. It was followed in 1611 by a [[factory (trading post)|factory]] on the [[Coromandel Coast]] in South India, and in 1612 the company joined other already established European trading companies to trade in the wealthy [[Bengal Subah]] in the east.<ref>{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. II|1908|pp=452\u2013472}}</ref> However, the power of the Mughal Empire declined from 1707, as the Nawab of Bengal in [[Murshidabad]] became financially independent with the help of bankers such as the [[Jagat Seth]]. The Nawabs began entering into treaties with numerous European companies, including the [[French East India Company]], the [[Dutch East India Company]], and the [[Danish East India Company]]. The Mughal court in [[Delhi]] was weakened by [[Nader Shah]]'s invasion from Persia (1739) and [[Ahmed Shah Durrani]]'s invasion from Afghanistan (1761). The East India Company's victories at the [[Battle of Plassey]] (against the last independent Nawab of Bengal in 1757) and the [[Battle of Buxar]] (against the Nawabs of Bengal and [[Nawab of Oudh|Oudh]] in 1764) led to the abolition of local rule (Nizamat) in Bengal in 1793. The Company gradually began to formally expand its territories across India and [[Southeast Asia]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. II|1908|pp=473\u2013487}}</ref> By the mid-19th century, the East India Company had become the paramount political and military power in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Its territory was held in [[Trust law|trust]] for the [[The Crown|British Crown]].<ref name=igi-ii-pp488-514>{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. II|1908|pp=488\u2013514}}</ref> The Company also issued coins in the name of the nominal Mughal Emperor (who was exiled in 1857).\n\n===Administrative changes and the Permanent Settlement===\n{{see also|Cornwallis in India}}\n[[File:Clive.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Clive]] at the Battle of Plassey in 1757, which marked the defeat of the last independent Nawab of Bengal [[Siraj-ud-Daulah]]]]\n[[File:The trail of Warren Hastings, 1788.jpg|thumb|The [[Impeachment of Warren Hastings]]]] \nUnder [[Warren Hastings]], the consolidation of British imperial rule over Bengal was solidified, with the  conversion of a trade area into an occupied territory under a military-civil government, while the formation of a regularised system of legislation was brought in under [[John Shore, 1st Baron Teignmouth|John Shore]]. Acting through [[Lord Cornwallis]], then Governor-General, he ascertained and defined the rights of the landholders over the soil. These landholders under the previous system had started, for the most part, as collectors of the revenues, and gradually acquired certain prescriptive rights as quasi-proprietors of the estates entrusted to them by the government. In 1793 Lord Cornwallis declared their rights perpetual, and gave over the land of Bengal to the previous quasi-proprietors or ''zamindars'', on condition of the payment of a fixed land tax. This piece of legislation is known as the [[Permanent Settlement]] of the Land Revenue. It was designed to \"introduce\" ideas of property rights to India, and stimulate a market in land. The former aim misunderstood the nature of landholding in India, and the latter was an abject failure.\n\nThe ''Cornwallis Code'', while defining the rights of the proprietors, failed to give adequate recognition to the rights of the under-tenants and the cultivators. This remained a serious problem for the duration of British Rule, as throughout the Bengal Presidency ''ryots'' (peasants) found themselves oppressed by rack-renting landlords, who knew that every rupee they could squeeze from their tenants over and above the fixed revenue demanded from the Government represented pure profit. Furthermore, the Permanent Settlement took no account of inflation, meaning that the value of the revenue to Government declined year by year, whilst the heavy burden on the peasantry grew no less. This was compounded in the early 19th century by compulsory schemes for the cultivation of [[opium]] and [[indigo]], the former by the state, and the latter by British planters. Peasants were forced to grow a certain area of these crops, which were then purchased at below market rates for export. This added greatly to rural poverty.\n\nSo unsuccessful was the Permanent Settlement that it was not introduced in the North-Western Provinces (taken from the Marathas during the campaigns of [[Lord Lake]] and [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]]) after 1831, in Punjab after its conquest in 1849, or in [[Oudh]] which was annexed in 1856. These regions were nominally part of the Bengal Presidency, but remained administratively distinct. The area of the Presidency under direct administration was sometimes referred to as Lower Bengal to distinguish it from the Presidency as a whole. Officially Punjab, Agra and Allahabad had Lieutenant-Governors subject to the authority of the Governor of Bengal in Calcutta, but in practice they were more or less independent. The only all-Presidency institutions which remained were the Bengal Army and the Civil Service. The Bengal Army was finally amalgamated into the new [[British-Indian Army]] in 1904\u20135, after a lengthy struggle over its reform between [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], the Commander-in-Chief, and [[Lord Curzon]], the Viceroy.\n\n===Straits Settlements===\nIn 1830, the British Straits Settlements on the coast of the [[Malacca Straits]] was made a residency of the Presidency of Bengal in Calcutta. The area included the erstwhile [[Prince of Wales Island (Malaysia)|Prince of Wales Island]] and [[Province Wellesley]], as well as the ports of [[Malacca]] and [[Singapore]]. Previously, the Straits Settlements (formed by the HEIC in 1826) was administered as a separate presidency with [[George Town, Penang|George Town]] as the capital. However, the presidency was found to be too costly to administer. Hence, the HEIC decided to reduce the status of the Straits Settlements from a presidency to a residency of the Presidency of Bengal, which was under the governor-general of India based in Calcutta.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> As a residency, all administrative decisions and legislations concerning the Straits Settlements were made in Calcutta, and the governor of the Straits Settlements became a mere resident without executive and legislative powers. Overall, this arrangement proved to be ineffective. Without proper representation in Calcutta and due to the distance between the Straits Settlements and Calcutta, the Indian government found it difficult to advance their interests in the Straits such as by cultivating better ties with the Malay states.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nNonetheless, the Straits Settlements remained in the Presidency of Bengal for more than three decades. During this period, the Straits Settlements underwent a number of administrative changes. In 1832, Singapore replaced George Town as the capital of the Straits Settlements. In 1851, direct control over the Straits Settlements was transferred to the Governor-General of India in Calcutta. Under the administration of the East India Company, the Settlements were used as [[penal settlements]] for Indian civilian and military prisoners,<ref>Anderson, C (2007) ''The Indian Uprising of 1857\u20138: prisons, prisoners, and rebellion'', Anthem Press.

The [[Chittagong Division|Chittagong]], [[Dhaka Division|Dhaka]] and [[Rajshahi Division|Rajshahi]] divisions, the [[Malda District]] and the States of [[Tripura (princely state)|Hill Tripura]], [[Sylhet]] and [[Comilla]] were transferred from Bengal to a new province, [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]]; the five Hindi-speaking states of [[Chota Nagpur States|Chota Nagpur]], namely [[Changbhakar State|Changbhakar]], [[Koriya State|Korea]], [[Surguja State|Surguja]], [[Udaipur State, Chhattisgarh|Udaipur]] and [[Jashpur State]], were transferred from Bengal to the Central Provinces; and [[Sambalpur State]] and the five Oriya states of [[Bamra State|Bamra]], [[Rairakhol State|Rairakhol]], [[Sonepur State|Sonepur]], [[Patna State|Patna]] and [[Kalahandi State|Kalahandi]] were transferred from the [[Central Provinces]] to Bengal.\n\nThe province of West Bengal then consisted of the thirty-three districts of [[Burdwan District|Burdwan]], [[Birbhum District|Birbhum]], [[Bankura]], [[Midnapur]], [[Hooghly District|Hughli]], [[Howrah]], [[Twenty-four Parganas]], [[Calcutta]], [[Nadia District|Nadia]], [[Murshidabad]], [[Jessore]], [[Khulna]], [[Patna]], [[Gaya, India|Gaya]], [[Shahabad District|Shahabad]], [[Saran district|Saran]], [[Champaran District|Champaran]], [[Muzaffarpur District|Muzaffarpur]], [[Darbhanga]], [[Monghyr]], [[Bhagalpur]], [[Purnea]], [[Santhal Parganas]], [[Cuttack]], [[Balasore]], [[Angul]] and [[Kandhmal]], [[Puri]], [[Sambalpur]], [[Singhbhum]], [[Hazaribagh]], [[Ranchi]], [[Palamau]], and [[Manbhum]]. The [[princely states]] of [[Sikkim]] and the [[tributary state]]s of [[Odisha]] and [[Chhota Nagpur States|Chhota Nagpur]] were not part of Bengal, but British relations with them were managed by its government.\n\nThe [[Indian Councils Act 1909]] expanded the legislative councils of Bengal and Eastern Bengal and Assam provinces to include up to 50 nominated and elected members, in addition to three ''ex officio'' members from the executive council.<ref>Ilbert, Sir Courtenay Peregrine (1907). \"Appendix II: Constitution of the Legislative Councils under the Regulations of November 1909\", in ''The Government of India''. Clarendon Press. pp. 431.</ref>\n\nBengal's legislative council included 22 nominated members, of which not more than 17 could be officials, and two nominated experts. Of the 26 elected members, one was elected by the [[Corporation of Calcutta]], six by municipalities, six by district boards, one by the [[University of Calcutta]], five by landholders, four by Muslims, two by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce, and one by the Calcutta Trades Association. Eastern Bengal and Assam's legislative council included 22 nominated members, of which not more than 17 be officials and one representing Indian commerce, and two nominated experts. Of the 18 elected members, three were elected by municipalities, five by district and local boards, two by landowners, four by Muslims, two by the tea interest, one by the jute interest, and one by the Commissioners of the [[Port of Chittagong]].<ref>Ilbert, Sir Courtenay Peregrine (1907). \"Appendix II: Constitution of the Legislative Councils under the Regulations of November 1909\", in ''The Government of India''. Clarendon Press. pp. 432\u20135.</ref>\n\nThe partition of Bengal proved highly controversial, as it resulted in a largely Hindu West Bengal and a largely Muslim East. Serious popular agitation followed the step, partly on the grounds that this was part of a cynical policy of divide and rule, and partly that the Bengali population, the centre of whose interests and prosperity was Calcutta, would now be divided under two governments, instead of being concentrated and numerically dominant under the one, while the bulk would be in the new division. In 1906\u20131909 the unrest developed to a considerable extent, requiring special attention from the Indian and Home governments, and this led to the decision being reversed in 1911.\n\n===Reorganisation of Bengal, 1912===\nAt the [[Delhi Durbar]] on 12 December 1911, King George V announced the transfer of the seat of the Government of India from Calcutta to Delhi, the reunification of the five predominantly Bengali-speaking divisions into a Presidency (or province) of Bengal under a Governor, the creation of a new province of [[Bihar and Orissa Province|Bihar and Orissa]] under a lieutenant-governor, and that [[Assam Province]] would be reconstituted under a chief commissioner. On 21 March 1912 [[Thomas Gibson-Carmichael, 1st Baron Carmichael|Thomas Gibson-Carmichael]] was appointed Governor of Bengal; prior to that date the Governor-General of India had also served as the governor of Bengal Presidency. On 22 March the provinces of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa and Assam were constituted.<ref>Ilbert, Sir Courtenay Peregrine (1922). ''The Government of India'', Third Edition, revised and updated.

Bengal remained in its 1912 boundaries until Independence in 1947, when it was again partitioned between the dominions of India and Pakistan.\n\n===1947 Partition of Bengal===\nThe British government considered the possibility of an [[United Bengal|independent, undivided Bengal]]. The partition was opposed by the last Governor of Bengal Sir [[Frederick Burrows]].<ref>''The Transfer of Power in India'' By [[V.P. Menon]]</ref> On May 8, 1947, Viceroy [[Earl Mountbatten]] cabled the British government with a partition plan that made an exception for Bengal. It was the only province that would be allowed to remain independent should it  choose to do so. On May 23, the British Cabinet meeting also hoped that Bengal would remain united. British Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] informed the [[US Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] on 2 June 1947 that there was a\"distinct possibility Bengal might decide against partition and against joining either Hindustan or Pakistan\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Shoaib Daniyal |url=https://scroll.in/article/907754/why-did-british-prime-minister-attlee-think-bengal-was-going-to-be-an-independent-country-in-1947 |title=Why did British prime minister Attlee think Bengal was going to be an independent country in 1947? |publisher=Scroll.in |date=2019-01-06 |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> On 6 June 1947, the [[Sylhet referendum]] gave a mandate for [[Sylhet Division]] to be re-united into Bengal. However, Hindu nationalist leaders in West Bengal and conservative East Bengali Muslim leaders were against the prospect.\n\nOn 20 June 1947, the Bengal Legislative Assembly met to vote on partition plans. At the preliminary joint session, the assembly decided by 120 votes to 90 that it should remain united if it joined the new Constituent Assembly of Pakistan. Later, a separate meeting of legislators from West Bengal decided by 58 votes to 21 that the province should be partitioned and that West Bengal should join the existing Constituent Assembly of India. In another separate meeting of legislators from East Bengal, it was decided by 106 votes to 35 that the province should not be partitioned and 107 votes to 34 that East Bengal should join Pakistan in the event of partition.<ref>Mukherjee, Soumyendra Nath (1987).

The governor of Bengal was concurrently the governor-general of India for many years. The East India Company maintained control with its private armies and administrative machinery. Nevertheless, the East India Company was a quasi-official entity, having received a [[Royal Charter]] from [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in 1600. The [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] caused the British government to assume direct control of India's administration under the [[Government of India Act, 1858]]. The head of state became the [[British monarch]], who was also given the title of [[Emperor of India]]/[[Empress of India]]. The monarch was represented through a viceroy. The [[Viceroy of India]] was based in the Bengal Presidency until 1911. The [[Secretary of State for India]] was also an important official. The Bengal Civil Service managed the provincial government. Modern scholars decry the colonial system as bureaucratic authoritarianism.<ref name=\"JalalJalal1995\">{{cite book|author1=Associate Professor History Ayesha Jalal|author2=Ayesha Jalal|title=Democracy and Authoritarianism in South Asia: A Comparative and Historical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mHPok4epvlIC|date=6 April 1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-47862-5|page=19}}</ref>\n\n===Executive councils===\nEstablished by [[Charter Act of 1833]], the [[Council of India|Governor-General in Council]] was subordinate to the Court of Directors of the East India Company and the British Crown. The Governor-General in Council in Fort William enacted legislation, such as the prohibition of Persian as an official language under Act no. XXIX of 1837 passed by the President of the Council of India in Council on 20 November 1837.\n\n===Judiciary===\n[[File:Calcutta High Court 1860.jpg|thumb|Calcutta High Court, 1860s]]\nThe [[Calcutta High Court]] was set up in 1862. The building was designed on the model of [[Ypres Cloth Hall]] in Belgium. The [[Dhaka High Court|Dacca High Court]] building was built during the early 20th century, with elements of a Roman [[pantheon]]. District courts were established in all district headquarters of the Bengal Presidency. At the district level, tax collectors and revenue officers acted with the power of [[magistrates]]. In 1814, the East India Company pressed the Bengal Government to consider the [[Madras Presidency]]'s model of uniting of judicial and executive powers at the district level. Ultimately Lord Hastings empowered the Governor General-in-Council by Regulation IV of 1821 to authorize the Collectors and Revenue Officers to exercise powers of magistrates. In 1829, magisterial power was given to all Collectors and Revenue Officers. The controversy regarding the lack of [[separation of powers]] continued until 1921. During the period from 1853 to 1921, as many as four reports were prepared on the issue of separation of the judiciary from the executive. The first was in 1893, the second in 1900, the third in 1908 and the fourth in 1913. The Islington Commission was formed by the Secretary of State for India in 1912 to enquire into the problems of judicial administration in India. In its report submitted on August 14, 1915; the Commission opined that legislation would be necessary to effect separation of executive and judicial functions of the officers. Despite these reports, the structure as laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure continued until 1921. On April 5, 1921 the Bengal Legislative Council adopted the following resolution: \"This Council recommends to the Government that early steps be taken for the separation of the judiciary from the executive functions in the administration of this Presidency.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Separation_of_the_Judiciary |title=Separation of the Judiciary - Banglapedia |publisher=En.banglapedia.org |date= |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\n===Bengal Legislative Council (1862-1947)===\n{{Main|Bengal Legislative Council}}\n{{See also|Legislative Council of Eastern Bengal and Assam}}\n[[File:The Town Hall, Calcutta in the 1860s.jpg|thumb|The Legislative Council met in Calcutta Town Hall]]\nThe British government began to appoint legislative councils under the [[Indian Councils Act 1861]]. The Bengal Legislative Council was established in 1862. It was one of the largest and most important legislative councils in British India. Over the years, the council's powers were gradually expanded from an advisory role to debating government policies and enacting legislation. Under the [[Government of India Act, 1935]], the council became the [[upper chamber]] of the Bengali legislature.\n\n===Dyarchy (1920\u201337)===\nBritish India's [[Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms]] of 1919, enacted in 1921, expanded the Bengal Legislative Council to 140 members to include more elected Indian members. The reforms also introduced the principle of [[dyarchy]], whereby certain responsibilities such as agriculture, health, education, and local government, were transferred to elected ministers. However, the important portfolios like finance, police and irrigation were reserved with members of the Governor's Executive Council. Some of the prominent ministers were [[Surendranath Banerjee]] (Local Self-government and Public Health 1921-1923), Sir Provash Chunder Mitter (Education 1921\u20131924, Local Self-government, Public Health, Agriculture and Public Works 1927\u20131928), Nawab Saiyid Nawab Ali Chaudhuri (Agriculture and Public Works) and [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]] (Education 1924). [[Bhupendra Nath Bose]] and [[Abdur Rahim (judge)|Sir Abdur Rahim]] were Executive Members in the Governor's Council.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Working Of Dyarchy In India 1919 1928|publisher=D.B.Taraporevala Sons And Company.|url=https://archive.org/details/workingofdyarchy029425mbp}}</ref>\n\n===Bengal Legislative Assembly (1935-1947)===      \n{{Main|Bengal Legislative Assembly}}\n[[File:Bengal PMs.png|thumb|Statesmen who served as the [[Prime Minister of Bengal]]]]\nThe Government of India Act, 1935 established the Bengal Legislative Assembly as the lower chamber of the Bengali legislature. It was a 250-seat assembly where most members were elected by either the General Electorate or the Muslim Electorate (under the [[Communal Award]]). Other members were nominated. The separate electorate dividing Muslims from the general electorate was deeply controversial. The [[Prime Minister of Bengal]] was a member of the assembly.\n\nIn the [[1937 Indian provincial elections|1937 election]], the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] emerged as the single largest party but short of an absolute majority. The second-largest party was the [[Bengal Provincial Muslim League]] (BPML), followed in third place by the [[Krishak Praja Party]]. The BPML, Krishak Praja Party and independent legislators formed a coalition government.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jalal |first=Ayesha |authorlink=Ayesha Jalal |date=1994 |title=The Sole Spokesman: Jinnah, the Muslim League and the Demand for Pakistan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D63KMRN1SJ8C&pg=PA26 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=26\u201327 |isbn=978-0-521-45850-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Sanaullah|first1=Muhammad|title=A.K.

Fazlul Huq]], a founder of the BPML who later broke away to form the Krishak Praja Party, was elected as parliamentary leader and prime minister. Huq pursued a policy of [[Hindu-Muslim unity]]. His cabinet included leading Hindu and Muslim figures, including [[Nalini Ranjan Sarkar]] (finance), Bijoy Prasad Singha Roy (revenue), Maharaja [[Srish Chandra Nandy]] (communications and public works), Prasanna Deb Raikut (forest and excise), Mukunda Behari Mallick (cooperative credit and rural indebtedness), Sir Khwaja Nazimuddin (home), Nawab [[Khwaja Habibullah]] (agriculture and industry), Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy (commerce and labour), [[Musharraf Hussain (nawab)|Nawab Musharraf Hussain]] (judicial and legislative affairs), and [[Syed Nausher Ali]] (public health and local self-government).<ref name=\"en.banglapedia.org\">http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Huq,_AK_Fazlul</ref> Huq promoted financial and [[land reform]]s with the Bengal Agricultural Debtors' Act (1938), The Money Lenders' Act (1938), and the Bengal Tenancy (Amendment) Act (1938). He introduced the Primary Education Bill to make primary education free and compulsory. He established schools such as the [[Lady Brabourne College]]. In 1941, Prime Minister Huq joined the [[Viceroy of India|Viceroy's]] Defence Council in support of [[Allied Powers|Allied]] war efforts. In a letter to Governor [[John Herbert (Conservative politician)|John Herbert]], Huq called for the resurrection of a Bengal Army. He wrote \"I want you to consent to the formation of a Bengali Army of a hundred thousand young Bengalis consisting of Hindu and Muslim youths on a fifty-fifty basis. There is an insistent demand for such a step being taken at once, and the people of Bengal will not be satisfied with any excuses. It is a national demand which must be immediately conceded\".<ref name=\"thedailystar1\">{{cite web|author=Syed Ashraf Ali |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-60600 |title=Sher-e-Bangla: A natural leader |publisher=The Daily Star |date= |accessdate=2017-08-10}}</ref> Huq supported the adoption of the [[Lahore Resolution]] in 1940. He envisaged Bengal as one of the \"independent states\" outlined by the resolution.\n\nThe first Huq cabinet dissolved after the BPML withdrew from his government. Huq then formed a second coalition with the [[Hindu Mahasabha]] led by [[Syama Prasad Mukherjee]]. This cabinet was known as the Shyama-Huq Coalition.<ref name=\"en.banglapedia.org\"/> The cabinet included Nawab Bahabur Khwaja Habibullah, Khan Bahadur Abdul Karim, Khan Bahadur Hashem Ali Khan, Shamsuddin Ahmed, Syama Prasad Mukherjee, Santosh Kumar Bose and Upendranath Barman. Huq's government fell in 1943 and a BPML government under [[Khawaja Nazimuddin|Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin]] as [[Prime Minister of Bengal|Prime Minister]] was formed. Nazimuddin's tenure coincided with the Bengal famine of 1943. His government was replaced by [[Governor's rule]]. After the end of World War II, [[1946 Indian provincial elections|elections were held in 1946]] in which the BPML won an overwhelming majority of 113 seats in the 250-seat assembly. A government under [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]] was formed.<ref>{{cite book|title=Nalanda Year-book & Who's who in India|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zja2AAAAIAAJ|year=1946}}</ref> Prime Minister Suhrawardy continued with the policy of power-sharing between Hindus and Muslims. He also advocated a plan for a Bengali sovereign state with a [[Multiconfessionalism|multiconfessionalist]] political system. The breakdown of Hindu-Muslim unity across India eventually upended Bengali power-sharing. Religious violence, including the [[Noakhali riots]] and [[Direct Action Day]] riots, contributed to the polarization. When the Bengal Assembly met to vote on Partition, most West Bengali legislators held a separate meeting and resolved to partition the province and join the Indian union. Most East Bengali legislators favored an undivided Bengal.\n\nThe Bengal Assembly was divided into the [[West Bengal Legislative Assembly]] and [[East Bengal Legislative Assembly]] during the Partition of British India.\n\n===Civil liberties===\n[[English common law]] was applied to Bengal. Local legislation was enacted by the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly. [[Case law]] was also an important source of law. Many laws enacted in British Bengal are still in use today, including the [[Indian Penal Code]]. In 1919, the [[Rowlatt Act]] extended wartime powers under the Defence of India Act 1915, including arbitrary arrests and trial without juries. Press freedom was muzzled by the Indian Press Act 1910. The Seditious Meetings Act 1908 curtailed freedom of assembly. Regulation III of 1818 was also considered draconian. King [[George V]] granted a royal amnesty to free political prisoners. Some draconian laws were repealed, including the Rowlatt Act.<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/gentlemanly-terrorists/reforms-of-1919-montaguchelmsford-the-rowlatt-act-jails-commission-and-the-royal-amnesty/D97CA2DF6D0AEBDD9AD2066DB1504C04/core-reader</ref> Despite being a common law jurisdiction, British India did not enjoy the same level of protection for civil liberties as in the United Kingdom. It was only after independence in 1947 and the adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948, that human rights were clearly enshrined in law.\n\n===Princely states===\n[[File:Thirteenth Dalai Lama Thubten Gyatso.jpg|thumb|upright|The 13th [[Dalai Lama]] in Calcutta in 1910]]\n[[Princely states]] were autonomous principalities under the [[suzerainty]] of the British Crown in India. Initially, the Bengal Presidency managed the British government's relations with most princely states in the northern subcontinent, extending from [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] in the north to [[Manipur (princely state)|Manipur]] in the northeast. An [[Agencies of British India|Agency]] was often formed to be the liaison between the government and the princely states. The largest of these agencies under Bengal once included the [[Rajputana Agency]]. Other agencies covered the [[Chota Nagpur Tributary States]] and the [[Orissa Tributary States]]. Agents were also appointed to deal with tribal chiefs, such as the three tribal kings in the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]]. At the time of the partition of India in 1947, the jurisdiction of the [[Bengal States Agency]] included [[Cooch Behar State]] and [[Hill Tipperah]].\n\n===Himalayan kingdoms===\nBengal was strategically important for the Himalayan regions of Nepal, [[Tibet]], Bhutan and Sikkim. The [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] between the East India Company and the [[Kingdom of Nepal]] was concluded with the [[Treaty of Sugauli]], which ended [[Gorkha Kingdom|Gorkha]] territorial expansion. The [[Treaty of Titalia]] was signed in 1817 between the HEIC and the [[Kingdom of Sikkim]] to establish British hegemony over Sikkim. The [[Bhutan War]] in the 1860s saw the [[Kingdom of Bhutan]] lose control of the [[Bengal Duars]] to the British. The [[British Expedition to Tibet]] took place between 1903 and 1904 which resulted in the [[Treaty of Lhasa]] and an acknowledgment of [[Qing China]]'s supremacy over Tibet.\n\n===Foreign relations===\nThe [[United States of America]] began sending envoys to Fort William in the 18th-century. President [[George Washington]] nominated Benjamin Joy as the first Consul to Fort William on 19 November 1792. The nomination was supported by the erstwhile Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]] and approved by the U. S. Senate on 21 November 1792. Benjamin Joy reached Calcutta in 1794. The HEIC did not recognize Joy as an official consul but allowed him to be a Commercial Agent.<ref>https://in.usembassy.gov/embassy-consulates/kolkata/</ref> The American [[Consulate General]] was established during formal British rule. A consular agency for Chittagong was created in the 1860s. Many other countries also set up consulates in Calcutta.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:A statue at victoria memorial. kolkata.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of [[Lord William Bentinck]] in Calcutta Victoria Memorial. As Governor-General, Bentinck made English the medium of instruction in schools and phased out Persian.]]\n[[File:Ram Mohan Roy statue.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Raja Ram Mohun Roy]], a native reformer and educationist]]\nBritish rule saw the establishment of [[liberal arts colleges]] in many districts of Bengal. There were only two full-fledged universities in Bengal during British rule, including the University of Calcutta and the University of Dacca. Both universities were represented in the Bengal Legislative Assembly under the Government of India Act, 1935.\n\nPrimary education was mandatory under the Compulsory Education Acts.<ref name=\"banglapedia1\">{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Education |title=Education - Banglapedia |publisher=En.banglapedia.org |date= |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> Despite significant advances and the emergence of a large educated middle class, most of the population did not have access to a proper education. During 1946-47, there were 5,298 high schools with an enrolment of 21,99,000 pupils whereas the corresponding figures for 1916-17 were 1,507 and 57,200. The demand for secondary education increased with the growth of political consciousness amongst the masses. The result was the establishment of schools in villages and towns where backward communities could enroll. Female education too received a good deal of attention during the period. Consequently, between 1921\u201322 and 1946\u201347, the number of educational institutions for girls nearly doubled.<ref name=\"banglapedia1\"/> Some of the leading schools included the [[Oriental Seminary]] in Calcutta, the [[St. Gregory's High School]] in Dacca, the [[Rajshahi Collegiate School]] in Rajshahi and the [[Chittagong Collegiate School]] in Chittagong. European missionaries, Hindu philanthropists and Muslim aristocrats were influential promoters of education. Ethnic minorities maintained their own institutions, such as the Armenian [[Pogose School]].\n\nEach district of Bengal had a [[List of Zilla Schools of Bangladesh|district school]], which were the leading secondary institutions. Due to Calcutta being the colonial capital, the city had a large concentration of educational institutions. It was followed by Dacca, which served as a provincial capital between 1905 and 1912. Libraries were established in each district of Bengal by the colonial government and the [[Zamindar]]s. In 1854, four major public libraries were opened, including the Bogra Woodburn Library, the Rangpur Public Library, the Jessore Institute Public Library and the Barisal Public Library. [[Northbrook Hall]] was established in 1882 in honor of Governor-General [[Lord Northbrook]]. Other libraries built include the Victoria Public Library, Natore (1901), the Sirajganj Public Library (1882), the [[Rajshahi Public Library]] (1884), the Comilla Birchandra Library (1885), the Shah Makhdum Institute Public Library, Rajshahi (1891), the Noakhali Town Hall Public Library (1896), the Prize Memorial Library, Sylhet (1897), the Chittagong Municipality Public Library (1904) and the Varendra Research Library (1910).

Calcutta was a major trading port, with links to British colonies in Southeast Asia, including [[Penang]] and [[Singapore]]; as well as [[Australia]]. Its local hinterland spanned beyond Bengal to include north and northeast India, the Himalayan kingdoms and Tibet.

The Permanent Settlement enforced a system in which peasants were indebted to the Zamindars. The peasants rented land from the Zamindars and became tenant farmers. Strong control of land by the Zamindars meant the British had few headaches in exploiting trade and business. However, Bengal received little attention for industrialization due to the entrenched peasant-zamindar relationship under the Permanent Settlement.<ref>https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/30f0/3c45a7353c581c40ac39dbe4ee88621304a2.pdf</ref> The [[Zamindars of Bengal]] built mansions, lodges, modern bungalows, townhouses, and palaces on their estates.

Ganguly directed and wrote ''[[Bilat Ferat(1921)|Bilat Ferat]]'' in 1921, which was the first production of the Indo British Film Co.''[[Jamai Shashthi]]'' (1931) was one of the earliest Bengali [[talkie]]s.\n\nIn 1927\u201328, the [[Dhaka Nawab Family]] produced a short film named ''Sukumary'' (The Good Girl).<ref>{{cite web |title=The Liberation Struggles of a Country and a Festival |url=http://www.dhakafilmfestival.org/the-liberation-struggles-ofa-country-and-a-festival/ |website=dhakafilmfestival.org |publisher=Dhaka Film Festival |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111212011/http://www.dhakafilmfestival.org/the-liberation-struggles-ofa-country-and-a-festival/ |archive-date=11 January 2014 |access-date=1 December 2014}}</ref> After the success of ''Sukumary'', the Nawab's family went for a bigger venture.<ref>{{cite book |last=Raju |first=Zakir |date=2015 |title=Bangladesh Cinema and National Identity: In Search of the Modern |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PnLfBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT91 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |page=91 |isbn=978-0-415-46544-1}}</ref> To make a full-length silent film, a temporary studio was made in the gardens of the family's estate, and they produced a full-length silent film titled ''The Last Kiss'', released in 1931.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dhaka Nawab Family and Film |url=http://www.nawabbari.com/main_arts.html?string=lastKiss.html |website=nawabbari.com |publisher=Nawab Bari |accessdate=1 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Did you know?

There was a growing cultural awakening in [[Bengali Muslim]] society, including the emergence of [[Mir Mosharraf Hossain]] as the first Muslim novelist of Bengal; [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] as a celebrated poet who merged Bengali and Hindustani influences; [[Begum Rokeya]] and [[Nawab Faizunnesa]] as feminist educators; [[Kaykobad]] as an epic poet; and members of the [[Freedom of Intellect Movement]].\n\nBengal played a major role in the [[Indian independence movement]] and the [[Pakistan movement]]. The earliest organized anti-colonial groups appeared in Bengal. The region produced many of the subcontinent's political leaders during the early 20th century. Political parties and rebel groups were formed across the region.\n\n===Architecture===\nCivic architecture began following European styles after the advent of the East India Company's authority. The [[Indo-Saracenic]] style, merging [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Indo-Islamic architecture]], was started by British architects in the late 19th-century. While cities such as Calcutta and Dacca featured more civic architecture, [[country houses]] were built in many towns and villages across Bengal. [[Art deco]] influences began in the 1930s. Wealthy Bengali families (especially [[zamindar]] estates) employed European firms to design houses and palaces. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Architecture in British Bengal\" style=\"font-size:88%; line-height:130%; border-bottom:1px #aaa solid;\" heights=\"180\">\nThe Hooghly Bridge (BOND 0034).jpeg|[[Howrah Bridge]] in 1945\nVictoria Memorial, Calcutta - LIFE.jpg|[[Victoria Memorial, Kolkata]]\nWriters Building.jpg|[[Writer's Building]]\nRuplal House old.jpg|[[Ruplal House]]\nCompleted Bridge.

Historians have argued that the British used a policy of [[divide and rule]] among Hindus and Muslims. This meant favoring Hindus over Muslims and vice versa in certain sectors. For example, after the [[Permanent Settlement]], Hindu merchants such as the [[Tagore family]] were awarded large land grants that previously belonged to the Mughal aristocracy. In Calcutta, where Hindus formed a majority, wealthy Muslims were often given favors over Hindus. One aspect that benefitted the Hindu community was increased literacy rates. Many Muslims, however, remained alienated from English education after the abolition of Persian. Bengali society continued to experience religious nationalism which led to the partition of Bengal in 1947.\n\nBritish Bengali cities included a cosmopolitan population, including Armenians and Jews. [[Anglo-Indians]] formed a prominent part of the urban population. Several [[Gentlemen's clubs]] were established, including the [[Bengal Club]], [[Calcutta Club]], [[Dhaka Club|Dacca Club]], [[Chittagong Club]], [[Tollygunge Club]] and [[Saturday Club (Kolkata)|Saturday Club]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of governors of Bengal]]\n* [[Advocate-General of Bengal]]\n\n== References == \n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Works cited == \n{{EB1911|wstitle=Bengal}}\n* [[Christopher Bayly|C.

Ghiasi et al. created networking diagrams, depicting the frequency of collaboration among authors, and the success of each collaboration was measured by the number of times the study was cited. The collaboration networks illustrate that mixed-gender teams have a higher average rate of productivity and citations, yet 50% of male engineers have collaborated only with other men and 38% of female engineers have collaborated only with men. The researchers use [[impact factor]]s\u2014the average annual number of citation that a journal receives\u2014to measure the prestige of academic journals. Their study shows that when women publish their research in journals with high-impact factors, they receive fewer citations from the engineering community.<ref name=\":0\" /> The authors explain their findings as a possible consequence of the \"[[Matilda effect]]\", a phenomenon that systematically undervalues the scientific contributions of women.\n\nIn addition to engineering, a gender bias in publishing is exemplified in economics. In 2015, Heather Sarsons released a working paper comparing credit allocated to men and women in collaborative research.<ref name=\":1\" /> Sarsons analyzed the publication records of economists at top universities over the past 40 years, and found that female economists publish work as frequently as their male cohorts, yet their tenure prospects are less than half that of men. Women receive comparable credit to men when they solo author their work or co-author with other female economist, evinced by an 8\u20139% increase in their tenure prospects, implying that tenure prospects decrease with collaborative work due to lack of credit given to women, not the quality of their work. Men receive the same amount of credit for solo authoring and co-authoring their work, shown by an 8\u20139% increase in their tenure prospects; however, when women co-author with men, there is no increase in their tenure prospects.\n\nIn the academic disciplines of political science and [[international relations]], research has found evidence of gender bias in publishing and teaching.

A study published in 2015 by Gita Ghiasi, Vincent Lariviere, and Cassidy Sugimoto demonstrates that women represent 20% of all scientific production in the field of engineering.

Ghiasi et al. created networking diagrams, depicting the frequency of collaboration among authors, and the success of each collaboration was measured by the number of times the study was cited. The collaboration networks illustrate that mixed-gender teams have a higher average rate of productivity and citations, yet 50% of male engineers have collaborated only with other men and 38% of female engineers have collaborated only with men. The researchers use [[impact factor]]s\u2014the average annual number of citation that a journal receives\u2014to measure the prestige of academic journals.
