The series centers on Tori Vega, a student of Hollywood Arts, who gets into wacky unpredictable situations with her friends.\n\n[[File:Victorious Season 1 Cast Promo Image.jpg|thumb|400px|right| The main characters of ''[[Victorious]]'' (left to right): Rex Powers (Robbie's puppet, voiced by [[Jake Farrow]]), Robbie Shapiro ([[Matt Bennett]]), Cat Valentine ([[Ariana Grande]]), Trina Vega ([[Daniella Monet]]), Tori Vega ([[Victoria Justice]]), Andre Harris ([[Leon Thomas III]]), Jade West ([[Elizabeth Gillies]]) and Beck Oliver ([[Avan Jogia]]).]]\n\n==Main characters==\n\n===Tori Vega===\nTori Vega (portrayed by [[Victoria Justice]]) is the younger sister of Trina Vega and attends Hollywood Arts, a performing arts high school, along with her sister.\n\nWhen Trina, Tori's older sister, experiences an allergic reaction to a Chinese herb to try to make her voice sound better Trina's tongue gets swollen right before a big showcase at school, Tori is volunteered by Andre to take her place, since she knew the how the piece was meant to be performed. Tori performs \"[[Make it Shine]]\" (the ''Victorious'' theme song) and everyone is impressed with her performance, including the principal, who offers her an enrollment to the school. She accepts it and is admitted to Hollywood Arts. Initially feeling out of place at Hollywood Arts, Tori makes new, supportive friends and becomes more comfortable. From there onward, the show details Tori's journey through school as she gets into wacky situations have differences and adventures with her friends. She is one of the favorite students of her teacher, Sikowitz.\n\nShe is depicted as creative, nice, caring, forgiving, responsible, positive, easy-going, and friendly, though she can be sneaky and vindictive, going as low as to manipulate her friends and family (especially Trina), but will always do the right thing in the end. Tori is shown to care for her friends and family a lot and is willing to help them no matter what, even when hesitant to.\n\nTori is friends with Beck Oliver, Cat Valentine, Robbie Shapiro, and is the closest to Andre. She often tries to be nice to Jade and sometimes describes Jade as her friend, even though Jade herself does not. In some episodes, the two seem to be moving towards becoming friends, although most of the time, Jade seems to be \"frenemies\" with Tori.\n\nIn later episodes, Tori is shown to wear glasses when at home and while at school she wears contacts.\n\n===Andre Harris===\nAndre Harris (portrayed by [[Leon Thomas III]]) is Tori's best friend. Andre is an aspiring musician who loves to perform and write his songs. He can play many instruments, including the guitar, [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]], piano, and the [[French horn]], but prefers the keyboard and piano. Andre takes his music seriously and is usually seen playing at all of Tori's performances. He is a talented singer and songwriter, having co-written nearly every song Tori has sung. He also often gets Tori to sing back-up for him at his performances.\n\nAndre is shown to be witty and kind and Tori often relies on him for support in her time of need, and he is always there for her, although she is easily distracted at times. Tori often ask him for help or advice. He also likes to make jokes, but none of the other characters find him humorous.\n\nAndre has [[#Andre's grandmother|a grandmother]] who is mentally unstable. He also has a cousin who works as an actor, and an uncle who is a real estate agent, who once sold a house to [[Kenan Thompson]].\n\nIn \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep29|Jade Gets Crushed]]\", Andre develops feelings for Jade after they work together on a song for a project for one of Andre's classes. Andre hears Jade sing beautifully. At the end of the episode, Andre tells Tori that it seems that he is over Jade, but his former crush on Jade is mentioned again in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep51|Tori Fixes Beck and Jade]]\".\n\n===Robbie Shapiro===\nRobert \u201cRobbie\u201c Shapiro<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theslap.com/clips/robbie-and-cat-s-bad-news-songs-the-mole?ads=false |title=Victorious - Programma\u2019s - Nickelodeon |website=TheSlap.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref> (portrayed by [[Matt Bennett]]) is one of Tori's friends at Hollywood Arts. He speaks along with a puppet, Rex Powers, whom he and all others speak to as if it were an actual person. Robbie is a skilled [[ventriloquist]], but he was uncredited for his talent until the episode \"Freak the Freak Out\". In the episode, Robbie does not understand why he was referred to as a \"ventriloquist\", which either jokingly indicates that Rex has a mind of his own and is not controlled by Robbie at all or (in a more serious matter) that Robbie suffers a [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic disorder]], therefore considering Rex a real person.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nick.com/shows/victorious/characters/robbie.html |title=Robbie/Matt Bennett (Nickelodeon) |access-date=2011-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105192107/http://www.nick.com/shows/victorious/characters/robbie.html |archive-date=2011-01-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He is said to have had Rex since he was little and the two are almost always seen together. Robbie [[personifies]] Rex, which leads to many an arguments about Rex's true [[sentience]]. He constantly argues that Rex is not a puppet or dummy when told otherwise. Robbie is closest to Rex and affectionate towards him, though Rex ridicules him often.\n\nRobbie is considered extremely nerdy, shy, and socially awkward, but a good, loyal, and honest to a friend and others. Robbie has a great deal of trouble with relationships and attracting girls. Robbie also is in love with Cat Valentine and is proven true in the episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep45|The Blonde Squad]]\" in which Robbie writes and sings the song \"I Think You're Swell\" for her. The song is about what a great person she is, and how they get along so well, and that she is all he thinks about. She, however, does not appear to get the true feelings behind it, though she does appear to greatly enjoy the song. He is also shown to be the only one who knows Cat's full name, Caterina. He does not seem to have a sense of privacy. His only relative who has ever been seen is [[#Mamaw|his grandmother]]. It is revealed that Robbie is intolerant to gluten, otherwise known as [[Celiac Disease]]. It is revealed in \"Wok Star\" Robbie is [[American Jews|Jewish]] because he spent his [[Bar Mitzvah]] money on leather pants and male make-up. He is also mistaken for a girl in a couple of episodes such as \"Locked Up\", in which he is put on the wrong side of the fence in jail in a foreign county.\n\n====Rex Powers====\nRex Powers (physically portrayed by a ventriloquist dummy named Christopher Cane, performed by [[Matt Bennett]], voiced by an uncredited [[Jake Farrow]]<ref>{{cite web |author=Stacey Grant |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2877247/drake-and-josh-victorious-rex-the-puppet-voice-jake-farrow-dan-schneider/ |title=Did You Know This ''Drake & Josh'' Star Voiced Rex The Puppet On Victorious? |work=[[MTV News]] |date=May 5, 2016 |accessdate=2016-08-12}}</ref>) is Robbie's [[alter ego]], who is a [[Ventriloquism|dummy]] that Robbie carries around everywhere. Robbie has had Rex since he was young. Since Robbie is too shy to speak for himself most of the time, he talks as Rex, using him to voice his actual feelings and thoughts. The others treat Rex as a real person, and both Robbie and Rex dislike it when Rex is called a \"dummy\" or \"[[puppet]]\". Rex is obsessed with \"Northridge Girls\", dumb, talentless and 'easy' girls from a [[Northridge, Los Angeles|Los Angeles neighborhood]].\n\nIn \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep14|Rex Dies]]\" he gets sucked into a wind machine and is taken to a hospital, even though he is a dummy. Rex is shown to have a huge crush on Tori and constantly flirts with her, though she is annoyed by his affection. Robbie often turns to Rex for advice and insight, though Rex's advice is almost always off-beat. Rex is sarcastic and mean, especially to Robbie, though it is shown that neither can stay without the other.\n\nIn the first 3 seasons, Rex is always in Robbie's company. In season 4 for unexplained reasons, Robbie is frequently seen without Rex. Part 2 of \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep13|Freak the Freak Out]]\" was the first episode not to feature Rex.\n\nIn 2011, Rex hosted a [[blooper]]s episode of ''Victorious'' titled \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep32|Blooptorious]]\" in which he interviewed cast members and showed [[outtake]]s from the series. In the episode, Rex is named Christopher Cane and is not accompanied by Robbie. As Christopher Cane, he also hosted a 2011 blooper episode of ''[[iCarly]]'' titled \"[[iCarly (season 5)#ep80|iBloop 2: Electric Bloopaloo]]\".\n\nRex later appeared in the 2015 ''[[Game Shakers]]'' episode \"Tiny Pickles\" (Season 1, Episode 5) where he is a truck driver.\n\n===Jade West===\nJade West (portrayed by [[Elizabeth Gillies]]) is a [[frenemy]] of Tori from Hollywood Arts. She has a [[Gothic fashion|gothic]] sense of style\u2014always wearing dark clothes with eyebrow piercings and different colors of streaks in her hair\u2014and is the long-time girlfriend of [[#Beck Oliver|Beck Oliver]]. She is very possessive of her boyfriend and is known to lash out at anyone who she views as a threat to their relationship. She shows very little affection for anyone.\n\nIn the pilot episode, Jade mistakenly believes that Tori is flirting with Beck, so she later pours coffee onto Tori\u2019s head during an acting class. Tori later get even with her by defeating her in an alphabetical improv game and kissing Beck as they were the only two actors remaining in the scene.\n\nJade has been known to take obsession in triumphing over any enemies or rivals she may find, and occasionally has been known to take an interest in bizarre, dark, or unusual things that usually would repulse or frighten other people. She has a fascination with scissors, as she is sometimes seen holding scissors and her locker is decorated with them.\n\nIn \"Ice Cream for Ke$ha\", it is revealed that her childhood was a dark and unhappy one, her favorite play toy being a [[hammer]], and that she had been raised by an unsupportive and similarly emotionless father and a mother she could not emotionally connect with. She is also seen to be an amazing singer and actress, which are the main talents that got her into Hollywood Arts. In the season 1 episode \"Jade Dumps Beck\", it is revealed that they had been dating for nearly two years. However, they break up in the episode \"The Worst Couple\" after non-stop fighting, although it becomes clear that Jade still has feelings for him. After taking some time apart, the two make amends in the episode \"Tori Fixes Beck and Jade\" when Jade sings a song that is implied to be dedicated to Beck, leading them to admit that they have missed each other and get back together.\n\nJade later appeared in the ''[[Sam & Cat]]'' episode \"#TheKillerTunaJump\" where she ends up meeting Sam Puckett and befriending her, whereas Cat had thought that the two girls would kill each other upon first sight due to their similar personalities. It is Sam and Jade's friendship that makes Cat jealous enough to call Freddie Benson to Burbank so that she can flirt with him.\n\n===Cat Valentine===\nCatarina \"Cat\" Valentine (portrayed by [[Ariana Grande]]) is one of Tori's strangest friends from Hollywood Arts. She is fun, energetic, and at times oblivious. In a video on TheSlap, she reveals that her full first name is Catarina but only her grandmother calls her by her full name. It was also revealed by Robbie in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep45|The Blonde Squad]]\" when he yelled \"Catarina Valentine, I will not sit here anymore and listen to you talk bad about yourself!\"<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Blonde Squad|series=Victorious|network=Nickelodeon|airdate=June 30, 2012|season=3|number=12|time=12:50|quote=Catarina Valentine, I will not sit here anymore and listen to you talk bad about yourself! You're adorable!}} (name spelling via subtitles)</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Victorious - Cat's Random Thoughts #1|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3XvHpbbA3g|accessdate=2011-12-07}}</ref> She is relatively friendly and liked by all of the students. She is sweet, naive, bubbly and happy, often unsuspecting of what is going on around her. She has a playful nature and has a very short attention span, so she can easily be distracted with colorful items by the others when they want her out of the way. She can be somewhat of a [[wikt: drama queen|drama queen]] and does not take criticism very well. She often screams ''\"What's that supposed to mean!?\"'' when offended, which is very often and has become her catchphrase.<ref>[http://www.nick.com/shows/victorious/characters/cat.html Cat/Ariana Grande (Nickelodeon)]</ref> Cat often says random and strange things which leaves the others, especially Jade, confused or annoyed.\n \nCat is also an extremely talented singer and actress, as seen in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep13|Freak The Freak Out]]\" where she sings a duet with Jade, and in the crossover episode \"[[iParty with Victorious]]\" where she shows a high vocal range. A running gag of the series is Cat often telling her friends or strangers about [[#Cat's brother|her brother]], who seems to have many unnatural problems, all of which Cat does not seem to find strange or abnormal. She has bright red hair that she dyed to resemble her favorite snack, a [[red velvet cake|red velvet cupcake]]. Andre's nickname for her is \"Little Red\", which she took offense to at first, but then called it \"creative\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theslap.com/clips/cat-s-video-profile |title=Cat's Video Profile |website=TheSlap.com}}</ref> She is occasionally seen carrying stuffed animals. Through the series, she has become ditzier and over the top, with a higher-pitched voice and her abnormal conversations.\n\nIn January 2013 in the episode \"Star-Spangled Tori\", Cat's parents move away to [[Idaho]] to be with her [[mental health|mentally ill]] brother at a [[mental institution]] for between 6 months and 2 years where the doctors can make sure he gets lots of mental relaxation and cannot escape and keep him institutionalized. Their parents wanted her to live with her and her brother's Uncle Walter and Aunt Pearl, while they are in Idaho but according to Cat, they are very strict and mean. They do not like her red hair, they only eat vegetables, they said she cannot have unlimited texting, and they will not let her flush the toilet unless it is \"necessary\". This caused Cat to run away and take refuge in the attic of Hollywood Arts' BlackBox theater, where her living habits were discovered by Robbie and Jade. After Jade called up Cat's parents, Cat goes to live with her grandmother \u2013 who turned out to be living in Venice, California and not Venice, Italy as Cat had initially thought \u2013 until her parents and brother return. She refers to her grandmother as \"Nona\".\n\nWhen ''Victorious'' airs its final season, Cat becomes a co-lead character on the crossover spin-off ''[[Sam & Cat]]'', a sitcom that began airing in 2013 and concluded in 2014. Sam and Cat become roommates when Cat's Nona (portrayed by [[Maree Cheatham]]) goes to live in Elderly Acres. Sam and Cat previously met each other in the 2011 ''[[iCarly]]'' crossover episode \"iParty with Victorious\", but neither of them made many contacts. In the spin-off, Sam officially meets Cat after saving her from the garbage truck. The next day, Sam and Cat set up a [[babysitting]] service to raise some extra cash after watching some kids. Sam and Cat's home is stated to be \"the poshest apartment in the building\".\n\n===Beck Oliver===\nBeck Oliver (portrayed by [[Avan Jogia]]) is Jade's boyfriend. He has been together with Jade for over two years and, unlike everyone else, is completely unafraid of her (even laughing when Andre admitted to being scared of her) and often likes to tease and make her jealous because of her reactions, which he finds amusing. Beck seems to be the only one who can calm Jade down when she becomes angry and has some control over her as seen throughout the series.\n\nBeck is seen as soft-spoken, friendly, laid back, modest, open and caring. Although he is shown to get annoyed and even lose his temper, usually by Robbie or Trina, he is normally calm and collected. Because of his good looks and personality, he is possibly the most popular guy at Hollywood Arts and attracts almost all females and girls like Trina, sometimes even older women. He seems to be aware of the effect he has on girls, sometimes using his looks to his advantage. He and Andre are close friends. His school locker is transparent, which is his way of saying that he has no secrets, which is revealed to Tori when she was attempting to find a decorative idea for her locker. He lives in a trailer that is parked in his parents' driveway, being told if he lived with them then he would have to go by their rules, and he stated \"my roof, my rules\". In the season 2 premiere, Jade mentions that Beck is Canadian.\n\nIt is shown in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep21|Beck Falls For Tori]]\" and \"[[iParty with Victorious]]\" that Beck has never felt true terror nor has he ever been scared by anything, a fact backed up by Jade who calls him \"unscareable\". He usually tries to keep peace in the group and hold everyone together. Beck breaks up with Jade in the season 3 episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep35|The Worst Couple]]\" after getting tired of constantly fighting with her. In the episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep43|Tori Goes Platinum]]\" Beck tries to kiss Tori, revealing that he has romantic feelings for her, but she rejects him because she viewed it as a betrayal to Jade to kiss her ex-boyfriend. In the episode, [[List of Victorious episodes#ep51|Tori Fixes Beck and Jade]], Beck tries dating a girl named Meredith, who wants to do anything he wants, causing him to realize how he prefers dating a girl who \"fights back\" and \"has a big mouth\" because it is not easy and that an easy relationship to him is \"boring\". This causes him to see how much he misses being with Jade and that he loves her, bringing the two back together again. Following this, their relationship is stronger and more stable.\n\nIn ''[[Sam & Cat]]'', Jade says that the two are still in a relationship.\n\n===Trina Vega===\nTrina Vega (portrayed by [[Daniella Monet]]) is Tori's older sister, who also attends Hollywood Arts. Trina's allergic reaction to a Chinese herb gargle in the [[Television pilot|pilot]] episode forces Tori to fill in for her in the school's big showcase, which leads to Tori being offered admission to Hollywood Arts.\n\nTrina believes that acting and singing is her destiny, and is oblivious to her actual lack of any talent. The only reason Trina is in Hollywood Arts is that Sikowitz had a coconut-induced hallucination during Trina's audition, which turned her performance into a psychedelic extravaganza for him, and every other judge was out at the time. Trina is quite selfish and shallow most of the time, and is portrayed as being extremely difficult to deal with, sometimes even being called a \"monster\" in \"Freak the Freak Out.\" However, before she was admitted to Hollywood Arts, she was depicted at her audition as a shy, sweet, nerdy girl.\n\nDespite Trina's shallow personality, she can be concerned about her sister when she wants to be and it is shown that she does look out for Tori a lot. Later in the series, she showed some minor character growth, such as in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep25|Locked Up!]]\" when she tries to get Tori out of a Yerbanian prison when she was accused of \"attacking\" the unnamed Yerbanian Chancellor and showed genuine concern for her well being. Other examples of this are evidenced in the episodes \"Tori the Zombie\", \"Beggin' On Your Knees\", and \"Tori Gets Stuck\".\n\nTrina also seems to have bad luck, as she often gets hurt. Some examples include: Falling from the ceiling, a wall falling on her, getting hit in the face with flour, and getting hit with a box of shoes.\n\nBy the final episode \"Victori-yes\", Trina has landed a role on a Spanish-language television show titled ''Divertisimo'', which she boasts is \"a high-quality television show with top-notch acting\". She is eventually shown portraying a giant piece of cheese being tormented by children in mouse costumes.\n\n==Recurring characters==\n\n===Sinjin===\nSinjin Van Cleef<ref name=VanCleef>Van Cleef - Sinjin's last name is shown on his [http://www.theslap.com/profiles/sinjin-van-cleef profile on TheSlap]</ref> (portrayed by [[Michael Eric Reid]]) is a strange and questionable student at Hollywood Arts. He is nerdy, disturbing, and very weird, often considered stranger than even Robbie or Cat; his locker has his chewed up food on it and he also likes to collect the teeth of past presidents' relatives. He is usually used as a fake date or bribed to fake date someone, including Cat. He usually interrupts conversations with weird comments that do not make sense. He is a fan of [[disco]] music and has a huge crush on Tori and Jade, although both show more irritation than the interest in his presence. Sinjin is skilled in the background work on the school's productions and performances. He is shown to be proficient with audio, lighting, and making props, and is the apparent leader of the technical team. He appears in almost every episode of the series, except for \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep3|Stage Fighting]]\",\" \"[[List of Victorious episodes#12|Cat's New Boyfriend]],\" \"[[List of Victorious episodes#19|Sleepover at Sikowitz's]],\" \"[[List of Victorious episodes#25|Locked Up!]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#28|Tori Tortures Teacher]], \"[[List of Victorious episodes#29|Jade Gets Crushed]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#30|Terror on Cupcake Street]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#33|The Breakfast Bunch]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#36|Andre's Horrible Girl]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#37|Car, Rain and Fire]]\" and \"[[List of Victorious episodes#40|Driving Tori Crazy]]\". It is revealed in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#31|A Christmas Tori]]\" that he has a sister named Courtney (played by Dominique Grund) who also attends Hollywood Arts.\n\n===Sikowitz===\nErwin Sikowitz<ref name=Sikowitz>Erwin - Sikowitz's first name is shown on his [http://www.theslap.com/profiles/erwin-sikowitz profile on TheSlap]</ref> (pronounced \"psycho-wits\") (portrayed by [[Eric Lange]]) is the [[hippie]]-like acting teacher at Hollywood Arts. His habits might be interpreted as weird and his methods are shown to be often very strange (such as throwing a ball at Cat while she was performing), but at times very effective. He often walks around barefoot, which is the supposed trait of the hippies. He likes to enter the class through a window and is almost always seen drinking from coconut because, as Jade says, \"the milk gives him visions\". Tori gave him two dollars on her first day at Hollywood Arts, thinking he was homeless. He also gave Cat, Jade, Beck, Andre, and Robbie permission to start a fake ping-pong team to make money and have a fancy dinner. He claims to be 34 years old in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#15|The Diddly-Bops]]\".\n\nHe appears in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#1|Pilot]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#2|The Bird Scene]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#10|Beck's Big Break]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#11|The Great Ping Pong Scam]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Cat's New Boyfriend]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Freak The Freak Out]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Rex Dies]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|The Diddly-Bops]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#19|Sleepover at Sikowitz's]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#21|Beck Falls for Tori]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#23|Tori Gets Stuck]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#24|Prom Wrecker]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#25|Locked Up!]]\", \"[[iParty with Victorious]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#26|Helen Back Again]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Tori Tortures Teacher]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Terror on Cupcake Street]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|A Christmas Tori]]\", [[List of Victorious episodes#34|The Gorilla Club]], [[List of Victorious episodes#38|Tori & Jade's Playdate]], [[List of Victorious episodes#39|April Fools Blank]], [[List of Victorious episodes#41|How Trina Got In]], [[List of Victorious episodes#42-43|Tori Goes Platinum (parts 1-2)]], [[List of Victorious episodes#44|Crazy Ponnie]], [[List of Victorious episodes#52|Cell Block]], [[List of Victorious episodes#55|Robbie Sells Rex]], [[List of Victorious episodes#57|Star Spangled Tori]] and [[List of Victorious episodes#58|Victori-yes]].\n\n\"[[List of Victorious episodes#1|Pilot]]\" is the only episode where he is referred to as Mr. Sikowitz. In all other episodes, he is just called Sikowitz. In \"[[List of Victorious episodes#19|Sleepover at Sikowitz's]]\", it is revealed that he has a nephew named Jason, who went out on a date with Cat, although the results are not mentioned. His catchphrase is \"Good [[Gandhi]]!\" As strange as Sikowitz is, he is the favorite teacher of Tori, Cat, Jade, Beck, Andre, and Robbie, and is very open and comfortable with them, to the point he says that he is their friend in a few episodes.\n\nSikowitz is regularly seen drinking from a coconut (he once drank fermented coconut milk and had visions during Trina's audition). In one episode when Tori goes to him asking for help, he is hanging upside down from the ceiling, and in another, he stored his grandmother in the corner before slinging her over his shoulder and taking her to the hospital. He has an extremely strange house as revealed in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#19|Sleepover at Sikowitz's]]\". At the Hollywood Arts Prom, he brought a pile of tires, matches and a bottle of fuel, thinking for unknown reasons that they were going to have a bonfire of tires.\n\nSikowitz appeared in the ''[[Sam & Cat]]'' episode \"#MommaGoomer.\" He is seen teaching his students about backward acting when Sam and Cat come in. Sikowitz scolds Cat for showing up very late with the class being almost over. When the bell rings, Sam and Cat tell Sikowitz that they would like to use his classroom for a charity called \"The Salvation Goomers\" (which was a cover-up for Goomer claiming to his mother that he is a history teacher). During Goomer's teaching of history to Sam, Cat, Dice, Goomer's mom, and the local shruggers,{{clarify|date=December 2017}} Sikowitz comes in stating that he had gone to Charityosity.com where he found nothing about \"The Salvation Goomers.\" After Goomer confessed to his mother that he is an [[Mixed martial artist|MMA]] Fighter, Sikowitz uses an electric shaver to get the fake pit hair off of Dice's armpits claiming that he grew them too soon. In the same series, Cat has a picture of Sikowitz near her bed in the room that she shares with Sam.\n\n===Lane===\nLane Alexander (portrayed by [[Lane Napper]]) is the [[School counselor|guidance counselor]] for Hollywood Arts. Lane is a good guidance counselor, and often helps students with their problems and resolves their arguments, but sometimes can be reluctant at times, asking students \"Why Me?\". He is usually the one making the big announcements at school. He appears to either hate dry skin or is obsessed with lotion (as seen in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#17|The Wood]]\"), as he can be seen frequently applying lotion to his hands. He has a nephew named Devon, as seen in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#15|The Diddly-Bops]]\". Lane is the one who made a reality television series, ''The Wood'', leave the school because it was becoming an issue with the students and disrupting the learning environment.\n\nHe tends to be a bit extreme in his dealings such as when he issued a two-week detention to Tori for a supposed accidental hit on Jade during a stage fighting practice, made Robbie and Trina cover for Festus after accidentally injuring him, and having Tori and Jade take Festus home after unknowingly wrecking his car which was similar to one of the janitors' car.\n\nHe appears in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#1|Pilot]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#2|The Bird Scene]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#3|Stage Fighting]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#6|Tori The Zombie]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#7|Robarazzi]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#10|Beck's Big Break]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#11|The Great Ping Pong Scam]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#12|Cat's New Boyfriend]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#15|The Diddly Bops]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#17|The Wood]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#23|Tori Gets Stuck]]\", \"[[iParty With Victorious]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#26|Helen Back Again]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#27|Who Did It to Trina?]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#28|Tori Tortures Teacher]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#29|Jade Gets Crushed]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#35|The Worst Couple]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#41|How Trina Got In]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#43|Crazy Ponnie]]\" and \"[[List of Victorious episodes#51|One Thousand Berry Balls]]\".\n\nAs revealed on his profile on TheSlap.com, Lane's last name is Alexander.\n\n===David and Holly Vega===\nDavid and Holly Vega (portrayed by [[Jim Pirri]] and Jennifer Carta) are the parents of Tori and Trina. David works as a [[police officer]] while Holly's job was never revealed.\n\nThey appear in \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Pilot]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|The Birthweek Song]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Sleepover at Sikowitz's]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Locked Up]]\", and \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Jade Gets Crushed]]\" though their mother appeared in \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Robarazzi]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|A Film by Dale Squires]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Helen Back Again]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Driving Tori Crazy]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Tori Goes Platinum]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Crazy Ponnie]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Cell Block]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|The Bad Roommate]]\" and \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Star Spangled-Tori]]\", and their dad appears in \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Freak the Freak Out]]\" and \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Car, Rain and Fire]]\".\n\nThey are shown to be caring and loving parents, but when their daughters get too out of control, they tend to stay out of it and go off doing something else, which is indicating that they are very unhelpful parents. For example, in \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Freak the Freak Out]]\", Trina gets her wisdom teeth removed and their parents decide to go out of town so they would not have to take care of her, knowing she would get violent. Tori likes to point out at times that her father is a cop, usually to Sinjin, but also to others, especially if someone is annoying her. David Vega works as with LAPD and is originally from Puerto Rico.\n\n===Andre's grandmother===\nCharlotte Harris<ref name=CharlotteHarris>Charlotte Harris - First name \"Charlotte\" revealed in a video on TheSlap.com. \"Mrs. Harris\" used by many characters in various episodes. Credited as \"Andre's grandmother\".</ref> (portrayed by Marilyn Harris) is Andre's grandmother. She is mentally unstable and often paranoid about things. She is shown to be afraid of nearly everything, including various sensible objects such as clocks and mirrors. In the episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes#9|Wi-Fi in the Sky]]\" she gets scared after seeing her reflection in a mirror and screams \"Andre, there's another 'me' on the wall!\". When she is greeted by new people, she hides behind anything she can find, while simultaneously shouting out \"I don't know you!\" Andre tells Tori in the \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Pilot]]\" episode that her coming to see Trina perform \"Make it Shine\" is the first time in six years that she has left her house. He also mentions in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#8|Survival of the Hottest]]\" that before she lost her mind, she used to tell him, \"Andre, no matter how bad things get, you can always make it better by singing a song\". She often snaps at Andre and is possibly the only way she communicates with anyone. In \"[[List of Victorious episodes#9|Wi-Fi in the Sky]],\" she yells at Andre for \"talking to himself\" when he was in reality video chatting with Tori, Cat, and Beck then freaks out and punches Andre's computer. During an interview on a video on TheSlap.com in which Andre read off her crazy text messages, her first name is revealed to be Charlotte. She has appeared in \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Pilot]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#9|Wi-Fi in the Sky]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#19|Sleepover At Sikowitz's]]\", \"[[iParty With Victorious]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#40|Driving Tori Crazy]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#50|Tori Fixes Beck and Jade]]\" and \"[[List of Victorious episodes#53|The Bad Roommate]]\".\n\n===Mrs. Lee===\nMrs. Lee (portrayed by Susan Chuang) is the owner of Tori's favorite Chinese restaurant Wok Star, who volunteers to pay to produce Jade's play. But things get complicated when Mrs. Lee makes drastic changes to the script and wants to put her daughter, Daisy, in the play. Mrs. Lee returns in the episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep36|Andre's Horrible Girl]]\", now operating a Sushi bar called '''Nozu''' after Wok Star burns down. This prompts Tori to ask if she is Chinese or Japanese, which she answers with a smack to Tori's head.\n\nShe later appears in the third-season episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep41|How Trina Got In]]\", making Tori and Robbie chop a pile of squid after they cannot pay their bill. After the bill was worked off, Robbie accidentally breaks some dishes, causing Mrs. Lee to have Robbie work off the damages with one of the jobs being rubbing her chef Kwakoo's feet.\n\nShe also appeared in the fourth-season episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep47|The Hambone King]]\" where she praises Robbie's [[hamboning]] skills.\n\n===Kwakoo===\nKwakoo (portrayed by N\u00e9e L\u00e9au) is a worker at Nozu that works for Mrs. Lee as a [[chef]] as seen in \"How Trina Got In.\"\n\nIn \"The Hambone King,\" Kwakoo asked Robbie for his autograph after seeing Robbie's hambone video.\n\n===Festus===\nFestus (portrayed by Marco Aiello) is the proprietor of The Grub Truck, a [[food truck]] located at the school.

He either has or may have a habit of lying to customers.\n\nIn \"Beck's Big Break\" when Tori asked for a sandwich he said he only served burritos but gave her a sandwich anyway. In the same episode, he is also shown to scream at people who are not there when in the Grub Truck.\n\nIn \"The Wood\", he was injured by Robbie and Trina and they were forced by Lane to replace him for a short time. Tori and Jade accidentally destroyed his car in the same episode upon mistaken for one of the cars belonging to one of Hollywood Arts' janitors and had to take him home in a wheelbarrow.\n\nIn \"Locked Up!\", he tells Tori about his home country Yerba and how she and her friends could stay there if they perform a song every day and the country would pay for the hotel rooms. It is also revealed that he has a brother named Sgrodis (portrayed by [[Winston Story]]) who is the hotel manager.\n\n===Burf===\nBurf (portrayed by Darsan Solomon) is a student who goes to Hollywood Arts and always hangs out with Sinjin. He is first seen in the episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes#38|Tori & Jade's Playdate]]\", spying on Tori and Jade for Sikowitz so they cannot escape Nozu. He then appears in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#40|Driving Tori Crazy]]\" when Cat offers him a bag of rags. He also appears in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#45|The Blonde Squad]]\", and in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#42|Tori Goes Platinum]]\", when he sends in a video of himself singing for a contest.

He is also seen in the episode \"How Trina Got In,\" where he appears in the flashbacks of Andre, Jade, Beck, and Sikowitz.\n\n===Cat's brother<!--Per the Manual of Style, \"brother\" needs to be uncapitalized, as it is not a proper noun.-->===\nCat frequently mentions her brother, whose name is never revealed. He is often mentioned as a focal point of bizarre off-screen antics, which either happen to him or which he causes himself. Examples include eating Cat's charm bracelet, getting stabbed in Japan, biting Cat on the foot, falling from a terrace onto a shuttle bus, being shot by a clown, painting his body purple for a job interview, and somehow procuring twelve gallons of real blood for Jade's play. On TheSlap, Cat revealed he is not allowed outside by himself and that he plays \"hide and seek\" with the police. His favorite flavor of ice cream is \"Funky Nut Blast\", as revealed in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep22|Ice Cream for Ke$ha]]\". In \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep37|Car, Rain, and Fire]]\", Tori, Cat, and Jade borrow Cat's brother's car which had unusual features such as a coverless roof, rope for a seat belt and a bag of prosthetic feet in the trunk. In the episode, Cat says her brother is \"pretty weird.\" She also mentions that he has a turtle with \"special\" problems.\n\n===Ryder Daniels===\nRyder Daniels (portrayed by [[Ryan Rottman]]) is a male student at Hollywood Arts who dated Tori for a short time. He is in the episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep20|Beggin' on Your Knees]]\" where Tori found out from her friends that he uses girls to get good grades and then soon after breaks up with them. Tori then humiliates him in front of the whole school by singing \"Beggin' on Your Knees\" to him.\n\n===Hayley Ferguson===\nHayley Ferguson (portrayed by [[Jillian Clare]]) is a girl who competed against Cat and Jade in a karaoke contest with her friend Tara Ganz in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep13|Freak The Freak Out]]\". They won the contest against Jade and Cat because her father is the owner of the Karaoke Dokie club and the judge of the karaoke contest. Before the contest, she started flirting with Beck which started a feud between her and Jade. She has a very mean and snobbish attitude, especially toward Jade. Hayley and Tara were easily defeated when Tori performed her new song, \"Freak the Freak Out\" under the disguise of Louise Nordoff, and after she and Tara lost the bet to Tori, was forced to \"babysit\" Trina, who had recently gotten her wisdom teeth removed and made it hard to take care of her. David saw the antics of them trying to restrain Trina when he got home and told Holly to get back into the car.\n\n===Tara Ganz===\nTara Ganz (portrayed by Jamie Snow) is a girl who competed against Cat and Jade in a karaoke contest with her friend Hayley Ferguson in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep13|Freak The Freak Out]]\". Before the contest, she flirted with Andre. Tara also appears in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep43|Tori Goes Platinum]]\", in which she tried out for a contest but lost.\n\n===Principal Helen===\n[[Head teacher|Principal]] Helen Dubois<ref>Last name revealed as \"Dubois\" in ''[[Drake & Josh: Really Big Shrimp]]''.</ref> (portrayed by [[Yvette Nicole Brown]]) is the current principal of Hollywood Arts. She only appears in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep26|Helen Back Again]]\". All students had to reaudition for her, and the least worthy students would be kicked out of Hollywood Arts. Due to Helen's unnamed assistant mixing up Tori with Trina, Tori had to come up with a plan that involved Robbie dressing up as a robber where he would be beaten up by Trina using her karate skills. After that plan worked, Helen allowed Trina to stay at Hollywood Arts.\n\nIt has been mentioned by Dan Schneider that she would have been a recurring character if the show had not stopped production.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n'''Note''': Helen was originally a character on ''[[Drake & Josh]]'', and her role on that series is referenced in ''Victorious'' when she says that she had previously managed the Premiere movie theater in San Diego. Even though Helen is from ''Drake & Josh'', Tori mentions in the episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep27|Who Did It to Trina?]]\" that ''Drake & Josh'' is a television show.\n\nHelen also made an appearance in ''[[Game Shakers]]'', as a television show host.\n\n===Mamaw===\nMamaw (portrayed by [[Ren\u00e9e Taylor]]) is Robbie's grandmother who has a strong dislike of Cat; she only appeared in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep4|The Birthweek Song]]\". She lives with her husband Maury. She is very computer illiterate and constantly has to ask Robbie for help to the point where he is annoyed and convinces her that the internet has been canceled. The role mirrors Taylor's previous role as Sylvia Fine in ''[[The Nanny]]'', such as encouraging her grandchild to have a successful love life, a loud voice, and even a loud, unseen husband whose name is Morty. Her dislike for Cat stems from her dyeing her hair a bright, artificial shade of red; she specifically says that \"a girl doesn't dye her hair that color unless she has psychological problems!\".\n\n===Vice Principal Dickers===\nDickers (portrayed by [[Rob Riggle]]) is the [[vice principal]] of Hollywood Arts, who appears in \"The Breakfast Bunch\". He is the one who gave detention to Tori and the gang after they end up late in class. Dickers is also very strict and constantly yells at the gang when they talk to him, even to apologize.\n\nHis role is based on [[Paul Gleason]]'s character Richard Vernon, the vice principal in ''[[The Breakfast Club]]''.\n\n===Mona Patterson===\nMona Patterson (portrayed by [[Shirley Jones]]) is one of Cat's favorite actresses. She appears in \"Car, Rain, and Fire\". Patterson is best known for her role in a 1960s television show titled ''I Married My Mom''. Thinking that Patterson had died, Cat, Tori, and Jade go on a road trip to the actress' house in San Diego to honor her and leave a candle on her doorstep. However, they discover that Patterson is not dead but was cast in a new television show titled ''The Dead'', in which she plays [[David Schwimmer]]'s wife. Mona's reaction toward Cat, Tori, and Jade were very unwelcoming, to the point that Mona took out a water gun and sprayed them away from her property, even though they were already wet from the rain. Her house caught on fire because of Cat's candle, which was left on the front porch. Patterson was rushed to a hospital where she was resting very uncomfortably. The reporter covering this incident also mentioned that Mona had muttered something about a \"cat with red hair.\" When Tori and Cat found out, Cat is shocked and Tori gives Cat a gesture to never speak of this to anyone.\n\n===Hope Quincy===\nHope Quincy (portrayed by [[Meagan Holder]]) is a girl who dated Andre in the \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep36|Andre's Horrible Girl]]\".

She also gets knocked out as she tries to save her presents when an earthquake hits.\n\n===Mason Thornesmith===\nMason Thornesmith ([[Charles Shaughnessy]]) is the head of an unnamed record company and the producer of the Platinum Music Awards. He appears in the episodes \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep43|Tori Goes Platinum]]\" and \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep53|Robbie Sells Rex]]\".\n\nHe tried to make Tori dress outrageously and to act very mean and obnoxious to many people to make hype for her. Mason also threatened to cancel her performance on the Platinum Music Awards if she did not obey him.\n\nHe has a bratty son named Francis who Mason wanted to buy Rex from Robbie for.\n\n===Ponnie/Fawn Lebowitz===\nPonnie (portrayed by [[Jennette McCurdy]]) appears once in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep44|Crazy Ponnie]]\" where she befriends Tori Vega, but Ponnie keeps disappearing from everyone else with Tori, making the other Hollywood Arts students think Tori has gone crazy. She has lunch in the girls' bathroom and tells Tori that she was in the spring showcase with Tori, that she has been going to Hollywood Arts for three years and that she was kicked out because they needed to make room for Tori. In reality, she was expelled because she is completely crazy. According to Sikowitz, her real name is Fawn Lebowitz and that \"she stole things, carried weird stuff in her backpack, and called everyone Debbie.\" She was arrested and taken away. In a twist ending, Tori and Trina were driven home by a cop who turned out to be Ponnie who escaped from the police.\n\n===Moose===\nMoose (portrayed by [[Brandon Jones (actor)|Brandon Jones]]) is a boy who is friends with Beck and is from [[Canada]]. He was first seen in the episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Three Girls and a Moose]]\" when Tori, Cat, and Jade try to win the affection of him. Tori tries to impress him with hockey trivia. Jade tries to impress him with their mutual favorite movie, ''The Scissoring''. Cat tries to impress him by cooking burgers. In the end, Moose then explains that he likes Canadian girls because they like hockey (for real, not pretend), the burgers are much bigger, and are not as weird as \"L.A. girls\". After Cat and Tori sing a song titled \"[[L.A. Boyz (song)|L.A. Boyz]]\", Jade tries to take him to Karaoke Dokie but stops her car and they make out.\n\n===Kojeezy===\nKojeezy (portrayed by [[Kool Kojak]]) is a man who is a music producer at Neutronium Records and is in the episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes|The Bad Roommate]]\". Tori stole Andre's beat and he got mad so Tori invited him to make some lyrics with her so they can sing it for him tomorrow. The next day, they perform their brand new song \"Faster than Boyz\" which Kojeezy likes and will maybe produce and buy. Andre and Tori are thrilled when Kojeezy suddenly states that they have to pass \"The Baby Test\" which is a test to see if the baby will cry (which means won't produce and buy) or smile (which means will produce and buy). The baby ended up crying so Kojeezy won't be producing and buying the song.\n\n===Francis Thornesmith===\nFrancis Thornesmith (portrayed by Cole Jensen) is Mason Thornesmith's 12-year-old only son. He appears in the episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Robbie Sells Rex]]\" when he offers Robbie $2,000 if he can keep Rex. He trades Robbie the $2,000 and his puppet Gonther (voiced by [[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]]) which Robbie hates because he does not bully him as Rex does. Robbie and Tori try to get Rex back by hiring a 12-year-old girl, Rhoda Hellberg, to kiss him which Rhoda does. He enjoys it and throws Rex on the ground which means that he does not care about Rex anymore. He also states that \"I don't need a stupid puppet, I got me a woman!\".\n\n===Rhoda Hellberg===\nRhoda Hellberg (portrayed by [[Mackenzie Smith|Mackenzie Brook Smith]]) is a 12-year-old girl who only appears in the episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Robbie Sells Rex]]\".

Rhoda was hired to kiss Francis Thornesmith so Robbie can get Rex back since he sold it to Francis who gave him his puppet Gunther and $2,000.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Victorious}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Victorious}}\n[[Category:Lists of American sitcom television characters]]\n[[Category:Lists of Nickelodeon television series characters]]\n[[Category:Victorious|Characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Victorious'' characters}}\n{{multiple issues| \n{{Overly detailed|date=July 2011}}\n{{More citations needed|date=July 2011}}\n}}\nThis is a list of characters from the [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] [[sitcom]] '''''[[Victorious]]'''''. The series centers on Tori Vega, a student of Hollywood Arts, who gets into wacky unpredictable situations with her friends.\n\n[[File:Victorious Season 1 Cast Promo Image.jpg|thumb|400px|right| The main characters of ''[[Victorious]]'' (left to right): Rex Powers (Robbie's puppet, voiced by [[Jake Farrow]]), Robbie Shapiro ([[Matt Bennett]]), Cat Valentine ([[Ariana Grande]]), Trina Vega ([[Daniella Monet]]), Tori Vega ([[Victoria Justice]]), Andre Harris ([[Leon Thomas III]]), Jade West ([[Elizabeth Gillies]]) and Beck Oliver ([[Avan Jogia]]).]]\n\n==Main characters==\n\n===Tori Vega===\nTori Vega (portrayed by [[Victoria Justice]]) is the younger sister of Trina Vega and attends Hollywood Arts, a performing arts high school, along with her sister.\n\nWhen Trina, Tori's older sister, experiences an allergic reaction to a Chinese herb to try to make her voice sound better Trina's tongue gets swollen right before a big showcase at school, Tori is volunteered by Andre to take her place, since she knew the how the piece was meant to be performed. Tori performs \"[[Make it Shine]]\" (the ''Victorious'' theme song) and everyone is impressed with her performance, including the principal, who offers her an enrollment to the school. She accepts it and is admitted to Hollywood Arts. Initially feeling out of place at Hollywood Arts, Tori makes new, supportive friends and becomes more comfortable. From there onward, the show details Tori's journey through school as she gets into wacky situations have differences and adventures with her friends. She is one of the favorite students of her teacher, Sikowitz.\n\nShe is depicted as creative, nice, caring, forgiving, responsible, positive, easy-going, and friendly, though she can be sneaky and vindictive, going as low as to manipulate her friends and family (especially Trina), but will always do the right thing in the end. Tori is shown to care for her friends and family a lot and is willing to help them no matter what, even when hesitant to.\n\nTori is friends with Beck Oliver, Cat Valentine, Robbie Shapiro, and is the closest to Andre. She often tries to be nice to Jade and sometimes describes Jade as her friend, even though Jade herself does not. In some episodes, the two seem to be moving towards becoming friends, although most of the time, Jade seems to be \"frenemies\" with Tori.\n\nIn later episodes, Tori is shown to wear glasses when at home and while at school she wears contacts.\n\n===Andre Harris===\nAndre Harris (portrayed by [[Leon Thomas III]]) is Tori's best friend. Andre is an aspiring musician who loves to perform and write his songs. He can play many instruments, including the guitar, [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]], piano, and the [[French horn]], but prefers the keyboard and piano. Andre takes his music seriously and is usually seen playing at all of Tori's performances. He is a talented singer and songwriter, having co-written nearly every song Tori has sung. He also often gets Tori to sing back-up for him at his performances.\n\nAndre is shown to be witty and kind and Tori often relies on him for support in her time of need, and he is always there for her, although she is easily distracted at times. Tori often ask him for help or advice. He also likes to make jokes, but none of the other characters find him humorous.\n\nAndre has [[#Andre's grandmother|a grandmother]] who is mentally unstable. He also has a cousin who works as an actor, and an uncle who is a real estate agent, who once sold a house to [[Kenan Thompson]].\n\nIn \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep29|Jade Gets Crushed]]\", Andre develops feelings for Jade after they work together on a song for a project for one of Andre's classes. Andre hears Jade sing beautifully. At the end of the episode, Andre tells Tori that it seems that he is over Jade, but his former crush on Jade is mentioned again in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep51|Tori Fixes Beck and Jade]]\".\n\n===Robbie Shapiro===\nRobbie Shapiro<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theslap.com/clips/robbie-and-cat-s-bad-news-songs-the-mole?ads=false |title=Victorious - Programma\u2019s - Nickelodeon |website=TheSlap.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref> (portrayed by [[Matt Bennett]]) is one of Tori's friends at Hollywood Arts. He speaks along with a puppet, Rex Powers, whom he and all others speak to as if it were an actual person. Robbie is a skilled [[ventriloquist]], but he was uncredited for his talent until the episode \"Freak the Freak Out\". In the episode, Robbie does not understand why he was referred to as a \"ventriloquist\", which either jokingly indicates that Rex has a mind of his own and is not controlled by Robbie at all or (in a more serious matter) that Robbie suffers a [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic disorder]], therefore considering Rex a real person.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nick.com/shows/victorious/characters/robbie.html |title=Robbie/Matt Bennett (Nickelodeon) |access-date=2011-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105192107/http://www.nick.com/shows/victorious/characters/robbie.html |archive-date=2011-01-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He is said to have had Rex since he was little and the two are almost always seen together. Robbie [[personifies]] Rex, which leads to many an arguments about Rex's true [[sentience]]. He constantly argues that Rex is not a puppet or dummy when told otherwise. Robbie is closest to Rex and affectionate towards him, though Rex ridicules him often.\n\nRobbie is considered extremely nerdy, shy, and socially awkward, but a good, loyal, and honest to a friend and others. Robbie has a great deal of trouble with relationships and attracting girls. Robbie also is in love with Cat Valentine and is proven true in the episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep45|The Blonde Squad]]\" in which Robbie writes and sings the song \"I Think You're Swell\" for her. The song is about what a great person she is, and how they get along so well, and that she is all he thinks about. She, however, does not appear to get the true feelings behind it, though she does appear to greatly enjoy the song. He is also shown to be the only one who knows Cat's full name, Caterina. He does not seem to have a sense of privacy. His only relative who has ever been seen is [[#Mamaw|his grandmother]]. It is revealed that Robbie is intolerant to gluten, otherwise known as [[Celiac Disease]]. It is revealed in \"Wok Star\" Robbie is [[American Jews|Jewish]] because he spent his [[Bar Mitzvah]] money on leather pants and male make-up. He is also mistaken for a girl in a couple of episodes such as \"Locked Up\", in which he is put on the wrong side of the fence in jail in a foreign county.\n\n====Rex Powers====\nRex Powers (physically portrayed by a ventriloquist dummy named Christopher Cane, performed by [[Matt Bennett]], voiced by an uncredited [[Jake Farrow]]<ref>{{cite web |author=Stacey Grant |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2877247/drake-and-josh-victorious-rex-the-puppet-voice-jake-farrow-dan-schneider/ |title=Did You Know This ''Drake & Josh'' Star Voiced Rex The Puppet On Victorious? |work=[[MTV News]] |date=May 5, 2016 |accessdate=2016-08-12}}</ref>) is Robbie's [[alter ego]], who is a [[Ventriloquism|dummy]] that Robbie carries around everywhere. Robbie has had Rex since he was young. Since Robbie is too shy to speak for himself most of the time, he talks as Rex, using him to voice his actual feelings and thoughts. The others treat Rex as a real person, and both Robbie and Rex dislike it when Rex is called a \"dummy\" or \"[[puppet]]\". Rex is obsessed with \"Northridge Girls\", dumb, talentless and 'easy' girls from a [[Northridge, Los Angeles|Los Angeles neighborhood]].\n\nIn \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep14|Rex Dies]]\" he gets sucked into a wind machine and is taken to a hospital, even though he is a dummy. Rex is shown to have a huge crush on Tori and constantly flirts with her, though she is annoyed by his affection. Robbie often turns to Rex for advice and insight, though Rex's advice is almost always off-beat. Rex is sarcastic and mean, especially to Robbie, though it is shown that neither can stay without the other.\n\nIn the first 3 seasons, Rex is always in Robbie's company. In season 4 for unexplained reasons, Robbie is frequently seen without Rex. Part 2 of \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep13|Freak the Freak Out]]\" was the first episode not to feature Rex.\n\nIn 2011, Rex hosted a [[blooper]]s episode of ''Victorious'' titled \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep32|Blooptorious]]\" in which he interviewed cast members and showed [[outtake]]s from the series. In the episode, Rex is named Christopher Cane and is not accompanied by Robbie. As Christopher Cane, he also hosted a 2011 blooper episode of ''[[iCarly]]'' titled \"[[iCarly (season 5)#ep80|iBloop 2: Electric Bloopaloo]]\".\n\nRex later appeared in the 2015 ''[[Game Shakers]]'' episode \"Tiny Pickles\" (Season 1, Episode 5) where he is a truck driver.\n\n===Jade West===\nJade West (portrayed by [[Elizabeth Gillies]]) is a [[frenemy]] of Tori from Hollywood Arts. She has a [[Gothic fashion|gothic]] sense of style\u2014always wearing dark clothes with eyebrow piercings and different colors of streaks in her hair\u2014and is the long-time girlfriend of [[#Beck Oliver|Beck Oliver]]. She is very possessive of her boyfriend and is known to lash out at anyone who she views as a threat to their relationship. She shows very little affection for anyone.\n\nIn the pilot episode, Jade mistakenly believes that Tori is flirting with Beck, so she later pours coffee onto Tori\u2019s head during an acting class. Tori later get even with her by defeating her in an alphabetical improv game and kissing Beck as they were the only two actors remaining in the scene.\n\nJade has been known to take obsession in triumphing over any enemies or rivals she may find, and occasionally has been known to take an interest in bizarre, dark, or unusual things that usually would repulse or frighten other people. She has a fascination with scissors, as she is sometimes seen holding scissors and her locker is decorated with them.\n\nIn \"Ice Cream for Ke$ha\", it is revealed that her childhood was a dark and unhappy one, her favorite play toy being a [[hammer]], and that she had been raised by an unsupportive and similarly emotionless father and a mother she could not emotionally connect with. She is also seen to be an amazing singer and actress, which are the main talents that got her into Hollywood Arts. In the season 1 episode \"Jade Dumps Beck\", it is revealed that they had been dating for nearly two years. However, they break up in the episode \"The Worst Couple\" after non-stop fighting, although it becomes clear that Jade still has feelings for him. After taking some time apart, the two make amends in the episode \"Tori Fixes Beck and Jade\" when Jade sings a song that is implied to be dedicated to Beck, leading them to admit that they have missed each other and get back together.\n\nJade later appeared in the ''[[Sam & Cat]]'' episode \"#TheKillerTunaJump\" where she ends up meeting Sam Puckett and befriending her, whereas Cat had thought that the two girls would kill each other upon first sight due to their similar personalities. It is Sam and Jade's friendship that makes Cat jealous enough to call Freddie Benson to Burbank so that she can flirt with him.\n\n===Cat Valentine===\nCatarina \"Cat\" Valentine (portrayed by [[Ariana Grande]]) is one of Tori's strangest friends from Hollywood Arts. She is fun, energetic, and at times oblivious. In a video on TheSlap, she reveals that her full first name is Catarina but only her grandmother calls her by her full name. It was also revealed by Robbie in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep45|The Blonde Squad]]\" when he yelled \"Catarina Valentine, I will not sit here anymore and listen to you talk bad about yourself!\"<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Blonde Squad|series=Victorious|network=Nickelodeon|airdate=June 30, 2012|season=3|number=12|time=12:50|quote=Catarina Valentine, I will not sit here anymore and listen to you talk bad about yourself! You're adorable!}} (name spelling via subtitles)</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Victorious - Cat's Random Thoughts #1|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3XvHpbbA3g|accessdate=2011-12-07}}</ref> She is relatively friendly and liked by all of the students. She is sweet, naive, bubbly and happy, often unsuspecting of what is going on around her. She has a playful nature and has a very short attention span, so she can easily be distracted with colorful items by the others when they want her out of the way. She can be somewhat of a [[wikt: drama queen|drama queen]] and does not take criticism very well. She often screams ''\"What's that supposed to mean!?\"'' when offended, which is very often and has become her catchphrase.<ref>[http://www.nick.com/shows/victorious/characters/cat.html Cat/Ariana Grande (Nickelodeon)]</ref> Cat often says random and strange things which leaves the others, especially Jade, confused or annoyed.\n \nCat is also an extremely talented singer and actress, as seen in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep13|Freak The Freak Out]]\" where she sings a duet with Jade, and in the crossover episode \"[[iParty with Victorious]]\" where she shows a high vocal range. A running gag of the series is Cat often telling her friends or strangers about [[#Cat's brother|her brother]], who seems to have many unnatural problems, all of which Cat does not seem to find strange or abnormal. She has bright red hair that she dyed to resemble her favorite snack, a [[red velvet cake|red velvet cupcake]]. Andre's nickname for her is \"Little Red\", which she took offense to at first, but then called it \"creative\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theslap.com/clips/cat-s-video-profile |title=Cat's Video Profile |website=TheSlap.com}}</ref> She is occasionally seen carrying stuffed animals. Through the series, she has become ditzier and over the top, with a higher-pitched voice and her abnormal conversations.\n\nIn January 2013 in the episode \"Star-Spangled Tori\", Cat's parents move away to [[Idaho]] to be with her [[mental health|mentally ill]] brother at a [[mental institution]] for between 6 months and 2 years where the doctors can make sure he gets lots of mental relaxation and cannot escape and keep him institutionalized. Their parents wanted her to live with her and her brother's Uncle Walter and Aunt Pearl, while they are in Idaho but according to Cat, they are very strict and mean. They do not like her red hair, they only eat vegetables, they said she cannot have unlimited texting, and they will not let her flush the toilet unless it is \"necessary\". This caused Cat to run away and take refuge in the attic of Hollywood Arts' BlackBox theater, where her living habits were discovered by Robbie and Jade. After Jade called up Cat's parents, Cat goes to live with her grandmother \u2013 who turned out to be living in Venice, California and not Venice, Italy as Cat had initially thought \u2013 until her parents and brother return. She refers to her grandmother as \"Nona\".\n\nWhen ''Victorious'' airs its final season, Cat becomes a co-lead character on the crossover spin-off ''[[Sam & Cat]]'', a sitcom that began airing in 2013 and concluded in 2014. Sam and Cat become roommates when Cat's Nona (portrayed by [[Maree Cheatham]]) goes to live in Elderly Acres. Sam and Cat previously met each other in the 2011 ''[[iCarly]]'' crossover episode \"iParty with Victorious\", but neither of them made many contacts. In the spin-off, Sam officially meets Cat after saving her from the garbage truck. The next day, Sam and Cat set up a [[babysitting]] service to raise some extra cash after watching some kids. Sam and Cat's home is stated to be \"the poshest apartment in the building\".\n\n===Beck Oliver===\nBeck Oliver (portrayed by [[Avan Jogia]]) is Jade's boyfriend. He has been together with Jade for over two years and, unlike everyone else, is completely unafraid of her (even laughing when Andre admitted to being scared of her) and often likes to tease and make her jealous because of her reactions, which he finds amusing. Beck seems to be the only one who can calm Jade down when she becomes angry and has some control over her as seen throughout the series.\n\nBeck is seen as soft-spoken, friendly, laid back, modest, open and caring. Although he is shown to get annoyed and even lose his temper, usually by Robbie or Trina, he is normally calm and collected. Because of his good looks and personality, he is possibly the most popular guy at Hollywood Arts and attracts almost all females and girls like Trina, sometimes even older women. He seems to be aware of the effect he has on girls, sometimes using his looks to his advantage. He and Andre are close friends. His school locker is transparent, which is his way of saying that he has no secrets, which is revealed to Tori when she was attempting to find a decorative idea for her locker. He lives in a trailer that is parked in his parents' driveway, being told if he lived with them then he would have to go by their rules, and he stated \"my roof, my rules\". In the season 2 premiere, Jade mentions that Beck is Canadian.\n\nIt is shown in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep21|Beck Falls For Tori]]\" and \"[[iParty with Victorious]]\" that Beck has never felt true terror nor has he ever been scared by anything, a fact backed up by Jade who calls him \"unscareable\". He usually tries to keep peace in the group and hold everyone together. Beck breaks up with Jade in the season 3 episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep35|The Worst Couple]]\" after getting tired of constantly fighting with her. In the episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep43|Tori Goes Platinum]]\" Beck tries to kiss Tori, revealing that he has romantic feelings for her, but she rejects him because she viewed it as a betrayal to Jade to kiss her ex-boyfriend. In the episode, [[List of Victorious episodes#ep51|Tori Fixes Beck and Jade]], Beck tries dating a girl named Meredith, who wants to do anything he wants, causing him to realize how he prefers dating a girl who \"fights back\" and \"has a big mouth\" because it is not easy and that an easy relationship to him is \"boring\". This causes him to see how much he misses being with Jade and that he loves her, bringing the two back together again. Following this, their relationship is stronger and more stable.\n\nIn ''[[Sam & Cat]]'', Jade says that the two are still in a relationship.\n\n===Trina Vega===\nTrina Vega (portrayed by [[Daniella Monet]]) is Tori's older sister, who also attends Hollywood Arts. Trina's allergic reaction to a Chinese herb gargle in the [[Television pilot|pilot]] episode forces Tori to fill in for her in the school's big showcase, which leads to Tori being offered admission to Hollywood Arts.\n\nTrina believes that acting and singing is her destiny, and is oblivious to her actual lack of any talent. The only reason Trina is in Hollywood Arts is that Sikowitz had a coconut-induced hallucination during Trina's audition, which turned her performance into a psychedelic extravaganza for him, and every other judge was out at the time. Trina is quite selfish and shallow most of the time, and is portrayed as being extremely difficult to deal with, sometimes even being called a \"monster\" in \"Freak the Freak Out.\" However, before she was admitted to Hollywood Arts, she was depicted at her audition as a shy, sweet, nerdy girl.\n\nDespite Trina's shallow personality, she can be concerned about her sister when she wants to be and it is shown that she does look out for Tori a lot. Later in the series, she showed some minor character growth, such as in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep25|Locked Up!]]\" when she tries to get Tori out of a Yerbanian prison when she was accused of \"attacking\" the unnamed Yerbanian Chancellor and showed genuine concern for her well being. Other examples of this are evidenced in the episodes \"Tori the Zombie\", \"Beggin' On Your Knees\", and \"Tori Gets Stuck\".\n\nTrina also seems to have bad luck, as she often gets hurt. Some examples include: Falling from the ceiling, a wall falling on her, getting hit in the face with flour, and getting hit with a box of shoes.\n\nBy the final episode \"Victori-yes\", Trina has landed a role on a Spanish-language television show titled ''Divertisimo'', which she boasts is \"a high-quality television show with top-notch acting\". She is eventually shown portraying a giant piece of cheese being tormented by children in mouse costumes.\n\n==Recurring characters==\n\n===Sinjin===\nSinjin Van Cleef<ref name=VanCleef>Van Cleef - Sinjin's last name is shown on his [http://www.theslap.com/profiles/sinjin-van-cleef profile on TheSlap]</ref> (portrayed by [[Michael Eric Reid]]) is a strange and questionable student at Hollywood Arts. He is nerdy, disturbing, and very weird, often considered stranger than even Robbie or Cat; his locker has his chewed up food on it and he also likes to collect the teeth of past presidents' relatives. He is usually used as a fake date or bribed to fake date someone, including Cat. He usually interrupts conversations with weird comments that do not make sense. He is a fan of [[disco]] music and has a huge crush on Tori and Jade, although both show more irritation than the interest in his presence. Sinjin is skilled in the background work on the school's productions and performances. He is shown to be proficient with audio, lighting, and making props, and is the apparent leader of the technical team. He appears in almost every episode of the series, except for \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep3|Stage Fighting]]\",\" \"[[List of Victorious episodes#12|Cat's New Boyfriend]],\" \"[[List of Victorious episodes#19|Sleepover at Sikowitz's]],\" \"[[List of Victorious episodes#25|Locked Up!]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#28|Tori Tortures Teacher]], \"[[List of Victorious episodes#29|Jade Gets Crushed]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#30|Terror on Cupcake Street]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#33|The Breakfast Bunch]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#36|Andre's Horrible Girl]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#37|Car, Rain and Fire]]\" and \"[[List of Victorious episodes#40|Driving Tori Crazy]]\". It is revealed in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#31|A Christmas Tori]]\" that he has a sister named Courtney (played by Dominique Grund) who also attends Hollywood Arts.\n\n===Sikowitz===\nErwin Sikowitz<ref name=Sikowitz>Erwin - Sikowitz's first name is shown on his [http://www.theslap.com/profiles/erwin-sikowitz profile on TheSlap]</ref> (pronounced \"psycho-wits\") (portrayed by [[Eric Lange]]) is the [[hippie]]-like acting teacher at Hollywood Arts. His habits might be interpreted as weird and his methods are shown to be often very strange (such as throwing a ball at Cat while she was performing), but at times very effective. He often walks around barefoot, which is the supposed trait of the hippies. He likes to enter the class through a window and is almost always seen drinking from coconut because, as Jade says, \"the milk gives him visions\". Tori gave him two dollars on her first day at Hollywood Arts, thinking he was homeless. He also gave Cat, Jade, Beck, Andre, and Robbie permission to start a fake ping-pong team to make money and have a fancy dinner. He claims to be 34 years old in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#15|The Diddly-Bops]]\".\n\nHe appears in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#1|Pilot]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#2|The Bird Scene]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#10|Beck's Big Break]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#11|The Great Ping Pong Scam]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Cat's New Boyfriend]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Freak The Freak Out]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Rex Dies]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|The Diddly-Bops]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#19|Sleepover at Sikowitz's]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#21|Beck Falls for Tori]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#23|Tori Gets Stuck]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#24|Prom Wrecker]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#25|Locked Up!]]\", \"[[iParty with Victorious]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#26|Helen Back Again]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Tori Tortures Teacher]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Terror on Cupcake Street]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|A Christmas Tori]]\", [[List of Victorious episodes#34|The Gorilla Club]], [[List of Victorious episodes#38|Tori & Jade's Playdate]], [[List of Victorious episodes#39|April Fools Blank]], [[List of Victorious episodes#41|How Trina Got In]], [[List of Victorious episodes#42-43|Tori Goes Platinum (parts 1-2)]], [[List of Victorious episodes#44|Crazy Ponnie]], [[List of Victorious episodes#52|Cell Block]], [[List of Victorious episodes#55|Robbie Sells Rex]], [[List of Victorious episodes#57|Star Spangled Tori]] and [[List of Victorious episodes#58|Victori-yes]].\n\n\"[[List of Victorious episodes#1|Pilot]]\" is the only episode where he is referred to as Mr. Sikowitz. In all other episodes, he is just called Sikowitz. In \"[[List of Victorious episodes#19|Sleepover at Sikowitz's]]\", it is revealed that he has a nephew named Jason, who went out on a date with Cat, although the results are not mentioned. His catchphrase is \"Good [[Gandhi]]!\" As strange as Sikowitz is, he is the favorite teacher of Tori, Cat, Jade, Beck, Andre, and Robbie, and is very open and comfortable with them, to the point he says that he is their friend in a few episodes.\n\nSikowitz is regularly seen drinking from a coconut (he once drank fermented coconut milk and had visions during Trina's audition). In one episode when Tori goes to him asking for help, he is hanging upside down from the ceiling, and in another, he stored his grandmother in the corner before slinging her over his shoulder and taking her to the hospital. He has an extremely strange house as revealed in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#19|Sleepover at Sikowitz's]]\". At the Hollywood Arts Prom, he brought a pile of tires, matches and a bottle of fuel, thinking for unknown reasons that they were going to have a bonfire of tires.\n\nSikowitz appeared in the ''[[Sam & Cat]]'' episode \"#MommaGoomer.\" He is seen teaching his students about backward acting when Sam and Cat come in. Sikowitz scolds Cat for showing up very late with the class being almost over. When the bell rings, Sam and Cat tell Sikowitz that they would like to use his classroom for a charity called \"The Salvation Goomers\" (which was a cover-up for Goomer claiming to his mother that he is a history teacher). During Goomer's teaching of history to Sam, Cat, Dice, Goomer's mom, and the local shruggers,{{clarify|date=December 2017}} Sikowitz comes in stating that he had gone to Charityosity.com where he found nothing about \"The Salvation Goomers.\" After Goomer confessed to his mother that he is an [[Mixed martial artist|MMA]] Fighter, Sikowitz uses an electric shaver to get the fake pit hair off of Dice's armpits claiming that he grew them too soon. In the same series, Cat has a picture of Sikowitz near her bed in the room that she shares with Sam.\n\n===Lane===\nLane Alexander (portrayed by [[Lane Napper]]) is the [[School counselor|guidance counselor]] for Hollywood Arts. Lane is a good guidance counselor, and often helps students with their problems and resolves their arguments, but sometimes can be reluctant at times, asking students \"Why Me?\". He is usually the one making the big announcements at school. He appears to either hate dry skin or is obsessed with lotion (as seen in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#17|The Wood]]\"), as he can be seen frequently applying lotion to his hands. He has a nephew named Devon, as seen in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#15|The Diddly-Bops]]\". Lane is the one who made a reality television series, ''The Wood'', leave the school because it was becoming an issue with the students and disrupting the learning environment.\n\nHe tends to be a bit extreme in his dealings such as when he issued a two-week detention to Tori for a supposed accidental hit on Jade during a stage fighting practice, made Robbie and Trina cover for Festus after accidentally injuring him, and having Tori and Jade take Festus home after unknowingly wrecking his car which was similar to one of the janitors' car.\n\nHe appears in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#1|Pilot]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#2|The Bird Scene]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#3|Stage Fighting]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#6|Tori The Zombie]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#7|Robarazzi]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#10|Beck's Big Break]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#11|The Great Ping Pong Scam]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#12|Cat's New Boyfriend]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#15|The Diddly Bops]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#17|The Wood]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#23|Tori Gets Stuck]]\", \"[[iParty With Victorious]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#26|Helen Back Again]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#27|Who Did It to Trina?]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#28|Tori Tortures Teacher]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#29|Jade Gets Crushed]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#35|The Worst Couple]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#41|How Trina Got In]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#43|Crazy Ponnie]]\" and \"[[List of Victorious episodes#51|One Thousand Berry Balls]]\".\n\nAs revealed on his profile on TheSlap.com, Lane's last name is Alexander.\n\n===David and Holly Vega===\nDavid and Holly Vega (portrayed by [[Jim Pirri]] and Jennifer Carta) are the parents of Tori and Trina. David works as a [[police officer]] while Holly's job was never revealed.\n\nThey appear in \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Pilot]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|The Birthweek Song]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Sleepover at Sikowitz's]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Locked Up]]\", and \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Jade Gets Crushed]]\" though their mother appeared in \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Robarazzi]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|A Film by Dale Squires]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Helen Back Again]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Driving Tori Crazy]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Tori Goes Platinum]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Crazy Ponnie]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Cell Block]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes|The Bad Roommate]]\" and \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Star Spangled-Tori]]\", and their dad appears in \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Freak the Freak Out]]\" and \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Car, Rain and Fire]]\".\n\nThey are shown to be caring and loving parents, but when their daughters get too out of control, they tend to stay out of it and go off doing something else, which is indicating that they are very unhelpful parents. For example, in \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Freak the Freak Out]]\", Trina gets her wisdom teeth removed and their parents decide to go out of town so they would not have to take care of her, knowing she would get violent. Tori likes to point out at times that her father is a cop, usually to Sinjin, but also to others, especially if someone is annoying her. David Vega works as with LAPD and is originally from Puerto Rico.\n\n===Andre's grandmother===\nCharlotte Harris<ref name=CharlotteHarris>Charlotte Harris - First name \"Charlotte\" revealed in a video on TheSlap.com. \"Mrs. Harris\" used by many characters in various episodes. Credited as \"Andre's grandmother\".</ref> (portrayed by Marilyn Harris) is Andre's grandmother. She is mentally unstable and often paranoid about things. She is shown to be afraid of nearly everything, including various sensible objects such as clocks and mirrors. In the episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes#9|Wi-Fi in the Sky]]\" she gets scared after seeing her reflection in a mirror and screams \"Andre, there's another 'me' on the wall!\". When she is greeted by new people, she hides behind anything she can find, while simultaneously shouting out \"I don't know you!\" Andre tells Tori in the \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Pilot]]\" episode that her coming to see Trina perform \"Make it Shine\" is the first time in six years that she has left her house. He also mentions in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#8|Survival of the Hottest]]\" that before she lost her mind, she used to tell him, \"Andre, no matter how bad things get, you can always make it better by singing a song\". She often snaps at Andre and is possibly the only way she communicates with anyone. In \"[[List of Victorious episodes#9|Wi-Fi in the Sky]],\" she yells at Andre for \"talking to himself\" when he was in reality video chatting with Tori, Cat, and Beck then freaks out and punches Andre's computer. During an interview on a video on TheSlap.com in which Andre read off her crazy text messages, her first name is revealed to be Charlotte. She has appeared in \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Pilot]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#9|Wi-Fi in the Sky]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#19|Sleepover At Sikowitz's]]\", \"[[iParty With Victorious]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#40|Driving Tori Crazy]]\", \"[[List of Victorious episodes#50|Tori Fixes Beck and Jade]]\" and \"[[List of Victorious episodes#53|The Bad Roommate]]\".\n\n===Mrs. Lee===\nMrs. Lee (portrayed by Susan Chuang) is the owner of Tori's favorite Chinese restaurant Wok Star, who volunteers to pay to produce Jade's play. But things get complicated when Mrs. Lee makes drastic changes to the script and wants to put her daughter, Daisy, in the play. Mrs. Lee returns in the episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep36|Andre's Horrible Girl]]\", now operating a Sushi bar called '''Nozu''' after Wok Star burns down. This prompts Tori to ask if she is Chinese or Japanese, which she answers with a smack to Tori's head.\n\nShe later appears in the third-season episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep41|How Trina Got In]]\", making Tori and Robbie chop a pile of squid after they cannot pay their bill. After the bill was worked off, Robbie accidentally breaks some dishes, causing Mrs. Lee to have Robbie work off the damages with one of the jobs being rubbing her chef Kwakoo's feet.\n\nShe also appeared in the fourth-season episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep47|The Hambone King]]\" where she praises Robbie's [[hamboning]] skills.\n\n===Kwakoo===\nKwakoo (portrayed by N\u00e9e L\u00e9au) is a worker at Nozu that works for Mrs. Lee as a [[chef]] as seen in \"How Trina Got In.\"\n\nIn \"The Hambone King,\" Kwakoo asked Robbie for his autograph after seeing Robbie's hambone video.\n\n===Festus===\nFestus (portrayed by Marco Aiello) is the proprietor of The Grub Truck, a [[food truck]] located at the school.

He either has or may have a habit of lying to customers.\n\nIn \"Beck's Big Break\" when Tori asked for a sandwich he said he only served burritos but gave her a sandwich anyway. In the same episode, he is also shown to scream at people who are not there when in the Grub Truck.\n\nIn \"The Wood\", he was injured by Robbie and Trina and they were forced by Lane to replace him for a short time. Tori and Jade accidentally destroyed his car in the same episode upon mistaken for one of the cars belonging to one of Hollywood Arts' janitors and had to take him home in a wheelbarrow.\n\nIn \"Locked Up!\", he tells Tori about his home country Yerba and how she and her friends could stay there if they perform a song every day and the country would pay for the hotel rooms. It is also revealed that he has a brother named Sgrodis (portrayed by [[Winston Story]]) who is the hotel manager.\n\n===Burf===\nBurf (portrayed by Darsan Solomon) is a student who goes to Hollywood Arts and always hangs out with Sinjin. He is first seen in the episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes#38|Tori & Jade's Playdate]]\", spying on Tori and Jade for Sikowitz so they cannot escape Nozu. He then appears in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#40|Driving Tori Crazy]]\" when Cat offers him a bag of rags. He also appears in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#45|The Blonde Squad]]\", and in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#42|Tori Goes Platinum]]\", when he sends in a video of himself singing for a contest.

Though he is rarely seen in the show, he is mentioned in many episodes. He appears in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep1|Pilot]]\" and \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep26|Helen Back Again]]\". In \"Helen Back Again\", he resigns as principal after announcing his engagement to a Tahitian woman and plans to move to Tahiti. He is also seen in the episode \"How Trina Got In,\" where he appears in the flashbacks of Andre, Jade, Beck, and Sikowitz.\n\n===Cat's brother<!--Per the Manual of Style, \"brother\" needs to be uncapitalized, as it is not a proper noun.-->===\nCat frequently mentions her brother, whose name is never revealed. He is often mentioned as a focal point of bizarre off-screen antics, which either happen to him or which he causes himself. Examples include eating Cat's charm bracelet, getting stabbed in Japan, biting Cat on the foot, falling from a terrace onto a shuttle bus, being shot by a clown, painting his body purple for a job interview, and somehow procuring twelve gallons of real blood for Jade's play. On TheSlap, Cat revealed he is not allowed outside by himself and that he plays \"hide and seek\" with the police. His favorite flavor of ice cream is \"Funky Nut Blast\", as revealed in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep22|Ice Cream for Ke$ha]]\". In \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep37|Car, Rain, and Fire]]\", Tori, Cat, and Jade borrow Cat's brother's car which had unusual features such as a coverless roof, rope for a seat belt and a bag of prosthetic feet in the trunk. In the episode, Cat says her brother is \"pretty weird.\" She also mentions that he has a turtle with \"special\" problems.\n\n===Ryder Daniels===\nRyder Daniels (portrayed by [[Ryan Rottman]]) is a male student at Hollywood Arts who dated Tori for a short time. He is in the episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep20|Beggin' on Your Knees]]\" where Tori found out from her friends that he uses girls to get good grades and then soon after breaks up with them. Tori then humiliates him in front of the whole school by singing \"Beggin' on Your Knees\" to him.\n\n===Hayley Ferguson===\nHayley Ferguson (portrayed by [[Jillian Clare]]) is a girl who competed against Cat and Jade in a karaoke contest with her friend Tara Ganz in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep13|Freak The Freak Out]]\". They won the contest against Jade and Cat because her father is the owner of the Karaoke Dokie club and the judge of the karaoke contest. Before the contest, she started flirting with Beck which started a feud between her and Jade. She has a very mean and snobbish attitude, especially toward Jade. Hayley and Tara were easily defeated when Tori performed her new song, \"Freak the Freak Out\" under the disguise of Louise Nordoff, and after she and Tara lost the bet to Tori, was forced to \"babysit\" Trina, who had recently gotten her wisdom teeth removed and made it hard to take care of her. David saw the antics of them trying to restrain Trina when he got home and told Holly to get back into the car.\n\n===Tara Ganz===\nTara Ganz (portrayed by Jamie Snow) is a girl who competed against Cat and Jade in a karaoke contest with her friend Hayley Ferguson in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep13|Freak The Freak Out]]\". Before the contest, she flirted with Andre. Tara also appears in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep43|Tori Goes Platinum]]\", in which she tried out for a contest but lost.\n\n===Principal Helen===\n[[Head teacher|Principal]] Helen Dubois<ref>Last name revealed as \"Dubois\" in ''[[Drake & Josh: Really Big Shrimp]]''.</ref> (portrayed by [[Yvette Nicole Brown]]) is the current principal of Hollywood Arts. She only appears in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep26|Helen Back Again]]\". All students had to reaudition for her, and the least worthy students would be kicked out of Hollywood Arts. Due to Helen's unnamed assistant mixing up Tori with Trina, Tori had to come up with a plan that involved Robbie dressing up as a robber where he would be beaten up by Trina using her karate skills. After that plan worked, Helen allowed Trina to stay at Hollywood Arts.\n\nIt has been mentioned by Dan Schneider that she would have been a recurring character if the show had not stopped production.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n'''Note''': Helen was originally a character on ''[[Drake & Josh]]'', and her role on that series is referenced in ''Victorious'' when she says that she had previously managed the Premiere movie theater in San Diego. Even though Helen is from ''Drake & Josh'', Tori mentions in the episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep27|Who Did It to Trina?]]\" that ''Drake & Josh'' is a television show.\n\nHelen also made an appearance in ''[[Game Shakers]]'', as a television show host.\n\n===Mamaw===\nMamaw (portrayed by [[Ren\u00e9e Taylor]]) is Robbie's grandmother who has a strong dislike of Cat; she only appeared in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep4|The Birthweek Song]]\". She lives with her husband Maury. She is very computer illiterate and constantly has to ask Robbie for help to the point where he is annoyed and convinces her that the internet has been canceled. The role mirrors Taylor's previous role as Sylvia Fine in ''[[The Nanny]]'', such as encouraging her grandchild to have a successful love life, a loud voice, and even a loud, unseen husband whose name is Morty. Her dislike for Cat stems from her dyeing her hair a bright, artificial shade of red; she specifically says that \"a girl doesn't dye her hair that color unless she has psychological problems!\".\n\n===Vice Principal Dickers===\nDickers (portrayed by [[Rob Riggle]]) is the [[vice principal]] of Hollywood Arts, who appears in \"The Breakfast Bunch\". He is the one who gave detention to Tori and the gang after they end up late in class. Dickers is also very strict and constantly yells at the gang when they talk to him, even to apologize.\n\nHis role is based on [[Paul Gleason]]'s character Richard Vernon, the vice principal in ''[[The Breakfast Club]]''.\n\n===Mona Patterson===\nMona Patterson (portrayed by [[Shirley Jones]]) is one of Cat's favorite actresses. She appears in \"Car, Rain, and Fire\". Patterson is best known for her role in a 1960s television show titled ''I Married My Mom''. Thinking that Patterson had died, Cat, Tori, and Jade go on a road trip to the actress' house in San Diego to honor her and leave a candle on her doorstep. However, they discover that Patterson is not dead but was cast in a new television show titled ''The Dead'', in which she plays [[David Schwimmer]]'s wife. Mona's reaction toward Cat, Tori, and Jade were very unwelcoming, to the point that Mona took out a water gun and sprayed them away from her property, even though they were already wet from the rain. Her house caught on fire because of Cat's candle, which was left on the front porch. Patterson was rushed to a hospital where she was resting very uncomfortably. The reporter covering this incident also mentioned that Mona had muttered something about a \"cat with red hair.\" When Tori and Cat found out, Cat is shocked and Tori gives Cat a gesture to never speak of this to anyone.\n\n===Hope Quincy===\nHope Quincy (portrayed by [[Meagan Holder]]) is a girl who dated Andre in the \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep36|Andre's Horrible Girl]]\". She is very pushy and controlling to Andre, often forcing him to do things such as wear the clothes she wants him to wear. Andre and Tori perform the song, \"Countdown, at her birthday party, which is held at Nozu. She throws a fit when there is no spicy tuna at her party. She also gets knocked out as she tries to save her presents when an earthquake hits.\n\n===Mason Thornesmith===\nMason Thornesmith ([[Charles Shaughnessy]]) is the head of an unnamed record company and the producer of the Platinum Music Awards. He appears in the episodes \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep43|Tori Goes Platinum]]\" and \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep53|Robbie Sells Rex]]\".\n\nHe tried to make Tori dress outrageously and to act very mean and obnoxious to many people to make hype for her. Mason also threatened to cancel her performance on the Platinum Music Awards if she did not obey him.\n\nHe has a bratty son named Francis who Mason wanted to buy Rex from Robbie for.\n\n===Ponnie/Fawn Lebowitz===\nPonnie (portrayed by [[Jennette McCurdy]]) appears once in \"[[List of Victorious episodes#ep44|Crazy Ponnie]]\" where she befriends Tori Vega, but Ponnie keeps disappearing from everyone else with Tori, making the other Hollywood Arts students think Tori has gone crazy. She has lunch in the girls' bathroom and tells Tori that she was in the spring showcase with Tori, that she has been going to Hollywood Arts for three years and that she was kicked out because they needed to make room for Tori. In reality, she was expelled because she is completely crazy. According to Sikowitz, her real name is Fawn Lebowitz and that \"she stole things, carried weird stuff in her backpack, and called everyone Debbie.\" She was arrested and taken away. In a twist ending, Tori and Trina were driven home by a cop who turned out to be Ponnie who escaped from the police.\n\n===Moose===\nMoose (portrayed by [[Brandon Jones (actor)|Brandon Jones]]) is a boy who is friends with Beck and is from [[Canada]]. He was first seen in the episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Three Girls and a Moose]]\" when Tori, Cat, and Jade try to win the affection of him. Tori tries to impress him with hockey trivia. Jade tries to impress him with their mutual favorite movie, ''The Scissoring''. Cat tries to impress him by cooking burgers. In the end, Moose then explains that he likes Canadian girls because they like hockey (for real, not pretend), the burgers are much bigger, and are not as weird as \"L.A. girls\". After Cat and Tori sing a song titled \"[[L.A. Boyz (song)|L.A. Boyz]]\", Jade tries to take him to Karaoke Dokie but stops her car and they make out.\n\n===Kojeezy===\nKojeezy (portrayed by [[Kool Kojak]]) is a man who is a music producer at Neutronium Records and is in the episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes|The Bad Roommate]]\". Tori stole Andre's beat and he got mad so Tori invited him to make some lyrics with her so they can sing it for him tomorrow. The next day, they perform their brand new song \"Faster than Boyz\" which Kojeezy likes and will maybe produce and buy. Andre and Tori are thrilled when Kojeezy suddenly states that they have to pass \"The Baby Test\" which is a test to see if the baby will cry (which means won't produce and buy) or smile (which means will produce and buy). The baby ended up crying so Kojeezy won't be producing and buying the song.\n\n===Francis Thornesmith===\nFrancis Thornesmith (portrayed by Cole Jensen) is Mason Thornesmith's 12-year-old only son. He appears in the episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Robbie Sells Rex]]\" when he offers Robbie $2,000 if he can keep Rex. He trades Robbie the $2,000 and his puppet Gonther (voiced by [[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]]) which Robbie hates because he does not bully him as Rex does. Robbie and Tori try to get Rex back by hiring a 12-year-old girl, Rhoda Hellberg, to kiss him which Rhoda does. He enjoys it and throws Rex on the ground which means that he does not care about Rex anymore. He also states that \"I don't need a stupid puppet, I got me a woman!\".\n\n===Rhoda Hellberg===\nRhoda Hellberg (portrayed by [[Mackenzie Smith|Mackenzie Brook Smith]]) is a 12-year-old girl who only appears in the episode \"[[List of Victorious episodes|Robbie Sells Rex]]\". Her mother took her to Hollywood Arts so Rhoda can apologize to Sikowitz for hitting him with an egg while in the shower. She has an attitude and attacked Tori after Mrs. Hellberg's latest complaint towards Sikowitz had involved the police visiting the Hellberg house after Rhoda's latest egg attack on Sikowitz. Rhoda was hired to kiss Francis Thornesmith so Robbie can get Rex back since he sold it to Francis who gave him his puppet Gunther and $2,000.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Victorious}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Victorious}}\n[[Category:Lists of American sitcom television characters]]\n[[Category:Lists of Nickelodeon television series characters]]\n[[Category:Victorious|Characters]]\n", "name_user": "23.28.185.70", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eRobbie Shapiro:Added content)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Victorious_characters"}
{"title_page": "Carol Sutton (artist)", "text_new": "'''Carol Lorraine Sutton''' (born September 3, 1945) is a multidisciplinary artist born in Norfolk, Virginia, USA and now living in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  She is an award-winning painter whose works on canvas and paper have been shown in 32 solo exhibits as well as being included in 94 group shows. Her work, which ranges from complete abstraction to the use of organic and architectural images, relates to the formalist ideas of [[Clement Greenberg]] and is noted for the use of color.<ref>{{cite book|title=Women Artists News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1y0yAQAAIAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Midmarch Associates|page=17}}</ref>  Some of Sutton paintings have been related to [[ontology]].<ref>James Clark The Problem of Fundamental Ontology, Volume III, Limits Book Company, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Published 1973</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nThe daughter of Robert William Sutton, a designer and manufacturer of marine instruments and Nancy Chester Sustare, artist and homemaker, Carol spent her first six years living in a log cabin high on the sand dunes of Chesapeake Bay overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. She won a blue ribbon for her art in the Junior Section at the Sears-Allstate Tidewater Arts Festival. She received two Virginia Museum Fellowships and studied at [[Virginia Commonwealth University|Richmond Professional Institute]] (VCU) in Richmond, earning a BFA in 1967<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.carolsutton.net/text/curriculum_vitae_sutton.html|title=Short Curriculum Vitae of artist Carol Sutton|website=www.carolsutton.net|access-date=2019-12-27}}</ref> along with a Gold Key and Art Achievement Award and a scholarship to attend the 'School of Visual Arts' in New York City.\n\nSutton received two teaching fellowships which allowed her to attend the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]] (UNCG),<ref>Reed Publishing Who's Who in American Art, 1990</ref> where her professors introduced her to the work of [[Morris Louis]] and [[Kenneth Noland]].  In 1969 she graduated with a Masters of Fine Art degree.\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1967, when Sutton was twenty-two, her work entered the Jacob Kainen Collection, of the Smithsonian Museum of American Art with a portfolio of sixteen serigraphs titled 'The Artist As A Young Woman - Picabia'. Thinking that her artistic goals and the materials she used were similar to those of [[Eva Hesse]],  Will Insley, Sutton's professor at UNCG, introduced the two women in 1969 in his New York loft. That year a large scale sculpture she created was purchased by 'Weatherspoon Art Gallery', Greensboro, N.C.\n\nWorking on large sculpture in the isolation of her studio in Greensboro, North Carolina Sutton was offered a solo show of these works at The [[OK Harris Gallery|O.K. Harris Gallery]] in New York. However, she instead moved to Canada and married the sculptor [[Andr\u00e9 Fauteux]] with whom she has two children, Viva-Laura Sutton-Fauteux (1980-2016) and Yale Sutton-Fauteux.\n\nWhile working in Canada, Sutton was awarded Ontario Arts Council grants in  1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, and 1979. She received a bursary and two travel grants from the Canada Council for the Arts between 1983 and 1992.\n\nIn Canada Sutton produced multiple exhibitions across Canada and showed with the Theo Waddington Galleries, and later at Gallery One in Toronto.  In Toronto, Sutton also did sculpture collaborations with contemporary electronic music composers. In Canada Sutton's work received positive reviews from critics Clement Greenberg and [[Karen Wilkin]], and was influenced by the artists [[Anthony Caro]] and [[Helen Frankenthaler]], all of whom regularly came to her Toronto studio. Fauteux introduced Sutton to [[Jack Bush]] in 1974 and has been included in a number of exhibitions related to Bush's influence.\n\nIn 1977, Sutton presented her first Canadian exhibition at the A.C.T. Gallery. In 1978 Sutton held her first New York one-woman show at the William Edward O'Reilly Gallery. In the U.S.A. Sutton's work was noted by critic Kenworth Moffett, the Contemporary Curator of The [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]], who purchased her work 'Alvertie' for their collection and included her in the [[Andr\u00e9 Emmerich]] Gallery touring show, The New Generation: A Curator's Choice.\n\nEight years after she left, Sutton returned to New York to show as an artist, this time as a painter not a sculptor. There she received an [[Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation]] grant.\n\n==Later career==\n\nSutton became known for her large scale abstract acrylic paintings, which she painted with canvas laid directly on the floor.<ref>{{cite book|title=Artmagazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VfrAAAAMAAJ|volume=13, Issues 55-59|year=1981|publisher=Art Magazine, Incorporated|pages=65\u201366}}</ref> Related to the tradition of [[Color Field]] Painting her art has been linked by critics to the art movement called [[Lyrical Abstraction]]. Her smaller paper works often take on unusual structural forms and have widely extended edges, sometimes cut in wave shapes. Sutton was encouraged by critic [[Michael Fried]] whom she met 1n 1986 at [[Triangle Arts Trust|Triangle Artist Workshop]].<ref>Fried, Michael, Triangle Artists' Workshop, published catalog, 1986, Triangle Arts Trust</ref> In 1987 Sutton was invited to participate in the Art Triangle Workshop in Barcelona, her third Triangle workshop. Two years later a [[Canada Council]] Grant allowed her to again travel to Europe to photograph and study ironwork throughout Spain and France. The experience resulted in a series of paintings titled 'THE SPIRIT BALCONY PAINTINGS'.  Roald Nasgaard, in his book 'Abstract Painting in Canada', writes of the artist, \"Always a fluid and luscious painter of great gusto, comfortable with intimacy as well as the grand scale.\"<ref>Abstract Painting in Canada, Publisher: Douglas & McIntyre, pages Pages: 261, 262, and 124, 2007</ref>\n\n==Major group exhibitions==\n* 1968 Gallery of Contemporary Art, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, now called South Eastern Center for Contemporary Art - SECCA' -The Curator and Director then was Ted Potter: sculpture.

She is an award-winning painter whose works on canvas and paper have been shown in 32 solo exhibits as well as being included in 94 group shows. Her work, which ranges from complete abstraction to the use of organic and architectural images, relates to the formalist ideas of [[Clement Greenberg]] and is noted for the use of color.<ref>{{cite book|title=Women Artists News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1y0yAQAAIAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Midmarch Associates|page=17}}</ref>  Some of Sutton paintings have been related to [[ontology]].<ref>James Clark The Problem of Fundamental Ontology, Volume III, Limits Book Company, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Published 1973</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nThe daughter of Robert William Sutton, a designer and manufacturer of marine instruments and Nancy Chester Sustare, artist and homemaker, Carol spent her first six years living in a log cabin high on the sand dunes of Chesapeake Bay overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. She won a blue ribbon for her art in the Junior Section at the Sears-Allstate Tidewater Arts Festival. She received two Virginia Museum Fellowships and studied at [[Virginia Commonwealth University|Richmond Professional Institute]] (VCU) in Richmond, earning a BFA in 1967<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.carolsutton.net/text/curriculum_vitae_sutton.html|title=Short Curriculum Vitae of artist Carol Sutton|website=www.carolsutton.net|access-date=2019-12-27}}</ref> along with a Gold Key and Art Achievement Award and a scholarship to attend the 'School of Visual Arts' in New York City.\n\nSutton received two teaching fellowships which allowed her to attend the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]] (UNCG),<ref>Reed Publishing Who's Who in American Art, 1990</ref> where her professors introduced her to the work of [[Morris Louis]] and [[Kenneth Noland]].  In 1969 she graduated with a Masters of Fine Art degree.\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1967, when Sutton was twenty-two, her work entered the Jacob Kainen Collection, of the Smithsonian Museum of American Art with a portfolio of sixteen serigraphs titled 'The Artist As A Young Woman - Picabia'. Thinking that her artistic goals and the materials she used were similar to those of [[Eva Hesse]],  Will Insley, Sutton's professor at UNCG, introduced the two women in 1969 in his New York loft. That year a large scale sculpture she created was purchased by 'Weatherspoon Art Gallery', Greensboro, N.C.\n\nWorking on large sculpture in the isolation of her studio in Greensboro, North Carolina Sutton was offered a solo show of these works at The [[OK Harris Gallery|O.K. Harris Gallery]] in New York. However, she instead moved to Canada and married the sculptor [[Andr\u00e9 Fauteux]] with whom she has two children, Viva-Laura Sutton-Fauteux (1980-2016) and Yale Sutton-Fauteux.\n\nWhile working in Canada, Sutton was awarded Ontario Arts Council grants in  1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, and 1979. She received a bursary and two travel grants from the Canada Council for the Arts between 1983 and 1992.\n\nIn Canada Sutton produced multiple exhibitions across Canada and showed with the Theo Waddington Galleries, and later at Gallery One in Toronto.  In Toronto, Sutton also did sculpture collaborations with contemporary electronic music composers. In Canada Sutton's work received positive reviews from critics Clement Greenberg and [[Karen Wilkin]], and was influenced by the artists [[Anthony Caro]] and [[Helen Frankenthaler]], all of whom regularly came to her Toronto studio. Fauteux introduced Sutton to [[Jack Bush]] in 1974 and has been included in a number of exhibitions related to Bush's influence.\n\nIn 1977, Sutton presented her first Canadian exhibition at the A.C.T. Gallery. In 1978 Sutton held her first New York one-woman show at the William Edward O'Reilly Gallery. In the U.S.A. Sutton's work was noted by critic Kenworth Moffett, the Contemporary Curator of The [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]], who purchased her work 'Alvertie' for their collection and included her in the [[Andr\u00e9 Emmerich]] Gallery touring show, The New Generation: A Curator's Choice.\n\nEight years after she left, Sutton returned to New York to show as an artist, this time as a painter not a sculptor. There she received an [[Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation]] grant.\n\n==Later career==\n\nSutton became known for her large scale abstract acrylic paintings, which she painted with canvas laid directly on the floor.<ref>{{cite book|title=Artmagazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VfrAAAAMAAJ|volume=13, Issues 55-59|year=1981|publisher=Art Magazine, Incorporated|pages=65\u201366}}</ref> Related to the tradition of [[Color Field]] Painting her art has been linked by critics to the art movement called [[Lyrical Abstraction]]. Her smaller paper works often take on unusual structural forms and have widely extended edges, sometimes cut in wave shapes. Sutton was encouraged by critic [[Michael Fried]] whom she met 1n 1986 at [[Triangle Arts Trust|Triangle Artist Workshop]].<ref>Fried, Michael, Triangle Artists' Workshop, published catalog, 1986, Triangle Arts Trust</ref> In 1987 Sutton was invited to participate in the Art Triangle Workshop in Barcelona, her third Triangle workshop. Two years later a [[Canada Council]] Grant allowed her to again travel to Europe to photograph and study ironwork throughout Spain and France. The experience resulted in a series of paintings titled 'THE SPIRIT BALCONY PAINTINGS'.  Roald Nasgaard, in his book 'Abstract Painting in Canada', writes of the artist, \"Always a fluid and luscious painter of great gusto, comfortable with intimacy as well as the grand scale.\"<ref>Abstract Painting in Canada, Publisher: Douglas & McIntyre, pages Pages: 261, 262, and 124, 2007</ref>\n\n==Major group exhibitions==\n* 1968 Gallery of Contemporary Art, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, now called South Eastern Center for Contemporary Art - SECCA' -The Curator and Director then was Ted Potter: sculpture.

Due to her father's skill with cloth dyeing, Arachne became adept in the art of weaving.

In the second season of the anime based on the manga ''[[Kuroshitsuji]]'', one main antagonist, the demon butler Claude Faustus, has spiderlike qualities and powers. He is also capable of transforming into a spider and making webs.\n\nIn the manga ''[[The Saga of Darren Shan]]'', the titular character is fascinated by spiders. He kept them as pets until he killed one that he got when he was nine years old. He used to let them go into his mouth and he would imagine them eating him from the inside out. Normally, the spiders would stay with him for about a day or two, but some lasted longer. Later on, we find out that he can communicate with spiders.\n\nThe manga ''[[Ghost in The Shell]]'' by [[Masamune Shirow]] prominently features spiderlike, AI-equipped, multi-legged combat vehicles called [[Fuchikoma]] (evolving into the [[Tachikoma]], Uchikoma and Logicoma in subsequent anime versions of the series). These mobile weapon platforms are used by the members of [[Section 9]] to aid in their various missions.\nIn the manga ''[[Monster Musume]]'' by [[Okayado]], the character Rachnera Arachnera is an Arachne who is feared by her host family and initially abandoned. She demonstrates skills in web weaving. She initially hated humans for how judgmental they were of her,\nbut Kimihito was able to change her mind;\nshe now lives with him.\n\nThe [[light novel]] and manga series ''[[So I'm a Spider, So What?]]'', the protagonist is turned into a spider at the beginning of the story.

One of the most notable characters in comic book history has taken his identity from the spider, the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comic book hero [[Spider-Man]]. Peter Parker was accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider and then, as Spider-Man, was able to scale tall buildings and shoot web fluid from a device attached to his wrist. Along with these abilities, came super senses and instant reflexes. Writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]] originated this franchise. Due to the character's popularity, Spider-Man appeared in [[Spider-Man in other media|movies and various other media]]. In addition to Spider-Man, the [[Marvel Universe]] includes several subsequent characters using the spider as their patron; including [[Spider-Woman]], [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]], the [[Scarlet Spider]], [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], [[Ara\u00f1a]], the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], and the [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]]. The [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]] also include characters named [[Spider Girl]] and the [[Tarantula (DC Comics)|Tarantula]].\n\nMany other comic book, [[manga]] and [[anime]] characters have taken the guise of a spider, such as the [[Black Spider]] from the [[Batman]] universe;<ref name =\"Black spider\">{{cite book |last=Moench |author2=Jones & Beatty |title=''Batman'' #518|date=May 1995 |publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> in the [[Pok\u00e9mon]] franchise, [[Spinarak]] and [[Ariados]], [[Joltik]] and [[Galvantula]], and [[Dewpider]] and [[Araquanid]], are all variously based on spiders. In the ''[[Static Shock]]'' series, [[Static Shock|Anansi the Spider]] takes his name and techniques from the African trickster god. In the second season of the anime based on the manga ''[[Kuroshitsuji]]'', one main antagonist, the demon butler Claude Faustus, has spiderlike qualities and powers. He is also capable of transforming into a spider and making webs.\n\nIn the manga ''[[The Saga of Darren Shan]]'', the titular character is fascinated by spiders. He kept them as pets until he killed one that he got when he was nine years old. He used to let them go into his mouth and he would imagine them eating him from the inside out. Normally, the spiders would stay with him for about a day or two, but some lasted longer. Later on, we find out that he can communicate with spiders.\n\nThe manga ''[[Ghost in The Shell]]'' by [[Masamune Shirow]] prominently features spiderlike, AI-equipped, multi-legged combat vehicles called [[Fuchikoma]] (evolving into the [[Tachikoma]], Uchikoma and Logicoma in subsequent anime versions of the series). These mobile weapon platforms are used by the members of [[Section 9]] to aid in their various missions.\nIn the manga ''[[Monster Musume]]'' by [[Okayado]], the character Rachnera Arachnera is an Arachne who is feared by her host family and initially abandoned. She demonstrates skills in web weaving. She initially hated humans for how judgmental they were of her,\nbut Kimihito was able to change her mind;\nshe now lives with him.\n\nThe [[light novel]] and manga series ''[[So I'm a Spider, So What?]]'', the protagonist is turned into a spider at the beginning of the story. Trapped in a world based around Japanese role-playing game [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s, she makes use of webs, various types of poison and venom attacks, and her intellect to survive.<ref>Kakashi, A., & Baba, O.

A large [[squall line]] formed and tracked through the [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|mid-Atlantic]] on April 13, prompting more [[tornado warning]]s and [[Tornado watch|watches]]. Fifteen total watches were produced during the course of the event, two of which were designated [[Particularly Dangerous Situation]]s.\n\nThroughout the two-day outbreak, a total of 134&nbsp;tornadoes touched down across 10&nbsp;states, inflicting widespread and locally catastrophic damage. The strongest tornado occurred in southern Mississippi, producing estimated winds of {{convert|190|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, reaching a width of {{convert|2.25|mi|km|abbr=on}}, and causing eight deaths. With a total of 32 tornado-related fatalities, it was the deadliest tornado outbreak since [[tornado outbreak of April 27\u201330, 2014|April 27\u201330, 2014]].

Metal buildings were damaged, and outbuildings were destroyed as well. A house along Matthews Road had much of its roof torn off, and a nearby vehicle was rolled down a hill and badly mangled. After crossing [[Mississippi Highway 15]] and entering [[Jasper County, Mississippi|Jasper County]], the tornado intensified back to low-end EF4 intensity as it struck the community of [[Moss, Mississippi|Moss]], where nearly every structure in town was damaged and numerous homes were destroyed. Several of these homes were flattened with only piles of rubble remaining, and one was left with only a single closet standing. Half of the First Baptist Church was leveled, and a pickup truck was thrown hundreds of yards and completely destroyed. Continuing northeast of Moss, the tornado began to weaken, producing EF1 to EF2 damage. Several homes and mobile homes had metal roofing peeled back or decking exposed. Large swaths of trees were snapped for several miles, including some along Interstate 59 between the [[Heidelberg, Mississippi|Heidelberg]] and Vossburg exits. Barns and outbuildings were destroyed along this segment of the path, and some power poles were snapped.

It first touched down along Price Road in [[Lawrence County, Mississippi]], east-southeast of the small community of [[Topeka, Mississippi|Topeka]]. Damage at the beginning of the path consisted of a few trees uprooted at EF0 strength. The tornado continued to the northeast, reaching EF2 intensity as it crossed Given Road, where a large swath of trees was flattened. EF2 damage continued to the northeast, with many large trees snapped and uprooted. A house along Rayborn Lane sustained EF1 roof damage, and two nearby sheds were damaged as well. The tornado strengthened further and reached EF3 strength as it moved through a wooded area near the [[Pearl River]], where numerous trees were snapped and partially debarked. After crossing the Pearl River, the tornado passed northeast of [[Oak Vale, Mississippi|Oak Vale]] where some homes sustained roof and exterior wall loss, numerous trees were snapped, a metal building was destroyed, and damage was rated EF2 to EF3. Crossing into [[Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi|Jefferson Davis County]], EF2 damage occurred in areas to the northeast of Oak Vale, where numerous trees and power poles were snapped, outbuildings were destroyed, homes sustained severe roof damage, and a mobile home was destroyed. A small area of EF3 damage occurred along Kirkley Lane, where some trees were denuded and partially debarked. A home and an outbuilding farther away from the center of the damage path sustained sustained EF1 damage as well. Additional EF2 damage occurred to the west and north of [[Carson, Mississippi|Carson]], where a small business housed in a manufactured structure was completely destroyed, many trees were downed, and two well-built homes had their roofs torn off. EF2 damage continued to the northeast of Carson, where several mobile homes were destroyed, another house had its roof ripped off, and multiple other homes sustained less severe roof damage.<ref name=\"dmgview\"/>\n\nCrossing [[Mississippi Highway 35]], the tornado again attained EF3 strength as the James Hill Church was completely leveled, a nearby home sustained collapse of its exterior walls, and trees were denuded and partially debarked. Multiple mobile homes were also destroyed in this area, and power poles were snapped. Additional EF3-level tree damage occurred along Terrell Road before the tornado crossed into [[Covington County, Mississippi|Covington County]]. EF3 tree damage again occurred along Three Notch Road, while a mobile home and two frame homes were destroyed nearby. The tornado weakened back to EF2 intensity as it approached and crossed [[U.S. Route 84]], snapping and uprooting numerous trees and destroying numerous chicken houses. As the tornado continued to the northeast, it produced EF1 to EF2 damage as it approached and crossed [[U.S. Route 49]] to the northwest of [[Collins, Mississippi|Collins]], downing many trees, some of which landed on homes and mobile homes. A small silo was blown over, outbuildings were destroyed, a mobile home was blown away and destroyed, and some houses sustained roof damage. Crossing Jones Chapel Road to the northeast, the tornado weakened to EF1 strength, with damage limited to downed trees. EF1 tree and outbuilding damage continued through the northwestern corner of [[Jones County, Mississippi|Jones County]] and the southwestern corner of [[Smith County, Mississippi|Smith County]], and a church sustained some damage along this segment of the path as well. EF1 damage continued into [[Jasper County, Mississippi|Jasper County]], where a house and a chicken farm were damaged, and many trees were downed in and around the small community of [[Stringer, Mississippi|Stringer]]. EF1 tree and outbuilding damage continued along the remainder of the path and through the rural community of [[Paulding, Mississippi|Paulding]] until the tornado dissipated along County Road 31 to the south of [[Rose Hill, Mississippi]].<ref name=\"JAN_0412\" /><ref name=\"dmgview\"/>\n\nRemaining on the ground for {{convert|84.1|mi|km|abbr=on|sortable=on}}, this was the longest tracked-tornado of the outbreak.

A weather station at the Public Works Department measured an unconfirmed gust of {{convert|106|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Thereafter, the tornado weakened back to an EF0 and produced weak, sporadic tree and structural damage to a few homes as it skipped northeast. It then crossed [[Interstate 75 in Georgia|Intersate 75]] before moving into [[Tennessee]].<ref name=\"FFC_0415\"/> The tornado than strengthened to EF1 strength again as it impacted the the Harris Hills area, uprooting trees. The tornado then rapidly reached its peak intensity of EF3 as entered the Bella Vista Acres area, causing significant roof damage to several structures. An auto-parts store in the area was leveled and a resturant on the end of a large shopping building had its facade ripped off a restaurant and its roofed peeled back. As the tornado continued northeast, a [[tornado emergency]] was issued for [[Collegedale, Tennessee|Collegedale]] and [[Ooltewah, Tennessee|Ooltewah]]. The tornado then reached its widest part of the as it entered the Drake Forest neighborhood while still at EF3 intensity. Widespread damage to structures occurred here as homes, roofs, and trees sustained significant damage. EF2 to EF3 damage continued through the Holly Hills neighborhood where additional trees were snapped, power poles were downed, and homes sustained significant damage. The tornado then abruptly narrowed and weakened back to EF1 strength as it moved directly into [[Ooltewah, Tennessee|Ooltewah]] and hit the Integra Hills Preserve Apartments, where many homes sustained roof damage.
