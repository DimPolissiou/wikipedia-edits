The script was adapted from the novel ''[[Enigma (novel)|Enigma]]'' by [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]], about the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] codebreakers of [[Bletchley Park]] in the [[Second World War]].\n\nAlthough the story is highly fictionalised, the process of encrypting German messages during World War II and decrypting them with the Enigma is discussed in detail, and the historical event of the [[Katyn massacre]] is highlighted. It was the last film scored by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story, loosely based on actual events, takes place in March 1943, when the [[Second World War]] was at its height. The [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalysts]] at [[Bletchley Park]], [[Buckinghamshire]], have a problem: the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[U-boat]]s have changed one of their code reference books used for [[Enigma machine]] [[cipher]]s, leading to a blackout in the flow of vital naval [[signals intelligence]]. The British cryptanalysts have cracked the [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#M4 (German Navy 4-rotor Enigma)|\"Shark\" cipher]] once before, and they need to do it again in order to keep track of U-boat locations.\n\nThe film begins with Tom Jericho returning to Bletchley after a month recovering from a nervous breakdown brought on by his failed love affair with a coworker named Claire Romilly. Jericho immediately seeks to see her again and finds that she mysteriously disappeared a few days earlier. He enlists the help of Claire's housemate, Hester Wallace, to follow the trail of clues and learn what has happened to Claire.\n\nMr. Jericho and Miss Wallace, as they formally address each other, work to decipher intercepts stolen by Claire and determine why she took them. Jericho is closely watched by an [[MI5]] agent, Wigram ([[Jeremy Northam]]), who plays [[cat and mouse]] with him throughout the film. Meanwhile, U-boats are closing in on a convoy of thirty seven ships from America, giving the code-breakers less than four days to find a solution to reading the changed Shark cipher.\n\nBut someone else at Bletchley has a personal interest in the stolen intercepts, and may be responsible for Claire's disappearance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dougray Scott]] as Tom Jericho\n* [[Kate Winslet]] as Hester Wallace\n* [[Saffron Burrows]] as Claire Romilly\n* [[Jeremy Northam]] as Mr Wigram\n* [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] as Jozef 'Puck' Pukowski\n* [[Tom Hollander]] as Guy Logie\n* [[Donald Sumpter]] as Leveret\n* [[Matthew Macfadyen]] as Cave\n* [[Robert Pugh]] as Skynner\n* [[Corin Redgrave]] as Admiral Trowbridge\n* [[Nicholas Rowe (actor)|Nicholas Rowe]] as Villiers\n* [[Edward Hardwicke]] as Heaviside\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production and premiere==\n[[File:BletcleyPark SubModel.JPG|thumb|The scaled-down model of a Second World War U-boat used in the film.

During the run, more than three hundred programmes, featuring original [[television play]]s, and adaptations of stage plays and novels, were transmitted. The individual episodes were between fifty and a hundred minutes in duration. A handful of these plays, including ''[[Rumpole of the Bailey]]'', subsequently became television series in their own right.\n\n==History==\nThe strand was a successor to ''[[The Wednesday Play]]'', the 1960s anthology series, the title being changed when the day of transmission became variable. Some works screened in anthology series' on [[BBC Two|BBC2]], like [[Willy Russell]]'s ''[[Our Day Out]]'' (1977), were repeated on BBC1 in the series. The producers of ''The Wednesday Play'', [[Graeme MacDonald]] and [[Irene Shubik]], transferred to the new series. Shubik continued with the series until 1973<ref>Irene Shubik [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/apr/05/theatre \"Letters: Eclectic roster on Play for Today\",] ''The Guardian'', 5 April 2008</ref> while MacDonald remained with the series until 1977 when he was promoted. Later producers included Margaret Matheson and [[Richard Eyre]] (1978\u201380).\n\nPlays covered all genres. In its time, ''Play for Today'' featured contemporary [[social realism|social realist dramas]], historical pieces, fantasies, biopics and occasionally science-fiction<ref>Richard Hewett [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/714453/index.html ''Flipside of Dominick Hide, The (1980)''], BFI screenonline</ref> (''[[The Flipside of Dominick Hide]]'', 1980). Most pieces were written directly for television, but there were also occasional adaptations from other narrative forms, such as novels and stage plays.\n\nWriters who contributed plays to the series included [[Ian McEwan]], [[John Osborne]], [[Dennis Potter]], [[Stephen Poliakoff]], [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]], [[Willy Russell]], [[Alan Bleasdale]], [[Arthur Hopcraft]], [[Alan Plater]], [[Graham Reid (writer)|Graham Reid]], [[David Storey]], [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]], [[Rhys Adrian]] and [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]. Several prominent directors also featured, including [[Stephen Frears]], [[Alan Clarke]], [[Michael Apted]], [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]], [[Roland Joffe]], [[Ken Loach]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], and [[Mike Leigh]]. Some of the best remembered plays broadcast in the strand include ''[[Edna, the Inebriate Woman]]'' (1971), ''[[The Foxtrot]]'' (1971), ''[[Home (play)|Home]]'' (1972), ''[[Bar Mitzvah Boy]]'' (1976), ''[[Abigail's Party]]'' (1977), ''[[Blue Remembered Hills]]'' (1979) and ''[[Just a Boys' Game]]'' (1979). Certain other well known plays, including ''[[Penda's Fen]]'' (1974), ''[[Nuts in May]]'' (1976), were commissioned by [[David Rose (producer)|David Rose]] of the BBC's English Regions Drama department based in [[Pebble Mill Studios|Birmingham]].\n\nSome installments in the series were spun off into full-blown series. Probably the two best-remembered examples of this are ''[[Rumpole of the Bailey#Origins: Play for Today|Rumpole of the Bailey]]'', which was produced as a one-off in the ''Play for Today'' strand in 1975 and three years later became a series for [[Thames Television]], again with [[Leo McKern]]. [[Alan Bleasdale]]'s ''The Black Stuff'', was a single play broadcast on BBC2 in January 1980, which was developed into ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]''. It was never part of the ''Play For Today'' strand, although it was repeated on BBC1 later that year as a single play.<ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/6dd53e1faa6844c1a56cd4c5e049db68</ref><ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/c95d68d870274ab1941362fb1649c953</ref> Other offshoots were ''[[Gangsters (TV series)|Gangsters]]'', and a single series of science fiction-based plays styled as ''[[Play for Tomorrow]]''. Towards the end of the run, three plays set in Northern Ireland were written by [[Graham Reid (writer)|Graham Reid]]. Known as the Billy Plays, they starred [[Kenneth Branagh]] as Billy Martin in his first acting role following his graduation from [[RADA]].\n\nThere were also some groups of plays transmitted that \u2014 for various reasons \u2014 did not go out under the ''Play for Today'' banner, but which were funded from the same department, used much the same production team and are generally regarded in episode guides and analysis as being part of the ''Play for Today'' 'canon'.\n\nSeveral plays were BAFTA award winners. [[John Le Mesurier]] and [[Patricia Hayes]] were named Best Actor & Actress respectively for their roles in the 1971 series ''Traitor'' and ''Edna, The Inebriate Woman'', the latter also being named Best Drama Production. [[Celia Johnson]] was named Best Actress for ''Mrs. Palfrey At The Claremont'', broadcast in 1973. ''Stocker's Copper (1972)'', ''Kisses At Fifty (1973)'', ''Bar Mitzvah Boy (1976)'', ''Spend, Spend, Spend! (1977)'', ''Licking Hitler (1978)'' and ''Blue Remembered Hills (1979)'' were all named Best Single Play by BAFTA.\n\n==Controversies==\n\nTwo plays were controversially pulled from transmission shortly before broadcast due to concerns over their content: these were Dennis Potter's ''[[Brimstone and Treacle]]'' in 1976 and Roy Minton's ''[[Scum (television play)|Scum]]'' the following year. In the case of ''Brimstone and Treacle'' it was due to concerns over the play's depiction of a disabled woman's rape at the hands of a man who may or may not be the [[devil]], and with ''Scum'' the worry was its supposed sensationalism of life in a young offenders' institution (then still known as a [[borstal]]). ''Scum'' and ''Brimstone and Treacle'' were eventually transmitted, although in the meantime both had circumvented their withdrawal by being re-made as cinema films.\n\nThe series as a whole was viewed with suspicion by rightwing commentators and critics as many of the issues tackled were the subject of political controversy. Of particular note was the criticism of the public expenditure on the Queen's Silver Jubilee in the plays ''[[The Price of Coal]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Spongers]]'' (1978).\n\n==Demise and legacy==\n\nAfter fourteen seasons and numerous repeats of individual productions, the programme officially ended in 1984, although there was one further series not broadcast in its original name but in its replacement name ''[[Screen One]]'' and ''[[Screen Two]]'' in 1985. The general trend in 1980s television production was away from one-off plays and towards a greater concentration on series and serials. When one-offs were produced, such as [[Film4 Productions|Film on Four]] on [[Channel 4]], they tended to be made with a cinematic approach rather than betraying television drama's roots in the theatre that ''Play for Today'' and earlier series on both the BBC and  ITV had often demonstrated.\n\nNonetheless, the series is generally remembered as a benchmark of high-quality British television drama, and has become a byword for what many continue to argue was a golden age of British television. In 2000, the [[British Film Institute]] produced a poll of industry professionals to determine the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, and five of the programmes included in the final tally were from ''Play for Today''.\n\nA new programme publicised as a return of ''Play for Today'', but under the working title of ''The Evening Play'', was announced at the beginning of March 2006,<ref>{{cite news\n  | last =Gibson\n  | first =Owen\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = BBC to revive the drama slot that helped Loach and Leigh to fame\n  | work =[[The Guardian]]\n  | date =1 March 2006\n  | url= http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,,1720525,00.html\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =31 March 2008}}</ref> but nothing has been heard from it since.

During the run, more than three hundred programmes, featuring original [[television play]]s, and adaptations of stage plays and novels, were transmitted. The individual episodes were between fifty and a hundred minutes in duration. A handful of these plays, including ''[[Rumpole of the Bailey]]'', subsequently became television series in their own right.\n\n==History==\nThe strand was a successor to ''[[The Wednesday Play]]'', the 1960s anthology series, the title being changed when the day of transmission became variable. Some works screened in anthology series' on [[BBC Two|BBC2]], like [[Willy Russell]]'s ''[[Our Day Out]]'' (1977), were repeated on BBC1 in the series. The producers of ''The Wednesday Play'', [[Graeme MacDonald]] and [[Irene Shubik]], transferred to the new series. Shubik continued with the series until 1973<ref>Irene Shubik [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/apr/05/theatre \"Letters: Eclectic roster on Play for Today\",] ''The Guardian'', 5 April 2008</ref> while MacDonald remained with the series until 1977 when he was promoted. Later producers included Margaret Matheson and [[Richard Eyre]] (1978\u201380).\n\nPlays covered all genres. In its time, ''Play for Today'' featured contemporary [[social realism|social realist dramas]], historical pieces, fantasies, biopics and occasionally science-fiction<ref>Richard Hewett [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/714453/index.html ''Flipside of Dominick Hide, The (1980)''], BFI screenonline</ref> (''[[The Flipside of Dominick Hide]]'', 1980). Most pieces were written directly for television, but there were also occasional adaptations from other narrative forms, such as novels and stage plays.\n\nWriters who contributed plays to the series included [[Ian McEwan]], [[John Osborne]], [[Dennis Potter]], [[Stephen Poliakoff]], [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]], [[Willy Russell]], [[Alan Bleasdale]], [[Arthur Hopcraft]], [[Alan Plater]], [[Graham Reid (writer)|Graham Reid]], [[David Storey]], [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]], [[Rhys Adrian]] and [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]. Several prominent directors also featured, including [[Stephen Frears]], [[Alan Clarke]], [[Michael Apted]], [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]], [[Roland Joffe]], [[Ken Loach]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], and [[Mike Leigh]]. Some of the best remembered plays broadcast in the strand include ''[[Edna, the Inebriate Woman]]'' (1971), ''[[The Foxtrot]]'' (1971), ''[[Home (play)|Home]]'' (1972), ''[[Bar Mitzvah Boy]]'' (1976), ''[[Abigail's Party]]'' (1977), ''[[Blue Remembered Hills]]'' (1979) and ''[[Just a Boys' Game]]'' (1979). Certain other well known plays, including ''[[Penda's Fen]]'' (1974), ''[[Nuts in May]]'' (1976), were commissioned by [[David Rose (producer)|David Rose]] of the BBC's English Regions Drama department based in [[Pebble Mill Studios|Birmingham]].\n\nSome installments in the series were spun off into full-blown series. Probably the two best-remembered examples of this are ''[[Rumpole of the Bailey#Origins: Play for Today|Rumpole of the Bailey]]'', which was produced as a one-off in the ''Play for Today'' strand in 1975 and three years later became a series for [[Thames Television]], again with [[Leo McKern]]. [[Alan Bleasdale]]'s ''The Black Stuff'', was a single play broadcast on BBC2 in January 1980, which was developed into ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]''. It was never part of the ''Play For Today'' strand, although it was repeated on BBC1 later that year as a single play.<ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/6dd53e1faa6844c1a56cd4c5e049db68</ref><ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/c95d68d870274ab1941362fb1649c953</ref> Other offshoots were ''[[Gangsters (TV series)|Gangsters]]'', and a single series of science fiction-based plays styled as ''[[Play for Tomorrow]]''. Towards the end of the run, three plays set in Northern Ireland were written by [[Graham Reid (writer)|Graham Reid]]. Known as the Billy Plays, they starred [[Kenneth Branagh]] as Billy Martin in his first acting role following his graduation from [[RADA]].\n\nThere were also some groups of plays transmitted that \u2014 for various reasons \u2014 did not go out under the ''Play for Today'' banner, but which were funded from the same department, used much the same production team and are generally regarded in episode guides and analysis as being part of the ''Play for Today'' 'canon'.\n\nSeveral plays were BAFTA award winners. [[John Le Mesurier]] and [[Patricia Hayes]] were named Best Actor & Actress respectively for their roles in the 1971 series ''Traitor'' and ''Edna, The Inebriate Woman'', the latter also being named Best Drama Production. [[Celia Johnson]] was named Best Actress for ''Mrs. Palfrey At The Claremont'', broadcast in 1973. ''Stocker's Copper (1972)'', ''Kisses At Fifty (1973)'', ''Bar Mitzvah Boy (1976)'', ''Spend, Spend, Spend! (1977)'', ''Licking Hitler (1978)'' and ''Blue Remembered Hills (1979)'' were all named Best Single Play by BAFTA.\n\n==Controversies==\n\nTwo plays were controversially pulled from transmission shortly before broadcast due to concerns over their content: these were Dennis Potter's ''[[Brimstone and Treacle]]'' in 1976 and Roy Minton's ''[[Scum (television play)|Scum]]'' the following year. In the case of ''Brimstone and Treacle'' it was due to concerns over the play's depiction of a disabled woman's rape at the hands of a man who may or may not be the [[devil]], and with ''Scum'' the worry was its supposed sensationalism of life in a young offenders' institution (then still known as a [[borstal]]). ''Scum'' and ''Brimstone and Treacle'' were eventually transmitted, although in the meantime both had circumvented their withdrawal by being re-made as cinema films.\n\nThe series as a whole was viewed with suspicion by rightwing commentators and critics as many of the issues tackled were the subject of political controversy. Of particular note was the criticism of the public expenditure on the Queen's Silver Jubilee in the plays ''[[The Price of Coal]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Spongers]]'' (1978).\n\n==Demise and legacy==\n\nAfter fourteen seasons and numerous repeats of individual productions, the programme officially ended in 1984, although there was one further series not broadcast in its original name but in its replacement name ''[[Screen One]]'' and ''[[Screen Two]]'' in 1985. The general trend in 1980s television production was away from one-off plays and towards a greater concentration on series and serials. When one-offs were produced, such as [[Film4 Productions|Film on Four]] on [[Channel 4]], they tended to be made with a cinematic approach rather than betraying television drama's roots in the theatre that ''Play for Today'' and earlier series on both the BBC and  ITV had often demonstrated.\n\nNonetheless, the series is generally remembered as a benchmark of high-quality British television drama, and has become a byword for what many continue to argue was a golden age of British television. In 2000, the [[British Film Institute]] produced a poll of industry professionals to determine the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, and five of the programmes included in the final tally were from ''Play for Today''.\n\nA new programme publicised as a return of ''Play for Today'', but under the working title of ''The Evening Play'', was announced at the beginning of March 2006,<ref>{{cite news\n  | last =Gibson\n  | first =Owen\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = BBC to revive the drama slot that helped Loach and Leigh to fame\n  | work =[[The Guardian]]\n  | date =1 March 2006\n  | url= http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,,1720525,00.html\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =31 March 2008}}</ref> but nothing has been heard from it since.

The republican government of [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]] initiated numerous reforms designed to modernize the country. After the [[Spanish general election, 1933|1933 general election]], [[Alejandro Lerroux]] ([[Radical Republican Party|Radical Party]]) formed a government with the [[confidence and supply]] of the [[Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Right-wing Groups]] (CEDA). Under Lerroux's premiership, the Republic found itself facing an insurrection of [[anarchism|anarchists]] and socialists that took on revolutionary dimensions in [[Asturias]]. The revolt was finally suppressed by the Republic with the intervention of the army. The [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] won the [[Spanish general election, 1936|1936 general election]]. On 17\u2013[[18 July]] [[1936]], [[Spanish coup of July 1936|a coup d'\u00e9tat]] fractured the [[Spanish Republican Armed Forces]], marking the beginning of the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, there were three governments. The first was led by left-wing republican [[Jos\u00e9 Giral]] (from July to September 1936); however, a [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|revolution]] inspired mostly on [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialist]], [[anarchism|anarchist]] and [[communism|communist]] principles broke within the Republic, which weakened the rule of the Republic. The second government was led by [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|socialist]] [[Francisco Largo Caballero]] of the trade union [[General Union of Workers]] (UGT). The UGT, along with the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT), were the main forces behind the aforementioned social revolution. The third government was led by socialist [[Juan Negr\u00edn]], who led the Republic until the military coup of [[Segismundo Casado]], which ended republican resistance and ultimately led to the victory of the nationalists, who established a [[military dictatorship]] under the rule of [[Francisco Franco]], known as [[Francoist Spain]].\n\nThe Republican government survived [[Spanish Republican government in exile|in exile]], and retained an embassy in [[Mexico City]] until 1976. After the restoration of democracy in Spain, the government formally dissolved the following year.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cepc.gob.es/en/publications/journals/accesstohistoriccollectionofjournals?IDR=13&IDN=1180&IDA=34632 |title=Javier Rubio, ''Los reconocimientos diplom\u00e1ticos del Gobierno de la Rep\u00fablica espa\u00f1ola en el exilio'' |access-date=23 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013013822/http://www.cepc.gob.es/en/publications/journals/accesstohistoriccollectionofjournals?IDR=13&IDN=1180&IDA=34632 |archive-date=13 October 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Reformist Biennium ==\n{{Main|Spanish Constitution of 1931}}\n{{See also|Background of the Spanish Civil War}}\n\nOn 28 January 1930, the military dictatorship of General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] (who had been in power since September 1923) was overthrown.<ref>{{harvnb|Casanova|2010|p=10}}</ref> This led various republican factions from a wide variety of backgrounds (including old conservatives, socialists and Catalan nationalists) to join forces.<ref>{{harvnb|Casanova|2010|p=1}}</ref> The [[Pact of San Sebasti\u00e1n]] was the key to the transition from monarchy to republic.

The ''[[Himno de Riego]]'' was established as the national anthem, and the [[Flag of the Second Spanish Republic|Tricolor]], with three horizontal red-yellow-purple fields, became the new flag of Spain. Under the new Constitution, all of Spain's regions had the right to [[autonomy]]. [[Catalonia]] (1932), the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] (1936) and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (although the Galician Statute of Autonomy couldn't come into effect due to the war) exercised this right, with [[Aragon]], Andalusia and [[Valencia]], engaged in negotiations with the government before the outbreak of the Civil War. The Constitution guaranteed a wide range of civil liberties, but it opposed key beliefs of the conservative right, which was very rooted in rural areas, and desires of the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church, which was stripped of schools and public subsidies.\n\n== 1934\u20131935 period and miners' uprising ==\n{{unref|section|date=April 2020}}\n{{Main|Asturian miners' strike of 1934}}\n{{See also|Background of the Spanish Civil War#The \"two black years\"}}\nThe majority vote in the [[Spanish general election, 1933|1933 elections]] was won by the [[Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right]] (CEDA). [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gil-Robles y Qui\u00f1ones|Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gil Robles]], their leader, led a coalition of centre-right and far-right parties: CEDA set up a coalition with the [[Radical Republican Party]] led by [[Alejandro Lerroux]], which had come second in the elections. The Socialists came third. With Lerroux as head of Government, the new coalition suspended most of the reforms carried out by the last government.\n\nThe inclusion of three CEDA ministers in the government that took office on 1 October 1934 led to a [[general strike]] and a rebellion by socialists and anarchists in [[Asturias]] on 6 October. Miners in Asturias occupied the capital, [[Oviedo]], killing officials and clergymen, and burning theatres and the university. This rebellion lasted for two weeks until it was crushed by the army, led by General [[Francisco Franco]], who, in the process, destroyed large parts of the city. This operation earned Franco the nickname \"Butcher of Asturias\". Another rebellion by the autonomous government of Catalonia, led by its president [[Llu\u00eds Companys]], was also suppressed and was followed by mass arrests and trials.\n\nThe suspension of the land reforms that had been attempted by the previous government, and the failure of the Asturias miners' uprising, led to a more radical turn by the parties of the left, especially in the PSOE (Socialist Party), where the moderate [[Indalecio Prieto]] lost ground to [[Francisco Largo Caballero]], who advocated a socialist revolution. At the same time, the involvement of the Centrist government party in the [[Straperlo]] scandal deeply weakened it, further polarising political differences between right and left. These differences became evident in the 1936 elections.\n\n== 1936 elections ==\nOn 7 January 1936, [[Spanish general election, 1936|new elections]] were called. Despite significant rivalries and disagreements, the socialists, Communists, and the Catalan-and-Madrid-based left-wing Republicans decided to work together under the name [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]]. The Popular Front won the election on 16 February with 263 MPs against 156 right-wing MPs, grouped within a coalition of the ''National Front'' with CEDA, [[Carlism|Carlists]], and Monarchists. The moderate centre parties virtually disappeared; between the elections, Lerroux's group fell from the 104 representatives it had in 1934 to just 9.\n\nIn the following months, there was increasing violence between left and right. This helped the development of the fascist-inspired [[Falange]] Espa\u00f1ola, a National party led by [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]], the son of the former dictator, [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]. Although it only received 0.7 percent of the votes in the election, by July 1936 the Falange had 40,000 members.\n\n== Assassinations of political leaders and beginning of the war ==\nOn 12 July 1936, Lieutenant [[Jos\u00e9 Castillo (Spanish Civil War)|Jos\u00e9 Castillo]], an important member of the anti-fascist military organisation [[Uni\u00f3n Militar Republicana Antifascista]] (UMRA), was shot by [[Falange|Falangist]] gunmen.\n\nIn response a group of [[Guardia de Asalto]] and other leftist militiamen led by [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] Fernando Cond\u00e9s went to right-wing opposition leader  [[Jos\u00e9 Calvo Sotelo]]'s house in the early hours of 13 July on a revenge mission. Sotelo was arrested and later shot dead in a police truck. His body was dropped at the entrance of one of the city's cemeteries. According to all later investigations, the perpetrator of the murder was a socialist gunman, Luis Cuenca, who was known as the bodyguard of [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] leader [[Indalecio Prieto]]. Calvo Sotelo was one of the most prominent Spanish monarchists who, describing the government's actions as [[Bolshevism|Bolshevist]] and anarchist, had been exhorting the army to intervene, declaring that Spanish soldiers would save the country from communism if \"there are no politicians capable of doing so\".<ref>[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=EP19360409.2.84&srpos=93729&e=-------10--93721-byDA---0spain-- \"Uneasy path\".

The involvement of forces of public order in the plot and a lack of punishment or action against the attackers hurt public opinion of the government. No effective action was taken, Payne points towards possible veto by socialists within the government who shielded the killers who had been drawn from their ranks. Within hours of learning of the murder and the reaction [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] changed his mind on rebellion and dispatched a message to [[Emilio Mola|Mola]] to display his firm commitment.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen the antifascist Castillo and the anti-socialist Calvo Sotelo were buried on the same day in the same Madrid cemetery, fighting between the [[Guardia de Asalto|Police Assault Guard]] and fascist militias broke out in the surrounding streets, resulting in four more deaths.\n\nThree days later ([[18 July|17 July]]), the [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] began more or less as it had been planned, with an army uprising in [[Spanish Morocco]], which then spread to several regions of the country. Franco's move was intended to seize power immediately, but his army uprising met with serious resistance, and great swathes of Spain, including most of the main cities, remained loyal to the Republic of Spain. The leaders of the treason (Franco was not commander-in-chief yet) did not lose heart with the stalemate and apparent failure of the coup. Instead, they initiated a slow and determined war of attrition against the Republican government in Madrid.<ref name=\"iwm.org.uk\">{{cite web\n |url          = http://archive.iwm.org.uk/upload/package/5/spanish/MainText.pdf\n |title        = The Spanish Civil War exhibition: Mainline text\n |author       = Imperial War Museum\n |year         = 2002\n |accessdate   = 27 April 2013\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131211140120/http://archive.iwm.org.uk/upload/package/5/spanish/MainText.pdf\n |archive-date = 11 December 2013\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n|author-link = Imperial War Museum\n }}</ref>\nAs a result, an estimated total of half a million people would lose their lives in the war that followed; the number of casualties is actually disputed as some have suggested as many as a million people died.

Bloody purges followed in each piece of captured \"Nationalist\" territory in order to consolidate Franco's future regime.<ref name=\"iwm.org.uk\" />\nAlthough both sides received foreign military aid, the help that [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Fascist Italy]], [[Nazi Germany]] (as part of [[German involvement in the Spanish Civil War]]), and neighbouring Portugal gave the rebels was much greater and more effective than the assistance that the Republicans received from the USSR, Mexico, and volunteers of the [[International Brigades]]. While the [[Axis powers]] wholeheartedly assisted General Franco's military campaign, the governments of France, Britain, and other European powers looked the other way and let the Republican forces die, as the actions of the [[Non-Intervention Committee]] would show.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eroj.org/biblio/ibarruri/adios.htm#mensaje |title=La Pasionaria's Farewell Message to the International Brigade fighters |access-date=30 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726033933/http://www.eroj.org/biblio/ibarruri/adios.htm#mensaje |archive-date=26 July 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Imposed in the name of [[Country neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]], the [[international isolation]] of the Spanish Republic ended up favouring the interests of the future [[Axis Powers]].<ref>[http://es.slideshare.net/WALTERWILLIAMMONTALV/la-soledad-de-la-republica-angel-vinas \u00c1ngel Vi\u00f1as, ''La Soledad de la Rep\u00fablica''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630104607/http://es.slideshare.net/WALTERWILLIAMMONTALV/la-soledad-de-la-republica-angel-vinas |date=30 June 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar]] at Toledo early in the war was a turning point, with the rebels winning after a long siege. The Republicans managed to hold out in Madrid, despite a Nationalist assault in November 1936, and frustrated subsequent offensives against the capital at [[Jarama]] and Guadalajara in 1937. Soon, though, the rebels began to erode their territory, starving Madrid and making inroads into the east. The north, including the Basque country, fell in late 1937, and the Aragon front collapsed shortly afterward. The [[bombing of Guernica]] was probably the most infamous event of the war and inspired [[Guernica (painting)|Picasso's painting]]. It was used as a testing ground for the German Luftwaffe's [[Condor Legion]]. The [[Battle of the Ebro]] in July\u2013November 1938 was the final desperate attempt by the Republicans to turn the tide. When this failed and Barcelona fell to the rebels in early 1939, it was clear the war was over. The remaining Republican fronts collapsed, and Madrid fell in March 1939.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Spain|Anarchism|Liberalism|Socialism}}\n* [[Niceto Alcal\u00e1-Zamora]]\n* [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]]\n* [[Spanish Republican Armed Forces]]\n* [[Spanish Republican government in exile]]\n* [[Flag of the Second Spanish Republic]]\n* [[Coat of Arms of the Second Spanish Republic]]\n* [[Order of the Spanish Republic]]\n* [[LAPE]] (L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Postales Espa\u00f1olas), the Spanish Republican Airline\n* [[Catholicism in the Second Spanish Republic]]\n* [[Battle of the Ebro]]\n* [[Revisionism (Spain)]]\n* [[Sanjurjada]]\n* [[Electoral Carlism (Second Republic)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book |last=Beevor |first=Antony |authorlink=Antony Beevor |title=The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936\u20131939 |url=https://archive.org/details/battleforspainsp00anto |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Penguin Books |year=2006}}\n* {{cite book |last=Casanova |first=Juli\u00e1n |authorlink=Juli\u00e1n Casanova Ruiz |title=The Spanish Republic and Civil War |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-521-49388-8 |ref=harv |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KsRNmT9GzY0C&printsec=frontcover |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511763137}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Gerald Brenan]], ''[[The Spanish Labyrinth]]: An Account of the Social and Political Background of the Spanish Civil War'' (1943)\n* Henry Buckley, ''The Life and Death of the Spanish Republic: a Witness to the Spanish Civil War'', IB Tauris, (1940, rep 2013).

The Republic was proclaimed on 14 April 1931, after the deposition of [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]], and it lost the [[Spanish Civil War]] on 1 April 1939 to the [[rebel faction]] that would establish a [[Francoist Spain|military dictatorship]] under the rule of [[Francisco Franco]].\n\nAfter the proclamation of the Republic, [[Provisional Government of the Second Spanish Republic|a provisional government]] was established that lasted until December 1931, when the [[Spanish Constitution of 1931|1931 Constitution]] was approved and a Constitutional Republic was formally established. The republican government of [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]] initiated numerous reforms designed to modernize the country. After the [[Spanish general election, 1933|1933 general election]], [[Alejandro Lerroux]] ([[Radical Republican Party|Radical Party]]) formed a government with the [[confidence and supply]] of the [[Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Right-wing Groups]] (CEDA). Under Lerroux's premiership, the Republic found itself facing an insurrection of [[anarchism|anarchists]] and socialists that took on revolutionary dimensions in [[Asturias]]. The revolt was finally suppressed by the Republic with the intervention of the army. The [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] won the [[Spanish general election, 1936|1936 general election]]. On 17\u2013[[18 July]] [[1936]], [[Spanish coup of July 1936|a coup d'\u00e9tat]] fractured the [[Spanish Republican Armed Forces]], marking the beginning of the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, there were three governments. The first was led by left-wing republican [[Jos\u00e9 Giral]] (from July to September 1936); however, a [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|revolution]] inspired mostly on [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialist]], [[anarchism|anarchist]] and [[communism|communist]] principles broke within the Republic, which weakened the rule of the Republic. The second government was led by [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|socialist]] [[Francisco Largo Caballero]] of the trade union [[General Union of Workers]] (UGT). The UGT, along with the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT), were the main forces behind the aforementioned social revolution. The third government was led by socialist [[Juan Negr\u00edn]], who led the Republic until the military coup of [[Segismundo Casado]], which ended republican resistance and ultimately led to the victory of the nationalists, who established a [[military dictatorship]] under the rule of [[Francisco Franco]], known as [[Francoist Spain]].\n\nThe Republican government survived [[Spanish Republican government in exile|in exile]], and retained an embassy in [[Mexico City]] until 1976. After the restoration of democracy in Spain, the government formally dissolved the following year.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cepc.gob.es/en/publications/journals/accesstohistoriccollectionofjournals?IDR=13&IDN=1180&IDA=34632 |title=Javier Rubio, ''Los reconocimientos diplom\u00e1ticos del Gobierno de la Rep\u00fablica espa\u00f1ola en el exilio'' |access-date=23 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013013822/http://www.cepc.gob.es/en/publications/journals/accesstohistoriccollectionofjournals?IDR=13&IDN=1180&IDA=34632 |archive-date=13 October 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Reformist Biennium ==\n{{Main|Spanish Constitution of 1931}}\n{{See also|Background of the Spanish Civil War}}\n\nOn 28 January 1930 the military dictatorship of General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] (who had been in power since September 1923) was overthrown.<ref>{{harvnb|Casanova|2010|p=10}}</ref> This led various republican factions from a wide variety of backgrounds (including old conservatives, socialists and Catalan nationalists) to join forces.<ref>{{harvnb|Casanova|2010|p=1}}</ref> The [[Pact of San Sebasti\u00e1n]] was the key to the transition from monarchy to republic.

The ''[[Himno de Riego]]'' was established as the national anthem, and the [[Flag of the Second Spanish Republic|Tricolor]], with three horizontal red-yellow-purple fields, became the new flag of Spain. Under the new Constitution, all of Spain's regions had the right to [[autonomy]]. [[Catalonia]] (1932), the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] (1936) and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (although the Galician Statute of Autonomy couldn't come into effect due to the war) exercised this right, with [[Aragon]], Andalusia and [[Valencia]], engaged in negotiations with the government before the outbreak of the Civil War. The Constitution guaranteed a wide range of civil liberties, but it opposed key beliefs of the conservative right, which was very rooted in rural areas, and desires of the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church, which was stripped of schools and public subsidies.\n\n== 1934\u20131935 period and miners' uprising ==\n{{unref|section|date=April 2020}}\n{{Main|Asturian miners' strike of 1934}}\n{{See also|Background of the Spanish Civil War#The \"two black years\"}}\nThe majority vote in the [[Spanish general election, 1933|1933 elections]] was won by the [[Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right]] (CEDA). [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gil-Robles y Qui\u00f1ones|Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gil Robles]], their leader, led a coalition of centre-right and far-right parties: CEDA set up a coalition with the [[Radical Republican Party]] led by [[Alejandro Lerroux]], which had come second in the elections. The Socialists came third. With Lerroux as head of Government, the new coalition suspended most of the reforms carried out by the last government.\n\nThe inclusion of three CEDA ministers in the government that took office on 1 October 1934 led to a [[general strike]] and a rebellion by socialists and anarchists in [[Asturias]] on 6 October. Miners in Asturias occupied the capital, [[Oviedo]], killing officials and clergymen, and burning theatres and the university. This rebellion lasted for two weeks until it was crushed by the army, led by General [[Francisco Franco]], who, in the process, destroyed large parts of the city. This operation earned Franco the nickname \"Butcher of Asturias\". Another rebellion by the autonomous government of Catalonia, led by its president [[Llu\u00eds Companys]], was also suppressed and was followed by mass arrests and trials.\n\nThe suspension of the land reforms that had been attempted by the previous government, and the failure of the Asturias miners' uprising, led to a more radical turn by the parties of the left, especially in the PSOE (Socialist Party), where the moderate [[Indalecio Prieto]] lost ground to [[Francisco Largo Caballero]], who advocated a socialist revolution. At the same time, the involvement of the Centrist government party in the [[Straperlo]] scandal deeply weakened it, further polarising political differences between right and left. These differences became evident in the 1936 elections.\n\n== 1936 elections ==\nOn 7 January 1936, [[Spanish general election, 1936|new elections]] were called. Despite significant rivalries and disagreements, the socialists, Communists, and the Catalan-and-Madrid-based left-wing Republicans decided to work together under the name [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]]. The Popular Front won the election on 16 February with 263 MPs against 156 right-wing MPs, grouped within a coalition of the ''National Front'' with CEDA, [[Carlism|Carlists]], and Monarchists. The moderate centre parties virtually disappeared; between the elections, Lerroux's group fell from the 104 representatives it had in 1934 to just 9.\n\nIn the following months, there was increasing violence between left and right. This helped the development of the fascist-inspired [[Falange]] Espa\u00f1ola, a National party led by [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]], the son of the former dictator, [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]. Although it only received 0.7 percent of the votes in the election, by July 1936 the Falange had 40,000 members.\n\n== Assassinations of political leaders and beginning of the war ==\nOn 12 July 1936, Lieutenant [[Jos\u00e9 Castillo (Spanish Civil War)|Jos\u00e9 Castillo]], an important member of the anti-fascist military organisation [[Uni\u00f3n Militar Republicana Antifascista]] (UMRA), was shot by [[Falange|Falangist]] gunmen.\n\nIn response a group of [[Guardia de Asalto]] and other leftist militiamen led by [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] Fernando Cond\u00e9s went to right-wing opposition leader  [[Jos\u00e9 Calvo Sotelo]]'s house in the early hours of 13 July on a revenge mission. Sotelo was arrested and later shot dead in a police truck. His body was dropped at the entrance of one of the city's cemeteries. According to all later investigations, the perpetrator of the murder was a socialist gunman, Luis Cuenca, who was known as the bodyguard of [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] leader [[Indalecio Prieto]]. Calvo Sotelo was one of the most prominent Spanish monarchists who, describing the government's actions as [[Bolshevism|Bolshevist]] and anarchist, had been exhorting the army to intervene, declaring that Spanish soldiers would save the country from communism if \"there are no politicians capable of doing so\".<ref>[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=EP19360409.2.84&srpos=93729&e=-------10--93721-byDA---0spain-- \"Uneasy path\".

The involvement of forces of public order in the plot and a lack of punishment or action against the attackers hurt public opinion of the government. No effective action was taken, Payne points towards possible veto by socialists within the government who shielded the killers who had been drawn from their ranks.

Franco's move was intended to seize power immediately, but his army uprising met with serious resistance, and great swathes of Spain, including most of the main cities, remained loyal to the Republic of Spain. The leaders of the treason (Franco was not commander-in-chief yet) did not lose heart with the stalemate and apparent failure of the coup. Instead, they initiated a slow and determined war of attrition against the Republican government in Madrid.<ref name=\"iwm.org.uk\">{{cite web\n |url          = http://archive.iwm.org.uk/upload/package/5/spanish/MainText.pdf\n |title        = The Spanish Civil War exhibition: Mainline text\n |author       = Imperial War Museum\n |year         = 2002\n |accessdate   = 27 April 2013\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131211140120/http://archive.iwm.org.uk/upload/package/5/spanish/MainText.pdf\n |archive-date = 11 December 2013\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n|author-link = Imperial War Museum\n }}</ref>\nAs a result, an estimated total of half a million people would lose their lives in the war that followed; the number of casualties is actually disputed as some have suggested as many as a million people died.

In spite of the high hopes, the Republican authorities had to struggle with rising unemployment and poverty. In the ensuing civil unrest, violence in the form of assassination, revolutionary [[general strike]]s, and mob actions increased to dangerous levels in the eyes of the traditional centres of power, such as the landowners, the Church, and the nobility. Thus, it was easy for them to whip up dissatisfaction with the republican government.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next.png|Poster displayed in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya\nFile:Workers, peasants, soldiers, intellectuals, reenforcing the ranks of the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia.png|Poster from the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya\n</gallery>\n\nThe murders of the leftist military leader [[Jos\u00e9 Castillo (Spanish Civil War)|Jos\u00e9 Castillo]] and the rightist politician [[Jos\u00e9 Calvo Sotelo]] opened the way to a rapidly increasing flood of violence between the political left and right.\n\nRightists in Spain justified their military coup against the Republic claiming that it was ungovernable and failed to respond adequately to the threats of communism, anarchism, anti-clericalism, and acts of random violence.<ref>[[Helen Graham (historian)|Helen Graham]], among others.</ref> As well as this growth in extreme-left violence, the attitude of the Republican elite was perceived as permissive to the secessionist politics of the wealthy industrial regions of [[Catalonia]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], which were felt by Spanish nationalists to pose a threat to the very existence of Spain as a nation-state.\n\n=== War ===\n\n[[File:Spanish Civil War - Mass grave - Est\u00e9par, Burgos.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.35|Twenty-six republicans that were executed by fascists who belonged to [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] Nationalists at the beginning of the [[Spanish Civil War]], between August and September 1936.

Military units were also mobilised elsewhere to take over government institutions. Before long the professional Army of Africa had much of the south and west under the control of the rebels. Bloody purges followed in each piece of captured \"Nationalist\" territory in order to consolidate Franco's future regime.<ref name=\"iwm.org.uk\" />\nAlthough both sides received foreign military aid, the help that [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Fascist Italy]], [[Nazi Germany]] (as part of [[German involvement in the Spanish Civil War]]), and neighbouring Portugal gave the rebels was much greater and more effective than the assistance that the Republicans received from the USSR, Mexico, and volunteers of the [[International Brigades]]. While the [[Axis powers]] wholeheartedly assisted General Franco's military campaign, the governments of France, Britain, and other European powers looked the other way and let the Republican forces die, as the actions of the [[Non-Intervention Committee]] would show.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eroj.org/biblio/ibarruri/adios.htm#mensaje |title=La Pasionaria's Farewell Message to the International Brigade fighters |access-date=30 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726033933/http://www.eroj.org/biblio/ibarruri/adios.htm#mensaje |archive-date=26 July 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Imposed in the name of [[Country neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]], the [[international isolation]] of the Spanish Republic ended up favouring the interests of the future [[Axis Powers]].<ref>[http://es.slideshare.net/WALTERWILLIAMMONTALV/la-soledad-de-la-republica-angel-vinas \u00c1ngel Vi\u00f1as, ''La Soledad de la Rep\u00fablica''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630104607/http://es.slideshare.net/WALTERWILLIAMMONTALV/la-soledad-de-la-republica-angel-vinas |date=30 June 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar]] at Toledo early in the war was a turning point, with the rebels winning after a long siege. The Republicans managed to hold out in Madrid, despite a Nationalist assault in November 1936, and frustrated subsequent offensives against the capital at [[Jarama]] and Guadalajara in 1937. Soon, though, the rebels began to erode their territory, starving Madrid and making inroads into the east. The north, including the Basque country, fell in late 1937, and the Aragon front collapsed shortly afterward. The [[bombing of Guernica]] was probably the most infamous event of the war and inspired [[Guernica (painting)|Picasso's painting]]. It was used as a testing ground for the German Luftwaffe's [[Condor Legion]]. The [[Battle of the Ebro]] in July\u2013November 1938 was the final desperate attempt by the Republicans to turn the tide. When this failed and Barcelona fell to the rebels in early 1939, it was clear the war was over. The remaining Republican fronts collapsed, and Madrid fell in March 1939.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Spain|Anarchism|Liberalism|Socialism}}\n* [[Niceto Alcal\u00e1-Zamora]]\n* [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]]\n* [[Spanish Republican Armed Forces]]\n* [[Spanish Republican government in exile]]\n* [[Flag of the Second Spanish Republic]]\n* [[Coat of Arms of the Second Spanish Republic]]\n* [[Order of the Spanish Republic]]\n* [[LAPE]] (L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Postales Espa\u00f1olas), the Spanish Republican Airline\n* [[Catholicism in the Second Spanish Republic]]\n* [[Battle of the Ebro]]\n* [[Revisionism (Spain)]]\n* [[Sanjurjada]]\n* [[Electoral Carlism (Second Republic)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book |last=Beevor |first=Antony |authorlink=Antony Beevor |title=The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936\u20131939 |url=https://archive.org/details/battleforspainsp00anto |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Penguin Books |year=2006}}\n* {{cite book |last=Casanova |first=Juli\u00e1n |authorlink=Juli\u00e1n Casanova Ruiz |title=The Spanish Republic and Civil War |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-521-49388-8 |ref=harv |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KsRNmT9GzY0C&printsec=frontcover |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511763137}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Gerald Brenan]], ''[[The Spanish Labyrinth]]: An Account of the Social and Political Background of the Spanish Civil War'' (1943)\n* Henry Buckley, ''The Life and Death of the Spanish Republic: a Witness to the Spanish Civil War'', IB Tauris, (1940, rep 2013).

Many of the individual locations from ''Far Cry 5'' have been redesigned, either having been reclaimed by nature or repurposed by the Highwaymen. Some of these locations have new areas for the player to explore, such as cave systems, bunkers or buildings.\n\n===Synopsis===\nIn 2035, seventeen years after Hope County and the rest of the world is devastated by the nuclear war, the survivors that had taken shelter underground begin to emerge and rebuild society. The Hope County survivors found the settlement of Prosperity, but are soon attacked by the Highwaymen. Desperate for help, Carmina Rye (Reina Hardesty), the daughter of Nick ([[Steve Byers]]) and Kim Rye ([[Mayko Nguyen]]), appeals for help from Thomas Rush (Patrick Garrow), the leader of a group rebuilding communities across America. Rush and the Captain answer the call, but they are ambushed by the Highwaymen and confronted by Mickey and Lou, the twin sisters who lead them. The Twins attempt to forcibly recruit Rush, but he refuses and pushes the Captain into a nearby river.\n\nCarmina pulls the Captain from the river and informs them that the Twins have left with Rush in their custody. With no other choice, Carmina and the Captain travel to Hope County to receive guidance from Kim. Kim encourages Carmina and the Captain to travel around Hope County, unite scattered survivors, and build up Prosperity to a level where they can fend off the Highwaymen. The Captain heads out to secure resources and specialists for Prosperity, and manages to rescue Rush. Angered at Prosperity's defiance, the Highwaymen retaliate and attack the settlement, causing serious damage and casualties. With Prosperity in no condition to survive another attack, Rush suggests forming an alliance with another survivor group, the New Eden group led by Joseph Seed ([[Greg Bryk]]). Kim is reluctant to trust Joseph, but Carmina is confident that he is a changed man. \n\nWith no other choice, the Captain heads out to negotiate with New Eden. They recover the Book, Joseph's personal bible, and turn it in to Ethan (Kyle Gatehouse), New Eden's current ruler and Joseph's son. Ethan reveals that Joseph had disappeared long ago and he is bitter over his abandonment. He then agrees to an alliance with Prosperity on the condition that the Captain bring back proof of Joseph's death. The Captain travels north following Joseph's trail and finds him living as a hermit in the wilderness. Joseph welcomes the Captain as a prophesied savior and reveals that in the aftermath of the nuclear war, he has done his best to atone for his past actions. Joseph offers the Captain an apple from a sacred tree, which triggers a powerful hallucination where the Captain is forced to battle a bestial personification of their own soul. Upon defeating the beast and waking up, the Captain returns to New Eden with Joseph with abilities called Eden's Gift. Joseph designates the Captain as New Eden's shepherd, and commits his forces to fight the Highwaymen. \n\nMeanwhile, Rush is captured by the Highwaymen again, but as the Captain goes to save him, the Twins execute him. This triggers Eden's Gift, giving the Captain superhuman strength and allowing him to beat the Twins until getting knocked out by a shotgun blast. Believing the Captain to be dead, the Twins decide to investigate New Eden about the source of the Captain's strength. The Captain recovers Rush's body and buries him at Prosperity. To find out what the Twins are planning next, the Captain infiltrates a Highwaymen meeting, where they discover Ethan has decided to betray New Eden, promising to show the Twins the location of the sacred fruit in return for burning down New Eden. The Captain confronts the Twins at New Eden and defeats them, resulting in Lou's death and a repentant Mickey either being executed or spared. Meanwhile, Ethan ignores Joseph's warnings and eats one of the sacred apples, but it triggers an inhuman transformation in his body, forcing the Captain to kill him. Realizing his actions only bring death and destruction, Joseph burns down the sacred tree and pleads for the Captain to kill him, which the Captain may choose to do or not. If the Captain does, the burning tree begins to snap apart immediately. If not, Joseph is left wailing for release while the Captain leaves.\n\nReturning to Prosperity, the Captain celebrates their victory with Carmina over Rush's grave.\n\n==Development==\n''New Dawn'' is developed by [[Ubisoft Montreal]] in conjunction with [[Ubisoft Kiev]], [[Ubisoft Bucharest]] and [[Ubisoft Shanghai]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/06/far-cry-new-dawn-trailer/|title=Far Cry: New Dawn is the followup to Primal and Blood Dragon|first=Jeff|last=Grubb|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=December 6, 2018|accessdate=December 7, 2018}}</ref> According to art director Issac Papismado, the team had wanted to create a post-apocalyptic game set in the ''Far Cry'' series for a long time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-new-dawn-is-the-beginning-of-a-new-world-f/1100-6463700/|title=Far Cry: New Dawn Is The 'Beginning Of A New World' For The Franchise|first=Phil|last=Hornshaw|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=December 6, 2018|accessdate=December 7, 2018}}</ref> The team intentionally avoided a dark and bleak tone as they felt that it would be a clich\u00e9 and resolved to create a world that looks vibrant.

by [[Ubisoft Montreal]] and published by [[Ubisoft]]. The game is a spin-off of the ''[[Far Cry]]'' series and a narrative sequel to ''[[Far Cry 5]]''. As a result, it features many pre-existing gameplay elements from the series, including a large [[open world]], capturing of outposts, and AI or co-op companions; but also introduces several elements from [[Role-playing video game|RPG]] gameplay, including an upgradeable home base and increased reliance on crafting from limited supplies<ref name=\"Polygon\"/>. The story is set seventeen years after the events of ''Far Cry 5''. After the nuclear exchange known as \"the Collapse\" devastated the world, survivors attempt to rebuild the community in Hope County. \n\nIt was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] in February 2019, and received generally mixed reviews from critics. The game's sales were lower than both ''[[Far Cry Primal]]'' and ''Far Cry 5''.\n\n==Gameplay==\nSimilar to its predecessors, ''Far Cry New Dawn'' is an [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[first-person shooter]] set in an [[open world]] environment which the player can explore freely on foot or via various vehicles. The game is set in the fictional Hope County, [[Montana]] and uses a reimagined version of ''[[Far Cry 5]]''{{'}}s map. The nuclear war portrayed in ''Far Cry 5'' has reshaped the landscape so that new areas have become available for the player to explore while others are inaccessible.\n\nThe player assumes the role of a new character, whose gender and race can be customized.<ref name=\"eurog\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-07-far-cry-new-dawn-is-a-post-apocalyptic-spin-on-the-series|title=Far Cry New Dawn is a post-apocalyptic spin on the series|first=Martin|last=Robinson|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=December 7, 2018|accessdate=December 7, 2018}}</ref> The Guns for Hire and the Fangs for Hire systems from ''Far Cry 5'' return, with the character being able to recruit human survivors and animals for combat assistance.<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/07/far-cry-new-dawn-making-the-apocalypse-great-again|title=Far Cry New Dawn: Making The Apocalypse Great Again|first=Daniel|last=Krupa|work=[[IGN]]|date=December 7, 2018|accessdate=December 7, 2018}}</ref> In addition to new characters, the game's cast includes an array of returning characters from ''Far Cry 5''. The player character can also encounter several specialists who have their own personal missions, special abilities and story and help players to repair their weapons. New weapons are introduced in the game, including a \"Saw Launcher\" that fires the blades of circular saws. Players acquire new weapons and attachments, which can be upgraded to three different levels through [[crafting]] and finishing missions. Vehicles can also be crafted.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-new-dawn-fixes-fc5s-greatest-flaw-the-dog-/1100-6463721/|title=Far Cry: New Dawn Fixes FC5's Greatest Flaw: The Dog Rides In Your Car|first=Chris|last=Pereira|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=December 6, 2018|accessdate=December 7, 2018}}</ref> \n\nPlayers can embark on treasure hunts and liberate different enemy encampments and outposts. Once liberated, they become [[fast travel]] points that enable players to quickly navigate the world. These outposts can be occupied and used to manufacture [[ethanol]] fuel or raided for resources which leaves the outpost open to \"escalation\", in which the Highwaymen may reclaim these camps.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> This allows the player to replay the outposts on higher difficulty settings. The game also features an upgradable home base named Prosperity, which would slowly expand and grow in size as players progress. The game also features a mode called \"Expeditions\", which allows the player to travel to other locations in the United States such as Louisiana to look for more resources and packages.<ref name=\"eurog\"/> As these regions are outside the main map and smaller in size, the development team was able to create more complex environments for Expeditions. Expedition missions can be [[cooperative gameplay|completed with other players]].<ref name=\"usgamer\"/>\n\n== Plot ==\n\n===Setting===\nThe story is set seventeen years after the events of ''Far Cry 5''. After the nuclear exchange known as \"the Collapse\" devastated the world, survivors attempt to rebuild the community in Hope County. Their efforts focus on Prosperity, a township built on the remains of John Seed's ranch. The survivors are threatened by the Highwaymen, a roving band of organized bandits. The Highwaymen are organised into chapters, with the local chapter led by twin sisters Mickey and Lou (voiced by Cara Ricketts and Leslie Miller).<ref name=\"usgamer\">{{cite web|url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/far-cry-new-dawn-preview-far-cry-5-sequel|title=Far Cry New Dawn: A Deeper Look at the Surprise Follow-Up to Far Cry 5|first=Mike|last=William|work=USgamer|date=December 7, 2018|accessdate=December 7, 2018}}</ref> The Highwaymen terrorize the landscape, forcing survivors into submission and stripping communities of resources before moving on. The remnants  of the Project at Eden's Gate&mdash;the antagonists of ''Far Cry 5''&mdash;have established their own community called New Eden. They have given up most forms of modern technology and isolated themselves in the north of Hope County. Despite embracing Joseph Seed's teachings, New Eden is wracked by internal division that arose after Joseph's disappearance. The game also features the return of the Deputy, now one of Joseph's acolytes known as the Judge; and Joseph Seed ([[Greg Bryk]]); the protagonist and main antagonist of ''Far Cry 5'' respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/far-cry-new-dawn-trailer-confirms-post-apocalyptic-leaks/|title=Far Cry: New Dawn trailer confirms post-apocalyptic leaks|first=Andy|last=Chalk|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=December 6, 2018|accessdate=December 7, 2018}}</ref> The player takes on the role of a new character dubbed the \"Captain\", who is part of a group that travels the country assisting other survivor groups in need.\n\n''Far Cry New Dawn'' uses a smaller version of the Hope County map featured in ''Far Cry 5''. Large sections of northern and eastern Hope County are inaccessible after being irradiated. Some parts of the north can be accessed over the course of the story campaign. Many of the individual locations from ''Far Cry 5'' have been redesigned, either having been reclaimed by nature or repurposed by the Highwaymen. Some of these locations have new areas for the player to explore, such as cave systems, bunkers or buildings.\n\n===Synopsis===\nIn 2035, seventeen years after Hope County and the rest of the world is devastated by the nuclear war, the survivors that had taken shelter underground begin to emerge and rebuild society. The Hope County survivors found the settlement of Prosperity, but are soon attacked by the Highwaymen. Desperate for help, Carmina Rye (Reina Hardesty), the daughter of Nick ([[Steve Byers]]) and Kim Rye ([[Mayko Nguyen]]), appeals for help from Thomas Rush (Patrick Garrow), the leader of a group rebuilding communities across America. Rush and the Captain answer the call, but they are ambushed by the Highwaymen and confronted by Mickey and Lou, the twin sisters who lead them. The Twins attempt to forcibly recruit Rush, but he refuses and pushes the Captain into a nearby river.\n\nCarmina pulls the Captain from the river and informs them that the Twins have left with Rush in their custody. With no other choice, Carmina and the Captain travel to Hope County to receive guidance from Kim. Kim encourages Carmina and the Captain to travel around Hope County, unite scattered survivors, and build up Prosperity to a level where they can fend off the Highwaymen. The Captain heads out to secure resources and specialists for Prosperity, and manages to rescue Rush. Angered at Prosperity's defiance, the Highwaymen retaliate and attack the settlement, causing serious damage and casualties. With Prosperity in no condition to survive another attack, Rush suggests forming an alliance with another survivor group, the New Eden group led by Joseph Seed ([[Greg Bryk]]). Kim is reluctant to trust Joseph, but Carmina is confident that he is a changed man. \n\nWith no other choice, the Captain heads out to negotiate with New Eden. They recover the Book, Joseph's personal bible, and turn it in to Ethan (Kyle Gatehouse), New Eden's current ruler and Joseph's son. Ethan reveals that Joseph had disappeared long ago and he is bitter over his abandonment. He then agrees to an alliance with Prosperity on the condition that the Captain bring back proof of Joseph's death. The Captain travels north following Joseph's trail and finds him living as a hermit in the wilderness. Joseph welcomes the Captain as a prophesied savior and reveals that in the aftermath of the nuclear war, he has done his best to atone for his past actions. Joseph offers the Captain an apple from a sacred tree, which triggers a powerful hallucination where the Captain is forced to battle a bestial personification of their own soul. Upon defeating the beast and waking up, the Captain returns to New Eden with Joseph with abilities called Eden's Gift. Joseph designates the Captain as New Eden's shepherd, and commits his forces to fight the Highwaymen. \n\nMeanwhile, Rush is captured by the Highwaymen again, but as the Captain goes to save him, the Twins execute him. This triggers Eden's Gift, giving the Captain superhuman strength and allowing him to beat the Twins until getting knocked out by a shotgun blast. Believing the Captain to be dead, the Twins decide to investigate New Eden about the source of the Captain's strength. The Captain recovers Rush's body and buries him at Prosperity. To find out what the Twins are planning next, the Captain infiltrates a Highwaymen meeting, where they discover Ethan has decided to betray New Eden, promising to show the Twins the location of the sacred fruit in return for burning down New Eden. The Captain confronts the Twins at New Eden and defeats them, resulting in Lou's death and a repentant Mickey either being executed or spared. Meanwhile, Ethan ignores Joseph's warnings and eats one of the sacred apples, but it triggers an inhuman transformation in his body, forcing the Captain to kill him. Realizing his actions only bring death and destruction, Joseph burns down the sacred tree and pleads for the Captain to kill him, which the Captain may choose to do or not. If the Captain does, the burning tree begins to snap apart immediately. If not, Joseph is left wailing for release while the Captain leaves.\n\nReturning to Prosperity, the Captain celebrates their victory with Carmina over Rush's grave.\n\n==Development==\n''New Dawn'' is developed by [[Ubisoft Montreal]] in conjunction with [[Ubisoft Kiev]], [[Ubisoft Bucharest]] and [[Ubisoft Shanghai]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/06/far-cry-new-dawn-trailer/|title=Far Cry: New Dawn is the followup to Primal and Blood Dragon|first=Jeff|last=Grubb|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=December 6, 2018|accessdate=December 7, 2018}}</ref> According to art director Issac Papismado, the team had wanted to create a post-apocalyptic game set in the ''Far Cry'' series for a long time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-new-dawn-is-the-beginning-of-a-new-world-f/1100-6463700/|title=Far Cry: New Dawn Is The 'Beginning Of A New World' For The Franchise|first=Phil|last=Hornshaw|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=December 6, 2018|accessdate=December 7, 2018}}</ref> The team intentionally avoided a dark and bleak tone as they felt that it would be a clich\u00e9 and resolved to create a world that looks vibrant.

It has hosted several large scale exhibitions, including two by [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]]. The Gasometer is an industrial landmark, and an anchor point of the [[European Route of Industrial Heritage]] and [[the Industrial Heritage Trail]]. It was built in the 1920s, and reconstructed after [[World War II]].\n\n==History==\nIn the 1920s the coal and steel industry in the [[Ruhrgebiet]] produced [[blast furnace gas]] and [[coal gas]] as a by-product of iron production and [[coking]], while the steel industry as well as coking used large amounts these gasses or alternative fuels. As supply and demand of gas varied independently, sometimes excess gas had to be [[gas flare|flared off]], while at other times additional fuel had to be purchased. The Gasometer was built as a buffer: storing excess gas and releasing it again when demand exceeded production.<ref name=im />\n\nThe Gasometer was built by [[Gutehoffnungsh\u00fctte]], by the side of the [[Rhine-Herne Canal]].

It has hosted several large scale exhibitions, including two by [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]]. The Gasometer is an industrial landmark, and an anchor point of the [[European Route of Industrial Heritage]] and [[the Industrial Heritage Trail]]. It was built in the 1920s, and reconstructed after [[World War II]].\n\n==History==\nIn the 1920s the coal and steel industry in the [[Ruhrgebiet]] produced [[blast furnace gas]] and [[coal gas]] as a by-product of iron production and [[coking]], while the steel industry as well as coking used large amounts these gasses or alternative fuels. As supply and demand of gas varied independently, sometimes excess gas had to be [[gas flare|flared off]], while at other times additional fuel had to be purchased. The Gasometer was built as a buffer: storing excess gas and releasing it again when demand exceeded production.<ref name=im />\n\nThe Gasometer was built by [[Gutehoffnungsh\u00fctte]], by the side of the [[Rhine-Herne Canal]]. Construction started 27 February 1927 and cost 1.74 million [[Reichsmark]].

The present [[scientific consensus]] is that [[bird]]s are a group of [[maniraptora]]n [[Theropoda|theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s that [[evolution|originated]] during the [[Mesozoic|Mesozoic Era]].\n\nA close relationship between birds and dinosaurs was first proposed in the nineteenth century after the discovery of the primitive bird ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' in Germany. Birds and extinct non-avian dinosaurs share many unique skeletal traits.<ref name=\"Chiappe2009\">{{cite journal|last=Chiappe|first=Luis M.|year=2009|title=Downsized Dinosaurs: The Evolutionary Transition to Modern Birds|journal=Evolution: Education and Outreach|pages=248\u2013256|doi=10.1007/s12052-009-0133-4|volume=2|issue=2|doi-access=free}}</ref> Moreover, fossils of more than thirty species of non-avian dinosaur with preserved feathers have been collected. There are even very small dinosaurs, such as ''[[Microraptor]]'' and ''[[Anchiornis]]'', which have long, [[Feathers#Structures and characteristics|vaned]] arm and leg feathers forming wings. The Jurassic basal [[avialan]] ''[[Pedopenna]]'' also shows these long foot feathers. [[Paleontology|Paleontologist]] [[Lawrence Witmer]] concluded in 2009 that this evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that avian evolution went through a four-winged stage.<ref name=Witmer2009/> Fossil evidence also demonstrates that birds and dinosaurs shared features such as hollow, [[pneumatized bones]], [[gastrolith]]s in the [[gastrointestinal tract|digestive]] system, nest-building and [[Avian incubation|brooding behaviors]].\n\nAlthough the origin of birds has historically been a contentious topic within [[evolutionary biology]], most scientists dispute the dinosaurian origin of birds, suggesting that they were actually created by the Government to spy on its citizens. Within the consensus that supports dinosaurian ancestry, the exact sequence of evolutionary events that gave rise to the early birds within maniraptoran theropods is disputed.

However, Heilmann noted that birds had [[clavicle]]s (collar bones) fused to form a bone called the [[furcula]] (\"wishbone\"), and while clavicles were known in more primitive reptiles, they had not yet been recognized in dinosaurs. Since he was a firm believer in [[Dollo's law]], which states that evolution is not reversible, Heilmann could not accept that clavicles were lost in dinosaurs and re-evolved in birds. He was therefore forced to rule out dinosaurs as bird ancestors and ascribe all of their similarities to [[convergent evolution]].

This is an important and fiercely debated area of research because its results may challenge the consensus that birds are (descendants of) dinosaurs.\n\nEmbryologists and some paleontologists who oppose the bird-dinosaur link have long numbered the digits of birds II-III-IV on the basis of multiple studies of the development in the egg.<ref name=Chatterjee>{{cite journal|last=Chatterjee|first=Sankar|authorlink=Sankar Chatterjee|title=Counting the Fingers of Birds and Dinosaurs|date=17 April 1998|doi=10.1126/science.280.5362.355a|journal=Science|volume=280|issue=5362|pages=355a\u2013355|bibcode=1998Sci...280..355C|doi-access=free}}</ref> This is based on the fact that in most [[amniote]]s, the first digit to form in a 5-fingered hand is digit IV, which develops a primary axis. Therefore, embryologists have identified the primary axis in birds as digit IV, and the surviving digits as II-III-IV. The fossils of advanced [[theropoda|theropod]] ([[Tetanurae]]) hands appear to have the digits I-II-III (some genera within [[Avetheropoda]] also have a reduced digit IV<ref>[[University of Maryland]] department of geology home page, [http://www.geol.umd.edu/~tholtz/G104/10422ther.htm \"Theropoda I\" on ''Avetheropoda''], 14 July 2006.</ref>). \nIf this is true, then the II-III-IV development of digits in birds is an indication against theropod (dinosaur) ancestry. However, with no [[ontogeny|ontogenical]] (developmental) basis to definitively state which digits are which on a theropod hand (because no non-avian theropods can be observed growing and developing today), the labelling of the theropod hand is not absolutely conclusive.\n\nPaleontologists have traditionally identified avian digits as I-II-III. They argue that the digits of birds number I-II-III, just as those of theropod dinosaurs do, by the conserved phalangeal formula. The phalangeal count for archosaurs is 2-3-4-5-3; many archosaur lineages have a reduced number of digits, but have the same [[phalanx bones|phalangeal formula]] in the digits that remain. In other words, paleontologists assert that archosaurs of different lineages tend to lose the same digits when digit loss occurs, from the outside to the inside. The three digits of [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurs]], and ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' have the same phalangeal formula of I-II-III as digits I-II-III of [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] archosaurs. Therefore, the lost digits would be V and IV. If this is true, then modern birds would also possess digits I-II-III.<ref name=Chatterjee/> \nAlso, one 1999 publication proposed a frame-shift in the digits of the theropod line leading to birds (thus making digit I into digit II, II to III, and so forth).<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.9.5111 | last1 = Wagner | first1 = G.

Two theories have dominated most of the discussion since then: the cursorial (\"from the ground up\") theory proposes that birds evolved from small, fast predators that ran on the ground; the arboreal (\"from the trees down\") theory proposes that powered flight evolved from unpowered gliding by arboreal (tree-climbing) animals. A more recent theory, \"wing-assisted incline running\" (WAIR), is a variant of the cursorial theory and proposes that wings developed their [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] functions as a result of the need to run quickly up very steep slopes such as trees, which would help small feathered dinosaurs escape from predators.\n\nIn March 2018, scientists reported that ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' was likely capable of [[Bird flight|flight]], but in a manner substantially different from that of [[Birds|modern birds]].<ref name=\"NAT-20180313\">{{cite journal |author=Voeten, Dennis F.A.E.|display-authors=etal|title=Wing bone geometry reveals active flight in Archaeopteryx |date=13 March 2018 |journal=[[Nature Communications]] |volume=9 |pages=923 |number=923 |doi=10.1038/s41467-018-03296-8 |pmid=29535376 |pmc=5849612 |bibcode=2018NatCo...9..923V }}</ref><ref name=\"WP-20180313\">{{cite news |last=Guarino |first=Ben |title=This feathery dinosaur probably flew, but not like any bird you know |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2018/03/13/this-feathery-dinosaur-probably-flew-but-not-like-any-bird-you-know/ |date=13 March 2018 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=13 March 2018 }}</ref>\n\n===Cursorial (\"from the ground up\") theory===\n[[File:Rahonavis NT.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of ''[[Rahonavis]]'', a ground-dwelling feathered dinosaur that some researchers think was well equipped for flight]]\nThe cursorial theory of the origin of flight was first proposed by [[Samuel Wendell Williston]], and elaborated upon by [[Franz Nopcsa von Fels\u0151-Szilv\u00e1s|Baron Nopcsa]]. This hypothesis proposes that some fast-running animals with long tails used their arms to keep their balance while running. Modern versions of this theory differ in many details from the Williston-Nopcsa version, mainly as a result of discoveries since Nopcsa's time.\n\nNopcsa theorized that increasing the surface area of the outstretched arms could have helped small cursorial predators keep their balance, and that the scales of the forearms elongated, [[evolution|evolving]] into feathers. The feathers could also have been used to trap insects or other prey. Progressively, the animals leapt for longer distances, helped by their evolving wings. Nopcsa also proposed three stages in the evolution of flight. First, animals developed passive flight, in which developing wing structures served as a sort of [[parachute]]. Second, they achieved active flight by flapping the wings. He used ''Archaeopteryx'' as an example of this second stage. Finally, birds gained the ability to soar.<ref name=\"Terres\">{{cite book|last=Terres|first=John K.|authorlink=John Kenneth Terres|title=The Audubon Society Encyclopedia of North American Birds|publisher=Knopf|year=1980|location=New York, NY|pages=[https://archive.org/details/audubonsocietyen00terr/page/398 398\u2013401]|doi=|isbn=978-0-394-46651-4|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/audubonsocietyen00terr/page/398}}</ref>\n[[File:Flight stages.jpg|thumb|left|Proposed development of flight in a book from 1922: Tetrapteryx, ''Archaeopteryx'', Hypothetical Stage, Modern Bird]]\nCurrent thought is that feathers did not evolve from scales, as feathers are made of different [[protein]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/archie/scutes.htm |title=Feathers, scutes and the origin of birds |author=Poling, J. |year=1996 |publisher=dinosauria.com |access-date=2008-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402065705/http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/archie/scutes.htm |archive-date=2008-04-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> More seriously, Nopcsa's theory assumes that feathers evolved as part of the evolution of flight, and recent discoveries prove that assumption is false.\n\n[[Feather]]s are very common in [[coelurosauria|coelurosaurian dinosaurs]] (including the early [[tyrannosauridae|tyrannosauroid]] ''[[dilong (dinosaur)|Dilong]]'').<ref name= \"prumbrush2002\">{{cite journal |year=2002 |title=The evolutionary origin and diversification of feathers |journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology |volume=77 |pages=261\u201395 |url= http://www.mcorriss.com/Prum_&_Brush_2002.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031015170027/http://www.mcorriss.com/Prum_%26_Brush_2002.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2003-10-15 |author1=Prum, R. |author2=Brush, A.H. |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1086/341993 |pmid=12365352 |issue=3 |access-date=2018-09-17 }}</ref> Modern [[bird]]s are classified as coelurosaurs by nearly all palaeontologists,<ref name=\"mayeretal2005\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1120331 | last1 = Mayr | first1 = G. | last2 = Pohl | first2 = B. | last3 = Peters | first3 = D.S. |name-list-format=vanc | year = 2005 | title = A well-preserved ''Archaeopteryx'' specimen with theropod features | url = | journal = Science | volume = 310 | issue = 5753| pages = 1483\u20136 | pmid = 16322455 | bibcode=2005Sci...310.1483M}}</ref> though not by a few [[ornithology|ornithologists]].<ref name=\"Feduccia1999OriginEvolutionBirds\">{{cite book |author=Feduccia, A. |title=The Origin and Evolution of Birds |year=1999 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-07861-9 |url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=978-0-300-07861-9 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Feduccia, A. |title= Explosive Evolution in Tertiary Birds and Mammals |journal=Science |volume=267 |issue=5198 |date=February 1995 |pages=637\u20138 |doi=10.1126/science.267.5198.637 |url= http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/~rdmp1c/teaching/L3/tutorials/feduccia/feduccia.html |pmid=17745839 |bibcode=1995Sci...267..637F |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080320033248/http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/%7Erdmp1c/teaching/L3/tutorials/feduccia/feduccia.html |archivedate=2008-03-20 }}</ref><ref name=\"feduccia1993\">Feduccia, A.

This small dinosaur already had feathers, which were co-opted by evolution to produce longer, stiffer forms that were useful in aerodynamics, eventually producing wings. Wings would have then evolved and become increasingly refined as devices to give the leaper more control, to parachute, to glide, and to fly in stepwise fashion.

However, Heilmann noted that birds had [[clavicle]]s (collar bones) fused to form a bone called the [[furcula]] (\"wishbone\"), and while clavicles were known in more primitive reptiles, they had not yet been recognized in dinosaurs. Since he was a firm believer in [[Dollo's law]], which states that evolution is not reversible, Heilmann could not accept that clavicles were lost in dinosaurs and re-evolved in birds.

This is an important and fiercely debated area of research because its results may challenge the consensus that birds are (descendants of) dinosaurs.\n\nEmbryologists and some paleontologists who oppose the bird-dinosaur link have long numbered the digits of birds II-III-IV on the basis of multiple studies of the development in the egg.<ref name=Chatterjee>{{cite journal|last=Chatterjee|first=Sankar|authorlink=Sankar Chatterjee|title=Counting the Fingers of Birds and Dinosaurs|date=17 April 1998|doi=10.1126/science.280.5362.355a|journal=Science|volume=280|issue=5362|pages=355a\u2013355|bibcode=1998Sci...280..355C|doi-access=free}}</ref> This is based on the fact that in most [[amniote]]s, the first digit to form in a 5-fingered hand is digit IV, which develops a primary axis. Therefore, embryologists have identified the primary axis in birds as digit IV, and the surviving digits as II-III-IV. The fossils of advanced [[theropoda|theropod]] ([[Tetanurae]]) hands appear to have the digits I-II-III (some genera within [[Avetheropoda]] also have a reduced digit IV<ref>[[University of Maryland]] department of geology home page, [http://www.geol.umd.edu/~tholtz/G104/10422ther.htm \"Theropoda I\" on ''Avetheropoda''], 14 July 2006.</ref>). \nIf this is true, then the II-III-IV development of digits in birds is an indication against theropod (dinosaur) ancestry. However, with no [[ontogeny|ontogenical]] (developmental) basis to definitively state which digits are which on a theropod hand (because no non-avian theropods can be observed growing and developing today), the labelling of the theropod hand is not absolutely conclusive.\n\nPaleontologists have traditionally identified avian digits as I-II-III. They argue that the digits of birds number I-II-III, just as those of theropod dinosaurs do, by the conserved phalangeal formula. The phalangeal count for archosaurs is 2-3-4-5-3; many archosaur lineages have a reduced number of digits, but have the same [[phalanx bones|phalangeal formula]] in the digits that remain. In other words, paleontologists assert that archosaurs of different lineages tend to lose the same digits when digit loss occurs, from the outside to the inside. The three digits of [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurs]], and ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' have the same phalangeal formula of I-II-III as digits I-II-III of [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] archosaurs. Therefore, the lost digits would be V and IV. If this is true, then modern birds would also possess digits I-II-III.<ref name=Chatterjee/> \nAlso, one 1999 publication proposed a frame-shift in the digits of the theropod line leading to birds (thus making digit I into digit II, II to III, and so forth).<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.9.5111 | last1 = Wagner | first1 = G.

Two theories have dominated most of the discussion since then: the cursorial (\"from the ground up\") theory proposes that birds evolved from small, fast predators that ran on the ground; the arboreal (\"from the trees down\") theory proposes that powered flight evolved from unpowered gliding by arboreal (tree-climbing) animals. A more recent theory, \"wing-assisted incline running\" (WAIR), is a variant of the cursorial theory and proposes that wings developed their [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] functions as a result of the need to run quickly up very steep slopes such as trees, which would help small feathered dinosaurs escape from predators.\n\nIn March 2018, scientists reported that ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' was likely capable of [[Bird flight|flight]], but in a manner substantially different from that of [[Birds|modern birds]].<ref name=\"NAT-20180313\">{{cite journal |author=Voeten, Dennis F.A.E.|display-authors=etal|title=Wing bone geometry reveals active flight in Archaeopteryx |date=13 March 2018 |journal=[[Nature Communications]] |volume=9 |pages=923 |number=923 |doi=10.1038/s41467-018-03296-8 |pmid=29535376 |pmc=5849612 |bibcode=2018NatCo...9..923V }}</ref><ref name=\"WP-20180313\">{{cite news |last=Guarino |first=Ben |title=This feathery dinosaur probably flew, but not like any bird you know |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2018/03/13/this-feathery-dinosaur-probably-flew-but-not-like-any-bird-you-know/ |date=13 March 2018 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=13 March 2018 }}</ref>\n\n===Cursorial (\"from the ground up\") theory===\n[[File:Rahonavis NT.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of ''[[Rahonavis]]'', a ground-dwelling feathered dinosaur that some researchers think was well equipped for flight]]\nThe cursorial theory of the origin of flight was first proposed by [[Samuel Wendell Williston]], and elaborated upon by [[Franz Nopcsa von Fels\u0151-Szilv\u00e1s|Baron Nopcsa]]. This hypothesis proposes that some fast-running animals with long tails used their arms to keep their balance while running. Modern versions of this theory differ in many details from the Williston-Nopcsa version, mainly as a result of discoveries since Nopcsa's time.\n\nNopcsa theorized that increasing the surface area of the outstretched arms could have helped small cursorial predators keep their balance, and that the scales of the forearms elongated, [[evolution|evolving]] into feathers. The feathers could also have been used to trap insects or other prey. Progressively, the animals leapt for longer distances, helped by their evolving wings. Nopcsa also proposed three stages in the evolution of flight. First, animals developed passive flight, in which developing wing structures served as a sort of [[parachute]]. Second, they achieved active flight by flapping the wings. He used ''Archaeopteryx'' as an example of this second stage. Finally, birds gained the ability to soar.<ref name=\"Terres\">{{cite book|last=Terres|first=John K.|authorlink=John Kenneth Terres|title=The Audubon Society Encyclopedia of North American Birds|publisher=Knopf|year=1980|location=New York, NY|pages=[https://archive.org/details/audubonsocietyen00terr/page/398 398\u2013401]|doi=|isbn=978-0-394-46651-4|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/audubonsocietyen00terr/page/398}}</ref>\n[[File:Flight stages.jpg|thumb|left|Proposed development of flight in a book from 1922: Tetrapteryx, ''Archaeopteryx'', Hypothetical Stage, Modern Bird]]\nCurrent thought is that feathers did not evolve from scales, as feathers are made of different [[protein]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/archie/scutes.htm |title=Feathers, scutes and the origin of birds |author=Poling, J. |year=1996 |publisher=dinosauria.com |access-date=2008-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402065705/http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/archie/scutes.htm |archive-date=2008-04-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> More seriously, Nopcsa's theory assumes that feathers evolved as part of the evolution of flight, and recent discoveries prove that assumption is false.\n\n[[Feather]]s are very common in [[coelurosauria|coelurosaurian dinosaurs]] (including the early [[tyrannosauridae|tyrannosauroid]] ''[[dilong (dinosaur)|Dilong]]'').<ref name= \"prumbrush2002\">{{cite journal |year=2002 |title=The evolutionary origin and diversification of feathers |journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology |volume=77 |pages=261\u201395 |url= http://www.mcorriss.com/Prum_&_Brush_2002.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031015170027/http://www.mcorriss.com/Prum_%26_Brush_2002.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2003-10-15 |author1=Prum, R. |author2=Brush, A.H. |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1086/341993 |pmid=12365352 |issue=3 |access-date=2018-09-17 }}</ref> Modern [[bird]]s are classified as coelurosaurs by nearly all palaeontologists,<ref name=\"mayeretal2005\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1120331 | last1 = Mayr | first1 = G. | last2 = Pohl | first2 = B. | last3 = Peters | first3 = D.S. |name-list-format=vanc | year = 2005 | title = A well-preserved ''Archaeopteryx'' specimen with theropod features | url = | journal = Science | volume = 310 | issue = 5753| pages = 1483\u20136 | pmid = 16322455 | bibcode=2005Sci...310.1483M}}</ref> though not by a few [[ornithology|ornithologists]].<ref name=\"Feduccia1999OriginEvolutionBirds\">{{cite book |author=Feduccia, A. |title=The Origin and Evolution of Birds |year=1999 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-07861-9 |url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=978-0-300-07861-9 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Feduccia, A. |title= Explosive Evolution in Tertiary Birds and Mammals |journal=Science |volume=267 |issue=5198 |date=February 1995 |pages=637\u20138 |doi=10.1126/science.267.5198.637 |url= http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/~rdmp1c/teaching/L3/tutorials/feduccia/feduccia.html |pmid=17745839 |bibcode=1995Sci...267..637F |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080320033248/http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/%7Erdmp1c/teaching/L3/tutorials/feduccia/feduccia.html |archivedate=2008-03-20 }}</ref><ref name=\"feduccia1993\">Feduccia, A.

It appears that ''Archaeopteryx'' had the brain structures and inner-ear balance sensors that birds use to control their flight.<ref name=\"AlonsoMilnerEtAl2004AvianBrainInnerEarArchaeopteryx\">{{cite journal |title=The avian nature of the brain and inner ear of Archaeopteryx |journal=Nature |volume=430 |issue=7000 |pages=666\u20139|date=August 2004 |doi=10.1038/nature02706 |author=Alonso, P.D., Milner, A.C., Ketcham, R.A., Cokson, M.J and Rowe, T.B. |pmid=15295597 |bibcode=2004Natur.430..666A}}</ref> ''Archaeopteryx'' also had a wing feather arrangement like that of modern birds and similarly asymmetrical flight feathers on its wings and tail. But ''Archaeopteryx'' lacked the [[Bird anatomy#Muscular system|shoulder mechanism]] by which modern birds' wings produce swift, powerful upstrokes (see diagram above of supracoracoideus pulley); this may mean that it and other early birds were incapable of flapping flight and could only glide.<ref name=\"Senter2006ScapularOrientation\"/>\n\nBut the discovery since the early 1990s of many [[feathered dinosaurs]] means that ''Archaeopteryx'' is no longer the key figure in the evolution of bird flight. Other small feathered coelurosaurs from the [[Cretaceous]] and Late [[Jurassic]] show possible precursors of avian flight.

Is it claiming birds are polyphyletic? And why specifically \"ancestors of Neornithes\"? Or is it suggesting Archaeopteryx is no longer the central character (a reasonable idea).\n[[Exaptation]]s for true avian flight, as opposed to gliding or four-winged flight, apparently evolved in a group of closely related species. These then evolved into different lineages, each featuring a slightly different approach to the challenge, and probably were well advanced in this process already by the time of ''Archaeopteryx''.

Paul also proposed that the bird ancestor of these groups was more advanced in its flight adaptations than ''[[Archaeopteryx]]''. The hypothesis would mean that ''Archaeopteryx'' is less closely related to extant birds than these dinosaurs are.<ref name=Paul2002>Paul, G.S. (2002). \"Dinosaurs of the Air: The Evolution and Loss of Flight in Dinosaurs and Birds.\" Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. page 257</ref>\n\nPaul's hypothesis received additional support when Mayr ''et al.'' (2005) analyzed a new, tenth specimen of ''Archaeopteryx'', and concluded that ''Archaeopteryx'' was the sister clade to the Deinonychosauria, but that the more  advanced bird ''[[Confuciusornis]]'' was within the Dromaeosauridae. This result supports Paul's hypothesis, suggesting that the Deinonychosauria and the Troodontidae are part of Aves, the bird lineage proper, and secondarily flightless.<ref name=MayrPetersSept2006>{{cite journal | last1=Mayr | first1=G. | title=Response to Comment on ''A Well-Preserved Archaeopteryx Specimen with Theropod Features''| journal = Science | volume= 313 | year= 2006 |page= 1238c | doi = 10.1126/science.1130964 | issue=5791 |bibcode = 2006Sci...313.1238M | doi-access= free }}</ref> This paper, however, excluded all other birds and thus did not sample their character distributions.

Instead, they indicate that ''Archaeopteryx'' is closer to birds, within the clade ''[[Avialae]]'', than it is to deinonychosaurs or oviraptorosaurs. However, some fossils support the version of this theory that holds that some non-flying carnivorous dinosaurs may have had flying ancestors. In particular, ''[[Microraptor]]'', ''[[Pedopenna]]'', and ''[[Anchiornis]]'' all have winged feet, share many features, and lie close to the base of the clade [[Paraves]]. This suggests that the ancestral paravian was a four-winged glider, and that larger Deinonychosaurs secondarily lost the ability to glide, while the bird lineage increased in aerodynamic ability as it progressed.<ref name=Witmer2009>{{cite journal | last1= Witmer | first1= LM | title= Palaeontology: Feathered dinosaurs in a tangle | journal= Nature | volume= 461 | issue= 7264 | pages= 601\u20132 | year= 2009 | pmid = 19794481 | doi= 10.1038/461601a |bibcode = 2009Natur.461..601W }}</ref> ''[[Deinonychus]]'' may also display partial volancy, with the young being capable of flight or gliding and the adults being flightless.<ref>Parsons, William L.; Parsons, Kristen M.
