He was the fourth British headmaster in Doon's history and a member of [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]], [[UK]].\n\nThe school houses roughly 500 pupils aged 12 to 18, and admission is based on a competitive entrance examination, a group discussion and an interview with the headmaster. Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can choose between [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum.

Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can choose between [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum.

She has worked on huntingtin aggregation and the assembly of mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1 showing that huntingtin aggregation is context-dependent.  She uncovered the mechanisms by which SOD1 mutations generate aggregates and her work on the prion-like properties of assembled SOD1 was pioneering and influenced studies on other protein assemblies.  Following on from her discovery of several factors that are part of the cell's response to the perturbation of proteasome degradation, Anne's most recent work has led to the identification of an evolutionarily conserved pathway that controls proteasome homeostasis.}}\n\nBertolotti's citation for the [[GlaxoSmithKline]] Award from the [[Biochemical Society]] in 2017 reads:\n\n{{quote|Anne has made outstanding contributions to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning neurodegenerative diseases and has translated her findings towards the therapeutic arena by discovering a new drug candidate (Sephin1) that brings hope for the treatment of age-related diseases. Sephin1 is the first selective inhibitor of a serine-threonine phosphatase. This represents an important discovery because phosphatases were thought to be undruggable. Sephin1 is selective because it targets the regulatory subunit of a phosphatase. There are hundreds of phosphatases that could in principle be inhibited using the same paradigm opening up a broad range of possibilities to safely and selectively manipulate cellular functions, perhaps for therapeutic benefit.}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{scholia|author}}\n* [https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/group-leaders/a-to-g/anne-bertolotti/ Anne Bertolotti] at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bertolotti, Anne}}\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:French women biologists]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Neurological disease researcher}}\n{{Infobox scientist\n| name              = Anne Bertolotti\n| image             = Dr. Anne Bertolotti.png\n| image_size        = \n| alt               = \n| caption           = \n| birth_name        = \n| birth_date        = \n| birth_place       = \n| death_date        = \n| death_place       = \n| resting_place     = \n| resting_place_coordinates = \n| residence         = \n| nationality       = \n| fields            = Biology\n| workplaces        = MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology\n| patrons           = \n| alma_mater        = \n| thesis_title      = <!--(or  | thesis1_title =  and  | thesis2_title = )-->\n| thesis_url        = <!--(or  | thesis1_url  =   and  | thesis2_url  =  )-->\n| thesis_year       = <!--(or  | thesis1_year =   and  | thesis2_year =  )-->\n| doctoral_advisor  = <!--(or  | doctoral_advisors = )-->\n| academic_advisors = \n| doctoral_students = \n| notable_students  = \n| known_for         = Studies on neurodegenerative disease\n| influences        = \n| influenced        = \n| awards            = FMedSci, EMBO membership, Hooke Medal, GlaxoSmithKline Award\n| spouse            = \n| children          = \n| death_cause       = \n| education         = \n}}\n'''Anne Bertolotti''' {{Post-nominals|country=UK|FMedSci}} is a molecular biologist who is a group leader at the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology|MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology]].

She has worked on huntingtin aggregation and the assembly of mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1 showing that huntingtin aggregation is context-dependent.  She uncovered the mechanisms by which SOD1 mutations generate aggregates and her work on the prion-like properties of assembled SOD1 was pioneering and influenced studies on other protein assemblies.  Following on from her discovery of several factors that are part of the cell's response to the perturbation of proteasome degradation, Anne's most recent work has led to the identification of an evolutionarily conserved pathway that controls proteasome homeostasis.}}\n\nBertolotti's citation for the [[GlaxoSmithKline]] Award from the [[Biochemical Society]] in 2017 reads:\n\n{{quote|Anne has made outstanding contributions to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning neurodegenerative diseases and has translated her findings towards the therapeutic arena by discovering a new drug candidate (Sephin1) that brings hope for the treatment of age-related diseases. Sephin1 is the first selective inhibitor of a serine-threonine phosphatase. This represents an important discovery because phosphatases were thought to be undruggable. Sephin1 is selective because it targets the regulatory subunit of a phosphatase. There are hundreds of phosphatases that could in principle be inhibited using the same paradigm opening up a broad range of possibilities to safely and selectively manipulate cellular functions, perhaps for therapeutic benefit.}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{scholia|author}}\n* [https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/group-leaders/a-to-g/anne-bertolotti/ Anne Bertolotti] at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bertolotti, Anne}}\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:French women biologists]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences]]\n", "name_user": "Drgchristensen", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eProfessional associations and awards:Typo corrections - Bertoletti to Bertolotti", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Bertolotti"}

Their irregular, repeating shapes are found in cloud formations and tree limbs, in stalks of broccoli and craggy mountain ranges, even in the rhythm of the human heart. In this film, NOVA takes viewers on a fascinating quest with a group of maverick mathematicians determined to decipher the rules that govern fractal geometry. For centuries, fractal-like irregular shapes were considered beyond the boundaries of mathematical understanding. Now, mathematicians have finally begun mapping this uncharted territory.

NOVA was on-site at the San Jos\u00e9 mine in Chile by early September. Conferred special access, NOVA's film crew interviewed engineers, NASA experts, medical personnel, and key figures from the companies that provided drills and crucial rescue equipment to give a more detailed scientific account of the unfolding events. The resulting film, using footage from the scene as well as advanced animation, showcases the extraordinary feats of engineering as well as the biological and geological factors inherent in the rescue. \"Emergency Mine Rescue\" also examines the psychological and physiological impact of this kind of prolonged ordeal on the miners and those involved in the rescue efforts.

Despite all their efforts, the performance of the plane was balanced on a knife-edge, demanding near-perfect weather conditions and hour after hour of vigilant, skillful piloting. The longest nonstop leg, from Japan to Hawaii, lasted five days and set a new world solo flight record.

The U.S. space program suffered a bitter setback when Apollo 1 ended in a deadly fire during a pre-launch run-through.

Their irregular, repeating shapes are found in cloud formations and tree limbs, in stalks of broccoli and craggy mountain ranges, even in the rhythm of the human heart. In this film, NOVA takes viewers on a fascinating quest with a group of maverick mathematicians determined to decipher the rules that govern fractal geometry. For centuries, fractal-like irregular shapes were considered beyond the boundaries of mathematical understanding. Now, mathematicians have finally begun mapping this uncharted territory.

NOVA was on-site at the San Jos\u00e9 mine in Chile by early September. Conferred special access, NOVA's film crew interviewed engineers, NASA experts, medical personnel, and key figures from the companies that provided drills and crucial rescue equipment to give a more detailed scientific account of the unfolding events. The resulting film, using footage from the scene as well as advanced animation, showcases the extraordinary feats of engineering as well as the biological and geological factors inherent in the rescue. \"Emergency Mine Rescue\" also examines the psychological and physiological impact of this kind of prolonged ordeal on the miners and those involved in the rescue efforts.

Despite all their efforts, the performance of the plane was balanced on a knife-edge, demanding near-perfect weather conditions and hour after hour of vigilant, skillful piloting. The longest nonstop leg, from Japan to Hawaii, lasted five days and set a new world solo flight record.

The U.S. space program suffered a bitter setback when Apollo 1 ended in a deadly fire during a pre-launch run-through.

{"title_page": "Particularly Dangerous Situation", "text_new": "{{Over-quotation|date=December 2019}}\nA '''Particularly Dangerous Situation''' ('''PDS''') is a type of enhanced wording first used by the [[Storm Prediction Center]] (SPC), a national guidance center of the [[United States]] [[National Weather Service]], for [[tornado watch]]es and eventually expanded to use for other [[Severe weather terminology (United States)#Severe local storms|severe weather watches and warnings]] by local NWS forecast offices. It is issued at the discretion of the forecaster composing the [[Weather watch|watch]] or warning and implies that there is an enhanced risk of very severe and life-threatening weather, usually a major [[tornado outbreak]] or (much less often) a long-lived, extreme [[derecho]] event, but possibly another weather hazard such as an exceptional flash flood or fire.<ref name=\"spc_faq\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/#2.7 |title=Storm Prediction Center Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) |date=2004-04-18 |accessdate=2008-05-23 |author=NOAA}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ktvn.com/story/38797007/national-weather-service-issues-area-red-flag-warning|title=National Weather Service Issues Area Red Flag Warning|access-date=2018-08-04}}</ref>\n\nPDS watches are quite uncommon; less than 3% of watches issued by the SPC from 1996 to 2005 were PDS watches, or an average of 24 each year.<ref name=\"dean\">{{cite web |author=Dean, Andrew R. |url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/23SLS/techprogram/paper_115252.htm |title=PDS watches: how dangerous are these \"particularly dangerous situations?\" (2006 - 23SLS_23sls) |publisher=American Meteorological Society |date=2006-11-07 |accessdate=2008-05-23}}</ref> When a PDS watch is issued, there are often more PDS watches issued for the same weather system, even on the same day during major outbreaks, so the number of days per year that a PDS watch is issued is significantly lower.\n\n==Background==\nThe short history of the origin of the option of issuing a tornado watch with the enhanced Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) wording occurred during the winter of 1981-82 when the Severe Local Storms (SELS) unit transitioned to a more flexible method of issuing weather products. Ed Ferguson, Deputy Director of the National Severe Storms Forecast Center (NSSFC), suggested to Lead Forecaster Jack Hales that the guidance center could provide an opportunity to give more resolution to the [[tornado watch]] product. Hales suggested the PDS option to identify areas where, a few times each year, conditions are most likely to aid in the development of large and intense tornadoes. The first PDS tornado watch was issued by [[Robert H. Johns]] for the [[April 1982 tornado outbreak|April 2, 1982 tornado outbreak]] across the southern and central [[Great Plains]].<ref name=\"Johns bio\">{{cite journal |last=Lewis |first=John |authorlink= |title=A Forecaster's Story: Robert H.

These watches have generally (but not always) been issued during a '''high risk''' or an upper-end '''moderate risk''' either of severe storms from the SPC's [[convective outlook]]s or of flash flooding from the [[Weather Prediction Center]] (WPC)'s Excessive Rainfall Outlooks.\n\nOn April 24, 2011, the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] issued the first PDS flash flood watch to highlight the threat for widespread, significant and potentially life-threatening flash flooding due to repeated rounds of severe thunderstorms.\n\nOn December 19, 2017 and August 3, 2018, the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Reno, Nevada issued PDS Red Flag Warnings to highlight the threat for potentially life-threatening fire danger due to strong gusty winds and low humidity.\n\n==Issuance==\n\n=== PDS Flash Flood Watch ===\nPDS [[flash flood watch]]es are issued when there is a higher-than-normal risk of widespread, life-threatening [[flash flooding]]. These watches are issued by local NWS Weather Forecast Offices, not the Storm Prediction Center.\n\nBelow is the first PDS Flash Flood Watch, which was issued by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] on April 24, 2011, as mentioned above.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/vtec/#2011-O-NEW-KMEG-FF-A-0006 |title=IEM Valid Time Extent Code (VTEC) App |publisher=Mesonet.agron.iastate.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-22}}</ref>\n\n{{hidden\n|Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) Flash Flood Watch\n| URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED\n  FLOOD WATCH\n  NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MEMPHIS TN\n  239 PM CDT SUN APR 24 2011\n  \n  ...VERY HEAVY RAINFALL THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THIS WEEK WILL LIKELY\n  LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT...WIDESPREAD FLASH FLOODING...\n  \n  {{red|...THIS IS A PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION...}}\n  \n  A BOUNDARY WILL CONTINUE TO REMAIN STATIONARY ACROSS SOUTHERN\n  MISSOURI INTO KENTUCKY THROUGH MONDAY.

Like PDS Flash Flood Watches, they are issued by the local NWS Weather Forecast Offices, rather than the Storm Prediction Center. Recently, they have been issued as PDS Flash Flood Emergencies, most notably by the National Weather Service offices in Houston, TX and Corpus Christi, TX.\n\nThis warning was issued in the morning of May 30, 2018 by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]]-[[Spartanburg]], [[South Carolina]], while [[Subtropical Storm Alberto]] was affecting the area.

This emergency evacuation was\n  issued at the recommendation of dam engineers who remain on scene\n  to monitor the dam.  Lake Tahoma Dam is currently in a Level 1 or\n  Imminent Failure Condition.  This condition will continue until\n  the engineers have the opportunity to thoroughly inspect the dam\n  during daylight hours.  THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS\n  SITUATION! MANDATORY EVACUATIONS are underway for ALL residents\n  and businesses downstream of Lake Tahoma along Buck Creek and\n  along the Catawba River from Buck Creek and Lake Tahoma Rd (NC 80)\n  to the mouth of Lake James.  To save your life, please heed all\n  county evacuation notices and take action to leave the vicinity\n  immediately!\n  \n  Repeating, this is a FLASH FLOOD EMERGENCY for McDowell County for\n  areas downstream of Lake Tahoma and Lake Tahoma Dam to the mouth\n  of Lake James along the Catawba River. {{font color|red|This is a PARTICULARLY\n  DANGEROUS SITUATION.}} SEEK HIGHER GROUND NOW!\n  \n  * Repeating, mandatory evacuations remain underway from Lake Tahoma\n  Dam at Lake Shore Dr down Lake Tahoma Rd ([[North Carolina Highway 80|NC 80]]) to the confluence\n  of the Catawba River near [[U.S. Route 70 in North Carolina|US 70]], Resistoflex Rd, and Riverside\n  Park. Residences and businesses along US 70 from Lake Tahoma Rd to\n  [[U.S. Route 221 in North Carolina|US 221 Business]] near Garden Creek, as well as areas along Hankins\n  Rd. to the mouth of Lake James are included in the mandatory\n  evacuation.  LEAVE NOW!\n  \n  * Evacuees are being asked to seek shelter at the Glenwood Baptist\n  Church, the Old Fort Baptist Church, or the [[YMCA]] in [[Marion, North Carolina|Marion]] near\n  McDowell Hospital.\n  \n  * Some locations that are experiencing flooding include...\n  Pleasant Gardens, northwest Marion, and Lake James.\n  \n  * The excessive rainfall over the warned area has caused numerous\n  mud slides and additional mud slides are possible near steep\n  terrain. The mud slide can consist of rock, mud, vegetation and\n  other loose materials and are very powerful.\n  \n  PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...\n  \n  Move to higher ground NOW. This is an extremely dangerous and\n  life-threatening situation. Do NOT attempt to travel unless you are\n  fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order.\n  \n  Most flood deaths occur in vehicles. Do not attempt to cross\n  water-covered roadways, bridges, or low-level crossings. Only a few\n  inches of rapidly flowing water can carry away your vehicle. It is\n  not worth the risk. Please TURN AROUND, DON`T DROWN.\n  \n  The floodwave along Buck Creek above and below Lake Tahoma will\n  increase the risk of landslides, especially in areas where slides\n  have occurred in the past.

It is issued at the discretion of the forecaster composing the [[Weather watch|watch]] or warning and implies that there is an enhanced risk of very severe and life-threatening weather, usually a major [[tornado outbreak]] or (much less often) a long-lived, extreme [[derecho]] event, but possibly another weather hazard such as an exceptional flash flood or fire.<ref name=\"spc_faq\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/#2.7 |title=Storm Prediction Center Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) |date=2004-04-18 |accessdate=2008-05-23 |author=NOAA}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ktvn.com/story/38797007/national-weather-service-issues-area-red-flag-warning|title=National Weather Service Issues Area Red Flag Warning|access-date=2018-08-04}}</ref>\n\nPDS watches are quite uncommon; less than 3% of watches issued by the SPC from 1996 to 2005 were PDS watches, or an average of 24 each year.<ref name=\"dean\">{{cite web |author=Dean, Andrew R. |url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/23SLS/techprogram/paper_115252.htm |title=PDS watches: how dangerous are these \"particularly dangerous situations?\" (2006 - 23SLS_23sls) |publisher=American Meteorological Society |date=2006-11-07 |accessdate=2008-05-23}}</ref> When a PDS watch is issued, there are often more PDS watches issued for the same weather system, even on the same day during major outbreaks, so the number of days per year that a PDS watch is issued is significantly lower.\n\n==Background==\nThe short history of the origin of the option of issuing a tornado watch with the enhanced Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) wording occurred during the winter of 1981-82 when the Severe Local Storms (SELS) unit transitioned to a more flexible method of issuing weather products. Ed Ferguson, Deputy Director of the National Severe Storms Forecast Center (NSSFC), suggested to Lead Forecaster Jack Hales that the guidance center could provide an opportunity to give more resolution to the [[tornado watch]] product. Hales suggested the PDS option to identify areas where, a few times each year, conditions are most likely to aid in the development of large and intense tornadoes. The first PDS tornado watch was issued by [[Robert H. Johns]] for the [[April 1982 tornado outbreak|April 2, 1982 tornado outbreak]] across the southern and central [[Great Plains]].<ref name=\"Johns bio\">{{cite journal |last=Lewis |first=John |authorlink= |title=A Forecaster's Story: Robert H.

These watches have generally (but not always) been issued during a '''high risk''' or an upper-end '''moderate risk''' either of severe storms from the SPC's [[convective outlook]]s or of flash flooding from the [[Weather Prediction Center]] (WPC)'s Excessive Rainfall Outlooks.\n\nOn April 24, 2011, the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] issued the first PDS flash flood watch to highlight the threat for widespread, significant and potentially life-threatening flash flooding due to repeated rounds of severe thunderstorms.\n\nOn December 19, 2017 and August 3, 2018, the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Reno, Nevada issued PDS Red Flag Warnings to highlight the threat for potentially life-threatening fire danger due to strong gusty winds and low humidity.\n\n==Issuance==\n\n=== PDS Flash Flood Watch ===\nPDS [[flash flood watch]]es are issued when there is a higher-than-normal risk of widespread, life-threatening [[flash flooding]].

This emergency evacuation was\n  issued at the recommendation of dam engineers who remain on scene\n  to monitor the dam.  Lake Tahoma Dam is currently in a Level 1 or\n  Imminent Failure Condition.  This condition will continue until\n  the engineers have the opportunity to thoroughly inspect the dam\n  during daylight hours.  THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS\n  SITUATION! MANDATORY EVACUATIONS are underway for ALL residents\n  and businesses downstream of Lake Tahoma along Buck Creek and\n  along the Catawba River from Buck Creek and Lake Tahoma Rd (NC 80)\n  to the mouth of Lake James.

LEAVE NOW!\n  \n  * Evacuees are being asked to seek shelter at the Glenwood Baptist\n  Church, the Old Fort Baptist Church, or the [[YMCA]] in [[Marion, North Carolina|Marion]] near\n  McDowell Hospital.\n  \n  * Some locations that are experiencing flooding include...\n  Pleasant Gardens, northwest Marion, and Lake James.\n  \n  * The excessive rainfall over the warned area has caused numerous\n  mud slides and additional mud slides are possible near steep\n  terrain. The mud slide can consist of rock, mud, vegetation and\n  other loose materials and are very powerful.\n  \n  PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...\n  \n  Move to higher ground NOW. This is an extremely dangerous and\n  life-threatening situation. Do NOT attempt to travel unless you are\n  fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order.\n  \n  Most flood deaths occur in vehicles. Do not attempt to cross\n  water-covered roadways, bridges, or low-level crossings. Only a few\n  inches of rapidly flowing water can carry away your vehicle. It is\n  not worth the risk. Please TURN AROUND, DON`T DROWN.\n  \n  The floodwave along Buck Creek above and below Lake Tahoma will\n  increase the risk of landslides, especially in areas where slides\n  have occurred in the past.

This is only in the online mode. All team game modes feature the soldiers of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied nations]] versus those of the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]]. Multiplayer features are absent from the Wii edition.\n\nIt is the first game in the ''Call of Duty'' series to introduce two different game modes. The \"Normalized\" mode was added to allow console players a way to adjust to the smaller kill box of ''[[Call of Duty]]'', its expansion ''United Offensive'', and ''[[Call of Duty 2]]''.\n\nOn the Xbox 360, ''Call of Duty 3'' divides its multiplayer aspect into Player and Ranked matches. Player matches allow players to invite other players into their games, but do not contribute points toward the leader board or unlock [[Xbox Live#Gamerscore|Achievements]]. Ranked matches put the player with and against teams of random players, and contribute towards player points and allow players to unlock Achievements.\n\n==Plot==\n{{longplot|section|date=November 2019}}\n===American Campaign===\nIn the American campaign, the player controls [[Private (rank)|Private]] Nichols, a replacement for the [[29th Infantry Division (United States)|29th Infantry Division]]. After arriving in a staging area outside [[Saint-L\u00f4]], he is assigned to his new squad consisting of veterans [[Corporal]] Mike Dixon, Private Leroy Huxley (voiced by [[Benjamin Diskin]]), and the squad's CO, [[Sergeant]] Frank McCullin. Shortly after Nichols' arrival the squad participates in the final offensive in the [[Battle of Saint-L\u00f4|capture of Saint-L\u00f4]]. Upon arriving at the outskirts of the town, McCullin enlists radio operator [[Private First Class]] Salvatore Guzzo, who had become separated from his unit, to assist the squad in the attack, despite the latter's objections. During the brutal street to street fighting, the squad takes shelter from a German artillery barrage, during which Guzzo demands that the squad should fall back. As the shelling intensifies, Guzzo's loses patience and tries to leave but is stopped by McCullin, who threatens to shoot him for desertion. The standoff is quickly resolved, but further intensifies the mutual dislike between Guzzo and McCullin. After the squad fights off a final counterattack by the Germans, Saint-L\u00f4 is finally declared secure. Shortly after the battle, the squad is folded in with the [[90th Infantry Division (United States)|90th Infantry Division]] as reinforcements to help secure [[Saint-Germain-sur-S\u00e8ves]]. As the squad pushes forward and eventually succeeds in clearing the area, it becomes clear that McCullin, after witnessing years of war and death, is beginning to lose touch with reality, often appearing confused and distracted, even in the middle of battle. Sometime later the squad takes part in the assault on [[Mayenne]] in order to capture its heavily fortified bridge. After the squad fights through a German garrison located inside a medieval castle and fords the Mayenne River under heavy fire, McCullin finally snaps and effectively shuts downs, becoming almost completely unresponsive, leaving leadership of the squad to Dixon, which is eventually able to fight their way to the bridge. Huxley is given the task of disarming several German aircraft bombs rigged to the bridge as makeshift demolition charges, but is wounded before he can begin. McCullin, a former combat engineer, finally manages to shake his delirium and takes Huxley's place to disarm the bombs, as Nichols and the rest of the squad protects him. McCullin is mortally wounded by a German mortar round but manages to disarm the final bomb, with his dying words to Dixon being to \"tell Guzzo to go to hell\". Dixon is promoted to Sergeant and assumes command of the squad. Shortly after the squad is sent to clear out [[For\u00eat d'\u00c9couves]], in order to aid the 2nd Battalion's advance, and to locate a company of combat engineers that had gone missing after entering the forest several days prior. After fighting their way through several ambushes and well hidden enemy emplacements, they eventually locate a surviving engineer, who explains how their convoy was ambushed and supply depots were overrun by the Germans, despite French forces having supposedly cleared the area days prior. Nichols and the squad are able to recapture the supply depot and destroy a German roadblock, effectively clearing the remaining Germans out of the forest. Despite their victory, tensions begin to rise between Guzzo and Dixon who, like McCullin before him, has begun to grow tired of the radio operator's constant questioning of orders and generally negative attitude. The squad is then sent to aid in the liberation of a vital crossroads at Le Bourg St. Leonard, effectively trapping the remaining German forces between the US forces to the south and the British, Canadian, and Polish forces to the north, all but closing the [[Falaise Pocket]], but are displeased when they are then ordered to defend the town of [[Chambois, Orne|Chambois]], the last escape route for the Germans trapped in the Pocket, in order to prevent any remaining German forces from escaping.\n\nShortly after occupying the town, Nichols' squad and the other defending American units come under attack from a massive force of retreating Germans attempting to escape the Pocket. After much fighting and after retreating several times, Guzzo attempts to call for air support in order to destroy enemy positions, but his radio is destroyed by enemy fire. Resorting to using signal flares and braving heavy German fire, Guzzo is able to successfully mark the targets, but is wounded in the final target area. Nichols and Dixon are able to rescue him just as air support attacks the enemy targets, but Dixon is shot in the back just as they reach Allied lines. Recalling McCullin's last words to Guzzo, Dixon laments that he was a good soldier after all before succumbing to his wounds. Shaken and enraged by Dixon's death, Guzzo takes command of the squad and leads them to aid the remaining American defenders to retake and defend the town just as air support and American reinforcements arrive, forcing the remaining German forces to surrender. Two days later, the squad members receive promotions, with Guzzo officially promoted to Sergeant and Nichols and Huxley being promoted to Corporal, and begin their march to [[Liberation of Paris|liberate Paris]].\n\n===British Campaign===\nIn the British campaign, the player controls Sergeant James Doyle, a member of the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS), who alongside squad mates Corporal Duncan Keith, Wilkins, and Major Gerald Ingram, are parachuted into France in order to assist the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis Resistance]] in several operations to reduce the fighting capability of the German forces fighting in Normandy. Shortly before reaching their drop point near [[Toucy]], France, the group's [[Handley Page Halifax]] is shot down, with Doyle and Wilkins being separated from the rest of their squad. Wilkins is executed shortly after landing and Doyle is rescued by Pierre LaRoche, the Maquis leader, before regrouping with Keith, Ingram, and resistance member Isabelle DuFontaine. After retrieving their two heavily armed jeeps, nicknamed \"Vera\" and \"Lynn\" respectively, Doyle and the group begin attacking several German position, including the anti-aircraft battery that had shot them down and assaulting a manor house that is serving as a German HQ in order to free a captured Maquis member, a man known only as Marcel. After escaping the area and regrouping, it is revealed that Marcel managed to steal the plans of a German held fuel plant before he was captured. Keith, who already holds great disdain for the resistance fighters and the French in general, immediately begins to butt heads with LaRoche, citing his lack of confidence in the Maquis and distrust of Marcel in particular. Using the captured plans, the SAS and Maquis launch a raid on the plant in order to destroy its fuel storage tanks and the production facilities. During the course of the raid the jeep \"Vera\" is severely damaged during the fighting and abandoned, and Doyle almost falls to his death during an altercation with a German soldier on one of the storage tanks. With the facility exploding around them, Doyle, Keith, and Marcel manage to escape the area, but the vehicle carrying Ingram is hit by German fire and Ingram is seemingly killed. Regrouping with LaRoche and DuFontaine sometime later, Keith berates LaRoche, who had left early during the raid, calling the Maquis leader a coward and outright accusing Marcel of being a German collaborator. Following the destruction of the fuel plant, the group receives information that Ingram is still alive and being held captive at a nearby village. Despite LaRoche's objections, Doyle and Keith lead a rescue mission on the village, and manage to rescue Ingram and several captured Maquis fighters from interrogation and execution, before fending off a German counterattack, during which Isabelle is killed when a satchel charge she is planting on an armored car detonates prematurely. Marcel, visibly saddened by her death, is comforted by Keith, who has finally learned to respect the Maquis and their bravery.\n\n===Canadian Campaign===\nIn the Canadian campaign the player controls Private Cole of the [[4th Canadian Division|4th Canadian (Armored) Division]], led by [[World War I]] veteran [[Lieutenant]] Jean-Guy Robichaud. Robichaud commands a platoon in the [[The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], aided by Sergeant Jonathan Callard, squad member Private Kyle Peterson, and the squad's radio operator, Private Leslie Baron, who is continuously harassed by Robichaud for his lack of experience and habit of being seemingly absent during fighting. After their convoy is ambushed during a nighttime attack on a German-held industrial complex near [[Tilly-la-Campagne]], the platoon proceeds to attack a German artillery battery on a nearby ridge, before moving on to capture the industrial complex and holding off an enemy counter-attack, destroying several German tanks in the process. The platoon later proceeds to clear a forested area near the Laison River of several anti-tank positions and a motor pool in order to clear the way for Allied convoys to move through the area. While advancing alongside other Canadian units to relieve Polish forces defending [[Hill 262]], Baron is volunteered by Robichaud to be transferred to the Polish [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|1st Armored Division]] after the Polish unit's radio operator is killed. Fed up with Robichaud's abuse, Baron initially objects, stating that he is not a coward as Robichaud seems to believe, before storming off, much to Callard's concern. Cole's squad is then tasked to lead a rescue mission to free a captured Canadian tank crew in St. Lamber-sur-Dives, and with their help eventually capture the whole town. Shortly after freeing the tank crew, the squad comes under attack from a [[Tiger II|King Tiger]] tank. While attempting to flank the tank, the squad discovers a German munition stockpile in a cellar directly beneath the tank, and plant explosives to take out both the munitions and the tank. When the charges fail to detonate, Callard returns to the cellar and detonates the charges manually, destroying the King Tiger and dying in the process, with Cole and Robichaud being knocked out by the blast. Waking up sometime later, Cole is reunited with Robichaud and learns that Callard is being recommended for the [[Victoria Cross]] and that he is being promoted to Corporal. Shortly afterwards the unit moves out to help aid Canadian reinforcements advance to aid the Poles struggling to defend Hill 262.\n\n===Polish Campaign===\nThe Polish campaign revolves around Corporal \"Bohater\" Wojciech, a [[Sherman Firefly]] tank driver in the Polish [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|1st Armored Division]] and his crew members, including Major Stan \"Papa Jack\" Jachowicz, Corporal Joakim \"Lucky Rudd\" Rudinski, Sergeant \u0141ukasz \"Bang Boom\" Kowalski, and Private Marek \"Beksa\" Ulan. While aiding the Canadian and British forces in the area, Jachowicz's crew participates in a sweep across the French countryside, engaging German armored units while advancing to capture and occupy Hill 262, known as \"The Mace\" by the Polish. Bohater and his crew eventually track down and destroy an infamous [[Tiger II]] tank ace known as Richter \"The Black Barron\" (a reference to real life Tiger ace [[Michael Wittmann]]). Bohater and his crew then join in the defense of Hill 262 and endure a heavy assault by the remnants of the German [[7th Army (Wehrmacht)|7th Army]] in their desperate attempt to escape the [[Falaise Pocket]]. Bohater's tank is destroyed shortly after the attack begins, forcing the crew to fight on foot alongside the Polish infantry. With their position overrun, Bohater and his crew continue to fight the Germans as they retreat towards the summit of [[Hill 262]], during which Rudinski is killed. They are eventually joined by Canadian radio operator Baron, who along with Bohater provides artillery support in order to destroy several German tanks. As the crew continues to climb the hill, Baron refuses to retreat any further, having been deeply effected by Lieutenant Robichaud's constant teasing, and demands to stay and fight instead, while continually shouting that he \"isn't a coward\". Baron is killed by German fire while arguing with Ulan, who salvages the radio in order to continue providing artillery support. Upon reaching the top of the hill, the crew spots what they believe to be the Canadian reinforcements, only to realize it is instead a massive German counterattack, during which Rudinski is killed by a King Tiger tank. After much fighting, the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] appears and repels the German forces as the Canadian reinforcements arrive at last, leaving Hill 262 firmly in Allied hands. Major Jachowicz meets with Lieutenant Robichaud after the battle and expresses his desire to collect the bodies of his men and return them to Poland, as well as stating his belief that the Germans will soon be defeated. However, Robichaud is quick to remind him that the Germans still have an escape route through Chambois should the Americans fail to stop them.\n\n==Downloadable content==\nThree map packs were released for the Xbox 360 multiplayer game on the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamershell.com/companies/activision/327638.html |title=Activision Releases Free Call of Duty\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00ae 3 Multiplayer Bonus Map |date=12 January 2007 |access-date=27 June 2018 |work=Gamers Hell |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627202204/http://www.gamershell.com/companies/activision/327638.html |archive-date=June 27, 2018 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The first, \"Champs\", was released as a free download on January 11, 2007 and contained a single self-titled map.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamershell.com/news_35510.html |title=Call of Duty 3 Bonus Map Released |date=January 12, 2007 |work=Gamers Hell |access-date=July 23, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317001045/http://www.gamershell.com/news_35510.html |archive-date=March 17, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The \"Valor\" map pack contained five new maps: Crossing, Ironclad, La Bourgade, Stalag 23, and Wildwood.

It was a launch title for the PlayStation 3 and Wii in North America, Europe and Australia. \n\n==Gameplay==\n''Call of Duty 3'' is a historical first-person shooter game that has a single-player campaign mode and multiplayer mode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.giantbomb.com/call-of-duty-3/3030-7524/|title=Call of Duty 3|work=[[Giant Bomb]]|date=2006|accessdate=February 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190219130102/https://www.giantbomb.com/call-of-duty-3/3030-7524/|archive-date=February 19, 2019|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It is open-ended, giving the player multiple paths to complete objectives, but plays similarly to the series' [[Call of Duty 2|previous installment]].<ref name=ignreview>{{cite web|url=https://m.ign.com/articles/2006/11/16/call-of-duty-3-review-4|title=Call of Duty 3 Review|last=Clayman|first=David|date=November 15, 2006|accessdate=February 18, 2019}}</ref> Players fight alongside [[artificial intelligence|AI]]-controlled teammates against enemies who use various attack patterns, hide behind cover, and regroup to improved defensive positions.<ref name=ignreview/>\n\nA character can be positioned in one of three stances: standing, crouching, or prone, each affecting the player's rate of movement and accuracy.

Set in the Western Front of World War II, ''Call of Duty 3'' takes place in the year 1944 and contains missions specific to four major [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] campaigns in the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]].<ref name=ignreview/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news070506cod3|title=Call of Duty 3 from Treyarch|last=Bramwell|first=Tom|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=July 5, 2006|accessdate=February 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224064114/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news070506cod3|archive-date=February 24, 2019|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The player takes part in a series of objectives marked by their HUD; these include having the character arrive at a checkpoint, eliminate enemies in a specified location, manning a tank, and marking targets for air strikes.<ref name=gamespot/> ''Call of Duty 3'' introduces to the series scripted close-combat sequences and multiple actions to arming explosives, both of which require the player to press buttons in sequences to progress.<ref name=gamespot/>\n\n===Multiplayer===\nIn addition to the single-player campaign, ''Call of Duty 3'' features a wide range of multiplayer modes for players to participate in \u2013 each team allowing up to 24 on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, and 16 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in a single match. This is only in the online mode. All team game modes feature the soldiers of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied nations]] versus those of the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]]. Multiplayer features are absent from the Wii edition.\n\nIt is the first game in the ''Call of Duty'' series to introduce two different game modes. The \"Normalized\" mode was added to allow console players a way to adjust to the smaller kill box of ''[[Call of Duty]]'', its expansion ''United Offensive'', and ''[[Call of Duty 2]]''.\n\nOn the Xbox 360, ''Call of Duty 3'' divides its multiplayer aspect into Player and Ranked matches. Player matches allow players to invite other players into their games, but do not contribute points toward the leader board or unlock [[Xbox Live#Gamerscore|Achievements]]. Ranked matches put the player with and against teams of random players, and contribute towards player points and allow players to unlock Achievements.\n\n==Plot==\n{{longplot|section|date=November 2019}}\n===American Campaign===\nIn the American campaign, the player controls [[Private (rank)|Private]] Nichols, a replacement for the [[29th Infantry Division (United States)|29th Infantry Division]]. After arriving in a staging area outside [[Saint-L\u00f4]], he is assigned to his new squad consisting of veterans [[Corporal]] Mike Dixon, Private Leroy Huxley (voiced by [[Benjamin Diskin]]), and the squad's CO, [[Sergeant]] Frank McCullin. Shortly after Nichols' arrival the squad participates in the final offensive in the [[Battle of Saint-L\u00f4|capture of Saint-L\u00f4]]. Upon arriving at the outskirts of the town, McCullin enlists radio operator [[Private First Class]] Salvatore Guzzo, who had become separated from his unit, to assist the squad in the attack, despite the latter's objections. During the brutal street to street fighting, the squad takes shelter from a German artillery barrage, during which Guzzo demands that the squad should fall back. As the shelling intensifies, Guzzo's loses patience and tries to leave but is stopped by McCullin, who threatens to shoot him for desertion. The standoff is quickly resolved, but further intensifies the mutual dislike between Guzzo and McCullin. After the squad fights off a final counterattack by the Germans, Saint-L\u00f4 is finally declared secure. Shortly after the battle, the squad is folded in with the [[90th Infantry Division (United States)|90th Infantry Division]] as reinforcements to help secure [[Saint-Germain-sur-S\u00e8ves]]. As the squad pushes forward and eventually succeeds in clearing the area, it becomes clear that McCullin, after witnessing years of war and death, is beginning to lose touch with reality, often appearing confused and distracted, even in the middle of battle. Sometime later the squad takes part in the assault on [[Mayenne]] in order to capture its heavily fortified bridge. After the squad fights through a German garrison located inside a medieval castle and fords the Mayenne River under heavy fire, McCullin finally snaps and effectively shuts downs, becoming almost completely unresponsive, leaving leadership of the squad to Dixon, which is eventually able to fight their way to the bridge. Huxley is given the task of disarming several German aircraft bombs rigged to the bridge as makeshift demolition charges, but is wounded before he can begin. McCullin, a former combat engineer, finally manages to shake his delirium and takes Huxley's place to disarm the bombs, as Nichols and the rest of the squad protects him. McCullin is mortally wounded by a German mortar round but manages to disarm the final bomb, with his dying words to Dixon being to \"tell Guzzo to go to hell\". Dixon is promoted to Sergeant and assumes command of the squad. Shortly after the squad is sent to clear out [[For\u00eat d'\u00c9couves]], in order to aid the 2nd Battalion's advance, and to locate a company of combat engineers that had gone missing after entering the forest several days prior. After fighting their way through several ambushes and well hidden enemy emplacements, they eventually locate a surviving engineer, who explains how their convoy was ambushed and supply depots were overrun by the Germans, despite French forces having supposedly cleared the area days prior. Nichols and the squad are able to recapture the supply depot and destroy a German roadblock, effectively clearing the remaining Germans out of the forest. Despite their victory, tensions begin to rise between Guzzo and Dixon who, like McCullin before him, has begun to grow tired of the radio operator's constant questioning of orders and generally negative attitude. The squad is then sent to aid in the liberation of a vital crossroads at Le Bourg St. Leonard, effectively trapping the remaining German forces between the US forces to the south and the British, Canadian, and Polish forces to the north, all but closing the [[Falaise Pocket]], but are displeased when they are then ordered to defend the town of [[Chambois, Orne|Chambois]], the last escape route for the Germans trapped in the Pocket, in order to prevent any remaining German forces from escaping.\n\nShortly after occupying the town, Nichols' squad and the other defending American units come under attack from a massive force of retreating Germans attempting to escape the Pocket. After much fighting and after retreating several times, Guzzo attempts to call for air support in order to destroy enemy positions, but his radio is destroyed by enemy fire. Resorting to using signal flares and braving heavy German fire, Guzzo is able to successfully mark the targets, but is wounded in the final target area. Nichols and Dixon are able to rescue him just as air support attacks the enemy targets, but Dixon is shot in the back just as they reach Allied lines. Recalling McCullin's last words to Guzzo, Dixon laments that he was a good soldier after all before succumbing to his wounds. Shaken and enraged by Dixon's death, Guzzo takes command of the squad and leads them to aid the remaining American defenders to retake and defend the town just as air support and American reinforcements arrive, forcing the remaining German forces to surrender. Two days later, the squad members receive promotions, with Guzzo officially promoted to Sergeant and Nichols and Huxley being promoted to Corporal, and begin their march to [[Liberation of Paris|liberate Paris]].\n\n===British Campaign===\nIn the British campaign, the player controls Sergeant James Doyle, a member of the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS), who alongside squad mates Corporal Duncan Keith, Wilkins, and Major Gerald Ingram, are parachuted into France in order to assist the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis Resistance]] in several operations to reduce the fighting capability of the German forces fighting in Normandy. Shortly before reaching their drop point near [[Toucy]], France, the group's [[Handley Page Halifax]] is shot down, with Doyle and Wilkins being separated from the rest of their squad. Wilkins is executed shortly after landing and Doyle is rescued by Pierre LaRoche, the Maquis leader, before regrouping with Keith, Ingram, and resistance member Isabelle DuFontaine. After retrieving their two heavily armed jeeps, nicknamed \"Vera\" and \"Lynn\" respectively, Doyle and the group begin attacking several German position, including the anti-aircraft battery that had shot them down and assaulting a manor house that is serving as a German HQ in order to free a captured Maquis member, a man known only as Marcel. After escaping the area and regrouping, it is revealed that Marcel managed to steal the plans of a German held fuel plant before he was captured. Keith, who already holds great disdain for the resistance fighters and the French in general, immediately begins to butt heads with LaRoche, citing his lack of confidence in the Maquis and distrust of Marcel in particular. Using the captured plans, the SAS and Maquis launch a raid on the plant in order to destroy its fuel storage tanks and the production facilities. During the course of the raid the jeep \"Vera\" is severely damaged during the fighting and abandoned, and Doyle almost falls to his death during an altercation with a German soldier on one of the storage tanks. With the facility exploding around them, Doyle, Keith, and Marcel manage to escape the area, but the vehicle carrying Ingram is hit by German fire and Ingram is seemingly killed. Regrouping with LaRoche and DuFontaine sometime later, Keith berates LaRoche, who had left early during the raid, calling the Maquis leader a coward and outright accusing Marcel of being a German collaborator. Following the destruction of the fuel plant, the group receives information that Ingram is still alive and being held captive at a nearby village. Despite LaRoche's objections, Doyle and Keith lead a rescue mission on the village, and manage to rescue Ingram and several captured Maquis fighters from interrogation and execution, before fending off a German counterattack, during which Isabelle is killed when a satchel charge she is planting on an armored car detonates prematurely. Marcel, visibly saddened by her death, is comforted by Keith, who has finally learned to respect the Maquis and their bravery.\n\n===Canadian Campaign===\nIn the Canadian campaign the player controls Private Cole of the [[4th Canadian Division|4th Canadian (Armored) Division]], led by [[World War I]] veteran [[Lieutenant]] Jean-Guy Robichaud. Robichaud commands a platoon in the [[The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], aided by Sergeant Jonathan Callard, squad member Private Kyle Peterson, and the squad's radio operator, Private Leslie Baron, who is continuously harassed by Robichaud for his lack of experience and habit of being seemingly absent during fighting. After their convoy is ambushed during a nighttime attack on a German-held industrial complex near [[Tilly-la-Campagne]], the platoon proceeds to attack a German artillery battery on a nearby ridge, before moving on to capture the industrial complex and holding off an enemy counter-attack, destroying several German tanks in the process. The platoon later proceeds to clear a forested area near the Laison River of several anti-tank positions and a motor pool in order to clear the way for Allied convoys to move through the area. While advancing alongside other Canadian units to relieve Polish forces defending [[Hill 262]], Baron is volunteered by Robichaud to be transferred to the Polish [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|1st Armored Division]] after the Polish unit's radio operator is killed. Fed up with Robichaud's abuse, Baron initially objects, stating that he is not a coward as Robichaud seems to believe, before storming off, much to Callard's concern. Cole's squad is then tasked to lead a rescue mission to free a captured Canadian tank crew in St. Lamber-sur-Dives, and with their help eventually capture the whole town. Shortly after freeing the tank crew, the squad comes under attack from a [[Tiger II|King Tiger]] tank. While attempting to flank the tank, the squad discovers a German munition stockpile in a cellar directly beneath the tank, and plant explosives to take out both the munitions and the tank. When the charges fail to detonate, Callard returns to the cellar and detonates the charges manually, destroying the King Tiger and dying in the process, with Cole and Robichaud being knocked out by the blast. Waking up sometime later, Cole is reunited with Robichaud and learns that Callard is being recommended for the [[Victoria Cross]] and that he is being promoted to Corporal. Shortly afterwards the unit moves out to help aid Canadian reinforcements advance to aid the Poles struggling to defend Hill 262.\n\n===Polish Campaign===\nThe Polish campaign revolves around Corporal \"Bohater\" Wojciech, a [[Sherman Firefly]] tank driver in the Polish [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|1st Armored Division]] and his crew members, including Major Stan \"Papa Jack\" Jachowicz, Corporal Joakim \"Lucky Rudd\" Rudinski, Sergeant \u0141ukasz \"Bang Boom\" Kowalski, and Private Marek \"Beksa\" Ulan. While aiding the Canadian and British forces in the area, Jachowicz's crew participates in a sweep across the French countryside, engaging German armored units while advancing to capture and occupy Hill 262, known as \"The Mace\" by the Polish. Bohater and his crew eventually track down and destroy an infamous [[Tiger II]] tank ace known as Richter \"The Black Barron\" (a reference to real life Tiger ace [[Michael Wittmann]]). Bohater and his crew then join in the defense of Hill 262 and endure a heavy assault by the remnants of the German [[7th Army (Wehrmacht)|7th Army]] in their desperate attempt to escape the [[Falaise Pocket]]. Bohater's tank is destroyed shortly after the attack begins, forcing the crew to fight on foot alongside the Polish infantry. With their position overrun, Bohater and his crew continue to fight the Germans as they retreat towards the summit of [[Hill 262]], during which Rudinski is killed. They are eventually joined by Canadian radio operator Baron, who along with Bohater provides artillery support in order to destroy several German tanks. As the crew continues to climb the hill, Baron refuses to retreat any further, having been deeply effected by Lieutenant Robichaud's constant teasing, and demands to stay and fight instead, while continually shouting that he \"isn't a coward\". Baron is killed by German fire while arguing with Ulan, who salvages the radio in order to continue providing artillery support. Upon reaching the top of the hill, the crew spots what they believe to be the Canadian reinforcements, only to realize it is instead a massive German counterattack, during which Rudinski is killed by a King Tiger tank. After much fighting, the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] appears and repels the German forces as the Canadian reinforcements arrive at last, leaving Hill 262 firmly in Allied hands. Major Jachowicz meets with Lieutenant Robichaud after the battle and expresses his desire to collect the bodies of his men and return them to Poland, as well as stating his belief that the Germans will soon be defeated. However, Robichaud is quick to remind him that the Germans still have an escape route through Chambois should the Americans fail to stop them.\n\n==Downloadable content==\nThree map packs were released for the Xbox 360 multiplayer game on the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamershell.com/companies/activision/327638.html |title=Activision Releases Free Call of Duty\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00ae 3 Multiplayer Bonus Map |date=12 January 2007 |access-date=27 June 2018 |work=Gamers Hell |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627202204/http://www.gamershell.com/companies/activision/327638.html |archive-date=June 27, 2018 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The first, \"Champs\", was released as a free download on January 11, 2007 and contained a single self-titled map.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamershell.com/news_35510.html |title=Call of Duty 3 Bonus Map Released |date=January 12, 2007 |work=Gamers Hell |access-date=July 23, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317001045/http://www.gamershell.com/news_35510.html |archive-date=March 17, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The \"Valor\" map pack contained five new maps: Crossing, Ironclad, La Bourgade, Stalag 23, and Wildwood.
