The house was built in 1896 by [[Adolph Cudell]] and [[Arthur Hercz]] for brewer [[Francis J. Dewes]]. It was designated a [[Chicago Landmark]] on June 12, 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/D/DewesHouse.html|title=Dewes House|publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division|year=2003|accessdate=2007-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607152607/http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/D/DewesHouse.html|archive-date=2007-06-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>  It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on August 14, 1973\n\nWealthy German immigrants, including [[Charles H. Wacker|Wacker]], Leight, Gaetner, Deever, and Schlosser, constructed luxurious mansions east of [[Clark Street (Chicago)|Clark Street]] in Chicago's [[Lincoln Park]]. Francis Dewes, a Chicago brewer and millionaire, built the most elaborate home in the Lincoln Park still standing - Dewes Mansion at 503 West Wrightwood Avenue.\n\nArchitects Adolph Cudell and Arthur Hercz designed the Dewes mansion, and it was completed in 1896. Hercz was originally from Hungary, and Cudell was no stranger to building grand residences for Chicago's wealthy elite. In 1879 Cudell also designed the Rush Street mansion of prominent businessman Cyrus Hall McCormick.\n\nThe Dewes mansion was built for Francis J. Dewes, a brewer. Dewes was born in Prussia in 1845, the son of a brewer and member of the German parliament. In 1868 Francis Dewes emigrated to Chicago and found employment as a bookkeeper for established brewing companies such as Rehm and Bartholomae and the Busch and Brand Brewing Company. He rose through the ranks, and in 1882 he founded his own successful brewing firm. His mansion was built to reflect his own Prussian background and European tastes.\n\nTaken as a whole, the building is an unusual example of a German inspired style, influenced by the neo-Baroque architecture of [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Ecole des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris at the end of the 19th century{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}. The exterior of this lavish gray-stone is decorated with carved stonework and ornamental cornices and lintels. The entrance to the mansion is flanked by [[caryatid]]s, tall figures acting as columns, supporting a balcony over the doorway.\n\n==Interior==\nThe mansion is three story Baroque style with two caryatids supporting the balcony over the main entrance. There are many figures and ornamental groups carved in the Bedford stone exterior of the building. Oranmental iron, hand-wrought, forms the balconies, window trim, porches, and railings; all in lavish detail of the Baroque style. There is a mansard roof with hand wrought copper fence surround. The exterior of the building is considered to be Louis XV style that later spread to all the capitals of Europe. The large stained glass window which extends from the main stairway landing of the building up to the second floor is the work of a famous Belgian artist with figures and flowers in a springtime motif. The artist was engaged to design a window to fit the opening and came to Chicago especially to work out the details and return to Belgium to personally supervise the firing of the glass and making of the window. On the first floor of the elegant interior of this building one immediately notices upon entering the foyer the huge fireplace on the East wall with marble columns facing the magnificent staircase leading to the second floor; immediately ahead upon entering is the wishing well equipped with running water and statue. The floors are Italian Mosaic and marble arranged in panels with overlay of gilded ornamental plaster molding gracing the walls.<ref>http://cdn.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/il/il0100/il0112/data/il0112data.pdf</ref>\n\nOrnamental iron, hand wrought, is used as a decor on the stairway, as lighting fixtures and ornamentation. This work was executed in Germany and exhibited at the Columbian Exposition in 1893 prior to being installed in the building. It received the grand prize of merit both for design and craftsmanship.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}} The library of Gothic architecture, was brought from Europe where it was designed and erected - then dismantled and shipped to Chicago to be erected again.

Military berets are usually pushed to the right to free the shoulder that bears the rifle on most soldiers, but the armies of some countries, mostly within Europe, South America and Asia have influenced the push to the left.\n\nIn some countries, berets are associated with [[Military elite|elite units]], who often wear berets in more unusual colours. For instance, the [[maroon beret]] is mostly traditional headgear for elite [[airborne forces]] around the world with a few exceptions like the elite [[Russian Airborne Troops]] who instead wear a [[sky blue]] beret or the [[Portuguese Paratroopers]] that wear a [[green beret]].\n[[File:ComandosPT.jpg|thumb|Portuguese Army Commandos with red beret|555x555px]]\n[[File:Bastille Day 2014 Paris - Color guards 010.jpg|thumb|270px|A Ukrainian military cadet in a light blue beret.]]\n==History==\n[[File:C\u00e9sar PAYAN.jpg|thumb|right|A French ''[[chasseur alpin]]'' in World War I, with their distinctive large beret.]]\nThe use of beret-like headgear as a civilian headdress dates back hundreds of years, an early example being the Scottish Blue Bonnet, that became a ''de facto'' symbol of Scottish [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] forces in the 16th and 17th centuries. As an officially required military headdress, its use dates back to the [[Carlist Wars]] of Succession for the Spanish Crown in the 1830s by order of [[Carlism|Carlist]] General [[Tom\u00e1s de Zumalac\u00e1rregui]] who wanted a local and non-costly way to make headgear that was resistant to the mountain weather, easy to care for and could be used on formal occasions.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe French [[Chasseur Alpin|Chasseurs alpins]], created in the early 1880s, were the first regular unit to wear the military beret as a standard headgear.<ref>{{cite book|first=W.Y.|last=Carman|page=26|title=A Dictionary of Military Uniform|ISBN=0-684-15130-8}}</ref> These mountain troops were issued with a uniform which included several features which were innovative for the time, notably the large and floppy blue beret which they still retain.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Mollo|page=200|title=Military Fashion|ISBN=0-214-65349-8}}</ref> This was so unfamiliar a fashion outside France that it had to be described in the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' of 1911 as \"a soft cap or [[tam o'shanter (hat)|tam o'shanter]]\".<ref>\"Uniforms\", page 587, Volume XXVII ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 1911 Edition</ref>\n\nBerets have features that make them attractive to the military: they are cheap, easy to make in large numbers, can be manufactured in a wide range of colors, can be rolled up and stuffed into a pocket or beneath the shirt epaulette without damage, and can be worn with headphones (this is one of the reasons why early tank crews adopted the beret). The beret is not so useful in field conditions for the modern infantryman, who requires protective helmets, and non-camouflage versions are seldom seen on operations.\n\nThe beret was found particularly useful as a uniform for armored-vehicle crews, and the [[Royal Tank Regiment|British Tank Corps]] (later Royal Tank Corps) adopted the headdress as early as 1918.\n\nGerman AFV crews in the late 1930s also adopted a beret with the addition of a padded crash helmet inside. The colour black was worn by the Royal Tank Corps later Royal Tank Regiment, since it did not show oil stains picked up inside the interior of a vehicle. [[Black beret]]s continue to be worn by the Royal Tank Regiment, all other British armoured units wear [[blue beret]]s, regiments in many armies also adopted the wearing of berets.\n\nThe wearing of berets of distinctive colors by elite [[special forces]] originated with the British [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]], whose [[maroon beret]] was officially approved in July 1942,<ref>{{cite book |last=Skinner |first=Rebecca |date=2010 |title=British Paratrooper 1940\u201345 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nLGdCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA6 |location= |publisher=Osprey Publishing  |page=6 |isbn=978-1472805126 }}</ref> followed by the [[Commandos (United Kingdom)|Commando Forces]] whose [[green beret]] was approved in October of that year.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bull |first=Stephen |date=2010 |title=Commando Tactics: The Second World War |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aH10gy_DENAC&pg=PA98 |location= |publisher=Pen & Sword Military |page=98 |isbn=978-1848840744 }}</ref> The [[United States Army Special Forces]] adopted a darker green beret in 1955, although it was not officially approved until 1961.<ref name=\"www.army.mil\" >{{cite web |url=https://www.army.mil/features/beret/beret.htm |title=A Short History of the Use of Berets in the U.S. Army |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010624053826/https://www.army.mil/features/beret/beret.htm#History |archive-date=24 June 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Camouflage berets==\n[[File:Vietnam p05.jpg|thumb|right|A U.S. Navy SEAL in Vietnam with a camouflage beret]]\nA '''camouflage beret''' is  intended for use in the battlefield when wearing [[Battledress|combat fatigues]]. They are mostly issued to the likes of [[special forces]], particularly in jungle warfare operations.\n\n===History===\nCamouflage berets possibly originate from the General Service cap \"Cap, General Service\" issued to the British Army in a Khaki material before the introduction of Berets. It was first introduced under \"Army Council Instruction 1407\" of September 1943. This cap was designed to replace the \"Field Service cap\" or \"FS Cap\" that had been worn since the outbreak of war. These caps were issued in priority to units serving overseas. UK based units got theirs later on. It was at first unpopular due to its over large appearance. This cap was not a beret. It was made from several pieces of drab cloth material, whereas a beret was a one piece item. It was based on the Scottish balmoral bonnet in design. First issues were made from the same gaberdine cloth as the old \"FS\" cap. Badges worn on it were the conventional Officers bronze, and OR's badges in both plastic and metal. Units which had special distinctions could still wear these on the \"GS\" cap. The General Service cap was worn by regulation one inch above the eyebrows, with badge over the left eye and the cap pulled down to the right. But many wartime photos will show it worn pushed back on the head, which seemed to be a fashion with many soldiers late in the War.\n\nOfficers could only obtain the cap upon repayment to the RAOC. They were not allowed to buy the cap until their unit had been issued with it wholesale. Higher ranking Officers often got away with wearing a Khaki beret, which was against regulations. Fashion conscious OR's would also risk punishment from NCO's/officers buying one of these for \"walking out\".\n\nNot exactly camouflage but an early example is the Jungle Beret issued to the Australian Army during WW2.<ref>The Australian Army in World War II - Page 57 Mark Johnson {{ISBN|1472805224}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.medalsgonemissing.com/index.php?params_to_parse=Uniform-Kit-issued-to-the-AIF-During-WW2/5|title=Uniform & Kit issued to the AIF During WW2|website=www.medalsgonemissing.com}}</ref><ref>http://www.austcdoassocvic.com/history1.htm{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Users===\n*{{flagcountry|Argentina}} - Jungle Troops (Brigada de Monte XII \"General Manuel Obligado\")<ref>The other Cazadores de Monte brigades use Dark Green berets</ref>\n*{{flagcountry|Bolivia}} - Special Forces \"Bolivian Condors\"\n*{{flagcountry|Brazil}} - Jungle Troops\n*{{flagcountry|PRC}} - During the 80s, camo berets were issued to some of the recon forces of PLA.

The Chasseurs alpins wore a distinctive large beret (see above{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}) and Major-General Sir [[Hugh Elles]], the TC's Colonel, realised this style of headdress would be a practical option for his [[tank]] crews, forced to work in a reduced space. He thought, however, that the Chasseur beret was \"too sloppy\" and the [[Basque people|Basque]]-style beret of the French tank crews was \"too skimpy\", so a compromise based on the Scottish [[tam o'shanter (hat)|tam o'shanter]] was designed and submitted for the approval of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] in November 1923.

In response, from 1973 through 1979 HQDA permitted local commanders to encourage morale-enhancing uniform distinctions, however these distinctions were only allowed to be worn on the post. Consequently, many units embraced various colored berets, for example Armor and Armored Cavalry units often adopted the black beret. Similarly many other units embraced various colored berets in an attempt to improve dwindling morale. In particular, the First Cavalry Division assigned various colored berets to its three pronged TRICAP approach. In this implementation, Armored Cavalry, Airmobile Infantry units, Air Cavalry units, Division Artillery units, and Division Support units all wore different colored berets, including black, light blue, kelly green, and red. The 101st Airborne Division was authorised a dark blue beret.\n\nIn 1975 all female soldiers of the [[Women's Army Corps]] were authorized to wear a black beret variant as standard headgear for the service uniform.<ref>Stanton, Shelby (1994).

Stackpole Books. p. 223.</ref>\n\nIn 1975 the 172nd Light Infantry Brigade at Fort Richardson & Fort Wainwright, Alaska wore Olive Drab Berets.\n\nIn 2001, Army Chief of Staff Eric Shinseki ordered the black beret worn as standard headgear army-wide, a controversial decision because it was previously reserved for the Rangers. The Rangers were then authorized to wear a tan beret, exclusive to them. The decision was implemented in hopes of boosting morale among conventional units. However, many soldiers began complaining that the new black beret was not practical with the utility uniform. In June 2011, Army Secretary John McHugh, acting on the recommendations made by Chief of Staff Martin Dempsey and Sergeant Major of the Army Raymond F. Chandler, once again chose the traditional patrol cap to be worn with the utility uniform. The black beret may be authorized with utility uniforms at commander's discretion for special ceremonies. The beret remains part of the Army's dress uniform for all units.\n\nUnited States Army berets now use the following distinctive colors:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ <center><big>'''US Army'''</big></center>\n! colspan=\"2\" | Color || Wearer\n|-\n| style=\"background:#00230D;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|| [[Green beret|Rifle green]] || [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces qualified soldiers]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:tan;\"| || [[Tan beret|Tan]] || Soldiers assigned to the [[75th Ranger Regiment]] and the [[Ranger School|Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade]] (Soldiers that have served one year in the regiment and are assigned to a [[USASOC]] component may continue to wear the Tan Beret.)\n|-\n| style=\"background:maroon;\"| || [[Maroon beret|Maroon]] || Soldiers assigned to units on active \"jump status,\" better known as Airborne/Parachute units\n|-\n| style=\"background: SaddleBrown;\"| || [[Brown]] || Soldiers assigned to the [[Security Force Assistance Command]] and its subordinate units\n|-\n| style=\"background:#000;\"| || [[Black beret|Black]] || Worn by all soldiers with Army Service Uniform as standard headgear (The [[patrol cap]] is the standard headgear with utility uniforms such as the ACUs; however, the black beret may be authorized with utility uniforms at commander's discretion.<ref>{{Cite news |first=C.

During the Vietnam War, the U.S. Navy created special boat teams, unofficially dubbed the [[brown-water navy]], to patrol coastlines, estuaries and rivers.

For instance, the [[maroon beret]] is mostly traditional headgear for elite [[airborne forces]] around the world with a few exceptions like the elite [[Russian Airborne Troops]] who instead wear a [[sky blue]] beret or the [[Portuguese Paratroopers]] that wear a [[green beret]].\n[[File:ComandosPT.jpg|thumb|Portuguese Army Commandos with red beret|555x555px]]\n[[File:Bastille Day 2014 Paris - Color guards 010.jpg|thumb|270px|A Ukrainian military cadet in a light blue beret.]]\n==History==\n[[File:C\u00e9sar PAYAN.jpg|thumb|right|A French ''[[chasseur alpin]]'' in World War I, with their distinctive large beret.]]\nThe use of beret-like headgear as a civilian headdress dates back hundreds of years, an early example being the Scottish Blue Bonnet, that became a ''de facto'' symbol of Scottish [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] forces in the 16th and 17th centuries. As an officially required military headdress, its use dates back to the [[Carlist Wars]] of Succession for the Spanish Crown in the 1830s by order of [[Carlism|Carlist]] General [[Tom\u00e1s de Zumalac\u00e1rregui]] who wanted a local and non-costly way to make headgear that was resistant to the mountain weather, easy to care for and could be used on formal occasions.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe French [[Chasseur Alpin|Chasseurs alpins]], created in the early 1880s, were the first regular unit to wear the military beret as a standard headgear.<ref>{{cite book|first=W.Y.|last=Carman|page=26|title=A Dictionary of Military Uniform|ISBN=0-684-15130-8}}</ref> These mountain troops were issued with a uniform which included several features which were innovative for the time, notably the large and floppy blue beret which they still retain.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Mollo|page=200|title=Military Fashion|ISBN=0-214-65349-8}}</ref> This was so unfamiliar a fashion outside France that it had to be described in the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' of 1911 as \"a soft cap or [[tam o'shanter (hat)|tam o'shanter]]\".<ref>\"Uniforms\", page 587, Volume XXVII ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 1911 Edition</ref>\n\nBerets have features that make them attractive to the military: they are cheap, easy to make in large numbers, can be manufactured in a wide range of colors, can be rolled up and stuffed into a pocket or beneath the shirt epaulette without damage, and can be worn with headphones (this is one of the reasons why early tank crews adopted the beret). The beret is not so useful in field conditions for the modern infantryman, who requires protective helmets, and non-camouflage versions are seldom seen on operations.\n\nThe beret was found particularly useful as a uniform for armored-vehicle crews, and the [[Royal Tank Regiment|British Tank Corps]] (later Royal Tank Corps) adopted the headdress as early as 1918.\n\nGerman AFV crews in the late 1930s also adopted a beret with the addition of a padded crash helmet inside. The colour black was worn by the Royal Tank Corps later Royal Tank Regiment, since it did not show oil stains picked up inside the interior of a vehicle. [[Black beret]]s continue to be worn by the Royal Tank Regiment, all other British armoured units wear [[blue beret]]s, regiments in many armies also adopted the wearing of berets.\n\nThe wearing of berets of distinctive colors by elite [[special forces]] originated with the British [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]], whose [[maroon beret]] was officially approved in July 1942,<ref>{{cite book |last=Skinner |first=Rebecca |date=2010 |title=British Paratrooper 1940\u201345 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nLGdCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA6 |location= |publisher=Osprey Publishing  |page=6 |isbn=978-1472805126 }}</ref> followed by the [[Commandos (United Kingdom)|Commando Forces]] whose [[green beret]] was approved in October of that year.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bull |first=Stephen |date=2010 |title=Commando Tactics: The Second World War |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aH10gy_DENAC&pg=PA98 |location= |publisher=Pen & Sword Military |page=98 |isbn=978-1848840744 }}</ref> The [[United States Army Special Forces]] adopted a darker green beret in 1955, although it was not officially approved until 1961.<ref name=\"www.army.mil\" >{{cite web |url=https://www.army.mil/features/beret/beret.htm |title=A Short History of the Use of Berets in the U.S. Army |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010624053826/https://www.army.mil/features/beret/beret.htm#History |archive-date=24 June 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Camouflage berets==\n[[File:Vietnam p05.jpg|thumb|right|A U.S. Navy SEAL in Vietnam with a camouflage beret]]\nA '''camouflage beret''' is  intended for use in the battlefield when wearing [[Battledress|combat fatigues]]. They are mostly issued to the likes of [[special forces]], particularly in jungle warfare operations.\n\n===History===\nCamouflage berets possibly originate from the General Service cap \"Cap, General Service\" issued to the British Army in a Khaki material before the introduction of Berets. It was first introduced under \"Army Council Instruction 1407\" of September 1943. This cap was designed to replace the \"Field Service cap\" or \"FS Cap\" that had been worn since the outbreak of war. These caps were issued in priority to units serving overseas. UK based units got theirs later on. It was at first unpopular due to its over large appearance. This cap was not a beret. It was made from several pieces of drab cloth material, whereas a beret was a one piece item. It was based on the Scottish balmoral bonnet in design. First issues were made from the same gaberdine cloth as the old \"FS\" cap. Badges worn on it were the conventional Officers bronze, and OR's badges in both plastic and metal. Units which had special distinctions could still wear these on the \"GS\" cap. The General Service cap was worn by regulation one inch above the eyebrows, with badge over the left eye and the cap pulled down to the right. But many wartime photos will show it worn pushed back on the head, which seemed to be a fashion with many soldiers late in the War.\n\nOfficers could only obtain the cap upon repayment to the RAOC. They were not allowed to buy the cap until their unit had been issued with it wholesale. Higher ranking Officers often got away with wearing a Khaki beret, which was against regulations. Fashion conscious OR's would also risk punishment from NCO's/officers buying one of these for \"walking out\".\n\nNot exactly camouflage but an early example is the Jungle Beret issued to the Australian Army during WW2.<ref>The Australian Army in World War II - Page 57 Mark Johnson {{ISBN|1472805224}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.medalsgonemissing.com/index.php?params_to_parse=Uniform-Kit-issued-to-the-AIF-During-WW2/5|title=Uniform & Kit issued to the AIF During WW2|website=www.medalsgonemissing.com}}</ref><ref>http://www.austcdoassocvic.com/history1.htm{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Users===\n*{{flagcountry|Argentina}} - Jungle Troops (Brigada de Monte XII \"General Manuel Obligado\")<ref>The other Cazadores de Monte brigades use Dark Green berets</ref>\n*{{flagcountry|Bolivia}} - Special Forces \"Bolivian Condors\"\n*{{flagcountry|Brazil}} - Jungle Troops\n*{{flagcountry|PRC}} - During the 80s, camo berets were issued to some of the recon forces of PLA.

The Chasseurs alpins wore a distinctive large beret (see above{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}) and Major-General Sir [[Hugh Elles]], the TC's Colonel, realised this style of headdress would be a practical option for his [[tank]] crews, forced to work in a reduced space. He thought, however, that the Chasseur beret was \"too sloppy\" and the [[Basque people|Basque]]-style beret of the French tank crews was \"too skimpy\", so a compromise based on the Scottish [[tam o'shanter (hat)|tam o'shanter]] was designed and submitted for the approval of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] in November 1923.

In response, from 1973 through 1979 HQDA permitted local commanders to encourage morale-enhancing uniform distinctions, however these distinctions were only allowed to be worn on the post. Consequently, many units embraced various colored berets, for example Armor and Armored Cavalry units often adopted the black beret. Similarly many other units embraced various colored berets in an attempt to improve dwindling morale. In particular, the First Cavalry Division assigned various colored berets to its three pronged TRICAP approach. In this implementation, Armored Cavalry, Airmobile Infantry units, Air Cavalry units, Division Artillery units, and Division Support units all wore different colored berets, including black, light blue, kelly green, and red. The 101st Airborne Division was authorised a dark blue beret.\n\nIn 1975 all female soldiers of the [[Women's Army Corps]] were authorized to wear a black beret variant as standard headgear for the service uniform.<ref>Stanton, Shelby (1994).

Stackpole Books. p. 223.</ref>\n\nIn 1975 the 172nd Light Infantry Brigade at Fort Richardson & Fort Wainwright, Alaska wore Olive Drab Berets.\n\nIn 2001, Army Chief of Staff Eric Shinseki ordered the black beret worn as standard headgear army-wide, a controversial decision because it was previously reserved for the Rangers. The Rangers were then authorized to wear a tan beret, exclusive to them. The decision was implemented in hopes of boosting morale among conventional units. However, many soldiers began complaining that the new black beret was not practical with the utility uniform. In June 2011, Army Secretary John McHugh, acting on the recommendations made by Chief of Staff Martin Dempsey and Sergeant Major of the Army Raymond F. Chandler, once again chose the traditional patrol cap to be worn with the utility uniform. The black beret may be authorized with utility uniforms at commander's discretion for special ceremonies. The beret remains part of the Army's dress uniform for all units.\n\nUnited States Army berets now use the following distinctive colors:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ <center><big>'''US Army'''</big></center>\n! colspan=\"2\" | Color || Wearer\n|-\n| style=\"background:#00230D;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|| [[Green beret|Rifle green]] || [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces qualified soldiers]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:tan;\"| || [[Tan beret|Tan]] || Soldiers assigned to the [[75th Ranger Regiment]] and the [[Ranger School|Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade]] (Soldiers that have served one year in the regiment and are assigned to a [[USASOC]] component may continue to wear the Tan Beret.)\n|-\n| style=\"background:maroon;\"| || [[Maroon beret|Maroon]] || Soldiers assigned to units on active \"jump status,\" better known as Airborne/Parachute units\n|-\n| style=\"background: SaddleBrown;\"| || [[Brown]] || Soldiers assigned to the [[Security Force Assistance Command]] and its subordinate units\n|-\n| style=\"background:#000;\"| || [[Black beret|Black]] || Worn by all soldiers with Army Service Uniform as standard headgear (The [[patrol cap]] is the standard headgear with utility uniforms such as the ACUs; however, the black beret may be authorized with utility uniforms at commander's discretion.<ref>{{Cite news |first=C.

During the Vietnam War, the U.S. Navy created special boat teams, unofficially dubbed the [[brown-water navy]], to patrol coastlines, estuaries and rivers.

About 11.4% of families and 12.7% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 14.7% of those under age 18 and 11.9% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==History==\n\n{{Essay-like|section|date=December 2007}}\n{{more citations needed|date=February 2008}}\nOn June 20, 1769, William Gray commended the first survey in the Saltsburg area. Early settlers of the wooded region were mainly [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] immigrants. From 1768 until 1795, people migrated west and found the town of Saltsburg and Indiana County. Those settlers did not take full advantage of the area near the Kiskiminetas River until 1795 because of the threat and attacks of Native Americans.<!--HELP! Where did the original text here go?-->\n\nThe name \u201cSaltsburg\u201d assumes a relation of the [[salt]] grain to this town. It is true that salt flourished in this \u201cnewly discovered\u201d area. A Mrs. Deemer was the first who noted this discovery. Around the years 1795-1798, the woman responsible proved salt was present in the Conemaugh River, about one mile above Saltsburg\u2019s present site, in a town now known as Moween. Mrs. Deemer produced a sample of salt by simply evaporating the water from the river.\n\nIn January 1817 the first sale of land was made to the Congregation of Saltsburg. In 1816-1817 Andrew Boggs purchased a large amount of land, which held the first town lots. The town was named with common consent of her first settlers, based on the newly thriving salt industry. The town\u2019s religion was mainly [[Presbyterian]], which was also the denomination of the first church built in Saltsburg. The first house was built in 1820, and now is occupied with the Presbyterian Church.\n\nThe town quickly filled with [[merchants]] in the late 1820s, and the town became a prosperous place to reside. John Carson became the first tailor in 1827. Daniel Davis was the first blacksmith in 1828, and George Johnston was the first merchant in 1829. The population of the town continued to grow, and in 1838, the town was declared a borough. In 1840 the estimated population was 335.\n\nThe primary means of transportation in the area were on foot, carriage, train or boat. The canal and train were fairly new to the people living in the area, but they adapted well. The [[canal]] and [[railroad]] were major trade conduits for the town and the region. As the town grew it became a site for the passage of the main line canal from [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] to [[Pittsburgh]]. Coal and salt were transported along the canal and the building of boats became very important. In 1835 and 1836, Robert Young, Butler Meyers and Jacob Newhouse opened the first canal-boat construction business in the town. Newhouse and his workers crafted some of the finest heavy freight boats the old canal ever saw. For several years boat building was said to be the chief industry of the town. In 1855 the railroad bridge was built, with Major S.S. Jameson as the contractor and with the help of the principal mason John Marth. By 1864 the railroad brought an end to the canal era. The growth of the town was minimal until [[coalmine]]s became prevalent in the 1870s.\n\nDr. John McFarland, a graduate of [[Jefferson Medical College]] was the town\u2019s first physician; he came to Saltsburg in 1836. In addition to being a physician, Dr. McFarland was also the director of the Indiana County Medical Society and an instructor at the Saltsburg Academy. Later he served in the state House of Representatives from 1845\u201346 and became a man of the railroad industry. He was one of the first directors of the Northern Pennsylvania Railroad. The first school was a log house located closer to the trestlework or railroad bridge. John Whittlesey was the first teacher, and John Bucklin was the second. The Saltsburg Academy was established in 1852. It was approximately 52 feet long by 30 feet wide.\n\nThe town of Saltsburg is located in the southwestern corner of [[Indiana County, Pennsylvania]]. It currently has an estimated population of 923. The borough maintains its own police department and currently has one police officer.  Supplemental police protection is provided by the [[Pennsylvania State Police]]. Saltsburg also has its own volunteer fire department (Station 131).  There is an elementary school as well as a high school. They are located next to the [[Kiskiminetas River]]. Being so small, the economy of Saltsburg is based on small restaurants, a few salons, a gas station, and a grocery store.  The Rebecca B. Hadden Stone House Museum is located at 105 Point Street and has survived many floods, the construction of the railroad, and has been standing since the days of the canal. The Saltsburg Area Historical Society is an organization that continues to retain information from the past of the town and the people and their ancestors of the area.\n\nThe [[Saltsburg Historic District]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1992.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Schools==\n* [[Blairsville-Saltsburg School District#Saltsburg Elementary School|Saltsburg Elementary]]\n* [[Blairsville-Saltsburg School District#Saltsburg Junior/Senior High School|Saltsburg Junior/Senior High School]]\n* [[The Kiski School]]\n\n==Events==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Canal Days===\n\nEvery year, Saltsburg holds a celebration in the Canal Park and on Point Street.  The celebration lasts three days in early June and includes crafts, food, live music, games, and a fireworks display. Also a unique tradition is the annual duck race. Plastic Ducks are numbered and thrown into the river from the bridge. If the duck with your number finishes first you win the $500 prize.\n\n=== Community Days ===\n\nSaltsburg holds its own community days in early September called \"Canal Days.\"  The celebration includes many booths along the historical canal in town. The booths contain many crafts, food, and games. It also has live music, fireworks, and an annual poker run bicycle ride.  This ride is generally seven miles along the West Penn Trail. At the end of the ride, each person receives five cards to create a poker hand. The best hand wins.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n1. Anderson, Jenella M.

Early settlers of the wooded region were mainly [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] immigrants. From 1768 until 1795, people migrated west and found the town of Saltsburg and Indiana County. Those settlers did not take full advantage of the area near the Kiskiminetas River until 1795 because of the threat and attacks of Native Americans.<!--HELP! Where did the original text here go?-->\n\nThe name \u201cSaltsburg\u201d assumes a relation of the [[salt]] grain to this town. It is true that salt flourished in this \u201cnewly discovered\u201d area. A Mrs. Deemer was the first who noted this discovery. Around the years 1795-1798, the woman responsible proved salt was present in the Conemaugh River, about one mile above Saltsburg\u2019s present site, in a town now known as Moween. Mrs. Deemer produced a sample of salt by simply evaporating the water from the river.\n\nIn January 1817 the first sale of land was made to the Congregation of Saltsburg. In 1816-1817 Andrew Boggs purchased a large amount of land, which held the first town lots. The town was named with common consent of her first settlers, based on the newly thriving salt industry. The town\u2019s religion was mainly [[Presbyterian]], which was also the denomination of the first church built in Saltsburg. The first house was built in 1820, and now is occupied with the Presbyterian Church.\n\nThe town quickly filled with [[merchants]] in the late 1820s, and the town became a prosperous place to reside. John Carson became the first tailor in 1827. Daniel Davis was the first blacksmith in 1828, and George Johnston was the first merchant in 1829. The population of the town continued to grow, and in 1838, the town was declared a borough. In 1840 the estimated population was 335.\n\nThe primary means of transportation in the area were on foot, carriage, train or boat. The canal and train were fairly new to the people living in the area, but they adapted well. The [[canal]] and [[railroad]] were major trade conduits for the town and the region. As the town grew it became a site for the passage of the main line canal from [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] to [[Pittsburgh]]. Coal and salt were transported along the canal and the building of boats became very important. In 1835 and 1836, Robert Young, Butler Meyers and Jacob Newhouse opened the first canal-boat construction business in the town. Newhouse and his workers crafted some of the finest heavy freight boats the old canal ever saw. For several years boat building was said to be the chief industry of the town. In 1855 the railroad bridge was built, with Major S.S. Jameson as the contractor and with the help of the principal mason John Marth. By 1864 the railroad brought an end to the canal era. The growth of the town was minimal until [[coalmine]]s became prevalent in the 1870s.\n\nDr. John McFarland, a graduate of [[Jefferson Medical College]] was the town\u2019s first physician; he came to Saltsburg in 1836. In addition to being a physician, Dr. McFarland was also the director of the Indiana County Medical Society and an instructor at the Saltsburg Academy. Later he served in the state House of Representatives from 1845\u201346 and became a man of the railroad industry. He was one of the first directors of the Northern Pennsylvania Railroad. The first school was a log house located closer to the trestlework or railroad bridge. John Whittlesey was the first teacher, and John Bucklin was the second. The Saltsburg Academy was established in 1852. It was approximately 52 feet long by 30 feet wide.\n\nThe town of Saltsburg is located in the southwestern corner of [[Indiana County, Pennsylvania]]. It currently has an estimated population of 923. The borough maintains its own police department and currently has one police officer.  Supplemental police protection is provided by the [[Pennsylvania State Police]]. Saltsburg also has its own volunteer fire department (Station 131).  There is an elementary school as well as a high school. They are located next to the [[Kiskiminetas River]]. Being so small, the economy of Saltsburg is based on small restaurants, a few salons, a gas station, and a grocery store.  The Rebecca B. Hadden Stone House Museum is located at 105 Point Street and has survived many floods, the construction of the railroad, and has been standing since the days of the canal. The Saltsburg Area Historical Society is an organization that continues to retain information from the past of the town and the people and their ancestors of the area.\n\nThe [[Saltsburg Historic District]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1992.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Schools==\n* [[Blairsville-Saltsburg School District#Saltsburg Elementary School|Saltsburg Elementary]]\n* [[Blairsville-Saltsburg School District#Saltsburg Junior/Senior High School|Saltsburg Junior/Senior High School]]\n* [[The Kiski School]]\n\n==Events==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Canal Days===\n\nEvery year, Saltsburg holds a celebration in the Canal Park and on Point Street.  The celebration lasts three days in early June and includes crafts, food, live music, games, and a fireworks display. Also a unique tradition is the annual duck race. Plastic Ducks are numbered and thrown into the river from the bridge. If the duck with your number finishes first you win the $500 prize.\n\n=== Community Days ===\n\nSaltsburg holds its own community days in early September called \"Canal Days.\"  The celebration includes many booths along the historical canal in town. The booths contain many crafts, food, and games. It also has live music, fireworks, and an annual poker run bicycle ride.  This ride is generally seven miles along the West Penn Trail. At the end of the ride, each person receives five cards to create a poker hand. The best hand wins.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n1. Anderson, Jenella M.
