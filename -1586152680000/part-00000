The film was directed by [[Chris Sanders]] and [[Dean DeBlois]] from a screenplay by [[William Davies (screenwriter)|Will Davies]], Sanders, and DeBlois, and stars the voices of [[Jay Baruchel]], [[Gerard Butler]], [[Craig Ferguson]], [[America Ferrera]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]], [[T.J. Miller]], and [[Kristen Wiig]]. The story takes place in a mythical [[Vikings|Viking]] world where a young Viking teenager named Hiccup aspires to follow his tribe's tradition of becoming a [[dragon]] slayer. After finally capturing his first dragon, and with his chance at last of gaining the tribe's acceptance, he finds that he no longer wants to kill the dragon and instead befriends it.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Universal Amphitheater|Gibson Amphitheater]] on March 21, 2010,<ref name=\"HTTYDPremiere\" /> and was released in the United States five days later on March 26. The film was a critical and commercial success, earning praise from film critics and audiences and earning nearly $500 million worldwide. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] at the [[83rd Academy Awards]], but lost to ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' and ''[[The Social Network]]'', respectively. ''How to Train Your Dragon'' also won ten [[Annie Awards]], including [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]].\n\nTwo sequels, ''[[How to Train Your Dragon 2]]'' and ''[[How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World]]'', were released on June 13, 2014, and February 22, 2019, respectively. Much like their predecessor, both sequels were widely praised and became box office successes. The film's success has also inspired other merchandise, including a [[How to Train Your Dragon (video game)|video game]] and a [[DreamWorks Dragons|television series]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe [[Vikings|Viking]] village of Berk, located on a remote island, is attacked frequently by dragons, which take livestock and damage property. Hiccup, the awkward fifteen-year-old son of the village chieftain, Stoick the Vast, is deemed too scrawny and weak to fight the dragons, so he instead creates mechanical devices under his apprenticeship with Gobber, the village blacksmith, though Hiccup's inventions often backfire. During one attack, Hiccup uses a [[bolas]] launcher to shoot down a Night Fury, a dangerous and rare dragon of which little is known, but no one believes him, so he searches for the fallen dragon on his own. He finds the dragon in the forest, tangled in his net, but cannot bring himself to kill it, and instead sets it free.\n\nStoick assembles a fleet to find the dragons' nest, and enters Hiccup in a dragon-fighting class taught by Gobber with the other teenagers, Fishlegs, Snotlout, Ruffnut, Tuffnut, and Astrid, a tough Viking girl on whom Hiccup has a crush, to train while he is away. Hiccup returns to the forest and finds the Night Fury still there, unable to fly because Hiccup's bolas tore off half of its tail fin. Hiccup befriends the dragon by offering fish, giving it the name 'Toothless', after its retractable teeth. Feeling guilty for crippling Toothless, Hiccup designs a harness rig and a [[prosthetic]] fin that allow the dragon to fly with Hiccup controlling the prosthetic.\n\nHiccup learns about dragon behavior as he works with Toothless, and is able to nonviolently subdue all the captive dragons during training, earning him the admiration of his peers but causing Astrid to become increasingly suspicious of his behavior. Meanwhile, Stoick's fleet arrives home unsuccessful, though Stoick is cheered by Hiccup's unexpected success in dragon training. Hiccup is judged the winner of his training class, and must kill a dragon for his final exam. He tries to run away with Toothless, only to be followed by Astrid in the forest. Hiccup takes Astrid for a flight to demonstrate that the dragon is friendly. When Astrid reminds Hiccup of the exam, Toothless unexpectedly takes the pair to the dragons' nest, where they discover a gargantuan dragon named the Red Death, which eats the smaller dragons unless they constantly bring it live food; the two realize that the dragons have been attacking Berk under duress. Astrid wishes to tell the village about their discovery, but Hiccup advises against it to protect Toothless.\n\nBack at the village the next day, Hiccup faces a captive Monstrous Nightmare dragon in his final exam. Instead of killing it, however, he subdues it in an attempt to prove that dragons are peaceful. When Stoick inadvertently angers the dragon into attacking, Toothless arrives to protect Hiccup, but is captured by the Vikings in the process. Hiccup accidentally reveals to Stoick that Toothless knows the location of the dragons' nest; Stoick disowns his son, and sets off for the nest with Toothless chained to the lead ship as a guide. After the Vikings have left, Hiccup is devastated, but Astrid prompts him to come to the realization that he spared Toothless out of compassion and empathy, not weakness. Hiccup then regains his confidence to go after Toothless and save him along with Astrid and the other teens.\n\nThe Viking attackers locate and break open the dragon's nest, causing most of the dragons to fly out, but also awakening the Red Death, which soon overwhelms the Vikings. Hiccup, Astrid, and their fellow pupils fly in, riding Berk's captive training dragons, providing cover fire, and distracting the Red Death while Hiccup frees Toothless. Hiccup almost drowns while doing so, but Stoick saves them both, reconciling with his son. Toothless and Hiccup destroy the Red Death by puncturing its wing membranes and then tricking the beast into making a plunge from which it cannot pull up after shooting a fireball into its mouth. Hiccup is injured in the fight, losing his lower left leg. Hiccup awakens back on Berk, finding that Gobber has fashioned him a prosthesis, and he is now admired by his village, especially Astrid, who kisses him. Berk begins a new era, with humans and dragons living in harmony.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jay Baruchel]] as Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, the awkward son of Stoick the Vast.<ref name=cast>\"Viking-Sized Cast\", ''How to Train Your Dragon'' Blu-ray</ref>\n* [[America Ferrera]] as Astrid Hofferson, Hiccup's fellow student in dragon training and his love interest. \n* [[Gerard Butler]] as Stoick the Vast, the chieftain of Berk and Hiccup's father.<ref name=cast/>\n* [[Craig Ferguson]] as Gobber the Belch, Berk's blacksmith, a close friend of Stoick's and teacher of the tribe's young dragon-training recruits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_17051.html |title=Gerard Butler Interview, Movies Online |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722103059/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_17051.html |archivedate=July 22, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=cast/>\n* [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]] as Fishlegs Ingerman, an enthusiastic youth knowledgeable in dragon lore which he often relates in [[role-playing game]] style.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nadder, Zippleback and Gronckle Lessons From 'How to Train Your Dragon' |work=Lineboil |date=February 17, 2010 |url=http://lineboil.com/2010/02/nadder-zippleback-and-gronckle-lessons-from-how-to-train-your-dragon |accessdate=February 17, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223003151/http://lineboil.com/2010/02/nadder-zippleback-and-gronckle-lessons-from-how-to-train-your-dragon/ |archivedate=February 23, 2010}}</ref><ref name=cast/>\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Snotlout Jorgenson, one of Hiccup's dragon-training classmates.

The original plot was described as, \"heavily loyal to the book\", but was regarded as being too \"sweet\" and \"whimsical\" as well as geared towards a too-young demographic, according to Baruchel.<ref name=\"devusatoday\">[https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2009-11-04-how-to-tame-a-dragon_N.htm First look: DreamWorks' 3-D 'How to Train Your Dragon'].

In the film, Toothless is a Night Fury, the rarest of all dragons, far faster, aerodynamic and more powerful than the other species, and is large enough to serve as a flying mount for both Hiccup and Astrid. The filmmakers hired cinematographer [[Roger Deakins]] (known for frequently collaborating with [[the Coen brothers]]) as a visual consultant to help them with lighting and overall look of the film and to \"add a live-action feel\".<ref name=\"devusatoday\"/> Extensive research was done to depict both flight, as the directors knew they would be the biggest draw of the film's 3D effects, and fire, given animation could break away from the limitations seen in live-action films, where [[propane]] flames are usual due to being easier to extinguish. The dragons' design made sure to create animals that were comical and also innovative compared to other dragon fiction.

Powell composed an orchestral score, combining bombastic brass with loud percussion and soothing strings, while also using exotic, Scottish and Irish tones with instruments like the [[penny whistle]] and [[bagpipes]]. Additionally, Icelandic singer [[J\u00f3n \u00de\u00f3r Birgisson|J\u00f3nsi]] wrote and performed the song \"Sticks & Stones\" for the film. The score was released by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] on March 23, 2010.\n\nOverall, the score was well received by film score critics.

The film was directed by [[Chris Sanders]] and [[Dean DeBlois]] from a screenplay by [[William Davies (screenwriter)|Will Davies]], Sanders, and DeBlois, and stars the voices of [[Jay Baruchel]], [[Gerard Butler]], [[Craig Ferguson]], [[America Ferrera]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]], [[T.J. Miller]], and [[Kristen Wiig]]. The story takes place in a mythical [[Vikings|Viking]] world where a young Viking teenager named Hiccup aspires to follow his tribe's tradition of becoming a [[dragon]] slayer. After finally capturing his first dragon, and with his chance at last of gaining the tribe's acceptance, he finds that he no longer wants to kill the dragon and instead befriends it.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Universal Amphitheater|Gibson Amphitheater]] on March 21, 2010,<ref name=\"HTTYDPremiere\" /> and was released in the United States five days later on March 26. The film was a critical and commercial success, earning praise from film critics and audiences and earning nearly $500 million worldwide. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] at the [[83rd Academy Awards]], but lost to ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' and ''[[The Social Network]]'', respectively. ''How to Train Your Dragon'' also won ten [[Annie Awards]], including [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]].\n\nTwo sequels, ''[[How to Train Your Dragon 2]]'' and ''[[How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World]]'', were released on June 13, 2014, and February 22, 2019, respectively. Much like their predecessor, both sequels were widely praised and became box office successes. The film's success has also inspired other merchandise, including a [[How to Train Your Dragon (video game)|video game]] and a [[DreamWorks Dragons|television series]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe [[Vikings|Viking]] village of Berk, located on a remote island, is attacked frequently by dragons, which take livestock and damage property. Hiccup, the awkward fifteen-year-old son of the village chieftain, Stoick the Vast, is deemed too scrawny and weak to fight the dragons, so he instead creates mechanical devices under his apprenticeship with Gobber, the village blacksmith, though Hiccup's inventions often backfire. During one attack, Hiccup uses a [[bolas]] launcher to shoot down a Night Fury, a dangerous and rare dragon of which little is known, but no one believes him, so he searches for the fallen dragon on his own. He finds the dragon in the forest, tangled in his net, but cannot bring himself to kill it, and instead sets it free.\n\nStoick assembles a fleet to find the dragons' nest, and enters Hiccup in a dragon-fighting class taught by Gobber with the other teenagers, Fishlegs, Snotlout, Ruffnut, Tuffnut, and Astrid, a tough Viking girl on whom Hiccup has a crush, to train while he is away. Hiccup returns to the forest and finds the Night Fury still there, unable to fly because Hiccup's bolas tore off half of its tail fin. Hiccup befriends the dragon by offering fish, giving it the name 'Toothless', after its retractable teeth. Feeling guilty for crippling Toothless, Hiccup designs a harness rig and a [[prosthetic]] fin that allow the dragon to fly with Hiccup controlling the prosthetic.\n\nHiccup learns about dragon behavior as he works with Toothless, and is able to nonviolently subdue all the captive dragons during training, earning him the admiration of his peers but causing Astrid to become increasingly suspicious of his behavior. Meanwhile, Stoick's fleet arrives home unsuccessful, though Stoick is cheered by Hiccup's unexpected success in dragon training. Hiccup is judged the winner of his training class, and must kill a dragon for his final exam. He tries to run away with Toothless, only to be followed by Astrid in the forest. Hiccup takes Astrid for a flight to demonstrate that the dragon is friendly. When Astrid reminds Hiccup of the exam, Toothless unexpectedly takes the pair to the dragons' nest, where they discover a gargantuan dragon named the Red Death, which eats the smaller dragons unless they constantly bring it live food; the two realize that the dragons have been attacking Berk under duress. Astrid wishes to tell the village about their discovery, but Hiccup advises against it to protect Toothless.\n\nBack at the village the next day, Hiccup faces a captive Monstrous Nightmare dragon in his final exam. Instead of killing it, however, he subdues it in an attempt to prove that dragons are peaceful. When Stoick inadvertently angers the dragon into attacking, Toothless arrives to protect Hiccup, but is captured by the Vikings in the process. Hiccup accidentally reveals to Stoick that Toothless knows the location of the dragons' nest; Stoick disowns his son, and sets off for the nest with Toothless chained to the lead ship as a guide. After the Vikings have left, Hiccup is devastated, but Astrid prompts him to come to the realization that he spared Toothless out of compassion and empathy, not weakness. Hiccup then regains his confidence to go after Toothless and save him along with Astrid and the other teens.\n\nThe Viking attackers locate and break open the dragon's nest, causing most of the dragons to fly out, but also awakening the Red Death, which soon overwhelms the Vikings. Hiccup, Astrid, and their fellow pupils fly in, riding Berk's captive training dragons, providing cover fire, and distracting the Red Death while Hiccup frees Toothless. Hiccup almost drowns while doing so, but Stoick saves them both, reconciling with his son. Toothless and Hiccup destroy the Red Death by puncturing its wing membranes and then tricking the beast into making a plunge from which it cannot pull up after shooting a fireball into its mouth. Hiccup is injured in the fight, losing his lower left leg. Hiccup awakens back on Berk, finding that Gobber has fashioned him a prosthesis, and he is now admired by his village, especially Astrid, who kisses him. Berk begins a new era, with humans and dragons living in harmony.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jay Baruchel]] as Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, the awkward son of Stoick the Vast.<ref name=cast>\"Viking-Sized Cast\", ''How to Train Your Dragon'' Blu-ray</ref>\n* [[America Ferrera]] as Astrid Hofferson, Hiccup's fellow student in dragon training and his love interest. \n* [[Gerard Butler]] as Stoick the Vast, the chieftain of Berk and Hiccup's father.<ref name=cast/>\n* [[Craig Ferguson]] as Gobber the Belch, Berk's blacksmith, a close friend of Stoick's and teacher of the tribe's young dragon-training recruits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_17051.html |title=Gerard Butler Interview, Movies Online |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722103059/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_17051.html |archivedate=July 22, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=cast/>\n* [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]] as Fishlegs Ingerman, an enthusiastic youth knowledgeable in dragon lore which he often relates in [[role-playing game]] style.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nadder, Zippleback and Gronckle Lessons From 'How to Train Your Dragon' |work=Lineboil |date=February 17, 2010 |url=http://lineboil.com/2010/02/nadder-zippleback-and-gronckle-lessons-from-how-to-train-your-dragon |accessdate=February 17, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223003151/http://lineboil.com/2010/02/nadder-zippleback-and-gronckle-lessons-from-how-to-train-your-dragon/ |archivedate=February 23, 2010}}</ref><ref name=cast/>\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Snotlout Jorgenson, one of Hiccup's dragon-training classmates.

In the film, Toothless is a Night Fury, the rarest of all dragons, far faster, aerodynamic and more powerful than the other species, and is large enough to serve as a flying mount for both Hiccup and Astrid.

The storyline was that Bundy and Studd, along with Heenan, claimed that the Giant Machine was a masked Andre the Giant, and was competing under the mask and alias to circumvent an earlier suspension (due to no-showing for an event), but none of them ever proved that Andre and the Giant Machine were one and the same. Eventually, Bundy and Studd began teaming up with Heenan in a series of six-man tag team matches against the Machines (usually, Big and Super; as Andre's health was starting to deteriorate at this time, the Giant Machine made occasional appearances, but more often than not, it was either Captain [[Lou Albano]] or a number of popular faces\u2014often, Hogan, [[Roddy Piper]] and others\u2014who teamed with the other Machines). Bundy and Studd were regularly beaten, but won their last match over the Super-Big version of the Machines at Madison Square Garden. Also in the latter half of 1986, Bundy and Studd received shots at the WWF Tag Team Championship against [[The British Bulldogs]], but were unsuccessful, often losing by disqualification. Studd left the WWF shortly after their last match with the Machines, and Bundy went back to singles competition.\n\nAt [[WrestleMania III]], Bundy was involved in a mixed six-man tag team match, teaming up with [[Midget professional wrestler|midget wrestlers]] [[Shigeri Akabane|Little Tokyo]] and [[Eric Tovey|Lord Littlebrook]] against [[Hillbilly Jim]], the [[Raymond Kessler|Haiti Kid]] and [[Lionel Giroux|Little Beaver]]. During the match, after being pestered by Beaver, Bundy body-slammed him and delivered a big elbow, causing his team's disqualification and his own tag partners to turn against him.<ref name=\"WM III\">{{cite news|title=WrestleMania III Results|publisher=WWE|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm3/results/|accessdate=February 14, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s|last=Shields|first=Brian|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2006|isbn=1-4165-3257-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria/page/81 81]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria/page/81}}</ref> At the [[King of the Ring (1987)|1987 King of the Ring]] on September 4, Bundy made it to the finals of the [[King of the Ring tournament]], where he was defeated by [[Randy Savage]].

In April 1997, he resurfaced in magazines when he joined a faction managed by [[Kenny Casanova]] called \"Camp Casanova\" along with \"Danger\" Dave DeJohn and the Masked Maniac at times in USWF, NBW, and USA Power Pro Wrestling. In a match against \"the Seven Foot Tall\" Primo Canera III, Bundy knee-dropped his opponent and then \"Bundy-splashed\" him. The impact actually broke the ring, leaving the two grapplers in a pit in the center of the squared circle. This independent footage was picked up by ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]''.\n\nHis feuds against [[Jimmy Snuka|\"Superfly\" Jimmy Snuka]], [[Doink the Clown]], and [[Tom Brandi]] were among many main events in the northeast independent circuit. In 1999, at the Kolf Arena in [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]] he won the [[WSL World Heavyweight Championship|AWA Superstars of Wrestling Heavyweight Championship]] from Jonnie Stewart. Later that same year, Bundy the reigning AWA heavyweight champion wrestled again headlining an AWA \"Super Event\" at the [[Dee Events Center]] in Ogden, Utah. That night ended differently for Bundy, losing a \"bodyslam match\" to Koszmar Polski who was managed by [[Ken Patera]]. Bundy still wrestled across the country, primarily in the Southern and Eastern United States. He continued to be a headliner and a crowd favorite at all events he attended. King Kong Bundy's last match is thought to have been at the Legends of Wrestling Show at the Pulaski County Fair in Somerset, Kentucky in 2007.

The storyline was that Bundy and Studd, along with Heenan, claimed that the Giant Machine was a masked Andre the Giant, and was competing under the mask and alias to circumvent an earlier suspension (due to no-showing for an event), but none of them ever proved that Andre and the Giant Machine were one and the same. Eventually, Bundy and Studd began teaming up with Heenan in a series of six-man tag team matches against the Machines (usually, Big and Super; as Andre's health was starting to deteriorate at this time, the Giant Machine made occasional appearances, but more often than not, it was either Captain [[Lou Albano]] or a number of popular faces\u2014often, Hogan, [[Roddy Piper]] and others\u2014who teamed with the other Machines). Bundy and Studd were regularly beaten, but won their last match over the Super-Big version of the Machines at Madison Square Garden. Also in the latter half of 1986, Bundy and Studd received shots at the WWF Tag Team Championship against [[The British Bulldogs]], but were unsuccessful, often losing by disqualification. Studd left the WWF shortly after their last match with the Machines, and Bundy went back to singles competition.\n\nAt [[WrestleMania III]], Bundy was involved in a mixed six-man tag team match, teaming up with [[Midget professional wrestler|midget wrestlers]] [[Shigeri Akabane|Little Tokyo]] and [[Eric Tovey|Lord Littlebrook]] against [[Hillbilly Jim]], the [[Raymond Kessler|Haiti Kid]] and [[Lionel Giroux|Little Beaver]]. During the match, after being pestered by Beaver, Bundy body-slammed him and delivered a big elbow, causing his team's disqualification and his own tag partners to turn against him.<ref name=\"WM III\">{{cite news|title=WrestleMania III Results|publisher=WWE|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm3/results/|accessdate=February 14, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s|last=Shields|first=Brian|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2006|isbn=1-4165-3257-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria/page/81 81]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria/page/81}}</ref> At the [[King of the Ring (1987)|1987 King of the Ring]] on September 4, Bundy made it to the finals of the [[King of the Ring tournament]], where he was defeated by [[Randy Savage]].

Although no longer appearing on the WWF's syndicated TV shows, Bundy continued to wrestle house shows in early 1988 (often losing to [[Bam Bam Bigelow]]); his last match during his initial WWF run was a televised match at [[Madison Square Garden]] in February 1988, teaming up with One Man Gang in a loss to [[Don Muraco]] and [[The Ultimate Warrior]].\n\n=== Semi-retirement (1988\u20131994) ===\nAfter leaving the WWF in 1988, Bundy went into semi-retirement, wrestling only a handful of matches.

In a match against \"the Seven Foot Tall\" Primo Canera III, Bundy knee-dropped his opponent and then \"Bundy-splashed\" him.
