It is the fourth-largest city of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and, together with [[Greifswald]], Stralsund forms an ''Oberzentrum'', one of four high-level [[List of cities in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|urban centers of the region]].\n\nStralsund was granted city rights in 1234 and was one of the most prospering members of the medieval Hanseatic League. In 1628, during the [[Thirty Years' War]], Stralsund came under [[Siege of Stralsund (1628)|Swedish]] rule and remained so until the upheavals of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In the 19th century it became part of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and Germany. Since 2002, Stralsund's old town with its rich heritage is honored as a [[List of World Heritage Sites in Germany|UNESCO World Heritage]], along with [[Wismar]] in [[Mecklenburg]].\n\nThe main industries of Stralsund are [[shipyard]]s, fishing, [[mechanical engineering]], and, to an increasing degree, [[Tourism in Germany|tourism]], [[life sciences]], services and [[high tech]] industries, especially [[information technology]] and [[biotechnology]].\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Stralsund, Altstadt (2011-05-21) 4.JPG|thumb|Aerial view of Stralsund and its [[World heritage site|world heritage]] [[Altstadt|old town]] island]]\n\n=== Location ===\nThe town of Stralsund is located in northeastern [[Germany]] in the region of [[Western Pomerania]] in the state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]].\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:STRALSUND nieder.svg|thumb|upright|left|Precipitation diagram]]\nIts [[precipitation (meteorology)|annual precipitation]] is 656&nbsp;mm (25.8 inches) and comparatively low, falling within the lowest third of all precipitation values in Germany. The driest month is February; the most precipitation falls in July. The precipitation varies relatively moderately throughout the year. Only 40% of weather stations in Germany exhibit lower seasonal variation.\n\n=== Landscapes, hills and rivers ===\n[[File:Stralsund, Germany, R\u00fcgenbr\u00fccke, Pylon und alte Klappbr\u00fccke (2006-09-12).JPG|thumb|right|[[Strelasund Crossing|R\u00fcgen Bridge]], Germany's largest bridge, connects Stralsund with [[R\u00fcgen]] Island]]\n\nThe town lies on the sound of [[Strelasund]], a [[strait]] of the [[Baltic Sea]]. Its geographic proximity to the island of [[R\u00fcgen]], whose only fixed link to the mainland, the [[Strelasund Crossing]], runs between Stralsund and the village of [[Altef\u00e4hr]], has given Stralsund the sobriquet \"Gateway to the Island of R\u00fcgen\" (''Tor zur Insel R\u00fcgen''). Stralsund is located close to the [[Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park]].\n\nStralsund's town borough includes municipal forest and three municipal ponds (the ''Knieperteich, Frankenteich'' and ''Moorteich''. The three ponds and the Strelasund lend the Old Town, the original settlement site and historic center of the town, a protected island ambience. The highest point of the town is the ''Galgenberg'' (\"Gallows Hill\") on its western approaches.\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nThe town's territory covers an area of 38.97&nbsp;km\u00b2, which makes Stralsund, with its nearly 58,000 inhabitants one of the most densely populated towns in [[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]] (1,480 inhabitants per km\u00b2).\n\nThe borough of the Hanseatic town of Stralsund is divided into as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n!

Merchants from other countries as well as locals were attracted to the area  and made up one third of the town's population. The Danish navy used the isle as well. When the settlement had grown to town size, prince [[Wizlaw I]] of R\u00fcgen granted [[L\u00fcbeck law]] to \"our town Stralow\" in 1234, although a significant settlement had existed long before the formal founding.<ref name=\"heritage\"/> In 1240, when the prince gave additional land to the town, he called it ''Stralesund''.\n\nThe success of the settlement challenged the powerful [[Free City of L\u00fcbeck]], which burnt Stralsund down in 1249. Afterwards the town was rebuilt with a massive [[town wall]] having 11 [[town gates]] and 30 watchtowers. The ''Neustadt'', a town-like suburb, had merged with Stralsund by 1361. ''Schadegard'', a nearby twin town to Stralsund also founded by Wizlaw I, though not granted German law, served as the principal stronghold and enclosed a fort. It was given up and torn down by 1269 under pressure from the Stralsund ''[[bourgeoisie|B\u00fcrger]]''.\n\nIn 1293 Stralsund became a member of the [[Hanseatic League]].<ref name=EBstral/>  A total of 300 [[Cog (ship)|ships]] flying the flag of Stralsund cruised the [[Baltic Sea]] in the 14th century.

Lost to [[Electorate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] in the [[Battle of Stralsund (1678)]], it reverted to Sweden in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679)]]. In the [[Great Northern War]] in 1715 [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] led the [[Battle of Stralsund (1715)|defence of Stralsund]] for a year against the united European armies. Stralsund remained under Swedish control until the [[Battle of Stralsund (1807)]], when [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s army occupied it. Seized by [[Ferdinand von Schill]]'s [[freikorps]] in 1809, it [[Battle of Stralsund (1809)|subsequently reverted to French control]], with Schill killed in action. With the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815), Stralsund became a part of the [[Prussia]]n [[Pomerania Province (1815-1945)|Province of Pomerania]] and the seat of a [[government region]] resembling the former [[Swedish Pomerania]].\n\nFollowing the [[First World War]] Stralsund suffered the same sort of political unrest and unemployment that afflicted much of Germany. In May 1919 Stralsund workers clashed with police, and martial law was declared.{{by whom|date=July 2016}} In the early 1920s the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democratic Party]] (USPD) became the strongest party in Stralsund, but its political fortunes waned rapidly, and in September 1922 it reunited with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD).\n\nIn the national parliamentary election of May 1924, the conservative [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP) polled 8,547 votes in Stralsund, the SPD 3,534, the Communists 1,825 and the [[German People's Party]] (DVP) of Foreign Minister [[Gustav Stresemann]] 1,417. However, in keeping with national trends, [[Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Party|National Socialists]] made rapid gains in the late 1920s, and by the time of the last free national election in July 1932 the Nazis polled twice as many votes in Stralsund as the SPD.\n\nDuring the Nazi period (1933\u20131945), Stralsund's military installations expanded, and a naval training base opened on the nearby island of [[D\u00e4nholm]]. In [[World War II]] the city was subjected to repeated Allied bombing. Attacks by the U.S. Army Air Forces in 1944 killed some 800 Stralsunders and destroyed an estimated 8,000 dwellings. The [[354th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|354th Rifle Division]] of the [[Red Army]] occupied Stralsund on April 28, 1945 \u2013 10 days before the end of the war in Europe. Approximately half its population had fled.\n\nDuring the period of the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR), Stralsund saw the construction of numerous ''Plattenbau'' prefabricated apartment blocks. Its economic life centered on the now state-owned shipyard, which largely focussed on building ships for the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nAfter [[German reunification]] in 1990, the city's historic old town was thoroughly restored, and Communist-era apartment blocks were renovated and upgraded. In 2002 the old towns of Stralsund and [[Wismar]], some 120 km to the west, were listed as [[UNESCO world heritage]] sites. Stralsund's shipyard was privatized, and thereafter specialized in constructing container ships.\n\n== Culture and sights ==\n{{Infobox UNESCO World Heritage Site\n| Part_of     = Historic Centres of Stralsund and [[Wismar]]\n| Image       = Nikolaikirche Rathaus HST.jpg\n| Caption     = Stralsund: Old Market Square with the Town Hall and the Nikolaikirche\n| Criteria    = Cultural: ii, iv\n| ID          = 1067\n| Year        = 2002\n| Area        = 80 ha\n| Buffer_zone = 340 ha\n}}\n\n=== Main sights ===\n* The historic Stralsund old town island is a [[UNESCO]] [[List of World Heritage Sites in Germany|World Heritage Site]]. It features many valuable remnants of the Hanseatic time, [[Brick Gothic]], [[Renaissance architecture|renaissance]], [[Baroque architecture|baroque]], [[Revival architecture|historicist]] and [[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]] buildings.\n* The heart of the old town is the Old Market Square (''Alter Markt''), with the Gothic Town Hall (13th century). Behind the town hall soars the imposing ''Nikolaikirche'' ([[St. Nicholas' Church (Stralsund)|St. Nicholas' Church]]), built in 1270\u20131360. The square is surrounded by houses from different periods, including the Gothic ''Wulflamhaus'' (a 14th-century patrician house, today a restaurant), and the Baroque ''Commandantenhus'' of 1751, the old headquarters of the Swedish military commander.\n* The ''Jakobikirche'' (Saint James's Church), built in mid-14th century. It was destroyed several times, e.g. by [[Wallenstein]] and in [[World War II]].\n* The ''Marienkirche'' ([[St. Mary's church, Stralsund|Saint Mary's Church]]), built in 1383\u20131473 in [[Gothic style]], is the largest church in Stralsund, and from 1625\u20141647 it was the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world#History|world's tallest structure]].

It is now a floating museum.\n* The ''Katharinenkloster'' (Monastery of Saint Catherine), mainly built in the 15th century, houses two museums today: Stralsund's ''Museum of Cultural History'' (known for e.g. the ''[[Hiddensee treasure|Gold Jewellery of Hiddensee]]''),<ref>[http://museum.stralsund.de/en/ Museum of Cultural History Stralsund]</ref> and the [[German Oceanographic Museum]], Germany's largest aquarium and oceanographic collection. The ancient [[refectory]] of the monastery is one of the most spectacular Gothic interiors in Germany.\n* Besides the mentioned [[German Oceanographic Museum]] at the Katharinenkloster, Stralsund has other museums dedicated to marine life, including the popular [[Ozeaneum]] that was voted ''[[European Museum of the Year Award|European Museum of the Year]]'' in 2010. There is also a nautical center, the Nautineum, on [[D\u00e4nholm]] island and the ''Marinemuseum D\u00e4nholm'', showcasing the military history of the German Navy, especially the interwar [[Reichsmarine]]. It also hosts one of the last remaining GDR [[Volksmarine]] (People's Navy) torpedo boats.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Buildings and monuments ===\n;Old Town (''Altstadt'')\nThe centre of Stralsund has a wealth of historic buildings. Since 1990, large parts of the historic old town have been renovated with private and public capital, and with the support of foundations. As a result of the contempt for historic buildings in [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]] many houses were threatened by ruin. The Old Town in particular offers a rich variety of historic buildings, with many former merchants' houses, churches, streets and squares. Of more than 800 listed buildings in Stralsund, more than 500 are designated as individual monuments in the Old Town. In twenty years, from the ''Wende'' (turning point) in 1990 to November 2010, 588 of the more than 1,000 old buildings were completely refurbished, including 363 individual monuments.<ref>''64 H\u00e4user in der Altstadt auf der Missstands-Liste'', in: [[Ostsee-Zeitung]] Stralsund dated  4 November 2010</ref> Because of its historical and architectural significance, in 2002 Stralsund's old town together with the old town of [[Wismar]] were added to entitled the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Germany|UNESCO World Cultural Heritage list]] as the \"Historic Centres of Stralsund and Wismar\".\n\n[[File:Alter Markt Stralsund.jpg|275px|thumb|Old Market Square (''Alter Markt'')]]\n;Old Market Square (''Alter Markt'')\nThe ensemble of buildings on the Old Market Square includes the St. Nicholas Church; the Town Hall (''Rathaus''), one of the most important [[secular building]]s of North German [[Brick Gothic]] architecture; the Artushof, the Wulflamhaus, the Commandantenhus, the Gewerkschaftshaus and a new apartment complex. \n;Old Town houses\nThe historic houses with their distinctive gables, often renovated at a high financial cost, dominate the scene in the streets of the Old Town. The former Swedish Government Palace is now home to the town construction department. The Museum of Cultural History Museum in ''M\u00f6nchstrasse'', in one of the most important surviving original houses of the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] era, was refurbished with funds from the [[Deutsche Stiftung Denkmalschutz|German Foundation for Monument Conservation]] It offers a guide to understanding the town's history over seven centuries.\n\n;Churches\nThree large [[medieval]] [[Brick Gothic]] buildings \u2013 [[St. Mary's Church, Stralsund|St. Mary's Church]], [[St. Nicholas' Church (Stralsund)|St. Nicholas' Church]] and St. James Church, point to the medieval significance of Stralsund. Today St. James' is used purely as a cultural venue, its parish being served now by the Church of the Holy Spirit, which also dates from the 14th century. Two other churches on the Old Market Square and the ''Neuer Markt'' are still used for church services. The tower of St. Mary's on the ''Neuer Markt'' offers a panoramic view over Stralsund and the island of R\u00fcgen. \n;Monasteries\nSt. John's Abbey, (the ''Johanniskloster''), a [[Franciscan]] monastery from 1254, now houses the Stralsund Town Archives. Regular cultural events also take place here, such as open-air theater productions.\n\nThe Gothic abbey of St. Anne and St. Bridget (''Kloster St. Annen und Brigitten'') in ''Schillstrasse'' was established around 1560 from the merger of the abbey of ''St. Anne'' (1480) and the double abbey of ''Mariakron'' (1421).\n\nThe Abbey of St. J\u00fcrgen (''Kloster St. J\u00fcrgen am Strande'') on ''M\u00f6nchstrasse'' was mentioned in 1278 for the first time. It served in the 14th century as an old people's home. In 1743 a new building, the ''Kleines St. J\u00fcrgen Kloster'', was built at ''Kniepertor'' and the site was extended in 1754 to create old people's flats and in 1841 for widow's apartments.\n\nFirst mentioned in 1256, the ''Heilgeistkloster'' is now the Hospital of the Holy Spirit.\n\n[[File:Stralsund, am Hafen (2013-07-11), by Klugschnacker in Wikipedia (39).JPG|thumb|left|200px|Old Port with [[Ozeaneum]], warehouses and historical ships including the ''[[Gorch Fock (1933)|Gorch Fock]]'']]\n;Port\nFerries to [[Hiddensee]] and [[Altef\u00e4hr]], as well as harbor tour boats, dock at the port.

In 1628, during the [[Thirty Years' War]], Stralsund came under [[Siege of Stralsund (1628)|Swedish]] rule and remained so until the upheavals of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

Merchants from other countries as well as locals were attracted to the area  and made up one third of the town's population. The Danish navy used the isle as well. When the settlement had grown to town size, prince [[Wizlaw I]] of R\u00fcgen granted [[L\u00fcbeck law]] to \"our town Stralow\" in 1234, although a significant settlement had existed long before the formal founding.<ref name=\"heritage\"/> In 1240, when the prince gave additional land to the town, he called it ''Stralesund''.\n\nThe success of the settlement challenged the powerful [[Free City of L\u00fcbeck]], which burnt Stralsund down in 1249. Afterwards the town was rebuilt with a massive [[town wall]] having 11 [[town gates]] and 30 watchtowers. The ''Neustadt'', a town-like suburb, had merged with Stralsund by 1361. ''Schadegard'', a nearby twin town to Stralsund also founded by Wizlaw I, though not granted German law, served as the principal stronghold and enclosed a fort. It was given up and torn down by 1269 under pressure from the Stralsund ''[[bourgeoisie|B\u00fcrger]]''.\n\nIn 1293 Stralsund became a member of the [[Hanseatic League]].<ref name=EBstral/>  A total of 300 [[Cog (ship)|ships]] flying the flag of Stralsund cruised the [[Baltic Sea]] in the 14th century. In 1325 the [[Principality of R\u00fcgen]] became part of the [[Duchy of Pomerania]], Stralsund however maintained a considerable independence.\n\nIn the 17th century opposing forces in the [[Thirty Years' War]] fought over Stralsund.

Lost to [[Electorate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] in the [[Battle of Stralsund (1678)]], it reverted to Sweden in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679)]]. In the [[Great Northern War]] in 1715 [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] led the [[Battle of Stralsund (1715)|defence of Stralsund]] for a year against the united European armies. Stralsund remained under Swedish control until the [[Battle of Stralsund (1807)]], when [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s army occupied it. Seized by [[Ferdinand von Schill]]'s [[freikorps]] in 1809, it [[Battle of Stralsund (1809)|subsequently reverted to French control]], with Schill killed in action. With the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815), Stralsund became a part of the [[Prussia]]n [[Pomerania Province (1815-1945)|Province of Pomerania]] and the seat of a [[government region]] resembling the former [[Swedish Pomerania]].\n\nFollowing the [[First World War]] Stralsund suffered the same sort of political unrest and unemployment that afflicted much of Germany. In May 1919 Stralsund workers clashed with police, and martial law was declared.{{by whom|date=July 2016}} In the early 1920s the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democratic Party]] (USPD) became the strongest party in Stralsund, but its political fortunes waned rapidly, and in September 1922 it reunited with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD).\n\nIn the national parliamentary election of May 1924, the conservative [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP) polled 8,547 votes in Stralsund, the SPD 3,534, the Communists 1,825 and the [[German People's Party]] (DVP) of Foreign Minister [[Gustav Stresemann]] 1,417. However, in keeping with national trends, [[Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Party|National Socialists]] made rapid gains in the late 1920s, and by the time of the last free national election in July 1932 the Nazis polled twice as many votes in Stralsund as the SPD.\n\nDuring the Nazi period (1933\u20131945), Stralsund's military installations expanded, and a naval training base opened on the nearby island of [[D\u00e4nholm]]. In [[World War II]] the city was subjected to repeated Allied bombing. Attacks by the U.S. Army Air Forces in 1944 killed some 800 Stralsunders and destroyed an estimated 8,000 dwellings. The [[354th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|354th Rifle Division]] of the [[Red Army]] occupied Stralsund on April 28, 1945 \u2013 10 days before the end of the war in Europe. Approximately half its population had fled.\n\nDuring the period of the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR), Stralsund saw the construction of numerous ''Plattenbau'' prefabricated apartment blocks. Its economic life centered on the now state-owned shipyard, which largely focussed on building ships for the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nAfter [[German reunification]] in 1990, the city's historic old town was thoroughly restored, and Communist-era apartment blocks were renovated and upgraded. In 2002 the old towns of Stralsund and [[Wismar]], some 120 km to the west, were listed as [[UNESCO world heritage]] sites. Stralsund's shipyard was privatized, and thereafter specialized in constructing container ships.\n\n== Culture and sights ==\n{{Infobox UNESCO World Heritage Site\n| Part_of     = Historic Centres of Stralsund and [[Wismar]]\n| Image       = Nikolaikirche Rathaus HST.jpg\n| Caption     = Stralsund: Old Market Square with the Town Hall and the Nikolaikirche\n| Criteria    = Cultural: ii, iv\n| ID          = 1067\n| Year        = 2002\n| Area        = 80 ha\n| Buffer_zone = 340 ha\n}}\n\n=== Main sights ===\n* The historic Stralsund old town island is a [[UNESCO]] [[List of World Heritage Sites in Germany|World Heritage Site]]. It features many valuable remnants of the Hanseatic time, [[Brick Gothic]], [[Renaissance architecture|renaissance]], [[Baroque architecture|baroque]], [[Revival architecture|historicist]] and [[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]] buildings.\n* The heart of the old town is the Old Market Square (''Alter Markt''), with the Gothic Town Hall (13th century). Behind the town hall soars the imposing ''Nikolaikirche'' ([[St. Nicholas' Church (Stralsund)|St. Nicholas' Church]]), built in 1270\u20131360. The square is surrounded by houses from different periods, including the Gothic ''Wulflamhaus'' (a 14th-century patrician house, today a restaurant), and the Baroque ''Commandantenhus'' of 1751, the old headquarters of the Swedish military commander.\n* The ''Jakobikirche'' (Saint James's Church), built in mid-14th century. It was destroyed several times, e.g. by [[Wallenstein]] and in [[World War II]].\n* The ''Marienkirche'' ([[St. Mary's church, Stralsund|Saint Mary's Church]]), built in 1383\u20131473 in [[Gothic style]], is the largest church in Stralsund, and from 1625\u20141647 it was the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world#History|world's tallest structure]]. Its octagonal tower (104 meters high) offers a panorama view of Stralsund and the neighboring islands of [[R\u00fcgen]] and [[Hiddensee]].\n[[File:Stralsund, Nikolaikirche, Westportal Detail (2011-02-12) 1.JPG|thumb|150px|left|Portal of the Nikolaikirche]]\n* The ''Johanniskloster'' (Franciscan monastery built in 1254), is one of the oldest buildings in the town.\n* Stralsund is the port of registry for the former German [[Reichsmarine]] Navy Sail Training ship ''[[Gorch Fock (1933)|\"Gorch Fock\" 1]]''. It is now a floating museum.\n* The ''Katharinenkloster'' (Monastery of Saint Catherine), mainly built in the 15th century, houses two museums today: Stralsund's ''Museum of Cultural History'' (known for e.g. the ''[[Hiddensee treasure|Gold Jewellery of Hiddensee]]''),<ref>[http://museum.stralsund.de/en/ Museum of Cultural History Stralsund]</ref> and the [[German Oceanographic Museum]], Germany's largest aquarium and oceanographic collection. The ancient [[refectory]] of the monastery is one of the most spectacular Gothic interiors in Germany.\n* Besides the mentioned [[German Oceanographic Museum]] at the Katharinenkloster, Stralsund has other museums dedicated to marine life, including the popular [[Ozeaneum]] that was voted ''[[European Museum of the Year Award|European Museum of the Year]]'' in 2010. There is also a nautical center, the Nautineum, on [[D\u00e4nholm]] island and the ''Marinemuseum D\u00e4nholm'', showcasing the military history of the German Navy, especially the interwar [[Reichsmarine]]. It also hosts one of the last remaining GDR [[Volksmarine]] (People's Navy) torpedo boats.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Buildings and monuments ===\n;Old Town (''Altstadt'')\nThe centre of Stralsund has a wealth of historic buildings. Since 1990, large parts of the historic old town have been renovated with private and public capital, and with the support of foundations. As a result of the contempt for historic buildings in [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]] many houses were threatened by ruin. The Old Town in particular offers a rich variety of historic buildings, with many former merchants' houses, churches, streets and squares. Of more than 800 listed buildings in Stralsund, more than 500 are designated as individual monuments in the Old Town. In twenty years, from the ''Wende'' (turning point) in 1990 to November 2010, 588 of the more than 1,000 old buildings were completely refurbished, including 363 individual monuments.<ref>''64 H\u00e4user in der Altstadt auf der Missstands-Liste'', in: [[Ostsee-Zeitung]] Stralsund dated  4 November 2010</ref> Because of its historical and architectural significance, in 2002 Stralsund's old town together with the old town of [[Wismar]] were added to entitled the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Germany|UNESCO World Cultural Heritage list]] as the \"Historic Centres of Stralsund and Wismar\".\n\n[[File:Alter Markt Stralsund.jpg|275px|thumb|Old Market Square (''Alter Markt'')]]\n;Old Market Square (''Alter Markt'')\nThe ensemble of buildings on the Old Market Square includes the St. Nicholas Church; the Town Hall (''Rathaus''), one of the most important [[secular building]]s of North German [[Brick Gothic]] architecture; the Artushof, the Wulflamhaus, the Commandantenhus, the Gewerkschaftshaus and a new apartment complex. \n;Old Town houses\nThe historic houses with their distinctive gables, often renovated at a high financial cost, dominate the scene in the streets of the Old Town. The former Swedish Government Palace is now home to the town construction department. The Museum of Cultural History Museum in ''M\u00f6nchstrasse'', in one of the most important surviving original houses of the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] era, was refurbished with funds from the [[Deutsche Stiftung Denkmalschutz|German Foundation for Monument Conservation]] It offers a guide to understanding the town's history over seven centuries.\n\n;Churches\nThree large [[medieval]] [[Brick Gothic]] buildings \u2013 [[St. Mary's Church, Stralsund|St. Mary's Church]], [[St. Nicholas' Church (Stralsund)|St. Nicholas' Church]] and St. James Church, point to the medieval significance of Stralsund. Today St. James' is used purely as a cultural venue, its parish being served now by the Church of the Holy Spirit, which also dates from the 14th century. Two other churches on the Old Market Square and the ''Neuer Markt'' are still used for church services. The tower of St. Mary's on the ''Neuer Markt'' offers a panoramic view over Stralsund and the island of R\u00fcgen. \n;Monasteries\nSt. John's Abbey, (the ''Johanniskloster''), a [[Franciscan]] monastery from 1254, now houses the Stralsund Town Archives. Regular cultural events also take place here, such as open-air theater productions.\n\nThe Gothic abbey of St. Anne and St. Bridget (''Kloster St. Annen und Brigitten'') in ''Schillstrasse'' was established around 1560 from the merger of the abbey of ''St. Anne'' (1480) and the double abbey of ''Mariakron'' (1421).\n\nThe Abbey of St. J\u00fcrgen (''Kloster St. J\u00fcrgen am Strande'') on ''M\u00f6nchstrasse'' was mentioned in 1278 for the first time. It served in the 14th century as an old people's home. In 1743 a new building, the ''Kleines St. J\u00fcrgen Kloster'', was built at ''Kniepertor'' and the site was extended in 1754 to create old people's flats and in 1841 for widow's apartments.\n\nFirst mentioned in 1256, the ''Heilgeistkloster'' is now the Hospital of the Holy Spirit.\n\n[[File:Stralsund, am Hafen (2013-07-11), by Klugschnacker in Wikipedia (39).JPG|thumb|left|200px|Old Port with [[Ozeaneum]], warehouses and historical ships including the ''[[Gorch Fock (1933)|Gorch Fock]]'']]\n;Port\nFerries to [[Hiddensee]] and [[Altef\u00e4hr]], as well as harbor tour boats, dock at the port.

Formed in 2006, they claim to be the hardest working comedy band in the UK, having played over 1000 shows throughout the UK. They are best known on the UK's festival scene, having played at major festivals including [[Glastonbury Festival]], [[Cambridge Folk Festival]], [[Beautiful Days (festival)|Beautiful Days]], [[Bearded Theory]], [[Rebellion Festival]], [[Wychwood Festival]], [[Kate Rusby]]'s Underneath The Stars Festival, [[Towersey Festival]], [[Wickham Festival]] and to an audience of 20,000 at [[Fairport's Cropredy Convention]] in August 2018, for their 900th show. Playing mainly acoustic folk instruments, they take popular songs and replace the lyrics with their own comedy reworkings, often on themes completely unrelated to the original song.  \nThey have independently released ten studio albums (containing over 110 song parodies in total), and a large number of live albums.  \nPresenting themselves as the long-lost children of Irish entertainer [[Val Doonican]], and claiming to be \"on a mission to keep their late, great spiritual father's legacy alive\", the various members of the band have adopted the singer's surname for their shows, and wear brightly coloured hand-knitted tank-tops in tribute to Doonican's traditional knitwear.<ref name=\"BOBMILLS\">{{cite news |last1=Mills |first1=Bob |title=Review \u2013 Fairport's Cropredy Convention|url=https://www.banburyguardian.co.uk/whats-on/review-fairport-s-cropredy-convention-1-8603740 |accessdate=12 October 2018 |publisher=Banbury Guardian |date=16 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Morgan |first1=David |title=Surreal comedy band to visit Knutsford |url=https://www.knutsfordguardian.co.uk/leisure/local_leisure/16220962.surreal-comedy-band-to-visit-knutsford/ |website=Knutsford Guardian |accessdate=15 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Knitted sweaters wearing Irish singer Val Doonican dies aged 88 |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/knitted-sweaters-wearing-irish-singer-9578111 |website=Wales Online |accessdate=16 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe band started out as an acoustic harmony duo consisting of Scott Doonican (vocals, acoustic guitar/banjo/mandolin/kazoo) and Danny Doonican (vocals, acoustic guitar), mainly covering quirky song choices by such disparate acts as [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Judas Priest]] and [[Vera Lynn]] on folk instruments with [[Everly Brothers]]-styled harmonies.  The band's name and subsequent image was the idea of Scott's partner and long-standing co-lyricist Amanda White, inspired after they both saw a billboard poster for a gig by the San Diego band [[Bastard Sons of Johnny Cash]], whilst on a weekend break to Dublin.<ref name=\"BIO\">{{cite web |title=Biography |url=https://www.thebarstewardsons.com/history |website=Thebarstewardsons.com |accessdate=12 October 2018}}</ref>\nThey played their first show at Thawleys Pub in Wombwell, [[Barnsley]] on Saturday 17 June 2006.<ref name=\"BIO\" /> The pub is now a local convenience store.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pub set to reopen as convenience store |url=https://www.barnsleychronicle.com/article/pub-set-to-reopen-as-convenience-store |publisher=Barnsley Chronicle |date=24 March 2015}}</ref>  After their debut show, which was originally intended to be a one-off appearance, they decided to continue, and soon expanded to a three piece with the addition of Alan Doonican #1 on piano accordion, later self-releasing two albums of folky cover versions of classic rock songs (''For Those About To Rock, Gently'') and 1980s Number Ones (''Back To The Day Job'') on their independent ''Moon-On-A-Stick Records'' label, on which they continue to release albums to this day.<ref name=\"BIO\" />\n\nFrom 2008, the original line-up began to change direction to become a comedy/parody band by replacing the lyrics of popular songs with comedic alternatives of their own and performing in their native Yorkshire accent and dialect, the first being \"Tarnlife\", a re-working of [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s \"Parklife\" with lyrics about the inhabitants of their home town of Barnsley.<ref name=\"BIO\" /> The spoken parts of the song, originally performed by Phil Daniels, were performed in 2008 by Scott\u2019s late father-in-law, Michael White, under the moniker of 'Barnsley Mick'. The band often make reference to the word 'Tarn' in their lyrics and in titles of songs and albums, which isn't a reference to mountain lakes formed by glaciation, but a local pronunciation of 'town'. As a local slang word, it is, however, given a capital letter, because it is often used as a proper noun by many local inhabitants, who affectionately call [[Barnsley]] 'Tarn'.\n\nThe song ''Tarnlife'' was later added to ''Cpl Kipper\u2019s Barnsley Trades Club Turn'', their first full album as a comedy band, released in 2010. Its cover artwork mirrored that of ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' by [[The Beatles]], with 56 Barnsley celebrities gracing its front cover.<ref>{{cite news |title=Band's album pays tribute to Kipper Jackson |url=https://www.barnsleychronicle.com/article/bands-album-pays-tribute-to-kipper-jackson |accessdate=13 November 2018 |publisher=Barnsley Chronicle |date=1 July 2010}}</ref> The album was also notable for featuring the first of the band's several collaborations with guitarist [[Graham Oliver]], founding member of heavy metal band [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Band brings in Sax solo |url=https://www.barnsleychronicle.com/article/band-brings-in-sax-solo |accessdate=13 November 2018 |publisher=Barnsley Chronicle |date=1 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nShortly after its release, Danny Doonican left the band, leaving Scott to complete the recording of 2011's ''The Dark Side Of The Tarn'' largely on his own.<ref name=\"BIO\" /> Unlike, ''Cpl. Kipper'' (which was a [[concept album]] of songs with links to their hometown of Barnsley) , from their second album onwards, the focus of the band's songwriting became more universal. \n\nDue to the significant number of line-up changes between 2010 and 2014, in 2017 Scott Doonican created a family tree for the band\u2019s website, showing the many incarnations of the band, which itself is a parody in the style of [[Pete Frame]]\u2019s Rock Family Trees. Each band member, past and present also has their own stage [[persona]] and their own individual elaborate [[backstory]].<ref name=\"BIO\" />\n\nDanny Doonican was succeeded by Andy Doonican in 2011, and the line-up of Scott, Alan #1 and Andy recorded three further albums of parody songs between 2012 and 2014 (''<nowiki>'</nowiki>EY UP! LET'S GO!'', ''Sat'day Neet Fever'' and ''Talk Of The Tarn'').<ref name=\"BIO\" />\n\nSwedish-born Bj\u00f6rn Doonicansson joined the band in April 2014, originally as a part-time member on tenor banjo, to deputise for Andy Doonican, who was becoming increasingly busy with work and family commitments. Within two months he joined as a full-time member, expanding his duties to mandolin, fiddle and bouzouki too, and the band expanded to a somewhat flexible three or four-piece line-up. \n\nAlan Doonican #1 unexpectedly left the band in September 2014, after the first night of a UK tour. \nThis prompted Scott Doonican to have to place an advert on Facebook for a new accordionist, which read, \"We are looking for someone that can play the accordion well, that is a nice bloke, with a GSOH, preferably called Alan\". The call was answered within 36 hours, by Alan Doonican #2, whom, according to the band's website in an elaborate back-story, was Alan Doonican #1's twin brother from the second of a pair of IVF petri dishes. It goes on to claim that Alan Doonican #2's petri dish had been frozen for ten years, \"whilst any underlying defects were ironed out\". \n\nSince late 2014, the core trio has been stable, with a line-up of Scott Doonican (vocals, guitar, synthesiser ukulele, banjulele, kazoo) being joined by Bj\u00f6rn Doonicansson (violin, banjo, mandolin, bouzouki, vocals) and Alan Doonican #2 (piano accordion, keyboards, keytar, ukulele, vocals). From October 2014, the core trio played most shows, however, during the ensuing two year period, Andy Doonican continued to play much more sporadic shows with the band as an expanded four-piece (on 12-string guitar and bass), until retiring in June 2016, after the band's 10th birthday show.\n\nDuring this period, the band recorded ''The Tarn Machine'' (2015) and ''T'South 0 \u2013 Tarn 4'' (2016) as a four piece,<ref name=\"04REVIEW\">{{cite web |last1=Ewart |first1=Alan |title=Barsteward Sons Of Val Doonican: T\u2019South 0 \u2013 Tarn 4 \u2013 album review |url=https://louderthanwar.com/barsteward-sons-val-doonican-album-review/ |website=Louder Than War |accessdate=13 November 2018}}</ref> while 2017's ''<nowiki>'</nowiki>Ave It : Bold As Brass'' was recorded by the current trio of Scott, Bj\u00f6rn and Alan #2.<ref name=\"BIO\" />\nThe band refer to this consecutive trio of studio albums on their website as their ''Tarnetto Trilogy'', itself a parody of the '[[Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy|Cornetto Trilogy]]', likening them to the trilogy of films created by [[Simon Pegg]], [[Nick Frost]] and [[Edgar Wright]], in which each have their own significant colours (red, blue and green) and individual characteristics, but contain common themes throughout. The cover of ''The Tarn Machine'' mirrors the blood red colour of [[Shaun Of The Dead]], the cover of ''T'South 0 - Tarn 4'' mirrors the alien green colour of [[The World's End (film)|The World's End]], and the cover of ''<nowiki>'</nowiki>Ave It : Bold As Brass'' mirrors the policeman blue colour of [[Hot Fuzz]].<ref name=\"Cornetto Trilogy\">{{cite web |title=Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy |url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/group/three_flavours_cornetto_trilogy/    |website=British Comedy Guide |accessdate=14 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2018, the band re-recorded a collection of 21 of their most-loved songs for their ninth studio album, a ten-year retrospective of their comedy years, ''The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican/2008\u20132018''. The album was independently crowdfunded and released on CD, double disc coloured vinyl and limited edition cassette.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican 2008\u20132018 |url=https://thebarstewardsons.bandcamp.com/album/the-bar-steward-sons-of-val-doonican-2008-2018-2018 |website=Bandcamp |accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2018, the band released two charity Christmas singles via iTunes. The first single was their final annual collaboration with the late [[Maartin Allcock]], who passed away four months previous, only weeks after performing with the band at [[Fairport's Cropredy Convention]]. The track, a prog-rock/traditional folk crossover rendition of [[Greg Lake]]'s ''[[I Believe In Father Christmas]]'', entered the iTunes chart,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itunescharts.net/uk/charts/songs/2018/12/19|title=iTunesCharts.net: UK Songs Wednesday, 19th December 2018|website=www.itunescharts.net}}</ref> peaking at Number 33, and gaining a Number 80 position on the UK Official Charts for both downloads and sales on 21 December 2018.<ref>{{cite web |title=ITunes charts - BSVD & Maartin Allcock |url=http://www.itunescharts.net/uk/artists/music/the-bar-steward-sons-of-val-doonican-maartin-allco/ |website=ITunes |accessdate=31 March 2019}}</ref> The second single, ''The Gasman Cometh'', entered the iTunes chart reaching Number 55,<ref>{{cite web |title=ITunes Charts positions, 19/12/2018 |url=http://www.itunescharts.net/uk/artists/music/the-bar-steward-sons-of-val-doonican/ |website=ITunes |accessdate=31 March 2019}}</ref> and the iTunes comedy chart at Number 2. In the same week ''The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican/2008\u20132018'' reached Number 2 in the iTunes comedy chart.  On 26 January 2019, spurred on by BBC Radio 6 ignoring an unprecedented barrage of fan requests for the song ''How Deep Is Your Glove?'' on social media, during a feature on Stuart Maconie's show called 'Sunday Glove Songs', the band defiantly released the track as a charity single for Prostate Cancer UK, and it entered the UK iTunes Comedy chart at Number 1.\n \nTheir tenth studio album, entitled ''Place Of Spades'' was crowdfunded in early 2019, and all pre-orders, came with a packet of 'Doonicans Magic Seeds', which at the time of their arrival at fans' homes, were of an unknown variety. In late April, fans were encouraged, on social media, to post photos of their plants, as they grew. Several months later, on 20 September, Scott Doonican finally admitted via the band's Facebook group, that they were actually [[cleome]] seeds, chosen because, when they grow, the leaves look remarkably similar to that of the [[cannabis]] plant. Scott, coming clean in his status post, stated, \"I thought it would be a proper good laugh to try and get so many people to attempt to grow them, not knowing what they were growing. It worked, as over the past six months, I have had countless private messages from slightly worried fans (one of which lives next door to their local police station!)\". The Place Of Spades album was released and launched on Sunday 30 June 2019 at [[Glastonbury Festival]] when the band played the Avalon Stage.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bar-Stewards To Play Glastonbury |url=https://www.barnsleychronicle.com/article/bar-stewards-are-playing-Glastonbury |website=Barnsley Chronicle |accessdate=11 July 2019}}</ref> A Glastonbury live album, ''Avalon Calling'' was recorded during the show, and was given a strictly limited edition CD release, which, on its announcement, sold out overnight, before being made available via digital download only.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dream Glastonbury slot for 'band with no hits' |url=https://www.barnsleychronicle.com/article/dream-glastonbury-slot-for-band-with-no-hits|website=Barnsley Chronicle |accessdate=11 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2019, Scott Doonican announced via social media and the band's website that he was setting up a crowdfunding project for a special release under the title of 'Leap of Faith'. \nFans were told that for taking a 'leap of faith' and by pledging just ten pounds, they would definitely get a CD album on time for Christmas 2019, but that this would be expanded to a second album for the same price, if enough people backed the project. By August, it was announced that then unnamed CDs would be expanded to a triple disc release containing 44-tracks. When posted out to pledgers in December 2019, it was revealed that the three albums were actually re-recorded and re-mastered versions of the 'Three Flavours Tarnetto Trilogy' (''The Tarn Machine'', ''T'South 0 - Tarn 4'', '''Ave It : Bold As Brass'') created by the 2014-present trio line-up of Scott, Bj\u00f6rn and Alan #2, and produced by Joel Howe, who had mixed and mastered The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican/2008-2018 and Place Of Spades. On its release, Scott claimed on social media that the aim of the project was to demonstrate that \"when a lot of people work collectively together, paying a little bit of money into the pot each, much bigger and better things can be achieved. I'm hoping that people can see now from my small-scale 'experiment', that socialism can work in the real world\".\n\nThe band hosted their own music and comedy festival at The Old School House Venue in Barnsley in October 2019.

It was the venue's fastest sell-out, with all tickets going within 56 seconds, before a single act was announced.

At first, the rest of the band couldn't spot him amongst the rest of the festival crowd, as everybody in attendance was in Halloween fancy dress.\n\nSince joining the band, Alan has written or co-written over ten of the band's best-known parodies, including ''The Ornithologist Waltz'', ''Walking In Manpiss'' and ''Too Good To Be Jus''.\nAlso, since Tuesday 5 July 2016, Alan has been the subject of a weekly Tuesday 'pin-up' on the band's Facebook page under the hashtag of #EyeCandyTuesday. As a result, ''Eye-Candy Tuesday'' has become something of a tongue-in-cheek hit with fans of the band, and also sported an official charity cALANder in 2018, with proceeds going to Prostate Care UK.\nHe is currently the fourth-longest serving member of the band.\n\n=== Former Members ===\n* Danny Doonican \u2013 vocals, acoustic guitar (17 June 2006 \u2013 17 March 2011)\n* Alan Doonican #1 \u2013 piano accordion (24 June 2006 \u2013 4 October 2014)\n* Andy Doonican \u2013 12-string acoustic guitar, bass guitar, ukulele (8 April 2011 \u2013 17 June 2016)\n\n===Occasional Members, Notable Guests and Collaborators===\n* Maart Doonican ([[Maartin Allcock]]) \u2013 producer and multi-instrumentalist on several studio tracks including annual Christmas singles (2015-2017).

Formed in 2006, they claim to be the hardest working comedy band in the UK, having played over 1000 shows throughout the UK. They are best known on the UK's festival scene, having played at major festivals including [[Glastonbury Festival]], [[Cambridge Folk Festival]], [[Beautiful Days (festival)|Beautiful Days]], [[Bearded Theory]], [[Rebellion Festival]], [[Wychwood Festival]], [[Kate Rusby]]'s Underneath The Stars Festival, [[Towersey Festival]], [[Wickham Festival]] and to an audience of 20,000 at [[Fairport's Cropredy Convention]] in August 2018, for their 900th show. Playing mainly acoustic folk instruments, they take popular songs and replace the lyrics with their own comedy reworkings, often on themes completely unrelated to the original song.  \nThey have independently released ten studio albums (containing over 110 song parodies in total), and a large number of live albums.  \nPresenting themselves as the long-lost children of Irish entertainer [[Val Doonican]], and claiming to be \"on a mission to keep their late, great spiritual father's legacy alive\", the various members of the band have adopted the singer's surname for their shows, and wear brightly coloured hand-knitted tank-tops in tribute to Doonican's traditional knitwear.<ref name=\"BOBMILLS\">{{cite news |last1=Mills |first1=Bob |title=Review \u2013 Fairport's Cropredy Convention|url=https://www.banburyguardian.co.uk/whats-on/review-fairport-s-cropredy-convention-1-8603740 |accessdate=12 October 2018 |publisher=Banbury Guardian |date=16 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Morgan |first1=David |title=Surreal comedy band to visit Knutsford |url=https://www.knutsfordguardian.co.uk/leisure/local_leisure/16220962.surreal-comedy-band-to-visit-knutsford/ |website=Knutsford Guardian |accessdate=15 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Knitted sweaters wearing Irish singer Val Doonican dies aged 88 |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/knitted-sweaters-wearing-irish-singer-9578111 |website=Wales Online |accessdate=16 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe band started out as an acoustic harmony duo consisting of Scott Doonican (vocals, acoustic guitar/banjo/mandolin/kazoo) and Danny Doonican (vocals, acoustic guitar), mainly covering quirky song choices by such disparate acts as [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Judas Priest]] and [[Vera Lynn]] on folk instruments with [[Everly Brothers]]-styled harmonies.  The band's name and subsequent image was the idea of Scott's partner and long-standing co-lyricist Amanda White, inspired after they both saw a billboard poster for a gig by the San Diego band [[Bastard Sons of Johnny Cash]], whilst on a weekend break to Dublin.<ref name=\"BIO\">{{cite web |title=Biography |url=https://www.thebarstewardsons.com/history |website=Thebarstewardsons.com |accessdate=12 October 2018}}</ref>\nThey played their first show at Thawleys Pub in Wombwell, [[Barnsley]] on Saturday 17 June 2006.<ref name=\"BIO\" /> The pub is now a local convenience store.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pub set to reopen as convenience store |url=https://www.barnsleychronicle.com/article/pub-set-to-reopen-as-convenience-store |publisher=Barnsley Chronicle |date=24 March 2015}}</ref>  After their debut show, which was originally intended to be a one-off appearance, they decided to continue, and soon expanded to a three piece with the addition of Alan Doonican #1 on piano accordion, later self-releasing two albums of folky cover versions of classic rock songs (''For Those About To Rock, Gently'') and 1980s Number Ones (''Back To The Day Job'') on their independent ''Moon-On-A-Stick Records'' label, on which they continue to release albums to this day.<ref name=\"BIO\" />\n\nFrom 2008, the original line-up began to change direction to become a comedy/parody band by replacing the lyrics of popular songs with comedic alternatives of their own and performing in their native Yorkshire accent and dialect, the first being \"Tarnlife\", a re-working of [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s \"Parklife\" with lyrics about the inhabitants of their home town of Barnsley.<ref name=\"BIO\" /> The spoken parts of the song, originally performed by Phil Daniels, were performed in 2008 by Scott\u2019s late father-in-law, Michael White, under the moniker of 'Barnsley Mick'. The band often make reference to the word 'Tarn' in their lyrics and in titles of songs and albums, which isn't a reference to mountain lakes formed by glaciation, but a local pronunciation of 'town'. As a local slang word, it is, however, given a capital letter, because it is often used as a proper noun by many local inhabitants, who affectionately call [[Barnsley]] 'Tarn'.\n\nThe song ''Tarnlife'' was later added to ''Cpl Kipper\u2019s Barnsley Trades Club Turn'', their first full album as a comedy band, released in 2010. Its cover artwork mirrored that of ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' by [[The Beatles]], with 56 Barnsley celebrities gracing its front cover.<ref>{{cite news |title=Band's album pays tribute to Kipper Jackson |url=https://www.barnsleychronicle.com/article/bands-album-pays-tribute-to-kipper-jackson |accessdate=13 November 2018 |publisher=Barnsley Chronicle |date=1 July 2010}}</ref> The album was also notable for featuring the first of the band's several collaborations with guitarist [[Graham Oliver]], founding member of heavy metal band [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Band brings in Sax solo |url=https://www.barnsleychronicle.com/article/band-brings-in-sax-solo |accessdate=13 November 2018 |publisher=Barnsley Chronicle |date=1 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nShortly after its release, Danny Doonican left the band, leaving Scott to complete the recording of 2011's ''The Dark Side Of The Tarn'' largely on his own.<ref name=\"BIO\" /> Unlike, ''Cpl. Kipper'' (which was a [[concept album]] of songs with links to their hometown of Barnsley) , from their second album onwards, the focus of the band's songwriting became more universal. \n\nDue to the significant number of line-up changes between 2010 and 2014, in 2017 Scott Doonican created a family tree for the band\u2019s website, showing the many incarnations of the band, which itself is a parody in the style of [[Pete Frame]]\u2019s Rock Family Trees. Each band member, past and present also has their own stage [[persona]] and their own individual elaborate [[backstory]].<ref name=\"BIO\" />\n\nDanny Doonican was succeeded by Andy Doonican in 2011, and the line-up of Scott, Alan #1 and Andy recorded three further albums of parody songs between 2012 and 2014 (''<nowiki>'</nowiki>EY UP! LET'S GO!'', ''Sat'day Neet Fever'' and ''Talk Of The Tarn'').<ref name=\"BIO\" />\n\nSwedish-born Bj\u00f6rn Doonicansson joined the band in April 2014, originally as a part-time member on tenor banjo, to deputise for Andy Doonican, who was becoming increasingly busy with work and family commitments. Within two months he joined as a full-time member, expanding his duties to mandolin, fiddle and bouzouki too, and the band expanded to a somewhat flexible three or four-piece line-up. \n\nAlan Doonican #1 unexpectedly left the band in September 2014, after the first night of a UK tour. \nThis prompted Scott Doonican to have to place an advert on Facebook for a new accordionist, which read, \"We are looking for someone that can play the accordion well, that is a nice bloke, with a GSOH, preferably called Alan\". The call was answered within 36 hours, by Alan Doonican #2, whom, according to the band's website in an elaborate back-story, was Alan Doonican #1's twin brother from the second of a pair of IVF petri dishes. It goes on to claim that Alan Doonican #2's petri dish had been frozen for ten years, \"whilst any underlying defects were ironed out\". \n\nSince late 2014, the core trio has been stable, with a line-up of Scott Doonican (vocals, guitar, synthesiser ukulele, banjulele, kazoo) being joined by Bj\u00f6rn Doonicansson (violin, banjo, mandolin, bouzouki, vocals) and Alan Doonican #2 (piano accordion, keyboards, keytar, ukulele, vocals). From October 2014, the core trio played most shows, however, during the ensuing two year period, Andy Doonican continued to play much more sporadic shows with the band as an expanded four-piece (on 12-string guitar and bass), until retiring in June 2016, after the band's 10th birthday show.\n\nDuring this period, the band recorded ''The Tarn Machine'' (2015) and ''T'South 0 \u2013 Tarn 4'' (2016) as a four piece,<ref name=\"04REVIEW\">{{cite web |last1=Ewart |first1=Alan |title=Barsteward Sons Of Val Doonican: T\u2019South 0 \u2013 Tarn 4 \u2013 album review |url=https://louderthanwar.com/barsteward-sons-val-doonican-album-review/ |website=Louder Than War |accessdate=13 November 2018}}</ref> while 2017's ''<nowiki>'</nowiki>Ave It : Bold As Brass'' was recorded by the current trio of Scott, Bj\u00f6rn and Alan #2.<ref name=\"BIO\" />\nThe band refer to this consecutive trio of studio albums on their website as their ''Tarnetto Trilogy'', itself a parody of the '[[Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy|Cornetto Trilogy]]', likening them to the trilogy of films created by [[Simon Pegg]], [[Nick Frost]] and [[Edgar Wright]], in which each have their own significant colours (red, blue and green) and individual characteristics, but contain common themes throughout. The cover of ''The Tarn Machine'' mirrors the blood red colour of [[Shaun Of The Dead]], the cover of ''T'South 0 - Tarn 4'' mirrors the alien green colour of [[The World's End (film)|The World's End]], and the cover of ''<nowiki>'</nowiki>Ave It : Bold As Brass'' mirrors the policeman blue colour of [[Hot Fuzz]].<ref name=\"Cornetto Trilogy\">{{cite web |title=Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy |url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/group/three_flavours_cornetto_trilogy/    |website=British Comedy Guide |accessdate=14 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2018, the band re-recorded a collection of 21 of their most-loved songs for their ninth studio album, a ten-year retrospective of their comedy years, ''The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican/2008\u20132018''. The album was independently crowdfunded and released on CD, double disc coloured vinyl and limited edition cassette.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican 2008\u20132018 |url=https://thebarstewardsons.bandcamp.com/album/the-bar-steward-sons-of-val-doonican-2008-2018-2018 |website=Bandcamp |accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2018, the band released two charity Christmas singles via iTunes. The first single was their final annual collaboration with the late [[Maartin Allcock]], who passed away four months previous, only weeks after performing with the band at [[Fairport's Cropredy Convention]]. The track, a prog-rock/traditional folk crossover rendition of [[Greg Lake]]'s ''[[I Believe In Father Christmas]]'', entered the iTunes chart,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itunescharts.net/uk/charts/songs/2018/12/19|title=iTunesCharts.net: UK Songs Wednesday, 19th December 2018|website=www.itunescharts.net}}</ref> peaking at Number 33, and gaining a Number 80 position on the UK Official Charts for both downloads and sales on 21 December 2018.<ref>{{cite web |title=ITunes charts - BSVD & Maartin Allcock |url=http://www.itunescharts.net/uk/artists/music/the-bar-steward-sons-of-val-doonican-maartin-allco/ |website=ITunes |accessdate=31 March 2019}}</ref> The second single, ''The Gasman Cometh'', entered the iTunes chart reaching Number 55,<ref>{{cite web |title=ITunes Charts positions, 19/12/2018 |url=http://www.itunescharts.net/uk/artists/music/the-bar-steward-sons-of-val-doonican/ |website=ITunes |accessdate=31 March 2019}}</ref> and the iTunes comedy chart at Number 2. In the same week ''The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican/2008\u20132018'' reached Number 2 in the iTunes comedy chart.  On 26 January 2019, spurred on by BBC Radio 6 ignoring an unprecedented barrage of fan requests for the song ''How Deep Is Your Glove?'' on social media, during a feature on Stuart Maconie's show called 'Sunday Glove Songs', the band defiantly released the track as a charity single for Prostate Cancer UK, and it entered the UK iTunes Comedy chart at Number 1.\n \nTheir tenth studio album, entitled ''Place Of Spades'' was crowdfunded in early 2019, and all pre-orders, came with a packet of 'Doonicans Magic Seeds', which at the time of their arrival at fans' homes, were of an unknown variety. In late April, fans were encouraged, on social media, to post photos of their plants, as they grew. Several months later, on 20 September, Scott Doonican finally admitted via the band's Facebook group, that they were actually [[cleome]] seeds, chosen because, when they grow, the leaves look remarkably similar to that of the [[cannabis]] plant. Scott, coming clean in his status post, stated, \"I thought it would be a proper good laugh to try and get so many people to attempt to grow them, not knowing what they were growing. It worked, as over the past six months, I have had countless private messages from slightly worried fans (one of which lives next door to their local police station!)\". The Place Of Spades album was released and launched on Sunday 30 June 2019 at [[Glastonbury Festival]] when the band played the Avalon Stage.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bar-Stewards To Play Glastonbury |url=https://www.barnsleychronicle.com/article/bar-stewards-are-playing-Glastonbury |website=Barnsley Chronicle |accessdate=11 July 2019}}</ref> A Glastonbury live album, ''Avalon Calling'' was recorded during the show, and was given a strictly limited edition CD release, which, on its announcement, sold out overnight, before being made available via digital download only.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dream Glastonbury slot for 'band with no hits' |url=https://www.barnsleychronicle.com/article/dream-glastonbury-slot-for-band-with-no-hits|website=Barnsley Chronicle |accessdate=11 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2019, Scott Doonican announced via social media and the band's website that he was setting up a crowdfunding project for a special release under the title of 'Leap of Faith'. \nFans were told that for taking a 'leap of faith' and by pledging just ten pounds, they would definitely get a CD album on time for Christmas 2019, but that this would be expanded to a second album for the same price, if enough people backed the project. By August, it was announced that then unnamed CDs would be expanded to a triple disc release containing 44-tracks. When posted out to pledgers in December 2019, it was revealed that the three albums were actually re-recorded and re-mastered versions of the 'Three Flavours Tarnetto Trilogy' (''The Tarn Machine'', ''T'South 0 - Tarn 4'', '''Ave It : Bold As Brass'') created by the 2014-present trio line-up of Scott, Bj\u00f6rn and Alan #2, and produced by Joel Howe, who had mixed and mastered The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican/2008-2018 and Place Of Spades. On its release, Scott claimed on social media that the aim of the project was to demonstrate that \"when a lot of people work collectively together, paying a little bit of money into the pot each, much bigger and better things can be achieved. I'm hoping that people can see now from my small-scale 'experiment', that socialism can work in the real world\".\n\nThe band hosted their own music and comedy festival at The Old School House Venue in Barnsley in October 2019. The aptly titled ''Doonifest'' sold out over a year in advance,<ref>{{cite web |title=Bar-Stewards Are Playing Glastonbury |url=https://www.barnsleychronicle.com/article/bar-stewards-are-playing-glastonbury |website=Barnsley Chronicle |accessdate=24 May 2019}}</ref> with a line-up including [[Oliver/Dawson Saxon]], Hobo Jones & The Junkyard Dogs, The Sweetchunks Band and many other comedy and musical acts from the UK's festival circuit. It was the venue's fastest sell-out, with all tickets going within 56 seconds, before a single act was announced. The festival also saw, original founding member, Danny Doonican, returning for one final show, as the original duo of Scott and Danny opened the festival with a set composed of early Doonicans cover versions and songs from the band's first album.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gig Review: Doonifest |url=http://tarkablowpigmusic.com/2019/10/gig-review-doonifest-friday-11th-and-saturday-12th-october-2019-the-old-school-house-barnsley// |website=Tarka Blowpig Music |accessdate=13 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 October 2019, the band played their 1000th show at the [[Palace Theatre, Redditch|Palace Theatre in Redditch]].

The first four of these shows were postponed until later in the year, due to a global pandemic of Coronavirus.

The station is owned by [[Tegna Inc.]] WLTX's studios are located on Garners Ferry Road ([[U.S. Route 76 in South Carolina|US 76]]\u2013[[U.S. Route 378|378]]) in southeastern Columbia, and its transmitter is located on Screaming Eagle Road (southeast of [[Interstate 20 in South Carolina|I-20]]) in rural northeast [[Richland County, South Carolina|Richland County]]. On [[cable television|cable]], the station is available on [[Spectrum (cable service)|Charter Spectrum]] channel 9 in both [[standard-definition television|standard]] and [[high-definition television|high definition]].\n\n==History==\nThe station first signed on the air on September 1, 1953 as '''[[WNOK|WNOK-TV]]''', originally broadcasting on UHF channel 67. It is the second oldest continuously operating television station in South Carolina, having signed on two months before [[WIS (TV)|WIS-TV]] (channel 10). The station has always been a CBS affiliate, but carried a secondary affiliation with the [[DuMont Television Network]] until 1955, one year before that network ceased operations. The station originally maintained studio facilities located in the Jefferson Hotel in downtown Columbia, where it was based alongside sister radio property WNOK (1230 AM, now [[WPCO]], and [[WNOK|104.7 FM]]). On June 30, 1961, the station switched channel positions, moving to UHF channel 19. In June 1967, WNOK-AM-FM-TV moved to a new studio facility on Garners Ferry Road, located {{convert|5|mi|km}} east of downtown Columbia and {{convert|1|mi|km}} from [[Interstate 77|I-77]] and the campus of the [[University of South Carolina]] School of Medicine. In 1977, the station was sold to Lewis Broadcasting and changed its call letters to '''WLTX'''.\n\nHistorically, channel 19 was well behind long-dominant WIS in the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], especially in news programming. This was partly because the station was hampered by a weak signal. Although channel 19 decently covered Columbia itself as well as [[Lexington County|Lexington]] and [[Sumter County, South Carolina|Sumter]] counties, it was practically unviewable in the outlying areas of the market. Until cable television arrived in the Columbia market in the 1970s, viewers in the outlying portions of the market had to rely on [[broadcast range|grade B]] signals from [[WRDW-TV]] in [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]] or [[WBTV]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]. However, in 1985, WLTX activated a new tall transmission tower in Lugoff that nearly doubled the station's signal and expanded its over-the-air coverage to 24 counties.\n\n[[Image:Logo WLTX .png|145px|thumb|left|WLTX's logo before 1999.]]\nIn January 1995, WLTX became a charter affiliate of the United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]); it carried the network's programming on a secondary basis during weekend afternoon timeslots when CBS had only limited sports programming (namely [[PGA Tour on CBS|PGA Tour]] golf, tennis, [[NASCAR on CBS|NASCAR]] [[auto racing]], and an expanded [[College Basketball on CBS|college basketball]] schedule). The station dropped UPN programming after [[Sumter, South Carolina|Sumter]]-licensed WQHB (channel 63, now a primary [[The CW|CW]] and secondary [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate) signed on in September 1997.\n\nIn 1998, Lewis Broadcasting sold WLTX to the [[Gannett|Gannett Company]]. Gannett invested heavily in WLTX, doubling the size of the station in 2001 and providing the staff with all new news gathering equipment. Soon after taking control, Gannett hired longtime WIS meteorologist Jim Gandy to serve as the station's chief meteorologist; however since Gandy was initially prohibited from appearing on the station's newscasts until a one-year [[non-compete clause]] in his WIS contract expired, Gannett used him as a consultant at WLTX and to serve as a substitute meteorologist at the company's other stations, including [[WXIA-TV]] in [[Atlanta]] and [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA-TV]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] In 2002, WLTX became the flagship broadcaster of the [[South Carolina Education Lottery]].\n\nIn May 2002, the station was the first commercial station in Columbia to broadcast in digital. WLTX's broadcasts became digital-only, effective June 12, 2009.<ref name=\"Analog to Digital\">http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf</ref>\n\nIn October 2012, Gannett entered a [[Carriage dispute|dispute]] against [[Dish Network]] regarding [[Retransmission consent|compensation]] fees and Dish's AutoHop commercial-skip feature on its Hopper [[digital video recorder]]s. Gannett ordered that Dish discontinue AutoHop on the account that it is affecting advertising revenues for WLTX. Gannett threatened to pull all of its stations (such as WLTX) should the skirmish continue beyond October 7 and Dish and Gannett fail to reach an agreement.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Loose|first=Ashley|title=DISH customers may lose Gannett programming, including 12 News KPNX, over AutoHop feature|url=http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/region_phoenix_metro/central_phoenix/dish-customers-may-lose-gannett-programming-including-12-news-kpnx-over-autohop-feature|accessdate=October 6, 2012|publisher=[[KNXV-TV]]|date=October 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011013154/http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/region_phoenix_metro/central_phoenix/dish-customers-may-lose-gannett-programming-including-12-news-kpnx-over-autohop-feature|archive-date=October 11, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Vuong|first=Andy|title=Gannett threatening to black out stations in its dispute with Dish|url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_21710959/gannett-threatening-black-out-stations-its-dispute-dish|accessdate=October 6, 2012|newspaper=[[Denver Post]]|date=October 6, 2012}}</ref> The two parties eventually reached an agreement after extending the deadline for a few hours.<ref>{{cite news|last=Warner|first=Melodie|title=Dish, Gannett Reach New Deal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444897304578044401930225948|accessdate=October 8, 2012|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=October 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn June 29, 2015, the Gannett Company split in two, with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and digital media.

In fact, WLTX was one of the few stations in the United States to use digital technology to broadcast all games of March Madness using all digital channels.\n\n==Programming==\nWLTX carries the entire CBS network schedule. It airs the ''[[CBS Dream Team]]'' block two hours earlier (although the third hour of the block is aired by the station on Sunday mornings) and ''[[CBS This Morning#Saturday edition|CBS This Morning Saturday]]'' two hours later on Saturday mornings than most CBS stations in the time zone. [[Broadcast syndication|Syndicated]] programs broadcast by WLTX include ''[[Inside Edition]]'', ''[[The Doctors (talk show)|The Doctors]]'', and ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]''.\n\n==News operation==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:WLTX News 19 News Title Card Oct 2015.png|225px|right|thumb|''News 19 at 4:30 a.m.'' Title Card as of Oct 2015.{{deletable image-caption|Monday, 27 June 2016}}]] -->\nWLTX presently broadcasts 30\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5\u00bd hours on weekdays, two hours on Saturdays and one hour on Sundays).\n\nFor most of its history, WLTX has been a solid, if usually distant, runner-up to WIS. Indeed, for a time in the 1980s, WLTX didn't air a newscast at 11 p.m., even after activating its new tower. However, in recent years, WLTX has taken the lead at noon due to having [[CBS Daytime]] as a lead-in, and has frequently traded the lead in the early morning timeslot with WIS.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, WLTX launched a weekly news segment titled \"News 19: Player of the Week,\" which recognized the accomplishments of high school student athletes in the classroom and in their sport. Future NBA star [[Ray Allen]] won the award several times while playing at Hillcrest High School (now Hillcrest Middle School) in [[Dalzell, South Carolina|Dalzell]]. After being acquired by Gannett, the station also debuted feature segments for its newscast such as \"On Your Side\", \"Restaurant Report Card\" and \"Big Money Monday.\"\n\nIn 2001, WLTX premiered a half-hour 7:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast. WLTX's popular morning anchor team of J.R. Berry and Darci Strickland were promoted to anchoring the evening newscasts that year. During the May 2007 ratings period, WLTX's midday newscast continued to place at #1 in the noon timeslot (traditionally having [[The Price Is Right (American game show)|the same lead-in]] since 1979), while it also won first on weekday mornings during the 5:00&nbsp;a.m. half-hour. On August 20, 2007, WLTX debuted an hour-long 5:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast titled ''News 19: Friends @ Five''; the program won a Southeast Regional [[Emmy Award]] on June 23, 2008, for its innovative approach to connecting with viewers. The station's 11:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast also won an Emmy Award for \"Best Newscast\" for the second year in a row. On June 26, 2010, the station's 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast took home an Emmy Award for \"Best Newscast.\"\n\nOn January 24, 2011, WLTX became the third television station in the Columbia market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high definition]]. In July 2013, WLTX became the second station in Columbia to expand its weekday morning newscast into the 4:30&nbsp;a.m. timeslot; later on October 5, 2013, WLTX premiered an hour-long Saturday morning newscast at 11:00&nbsp;a.m., becoming the second station in Columbia to air a morning news program on weekends (after WIS).\n\nOn January 20, 2015, WLTX was awarded the prestigious [[Alfred I. duPont\u2013Columbia University Award|Alfred I. duPont Award]] for its series of over 40 reports on the dysfunction of South Carolina's Department of Social Services.\n\n===Notable former on-air staff===\n* [[Joel Connable]] (deceased)\n* [[Ainsley Earhardt]] (now at [[Fox News|Fox News Channel]])\n* [[Natasha Curry]] (now at [[HLN (TV channel)|HLN]])\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|https://www.wltx.com/}}\n*{{TVQ|WLTX}}\n*{{BIA|WLTX|TV|TV}}\n\n{{Columbia TV}}\n{{CBS South Carolina}}\n{{Tegna}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wltx}}\n[[Category:Tegna Inc.]]\n[[Category:CBS network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Justice Network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Antenna TV affiliates]]\n[[Category:Quest (American TV network) affiliates]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1953]]\n[[Category:1953 establishments in South Carolina]]\n[[Category:Television stations in Columbia, South Carolina|LTX]]\n[[Category:Former Gannett subsidiaries]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|CBS affiliate in Columbia, South Carolina}}\n{{more citations needed|date=October 2011}}\n{{Infobox broadcast\n| call_letters             = WLTX\n| city                     = \n| station_logo             = WLTX hdtv.png\n| logo_size                = 250px\n| station_branding         = ''WLTX News 19''\n| station_slogan           = ''On Your Side''\n| digital                  = 15 ([[ultra high frequency|UHF]])\n| virtual                  = 19 ([[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]])\n| subchannels              = \n| other_chs                = \n| affiliations             = '''19.1:''' [[CBS]]<br>'''19.2:''' [[Justice Network]] ('''[[owned-and-operated station|O&O]]''')<br>'''19.3:''' [[Antenna TV]]<br>'''19.4:''' [[Quest (American TV network)|Quest]] ('''O&O''')\n| owner                    = [[Tegna Inc.]]\n| licensee                 = Pacific and Southern, [[Limited liability company|LLC]]\n| location                 = [[Columbia, South Carolina]]\n| country                  = United States\n| airdate                  = {{start date and age|1953|9|1|p=y}}\n| enddate                  = \n| callsign_meaning         = '''L'''ewis '''T'''elevision<br/>(former owner, used same callsign format for other stations, such as [[WLTZ]])\n| sister_stations          = \n| former_callsigns         = WNOK-TV (1953\u20131977)\n| former_channel_numbers   = '''Analog:'''<br>67 (UHF, 1953\u20131961)<br/>19 (UHF, 1961\u20132009)<br>'''Digital:'''<br>17 (UHF, 2000\u20132019)\n| former_affiliations      = {{ubl|''All secondary''|[[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] (1953\u20131955)|[[UPN]] (1995\u20131997)}}\n| effective_radiated_power = 700 [[kilowatt|kW]]\n| HAAT                     = {{convert|531.7|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}\n| facility_id              = 37176\n| coordinates              = {{nowrap|{{coord|34|5|50|N|80|45|50|W|type:landmark_scale:2000}}}}\n| licensing_authority      = [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]\n| homepage                 = {{url|https://www.wltx.com/}}\n}}\n\n'''WLTX''', [[virtual channel]] 19 ([[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] channel 15), is a [[CBS]]-[[network affiliate|affiliated]] [[television station]] [[city of license|licensed]] to [[Columbia, South Carolina]], United States.

Gannett invested heavily in WLTX, doubling the size of the station in 2001 and providing the staff with all new news gathering equipment. Soon after taking control, Gannett hired longtime WIS meteorologist Jim Gandy to serve as the station's chief meteorologist; however since Gandy was initially prohibited from appearing on the station's newscasts until a one-year [[non-compete clause]] in his WIS contract expired, Gannett used him as a consultant at WLTX and to serve as a substitute meteorologist at the company's other stations, including [[WXIA-TV]] in [[Atlanta]] and [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA-TV]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] In 2002, WLTX became the flagship broadcaster of the [[South Carolina Education Lottery]].\n\nIn May 2002, the station was the first commercial station in Columbia to broadcast in digital. WLTX's broadcasts became digital-only, effective June 12, 2009.<ref name=\"Analog to Digital\">http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf</ref>\n\nIn October 2012, Gannett entered a [[Carriage dispute|dispute]] against [[Dish Network]] regarding [[Retransmission consent|compensation]] fees and Dish's AutoHop commercial-skip feature on its Hopper [[digital video recorder]]s. Gannett ordered that Dish discontinue AutoHop on the account that it is affecting advertising revenues for WLTX. Gannett threatened to pull all of its stations (such as WLTX) should the skirmish continue beyond October 7 and Dish and Gannett fail to reach an agreement.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Loose|first=Ashley|title=DISH customers may lose Gannett programming, including 12 News KPNX, over AutoHop feature|url=http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/region_phoenix_metro/central_phoenix/dish-customers-may-lose-gannett-programming-including-12-news-kpnx-over-autohop-feature|accessdate=October 6, 2012|publisher=[[KNXV-TV]]|date=October 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011013154/http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/region_phoenix_metro/central_phoenix/dish-customers-may-lose-gannett-programming-including-12-news-kpnx-over-autohop-feature|archive-date=October 11, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Vuong|first=Andy|title=Gannett threatening to black out stations in its dispute with Dish|url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_21710959/gannett-threatening-black-out-stations-its-dispute-dish|accessdate=October 6, 2012|newspaper=[[Denver Post]]|date=October 6, 2012}}</ref> The two parties eventually reached an agreement after extending the deadline for a few hours.<ref>{{cite news|last=Warner|first=Melodie|title=Dish, Gannett Reach New Deal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444897304578044401930225948|accessdate=October 8, 2012|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=October 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn June 29, 2015, the Gannett Company split in two, with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and digital media. WLTX was retained by the latter company, named [[Tegna Inc.|Tegna]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Separation of Gannett into two public companies completed {{!}} TEGNA|url = http://www.tegna.com/separation-of-gannett-into-two-public-companies-completed/|publisher=Tegna|accessdate = 2015-06-29}}</ref>\n\n==Digital channels==\nThe station's digital signal is [[multiplex (TV)|multiplexed]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In fact, WLTX was one of the few stations in the United States to use digital technology to broadcast all games of March Madness using all digital channels.\n\n==Programming==\nWLTX carries the entire CBS network schedule. It airs the ''[[CBS Dream Team]]'' block two hours earlier (although the third hour of the block is aired by the station on Sunday mornings) and ''[[CBS This Morning#Saturday edition|CBS This Morning Saturday]]'' two hours later on Saturday mornings than most CBS stations in the time zone. [[Broadcast syndication|Syndicated]] programs broadcast by WLTX include ''[[Inside Edition]]'', ''[[The Doctors (talk show)|The Doctors]]'', and ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]''.\n\n==News operation==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:WLTX News 19 News Title Card Oct 2015.png|225px|right|thumb|''News 19 at 4:30 a.m.'' Title Card as of Oct 2015.{{deletable image-caption|Monday, 27 June 2016}}]] -->\nWLTX presently broadcasts 30\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5\u00bd hours on weekdays, two hours on Saturdays and one hour on Sundays).\n\nFor most of its history, WLTX has been a solid, if usually distant, runner-up to WIS. Indeed, for a time in the 1980s, WLTX didn't air a newscast at 11 p.m., even after activating its new tower. However, in recent years, WLTX has taken the lead at noon due to having [[CBS Daytime]] as a lead-in, and has frequently traded the lead in the early morning timeslot with WIS.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, WLTX launched a weekly news segment titled \"News 19: Player of the Week,\" which recognized the accomplishments of high school student athletes in the classroom and in their sport. Future NBA star [[Ray Allen]] won the award several times while playing at Hillcrest High School (now Hillcrest Middle School) in [[Dalzell, South Carolina|Dalzell]]. After being acquired by Gannett, the station also debuted feature segments for its newscast such as \"On Your Side\", \"Restaurant Report Card\" and \"Big Money Monday.\"\n\nIn 2001, WLTX premiered a half-hour 7:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast. WLTX's popular morning anchor team of J.R. Berry and Darci Strickland were promoted to anchoring the evening newscasts that year. During the May 2007 ratings period, WLTX's midday newscast continued to place at #1 in the noon timeslot (traditionally having [[The Price Is Right (American game show)|the same lead-in]] since 1979), while it also won first on weekday mornings during the 5:00&nbsp;a.m. half-hour. On August 20, 2007, WLTX debuted an hour-long 5:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast titled ''News 19: Friends @ Five''; the program won a Southeast Regional [[Emmy Award]] on June 23, 2008, for its innovative approach to connecting with viewers. The station's 11:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast also won an Emmy Award for \"Best Newscast\" for the second year in a row. On June 26, 2010, the station's 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast took home an Emmy Award for \"Best Newscast.\"\n\nOn January 24, 2011, WLTX became the third television station in the Columbia market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high definition]]. In July 2013, WLTX became the second station in Columbia to expand its weekday morning newscast into the 4:30&nbsp;a.m. timeslot; later on October 5, 2013, WLTX premiered an hour-long Saturday morning newscast at 11:00&nbsp;a.m., becoming the second station in Columbia to air a morning news program on weekends (after WIS).\n\nOn January 20, 2015, WLTX was awarded the prestigious [[Alfred I. duPont\u2013Columbia University Award|Alfred I. duPont Award]] for its series of over 40 reports on the dysfunction of South Carolina's Department of Social Services.\n\n===Notable former on-air staff===\n* [[Joel Connable]] (deceased)\n* [[Ainsley Earhardt]] (now at [[Fox News|Fox News Channel]])\n* [[Natasha Curry]] (now at [[HLN (TV channel)|HLN]])\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|https://www.wltx.com/}}\n*{{TVQ|WLTX}}\n*{{BIA|WLTX|TV|TV}}\n\n{{Columbia TV}}\n{{CBS South Carolina}}\n{{Tegna}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wltx}}\n[[Category:Tegna Inc.]]\n[[Category:CBS network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Justice Network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Antenna TV affiliates]]\n[[Category:Quest (American TV network) affiliates]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1953]]\n[[Category:1953 establishments in South Carolina]]\n[[Category:Television stations in Columbia, South Carolina|LTX]]\n[[Category:Former Gannett subsidiaries]]\n", "name_user": "Suraj Roy2", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:linked WNOK wikipedia page", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WLTX"}
