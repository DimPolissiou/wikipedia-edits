During [[17th century]] exploded into a rich industry, for exportation and local consumption, the [[French Ministry for the Economy and Finance|Royal Minister of Finances]], [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], says \"''Fashion is to France what the gold mines of Peru are to Spain...''\".<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jul/29/paris-life-luxury-getty-museum</ref> \nIn [[19th century]], fashion made a transition into specialisation for modern term ''[[haute couture]]'', originated in the 1860s, bringing ''good taste'' to fashion argot. The term ''[[pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter]]'' was born in the [[1960s]], reacting against the traditional notions of fashion and garment-making process, satisfying the needs of [[pop culture]] and [[mass media]].\n\n[[Paris]] acts as the center of the fashion industry and holds the name of ''global fashion capital''. The city is home to many prime designers, including [[Chanel]], [[Louis Vuitton]], [[Givenchy]], [[Balmain (fashion house)|Balmain]], [[Christian Louboutin|Louboutin]], [[Pierre Cardin]], [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Roger Vivier]], [[Thierry Mugler]], [[Dior]], [[Jean Paul Gaultier]], [[Herm\u00e8s]], [[Lanvin (clothing)|Lanvin]], [[Chlo\u00e9]], [[Rochas]], and [[C\u00e9line (brand)|C\u00e9line]].<ref>[http://womens-fashion.lovetoknow.com/Why_is_Paris_the_Capital_of_Fashion Why is Paris the Capital of Fashion] - LoveToKnow - Women's Fashion</ref><ref>[https://www.parisdigest.com/paris/french-fashion-paris.htm French fashion facts]- Paris Digest</ref>\n \nWith the decentralization of the fashion industry, many cities including: [[Lyon]], [[Marseille]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Toulouse]], [[Lille]] and [[Strasbourg]] have their own luxury districts and avenues. In recent times, these have become important customers and significant producers. [[\u00cele-de-France]], [[Manosque]], [[La Gacilly]] (near Rennes), and [[Vichy]] lead the [[Cosmetics|cosmetic industry]], and house  well-known international beauty houses such as [[L'Oreal]], [[Lanc\u00f4me]], [[Guerlain]], [[Clarins]], [[Yves Rocher]], [[L'Occitane]], [[Vichy cosmetics|Vichy]], etc. The cities of [[Nice]], [[Cannes]] and [[St. Tropez]] among others in the [[French riviera]] are well known as places of pleasure, annually hosting many media celebrities and personalities, potentates, and billionaires. The clothing of France is famous throughout the world.\n\n==History==\n\n=== 17th century, the ''Barroque'' and ''Classicisme''===\n[[File:Louis le Grand; Rigaud Hyacinthe.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|[[Louis XIV]], the \"Sun king\" was the [[absolute monarchy|absolute]] [[Kings of France|monarch of France]], made his kingdom the leading European power and was the fashion idol of the [[Baroque]] age.]]\n\n====Fashion prints====\nThe association of France with  181.  DeJean, chapters 2\u20134.</ref> when the luxury goods industries in France came increasingly under royal control and the French royal court became, arguably, the arbiter of taste and style in Europe.  The rise in prominence of French fashion was linked to the creation of the fashion press in the early 1670s (due in large part to [[Jean Donneau de Vis\u00e9]]), which transformed the fashion industry by marketing designs to a broad public outside the French court<ref>DeJean, pp. 35\u20136, 46\u20137, 95.</ref> and by popularizing notions such as the fashion \"season\" and changing styles.<ref>DeJean, 48.</ref> The prints were usually 14.25 X 9.5 and depicted a man or woman of quality wearing the latest fashions. They were usually shown head to toe, but with no individuality or defined facial features. Sometimes the figure would be depicted from behind in order to showcase a different side of the clothing. Although the individual in the prints was often crudely sketched, the garment itself was impeccably drawn and detailed. Accessories to the garment also received nuanced attention.<ref>Norberg & Rosenbaum p. XV; Introduction.</ref>\n\nLouis XIV, although later hailed as a patron of fashion, did not actually have a large role in its spread and proliferation\u2014which was due to the fashion prints. The fashion prints were ubiquitous, but Louis XIV neither sponsored nor hindered their production and proliferation, and largely stayed out of it unless the prints of himself specifically were treasonous, satirical, or caricatures.<ref name=\"norbergarticle\" />\n\n====Fashion in royal portraits====\nOver his lifetime, Louis commissioned numerous works of art to portray himself, among them over 300 formal portraits. The earliest portrayals of Louis already followed the pictorial conventions of the day in depicting the child king as the majestically royal incarnation of France. This idealisation of the monarch continued in later works, which avoided depictions of the effect of the smallpox that Louis contracted in 1647. In the 1660s, Louis began to be shown as a Roman emperor, the god [[Apollo]], or [[Alexander the Great]], as can be seen in many works of [[Charles Le Brun]], such as sculpture, paintings, and the decor of major monuments. The depiction of the King in this manner focused on allegorical or mythological attributes, instead of attempting to produce a true likeness. As Louis aged, so too did the manner in which he was depicted. Nonetheless, there was still a disparity between realistic representation and the demands of royal propaganda. There is no better illustration of this than in [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]]'s frequently-reproduced ''[[Portrait of Louis XIV]] of 1701'', in which a 63-year-old Louis appears to stand on a set of unnaturally young legs.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Stanis|last=Perez|date=July\u2013September 2003|title=Les rides d'Apollon: l'\u00e9volution des portraits de Louis XIV|trans-title=Apollo's Wrinkles: The Evolution of Portraits of Louis XIV|journal=Revue d'histoire moderne et contemporaine|volume=50|issue=3|pages=62\u201395|issn=0048-8003|jstor=20530984}}</ref> In 1680, Louis began to be portrayed directly rather than in a mythological setting. This began the \"fashion portraits\", which were prints that depicted the King wearing the notable fashions of the season.<ref name=\"norbergarticle\" /><ref>In Norberg's article, she references the idea that Louis XIV's portrayal in fashion portraits mirrors the use of notable fashion models of today in order to sell clothing and trends.</ref> These prints were also largely unofficial, which meant printers were unaffiliated with the Crown. They largely went unchallenged by authorities, however, as long as they portrayed the King in a positive light. Those who did portray the King satirically or with the use of caricature faced imprisonment.<ref name=\"norbergarticle\" />\n\nRigaud's portrait exemplified the height of royal portraiture in Louis's reign. Although Rigaud crafted a credible likeness of Louis, the portrait was neither meant as an exercise in realism nor to explore Louis's personal character. Certainly, Rigaud was concerned with detail and depicted the King's costume with great precision, down to his shoe buckle.<ref>See also {{cite journal|doi=10.1353/jhi.2002.0027|first=Amy M.|last=Schmitter|title=Representation and the Body of Power in French Academic Painting|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|year=2002|volume=63|issue=3|pages=399\u2013424|issn=0022-5037|jstor=3654315}}</ref> However, Rigaud's intention was to glorify the monarchy. Rigaud's original, now housed in the [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre|Louvre]], was originally meant as a gift to Louis's grandson, [[Philip V of Spain]]. However, Louis was so pleased with the work that he kept the original and commissioned a copy to be sent to his grandson. That became the first of many copies, both in full and half-length formats, to be made by Rigaud, often with the help of his assistants. The portrait also became a model for French royal and imperial portraiture down to the time of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] over a century later. In his work, Rigaud proclaims Louis's exalted royal status through his elegant stance and haughty expression, the royal regalia and throne, rich ceremonial fleur-de-lys robes, as well as the upright column in the background, which, together with the draperies, serves to frame this image of majesty.\n\n====Trends====\nLouis XIV notably introduced one of the most noticeable feature of the men's costume of the time: immense wigs of curled hair.<ref name=\"oldandsold\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oldandsold.com/articles08/costume-10.shtml|title=Dress During Louis XIV, Louis XV, Louis XVI 1643-1789|website=www.oldandsold.com}}</ref> A commonly held belief is that Louis XIV started to wear wigs due to balding, and to imitate this his courtiers put on false hair.<ref name=\"oldandsold\" /> The wearing of wigs lasted for over a century; they went through many changes, but they were never quite so exaggerated as during this period.<ref name=\"oldandsold\" />\n\nDespite the rise of ''la mode'' during Louis XIV's reign, many of the clothes he wore did not survive or were taken from the monarchy's possession. Much like the Crown Jewels, a French king did not actually own any of his clothes. They belonged to the ''Garde-robe du roi'' (King's Wardrobe), which dated back to the 16th century. Due to Louis XIV's changes to the King's Wardrobe, officers had a right to the clothes once the monarch died, as long as they would not be used by the king's successor.<ref name=\"norbergarticle\">Norberg & Rosenbaum, and various authors. (Norberg, ''Louis XIV: King of Fashion?'', p. 135-65)</ref> Furthermore, although the Louis XIV's formal clothing would change along with the rest of ''la mode'', his ceremonial clothing did not, and remained with tradition.<ref name=\"norbergarticle\" /> The king also used fashion to create a certain effect or theme. During the marriage of his great-grandson [[Louis, Duke of Burgundy]] to [[Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde of Savoy|Princess Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde]], the French entourage dressed in bright colors and fashions to contrast with the more soberly dressed Spanish. This was in order to seem younger and more virile than the Spanish courtiers.<ref name=\"norbergarticle\" />\n\n=== 18th century, the ''Rococ\u00f3'' and early New classicism ===\n\nThe extravagant styles of the French Royal court racked up enormous debts to keep up its pace, at the peasants' expense. Such fashion sprees notably ruined [[Marie Antoinette]]\u2019s reputation, and were one of the many factors paving the way for the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=\"oldandsold\" />\n[[File:Gautier-Dagoty - Marie-Antoinette, 1775.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Marie Antoinette]] the Queen of France, in extravagant 18th century French fashion.|left]]\nLong after her death, Marie Antoinette remains a major historical figure linked with [[conservative]] and the [[Catholic Church]] positions;  and a major [[cultural icon]] associated with high [[glamour (presentation)|glamour]],  [[wealth]] and a certain style of life based on luxury and [[celebrity]] appealing today to the social and [[cultural]] elites; [[Cultural depictions of Marie Antoinette|frequently referenced in popular culture]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chevroncars.com/learn/famous-people/marie-antoinette |title=Marie Antoinette Biography |publisher=Chevroncars.com |date= |accessdate=17 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926232633/http://www.chevroncars.com/learn/famous-people/marie-antoinette |archive-date=26 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> being the subject of several books, films and other forms of media.

This phrase originally appeared in Book VI of the first part (finished in 1767, published in 1782) of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s putative autobiographical work, ''[[Confessions (Rousseau)|Les Confessions]]'': \"''Enfin je me rappelai le pis-aller d'une grande princesse \u00e0 qui l'on disait que les paysans n'avaient pas de pain, et qui r\u00e9pondit: Qu'ils mangent de la brioche''\" (\"Finally I recalled the stopgap solution of a great princess who was told that the peasants had no bread, and who responded: 'Let them eat [[brioche]]{{'\"}}). Apart from the fact that Rousseau ascribes these words to an unknown princess, vaguely referred to as a \"great princess\", some think that he invented it altogether as ''Confessions'' was largely inaccurate.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnson|1990|p=17}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Sans-culottes]] (lit. \"without knee-breeches\") rejected the powdered wigs and the knee-breeches assimilated to the nobility, and instead favored informal styles (full-length trousers, and natural hair), which finally triumphed over the [[brocades]], [[lace]], [[periwig]], and powder of the earlier eighteenth century.\n\n=== 19th century, full Neoclassicism and Empire style ===\n[[File:Jacques-Louis David 014.jpg|220px|thumbnail|right|Under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] neo-classical styles reached its peak. ]]\nAfter the fall of the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] and their Sans-culottes supporters, the supporters of the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] were known as the [[Incroyables and Merveilleuses]]. They scandalized Paris with their extravagant clothes. The Merveilleuses wore dresses and tunics modeled after the ancient Greeks and Romans, cut of light or even transparent linen and gauze. Sometimes so revealing they were termed \"woven air\", many gowns displayed [[cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]] and were too tight to allow pockets. To carry even a handkerchief, the ladies had to use small bags known as reticules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austentation.com/history/reticule.html|title=Reticule|work=Austentation: Regency Accessories|accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref> They were fond of wigs, often choosing blonde because the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]] had banned blonde wigs, but they also wore them in black, blue, and green. Enormous hats, short curls like those on Roman busts, and Greek-style sandals were the most popular. The sandals were tied above the ankle with crossed ribbons or strings of pearls. Exotic and expensive scents fabricated by perfume houses like [[Parfums Lubin]] were worn as both for style and as indicators of social station. [[Th\u00e9r\u00e9sa Tallien]], known as \"Our Lady of Thermidor\", wore expensive rings on the toes of her bare feet and gold circlets on her legs.\n[[File:Th\u00e9r\u00e9sa Cabarrus.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Th\u00e9r\u00e9sa Tallien]], a leading ''Merveilleuse''|left]] \nThe Incroyables wore eccentric outfits: large earrings, green jackets, wide trousers, huge neckties, thick glasses, and hats topped by \"dog ears\", their hair falling on their ears. Their [[musk]]-based fragrances earned them too the derogatory nickname ''muscadins'' among the lower classes, already applied to a wide group of anti-Jacobins. They wore [[bicorne]] hats and carried bludgeons, which they referred to as their \"executive power.\" Hair was often shoulder-length, sometimes pulled up in the back with a comb to imitate the hairstyles of the condemned. Some sported large monocles, and they frequently affected a lisp and sometimes a stooped hunchbacked posture.\n\nIn addition to Madame Tallien, famous Merveilleuses included [[Anne Fran\u00e7oise Elizabeth Lange]], [[Jeanne Fran\u00e7oise Julie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde R\u00e9camier]], and two very popular [[Creole peoples|Cr\u00e9oles]]: Fortun\u00e9e Hamelin and [[Hortense de Beauharnais]]. Hortense, a daughter of the [[Empress Josephine]], married [[Louis Bonaparte]] and became the mother of [[Napoleon III]]. Fortun\u00e9e was not born rich, but she became famous for her [[Salon (gathering)|salons]] and her string of prominent lovers. Parisian society compared [[Germaine de Sta\u00ebl]] and Mme Raguet to [[Minerva]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and named their garments for Roman deities: gowns were styled [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]] or [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], and tunics were styled ''\u00e0 la'' [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]] or Minerva.<ref>Alfred Richard Allinson, [https://archive.org/details/daysofdirectoire00alliuoft/page/190 <!-- quote=mme raguet directoire. --> ''The Days of the Directoire''], J. Lane, (1910), p. 190</ref>\n\nThe leading Incroyable, [[Paul Fran\u00e7ois Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras]], was one of five Directors who ran the Republic of France and gave the period its name. He hosted luxurious feasts attended by [[Monarchism|royalists]], repentant [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]], ladies, and courtesans. Since divorce was now legal, sexuality was looser than in the past. However, de Barras' reputation for immorality may have been a factor in his later overthrow, a [[coup]] that brought the [[French Consulate]] to power and paved the way for [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].\n\n=== Final 19th and early 20th century, ''Belle \u00e9poque'' and ''Ann\u00e9es folles'' ===\n[[File:Chanel.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Coco Chanel]], French designer revolutionised fashion world, in the post-World War I era.]]\nFrance renewed its dominance of the high fashion ({{lang-fr|couture or haute couture}}) industry in the years 1860\u20131960 through the establishing of the great [[couturier]] houses, the fashion press (''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' was founded in 1892 in USA, and 1920 in France) and [[fashion shows]].  The first modern Parisian couturier house is generally considered the work of the Englishman [[Charles Frederick Worth]], who dominated the industry from 1858\u20131895.<ref>Kelly, 101.</ref>  In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the industry expanded through such Parisian fashion houses as the house of [[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Jacques Doucet]] (founded in 1871), Rouff (founded 1884), [[Jeanne Paquin]] (founded in 1891), the [[Callot Soeurs]] (founded 1895 and operated by four sisters), [[Paul Poiret]] (founded in 1903), [[Louise Ch\u00e9ruit]] (founded 1906), [[Madeleine Vionnet]] (founded in 1912), [[House of Patou]] by ''Jean Patou'' (founded in 1919), [[Elsa Schiaparelli]] (founded in 1927) or [[Balenciaga]] (founded by the Spaniard [[Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga]] in 1937).\n\n[[Chanel]] founded by Mademoiselle [[Coco Chanel]], it first came to prominence in 1925, its philosophy was to emphasize understated elegance through her clothing. Her popularity thrived in the 1920s, because of innovative designs. Chanel's own look itself was as different and new as her creations. Instead of the usual pale-skinned, long-haired and full-bodied women preferred at the time, Chanel had a boyish figure, short cropped hair, and tanned skin. She had a distinct type of beauty that the world came to embrace.\n\nThe horse culture and penchant for hunting so passionately pursued by the elites, especially the British, fired Chanel's imagination. Her own enthusiastic indulgence in the sporting life led to clothing designs informed by those activities. From her excursions on water with the yachting world, she appropriated the clothing associated with nautical pursuits: the horizontal striped shirt, bell-bottom pants, crewneck sweaters, and espadrille shoes\u2014all traditionally worn by sailors and fishermen.{{sfn|ref=v2011|Vaughan|2011|pp=47, 79}}\n\n=== World War II, ''Trente Glorieuses'' and ''New Look'' ===\n\nMany fashion houses closed during the occupation of Paris in [[World War II]], including the ''Maison Vionnet'' and the ''Maison Chanel''. In contrast to the stylish, liberated ''Parisienne'', the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] promoted the model of the wife and mother, the robust, athletic young woman, a figure who was much more in line with the new political criteria. Germany, meanwhile, was taking possession of over half of what France produced, including high fashion, and was considering relocating French ''haute couture'' to the cities of Berlin and [[Vienna]], neither of which had any significant tradition of fashion. The archives of the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise de la couture|Chambre Syndicale de la Couture]] were seized, mostly for their client lists as [[Jew]]s were excluded from the fashion industry at this time.\n[[File:Christian Dior Dress.jpg|190px|left|thumb|Evening dress, House of Dior, 1954. [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]].]]\nDuring this era, the number of employed models was limited to seventy-five and designers often substituted materials in order to comply with wartime shortages. From 1940 onward, no more than thirteen feet (four meters) of cloth was permitted to be used for a coat and a little over three feet (one meter) for a blouse. No belt could be over one and a half inches (four centimeters) wide.  As a result of the frugal wartime standards, the practical [[zazou]] suit became popular among young French men.\n\nIn spite of the fact that so many fashion houses closed down or moved away during the war, several new houses remained open, including [[Jacques Fath]], [[Maggy Rouff]], [[Marcel Rochas]], Jeanne Lafaurie, [[Nina Ricci (designer)|Nina Ricci]], and Madeleine Vramant. During the Occupation, the only true way for a woman to flaunt her extravagance and add color to a drab outfit was to wear a hat. In this period, hats were often made of scraps of material that would have otherwise been thrown away, sometimes incorporating butter muslin, bits of paper, and wood shavings. Among the most innovative milliners of the time were Pauline Adam, Simone Naudet, [[Rose Valois]], and Le Monnier.\n\nPost-war fashion returned to prominence through [[Christian Dior]]'s famous \"[[Christian Dior S.A.#The \"New Look\"|New Look]]\" in 1947: the collection contained dresses with tiny waists, majestic busts, and full skirts swelling out beneath small bodices, in a manner very similar to the style of the ''[[Belle \u00c9poque]]''. The extravagant use of fabric and the feminine elegance of the designs appealed greatly to a post-war clientele.   Other important houses of the period included [[Pierre Balmain]] and [[Hubert de Givenchy]] (opened in 1952). The fashion magazine ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' was founded in 1945.

It is often compared with the [[Fifth Avenue|5th Avenue]] of [[New York City]] and the ''[[Avenue Montaigne]]'', an adjacent avenue that is also known for its prestigious fashion headquarters since the 1980s.  The fashion houses have been traditionally situated since the 17th century in the quarter around the ''[[Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9]]''.

DeJean, chapters 2\u20134.</ref> when the luxury goods industries in France came increasingly under royal control and the French royal court became, arguably, the arbiter of taste and style in Europe.  The rise in prominence of French fashion was linked to the creation of the fashion press in the early 1670s (due in large part to [[Jean Donneau de Vis\u00e9]]), which transformed the fashion industry by marketing designs to a broad public outside the French court<ref>DeJean, pp. 35\u20136, 46\u20137, 95.</ref> and by popularizing notions such as the fashion \"season\" and changing styles.<ref>DeJean, 48.</ref> The prints were usually 14.25 X 9.5 and depicted a man or woman of quality wearing the latest fashions. They were usually shown head to toe, but with no individuality or defined facial features. Sometimes the figure would be depicted from behind in order to showcase a different side of the clothing. Although the individual in the prints was often crudely sketched, the garment itself was impeccably drawn and detailed. Accessories to the garment also received nuanced attention.<ref>Norberg & Rosenbaum p. XV; Introduction.</ref>\n\nLouis XIV, although later hailed as a patron of fashion, did not actually have a large role in its spread and proliferation\u2014which was due to the fashion prints. The fashion prints were ubiquitous, but Louis XIV neither sponsored nor hindered their production and proliferation, and largely stayed out of it unless the prints of himself specifically were treasonous, satirical, or caricatures.<ref name=\"norbergarticle\" />\n\n====Fashion in royal portraits====\nOver his lifetime, Louis commissioned numerous works of art to portray himself, among them over 300 formal portraits. The earliest portrayals of Louis already followed the pictorial conventions of the day in depicting the child king as the majestically royal incarnation of France. This idealisation of the monarch continued in later works, which avoided depictions of the effect of the smallpox that Louis contracted in 1647. In the 1660s, Louis began to be shown as a Roman emperor, the god [[Apollo]], or [[Alexander the Great]], as can be seen in many works of [[Charles Le Brun]], such as sculpture, paintings, and the decor of major monuments. The depiction of the King in this manner focused on allegorical or mythological attributes, instead of attempting to produce a true likeness. As Louis aged, so too did the manner in which he was depicted. Nonetheless, there was still a disparity between realistic representation and the demands of royal propaganda. There is no better illustration of this than in [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]]'s frequently-reproduced ''[[Portrait of Louis XIV]] of 1701'', in which a 63-year-old Louis appears to stand on a set of unnaturally young legs.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Stanis|last=Perez|date=July\u2013September 2003|title=Les rides d'Apollon: l'\u00e9volution des portraits de Louis XIV|trans-title=Apollo's Wrinkles: The Evolution of Portraits of Louis XIV|journal=Revue d'histoire moderne et contemporaine|volume=50|issue=3|pages=62\u201395|issn=0048-8003|jstor=20530984}}</ref> In 1680, Louis began to be portrayed directly rather than in a mythological setting. This began the \"fashion portraits\", which were prints that depicted the King wearing the notable fashions of the season.<ref name=\"norbergarticle\" /><ref>In Norberg's article, she references the idea that Louis XIV's portrayal in fashion portraits mirrors the use of notable fashion models of today in order to sell clothing and trends.</ref> These prints were also largely unofficial, which meant printers were unaffiliated with the Crown. They largely went unchallenged by authorities, however, as long as they portrayed the King in a positive light. Those who did portray the King satirically or with the use of caricature faced imprisonment.<ref name=\"norbergarticle\" />\n\nRigaud's portrait exemplified the height of royal portraiture in Louis's reign. Although Rigaud crafted a credible likeness of Louis, the portrait was neither meant as an exercise in realism nor to explore Louis's personal character. Certainly, Rigaud was concerned with detail and depicted the King's costume with great precision, down to his shoe buckle.<ref>See also {{cite journal|doi=10.1353/jhi.2002.0027|first=Amy M.|last=Schmitter|title=Representation and the Body of Power in French Academic Painting|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|year=2002|volume=63|issue=3|pages=399\u2013424|issn=0022-5037|jstor=3654315}}</ref> However, Rigaud's intention was to glorify the monarchy. Rigaud's original, now housed in the [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre|Louvre]], was originally meant as a gift to Louis's grandson, [[Philip V of Spain]]. However, Louis was so pleased with the work that he kept the original and commissioned a copy to be sent to his grandson. That became the first of many copies, both in full and half-length formats, to be made by Rigaud, often with the help of his assistants. The portrait also became a model for French royal and imperial portraiture down to the time of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] over a century later. In his work, Rigaud proclaims Louis's exalted royal status through his elegant stance and haughty expression, the royal regalia and throne, rich ceremonial fleur-de-lys robes, as well as the upright column in the background, which, together with the draperies, serves to frame this image of majesty.\n\n====Trends====\nLouis XIV notably introduced one of the most noticeable feature of the men's costume of the time: immense wigs of curled hair.<ref name=\"oldandsold\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oldandsold.com/articles08/costume-10.shtml|title=Dress During Louis XIV, Louis XV, Louis XVI 1643-1789|website=www.oldandsold.com}}</ref> A commonly held belief is that Louis XIV started to wear wigs due to balding, and to imitate this his courtiers put on false hair.<ref name=\"oldandsold\" /> The wearing of wigs lasted for over a century; they went through many changes, but they were never quite so exaggerated as during this period.<ref name=\"oldandsold\" />\n\nDespite the rise of ''la mode'' during Louis XIV's reign, many of the clothes he wore did not survive or were taken from the monarchy's possession. Much like the Crown Jewels, a French king did not actually own any of his clothes. They belonged to the ''Garde-robe du roi'' (King's Wardrobe), which dated back to the 16th century. Due to Louis XIV's changes to the King's Wardrobe, officers had a right to the clothes once the monarch died, as long as they would not be used by the king's successor.<ref name=\"norbergarticle\">Norberg & Rosenbaum, and various authors. (Norberg, ''Louis XIV: King of Fashion?'', p. 135-65)</ref> Furthermore, although the Louis XIV's formal clothing would change along with the rest of ''la mode'', his ceremonial clothing did not, and remained with tradition.<ref name=\"norbergarticle\" /> The king also used fashion to create a certain effect or theme. During the marriage of his great-grandson [[Louis, Duke of Burgundy]] to [[Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde of Savoy|Princess Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde]], the French entourage dressed in bright colors and fashions to contrast with the more soberly dressed Spanish. This was in order to seem younger and more virile than the Spanish courtiers.<ref name=\"norbergarticle\" />\n\n=== 18th century, the ''Rococ\u00f3'' and early New classicism ===\n\nThe extravagant styles of the French Royal court racked up enormous debts to keep up its pace, at the peasants' expense.

This phrase originally appeared in Book VI of the first part (finished in 1767, published in 1782) of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s putative autobiographical work, ''[[Confessions (Rousseau)|Les Confessions]]'': \"''Enfin je me rappelai le pis-aller d'une grande princesse \u00e0 qui l'on disait que les paysans n'avaient pas de pain, et qui r\u00e9pondit: Qu'ils mangent de la brioche''\" (\"Finally I recalled the stopgap solution of a great princess who was told that the peasants had no bread, and who responded: 'Let them eat [[brioche]]{{'\"}}). Apart from the fact that Rousseau ascribes these words to an unknown princess, vaguely referred to as a \"great princess\", some think that he invented it altogether as ''Confessions'' was largely inaccurate.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnson|1990|p=17}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Sans-culottes]] (lit. \"without knee-breeches\") rejected the powdered wigs and the knee-breeches assimilated to the nobility, and instead favored informal styles (full-length trousers, and natural hair), which finally triumphed over the [[brocades]], [[lace]], [[periwig]], and powder of the earlier eighteenth century.\n\n=== 19th century, full Neoclassicism and Empire style ===\n[[File:Jacques-Louis David 014.jpg|220px|thumbnail|right|Under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] neo-classical styles reached its peak. ]]\nAfter the fall of the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] and their Sans-culottes supporters, the supporters of the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] were known as the [[Incroyables and Merveilleuses]]. They scandalized Paris with their extravagant clothes. The Merveilleuses wore dresses and tunics modeled after the ancient Greeks and Romans, cut of light or even transparent linen and gauze. Sometimes so revealing they were termed \"woven air\", many gowns displayed [[cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]] and were too tight to allow pockets. To carry even a handkerchief, the ladies had to use small bags known as reticules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austentation.com/history/reticule.html|title=Reticule|work=Austentation: Regency Accessories|accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref> They were fond of wigs, often choosing blonde because the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]] had banned blonde wigs, but they also wore them in black, blue, and green. Enormous hats, short curls like those on Roman busts, and Greek-style sandals were the most popular. The sandals were tied above the ankle with crossed ribbons or strings of pearls. Exotic and expensive scents fabricated by perfume houses like [[Parfums Lubin]] were worn as both for style and as indicators of social station. [[Th\u00e9r\u00e9sa Tallien]], known as \"Our Lady of Thermidor\", wore expensive rings on the toes of her bare feet and gold circlets on her legs.\n[[File:Th\u00e9r\u00e9sa Cabarrus.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Th\u00e9r\u00e9sa Tallien]], a leading ''Merveilleuse''|left]] \nThe Incroyables wore eccentric outfits: large earrings, green jackets, wide trousers, huge neckties, thick glasses, and hats topped by \"dog ears\", their hair falling on their ears. Their [[musk]]-based fragrances earned them too the derogatory nickname ''muscadins'' among the lower classes, already applied to a wide group of anti-Jacobins. They wore [[bicorne]] hats and carried bludgeons, which they referred to as their \"executive power.\" Hair was often shoulder-length, sometimes pulled up in the back with a comb to imitate the hairstyles of the condemned. Some sported large monocles, and they frequently affected a lisp and sometimes a stooped hunchbacked posture.\n\nIn addition to Madame Tallien, famous Merveilleuses included [[Anne Fran\u00e7oise Elizabeth Lange]], [[Jeanne Fran\u00e7oise Julie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde R\u00e9camier]], and two very popular [[Creole peoples|Cr\u00e9oles]]: Fortun\u00e9e Hamelin and [[Hortense de Beauharnais]]. Hortense, a daughter of the [[Empress Josephine]], married [[Louis Bonaparte]] and became the mother of [[Napoleon III]]. Fortun\u00e9e was not born rich, but she became famous for her [[Salon (gathering)|salons]] and her string of prominent lovers. Parisian society compared [[Germaine de Sta\u00ebl]] and Mme Raguet to [[Minerva]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and named their garments for Roman deities: gowns were styled [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]] or [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], and tunics were styled ''\u00e0 la'' [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]] or Minerva.<ref>Alfred Richard Allinson, [https://archive.org/details/daysofdirectoire00alliuoft/page/190 <!-- quote=mme raguet directoire. --> ''The Days of the Directoire''], J.

He hosted luxurious feasts attended by [[Monarchism|royalists]], repentant [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]], ladies, and courtesans. Since divorce was now legal, sexuality was looser than in the past. However, de Barras' reputation for immorality may have been a factor in his later overthrow, a [[coup]] that brought the [[French Consulate]] to power and paved the way for [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].\n\n=== Final 19th and early 20th century, ''Belle \u00e9poque'' and ''Ann\u00e9es folles'' ===\n[[File:Chanel.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Coco Chanel]], French designer revolutionised fashion world, in the post-World War I era.]]\nFrance renewed its dominance of the high fashion ({{lang-fr|couture or haute couture}}) industry in the years 1860\u20131960 through the establishing of the great [[couturier]] houses, the fashion press (''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' was founded in 1892 in USA, and 1920 in France) and [[fashion shows]].  The first modern Parisian couturier house is generally considered the work of the Englishman [[Charles Frederick Worth]], who dominated the industry from 1858\u20131895.<ref>Kelly, 101.</ref>  In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the industry expanded through such Parisian fashion houses as the house of [[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Jacques Doucet]] (founded in 1871), Rouff (founded 1884), [[Jeanne Paquin]] (founded in 1891), the [[Callot Soeurs]] (founded 1895 and operated by four sisters), [[Paul Poiret]] (founded in 1903), [[Louise Ch\u00e9ruit]] (founded 1906), [[Madeleine Vionnet]] (founded in 1912), [[House of Patou]] by ''Jean Patou'' (founded in 1919), [[Elsa Schiaparelli]] (founded in 1927) or [[Balenciaga]] (founded by the Spaniard [[Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga]] in 1937).\n\n[[Chanel]] founded by Mademoiselle [[Coco Chanel]], it first came to prominence in 1925, its philosophy was to emphasize understated elegance through her clothing. Her popularity thrived in the 1920s, because of innovative designs. Chanel's own look itself was as different and new as her creations. Instead of the usual pale-skinned, long-haired and full-bodied women preferred at the time, Chanel had a boyish figure, short cropped hair, and tanned skin. She had a distinct type of beauty that the world came to embrace.\n\nThe horse culture and penchant for hunting so passionately pursued by the elites, especially the British, fired Chanel's imagination. Her own enthusiastic indulgence in the sporting life led to clothing designs informed by those activities. From her excursions on water with the yachting world, she appropriated the clothing associated with nautical pursuits: the horizontal striped shirt, bell-bottom pants, crewneck sweaters, and espadrille shoes\u2014all traditionally worn by sailors and fishermen.{{sfn|ref=v2011|Vaughan|2011|pp=47, 79}}\n\n=== World War II, ''Trente Glorieuses'' and ''New Look'' ===\n\nMany fashion houses closed during the occupation of Paris in [[World War II]], including the ''Maison Vionnet'' and the ''Maison Chanel''. In contrast to the stylish, liberated ''Parisienne'', the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] promoted the model of the wife and mother, the robust, athletic young woman, a figure who was much more in line with the new political criteria. Germany, meanwhile, was taking possession of over half of what France produced, including high fashion, and was considering relocating French ''haute couture'' to the cities of Berlin and [[Vienna]], neither of which had any significant tradition of fashion. The archives of the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise de la couture|Chambre Syndicale de la Couture]] were seized, mostly for their client lists as [[Jew]]s were excluded from the fashion industry at this time.\n[[File:Christian Dior Dress.jpg|190px|left|thumb|Evening dress, House of Dior, 1954. [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]].]]\nDuring this era, the number of employed models was limited to seventy-five and designers often substituted materials in order to comply with wartime shortages. From 1940 onward, no more than thirteen feet (four meters) of cloth was permitted to be used for a coat and a little over three feet (one meter) for a blouse. No belt could be over one and a half inches (four centimeters) wide.  As a result of the frugal wartime standards, the practical [[zazou]] suit became popular among young French men.\n\nIn spite of the fact that so many fashion houses closed down or moved away during the war, several new houses remained open, including [[Jacques Fath]], [[Maggy Rouff]], [[Marcel Rochas]], Jeanne Lafaurie, [[Nina Ricci (designer)|Nina Ricci]], and Madeleine Vramant. During the Occupation, the only true way for a woman to flaunt her extravagance and add color to a drab outfit was to wear a hat. In this period, hats were often made of scraps of material that would have otherwise been thrown away, sometimes incorporating butter muslin, bits of paper, and wood shavings. Among the most innovative milliners of the time were Pauline Adam, Simone Naudet, [[Rose Valois]], and Le Monnier.\n\nPost-war fashion returned to prominence through [[Christian Dior]]'s famous \"[[Christian Dior S.A.#The \"New Look\"|New Look]]\" in 1947: the collection contained dresses with tiny waists, majestic busts, and full skirts swelling out beneath small bodices, in a manner very similar to the style of the ''[[Belle \u00c9poque]]''. The extravagant use of fabric and the feminine elegance of the designs appealed greatly to a post-war clientele.   Other important houses of the period included [[Pierre Balmain]] and [[Hubert de Givenchy]] (opened in 1952). The fashion magazine ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' was founded in 1945.

the overthrow of [[King Zahir Shah]] by his distant cousin [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] in a bloodless [[1973 Afghan coup d'\u00e9tat]]. Daoud Khan had served as prime minister since 1953 and promoted economic modernization, [[emancipation]] of women, and [[Pashtun nationalism]]. This was threatening to neighboring Pakistan, faced with its own restive [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] population. In the mid-1970s, Pakistani Prime Minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] began to encourage Afghan [[Islamist]] leaders such as [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] and [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] to fight against the regime. In 1978, Daoud Khan was killed in [[Saur Revolution|a coup by Afghan's Communist Party]], his former partner in government, known as the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.afghanland.com/history/biography/daoud.html|title=Mohammad Daud Khan|date=2000|website=Afghanland.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817040633/http://www.afghanland.com/history/biography/daoud.html|archive-date=17 August 2017|url-status=|access-date=11 March 2018}}</ref> The PDPA pushed for a socialist transformation by abolishing arranged marriages, promoting mass literacy and reforming land ownership. This undermined the traditional tribal order and provoked opposition across rural areas. The PDPA's crackdown was met with open rebellion, including [[Ismail Khan]]'s [[1979 Herat Uprising|Herat Uprising]]. The PDPA was beset by internal leadership differences and was weakened by an internal coup on 11 September 1979 when [[Hafizullah Amin]] ousted [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]]. The [[Soviet Union]], sensing PDPA weakness, [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|intervened militarily three months later]], [[Operation Storm-333|to depose Amin]] and install [[Parcham|another PDA faction]] led by [[Babrak Karmal]].\n\nThe entry of Soviet forces in Afghanistan in December 1979 prompted its [[Cold War]] rivals, the United States, Pakistan, [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[China]] to support rebels fighting against the Soviet-backed [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]]. In contrast to the secular and socialist government, which controlled the cities, religiously motivated [[mujahideen]] held sway in much of the countryside. Besides Rabbani, Hekmatyar, and Khan, other mujahideen commanders included [[Jalaluddin Haqqani]]. The [[CIA]] worked closely with Pakistan's [[Inter-Service Intelligence]] to funnel foreign support for the mujahideen. The war also attracted Arab volunteers, known as \"[[Afghan Arabs]]\", including [[Osama bin Laden]].\n\nAfter the [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|withdrawal of the Soviet military from Afghanistan]] in May 1989, the PDPA regime under [[Mohammad Najibullah|Najibullah]] held on until 1992, when the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] deprived the regime of aid, and the defection of Uzbek general [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] cleared the approach to [[Kabul]]. With the political stage cleared of socialists, the warlords, some of them Islamist, vied for power. By then, Bin Laden had left the country and the United States' interest in Afghanistan also diminished.\n\n===Warlord rule (1992\u20131996)===\n{{Main|Afghan Civil War (1992\u201396)}}\n[[File:Massoud and Qadir 2.PNG|thumb|[[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] (right) with Pashtun anti-Taliban leader and later Vice-President of the [[Islamic Republic of Afghanistan]] [[Haji Abdul Qadir]]]]\n\nIn 1992, Rabbani officially became president of the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]], but had to battle other warlords for control of Kabul.

He had founded Al-Qaeda in the late 1980s to support the Mujahideen's war against the Soviets but became disillusioned by infighting among warlords. He grew close to Mullah Omar and moved Al-Qaeda's operations to eastern Afghanistan.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe [[9/11 Commission]] in the US found that under the Taliban, al-Qaeda was able to use Afghanistan as a place to train and indoctrinate fighters, import weapons, coordinate with other [[jihadist]]s, and plot terrorist actions.{{sfn|911 Commission|2004|p=66}} While al-Qaeda maintained its own [[Afghan training camp|camps in Afghanistan]], it also supported training camps of other organizations. An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 men passed through these facilities before 9/11, most of whom were sent to fight for the Taliban against the United Front. A smaller number were inducted into al-Qaeda.{{sfn|911 Commission|2004|p=67}}\n\nAfter the August [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] were linked to bin Laden, President [[Bill Clinton]] ordered [[Operation Infinite Reach|missile strikes on militant training camps]] in Afghanistan. US officials pressed the Taliban to surrender bin Laden. In 1999, the international community imposed sanctions on the Taliban, calling for bin Laden to be surrendered. The Taliban repeatedly rebuffed these demands.\n\n[[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) [[Special Activities Division]] paramilitary teams were active in Afghanistan in the 1990s in clandestine operations to locate and kill or capture Osama bin Laden. These teams planned several operations but did not receive the order to proceed from President Clinton. Their efforts built relationships with Afghan leaders that proved essential in the 2001 invasion.{{sfn|Coll|2004}}\n\n====Change in US policy toward Afghanistan====\nDuring the [[Clinton administration]], the US tended to favor Pakistan and until 1998\u20131999 had no clear policy toward Afghanistan. In 1997, for example, the US State Department's [[Robin Raphel]] told Massoud to surrender to the Taliban. Massoud responded that, as long as he controlled an area the size of his hat, he would continue to defend it from the Taliban.<ref name=\"Webster University Press Book\" /> Around the same time, top foreign policy officials in the Clinton administration flew to northern Afghanistan to try to persuade the United Front not to take advantage of a chance to make crucial gains against the Taliban. They insisted it was the time for a cease-fire and an [[arms embargo]].

The report emphasizes the rise of \"complex attacks\", a type of suicide assault that is becoming more deadly, described by the New York Times as the hallmark of the war in 2018. These attacks are referred to as the Taliban's ferocious response to US President Trump's new strategy of war (an increased pace of aerial bombardments targeting Taliban and Islamic State Militants), giving the message that the Taliban can strike at will, even in the capital city, Kabul. The U.N. report included a statement showing the Taliban's position, the Taliban blamed the U.S and its allies for fighting the war in Afghanistan, and it denied targeting civilians. The New York Times quoted Atiqullah Amarkhel, a retired general and military analyst based in Kabul, saying that the UN report proved the failure of peace talks, as the Taliban and the US government are both determined for victory rather than negotiating a settlement. He said \"More airstrikes mean more suicide attacks,\" proving the intensification of the war by 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/world/asia/afghanistan-civilian-casualties.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FAfghanistan&action=click&contentCollection=world&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection|title=More Afghan Civilians Being Deliberately Targeted, U.N.

began to break down with the overthrow of [[King Zahir Shah]] by his distant cousin [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] in a bloodless [[1973 Afghan coup d'\u00e9tat]]. Daoud Khan had served as prime minister since 1953 and promoted economic modernization, [[emancipation]] of women, and [[Pashtun nationalism]]. This was threatening to neighboring Pakistan, faced with its own restive [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] population. In the mid-1970s, Pakistani Prime Minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] began to encourage Afghan [[Islamist]] leaders such as [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] and [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] to fight against the regime. In 1978, Daoud Khan was killed in [[Saur Revolution|a coup by Afghan's Communist Party]], his former partner in government, known as the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.afghanland.com/history/biography/daoud.html|title=Mohammad Daud Khan|date=2000|website=Afghanland.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817040633/http://www.afghanland.com/history/biography/daoud.html|archive-date=2017-08-17|url-status=|access-date=2018-03-11}}</ref> The PDPA pushed for a socialist transformation by abolishing arranged marriages, promoting mass literacy and reforming land ownership. This undermined the traditional tribal order and provoked opposition across rural areas. The PDPA's crackdown was met with open rebellion, including [[Ismail Khan]]'s [[1979 Herat Uprising|Herat Uprising]]. The PDPA was beset by internal leadership differences and was weakened by an internal coup on 11 September 1979 when [[Hafizullah Amin]] ousted [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]]. The [[Soviet Union]], sensing PDPA weakness, [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|intervened militarily three months later]], [[Operation Storm-333|to depose Amin]] and install [[Parcham|another PDA faction]] led by [[Babrak Karmal]].\n\nThe entry of Soviet forces in Afghanistan in December 1979 prompted its [[Cold War]] rivals, the United States, Pakistan, [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[China]] to support rebels fighting against the Soviet-backed [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]]. In contrast to the secular and socialist government, which controlled the cities, religiously motivated [[mujahideen]] held sway in much of the countryside. Besides Rabbani, Hekmatyar, and Khan, other mujahideen commanders included [[Jalaluddin Haqqani]]. The [[CIA]] worked closely with Pakistan's [[Inter-Service Intelligence]] to funnel foreign support for the mujahideen. The war also attracted Arab volunteers, known as \"[[Afghan Arabs]]\", including [[Osama bin Laden]].\n\nAfter the [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|withdrawal of the Soviet military from Afghanistan]] in May 1989, the PDPA regime under [[Mohammad Najibullah|Najibullah]] held on until 1992, when the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] deprived the regime of aid, and the defection of Uzbek general [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] cleared the approach to [[Kabul]]. With the political stage cleared of socialists, the warlords, some of them Islamist, vied for power. By then, Bin Laden had left the country and the United States' interest in Afghanistan also diminished.\n\n===Warlord rule (1992\u20131996)===\n{{Main|Afghan Civil War (1992\u201396)}}\n[[File:Massoud and Qadir 2.PNG|thumb|[[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] (right) with Pashtun anti-Taliban leader and later Vice-President of the [[Islamic Republic of Afghanistan]] [[Haji Abdul Qadir]]]]\n\nIn 1992, Rabbani officially became president of the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]], but had to battle other warlords for control of Kabul.

He had founded Al-Qaeda in the late 1980s to support the Mujahideen's war against the Soviets but became disillusioned by infighting among warlords. He grew close to Mullah Omar and moved Al-Qaeda's operations to eastern Afghanistan.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe [[9/11 Commission]] in the US found that under the Taliban, al-Qaeda was able to use Afghanistan as a place to train and indoctrinate fighters, import weapons, coordinate with other [[jihadist]]s, and plot terrorist actions.{{sfn|911 Commission|2004|p=66}} While al-Qaeda maintained its own [[Afghan training camp|camps in Afghanistan]], it also supported training camps of other organizations. An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 men passed through these facilities before 9/11, most of whom were sent to fight for the Taliban against the United Front. A smaller number were inducted into al-Qaeda.{{sfn|911 Commission|2004|p=67}}\n\nAfter the August [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] were linked to bin Laden, President [[Bill Clinton]] ordered [[Operation Infinite Reach|missile strikes on militant training camps]] in Afghanistan. US officials pressed the Taliban to surrender bin Laden. In 1999, the international community imposed sanctions on the Taliban, calling for bin Laden to be surrendered. The Taliban repeatedly rebuffed these demands.\n\n[[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) [[Special Activities Division]] paramilitary teams were active in Afghanistan in the 1990s in clandestine operations to locate and kill or capture Osama bin Laden. These teams planned several operations but did not receive the order to proceed from President Clinton. Their efforts built relationships with Afghan leaders that proved essential in the 2001 invasion.{{sfn|Coll|2004}}\n\n====Change in US policy toward Afghanistan====\nDuring the [[Clinton administration]], the US tended to favor Pakistan and until 1998\u20131999 had no clear policy toward Afghanistan. In 1997, for example, the US State Department's [[Robin Raphel]] told Massoud to surrender to the Taliban. Massoud responded that, as long as he controlled an area the size of his hat, he would continue to defend it from the Taliban.<ref name=\"Webster University Press Book\" /> Around the same time, top foreign policy officials in the Clinton administration flew to northern Afghanistan to try to persuade the United Front not to take advantage of a chance to make crucial gains against the Taliban. They insisted it was the time for a cease-fire and an [[arms embargo]].

The report emphasizes the rise of \"complex attacks\", a type of suicide assault that is becoming more deadly, described by the New York Times as the hallmark of the war in 2018. These attacks are referred to as the Taliban's ferocious response to US President Trump's new strategy of war (an increased pace of aerial bombardments targeting Taliban and Islamic State Militants), giving the message that the Taliban can strike at will, even in the capital city, Kabul. The U.N. report included a statement showing the Taliban's position, the Taliban blamed the U.S and its allies for fighting the war in Afghanistan, and it denied targeting civilians. The New York Times quoted Atiqullah Amarkhel, a retired general and military analyst based in Kabul, saying that the UN report proved the failure of peace talks, as the Taliban and the US government are both determined for victory rather than negotiating a settlement. He said \"More airstrikes mean more suicide attacks,\" proving the intensification of the war by 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/world/asia/afghanistan-civilian-casualties.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FAfghanistan&action=click&contentCollection=world&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection|title=More Afghan Civilians Being Deliberately Targeted, U.N.

The decision, she said, was her own. Although her years of experience in making music videos was to her advantage, Lavigne admitted her experience in singing removed any fear of performing on camera. She specifically mentioned that the video \"Nobody's Home\" involved the most \"acting\".{{r|girlauinterview}} Her first television appearance was in a 2002 episode of ''[[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'',{{r|sabrinateenagewitch}} performing \"Sk8er Boi\"{{r|mtvsabrinanov}} with her band in a nightclub.{{r|mtvsabrinaaug}} She later made a cameo appearance in the 2004 film ''[[Going the Distance (2004 film)|Going the Distance]]''. The main characters bump into her backstage at the [[MuchMusic Video Awards]]{{r|canoedistance}} after her performance of \"Losing Grip\".{{r|goingthedistance}}\n\nShe moved into feature film acting cautiously, choosing deliberately small roles to begin with. In November 2005, after going through an audition to land the role, Lavigne travelled to [[New Mexico]]{{r|mtvflock}} to film a single scene in the 2007 film, ''[[The Flock (film)|The Flock]]''.{{r|digitalspyflock}} She played Beatrice Bell, the girlfriend of a crime suspect, appearing alongside [[Claire Danes]] and [[Richard Gere]]. Gere gave Lavigne acting tips between takes.{{r|digitalspyflock}} On her role in ''The Flock'', Lavigne said, \"I did that just to see how it was and to not jump into [mainstream acting] too fast\".{{r|girlauinterview}} ''The Flock'' was not released in American theatres, and because it was not released in foreign markets until late 2007, it is not considered Lavigne's debut. The film made $7&nbsp;million in the foreign box office.{{r|mojoflock}}\n\n[[File:Avrilgfdl.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Lavigne at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]]]]\nLavigne's feature film debut was voicing an animated character in the 2006 film ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]'', based on the [[Over the Hedge|comic strip of the same name]]. She voiced the character Heather, a [[Virginia opossum]]. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, \"All the actors went in individually, and [director] [[Tim Johnson (film director)|Tim]] and [screenwriter [[Karey Kirkpatrick|Karey]]] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with no one else to kind of feed off of.\"{{r|cctvhedge}} Lavigne found the recording process to be \"easy\" and \"natural\", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. \"I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still.\" Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. \"[The director] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude\".{{r|girlauinterview}} The film opened on May 19, 2006, making $38&nbsp;million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336&nbsp;million worldwide.{{r|mojohedge}}\n\nIn December 2005, Lavigne signed to appear in ''[[Fast Food Nation (film)|Fast Food Nation]]'', based on the book ''[[Fast Food Nation]]: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal''.{{r|contactmusicfastfood}} The fictionalized adaptation, directed by [[Richard Linklater]], traces fast-food hamburgers contaminated with cow feces back to the slaughterhouses.{{r|washingtonpostfastfood}} Lavigne played Alice, a high school student intent on freeing the cows.{{r|msnbcfastfood}}{{r|nytimesfastfood}} The film opened on November 17, 2006 and remained in theatres for 11 weeks, grossing $2&nbsp;million worldwide.{{r|mojofastfood}}\n\nBoth ''Over the Hedge'' and ''Fast Food Nation'' opened at the 2006 [[Cannes Film Festival]], which Lavigne attended. Lavigne felt honoured to be able to attend and was proud of her work. When asked if she would pursue her film career, she stated that she wanted to take her time and wait for the \"right parts and the right movies.\" Lavigne was aware of the roles she had chosen. \"I wanted to start off small and to learn. I wouldn't just want to throw myself into a big part.\"{{r|girlauinterview}} In August 2006, ''[[Canadian Business]]'' magazine ranked her as the seventh top Canadian actor in Hollywood in their second-annual ranking Celebrity Power List. The results were determined by comparing salary, Internet hits, TV mentions, and press hits.{{r|canadianbusiness}}\n\n==Fashion==\nIn July 2008, Lavigne launched the clothing line ''[[Abbey Dawn]]'', featuring a back-to-school collection. It is produced by [[Kohl's]], which is the brand's exclusive US retailer. Named after Lavigne's childhood nickname, Abbey Dawn is designed by Lavigne herself.{{r|warechok|venaabbey}} Kohl's describes Abbey Dawn as a \"juniors lifestyle brand\",{{r|kohls}} which incorporates skull, zebra, and star patterns, purples and \"hot pinks and blacks\". Lavigne, who wore some of the clothes and jewellery from her line at various concerts before its official launch, pointed out that she was not merely licensing her name to the collection. \"I actually am the designer. What's really important to me is that everything fits well and is well-made, so I try everything on and approve it all.\"{{r|usatodaybarker}} The clothing line incorporates Lavigne's musical style and lyrics, \"after the release of my first album, I realized how much fashion was involved in my musical career\".{{r|abbeyhuffington}}\n\nThe designs were also featured on the Internet game ''[[Stardoll]]'', where figures can be dressed up as Lavigne.{{r|nprmouse}} On September 14, 2009, Lavigne took her then latest collection for her clothing line to be a part of the [[New York Fashion Week]],{{r|newyorkabbey}} returning in 2011.{{r|abbeyhuffington}} In December 2010, the clothing line was made available to over 50 countries through the line's official website.{{r|artistdirectrelease|popeater}} \"It's fun to be a chick and design clothes and things I'd like for myself.

The fragrance was announced on Lavigne's official website on March 7, 2009. Black Star, which features notes of pink hibiscus, black plum and dark chocolate, was released in summer 2009 in Europe, and later in the US and Canada.{{r|basenotes}} When asked what the name meant, Lavigne replied, \"I wanted [the bottle] to be a star, and my colors are pink and black, and Black Star resembles being different, and standing out in the crowd, and reaching for the stars; the whole message is just about following your dreams, and it's okay to be unique and be who you are.\"{{r|seacrestinterview6may}} Black Star won the 2010 Best \"Women's Scent Mass\" by Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW).{{r|cewblackstar}} Black Star was followed by a second fragrance in July 2010, ''[[Forbidden Rose]]'', which took two years to develop.{{r|2dayfm}} It features notes of red apple, winepeach, black pepper, lotusflower, heliotrope, shellflower, praline agreement, sandalwood, and vanilla.{{r|independentrose}} Its message is an extension of Black Star's \"follow your dreams\",{{r|perfumeblog}} though the tagline for the new perfume is \"Dare to Discover\".{{r|rosecommercial}} The commercial takes place in a [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] garden setting,{{r|perfumeblog}} where Lavigne, upon entering the garden, finds a single, purple rose.{{r|rosecommercial}} Lavigne launched a third fragrance, Wild Rose, in August 2011 and filmed the commercial for it in late 2010.{{r|popeater}} The tagline for the fragrance is \"Dare to discover more\".{{r|perfumediary}} It features notes of mandarin, pink grapefruit, plum, orange blossom, frangipani, blue orchid, musk, sandalwood and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.{{r|fragrantica}}\n\nIn January 2010, Lavigne began working with Disney to incorporate ''Alice in Wonderland''-inspired designs into her Abbey Dawn line of clothing.{{r|seacrestinterview26}} Her designs were exhibited at the [[Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising]] in California beginning in May through September, alongside [[Colleen Atwood]]'s costumes from the 2010 film.{{r|ladowntownalice}}\n\n==Artistry==\n\n===Musical style and songwriting===\nLavigne possesses a [[light-lyric soprano]] vocal range.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://riverbeats.life/glitter-gold-keshas-new-sound-best-yet/|title=From Glitter to Gold: Why Kesha\u2019s New Sound is Her Best Yet|first=River|last=Beats|date=August 18, 2017|accessdate=October 17, 2018|work=River Beats|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181018082740/https://riverbeats.life/glitter-gold-keshas-new-sound-best-yet/|archive-date=October 18, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Themes in her music include messages of self-empowerment from a female or an adolescent view.{{r|blossoming}} Lavigne believes her \"songs are about being yourself no matter what and going after your dreams even if your dreams are crazy and even if people tell you they're never going to come true.\"{{r|girlauinterview}} On her debut album, ''Let Go'', Lavigne preferred the less mainstream songs, such as \"[[Losing Grip]]\", instead of her more radio-friendly singles, such as \"[[Complicated (Avril Lavigne song)|Complicated]]\", saying that \"the songs I did with [[The Matrix (production team)|the Matrix]]&nbsp;... were good for my first record, but I don't want to be that pop anymore.\"{{r|teenspirit}} Lavigne's second album, ''Under My Skin'', had deeper personal themes underlying each song, saying that \"I've gone through so much, so that's what I talk about&nbsp;...

The decision, she said, was her own. Although her years of experience in making music videos was to her advantage, Lavigne admitted her experience in singing removed any fear of performing on camera. She specifically mentioned that the video \"Nobody's Home\" involved the most \"acting\".{{r|girlauinterview}} Her first television appearance was in a 2002 episode of ''[[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'',{{r|sabrinateenagewitch}} performing \"Sk8er Boi\"{{r|mtvsabrinanov}} with her band in a nightclub.{{r|mtvsabrinaaug}} She later made a cameo appearance in the 2004 film ''[[Going the Distance (2004 film)|Going the Distance]]''. The main characters bump into her backstage at the [[MuchMusic Video Awards]]{{r|canoedistance}} after her performance of \"Losing Grip\".{{r|goingthedistance}}\n\nShe moved into feature film acting cautiously, choosing deliberately small roles to begin with. In November 2005, after going through an audition to land the role, Lavigne travelled to [[New Mexico]]{{r|mtvflock}} to film a single scene in the 2007 film, ''[[The Flock (film)|The Flock]]''.{{r|digitalspyflock}} She played Beatrice Bell, the girlfriend of a crime suspect, appearing alongside [[Claire Danes]] and [[Richard Gere]]. Gere gave Lavigne acting tips between takes.{{r|digitalspyflock}} On her role in ''The Flock'', Lavigne said, \"I did that just to see how it was and to not jump into [mainstream acting] too fast\".{{r|girlauinterview}} ''The Flock'' was not released in American theatres, and because it was not released in foreign markets until late 2007, it is not considered Lavigne's debut. The film made $7&nbsp;million in the foreign box office.{{r|mojoflock}}\n\n[[File:Avrilgfdl.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Lavigne at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]]]]\nLavigne's feature film debut was voicing an animated character in the 2006 film ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]'', based on the [[Over the Hedge|comic strip of the same name]]. She voiced the character Heather, a [[Virginia opossum]]. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, \"All the actors went in individually, and [director] [[Tim Johnson (film director)|Tim]] and [screenwriter [[Karey Kirkpatrick|Karey]]] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with no one else to kind of feed off of.\"{{r|cctvhedge}} Lavigne found the recording process to be \"easy\" and \"natural\", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. \"I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still.\" Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. \"[The director] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude\".{{r|girlauinterview}} The film opened on May 19, 2006, making $38&nbsp;million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336&nbsp;million worldwide.{{r|mojohedge}}\n\nIn December 2005, Lavigne signed to appear in ''[[Fast Food Nation (film)|Fast Food Nation]]'', based on the book ''[[Fast Food Nation]]: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal''.{{r|contactmusicfastfood}} The fictionalized adaptation, directed by [[Richard Linklater]], traces fast-food hamburgers contaminated with cow feces back to the slaughterhouses.{{r|washingtonpostfastfood}} Lavigne played Alice, a high school student intent on freeing the cows.{{r|msnbcfastfood}}{{r|nytimesfastfood}} The film opened on November 17, 2006 and remained in theatres for 11 weeks, grossing $2&nbsp;million worldwide.{{r|mojofastfood}}\n\nBoth ''Over the Hedge'' and ''Fast Food Nation'' opened at the 2006 [[Cannes Film Festival]], which Lavigne attended. Lavigne felt honoured to be able to attend and was proud of her work. When asked if she would pursue her film career, she stated that she wanted to take her time and wait for the \"right parts and the right movies.\" Lavigne was aware of the roles she had chosen. \"I wanted to start off small and to learn. I wouldn't just want to throw myself into a big part.\"{{r|girlauinterview}} In August 2006, ''[[Canadian Business]]'' magazine ranked her as the seventh top Canadian actor in Hollywood in their second-annual ranking Celebrity Power List. The results were determined by comparing salary, Internet hits, TV mentions, and press hits.{{r|canadianbusiness}}\n\n==Fashion==\nIn July 2008, Lavigne launched the clothing line ''[[Abbey Dawn]]'', featuring a back-to-school collection. It is produced by [[Kohl's]], which is the brand's exclusive US retailer. Named after Lavigne's childhood nickname, Abbey Dawn is designed by Lavigne herself.{{r|warechok|venaabbey}} Kohl's describes Abbey Dawn as a \"juniors lifestyle brand\",{{r|kohls}} which incorporates skull, zebra, and star patterns, purples and \"hot pinks and blacks\". Lavigne, who wore some of the clothes and jewellery from her line at various concerts before its official launch, pointed out that she was not merely licensing her name to the collection. \"I actually am the designer. What's really important to me is that everything fits well and is well-made, so I try everything on and approve it all.\"{{r|usatodaybarker}} The clothing line incorporates Lavigne's musical style and lyrics, \"after the release of my first album, I realized how much fashion was involved in my musical career\".{{r|abbeyhuffington}}\n\nThe designs were also featured on the Internet game ''[[Stardoll]]'', where figures can be dressed up as Lavigne.{{r|nprmouse}} On September 14, 2009, Lavigne took her then latest collection for her clothing line to be a part of the [[New York Fashion Week]],{{r|newyorkabbey}} returning in 2011.{{r|abbeyhuffington}} In December 2010, the clothing line was made available to over 50 countries through the line's official website.{{r|artistdirectrelease|popeater}} \"It's fun to be a chick and design clothes and things I'd like for myself. I design things I [can't] find.\"{{r|inked2010}}\n\nLavigne released her first fragrance, [[Black Star (fragrance)|Black Star]], created by [[Procter & Gamble]] Prestige Products. The fragrance was announced on Lavigne's official website on March 7, 2009. Black Star, which features notes of pink hibiscus, black plum and dark chocolate, was released in summer 2009 in Europe, and later in the US and Canada.{{r|basenotes}} When asked what the name meant, Lavigne replied, \"I wanted [the bottle] to be a star, and my colors are pink and black, and Black Star resembles being different, and standing out in the crowd, and reaching for the stars; the whole message is just about following your dreams, and it's okay to be unique and be who you are.\"{{r|seacrestinterview6may}} Black Star won the 2010 Best \"Women's Scent Mass\" by Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW).{{r|cewblackstar}} Black Star was followed by a second fragrance in July 2010, ''[[Forbidden Rose]]'', which took two years to develop.{{r|2dayfm}} It features notes of red apple, winepeach, black pepper, lotusflower, heliotrope, shellflower, praline agreement, sandalwood, and vanilla.{{r|independentrose}} Its message is an extension of Black Star's \"follow your dreams\",{{r|perfumeblog}} though the tagline for the new perfume is \"Dare to Discover\".{{r|rosecommercial}} The commercial takes place in a [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] garden setting,{{r|perfumeblog}} where Lavigne, upon entering the garden, finds a single, purple rose.{{r|rosecommercial}} Lavigne launched a third fragrance, Wild Rose, in August 2011 and filmed the commercial for it in late 2010.{{r|popeater}} The tagline for the fragrance is \"Dare to discover more\".{{r|perfumediary}} It features notes of mandarin, pink grapefruit, plum, orange blossom, frangipani, blue orchid, musk, sandalwood and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.{{r|fragrantica}}\n\nIn January 2010, Lavigne began working with Disney to incorporate ''Alice in Wonderland''-inspired designs into her Abbey Dawn line of clothing.{{r|seacrestinterview26}} Her designs were exhibited at the [[Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising]] in California beginning in May through September, alongside [[Colleen Atwood]]'s costumes from the 2010 film.{{r|ladowntownalice}}\n\n==Artistry==\n\n===Musical style and songwriting===\nLavigne possesses a [[light-lyric soprano]] vocal range.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://riverbeats.life/glitter-gold-keshas-new-sound-best-yet/|title=From Glitter to Gold: Why Kesha\u2019s New Sound is Her Best Yet|first=River|last=Beats|date=August 18, 2017|accessdate=October 17, 2018|work=River Beats|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181018082740/https://riverbeats.life/glitter-gold-keshas-new-sound-best-yet/|archive-date=October 18, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Themes in her music include messages of self-empowerment from a female or an adolescent view.{{r|blossoming}} Lavigne believes her \"songs are about being yourself no matter what and going after your dreams even if your dreams are crazy and even if people tell you they're never going to come true.\"{{r|girlauinterview}} On her debut album, ''Let Go'', Lavigne preferred the less mainstream songs, such as \"[[Losing Grip]]\", instead of her more radio-friendly singles, such as \"[[Complicated (Avril Lavigne song)|Complicated]]\", saying that \"the songs I did with [[The Matrix (production team)|the Matrix]]&nbsp;... were good for my first record, but I don't want to be that pop anymore.\"{{r|teenspirit}} Lavigne's second album, ''Under My Skin'', had deeper personal themes underlying each song, saying that \"I've gone through so much, so that's what I talk about&nbsp;...

In addition to their distinctive position on civil rights, derived from said theory of revolutionary integrationism, the tendency also took a position that was more sympathetic to China than was the norm in the SWP, in part this being due to the alliance between the Kirk-Kaye tendency and the loser tendency of Arne Swabeck and Frank Glass.\n\nPolitical differences, as articulated by the soon-to-become FSP, included what was characterized as the SWP's uncritical support of the black nationalist views of [[Malcolm X]], SWP's orientation toward the [[labor aristocracy]], its opportunism in the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]], and its dismissive attitude toward the emerging [[feminist movement]]. The nascent FSP advocated the [[social class|class]] [[Solidarity (sociology)|solidarity]] of [[African-American|black]] and [[White people|white]] workers, called for a greatly expanded understanding of and attention to [[socialist feminism|women's emancipation]], and urged the [[anti-war]] movement to support the socialist, [[anti-colonialism|anti-colonial]] aims of the [[August Revolution|Vietnamese Revolution]].\n\nThe FSP became a pole of attraction for Seattle leftists opposed to the SWP's internal politics and established a home at Freeway Hall.<ref name=Crowley>{{cite book |last=Crowley|first=Walt|title=Rites of Passage: A Memoir of the Sixties in Seattle|year=2010|publisher=University of Washington Press|pages=21\u201322}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Winslow|first=Barbara|title=The Feminist Memoir Project: Voices from Women's Liberation|year=2007|pages=227, 230\u2013231, 235\u2013236|chapter=Primary and Secondary Contradictions in Seattle: 1967-1969|editor=Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Ann Barr Snitow}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=McKay|first=Ian|title=Rebels, Reds, Radicals: Rethinking Canada's Left History|year=2005|publisher=Between the Lines|page=242}}</ref>  The party formed [[Radical Women]] with the dual goal of building a revolutionary socialist feminist organization and teaching women the organizational and leadership skills they were often denied in male-dominated organizations.<ref name=NotableWomen>{{cite book |last=James|first=Edward T., Janet Wilson James, Paul S.

Women comprise a predominant part of the party leadership. Overall, membership is very diverse and is composed of all genders and races. The party characterizes its ''National Comrades of Color Caucus'' as offering the party's diverse ranks of people of color an opportunity to work together as a team to grow as leaders and provide direction for the party's work in people of color movements.\n\n== Strategy ==\nThe party has frequently supported [[united front]] efforts on a number of issues and often helps other socialist groups get on the ballot, while simultaneously running its own candidates for office.\n\nThe United Front Against Fascism (UFAF)\u2014founded by the FSP, but also including a broad coalition of the [[left-wing politics|Left]], the [[LGBT]] community, [[trade union|labor unionists]], [[feminism|feminists]], [[people of color]], [[Jew]]s, and [[civil liberties|civil libertarians]]\u2014took the lead in mobilizing against [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]] in the 1980s and 90s.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kubelbeck|first=Amy|title=Groups Of Gays Protest Picnic|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900804&slug=1086045|accessdate=2013-03-17|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=Aug 4, 1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Lacitis|first=Erik|title=An Ax To Grind -- When It Comes To Skinheads And Nazis, Loggers, Gays Unite|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910716&slug=1294655|accessdate=2013-03-17|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=1991-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Angelos|first=Constantine|title=Rice, Citizens Groups Join To Declare Seattle Won't Tolerate Hate Crimes|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900519&slug=1072597|accessdate=2013-03-17|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=1990-05-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Gough|first=William|title=A Gathering Of Neo-Nazis -- Encampment Draws Protest|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19911208&slug=1321657|accessdate=2013-03-17|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=Dec 8, 1991}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Reang|first=Putsata|title=Supremacist Guilty In Klan Scuffle -- Federal Way Man Broke Free- Lancer's Camera|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19961002&slug=2352224|accessdate=2013-03-17|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=Oct 2, 1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Wilcox|first=Laird|title=The Cultic Milieu|year=2002|publisher=Rowman Altamira|pages=334\u2013335|editor=Jeffrey S.

In addition to their distinctive position on civil rights, derived from said theory of revolutionary integrationism, the tendency also took a position that was more sympathetic to China than was the norm in the SWP, in part this being due to the alliance between the Kirk-Kaye tendency and the loser tendency of Arne Swabeck and Frank Glass.\n\nPolitical differences, as articulated by the soon-to-become FSP, included what was characterized as the SWP's uncritical support of the black nationalist views of [[Malcolm X]], SWP's orientation toward the [[labor aristocracy]], its opportunism in the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]], and its dismissive attitude toward the emerging [[feminist movement]]. The nascent FSP advocated the [[social class|class]] [[Solidarity (sociology)|solidarity]] of [[African-American|black]] and [[White people|white]] workers, called for a greatly expanded understanding of and attention to [[socialist feminism|women's emancipation]], and urged the [[anti-war]] movement to support the socialist, [[anti-colonialism|anti-colonial]] aims of the [[August Revolution|Vietnamese Revolution]].\n\nThe FSP became a pole of attraction for Seattle leftists opposed to the SWP's internal politics and established a home at Freeway Hall.<ref name=Crowley>{{cite book |last=Crowley|first=Walt|title=Rites of Passage: A Memoir of the Sixties in Seattle|year=2010|publisher=University of Washington Press|pages=21\u201322}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Winslow|first=Barbara|title=The Feminist Memoir Project: Voices from Women's Liberation|year=2007|pages=227, 230\u2013231, 235\u2013236|chapter=Primary and Secondary Contradictions in Seattle: 1967-1969|editor=Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Ann Barr Snitow}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=McKay|first=Ian|title=Rebels, Reds, Radicals: Rethinking Canada's Left History|year=2005|publisher=Between the Lines|page=242}}</ref>  The party formed [[Radical Women]] with the dual goal of building a revolutionary socialist feminist organization and teaching women the organizational and leadership skills they were often denied in male-dominated organizations.<ref name=NotableWomen>{{cite book |last=James|first=Edward T., Janet Wilson James, Paul S.

Women comprise a predominant part of the party leadership. Overall, membership is very diverse and is composed of all genders and races. The party characterizes its ''National Comrades of Color Caucus'' as offering the party's diverse ranks of people of color an opportunity to work together as a team to grow as leaders and provide direction for the party's work in people of color movements.\n\n== Strategy ==\nThe party has frequently supported [[united front]] efforts on a number of issues and often helps other socialist groups get on the ballot, while simultaneously running its own candidates for office.\n\nThe United Front Against Fascism (UFAF)\u2014founded by the FSP, but also including a broad coalition of the [[left-wing politics|Left]], the [[LGBT]] community, [[trade union|labor unionists]], [[feminism|feminists]], [[people of color]], [[Jew]]s, and [[civil liberties|civil libertarians]]\u2014took the lead in mobilizing against [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]] in the 1980s and 90s.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kubelbeck|first=Amy|title=Groups Of Gays Protest Picnic|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900804&slug=1086045|accessdate=2013-03-17|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=Aug 4, 1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Lacitis|first=Erik|title=An Ax To Grind -- When It Comes To Skinheads And Nazis, Loggers, Gays Unite|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910716&slug=1294655|accessdate=2013-03-17|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=1991-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Angelos|first=Constantine|title=Rice, Citizens Groups Join To Declare Seattle Won't Tolerate Hate Crimes|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900519&slug=1072597|accessdate=2013-03-17|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=1990-05-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Gough|first=William|title=A Gathering Of Neo-Nazis -- Encampment Draws Protest|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19911208&slug=1321657|accessdate=2013-03-17|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=Dec 8, 1991}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Reang|first=Putsata|title=Supremacist Guilty In Klan Scuffle -- Federal Way Man Broke Free- Lancer's Camera|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19961002&slug=2352224|accessdate=2013-03-17|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=Oct 2, 1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Wilcox|first=Laird|title=The Cultic Milieu|year=2002|publisher=Rowman Altamira|pages=334\u2013335|editor=Jeffrey S.
