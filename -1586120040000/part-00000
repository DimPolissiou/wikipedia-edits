It is a suburb of the [[Minneapolis-St. Paul|Twin Cities]]. The population was 21,456 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].<ref name=\"2010 Census\">{{cite web|title=2010 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL2.ST13&prodType=table|work=American FactFinder|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, 2010 Census|accessdate=23 April 2011}}{{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn the mid 18th century, [[Mdewakanton]] [[Sioux|Dakota]] tribes lived in the vicinity of New Brighton's [[marsh]]y [[lake]]s, harvesting [[wild rice]]. The Dakota eventually settled a village near Long Lake at [[Rice Creek (Mississippi River)|Rice Creek]] and a smaller encampment just east of Silver Lake Road on 3rd Street NW. Immigrants from [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[France]] settled a small village in 1858 which included a general store, school and mission church. As railroads were established in the area, millers in [[Minneapolis]] formed the Minneapolis Stockyards and Packing Company in 1888. The company supplied home, agriculture, and business needs. The venture included Minneapolis figures such as streetcar magnate [[Thomas Lowry]], flour millers [[John Sargent Pillsbury]], Senator [[William D. Washburn]], ex-Minneapolis Mayor W.H. Eustis, and industrialist W.H. Dunwoody. As the village grew in prominence, it was incorporated on January 20, 1891.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ci.new-brighton.mn.us/index.asp?Type=B_LIST&SEC=%7B2790088B-DA5F-4FAC-955D-4A608A855E2F%7D | title= New Brighton City History | publisher=City of New Brighton | year=2006}}</ref>  The city was given the name Brighton after Brighton, Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite book|last=Upham|first=Warren|title=Minnesota Geographic Names: Their Origin and Historic Significance|url=https://archive.org/details/minnesotageogra00uphagoog|year=1920|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|page=[https://archive.org/details/minnesotageogra00uphagoog/page/n456 437]}}</ref>  The founding population was primarily [[English-American]].<ref>http://www.ci.new-brighton.mn.us/index.asp?Type=B_LIST&SEC=%7B2790088B-DA5F-4FAC-955D-4A608A855E2F%7D</ref> Each August, a city festival celebrates this heritage, called the ''Stockyard Days'' and is held at Long Lake Park.\n\nAs the streetcar system expanded in the early 20th century, immigrant and first-generation groups from [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Germany]] began moving outwards from [[Northeast Minneapolis]]. New Brighton and St. Anthony residents also continue to celebrate this ethnic heritage with an annual ''Polka Dance Party'' which began in 1892.\n\nIn the 1920s, a local farmer said he heard a rumor that gold bars were buried along the eastern shore of Long Lake by bootleggers. This rumor spread and in the following years launched a mini \"gold rush\" along Long Lake to find the treasure.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|7.06|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|6.46|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.60|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-13|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-01-25}}</ref>  [[Rice Creek (Mississippi River)|Rice Creek]] flows through the northern part of the city.<ref>''King's Twin Cities Metro Street Atlas '04.''

It is geographically incongruent. From north to south it is not even, and east to west it is even in only a few places. A piece of the city sits on the east side of Interstate 35W isolated from the rest of the city.\n\nNearby places include [[Arden Hills, Minnesota|Arden Hills]], [[Shoreview, Minnesota|Shoreview]], [[Roseville, Minnesota|Roseville]], [[Saint Anthony Village, Minnesota|Saint Anthony Village]], [[Columbia Heights, Minnesota|Columbia Heights]], [[Fridley, Minnesota|Fridley]], [[Mounds View, Minnesota|Mounds View]], and [[Minneapolis]].\n\nNew Brighton has several parks, including Richard J. Hansen Park, Freedom Park, Sunny Square Park, Creek View Park, Meadow Wood Park, Hidden Oaks Park, Silver Oaks Park, Innsbruck Park, Veterans Park, Vermont Park, and Long Lake Regional Park. Bur oak trees over 200 years old and native prairie grass such as Big Bluestem can be found in Long Lake Park. Remnants of old farmsteads can be found at Long Lake Park as well (look for lilacs and rose bushes in the middle of the woods).\n\nNew Brighton is almost exactly halfway between the [[equator]] and the [[north pole]], with a [[latitude]] of 45 degrees.\n\nNew Brighton is part of east\u2013central Minnesota's glacial plain sandpile, which was flattened by glaciers during the [[Glacial history of Minnesota|most recent glacial advance]]. During the [[last glacial period]], massive ice sheets at least {{convert|0.62|mi|km|sigfig=1}} thick ravaged the landscape of the town and sculpted its current terrain which can be easily seen in Long Lake Regional Park within the city.<ref name=\"MNGeog\">{{cite book| last = Ojakangas | first = Richard W. |author2=Charles L.

Since the New Brighton landscape is still recovering from the weight of the glaciers and going through [[post-glacial rebound]] and the turmoil this created, the landscape is poorly drained created the numerous lakes and rivers found in the city. Long Lake itself is the remnants of the glaciers, as it was a chunk of ice that was left behind, melted, and created the lake in the hole it occupied.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1890= 355\n|1900= 350\n|1910= 375\n|1920= 368\n|1930= 500\n|1940= 658\n|1950= 2218\n|1960= 6448\n|1970= 19507\n|1980= 23269\n|1990= 22207\n|2000= 22206\n|2010= 21456\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=22899\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 29, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|author=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=November 6, 2014|author-link=United States Census Bureau}}</ref><br>2018 Estimate<ref name=\"2018 Pop Estimate\">{{cite web|title=Population Estimates|url=https://census.gov/data/tables/2018/demo/popest/total-cities-and-towns.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-13}}</ref> of 2010, there were 21,456 people, 8,915 households, and 5,731 families residing in the city.

About 3.3% of families and 4.7% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 5.5% of those under age 18 and 3.9% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Economy==\nNew Brighton has four public schools, several lakes (Long Lake and Silver Lake, Pike Lake, among others), one seminary, and many churches and places of worship ([[Lutheran]], [[Catholic]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS]], [[Jehovah's Witness]], [[Pentecostalism|Apostolic]], [[Baptist]], [[United Church of Christ]], [[Methodist|Korean Methodist]], [[Christian Science]], [[Non-denominational Christianity|Non-denominational]], and others). The town is mostly residential and split into different sections of residence. Sections of apartments, as well as Wexford Heights, an upper-middle-class housing development, dominate the southern end of the town. The apartments are often referred to collectively as \"Polynesian,\" the name of one apartment complex in the center of the area. \"Downtown New Brighton\" is distinguishable from other areas of the town because of the old-fashioned street lights set approximately {{convert|20|ft|m|spell=in}} apart down the entire road. Northern New Brighton has a small commercial area and is mostly middle-class homes built from the 70s to 90s.\n\n==Government==\n\n===City Council===\nNew Brighton has a Council / Manager form of city government. The City Council meets the second and fourth Tuesdays of the month at New Brighton City Hall, 803 Old Highway 8 NW. Meetings are open to the public and are televised live on New Brighton's [[Government-access television]] (GATV) [[cable TV]] channel 16. Meetings are held in the Council Chambers on the lower level off the rear parking lot. Agendas and Minutes are available online. Archived cable rebroadcasts are available at: [http://www.ctv15.org www.ctv15.org]\n\nThe following five citizens are the elected City Council:\n* Mayor Valerie Johnson\n* Councilmember Mary Burg\n* Councilmember Paul Jacobsen\n* Councilmember Emily Dunsworth\n* Councilmember Graeme Allen\n\n===Public safety===\nThe New Brighton Department of Public Safety provides police, fire, and emergency management services to the City. The Department is led by Public Safety Director Tony Paetznick, Deputy Director Trevor Hamdorf, and Deputy Director Dan Olson. The Police Division consists of 30 full-time police officers, 20 reserve police officers, four public safety officers, and three civilian support personnel. The Police Division responds to over 11,000 calls for service annually. Officer assignments include uniformed patrol, criminal investigations, crime prevention, and school resources officers (SRO) at Irondale High School and Highview Middle School. The Fire Division consists of 42 paid-on-call firefighters who respond to over 400 calls for service per year, a full-time fire marshal, and one civilian support staff. Several members of the Police Division also serve in the Fire Division. The Department also includes a Volunteers in Public Safety (VIPS) civilian volunteer team and a Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), both part of the Citizen Corps organization. The agency is headquartered in the state-of-the-art New Brighton Public Safety Center, which opened in 2003, and maintains a modern fleet of police and fire vehicles.\n\nThe influence of the Department of Public Safety extends far beyond New Brighton's {{convert|7.1|sqmi|km2}}. The agency is well known regionally and nationally for its successful community policing efforts and is a leading organization in Minnesota's crime prevention and emergency management communities. In 2004 New Brighton was awarded the prestigious International Community Policing Award by the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), given to just five cities in the world. The following year the National League of Cities bestowed its James C. Howland Award for community enrichment on New Brighton for its groundbreaking community policing partnership, which substantially reduced crime at the Polynesian Village apartment complex. In 2005, 2009, 2013, and 2015 New Brighton was named First Place in the nation for participation in National Night Out (population category four: 15,000-49,999) by the National Association of Town Watch. Over 10,000 cities compete annually for the award. New Brighton's first-place finish followed years of work by the Police Division's Crime Prevention Unit to build a strong network of neighborhood crime watch captains and agency volunteers and to promote participation in National Night Out by citizens from all segments of the community.\n\n==Education==\nFour public schools are located in New Brighton: Bel Air Elementary School, Sunnyside Elementary, Highview Middle School, and [[Irondale High School]]; additionally, until 2005, when it was converted into a community education center, there was a fifth public school located in New Brighton: Pike Lake Elementary School, now known as Pike Lake Education Center. All of these schools are part of the [[Mounds View Public Schools]] (District 621).\n\n* Bel Air Elementary is located on 5th Street NW, and serves 672 K\u20135 students from New Brighton.\n* Sunnyside Elementary is located on County Road H, and serves 518 K\u20135 students from New Brighton and [[Mounds View, Minnesota|Mounds View]].\n* Highview Middle School is located on 7th Street NW, and serves 814 6\u20138 grade students from New Brighton, [[Arden Hills, Minnesota|Arden Hills]], and [[Roseville, Minnesota|Roseville]].\n* Irondale High School is located on Long Lake Road, and serves 1,577 9\u201312 grade students from New Brighton, [[Mounds View, Minnesota|Mounds View]], and [[Shoreview, Minnesota|Shoreview]].\n\nNearby private high schools attended by residents include [[Totino-Grace High School|Totino-Grace]] in [[Fridley, MN|Fridley]], [[Minnehaha Academy]] in [[Minneapolis]], or [[Breck School]] in [[Golden Valley, Minnesota|Golden Valley]]. High school students in a portion of eastern New Brighton attend nearby Mounds View High School. Students from southern New Brighton formerly attended Mounds View, but the district lines were redrawn to send more students to Irondale to alleviate overcrowding. A small fraction of New Brighton students attend Wilshire Park Elementary and Saint Anthony Village Middle and [[St. Anthony Village High School|High Schools]] in nearby [[Saint Anthony Village, Minnesota|Saint Anthony Village]], as part of New Brighton is served by [[St. Anthony-New Brighton School District|ISD 282]].\n\nIrondale High School was listed as one of the top 500 schools in the country by [[Newsweek]] in 2000 and 2003,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060816052309/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12532678?s=1100&np=13&sort=raa msnbc]</ref> although it had a notoriously bad football team in the late 1990s. They won only 4 games during all of the 1996\u20131999 seasons. Although, in 2007 Irondale had its best season for football, winning 8 games and defeating Totino-Grace (the current state champions) although this great season was a nice change of pace for the Irondale community, they were bounced from the playoffs in their first game losing to White Bear Lake. However, the school has one of the most renowned [[marching band]]s in the state of Minnesota/USA. After bringing home top honors during the 1990s at many large state competitions, the Marching Knights are nationally recognized as being a high-ranking, proficient marching band. They often make finals at regional [[Bands of America]] competitions. B.O.A. is the largest national contest for many marching bands across America.<ref>[http://www.irondalemarchingknights.org/  Marching Knights website]</ref> The band placed second at the 2006 [[Youth in Music Band Championships]] held at the [[Hubert H.

Four productions are put on yearly, as well as a competition one act play. This high school was also mentioned in the movie [[In the Line of Fire]] starring Clint Eastwood. The assassin Mitch Leary tells a bank teller he grew up in Minneapolis and went to New Brighton high school.\n\n==Media==\nThe local newspaper of New Brighton, ''The Bulletin'', keeps New Brighton residents informed on various events in the city, and it is particularly thorough on two accounts: it details all of the crime in the northern suburbs and it reports on sporting events of New Brighton's Irondale High School. (Another local newspaper, the Sun Focus, details events occurring in the tri-city New Brighton-[[Mounds View, Minnesota|Mounds View]]-[[St. Anthony, Hennepin County, Minnesota|St. Anthony Village]] area.)  The Bulletin ceased publication in late 2019.\n\n==Water==\n[[Groundwater]] is pumped from 12 deep wells, ranging from 300 to {{convert|1000|ft|m}} deep. The groundwater is located in three [[aquifer]]s: Prairie du Chien, Jordan and Mt. Simon/Hinckley. New Brighton's water is classified as very [[hard water|hard]] with 17 to 20 grains per gallon (290 to 340 g/m\u00b3). Water hardness is due principally to calcium and magnesium and water is generally harder in areas where calcium and magnesium rich limestone rocks are present. New Brighton pumps some of its water from aquifers in [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]]/[[limestone]] rock formation.\n\n[[Groundwater pollution]] was discovered in the late 1980s in New Brighton along with Arden Hills and St. Anthony, which came from chemical dumping at the nearby [[Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant]]. Following litigation settlement, the U.S. Army provided New Brighton and the surrounding northern suburbs with clean water supplies and new systems to monitor and filter pollution.<ref>{{cite document| title=Superfund Record of Decision (EPA Region 5): New Brighton/Arden Hills, Minnesota (Fourth remedial action), (Amendment), August 1989 | date= August 1989 | publisher=Energy Citations Database | author= Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC (USA).

The questioner replies that there is no New Brighton High School, but she can't remember the name of the high school in New Brighton.

The Dakota eventually settled a village near Long Lake at [[Rice Creek (Mississippi River)|Rice Creek]] and a smaller encampment just east of Silver Lake Road on 3rd Street NW. Immigrants from [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[France]] settled a small village in 1858 which included a general store, school and mission church. As railroads were established in the area, millers in [[Minneapolis]] formed the Minneapolis Stockyards and Packing Company in 1888. The company supplied home, agriculture, and business needs. The venture included Minneapolis figures such as streetcar magnate [[Thomas Lowry]], flour millers [[John Sargent Pillsbury]], Senator [[William D. Washburn]], ex-Minneapolis Mayor W.H. Eustis, and industrialist W.H. Dunwoody. As the village grew in prominence, it was incorporated on January 20, 1891.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ci.new-brighton.mn.us/index.asp?Type=B_LIST&SEC=%7B2790088B-DA5F-4FAC-955D-4A608A855E2F%7D | title= New Brighton City History | publisher=City of New Brighton | year=2006}}</ref>  The city was given the name Brighton after Brighton, Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite book|last=Upham|first=Warren|title=Minnesota Geographic Names: Their Origin and Historic Significance|url=https://archive.org/details/minnesotageogra00uphagoog|year=1920|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|page=[https://archive.org/details/minnesotageogra00uphagoog/page/n456 437]}}</ref>  The founding population was primarily [[English-American]].<ref>http://www.ci.new-brighton.mn.us/index.asp?Type=B_LIST&SEC=%7B2790088B-DA5F-4FAC-955D-4A608A855E2F%7D</ref> Each August, a city festival celebrates this heritage, called the ''Stockyard Days'' and is held at Long Lake Park.\n\nAs the streetcar system expanded in the early 20th century, immigrant and first-generation groups from [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Germany]] began moving outwards from [[Northeast Minneapolis]]. New Brighton and St. Anthony residents also continue to celebrate this ethnic heritage with an annual ''Polka Dance Party'' which began in 1892.\n\nIn the 1920s, a local farmer said he heard a rumor that gold bars were buried along the eastern shore of Long Lake by bootleggers. This rumor spread and in the following years launched a mini \"gold rush\" along Long Lake to find the treasure.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|7.06|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|6.46|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.60|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-13|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-01-25}}</ref>  [[Rice Creek (Mississippi River)|Rice Creek]] flows through the northern part of the city.<ref>''King's Twin Cities Metro Street Atlas '04.''

It is geographically incongruent. From north to south it is not even, and east to west it is even in only a few places. A piece of the city sits on the east side of Interstate 35W isolated from the rest of the city.\n\nNearby places include [[Arden Hills, Minnesota|Arden Hills]], [[Shoreview, Minnesota|Shoreview]], [[Roseville, Minnesota|Roseville]], [[Saint Anthony Village, Minnesota|Saint Anthony Village]], [[Columbia Heights, Minnesota|Columbia Heights]], [[Fridley, Minnesota|Fridley]], [[Mounds View, Minnesota|Mounds View]], and [[Minneapolis]].\n\nNew Brighton has several parks, including Richard J. Hansen Park, Freedom Park, Sunny Square Park, Creek View Park, Meadow Wood Park, Hidden Oaks Park, Silver Oaks Park, Innsbruck Park, Veterans Park, Vermont Park, and Long Lake Regional Park. Bur oak trees over 200 years old and native prairie grass such as Big Bluestem can be found in Long Lake Park. Remnants of old farmsteads can be found at Long Lake Park as well (look for lilacs and rose bushes in the middle of the woods).\n\nNew Brighton is almost exactly halfway between the [[equator]] and the [[north pole]], with a [[latitude]] of 45 degrees.\n\nNew Brighton is part of east\u2013central Minnesota's glacial plain sandpile, which was flattened by glaciers during the [[Glacial history of Minnesota|most recent glacial advance]]. During the [[last glacial period]], massive ice sheets at least {{convert|0.62|mi|km|sigfig=1}} thick ravaged the landscape of the town and sculpted its current terrain which can be easily seen in Long Lake Regional Park within the city.<ref name=\"MNGeog\">{{cite book| last = Ojakangas | first = Richard W. |author2=Charles L.

The town is mostly residential and split into different sections of residence. Sections of apartments, as well as Wexford Heights, an upper-middle-class housing development, dominate the southern end of the town. The apartments are often referred to collectively as \"Polynesian,\" the name of one apartment complex in the center of the area. \"Downtown New Brighton\" is distinguishable from other areas of the town because of the old-fashioned street lights set approximately {{convert|20|ft|m|spell=in}} apart down the entire road. Northern New Brighton has a small commercial area and is mostly middle-class homes built from the 70s to 90s.\n\n==Government==\n\n===City Council===\nNew Brighton has a Council / Manager form of city government. The City Council meets the second and fourth Tuesdays of the month at New Brighton City Hall, 803 Old Highway 8 NW. Meetings are open to the public and are televised live on New Brighton's [[Government-access television]] (GATV) [[cable TV]] channel 16. Meetings are held in the Council Chambers on the lower level off the rear parking lot. Agendas and Minutes are available online. Archived cable rebroadcasts are available at: [http://www.ctv15.org www.ctv15.org]\n\nThe following five citizens are the elected City Council:\n* Mayor Valerie Johnson\n* Councilmember Mary Burg\n* Councilmember Paul Jacobsen\n* Councilmember Emily Dunsworth\n* Councilmember Graeme Allen\n\n===Public safety===\nThe New Brighton Department of Public Safety provides police, fire, and emergency management services to the City. The Department is led by Public Safety Director Tony Paetznick, Deputy Director Trevor Hamdorf, and Deputy Director Dan Olson. The Police Division consists of 30 full-time police officers, 20 reserve police officers, four public safety officers, and three civilian support personnel. The Police Division responds to over 11,000 calls for service annually. Officer assignments include uniformed patrol, criminal investigations, crime prevention, and school resources officers (SRO) at Irondale High School and Highview Middle School. The Fire Division consists of 42 paid-on-call firefighters who respond to over 400 calls for service per year, a full-time fire marshal, and one civilian support staff. Several members of the Police Division also serve in the Fire Division. The Department also includes a Volunteers in Public Safety (VIPS) civilian volunteer team and a Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), both part of the Citizen Corps organization. The agency is headquartered in the state-of-the-art New Brighton Public Safety Center, which opened in 2003, and maintains a modern fleet of police and fire vehicles.\n\nThe influence of the Department of Public Safety extends far beyond New Brighton's {{convert|7.1|sqmi|km2}}. The agency is well known regionally and nationally for its successful community policing efforts and is a leading organization in Minnesota's crime prevention and emergency management communities. In 2004 New Brighton was awarded the prestigious International Community Policing Award by the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), given to just five cities in the world. The following year the National League of Cities bestowed its James C. Howland Award for community enrichment on New Brighton for its groundbreaking community policing partnership, which substantially reduced crime at the Polynesian Village apartment complex. In 2005, 2009, 2013, and 2015 New Brighton was named First Place in the nation for participation in National Night Out (population category four: 15,000-49,999) by the National Association of Town Watch. Over 10,000 cities compete annually for the award. New Brighton's first-place finish followed years of work by the Police Division's Crime Prevention Unit to build a strong network of neighborhood crime watch captains and agency volunteers and to promote participation in National Night Out by citizens from all segments of the community.\n\n==Education==\nFour public schools are located in New Brighton: Bel Air Elementary School, Sunnyside Elementary, Highview Middle School, and [[Irondale High School]]; additionally, until 2005, when it was converted into a community education center, there was a fifth public school located in New Brighton: Pike Lake Elementary School, now known as Pike Lake Education Center. All of these schools are part of the [[Mounds View Public Schools]] (District 621).\n\n* Bel Air Elementary is located on 5th Street NW, and serves 672 K\u20135 students from New Brighton.\n* Sunnyside Elementary is located on County Road H, and serves 518 K\u20135 students from New Brighton and [[Mounds View, Minnesota|Mounds View]].\n* Highview Middle School is located on 7th Street NW, and serves 814 6\u20138 grade students from New Brighton, [[Arden Hills, Minnesota|Arden Hills]], and [[Roseville, Minnesota|Roseville]].\n* Irondale High School is located on Long Lake Road, and serves 1,577 9\u201312 grade students from New Brighton, [[Mounds View, Minnesota|Mounds View]], and [[Shoreview, Minnesota|Shoreview]].\n\nNearby private high schools attended by residents include [[Totino-Grace High School|Totino-Grace]] in [[Fridley, MN|Fridley]], [[Minnehaha Academy]] in [[Minneapolis]], or [[Breck School]] in [[Golden Valley, Minnesota|Golden Valley]]. High school students in a portion of eastern New Brighton attend nearby Mounds View High School. Students from southern New Brighton formerly attended Mounds View, but the district lines were redrawn to send more students to Irondale to alleviate overcrowding. A small fraction of New Brighton students attend Wilshire Park Elementary and Saint Anthony Village Middle and [[St. Anthony Village High School|High Schools]] in nearby [[Saint Anthony Village, Minnesota|Saint Anthony Village]], as part of New Brighton is served by [[St. Anthony-New Brighton School District|ISD 282]].\n\nIrondale High School was listed as one of the top 500 schools in the country by [[Newsweek]] in 2000 and 2003,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060816052309/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12532678?s=1100&np=13&sort=raa msnbc]</ref> although it had a notoriously bad football team in the late 1990s. They won only 4 games during all of the 1996\u20131999 seasons. Although, in 2007 Irondale had its best season for football, winning 8 games and defeating Totino-Grace (the current state champions) although this great season was a nice change of pace for the Irondale community, they were bounced from the playoffs in their first game losing to White Bear Lake. However, the school has one of the most renowned [[marching band]]s in the state of Minnesota/USA. After bringing home top honors during the 1990s at many large state competitions, the Marching Knights are nationally recognized as being a high-ranking, proficient marching band. They often make finals at regional [[Bands of America]] competitions. B.O.A. is the largest national contest for many marching bands across America.<ref>[http://www.irondalemarchingknights.org/  Marching Knights website]</ref> The band placed second at the 2006 [[Youth in Music Band Championships]] held at the [[Hubert H.

Four productions are put on yearly, as well as a competition one act play. This high school was also mentioned in the movie [[In the Line of Fire]] starring Clint Eastwood. The assassin Mitch Leary tells a bank teller he grew up in Minneapolis and went to New Brighton high school.\n\n==Media==\nThe local newspaper of New Brighton, ''The Bulletin'', keeps New Brighton residents informed on various events in the city, and it is particularly thorough on two accounts: it details all of the crime in the northern suburbs and it reports on sporting events of New Brighton's Irondale High School. (Another local newspaper, the Sun Focus, details events occurring in the tri-city New Brighton-[[Mounds View, Minnesota|Mounds View]]-[[St. Anthony, Hennepin County, Minnesota|St. Anthony Village]] area.)  The Bulletin ceased publication in late 2019.\n\n==Water==\n[[Groundwater]] is pumped from 12 deep wells, ranging from 300 to {{convert|1000|ft|m}} deep. The groundwater is located in three [[aquifer]]s: Prairie du Chien, Jordan and Mt. Simon/Hinckley. New Brighton\u2019s water is classified as very [[hard water|hard]] with 17 to 20 grains per gallon (290 to 340 g/m\u00b3). Water hardness is due principally to calcium and magnesium and water is generally harder in areas where calcium and magnesium rich limestone rocks are present. New Brighton pumps some of its water from aquifers in [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]]/[[limestone]] rock formation.\n\n[[Groundwater pollution]] was discovered in the late 1980s in New Brighton along with Arden Hills and St. Anthony, which came from chemical dumping at the nearby [[Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant]]. Following litigation settlement, the U.S. Army provided New Brighton and the surrounding northern suburbs with clean water supplies and new systems to monitor and filter pollution.<ref>{{cite document| title=Superfund Record of Decision (EPA Region 5): New Brighton/Arden Hills, Minnesota (Fourth remedial action), (Amendment), August 1989 | date= August 1989 | publisher=Energy Citations Database | author= Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC (USA).

He is unprepared when asked by a Minneapolitan which high school he attended. Leary answers \"New Brighton High School\". The questioner replies that there is no New Brighton High School, but she can't remember the name of the high school in New Brighton. This exchange proves to be important to the plot.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ci.new-brighton.mn.us City website]\n\n{{Ramsey County, Minnesota}}\n\n{{coord|45|04|N|93|12|W|type:city_region:US-MN|display=title}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Ramsey County, Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1891]]\n[[Category:1891 establishments in Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Cities in Minnesota]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWater:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Brighton,_Minnesota"}

The area, at the time, was once part of the former [[Khmer Empire]] and it was annexed to Vietnam in the 18th century. The city is named after the [[M\u1ef9 Tho River]]. In [[ch\u1eef n\u00f4m|Sino-Vietnamese script]], the name is given as {{linktext|\u7f8e|\u8429}} (beautiful tree).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nomfoundation.org/nom-tools/Nom-Lookup-Tool/Nom-Lookup-Tool |title=Vietnamese N\u00f4m Preservation Foundation |publisher=Nomfoundation.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-22}}</ref> \n\nDue to its proximity to [[Saigon]], M\u1ef9 Tho was the traditional gateway to the Mekong Delta. In the 17th century, the city had become one of the biggest commercial hubs in today's Southern Vietnam.\n\nIn the 1860s, M\u1ef9 Tho, along with Saigon, was a major strategic city during the French colonial campaign towards Vietnam. In 1862, France's [[capture of M\u1ef9 Tho]] is regarded as the conclusion to the establishment of the French colony of [[Cochinchina]], a development that inaugurated nearly a century of French colonial dominance in Vietnam. During the colonization period, the economy continued to prosper, attracting more immigrants, mainly from [[Chaozhou|Teochew]] and [[Minnan region|Minnan]].\n\nM\u1ef9 Tho City is recognized as a grade II in October 7, 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thevietnamguide.com/tvg/get-to-know-the-door-of-mekong-region-my-tho-city/ |title=My Tho grade II |publisher= Thevietnamguide.com}}</ref>\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n\nM\u1ef9 Tho is divided to 11 wards (called ''Ward 1 - Ward 10'', and ''Ward T\u00e2n Long'') and 6 communes.<ref name=amitourist>{{cite web |url=http://www.amitourist.com/Vietnam-destinations/My-tho.asp?cmd=reset |title=My Tho |publisher=Amitourist.com}}</ref>\n\n6 communes:\n*\u0110\u1ea1o Th\u1ea1nh\n*M\u1ef9 Phong\n*Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Th\u1ea1nh\n*T\u00e2n M\u1ef9 Ch\u00e1nh\n*Th\u1edbi S\u01a1n\n*Trung An\n*Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Th\u1ea1nh\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:TienGiang transportation map.png|thumbnail|left|[[Ti\u1ec1n Giang Province]] transportation map]]\n\nM\u1ef9 Tho is connected to the rest of the country by [[National Route 1A (Vietnam)|National Route 1A]] and [[Ti\u1ec1n River]].

M\u1ef9 Tho is well known as floating markets, where people sell and buy things on the river, as well as Ben Tam Ngua and [[M\u1ef9 Thu\u1eadn]] market.\n\n==Education==\n\nM\u1ef9 Tho was the first town in southern Vietnam to have a high school. The [[Coll\u00e8ge]] de M\u1ef9 Tho, opened in March 1879, is now called Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110\u00ecnh Chi\u1ec3u High School. It was one of the first schools Vietnam had, and even now is still known for its education quality among Southern schools.\n\nLater, another school called \"School for Gifted Students of Tien Giang\" opened in M\u1ef9 Tho city. Though the total area is very limited compared to other schools in the province, the quality of education there is usually considered one of the best. The curriculum they use is modified so that students usually learn more of their core subjects than in other schools. For instance, students from a Math class do all the required materials like any other classes, more of Chemistry, Biology, and Physics because they are in the Natural Science block, and a lot more of Math. Preparation for national exams and entrance examination to the university are prioritized there.\n\nSchools in M\u1ef9 Tho are named with famous Vietnamese writers, poets, and national heroes such as [[Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i]], Thu Khoa Huan is also known as Nguyen Huu Huan, [[Xu\u00e2n Di\u1ec7u]], [[L\u00ea Ng\u1ecdc H\u00e2n]], [[Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110\u00ecnh Chi\u1ec3u]], [[Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o]].\n\nTi\u1ec1n Giang College which became Ti\u1ec1n Giang University in 2005<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vzyx5mwzGGcC&pg=PA201&lpg=PA201&dq=tien+giang+college+became+University+in+2007#v=onepage&q=tien%20giang%20college%20became%20University%20in%202007&f=false |title=Vietnam community colleges |isbn=9781402094774 |last1=Raby |first1=Rosalind Latiner |last2=Valeau |first2=Edward J. |date=2009-03-22 }}</ref> is also located at M\u1ef9 Tho.\n\n==Economy==\n\nToday the economy is based on tourism, fishing, and agricultural products such as [[coconuts]], [[bananas]], and [[longan]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=MY THO - VIETNAM - MEKONG RIVER|url=http://www.luxurymekongrivercruise.com/destination/My-Tho.html|publisher=www.luxurymekongrivercruise.com|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring World War II the French [[Vichy government]] interned foreign nationals in M\u1ef9 Tho. In May 1945, the Japanese seized control of the camps fearing an allied attack. [[Foreign nationals]] were confined throughout the war. As the regional capital, M\u1ef9 Tho is the main market dealing in all the produce from the region as well as fish and seafood from M\u1ef9 Tho's large ocean-going fishing fleet. The very large and exuberant market is one of South Vietnam's biggest sources for dried fish and other dried seafood products such as Kho Muc (dried squid). At night the market is dedicated to the dealing and sorting of Mekong River fish, particularly [[catfish]] for H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City's wholesale markets. Produce, especially fruit and vegetables, is delivered by boat directly to markets. It is a popular starting point for tourists to take a boat trip on the Mekong River.\n\nM\u1ef9 Tho was the subject of \"The Lesson\", a chapter in a memoir by [[Tobias Wolff]], ''[[In Pharaoh's Army|In Pharaoh's Army: Memories of the Lost War]]'', describing the events of the 1968 [[Tet Offensive]] there.<ref>{{cite book |first=Tobias |last=Wolff |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4yJieb6EnSEC&dq= |title=In Pharaoh's Army: Memories of the Lost War |year=1995 |publisher=[[Alfred A.

The area, at the time, was once part of the former [[Khmer Empire]] and it was annexed to Vietnam in the 18th century. The city is named after the [[M\u1ef9 Tho River]]. In [[ch\u1eef n\u00f4m|Sino-Vietnamese script]], the name is given as {{linktext|\u7f8e|\u8429}} (beautiful tree).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nomfoundation.org/nom-tools/Nom-Lookup-Tool/Nom-Lookup-Tool |title=Vietnamese N\u00f4m Preservation Foundation |publisher=Nomfoundation.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-22}}</ref> \n\nDue to its proximity to [[Saigon]], M\u1ef9 Tho was the traditional gateway to the Mekong Delta. In the 17th century, the city had become one of the biggest commercial hubs in today's Southern Vietnam.\n\nIn the 1860s, M\u1ef9 Tho, along with Saigon, was a major strategic city during the French colonial campaign towards Vietnam. In 1862, France's [[capture of M\u1ef9 Tho]] is regarded as the conclusion to the establishment of the French colony of [[Cochinchina]], a development that inaugurated nearly a century of French colonial dominance in Vietnam. During the colonization period, the economy continued to prosper, attracting more immigrants, mainly from [[Chaozhou|Teochew]] and [[Minnan region|Minnan]].\n\nM\u1ef9 Tho City is recognized as a grade II in October 7, 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thevietnamguide.com/tvg/get-to-know-the-door-of-mekong-region-my-tho-city/ |title=My Tho grade II |publisher= Thevietnamguide.com}}</ref>\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n\nM\u1ef9 Tho is divided to 11 wards (called ''Ward 1 - Ward 10'', and ''Ward T\u00e2n Long'') and 6 communes.<ref name=amitourist>{{cite web |url=http://www.amitourist.com/Vietnam-destinations/My-tho.asp?cmd=reset |title=My Tho |publisher=Amitourist.com}}</ref>\n\n6 communes:\n*\u0110\u1ea1o Th\u1ea1nh\n*M\u1ef9 Phong\n*Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Th\u1ea1nh\n*T\u00e2n M\u1ef9 Ch\u00e1nh\n*Th\u1edbi S\u01a1n\n*Trung An\n*Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Th\u1ea1nh\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:TienGiang transportation map.png|thumbnail|left|[[Ti\u1ec1n Giang Province]] transportation map]]\n\nM\u1ef9 Tho is connected to the rest of the country by [[National Route 1A (Vietnam)|National Route 1A]] and [[Ti\u1ec1n River]].

M\u1ef9 Tho is well known as floating markets, where people sell and buy things on the river, as well as Ben Tam Ngua and [[M\u1ef9 Thu\u1eadn]] market.\n\n==Education==\n\nM\u1ef9 Tho was the first town in southern Vietnam to have a high school. The [[Coll\u00e8ge]] de M\u1ef9 Tho, opened in March 1879, is now called Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110\u00ecnh Chi\u1ec3u High School. It was one of the first schools Vietnam had, and even now is still known for its education quality among Southern schools.\n\nLater, another school called \"School for Gifted Students of Tien Giang\" opened in M\u1ef9 Tho city. Though the total area is very limited compared to other schools in the province, the quality of education there is usually considered one of the best. The curriculum they use is modified so that students usually learn more of their core subjects than in other schools. For instance, students from a Math class do all the required materials like any other classes, more of Chemistry, Biology, and Physics because they are in the Natural Science block, and a lot more of Math. Preparation for national exams and entrance examination to the university are prioritized there.\n\nSchools in M\u1ef9 Tho are named with famous Vietnamese writers, poets, and national heroes such as [[Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i]], Thu Khoa Huan is also known as Nguyen Huu Huan, [[Xu\u00e2n Di\u1ec7u]], [[L\u00ea Ng\u1ecdc H\u00e2n]], [[Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110\u00ecnh Chi\u1ec3u]], [[Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o]].\n\nTi\u1ec1n Giang College which became Ti\u1ec1n Giang University in 2005<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vzyx5mwzGGcC&pg=PA201&lpg=PA201&dq=tien+giang+college+became+University+in+2007#v=onepage&q=tien%20giang%20college%20became%20University%20in%202007&f=false |title=Vietnam community colleges |isbn=9781402094774 |last1=Raby |first1=Rosalind Latiner |last2=Valeau |first2=Edward J. |date=2009-03-22 }}</ref> is also located at M\u1ef9 Tho.\n\n==Economy==\n\nToday the economy is based on tourism, fishing, and agricultural products such as [[coconuts]], [[bananas]], and [[longan]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=MY THO - VIETNAM - MEKONG RIVER|url=http://www.luxurymekongrivercruise.com/destination/My-Tho.html|publisher=www.luxurymekongrivercruise.com|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring World War II the French [[Vichy government]] interned foreign nationals in M\u1ef9 Tho. In May 1945, the Japanese seized control of the camps fearing an allied attack. [[Foreign nationals]] were confined throughout the war. As the regional capital, M\u1ef9 Tho is the main market dealing in all the produce from the region as well as fish and seafood from M\u1ef9 Tho's large ocean-going fishing fleet. The very large and exuberant market is one of South Vietnam's biggest sources for dried fish and other dried seafood products such as Kho Muc (dried squid). At night the market is dedicated to the dealing and sorting of Mekong River fish, particularly [[catfish]] for H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City's wholesale markets. Produce, especially fruit and vegetables, is delivered by boat directly to markets. It is a popular starting point for tourists to take a boat trip on the Mekong River.\n\nM\u1ef9 Tho was the subject of \"The Lesson\", a chapter in a memoir by [[Tobias Wolff]], ''[[In Pharaoh's Army|In Pharaoh's Army: Memories of the Lost War]]'', describing the events of the 1968 [[Tet Offensive]] there.<ref>{{cite book |first=Tobias |last=Wolff |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4yJieb6EnSEC&dq= |title=In Pharaoh's Army: Memories of the Lost War |year=1995 |publisher=[[Alfred A.

Referencing manifestos written by Philip Roth and [[Stalking the Billion-Footed Beast|Tom Wolfe]], among others, Franzen grappled with the novelist's role in an advanced media culture which seemed to no longer need the novel. In the end, Franzen rejects the goal of writing a great [[social novel]] about issues and ideas, in favor of focusing on the internal lives of characters and their emotions. Given the huge success of ''The Corrections'', this essay offers a prescient look into Franzen's goals as both a literary and commercially minded author.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Franzen|url=http://www.harpers.org/archive/1996/04/0007955|title=Perchance to dream: In the age of images, a reason to write novels|work=Harper's|year=1996}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Franzen published a critique of the novels of [[William Gaddis]], entitled \"[[Mr. Difficult]]\", in ''[[The New Yorker]]''.  He begins by recounting how some readers felt ''The Corrections'' was spoiled by being too high-brow in parts, and summarizes his own views of reading difficult fiction.  He proposes a \"Status model\", whereby the point of fiction is to be Art, and also a \"Contract model\", whereby the point of fiction is to be Entertainment, and finds that he subscribes to both models.

The story centers on a young woman named Purity Tyler, or Pip, who doesn't know who her father is and sets out to uncover his identity. The narrative stretches from contemporary America to South America to East Germany before the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|collapse of the Berlin Wall]], and hinges on the mystery of Pip's family history and her relationship with a charismatic \nhacker and whistleblower.<ref name=\"artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com\"/>\n\nIn 2016, ''[[Daily Variety]]'' reported that the novel was in the process of being adapted into a 20-hour limited series for [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] by [[Todd Field]] who would share writing duties with Franzen and the playwright [[Sir David Hare]].

(essay)|Perchance to Dream]]''. Referencing manifestos written by Philip Roth and [[Stalking the Billion-Footed Beast|Tom Wolfe]], among others, Franzen grappled with the novelist's role in an advanced media culture which seemed to no longer need the novel. In the end, Franzen rejects the goal of writing a great [[social novel]] about issues and ideas, in favor of focusing on the internal lives of characters and their emotions. Given the huge success of ''The Corrections'', this essay offers a prescient look into Franzen's goals as both a literary and commercially minded author.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Franzen|url=http://www.harpers.org/archive/1996/04/0007955|title=Perchance to dream: In the age of images, a reason to write novels|work=Harper's|year=1996}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Franzen published a critique of the novels of [[William Gaddis]], entitled \"[[Mr. Difficult]]\", in ''[[The New Yorker]]''.  He begins by recounting how some readers felt ''The Corrections'' was spoiled by being too high-brow in parts, and summarizes his own views of reading difficult fiction.  He proposes a \"Status model\", whereby the point of fiction is to be Art, and also a \"Contract model\", whereby the point of fiction is to be Entertainment, and finds that he subscribes to both models.  He praises ''[[The Recognitions]]'', admits that he only got halfway through ''[[J R]]'', and explains why he does not like the rest of Gaddis's novels.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Franzen|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2002/09/30/020930fa_fact_franzen|title=Mr. Difficult|work=[[The New Yorker]]|year=2002}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004 Franzen published \"The Discomfort Zone\", a personal essay about his childhood and family life in Missouri and his love of [[Charles M.
