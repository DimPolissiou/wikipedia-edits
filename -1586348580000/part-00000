It dates back to the foundation of [[London Hospital Medical College]] in 1785. Queen Mary College, named after [[Mary of Teck]], was admitted to the University of London in 1915 and in 1989 merged with [[Westfield College]] to form Queen Mary and Westfield College. In 1995 Queen Mary and Westfield College merged with St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College and the London Hospital Medical College to form the School of Medicine and Dentistry.\n\nQueen Mary has five campuses across East and Central London in [[Mile End]], [[Whitechapel]], [[Charterhouse Square]], [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] and [[Smithfield, London|West Smithfield]], as well as an international presence in [[China]], [[France]], [[Greece]] and [[Malta]]. The Mile End campus is the largest self-contained campus of any London-based [[Russell Group]] university. In 2018/19 the university had around 26,000 students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.qmul.ac.uk/about/facts-and-figures/|title=Facts and figures - Queen Mary University of London|website=www.qmul.ac.uk}}</ref> Queen Mary is organised into three faculties \u2013 the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, the Faculty of Science and Engineering and [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry]].\n\nQueen Mary is a member of the Russell Group of British research universities, the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]] and [[Universities UK]]. Queen Mary is a major centre for medical teaching and research and is part of [[UCLPartners]], the world's largest [[academic health science centre]].

On 20 May 1885 the Drapers' Court of Assistants resolved to grant \u00a320,000 \"for the provision of the technical schools of the People's Palace.\"{{r|mosssaville|p=21}} The foundation stone was laid on 28 June 1886 and on 14 May 1887 [[Queen Victoria]] opened the palace's Queen's Hall as well as laying the foundation stone for the technical schools in the palace's east wing.\n\nThe technical schools were opened on 5 October 1888, with the entire palace completed by 1892. However others saw the technical schools as one day becoming a technical university for the East End.{{r|mosssaville|p=37}} In 1892 the Drapers' Company provided \u00a37,000 a year for ten years to guarantee the educational side income.\n\n===East London College===\n[[Image:Batl-chs01.jpg|thumb|right|Part of the Charterhouse Square site]]\nIn 1895 [[John Leigh Smeathman Hatton]], Director of Evening Classes (1892\u20131896; later Director of Studies 1896\u20131908 and Principal 1908\u20131933), proposed introducing a course of study leading to the Bachelorsee of Science degree of the [[University of London]]. By the start of the 20th century the first degrees were awarded and Hatton, along with several other Professors, were recognised as Teachers of the University of London. In 1906 an application for Parliamentary funds \"for the aid of Educational Institutions engaged in work of a University nature\", led to the College being admitted on an initial three-year trial basis as a School of the University of London on 15 May 1907 as East London College.\n\n[[Image:QMUL-Wind-Tunnel-1909.jpg|thumb|left|The ground-breaking wind tunnel built in the first ever aeronautical department in the UK]]\nTeaching of aeronautical engineering began in 1907 which led to the first UK aeronautical engineering department being established in 1909, boasting a ground-breaking [[wind tunnel]] and creating what became (following the demise of the [[University of Paris]]) the oldest Aeronautical Programme in the World.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aerospace Engineering Undergraduate Admissions|url=http://www.sems.qmul.ac.uk/ugadmissions/programmes/?aerospaceengineering|accessdate=11 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1910 the College's status in the University of London was extended for a further five years, with unlimited membership achieved in May 1915. During this period the organisation of the governors of the People's Palace was rearranged, creating the separate People's Palace Committee and East London College Committee, both under the Palace Governors, as a sign of the growing separation of the two concepts within a single complex.{{r|mosssaville|p=39\u201348}}\n\nDuring the First World War the College admitted students from the [[London Hospital Medical College]] who were preparing for the preliminary medical examination, the first step in a long process that would eventually bring the two institutions together. After the war, the College grew, albeit constrained by the rest of the People's Palace to the west and a burial ground immediately to the east. In 1920 it obtained both the Palace's Rotunda (now the Octagon) and rooms under the winter gardens at the west of the palace, which became chemical laboratories. The College's status was also unique, being the only School of the University of London that was subject to both the Charity Commissioners and the [[Board of Education (United Kingdom)|Board of Education]].\n\nIn April 1929 the College Council decided it would take the steps towards applying to the [[Privy Council]] for a [[Royal Charter]], but on the advice of the Drapers' Company first devised a scheme for development and expansion, which recommended amongst other things to re-amalgamate the People's Palace and the College, with guaranteed provision of the Queen's Hall for recreational purposes, offering at least freedom of governance if not in space.{{r|mosssaville|p=49\u201357}}\n\n===Queen Mary College===\nIn the early hours of 25 February 1931 a fire destroyed the Queen's Hall, though both the College and the winter gardens escaped. In the coming days discussions on reconstruction led to the proposal that the entire site be transferred to the College which would then apply for a Charter alone. The Drapers' Company obtained St Helen's Terrace, a row of six houses neighbouring the site, and in July 1931 it was agreed to give these over to the People's Palace for a new site adjacent to the old, which would now become entirely the domain of the College. Separation was now achieved. The Charter was now pursued, but the Academic Board asked for a name change, feeling that \"east London\" carried unfortunate associations that would hinder the College and its graduates. With the initial proposed name, \"Queen's College\", having already been taken by [[The Queen's College, Oxford]] and \"Victoria College\" felt to be unoriginal, \"Queen Mary College\" was settled on. The Charter of Incorporation was presented on 12 December 1934 by [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] herself.{{r|mosssaville|p=57\u201362}}\n\n====Under the charter====\n[[File:Queens' Building (2899476115).jpg|thumb|The Queens' Building]]\nDuring the Second World War the College was evacuated to [[Cambridge]], where it shared with [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]]. After the war the College returned to London, facing many of the same problems but with prospects for westward expansion.{{r|mosssaville|p=75\u201385}} The East End had suffered considerable bomb damage (although the College itself had incurred little) and consequently several areas of land near to the College site now became vacant. New buildings for physics, engineering, biology and chemistry were built on the new sites, whilst the arts took over the space vacated in the original building, now renamed the Queens' Building.\n\nLimited accommodation resulted in the acquisition of further land in [[South Woodford]] (now directly connected to [[Mile End tube station]] by means of the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]]'s eastward extension), upon which tower blocks were established. The College also obtained the Co-operative Wholesale Society's clothing factory on the Mile End Road which was converted into a building for the Faculty of Laws (and some other teaching), as well as the former headquarters of [[Spratt's]] Patent Ltd<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/spratt-s|title=Spratt's|work=London Remembers|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref> (operators of the \"largest dog biscuit factory in the world\" \u2013 see [[Spratt's Complex]]) at 41\u201347 Bow Road, which was converted into a building for the Faculty of Economics founded by [[Maurice Peston, Baron Peston]]. Both faculties were physically separated from what was now a campus to the west.{{r|mosssaville|p=86\u2013102}}\n\nFrom the mid-1960s until the mid-1980s the College proposed to link with the [[London Hospital Medical College]] and [[St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College]] with a joint facility in Mile End. A further link with both The London and St. Bartholomew's was made in 1974 when an anonymous donor provided for the establishment of a further hall of residence in Woodford, to be divided equally between Queen Mary College students and the two medical colleges.{{r|mosssaville|p=103\u2013117}}\n\nAt the start of the 1980s changing demographics and finances led to a reorganisation of the University of London. At Queen Mary some subjects, such as Russian and [[Classics]] were discontinued, whilst the College became one of five in the University with a concentration of laboratory sciences, including the transfer of science departments from [[Westfield College]], [[Chelsea College of Science and Technology|Chelsea College]], [[Queen Elizabeth College]] and [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]].{{r|mosssaville|p=117\u2013130}}\n\n===1989 to 2010===\n[[Image:Qmul-logo.png|thumb|The arms of Queen Mary & Westfield College (prior to the merger with the medical schools), combining details from the arms of the two individual colleges.

Over subsequent years, activities were concentrated on the Queen Mary site, with the Westfield site eventually sold.\n\nIn 1990, the London Hospital was renamed the Royal London Hospital, after marking its 250th year, and a reorganisation of medical education within the University of London resulted in most of the freestanding medical schools being merged with existing large colleges to form multi-faculty institutions. In 1995 the [[London Hospital Medical College]] and [[St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College]] merged into Queen Mary & Westfield College to form the entity now named Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry.<ref name=chronology>{{cite web|title=Chronology of Queen Mary College|url=http://www.library.qmul.ac.uk/archives/chronology/queen%20mary%20college|accessdate=11 September 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013205758/http://www.library.qmul.ac.uk/archives/chronology/queen%20mary%20college|archivedate=13 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000 the college changed its name for general public use to Queen Mary, University of London; in 2013, the college legally changed its name to Queen Mary University of London.

It dates back to the foundation of [[London Hospital Medical College]] in 1785. Queen Mary College, named after [[Mary of Teck]], was admitted to the University of London in 1915 and in 1989 merged with [[Westfield College]] to form Queen Mary and Westfield College. In 1995 Queen Mary and Westfield College merged with St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College and the London Hospital Medical College to form the School of Medicine and Dentistry.\n\nQueen Mary has five campuses across East and Central London in [[Mile End]], [[Whitechapel]], [[Charterhouse Square]], [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] and [[Smithfield, London|West Smithfield]], as well as an international presence in [[China]], [[France]], [[Greece]] and [[Malta]]. The Mile End campus is the largest self-contained campus of any London-based [[Russell Group]] university. In 2018/19 the university had around 26,000 students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.qmul.ac.uk/about/facts-and-figures/|title=Facts and figures - Queen Mary University of London|website=www.qmul.ac.uk}}</ref> Queen Mary is organised into three faculties \u2013 the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, the Faculty of Science and Engineering and [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry]].\n\nQueen Mary is a member of the Russell Group of British research universities, the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]] and [[Universities UK]].

On 20 May 1885 the Drapers' Court of Assistants resolved to grant \u00a320,000 \"for the provision of the technical schools of the People's Palace.\"{{r|mosssaville|p=21}} The foundation stone was laid on 28 June 1886 and on 14 May 1887 [[Queen Victoria]] opened the palace's Queen's Hall as well as laying the foundation stone for the technical schools in the palace's east wing.\n\nThe technical schools were opened on 5 October 1888, with the entire palace completed by 1892. However others saw the technical schools as one day becoming a technical university for the East End.{{r|mosssaville|p=37}} In 1892 the Drapers' Company provided \u00a37,000 a year for ten years to guarantee the educational side income.\n\n===East London College===\n[[Image:Batl-chs01.jpg|thumb|right|Part of the Charterhouse Square site]]\nIn 1895 [[John Leigh Smeathman Hatton]], Director of Evening Classes (1892\u20131896; later Director of Studies 1896\u20131908 and Principal 1908\u20131933), proposed introducing a course of study leading to the Bachelorsee of Science degree of the [[University of London]]. By the start of the 20th century the first degrees were awarded and Hatton, along with several other Professors, were recognised as Teachers of the University of London. In 1906 an application for Parliamentary funds \"for the aid of Educational Institutions engaged in work of a University nature\", led to the College being admitted on an initial three-year trial basis as a School of the University of London on 15 May 1907 as East London College.\n\n[[Image:QMUL-Wind-Tunnel-1909.jpg|thumb|left|The ground-breaking wind tunnel built in the first ever aeronautical department in the UK]]\nTeaching of aeronautical engineering began in 1907 which led to the first UK aeronautical engineering department being established in 1909, boasting a ground-breaking [[wind tunnel]] and creating what became (following the demise of the [[University of Paris]]) the oldest Aeronautical Programme in the World.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aerospace Engineering Undergraduate Admissions|url=http://www.sems.qmul.ac.uk/ugadmissions/programmes/?aerospaceengineering|accessdate=11 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1910 the College's status in the University of London was extended for a further five years, with unlimited membership achieved in May 1915. During this period the organisation of the governors of the People's Palace was rearranged, creating the separate People's Palace Committee and East London College Committee, both under the Palace Governors, as a sign of the growing separation of the two concepts within a single complex.{{r|mosssaville|p=39\u201348}}\n\nDuring the First World War the College admitted students from the [[London Hospital Medical College]] who were preparing for the preliminary medical examination, the first step in a long process that would eventually bring the two institutions together. After the war, the College grew, albeit constrained by the rest of the People's Palace to the west and a burial ground immediately to the east. In 1920 it obtained both the Palace's Rotunda (now the Octagon) and rooms under the winter gardens at the west of the palace, which became chemical laboratories. The College's status was also unique, being the only School of the University of London that was subject to both the Charity Commissioners and the [[Board of Education (United Kingdom)|Board of Education]].\n\nIn April 1929 the College Council decided it would take the steps towards applying to the [[Privy Council]] for a [[Royal Charter]], but on the advice of the Drapers' Company first devised a scheme for development and expansion, which recommended amongst other things to re-amalgamate the People's Palace and the College, with guaranteed provision of the Queen's Hall for recreational purposes, offering at least freedom of governance if not in space.{{r|mosssaville|p=49\u201357}}\n\n===Queen Mary College===\nIn the early hours of 25 February 1931 a fire destroyed the Queen's Hall, though both the College and the winter gardens escaped. In the coming days discussions on reconstruction led to the proposal that the entire site be transferred to the College which would then apply for a Charter alone. The Drapers' Company obtained St Helen's Terrace, a row of six houses neighbouring the site, and in July 1931 it was agreed to give these over to the People's Palace for a new site adjacent to the old, which would now become entirely the domain of the College. Separation was now achieved. The Charter was now pursued, but the Academic Board asked for a name change, feeling that \"east London\" carried unfortunate associations that would hinder the College and its graduates. With the initial proposed name, \"Queen's College\", having already been taken by [[The Queen's College, Oxford]] and \"Victoria College\" felt to be unoriginal, \"Queen Mary College\" was settled on. The Charter of Incorporation was presented on 12 December 1934 by [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] herself.{{r|mosssaville|p=57\u201362}}\n\n====Under the charter====\n[[File:Queens' Building (2899476115).jpg|thumb|The Queens' Building]]\nDuring the Second World War the College was evacuated to [[Cambridge]], where it shared with [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]]. After the war the College returned to London, facing many of the same problems but with prospects for westward expansion.{{r|mosssaville|p=75\u201385}} The East End had suffered considerable bomb damage (although the College itself had incurred little) and consequently several areas of land near to the College site now became vacant. New buildings for physics, engineering, biology and chemistry were built on the new sites, whilst the arts took over the space vacated in the original building, now renamed the Queens' Building.\n\nLimited accommodation resulted in the acquisition of further land in [[South Woodford]] (now directly connected to [[Mile End tube station]] by means of the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]]'s eastward extension), upon which tower blocks were established. The College also obtained the Co-operative Wholesale Society's clothing factory on the Mile End Road which was converted into a building for the Faculty of Laws (and some other teaching), as well as the former headquarters of [[Spratt's]] Patent Ltd<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/spratt-s|title=Spratt's|work=London Remembers|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref> (operators of the \"largest dog biscuit factory in the world\" \u2013 see [[Spratt's Complex]]) at 41\u201347 Bow Road, which was converted into a building for the Faculty of Economics founded by [[Maurice Peston, Baron Peston]]. Both faculties were physically separated from what was now a campus to the west.{{r|mosssaville|p=86\u2013102}}\n\nFrom the mid-1960s until the mid-1980s the College proposed to link with the [[London Hospital Medical College]] and [[St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College]] with a joint facility in Mile End. A further link with both The London and St. Bartholomew's was made in 1974 when an anonymous donor provided for the establishment of a further hall of residence in Woodford, to be divided equally between Queen Mary College students and the two medical colleges.{{r|mosssaville|p=103\u2013117}}\n\nAt the start of the 1980s changing demographics and finances led to a reorganisation of the University of London. At Queen Mary some subjects, such as Russian and [[Classics]] were discontinued, whilst the College became one of five in the University with a concentration of laboratory sciences, including the transfer of science departments from [[Westfield College]], [[Chelsea College of Science and Technology|Chelsea College]], [[Queen Elizabeth College]] and [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]].{{r|mosssaville|p=117\u2013130}}\n\n===1989 to 2010===\n[[Image:Qmul-logo.png|thumb|The arms of Queen Mary & Westfield College (prior to the merger with the medical schools), combining details from the arms of the two individual colleges.

Over subsequent years, activities were concentrated on the Queen Mary site, with the Westfield site eventually sold.\n\nIn 1990, the London Hospital was renamed the Royal London Hospital, after marking its 250th year, and a reorganisation of medical education within the University of London resulted in most of the freestanding medical schools being merged with existing large colleges to form multi-faculty institutions. In 1995 the [[London Hospital Medical College]] and [[St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College]] merged into Queen Mary & Westfield College to form the entity now named Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry.<ref name=chronology>{{cite web|title=Chronology of Queen Mary College|url=http://www.library.qmul.ac.uk/archives/chronology/queen%20mary%20college|accessdate=11 September 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013205758/http://www.library.qmul.ac.uk/archives/chronology/queen%20mary%20college|archivedate=13 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000 the college changed its name for general public use to Queen Mary, University of London; in 2013, the college legally changed its name to Queen Mary University of London.

The show marked as the first preschool animated series from Warner Bros. Animation. Although it was initially broadcast in the 4:3 aspect ratio, Baby Looney Tunes is the first Warner Bros. animated series to be produced in the widescreen aspect ratio (16:9). All episodes are currently available on the subscription streaming service [[Boomerang (TV network)]].\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Baby Looney Tunes episodes}}\n{{:List of Baby Looney Tunes episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n*[[Bugs Bunny|Baby Bugs]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[Sam Vincent (voice actor)|Sam Vincent]]) He is indicated to be the oldest of the babies, which makes him their official [[leader]]. His leadership however does tend to cause tension, especially with Lola and Daffy. Bugs sometimes gets teased for loving Lola and gets really annoyed by Daffy's name calling.\n*[[Tweety|Baby Tweety]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by Sam Vincent) A yellow [[Domestic canary|canary]]. The youngest and the smallest of the gang. Depicted as the brainstormer, because he comes up with ideas when the others are fresh out of them. He is very sensitive about his small frame (which he must overcome in most episodes centered around him) and curious about what he encounters.\n*[[Daffy Duck|Baby Daffy]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by Sam Vincent) He is second in the lead after Bugs. Often, he always wants his personal gain. When he does not get what he wants he believes he is treated unfairly, not noticing the inconvenience inflicted on the others. But half the time he does have good intentions. He is known to have a fear of robots. Daffy is jealous of Bugs. He seems to say \"Wahoo\" a lot very similar to his earliar shorts. Quite frequently he has made fun of Bugs by making fun of he's name and other things.\n*[[Lola Bunny|Baby Lola]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[Britt McKillip]]) Sometimes, she takes charge. Her independence is greater than the others and she has more [[Tomboy|boyish]] tendencies than the other girls.\n*[[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Baby Taz]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[Ian James Corlett]]) As much as Taz is well behaved, he often mistakes various objects for food and sometimes breaks things with his spin. He has a sense of fun which exceeds all the others. He is also more cheeky, crying when things go wrong or when Daffy steals from him.\n*[[Sylvester the Cat|Baby Sylvester]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[Terry Klassen]]) A cute [[Tuxedo cat]]. The tallest of the babies, not counting Bugs and Lola's ears. At times, he is [[Shyness|shy]] and anxious, and he makes an easy target for Daffy to hoax and trade with. He is rarely seen using his claws. He likes to get attention from Granny more than the others. Sylvester is afraid of lightning and he hates pickles.\n*[[Melissa Duck|Baby Melissa]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[Janyse Jaud]]) She often sticks with Petunia; the two were abruptly added to the main cast in the middle of the first season. She is a highly practical and creative sort with a friendly personality, but at times she can be a control freak and get on the others' nerves.\n*[[Petunia Pig|Baby Petunia]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[Chiara Zanni]]) She often sticks with Melissa; the two were abruptly added to the main cast in the middle of the first season. She is more intelligent than the other babies with insatiable curiosity. In the episode \"Let Harder They Fall\", she is no longer wearing diaper anymore like other babies but by the time Petunia wears yellow, frilly training underpants with a white bow in the middle and \"Petunia the Piggy Bank\", she learned to save money. \n*[[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[June Foray]]) She offers professional love and care for the babies to keep them happy. Being the only adult in their lives, the babies are fascinated and inspired by her intelligence, wisdom and ability to overcome problems when they arise with ease. Granny is strict, practical, and old fashioned. \n*Floyd Minton \u2013 (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]) Granny's nephew. Sometimes he is overwhelmed by the responsibility he takes on the babies, but he is determined never to let Granny down. He often keeps an eye on one of the individual babies in each episode during Season 2.\n\n===Others===\nSeveral other Looney Tunes characters have made cameos over the course of the show's run, mainly as guest spots or during songs. [[Miss Prissy|Baby Prissy]], [[Marc Antony and Pussyfoot|Baby Marc Antony]] and [[Penelope Pussycat|Baby Penelope]] appear in the songs, \u201cDown By The Cage\u201d, \u201cPaws and Feathers\u201d and \u201cVive Le Pew\", respectively.

The show marked as the first preschool animated series from Warner Bros. Animation. Although it was initially broadcast in the 4:3 aspect ratio, Baby Looney Tunes is the first Warner Bros. animated series to be produced in the widescreen aspect ratio (16:9). All episodes are currently available on the subscription streaming service [[Boomerang (TV network)]].\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Baby Looney Tunes episodes}}\n{{:List of Baby Looney Tunes episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n*[[Bugs Bunny|Baby Bugs]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[Sam Vincent (voice actor)|Sam Vincent]]) He is indicated to be the oldest of the babies, which makes him their official [[leader]]. His leadership however does tend to cause tension, especially with Lola and Daffy. Bugs sometimes gets teased for loving Lola and gets really annoyed by Daffy's name calling.\n*[[Tweety|Baby Tweety]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by Sam Vincent) A yellow [[Domestic canary|canary]]. The youngest and the smallest of the gang. Depicted as the brainstormer, because he comes up with ideas when the others are fresh out of them. He is very sensitive about his small frame (which he must overcome in most episodes centered around him) and curious about what he encounters.\n*[[Daffy Duck|Baby Daffy]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by Sam Vincent) He is second in the lead after Bugs. Often, he always wants his personal gain. When he does not get what he wants he believes he is treated unfairly, not noticing the inconvenience inflicted on the others. But half the time he does have good intentions. He is known to have a fear of robots. Daffy is jealous of Bugs. He seems to say \"Wahoo\" a lot very similar to his earliar shorts. Quite frequently he has made fun of Bugs by making fun of he's name and other things.\n*[[Lola Bunny|Baby Lola]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[Britt McKillip]]) Sometimes, she takes charge. Her independence is greater than the others and she has more [[Tomboy|boyish]] tendencies than the other girls.\n*[[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Baby Taz]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[Ian James Corlett]]) As much as Taz is well behaved, he often mistakes various objects for food and sometimes breaks things with his spin. He has a sense of fun which exceeds all the others. He is also more cheeky, crying when things go wrong or when Daffy steals from him.\n*[[Sylvester the Cat|Baby Sylvester]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[Terry Klassen]]) A cute [[Tuxedo cat]]. The tallest of the babies, not counting Bugs and Lola's ears. At times, he is [[Shyness|shy]] and anxious, and he makes an easy target for Daffy to hoax and trade with. He is rarely seen using his claws. He likes to get attention from Granny more than the others. Sylvester is afraid of lightning and he hates pickles.\n*[[Melissa Duck|Baby Melissa]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[Janyse Jaud]]) She often sticks with Petunia; the two were abruptly added to the main cast in the middle of the first season. She is a highly practical and creative sort with a friendly personality, but at times she can be a control freak and get on the others' nerves.\n*[[Petunia Pig|Baby Petunia]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[Chiara Zanni]]) She often sticks with Melissa; the two were abruptly added to the main cast in the middle of the first season.

Generally, gameplay is considered to be the overall experience of playing a video game excluding factors like graphics and sound. [[Game mechanics]], on the other hand, is the sets of rules in a game that are intended to produce an enjoyable gaming experience. Academic discussions tend to favor terms like ''game mechanics'' specifically to avoid ''gameplay'' since the latter term is too vague.<ref name=\"The Stupidest Word in Videogames\">{{cite book|last=Kierkegaard|first=Alex|title=Videogame Culture: Volume 1|year=2012}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}\nThere are three components to gameplay: \"Manipulation rules\", defining what the player can do in the game, \"Goal Rules\", defining the goal of the game, and \"Metarules\", defining how a game can be tuned or modified.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Frasca|first=G|title=Simulation versus narrative: introduction to ludology|journal=The Videogame Theory Reader|year=2003|pages=221}}</ref>  In video games gameplay can be divided into several types.

Playability is characterized by different attributes and properties to measure the [[video game]] [[player experience]].<ref name=Gonzalez2012>{{cite journal|last=Gonz\u00e1lez S\u00e1nchez|first=J.

The Desktop Systems try to minimize the learning effort, but in video games we can use the learning curve according to the game nature. For example, in one hand, we can demand great initial abilities before to play, or training them harshly in first phases of the game, to help players to understand and dominate all the game rules and resources and they can use them from the beginning of the game. In the other hand, players can learn step by step in a guided way when they need some ability in the video game.\n* '''Efficiency:''' the necessary time and resources to offer fun and entertainment to players while they achieve the different game objectives and reach the final goal. An efficient video game is able to catch the player's attention from the first instant, and provoke him to continue playing to the end of the game. Efficiency can be analyzed as the correct use of the challenge through the game, the correct structuring of the objectives or the best adaptation of the control to the actions in the game.\n* '''Immersion:''' the capacity to believe in the video game contents and integrate the player in the virtual game world. The immersion provokes that the player looks involved in the virtual world, becoming part of this and interacting with it because the user perceives the virtual world represented by the video game, with its laws and rules that characterize it. A video game has a good immersion level when it has equilibrium between the proposed challenges and the necessary player abilities to overcome it.\n* '''Motivation:''' the characteristics that provoke the player to realize concrete actions and persist in them until their culmination. To obtain a high degree of motivation, the game should have a set of resources to ensure the players perseverance in the performed actions to overcome the game challenges. This means, different factors to make sure positive behavior in the interpretation of the game process, focusing the player on the proposed challenges, showing the relevance of the objectives to reach and reward for challenges, promoting the player confidence to face them and the pleasure to achieve them.\n* '''Emotion:''' the involuntary impulse, originated in response to the stimulus of the video game and induces feelings or unleashes automatic reactions and conducts. The use of emotions in video games help to obtain a best player experience and leads players to different emotional states: happiness, fear, intrigue, curiosity, sadness... using the game challenges, story, aesthetic appearance or the music compositions that are capable of move, affect, to make to smile or to cry to the player. A big success of video games is that they can provoke to players different feelings in a short space of time, some of them hardly obtainable daily in the real world.\n* '''Socialization:''' the degree of the set of game attributes, elements and resources that promote the social factor of the game experience in group. This kind of experience provokes appreciating the video game in a different way, thanks to the relations that are established with other players or with other characters of the game that help the player to resolve jointly the game challenges in a collaborative, competitive or cooperative way. The game socialization allows players to have a totally different game experience when they play with other persons and promote new social relationships thank to the interaction among them.  In addition to this, socialization also is present at how the social connections that we have are projected with the group in the characters of the video game and context in which the game is realized. For example, choosing the player to be connected or to share something, interacting, obtaining information, asking for help, or negotiating for some items, and how our influence with the other character is positive or negative to achieve the game objectives. To promote the social factor it is advisable to develop new shared challenges that help players to integrate and being satisfied with the new game rules and objectives, creating a set of collective emotions where players (or characters) encourage and motivate themselves to overcome the collective challenges\n\n===Playability's facets===\nThe playability analysis is a very complex process due to the different point of view to analyze the different part of video game architecture. Each facet allows us to identify the different playability's attributes and properties affected by the different elements of video game architecture.<ref>Stanford Ontology Library [http://lsi.ugr.es/joseluisgs/videojuegos.owl Video game's Elements Ontology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603184631/http://lsi.ugr.es/joseluisgs/videojuegos.owl |date=2010-06-03 }}: A video game's elements ontology by Gonz\u00e1lez S\u00e1nchez, J. L. and Guti\u00e9rrez Vela, F. L. University of Granada, Spain.</ref> The playability's facets are:\n* '''Intrinsic Playability:''' the playability based on the own video game nature and how it is shown by the player. It is strongly related to the GamePlay and Game Mechanic. In this facet we can analyze the video game design implementation especially video game rules, goals, objectives, rhythm and other design mechanics.\n* '''Mechanical Playability:''' the video game quality as a software system. It is related to the Game Engine, with special emphasis, for example, in the fluency of the movie scenes, correct lights, shadows and rendering, sound and music, graphics motions, character personality implementation and communication systems in a multiplayer video game.\n* '''Interactive Playability:''' player interaction and video game user interface development, for example interaction dialog and game controls. This playability is easily visible in the Game Interface.\n* '''Artistic Playability:''' the quality of the video game arts and aesthetics in the game elements: visual graphics, sound effects, music and melodies, storyline and storytelling and how these elements are shown in the video game.\n* '''Intrapersonal Playability''' or '''Personal Playability''': the individual vision, perception, and feelings that the video game produces in each player when they play the game. It has a highly subjective value.\n* '''Interpersonal Playability''' or '''Social Playability:''' the group consciousness and different user perceptions when the player plays with other player in a competitive, cooperative or collaborative way.\n\nFinally, the \"global\" playability of a video game will be deduced through each attribute value in the different playability's facets. It is crucial to improve the playability in the different facets to guarantee the best player experience when the player plays the video game.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Game development]] and [[Game design]]\n* [[Game mechanics]]\n* [[Interaction design]]\n* [[Play (activity)]]\n* [[Time-keeping systems in games]]\n* [[Video game genres]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading on playability==\n\n* Desurvire, H., Caplan, M., & Toth, J.

Generally, gameplay is considered to be the overall experience of playing a video game excluding factors like graphics and sound. [[Game mechanics]], on the other hand, is the sets of rules in a game that are intended to produce an enjoyable gaming experience. Academic discussions tend to favor terms like ''game mechanics'' specifically to avoid ''gameplay'' since the latter term is too vague.<ref name=\"The Stupidest Word in Videogames\">{{cite book|last=Kierkegaard|first=Alex|title=Videogame Culture: Volume 1|year=2012}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}\nThere are three components to gameplay: \"Manipulation rules\", defining what the player can do in the game, \"Goal Rules\", defining the goal of the game, and \"Metarules\", defining how a game can be tuned or modified.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Frasca|first=G|title=Simulation versus narrative: introduction to ludology|journal=The Videogame Theory Reader|year=2003|pages=221}}</ref>  In video games gameplay can be divided into several types.

Playability is characterized by different attributes and properties to measure the [[video game]] [[player experience]].<ref name=Gonzalez2012>{{cite journal|last=Gonz\u00e1lez S\u00e1nchez|first=J.

The Desktop Systems try to minimize the learning effort, but in video games we can use the learning curve according to the game nature. For example, in one hand, we can demand great initial abilities before to play, or training them harshly in first phases of the game, to help players to understand and dominate all the game rules and resources and they can use them from the beginning of the game. In the other hand, players can learn step by step in a guided way when they need some ability in the video game.\n* '''Efficiency:''' the necessary time and resources to offer fun and entertainment to players while they achieve the different game objectives and reach the final goal. An efficient video game is able to catch the player's attention from the first instant, and provoke him to continue playing to the end of the game. Efficiency can be analyzed as the correct use of the challenge through the game, the correct structuring of the objectives or the best adaptation of the control to the actions in the game.\n* '''Immersion:''' the capacity to believe in the video game contents and integrate the player in the virtual game world. The immersion provokes that the player looks involved in the virtual world, becoming part of this and interacting with it because the user perceives the virtual world represented by the video game, with its laws and rules that characterize it. A video game has a good immersion level when it has equilibrium between the proposed challenges and the necessary player abilities to overcome it.\n* '''Motivation:''' the characteristics that provoke the player to realize concrete actions and persist in them until their culmination. To obtain a high degree of motivation, the game should have a set of resources to ensure the players perseverance in the performed actions to overcome the game challenges. This means, different factors to make sure positive behavior in the interpretation of the game process, focusing the player on the proposed challenges, showing the relevance of the objectives to reach and reward for challenges, promoting the player confidence to face them and the pleasure to achieve them.\n* '''Emotion:''' the involuntary impulse, originated in response to the stimulus of the video game and induces feelings or unleashes automatic reactions and conducts. The use of emotions in video games help to obtain a best player experience and leads players to different emotional states: happiness, fear, intrigue, curiosity, sadness\u2026 using the game challenges, story, aesthetic appearance or the music compositions that are capable of move, affect, to make to smile or to cry to the player. A big success of video games is that they can provoke to players different feelings in a short space of time, some of them hardly obtainable daily in the real world.\n* '''Socialization:''' the degree of the set of game attributes, elements and resources that promote the social factor of the game experience in group. This kind of experience provokes appreciating the video game in a different way, thanks to the relations that are established with other players or with other characters of the game that help the player to resolve jointly the game challenges in a collaborative, competitive or cooperative way. The game socialization allows players to have a totally different game experience when they play with other persons and promote new social relationships thank to the interaction among them.  In addition to this, socialization also is present at how the social connections that we have are projected with the group in the characters of the video game and context in which the game is realized. For example, choosing the player to be connected or to share something, interacting, obtaining information, asking for help, or negotiating for some items, and how our influence with the other character is positive or negative to achieve the game objectives. To promote the social factor it is advisable to develop new shared challenges that help players to integrate and being satisfied with the new game rules and objectives, creating a set of collective emotions where players (or characters) encourage and motivate themselves to overcome the collective challenges\n\n===Playability's facets===\nThe playability analysis is a very complex process due to the different point of view to analyze the different part of video game architecture. Each facet allows us to identify the different playability's attributes and properties affected by the different elements of video game architecture.<ref>Stanford Ontology Library [http://lsi.ugr.es/joseluisgs/videojuegos.owl Video game's Elements Ontology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603184631/http://lsi.ugr.es/joseluisgs/videojuegos.owl |date=2010-06-03 }}: A video game's elements ontology by Gonz\u00e1lez S\u00e1nchez, J. L. and Guti\u00e9rrez Vela, F. L. University of Granada, Spain.</ref> The playability's facets are:\n* '''Intrinsic Playability:''' the playability based on the own video game nature and how it is shown by the player. It is strongly related to the GamePlay and Game Mechanic. In this facet we can analyze the video game design implementation especially video game rules, goals, objectives, rhythm and other design mechanics.\n* '''Mechanical Playability:''' the video game quality as a software system. It is related to the Game Engine, with special emphasis, for example, in the fluency of the movie scenes, correct lights, shadows and rendering, sound and music, graphics motions, character personality implementation and communication systems in a multiplayer video game.\n* '''Interactive Playability:''' player interaction and video game user interface development, for example interaction dialog and game controls. This playability is easily visible in the Game Interface.\n* '''Artistic Playability:''' the quality of the video game arts and aesthetics in the game elements: visual graphics, sound effects, music and melodies, storyline and storytelling and how these elements are shown in the video game.\n* '''Intrapersonal Playability''' or '''Personal Playability''': the individual vision, perception, and feelings that the video game produces in each player when they play the game. It has a highly subjective value.\n* '''Interpersonal Playability''' or '''Social Playability:''' the group consciousness and different user perceptions when the player plays with other player in a competitive, cooperative or collaborative way.\n\nFinally, the \"global\" playability of a video game will be deduced through each attribute value in the different playability's facets. It is crucial to improve the playability in the different facets to guarantee the best player experience when the player plays the video game.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Game development]] and [[Game design]]\n* [[Game mechanics]]\n* [[Interaction design]]\n* [[Play (activity)]]\n* [[Time-keeping systems in games]]\n* [[Video game genres]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading on playability==\n\n* Desurvire, H., Caplan, M., & Toth, J.

In 1521, a book called ''Geystlich Strass'' (German: \"spiritual road\") was printed with illustrations of the stations in the Holy Land.<ref name=Thurston/>\n\nDuring the 15th and 16th centuries the Franciscans began to build a series of outdoor shrines in Europe to duplicate their counterparts in the Holy Land.  The number of stations varied between seven and thirty; seven was common. These were usually placed, often in small buildings, along the approach to a church, as in a set of 1490 by [[Adam Kraft]], leading to the Johanniskirche in [[Nuremberg]].<ref name=Schiller>[[Gertrud Schiller|Schiller, Gertrud]],  ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. II'', p. 82, 1972 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, {{ISBN|0-85331-324-5}}</ref>  A number of rural examples were established as attractions in their own right, usually on attractive wooded hills.

In these the sculptures are often approaching life-size and very elaborate. Remnants of these are often referred to as [[calvary hill]]s.\n\nIn 1686, in answer to their petition, [[Pope Innocent XI]] granted to the Franciscans the right to erect stations within their churches.  In 1731, [[Pope Clement XII]] extended to all churches the right to have the stations, provided that a Franciscan father erected them, with the consent of the local bishop.  At the same time the number was  fixed at fourteen.  In 1857, the bishops of England were allowed to erect the stations by themselves, without the intervention of a Franciscan priest, and in 1862 this right was extended to bishops throughout the church.<ref>''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1907). s.v. \"The Way of the Cross\".</ref>\n\n== Stations ==\n\n[[File:Cross Stations a.jpg|thumb|A set of the traditional 14 scenes from [[Cathedral of the Most Holy Rosary|Portuguese Church, Kolkata]]]]\n[[File:Normandie Manche Avranches3 tango7174.jpg|thumb|A set of the traditional 14 scenes in [[Limoges enamel]]]]\n[[File:The last Station of the Cross, Saint Mary Rawaseneng Prayer Garden.JPG|thumb|The Resurrection of Jesus at the Saint Mary Rawaseneng Prayer Garden, in the [[Rawaseneng Monastery]], Indonesia]]\n\nThe early set of seven scenes was usually numbers 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11  and 14 from the list below.<ref name=Schiller/>  The standard set from the 17th to 20th centuries has consisted of 14 pictures or sculptures depicting the following scenes:\n# [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|Jesus is condemned to death]]\n# Jesus carries His cross\n# Jesus [[Jesus falls the first time|falls for the first time]]\n# Jesus meets [[Mary, mother of Jesus|His mother, Mary]]\n# [[Simon of Cyrene]] helps Jesus carry the cross\n# [[Saint Veronica|Veronica]] wipes the face of Jesus\n# Jesus falls for the second time\n# Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem\n# Jesus falls for the third time\n# Jesus is stripped of His clothes\n# [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus is nailed to the cross]]\n# Jesus dies on the cross\n# Jesus is [[Descent from the Cross|taken down from the cross]]\n# [[Burial of Jesus|Jesus is placed in the tomb]]\nAlthough not traditionally part of the Stations, the [[Resurrection of Jesus]] is sometimes included as an unofficial fifteenth station.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Official Web Site for the Archdiocese of Detroit | accessdate=2012-02-13 | url=http://www.aodonline.org/aodonline-sqlimages/stationsofthecross/stations.pdf | quote=In some contemporary Stations of the Cross, a fifteenth station has been added to commemorate the Resurrection of the Lord. | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223130823/http://www.aodonline.org/aodonline-sqlimages/stationsofthecross/stations.pdf | archivedate=2010-12-23 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Fr.

To provide a version of this devotion more closely aligned with the biblical accounts, [[Pope John Paul II]] introduced a new form of devotion, called the [[Scriptural Way of the Cross]], on [[Good Friday]] 1991.

Originally, the pope himself carried the cross from station to station, but in his last years when age and infirmity limited his strength, John Paul presided over the celebration from a stage on the [[Palatine Hill]], while others carried the cross. Just days prior to his death in 2005, Pope John Paul II observed the Stations of the Cross from his private chapel. Each year a different person is invited to write the meditation texts for the Stations. Past composers of the Papal Stations include several non-Catholics. The pope himself wrote the texts for the [[Great Jubilee]] in 2000 and used the traditional Stations.\n\nThe celebration of the Stations of the Cross is especially common on the Fridays of Lent, especially Good Friday. Community celebrations are usually accompanied by various songs and prayers. Particularly common as musical accompaniment is the  [[Stabat Mater]].  At the end of each station the [[Adoramus Te]] is sometimes sung. The Alleluia is also sung, except during Lent.\n\nStructurally, [[Mel Gibson]]'s 2004 film, ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', follows the Stations of the Cross.<ref>[http://old.usccb.org/movies/p/thepassionofthechrist.shtml Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430015224/http://old.usccb.org/movies/p/thepassionofthechrist.shtml |date=2012-04-30 }}, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, 2004</ref> The fifteenth and last station, the Resurrection, is not prominently depicted (compared to the other fourteen) but it is implied since the last shot before credit titles is Jesus resurrected and about to leave the tomb.\n\n== Debates ==\n\n=== Place of Christ's resurrection ===\nSome modern liturgists<ref>{{cite book|isbn=978-0-06-065338-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780060653385/page/1222 1222]|last=McBrien|first=Richard P.|author2=Harold W.

Advocates of the traditional form of the Stations ending with the body of Jesus being placed in the tomb say the Stations are intended as a meditation on the [[Atonement in Christianity|atoning]] death of Jesus, and not as a complete picture of his life, death, and resurrection. Another point of contention, at least between some ranking liturgists and traditionalists, is (the use of) the \"New Way of the Cross\" being recited exclusively in the Philippines and by Filipinos abroad.\n\nThe [[Stations of the Resurrection]] (also known by the Latin name of '''''Via Lucis''','' Way of Light) are used in some churches at [[Easter]]tide to meditate on the Resurrection and [[Ascension of Jesus Christ]].\n\n== Music ==\n[[Franz Liszt]] wrote a ''[[Via crucis (Liszt)|Via Crucis]]'' for choir, soloists and piano or organ or harmonium in 1879. In 1931, French organist [[Marcel Dupr\u00e9]] improvised and transcribed musical meditations based on fourteen poems by [[Paul Claudel]], one for each station.\n[[Peter Maxwell Davies]]'s ''Vesalii Icones'' (1969), for male dancer, solo cello and instrumental ensemble, brings together the Stations of the Cross and a series of drawings from the anatomical treatise ''De humani corporis fabrica'' (1543) by the Belgian physician Andreas van Wesel ([[Vesalius]]). In Davies's sequence, the final \"station\" represents the Resurrection, but of [[Antichrist]], the composer's moral point being the need to distinguish what is false from what is real.<ref>Composer's note in the published score (Boosey and Hawkes, B & H 20286).</ref>\n[[David Bowie]] regarded his 1976 song \"[[Station to Station (song)|Station to Station]]\" as \"very much concerned with the stations of the cross\".<ref name=Q97X>{{cite journal | last=Cavanagh | first=David | title=ChangesFiftyBowie | journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q magazine]] |date=February 1997 | pages=52\u201359}}</ref> [[Pawe\u0142_\u0141ukaszewski]] wrote ''Via Crucis'' in 2000 and it was premiered by the [[Wroc\u0142aw Opera]] on Good Friday March 30, 2018, and transmitted on [[TVP_Kultura]].

In 1521, a book called ''Geystlich Strass'' (German: \"spiritual road\") was printed with illustrations of the stations in the Holy Land.<ref name=Thurston/>\n\nDuring the 15th and 16th centuries the Franciscans began to build a series of outdoor shrines in Europe to duplicate their counterparts in the Holy Land.  The number of stations varied between seven and thirty; seven was common. These were usually placed, often in small buildings, along the approach to a church, as in a set of 1490 by [[Adam Kraft]], leading to the Johanniskirche in [[Nuremberg]].<ref name=Schiller>[[Gertrud Schiller|Schiller, Gertrud]],  ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. II'', p. 82, 1972 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, {{ISBN|0-85331-324-5}}</ref>  A number of rural examples were established as attractions in their own right, usually on attractive wooded hills.

In these the sculptures are often approaching life-size and very elaborate. Remnants of these are often referred to as [[calvary hill]]s.\n\nIn 1686, in answer to their petition, [[Pope Innocent XI]] granted to the Franciscans the right to erect stations within their churches.  In 1731, [[Pope Clement XII]] extended to all churches the right to have the stations, provided that a Franciscan father erected them, with the consent of the local bishop.  At the same time the number was  fixed at fourteen.  In 1857, the bishops of England were allowed to erect the stations by themselves, without the intervention of a Franciscan priest, and in 1862 this right was extended to bishops throughout the church.<ref>''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1907). s.v. \"The Way of the Cross\".</ref>\n\n== Stations ==\n\n[[File:Cross Stations a.jpg|thumb|A set of the traditional 14 scenes from [[Cathedral of the Most Holy Rosary|Portuguese Church, Kolkata]]]]\n[[File:Normandie Manche Avranches3 tango7174.jpg|thumb|A set of the traditional 14 scenes in [[Limoges enamel]]]]\n[[File:The last Station of the Cross, Saint Mary Rawaseneng Prayer Garden.JPG|thumb|The Resurrection of Jesus at the Saint Mary Rawaseneng Prayer Garden, in the [[Rawaseneng Monastery]], Indonesia]]\n\nThe early set of seven scenes was usually numbers 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11  and 14 from the list below.<ref name=Schiller/>  The standard set from the 17th to 20th centuries has consisted of 14 pictures or sculptures depicting the following scenes:\n# [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|Jesus is condemned to death]]\n# Jesus carries His cross\n# Jesus [[Jesus falls the first time|falls for the first time]]\n# Jesus meets [[Mary, mother of Jesus|His mother, Mary]]\n# [[Simon of Cyrene]] helps Jesus carry the cross\n# [[Saint Veronica|Veronica]] wipes the face of Jesus\n# Jesus falls for the second time\n# Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem\n# Jesus falls for the third time\n# Jesus is stripped of His clothes\n# [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus is nailed to the cross]]\n# Jesus dies on the cross\n# Jesus is [[Descent from the Cross|taken down from the cross]]\n# [[Burial of Jesus|Jesus is placed in the tomb]]\nAlthough not traditionally part of the Stations, the [[Resurrection of Jesus]] is sometimes included as an unofficial fifteenth station.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Official Web Site for the Archdiocese of Detroit | accessdate=2012-02-13 | url=http://www.aodonline.org/aodonline-sqlimages/stationsofthecross/stations.pdf | quote=In some contemporary Stations of the Cross, a fifteenth station has been added to commemorate the Resurrection of the Lord. | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223130823/http://www.aodonline.org/aodonline-sqlimages/stationsofthecross/stations.pdf | archivedate=2010-12-23 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Fr.

To provide a version of this devotion more closely aligned with the biblical accounts, [[Pope John Paul II]] introduced a new form of devotion, called the [[Scriptural Way of the Cross]], on [[Good Friday]] 1991.

Originally, the pope himself carried the cross from station to station, but in his last years when age and infirmity limited his strength, John Paul presided over the celebration from a stage on the [[Palatine Hill]], while others carried the cross. Just days prior to his death in 2005, Pope John Paul II observed the Stations of the Cross from his private chapel. Each year a different person is invited to write the meditation texts for the Stations. Past composers of the Papal Stations include several non-Catholics. The pope himself wrote the texts for the [[Great Jubilee]] in 2000 and used the traditional Stations.\n\nThe celebration of the Stations of the Cross is especially common on the Fridays of Lent, especially Good Friday. Community celebrations are usually accompanied by various songs and prayers. Particularly common as musical accompaniment is the  [[Stabat Mater]].  At the end of each station the [[Adoramus Te]] is sometimes sung. The Alleluia is also sung, except during Lent.\n\nStructurally, [[Mel Gibson]]'s 2004 film, ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', follows the Stations of the Cross.<ref>[http://old.usccb.org/movies/p/thepassionofthechrist.shtml Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430015224/http://old.usccb.org/movies/p/thepassionofthechrist.shtml |date=2012-04-30 }}, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, 2004</ref> The fifteenth and last station, the Resurrection, is not prominently depicted (compared to the other fourteen) but it is implied since the last shot before credit titles is Jesus resurrected and about to leave the tomb.\n\n== Debates ==\n\n=== Place of Christ's resurrection ===\nSome modern liturgists<ref>{{cite book|isbn=978-0-06-065338-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780060653385/page/1222 1222]|last=McBrien|first=Richard P.|author2=Harold W. Attridge|title=The HarperCollins encyclopedia of Catholicism|year=1995|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780060653385/page/1222}}</ref> say the traditional Stations of the Cross are incomplete without a final scene depicting the [[empty tomb]] and the [[resurrection of Jesus]] because Jesus' rising from the dead was an integral part of his salvific work on Earth. Advocates of the traditional form of the Stations ending with the body of Jesus being placed in the tomb say the Stations are intended as a meditation on the [[Atonement in Christianity|atoning]] death of Jesus, and not as a complete picture of his life, death, and resurrection. Another point of contention, at least between some ranking liturgists and traditionalists, is (the use of) the \"New Way of the Cross\" being recited exclusively in the Philippines and by Filipinos abroad.\n\nThe [[Stations of the Resurrection]] (also known by the Latin name of '''''Via Lucis''','' Way of Light) are used in some churches at [[Easter]]tide to meditate on the Resurrection and [[Ascension of Jesus Christ]].\n\n== Music ==\n[[Franz Liszt]] wrote a ''[[Via crucis (Liszt)|Via Crucis]]'' for choir, soloists and piano or organ or harmonium in 1879. In 1931, French organist [[Marcel Dupr\u00e9]] improvised and transcribed musical meditations based on fourteen poems by [[Paul Claudel]], one for each station.\n[[Peter Maxwell Davies]]'s ''Vesalii Icones'' (1969), for male dancer, solo cello and instrumental ensemble, brings together the Stations of the Cross and a series of drawings from the anatomical treatise ''De humani corporis fabrica'' (1543) by the Belgian physician Andreas van Wesel ([[Vesalius]]). In Davies's sequence, the final \"station\" represents the Resurrection, but of [[Antichrist]], the composer's moral point being the need to distinguish what is false from what is real.<ref>Composer's note in the published score (Boosey and Hawkes, B & H 20286).</ref>\n[[David Bowie]] regarded his 1976 song \"[[Station to Station (song)|Station to Station]]\" as \"very much concerned with the stations of the cross\".<ref name=Q97X>{{cite journal | last=Cavanagh | first=David | title=ChangesFiftyBowie | journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q magazine]] |date=February 1997 | pages=52\u201359}}</ref> [[Pawe\u0142_\u0141ukaszewski]] wrote ''Via Crucis'' in 2000 and it was premiered by the [[Wroc\u0142aw Opera]] on Good Friday March 30, 2018, and transmitted on [[TVP_Kultura]].
