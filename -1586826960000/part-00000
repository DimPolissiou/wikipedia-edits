Originally serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1987 to 2004, it was transferred to the monthly [[seinen|''seinen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Ultra Jump]]'' in 2005. The plot of the series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the ongoing eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 126 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of December 2019.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a vampire. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow, Akira Otoishi. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters. In 2011 near [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]], Jolyne Cujoh is arrested and sent to the Green Dolphin St. Prison for murder. Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation.

Originally serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1987 to 2004, it was transferred to the monthly [[seinen|''seinen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Ultra Jump]]'' in 2005. The plot of the series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the ongoing eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 126 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of December 2019.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a vampire. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow, Akira Otoishi. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters.

Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation. Also introduced in Part 8 is the {{nihongo|Rokakaka|\u30ed\u30ab\u30ab\u30ab|Rokakaka}} fruit, which is able to \"fix\" a body part at the expense of taking another away.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Paul Gauguin 106.jpg|thumb|Araki is inspired by western art, such as this piece by [[Paul Gauguin]] which inspired him to use unusual colors in his own art.<ref name=\"comipress\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |title=NHK\u9ad8\u6821\u8b1b\u5ea7 &#124; \u82b8\u8853\uff08\u7f8e\u8853\u2160\uff0f\u66f8\u9053\u2160\uff09 &#124; \u7b2c15\u56de \u7f8e\u8853(8) \u6f2b\u753b\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u304a\u3082\u3057\u308d\u3044 \u301c\u4eba\u7269\u301c |publisher=Nhk.or.jp |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810200320/http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |archivedate=August 10, 2014}}</ref>]]\nFor ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'', Araki wanted to use a classical method as a base and then introduce modern elements in the singular.

It describes the wide range of communication processes and problems that naturally appear within an organization or social context made up of individuals from different religious, social, ethnic, and educational backgrounds. In this sense, it seeks to understand how people from different countries and cultures act, communicate and [[perception|perceive]] the world around them <ref name=\":2\" />. \n\nMany people in intercultural business communication argue that culture determines how individuals encode messages, what medium they choose for transmitting them, and the way messages are interpreted.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|last=Lauring|first=Jakob|title=Intercultural Organizational Communication: The Social Organizing of Interaction in International Encounters|journal= Journal of Business Communication|year=2011|volume=48 |issue=3|pages=231\u201355|doi=10.1177/0021943611406500}}</ref> With regard to intercultural communication proper, it studies situations where people from different cultural backgrounds ''interact''. Aside from language, intercultural communication focuses on social attributes, thought patterns, and the cultures of different groups of people. It also involves understanding the different cultures, languages and customs of people from other countries. \n\nIntercultural communication plays a role in [[social science]]s such as [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]] and [[communication studies]]. Intercultural communication is also referred to as the base for international businesses. Several cross-cultural service providers assist with the development of intercultural communication skills.

Intercultural communication scholars approach theory with a dynamic outlook and do not believe culture can be measured nor that cultures share universal attributes. Scholars acknowledge that culture and communication shift along with societal changes and theories should consider the constant shifting and nuances of society <ref name=\":3\" />.\n\nThe study of intercultural communication requires intercultural understanding, which is an ability to understand and value cultural differences. Language is an example of an important cultural component that is linked to intercultural understanding.<ref name=\":0\">Saint-Jacques, Bernard. 2011. \u201cIntercultural Communication in a Globalized World.\u201d In Intercultural Communication: A Reader, edited by Larry A.

The system will tend to diverge toward diversity when communication is restricted.<ref>Kincaid, D. L. (1988). The convergence theory of intercultural communication. In Y. Y. Kim & W. B. Gudykunst (Eds.), Theories in intercultural communication (pp. 280\u2013298). Newbury Park, CA: Sage. p.289</ref>\n*[[Communication accommodation theory]]\n**This theory focuses on linguistic strategies to decrease or increase communicative distances.Communication accommodation theory seeks to explain and predict why, when, and how people adjust their communicative behavior during social interaction, and what social consequences result from these adjustments.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The International Encyclopedia of Interpersonal Communication|last1=Dragojevic|first1=Marko|last2=Gasiorek|first2=Jessica|last3=Giles|first3=Howard|year=2015|isbn=9781118540190|pages=1\u201321|chapter=Communication Accommodation Theory|doi=10.1002/9781118540190.wbeic006|chapter-url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/306556/files/2007_gilesogay_cat.pdf}}</ref>\n*Intercultural adaption\n**Intercultural adaptation involves learned communicative competence. Communicative competence is defined as thinking, feeling, and pragmatically behaving in ways defined as appropriate by the dominant mainstream culture. Communication competence is an outcomes based measure conceptualized as functional/operational conformity to environmental criteria such as working conditions. Beyond this, adaptation means \"the need to conform\" to mainstream \"objective reality\" and \"accepted modes of experience\".<ref name=\"Gudykunst, W. 2003\">Gudykunst, W. & Kim, Y. Y. (2003).

Co-cultural theory, as developed by Mark P. Orbe, looks at the strategic ways in which co-cultural group members communicate with others. In addition, a co-cultural framework provides an explanation for how different persons communicate based on six factors.\n\n===Identity negotiation or management===\n*[[Identity management theory]]\n*[[Identity negotiation]]\n*Cultural identity theory\n*[[Double-swing model]]\n\n=== Communication networks ===\n*Networks and outgroup communication competence\n*Intracultural versus intercultural networks\n*Networks and acculturation\n\n=== Acculturation and adjustment ===\n*Communication acculturation\n**This theory attempts to portray \"cross-cultural adaptation as a collaborative effort in which a stranger and the receiving environment are engaged in a joint effort.\"<ref>Kim Y.Y.(1995), p.192</ref>\n*Anxiety/Uncertainty management\n**When strangers communicate with hosts, they experience uncertainty and anxiety. Strangers need to manage their uncertainty as well as their anxiety in order to be able to communicate effectively with hosts and then to try to develop accurate predictions and explanations for hosts' behaviors.\n*[[Cultural assimilation|Assimilation]], [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]], and [[Social alienation|alienation]] states\n**Assimilation and adaption are not permanent outcomes of the adaption process; rather, they are temporary outcomes of the communication process between hosts and immigrants. \"Alienation or assimilation, therefore, of a group or an individual, is an outcome of the relationship between deviant behavior and neglectful communication.\"<ref>Mc.Guire and Mc.Dermott, 1988, p. 103</ref>\n*Assimilation\n** Assimilation is the process of absorbing the traits of the dominant culture to the point where the group that was assimilated becomes indistinguishable from the host culture. Assimilation can be either forced or done voluntarily depending on situations and conditions. Regardless of the situation or the condition it is very rare to see a minority group replace and or even forget their previous cultural practices.<ref name=\"Assimilation\">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/assimilation-society|title=Assimilation|last1=Pauls|first1=Elizabeth|website=www.britannica.com}}</ref>\n*Alienation\n** Alienation frequently refers to someone who is ostracized or withdrawn from other people with whom they would ordinarily be expected to associate with. Hajda, a representative theorist and researcher of social alienation says: \" alienation is an individuals feeling of uneasiness or discomfort which reflects his exclusion or self-exclusion from social and cultural participation.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Giffin|first1=Kim|year=2009|title=Social alienation by communication denial|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|volume=56|issue=4|pages=347\u2013357|doi=10.1080/00335637009383022}}</ref>\n\n=== Three perspectives on intercultural communication ===\nA study on cultural and intercultural communication came up with three perspectives, which are the indigenous approach, cultural approach, and cross-cultural approach.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Aneas|first=Maria Assumpta|last2=Sand\u00edn|first2=Mar\u00eda Paz|date=2009-01-28|title=Intercultural and Cross-Cultural Communication Research: Some Reflections about Culture and Qualitative Methods|url=http://www.qualitative-research.net/index.php/fqs/article/view/1251|journal=Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung / Forum: Qualitative Social Research|volume=10|issue=1|doi=10.17169/fqs-10.1.1251|issn=1438-5627}}</ref>\n\n* Indigenous approach: trying to understand the meaning of different cultures.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aneas|first=Maria Assumpta|last2=Sand\u00edn|first2=Mar\u00eda Paz|date=2009-01-28|title=Intercultural and Cross-Cultural Communication Research: Some Reflections about Culture and Qualitative Methods|url=http://www.qualitative-research.net/index.php/fqs/article/view/1251|journal=Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung / Forum: Qualitative Social Research|volume=10|issue=1|doi=10.17169/fqs-10.1.1251|issn=1438-5627}}</ref>\n\n* Cultural approach: is similar to the indigenous approach, however, the cultural approach also focuses on the sociocultural context of an individual.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aneas|first=Maria Assumpta|last2=Sand\u00edn|first2=Mar\u00eda Paz|date=2009-01-28|title=Intercultural and Cross-Cultural Communication Research: Some Reflections about Culture and Qualitative Methods|url=http://www.qualitative-research.net/index.php/fqs/article/view/1251|journal=Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung / Forum: Qualitative Social Research|volume=10|issue=1|doi=10.17169/fqs-10.1.1251|issn=1438-5627}}</ref>\n\n* Cross cultural approaches: focuses on two or more cultures to perceive cross-cultural validity and generalizability.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aneas|first=Maria Assumpta|last2=Sand\u00edn|first2=Mar\u00eda Paz|date=2009-01-28|title=Intercultural and Cross-Cultural Communication Research: Some Reflections about Culture and Qualitative Methods|url=http://www.qualitative-research.net/index.php/fqs/article/view/1251|journal=Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung / Forum: Qualitative Social Research|volume=10|issue=1|doi=10.17169/fqs-10.1.1251|issn=1438-5627}}</ref>\n\nWhile indigenous and cultural approaches focal point is emics, cross-cultural approaches are etics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aneas|first=Maria Assumpta|last2=Sand\u00edn|first2=Mar\u00eda Paz|date=2009-01-28|title=Intercultural and Cross-Cultural Communication Research: Some Reflections about Culture and Qualitative Methods|url=http://www.qualitative-research.net/index.php/fqs/article/view/1251|journal=Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung / Forum: Qualitative Social Research|volume=10|issue=1|doi=10.17169/fqs-10.1.1251|issn=1438-5627}}</ref>\n\n===Other theories===\n* [[Meaning of meanings theory]] \u2013 \"A misunderstanding takes place when people assume a word has a direct connection with its referent.

A theory that was found in 1984 and revisited on 1987 explains the importance of truth and intention of getting an understanding. Furthermore, if strategic intent is hidden, there can't be any authentic intercultural communication.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Christine|date=1997-02-01|title=The authenticity of intercultural communication|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147176796000120|journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=85\u2013103|doi=10.1016/S0147-1767(96)00012-0|issn=0147-1767}}</ref>\n\nIn intercultural communication, there could be miscommunication, and the term is called \"misfire.\" Later on, a theory was founded that has three layers of intercultural communication.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Christine|date=1997-02-01|title=The authenticity of intercultural communication|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147176796000120|journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=85\u2013103|doi=10.1016/S0147-1767(96)00012-0|issn=0147-1767}}</ref> The first level is effective communication, second-level miscommunication, and third-level systemically distorted communication.

Colonial policies regarding religion conversion, the removal of children, the division of community property, and the shifting of gender roles primarily impacted North and South America, Australia, Africa, and Asia. \nVoluntary assimilation has also been a part of history dating back to the Spanish Inquisition of the late 14th and 15th centuries, when many Muslims and Jews voluntarily converted to Roman Catholicism as a response to religious prosecution while secretly continuing their original practices. Another example is when the Europeans moved to the United States.<ref name=\"Assimilation\"/>\n\n== Intercultural competence ==\n\nIntercultural communication is competent when it accomplishes the objectives in a manner that is appropriate to the context and relationship. Intercultural communication thus needs to bridge the dichotomy between appropriateness and effectiveness:<ref name=\"Lustig & Koester, 2010\">(Lustig & Koester, 2010)</ref> Proper means of intercultural communication leads to a 15% decrease in miscommunication.<ref name=\"CC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/|title=Facts and Figures|publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}</ref>\n\n*'''Appropriateness:''' Valued rules, norms, and expectations of the relationship are not violated significantly.\n*'''Effectiveness:''' Valued goals or rewards (relative to costs and alternatives) are accomplished.\n\n'''Competent communication''' is an interaction that is seen as effective in achieving certain rewarding objectives in a way that is also related to the context in which the situation occurs. In other words, it is a conversation with an achievable goal that is used at an appropriate time/location.<ref name=\"Lustig & Koester, 2010\" />\n\n===Components===\n\nIntercultural communication can be linked with identity, which means the competent communicator is the person who can affirm others' avowed identities. As well as goal attainment is also a focus within intercultural competence and it involves the communicator to convey a sense of communication appropriateness and effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts.<ref name=\"Lustig & Koester, 2010\"/>\n\nEthnocentrism plays a role in intercultural communication. The capacity to avoid ethnocentrism is the foundation of intercultural communication competence. Ethnocentrism is the inclination to view one's own group as natural and correct, and all others as aberrant.\n\nPeople must be aware that to engage and fix intercultural communication there is no easy solution and there is not only one way to do so. Listed below are some of the components of intercultural competence.<ref name=\"Lustig & Koester, 2010\"/>\n\n* Context: A judgment that a person is competent is made in both a relational and situational context.This means that competence is not defined as a single attribute, meaning someone could be very strong in one section and only moderately good in another. Situationally speaking competence can be defined differently for different cultures. For example, eye contact shows competence in western cultures whereas, Asian cultures find too much eye contact disrespectful.\n* Appropriateness: This means that one's behaviours are acceptable and proper for the expectations of any given culture.\n* Effectiveness: The behaviours that lead to the desired outcome being achieved.\n* Motivations:This has to do with emotional associations as they communicate interculturally. Feelings which are one's reactions to thoughts and experiences have to do with motivation. Intentions are thoughts that guide one's choices, it is a goal or plan that directs one's behaviour. These two things play a part in motivation.<ref name=\"Lustig & Koester, 2010\"/>\n\n=== Basic tools for improvement ===\n\nThe following are ways to improve communication competence:\n* Display of interest: showing respect and positive regard for the other person.\n* Orientation to knowledge: Terms people use to explain themselves and their perception of the world.\n* Empathy:  Behaving in ways that shows one understands the point of view of others\n* Task role behaviour: initiate ideas that encourage problem solving activities.\n* Relational role behaviour: interpersonal harmony and mediation.\n* Tolerance for unknown and ambiguity: The ability to react to new situations with little discomfort.\n* Interaction posture: Responding to others in descriptive, non-judgmental ways.<ref name=\"Lustig & Koester, 2010\"/>\n* Patience<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eaglesflight.com/blog/bid/153152/Excellent-Communication-Requires-Patience|title=Excellent Communication Requires Patience|last1=Geldart|first1=Phil|website=eaglesflight}}</ref>\n* Active listening<ref name=\"linguasoftech.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.linguasoftech.com/blog/importance-of-communication-skills-at-work-place/|title=Importance of Communication Skills at Work Place|website=linguasofttech|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref>\n* Clarity<ref name=\"linguasoftech.com\"/>\n\n=== Important factors ===\n\n* Proficiency in the host culture language: understanding the grammar and vocabulary.\n* Understanding language pragmatics: how to use politeness strategies in making requests and how to avoid giving out too much information.\n* Being sensitive and aware to nonverbal communication patterns in other cultures.\n* Being aware of gestures that may be offensive or mean something different in a host culture rather than one's own culture.\n* Understanding a culture's proximity in physical space and paralinguistic sounds to convey their intended meaning.<ref name=\"Intercultural Communication\">(Intercultural Communication)</ref>\n\n=== Traits ===\n\n* Flexibility.\n* Tolerating high levels of uncertainty.\n* Self-reflection.\n* Open-mindedness.\n* Sensitivity.\n* Adaptability.\n* \"[[Thinking outside the box]]\" and [[lateral thinking]]<ref name=\"Intercultural Communication\"/>\n\nEffective communication depends on the informal understandings among the parties involved that are based on the trust developed between them. When trust exists, there is implicit understanding within communication, cultural differences may be overlooked, and problems can be dealt with more easily. The meaning of trust and how it is developed and communicated vary across societies. Similarly, some cultures have a greater propensity to be trusting than others.\n\nThe problems in intercultural communication usually come from problems in message transmission and in reception. In communication between people of the same culture, the person who receives the message interprets it based on values, beliefs, and expectations for behavior similar to those of the person who sent the message. When this happens, the way the message is interpreted by the receiver is likely to be fairly similar to what the speaker intended. However, when the receiver of the message is a person from a different culture, the receiver uses information from his or her culture to interpret the message. The message that the receiver interprets may be very different from what the speaker intended.\n\n==Areas of interest==\n=== Cross-cultural business strategies ===\nCross-cultural business communication is very helpful in building cultural intelligence through coaching and training in cross-cultural communication management and facilitation, cross-cultural negotiation, multicultural conflict resolution, customer service, business and organizational communication. Cross-cultural understanding is not just for incoming expats. Cross-cultural understanding begins with those responsible for the project and reaches those delivering the service or content.  The ability to communicate, negotiate and effectively work with people from other cultures is vital to international business.\n\n====Management====\nImportant points to consider:\n\n* Develop cultural sensitivity\n* Anticipate the meaning the receiver will get.\n* Careful encoding\n* Use words, pictures, and gestures.\n* Avoid slang, idioms, regional sayings.\n* Selective transmission\n* Build relationships, face-to-face if possible.\n* Careful decoding of feedback\n* Get feedback from multiple parties.\n* Improve listening and observation skills.\n* Follow-up actions\n\n====Facilitation====\nThere is a connection between a person's personality traits and the ability to adapt to the host-country's environment\u2014including the ability to communicate within that environment.\n\nTwo key personality traits are openness and resilience. Openness includes traits such as tolerance for ambiguity, extroversion and introversion, and open-mindedness. Resilience, on the other hand, includes having an internal locus of control, persistence, tolerance for ambiguity, and resourcefulness.\n\nThese factors, combined with the person's cultural and racial identity and level of liberalism, comprise that person's potential for adaptation.\n\n==== Miscommunication in a business setting ====\nIn a business environment, communication is vital, and there could be many instances where there could be miscommunication. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7180/c21b26db83ec4d026294c825ed9d714501fa.pdfhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7180/c21b26db83ec4d026294c825ed9d714501fa.pdf|title=The Significance of Intercultural Communication for Businesses and the Obstacles that Managers should Overcome in Achieving Effective Intercultural Communication|last=Su Kei|first=Shum|date=2015|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>Globalization is a significant factor in intercultural communication and affects business environments.

Operationalizing the perceptions of cultural identities works under the guise that cultures are static and homogeneous, when in fact cultures within nations are multi-ethnic and individuals show high variation in how cultural differences are internalized and expressed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Globalization ===\n[[Globalization]] plays a central role in theorizing for mass communication, media, and cultural communication studies.<ref>Crofts Wiley, Stephen B. 2004. \u201cRethinking Nationality in the Context of Globalization.\u201d Communication Theory 14 (1):78\u201383.</ref> Intercultural communication scholars emphasize that globalization emerged from the increasing diversity of cultures throughout the world and thrives with the removal of cultural barriers.<ref name=\":0\" /> The notion of nationality, or the construction of national space, is understood to emerge dialectically through communication and globalization.\n\nThe Intercultural Praxis Model by Kathryn Sorrells, PH.D shows us how to navigate through the complexities of cultural differences along with power differences. This model will help you understand who you are as an individual, and how you can better communicate with others that may be different from you. In order to continue living in a globalized society one can use this Praxis model to understand cultural differences (based on race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, etc.) within the institutional and historical systems of power. Intercultural Communication Praxis Model requires us to respond to someone who comes from a different culture than us, in the most open way we can. The media are influential in what we think of other cultures and what we think about our own selves. However it is important, we educate ourselves, and learn how to communicate with others through Sorrells Praxis Model.[https://www.csun.edu/sites/default/files/field_download/page/Difficult%20Dialogues%20Learning%20Activity%20-%20Kathryn%20Sorrells.pdf]\n\nSorrells\u2019 process is made up of six points of entry in navigating intercultural spaces, including inquiry, framing, positioning, dialogue, reflection, and action. Inquiry, as the first step of the Intercultural Praxis Model, is an overall interest in learning about and understanding individuals with different cultural backgrounds and world-views, while challenging one's own perceptions. Framing, then, is the awareness of \u201clocal and global contexts that shape intercultural interactions;\u201d<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Intercultural communication : globalization and social justice|last=Kathryn|first=Sorrells|isbn=978-1452292755|edition= Second|location=Los Angeles|oclc=894301747|date = 2015-09-29}}</ref> thus, the ability to shift between the micro, meso, and macro frames. Positioning is the consideration of one's place in the world compared to others, and how this position might influence both world-views and certain privileges. Dialogue is the turning point of the process during which further understanding of differences and possible tensions develops through experience and engagement with cultures outside of one's own. Next, reflection allows for one to learn through introspection the values of those differences, as well as enables action within the world \u201cin meaningful, effective, and responsible ways.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> This finally leads to action, which aims to create a more conscious world by working toward social justice and peace among different cultures. As Sorrells argues, \u201cIn the context of globalization, [intercultural praxis] \u2026 offers us a process of critical, reflective thinking and acting that enables us to navigate \u2026 intercultural spaces we inhabit interpersonally, communally, and globally.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Interdisciplinary orientation ==\nCross-cultural communication endeavours to bring together such relatively unrelated areas as [[cultural anthropology]] and established areas of communication. Its core is to establish and understand how people from different cultures communicate with each other. Its charge is to also produce some guidelines with which people from different cultures can better communicate with each other.\n\nCross-cultural communication, as with many scholarly fields, is a combination of many other fields. These fields include [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[psychology]] and communication. The field has also moved both toward the treatment of interethnic relations, and toward the study of communication strategies used by [[co-cultural populations]], i.e., communication strategies used to deal with majority or mainstream populations.\n\nThe study of languages other than one's own can serve not only to help one understand what we as humans have in common, but also to assist in the understanding of the diversity which underlines our languages' methods of constructing and organizing knowledge. Such understanding has profound implications with respect to developing a critical awareness of social relationships. Understanding social relationships and the way other cultures work is the groundwork of successful globalization business affairs.\n\nLanguage socialization can be broadly defined as \u201can investigation of how language both presupposes and creates anew, social relations in cultural context\u201d.<ref name=\"Rymes\">Rymes, (2008). Language Socialization and the Linguistic Anthropology of Education. Encyclopedia of Language and Education, 2(8, Springer)</ref> It is imperative that the speaker understands the grammar of a language, as well as how elements of language are socially situated in order to reach communicative competence. Human experience is culturally relevant, so elements of language are also culturally relevant.<ref name=\"Rymes\" />{{rp|3}}  One must carefully consider semiotics and the evaluation of sign systems to compare cross-cultural norms of communication.<ref name=\"Rymes\" />{{rp|4}} There are several potential problems that come with language socialization, however.

Verbal communication is based on language and use of expression, the tone in which the sender of the message relays the communication can determine how the message is received and in what context.\n\n'''Factors that affect verbal communication:'''\n\n* Tone of voice\n* Use of descriptive words\n* Emphasis on certain phrases\n* Volume of voice\n\nThe way a message is received is dependent on these factors as they give a greater interpretation for the receiver as to what is meant by the message. By emphasizing a certain phrase with the tone of voice, this indicates that it is important and should be focused more on.\n\nAlong with these attributes, verbal communication is also accompanied with non-verbal cues. These cues make the message clearer and give the listener an indication of what way the information should be received.<ref>Hinde, R. A. (1972). Non-verbal communication; edited by R. A. Hinde. -. Cambridge [Eng.]: University Press, 1972.</ref>\n\n'''Example of non-verbal cues'''\n\n* Facial expressions\n* Hand gestures\n* Use of objects\n* Body movement\n\nIn terms of intercultural communication there are language barriers which are effected by verbal forms of communication. In this instance there is opportunity for miscommunication between two or more parties.<ref>Esposito, A. (2007).

[et al.] (eds.). Berlin ; New York : Springer, c2007.</ref> Other barriers that contribute to miscommunication would be the type of words chosen in conversation. Due to different cultures there are different meaning in vocabulary chosen, this allows for a message between the sender and receiver to be misconstrued.<ref>Scollon, R., & Scollon, S. K. (2001). Intercultural communication : a discourse approach / Ron Scollon and Suzanne Wong Scollon. Malden, MA : Blackwell Publishers, 2001</ref>\n\n== Nonverbal communication ==\nNonverbal communication is behavior that communicates without words\u2014though it often may be accompanied by words. Minor variations in body language, speech rhythms, and punctuality often cause differing interpretations of the situation among cross-cultural parties. Kinesic behavior is communication through body movement\u2014e.g., posture, gestures, facial expressions and eye contact. The meaning of such behavior varies across countries. Clothing and the way people dress is used as a form of nonverbal communication.\n\nObject language or material culture refers to how people communicate through material artifacts\u2014e.g., architecture, office design and furniture, clothing, cars, cosmetics, and time. In monochronic cultures, time is experienced linearly and as something to be spent, saved, made up, or wasted. Time orders life, and people tend to concentrate on one thing at a time. In polychronic cultures, people tolerate many things happening simultaneously and emphasize involvement with people. In these cultures, people may be highly distractible, focus on several things at once, and change plans often.\n\nOcculesics are a form of kinesics that includes eye contact and the use of the eyes to convey messages. [[Proxemics]] concern the influence of proximity and space on communication (e.g., in terms of personal space and in terms of office layout). For example, space communicates power in the US and Germany.\n\n[[Paralanguage]] refers to how something is said, rather than the content of what is said\u2014e.g., rate of speech, tone and inflection of voice, other noises, laughing, yawning, and silence.\n\nNonverbal communication has been shown to account for between 65% and 93% of interpreted communication.<ref name=\"Samovar Larry 2006. pp13\">Samovar Larry, Porter Richard, McDaniel Edwin, Roy Carolyn. 2006. Intercultural Communication A Reader. Nonverbal Communication. pp13.</ref> Minor variations in body language, speech rhythms, and punctuality often cause mistrust and misperception of the situation among cross-cultural parties. This is where nonverbal communication can cause problems with intercultural communication. Misunderstandings with nonverbal communication can lead to miscommunication and insults with cultural differences. For example, a handshake in one culture may be recognized as appropriate, whereas another culture may recognize it as rude or inappropriate.<ref name=\"Samovar Larry 2006. pp13\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Adaptive behavior]]\n*[[Adaptive behaviors]]\n*[[Clyde Kluckhohn]]\n*[[Cultural diversity]]\n*[[Cultural intelligence]]\n*[[Cultural schema theory]]\n*[[Culture shock]]\n*[[Framing (social sciences)]]\n*[[Intercultural competence]]\n*[[Intergroup dialogue]]\n*[[Lacuna model]]\n*[[Multilingualism]]\n*[[Richard D.

It describes the wide range of communication processes and problems that naturally appear within an organization or social context made up of individuals from different religious, social, ethnic, and educational backgrounds. In this sense it seeks to understand how people from different countries and cultures act, communicate and [[perception|perceive]] the world around them. \n\nMany people in intercultural business communication argue that culture determines how individuals encode messages, what medium they choose for transmitting them, and the way messages are interpreted.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lauring|first=Jakob|title=Intercultural Organizational Communication: The Social Organizing of Interaction in International Encounters|journal= Journal of Business Communication|year=2011|volume=48 |issue=3|pages=231\u201355|doi=10.1177/0021943611406500}}</ref> With regard to intercultural communication proper, it studies situations where people from different cultural backgrounds ''interact''. Aside from language, intercultural communication focuses on social attributes, thought patterns, and the cultures of different groups of people. It also involves understanding the different cultures, languages and customs of people from other countries. \n\nIntercultural communication plays a role in [[social science]]s such as [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]] and [[communication studies]]. Intercultural communication is also referred to as the base for international businesses. Several cross-cultural service providers assist with the development of intercultural communication skills.

Intercultural communication scholars approach theory with a dynamic outlook and do not believe culture can be measured nor that cultures share universal attributes. Scholars acknowledge that culture and communication shift along with societal changes and theories should consider the constant shifting and nuances of society.\n\nThe study of intercultural communication requires intercultural understanding, which is an ability to understand and value cultural differences. Language is an example of an important cultural component that is linked to intercultural understanding.<ref name=\":0\">Saint-Jacques, Bernard. 2011. \u201cIntercultural Communication in a Globalized World.\u201d In Intercultural Communication: A Reader, edited by Larry A.

Communicative competence is defined as thinking, feeling, and pragmatically behaving in ways defined as appropriate by the dominant mainstream culture.

Beyond this, adaptation means \"the need to conform\" to mainstream \"objective reality\" and \"accepted modes of experience\".<ref name=\"Gudykunst, W. 2003\">Gudykunst, W. & Kim, Y. Y. (2003).

Colonial policies regarding religion conversion, the removal of children, the division of community property, and the shifting of gender roles primarily impacted North and South America, Australia, Africa, and Asia. \nVoluntary assimilation has also been a part of history dating back to the Spanish Inquisition of the late 14th and 15th centuries, when many Muslims and Jews voluntarily converted to Roman Catholicism as a response to religious prosecution while secretly continuing their original practices. Another example is when the Europeans moved to the United States.<ref name=\"Assimilation\"/>\n\n== Intercultural competence ==\n\nIntercultural communication is competent when it accomplishes the objectives in a manner that is appropriate to the context and relationship. Intercultural communication thus needs to bridge the dichotomy between appropriateness and effectiveness:<ref name=\"Lustig & Koester, 2010\">(Lustig & Koester, 2010)</ref> Proper means of intercultural communication leads to a 15% decrease in miscommunication.<ref name=\"CC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/|title=Facts and Figures|publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}</ref>\n\n*'''Appropriateness:''' Valued rules, norms, and expectations of the relationship are not violated significantly.\n*'''Effectiveness:''' Valued goals or rewards (relative to costs and alternatives) are accomplished.\n\n'''Competent communication''' is an interaction that is seen as effective in achieving certain rewarding objectives in a way that is also related to the context in which the situation occurs. In other words, it is a conversation with an achievable goal that is used at an appropriate time/location.<ref name=\"Lustig & Koester, 2010\" />\n\n===Components===\n\nIntercultural communication can be linked with identity, which means the competent communicator is the person who can affirm others' avowed identities. As well as goal attainment is also a focus within intercultural competence and it involves the communicator to convey a sense of communication appropriateness and effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts.<ref name=\"Lustig & Koester, 2010\"/>\n\nEthnocentrism plays a role in intercultural communication. The capacity to avoid ethnocentrism is the foundation of intercultural communication competence. Ethnocentrism is the inclination to view one's own group as natural and correct, and all others as aberrant.\n\nPeople must be aware that to engage and fix intercultural communication there is no easy solution and there is not only one way to do so. Listed below are some of the components of intercultural competence.<ref name=\"Lustig & Koester, 2010\"/>\n\n* Context: A judgment that a person is competent is made in both a relational and situational context.This means that competence is not defined as a single attribute, meaning someone could be very strong in one section and only moderately good in another. Situationally speaking competence can be defined differently for different cultures. For example, eye contact shows competence in western cultures whereas, Asian cultures find too much eye contact disrespectful.\n* Appropriateness: This means that one's behaviours are acceptable and proper for the expectations of any given culture.\n* Effectiveness: The behaviours that lead to the desired outcome being achieved.\n* Motivations:This has to do with emotional associations as they communicate interculturally. Feelings which are one's reactions to thoughts and experiences have to do with motivation. Intentions are thoughts that guide one's choices, it is a goal or plan that directs one's behaviour. These two things play a part in motivation.<ref name=\"Lustig & Koester, 2010\"/>\n\n=== Basic tools for improvement ===\n\nThe following are ways to improve communication competence:\n* Display of interest: showing respect and positive regard for the other person.\n* Orientation to knowledge: Terms people use to explain themselves and their perception of the world.\n* Empathy:  Behaving in ways that shows one understands the point of view of others\n* Task role behaviour: initiate ideas that encourage problem solving activities.\n* Relational role behaviour: interpersonal harmony and mediation.\n* Tolerance for unknown and ambiguity: The ability to react to new situations with little discomfort.\n* Interaction posture: Responding to others in descriptive, non-judgmental ways.<ref name=\"Lustig & Koester, 2010\"/>\n* Patience<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eaglesflight.com/blog/bid/153152/Excellent-Communication-Requires-Patience|title=Excellent Communication Requires Patience|last1=Geldart|first1=Phil|website=eaglesflight}}</ref>\n* Active listening<ref name=\"linguasoftech.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.linguasoftech.com/blog/importance-of-communication-skills-at-work-place/|title=Importance of Communication Skills at Work Place|website=linguasofttech|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref>\n* Clarity<ref name=\"linguasoftech.com\"/>\n\n=== Important factors ===\n\n* Proficiency in the host culture language: understanding the grammar and vocabulary.\n* Understanding language pragmatics: how to use politeness strategies in making requests and how to avoid giving out too much information.\n* Being sensitive and aware to nonverbal communication patterns in other cultures.\n* Being aware of gestures that may be offensive or mean something different in a host culture rather than one's own culture.\n* Understanding a culture's proximity in physical space and paralinguistic sounds to convey their intended meaning.<ref name=\"Intercultural Communication\">(Intercultural Communication)</ref>\n\n=== Traits ===\n\n* Flexibility.\n* Tolerating high levels of uncertainty.\n* Self-reflection.\n* Open-mindedness.\n* Sensitivity.\n* Adaptability.\n* \"[[Thinking outside the box]]\" and [[lateral thinking]]<ref name=\"Intercultural Communication\"/>\n\nEffective communication depends on the informal understandings among the parties involved that are based on the trust developed between them. When trust exists, there is implicit understanding within communication, cultural differences may be overlooked, and problems can be dealt with more easily. The meaning of trust and how it is developed and communicated vary across societies. Similarly, some cultures have a greater propensity to be trusting than others.\n\nThe problems in intercultural communication usually come from problems in message transmission and in reception. In communication between people of the same culture, the person who receives the message interprets it based on values, beliefs, and expectations for behavior similar to those of the person who sent the message. When this happens, the way the message is interpreted by the receiver is likely to be fairly similar to what the speaker intended. However, when the receiver of the message is a person from a different culture, the receiver uses information from his or her culture to interpret the message. The message that the receiver interprets may be very different from what the speaker intended.\n\n==Areas of interest==\n=== Cross-cultural business strategies ===\nCross-cultural business communication is very helpful in building cultural intelligence through coaching and training in cross-cultural communication management and facilitation, cross-cultural negotiation, multicultural conflict resolution, customer service, business and organizational communication. Cross-cultural understanding is not just for incoming expats. Cross-cultural understanding begins with those responsible for the project and reaches those delivering the service or content.  The ability to communicate, negotiate and effectively work with people from other cultures is vital to international business.\n\n====Management====\nImportant points to consider:\n\n* Develop cultural sensitivity\n* Anticipate the meaning the receiver will get.\n* Careful encoding\n* Use words, pictures, and gestures.\n* Avoid slang, idioms, regional sayings.\n* Selective transmission\n* Build relationships, face-to-face if possible.\n* Careful decoding of feedback\n* Get feedback from multiple parties.\n* Improve listening and observation skills.\n* Follow-up actions\n\n====Facilitation====\nThere is a connection between a person's personality traits and the ability to adapt to the host-country's environment\u2014including the ability to communicate within that environment.\n\nTwo key personality traits are openness and resilience. Openness includes traits such as tolerance for ambiguity, extroversion and introversion, and open-mindedness. Resilience, on the other hand, includes having an internal locus of control, persistence, tolerance for ambiguity, and resourcefulness.\n\nThese factors, combined with the person's cultural and racial identity and level of liberalism, comprise that person's potential for adaptation.\n\n==== Miscommunication in a business setting ====\nIn a business environment, communication is vital, and there could be many instances where there could be miscommunication. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7180/c21b26db83ec4d026294c825ed9d714501fa.pdfhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7180/c21b26db83ec4d026294c825ed9d714501fa.pdf|title=The Significance of Intercultural Communication for Businesses and the Obstacles that Managers should Overcome in Achieving Effective Intercultural Communication|last=Su Kei|first=Shum|date=2015|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>Globalization is a significant factor in intercultural communication and affects business environments.

Operationalizing the perceptions of cultural identities works under the guise that cultures are static and homogeneous, when in fact cultures within nations are multi-ethnic and individuals show high variation in how cultural differences are internalized and expressed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Globalization ===\n[[Globalization]] plays a central role in theorizing for mass communication, media, and cultural communication studies.<ref>Crofts Wiley, Stephen B. 2004. \u201cRethinking Nationality in the Context of Globalization.\u201d Communication Theory 14 (1):78\u201383.</ref> Intercultural communication scholars emphasize that globalization emerged from the increasing diversity of cultures throughout the world and thrives with the removal of cultural barriers.<ref name=\":0\" /> The notion of nationality, or the construction of national space, is understood to emerge dialectically through communication and globalization.\n\nThe Intercultural Praxis Model by Kathryn Sorrells, PH.D shows us how to navigate through the complexities of cultural differences along with power differences. This model will help you understand who you are as an individual, and how you can better communicate with others that may be different from you. In order to continue living in a globalized society one can use this Praxis model to understand cultural differences (based on race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, etc.) within the institutional and historical systems of power. Intercultural Communication Praxis Model requires us to respond to someone who comes from a different culture than us, in the most open way we can. The media are influential in what we think of other cultures and what we think about our own selves. However it is important, we educate ourselves, and learn how to communicate with others through Sorrells Praxis Model.[https://www.csun.edu/sites/default/files/field_download/page/Difficult%20Dialogues%20Learning%20Activity%20-%20Kathryn%20Sorrells.pdf]\n\nSorrells\u2019 process is made up of six points of entry in navigating intercultural spaces, including inquiry, framing, positioning, dialogue, reflection, and action. Inquiry, as the first step of the Intercultural Praxis Model, is an overall interest in learning about and understanding individuals with different cultural backgrounds and world-views, while challenging one's own perceptions. Framing, then, is the awareness of \u201clocal and global contexts that shape intercultural interactions;\u201d<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Intercultural communication : globalization and social justice|last=Kathryn|first=Sorrells|isbn=978-1452292755|edition= Second|location=Los Angeles|oclc=894301747|date = 2015-09-29}}</ref> thus, the ability to shift between the micro, meso, and macro frames. Positioning is the consideration of one's place in the world compared to others, and how this position might influence both world-views and certain privileges. Dialogue is the turning point of the process during which further understanding of differences and possible tensions develops through experience and engagement with cultures outside of one's own. Next, reflection allows for one to learn through introspection the values of those differences, as well as enables action within the world \u201cin meaningful, effective, and responsible ways.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> This finally leads to action, which aims to create a more conscious world by working toward social justice and peace among different cultures. As Sorrells argues, \u201cIn the context of globalization, [intercultural praxis] \u2026 offers us a process of critical, reflective thinking and acting that enables us to navigate \u2026 intercultural spaces we inhabit interpersonally, communally, and globally.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Interdisciplinary orientation ==\nCross-cultural communication endeavours to bring together such relatively unrelated areas as [[cultural anthropology]] and established areas of communication. Its core is to establish and understand how people from different cultures communicate with each other. Its charge is to also produce some guidelines with which people from different cultures can better communicate with each other.\n\nCross-cultural communication, as with many scholarly fields, is a combination of many other fields. These fields include [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[psychology]] and communication. The field has also moved both toward the treatment of interethnic relations, and toward the study of communication strategies used by [[co-cultural populations]], i.e., communication strategies used to deal with majority or mainstream populations.\n\nThe study of languages other than one's own can serve not only to help one understand what we as humans have in common, but also to assist in the understanding of the diversity which underlines our languages' methods of constructing and organizing knowledge. Such understanding has profound implications with respect to developing a critical awareness of social relationships. Understanding social relationships and the way other cultures work is the groundwork of successful globalization business affairs.\n\nLanguage socialization can be broadly defined as \u201can investigation of how language both presupposes and creates anew, social relations in cultural context\u201d.<ref name=\"Rymes\">Rymes, (2008). Language Socialization and the Linguistic Anthropology of Education. Encyclopedia of Language and Education, 2(8, Springer)</ref> It is imperative that the speaker understands the grammar of a language, as well as how elements of language are socially situated in order to reach communicative competence. Human experience is culturally relevant, so elements of language are also culturally relevant.<ref name=\"Rymes\" />{{rp|3}}  One must carefully consider semiotics and the evaluation of sign systems to compare cross-cultural norms of communication.<ref name=\"Rymes\" />{{rp|4}} There are several potential problems that come with language socialization, however. Sometimes people can over-generalize or label cultures with stereotypical and subjective characterizations.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Handford|first=Michael|year=2019|title=Which \"culture\"? A critical analysis of intercultural communication in engineering education|journal=Journal of Engineering Education|volume=108|issue=2|pages=161\u2013177|doi=10.1002/jee.20254}}</ref> Another primary concern with documenting alternative cultural norms revolves around the fact that no social actor uses language in ways that perfectly match normative characterizations.<ref name=\"Rymes\" />{{rp|8}} A methodology for investigating how an individual uses language and other semiotic activity to create and use new models of conduct and how this varies from the cultural norm should be incorporated into the study of language socialization.<ref name=\"Rymes\" />{{rp|11,12}}\n\n== Verbal communication ==\nVerbal communication consist of messages being sent and received continuously with the speaker and the listener, it is focused on the way messages are portrayed. Verbal communication is based on language and use of expression, the tone in which the sender of the message relays the communication can determine how the message is received and in what context.\n\n'''Factors that affect verbal communication:'''\n\n* Tone of voice\n* Use of descriptive words\n* Emphasis on certain phrases\n* Volume of voice\n\nThe way a message is received is dependent on these factors as they give a greater interpretation for the receiver as to what is meant by the message. By emphasizing a certain phrase with the tone of voice, this indicates that it is important and should be focused more on.\n\nAlong with these attributes, verbal communication is also accompanied with non-verbal cues. These cues make the message clearer and give the listener an indication of what way the information should be received.<ref>Hinde, R. A. (1972). Non-verbal communication; edited by R. A. Hinde. -. Cambridge [Eng.]: University Press, 1972.</ref>\n\n'''Example of non-verbal cues'''\n\n* Facial expressions\n* Hand gestures\n* Use of objects\n* Body movement\n\nIn terms of intercultural communication there are language barriers which are effected by verbal forms of communication. In this instance there is opportunity for miscommunication between two or more parties.<ref>Esposito, A. (2007). Verbal and nonverbal communication behaviours [electronic resource] : COST Action 2102 International Workshop, Vietri sul Mare, Italy, March 29\u201331, 2007 : revised selected and invited papers / Anna Esposito ... [et al.] (eds.). Berlin ; New York : Springer, c2007.</ref> Other barriers that contribute to miscommunication would be the type of words chosen in conversation. Due to different cultures there are different meaning in vocabulary chosen, this allows for a message between the sender and receiver to be misconstrued.<ref>Scollon, R., & Scollon, S. K. (2001). Intercultural communication : a discourse approach / Ron Scollon and Suzanne Wong Scollon. Malden, MA : Blackwell Publishers, 2001</ref>\n\n== Nonverbal communication ==\nNonverbal communication is behavior that communicates without words\u2014though it often may be accompanied by words. Minor variations in body language, speech rhythms, and punctuality often cause differing interpretations of the situation among cross-cultural parties. Kinesic behavior is communication through body movement\u2014e.g., posture, gestures, facial expressions and eye contact. The meaning of such behavior varies across countries. Clothing and the way people dress is used as a form of nonverbal communication.\n\nObject language or material culture refers to how people communicate through material artifacts\u2014e.g., architecture, office design and furniture, clothing, cars, cosmetics, and time. In monochronic cultures, time is experienced linearly and as something to be spent, saved, made up, or wasted. Time orders life, and people tend to concentrate on one thing at a time. In polychronic cultures, people tolerate many things happening simultaneously and emphasize involvement with people. In these cultures, people may be highly distractible, focus on several things at once, and change plans often.\n\nOcculesics are a form of kinesics that includes eye contact and the use of the eyes to convey messages. [[Proxemics]] concern the influence of proximity and space on communication (e.g., in terms of personal space and in terms of office layout). For example, space communicates power in the US and Germany.\n\n[[Paralanguage]] refers to how something is said, rather than the content of what is said\u2014e.g., rate of speech, tone and inflection of voice, other noises, laughing, yawning, and silence.\n\nNonverbal communication has been shown to account for between 65% and 93% of interpreted communication.<ref name=\"Samovar Larry 2006. pp13\">Samovar Larry, Porter Richard, McDaniel Edwin, Roy Carolyn. 2006. Intercultural Communication A Reader. Nonverbal Communication. pp13.</ref> Minor variations in body language, speech rhythms, and punctuality often cause mistrust and misperception of the situation among cross-cultural parties. This is where nonverbal communication can cause problems with intercultural communication. Misunderstandings with nonverbal communication can lead to miscommunication and insults with cultural differences. For example, a handshake in one culture may be recognized as appropriate, whereas another culture may recognize it as rude or inappropriate.<ref name=\"Samovar Larry 2006. pp13\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Adaptive behavior]]\n*[[Adaptive behaviors]]\n*[[Clyde Kluckhohn]]\n*[[Cultural diversity]]\n*[[Cultural intelligence]]\n*[[Cultural schema theory]]\n*[[Culture shock]]\n*[[Framing (social sciences)]]\n*[[Intercultural competence]]\n*[[Intergroup dialogue]]\n*[[Lacuna model]]\n*[[Multilingualism]]\n*[[Richard D.

It is also the terminus for the [[Tenry\u016b Hamanako Railroad Tenry\u016b Hamanako Line]] and is located 67.7 kilometers from the opposing terminus at [[Shinjohara Station]].\n\n==Layout==\nJR Kakegawa Station has five platforms serving eight tracks. The T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line Track 1 is served by a [[side platform]] connected to the main station building's north exit and the Tenry\u016b Hamanako Line station.

It is {{convert|20|mi}} west across the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]] to [[Silverthorne, Colorado|Silverthorne]] and {{convert|46|mi}} east to [[Denver]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town of Silver Plume has a total area of 0.2&nbsp;square miles (0.6&nbsp;km\u00b2), all of it land.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}\nThe town of Silver Plume has a very rich history. That history can be viewed by the general public either at the George Rowe Museum, which is in the original school house of the town, or by walking the 7:30 Mine Trail, which gives the individual a grand view of the Silver Plume valley and the town nestled at its base.\n\nMany tales circulate about the town. One involves its naming. According to records and legends, Louis Dupuy, the owner of the Hotel De Paris, was also a newspaper editor for the town. When miners from Silver Plume brought him samples of the town's ore and asked him what they should name the small camp, he allegedly wrote a short poem on the spot:\n\nKnights today are miners bold,<br />\nWho delve in deep mines' gloom,<br />\nTo honor men who dig for gold,<br />\nFor ladies whom their arms enfold,<br />\nWe'll name the town Silver Plume!\n\nMany other legends abound about the small \"Living Ghost Town\". One involves a much-beloved citizen from the mining days, Clifford Griffin. According to legend, Mr. Griffin came from the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], where he was raised. Griffin became engaged in New York, but his fianc\u00e9 tragically, and mysteriously, died the night before their wedding. Her death was contributed to unnameable \"natural causes\", and to escape the painful memories of his beloved, he moved to Colorado with his brother, who eventually became the owner of the 7:30 Mine (so named because their day shift started a generous hour later than the other mines, who started at 6:30 AM). Clifford became the manager of the 7:30, and was much loved by his miners for his kindness. According to local legend, every Christmas he bought all his miners a goose for their families, and every Fourth of July, he paid off every bar between Silver Plume and current-day Bakerville {{convert|4|mi|0}} to the west, so his miners could enjoy their holiday without spending their family's money. Not only did he take care of his miners, every evening he provided them with entertainment as well. Since he could not bear the daily sight of his men with their wives and families after his tragedy, he spent a great deal of time near the entrance to the 7:30, which sits about {{convert|1500|ft}} above the town of Silver Plume. Every evening he would sit near the edge of a nearby cliff and play his violin. Due to the incredible acoustics of the valley, the entire town could step outside and listen to his concerts. According to local legend, one evening, after a particularly beautiful recital, the residents heard a gunshot. Assuming the worst, the miners of the 7:30 raced up the trail to the entrance, and there they found Clifford Griffin, shot through the heart, in a grave he'd dug himself. A note in the nearby Manager's Office told the tale. It asked the residents of Silver Plume to leave him where he lay, because that's where he'd experienced the most happiness since his wife died. Not only did they follow his request, the town erected a 10-foot-tall Gunnison Granite monument in his honor, directly on top of his grave site. The monument can still be seen today, on the cliffs directly in front of the 7:30 Mine.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1890= 908\n|1900= 775\n|1910= 460\n|1920= 272\n|1930= 126\n|1940= 139\n|1950= 136\n|1960= 86\n|1970= 164\n|1980= 140\n|1990= 134\n|2000= 203\n|2010= 170\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=176\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=March 21, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2000, there were 203 people, 93 households, and 47 families residing in the town.

The federally designated [[Georgetown-Silver Plume Historic District]] comprises Silver Plume, the neighboring town of [[Georgetown, Colorado|Georgetown]], and the [[Georgetown Loop Railroad|Georgetown Loop Historic Mining & Railroad Park]] between the two towns.\n\nThe town population was 170 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US0870360| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212175254/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US0870360| url-status=dead| archive-date=February 12, 2020| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Silver Plume town, Colorado| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=June 23, 2014}}</ref> The Silver Plume [[United States Postal Service|Post Office]] has the [[ZIP code]] 80476.<ref name=ZIPcode>{{cite web | date = May 25, 2007 | url = http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/citytown.jsp | title = ZIP Code Lookup| format = [[JavaScript]]/[[HTML]] | publisher = United States Postal Service | accessdate = 2007-05-25}}</</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nSilver Plume is located in the valley of [[Clear Creek (Colorado)|Clear Creek]] at {{Coord|39|41|45|N|105|43|34|W|type:city}} (39.695919, -105.726066).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> [[Interstate 70 in Colorado|Interstate 70]] and [[U.S. Route 6 in Colorado|U.S. Route 6]] pass through the town, with access from Exit 226. It is {{convert|20|mi}} west across the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]] to [[Silverthorne, Colorado|Silverthorne]] and {{convert|46|mi}} east to [[Denver]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town of Silver Plume has a total area of 0.2&nbsp;square miles (0.6&nbsp;km\u00b2), all of it land.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}\nThe town of Silver Plume has a very rich history. That history can be viewed by the general public either at the George Rowe Museum, which is in the original school house of the town, or by walking the 7:30 Mine Trail, which gives the individual a grand view of the Silver Plume valley and the town nestled at its base.\n\nMany tales circulate about the town. One involves its naming. According to records and legends, Louis Dupuy, the owner of the Hotel De Paris, was also a newspaper editor for the town. When miners from Silver Plume brought him samples of the town's ore and asked him what they should name the small camp, he allegedly wrote a short poem on the spot:\n\nKnights today are miners bold,<br />\nWho delve in deep mines' gloom,<br />\nTo honor men who dig for gold,<br />\nFor ladies whom their arms enfold,<br />\nWe'll name the town Silver Plume!\n\nMany other legends abound about the small \"Living Ghost Town\". One involves a much-beloved citizen from the mining days, Clifford Griffin. According to legend, Mr. Griffin came from the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], where he was raised. Griffin became engaged in New York, but his fianc\u00e9 tragically, and mysteriously, died the night before their wedding. Her death was contributed to unnameable \"natural causes\", and to escape the painful memories of his beloved, he moved to Colorado with his brother, who eventually became the owner of the 7:30 Mine (so named because their day shift started a generous hour later than the other mines, who started at 6:30 AM). Clifford became the manager of the 7:30, and was much loved by his miners for his kindness. According to local legend, every Christmas he bought all his miners a goose for their families, and every Fourth of July, he paid off every bar between Silver Plume and current-day Bakerville {{convert|4|mi|0}} to the west, so his miners could enjoy their holiday without spending their family's money. Not only did he take care of his miners, every evening he provided them with entertainment as well. Since he could not bear the daily sight of his men with their wives and families after his tragedy, he spent a great deal of time near the entrance to the 7:30, which sits about {{convert|1500|ft}} above the town of Silver Plume. Every evening he would sit near the edge of a nearby cliff and play his violin. Due to the incredible acoustics of the valley, the entire town could step outside and listen to his concerts. According to local legend, one evening, after a particularly beautiful recital, the residents heard a gunshot. Assuming the worst, the miners of the 7:30 raced up the trail to the entrance, and there they found Clifford Griffin, shot through the heart, in a grave he'd dug himself. A note in the nearby Manager's Office told the tale. It asked the residents of Silver Plume to leave him where he lay, because that's where he'd experienced the most happiness since his wife died. Not only did they follow his request, the town erected a 10-foot-tall Gunnison Granite monument in his honor, directly on top of his grave site. The monument can still be seen today, on the cliffs directly in front of the 7:30 Mine.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1890= 908\n|1900= 775\n|1910= 460\n|1920= 272\n|1930= 126\n|1940= 139\n|1950= 136\n|1960= 86\n|1970= 164\n|1980= 140\n|1990= 134\n|2000= 203\n|2010= 170\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=176\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=March 21, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2000, there were 203 people, 93 households, and 47 families residing in the town.
