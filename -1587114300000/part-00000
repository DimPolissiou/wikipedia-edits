In either type, light is focused on the anterior surface of the patient's cornea and reflected back to a [[digital camera]] at the device. The topology of the cornea is revealed by the shape taken by the reflected pattern. A computer provides the necessary analysis, typically determining the position and height of several thousand points across the cornea. The [[topographical map]] can be represented in a number of graphical formats, such as a ''sagittal map'', which color-codes the steepness of curvature according to its [[dioptre|dioptric value]].\n\n== Development ==\n[[Image:Computerised Corneal Topography.jpg|thumb|left|A Medmont E300 topographer]]\n\nThe corneal topograph owes its heritage to the Portuguese ophthalmologist [[Antonio Placido]], who, in 1880, viewed a painted disk (''Placido's disk'') of alternating black and white rings reflected in the cornea.<ref name=goss>{{cite journal| vauthors= Goss D, Gerstman D| title= The Optical Science Underlying the Quantification of Corneal Contour| journal= Indiana Journal of Optometry| year= 2000| volume= 3| issue= 1| url= http://www.opt.indiana.edu/IndJOpt/ijosum00.pdf| access-date= 2006-04-01| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060506020541/http://www.opt.indiana.edu/IndJOpt/ijosum00.pdf| archive-date= 2006-05-06| url-status= dead}}</ref> The rings showed as [[contour line]]s projected on the corneal tear film.
