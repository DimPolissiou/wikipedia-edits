He is also a contributing member to the band The Light Footwork. Thao Nguyen and Willis Thompson met Adam Thompson (no relation) during a show at the Harrison Street Coffee Shop in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. At the time, Adam Thompson was performing as a solo jazz-influenced act under the moniker The OK Bird.  Frank Stewart, member of the bands Durian and Verbal, would produce the first album ''[[Like the Linen]]'' in 2005 and join the band as a lead guitarist. Although only Willis and Nguyen initially performed live on tour, the four members began touring as a group during the [[Kill Rock Stars]]' Sound the Hare Heard tour during the summer of 2006.  The name of the band was originally suggested by a former bassist of the band.  Nguyen would expand the initial suggestion of \"The Get Down\" to \"The Get Down Stay Down\". Thao Nguyen still occasionally performs as a soloist, including a European tour with [[Laura Veirs]] and the Tortured Souls in August 2006.\n\nAfter sending ''Like the Linen'' to Laura Veirs, Thao was able to get connected to [[Tucker Martine]], Veirs' drummer and producer for [[The Decemberists]] and [[Sufjan Stevens]]. In August 2006, the group began recording with Martine in Seattle and released the album, ''[[We Brave Bee Stings and All]]'', in January 2008. Thao Nguyen has since moved to [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. The band toured in 2008 with [[Xiu Xiu]], and separately with [[Rilo Kiley]] before heading out on their first headlining tour that summer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Katzif |first=Mike |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94282059 |title=Thao Nguyen: Tiny Desk Concert |website=Npr.org |date= |accessdate=2016-06-04}}</ref>\n\nThao & the Get Down Stay Down released their second album, ''[[Know Better Learn Faster]]'', on October 13, 2009.

Archaeological finds date back to the [[Neolithic]] period, and documents first mention the city in the early second millennium BC. Palmyra changed hands on a number of occasions between different empires before becoming a subject of the [[Roman Empire]] in the first century AD.\n\nThe city grew wealthy from trade [[Caravan (travellers)|caravans]]; the Palmyrenes became renowned as merchants who established colonies along the [[Silk Road]] and operated throughout the Roman Empire. Palmyra's wealth enabled the construction of monumental projects, such as the [[Great Colonnade at Palmyra|Great Colonnade]], the [[Temple of Bel]], and the distinctive tower tombs. Ethnically, the Palmyrenes combined elements of [[Amorites]], [[Arameans]], and [[Arabs]]. The city's social structure was tribal, and its inhabitants spoke [[Palmyrene dialect|Palmyrene]] (a dialect of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]), while using [[Greek language|Greek]] for commercial and diplomatic purposes. [[Greco-Roman world#Culture|Greco-Roman culture]] influenced the [[Culture of Syria|culture]] of Palmyra, which produced distinctive art and architecture that combined eastern and western traditions. The city's inhabitants worshiped [[Canaanite religion|local Semitic deities]], [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian]] and [[Arabian mythology|Arab gods]].\n\nBy the third century AD Palmyra had become a prosperous regional center. It reached the apex of its power in the 260s, when the Palmyrene King [[Odaenathus]] defeated [[Sasanian Empire|Persian]] Emperor [[Shapur I]]. The king was succeeded by [[regent]] Queen [[Zenobia]], who rebelled against Rome and established the [[Palmyrene Empire]]. In 273, Roman emperor [[Aurelian]] destroyed the city, which was later restored by [[Diocletian]] at a reduced size. The Palmyrenes converted to [[Christianity]] during the fourth century and to [[Islam]] in the centuries following the conquest by the 7th-century [[Rashidun Caliphate]], after which the Palmyrene and Greek languages were replaced by [[Arabic]].\n\nBefore AD 273, Palmyra enjoyed autonomy and was attached to the Roman [[Syria (Roman province)|province of Syria]], having its political organization influenced by the [[Polis|Greek city-state]] model during the first two centuries AD. The city became a [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman colonia]] during the third century, leading to the incorporation of Roman governing institutions, before becoming a monarchy in 260. Following its destruction in 273, Palmyra became a minor center under the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and later empires. Its destruction by the [[Timurid Empire|Timurids]] in 1400 reduced it to a small village. Under [[French Mandate of Syria|French Mandatory]] rule in 1932, the inhabitants were moved into the new village of [[Tadmur]], and the ancient site became available for excavations. During the [[Syrian Civil War]] in 2015, the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) destroyed large parts of the ancient city, which was recaptured by the [[Syrian Army]] on 2 March 2017.\n\n==Etymology==\nRecords of the name \"Tadmor\" date from the early second millennium BC;{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA238 238]}} eighteenth century BC tablets from [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] written in [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] record the name as \"Ta-ad-mi-ir\", while Assyrian inscriptions of the eleventh century BC record it as \"Ta-ad-mar\".{{sfn|Limet|1977|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=-5o3AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA104 104]}} Aramaic Palmyrene inscriptions themselves showed two variants of the name; ''TDMR'' (''i.e.'', Tadmar) and ''TDMWR'' (''i.e.'', Tadmor).{{sfn|Buben\u00edk|1989|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=DT98F5CFtQsC&pg=PA229 229]}}{{sfn|Wolfensohn|2016|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=m2WSDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT118 118]}} The etymology of the name is unclear; the standard interpretation, supported by [[Albert Schultens]], connects it to the Semitic word for \"[[Date palm#Dates|date palm]]\", ''tamar'' ({{Hebrew|[[:wikt:\u05ea\u05de\u05e8|\u05ea\u05de\u05e8]]}}),{{#tag:ref|The Semitic word T.M.R is the common root for the words that designate palm

445]}}<br />Schultens argued that in the Bible (1 Kings 9:18), the name is written \"Tamor\" in the text and \"Tadmor\" in the margin.{{sfn|Ibn \u0160add\u0101d|1732|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=FCgVAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA3-PT79&lpg=RA3-PT79 79]}} Schultens considered \"Tamor\" to be the original name and derived from \"Tamar\".{{sfn|Charnock|1859|p= [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_I2BulY4WvsYC/page/n210 200]}} However, the inclusion of a -''d''- in \"Tamar\" cannot be explained.{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p=

[https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA235 235]}}\n\nThe Greek name {{lang|grc|\u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1}} (Latinized ''Palmyra'') was first recorded by [[Pliny the Elder]] in the 1st century AD.{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA248 248]}} It was used throughout the [[Greco-Roman]] world.{{sfn|Charnock|1859|p= [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_I2BulY4WvsYC/page/n210 200]}} It is generally believed that \"Palmyra\" derives from \"Tadmor\" and linguists have presented two possibilities; one view holds that Palmyra was an alteration of Tadmor.{{sfn|Charnock|1859|p= [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_I2BulY4WvsYC/page/n210 200]}} According to the suggestion by Schultens, \"Palmyra\" could have arisen as a corruption of \"Tadmor\", via an unattested form \"Talmura\", changed to \"Palmura\" by the influence of the Latin word ''[[:wikt:palma|palma]]'' (date \"[[Arecaceae|palm]]\"),{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA238 238]}} in reference to the city's palm trees, then the name reached its final form \"Palmyra\".{{sfn|Charnock|1859|p= [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_I2BulY4WvsYC/page/n211 201]}} The second view, supported by some philologists, such as [[Jean Starcky]], holds that Palmyra is a translation of \"Tadmor\" (assuming that it meant palm), which had derived from the Greek word for palm, \"''palame''\".{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA238 238]}}{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA235 235]}}\n\nAn alternative suggestion connects the name to the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ''tedmurt\u0101'' (\u072c\u0715\u0721\u0718\u072a\u072c\u0710) \"miracle\", hence ''tedmurt\u0101'' \"object of wonder\", from the root ''dmr'' \"to wonder\"; this possibility was mentioned favourably by [[Franz Altheim]] and Ruth Altheim-Stiehl (1973), but rejected by Jean Starcky (1960) and Michael Gawlikowski (1974).{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA248 248]}} [[Michael Patrick O'Connor]] (1988) suggested that the names \"Palmyra\" and \"Tadmor\" originated in the [[Hurrian language]].{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA238 238]}} As evidence, he cited the inexplicability of alterations to the theorized roots of both names (represented in the addition of ''-d-'' to ''tamar'' and ''-ra-'' to ''palame'').{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA235 235]}} According to this theory, \"Tadmor\" derives from the Hurrian word ''tad'' (\"to love\") with the addition of the typical Hurrian [[mid vowel]] rising (mVr) [[formant]] ''mar''.{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA236 236]}} Similarly, according to this theory, \"Palmyra\" derives from the Hurrian word ''pal'' (\"to know\") using the same mVr formant (''mar'').{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p=

over Palmyra, Aurelian dedicated a large temple of [[Sol Invictus]] in Rome;{{sfn|Hijmans|2009|p= 484}} most scholars consider Aurelian's Sol Invictus to be of Syrian origin,{{sfn|Hijmans|2009|p= 485}} either a continuation of emperor [[Elagabalus]] cult of [[Elagabalus (deity)|Sol Invictus Elagabalus]], or Malakbel of Palmyra.{{sfn|Halsberghe|1972|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=8tIUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA156 156]}} The Palmyrene deity was commonly identified with the Roman god [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]] and he had a temple dedicated for him on the right bank of the [[Tiber]] since the second century.{{sfn|Watson|2004|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=kJ2JAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA196 196]}} Also, he bore the epithet Invictus and was known with the name

the Palmyrene deity as Aurelian's Sol Invictus is inferred from a passage by [[Zosimus]] reading: \"and the magnificent temple of the sun he (i.e. Aurelian) embellished with votive gifts from Palmyra, setting up statues of [[Helios]] and Bel\".{{sfn|Dirven|1999|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=_LfXg2r6FT0C&pg=PA174 174]}} Three deities from Palmyra exemplified solar features: Malakbel,

Some scholars criticize the notion of Malakbel's identification with Sol Invictus; according to [[Gaston Halsberghe]], the cult of Malakbel was too local for it to become an imperial Roman god and Aurelian's restoration of Bel's temple and sacrifices dedicated to Malakbel were a sign of his attachment to the sun god in general and his respect to the many ways in which the deity was worshiped.{{sfn|Halsberghe|1972|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=8tIUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA157 157]}} [[Richard Stoneman]] suggested another approach in which Aurelian simply borrowed the imagery of Malakbel to enhance his own solar deity.{{sfn|Stoneman|1994|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=8kLFfE1qPhIC&pg=PA185 185]}} The relation between Malakbel and Sol Invictus can not be confirmed and

Archaeological finds date back to the [[Neolithic]] period, and documents first mention the city in the early second millennium BC. Palmyra changed hands on a number of occasions between different empires before becoming a subject of the [[Roman Empire]] in the first century AD.\n\nThe city grew wealthy from trade [[Caravan (travellers)|caravans]]; the Palmyrenes became renowned as merchants who established colonies along the [[Silk Road]] and operated throughout the Roman Empire. Palmyra's wealth enabled the construction of monumental projects, such as the [[Great Colonnade at Palmyra|Great Colonnade]], the [[Temple of Bel]], and the distinctive tower tombs. Ethnically, the Palmyrenes combined elements of [[Amorites]], [[Arameans]], and [[Arabs]]. The city's social structure was tribal, and its inhabitants spoke [[Palmyrene dialect|Palmyrene]] (a dialect of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]), while using [[Greek language|Greek]] for commercial and diplomatic purposes. [[Greco-Roman world#Culture|Greco-Roman culture]] influenced the [[Culture of Syria|culture]] of Palmyra, which produced distinctive art and architecture that combined eastern and western traditions. The city's inhabitants worshiped [[Canaanite religion|local Semitic deities]], [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian]] and [[Arabian mythology|Arab gods]].\n\nBy the third century AD Palmyra had become a prosperous regional center. It reached the apex of its power in the 260s, when the Palmyrene King [[Odaenathus]] defeated [[Sasanian Empire|Persian]] Emperor [[Shapur I]]. The king was succeeded by [[regent]] Queen [[Zenobia]], who rebelled against Rome and established the [[Palmyrene Empire]]. In 273, Roman emperor [[Aurelian]] destroyed the city, which was later restored by [[Diocletian]] at a reduced size. The Palmyrenes converted to [[Christianity]] during the fourth century and to [[Islam]] in the centuries following the conquest by the 7th-century [[Rashidun Caliphate]], after which the Palmyrene and Greek languages were replaced by [[Arabic]].\n\nBefore AD 273, Palmyra enjoyed autonomy and was attached to the Roman [[Syria (Roman province)|province of Syria]], having its political organization influenced by the [[Polis|Greek city-state]] model during the first two centuries AD. The city became a [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman colonia]] during the third century, leading to the incorporation of Roman governing institutions, before becoming a monarchy in 260. Following its destruction in 273, Palmyra became a minor center under the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and later empires. Its destruction by the [[Timurid Empire|Timurids]] in 1400 reduced it to a small village. Under [[French Mandate of Syria|French Mandatory]] rule in 1932, the inhabitants were moved into the new village of [[Tadmur]], and the ancient site became available for excavations. During the [[Syrian Civil War]] in 2015, the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) destroyed large parts of the ancient city, which was recaptured by the [[Syrian Army]] on 2 March 2017.\n\n==Etymology==\nRecords of the name \"Tadmor\" date from the early second millennium BC;{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA238 238]}} eighteenth century BC tablets from [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] written in [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] record the name as \"Ta-ad-mi-ir\", while Assyrian inscriptions of the eleventh century BC record it as \"Ta-ad-mar\".{{sfn|Limet|1977|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=-5o3AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA104 104]}} Aramaic Palmyrene inscriptions themselves showed two variants of the name; ''TDMR'' (''i.e.'', Tadmar) and ''TDMWR'' (''i.e.'', Tadmor).{{sfn|Buben\u00edk|1989|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=DT98F5CFtQsC&pg=PA229 229]}}{{sfn|Wolfensohn|2016|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=m2WSDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT118 118]}} The etymology of the name is unclear; the standard interpretation, supported by [[Albert Schultens]], connects it to the Semitic word for \"[[Date palm#Dates|date palm]]\", ''tamar'' ({{Hebrew|[[:wikt:\u05ea\u05de\u05e8|\u05ea\u05de\u05e8]]}}),{{#tag:ref|The Semitic word T.M.R is the common root for the words that designate palm

Elder]] in the 1st century AD.{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA248 248]}} It was used throughout the [[Greco-Roman]] world.{{sfn|Charnock|1859|p= [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_I2BulY4WvsYC/page/n210 200]}} It is generally believed that \"Palmyra\" derives from \"Tadmor\" and linguists have presented two possibilities; one view holds that Palmyra was an alteration of Tadmor.{{sfn|Charnock|1859|p= [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_I2BulY4WvsYC/page/n210 200]}} According to the suggestion by Schultens, \"Palmyra\" could have arisen as a corruption of \"Tadmor\", via an unattested form \"Talmura\", changed to \"Palmura\" by the influence of the Latin word ''[[:wikt:palma|palma]]'' (date \"[[Arecaceae|palm]]\"),{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA238 238]}} in reference to the city's palm trees, then the name reached its final form \"Palmyra\".{{sfn|Charnock|1859|p= [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_I2BulY4WvsYC/page/n211 201]}} The second view, supported by some philologists, such as [[Jean Starcky]], holds that Palmyra is a translation of \"Tadmor\" (assuming that it meant palm), which had derived from the Greek word for palm, \"''palame''\".{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA238 238]}}{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA235 235]}}\n\nAn alternative suggestion connects the name to the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ''tedmurt\u0101'' (\u072c\u0715\u0721\u0718\u072a\u072c\u0710) \"miracle\", hence ''tedmurt\u0101'' \"object of wonder\", from the root ''dmr'' \"to wonder\"; this possibility was mentioned favourably by [[Franz Altheim]] and Ruth Altheim-Stiehl (1973), but rejected by Jean Starcky (1960) and Michael Gawlikowski (1974).{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA248 248]}} [[Michael Patrick O'Connor]] (1988) suggested that the names \"Palmyra\" and \"Tadmor\" originated in the [[Hurrian language]].{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA238 238]}} As evidence, he cited the inexplicability of alterations to the theorized roots of both names (represented in the addition of ''-d-'' to ''tamar'' and ''-ra-'' to ''palame'').{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA235 235]}} According to this theory, \"Tadmor\" derives from the Hurrian word ''tad'' (\"to love\") with the addition of the typical Hurrian [[mid vowel]] rising (mVr) [[formant]] ''mar''.{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA236 236]}} Similarly, according to this theory, \"Palmyra\" derives from the Hurrian word ''pal'' (\"to know\") using the same mVr formant (''mar'').{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p=

[https://books.google.com/books?id=8tIUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA156 156]}} The Palmyrene deity was commonly identified with the Roman god [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]] and he had a temple dedicated for him on the

Some scholars criticize the notion of Malakbel's identification with Sol Invictus; according to [[Gaston Halsberghe]], the cult of Malakbel was too local for it to become an imperial Roman god and Aurelian's restoration of Bel's temple and sacrifices dedicated to Malakbel were a sign of his attachment to the sun god in general and his respect to the many ways in which the deity was worshiped.{{sfn|Halsberghe|1972|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=8tIUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA157 157]}} [[Richard Stoneman]] suggested another approach in which Aurelian simply borrowed the imagery of
