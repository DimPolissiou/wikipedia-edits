It borders [[Mendoza Province]] to the north, [[Rio Negro Province]] to the southeast, and [[Chile]] to the west. It also meets [[La Pampa Province]] at its northeast corner.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Argentinosaurus skeleton, PLoS ONE.png|thumb|left|Reconstructed skeleton of the sauropod ''[[Argentinosaurus]]''. It is among the [[Dinosaur size|largest known dinosaurs]] found in Neuqu\u00e9n.]]\n\nThe Neuqu\u00e9n Province receives its name from the [[Neuqu\u00e9n River]].\nThe term ''\"Neuqu\u00e9n\"'' derives from the [[Mapuche language|Mapudungun]] word ''\"Nehuenken\"'' meaning ''drafty'', which the aborigines used for the river. The word (without the accentuation) is a [[palindrome]].\n\n[[L\u00e1car Department]] in Neuqu\u00e9n Province has the southernmost known remains of [[maize]] before it was further diffused by the [[Inca Empire]]. Maize remains were found as far south as 40\u00b019' S in Melinquina, with it being found inside pottery dated to 730 \u00b180 BP and 920 \u00b160 BP.

In 1884 Patagonia's political divisions were restructured and the ''Territory of Neuqu\u00e9n'' acquired its current boundaries. The capital of the province moved several times to ''Norqu\u00edn'' (1884\u201385), ''Campana Mahuida'' (current [[Loncopu\u00e9]]) (1885\u20131888), [[Chos Malal]] (1885\u20131901), and finally ''Confluencia'' currently known as [[Neuqu\u00e9n]].\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the railway reached the city of Neuqu\u00e9n, and a new irrigation system was finished, facilitating the production and later transportation of crops. [[Petroleum]] was found in ''Plaza Huincul'' in 1918, giving Neuqu\u00e9n a new push forward.\n\nLocal politics have long been dominated by a single political party, the MPN or [[Movimiento Popular Neuquino]] founded by [[Elias Sapag]], a prosperous businessman born in [[Lebanon]].\n\nMigrating to [[Argentina]], the Sapag family arrived in Neuqu\u00e9n Territory around 1910 with the railroad, eventually making their home in [[Zapala]], whose dry, fertile mountain valleys and orchards were reminiscent of their native [[Lebanon]]. Neuqu\u00e9n is rich in natural resources such as natural gas, petroleum, [[virgin forest]]s and [[water resources]] suitable for electric power and tourism alike. These resources were formerly managed by the central National Government, which resulted in little local benefit at the time. Because of social unrest, [[Elias Sapag]] and two younger brothers, Felipe and Amado, started the MPN, an active political movement rooted in [[federalism]] and greater local rights over the territory and its resources.\n\nThe territory was made a province on June 15, 1955, and its constitution promulgated on November 28, 1957. [[Felipe Sapag]] soon became politically prominent.  Although he was elected governor in 1962 representing the [[Movimiento Popular Neuquino]], a coup against progressive President [[Arturo Frondizi]] that March prevented Sapag from taking office.  Eventually becoming governor in 1963-66 and 1973\u201376, he presided over one of Argentina's fastest-growing provinces. The national government established the [[University of Neuqu\u00e9n]] in 1964, later incorporated into the new [[National University of Comahue]] in 1971. Removed as governor following the violent March 1976 coup against [[Isabel Per\u00f3n]], Felipe Sapag was returned to office in 1983-87 and 1995-99. His emphasis on public works and political independence from Buenos Aires have helped him and his successors with the MPN win every province-wide election since. His brother [[Elias Sapag]] became senator in 1963-66, 1973\u201376 and from 1983 until his death in 1993, becoming the longest-serving senator in national history.

Roughly half its output is accounted for by its mining and extractive sector, mainly on account of its massive gas and petroleum production, the most important in Argentina.  That dependency is only likely to increase:  development of the province's huge unconventional hydrocarbon reserves is beginning, above all in the [[Vaca Muerta]] formation.\n\nThe province generates a significant part of Patagonia's electric power through the hydroelectric plants of [[Piedra del \u00c1guila Dam|Piedra del \u00c1guila]], [[El Choc\u00f3n Dam|El Choc\u00f3n]], [[Pichi Pic\u00fan Leuf\u00fa Dam|Pichi Pic\u00fan Leuf\u00fa]], Planicie Banderita (in the [[Cerros Colorados Complex]]), and [[Alicur\u00e1 Dam|Alicur\u00e1]].

In 1884 Patagonia's political divisions were restructured and the ''Territory of Neuqu\u00e9n'' acquired its current boundaries. The capital of the province moved several times to ''Norqu\u00edn'' (1884\u201385), ''Campana Mahuida'' (current [[Loncopu\u00e9]]) (1885\u20131888), [[Chos Malal]] (1885\u20131901), and finally ''Confluencia'' currently known as [[Neuqu\u00e9n]].\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the railway reached the city of Neuqu\u00e9n, and a new irrigation system was finished, facilitating the production and later transportation of crops. [[Petroleum]] was found in ''Plaza Huincul'' in 1918, giving Neuqu\u00e9n a new push forward.\n\nLocal politics have long been dominated by a single political party, the MPN or [[Movimiento Popular Neuquino]] founded by [[Elias Sapag]], a prosperous businessman born in [[Lebanon]].\n\nMigrating to [[Argentina]], the Sapag family arrived in Neuqu\u00e9n Territory around 1910 with the railroad, eventually making their home in [[Zapala]], whose dry, fertile mountain valleys and orchards were reminiscent of their native [[Lebanon]]. Neuqu\u00e9n is rich in natural resources such as natural gas, petroleum, [[virgin forest]]s and [[water resources]] suitable for electric power and tourism alike. These resources were formerly managed by the central National Government, which resulted in little local benefit at the time. Because of social unrest, [[Elias Sapag]] and two younger brothers, Felipe and Amado, started the MPN, an active political movement rooted in [[federalism]] and greater local rights over the territory and its resources.\n\nThe territory was made a province on June 15, 1955, and its constitution promulgated on November 28, 1957. [[Felipe Sapag]] soon became politically prominent.  Although he was elected governor in 1962 representing the [[Movimiento Popular Neuquino]], a coup against progressive President [[Arturo Frondizi]] that March prevented Sapag from taking office.  Eventually becoming governor in 1963-66 and 1973\u201376, he presided over one of Argentina's fastest-growing provinces. The national government established the [[University of Neuqu\u00e9n]] in 1964, later incorporated into the new [[National University of Comahue]] in 1971. Removed as governor following the violent March 1976 coup against [[Isabel Per\u00f3n]], Felipe Sapag was returned to office in 1983-87 and 1995-99. His emphasis on public works and political independence from Buenos Aires have helped him and his successors with the MPN win every province-wide election since. His brother [[Elias Sapag]] became senator in 1963-66, 1973\u201376 and from 1983 until his death in 1993, becoming the longest-serving senator in national history. The MPN also elected Governors Pedro Salvatori (1987\u201391), [[Jorge Sobisch]] (1991\u201395 and 1999\u20132007) and current Governor [[Jorge Sapag]] (2007\u201311).\n\nNeuqu\u00e9n has, since 1955, become a prosperous province with a high impact on the national energy supply and, as a growing tourist destination, outperforming most other provinces in the [[Patagonia]] region and in Argentina.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n==Geography==\n{{see also|Neuqu\u00e9n Basin}}\n[[Image:Lanin Huechulafquen.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Lan\u00edn]] a large stratovolcano in Neuqu\u00e9n]] [[Image:Cerro Chapelco Paisaje.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Chapelco]].]]\n\nThe province's limits are the [[Colorado River (Argentina)|Colorado River]] to the northeast, separating it from the [[Mendoza Province]], the [[Limay River]] to the southeast toward the [[R\u00edo Negro Province]], and the [[Andes]] mountains to the west, separating it from [[Chile]].\n\nThere are two main distinctive landscapes; the mountainous fertile valleys with forest on the west, and the arid plateau with fertile land only near the basins of the rivers on the east, mostly the Limay River and [[Neuqu\u00e9n River]].\n\nThe [[Lake|lacustrine]] system includes other less-important rivers such as the [[Alumin\u00e9 River]], the Malleo, and the [[Pic\u00fan Leuf\u00fa River]], and a series of lakes including [[Nahuel Huapi Lake]] (550&nbsp;km\u00b2), shared with R\u00edo Negro Province, [[Alumin\u00e9 Lake]] (58&nbsp;km\u00b2), [[L\u00e1car Lake]] (49&nbsp;km\u00b2), Huechulaufquen Lake (110&nbsp;km\u00b2), [[Lolog Lake]] (35&nbsp;km\u00b2), Traful, Hermoso, Quill\u00e9n, \u00d1orquinco, Tromen and Falkner.\n\nThe province is home to the magnificent [[Luma apiculata|Arrayanes]] ''(Luma apiculata)'' forest at the [[Los Arrayanes National Park]].

Roughly half its output is accounted for by its mining and extractive sector, mainly on account of its massive gas and petroleum production, the most important in Argentina.

Over the course of the season, Arteta began to play again in the centre of the field, usually being partnered with a defensive midfielder, giving him the freedom to dictate the tempo of the game and connecting with Pienaar and Osman on the wing.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nArteta made his return from injury in January 2010 as a substitute in an [[FA Cup]] tie against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], before starting in a 2\u20131 home Premier League win against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].

He is currently the head coach of {{English football updater|Arsenal}} club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].\n\nBorn in [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]], Arteta played as an [[attacking midfielder|attacking]] and [[defensive midfielder]], and operated primarily as a [[Advanced playmaker|playmaker]]. He was a [[La Masia|youth player]] at [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], but never featured for the first team, and made his senior debut as a loanee in [[Ligue 1]] with [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] in 2001.

Following a brief stint with [[Real Sociedad]], Arteta joined [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on loan in 2005; he then signed permanently.

Because [[Sri Lanka]] had not won its independence from the [[British Empire]] an almost state aided conversion submerged other communities. Nevertheless, Muslim pioneers in education were more than satisfied that Islam would weather assaults at conversion but that education was essential for the Muslim community\u2019s progress if not its very survival. Thus, due to this and many other pertaining factors,{{specify|reason=Those factors are?|date=August 2015}} Zahira was established on Monday, 22 August 1892.\n\n===Factors influencing establishment===\nDuring a public speech made by M. C. Siddhi Lebbe in 1891 at the Maradana Mosque Hall (which later became to be the college mosque), he appealed to the Muslim community to unite and promote the educational advancement of the community. This led to the formation of the Colombo Muslim Educational Society. The first Secretary was I. L. M. Abdul Aziz and Arasi Marikar Wapchie Marikar was the first Treasurer and Head Master. With the help of Ahamed Orabi Pasha, an Egyptian exile in [[Ceylon]] and freedom fighter, Al-Madrasathul Zahira was established. In 1894 the school was registered as a grant-in-aid school Maradana Mohammedan Boys School.\n[[File:Gafoor.jpg|thumb|right|The Gafoor Hall, Colleges Main Hall]]\n\n[[File:Umpichy.jpg|thumb|right|The Umpichy Building across the college ground]]\n\n== Sports ==\nThe College has produced a number of football players who represented the national team.{{who|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe college swimming pool project was proposed and funded by the Old Boys Association. and it was officially opened for the School Students, Old boys and for the Public (after school hours).

Because [[Sri Lanka]] had not won its independence from the [[British Empire]] an almost state aided conversion submerged other communities. Nevertheless, Muslim pioneers in education were more than satisfied that Islam would weather assaults at conversion but that education was essential for the Muslim community\u2019s progress if not its very survival. Thus, due to this and many other pertaining factors,{{specify|reason=Those factors are?|date=August 2015}} Zahira was established on Monday, 22 August 1892.\n\n===Factors influencing establishment===\nDuring a public speech made by M. C. Siddhi Lebbe in 1891 at the Maradana Mosque Hall (which later became to be the college mosque), he appealed to the Muslim community to unite and promote the educational advancement of the community. This led to the formation of the Colombo Muslim Educational Society. The first Secretary was I. L. M. Abdul Aziz and Arasi Marikar Wapchie Marikar was the first Treasurer and Head Master. With the help of Ahamed Orabi Pasha, an Egyptian exile in [[Ceylon]] and freedom fighter, Al-Madrasathul Zahira was established. In 1894 the school was registered as a grant-in-aid school Maradana Mohammedan Boys School.\n[[File:Gafoor.jpg|thumb|right|The Gafoor Hall, Colleges Main Hall]]\n\n[[File:Umpichy.jpg|thumb|right|The Umpichy Building across the college ground]]\n\n== Sports ==\nThe College has produced a number of football players who represented the national team.{{who|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe college swimming pool project was proposed and funded by the Old Boys Association. and it was officially opened for the School Students, Old boys and for the Public (after school hours).
