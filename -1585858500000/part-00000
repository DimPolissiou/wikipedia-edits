For several years, she staffed the abuse hotline and co-facilitated support groups for adult survivors of child sexual abuse. During this time, she started to read [[feminist]] analyses of [[violence against women]], particularly sexual violence and exploitation. Hughes writes that she began to feel emotional and [[cognitive dissonance]] between her scientific studies and the feminist activist work she was doing. Initially an instructor in both genetics and women's studies, an increasingly critical view of what she felt was the disconnected nature of science led her to focus on women's studies.<ref name=hughes2000/>\n\nHughes later served as a lecturer on women's studies at [[University of Bradford]], UK, between 1994 and 1996, before moving on to a full professorship at [[University of Rhode Island]], where she holds the Eleanor M. and Oscar M. Carlson Endowed Chair in Women's Studies.

For several years, she staffed the abuse hotline and co-facilitated support groups for adult survivors of child sexual abuse. During this time, she started to read [[feminist]] analyses of [[violence against women]], particularly sexual violence and exploitation. Hughes writes that she began to feel emotional and [[cognitive dissonance]] between her scientific studies and the feminist activist work she was doing. Initially an instructor in both genetics and women's studies, an increasingly critical view of what she felt was the disconnected nature of science led her to focus on women's studies.<ref name=hughes2000/>\n\nHughes later served as a lecturer on women's studies at [[University of Bradford]], UK, between 1994 and 1996, before moving on to a full professorship at [[University of Rhode Island]], where she holds the Eleanor M. and Oscar M.

McBurney III]] was the only member of the General Assembly at the time of the 2009 vote who had served in 1980. He stated in 2009, \"We probably vote on 500 bills a year (...) They didn't know what they were voting for.\"<ref name=\"Arditi\"/>\nJohn C. Revens Jr. is a former Senate Majority leader and a lawyer who served in the General Assembly for nearly four decades. He agreed, \"They would never sponsor a bill decriminalizing prostitution if they knew what it was. No way. Not in a million years.\"<ref name=\"Arditi\"/>\n*1976: [[COYOTE]] is a sex worker rights activist group led by [[Margo St. James]]. They filed a lawsuit against Rhode Island.  The argument was based on how much power the state should have to control the sexual activity of its citizens in the case ''COYOTE v. Roberts''.  The lawsuit also alleged discrimination on how the law was being applied. Data was submitted that demonstrated selective prosecution, as the Providence Police were arresting female prostitutes far more often than the male customers. Ralph J. Gonnella was Margo St. James's lawyer. He argued that the prostitution law was so broad that it failed to even mention money. It could make sexual relations between unmarried adults a crime punishable by a $10 fine, and the person who initiated the offer of sex could be charged with soliciting and face up to five years in prison.<ref name=\"Arditi\"/>\n*1980: Rhode Island General Assembly changed the law on prostitution, deleting the statute which prohibited the act of prostitution itself, but continuing to prohibit street solicitation. With the change in the criminal statute, the lawsuit was dismissed which was filed by COYOTE.\n*1998: State Supreme Court rules in ''State v. DeMagistris'' that the law against soliciting for prostitution was \"primarily to bar prostitutes from hawking their wares in public,\" and it could not be applied to convict someone for activity that takes place in private.\n*2003: Prostitution charges against four women arrested at two Providence spas were dismissed after attorney Michael J. Kiselica cited the 1998 Supreme Court ruling, successfully arguing that Rhode Island had no law against indoor prostitution.\n*2005: Bill to make prostitution illegal, wherever it occurs, died in the General Assembly; similar bills failed in subsequent years.<ref name=\"Arditi\"/>\n*2009: Prostitution was outlawed. On November 3, Governor [[Donald Carcieri]] signed into law a bill which made it a crime to exchange sex for money.\n\nAn article by Scott Cunningham and [[Manisha Shah]] published in the <u>Review of Economic Studies</u> found that the judicial decriminalization of indoor prostitution in 2003 caused a 30% decline in reported female rape offenses and a 40% reduction in female [[gonorrhea]] incidents during the six years that prostitution was not an illegal offense.<ref>Cunningham and Shah (2017) \"[https://academic.oup.com/restud/advance-article/doi/10.1093/restud/rdx065/4756165 Decriminalizing Indoor Prostitution: Implications for Sexual Violence and Public Health]\". <u>Review of Economic Studies</u></ref>\n\n== 2009 legislative session ==\n\n=== Legislative battle ===\nAt the beginning of 2009, two bills were introduced in the [[Rhode Island General Assembly]] which defined the crime of prostitution to include any location (one bill, H5044, originated in the House, and the other, S596, in the Senate).\n\nThe most prominent proponent of criminalization was Representative [[Joanne Giannini]] (D).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Schweitzer|first1=Sarah|title=Many seek ban as prostitution thrives in R.I|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/local/rhode_island/articles/2009/08/13/in_rhode_island_battle_over_legal_prostitution_rages_on/|newspaper=Boston.com|accessdate=16 April 2018|date=13 August 2009}}</ref> \nShe introduced Bill H5044 into the [[Rhode Island House of Representatives|House]] on January 8, 2009 (co-sponsored by Reps.

Both bills were accompanied by other [[Trafficking in human beings|trafficking]] legislation, H5661 (Giannini) and S605 (Senator [[Rhoda Perry]]).\n\nAs both the House and the Senate recessed, two separate versions of prostitution bills remained. Both chambers had to approve a single identical bill in order for it to be sent to the Governor, for him to sign it into law.  The two bills differed in the levying of punishment. The Senate version of the bill called for staggered penalties for first, second, and third offenses. Prostitutes, their customers, and property owners found guilty of a first offense would have been punished by a civil \"violation\" and a fine of $100. The House version of the bill called for no penalties for landlords but contained stiffer penalties for prostitutes and customers who were first-time offenders. Anyone found guilty of prostitution faced imprisonment for up to 6 months and a fine of up to $1,000. The penalty for subsequent offenses was up to a year imprisonment and a fine of up to $1,000.\n\nUpon review of both versions of the prostitution bills, the State Police, Attorney General [[Patrick C. Lynch]], and Governor [[Donald Carcieri]] called for the passage of the House version of the bill, with stiffer penalties for first-time offenders.  Supt. Col. Brendan P. Doherty of the [[Rhode Island State Police]] testified that the police agency, \"cannot support civil sanctions for such reprehensible acts.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Arditi|first1=Lynn|title=R.I. law-enforcement officials say Senate bill outlawing indoor prostitution is flawed {{!}} General Assembly|url=http://www.projo.com/generalassembly/PROSTITUTION_BILL_OPPOSED_27_06-28-09_5CES69K_v53.38ad7c3.html|website=The Providence Journal|accessdate=16 April 2018|date=4 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604040849/http://www.projo.com/generalassembly/PROSTITUTION_BILL_OPPOSED_27_06-28-09_5CES69K_v53.38ad7c3.html|archive-date=2011-06-04}}</ref>\n\n====Media scrutiny ====\nTwo front-page articles were published in the ''[[Providence Journal]]'' before the General Assembly returned for a special session, and [[Happy Endings?]] was released to the general public\u2014a documentary on the Asian [[massage parlor]]s in Rhode Island.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/art/content/HAPPY_ENDINGS_FILM_05-24-09_Q9EFHNF_v25.1ecfa95.html |title= Film chronicles R.I.'s Asian brothels |publisher=Providence Journal |date= May 24, 2009 |accessdate=2013-03-07 |first=Lynn |last=Arditi |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110604040055/http://www.projo.com/art/content/HAPPY_ENDINGS_FILM_05-24-09_Q9EFHNF_v25.1ecfa95.html |archive-date=4 June 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"CHANNEL 12\">{{cite web|title=Documentary looks inside massage parlors|url=http://www.wpri.com/dpp/news/local_news/providence/film_documentary_happy_endings_massage_providence20090606|website=WPRI.com|accessdate=16 April 2018|date= 6 June 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100131022849/http://www.wpri.com/dpp/news/local_news/providence/film_documentary_happy_endings_massage_providence20090606 |archive-date=31 January 2010}}</ref>\n[[File:spadoor.jpg|left|thumb|Front door of a Providence spa with multiple police stickers]]\n\n*On September 18, 2009, the ''Providence Journal'' reported that the [[Fraternal Order of Police]], representing the [[Rhode Island State Police]], and the Providence, Barrington, Warwick, and Cranston police had solicited donations from the spas.

McBurney III]] was the only member of the General Assembly at the time of the 2009 vote who had served in 1980. He stated in 2009, \"We probably vote on 500 bills a year (...)

The argument was based on how much power the state should have to control the sexual activity of its citizens in the case ''COYOTE v. Roberts''.  The lawsuit also alleged discrimination on how the law was being applied. Data was submitted that demonstrated selective prosecution, as the Providence Police were arresting female prostitutes far more often than the male customers. Ralph J. Gonnella was Margo St. James's lawyer. He argued that the prostitution law was so broad that it failed to even mention money. It could make sexual relations between unmarried adults a crime punishable by a $10 fine, and the person who initiated the offer of sex could be charged with soliciting and face up to five years in prison.<ref name=\"Arditi\"/>\n*1980: Rhode Island General Assembly changed the law on prostitution, deleting the statute which prohibited the act of prostitution itself, but continuing to prohibit street solicitation. With the change in the criminal statute, the lawsuit was dismissed which was filed by COYOTE.\n*1998: State Supreme Court rules in ''State v. DeMagistris'' that the law against soliciting for prostitution was \"primarily to bar prostitutes from hawking their wares in public,\" and it could not be applied to convict someone for activity that takes place in private.\n*2003: Prostitution charges against four women arrested at two Providence spas were dismissed after attorney Michael J.

Both bills were accompanied by other [[Trafficking in human beings|trafficking]] legislation, H5661 (Giannini) and S605 (Senator [[Rhoda Perry]]).\n\nAs both the House and the Senate recessed, two separate versions of prostitution bills remained. Both chambers had to approve a single identical bill in order for it to be sent to the Governor, for him to sign it into law.  The two bills differed in the levying of punishment. The Senate version of the bill called for staggered penalties for first, second, and third offenses. Prostitutes, their customers, and property owners found guilty of a first offense would have been punished by a civil \"violation\" and a fine of $100. The House version of the bill called for no penalties for landlords but contained stiffer penalties for prostitutes and customers who were first-time offenders. Anyone found guilty of prostitution faced imprisonment for up to 6 months and a fine of up to $1,000. The penalty for subsequent offenses was up to a year imprisonment and a fine of up to $1,000.\n\nUpon review of both versions of the prostitution bills, the State Police, Attorney General [[Patrick C. Lynch]], and Governor [[Donald Carcieri]] called for the passage of the House version of the bill, with stiffer penalties for first-time offenders.  Supt. Col. Brendan P.

Project Weber recruited and surveyed 50 male sex workers living on the streets of [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]].

The people of Uromi, in support of the traditional monarch [[Ogbidi Okojie]], accepted the new religion and after a period of catechetical instruction and evangelism, built a church on land donated by

After causing chaos at a wild west themed attraction, Pops ditches them and drives off with a woman ([[Christie Brinkley]] reprising her role as the flirty woman from the movie), and Erica tells Adam and Barry that they're not moving out but are moving on to the next chapter of their lives, not knowing that Beverly overheard them. Meanwhile, Erica worries about \"something important\" Geoff wants to tell her when they return, thinking he wants to break up. After their car breaks down, Adam tells Barry and Erica he will be glad that they're not in the house anymore, causing Beverly to demand that they tell her the truth about going to college and never looking back. She decides they should all just go home. But just then, Geoff picks them up and tells Erica that he just wanted to inform her he's taking a gap year rather than attending college right away. They arrive at Disneyland with Pops joining them after he arrived. After being told by the security guard that the park is closed but that it opens in 15 minutes, Beverly lies about their adventure, and the Goldbergs get into the park before the actual opening and finally enjoy their last family vacation. \n\n'''Featured Songs''': \"[[Holiday Road]]\" by [[Lindsey Buckingham]], \"[[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|Chariots of Fire]]\" by [[Vangelis]]\n |LineColor=E2E78B \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Goldbergs (season 7)\n |EpisodeNumber = 142\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = Dana's Back\n |DirectedBy = [[Jay Chandrasekhar]]\n |WrittenBy = {{StoryTeleplay|t=Mike Sikowitz|s=[[Adam F.

Adam wins the part of Romeo, but the part of Juliet goes to Vic's daughter Asha. When Asha and Adam passionately kiss in rehearsal, Dana gets jealous, while Dave Kim insists that Asha must be into Adam because she scrawled \"A.G.\" on her notebook.

Adam then learns that Asha was just acting, and that the \"A.G.\" on her notebook is for Andrew Gallery.

After causing chaos at a wild west themed attraction, Pops ditches them and drives off with a woman ([[Christie Brinkley]] reprising her role as the flirty woman from the movie), and Erica tells Adam and Barry that they're not moving out but are moving on to the next chapter of their lives, not knowing that Beverly overheard them. Meanwhile, Erica worries about \"something important\" Geoff wants to tell her when they return, thinking he wants to break up. After their car breaks down, Adam tells Barry and Erica he will be glad that they're not in the house anymore, causing Beverly to demand that they tell her the truth about going to college and never looking back. She decides they should all just go home. But just then, Geoff picks them up and tells Erica that he just wanted to inform her he's taking a gap year rather than attending college right away. They arrive at Disneyland with Pops joining them after he arrived. After being told by the security guard that the park is closed but that it opens in 15 minutes, Beverly lies about their adventure, and the Goldbergs get into the park before the actual opening and finally enjoy their last family vacation. \n\n'''Featured Songs''': \"[[Holiday Road]]\" by [[Lindsey Buckingham]], \"[[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|Chariots of Fire]]\" by [[Vangelis]]\n |LineColor=E2E78B \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Goldbergs (season 7)\n |EpisodeNumber = 142\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = Dana's Back\n |DirectedBy = [[Jay Chandrasekhar]]\n |WrittenBy = {{StoryTeleplay|t=Mike Sikowitz|s=[[Adam F.

[http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/23precinct.pdf \"23rd Police Precinct (\"Tenderloin\") Station House Designation Report\"], pp. 2\u20133</ref> encompassing parts of what is now [[NoMad]], [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]], [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]], the [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]] and the [[Theater District, Manhattan|Theater District]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[New York Police Department]] Captain [[Alexander S. Williams|Alexander S. \"Clubber\" Williams]] gave the area its [[nickname]]<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/03/26/102326245.pdf \"Williams, 'Ex-Czar' Of Tenderloin, Dies\"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 26, 1917.</ref> in 1876, when he was transferred to a police precinct in the heart of this district.  Referring to the increased number of bribes he would receive for police protection of both legitimate and illegitimate businesses there &ndash; especially the many [[brothel]]s &ndash; Williams said, \"I've been having [[chuck steak]] ever since I've been on the force, and now I'm going to have a bit of [[Beef tenderloin|tenderloin]].\"<ref name=encnyc /><ref name=g959>Burrows & Wallace, p.959</ref>\n\nThe name became a generic term for a [[red-light district]] in an American city; [[San Francisco, California]] is among the other cities having a well-known \"[[Tenderloin, San Francisco|Tenderloin District]]\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:Thomas DeWitt Talmage c1870.jpg|thumb|150px|The Rev. [[Thomas De Witt Talmage]] called New York City the \"modern [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Gomorrah]]\" for allowing the Tenderloin to exist.]]\n\nEarly in the 19th century, the major [[vice]] district had been located in what is now [[SoHo#decline|SoHo]], called at the time \"Hells' Hundred Acres\", but as the city grew steadily northward, the theater district along Broadway and the [[Bowery]] moved uptown as well, as did the legitimate and illegitimate businesses that were usually connected with show business.  For some time, the city's \"[[Union Square, Manhattan#Rialto, Manhattan|Rialto]]\" centered on [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] and [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]], but the [[Fifth Avenue Hotel]] broke new ground when it opened at [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]] and [[Fifth Avenue]] in 1859, beginning the expansion of the Union Square Rialto to 23rd Street and [[Madison Square]]. By the 1870s, the Fifth Avenue Hotel had many competitors in the area, and where the hotels were, the [[prostitutes]] followed.<ref name=g959 />\n\nBy the 1880s, the Tenderloin encompassed the largest number of [[nightclub]]s, [[bar (establishment)|saloon]]s, [[bordello]]s, [[gambling|gambling casinos]], [[dance hall]]s, and \"[[clip joint]]s\" in New York City, to the extent that one estimate made in 1885 was that half of the buildings in the district were connected with vice.<ref name=wpa147 /> Reformers referred to the area as \"Satan's Circus\",<ref name=encnyc /> and one anti-vice crusading minister, the Rev. [[Thomas De Witt Talmage]], denounced the entire city of New York as \"the modern [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Gomorrah]]\" for allowing it to exist.<ref name=wpa147>Federal Writers Project, p.147</ref>\n\nThe clientele of these establishments was not necessarily working-class: one set of seven sisters ran side-by-side [[brothels]] in a residential neighborhood on West 25th Street, inviting their upper class customers with engraved invitations. On some nights only gentlemen in formal evening dress were allowed to attend, and the girls of these houses were as socially adept as they were sexually;<ref name=g959 /> on Christmas Eve profits were given to charity.<ref>Federal Writers Project, p.164</ref>\n\nOther well-known venues in the Tenderloin included [[Koster and Bial's Music Hall]] at [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] and 23rd Street, a concert saloon where inebriated customers could watch the [[can-can]] being performed; the Haymarket, a dance hall on Sixth below 30th Street, where rich clients could dance with prostitutes, but not too closely, although they could take them into curtained-off galleries to have discreet sex, and sex exhibitions were on display in the balconies; West 29th Street, which featured an almost uninterrupted row of brothels; and the many gambling dens run by [[John Daly (gambler)|John Daly]] or the [[Madison Square]] Club of [[Richard A. Canfield]] on West 26th Street.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp. 1148\u20131149</ref>\n\n[[File:Czar of the Tenderloin.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The cover of the [[sheet music]] for a popular 1897 song shows a police [[billy club]] and uses \"Clubber\" Williams' nickname: \"The Czar of the Tenderloin\"]]\n[[File:Anthony Comstock.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Anthony Comstock]], anti-vice crusader]]\n\nThe \"Main Street\" of the district was [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] between 23rd and 42nd Streets, which was known as \"The Line\". In the mid-1890s, after the advent of electric lighting, the stretch of Broadway from 23rd Street to [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] came to be called \"[[The Great White Way]]\" because of the numerous illuminated advertising signs there.  This moniker was transferred to [[Times Square]] when the theater district moved uptown.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p.1066</ref>\n\n=== Crime ===\nCrime was also a major aspect of the Tenderloin, which was considered to be the worst crime-ridden area of what was thought to be the most crime-ridden city of the United States.<ref name=nyclpc /> To a certain extent, [[police corruption]] kept crime under control as it regularized the financial relationship between the police and the criminals, but the area was too large, and the pickings too easy, for [[street crime]] to be managed completely.  In 1906, [[William McAdoo (New Jersey)|William McAdoo]], who was the city's Police Commissioner in 1904 and 1905, wrote that the \"Tenderloin [police] precinct, as every one knows, is the most important precinct in New York, if not in the United States, or probably in the world, from the amount of police business done there and from the character of the neighborhood.\"<ref name=nyclpc />\n\nOccasionally there would be organized attempts to clean up the Tenderloin, and reformist mayors, such as [[William Russell Grace]] and [[Abram S. Hewitt]], would authorize raids on saloons and brothels, even those under the protection of \"Clubber\" Williams, but the effects were generally temporary: prostitutes would decamp to outlying areas, and return when the latest crusade was over. The net effect of these \"shake-ups\" or \"shake-downs\" was simply to drive up the cost of protection afterwards, making Williams even richer &ndash; he retired a millionaire &ndash; and putting more money into the pockets of [[Tammany Hall]], which was deeply entwined in the graft and corruption connected with the district.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p.1163</ref>\n\nFrustration at this state of affairs led to [[Anthony Comstock]]'s anti-vice crusade, which operated with [[United States government|Federal]] authority from the [[United States Postal Service|Post Office]] and with the support of the New York [[Chamber of Commerce]] and leading citizens such as [[J. P. Morgan]]. Comstock's crusade knew no boundaries &ndash; he was as likely to target \"smut\" in the public libraries as he was sex-for-hire in the Tenderloin &ndash; but along with Rev. Talmage, he was able to get state legislation passed banning [[pool halls]], even though they continued to operate openly.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp. 1163\u20131165</ref>\n\nAside from its commercial activities, the Tenderloin was also the home neighborhood for a large part of Manhattan's [[African American]] population,<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p.1112</ref> especially in the downtown and western portion of the district: Seventh Avenue within the Tenderloin, in fact, became known as the \"African Broadway\".<ref name=nyclpc /> This was a neighborhood of blacks with [[American middle class|middle class]] aspirations.\n\n==== {{anchor|Race riot}} Race riot ====\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

Williams|Alexander S. \"Clubber\" Williams]] gave the area its [[nickname]]<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/03/26/102326245.pdf \"Williams, 'Ex-Czar' Of Tenderloin, Dies\"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 26, 1917.</ref> in 1876, when he was transferred to a police precinct in the heart of this district.  Referring to the increased number of bribes he would receive for police protection of both legitimate and illegitimate businesses there &ndash; especially the many [[brothel]]s &ndash; Williams said, \"I've been having [[chuck steak]] ever since I've been on the force, and now I'm going to have a bit of [[Beef tenderloin|tenderloin]].\"<ref name=encnyc /><ref name=g959>Burrows & Wallace, p.959</ref>\n\nThe name became a generic term for a [[red-light district]] in an American city; [[San Francisco, California]] is among the other cities having a well-known \"[[Tenderloin, San Francisco|Tenderloin District]]\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:Thomas DeWitt Talmage c1870.jpg|thumb|150px|The Rev. [[Thomas De Witt Talmage]] called New York City the \"modern [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Gomorrah]]\" for allowing the Tenderloin to exist.]]\n\nEarly in the 19th century, the major [[vice]] district had been located in what is now [[SoHo#decline|SoHo]], called at the time \"Hells' Hundred Acres\", but as the city grew steadily northward, the theater district along Broadway and the [[Bowery]] moved uptown as well, as did the legitimate and illegitimate businesses that were usually connected with show business.  For some time, the city's \"[[Union Square, Manhattan#Rialto, Manhattan|Rialto]]\" centered on [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] and [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]], but the [[Fifth Avenue Hotel]] broke new ground when it opened at [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]] and [[Fifth Avenue]] in 1859, beginning the expansion of the Union Square Rialto to 23rd Street and [[Madison Square]]. By the 1870s, the Fifth Avenue Hotel had many competitors in the area, and where the hotels were, the [[prostitutes]] followed.<ref name=g959 />\n\nBy the 1880s, the Tenderloin encompassed the largest number of [[nightclub]]s, [[bar (establishment)|saloon]]s, [[bordello]]s, [[gambling|gambling casinos]], [[dance hall]]s, and \"[[clip joint]]s\" in New York City, to the extent that one estimate made in 1885 was that half of the buildings in the district were connected with vice.<ref name=wpa147 /> Reformers referred to the area as \"Satan's Circus\",<ref name=encnyc /> and one anti-vice crusading minister, the Rev. [[Thomas De Witt Talmage]], denounced the entire city of New York as \"the modern [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Gomorrah]]\" for allowing it to exist.<ref name=wpa147>Federal Writers Project, p.147</ref>\n\nThe clientele of these establishments was not necessarily working-class: one set of seven sisters ran side-by-side [[brothels]] in a residential neighborhood on West 25th Street, inviting their upper class customers with engraved invitations. On some nights only gentlemen in formal evening dress were allowed to attend, and the girls of these houses were as socially adept as they were sexually;<ref name=g959 /> on Christmas Eve profits were given to charity.<ref>Federal Writers Project, p.164</ref>\n\nOther well-known venues in the Tenderloin included [[Koster and Bial's Music Hall]] at [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] and 23rd Street, a concert saloon where inebriated customers could watch the [[can-can]] being performed; the Haymarket, a dance hall on Sixth below 30th Street, where rich clients could dance with prostitutes, but not too closely, although they could take them into curtained-off galleries to have discreet sex, and sex exhibitions were on display in the balconies; West 29th Street, which featured an almost uninterrupted row of brothels; and the many gambling dens run by [[John Daly (gambler)|John Daly]] or the [[Madison Square]] Club of [[Richard A. Canfield]] on West 26th Street.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp. 1148\u20131149</ref>\n\n[[File:Czar of the Tenderloin.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The cover of the [[sheet music]] for a popular 1897 song shows a police [[billy club]] and uses \"Clubber\" Williams' nickname: \"The Czar of the Tenderloin\"]]\n[[File:Anthony Comstock.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Anthony Comstock]], anti-vice crusader]]\n\nThe \"Main Street\" of the district was [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] between 23rd and 42nd Streets, which was known as \"The Line\". In the mid-1890s, after the advent of electric lighting, the stretch of Broadway from 23rd Street to [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] came to be called \"[[The Great White Way]]\" because of the numerous illuminated advertising signs there.  This moniker was transferred to [[Times Square]] when the theater district moved uptown.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p.1066</ref>\n\n=== Crime ===\nCrime was also a major aspect of the Tenderloin, which was considered to be the worst crime-ridden area of what was thought to be the most crime-ridden city of the United States.<ref name=nyclpc /> To a certain extent, [[police corruption]] kept crime under control as it regularized the financial relationship between the police and the criminals, but the area was too large, and the pickings too easy, for [[street crime]] to be managed completely.  In 1906, [[William McAdoo (New Jersey)|William McAdoo]], who was the city's Police Commissioner in 1904 and 1905, wrote that the \"Tenderloin [police] precinct, as every one knows, is the most important precinct in New York, if not in the United States, or probably in the world, from the amount of police business done there and from the character of the neighborhood.\"<ref name=nyclpc />\n\nOccasionally there would be organized attempts to clean up the Tenderloin, and reformist mayors, such as [[William Russell Grace]] and [[Abram S. Hewitt]], would authorize raids on saloons and brothels, even those under the protection of \"Clubber\" Williams, but the effects were generally temporary: prostitutes would decamp to outlying areas, and return when the latest crusade was over. The net effect of these \"shake-ups\" or \"shake-downs\" was simply to drive up the cost of protection afterwards, making Williams even richer &ndash; he retired a millionaire &ndash; and putting more money into the pockets of [[Tammany Hall]], which was deeply entwined in the graft and corruption connected with the district.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p.1163</ref>\n\nFrustration at this state of affairs led to [[Anthony Comstock]]'s anti-vice crusade, which operated with [[United States government|Federal]] authority from the [[United States Postal Service|Post Office]] and with the support of the New York [[Chamber of Commerce]] and leading citizens such as [[J. P. Morgan]]. Comstock's crusade knew no boundaries &ndash; he was as likely to target \"smut\" in the public libraries as he was sex-for-hire in the Tenderloin &ndash; but along with Rev. Talmage, he was able to get state legislation passed banning [[pool halls]], even though they continued to operate openly.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp. 1163\u20131165</ref>\n\nAside from its commercial activities, the Tenderloin was also the home neighborhood for a large part of Manhattan's [[African American]] population,<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p.1112</ref> especially in the downtown and western portion of the district: Seventh Avenue within the Tenderloin, in fact, became known as the \"African Broadway\".<ref name=nyclpc /> This was a neighborhood of blacks with [[American middle class|middle class]] aspirations.\n\n==== {{anchor|Race riot}} Race riot ====\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.
