Of these, 34% (541,711) are registered Republicans, and 33.3% (529,651) are registered Democrats. An additional 28.5% (453,343) declined to state a political party.<ref name=\"voterstats\">{{cite web|url=https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ror/ror-odd-year-2019/politicalsub.pdf|title=Report of Registration Odd-Number Year Report by political subdivision|date=2019-02-10|publisher=California Secretary of State|accessdate=2019-06-10}}</ref>\n\nOrange County has produced such notable Republicans as President [[Richard Nixon]] (born in [[Yorba Linda, California|Yorba Linda]] and lived in [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]] and [[San Clemente, California|San Clemente]]), U.S. Senator [[John F. Seymour]] (previously [[mayor of Anaheim, California|mayor of Anaheim]]), and U.S. Senator [[Thomas Kuchel]] (of Anaheim). Former Congressman [[Christopher Cox]] (of Newport Beach), a White House counsel for President Reagan, is also a former chairman of the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]. Orange County was also home to former Republican Congressman [[John G. Schmitz]], a presidential candidate in 1972 from the ultra-conservative [[American Independent Party]] and the father of [[Mary Kay Letourneau]]. In 1996, [[Curt Pringle]] (later mayor of Anaheim) became the first Republican Speaker of the [[California State Assembly]] in decades.\n\nWhile the growth of the county's [[Hispanic]] and [[Asian people|Asian]] populations in recent decades has significantly influenced Orange County's culture, its conservative reputation has remained largely intact. Partisan voter registration patterns of Hispanics, Asians and other ethnic minorities in the county have tended to reflect the surrounding demographics, with resultant Republican majorities in all but the central portion of the county. When [[Loretta Sanchez]], a [[Blue Dog Coalition|Blue Dog Democrat]], defeated veteran Republican [[Bob Dornan]] in 1996, she was continuing a trend of Democratic representation of that district that had been interrupted by Dornan's 1984 upset of former Congressman [[Jerry M. Patterson|Jerry Patterson]]. Until 1992, Sanchez herself was a moderate Republican, and she is viewed as somewhat more moderate than other Democrats from Southern California.\n\nIn 2004, [[George W. Bush]] captured 60% of the county's vote, up from 56% in 2000 despite a higher Democratic popular vote statewide. Although [[Barbara Boxer]] won statewide, and fared better in Orange County than she did in 1998, Republican [[Bill Jones (California politician)|Bill Jones]] defeated her in the county, 51% to 43%. While the 39% that [[John Kerry]] received is higher than the percentage [[Bill Clinton]] won in 1992 or 1996, the percentage of the vote George W. Bush received in 2004 (60%) is the highest any presidential candidate has received since 1988, showing a still-dominant GOP presence in the county. In 2006, Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] won 45% of the vote in the county, the best showing of a Democrat in a Senate race in over four decades, but Orange was nevertheless the only [[Coastal California]] county to vote for her Republican opponent, [[Dick Mountjoy]].\n\nThe county is featured prominently in Lisa McGirr's book ''Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right''. She argues that its conservative political orientation in the 20th century owed much to its settlement by farmers from the [[Great Plains]], who reacted strongly to communist sympathies, the [[civil rights movement]], and the turmoil of the 1960s in nearby Los Angeles \u2014 across the \"[[Orange Curtain]]\".\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Orange County was one of California's leading Republican voting blocs and a subculture of residents with \"Middle American\" values that emphasized capitalist religious morality{{clarify|date=November 2012}} in contrast to [[San Francisco values|West coast liberalism]].\n\nOrange County has many Republican voters from culturally conservative [[Asian Americans|Asian-American]], [[Middle Eastern Americans|Middle Eastern]] and Latino immigrant groups. The large [[Vietnamese Americans|Vietnamese-American]] communities in [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]] and [[Westminster, California|Westminster]] are predominantly Republican; Vietnamese Americans registered Republicans outnumber those registered as Democrats, 55% to 22% as of 2007, while as of 2017 that figure is 42% to 36%. Republican Assemblyman [[Van Tran]] was the first Vietnamese-American elected to a state legislature and joined with Texan [[Hubert Vo]] as the highest-ranking elected Vietnamese-American in the United States until the 2008 election of [[Joseph Cao]] in [[Louisiana's 2nd congressional district]]. In the 2007 special election for the vacant county supervisor seat following Democrat [[Lou Correa]]'s election to the state senate, two Vietnamese-American Republican candidates topped the list of 10 candidates, separated from each other by only seven votes, making the [[Orange County Board of Supervisors]] entirely Republican; Correa is first of only two Democrats to have served on the Board since 1987 and only the fifth since 1963.\n\nEven with the Democratic sweep of Orange County's congressional seats in 2018, as well as a steady trend of Democratic gains in voter registration, the county remains very Republican downballot. In much of the county, the district's congressperson is the only elected Democrat above the county level, and in some cases the only elected Democrat above the municipal level. Generally, larger cities\u2013those with a population over 100,000, such as Anaheim, Santa Ana, and Irvine - feature a registration advantage for Democrats, while the other municipalities still have a Republican voter registration advantage. This is especially true in Newport Beach, Yorba Linda, and Villa Park, the three cities where the Republican advantage is largest. As of February 10, 2019, the only exceptions to the former are Huntington Beach and Orange, while exceptions to the latter include Buena Park, Laguna Beach and Stanton.<ref name=\"voterstats\" />\n\n===Voter registration===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | Population and registered voters\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Total population<ref name=\"US-CB-B02001\" />\n| colspan=\"2\" | 3,172,532\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | &nbsp;&nbsp;Registered voters<ref name=\"CA-SS\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ror/ror-pages/ror-odd-year-2013/political-sub.pdf |title=February 10, 2013 - Report of Registration |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=California Secretary of State |access-date=October 31, 2013 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103114419/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ror/ror-pages/ror-odd-year-2013/political-sub.pdf |archive-date=November 3, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"PCT-RV\" group=note>Percentage of registered voters with respect to total population.

Of these, 34% (541,711) are registered Republicans, and 33.3% (529,651) are registered Democrats. An additional 28.5% (453,343) declined to state a political party.<ref name=\"voterstats\">{{cite web|url=https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ror/ror-odd-year-2019/politicalsub.pdf|title=Report of Registration Odd-Number Year Report by political subdivision|date=2019-02-10|publisher=California Secretary of State|accessdate=2019-06-10}}</ref>\n\nOrange County has produced such notable Republicans as President [[Richard Nixon]] (born in [[Yorba Linda, California|Yorba Linda]] and lived in [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]] and [[San Clemente, California|San Clemente]]), U.S. Senator [[John F. Seymour]] (previously [[mayor of Anaheim, California|mayor of Anaheim]]), and U.S. Senator [[Thomas Kuchel]] (of Anaheim). Former Congressman [[Christopher Cox]] (of Newport Beach), a White House counsel for President Reagan, is also a former chairman of the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]. Orange County was also home to former Republican Congressman [[John G. Schmitz]], a presidential candidate in 1972 from the ultra-conservative [[American Independent Party]] and the father of [[Mary Kay Letourneau]]. In 1996, [[Curt Pringle]] (later mayor of Anaheim) became the first Republican Speaker of the [[California State Assembly]] in decades.\n\nWhile the growth of the county's [[Hispanic]] and [[Asian people|Asian]] populations in recent decades has significantly influenced Orange County's culture, its conservative reputation has remained largely intact. Partisan voter registration patterns of Hispanics, Asians and other ethnic minorities in the county have tended to reflect the surrounding demographics, with resultant Republican majorities in all but the central portion of the county. When [[Loretta Sanchez]], a [[Blue Dog Coalition|Blue Dog Democrat]], defeated veteran Republican [[Bob Dornan]] in 1996, she was continuing a trend of Democratic representation of that district that had been interrupted by Dornan's 1984 upset of former Congressman [[Jerry M. Patterson|Jerry Patterson]]. Until 1992, Sanchez herself was a moderate Republican, and she is viewed as somewhat more moderate than other Democrats from Southern California.\n\nIn 2004, [[George W. Bush]] captured 60% of the county's vote, up from 56% in 2000 despite a higher Democratic popular vote statewide. Although [[Barbara Boxer]] won statewide, and fared better in Orange County than she did in 1998, Republican [[Bill Jones (California politician)|Bill Jones]] defeated her in the county, 51% to 43%. While the 39% that [[John Kerry]] received is higher than the percentage [[Bill Clinton]] won in 1992 or 1996, the percentage of the vote George W. Bush received in 2004 (60%) is the highest any presidential candidate has received since 1988, showing a still-dominant GOP presence in the county. In 2006, Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] won 45% of the vote in the county, the best showing of a Democrat in a Senate race in over four decades, but Orange was nevertheless the only [[Coastal California]] county to vote for her Republican opponent, [[Dick Mountjoy]].\n\nThe county is featured prominently in Lisa McGirr's book ''Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right''. She argues that its conservative political orientation in the 20th century owed much to its settlement by farmers from the [[Great Plains]], who reacted strongly to communist sympathies, the [[civil rights movement]], and the turmoil of the 1960s in nearby Los Angeles \u2014 across the \"[[Orange Curtain]]\".\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Orange County was one of California's leading Republican voting blocs and a subculture of residents with \"Middle American\" values that emphasized capitalist religious morality{{clarify|date=November 2012}} in contrast to [[San Francisco values|West coast liberalism]].\n\nOrange County has many Republican voters from culturally conservative [[Asian Americans|Asian-American]], [[Middle Eastern Americans|Middle Eastern]] and Latino immigrant groups. The large [[Vietnamese Americans|Vietnamese-American]] communities in [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]] and [[Westminster, California|Westminster]] are predominantly Republican; Vietnamese Americans registered Republicans outnumber those registered as Democrats, 55% to 22% as of 2007, while as of 2017 that figure is 42% to 36%. Republican Assemblyman [[Van Tran]] was the first Vietnamese-American elected to a state legislature and joined with Texan [[Hubert Vo]] as the highest-ranking elected Vietnamese-American in the United States until the 2008 election of [[Joseph Cao]] in [[Louisiana's 2nd congressional district]]. In the 2007 special election for the vacant county supervisor seat following Democrat [[Lou Correa]]'s election to the state senate, two Vietnamese-American Republican candidates topped the list of 10 candidates, separated from each other by only seven votes, making the [[Orange County Board of Supervisors]] entirely Republican; Correa is first of only two Democrats to have served on the Board since 1987 and only the fifth since 1963.\n\nEven with the Democratic sweep of Orange County's congressional seats in 2018, as well as a steady trend of Democratic gains in voter registration, the county remains very Republican downballot. In much of the county, the district's congressperson is the only elected Democrat above the county level, and in some cases the only elected Democrat above the municipal level. Generally, larger cities\u2013those with a population over 100,000, such as Anaheim, Santa Ana, and Irvine - feature a registration advantage for Democrats, while the other municipalities still have a Republican voter registration advantage. This is especially true in Newport Beach, Yorba Linda, and Villa Park, the three cities where the Republican advantage is largest. As of February 10, 2019, the only exceptions to the former are Huntington Beach and Orange, while exceptions to the latter include Buena Park, Laguna Beach and Stanton.<ref name=\"voterstats\" />\n\n===Voter registration===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | Population and registered voters\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Total population<ref name=\"US-CB-B02001\" />\n| colspan=\"2\" | 3,172,532\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | &nbsp;&nbsp;Registered voters<ref name=\"CA-SS\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ror/ror-pages/ror-odd-year-2013/political-sub.pdf |title=February 10, 2013 - Report of Registration |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=California Secretary of State |access-date=October 31, 2013 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103114419/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ror/ror-pages/ror-odd-year-2013/political-sub.pdf |archive-date=November 3, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"PCT-RV\" group=note>Percentage of registered voters with respect to total population.
