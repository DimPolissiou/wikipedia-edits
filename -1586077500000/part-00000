In 1800 [[Alessandro Volta]] constructed a [[voltaic pile]], the first device to produce a large electric current, later known as the [[electric battery]]. [[Napoleon]], informed of his works, summoned him in 1801 for a command performance of his experiments. He received many medals and decorations, including the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]].\n\nAlso in 1800, [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]] and [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter]] succeeded in decomposing water into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] by [[electrolysis]]. Soon thereafter Ritter discovered the process of [[electroplating]]. He also observed that the amount of metal deposited and the amount of oxygen produced during an electrolytic process depended on the distance between the [[electrode]]s. By 1801 Ritter observed [[thermoelectricity|thermoelectric currents]] and anticipated the discovery of thermoelectricity by [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]].\n\nIn 1806, [[Humphry Davy]] decomposed potash and soda, employing a voltaic pile of approximately 250 cells, showing that these substances were respectively the oxides of potassium and sodium, which metals previously had been unknown. Employing a battery of 2,000 elements of a voltaic pile and charcoal enclosed in a vacuum, Davy gave the first public demonstration of the electric [[arc lamp]] in 1809.<ref name=\"EncyclopediaAmericana\">Maver, William Jr.: \"Electricity, its History and Progress\", [https://archive.org/stream/encyclopediaame21unkngoog#page/n210/mode/1up The Encyclopedia Americana; a library of universal knowledge, vol.

Later, in 1807, [[Robert Fulton]]'s ''[[North River Steamboat]]'', the world's first commercially successful steamboat, made her maiden voyage.\n\nIn [[1801]], [[Richard Trevithick]] ran a full-sized steam '[[Traction engine#Road locomotive|road locomotive]]' on the road in [[Camborne|Camborne, England]],<ref name=\"buchanan\">{{cite book\n|author=C.D.

In 1800 [[Alessandro Volta]] constructed a [[voltaic pile]], the first device to produce a large electric current, later known as the [[electric battery]]. [[Napoleon]], informed of his works, summoned him in 1801 for a command performance of his experiments. He received many medals and decorations, including the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]].\n\nAlso in 1800, [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]] and [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter]] succeeded in decomposing water into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] by [[electrolysis]]. Soon thereafter Ritter discovered the process of [[electroplating]]. He also observed that the amount of metal deposited and the amount of oxygen produced during an electrolytic process depended on the distance between the [[electrode]]s. By 1801 Ritter observed [[thermoelectricity|thermoelectric currents]] and anticipated the discovery of thermoelectricity by [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]].\n\nIn 1806, [[Humphry Davy]] decomposed potash and soda, employing a voltaic pile of approximately 250 cells, showing that these substances were respectively the oxides of potassium and sodium, which metals previously had been unknown. Employing a battery of 2,000 elements of a voltaic pile and charcoal enclosed in a vacuum, Davy gave the first public demonstration of the electric [[arc lamp]] in 1809.<ref name=\"EncyclopediaAmericana\">Maver, William Jr.: \"Electricity, its History and Progress\", [https://archive.org/stream/encyclopediaame21unkngoog#page/n210/mode/1up The Encyclopedia Americana; a library of universal knowledge, vol.

Higher p''K''<sub>\u0251</sub>s of the tropane nitrogen (8.65 for cocaine, 9.55 for troparil & 11.95 for vinyl analogue '''43a'''), decreased aqueous solvation & decreased conformational flexibility added to increased binding affinity.{{efn|<ref name=\"Singh2\"/> \u2190[https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/pdf/cocaineanalogs.pdf#25 Page #949 (25th page of article)] 3rd \u00b6, 20th line}}\n\n[[File:WIN 35,065-2.svg|x150px]]\n[[File:WF-31.svg|x170px]]\n[[File:RTI-11W.svg|x150px]]\n[[File:WF-23.svg|x160px]]\n\nDespite the observation of increased stimulation, phenyltropanes lack the local anesthetic sodium channel blocking effect that the benzoyloxy imparts to cocaine. Beside topical affect, this gives cocaine an affinity for binding to sites on the dopamine and serotonin sodium dependent transport areas that are distinct & specific to MAT in contrast to the general sodium channels; creating a separate mechanism of relational affinity to the transporters in addition to its inhibition of the reuptake for those transporters; this is unique to the local anesthetic value in cocaine & analogues with a similar substitute for the benzoyloxy that leaves the sodium channel blockage ability intact. Rendering such compounds as different functionally in their relation to MAT contrasted to phenyltropane analogues which have the local anesthetic bridge removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00907 |title=Drugbank website \"drug card\", \"(DB00907)\" for Cocaine: Giving ten targets of the molecule in vivo, including dopamine/serotonin sodium channel affinity & K-opioid affinity |publisher=Drugbank.ca |accessdate=9 March 2010}}</ref> (Requiring some of the sodium ions to be pumped from the axon via [[Na+/K+-ATPase]]).

It received three [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners|title=71st Emmy Awards Nominees and Winners|website=[[Emmy Awards|emmys.com]]|access-date=July 27, 2019}}</ref> and was also picked by [[Lena Headey]] to support her nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goldderby.com/article/2019/lena-headey-game-of-thrones-2019-emmy-awards-episode-drama-supporting-actress/|title=Lena Headey (\u2018Game of Thrones\u2019) 2019 Emmy Awards episode revealed for Best Drama Supporting Actress (Exclusive)|last=Beachum|first=Chris|last2=Beachum|first2=Chris|date=2019-07-29|website=GoldDerby|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-10}}</ref> It eventually was awarded the prizes for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Fantasy/Sci-Fi Costumes|Outstanding Fantasy/Sci-Fi Costumes]] and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects|Outstanding Special Visual Effects]].\n\n==Plot==\n===At Dragonstone===\nVarys writes a letter about Jon Snow's true heritage when one of his \"little birds\" informs him that Daenerys continues to refuse food. He tells her to \"try again at supper\". Varys implores Jon to take the Iron Throne, but Jon refuses to betray Daenerys. Tyrion informs Daenerys of Varys' plot, and she has Drogon burn him alive. Daenerys bemoans not having the people's love in Westeros. Jon assures Daenerys that he loves her, but refuses to kiss her, and Daenerys resigns herself to fear. Tyrion implores Daenerys to spare the commoners of [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire#King's Landing|King's Landing]] if the city bells ring (indicating surrender), which she appears to accept. She informs Tyrion that Jaime has been captured on his way to King's Landing and warns Tyrion not to fail her again.\n\n===At King's Landing===\nTyrion arrives at the Targaryen forces' camp and frees Jaime so Jaime can take Cersei to Pentos and live safely in seclusion.\n\nThe next day, [[Arya Stark]] and [[Sandor Clegane]] enter the Red Keep amongst the civilians Cersei is using as human shields. The battle begins with Daenerys and Drogon burning the Iron Fleet, the Golden Company, and the city's defenses. Grey Worm kills Harry Strickland, and Daenerys' army storms King's Landing. Outmatched, the Lannister forces drop their weapons and ring the bells. Daenerys, however, does not accept it and, atop Drogon, lays waste to the city, while Grey Worm and the Unsullied massacre the unarmed Lannister soldiers. Horrified by this turn of events, Jon unsuccessfully tries to stop his men from attacking before he and Davos have them fall back as the city burns.\n\nAs Jaime infiltrates the Red Keep he encounters and fights Euron, washed ashore; he mortally wounds Euron, but is wounded himself. Sandor convinces Arya to give up her desire for revenge against Cersei and they part ways as friends. As Cersei and Qyburn attempt to escape, Sandor arrives and kills the Queensguard in order to fight his brother, the Mountain. Gregor kills Qyburn when he attempts to intervene and Cersei flees. The Mountain proves to be resistant to all Sandor's attacks, forcing him to tackle him through a wall to their deaths in the flames below. Jaime reunites with Cersei, but they find their escape passage is blocked by rubble. Jaime comforts Cersei as the Red Keep collapses on them.\n\nArya experiences the chaos in King's Landing and tries to help the smallfolk she encounters but is knocked unconscious when a bell tower falls near her. When she comes to, she discovers the burned corpses of smallfolk on the street. She encounters Harry Strickland's horse and rides it out of the city.\n\n== Production ==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=250\n | width1 = 114\n | image1 = Conleth Hill by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n | alt1   = Conleth Hill\n | image2 = Rory McCann by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n | alt2   = Rory McCann\n | footer = [[Conleth Hill]] (''left'') and [[Rory McCann]] (''right'') made their final appearances in the series.\n}}\n\n=== Writing ===\nThe episode was written by [[David Benioff]] and [[D.

He tells her to \"try again at supper\". Varys implores Jon to take the Iron Throne, but Jon refuses to betray Daenerys. [[Tyrion Lannister]] informs Daenerys of Varys' plot; she executes Varys. When Daenerys says she does not have the people's love in Westeros, Jon assures Daenerys he loves her. However, when he stops her kiss, Daenerys resigns herself to fear. Tyrion implores Daenerys to spare the common folk in [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire#King's Landing|King's Landing]] if the city bells ring, and she nods toward Grey Worm. She informs Tyrion that [[Jaime Lannister]] has been captured on his way to King's Landing and warns Tyrion not to fail her again.\n\n===At King's Landing===\nTyrion arrives at the Unsullied camp and frees Jaime so Jaime can take [[Cersei Lannister]] away from King's Landing to Pentos and live safely in seclusion. Jaime agrees and makes for the Red Keep.\n\nThe next day, [[Arya Stark]] and [[Sandor Clegane]] enter the Red Keep. The battle begins with Daenerys and Drogon burning [[Euron Greyjoy]]'s Iron Fleet, the Golden Company, and the city's defenses. Grey Worm kills Harry Strickland. When Daenerys' army storms King's Landing, the remaining Lannister forces drop their weapons and ring the bells to signal their surrender. Daenerys, however, does not accept it and, atop Drogon, lays waste to the city, while Grey Worm and the Unsullied massacre the unarmed Lannister soldiers. Horrified by this turn of events, Jon unsuccessfully tries to stop his men from attacking before he and [[Davos Seaworth]] have them fall back as the city burns.\n\nAs Jaime infiltrates the Red Keep he encounters and fights Euron, washed ashore; he mortally wounds Euron, but wounded himself. Sandor convinces Arya to give up her desire for revenge against Cersei and they part ways as friends. As Cersei and Qyburn attempt to escape, Sandor arrives and kills the Queensguard in order to fight his brother, [[Gregor Clegane]]. Gregor kills Qyburn and Cersei flees. Gregor resists all attacks, forcing Sandor to tackle him through a wall, and the brothers fall to their deaths in the fire below. Jaime reunites with Cersei, but find their escape passage is blocked by rubble from the attack. Jaime comforts Cersei as the Keep's cellar ceiling collapses on them.\n\nArya experiences the chaos in King's Landing and tries to help the smallfolk she encounters but is knocked unconscious when a bell tower falls near her. When she wakes up, she discovers the burned corpses of the smallfolk on the street. She encounters Harry Strickland's horse and rides it out of the city.\n\n== Production ==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=250\n | width1 = 114\n | image1 = Conleth Hill by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n | alt1   = Conleth Hill\n | image2 = Rory McCann by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n | alt2   = Rory McCann\n | footer = [[Conleth Hill]] (''left'') and [[Rory McCann]] (''right'') made their final appearances in the series.\n}}\n\n=== Writing ===\nThe episode was written by [[David Benioff]] and [[D.

It was written by Adele and [[Dan Wilson (musician)|Dan Wilson]] for her second studio album, ''[[21 (Adele album)|21]]''. It is the second single and final track on the album. The song was inspired by a broken relationship, and lyrically speaks of Adele's coming to terms with it. [[XL Recordings]] released the song as the second single from the album on 24 January 2011 (the same day the album was released) in the United Kingdom and on 9 August 2011 in the United States. Accompanied only by a piano in the song (played by co-writer Wilson), Adele sings about the end of the relationship with her ex-boyfriend. The song received widespread critical acclaim, with critics choosing the song as a highlight of ''21'' and praised the lyrics, its simple sound and Adele's vocal performance.\n\nFollowing a well-received performance of the song at the [[2011 Brit Awards]], \"Someone like You\" became Adele's first number-one single in the UK and stayed on the top of the chart for five weeks. The song also topped the charts in Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Brazil, Italy, France and Switzerland, and has become Adele's second number one in the US. With that achievement Adele became the first female British solo singer in the history of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] to have two number ones from the same album. In July 2011, it became the first single of the decade to sell a million units in the UK and it was certified 4\u00d7 Platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI), as well as being certified 6\u00d7 Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in the US. As of 2018, Someone Like You has sold over 17 million copies worldwide making it [[List of best-selling singles|one of the best-selling digital single of all-time]].\n\nAn accompanying [[music video]] for the song was directed by [[Jake Nava]] and filmed in [[Paris]], France. The video showed Adele walking alone through the streets with a sad look on her face. Critics praised the video for being simple and perfect for the sound of the song. Adele performed the song on several award and television shows including the [[2011 Brit Awards]], [[2011 MTV Video Music Awards]], ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', and the song was played on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] hit show ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''. She added the song to the [[set list]] of her second tour [[Adele Live]]. The live performances of the song were heavily praised by music critics and fans. The song has been covered by [[Katy Perry]], [[Taio Cruz]], the cast of the series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', and several other artists.\n\nIn a list voted for by the public in conjunction with the [[Official Charts Company]]'s 60th anniversary, \"Someone like You\" was voted the third-most favourite number-one single of the last 60 years in the UK, with [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Billie Jean]]\" voted number two and [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\" as number one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/queen/64932|title=Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody' named as 'UK's Favourite Number One single'|author=NME.COM|work=NME.COM}}</ref> \"Someone like You\" is the 36th-best-selling single in the history of the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-million-sellers-the-uks-biggest-ever-selling-singles-revealed-1685/ |title=The Million Sellers \u2013 the UK's biggest ever selling singles revealed! |first=Dan |last=Lane |work=[[Official Charts Company]] |date=4 November 2012 |accessdate=10 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CECrCLiO?url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-million-sellers-the-uks-biggest-ever-selling-singles-revealed-1685/ |archivedate=16 November 2012 }}</ref> As a critically successful song, \"Someone like You\" appeared on many year-end lists about the best songs of 2011, topping it in the UK. \"Someone like You\" was the first recipient of the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance]], at the [[2012 Grammy Awards|54th Grammy Awards]], held on 12 February 2012.

I was really emotionally drained from the way I was portraying him, because even though I'm very bitter and regret some parts of it, he's still the most important person that's ever been in my life, and 'Someone like You,' I had to write it to feel OK with myself and OK with the two years I spent with him.

Whereas that was about me saying, 'I'm going to be fine without you', this is me on my knees really.\"<ref name=\"Levine\"/> She discussed further the inspiration of the song: \"I can imagine being about 40 and looking for him again, only to turn up and find that he's settled with a beautiful wife and beautiful kids and he's completely happy... and I'm still on my own. The song's about that and I'm scared at the thought of that.\"<ref name=\"Levine\"/>\n\nAdele had said that she began writing it on her acoustic guitar in the wake of the break-up of her 18-month relationship with the 30-year-old man she thought she would marry. A few months after their split, he was engaged to someone else. \"We were so intense I thought we would get married. But that was something he never wanted... So when I found out he does want that with someone else, it was just the horrible-est feeling ever. But after I wrote it, I felt more at peace. It set me free... I didn't think it would resonate... with the world! I'm never gonna write a song like that again. I think that's the song I'll be known for.\"<ref name=\"Peterson1\">{{harvnb|Peterson|2011|p=93}}</ref> She also said that \"I wrote that song on the end of my bed. I had a cold.

Prior to meeting with Wilson, Adele said she wrote some of the lyrics using her acoustic guitar.<ref name=\"KMTT\">Adkins, Adele. [[KHTP|KMTT]]. Personal Interview by Shawn Stewart. December 2010.</ref> The two sat around the piano for two days and brainstormed various melodies and lyrics, and ultimately decided to keep the musical production sparse: \"We just wrote it on the piano and then we recorded it when it was written. It wasn't sort of like recording it and listening to it thinking 'where can we go next?' It was really old school.\"<ref name=\"KMTT\" /> During an interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Wilson stated that while writing the song, they wanted to make it as personal as possible.<ref name=\"bil1005\" /> He added \"We didn't try to make it open-ended so it could apply to 'anybody.' We tried to make it as personal as possible. She may not have had a melodic hook or a specific lyrical idea, but she always knew what she wanted to say. She definitely had a master plan.\"<ref name=\"bil1005\" /> The song was recorded at Harmony Studios in West [[Hollywood, California]] with Wilson playing piano.

And though she's heartbroken, she puts on a brave face, stubbornly proclaiming she'll find someone just like him, even if she knows that she never will.

It was written by Adele and [[Dan Wilson (musician)|Dan Wilson]] for her second studio album, ''[[21 (Adele album)|21]]''. It is the second single and final track on the album. The song was inspired by a broken relationship, and lyrically speaks of Adele's coming to terms with it. [[XL Recordings]] released the song as the second single from the album on 24 January 2011 (the same day the album was released) in the United Kingdom and on 9 August 2011 in the United States. Accompanied only by a piano in the song (played by co-writer Wilson), Adele sings about the end of the relationship with her ex-boyfriend. The song received widespread critical acclaim, with critics choosing the song as a highlight of ''21'' and praised the lyrics, its simple sound and Adele's vocal performance.\n\nFollowing a well-received performance of the song at the [[2011 Brit Awards]], \"Someone like You\" became Adele's first number-one single in the UK and stayed on the top of the chart for five weeks. The song also topped the charts in Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Brazil, Italy, France and Switzerland, and has become Adele's second number one in the US. With that achievement Adele became the first female British solo singer in the history of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] to have two number ones from the same album. In July 2011, it became the first single of the decade to sell a million units in the UK and it was certified 4\u00d7 Platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI), as well as being certified 6\u00d7 Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in the US. As of 2018, Someone Like You has sold over 17 million copies worldwide making it [[List of best-selling singles|one of the best-selling digital single of all-time]].\n\nAn accompanying [[music video]] for the song was directed by [[Jake Nava]] and filmed in [[Paris]], France. The video showed Adele walking alone through the streets with a sad look on her face. Critics praised the video for being simple and perfect for the sound of the song. Adele performed the song on several award and television shows including the [[2011 Brit Awards]], [[2011 MTV Video Music Awards]], ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', and the song was played on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] hit show ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''. She added the song to the [[set list]] of her second tour [[Adele Live]]. The live performances of the song were heavily praised by music critics and fans. The song has been covered by [[Katy Perry]], [[Taio Cruz]], the cast of the series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', and several other artists.\n\nIn a list voted for by the public in conjunction with the [[Official Charts Company]]'s 60th anniversary, \"Someone like You\" was voted the third-most favourite number-one single of the last 60 years in the UK, with [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Billie Jean]]\" voted number two and [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\" as number one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/queen/64932|title=Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody' named as 'UK's Favourite Number One single'|author=NME.COM|work=NME.COM}}</ref> \"Someone like You\" is the 36th-best-selling single in the history of the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-million-sellers-the-uks-biggest-ever-selling-singles-revealed-1685/ |title=The Million Sellers \u2013 the UK's biggest ever selling singles revealed! |first=Dan |last=Lane |work=[[Official Charts Company]] |date=4 November 2012 |accessdate=10 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CECrCLiO?url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-million-sellers-the-uks-biggest-ever-selling-singles-revealed-1685/ |archivedate=16 November 2012 }}</ref> As a critically successful song, \"Someone like You\" appeared on many year-end lists about the best songs of 2011, topping it in the UK. \"Someone like You\" was the first recipient of the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance]], at the [[2012 Grammy Awards|54th Grammy Awards]], held on 12 February 2012.

I was really emotionally drained from the way I was portraying him, because even though I'm very bitter and regret some parts of it, he's still the most important person that's ever been in my life, and 'Someone like You,' I had to write it to feel OK with myself and OK with the two years I spent with him.

Whereas that was about me saying, 'I'm going to be fine without you', this is me on my knees really.\"<ref name=\"Levine\"/> She discussed further the inspiration of the song: \"I can imagine being about 40 and looking for him again, only to turn up and find that he's settled with a beautiful wife and beautiful kids and he's completely happy... and I'm still on my own. The song's about that and I'm scared at the thought of that.\"<ref name=\"Levine\"/>\n\nAdele had said that she began writing it on her acoustic guitar in the wake of the break-up of her 18-month relationship with the 30-year-old man she thought she would marry. A few months after their split, he was engaged to someone else. \"We were so intense I thought we would get married. But that was something he never wanted... So when I found out he does want that with someone else, it was just the horrible-est feeling ever. But after I wrote it, I felt more at peace. It set me free... I didn't think it would resonate... with the world! I'm never gonna write a song like that again. I think that's the song I'll be known for.\"<ref name=\"Peterson1\">{{harvnb|Peterson|2011|p=93}}</ref> She also said that \"I wrote that song on the end of my bed. I had a cold.

Prior to meeting with Wilson, Adele said she wrote some of the lyrics using her acoustic guitar.<ref name=\"KMTT\">Adkins, Adele. [[KHTP|KMTT]]. Personal Interview by Shawn Stewart. December 2010.</ref> The two sat around the piano for two days and brainstormed various melodies and lyrics, and ultimately decided to keep the musical production sparse: \"We just wrote it on the piano and then we recorded it when it was written. It wasn't sort of like recording it and listening to it thinking 'where can we go next?' It was really old school.\"<ref name=\"KMTT\" /> During an interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Wilson stated that while writing the song, they wanted to make it as personal as possible.<ref name=\"bil1005\" /> He added \"We didn't try to make it open-ended so it could apply to 'anybody.' We tried to make it as personal as possible. She may not have had a melodic hook or a specific lyrical idea, but she always knew what she wanted to say. She definitely had a master plan.\"<ref name=\"bil1005\" /> The song was recorded at Harmony Studios in West [[Hollywood, California]] with Wilson playing piano.

And that conclusion makes you ache not only because it's so daunting, but because it's so real. We've all felt that way, tried to trick ourselves into thinking that any other outcome was possible.

Boukouvalas published in 1905 in Cairo a brief brochure under the title \"The language of the Bulgarophones in Macedonia\" (1905). This essay, which assumed the Slav character of the foreign-language idioms of Greek Macedonia by naming them \"Bulgarian\", included a long list of Slavic words with Greek roots which are used in the dialects. ... Konstantinos Tsioulkas published in 1907 in Athens a book over 350 pages in length to prove the ancient Greek character of the idioms in Greek Macecionia!... : \"Contributions to the bilinguism of the Macedonians by comparison of the Slav'-like Macedonian language to Greek\" ... Tsioulkas \"proved\" through a series of \"etymological\" lists that the inhabitants of Greece's Macedonia spoke a pure Ancient-Greek dialect. ... In 1948 by a third teacher, Giorgos Georgiades, (wrote) under the promising title \"The mixed idiom in Macedonia and the ethnological situation of the Macedonians who speak it\". Here it is stated that many words from the dialects maintain their \"Ancient Greek character\". Still, the language itself was presented as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and words borrowed from other languages. As a result, the author found himself incapable of defining it as either Greek or Slav. In examining such publications, one will easily recognise ideological and methodological similarities. One common factor for all the authors is that they ignored not only the dialects they wrote about, but also the Slavic languages entirely. This fact did not hinder them in creating or republishing etymological lists tracing every Slavic word back to Ancient Greek with fictional correlations.}}</ref> Among them, Boukouvalas promoted an enormous influence of the [[Greek language]] on a Bulgarian idiom and a discussion about their probable Greek descent.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> Tsioulkas followed him by publishing a large book, where he \"proved\" through an \"etymological\" approach, that these idioms are a pure [[Ancient Greek]] dialect.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> A publication of the third teacher followed, Giorgos Georgiades, who presented the language as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and other loanwords, but was incapable of deifining the dialects as either Greek or Slav.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/>\n\nSerbian dialectology does not usually extend the Serbian dialects to Greek Macedonia, but an unconventional classification has been maken by [[Aleksandar Beli\u0107]], a convinced Serbian nationalist, who regarded the dialects as [[Serbian dialects|Serbian]].<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> In [[:File:Balkan dialects belic 1914.jpg|his classification]] he distinguished three categories of dialects in Greek Macedonia: a Serbo-Macedonian dialect, a Bulgaro-Macedonian teritorry where Serbian is spoken and a Non-Slavic territory.\n\n== Slavic dialects spoken in the region of [[Thrace (Greece)|Thrace]] ==\n{{Expand section|date=January 2019}}\nSome of the [[Rup dialects]] of the [[Bulgarian language]] are spoken by the [[Pomaks]] in [[Western Thrace]] in Greece.

As result the Greek communist publisher \"Nea Ellada\" issued a Macedonian grammar (1952) and developed a different alphabet.  Between 1952 and 1956, the Macedonian Department of Nea Hellas published a number of issues in this literary standard, officially called \" Macedonian language of the Slav Macedonians from Greek or Aegean Macedonia\".

Pomak is not being actively promoted neither by Pomak communities, nor by the Greek authorities.

Boukouvalas published in 1905 in Cairo a brief brochure under the title \"The language of the Bulgarophones in Macedonia\" (1905). This essay, which assumed the Slav character of the foreign-language idioms of Greek Macedonia by naming them \"Bulgarian\", included a long list of Slavic words with Greek roots which are used in the dialects. ... Konstantinos Tsioulkas published in 1907 in Athens a book over 350 pages in length to prove the ancient Greek character of the idioms in Greek Macecionia!... : \"Contributions to the bilinguism of the Macedonians by comparison of the Slav'-like Macedonian language to Greek\" ... Tsioulkas \"proved\" through a series of \"etymological\" lists that the inhabitants of Greece's Macedonia spoke a pure Ancient-Greek dialect. ... In 1948 by a third teacher, Giorgos Georgiades, (wrote) under the promising title \"The mixed idiom in Macedonia and the ethnological situation of the Macedonians who speak it\". Here it is stated that many words from the dialects maintain their \"Ancient Greek character\". Still, the language itself was presented as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and words borrowed from other languages. As a result, the author found himself incapable of defining it as either Greek or Slav. In examining such publications, one will easily recognise ideological and methodological similarities. One common factor for all the authors is that they ignored not only the dialects they wrote about, but also the Slavic languages entirely. This fact did not hinder them in creating or republishing etymological lists tracing every Slavic word back to Ancient Greek with fictional correlations.}}</ref> Among them, Boukouvalas promoted an enormous influence of the [[Greek language]] on a Bulgarian idiom and a discussion about their probable Greek descent.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> Tsioulkas followed him by publishing a large book, where he \"proved\" through an \"etymological\" approach, that these idioms are a pure [[Ancient Greek]] dialect.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> A publication of the third teacher followed, Giorgos Georgiades, who presented the language as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and other loanwords, but was incapable of deifining the dialects as either Greek or Slav.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/>\n\nSerbian dialectology does not usually extend the Serbian dialects to Greek Macedonia, but an unconventional classification has been maken by [[Aleksandar Beli\u0107]], a convinced Serbian nationalist, who regarded the dialects as [[Serbian dialects|Serbian]].<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> In [[:File:Balkan dialects belic 1914.jpg|his classification]] he distinguished three categories of dialects in Greek Macedonia: a Serbo-Macedonian dialect, a Bulgaro-Macedonian teritorry where Serbian is spoken and a Non-Slavic territory.\n\n== Slavic dialects spoken in the region of [[Thrace (Greece)|Thrace]] ==\n{{Expand section|date=January 2019}}\nSome of the [[Rup dialects]] of the [[Bulgarian language]] are spoken by the [[Pomaks]] in [[Western Thrace]] in Greece.

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}}\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825 ca|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonance and Dissonance ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are perfect consonances because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered imperfect consonances because one can make distinctions between them.\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.\n\n== Cadences ==\nThere are three cadences: Simple, Compound and Double. They are made with the scale degrees in the bass, \u2460 and \u2464.\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}}\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said Imitation|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825 ca|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonance and Dissonance ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are perfect consonances because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered imperfect consonances because one can make distinctions between them.\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.\n\n== Cadences ==\nThere are three cadences: Simple, Compound and Double. They are made with the scale degrees in the bass, \u2460 and \u2464.\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n

This gas is called a ''[[quark\u2013gluon plasma]]'' (QGP), since the quark-interaction charge ([[color charge]]) is mobile and quarks and gluons move around. This is possible because at a high temperature the early universe is in a different [[vacuum decay|vacuum state]], in which normal matter cannot exist but quarks and gluons can, they are [[deconfinement|deconfined]] (able to exist independently as separate unbound particles). In order to recreate this [[deconfinement|deconfined]] [[Phase (matter)|phase of matter]] in the laboratory it is necessary to exceed a minimum temperature, or its equivalent, a minimum [[energy density]]. Scientists achieve this using [[Relativistic nuclear collisions|particle collisions]] at extremely high speeds, where the energy released in the collision can raise the subatomic particles' energies to an exceedingly high level, sufficient for them to briefly form a tiny amount of quark-gluon plasma which can be studied in laboratory experiments for little more than the time light needs to cross the QGP fireball, thus about 10<sup>\u221222</sup> s. After this brief time the hot drop of quark plasma evaporates in a process called [[hadronization]]. This is so since practically all QGP components flow out at relativistic speed.

Therefore, any strange quarks or antiquarks observed in experiments have been \"freshly\" made from the kinetic energy of colliding nuclei. Conveniently, the [[mass]] of strange quarks and antiquarks is equivalent to the temperature or energy at which protons, neutrons and other [[hadron]]s dissolve into quarks. This means that the abundance of strange quarks is sensitive to the conditions, structure and dynamics of the deconfined matter phase, and if their number is large it can be assumed that deconfinement conditions were reached. An even stronger signature of strangeness enhancement is the highly enhanced production of [[#Strangeness (and charm) hadronization|strange antibaryons]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rafelski|first=Johann|date=|year=2015|orig-year=1980|title=Extreme states of nuclear matter - 1980: From: \u201cWorkshop on Future Relativistic Heavy Ion Experiments\u201d held 7-10 October 1980 at: GSI, Darmstadt, Germany|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1140/epja/i2015-15115-y|journal=The European Physical Journal A|language=en|volume=51|issue=9|pages=115|doi=10.1140/epja/i2015-15115-y|issn=1434-6001|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rafelski|first=Johann|date=|year=2015|orig-year=1983|title=Strangeness and phase changes in hot hadronic matter - 1983: From: \u201cSixth High Energy Heavy Ion Study\u201d held 28 June - 1 July 1983 at: LBNL, Berkeley, CA, USA|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1140/epja/i2015-15116-x|journal=The European Physical Journal A|language=en|volume=51|issue=9|pages=116|doi=10.1140/epja/i2015-15116-x|issn=1434-6001|via=}}</ref>\n\n== Equilibrium of strangeness in quark-gluon plasma ==\n\nOne cannot assume that under all conditions the yield of strange quarks is in thermal equilibrium.

The energy at RHIC is 11 times greater in the CM frame of reference compared to the earlier CERN work. The important result is that enhancement observed by STAR also increases with the number of participating nucleons. We further note that for the most peripheral events at the smallest number of participants, copper and gold systems show at the same number of participants the same enhancement as could be expected.\n\nAnother remarkable feature of these results comparing CERN and STAR is that the enhancement is of similar magnitude for the vastly different energy available in the reaction. This near energy independence of the enhancement also agrees with the quark\u2013gluon plasma approach regarding the mechanism of production of these particles and confirms that a quark\u2013gluon plasma is created over a wide range of collision energies, very probably once a minimal energy threshold is exceeded.\n\n==Horn in K-to-pi ratio and the onset of deconfinement==\n{{See also|Onset of deconfinement}}\n[[File:NA61-NA49_horn.png|thumb||280px|The ratio of mean multiplicities of positively charged [[kaon]]s and [[pion]]s as a function of collision energy in collisions of two [[lead]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and [[proton]]\u2013proton interactions]]\nOne of most interesting questions is if there is a threshold in reaction energy and/or volume size which needs to be exceeded in order to form a domain in which quarks can move freely.

Among these, heavy mesons composed of strange quarks and a heavy quark, such as [[Bottomness|bottom]] ({{Subatomic particle|Strange B|link=yes}}) or [[Charm quark|charm]] ({{Subatomic particle|Strange D|link=yes}}), are of particular interest.  The coincident high yield of charm and strangeness present at LHC will lead to copious production of {{Subatomic particle|Strange D}}.  Other heavy flavor particles, some which have not even been discovered at this time are also likely to appear.

This gas is called a ''[[quark\u2013gluon plasma]]'' (QGP), since the quark-interaction charge ([[color charge]]) is mobile and quarks and gluons move around. This is possible because at a high temperature the early universe is in a different [[vacuum decay|vacuum state]], in which normal matter cannot exist but quarks and gluons can, they are [[deconfinement|deconfined]] (able to exist independently as separate unbound particles). In order to recreate this [[deconfinement|deconfined]] [[Phase (matter)|phase of matter]] in the laboratory it is necessary to exceed a minimum temperature, or its equivalent, a minimum [[energy density]]. Scientists achieve this using [[Relativistic nuclear collisions|particle collisions]] at extremely high speeds, where the energy released in the collision can raise the subatomic particles' energies to an exceedingly high level, sufficient for them to briefly form a tiny amount of quark-gluon plasma which can be studied in laboratory experiments for little more than the time light needs to cross the QGP fireball, thus about 10<sup>-22</sup> s. After this brief time the hot drop of quark plasma evaporates in a process called [[hadronization]]. This is so since practically all QGP components flow out at relativistic speed. In this way, it is possible to study conditions akin to those in the early Universe at the age of 10\u201340 microseconds. \n\n[[QCD matter#Laboratory experiments|Discovery]] of this new QGP [[state of matter]] has been announced both at [[CERN]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abbott|first=Alison|year=2000|title=CERN claims first experimental creation of quark\u2013gluon plasma|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/35001196|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=403|issue=6770|pages=581\u2013581|doi=10.1038/35001196|issn=0028-0836|via=}}</ref> and at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] (BNL).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacak|first=Barbara|last2=Steinberg|first2=Peter|year=2010|title=Creating the perfect liquid in heavy-ion collisions|url=http://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.3431330|journal=Physics Today|language=en|volume=63|issue=5|pages=39\u201343|doi=10.1063/1.3431330|issn=0031-9228|via=}}</ref> At this time comprehensive experimental evidence about its properties is being assembled.

Therefore, any strange quarks or antiquarks observed in experiments have been \"freshly\" made from the kinetic energy of colliding nuclei. Conveniently, the [[mass]] of strange quarks and antiquarks is equivalent to the temperature or energy at which protons, neutrons and other [[hadron]]s dissolve into quarks. This means that the abundance of strange quarks is sensitive to the conditions, structure and dynamics of the deconfined matter phase, and if their number is large it can be assumed that deconfinement conditions were reached.

Although the negative [[Omega baryon]] (sss) has a similar final state decay topology, it can be clearly distinguished from the Xi because its decay products are different.\n\nMeasurement of abundant formation of Xi (uss/dss), Omega (sss) and especially their antiparticles is an important cornerstone of the claim that quark\u2013gluon plasma has been formed.<ref name=\":2\" /> This abundant formation is often presented in comparison with the scaled expectation from normal proton-proton collisions; however, such a comparison is not a necessary step in view of the large absolute yields which defy conventional model expectations.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=P.

The important result is that enhancement observed by STAR also increases with the number of participating nucleons. We further note that for the most peripheral events at the smallest number of participants, copper and gold systems show at the same number of participants the same enhancement as could be expected.\n\nAnother remarkable feature of these results comparing CERN and STAR is that the enhancement is of similar magnitude for the vastly different energy available in the reaction. This near energy independence of the enhancement also agrees with the quark\u2013gluon plasma approach regarding the mechanism of production of these particles and confirms that a quark\u2013gluon plasma is created over a wide range of collision energies, very probably once a minimal energy threshold is exceeded.\n\n==Horn in K-to-pi ratio and the onset of deconfinement==\n{{See also|Onset of deconfinement}}\n[[File:NA61-NA49_horn.png|thumb||280px|The ratio of mean multiplicities of positively charged [[kaon]]s and [[pion]]s as a function of collision energy in collisions of two [[lead]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and [[proton]]\u2013proton interactions]]\nOne of most interesting questions is if there is a threshold in reaction energy and/or volume size which needs to be exceeded in order to form a domain in which quarks can move freely.

As the fireball of matter expands and breaks apart, this, in turn, provides a very high abundance of strange hadrons.  Among these, heavy mesons composed of strange quarks and a heavy quark, such as [[Bottomness|bottom]] ({{Subatomic particle|Strange B|link=yes}}) or [[Charm quark|charm]] ({{Subatomic particle|Strange D|link=yes}}), are of particular interest.  The coincident high yield of charm and strangeness present at LHC will lead to copious production of {{Subatomic particle|Strange D}}.  Other heavy flavor particles, some which have not even been discovered at this time are also likely to appear.  In that way, the Strangeness has turned today more generally into the Quark Flavor signature of quark\u2013gluon plasma.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=I. Kuznetsova\n |author2=J.

The experimental groups working in the field also like to develop their own analysis models and the outside observer sees many different analysis results. There are as many as 10\u201315 different particles species which follow the pattern predicted for the QGP as function of reaction energy, reaction centrality, and strangeness content.
