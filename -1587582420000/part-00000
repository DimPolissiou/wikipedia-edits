The battle began when the Greek army attacked the Ottoman defensive line at the Sarantaporo pass, which connected [[Thessaly]] with central [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nDespite being perceived as impregnable by its defenders, the main body of the Greek forces managed to advance deep inside the pass, while auxiliary units broke through the Ottoman flanks. The Ottomans abandoned their defensive line during the night, fearing encirclement. The Greek victory at Sarantaporo opened the way for the capture of [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] and [[Kozani]].\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the conclusion of the [[Greek War of Independence]], the [[Megali Idea]] (Great Idea) ideology came to dominate Greek foreign policy. The ultimate goal of the Megali Idea was the incorporation of all areas traditionally populated by Greeks into an independent Greek state.{{sfn|Klapsis|2009|pp=127\u2013131}} The disastrous Greek defeat in the short [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1897 exposed major flaws in the [[Greek Army]]'s organization, training and logistics. Upon his appointment in December 1905, [[Georgios Theotokis]] became the first postwar Greek prime minister to focus his attention on strengthening the army. He established the National Defense Fund which financed the purchase of large quantities of ammunition. In addition a new [[table of organization]] was introduced for the country's [[Greek Navy|navy]] and army, the latter being augmented by numerous artillery batteries. Theotokis' resignation in January 1909 and the perceived neglect of the armed forces by his successor resulted in the [[Goudi coup]] seven months later. Rather than taking power for themselves, the putschists invited [[Crete|Cretan]] politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] to rule the country.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=19\u201321}} Venizelos followed in Theotokis' footsteps by rearming and retraining the military, enacting extensive fortification and infrastructure works, purchasing new weapons, and recalling the [[Military reserve force|reservists]] for training.{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe climax of this effort was the invitation in 1911 of a [[British naval mission to Greece (1911\u20131915)|British naval mission]] and a [[French military mission to Greece (1911\u20131914)|French military mission]].{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}} The British mission was headed by Rear Admiral [[Lionel Grant Tufnell]], who placed an emphasis on gunnery practice and fleet maneuvers, while his assistants introduced a new fuse for the [[Whitehead torpedo]].{{sfn|Hooton|2014|p=65}} The French mission under Brigadier General [[Joseph Paul Eydoux]] focused its attention on improving discipline and training senior officers in large [[Formation (military)|formation]] operations.{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|p=12}} The [[Hellenic Military Academy]] was modeled after the [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr]] shifting its focus from artillery and engineer training towards that of infantry and cavalry.{{sfn|Veremis|1976|p=115}}\n\nAfter being informed of a [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbo]]-[[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] alliance, Venizelos ordered his ambassador in [[Sofia]] to prepare a Greco-Bulgarian defense agreement by 14 April 1912. This was due to fears that should Greece fail to participate in a future war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] it would be unable to capture the Greek majority areas of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The treaty was signed on 15 July 1912, with the two countries agreeing to assist each other in case of a defensive war and to safeguard the rights of Christian populations in Ottoman-held Macedonia, thus joining the loose [[Balkan League]] alliance with Serbia, [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and Bulgaria. Fearing a new war in the Balkans, the Ottomans mobilized their armed forces on 14 September and began transferring units to [[Thrace]]; the Balkan League responded in kind.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=26\u201329}} On 30 September, the League presented the Ottomans with a list of demands regarding the rights of its Christian population. The Ottoman Empire rebuffed the demands, recalled its ambassadors in Sofia, Belgrade and Athens and expelled the League's negotiators on 4 October. The League declared [[First Balkan War|war]] against the Ottomans, while Montenegro had already began military operations on 25 September.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n==Prelude==\nGreece dispatched the [[Army of Epirus]] and the [[Army of Thessaly]] to its frontiers in [[Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] respectively. The latter numbered 100,000 men, and was divided into seven divisions: namely the [[1st Infantry Division (Greece)|1st]], the [[2nd Infantry Division (Greece)|2nd]], the [[3rd Infantry Division (Greece)|3rd]], the [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th]], the [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th]], the [[6th Infantry Division (Greece)|6th]] and the [[7th Mechanized Infantry Brigade (Greece)|7th Infantry Divisions]], as well as a cavalry brigade and four independent [[Evzones]] battalions. The Army of Thessaly was commanded by Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]].{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=289\u2013290}} Facing the Greeks in Thessaly was the Ottoman [[VIII Corps (Ottoman Empire)|VIII Corps]] under General [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] which included three divisions: the regular (''nizamiye'') [[22nd Infantry Division (Ottoman Empire)|22nd Division]] and the reserve (''redif'') Nasli\u00e7 and Ayd\u0131n Divisions{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=170}} which, combined with the Ottoman garrisons in western Macedonia, totaled 35,000\u201340,000 men.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nThe Army of Thessaly crossed into Ottoman territory in the early morning hours of 5 October, finding most border posts to be abandoned, with the garrisons at Melouna Pass, Profitis Ilias and Tsouka resisting for several hours before retreating. The first major clashes took place the following day when the 1st and 2nd Greek Divisions attacked hastily organized defenses north of [[Elassona]]. Elassona was defended by three infantry battalions, two artillery batteries and half a squadron of cavalry.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}} The battle for Elassona lasted for three hours, with the Ottomans retreating to avoid encirclement, thus giving the troops manning the main defensive line at Sarantaporo additional time to reinforce their positions.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=44\u201345}} The Greeks went on to advance {{convert|20|km|miles}} into the Elassona plateau without encountering any resistance.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=47}} Between 7 and 8 October, Greek troops regrouped in front of Sarantaporo and dispatched cavalry reconnaissance patrols towards the Ottoman positions, locating the headquarters of the Ottoman VIII Corps at Hania Viglas and those of a reserve division at Glikovo.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nSituated between the Vigla and Amorves mountains, Sarantaporo was a narrow mountain pass, the only one connecting Thessaly with central Macedonia; it spanned some {{convert|7\u20138|km|miles|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}. Having ceded Thessaly to Greece in the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)]], the Ottomans had been methodically reinforcing their positions around Sarantaporo in anticipation of a future war.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=48}} The Ottomans had organized their defenses under the guidance of German military advisors, placing their artillery batteries and infantry in sheltered, camouflaged trenches on the ravine's steep slopes, allowing them to accurately fire along its entire length. Considered to be nearly impenetrable it was dubbed \"the graveyard of the Greek Army\" by  the Prussian Field Marshal [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=42}}\n\n==Battle==\nAt 7 a.m. on 9 October, the Greek infantry began its assault on Sarantaporo. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions attacked the Ottoman main line frontally, their advance hampered by accurate Ottoman rifle and artillery fire and the ruggedness of the terrain. In the meantime, the 4th Division conducted a flanking maneuver from the west with the intention of occupying the [[Pyli|Porta Pass]], and striking the rear of the Ottoman positions.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The 5th Division advanced further to the west towards the village of Zampourda which was situated on the other bank of the [[Haliacmon]] River, with the intention of protecting the left flank of the Greek forces emerging from the Sarantaporo pass. The cavalry brigade moved on the extreme west along the road towards [[Servia, Greece|Servia]], planning to block the bridge across the Haliacmon.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=51}} Attacking from the east of the pass the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment overcame stiff resistance at Vlacholeivado and captured the village, but failing to advance further due to heavy fog.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=207\u2013209}} At 2 p.m., the main bulk of the Greek artillery was brought to the main line, joining the engagement. Despite suffering heavy casualties, the three divisions had halted some {{convert|500-700|m|yards|sigfig=1}} from the Ottoman trenches intending to launch a final assault the following morning.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}\n\nThe 4th Division fought its way through the villages of Metaxas and Rachovo. Upon reaching the Porta Pass it engaged in a bloody clash with the defenders, securing its objective at 5 p.m.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=53}} The 5th Division and the Gennadis Evzone detachment were confronted by four Ottoman reserve battalions at Lazarades which held their ground until sunset.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The commander of the cavalry brigade ordered his unit to encamp at Loudani, refusing to advance further because of the resistance offered by the Ottomans at Lazarades. Fearing that they would be encircled by the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment, the Ottomans began to withdraw at 7 p.m., towards their second defensive line at Hani 739, under the cover of the night. Before retreating they fired a 20-minute artillery barrage on Greek positions along the entire frontline. Unaware of the Ottoman retreat the Greeks failed to use the opportunity and cut their access to the bridge across the Haliacmon. Upon reaching their second defensive line, the Ottomans became aware of the 4th Divisions' seizure of Porta Pass and panic spread in their ranks and many soldiers fled, abandoning their equipment.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=203\u2013205}} On the morning of 10 October, the 4th Division charged down the northern slope of the Rahovo Mountain, surprising the Ottoman infantry and artillerymen who abandoned over twenty [[Krupp gun]]s and engaged in a disorganized retreat.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}} The Greek cavalry's indecision once again enabled the fleeing Ottomans to safely reach Servia and [[Kozani]].{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAt 4 p.m. on 10 October, the 4th Division entered Servia, witnessing 75 to 90 severed human heads belonging to local Christians lined up on either side of one of its streets.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} Following the declaration of war local authorities had detained all the Christian dignitaries from Servia and the surrounding villages with the intention of massacring them, a plan that was thwarted by Ottoman officer Omer Bey. However, upon realizing the imminent defeat of the Ottoman troops at Sarantaporo, the town's Muslim population massacred 117 local Christians.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=58\u201359}} By 11 October, the entirety of the Army of Thessaly had reached the banks of the Haliacmon, while the Greek cavalry entered Kozani unopposed,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} opening the way for the Greeks to advance towards the Greek majority city of [[Thessaloniki]] and assist the Serbs at [[Bitola|Monastir]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=46}} On 13 October, the Greek army transferred its general headquarters to Kozani; the following day King [[George I of Greece|George I]] arrived in the city, ordering the army to march towards Thessaloniki and [[Veroia]].{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=241\u2013243}} Greek casualties in the battle of Sarantaporo numbered 182 killed and over 1,000 wounded,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} while the Ottomans lost approximately 500 killed, 1,000 wounded, around 22 to 25 [[field artillery]] pieces captured and other significant material losses.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}}\n\nBy May 1913, the numerically inferior Ottomans had suffered a series of serious defeats to the League's armies on all fronts. The League had captured most of the Ottoman Empire's European territories and was rapidly approaching [[Constantinople]].

The battle began when the Greek army attacked the Ottoman defensive line at the Sarantaporo pass, which connected [[Thessaly]] with central [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nDespite being perceived as impregnable by its defenders, the main body of the Greek forces managed to advance deep inside the pass, while auxiliary units broke through the Ottoman flanks. The Ottomans abandoned their defensive line during the night, fearing encirclement. The Greek victory at Sarantaporo opened the way for the capture of [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] and [[Kozani]].\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the conclusion of the [[Greek War of Independence]], the [[Megali Idea]] (Great Idea) ideology came to dominate Greek foreign policy. The ultimate goal of the Megali Idea was the incorporation of all areas traditionally populated by Greeks into an independent Greek state.{{sfn|Klapsis|2009|pp=127\u2013131}} The disastrous Greek defeat in the short [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1897 exposed major flaws in the [[Greek Army]]'s organization, training and logistics. Upon his appointment in December 1905, [[Georgios Theotokis]] became the first postwar Greek prime minister to focus his attention on strengthening the army. He established the National Defense Fund which financed the purchase of large quantities of ammunition. In addition a new [[table of organization]] was introduced for the country's [[Greek Navy|navy]] and army, the latter being augmented by numerous artillery batteries. Theotokis' resignation in January 1909 and the perceived neglect of the armed forces by his successor resulted in the [[Goudi coup]] seven months later. Rather than taking power for themselves, the putschists invited [[Crete|Cretan]] politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] to rule the country.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=19\u201321}} Venizelos followed in Theotokis' footsteps by rearming and retraining the military, enacting extensive fortification and infrastructure works, purchasing new weapons, and recalling the [[Military reserve force|reservists]] for training.{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe climax of this effort was the invitation in 1911 of a [[British naval mission to Greece (1911\u20131915)|British naval mission]] and a [[French military mission to Greece (1911\u20131914)|French military mission]].{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}} The British mission was headed by Rear Admiral [[Lionel Grant Tufnell]], who placed an emphasis on gunnery practice and fleet maneuvers, while his assistants introduced a new fuse for the [[Whitehead torpedo]].{{sfn|Hooton|2014|p=65}} The French mission under Brigadier General [[Joseph Paul Eydoux]] focused its attention on improving discipline and training senior officers in large [[Formation (military)|formation]] operations.{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|p=12}} The [[Hellenic Military Academy]] was modeled after the [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr]] shifting its focus from artillery and engineer training towards that of infantry and cavalry.{{sfn|Veremis|1976|p=115}}\n\nAfter being informed of a [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbo]]-[[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] alliance, Venizelos ordered his ambassador in [[Sofia]] to prepare a Greco-Bulgarian defense agreement by 14 April 1912. This was due to fears that should Greece fail to participate in a future war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] it would be unable to capture the Greek majority areas of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The treaty was signed on 15 July 1912, with the two countries agreeing to assist each other in case of a defensive war and to safeguard the rights of Christian populations in Ottoman-held Macedonia, thus joining the loose [[Balkan League]] alliance with Serbia, [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and Bulgaria. Fearing a new war in the Balkans, the Ottomans mobilized their armed forces on 14 September and began transferring units to [[Thrace]]; the Balkan League responded in kind.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=26\u201329}} On 30 September, the League presented the Ottomans with a list of demands regarding the rights of its Christian population. The Ottoman Empire rebuffed the demands, recalled its ambassadors in Sofia, Belgrade and Athens and expelled the League's negotiators on 4 October. The League declared [[First Balkan War|war]] against the Ottomans, while Montenegro had already began military operations on 25 September.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n==Prelude==\nGreece dispatched the [[Army of Epirus]] and the [[Army of Thessaly]] to its frontiers in [[Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] respectively. The latter numbered 100,000 men, and was divided into seven divisions: namely the [[1st Infantry Division (Greece)|1st]], the [[2nd Infantry Division (Greece)|2nd]], the [[3rd Infantry Division (Greece)|3rd]], the [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th]], the [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th]], the [[6th Infantry Division (Greece)|6th]] and the [[7th Mechanized Infantry Brigade (Greece)|7th Infantry Divisions]], as well as a cavalry brigade and four independent [[Evzones]] battalions. The Army of Thessaly was commanded by Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]].{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=289\u2013290}} Facing the Greeks in Thessaly was the Ottoman [[VIII Corps (Ottoman Empire)|VIII Corps]] under General [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] which included three divisions: the regular (''nizamiye'') [[22nd Infantry Division (Ottoman Empire)|22nd Division]] and the reserve (''redif'') Nasli\u00e7 and Ayd\u0131n Divisions{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=170}} which, combined with the Ottoman garrisons in western Macedonia, totaled 35,000\u201340,000 men.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nThe Army of Thessaly crossed into Ottoman territory in the early morning hours of 5 October, finding most border posts to be abandoned, with the garrisons at Melouna Pass, Profitis Ilias and Tsouka resisting for several hours before retreating. The first major clashes took place the following day when the 1st and 2nd Greek Divisions attacked hastily organized defenses north of [[Elassona]]. Elassona was defended by three infantry battalions, two artillery batteries and half a squadron of cavalry.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}} The battle for Elassona lasted for three hours, with the Ottomans retreating to avoid encirclement, thus giving the troops manning the main defensive line at Sarantaporo additional time to reinforce their positions.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=44\u201345}} The Greeks went on to advance {{convert|20|km|miles}} into the Elassona plateau without encountering any resistance.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=47}} Between 7 and 8 October, Greek troops regrouped in front of Sarantaporo and dispatched cavalry reconnaissance patrols towards the Ottoman positions, locating the headquarters of the Ottoman VIII Corps at Hania Viglas and those of a reserve division at Glikovo.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nSituated between the Vigla and Amorves mountains, Sarantaporo was a narrow mountain pass, the only one connecting Thessaly with central Macedonia; it spanned some {{convert|7\u20138|km|miles|sigfig=1}}. Having ceded Thessaly to Greece in the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)]], the Ottomans had been methodically reinforcing their positions around Sarantaporo in anticipation of a future war.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=48}} The Ottomans had organized their defenses under the guidance of German military advisors, placing their artillery batteries and infantry in sheltered, camouflaged trenches on the ravine's steep slopes, allowing them to accurately fire along its entire length. Considered to be nearly impenetrable it was dubbed \"the graveyard of the Greek Army\" by  the Prussian Field Marshal [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=42}}\n\n==Battle==\nAt 7 a.m. on 9 October, the Greek infantry began its assault on Sarantaporo. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions attacked the Ottoman main line frontally, their advance hampered by accurate Ottoman rifle and artillery fire and the ruggedness of the terrain. In the meantime, the 4th Division conducted a flanking maneuver from the west with the intention of occupying the [[Pyli|Porta Pass]], and striking the rear of the Ottoman positions.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The 5th Division advanced further to the west towards the village of Zampourda which was situated on the other bank of the [[Haliacmon]] River, with the intention of protecting the left flank of the Greek forces emerging from the Sarantaporo pass. The cavalry brigade moved on the extreme west along the road towards [[Servia, Greece|Servia]], planning to block the bridge across the Haliacmon.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=51}} Attacking from the east of the pass the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment overcame stiff resistance at Vlacholeivado and captured the village, but failing to advance further due to heavy fog.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=207\u2013209}} At 2 p.m., the main bulk of the Greek artillery was brought to the main line, joining the engagement. Despite suffering heavy casualties, the three divisions had halted some {{convert|500-700|m|yards|sigfig=1}} from the Ottoman trenches intending to launch a final assault the following morning.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}\n\nThe 4th Division fought its way through the villages of Metaxas and Rachovo. Upon reaching the Porta Pass it engaged in a bloody clash with the defenders, securing its objective at 5 p.m.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=53}} The 5th Division and the Gennadis Evzone detachment were confronted by four Ottoman reserve battalions at Lazarades which held their ground until sunset.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The commander of the cavalry brigade ordered his unit to encamp at Loudani, refusing to advance further because of the resistance offered by the Ottomans at Lazarades. Fearing that they would be encircled by the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment, the Ottomans began to withdraw at 7 p.m., towards their second defensive line at Hani 739, under the cover of the night. Before retreating they fired a 20-minute artillery barrage on Greek positions along the entire frontline. Unaware of the Ottoman retreat the Greeks failed to use the opportunity and cut their access to the bridge across the Haliacmon. Upon reaching their second defensive line, the Ottomans became aware of the 4th Divisions' seizure of Porta Pass and panic spread in their ranks and many soldiers fled, abandoning their equipment.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=203\u2013205}} On the morning of 10 October, the 4th Division charged down the northern slope of the Rahovo Mountain, surprising the Ottoman infantry and artillerymen who abandoned over twenty [[Krupp gun]]s and engaged in a disorganized retreat.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}} The Greek cavalry's indecision once again enabled the fleeing Ottomans to safely reach Servia and [[Kozani]].{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAt 4 p.m. on 10 October, the 4th Division entered Servia, witnessing 75 to 90 severed human heads belonging to local Christians lined up on either side of one of its streets.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} Following the declaration of war local authorities had detained all the Christian dignitaries from Servia and the surrounding villages with the intention of massacring them, a plan that was thwarted by Ottoman officer Omer Bey. However, upon realizing the imminent defeat of the Ottoman troops at Sarantaporo, the town's Muslim population massacred 117 local Christians.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=58\u201359}} By 11 October, the entirety of the Army of Thessaly had reached the banks of the Haliacmon, while the Greek cavalry entered Kozani unopposed,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} opening the way for the Greeks to advance towards the Greek majority city of [[Thessaloniki]] and assist the Serbs at [[Bitola|Monastir]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=46}} On 13 October, the Greek army transferred its general headquarters to Kozani; the following day King [[George I of Greece|George I]] arrived in the city, ordering the army to march towards Thessaloniki and [[Veroia]].{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=241\u2013243}} Greek casualties in the battle of Sarantaporo numbered 182 killed and over 1,000 wounded,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} while the Ottomans lost approximately 500 killed, 1,000 wounded, around 22 to 25 [[field artillery]] pieces captured and other significant material losses.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}}\n\nBy May 1913, the numerically inferior Ottomans had suffered a series of serious defeats to the League's armies on all fronts.

{"title_page": "Measurement while drilling", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}\n{{Well logging}}\nA [[drilling rig]] is used to create a [[borehole]] or well (also called a wellbore) in the earth's sub-surface, for example in order to extract natural resources such as gas or oil. During such drilling, data is acquired from the drilling rig sensors for a range of purposes such as: decision-support to monitor and manage the smooth operation of drilling; to make detailed records (or well log) of the geologic formations penetrated by a borehole; to generate operations statistics and performance benchmarks such that improvements can be identified, and to provide well planners with accurate historical operations-performance data with which to perform statistical risk analysis for future well operations. The terms '''measurement while drilling (MWD)''', and [[logging while drilling]] (LWD) are not used consistently throughout the industry. Although these terms are related, within the context of this section, the term MWD refers to directional-drilling measurements, e.g., for decision support for the wellbore path, (Inclination and Azimuth) while LWD refers to measurements concerning the geological formations penetrated while drilling.<ref name=\"Dowell\">\n{{cite book\n  | last = Dowell\n  | first = Iain |author2=Andrew Mills |author3=Matt Lora\n  | chapter = Chapter 15 - Drilling-Data Acquisition\n  | title = Petroleum Engineering Handbook \n  | volume = II - Drilling Engineering\n  | editor = Robert F.

JJ Arps produced a working directional and resistivity system in the 1960s.<ref>J.J. Arps | J.L. Arps DOI https://doi.org/10.2118/710-PA</ref> Competing work supported by Mobil, Standard Oil and others in the late 1960s and early 1970s led to multiple viable systems by the early 1970s, with the MWD of Teleco Oilfield Services, systems from Schlumberger (Mobil) Halliburton and BakerHughes. However the main impetus to development was a  decision by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate to mandate the taking of a directional survey in wells offshore Norway every 100 meters. This decision created an environment where MWD technology had an economic advantage over conventional mechanical TOTCO devices, and lead to rapid developments, including LWD, to add gamma and resistivity, by the early 1980s.<ref>http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-90/issue-7/in-this-issue/general-interest/advances-in-mwd-technology-improve-real-time-data.html</ref><ref>https://www.onepetro.org/journal-paper/SPE-10053-PA</ref> <ref>https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-14071-MS</ref>\n\n==Measurement==\n\nMWD typically concerns measurement taken of the wellbore (the hole) inclination from vertical, and also magnetic direction from north.  Using basic trigonometry, a three-dimensional plot of the path of the well can be produced.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\nEssentially, a MWD operator measures the trajectory of the hole as it is drilled (for example, data updates arrive and are processed every few seconds or faster).  This information is then used to drill in a pre-planned direction into the formation which contains the oil, gas, water or condensate.  Additional measurements can also be taken of natural gamma ray emissions from the rock; this helps broadly to determine what type of rock formation is being drilled, which in turn helps confirm the real-time location of the wellbore in relation to the presence of different types of known formations (by comparison with existing seismic data).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nDensity and porosity, rock fluid pressures and other measurements are taken, some using radioactive sources, some using sound, some using electricity, etc.; this can then be used to calculate how freely oil and other fluids can flow through the formation, as well as the volume of hydrocarbons present in the rock and, with other data, the value of the whole reservoir and reservoir reserves.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nAn MWD downhole tool is also \"high-sided\" with the bottom hole drilling assembly, enabling the wellbore to be steered in a chosen direction in 3D space known as [[directional drilling]].  Directional drillers rely on receiving accurate, quality tested data from the MWD operator to allow them to keep the well safely on the planned trajectory.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nDirectional survey measurements are taken by three orthogonally mounted accelerometers to measure inclination, and three orthogonally mounted magnetometers which measure direction (azimuth).  Gyroscopic tools may be used to measure azimuth where the survey is measured in a location with disruptive external magnetic influences, inside \"casing\", for example, where the hole is lined with steel tubulars (tubes).  These sensors, as well as any additional sensors to measure rock formation density, porosity, pressure or other data, are connected, physically and digitally, to a logic unit which converts the information into binary digits which are then transmitted to surface using \"mud pulse telemetry\" (MPT, a binary coding transmission system used with fluids, such as, combinatorial, Manchester encoding, split-phase, among others).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThis is done by using a downhole \"pulser\" unit which varies the drilling fluid (mud) pressure inside the [[Drill string|drillstring]] according to the chosen MPT: these pressure fluctuations are decoded and displayed on the surface system computers as wave-forms; voltage outputs from the sensors (raw data); specific measurements of gravity or directions from magnetic north, or in other forms, such as sound waves, nuclear wave-forms, etc.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nSurface (mud) pressure transducers measure these pressure fluctuations (pulses) and pass an analogue voltage signal to surface computers which digitize the signal. Disruptive frequencies are filtered out and the signal is decoded back into its original data form.  For example, a pressure fluctuation of 20psi (or less) can be \u201cpicked out\u201d of a total mud system pressure of 3,500psi or more.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nDownhole electrical and mechanical power is provided by downhole turbine systems, which use the energy of the \u201cmud\u201d flow, battery units (lithium), or a combination of both.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Types of information transmitted==\n\n===Directional information===\n\nMWD tools are generally capable of taking directional surveys in real time.  The tool uses [[accelerometers]] and [[magnetometers]] to measure the [[inclination]] and [[azimuth]] of the wellbore at that location, and they then transmit that information to the surface.  With a series of surveys; measurements of inclination, azimuth, and tool face, at appropriate intervals (anywhere from every 30&nbsp;ft (i.e., 10m) to every 500&nbsp;ft), the location of the wellbore can be calculated.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nBy itself, this information allows operators to prove that their well does not cross into areas that they are not authorized to drill.  However, due to the cost of MWD systems, they are not generally used on wells intended to be vertical.  Instead, the wells are surveyed after drilling through the use of [[multi-shot surveying tools]] lowered into the drillstring on slickline or [[wireline (cabling)|wireline]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe primary use of real-time surveys is in directional drilling.  For the directional driller to steer the well towards a target zone, he must know where the well is going, and what the effects of his steering efforts are.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nMWD tools also generally provide toolface measurements to aid in directional drilling using downhole mud motors with bent subs or bent housings.  For more information on the use of toolface measurements, see [[Directional drilling]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n===Drilling mechanics information===\n\nMWD tools can also provide information about the conditions at the drill bit.  This may include:\n*Rotational speed of the drillstring\n*Smoothness of that rotation\n*Type and severity of any vibration downhole\n*Downhole temperature\n*Torque and weight on bit, measured near the drill bit\n*Mud flow volume\n[[File:Mud Moter & MWD.JPG|thumb|Mud Motors]]\n\nUse of this information can allow the operator to drill the well more efficiently, and to ensure that the MWD tool and any other downhole tools, such as a [[mud motor]], [[rotary steerable system]]s, and LWD tools, are operated within their technical specifications to prevent tool failure.  This information is also valuable to geologists responsible for the well information about the formation which is being drilled.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n===Formation properties===\n\nMany MWD tools, either on their own, or in conjunction with separate LWD tools, can take measurements of formation properties.  At the surface, these measurements are assembled into a log, similar to one obtained by [[Well logging|wireline logging]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nLWD tools are able to measure a suite of geological characteristics including density, porosity, resistivity, acoustic-caliper, inclination at the drill bit (NBI), magnetic resonance and formation pressure. <ref> Taherdangkoo, R., & Abdideh, M. (2016). https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJPE.2016.084117. Fracture density estimation from well logs data using regression analysis: validation based on image logs (Case study: South West Iran). International Journal of Petroleum Engineering, 2(4), 289-301.</ref>\n\nThe MWD tool allows these measurements to be taken and evaluated while the well is being drilled.  This makes it possible to perform [[geosteering]], or directional drilling based on measured formation properties, rather than simply drilling into a preset target.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nMost MWD tools contain an internal [[gamma ray]] sensor to measure natural gamma ray values.  This is because these sensors are compact, inexpensive, reliable, and can take measurements through unmodified drill collars.  Other measurements often require separate LWD tools, which communicate with the MWD tools downhole through internal wires.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nMeasurement while drilling can be cost-effective in exploration wells, particularly in areas of the Gulf of Mexico where wells are drilled in areas of [[salt diapir]]s.  The resistivity log will detect penetration into salt, and early detection prevents salt damage to bentonite drilling mud.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Data transmission methods==\n\n===Mud-pulse telemetry===\nThis is the most common method of data transmission used by MWD tools.  Downhole, a valve is operated to restrict the flow of the drilling fluid (mud) according to the digital information to be transmitted.  This creates pressure fluctuations representing the information.  The pressure fluctuations propagate within the drilling fluid towards the surface where they are received from pressure sensors.  On the surface, the received pressure signals are processed by computers to reconstruct the information.  The technology is available in three varieties:  ''positive'' pulse, ''negative'' pulse, and ''continuous wave''.<ref>https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-14071-MS</ref>\n\n;Positive pulse\n:Positive-pulse tools briefly close and open the valve to restrict the mud flow within the drill pipe.  This produces an increase in pressure that can be seen at surface. The digital information can be encoded in the pressure signal using [[line code]]s or [[pulse-position modulation]].<ref>https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-14071-MS</ref>\n[[File:Diagram Showing the MWD.JPG|thumb|Diagram showing the MWD]]\n;Negative pulse\n:Negative pulse tools briefly open and close the valve to release mud from inside the drillpipe out to the annulus.  This produces a decrease in pressure that can be seen at surface. The digital information can be encoded in the pressure signal using line codes or pulse-position modulation.<ref>https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-14071-MS</ref>\n\n;Continuous wave\n:Continuous wave tools gradually close and open the valve to generate sinusoidal pressure fluctuations within the drilling fluid.  Any digital [[modulation]] scheme with a continuous phase can be used to impose the information on a carrier signal.  The most widely used modulation scheme is [[continuous phase modulation]].<ref>https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-14071-MS</ref>\n\nWhen [[underbalanced drilling]] is used, mud pulse telemetry can become unusable.  This is usually because, in order to reduce the equivalent density of the drilling mud, a compressible gas is injected into the mud.  This causes high signal [[attenuation]] which drastically reduces the ability of the mud to transmit pulsed data.  In this case, it is necessary to use methods different from mud pulse telemetry, such as electromagnetic waves propagating through the formation or wired drill pipe telemetry.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nCurrent mud-pulse telemetry technology offers a bandwidths of up to 40 bit/s.<ref name=\"ogj.com\">{{cite web|title=Mud-pulse telemetry sees step-change improvement with oscillating shear valves| year=2008 |url=http://www.ogj.com/articles/save_screen.cfm?ARTICLE_ID=332411| accessdate=23 March 2009}}</ref> The data rate drops with increasing length of the wellbore and is typically as low as 0.5 bit/s<ref>{{cite web|title=Orion II MWD System|year=2009|url=http://www.slb.com/content/services/drilling/telemetry/orion_II_mwd.asp?entry=orion2&|accessdate=23 March 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322020819/http://www.slb.com/content/services/drilling/telemetry/orion_II_mwd.asp?entry=orion2&|archivedate=22 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> \u2013 3.0 bit/s.<ref name=\"ogj.com\"/> (bits per second) at a depth of 35,000&nbsp;ft \u2013 40,000&nbsp;ft (10668 m \u2013 12192 m).\n\nSurface to down hole communication is typically done via changes to drilling parameters, i.e., change of the rotation speed of the drill string or change of the mud flow rate.   Making changes to the drilling parameters in order to send information can require interruption of the drilling process, which is unfavorable due to the fact that it causes non-productive time.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n===Electromagnetic telemetry===\n\nThese tools incorporate an electrical insulator in the drillstring, but due to the challenges of receiving data through a good conductor (Salt Water) this approach is largely confined to onshore areas without shallow saline aquifers.  To transmit data, the tool generates an altered voltage difference between the top part (the main drillstring, above the insulator), and the bottom part (the drill bit, and other tools located below the insulator of the MWD tool).  On surface, a wire is attached to the wellhead, which makes contact with the drillpipe at the surface.  A second wire is attached to a rod driven into the ground some distance away.  The wellhead and the ground rod form the two electrodes of a dipole antenna.  The voltage difference between the two electrodes is the receive signal that is decoded by a computer.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe EM tool generates voltage differences between the drillstring sections in the pattern of very low frequency (2\u201312&nbsp;Hz) waves.  The data is imposed on the waves through digital [[modulation]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThis system generally offers data rates of up to 10 bits per second.  In addition, many of these tools are also capable of receiving data from the surface in the same way, while mud-pulse-based tools rely on changes in the drilling parameters, such as rotation speed of the drillstring or the mud flow rate, to send information from the surface to downhole tools.\n\nCompared to the broadly used mud-pulse telemetry, electromagnetic pulse telemetry is more effective in specialized situations onshore, such as [[underbalanced drilling]] or when using air as drilling fluid. It is capable of transmitting data faster at shallow drilling depths, onshore. However, it generally falls short when drilling exceptionally deep wells, and the signal can lose strength rapidly in certain types of formations, becoming undetectable at only a few thousand feet of depth.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n===Wired drill pipe ( Intellipipe)===\n\nSeveral oilfield service companies are currently developing wired drill pipe systems, though wired systems have been trialled for many decades, and the Russians had a system in use in the 1960s. These systems use electrical wires built into every component of the drillstring, which carry electrical signals directly to the surface.  These systems promise data transmission rates orders of magnitude greater than anything possible with mud-pulse or electromagnetic telemetry, both from the downhole tool to the surface and from the surface to the downhole tool.  The [[IntelliServ]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Intelliserv Network|year=2008|url=http://intelliserv.com/| accessdate=13 March 2008}}</ref> wired pipe network, offering data rates upwards of 1 megabit per second, became commercial in 2006. Representatives from BP America, StatoilHydro, Baker Hughes INTEQ, and Schlumberger presented three success stories using this system, both onshore and offshore, at the March 2008 SPE/IADC Drilling Conference in Orlando, Florida.<ref>{{cite web|title=T.H.

This generally allows the tool to be replaced much faster in case of failure, and it allows the tool to be recovered if the drillstring becomes stuck.  Retrievable tools must be much smaller, usually about 2&nbsp;inches or less in diameter, though their length may be {{convert|20|ft|abbr=on}} or more.  The small size is necessary for the tool to fit through the drillstring; however, it also limits the tool's capabilities.  For example, slim tools are not capable of sending data at the same rates as collar-mounted tools, and they are also more limited in their ability to communicate with, and supply electrical power to, other LWD tools.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nCollar-mounted tools, also known as ''fat tools'', cannot generally be removed from their drill collar at the wellsite.  If the tool fails, the entire drillstring must be pulled out of the hole to replace it.  However, without the need to fit through the drillstring, the tool can be larger and more capable.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe ability to retrieve the tool via wireline is often useful.  For example, if the drillstring becomes stuck in the hole, then retrieving the tool via wireline will save a substantial amount of money compared to leaving it in the hole with the stuck portion of the drillstring.  However, there are some limitations on the process.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n===Limitations===\n\nRetrieving a tool using wireline is not necessarily faster than pulling the tool out of the hole.  For example, if the tool fails at {{convert|1500|ft|m|-1|abbr=on}} while drilling with a triple rig (able to trip 3 joints of pipe, or about {{convert|90|ft|m|-1|abbr=on}} feet, at a time), then it would generally be faster to pull the tool out of the hole than it would be to rig up wireline and retrieve the tool, especially if the wireline unit must be transported to the rig.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nWireline retrievals also introduce additional risk.  If the tool becomes detached from the wireline, then it will fall back down the drillstring.  This will generally cause severe damage to the tool and the drillstring components in which it seats, and will require the drillstring to be pulled out of the hole to replace the failed components; this results in a greater total cost than pulling out of the hole in the first place.  The wireline gear might also fail to latch onto the tool, or, in the case of a severe failure, might bring only a portion of the tool to the surface.

During such drilling, data is acquired from the drilling rig sensors for a range of purposes such as: decision-support to monitor and manage the smooth operation of drilling; to make detailed records (or well log) of the geologic formations penetrated by a borehole; to generate operations statistics and performance benchmarks such that improvements can be identified, and to provide well planners with accurate historical operations-performance data with which to perform statistical risk analysis for future well operations. The terms '''measurement while drilling (MWD)''', and [[logging while drilling]] (LWD) are not used consistently throughout the industry. Although these terms are related, within the context of this section, the term MWD refers to directional-drilling measurements, e.g., for decision support for the wellbore path, (Inclination and Azimuth) while LWD refers to measurements concerning the geological formations penetrated while drilling.<ref name=\"Dowell\">\n{{cite book\n  | last = Dowell\n  | first = Iain |author2=Andrew Mills |author3=Matt Lora\n  | chapter = Chapter 15 - Drilling-Data Acquisition\n  | title = Petroleum Engineering Handbook \n  | volume = II - Drilling Engineering\n  | editor = Robert F.

JJ Arps produced a working directional and resistivity system in the 1960s.<ref>J.J. Arps | J.L. Arps DOI https://doi.org/10.2118/710-PA</ref> Competing work supported by Mobil, Standard Oil and others in the late 1960s and early 1970s led to multiple viable systems by the early 1970s, with the MWD of Teleco Oilfield Services, systems from Schlumberger (Mobil) Halliburton and BakerHughes. However the main impetus to development was a  decision by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate to mandate the taking of a directional survey in wells offshore Norway every 100 meters. This decision created an environment where MWD technology had an economic advantage over conventional mechanical TOTCO devices, and lead to rapid developments, including LWD, to add gamma and resistivity, by the early 1980s.<ref>http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-90/issue-7/in-this-issue/general-interest/advances-in-mwd-technology-improve-real-time-data.html</ref><ref>https://www.onepetro.org/journal-paper/SPE-10053-PA</ref> <ref>https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-14071-MS</ref>\n\n==Measurement==\n\nMWD typically concerns measurement taken of the wellbore (the hole) inclination from vertical, and also magnetic direction from north.  Using basic trigonometry, a three-dimensional plot of the path of the well can be produced.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\nEssentially, a MWD operator measures the trajectory of the hole as it is drilled (for example, data updates arrive and are processed every few seconds or faster).  This information is then used to drill in a pre-planned direction into the formation which contains the oil, gas, water or condensate.  Additional measurements can also be taken of natural gamma ray emissions from the rock; this helps broadly to determine what type of rock formation is being drilled, which in turn helps confirm the real-time location of the wellbore in relation to the presence of different types of known formations (by comparison with existing seismic data).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nDensity and porosity, rock fluid pressures and other measurements are taken, some using radioactive sources, some using sound, some using electricity, etc.; this can then be used to calculate how freely oil and other fluids can flow through the formation, as well as the volume of hydrocarbons present in the rock and, with other data, the value of the whole reservoir and reservoir reserves.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nAn MWD downhole tool is also \"high-sided\" with the bottom hole drilling assembly, enabling the wellbore to be steered in a chosen direction in 3D space known as [[directional drilling]].  Directional drillers rely on receiving accurate, quality tested data from the MWD operator to allow them to keep the well safely on the planned trajectory.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nDirectional survey measurements are taken by three orthogonally mounted accelerometers to measure inclination, and three orthogonally mounted magnetometers which measure direction (azimuth).  Gyroscopic tools may be used to measure azimuth where the survey is measured in a location with disruptive external magnetic influences, inside \"casing\", for example, where the hole is lined with steel tubulars (tubes).  These sensors, as well as any additional sensors to measure rock formation density, porosity, pressure or other data, are connected, physically and digitally, to a logic unit which converts the information into binary digits which are then transmitted to surface using \"mud pulse telemetry\" (MPT, a binary coding transmission system used with fluids, such as, combinatorial, Manchester encoding, split-phase, among others).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThis is done by using a downhole \"pulser\" unit which varies the drilling fluid (mud) pressure inside the [[Drill string|drillstring]] according to the chosen MPT: these pressure fluctuations are decoded and displayed on the surface system computers as wave-forms; voltage outputs from the sensors (raw data); specific measurements of gravity or directions from magnetic north, or in other forms, such as sound waves, nuclear wave-forms, etc.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nSurface (mud) pressure transducers measure these pressure fluctuations (pulses) and pass an analogue voltage signal to surface computers which digitize the signal. Disruptive frequencies are filtered out and the signal is decoded back into its original data form.  For example, a pressure fluctuation of 20psi (or less) can be \u201cpicked out\u201d of a total mud system pressure of 3,500psi or more.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nDownhole electrical and mechanical power is provided by downhole turbine systems, which use the energy of the \u201cmud\u201d flow, battery units (lithium), or a combination of both.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Types of information transmitted==\n\n===Directional information===\n\nMWD tools are generally capable of taking directional surveys in real time.  The tool uses [[accelerometers]] and [[magnetometers]] to measure the [[inclination]] and [[azimuth]] of the wellbore at that location, and they then transmit that information to the surface.  With a series of surveys; measurements of inclination, azimuth, and tool face, at appropriate intervals (anywhere from every 30&nbsp;ft (i.e., 10m) to every 500&nbsp;ft), the location of the wellbore can be calculated.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nBy itself, this information allows operators to prove that their well does not cross into areas that they are not authorized to drill.  However, due to the cost of MWD systems, they are not generally used on wells intended to be vertical.  Instead, the wells are surveyed after drilling through the use of [[multi-shot surveying tools]] lowered into the drillstring on slickline or [[wireline (cabling)|wireline]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe primary use of real-time surveys is in directional drilling.  For the directional driller to steer the well towards a target zone, he must know where the well is going, and what the effects of his steering efforts are.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nMWD tools also generally provide toolface measurements to aid in directional drilling using downhole mud motors with bent subs or bent housings.  For more information on the use of toolface measurements, see [[Directional drilling]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n===Drilling mechanics information===\n\nMWD tools can also provide information about the conditions at the drill bit.  This may include:\n*Rotational speed of the drillstring\n*Smoothness of that rotation\n*Type and severity of any vibration downhole\n*Downhole temperature\n*Torque and weight on bit, measured near the drill bit\n*Mud flow volume\n[[File:Mud Moter & MWD.JPG|thumb|Mud Motors]]\n\nUse of this information can allow the operator to drill the well more efficiently, and to ensure that the MWD tool and any other downhole tools, such as a [[mud motor]], [[rotary steerable system]]s, and LWD tools, are operated within their technical specifications to prevent tool failure.  This information is also valuable to geologists responsible for the well information about the formation which is being drilled.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n===Formation properties===\n\nMany MWD tools, either on their own, or in conjunction with separate LWD tools, can take measurements of formation properties.  At the surface, these measurements are assembled into a log, similar to one obtained by [[Well logging|wireline logging]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nLWD tools are able to measure a suite of geological characteristics including density, porosity, resistivity, acoustic-caliper, inclination at the drill bit (NBI), magnetic resonance and formation pressure. <ref> Taherdangkoo, R., & Abdideh, M. (2016). https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJPE.2016.084117. Fracture density estimation from well logs data using regression analysis: validation based on image logs (Case study: South West Iran). International Journal of Petroleum Engineering, 2(4), 289-301.</ref>\n\nThe MWD tool allows these measurements to be taken and evaluated while the well is being drilled.  This makes it possible to perform [[geosteering]], or directional drilling based on measured formation properties, rather than simply drilling into a preset target.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nMost MWD tools contain an internal [[gamma ray]] sensor to measure natural gamma ray values.  This is because these sensors are compact, inexpensive, reliable, and can take measurements through unmodified drill collars.  Other measurements often require separate LWD tools, which communicate with the MWD tools downhole through internal wires.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nMeasurement while drilling can be cost-effective in exploration wells, particularly in areas of the Gulf of Mexico where wells are drilled in areas of [[salt diapir]]s.  The resistivity log will detect penetration into salt, and early detection prevents salt damage to bentonite drilling mud.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Data transmission methods==\n\n===Mud-pulse telemetry===\nThis is the most common method of data transmission used by MWD tools.  Downhole, a valve is operated to restrict the flow of the drilling fluid (mud) according to the digital information to be transmitted.  This creates pressure fluctuations representing the information.  The pressure fluctuations propagate within the drilling fluid towards the surface where they are received from pressure sensors.  On the surface, the received pressure signals are processed by computers to reconstruct the information.  The technology is available in three varieties:  ''positive'' pulse, ''negative'' pulse, and ''continuous wave''.<ref>https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-14071-MS</ref>\n\n;Positive pulse\n:Positive-pulse tools briefly close and open the valve to restrict the mud flow within the drill pipe.  This produces an increase in pressure that can be seen at surface. The digital information can be encoded in the pressure signal using [[line code]]s or [[pulse-position modulation]].<ref>https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-14071-MS</ref>\n[[File:Diagram Showing the MWD.JPG|thumb|Diagram showing the MWD]]\n;Negative pulse\n:Negative pulse tools briefly open and close the valve to release mud from inside the drillpipe out to the annulus.  This produces a decrease in pressure that can be seen at surface. The digital information can be encoded in the pressure signal using line codes or pulse-position modulation.<ref>https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-14071-MS</ref>\n\n;Continuous wave\n:Continuous wave tools gradually close and open the valve to generate sinusoidal pressure fluctuations within the drilling fluid.  Any digital [[modulation]] scheme with a continuous phase can be used to impose the information on a carrier signal.  The most widely used modulation scheme is [[continuous phase modulation]].<ref>https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-14071-MS</ref>\n\nWhen [[underbalanced drilling]] is used, mud pulse telemetry can become unusable.  This is usually because, in order to reduce the equivalent density of the drilling mud, a compressible gas is injected into the mud.  This causes high signal [[attenuation]] which drastically reduces the ability of the mud to transmit pulsed data.  In this case, it is necessary to use methods different from mud pulse telemetry, such as electromagnetic waves propagating through the formation or wired drill pipe telemetry.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nCurrent mud-pulse telemetry technology offers a bandwidths of up to 40 bit/s.<ref name=\"ogj.com\">{{cite web|title=Mud-pulse telemetry sees step-change improvement with oscillating shear valves| year=2008 |url=http://www.ogj.com/articles/save_screen.cfm?ARTICLE_ID=332411| accessdate=23 March 2009}}</ref> The data rate drops with increasing length of the wellbore and is typically as low as 0.5 bit/s<ref>{{cite web|title=Orion II MWD System|year=2009|url=http://www.slb.com/content/services/drilling/telemetry/orion_II_mwd.asp?entry=orion2&|accessdate=23 March 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322020819/http://www.slb.com/content/services/drilling/telemetry/orion_II_mwd.asp?entry=orion2&|archivedate=22 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> \u2013 3.0 bit/s.<ref name=\"ogj.com\"/> (bits per second) at a depth of 35,000&nbsp;ft \u2013 40,000&nbsp;ft (10668 m \u2013 12192 m).\n\nSurface to down hole communication is typically done via changes to drilling parameters, i.e., change of the rotation speed of the drill string or change of the mud flow rate.   Making changes to the drilling parameters in order to send information can require interruption of the drilling process, which is unfavorable due to the fact that it causes non-productive time.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n===Electromagnetic telemetry===\n\nThese tools incorporate an electrical insulator in the drillstring, but due to the challenges of receiving data through a good conductor (Salt Water) this approach is largely confined to onshore areas without shallow saline aquifers.  To transmit data, the tool generates an altered voltage difference between the top part (the main drillstring, above the insulator), and the bottom part (the drill bit, and other tools located below the insulator of the MWD tool).  On surface, a wire is attached to the wellhead, which makes contact with the drillpipe at the surface.  A second wire is attached to a rod driven into the ground some distance away.  The wellhead and the ground rod form the two electrodes of a dipole antenna.  The voltage difference between the two electrodes is the receive signal that is decoded by a computer.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe EM tool generates voltage differences between the drillstring sections in the pattern of very low frequency (2\u201312&nbsp;Hz) waves.  The data is imposed on the waves through digital [[modulation]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThis system generally offers data rates of up to 10 bits per second.  In addition, many of these tools are also capable of receiving data from the surface in the same way, while mud-pulse-based tools rely on changes in the drilling parameters, such as rotation speed of the drillstring or the mud flow rate, to send information from the surface to downhole tools.\n\nCompared to the broadly used mud-pulse telemetry, electromagnetic pulse telemetry is more effective in specialized situations onshore, such as [[underbalanced drilling]] or when using air as drilling fluid. It is capable of transmitting data faster at shallow drilling depths, onshore. However, it generally falls short when drilling exceptionally deep wells, and the signal can lose strength rapidly in certain types of formations, becoming undetectable at only a few thousand feet of depth.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n===Wired drill pipe===\n\nSeveral oilfield service companies are currently developing wired drill pipe systems, though wired systems have been trialled for many decades, and the Russians had a system in use in the 1960s. These systems use electrical wires built into every component of the drillstring, which carry electrical signals directly to the surface.  These systems promise data transmission rates orders of magnitude greater than anything possible with mud-pulse or electromagnetic telemetry, both from the downhole tool to the surface and from the surface to the downhole tool.  The [[IntelliServ]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Intelliserv Network|year=2008|url=http://intelliserv.com/| accessdate=13 March 2008}}</ref> wired pipe network, offering data rates upwards of 1 megabit per second, became commercial in 2006. Representatives from BP America, StatoilHydro, Baker Hughes INTEQ, and Schlumberger presented three success stories using this system, both onshore and offshore, at the March 2008 SPE/IADC Drilling Conference in Orlando, Florida.<ref>{{cite web|title=T.H.

This generally allows the tool to be replaced much faster in case of failure, and it allows the tool to be recovered if the drillstring becomes stuck.  Retrievable tools must be much smaller, usually about 2&nbsp;inches or less in diameter, though their length may be {{convert|20|ft|abbr=on}} or more.  The small size is necessary for the tool to fit through the drillstring; however, it also limits the tool's capabilities.  For example, slim tools are not capable of sending data at the same rates as collar-mounted tools, and they are also more limited in their ability to communicate with, and supply electrical power to, other LWD tools.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nCollar-mounted tools, also known as ''fat tools'', cannot generally be removed from their drill collar at the wellsite.  If the tool fails, the entire drillstring must be pulled out of the hole to replace it.  However, without the need to fit through the drillstring, the tool can be larger and more capable.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe ability to retrieve the tool via wireline is often useful.  For example, if the drillstring becomes stuck in the hole, then retrieving the tool via wireline will save a substantial amount of money compared to leaving it in the hole with the stuck portion of the drillstring.  However, there are some limitations on the process.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n===Limitations===\n\nRetrieving a tool using wireline is not necessarily faster than pulling the tool out of the hole.  For example, if the tool fails at {{convert|1500|ft|m|-1|abbr=on}} while drilling with a triple rig (able to trip 3 joints of pipe, or about {{convert|90|ft|m|-1|abbr=on}} feet, at a time), then it would generally be faster to pull the tool out of the hole than it would be to rig up wireline and retrieve the tool, especially if the wireline unit must be transported to the rig.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nWireline retrievals also introduce additional risk.  If the tool becomes detached from the wireline, then it will fall back down the drillstring.  This will generally cause severe damage to the tool and the drillstring components in which it seats, and will require the drillstring to be pulled out of the hole to replace the failed components; this results in a greater total cost than pulling out of the hole in the first place.  The wireline gear might also fail to latch onto the tool, or, in the case of a severe failure, might bring only a portion of the tool to the surface.  This would require the drillstring to be pulled out of the hole to replace the failed components, thus making the wireline operation a waste of time.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nSome tool designers have taken the retrievable 'slim tool' design and applied it to a non-retrievable tool. In this instance, the MWD maintains all of the limitations of a slim tool design (low speed, ability to jam on dust particles, low shock & vibration tolerance) with none of the benefits. Curiously, these tools still have a wireline spearpoint despite being lifted and handled with a plate.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Geosteering]]\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commonscatinline}}\n\n{{Petroleum industry}}\n{{Shale gas|technology=yes}}\n\n[[Category:Drilling technology]]\n[[Category:Telemetry]]\n", "name_user": "103.75.216.43", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eWired drill pipe ( Intellipipe))", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_while_drilling"}

[[Frog]]s are the most commonly taken amphibians; in the [[Voronezh]] region, they frequently eat [[fire-bellied toad]]s, while [[European spadefoot toad]]s are usually taken in Ukraine. Raccoon dogs are able to eat toads that have toxic skin secretions by producing copious amounts of saliva to dilute the toxins.<ref>Alderton, David. (1998). ''Foxes, Wolves, and Wild Dogs of the World'', p. 119. London: Blandford.</ref> They prey on [[waterfowl]], [[passerine]]s, and [[migrating bird]]s. [[Grouse]] are commonly hunted in their introduced range, and many instances of [[pheasant]] predation are recorded in the [[Ussuri]] territory.\n\nRaccoon dogs eat beached fish and fish trapped in small water bodies. They rarely catch fish during the spawning season, but eat many during the spring thaw. In their southern range, they eat young [[tortoise]]s and their eggs. Insectivorous mammals hunted by raccoon dogs include [[shrew]]s and [[hedgehog]]s, and on rare occasions, [[mole (animal)|mole]]s and [[desman]]s. In the Ussuri territory, [[large mole]]s are their primary source of food. Plant food is highly variable, and includes [[bulb]]s, [[rhizome]]s, [[oat]]s, [[millet]]s, [[maize]], [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[berries]], [[grape]]s, [[melon]]s, [[watermelon]]s, [[pumpkin]]s, and [[tomato]]es.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> In Japan, they have been observed to climb trees to forage for fruits and berries,<ref name=canids /><ref name=\"Ikeda, Hiroshi p40,44\"/> using their curved claws to climb.<ref name=\"waza.org\"/>\n\nRaccoon dogs adapt their diets to the season; in late autumn and winter, they feed mostly on rodents, carrion, and feces, while fruit, insects, and amphibians predominate in spring. In summer, they eat fewer rodents, and mainly target nesting birds and fruits, grains, and vegetables.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Predators===\n[[Wolf|Wolves]] are the main predators of raccoon dogs, killing large numbers of them in spring and summer, though attacks have been reported in autumn, too. In [[Tatarstan]], wolf predation can account for 55.6% of raccoon dog deaths, while in northwestern Russia, it amounts to 64%. [[Red fox]]es kill raccoon dog pups, and have been known to bite adults to death.\n\nBoth foxes and [[Eurasian badger]]s compete with raccoon dogs for food, and have been known to kill them if raccoon dogs enter their burrows. [[Eurasian lynx]]es rarely attack them. [[Birds of prey]] known to take raccoon dogs include [[golden eagle]]s, [[white-tailed eagle]]s, [[Accipitridae|goshawk]]s, and [[eagle owl]]s.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n==Behavior==\n===Reproduction and development===\nThe [[mating season]] begins from early February to late April, depending on location. Raccoon dogs are [[monogamy|monogamous]] animals, with pair formations usually occurring in autumn. Captive males, however, have been known to mate with four or five females. Males will fight briefly, but not fatally, for mates.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> Copulation occurs during the night or dawn and typically will last 6\u20139 minutes.<ref>Valtonen, Maija H., E. J. Rajakoski, and J. I. M\u00e4kel\u00e4. \"[http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/51/2/517.full.pdf Reproductive features in the female raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides)].\" Journal of Reproduction and Fertility 51.2 (1977): 517-NP.</ref> [[Estrus]] lasts from a few hours to six days, during which females may mate up to five times. Females enter estrus again after 20\u201324&nbsp;days, even when pregnant.\n\nThe [[gestation period]] lasts 61\u201370&nbsp;days, with pups being born in April\u2013May. Litter sizes typically consist of 6&ndash;8&nbsp;pups, though 15\u201316&nbsp;pups can be born in exceptional cases. First-time mothers typically give birth to fewer pups than older ones. Males take an active role in raising the pups.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> This male role is very significant, as demonstrated by early releases in 1928 of pregnant females without males, resulting in very limited success at introduction, while later releases of pairs from 1929 until the 1960s resulted in the raccoon dog's now-extensive introduced European range.<ref>Alderton, David. Foxes, Wolves, and Wild Dogs of the World. London: Blandford, 1998. p121.</ref>\n\n[[File:Streifzug Marderhundwelpe Pforzheim.JPG|thumb|left|Raccoon dog pup]]\n\nAt birth, pups weigh 60\u2013110&nbsp;g, and are blind and covered in short, dense, soft wool lacking [[guard hairs]]. Their eyes open after 9\u201310&nbsp;days, with the teeth erupting after 14\u201316&nbsp;days. Guard hairs begin to grow after 10&nbsp;days, and first appear on the hips and shoulders. After two weeks, they lighten in colour, with black tones remaining only around the eyes. [[Lactation]] lasts for 45\u201360&nbsp;days, though pups begin eating food brought to them as early as the age of three weeks to one month. They reach their full size at the age of 4.5&nbsp;months. Pups leave their parents in late August\u2013September. By October, the pups, which by then resemble adults, unite in pairs. [[Sexual maturity]] is reached at 8\u201310&nbsp;months. Their [[longevity]] is largely unknown; animals 6\u20137&nbsp;years of age have been encountered in the wild, while captive specimens have been known to live for 11 years.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Hibernation===\nRaccoon dogs are the only canids known to [[hibernation|hibernate]]. In early winter, they increase their subcutaneous fat by 18\u201323% and their internal fat by 3\u20135%. Animals failing to reach these fat levels usually do not survive the winter. During their hibernation, their metabolism decreases by 25%. In areas such as [[Primorsky Krai]] and their introduced range, raccoon dogs hibernate only during severe snowstorms. In December, their physical activity decreases once snow depth reaches 15\u201320&nbsp;cm, and limit the range from their burrows to no more than 150\u2013200 m. Their daily activities increase during February when the females become receptive and when food is more available.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Vocalizations===\nLike foxes, they do not bark, uttering instead a growl, followed by a long-drawn, melancholy whine. Captive specimens have been known to utter daily a very different kind of sound when hungry, described as a sort of mewing plaint.<ref name=\"smith\">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/naturalhistoryof139smit |format=PDF|title=''The natural history of dogs : canidae or genus canis of authors ; including also the genera hyaena and proteles'' |date=1839|author1=Charles Hamilton Smith  |author2=William Jardine |lastauthoramp=yes |location=Edinburgh|publisher=W.H.

[[Primorsky Krai|Primor'e]] in the [[Russian Far East]] was the first region to be colonised, with individuals being transplanted from islands in the [[Sea of Japan]]. By 1934, raccoon dogs were introduced into [[Altai Krai|Altai]], the northern [[Caucasus]], [[Armenia]], [[Kirgizia]], [[Tatarstan]], [[Tver Oblast|Kalinin]], [[Penza Oblast|Penza]], and [[Orenburg Oblast|Orenburg]] regions. In the following year, they were further introduced into [[Leningradsky District, Krasnodar Krai|Leningradsky]], [[Murmansk Oblast|Murmansk]], [[Novosibirsk Oblast|Novosibirsk]], and [[Bashkortostan]].\n\nRaccoon dogs in [[Irkutsk Oblast|Irkutsk]], Novosibirsk, [[Zabaykalsky Krai|Trans-Baikaliya]], and [[Altai Krai|Altai]] did not fare well, due to harsh winters and scarce food. Raccoon dogs also fared badly in the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, [[Central Asia]], and Moldova. However, successful introductions occurred in the [[Baltic States|Baltic states]], European Russia (particularly in [[Tver Oblast|Kalinin]], [[Novgorod Oblast|Novgorod]], [[Pskov Oblast|Pskov]], and [[Smolensk Oblast|Smolensk]] regions), in central Russia ([[Moscow Oblast|Moscow]], [[Yaroslavl Oblast|Yaroslavl]], [[Vologda Oblast|Vologda]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Gorkiy]], [[Vladimir Oblast|Vladimir]], [[Ryazan Oblast|Ryazan]] Oblasts, etc.) as well as in the [[Chernozem|black soil]] belt ([[Voronezh Oblast|Voronezh]], [[Tambov Oblast|Tambov]] and [[Kursk Oblast|Kursk]]), the lower [[Volga Region]] and the level parts of the northern Caucasus and [[Dagestan]].

Birds amount to 15\u201320% of their diets in Lithuania, 46% on the [[Oka River]] floodlands, and 48.6% in the Voronezh Reserve. They are also harmful to the [[muskrat]] trade, destroying their nests and eating their young. In Ukraine, raccoon dogs are harmful to [[kitchen garden]]s, [[melon]] cultivations, [[vineyard]]s, and [[corn]] seedlings.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Hunting===\nRaccoon dogs are typically hunted from November until the snow deepens. In the [[Far East]], they are hunted at night using [[Laika (dog breed)|Laika]]s and mongrels. In the 19th&nbsp;century, the [[Goldi]] and [[Oroch people]] fastened bells to the collars of their raccoon dog hounds. In their introduced range, raccoon dogs are usually caught incidentally during hunts for other species. [[Fox hunting|Hunting with dogs]] is the most efficient method in raccoon dog hunts, having success rates of 80\u201390%, as opposed to 8\u201310% with guns and 5\u20137% with traps. Unless they retreat in their burrows, hunted raccoon dogs can be quickly strangled by hunting dogs. Traps are usually set at their burrows, along the shores of water bodies, and around marshes and ponds.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\nIn Finland, 60,000\u201370,000 raccoon dogs were hunted in 2000, increasing to 170,000 in 2009 and 164,000 in 2010. Hunting of raccoon dogs in Hungary began in 1997, with an annual catch of one to nine animals. In Poland, 6,200 were shot in 2002\u20132003. Annual Swedish and Danish raccoon dog hunts usually result in the capture of two to seven individuals. Between 18,000 and 70,000&nbsp;Japanese raccoon dogs were killed in Japan from the post-WWII period to 1982. Japan intensified its raccoon dog culling starting in the 1970s, averaging 4,529&nbsp;kills annually between 1990 and 1998. The numbers killed have since decreased.<ref name=canids />\n\n===Fur use===\n[[File:Raccoon_dog_12.jpg|right|thumb|A caged raccoon dog]]\n[[File:Chinese raccoon fur skins.jpg|right|thumb|Chinese raccoon dog pelts on sale in [[Milan]], Italy]]\n\nWhen used on clothing, the fur of the raccoon dog is called \"murmansky\" fur.

Small raccoon dog pelts with silky fur command higher prices than large, coarse-furred ones. Due to their long and coarse guard hairs and their woolly fur fibre, which has a tendency to felt or mat, raccoon dog pelts are used almost exclusively for fur trimmings. Japanese raccoon dog pelts, though smaller than other geographic variants, are the most valued variety, with specimens from [[Amur Oblast|Amur]] and [[Heilongjiang]] coming close behind, while Korean and southern Chinese are the least valued.<ref name=\"fur\">Bachrach, Max.

The world trade of raccoon dog pelts during 1907\u20131910 amounted to 260,000\u2013300,000, of which an estimated 20,000 (5\u20138%) came from Russia, though more recent figures estimate a lesser number of 5,000\u20136,000; 12,000 raccoon dogs were caught in the 1930s. In their introduced range, licensed trade of raccoon dogs began in 1948\u20131950, with restrictions being removed in 1953\u20131955.\n\nAfter the trade began, the number of catches increased sharply; from 1953\u20131961, it fluctuated between 30,000 and 70,000. In the latter year, about 10,000 were taken from their natural range in the Far East, while 56,000 were taken in their introduced range. Of the 56,000, 6,500 came from Belarus, 5,000 in Ukraine, 4,000 each for Latvia, Lithuania, and [[Krasnodar]], 3,700 in Kalinin, 2,700 in Pskov, and 2,300 in Astrakhan, while 1,000\u20132,000 pelts each were produced in Vologod, Moscow, Leningrad, [[Novogrod]], Smolensk, [[Yaroslavl]], Azerbaijan, Estonia, and [[Dagestan]]. Fewer than 1,000 pelts were produced in all remaining republics and districts. Successful raccoon dog introductions in Kalinin resulted in animals with denser and softer fur: The length of guard and top hairs increased by 7.96%, that of the underfur increased by 5.3%. The thickness of the guard and top hairs decreased by 3.41%. The density of the fur increased by 11.3%. They also became darker in colour, with black-brown pelts occurring in 8% of specimens, as opposed to 3% in their homeland.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\nCaptive breeding of raccoon dogs was initiated in 1928 in the [[Far East]], with 15&nbsp;state farms keeping them in 1934. Raccoon dogs were the principal furbearers farmed during the early years of collective farms, particularly in Ukraine. By the 1940s, this practice lessened in popularity, as the raccoon dogs required almost the same types of food as [[Silver fox (animal)|silver fox]]es, which were more valuable.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> An investigation by three animal protection groups into the Chinese fur trade in 2004 and part of 2005 asserts approximately 1.5&nbsp;million raccoon dogs are raised for fur in China.<ref>Hsieh-Yi, Yi-Chiao, Yu Fu, Mark Rissi and Dr Barbara Maas [http://www.careforthewild.com/files/Furreport05.pdf Fun Fur?

[[Frog]]s are the most commonly taken amphibians; in the [[Voronezh]] region, they frequently eat [[fire-bellied toad]]s, while [[European spadefoot toad]]s are usually taken in Ukraine. Raccoon dogs are able to eat toads that have toxic skin secretions by producing copious amounts of saliva to dilute the toxins.<ref>Alderton, David. (1998). ''Foxes, Wolves, and Wild Dogs of the World'', p. 119. London: Blandford.</ref> They prey on [[waterfowl]], [[passerine]]s, and [[migrating bird]]s. [[Grouse]] are commonly hunted in their introduced range, and many instances of [[pheasant]] predation are recorded in the [[Ussuri]] territory.\n\nRaccoon dogs eat beached fish and fish trapped in small water bodies. They rarely catch fish during the spawning season, but eat many during the spring thaw. In their southern range, they eat young [[tortoise]]s and their eggs. Insectivorous mammals hunted by raccoon dogs include [[shrew]]s and [[hedgehog]]s, and on rare occasions, [[mole (animal)|mole]]s and [[desman]]s. In the Ussuri territory, [[large mole]]s are their primary source of food. Plant food is highly variable, and includes [[bulb]]s, [[rhizome]]s, [[oat]]s, [[millet]]s, [[maize]], [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[berries]], [[grape]]s, [[melon]]s, [[watermelon]]s, [[pumpkin]]s, and [[tomato]]es.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> In Japan, they have been observed to climb trees to forage for fruits and berries,<ref name=canids /><ref name=\"Ikeda, Hiroshi p40,44\"/> using their curved claws to climb.<ref name=\"waza.org\"/>\n\nRaccoon dogs adapt their diets to the season; in late autumn and winter, they feed mostly on rodents, carrion, and feces, while fruit, insects, and amphibians predominate in spring. In summer, they eat fewer rodents, and mainly target nesting birds and fruits, grains, and vegetables.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Predators===\n[[Wolf|Wolves]] are the main predators of raccoon dogs, killing large numbers of them in spring and summer, though attacks have been reported in autumn, too. In [[Tatarstan]], wolf predation can account for 55.6% of raccoon dog deaths, while in northwestern Russia, it amounts to 64%. [[Red fox]]es kill raccoon dog pups, and have been known to bite adults to death.\n\nBoth foxes and [[Eurasian badger]]s compete with raccoon dogs for food, and have been known to kill them if raccoon dogs enter their burrows. [[Eurasian lynx]]es rarely attack them. [[Birds of prey]] known to take raccoon dogs include [[golden eagle]]s, [[white-tailed eagle]]s, [[Accipitridae|goshawk]]s, and [[eagle owl]]s.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n==Behavior==\n===Reproduction and development===\nThe [[mating season]] begins from early February to late April, depending on location. Raccoon dogs are [[monogamy|monogamous]] animals, with pair formations usually occurring in autumn. Captive males, however, have been known to mate with four or five females. Males will fight briefly, but not fatally, for mates.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> Copulation occurs during the night or dawn and typically will last 6\u20139 minutes.<ref>Valtonen, Maija H., E. J. Rajakoski, and J. I. M\u00e4kel\u00e4. \"[http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/51/2/517.full.pdf Reproductive features in the female raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides)].\" Journal of Reproduction and Fertility 51.2 (1977): 517-NP.</ref> [[Estrus]] lasts from a few hours to six days, during which females may mate up to five times. Females enter estrus again after 20\u201324&nbsp;days, even when pregnant.\n\nThe [[gestation period]] lasts 61\u201370&nbsp;days, with pups being born in April\u2013May. Litter sizes typically consist of 6&ndash;8&nbsp;pups, though 15\u201316&nbsp;pups can be born in exceptional cases. First-time mothers typically give birth to fewer pups than older ones. Males take an active role in raising the pups.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> This male role is very significant, as demonstrated by early releases in 1928 of pregnant females without males, resulting in very limited success at introduction, while later releases of pairs from 1929 until the 1960s resulted in the raccoon dog's now-extensive introduced European range.<ref>Alderton, David. Foxes, Wolves, and Wild Dogs of the World. London: Blandford, 1998. p121.</ref>\n\n[[File:Streifzug Marderhundwelpe Pforzheim.JPG|thumb|left|Raccoon dog pup]]\n\nAt birth, pups weigh 60\u2013110&nbsp;g, and are blind and covered in short, dense, soft wool lacking [[guard hairs]]. Their eyes open after 9\u201310&nbsp;days, with the teeth erupting after 14\u201316&nbsp;days. Guard hairs begin to grow after 10&nbsp;days, and first appear on the hips and shoulders. After two weeks, they lighten in colour, with black tones remaining only around the eyes. [[Lactation]] lasts for 45\u201360&nbsp;days, though pups begin eating food brought to them as early as the age of three weeks to one month. They reach their full size at the age of 4.5&nbsp;months. Pups leave their parents in late August\u2013September. By October, the pups, which by then resemble adults, unite in pairs. [[Sexual maturity]] is reached at 8\u201310&nbsp;months. Their [[longevity]] is largely unknown; animals 6\u20137&nbsp;years of age have been encountered in the wild, while captive specimens have been known to live for 11 years.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Hibernation===\nRaccoon dogs are the only canids known to [[hibernation|hibernate]]. In early winter, they increase their subcutaneous fat by 18\u201323% and their internal fat by 3\u20135%. Animals failing to reach these fat levels usually do not survive the winter. During their hibernation, their metabolism decreases by 25%. In areas such as [[Primorsky Krai]] and their introduced range, raccoon dogs hibernate only during severe snowstorms. In December, their physical activity decreases once snow depth reaches 15\u201320&nbsp;cm, and limit the range from their burrows to no more than 150\u2013200 m. Their daily activities increase during February when the females become receptive and when food is more available.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Vocalizations===\nLike foxes, they do not bark, uttering instead a growl, followed by a long-drawn, melancholy whine. Captive specimens have been known to utter daily a very different kind of sound when hungry, described as a sort of mewing plaint.<ref name=\"smith\">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/naturalhistoryof139smit |format=PDF|title=''The natural history of dogs : canidae or genus canis of authors ; including also the genera hyaena and proteles'' |date=1839|author1=Charles Hamilton Smith  |author2=William Jardine |lastauthoramp=yes |location=Edinburgh|publisher=W.H.

[[Primorsky Krai|Primor'e]] in the [[Russian Far East]] was the first region to be colonised, with individuals being transplanted from islands in the [[Sea of Japan]]. By 1934, raccoon dogs were introduced into [[Altai Krai|Altai]], the northern [[Caucasus]], [[Armenia]], [[Kirgizia]], [[Tatarstan]], [[Tver Oblast|Kalinin]], [[Penza Oblast|Penza]], and [[Orenburg Oblast|Orenburg]] regions. In the following year, they were further introduced into [[Leningradsky District, Krasnodar Krai|Leningradsky]], [[Murmansk Oblast|Murmansk]], [[Novosibirsk Oblast|Novosibirsk]], and [[Bashkortostan]].\n\nRaccoon dogs in [[Irkutsk Oblast|Irkutsk]], Novosibirsk, [[Zabaykalsky Krai|Trans-Baikaliya]], and [[Altai Krai|Altai]] did not fare well, due to harsh winters and scarce food. Raccoon dogs also fared badly in the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, [[Central Asia]], and Moldova. However, successful introductions occurred in the [[Baltic States|Baltic states]], European Russia (particularly in [[Tver Oblast|Kalinin]], [[Novgorod Oblast|Novgorod]], [[Pskov Oblast|Pskov]], and [[Smolensk Oblast|Smolensk]] regions), in central Russia ([[Moscow Oblast|Moscow]], [[Yaroslavl Oblast|Yaroslavl]], [[Vologda Oblast|Vologda]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Gorkiy]], [[Vladimir Oblast|Vladimir]], [[Ryazan Oblast|Ryazan]] Oblasts, etc.) as well as in the [[Chernozem|black soil]] belt ([[Voronezh Oblast|Voronezh]], [[Tambov Oblast|Tambov]] and [[Kursk Oblast|Kursk]]), the lower [[Volga Region]] and the level parts of the northern Caucasus and [[Dagestan]]. In Ukraine, the greatest numbers of raccoon dogs were established in [[Poltava Oblast|Poltava]], [[Kherson Oblast|Kherson]], and [[Luhansk Oblast|Lugansk]].<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\nIn 1948, 35&nbsp;raccoon dogs were introduced into Latvia.

Birds amount to 15\u201320% of their diets in Lithuania, 46% on the [[Oka River]] floodlands, and 48.6% in the Voronezh Reserve. They are also harmful to the [[muskrat]] trade, destroying their nests and eating their young. In Ukraine, raccoon dogs are harmful to [[kitchen garden]]s, [[melon]] cultivations, [[vineyard]]s, and [[corn]] seedlings.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\n===Hunting===\nRaccoon dogs are typically hunted from November until the snow deepens. In the [[Far East]], they are hunted at night using [[Laika (dog breed)|Laika]]s and mongrels. In the 19th&nbsp;century, the [[Goldi]] and [[Oroch people]] fastened bells to the collars of their raccoon dog hounds. In their introduced range, raccoon dogs are usually caught incidentally during hunts for other species. [[Fox hunting|Hunting with dogs]] is the most efficient method in raccoon dog hunts, having success rates of 80\u201390%, as opposed to 8\u201310% with guns and 5\u20137% with traps. Unless they retreat in their burrows, hunted raccoon dogs can be quickly strangled by hunting dogs. Traps are usually set at their burrows, along the shores of water bodies, and around marshes and ponds.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\nIn Finland, 60,000\u201370,000 raccoon dogs were hunted in 2000, increasing to 170,000 in 2009 and 164,000 in 2010. Hunting of raccoon dogs in Hungary began in 1997, with an annual catch of one to nine animals. In Poland, 6,200 were shot in 2002\u20132003. Annual Swedish and Danish raccoon dog hunts usually result in the capture of two to seven individuals. Between 18,000 and 70,000&nbsp;Japanese raccoon dogs were killed in Japan from the post-WWII period to 1982. Japan intensified its raccoon dog culling starting in the 1970s, averaging 4,529&nbsp;kills annually between 1990 and 1998. The numbers killed have since decreased.<ref name=canids />\n\n===Fur use===\n[[File:Raccoon_dog_12.jpg|right|thumb|A caged raccoon dog]]\n[[File:Chinese raccoon fur skins.jpg|right|thumb|Chinese raccoon dog pelts on sale in [[Milan]], Italy]]\n\nWhen used on clothing, the fur of the raccoon dog is called \"murmansky\" fur. In the United States, it is marketed as \"Asiatic raccoon\", and in Northern Europe as \"Finn raccoon\".<ref name=furtypes>{{cite web|url=http://www.furcommission.com/farming/mink-biology/furtypes/|title=Fur Types in Brief|work=Furcommission.com|accessdate=2015-04-09}}</ref> Generally, the quality of the pelt is based on the silkiness of the fur, as its physical appeal depends upon the guard hairs being erect, which is only possible in silkier furs. Small raccoon dog pelts with silky fur command higher prices than large, coarse-furred ones. Due to their long and coarse guard hairs and their woolly fur fibre, which has a tendency to felt or mat, raccoon dog pelts are used almost exclusively for fur trimmings. Japanese raccoon dog pelts, though smaller than other geographic variants, are the most valued variety, with specimens from [[Amur Oblast|Amur]] and [[Heilongjiang]] coming close behind, while Korean and southern Chinese are the least valued.<ref name=\"fur\">Bachrach, Max.

The world trade of raccoon dog pelts during 1907\u20131910 amounted to 260,000\u2013300,000, of which an estimated 20,000 (5\u20138%) came from Russia, though more recent figures estimate a lesser number of 5,000\u20136,000; 12,000 raccoon dogs were caught in the 1930s. In their introduced range, licensed trade of raccoon dogs began in 1948\u20131950, with restrictions being removed in 1953\u20131955.\n\nAfter the trade began, the number of catches increased sharply; from 1953\u20131961, it fluctuated between 30,000 and 70,000. In the latter year, about 10,000 were taken from their natural range in the Far East, while 56,000 were taken in their introduced range. Of the 56,000, 6,500 came from Belarus, 5,000 in Ukraine, 4,000 each for Latvia, Lithuania, and [[Krasnodar]], 3,700 in Kalinin, 2,700 in Pskov, and 2,300 in Astrakhan, while 1,000\u20132,000 pelts each were produced in Vologod, Moscow, Leningrad, [[Novogrod]], Smolensk, [[Yaroslavl]], Azerbaijan, Estonia, and [[Dagestan]]. Fewer than 1,000 pelts were produced in all remaining republics and districts. Successful raccoon dog introductions in Kalinin resulted in animals with denser and softer fur: The length of guard and top hairs increased by 7.96%, that of the underfur increased by 5.3%. The thickness of the guard and top hairs decreased by 3.41%. The density of the fur increased by 11.3%. They also became darker in colour, with black-brown pelts occurring in 8% of specimens, as opposed to 3% in their homeland.<ref name=\"soviet\"/>\n\nCaptive breeding of raccoon dogs was initiated in 1928 in the [[Far East]], with 15&nbsp;state farms keeping them in 1934. Raccoon dogs were the principal furbearers farmed during the early years of collective farms, particularly in Ukraine. By the 1940s, this practice lessened in popularity, as the raccoon dogs required almost the same types of food as [[Silver fox (animal)|silver fox]]es, which were more valuable.<ref name=\"soviet\"/> An investigation by three animal protection groups into the Chinese fur trade in 2004 and part of 2005 asserts approximately 1.5&nbsp;million raccoon dogs are raised for fur in China.<ref>Hsieh-Yi, Yi-Chiao, Yu Fu, Mark Rissi and Dr Barbara Maas [http://www.careforthewild.com/files/Furreport05.pdf Fun Fur?

''[[The Bluffers]]'', which was based on one of Deitch's ideas, was also co-produced by him. He directed the 1966 film ''[[Alice of Wonderland in Paris]]''. In 1966, he worked with Czech animator [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Trnka]] on a feature-length animated film adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit]]''. However, producer William L. Snyder couldn't secure the funds, and in order to not let the rights for the novel expire, he asked Deitch to produce a short film adaptation in 30 days. Deitch and illustrator [[Adolf Born]] made a 13-minute animated film never intended for distribution; the film was long considered lost until it was rediscovered by Snyder's son and released on [[YouTube]] in 2012.<ref name=DVTV>{{cite web|url=https://video.aktualne.cz/dvtv/jsi-bud-komunista-nebo-blazen-slychaval-ceskoslovensko-bylo/r~a96bd4a84c8211e880d30cc47ab5f122/?redirected=1526714757|title=Jsi bu\u010f komunista, nebo bl\u00e1zen, sl\u00fdch\u00e1val. \u010ceskoslovensko bylo jako st\u0159edov\u011bk, l\u00ed\u010d\u00ed dr\u017eitel Oscara / 'You are either a communist or a fool': Czechoslovakia was like the Middle Ages, says the Oscar winner| publisher=[[DVTV]]| date= n.d.|accessdate=May 19, 2018|location=Czech Republic|language=czech}}</ref> Also in 1966, Deitch created a young girl adventurer in ''Terr'ble Tessie.''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/terrble.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 12, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fEh3AEBM?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/terrble.htm |archivedate=February 12, 2016  }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1969 until his retirement in 2008, Deitch was the leading animation director for the Connecticut organization [[Weston Woods Studios]], adapting children's picture books.

One definition defines an empire as a [[Sovereign state|state]] that extends [[dominion]] over areas and populations [[culturally]] and [[ethnically]] distinct  from the culture/ethnicity at the center of power.  \n\n== History of Muslim states==\nThe [[early Muslim conquests]] began in the lifetime of [[Muhammad]]. His successors conquered large swaths of the Middle East and North Africa, in addition to parts of [[southern Europe]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]], in the decades after his death.  The [[caliphate]] founded by his earliest successors, called the [[Rashidun caliphate]], was succeeded by the [[Umayyad caliphate]] and later the [[Abbasid caliphate]].\n\nWhile the caliphates gradually fractured and fell, other Muslim dynasties rose; some of these dynasties grew into \"Islamic empires\", with some of the most notable being the Safavid, Ottoman, and Mughal Empires.\n\n==

"{{dablinks|date=March 2020}}\n{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=October 2017}}\n(This article lists some of the '''states''', '''empires''', or '''dynasties''' that were ruled by a Muslim elite, or which were in some way central to or a part of a Muslim empire.)   \n\nAll the disparate Islamic Empires can all be traced back to Muhammad, as the founder not only of the Islamic faith but also the first leader of the Muslim people.   \n\nScholars debate what exactly constitutes an [[empire]]. One definition defines an empire as a [[Sovereign state|state]] that extends [[dominion]] over areas and populations [[culturally]] and [[ethnically]] distinct  from the culture/ethnicity at the center of power.  \n\n== History of Muslim states==\nThe [[early Muslim conquests]] began in the lifetime of [[Muhammad]]. His successors conquered large swaths of the Middle East and North Africa, in addition to parts of [[southern Europe]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]], in the decades after his death.  The [[caliphate]] founded by his earliest successors, called the [[Rashidun caliphate]], was succeeded by the [[Umayyad caliphate]] and later the [[Abbasid caliphate]].\n\nWhile the caliphates gradually fractured and fell, other Muslim dynasties rose; some of these dynasties grew into \"Islamic empires\", with some of the most notable being the Safavid, Ottoman, and Mughal Empires.\n\n==
