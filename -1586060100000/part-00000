His works often deal with the extremes of human experience, from death and degradation to religious exaltation. His name, '''Michel de Ghelderode''', is a pseudonym, he was born Ad\u00e9mar Adolphe Louis Martens.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nGhelderode's father, Henri-Louis Martens, was employed as a royal archivist, a line of work later to be pursued by young Ghelderode. The author's mother, n\u00e9e Jeanne-Marie Rans, was a former postulant for holy orders; even after bearing four children, of whom Ghelderode was the youngest, she retained evident traces of her erstwhile vocation that would strongly influence the mature Ghelderode's dramatic work: One of Mme Martens's remembered \"spiritual tales,\" concerning a child mistakenly buried alive who remained strangely marked by death even after her rescue, inspired most of the plot and characters of Ghelderode's ''Mademoiselle Jaire'' (1934) written when the author was in his mid-thirties.\n\nHe was in military service from 1919 \u2013 1921 and in 1924 married Jeanne-Fran\u00e7oise G\u00e9rard (d. 1980).\n\nGhelderode became increasingly reclusive from 1930 onwards and was chronically ill with asthma during his late thirties. Frequently suffering from poor health, around the age of sixteen, while pursuing his studies at the Institut St.-Louis in Brussels, he fell gravely ill with typhus. He would retain for the rest of his life the vision of \"a Lady\" who materialized at his bedside to utter the words, \"not now, sixty-three.\" Ghelderode in fact died two days short of what would have been his sixty-fourth birthday in 1962. He is buried in the [[Laeken Cemetery]], Brussels.\n\n==Influences==\n\nGhelderode's influences include [[puppet]] theater, Italian [[commedia dell'arte]], the medieval world of Flanders, the Flemish painters [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch]], [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]], [[Jacob Jordaens]] and the [[Teniers]], along with the Belgian artist [[James Ensor]], painter of the macabre, and the novelist [[Georges Eekhoud]].\n\n==Career==\n\nA prolific writer, Ghelderode wrote more than 60 plays, a hundred stories, a number of articles on art and folklore and more than 20,000 letters.\n\nHe began writing plays in French in 1916. ''La mort regarde \u00e0 la fen\u00eatre'' (Death Looks In at the Window) was produced in 1918, followed by ''Le repas des fauves'' (The Beasts' Meal) in 1919. In 1921 and 1922 he was a professor at the Institut Dupuich but resigned because of ill health. The following year he worked as a bookseller. In 1923 Ghelderode earned the post of archives editor in the Communale de Schaerbeek, where he worked in a variety of capacities until 1945. In 1924 he began contributing to such publications as ''La Flandre litt\u00e9raire'' and ''La Renaissance d'Occident'' and wrote plays for the puppet theater ''Les Marionnettes de la Renaissance d'Occident''. Ghelderode began staging plays again in 1925, working with the Dutch producer Johan de Meester, a collaboration which lasted until 1930. ''Escurial'' (1927) is one of his most frequently performed plays. Widely recognized as one of his finest achievements, it exhibits [[German Expressionism]] and [[Symbolist]] influences. He wrote ''Pantagleize'' (1929) expressly for the Flemish comedian Renaat Verheyen, who died aged twenty-six, shortly after appearing in the title role.\n\nGhelderode completely gave up writing plays in 1939. Between 1946 and 1953 he wrote for ''Le Journal de Bruges''. A 1949 production of ''Fastes d'enfer'' (Chronicles of Hell), originally written in 1929, caused a huge scandal on its opening night, an event that ensured his popularity.\n\n==Themes and style==\n\nHe is the creator of a fantastic and disturbing, often macabre, grotesque and cruel world filled with [[mannequins]], puppets, devils, masks, [[skeletons]], religious paraphernalia, and mysterious old women. His works create an eerie and unsettling atmosphere although they rarely contain anything explicitly scary.\n\nA strong anticlerical streak runs through many of Ghelderode's plays, mitigated by a spirituality which stops short of true belief. Throughout Ghelderode's theatrical universe, religion is more often honored than adhered to. Sensuality is another dominant characteristic prominent in almost all of Ghelderode's plays, often in unattractive forms. Gluttony and heavy drinking loom large, as does lust, often represented by hag-like female characters with suggestive names.\n\nAccording to Oscar G. Brockett, the works of Ghelderode resemble those of [[Alfred Jarry]], the surrealists and the expressionists, and his theories are similar to those of [[Antonin Artaud]]. Through nearly all of his plays runs his perception of human beings as creatures whose flesh overpowers spirit. \"Corruption, death and cruelty are always near the surface [of Ghelderode's work], although behind them lurks an implied criticism of degradation and materialism and a call to repentance \"<ref>Beockett, Oscar Gross, History of the Theatre/ Oscar G.

Although many of his plays have since been translated into English, his works are infrequently performed in English-speaking countries. Writing in October 1957 on the occasion of the first of his plays to be seen publicly in England, Ghelderode declared \u2013\n\n:''The moral of this sad story \u2013 and the story of man is always sad, absurd, and void of meaning, as Shakespeare wrote \u2013 it is that in our atomic and auto-disintegrated age, this age from which dreams and dreamers are banished in favor of the scientific nightmare and the beneficiaries of the future horror, a fellow like Pantagleize remains an [[archetype]], an exemplary man and a fine example who has nothing to do with that dangerous thing, intelligence, and a great deal to do with that savior, instinct.

[[Benzylpiperazine|BZP]] is banned in a few countries, including the USA, Republic of Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, but is available on a more or less restricted basis in many jurisdictions.

The historical background of its formation was the territorial extension since 980 of the [[Principality of Li\u00e8ge]] to the south and west.\n\nDespite its rich [[literature]], beginning anonymously in the 16th century and with well-known authors since 1756, the use of Walloon has decreased markedly since France's annexation of [[Wallonia]] in 1795.  This period definitively established French as the language of social promotion, far more than it was before.<ref>\"It seems the revolutionaries themselves consider the fact French was enough close to the Walloon language so as not to manage Wallonia as Brittany, Corsica, Alsace or Flanders.\" {{in lang|fr}} \"{{lang|fr|Le d\u00e9cret du 8 pluvi\u00f4se An II (...) ne pr\u00e9voit pas d'envoyer des instituteurs dans la Wallonie romane (contre l'avis de [[Henri Gr\u00e9goire|Gr\u00e9goire]] qui souhaitait une campagne linguistique couvrant tout le territoire).

Subsequently, since the middle of the 20th century, generational transmission of the language has decreased, resulting in Walloon almost becoming a [[Language death|dead language]]. Today it is scarcely spoken among younger people, with vast majority of its native speakers being the [[Elderly people|elderly]] (aged 65 and over). In 1996, the number of people with knowledge of the language was estimated at between 1 and 1.3 million.<ref>{{Cite book |language=French |chapter= Chapitre Evaluer la vitalit\u00e9 : vari\u00e9t\u00e9s d'oil et autres langues |author=Jean-Michel Eloy|title=actes du Colloque international, \" Evaluer la vitalit\u00e9 des vari\u00e9t\u00e9s r\u00e9gionales du domaine d'o\u00efl \" |location=Amiens |publisher=Centre d'\u00e9tudes picardes |date=29\u201330 November 1996}}</ref>\n\nNumerous [[Non-governmental organization|associations]], especially [[theatre company|theatre companies]], are working to keep the language alive. Formally recognized as a ''{{lang|fr|[[langue r\u00e9gionale endog\u00e8ne]]}}'' (regional indigenous language) of Belgium since 1990,<ref>D\u00e9cret Valmy F\u00e9aux, 14 of December 1990</ref> Walloon has also benefited from a continued [[corpus planning]] process. The \"Feller system\" (1900) regularized transcription of the different accents. Since the 1990s, a common [[orthography]] was established (the {{ill|Rifondou walon|wa|Rifondou walon|fr|Wallon unifi\u00e9}}, which allowed large-scale publications, such as the [[:wa:Mwaisse p\u00e5dje|''Walloon Wikipedia'']] officially in 2003. In 2004, a Walloon translation of a ''[[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]]'' comic was released under the name ''[[The Castafiore Emerald|L'\u00e8mer\u00f4de d'al Castafiore]]''; in 2007 an album consisting of [[Gaston Lagaffe]] comic strips was published in Walloon.\n\nWalloon is more distinct as a language than [[Belgian French]], which differs from the French spoken in [[France]] only in some minor points of [[vocabulary]] and [[pronunciation]].\n\n== Disputed nature of Walloon ==\n[[File:Plake Hesta.JPG|thumb|''{{lang|wa|H\u00e8sta}}'', the Walloon name of the city of [[Herstal]]]]\nLinguists had long classified Walloon as a [[dialect]] of French, which in turn is a ''{{lang|fr|[[langue d'o\u00efl]]}}''. Like French, it descended from [[Vulgar Latin]].  Arguing that a French-speaking person could not understand Walloon easily, especially in its eastern forms, [[Jules Feller]] (1859\u20131940) insisted that Walloon had an original \"superior unity\", which made it a [[language]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Feller Jules | title = Notes de philologie wallonne | publisher = Vaillant Carmanne | location = Li\u00e8ge | year = 1912}}</ref>\n\nThe phonological divisions of regional languages of southern Belgium were studied by the contemporary linguist E.B. Atwood. He defined the precise geographical repartition of the four chief dialects of Walloon. In addition, he defined them against the dialects of [[Picard language|Picard]], [[Lorrain language|Lorrain]] and [[Champenois]].<ref>E.B. Atwood, \"The phonological divisions of Belgo-Romance\", in ''Orbis'', 4, 1955, pp. 367-389.</ref>\n\nSince then, most linguists (among them [[Louis Remacle]]), and gradually also Walloon politicians, regard Walloon as a regional language, the first in importance in [[Wallonia]]. It is the only one to have originated from that part of [[Belgium]]. The eleventh edition of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' identified Walloon as the \"northern-most Romance language\".\n\n==Geographic distribution==\n===Walloon===\nWalloon is spoken in the [[Wallonia]] Region in Belgium. In addition, it is spoken in:\n* a small part of [[France]]: the ''[[:fr:botte de Givet|botte de Givet]]'' in northern [[Ardennes (d\u00e9partement)|Ardennes]], and several villages in the [[Nord (d\u00e9partement)|Nord]] [[Departments of France|''d\u00e9partement'']], making it one of the regional [[languages of France]];\n* a small district of [[Door County, Wisconsin]], US, owing to fairly large-scale immigration there in the 19th century;<ref>[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/WI/subcollections/BelgAmrColAbout.html \"Belgian-American Research Collection\"], University of Wisconsin</ref> as well as portions of [[Kewaunee County, Wisconsin]], US, and [[Brown County, Wisconsin]], US;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://phlegmish-walloony.blogspot.com/2015/10/walloon-ancestry-in-wisconsin-usa.html|title=Phlegmish & Walloony: Walloon ancestry in Wisconsin (USA)|last=Mf|date=2015-10-17|website=Phlegmish & Walloony|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> and\n* [[Brussels]], by some Walloon residents.\n\nAlthough Walloon was widely spoken until the mid-20th century, today only a small proportion of the inhabitants of the region are fluent in the language. Those born since the 1970s usually know little more than a few [[idiomatic expression]]s, often [[Profanity|profanities]]. The Walloon language is still part of the Walloon heritage; it is one component of Walloon identity.\n\n===Dialects===\n[[File:Linguistic map of Wallonia.png|thumb|Linguistic map of Wallonia]]\n[[File:Wallonie-linguistique-wa.svg|thumb|500px|Main subdivisions of Walloon dialects]]\n\nFour dialects of Walloon developed in four distinct zones of Wallonia:<ref>Steven G. Kellman ''Switching languages: translingual writers reflect on their craft'', p.152.</ref>\n* Central, spoken in [[Namur (city)|Namur]] (''{{lang|wa|Nameur}}''), the Wallon capital, and the cities of [[Wavre]] (''{{lang|wa|\u00c5ve}}'') and [[Dinant]];\n* Eastern \u2013 in many respects the most conservative and idiosyncratic of the dialects, spoken in [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]] (''{{lang|wa|Lidje}}''), [[Verviers]] (''{{lang|wa|Verv\u00ee}}''), [[Malmedy]] (''{{lang|wa|M\u00e5mdi}}''), [[Huy]] (''{{lang|wa|Hu}}''), and [[Waremme]] (''{{lang|wa|Wareme}}'');\n* Western \u2013 the dialect closest to French proper and with a strong [[Picard language|Picard]] influence, spoken in [[Charleroi]] (''{{lang|wa|Tch\u00e5rlerw\u00e8}}''), [[Nivelles]] (''{{lang|wa|Nivele}}''), and [[Philippeville]] (''{{lang|wa|Flipvile}}''); and\n* Southern \u2013 close to the [[Lorrain language|Lorrain]] and to a lesser extent [[Champenois]] languages, spoken in [[Bastogne]], [[Marche-en-Famenne]] (''{{lang|wa|M\u00e5tche-el-F\u00e5mene}}''), and [[Neufch\u00e2teau, Luxembourg Province|Neufch\u00e2teau]] (''{{lang|wa|Li Tchestea}}''), all in the [[Ardennes]] region.\n\nDespite local [[phonetic]] differences, there is a regional movement towards the adoption of a common spelling, called the [[:wa:Rifondou walon|Rifondou walon]]. This [[orthography]] is [[diasystem]]ic, reflecting different pronunciations for different readers, a concept inspired by the spelling of [[Breton language|Breton]]. The written forms attempt to reconcile current phonetic uses with ancient traditions (notably the reintroduction of ''xh'' and ''oi'' that were used for writing Walloon until the late 19th century) and the language's own [[phonology|phonological]] logic.\n\n===Other regional languages===\nOther regional languages spoken in Wallonia, outside the Walloon domain, are:\n* [[Picard language|Picard]], in [[Mons]], [[Ath]], and [[Tournai]];\n* [[Lorrain language|Lorrain]] (also called ''Gaumais'' locally), in [[Virton]];\n* [[Champenois language|Champenois]], in [[Bohan, Wallon Region|Bohan]]; and\n* [[Luxembourgish]], in [[Arlon]] and [[Martelange]].\n\nThe Picard, Lorrain and Champenois dialects spoken in Wallonia are sometimes also referred to as \"Walloon\", which may lead to confusion.\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Language family===\nWalloon is distinguished from other languages in the ''[[langue d'o\u00efl]]'' family both by archaism coming from Latin and by its significant borrowing from Germanic languages, as expressed in its phonetics, its [[lexicon]], and its [[grammar]]. At the same time, Walloon phonetics are singularly conservative: the language has stayed fairly close to the form it took during the [[High Middle Ages]].\n\n=== Phonetics and phonology ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Consonant phonemes of Walloon\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n!

Walloon \"had a clearly defined identity from the beginning of the 13th century\". In any case, linguistic{{Clarify|date=February 2015}} texts from the time do not mention the language, although they mention others in the ''[[langue d'o\u00efl]]'' family, such as [[Picard language|Picard]] and [[Lorrain language|Lorrain]]. During the 15th century, scribes in the region called the language \"Roman\" when they needed to distinguish it. It is not until the beginning of the 16th century that first occurrence of the word \"Walloon\" appeared in the current linguistic sense. In 1510 or 1511, [[Jean Lemaire de Belges]] made the connection between ''{{lang|frm|Rommand}}'' to ''{{lang|frm|Vualon}}'':\n\n{{quote|''{{lang|frm|Et ceux cy [les habitants de Nivelles] parlent le vieil langage Gallique que nous appellons Vualon ou Rommand (\u2026). Et de ladite ancienne langue Vualonne, ou Rommande, nous usons en nostre Gaule Belgique: Cestadire en Haynau, Cambresis, Artois, Namur, Liege, Lorraine, Ardenne et le Rommanbrabant, et est beaucoup differente du Fran\u00e7ois, lequel est plus moderne, et plus gaillart.}}''}}\n\n{{quote|And those people [the inhabitants of Nivelles] speak the old Gallic language which we call Vualon or Rommand (\u2026). And we use the said old Vualon or Rommand language in our Belgian Gaul: That is to say in Hainaut, Cambrai, Artois, Namur, Li\u00e8ge, Lorraine, Ardennes and Rommand Brabant, and it is very different from French, which is more fashionable and courtly.}}\n\nThe word \"Walloon\" thus came closer to its current meaning: the [[vernacular]] of the Roman part of the [[Low Countries]]. One might say that the period which saw the establishment of the unifying supremacy of the [[Burgundian (party)|Burgundians]] in the Walloon country was a turning-point in their linguistic history. The crystallization of a Walloon identity, as opposed to that of the ''{{lang|fr|thiois}}'' (i.e. Dutch-speaking) regions of the Low Countries, established \"Walloon\" as a word for designating its people. Somewhat later, the vernacular of these people became more clearly distinct from central French and other neighbouring ''langues d'o\u00efl'', prompting the abandonment of the vague term \"Roman\" as a linguistic, ethnic, and political designator for \"Walloon\".\n\nAlso at this time, following the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotter\u00eats]] in 1539, the French language replaced Latin for all administrative purposes in France. Established as the academic language, French became the object of a political effort at normalization; ''{{lang|fr|[[La Pl\u00e9iade]]}}'' posited the view that when two languages of the same [[language family]] coexist, each can be defined only in opposition to the other. Around the year 1600, the [[French language#Writing system|French writing system]] became dominant in the Wallonia. From this time, too, dates a tradition of texts written in a language marked by traces of spoken Walloon. The written language of the preceding centuries, ''scripta'', was a composite language with some Walloon characteristics but it did not attempt to be a systematic reproduction of the spoken language.\n\n==Walloon society and culture==\n[[File:Fosses-la-Ville JPG06W.jpg|thumb|[[Bilingual sign|Bilingual]] French-Walloon street sign in [[Fosses-la-Ville]]]]\n\nWalloon was the predominant language of the Walloon people until the beginning of the 20th century, although they had a passing knowledge of French. Since that time, the use of French has spread to the extent that now only 15% of the Walloon population speak their ancestral language. Breaking the statistics down by age, 70\u201380% of the population aged over 60 speak Walloon, while only about 10% of those under 30 do so. Passing knowledge of Walloon is much more widespread: claimed by some 36\u201358% of the younger age bracket. Laurent Hendschel estimates there are 1,300,000 bilingual people in Wallonia (Walloon-French, Picard-French...).<ref>Some other figures in Laurent Hendschel, \"Quelques indices pour se faire une id\u00e9e de la vitalit\u00e9 du Wallon\", in Lucien Mahin (editor), ''Qu\u00e9 walon po dmwin?'', Quorum, 1999, p. 128. {{ISBN|2-87399-072-4}}</ref> Many French words that pertain to mining and to the textile trade derive from the Walloon-Picard complex.<ref>Steven G. Kellman, ''Switching languages: translingual writers reflect on their craft'', p.152.</ref>\n\nLegally, Walloon has been recognized since 1990 by the [[French Community of Belgium]], the cultural authority of Wallonia, as an \"indigenous regional language\" which must be studied in schools and encouraged. The Walloon cultural movement includes the ''Union Culturelle Wallonne'', an organization of over 200 amateur theatre circles, writers' groups, and school councils. About a dozen Walloon magazines publish regularly.  The ''{{lang|fr|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Langue et de Litt\u00e9rature Wallonne}}'', founded in 1856, promotes Walloon literature and the study ([[dialectology]], [[etymology]], etc.) of the regional Roman languages of Wallonia.  There is a difference between the Walloon culture, according to the [[Manifesto for Walloon culture]], and the Walloon language (even if the latter is a part of the culture).{{vague|date=October 2013}} <!-- Every language is only part of a culture and not the culture itself.

In 2004, a Walloon translation of a ''[[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]]'' comic was released under the name ''[[The Castafiore Emerald|L'\u00e8mer\u00f4de d'al Castafiore]]''; in 2007 an album consisting of [[Gaston Lagaffe]] comic strips was published in Walloon.\n\nWalloon is more distinct as a language than [[Belgian French]], which differs from the French spoken in [[France]] only in some minor points of [[vocabulary]] and [[pronunciation]].\n\n== Disputed nature of Walloon ==\n[[File:Plake Hesta.JPG|thumb|''{{lang|wa|H\u00e8sta}}'', the Walloon name of the city of [[Herstal]]]]\nLinguists had long classified Walloon as a [[dialect]] of French, which in turn is a ''{{lang|fr|[[langue d'o\u00efl]]}}''. Like French, it descended from [[Vulgar Latin]].  Arguing that a French-speaking person could not understand Walloon easily, especially in its eastern forms, [[Jules Feller]] (1859\u20131940) insisted that Walloon had an original \"superior unity\", which made it a [[language]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Feller Jules | title = Notes de philologie wallonne | publisher = Vaillant Carmanne | location = Li\u00e8ge | year = 1912}}</ref>\n\nThe phonological divisions of regional languages of southern Belgium were studied by the contemporary linguist E.B. Atwood. He defined the precise geographical repartition of the four chief dialects of Walloon. In addition, he defined them against the dialects of [[Picard language|Picard]], [[Lorrain language|Lorrain]] and [[Champenois]].<ref>E.B. Atwood, \"The phonological divisions of Belgo-Romance\", in ''Orbis'', 4, 1955, pp. 367-389.</ref>\n\nSince then, most linguists (among them [[Louis Remacle]]), and gradually also Walloon politicians, regard Walloon as a regional language, the first in importance in [[Wallonia]]. It is the only one to have originated from that part of [[Belgium]]. The eleventh edition of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' identified Walloon as the \"northern-most Romance language\".\n\n==Geographic distribution==\n===Walloon===\nWalloon is spoken in the [[Wallonia]] Region in Belgium. In addition, it is spoken in:\n* a small part of [[France]]: the ''[[:fr:botte de Givet|botte de Givet]]'' in northern [[Ardennes (d\u00e9partement)|Ardennes]], and several villages in the [[Nord (d\u00e9partement)|Nord]] [[Departments of France|''d\u00e9partement'']], making it one of the regional [[languages of France]];\n* a small district of [[Door County, Wisconsin]], US, owing to fairly large-scale immigration there in the 19th century;<ref>[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/WI/subcollections/BelgAmrColAbout.html \"Belgian-American Research Collection\"], University of Wisconsin</ref> as well as portions of [[Kewaunee County, Wisconsin]], US, and [[Brown County, Wisconsin]], US;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://phlegmish-walloony.blogspot.com/2015/10/walloon-ancestry-in-wisconsin-usa.html|title=Phlegmish & Walloony: Walloon ancestry in Wisconsin (USA)|last=Mf|date=2015-10-17|website=Phlegmish & Walloony|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> and\n* [[Brussels]], by some Walloon residents.\n\nAlthough Walloon was widely spoken until the mid-20th century, today only a small proportion of the inhabitants of the region are fluent in the language. Those born since the 1970s usually know little more than a few [[idiomatic expression]]s, often [[Profanity|profanities]]. The Walloon language is still part of the Walloon heritage; it is one component of Walloon identity.\n\n===Dialects===\n[[File:Linguistic map of Wallonia.png|thumb|Linguistic map of Wallonia]]\n[[File:Wallonie-linguistique-wa.svg|thumb|500px|Main subdivisions of Walloon dialects]]\n\nFour dialects of Walloon developed in four distinct zones of Wallonia:<ref>Steven G. Kellman ''Switching languages: translingual writers reflect on their craft'', p.152.</ref>\n* Central, spoken in [[Namur (city)|Namur]] (''{{lang|wa|Nameur}}''), the Wallon capital, and the cities of [[Wavre]] (''{{lang|wa|\u00c5ve}}'') and [[Dinant]];\n* Eastern \u2013 in many respects the most conservative and idiosyncratic of the dialects, spoken in [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]] (''{{lang|wa|Lidje}}''), [[Verviers]] (''{{lang|wa|Verv\u00ee}}''), [[Malmedy]] (''{{lang|wa|M\u00e5mdi}}''), [[Huy]] (''{{lang|wa|Hu}}''), and [[Waremme]] (''{{lang|wa|Wareme}}'');\n* Western \u2013 the dialect closest to French proper and with a strong [[Picard language|Picard]] influence, spoken in [[Charleroi]] (''{{lang|wa|Tch\u00e5rlerw\u00e8}}''), [[Nivelles]] (''{{lang|wa|Nivele}}''), and [[Philippeville]] (''{{lang|wa|Flipvile}}''); and\n* Southern \u2013 close to the [[Lorrain language|Lorrain]] and to a lesser extent [[Champenois]] languages, spoken in [[Bastogne]], [[Marche-en-Famenne]] (''{{lang|wa|M\u00e5tche-el-F\u00e5mene}}''), and [[Neufch\u00e2teau, Luxembourg Province|Neufch\u00e2teau]] (''{{lang|wa|Li Tchestea}}''), all in the [[Ardennes]] region.\n\nDespite local [[phonetic]] differences, there is a regional movement towards the adoption of a common spelling, called the [[:wa:Rifondou walon|Rifondou walon]]. This [[orthography]] is [[diasystem]]ic, reflecting different pronunciations for different readers, a concept inspired by the spelling of [[Breton language|Breton]]. The written forms attempt to reconcile current phonetic uses with ancient traditions (notably the reintroduction of ''xh'' and ''oi'' that were used for writing Walloon until the late 19th century) and the language's own [[phonology|phonological]] logic.\n\n===Other regional languages===\nOther regional languages spoken in Wallonia, outside the Walloon domain, are:\n* [[Picard language|Picard]], in [[Mons]], [[Ath]], and [[Tournai]];\n* [[Lorrain language|Lorrain]] (also called ''Gaumais'' locally), in [[Virton]];\n* [[Champenois language|Champenois]], in [[Bohan, Wallon Region|Bohan]]; and\n* [[Luxembourgish]], in [[Arlon]] and [[Martelange]].\n\nThe Picard, Lorrain and Champenois dialects spoken in Wallonia are sometimes also referred to as \"Walloon\", which may lead to confusion.\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Language family===\nWalloon is distinguished from other languages in the ''[[langue d'o\u00efl]]'' family both by archaism coming from Latin and by its significant borrowing from Germanic languages, as expressed in its phonetics, its [[lexicon]], and its [[grammar]]. At the same time, Walloon phonetics are singularly conservative: the language has stayed fairly close to the form it took during the [[High Middle Ages]].\n\n=== Phonetics and phonology ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Consonant phonemes of Walloon\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n!

Other common borrowings, among hundreds of others, are {{lang|wa|dringuele}} (\"tip\"; Dutch {{lang|nl|drinkgeld}}), {{lang|wa|crole}} (\"curl\"; Dutch {{lang|nl|krul}}), {{lang|wa|spiter}} (\"to spatter\"; same root as the English ''to spit'', and ''to spew'',  or German {{lang|de|sp\u00fctzen}}; Dutch {{lang|nl|spuwen}}), {{lang|wa|li sprewe}} (the [[starling]]; Dutch {{lang|nl|spreeuw}}, or German {{lang|de|Sperling}}).\n\n=== Syntax ===\n* The adjective is often placed before the noun: compare Walloon {{lang|wa|on foirt ome}} \"a strong man\" with French {{lang|fr|un homme fort}}; {{lang|wa|ene blanke m\u00e5jhon}} \"a white house\" and French {{lang|fr|une maison blanche}}.\n* Borrowing from Germanic languages: the construction {{lang|wa|Cw\u00e8 \u00e7ki c'est di \u00e7a po ene fleur?}} \"What kind of flower is this?\" can be compared word for word to German {{lang|de|Was ist das f\u00fcr eine Blume?}} and Dutch {{lang|nl|Wat is dat voor een bloem?}}, as opposed to Standard French {{lang|fr|Quelle sorte de fleur est-ce?}} or (colloquially) {{lang|fr|Quelle sorte de fleur est-ce que c'est?}}.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Crupet JPGW.jpg|thumb|An [[Inn|auberge]]'s sign in [[Crupet]]]]\n\nFrom a linguistic point of view, [[Louis Remacle]] has shown that a good number of the developments that we now consider typical of Walloon appeared between the 8th and 12th centuries. Walloon \"had a clearly defined identity from the beginning of the 13th century\". In any case, linguistic{{Clarify|date=February 2015}} texts from the time do not mention the language, although they mention others in the ''[[langue d'o\u00efl]]'' family, such as [[Picard language|Picard]] and [[Lorrain language|Lorrain]]. During the 15th century, scribes in the region called the language \"Roman\" when they needed to distinguish it. It is not until the beginning of the 16th century that first occurrence of the word \"Walloon\" appeared in the current linguistic sense. In 1510 or 1511, [[Jean Lemaire de Belges]] made the connection between ''{{lang|frm|Rommand}}'' to ''{{lang|frm|Vualon}}'':\n\n{{quote|''{{lang|frm|Et ceux cy [les habitants de Nivelles] parlent le vieil langage Gallique que nous appellons Vualon ou Rommand (\u2026). Et de ladite ancienne langue Vualonne, ou Rommande, nous usons en nostre Gaule Belgique: Cestadire en Haynau, Cambresis, Artois, Namur, Liege, Lorraine, Ardenne et le Rommanbrabant, et est beaucoup differente du Fran\u00e7ois, lequel est plus moderne, et plus gaillart.}}''}}\n\n{{quote|And those people [the inhabitants of Nivelles] speak the old Gallic language which we call Vualon or Rommand (\u2026). And we use the said old Vualon or Rommand language in our Belgian Gaul: That is to say in Hainaut, Cambrai, Artois, Namur, Li\u00e8ge, Lorraine, Ardennes and Rommand Brabant, and it is very different from French, which is more fashionable and courtly.}}\n\nThe word \"Walloon\" thus came closer to its current meaning: the [[vernacular]] of the Roman part of the [[Low Countries]]. One might say that the period which saw the establishment of the unifying supremacy of the [[Burgundian (party)|Burgundians]] in the Walloon country was a turning-point in their linguistic history. The crystallization of a Walloon identity, as opposed to that of the ''{{lang|fr|thiois}}'' (i.e. Dutch-speaking) regions of the Low Countries, established \"Walloon\" as a word for designating its people. Somewhat later, the vernacular of these people became more clearly distinct from central French and other neighbouring ''langues d'o\u00efl'', prompting the abandonment of the vague term \"Roman\" as a linguistic, ethnic, and political designator for \"Walloon\".\n\nAlso at this time, following the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotter\u00eats]] in 1539, the French language replaced Latin for all administrative purposes in France. Established as the academic language, French became the object of a political effort at normalization; ''{{lang|fr|[[La Pl\u00e9iade]]}}'' posited the view that when two languages of the same [[language family]] coexist, each can be defined only in opposition to the other. Around the year 1600, the [[French language#Writing system|French writing system]] became dominant in the Wallonia. From this time, too, dates a tradition of texts written in a language marked by traces of spoken Walloon. The written language of the preceding centuries, ''scripta'', was a composite language with some Walloon characteristics but it did not attempt to be a systematic reproduction of the spoken language.\n\n==Walloon society and culture==\n[[File:Fosses-la-Ville JPG06W.jpg|thumb|[[Bilingual sign|Bilingual]] French-Walloon street sign in [[Fosses-la-Ville]]]]\n\nWalloon was the predominant language of the Walloon people until the beginning of the 20th century, although they had a passing knowledge of French. Since that time, the use of French has spread to the extent that now only 15% of the Walloon population speak their ancestral language. Breaking the statistics down by age, 70\u201380% of the population aged over 60 speak Walloon, while only about 10% of those under 30 do so. Passing knowledge of Walloon is much more widespread: claimed by some 36\u201358% of the younger age bracket. Laurent Hendschel estimates there are 1,300,000 bilingual people in Wallonia (Walloon-French, Picard-French...).<ref>Some other figures in Laurent Hendschel, \"Quelques indices pour se faire une id\u00e9e de la vitalit\u00e9 du Wallon\", in Lucien Mahin (editor), ''Qu\u00e9 walon po dmwin?'', Quorum, 1999, p. 128. {{ISBN|2-87399-072-4}}</ref> Many French words that pertain to mining and to the textile trade derive from the Walloon-Picard complex.<ref>Steven G.

The Walloon cultural movement includes the ''Union Culturelle Wallonne'', an organization of over 200 amateur theatre circles, writers' groups, and school councils. About a dozen Walloon magazines publish regularly.  The ''{{lang|fr|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Langue et de Litt\u00e9rature Wallonne}}'', founded in 1856, promotes Walloon literature and the study ([[dialectology]], [[etymology]], etc.) of the regional Roman languages of Wallonia.  There is a difference between the Walloon culture, according to the [[Manifesto for Walloon culture]], and the Walloon language (even if the latter is a part of the culture).{{vague|date=October 2013}} <!-- Every language is only part of a culture and not the culture itself.

Afterwards, the Moonlanders stop the invasion and the family celebrates, unaware they're being watched by the secret organization F.O.W.L.\n |LineColor       = F89E32\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 3 (2020) ===\n{{Episode table|background=#960018|overall=|season=|title=|director=|writer=|aux2=|aux2T=Storyboard by|airdate=|prodcode=|prodcodeR=|viewers=|country=U.S.|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 48\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = Challenge of the Senior Junior Woodchucks!\n |RTitle          = \n |DirectedBy      = Matthew Humphreys\n |WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay|s=Francisco Angones, Madison Bateman, Colleen Evanson, Christian Magalhaes & Bob Snow|t=Angones & Bateman}}\n |Aux2            = Stephanie Gonzaga, Krystal Ureta & Brandon Warren\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|4}}\n |ProdCode        =  \n |Viewers         = \n |ShortSummary    = As part of their Junior Woodchuck graduation, Huey and Violet must compete in a challenge to earn the title of Senior Woodchuck. Panicked by the possibility of losing, Huey hallucinates a talking Junior Woodchuck guidebook ([[Stephen Root]]) to aid him and ignores Violet when she was endangered. After Violet saves his life, he admits she's a better Woodchuck and forfeits the competition. Meanwhile, Scrooge finds a map to the treasure of Isabella Finch, but his attempts to find it are thwarted when the rest of the family decide to follow a strange bird instead. While he insists they are missing out, the others remind him that it is more meaningful to have your own adventure than to follow someone else's. The bird ultimately leads them to Finch's treasure: her lost adventure journal, containing a list of legendary treasures she was unable to find. The group resolve to hunt the treasures down, unaware that F.O.W.L. is spying on them.\n|LineColor        = 960018\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 49\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = Quack Pack!\n |RTitle          =\n |DirectedBy      = Tanner Johnson\n |WrittenBy       = Bob Snow\n |Aux2            = Kristen Gish\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|4}}\n |ProdCode        = \n |Viewers         = \n |ShortSummary    = While on an adventure to find the Lost Lamp of Collie Baba, Donald wishes for a normal life; unaware he was next to the lamp.

While focusing on the perfect family photo, Huey suspects something's wrong after hearing Donald's voice ([[Don Cheadle]]) and manages to convince the others they're in a TV studio. Meanwhile, Donald tries his best to hide his secret by maintaining the plot and reluctantly hires his neighbor, [[Goofy]] ([[Bill Farmer]]), as the photographer. The family finds Gene and demand he send them back home, but he tells them only Donald can reverse the wish since he made it. Donald refuses and storms off with Goofy. When the others decide to escape, the wish fights back to maintain itself. Using his son [[Max Goof|Max]] as inspiration, Goofy helps Donald realize \"normal\" can mean different things for different families before helping him save his. Amidst the chaos, Goofy finds the lamp and Donald uses his second wish to undo his first.

The Sons of Pitch, GW's only male a cappella group, has been around since 2003, and the female group the GW Pitches was founded in 1996. All the groups are extremely committed to charity work, with the Troubadours holding an annual philanthropic concert in the fall entitled \"Acappellapalooza,\" and the Sons of Pitch holding one in the spring named \"The United States of A-Cappella.\" In the case of the former, groups from GWU are drawn for a concert, in the latter, groups from around the nation. The groups have raised tens of thousands of dollars for various charitable causes. Additionally, the university is home to the Voice gospel choir, a group that sings gospel music, the GW Vibes, a co-ed group focusing on soulful music. The GW Sirens, another all-girls group, and the GW Motherfunkers, a coed top 40 group, were created in 2003 and 2012, respectively.

The Sons of Pitch, GW's only male a cappella group, has been around since 2003, and the female group the GW Pitches was founded in 1996. All the groups are extremely committed to charity work, with the Troubadours holding an annual philanthropic concert in the fall entitled \"Acappellapalooza,\" and the Sons of Pitch holding one in the spring named \"The United States of A-Cappella.\" In the case of the former, groups from GWU are drawn for a concert, in the latter, groups from around the nation. The groups have raised tens of thousands of dollars for various charitable causes. Additionally, the university is home to the Voice gospel choir, a group that sings gospel music, the GW Vibes, a co-ed group focusing on soulful music. The GW Sirens, another all-girls group, and the GW Motherfunkers, a coed top 40 group, were created in 2003 and 2012, respectively.
