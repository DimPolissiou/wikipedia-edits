Cabin class, for wealthier passengers included small cabins and a shared dining room while \"steerage\" provided open decks with bunks often near the tackle to operate the Steer rudder in converted cargo space on the \"between decks\" area where passengers from poorer backgrounds cooked their own meals.\n\nWith the arrival of [[steamships]], competition between [[ocean liner]] companies led some companies like the [[Inman Line]] to offer additional options to economy passengers seeking to immigrate including small shared cabins and regular meals which were termed \"Third Class\".

Most European railways call it second class, except in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], where it is referred to as standard class (abbreviated \"STD\" on tickets) instead. It has been re-branded in some cases to broaden expectations. In Canada [[Via Rail]] refers to coach as Economy class. In [[India]], the lowest class of service was branded third class under the British colonial rule. It was re-branded as second class following independence to avoid its former segregationist connotations. Today [[Indian Railways]] offers Economy AC-3 also in the same class. In [[Indonesia]], the cheapest class for train is an economy class train and it is the highest percentage of train users in Indonesia for intercity and long distance travel. The economy class coach in Indonesia originally did not have air conditioning, but as the services of [[PT Kereta Api]] is developing, PT Kereta Api has launched an economy class coach with air conditioning, branded as \"Ekonomi AC\" (English: '''Economy with AC'''). Similar branding are also used by long distance bus companies through the country.\n\nGenerally economy class seats consists of a seat, sometimes with a fold-down tray, that may recline. The seat may also include a pocket attached to the back of the seat in front for storage of small items such as magazines. Depending on the configuration of the passenger compartment, luggage can be stowed in overhead racks or at each end of the [[Passenger car (rail)|coach cars]].\n\nStandard class seating on British intercity trains often includes seating around permanent tables. Power sockets are available and some services offer (chargeable) Wi-Fi Internet access.\n\nIn continental Europe, second class mostly consists of open interior coaches with 2+2 seating arrangement, with or without air-conditioning, in rows or face to face, or (in some express trains) compartments of six to eight seats. Some commuter trains have a higher seating density, with 3+2 seating arrangement.\n\nIn [[Spain]] 2nd-class cabins are called Tourist class on the [[AVE]] superfast trains. They offer electric sockets and there are video and audio services on most major routes.\n\nNorth American intercity passenger trains are separated into different coach classes by the type of car (e.g., sleepers).  Economy seating on North American passenger trains typically does not include meal service in the fare.\n\nEconomy class also exists on some [[sleeping car|sleeper services]], most notably on most [[Russian Railways]] routes, which designates the class as \"[[Couchette car|Platzkart]]\", with cars featuring an open 9-bay layout, where each bay has six [[bunk bed]]s in two tiers \u2013 four transversally, and two longitudinally on the opposing side of the aisle, with the lower bunks functioning as seats in daytime. Several European railways also provide similar \"coach class\" sleeper cars, commonly dubbed [[Couchette car]]s. There is a debate, though, whether Platzkart class is a full tier down from the traditional second class/\"coupe\", or is just a cheaper variant, as there used to exist an even cheaper \"hard bed\" class with three-tier bunks and no bedding, which is long since discontinued in Russia, but is still employed in [[Rail transport in China|China]].\n\n==Airlines==\n[[File:EmiratesEconomyClassA380.jpg|thumb|Economy Class on an [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] [[Airbus A380]]]]\n[[File:Economy Seat.JPG|thumb|An economy seat on an aircraft.]]\n[[File:LufthansaItalia A319 D-AKNH MXP 2010-04-06.jpg|thumb|Economy class on a [[Lufthansa Italia]] [[Airbus A319]]]]\n\nEconomy class seats usually recline and have a fold-down table.

In addition, many carriers, particularly within the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], also make economy passengers pay for airport check-in, checked bags, pillows, blankets, and headphones.\n\nMany airlines have created a slightly enhanced Economy class with, for example, a slightly larger pitch between seats such as Economy Plus from [[United Airlines]]. Arguably, such enhanced Economy classes only restore some of the comfort and amenities that were lost over the past few decades.\n\nPerhaps the first cheaper-than-standard airline flights were United's Boeing 247s between San Francisco and Los Angeles (Burbank) in 1940. Their nonstop DC-3s carried full-fare passengers ($18.95 one way) and Boeings flew a couple of two-stop flights each way for $13.90. That ended in 1942, and low fares did not reappear on scheduled airlines until 1948 when Pan Am started one DC-4 flight a day from New York La Guardia to San Juan with a $75 fare instead of the normal $133. In 1949, a tourist seat on a Pan Am DC-4 from New York to Rio cost $382 instead of $460 on the standard DC-4 making the same stops.\n\nIn late 1948, [[Capital Airlines (United States)|Capital Airlines]] started one DC-4 flight each way a day between Chicago and New York La Guardia. Each flight left at 1 AM and stopped for ten minutes at Pittsburgh (Allegheny County). Chicago-NY fare was $29.60 plus 15% federal tax; seats on all other flights cost $44.10 plus tax. Coach flights slowly spread (all domestic flights were one-class, coach or standard, until TWA started two-class 1049Gs in 1955); in 1961, domestic coach passenger-miles for the year exceeded first-class for the first time.\n[[File:PIA Breakfast.jpg|thumb|Breakfast in Economy Class of a [[Pakistan International Airlines]] [[Boeing 777]].]]\nIATA allowed transatlantic tourist fares in summer 1952: New York to London cost $270 one way instead of $395. In the next few years, tourist fares spread around the world.\n\n==Premium economy class==\n{{main|Premium economy}}\nSeveral airlines offer a Premium Economy class to passengers willing to pay slightly more for better seats and, in some cases, better service. Premium Economy class is positioned as a middleground between Standard Economy class and [[business class]] in terms of price, comfort, and amenities.

The definition for Premium Economy class is not standardized and varies widely from airline to airline, from a slightly larger seat pitch with no other amenities, such as Economy Plus on [https://www.i-customerservicenumber.com/airlines/united-airlines-customer-service/ United Airlines], to a true separate Premium Economy class with larger and more comfortable seats, better dining options, and better service.\n\n==Basic economy==\n{{main|Basic economy}}\nBasic economy, a.k.a. fifth class (if [[premium economy]] is counted as third class and standard economy is counted as fourth class) or last class, is the class below regular economy.<ref name=\"veconomist\" >{{cite news|author=G.M.|title=Carriers in America are doubling down on budget airfares|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2017/10/lasting-class|work=[[The Economist]]|date=13 October 2017|access-date=17 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017005507/https://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2017/10/lasting-class|archive-date=17 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Basic economy was first provided by [[Delta Air Lines]] for America's domestic market in 2012, closely followed by [[American Airlines]] (AA) and [[United Airlines]] for some domestic routes.<ref name=\"veconomist\" /> Both Delta Airlines and AA also plan to provide basic economy for international routes, which could see other airlines follow suit, leading to its global adoption.<ref name=\"veconomist\" /> The class has been criticised as \"a clever way to raise the price of standard economy fares\" and for its poorly designed pricing algorithms.<ref name=\"veconomist\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Economy class}}\n* [[Aircraft cabin]]\n* [[Airline seat]]\n* [[Business class]]\n* [[Deep vein thrombosis|Economy class syndrome]]\n* [[Fare basis code]]\n* [[First class (aviation)]]\n* [[First class travel]]\n* [[Wide-body aircraft]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Commercial aviation}}\n\n[[Category:Airline tickets]]\n[[Category:Passenger rail transport]]\n[[Category:Travel classes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{Redirect|Fourth class|the class of mail used by the US Postal Service|Mail sack#Fourth-class mail|the degree classification formerly awarded by the University of Oxford|British undergraduate degree classification#Third-class honours}}\n{{More citations needed|date=December 2008}}\n'''Economy class''', also called '''third class''', '''coach class''', '''[[steerage]]''', or to distinguish it from the slightly more expensive [[premium economy]] class, '''standard economy class''' or '''budget economy class''', is the lowest [[travel class]] of seating in [[air travel]], [[rail transport|rail]] travel, and sometimes [[ferry]] or maritime travel.

Many large liners evolved three and sometimes four segregated cabin, dining and recreation spaces for First, Second, Third and Steerage Class passengers.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/2505517|title=The golden age: service management on transatlantic ocean liners|first1=Patrick J.|last1=Murphy|first2=Ray W.|last2=Coye|journal=Journal of Management History|volume=13|issue=2|pages=172\u2013191|via=www.academia.edu|access-date=2 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111081228/http://www.academia.edu/2505517/The_Golden_Age_Service_Management_on_Transatlantic_Ocean_Liners|archive-date=11 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> After immigrant travel dropped beginning in the 1920s, steerage class was abandoned and Third Class cabins were often upgraded, redecorated and offered to budget travelers as \"Tourist Class\".<ref>John Maxtone Graham, ''The Only way to Cross'', New York MacMillan (1972), p. 169.</ref> This became the main low budget class for ocean travelers, gradually replacing Third Class especially during the boom in immigration after World War Two.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pier21.ca/blog/dan-conlin/recreating-an-ocean-liner-cabin|title=Recreating an Ocean Liner Cabin|publisher=Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier21|website=Pier 21|first=Dan|last=Conlin|access-date=7 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725184301/https://www.pier21.ca/blog/dan-conlin/recreating-an-ocean-liner-cabin|archive-date=25 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pelni Economy Class.jpg|thumb|right|Economy class on the ferry KM ''Awu'' ([[Pelni]]) in Indonesia]]\n\nAs ocean liners adjusted to the loss of passengers to air travel and switched to recreational cruising in the 1960s, most ships became \"one class\" to save on separate recreational and dining levels.<ref>William H.

Most European railways call it second class, except in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], where it is referred to as standard class (abbreviated \"STD\" on tickets) instead. It has been re-branded in some cases to broaden expectations. In Canada [[Via Rail]] refers to coach as Economy class. In [[India]], the lowest class of service was branded third class under the British colonial rule. It was re-branded as second class following independence to avoid its former segregationist connotations. Today [[Indian Railways]] offers Economy AC-3 also in the same class. In [[Indonesia]], the cheapest class for train is an economy class train and it is the highest percentage of train users in Indonesia for intercity and long distance travel. The economy class coach in Indonesia originally did not have air conditioning, but as the services of [[PT Kereta Api]] is developing, PT Kereta Api has launched an economy class coach with air conditioning, branded as \"Ekonomi AC\" (English: '''Economy with AC'''). Similar branding are also used by long distance bus companies through the country.\n\nGenerally economy class seats consists of a seat, sometimes with a fold-down tray, that may recline. The seat may also include a pocket attached to the back of the seat in front for storage of small items such as magazines. Depending on the configuration of the passenger compartment, luggage can be stowed in overhead racks or at each end of the [[Passenger car (rail)|coach cars]].\n\nStandard class seating on British intercity trains often includes seating around permanent tables. Power sockets are available and some services offer (chargeable) Wi-Fi Internet access.\n\nIn continental Europe, second class mostly consists of open interior coaches with 2+2 seating arrangement, with or without air-conditioning, in rows or face to face, or (in some express trains) compartments of six to eight seats. Some commuter trains have a higher seating density, with 3+2 seating arrangement.\n\nIn [[Spain]] 2nd-class cabins are called Tourist class on the [[AVE]] superfast trains. They offer electric sockets and there are video and audio services on most major routes.\n\nNorth American intercity passenger trains are separated into different coach classes by the type of car (e.g., sleepers).  Economy seating on North American passenger trains typically does not include meal service in the fare.\n\nEconomy class also exists on some [[sleeping car|sleeper services]], most notably on most [[Russian Railways]] routes, which designates the class as \"[[Couchette car|Platzkart]]\", with cars featuring an open 9-bay layout, where each bay has six [[bunk bed]]s in two tiers \u2013 four transversally, and two longitudinally on the opposing side of the aisle, with the lower bunks functioning as seats in daytime. Several European railways also provide similar \"coach class\" sleeper cars, commonly dubbed [[Couchette car]]s. There is a debate, though, whether Platzkart class is a full tier down from the traditional second class/\"coupe\", or is just a cheaper variant, as there used to exist an even cheaper \"hard bed\" class with three-tier bunks and no bedding, which is long since discontinued in Russia, but is still employed in [[Rail transport in China|China]].\n\n==Airlines==\n[[File:EmiratesEconomyClassA380.jpg|thumb|Economy Class on an [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] [[Airbus A380]]]]\n[[File:Economy Seat.JPG|thumb|An economy seat on an aircraft.]]\n[[File:LufthansaItalia A319 D-AKNH MXP 2010-04-06.jpg|thumb|Economy class on a [[Lufthansa Italia]] [[Airbus A319]]]]\n\nEconomy class seats usually recline and have a fold-down table.

In addition, many carriers, particularly within the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], also make economy passengers pay for airport check-in, checked bags, pillows, blankets, and headphones.\n\nMany airlines have created a slightly enhanced Economy class with, for example, a slightly larger pitch between seats such as Economy Plus from [[United Airlines]]. Arguably, such enhanced Economy classes only restore some of the comfort and amenities that were lost over the past few decades.\n\nPerhaps the first cheaper-than-standard airline flights were United's Boeing 247s between San Francisco and Los Angeles (Burbank) in 1940. Their nonstop DC-3s carried full-fare passengers ($18.95 one way) and Boeings flew a couple of two-stop flights each way for $13.90. That ended in 1942, and low fares did not reappear on scheduled airlines until 1948 when Pan Am started one DC-4 flight a day from New York La Guardia to San Juan with a $75 fare instead of the normal $133. In 1949, a tourist seat on a Pan Am DC-4 from New York to Rio cost $382 instead of $460 on the standard DC-4 making the same stops.\n\nIn late 1948, [[Capital Airlines (United States)|Capital Airlines]] started one DC-4 flight each way a day between Chicago and New York La Guardia. Each flight left at 1 AM and stopped for ten minutes at Pittsburgh (Allegheny County). Chicago-NY fare was $29.60 plus 15% federal tax; seats on all other flights cost $44.10 plus tax. Coach flights slowly spread (all domestic flights were one-class, coach or standard, until TWA started two-class 1049Gs in 1955); in 1961, domestic coach passenger-miles for the year exceeded first-class for the first time.\n[[File:PIA Breakfast.jpg|thumb|Breakfast in Economy Class of a [[Pakistan International Airlines]] [[Boeing 777]].]]\nIATA allowed transatlantic tourist fares in summer 1952 \u2013; New York to London cost $270 one way instead of $395. In the next few years, tourist fares spread around the world.\n\n==Premium economy class==\n{{main|Premium economy}}\nSeveral airlines offer a Premium Economy class to passengers willing to pay slightly more for better seats and, in some cases, better service. Premium Economy class is positioned as a middleground between Standard Economy class and [[business class]] in terms of price, comfort, and amenities.

The definition for Premium Economy class is not standardized and varies widely from airline to airline, from a slightly larger seat pitch with no other amenities, such as Economy Plus on [https://www.i-customerservicenumber.com/airlines/united-airlines-customer-service/ United Airlines], to a true separate Premium Economy class with larger and more comfortable seats, better dining options, and better service.\n\n==Basic economy==\n{{main|Basic economy}}\nBasic economy, a.k.a. fifth class (if [[premium economy]] is counted as third class and standard economy is counted as fourth class) or last class, is the class below regular economy.<ref name=\"veconomist\" >{{cite news|author=G.M.|title=Carriers in America are doubling down on budget airfares|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2017/10/lasting-class|work=[[The Economist]]|date=13 October 2017|access-date=17 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017005507/https://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2017/10/lasting-class|archive-date=17 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Basic economy was first provided by [[Delta Air Lines]] for America's domestic market in 2012, closely followed by [[American Airlines]] (AA) and [[United Airlines]] for some domestic routes.<ref name=\"veconomist\" /> Both Delta Airlines and AA also plan to provide basic economy for international routes, which could see other airlines follow suit, leading to its global adoption.<ref name=\"veconomist\" /> The class has been criticised as \"a clever way to raise the price of standard economy fares\" and for its poorly designed pricing algorithms.<ref name=\"veconomist\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Economy class}}\n* [[Aircraft cabin]]\n* [[Airline seat]]\n* [[Business class]]\n* [[Deep vein thrombosis|Economy class syndrome]]\n* [[Fare basis code]]\n* [[First class (aviation)]]\n* [[First class travel]]\n* [[Wide-body aircraft]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Commercial aviation}}\n\n[[Category:Airline tickets]]\n[[Category:Passenger rail transport]]\n[[Category:Travel classes]]\n", "name_user": "Martindo", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAirlines:punctuation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_class"}

Robinson's full description: \"Five minutes below the top of the pass on the other side is the mouth of a lateral valley on the left, coming down nearly from the south. We entered and followed this up to its head in a pretty and well cultivated basin among the hills. On the steep declivity and ridge above it in the south-west, is situated the large village Um el-Fahm; to which we came at 12 o\u2019clock. The ridge is narrow; and south of it a deep valley runs out to the western plain. The side valley which we had ascended, is likewise separated from the valley we left only by a ridge; on the southern end of this latter is the village. It thus overlooks the whole country towards the west; with a fine prospect of the plain and sea, and also of Carmel; with glimpses of the Plain of [[Esdraelon]], and a view of [[Mount Tabor|Tabor]] and Little Hermon beyond. There was, however, a haze in the atmosphere, which prevented us from distinguishing the villages in the plain.\nThere were said to be in Um el-Fahm twenty or thirty families of Christians; some said more. Outside of the village, near the western brow, was a cemetery. Here too was a threshing-sledge; in form like the stone-sledge of New England; made of three planks, each a foot wide; with holes thickly bored in the bottom, into which were driven projecting bits of black volcanic stone. The village belongs to the government of Jenin. They had hitherto paid their taxes at so much a head; but the governor had recently taken an account of their land, horses, and stock; with the purpose, as was supposed, of exacting the tithe. Twenty-five men had been taken as soldiers under the conscription.\" Cited in Zertal, 2016, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XytzCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA116 116]-[https://books.google.com/books?id=XytzCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA117 117]\n</ref>\n\nIn 1870, [[Victor Gu\u00e9rin]] found it had 1800 inhabitants and was surrounded by beautiful gardens.<ref>Gu\u00e9rin,  1875, p.

He further noted: \"There are some fifteen houses of Christians, which represent a total of about eighty souls. These are mostly birds of passage, who \u2018squat\u2019 wherever and as long as, they find it convenient, and then flit \u2018to fresh fields and pastures new\u2019. The natives are an unruly lot, who never paid taxes till within the last few years, and who have not yet learnt the lesson of subjection. Some days ago a man tried to seize my horse\u2019s bridle as I was passing near a threshing-floor, and insolently told me to be off, at the same time making as though he would strike me; but, seeing then that he had gone rather too far, took to his heels and fled. After a suspense of three or four days, I consented, at the intercession of two of the sheikhs, the kadi, and other village worthies, not to have the man imprisoned at Jen\u2019in [sic], so he was brought and solemnly beaten before my tent door by the sheikh of his quarter. As civility in this country is induced by fear and a sense of inferiority, we shall probably be treated with decent respect for some little time to come. One cause of the villagers\u2019 unruliness is their wealth: they possess large herds of cattle and flocks of goats, a very considerable number of horses, and more than the normal quantity of camels and donkeys. Their land comprises a wide tract of thicket (called Umm el Khattaf, \u2018Mother of the Ravisher,\u2019 from the dense growth which, as it were, seizes and holds those who try to pass through it) to the south and east, arable hills to the west, and virtually as much of the rich plain of [[Esdraelon]] (Merj ibn \u2018Amir) as they choose to cultivate. Besides all this, the village owns some twenty or more springs, under whose immediate influence orange and lemon trees flourish. [[Pomelo|Shaddock]]s [citrus fruit] grow to an enormous size; I have one now in the tent whose circumference lengthwise is 2ft. 61\u20442 in, and its girth 2ft. 31\u20442 in; weight, about eight or nine pounds; and tomatoes, cucumbers, and other thirsty vegetables flourish. The taxes paid by the village amount to 23,000 piasters, or \u00a3185 sterling, in addition to the [[poll-tax]] on sheep, goats, and cattle, which probably comes to \u00a320 or more.\u201d Cited in Zertal, 2016, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XytzCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA118 118]-[https://books.google.com/books?id=XytzCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA119 119]</ref>\n\nIn 1883,  the [[Palestine Exploration Fund|PEF]]'s [[PEF Survey of Palestine|Survey of Western Palestine]] described Umm al-Fahm as having around 500 inhabitants, of which some 80 people were Christians.

We entered and followed this up to its head in a pretty and well cultivated basin among the hills. On the steep declivity and ridge above it in the south-west, is situated the large village Um el-Fahm; to which we came at 12 o\u2019clock. The ridge is narrow; and south of it a deep valley runs out to the western plain. The side valley which we had ascended, is likewise separated from the valley we left only by a ridge; on the southern end of this latter is the village. It thus overlooks the whole country towards the west; with a fine prospect of the plain and sea, and also of Carmel; with glimpses of the Plain of [[Esdraelon]], and a view of [[Mount Tabor|Tabor]] and Little Hermon beyond. There was, however, a haze in the atmosphere, which prevented us from distinguishing the villages in the plain.\nThere were said to be in Um el-Fahm twenty or thirty families of Christians; some said more. Outside of the village, near the western brow, was a cemetery. Here too was a threshing-sledge; in form like the stone-sledge of New England; made of three planks, each a foot wide; with holes thickly bored in the bottom, into which were driven projecting bits of black volcanic stone. The village belongs to the government of Jenin. They had hitherto paid their taxes at so much a head; but the governor had recently taken an account of their land, horses, and stock; with the purpose, as was supposed, of exacting the tithe. Twenty-five men had been taken as soldiers under the conscription.\" Cited in Zertal, 2016, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XytzCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA116 116]-[https://books.google.com/books?id=XytzCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA117 117]\n</ref>\n\nIn 1870, [[Victor Gu\u00e9rin]] found it had 1800 inhabitants and was surrounded by beautiful gardens.<ref>Gu\u00e9rin,  1875, p. [https://archive.org/stream/descriptiongogr04gugoog#page/n264/mode/1up 239]</ref>\n\nIn 1872, [[Charles Tyrwhitt-Drake]] noted that Umm al-Fahm was  \"divided into four quarters, El Jebarin, El Mahamin, El Maj\u2019ahineh, and El Akbar\u2019iyeh, each of which has its own sheikh.\"<ref>Tyrwhitt-Drake, 1873, pp.[https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme05pale#page/n37/mode/1up 28]\u201329. He further noted: \"There are some fifteen houses of Christians, which represent a total of about eighty souls. These are mostly birds of passage, who \u2018squat\u2019 wherever and as long as, they find it convenient, and then flit \u2018to fresh fields and pastures new\u2019. The natives are an unruly lot, who never paid taxes till within the last few years, and who have not yet learnt the lesson of subjection. Some days ago a man tried to seize my horse\u2019s bridle as I was passing near a threshing-floor, and insolently told me to be off, at the same time making as though he would strike me; but, seeing then that he had gone rather too far, took to his heels and fled. After a suspense of three or four days, I consented, at the intercession of two of the sheikhs, the kadi, and other village worthies, not to have the man imprisoned at Jen\u2019in [sic], so he was brought and solemnly beaten before my tent door by the sheikh of his quarter. As civility in this country is induced by fear and a sense of inferiority, we shall probably be treated with decent respect for some little time to come. One cause of the villagers\u2019 unruliness is their wealth: they possess large herds of cattle and flocks of goats, a very considerable number of horses, and more than the normal quantity of camels and donkeys. Their land comprises a wide tract of thicket (called Umm el Khattaf, \u2018Mother of the Ravisher,\u2019 from the dense growth which, as it were, seizes and holds those who try to pass through it) to the south and east, arable hills to the west, and virtually as much of the rich plain of [[Esdraelon]] (Merj ibn \u2018Amir) as they choose to cultivate. Besides all this, the village owns some twenty or more springs, under whose immediate influence orange and lemon trees flourish. [[Pomelo|Shaddock]]s [citrus fruit] grow to an enormous size; I have one now in the tent whose circumference lengthwise is 2ft. 61\u20442 in, and its girth 2ft. 31\u20442 in; weight, about eight or nine pounds; and tomatoes, cucumbers, and other thirsty vegetables flourish. The taxes paid by the village amount to 23,000 piasters, or \u00a3185 sterling, in addition to the [[poll-tax]] on sheep, goats, and cattle, which probably comes to \u00a320 or more.\u201d Cited in Zertal, 2016, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XytzCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA118 118]-[https://books.google.com/books?id=XytzCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA119 119]</ref>\n\nIn 1883,  the [[Palestine Exploration Fund|PEF]]'s [[PEF Survey of Palestine|Survey of Western Palestine]] described Umm al-Fahm as having around 500 inhabitants, of which some 80 people were Christians. The place was well-built of stone, and the villagers were described as being very rich in cattle, goats and horses. It was the most important place in the area besides [[Jenin]]. The village was divided into four quarters, ''el Jebarin'', ''el Mahamin'', ''el Mejahineh'', and ''el Akbariyeh'', each quarter having its own [[sheikh]].

It lasted from 241 to late 238 or early 237 BC and ended with Carthage suppressing both the mutiny and the revolt.\n\nThe war began as a dispute over the payment of wages owed to 20,000 foreign soldiers who had fought for Carthage on [[Sicily]] during the First Punic War. When a compromise seemed to have been reached the army erupted into full-scale mutiny under the leadership of [[Spendius]] and [[Mathos|Matho]]. 70,000 Africans from Carthage's oppressed dependant territories flocked to join them, bringing supplies and finance. War-weary Carthage fared poorly in the initial engagements of the war, especially under the generalship of [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno]]. [[Hamilcar Barca]], a veteran of the campaigns in [[Sicily]] (and father of [[Hannibal Barca]]), was given joint and then supreme command. He campaigned successfully, initially demonstrating lenience in an attempt to woo the rebels over. To prevent this Spendius tortured 700 Carthaginian prisoners to death, and henceforth the war was pursued with great brutality.\n\nBy early 237 BC, after numerous setbacks, the rebels were defeated and their cities brought back under Carthaginian rule. An expedition was prepared to reoccupy [[Sardinia]], where mutinous soldiers had slaughtered all Carthaginians. However, Rome declared that this would be an act of war and occupied both Sardinia and [[Corsica]], in contravention of the recent peace treaty. This has been considered to be the single greatest cause of war with Carthage breaking out again in 218 BC in the [[Second Punic War]].\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Stele des Polybios.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting a man in classical Greek clothing raising one arm|{{center|[[Polybius]]{{snd}}\"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Champion|2015|p=102}}}}]]\n\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[Punic War]]s{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Jones|Sidwell|2003|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa}}118 BC), a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after this war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the Mercenary War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} He was on the staff of [[Scipio Aemilianus]] when he led a Roman army during the [[Third Punic War]] on a campaign through many of the locations of the actions of the Mercenary War.{{sfn|Champion|2015|pp=108\u2013109}} Only part of the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with this war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the war in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Craige Champion describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Champion|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} Modern historians also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other that Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}} Other sources include inscriptions, coins and archaeological evidence.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}}\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe First Punic War was fought between [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] and [[Roman Republic|Rome]], the two main powers of the western [[Mediterranean]] in the early 3rd century BC, and lasted for 23 years, from 264 to 241 BC. Rome still exists as the capital of Italy, while Carthage was razed by Rome in a [[Third Punic War|later war]]; its ruins lie {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}} east of modern [[Tunis]] on the North African coast. The two powers struggled for supremacy primarily on the Mediterranean island of [[Sicily]] and its surrounding waters, and also in [[North Africa]].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=82}} It was the longest continuous conflict and greatest naval war of antiquity. After immense material and human losses on both sides, the Carthaginians were defeated.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} The Carthaginian Senate ordered the commander of its forces on Sicily, [[Hamilcar Barca]], to negotiate a peace treaty; he delegated this to his deputy [[Gisco (died 239 BC)|Gisco]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=206}} The [[Treaty of Lutatius]] was signed and brought the First Punic War to its end. By the treaty's terms Carthage evacuated Sicily, handed over all prisoners taken during the war, and paid an [[indemnity]] of 3,200 talents{{#tag:ref|3,200 talents was approximately {{convert|81|lt|kg|disp=flip}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}}{{snd}}1,000 talents of this was due immediately, the balance over ten years.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}}\n\nWhile the war with Rome was being played out, the Carthaginian general [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno]] was leading a series of campaigns which greatly increased the area of Africa controlled by Carthage. He extended its control to [[Theveste]] (modern [[T\u00e9bessa]], [[Algeria]]) {{convert|300|km}} south-west of their capital.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=99}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=205}} Hanno was rigorous in squeezing taxes out of the newly conquered territory in order to pay for both the war with Rome and his own campaigns.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=205}} Half of all agricultural output was taken as war tax, and the tribute previously due from towns and cities was doubled. These exactions were harshly enforced, causing extreme hardship in many areas.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=114}}{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=6}}\n\n[[File:Troupes carthaginoises Arverniales 2012.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|alt=A group of men dressed in clothes and carrying weapons from the 3rd century BC accompanying a medium-sized elephant|{{center|Modern recreations of Carthaginian soldiers and a [[war elephant]] at the 2012 [[Gergovie plateau#Events#Les Arverniales|Arverniales]] [[Historical reenactment|reenactment]]}}]]\n\nCarthaginian armies were nearly always composed of foreigners; citizens only served in the army if there was a direct threat to the city of Carthage. The majority of these foreigners were from North Africa.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}} [[Libyans]] provided close-order infantry equipped with large shields, helmets, short swords and long thrusting [[spear]]s; as well as close-order shock cavalry carrying spears{{snd}}both were noted for their discipline and staying power. [[Numidians]] and [[Berbers]] provided light cavalry who threw javelins from a distance and avoided close combat, and javelin-armed [[light infantry]] [[skirmisher]]s.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Koon|2015|p=80}} Both Spain and [[Gaul]] provided experienced infantry; unarmoured troops who would charge ferociously, but had a reputation for breaking off if a combat was protracted.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=9}}{{#tag:ref|The Spanish used a heavy throwing spear which the Romans were later to adopt as the ''[[pilum]]''.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}|group=note}} The close order Libyan infantry, and citizen militia when present, would fight in a tightly-packed formation known as a [[phalanx]].{{sfn|Koon|2015|p=80}} Two thousand [[Sling (weapon)|slingers]] were recruited from the Balearic Islands.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=8}} Sicilians and Italians had also joined up during the war to fill the ranks.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=207}} The Carthaginians frequently employed [[war elephant]]s; North Africa had indigenous [[African forest elephant]]s at the time.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=9}} Roman sources refer to these foreign fighters derogatively as \"mercenaries\", but Goldsworthy describes to this as \"a gross oversimplification\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=33}} They served under a variety of arrangements; for example, some were the regular troops of allied cities or kingdoms seconded to Carthage as part of formal arrangements.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=33}} \n\n=====Mutiny=====\n\nAfter receiving orders to make peace on whatever terms he could negotiate, Hamilcar left Sicily in a rage, convinced that the surrender was unnecessary. The evacuation of the Carthaginian army of 20,000 men from Sicily was left in the hands of Gesco. Not wishing the freshly idle soldiers to combine for purposes of their own, Gisco split the army into small detachments based on their regions of origin. He sent these back to Carthage one at a time. He anticipated they would be promptly paid the several years back pay they were owed and hurried on their way home.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=133}} The Carthaginian authorities decided to instead wait until all of the troops had arrived and then attempt to negotiate a settlement at a lower rate. Meanwhile, as each group arrived it was billeted inside the city of Carthage where the advantages of civilisation were appreciated to the full after up to eight years under siege. So much so, that before the full 20,000 had arrived they were relocated to Sicca Veneria (modern [[El Kef]]) {{convert|180|km}} away, even though a significant portion of their arrears had to be paid before they would go.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=112}} \n\nFreed of their long period of military discipline and with nothing to do, the men grumbled among themselves and refused all attempts by the Carthaginians to pay them less than the full amount due. Frustrated by the Carthaginian negotiators' attempts to haggle, all 20,000 troops marched to Tunis, {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}} from Carthage. Panicking, the Senate agreed to payment in full. The [[Mutiny|mutinous]] troops responded by demanding even more. Gisco, who had a good reputation with the army, was brought over from Sicily in late 241 BC and despatched to the camp with enough money to pay most of what was owed. He started to disburse this, with promises that the balance would be paid as soon as it could be raised. The discontent seemed to have abated when, for some unknown reason, discipline broke down. Several soldiers insisted that no deal with Carthage was acceptable, a riot broke out, dissenters were stoned to death, Gesco and his staff were taken prisoner and his treasury was seized. [[Spendius]], an escaped Roman slave who faced death by torture if he were recaptured, and [[Mathos|Matho]], a Berber dissatisfied with Hanno's attitude towards tax raising from Carthage's African possessions, were declared generals. The news of a formed, experienced, anti-Carthaginian army in the heart of its territory spread rapidly and many cities and towns rose in rebellion. Provisions, money and reinforcements poured in; an additional 70,000 men according to Polybius.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=112\u2013114}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=133\u2013134}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=371}} The pay dispute had become a full-scale revolt threatening Carthage's existence as a state.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=204}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}}\n\n==War==\n\n===Hanno===\n[[File:Utica240.PNG|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=A map showing the major movements of both sides during the Battle of Utica|{{center|The Battle of Utica}}]]\nHanno, as the commander of Carthage's African army, took the field.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=207}} Most of the Africans in his force remained loyal; they were accustomed to acting against their fellow Africans. His non-African contingent had remained quartered in Carthage when the army of Sicily was expelled, and also remained loyal. The few troops still in Sicily were paid up to date and redeployed with Hanno, and money was raised to hire fresh troops. An unknown number of Carthaginian citizens were incorporated into Hanno's army.{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|p=88}} By the time Hanno assembled this force, the rebels had already [[blockade]]d [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] and [[Hippo Diarrhytus|Hippo]] (modern [[Bizerte]]).{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=188}}\n\nIn early 240 BC Hanno set off with the army to relieve Utica;{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=373}} he took with him 100 elephants and a [[Siege engine|siege train]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=114\u2013115}}{{#tag:ref|The military historian Nigel Bagnall queries the utility of the siege train, as the rebels held no towns which could be besieged.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}}|group=note}} Hanno stormed the rebels' camp in the [[Battle of Utica]] and his elephants [[rout]]ed the besiegers. Hanno's army took over the camp and Hanno himself entered the city in triumph. However, the battle-hardened veterans of the Sicilian army regathered in the nearby hills and, not being pursued, returned towards Utica. The Carthaginians, accustomed to fighting the [[militia]]s of the Numidian cities, were still celebrating their victory when the rebels [[counterattack|counter-attacked]]. The Carthaginians fled, with great loss of life, losing their [[train (military)|baggage]] and siege trains. For the rest of the year Hanno skirmished with the rebel force, repeatedly missing opportunities to bring it to battle or to place it at a disadvantage; the military historian [[Nigel Bagnall]] writes of Hanno's \"incompetence as a field commander\".{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=6}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}}\n\nRome pointedly declined to take advantage of Carthage's troubles. Italians were prohibited from trading with the rebels but encouraged to trade with Carthage; 2,743 Carthaginian prisoners still held were released without a ransom being required and were immediately enrolled into Carthage's army.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}} [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero]], the king of the Roman satellite kingdom of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], was allowed to supply Carthage with the large amounts of food it needed and was no longer able to obtain from its own hinterland.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} In late 240 or early 239 BC the Carthaginian garrisons on [[Sardinia]] joined the mutiny, killing their officers and the island's governor. The Carthaginians sent a force to retake the island. When it arrived its members also mutinied, joined the previous mutineers, and killed all of the Carthaginians on the island. The mutineers then appealed to Rome for protection, which was refused.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=376}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=212}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}\n\n===Hamilcar===\n[[File:Macar240.PNG|thumb|left|upright=0.8|alt=A map showing the major movements of both sides during the Battle of the Bagradas River|{{center|The Battle of the Bagradas River}}]]\nAt some point during 240 BC the Carthaginians raised another, smaller, force, of approximately 10,000. It included deserters from the rebels, 2,000 cavalry, and 70 elephants. This was placed under the command of Hamilcar, who had commanded the Carthaginian forces on Sicily for the last six years of the First Punic War.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}} The rebels held the line of the [[Medjerda River|Bagradas River]] with 10,000 men commanded by Spendius. Hamilcar would need to force a crossing if he were to gain access to open country where he could manoeuvre. He did so by a [[Ruse de guerre|stratagem]], and Spendius was reinforced by an additional 15,000 men from the siege of Utica, which the rebels had renewed. The rebel force of 25,000 moved to attack Hamilcar in the [[Battle of the Bagradas River (c. 240 BC)|Battle of the Bagradas River]]. What happened next is unclear: it seems Hamilcar [[Feigned retreat|feigned a retreat]], the rebels broke ranks to pursue, the Carthaginians turned in good order and counter-attacked, routing the rebels, who suffered losses of 8,000 men.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=207}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=115\u2013117}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}}\n\nHamilcar was appointed joint commander of the Carthaginian army, alongside Hanno, but there was no cooperation between the two.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=209}} While Hanno manoeuvred against Matho to the north near Hippo, Hamilcar confronted various towns and cities which had gone over to the rebels, bringing them back to Carthaginian allegiance with varying mixtures of diplomacy and force. He was shadowed by a superior-sized rebel force, which kept to rough ground for fear of Hamilcar's cavalry and elephants, and harried his foragers and scouts.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=117}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=207\u2013208}} South west of Utica Hamilcar moved his force into the mountains in an attempt to bring the rebels to battle,{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=6}} but was surrounded. The Carthaginians were only saved from destruction when a Numidian leader, [[Navaras (Numidian)|Navaras]], who had served with and admired Hamilcar in Sicily, swapped sides with his 2,000 cavalry.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=150\u2013152}} This proved disastrous for the rebels, and in the [[Hamilcar's victory with Navaras|resulting battle]] they lost 10,000 killed and 4,000 captured.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=118}}\n\n===Truceless War===\n[[File:Guerra mercenaria (cropped).png|thumb|upright=|alt=A map showing the major movements of both sides during the war|{{center|Main manoeuvres during the war}}]]\nSince leaving Carthage, Hamilcar had treated rebels he had captured well and offered them a choice of joining his army or free passage home. He made the same offer to the 4,000 captives from the recent battle.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=118}} The rebel leaders perceived this generous treatment as the motivation behind Navaras's defection and feared the disintegration of their army; they were aware that such generous terms would not be extended to them personally. To remove the possibility of any goodwill between the sides, they had 700 Carthaginian prisoners, including Gesco, tortured to death: they had their hands cut off, were castrated, their legs broken and were thrown into a pit and buried alive.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} Hamilcar, in turn, killed his prisoners. From this point, neither side showed any mercy, and the unusual ferocity of the fighting caused Polybius to term it the \"Truceless War\".{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} Any further prisoners taken by the Carthaginians were trampled to death by elephants.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=210}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=135}}\n\nAt some point between March and September 239 BC{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}} the previously loyal cities of Utica and Hippo slew their Carthaginian garrisons and joined the rebels. The people of Utica offered their city to the Romans, who declined. The classicist [[Richard Miles (historian)|Richard Miles]] writes that \"Rome was in no shape to embark on yet another war\" and wished to avoid acquiring a reputation for supporting mutinous uprisings.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=209\u2013210}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=136}} The rebels previously operating in the area moved south and laid siege to Carthage.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}}\n\nHaving a clear superiority in cavalry, Hamilcar raided the supply lines of the rebels around Carthage.{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} In mid-239 BC he was joined by Hanno and his army, but the two men disagreed as to the best strategy and operations were paralysed. Unusually, the choice of supreme commander was put to a vote of the army{{snd}}possibly only the officers{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=208}}{{snd}}and Hamilcar was elected; Hanno left the army.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=119}} In early 238 BC the lack of supplies forced the rebels to lift the siege of Carthage. They fell back to Tunis, from where they maintained a more distant blockade.{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=376}} While Matho maintained the blockade, Spendius led 40,000 men against Hamilcar. As in the previous year, they stayed to the higher and rougher terrain and harassed the Carthaginian army. After a period of campaigning, the details of which are not clear in the sources, Hamilcar trapped the rebels in a pass or mountain range known as the Saw. Pinned against mountains and with their food exhausted, the rebels ate their horses, their prisoners and then their slaves, hoping that Matho would [[sortie]] from Tunis to rescue them. Eventually, the surrounded troops forced their leaders to parley with Hamilcar, but on a thin pretext he took Spendius and his lieutenants prisoner. The rebels then attempted to fight their way out in the [[Battle of \"The Saw\"|Battle of the Saw]] and were massacred to a man.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=121\u2013122}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=146\u2013150}}\n\nHamilcar then marched on Tunis and laid siege to it in late 238 BC. The city was difficult to access from both the east and the west, so Hamilcar occupied a position to the south with half the army, and his deputy [[Hannibal (Mercenary War)|Hannibal]]{{#tag:ref|Not to be confused with [[Hannibal Barca]], of Second Punic War fame.|group=note}} was to the north with the balance. The rebel leaders taken captive prior to the Saw were [[crucifixion|crucified]] in full view of the city. Matho ordered a large-scale night attack, which surprised the Carthaginians, who suffered many casualties. One of their camps was overrun and they lost much of their baggage. In addition, Hannibal and a delegation of 30 Carthaginian notables who were visiting the army were captured. They were tortured and then nailed to the crosses previously occupied by Spendius and his colleagues. Hamilcar abandoned the siege and withdrew to the north.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=122}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=220\u2013223}}\n\nThe Senate encouraged reconciliation between Hanno and Hamilcar, and they agreed to serve together.

It lasted from 241 to late 238 or early 237 BC and ended with Carthage suppressing both the mutiny and the revolt.\n\nThe war began as a dispute over the payment of wages owed to 20,000 foreign soldiers who had fought for Carthage on [[Sicily]] during the First Punic War. When a compromise seemed to have been reached the army erupted into full-scale mutiny under the leadership of [[Spendius]] and [[Mathos|Matho]]. 70,000 Africans from Carthage's oppressed dependant territories flocked to join them, bringing supplies and finance. War-weary Carthage fared poorly in the initial engagements of the war, especially under the generalship of [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno]]. [[Hamilcar Barca]], a veteran of the campaigns in [[Sicily]] (and father of [[Hannibal Barca]]), was given joint and then supreme command. He campaigned successfully, initially demonstrating lenience in an attempt to woo the rebels over. To prevent this Spendius tortured 700 Carthaginian prisoners to death, and henceforth the war was pursued with great brutality.\n\nBy early 237 BC, after numerous setbacks, the rebels were defeated and their cities brought back under Carthaginian rule. An expedition was prepared to reoccupy [[Sardinia]], where mutinous soldiers had slaughtered all Carthaginians. However, Rome declared that this would be an act of war and occupied both Sardinia and [[Corsica]], in contravention of the recent peace treaty. This has been considered to be the single greatest cause of war with Carthage breaking out again in 218 BC in the [[Second Punic War]].\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Stele des Polybios.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting a man in classical Greek clothing raising one arm|{{center|[[Polybius]]{{snd}}\"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Champion|2015|p=102}}}}]]\n\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[Punic War]]s{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Jones|Sidwell|2003|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa}}118 BC), a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after this war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the Mercenary War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} He was on the staff of [[Scipio Aemilianus]] when he led a Roman army during the [[Third Punic War]] on a campaign through many of the locations of the actions of the Mercenary War.{{sfn|Champion|2015|pp=108\u2013109}} Only part of the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with this war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the war in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Craige Champion describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Champion|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} Modern historians also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other that Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}} Other sources include inscriptions, coins and archaeological evidence.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}}\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe First Punic War was fought between [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] and [[Roman Republic|Rome]], the two main powers of the western [[Mediterranean]] in the early 3rd century BC, and lasted for 23 years, from 264 to 241 BC.

The two powers struggled for supremacy primarily on the Mediterranean island of [[Sicily]] and its surrounding waters, and also in [[North Africa]].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=82}} It was the longest continuous conflict and greatest naval war of antiquity. After immense material and human losses on both sides, the Carthaginians were defeated.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} The Carthaginian Senate ordered the commander of its forces on Sicily, [[Hamilcar Barca]], to negotiate a peace treaty; he delegated this to his deputy [[Gisco (died 239 BC)|Gisco]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=206}} The [[Treaty of Lutatius]] was signed and brought the First Punic War to its end.

The evacuation of the Carthaginian army of 20,000 men from Sicily was left in the hands of Gesco. Not wishing the freshly idle soldiers to combine for purposes of their own, Gisco split the army into small detachments based on their regions of origin. He sent these back to Carthage one at a time. He anticipated they would be promptly paid the several years back pay they were owed and hurried on their way home.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=133}} The Carthaginian authorities decided to instead wait until all of the troops had arrived and then attempt to negotiate a settlement at a lower rate. Meanwhile, as each group arrived it was billeted inside the city of Carthage where the advantages of civilisation were appreciated to the full after up to eight years under siege. So much so, that before the full 20,000 had arrived they were relocated to Sicca Veneria (modern [[El Kef]]) {{convert|180|km}} away, even though a significant portion of their arrears had to be paid before they would go.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=112}} \n\nFreed of their long period of military discipline and with nothing to do, the men grumbled among themselves and refused all attempts by the Carthaginians to pay them less than the full amount due. Frustrated by the Carthaginian negotiators' attempts to haggle, all 20,000 troops marched to Tunis, {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}} from Carthage. Panicking, the Senate agreed to payment in full. The [[Mutiny|mutinous]] troops responded by demanding even more. Gisco, who had a good reputation with the army, was brought over from Sicily in late 241 BC and despatched to the camp with enough money to pay most of what was owed. He started to disburse this, with promises that the balance would be paid as soon as it could be raised. The discontent seemed to have abated when, for some unknown reason, discipline broke down. Several soldiers insisted that no deal with Carthage was acceptable, a riot broke out, dissenters were stoned to death, Gesco and his staff were taken prisoner and his treasury was seized. [[Spendius]], an escaped Roman slave who faced death by torture if he were recaptured, and [[Mathos|Matho]], a Berber dissatisfied with Hanno's attitude towards tax raising from Carthage's African possessions, were declared generals. The news of a formed, experienced, anti-Carthaginian army in the heart of its territory spread rapidly and many cities and towns rose in rebellion. Provisions, money and reinforcements poured in; an additional 70,000 men according to Polybius.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=112\u2013114}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=133\u2013134}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=371}} The pay dispute had become a full-scale revolt threatening Carthage's existence as a state.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=204}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}}\n\n==War==\n\n===Hanno===\n[[File:Utica240.PNG|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=A map showing the major movements of both sides during the Battle of Utica|{{center|The Battle of Utica}}]]\nHanno, as the commander of Carthage's African army, took the field.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=207}} Most of the Africans in his force remained loyal; they were accustomed to acting against their fellow Africans. His non-African contingent had remained quartered in Carthage when the army of Sicily was expelled, and also remained loyal. The few troops still in Sicily were paid up to date and redeployed with Hanno, and money was raised to hire fresh troops. An unknown number of Carthaginian citizens were incorporated into Hanno's army.{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|p=88}} By the time Hanno assembled this force, the rebels had already [[blockade]]d [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] and [[Hippo Diarrhytus|Hippo]] (modern [[Bizerte]]).{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=188}}\n\nIn early 240 BC Hanno set off with the army to relieve Utica;{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=373}} he took with him 100 elephants and a [[Siege engine|siege train]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=114\u2013115}}{{#tag:ref|The military historian Nigel Bagnall queries the utility of the siege train, as the rebels held no towns which could be besieged.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}}|group=note}} Hanno stormed the rebels' camp in the [[Battle of Utica]] and his elephants [[rout]]ed the besiegers. Hanno's army took over the camp and Hanno himself entered the city in triumph. However, the battle-hardened veterans of the Sicilian army regathered in the nearby hills and, not being pursued, returned towards Utica. The Carthaginians, accustomed to fighting the [[militia]]s of the Numidian cities, were still celebrating their victory when the rebels [[counterattack|counter-attacked]]. The Carthaginians fled, with great loss of life, losing their [[train (military)|baggage]] and siege trains. For the rest of the year Hanno skirmished with the rebel force, repeatedly missing opportunities to bring it to battle or to place it at a disadvantage; the military historian [[Nigel Bagnall]] writes of Hanno's \"incompetence as a field commander\".{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=6}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}}\n\nRome pointedly declined to take advantage of Carthage's troubles. Italians were prohibited from trading with the rebels but encouraged to trade with Carthage; 2,743 Carthaginian prisoners still held were released without a ransom being required and were immediately enrolled into Carthage's army.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}} [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero]], the king of the Roman satellite kingdom of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], was allowed to supply Carthage with the large amounts of food it needed and was no longer able to obtain from its own hinterland.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} In late 240 or early 239 BC the Carthaginian garrisons on [[Sardinia]] joined the mutiny, killing their officers and the island's governor. The Carthaginians sent a force to retake the island. When it arrived its members also mutinied, joined the previous mutineers, and killed all of the Carthaginians on the island. The mutineers then appealed to Rome for protection, which was refused.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=376}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=212}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}\n\n===Hamilcar===\n[[File:Macar240.PNG|thumb|left|upright=0.8|alt=A map showing the major movements of both sides during the Battle of the Bagradas River|{{center|The Battle of the Bagradas River}}]]\nAt some point during 240 BC the Carthaginians raised another, smaller, force, of approximately 10,000. It included deserters from the rebels, 2,000 cavalry, and 70 elephants. This was placed under the command of Hamilcar, who had commanded the Carthaginian forces on Sicily for the last six years of the First Punic War.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}} The rebels held the line of the [[Medjerda River|Bagradas River]] with 10,000 men commanded by Spendius. Hamilcar would need to force a crossing if he were to gain access to open country where he could manoeuvre. He did so by a [[Ruse de guerre|stratagem]], and Spendius was reinforced by an additional 15,000 men from the siege of Utica, which the rebels had renewed. The rebel force of 25,000 moved to attack Hamilcar in the [[Battle of the Bagradas River (c. 240 BC)|Battle of the Bagradas River]]. What happened next is unclear: it seems Hamilcar [[Feigned retreat|feigned a retreat]], the rebels broke ranks to pursue, the Carthaginians turned in good order and counter-attacked, routing the rebels, who suffered losses of 8,000 men.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=207}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=115\u2013117}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}}\n\nHamilcar was appointed joint commander of the Carthaginian army, alongside Hanno, but there was no cooperation between the two.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=209}} While Hanno manoeuvred against Matho to the north near Hippo, Hamilcar confronted various towns and cities which had gone over to the rebels, bringing them back to Carthaginian allegiance with varying mixtures of diplomacy and force. He was shadowed by a superior-sized rebel force, which kept to rough ground for fear of Hamilcar's cavalry and elephants, and harried his foragers and scouts.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=117}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=207\u2013208}} South west of Utica Hamilcar moved his force into the mountains in an attempt to bring the rebels to battle,{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=6}} but was surrounded. The Carthaginians were only saved from destruction when a Numidian leader, [[Navaras (Numidian)|Navaras]], who had served with and admired Hamilcar in Sicily, swapped sides with his 2,000 cavalry.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=150\u2013152}} This proved disastrous for the rebels, and in the [[Hamilcar's victory with Navaras|resulting battle]] they lost 10,000 killed and 4,000 captured.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=118}}\n\n===Truceless War===\n[[File:Guerra mercenaria (cropped).png|thumb|upright=|alt=A map showing the major movements of both sides during the war|{{center|Main manoeuvres during the war}}]]\nSince leaving Carthage, Hamilcar had treated rebels he had captured well and offered them a choice of joining his army or free passage home. He made the same offer to the 4,000 captives from the recent battle.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=118}} The rebel leaders perceived this generous treatment as the motivation behind Navaras's defection and feared the disintegration of their army; they were aware that such generous terms would not be extended to them personally. To remove the possibility of any goodwill between the sides, they had 700 Carthaginian prisoners, including Gesco, tortured to death: they had their hands cut off, were castrated, their legs broken and were thrown into a pit and buried alive.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} Hamilcar, in turn, killed his prisoners. From this point, neither side showed any mercy, and the unusual ferocity of the fighting caused Polybius to term it the \"Truceless War\".{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} Any further prisoners taken by the Carthaginians were trampled to death by elephants.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=210}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=135}}\n\nAt some point between March and September 239 BC{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}} the previously loyal cities of Utica and Hippo slew their Carthaginian garrisons and joined the rebels. The people of Utica offered their city to the Romans, who declined. The classicist [[Richard Miles (historian)|Richard Miles]] writes that \"Rome was in no shape to embark on yet another war\" and wished to avoid acquiring a reputation for supporting mutinous uprisings.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=209\u2013210}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=136}} The rebels previously operating in the area moved south and laid siege to Carthage.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}}\n\nHaving a clear superiority in cavalry, Hamilcar raided the supply lines of the rebels around Carthage.{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} In mid-239 BC he was joined by Hanno and his army, but the two men disagreed as to the best strategy and operations were paralysed. Unusually, the choice of supreme commander was put to a vote of the army{{snd}}possibly only the officers{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=208}}{{snd}}and Hamilcar was elected; Hanno left the army.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=119}} In early 238 BC the lack of supplies forced the rebels to lift the siege of Carthage. They fell back to Tunis, from where they maintained a more distant blockade.{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=376}} While Matho maintained the blockade, Spendius led 40,000 men against Hamilcar. As in the previous year, they stayed to the higher and rougher terrain and harassed the Carthaginian army. After a period of campaigning, the details of which are not clear in the sources, Hamilcar trapped the rebels in a pass or mountain range known as the Saw. Pinned against mountains and with their food exhausted, the rebels ate their horses, their prisoners and then their slaves, hoping that Matho would [[sortie]] from Tunis to rescue them. Eventually, the surrounded troops forced their leaders to parley with Hamilcar, but on a thin pretext he took Spendius and his lieutenants prisoner. The rebels then attempted to fight their way out in the [[Battle of \"The Saw\"|Battle of the Saw]] and were massacred to a man.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=121\u2013122}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=146\u2013150}}\n\nHamilcar then marched on Tunis and laid siege to it in late 238 BC. The city was difficult to access from both the east and the west, so Hamilcar occupied a position to the south with half the army, and his deputy [[Hannibal (Mercenary War)|Hannibal]]{{#tag:ref|Not to be confused with [[Hannibal Barca]], of Second Punic War fame.|group=note}} was to the north with the balance. The rebel leaders taken captive prior to the Saw were [[crucifiction|crucified]] in full view of the city. Matho ordered a large-scale night attack, which surprised the Carthaginians, who suffered many casualties. One of their camps was overrun and they lost much of their baggage. In addition, Hannibal and a delegation of 30 Carthaginian notables who were visiting the army were captured. They were tortured and then nailed to the crosses previously occupied by Spendius and his colleagues. Hamilcar abandoned the siege and withdrew to the north.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=122}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=220\u2013223}}\n\nThe Senate encouraged reconciliation between Hanno and Hamilcar, and they agreed to serve together. Meanwhile, Matho and his army had left Tunis and marched {{convert|160|km|sigfig=1}} south to the wealthy city of [[Leptis Parva]], which had risen against Carthage earlier in the war.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=122}} Hanno and Hamilcar marched after them with an army totalling perhaps 40,000{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} including every Carthaginian citizen of military age. The rebels, rather than wait to be besieged, met the Carthaginians in open battle in mid- to late 238 BC.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=380}} No details of [[Battle of Leptis Parva|the battle]] survive,{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=8}} but the remaining 30,000 rebels{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} were wiped out and Matho captured with few losses to the Carthaginians. Any other prisoners were crucified, while Matho was dragged through the streets of Carthage and tortured to death by its inhabitants.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=211}} Most of the towns and cities which had not already come to terms with Carthage now did so, with the exceptions of Utica and Hippo, whose inhabitants feared vengeance for their massacre of Carthaginians. They attempted to hold out, but Polybius says that they too \"quickly\" surrendered, probably in late 238 or very early 237 BC.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=377}} The surrendered towns and cities were treated leniently, although Carthaginian governors were imposed on them.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=210}}\n\n===Sardinia===\n\nProbably in 237 BC{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=136}} the indigenous inhabitants of Sardinia rose up and drove out the mutinous garrison, which took refuge in Italy. As the war in Africa came to a close, they appealed again for Roman assistance. This time the Romans agreed and prepared an expedition to seize both Sardinia and [[Corsica]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}} It is unclear from the sources why the Romans acted differently from three years earlier.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=210}} Polybius held that this action was indefensible.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=569}} Carthage sent an embassy to Rome, which quoted the Treaty of Lutatius and claimed they were outfitting their own expedition to retake the island, which it had held for 300 years. The [[Roman Senate]] cynically stated that they considered the preparation of this force an act of war. Their peace terms were the ceding of Sardinia and Corsica and the payment of an additional 1,200 talent indemnity.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=569}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=209, 212\u2013213}}{{#tag:ref|1,200 talents was approximately {{convert|30|lt|kg|disp=flip}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} Weakened by 30 years of war, Carthage agreed rather than enter into a conflict with Rome again. The Romans required a strong military presence on the islands for at least the next seven years, as they struggled to suppress the local inhabitants. Polybius considered this act of bad faith by the Romans to be the single greatest cause of war with Carthage breaking out again in 218 BC in the [[Second Punic War]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=175}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe historian Dexter Hoyos writes that the  \"the truceless war ... produce[d] a complete and enduring reversal of Carthage's domestic fortunes and military orientation\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=206}} Miles agrees there was \"a period of profound political transformation\".{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=214}} The seizure of Sardinia and Corsica by Rome and the additional indemnity fuelled resentment in Carthage.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=211}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=213}} The role of Hamilcar Barca in the victory greatly enhanced the prestige and power of the [[Barcid]] family.

Mercer County was part of this \"Military Tract.\"\n\nSeven years after Illinois became a state, Mercer County was founded. It was formed from unorganized territory near [[Pike County, Illinois|Pike County]] on January 13, 1825.  Although the county had been created, its government was not organized for several years; for administration purposes it was attached first to Schuyler County (until 1826), then to Peoria (until 1831), and finally to Warren County.  The organization of the county government was finally completed in 1835, after a large influx of settlers following the [[Black Hawk War]].<ref>Mercer County Fact Sheet, Illinois State Archives.  {{cite web|url=http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/departments/archives/irad/mercer.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023015434/http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/departments/archives/irad/mercer.html |archivedate=2007-10-23 }}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Mercer_County_Illinois_1825.png|Mercer County at the time of its creation in 1825\nFile:Mercer County Illinois 1827.png|Mercer County in 1827, reduced to its present borders\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|569|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|561|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|7.5|sqmi}} (1.3%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/>\n\n===Climate and weather===\n{{climate chart\n|[[Aledo, Illinois]]\n|11|29|1.27\n|17|35|1.29\n|26|47|2.43\n|37|61|3.69\n|48|72|3.92\n|59|81|4.43\n|62|84|4.21\n|60|82|4.28\n|51|75|3.31\n|40|64|2.73\n|28|47|2.50\n|17|34|1.92\n|float=right\n|units=imperial\n|clear=both\n|source=The Weather Channel<ref name=\"weather\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIL0011\n  |title=Monthly Averages for Aledo, Illinois\n  |accessdate=2011-01-27\n  |publisher=The Weather Channel\n}}</ref>}}\nIn recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Aledo have ranged from a low of {{convert|11|\u00b0F}} in January to a high of {{convert|84|\u00b0F}} in July, although a record low of {{convert|-30|\u00b0F}} was recorded in February 1905 and a record high of {{convert|113|\u00b0F}} was recorded in July 1936.

After Johnson\u2019s victory in the county, Mercer voted to being Republican between 1968 and 1984, but [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]\u2019s landslide in that election saw a swing to the Democrats that was capitalized upon by [[Michael Dukakis]] to carry the county in 1988. Between then and 2012, Mercer was solidly Democratic, but concern over declining economic opportunities in the \u201c[[Rust Belt]]\u201d caused a dramatic swing to populist Republican [[Donald Trump]] in 2016. Trump\u2019s performance was the best by a Republican since [[Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon's]] 3,000-plus-county landslide in 1972.\n\nMercer County is located in [[Illinois's 17th congressional district|Illinois's 17th Congressional District]] and is currently represented by Democrat [[Cheri Bustos]].

Mercer County was part of this \"Military Tract.\"\n\nSeven years after Illinois became a state, Mercer County was founded. It was formed from unorganized territory near [[Pike County, Illinois|Pike County]] on January 13, 1825.  Although the county had been created, its government was not organized for several years; for administration purposes it was attached first to Schuyler County (until 1826), then to Peoria (until 1831), and finally to Warren County.  The organization of the county government was finally completed in 1835, after a large influx of settlers following the [[Black Hawk War]].<ref>Mercer County Fact Sheet, Illinois State Archives.  {{cite web|url=http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/departments/archives/irad/mercer.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023015434/http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/departments/archives/irad/mercer.html |archivedate=2007-10-23 }}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Mercer_County_Illinois_1825.png|Mercer County at the time of its creation in 1825\nFile:Mercer County Illinois 1827.png|Mercer County in 1827, reduced to its present borders\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|569|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|561|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|7.5|sqmi}} (1.3%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/>\n\n===Climate and weather===\n{{climate chart\n|[[Aledo, Illinois]]\n|11|29|1.27\n|17|35|1.29\n|26|47|2.43\n|37|61|3.69\n|48|72|3.92\n|59|81|4.43\n|62|84|4.21\n|60|82|4.28\n|51|75|3.31\n|40|64|2.73\n|28|47|2.50\n|17|34|1.92\n|float=right\n|units=imperial\n|clear=both\n|source=The Weather Channel<ref name=\"weather\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIL0011\n  |title=Monthly Averages for Aledo, Illinois\n  |accessdate=2011-01-27\n  |publisher=The Weather Channel\n}}</ref>}}\nIn recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Aledo have ranged from a low of {{convert|11|\u00b0F}} in January to a high of {{convert|84|\u00b0F}} in July, although a record low of {{convert|-30|\u00b0F}} was recorded in February 1905 and a record high of {{convert|113|\u00b0F}} was recorded in July 1936.

After Johnson\u2019s victory in the county, Mercer voted to being Republican between 1968 and 1984, but [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]\u2019s landslide in that election saw a swing to the Democrats that was capitalized upon by [[Michael Dukakis]] to carry the county in 1988. Between then and 2012, Mercer was solidly Democratic, but concern over declining economic opportunities in the \u201c[[Rust Belt]]\u201d caused a dramatic swing to populist Republican [[Donald Trump]] in 2016. Trump\u2019s performance was the best by a Republican since [[Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon's]] 3,000-plus-county landslide in 1972.\n\nMercer County is located in [[Illinois's 17th congressional district|Illinois's 17th Congressional District]] and is currently represented by Democrat [[Cheri Bustos]].

They shipped them outside of Chicago to have them cleaned and then repackaged and re-shipped back to Chicago. The \"new\" shipments of onions caused many futures traders to think that there was an excess of onions and further drove down onion prices in Chicago. By the end of the onion season in March 1956, Siegel and Kosuga had flooded the markets with their onions and driven the price of {{convert|50|lb|kg}} of onions down to 10 cents a bag.<ref name=Greising1991p81/> In August 1955, the same quantity of onions had been priced at $2.75 a bag.<ref name=\"TIME\"/> So many onions were shipped to Chicago in order to depress prices that there were onion shortages in other parts of the United States.<ref name=Markham2002>{{Harvnb|Markham|2002|p=324}}</ref>\n\nSiegel and Kosuga made millions of dollars on the transaction due to their short position on onion futures.<ref name=Lambert2010p42/> At one point, however, {{convert|50|lb|kg}} of onions were selling in Chicago for less than the bags that held them. This drove many onion farmers into bankruptcy.<ref name=Lambert2010p42/> A public outcry ensued among onion farmers who were left with large amounts of worthless inventory.<ref name=Greising1991p82>{{Harvnb|Greising|Morse|1991|p=82}}</ref> Many of the farmers had to pay to dispose of the large amounts of onions that they had purchased and grown.<ref name=Lambert2010p43/>\n\n===Regulatory action===\nIn the aftermath of the crash, many commentators characterized Kosuga's actions as [[Speculative attack|unprincipled gambling]].<ref name=Lambert2010p43>{{Harvnb|Lambert|2010|p=43}}</ref> The abrupt change in prices gained the attention of the [[Commodity Exchange Authority]].<ref name=\"TIME\"/> Soon they launched an investigation and the U.S. [[United States Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry|Senate Committee on Agriculture]] and [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|House Committee on Agriculture]] held hearings on the matter.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nDuring the hearings, the Commodity Exchange Authority stated that it was the perishable nature of onion which made them vulnerable to price swings.<ref name=Markham2002/> Then-congressman [[Gerald Ford]] of Michigan sponsored a bill, known as the Onion Futures Act, which banned futures trading in onions. The bill was unpopular among traders, some of whom argued that onion shortages were not a crucial issue since they were used as a condiment rather than a staple food. The president of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, [[E.B. Harris]], lobbied hard against the bill. Harris described it as \"Burning down the barn to find a suspected rat\".<ref name=Lambert2010p43/> The measure was passed, however, and President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] signed the bill in August 1958.<ref name=Lambert2010p43/>.  Thus, onions were excluded from the definition of \"commodity\" in the Commodity Exchange Act.<ref>https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/1a</ref>\n\n==Impact==\n\n===Effect on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange===\nAfter the ban was passed, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging that the ban unfairly restricted trade.

The other products that were traded, including futures contracts on eggs, turkeys, and potatoes, were not large enough to support the exchange.<ref name=Lambert2010p44/> This led to the emergence of new leadership who pioneered a different strategy, expanding the exchange's traded products to include futures contracts on [[Pork belly|pork bellies]] and frozen concentrate [[orange juice]].<ref name=Greising1991p80/><ref name=Lambert2010p48>{{Harvnb|Lambert|2010|p=48}}</ref> These proved to be popular products and eventually restored lost popularity to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.<ref name=Lambert2010p53>{{Harvnb|Lambert|2010|p=53}}</ref>\n\n===Effect on price volatility===\nThe ban has provided academics with a unique opportunity to study the effect of an active [[futures market]] on commodity prices. Experts have been divided on the effect that onion futures trading has on the volatility of onion prices.\n\n[[Holbrook Working]] published a study in 1960 which argued that price volatility declined after the futures market for onions was introduced in the 1940s.<ref>Working, Holbrook (1960-02). \"Price Effects of Futures Trading.\" Reprinted from Food Research Institute Studies, Vol. 1, No. 1, February  1960, in Selected Writings of Holbrook Working, Anne E.

The bill was unpopular among traders, some of whom argued that onion shortages were not a crucial issue since they were used as a condiment rather than a staple food. The president of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, [[E.B. Harris]], lobbied hard against the bill. Harris described it as \"Burning down the barn to find a suspected rat\".<ref name=Lambert2010p43/> The measure was passed, however, and President [[Dwight D.

The neighborhood was created by connecting several islands using [[land reclamation|land fill]]. It was annexed by Boston in 1836. It is separated from downtown Boston by [[Boston Harbor]] and bordered by [[Winthrop, Massachusetts|Winthrop]], [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]], [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]], and the [[Chelsea Creek]]. Southwest of East Boston, across Boston Inner Harbor, is the [[North End, Boston|North End]] and Boston's [[Financial District, Boston|Financial District]].\n\nEast Boston has long provided a foothold for the latest immigrants with [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Russian Jews]] and later, [[Italians]].<ref name=x/>  [[John F.

Not long after Boston was settled, Noddle Island served as grazing land for [[cattle]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Sweetser |first=Moses Foster |title=King's Handbook of Boston Harbor |publisher=Moses King Corporation |url=https://archive.org/details/kingshandbookbo01copegoog |accessdate=April 8, 2016 |year=1888 |location= |isbn= |page= [https://archive.org/details/kingshandbookbo01copegoog/page/n118 124]}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, people used ferries to get from East Boston to downtown.  They were eventually replaced by the streetcar tunnel that became the [[MBTA Blue Line]].  Additionally, the five islands were connected using landfill, the latter three during the expansion of Logan Airport during [[World War II]].\n\n[[Image:Sumner.jpg|thumb|right|[[William H. Sumner]]]]\n\nIn 1801, [[William H. Sumner]] had proposed to the [[federal government of the United States]] to create a [[toll road|turnpike]] to connect [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] to Boston via the undeveloped Noddle's Island. He argued that the road would create a much more direct route, making it easier for the neighborhood to develop. He stated\n\n<blockquote>... in my opinion that the circular route from [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]] thro' [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] to Boston is about 1 of a mile farther than a direct course over Noddle's Island in Boston ... The course suggested will be almost in a direct line, from my knowledge of the land ... On the back part of the Island is a muddy creek and the distance of the Island to Boston is not so great by one third, I presume as it is from Chelsea to Moreton Point in Charlestown ... There is no doubt that but that the necessities of the town of Boston will some require a connection with Noddle's Island with the town of which it is part.<ref name=SumnerChap14and15>{{cite book |last=Sumner |first=William H. |title=A History of East Boston |url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=CVJ3twAACAAJ |accessdate=March 18, 2013 |year=1858 |publisher=J. E. Tilton |location= |isbn= |page=Chapter 14\u201315 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe one issue that Sumner foresaw, but glossed over, was that land in Charlestown was purchased by the federal government as the site for a future [[Boston Navy Yard|naval yard]]. The ships en route from this yard to the [[Atlantic Ocean|ocean]] would be blocked by the proposed turnpike. Sumner believed this would not stand in his way, since a standing navy was in such disfavor at that point in the nation's history. However, the [[War of 1812]], which was considered a [[naval warfare|naval war]], changed the public's opinion about the needs for a naval yard. Because the route through East Boston and over the Boston Harbor would block ships route to the future [[Charlestown Navy Yard]] the turnpike was planned to go through Chelsea as opposed to Noddle's Island.\n\n=== Formation of East Boston Company ===\nSumner began to make his move for the acquisition of all of Noddle's Island upon the death of Colonel David Stoddard Greenough, who had been a longtime holdout against selling to him.  Greenough died of [[apoplexy]], and his wife and children wanted to cede their portion of the island. In 1836, Sumner coincidentally married Greenough's widow, Maria Foster Doane.<ref>{{cite book|title=Memorial Biographies, 1845-1871: 1860-1862, Vol. IV.|year=1885|publisher=The New England Historic Genealogical Society|page=354|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cb1PAQAAIAAJ}}</ref>  With the assistance of his new business partners, Steven White and Francis J. Oliver, he purchased the land for $100 per acre or $32,500. This purchase gave Sumner control of one half of the Island. Subsequently, in February 1832, the partners formed the East Boston Company. They stated that their part of the Island was to be divided into 666 shares and that it would be managed by a [[board of directors]], who would be able to sell the Company's interest in the island. Establishing transportation to the area was imperative and they were dedicated to pushing for a railroad connection from Boston to Salem over the Island.  They also wanted to establish a [[ferry]] system from Boston. Each share of the Company was equivalent to {{convert|0.5|acre|m2|adj=on}}. There were 5,280 acres in total, of which Sumner owned 1320; Mrs. Gerard, 880; Steven White, 880; and Oliver, 440.  The rest were spread among twenty-nine other shareholders. By the end of 1833, the East Boston Company had complete control over the entire Island.\n\n=== Connections to the mainland ===\n[[Image:East-Boston-1838.PNG|thumb|left|East Boston in 1838]]\n[[Image:East-Boston-Arial-1879.png|thumb|left|East Boston in 1879]]\n\nIn the 1830s, the largest problem keeping East Boston from thriving was transportation.  The East Boston Company believed the neighborhood could not become a valuable asset until people had a way to reach the area from the Boston mainland. As a temporary solution, they set up a [[paddle steamer]] to carry 15 people at a time from Boston Proper to the neighborhood. It was used primarily for occasional visits from public officials and laborers. Though they did not have the ridership to support additional boats, the company purchased the Tom Thumb [[steamboat]].\n\nThe [[steam railroad]] system was still in its infancy at this point, and the East Boston Company was approached by an inventor of a new type of rail system, the [[suspension railway]]. This system was one of the earliest suspended railroads to be built.  The [[railroad car]]s were propelled by a [[steam engine]] hanging from a suspended track. Henry Sargent, the inventor, stated \"that his invention would make the Island a center of attraction to many people.\"  The Company allowed it to be built on its land and it was in use for nine days in 1834, then closed citing lack of ridership.\n\n[[File:Most Holy Redeemer Church-East Boston.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Most Holy Redeemer Church was built in East Boston in 1844.]]\n  \nIn the mid-1830s, the Company made several investments to further East Boston's development. They continued attempts to get the [[Eastern Railroad (Massachusetts)|Eastern Railroad]] to come to East Boston.  The ''Maverick'' and ''East Boston'' ferries began service from [[Lewis Wharf]] on the mainland to East Boston.  A bridge to Chelsea was built, roads were laid out, and houses were built. Much of this activity was spurred by the formation of the East Boston Lumber Company. During this period, the [[Boston Sugar Refinery]] was also founded, which was the first manufacturing establishment in East Boston.

[[Clipper ships]] were built at the shipyard owned by [[Donald McKay]] in the mid-19th century. A [[rapid transit|subway]] tunnel connecting the neighborhood to the rest of the city opened in 1904 and was the first [[undersea tunnel]] of its kind in the United States.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Rows of houses were torn down to build the Sumner Tunnel in 1934 and the Callahan Tunnel in 1961, directly connecting automobile traffic from downtown Boston. In the early 1920s, an airfield was built, and eventually it was expanded to become Logan International Airport. The eastern terminus of [[Interstate 90]] (the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]) has been at [[Massachusetts Route 1A|Route 1A]] next to Logan Airport since 2003, and the newer [[Ted Williams Tunnel]] (1995) links I-90 from East Boston to the rest of the city.\n\nLogan Airport, New England's primary international airport and [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|48th busiest in the world]], resides mainly in East Boston (though part of the airfield itself lies in [[Winthrop, Massachusetts|Winthrop]]).

The neighborhood was created by connecting several islands using [[land reclamation|land fill]]. It was annexed by Boston in 1836. It is separated from downtown Boston by [[Boston Harbor]] and bordered by [[Winthrop, Massachusetts|Winthrop]], [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]], [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]], and the [[Chelsea Creek]]. Southwest of East Boston, across Boston Inner Harbor, is the [[North End, Boston|North End]] and Boston's [[Financial District, Boston|Financial District]].\n\nEast Boston has long provided a foothold for the latest immigrants with [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Russian Jews]] and later, [[Italians]].<ref name=x/>  [[John F.

Not long after Boston was settled, Noddle Island served as grazing land for [[cattle]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Sweetser |first=Moses Foster |title=King's Handbook of Boston Harbor |publisher=Moses King Corporation |url=https://archive.org/details/kingshandbookbo01copegoog |accessdate=April 8, 2016 |year=1888 |location= |isbn= |page= [https://archive.org/details/kingshandbookbo01copegoog/page/n118 124]}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, people used ferries to get from East Boston to downtown.  They were eventually replaced by the streetcar tunnel that became the [[MBTA Blue Line]].  Additionally, the five islands were connected using landfill, the latter three during the expansion of Logan Airport during [[World War II]].\n\n[[Image:Sumner.jpg|thumb|right|[[William H. Sumner]]]]\n\nIn 1801, [[William H. Sumner]] had proposed to the [[federal government of the United States]] to create a [[toll road|turnpike]] to connect [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] to Boston via the undeveloped Noddle's Island. He argued that the road would create a much more direct route, making it easier for the neighborhood to develop. He stated\n\n<blockquote>... in my opinion that the circular route from [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]] thro' [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] to Boston is about 1 of a mile farther than a direct course over Noddle's Island in Boston ... The course suggested will be almost in a direct line, from my knowledge of the land ... On the back part of the Island is a muddy creek and the distance of the Island to Boston is not so great by one third, I presume as it is from Chelsea to Moreton Point in Charlestown ... There is no doubt that but that the necessities of the town of Boston will some require a connection with Noddle's Island with the town of which it is part.<ref name=SumnerChap14and15>{{cite book |last=Sumner |first=William H. |title=A History of East Boston |url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=CVJ3twAACAAJ |accessdate=March 18, 2013 |year=1858 |publisher=J. E. Tilton |location= |isbn= |page=Chapter 14\u201315 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe one issue that Sumner foresaw, but glossed over, was that land in Charlestown was purchased by the federal government as the site for a future [[Boston Navy Yard|naval yard]]. The ships en route from this yard to the [[Atlantic Ocean|ocean]] would be blocked by the proposed turnpike. Sumner believed this would not stand in his way, since a standing navy was in such disfavor at that point in the nation's history. However, the [[War of 1812]], which was considered a [[naval warfare|naval war]], changed the public's opinion about the needs for a naval yard. Because the route through East Boston and over the Boston Harbor would block ships route to the future [[Charlestown Navy Yard]] the turnpike was planned to go through Chelsea as opposed to Noddle's Island.\n\n=== Formation of East Boston Company ===\nSumner began to make his move for the acquisition of all of Noddle's Island upon the death of Colonel David Stoddard Greenough, who had been a longtime holdout against selling to him.  Greenough died of [[apoplexy]], and his wife and children wanted to cede their portion of the island. In 1836, Sumner coincidentally married Greenough's widow, Maria Foster Doane.<ref>{{cite book|title=Memorial Biographies, 1845-1871: 1860-1862, Vol. IV.|year=1885|publisher=The New England Historic Genealogical Society|page=354|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cb1PAQAAIAAJ}}</ref>  With the assistance of his new business partners, Steven White and Francis J. Oliver, he purchased the land for $100 per acre or $32,500. This purchase gave Sumner control of one half of the Island. Subsequently, in February 1832, the partners formed the East Boston Company. They stated that their part of the Island was to be divided into 666 shares and that it would be managed by a [[board of directors]], who would be able to sell the Company's interest in the island. Establishing transportation to the area was imperative and they were dedicated to pushing for a railroad connection from Boston to Salem over the Island.  They also wanted to establish a [[ferry]] system from Boston. Each share of the Company was equivalent to {{convert|0.5|acre|m2|adj=on}}. There were 5,280 acres in total, of which Sumner owned 1320; Mrs. Gerard, 880; Steven White, 880; and Oliver, 440.  The rest were spread among twenty-nine other shareholders. By the end of 1833, the East Boston Company had complete control over the entire Island.\n\n=== Connections to the mainland ===\n[[Image:East-Boston-1838.PNG|thumb|left|East Boston in 1838]]\n[[Image:East-Boston-Arial-1879.png|thumb|left|East Boston in 1879]]\n\nIn the 1830s, the largest problem keeping East Boston from thriving was transportation.  The East Boston Company believed the neighborhood could not become a valuable asset until people had a way to reach the area from the Boston mainland. As a temporary solution, they set up a [[paddle steamer]] to carry 15 people at a time from Boston Proper to the neighborhood. It was used primarily for occasional visits from public officials and laborers. Though they did not have the ridership to support additional boats, the company purchased the Tom Thumb [[steamboat]].\n\nThe [[steam railroad]] system was still in its infancy at this point, and the East Boston Company was approached by an inventor of a new type of rail system, the [[suspension railway]]. This system was one of the earliest suspended railroads to be built.  The [[railroad car]]s were propelled by a [[steam engine]] hanging from a suspended track. Henry Sargent, the inventor, stated \"that his invention would make the Island a center of attraction to many people.\"  The Company allowed it to be built on its land and it was in use for nine days in 1834, then closed citing lack of ridership.\n\n[[File:Most Holy Redeemer Church-East Boston.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Most Holy Redeemer Church was built in East Boston in 1844.]]\n  \nIn the mid-1830s, the Company made several investments to further East Boston's development. They continued attempts to get the [[Eastern Railroad (Massachusetts)|Eastern Railroad]] to come to East Boston.  The ''Maverick'' and ''East Boston'' ferries began service from [[Lewis Wharf]] on the mainland to East Boston.  A bridge to Chelsea was built, roads were laid out, and houses were built. Much of this activity was spurred by the formation of the East Boston Lumber Company. During this period, the [[Boston Sugar Refinery]] was also founded, which was the first manufacturing establishment in East Boston.  They are credited for the creation of white [[granulated sugar]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |year=1882 |title=The Sugar Cane |journal= |volume= |issue=14 |pages=487 |publisher=Galt and Company |doi= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CRVOAAAAYAAJ&dq=Boston+Sugar+Refinery+%22east+boston%22+white+granulated+sugar |accessdate=18 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Kennedy family ===\n{{quote|When my great grandfather left here to become a cooper in East Boston, he carried nothing with him except two things: a strong religious faith and a strong desire for liberty.
