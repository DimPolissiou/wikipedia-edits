This created the distinctive Western outline of a tailored top worn over leggings or trousers.\n\nThe pace of change accelerated considerably in the following century, and women's and men's fashion, especially in the dressing and adorning of the hair, became equally complex. [[Art history|Art historians]] are, therefore ,able to use fashion with confidence and precision to date images, often to within five years, particularly in the case of images from the 15th century. Initially, changes in fashion led to a fragmentation across the upper classes of Europe of what had previously been a very similar style of dressing and the subsequent development of distinctive national styles. These national styles remained very different until a counter-movement in the 17th to 18th centuries imposed similar styles once again, mostly originating from [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] [[France]].<ref>Braudel, 317\u2013324</ref> Though the rich usually led fashion, the increasing affluence of [[early modern Europe]] led to the [[bourgeoisie]] and even peasants following trends at a distance, but still uncomfortably close for the elites \u2013 a factor that Fernand Braudel regards as one of the main motors of changing fashion.<ref>Braudel, 313\u2013315</ref>\n\n[[File:ADurerNuremburgVenetianWomen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s drawing contrasts a well turned out ''bourgeoise'' from [[Nuremberg]] (left) with her counterpart from Venice.

[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] illustrated the differences in his actual (or composite) contrast of Nuremberg and Venetian fashions at the close of the 15th century (''illustration, right''). The \"Spanish style\" of the late 16th century began the move back to synchronicity among upper-class Europeans, and after a struggle in the mid-17th century, French styles decisively took over leadership, a process completed in the 18th century.<ref>Braudel, 317\u2013321</ref>\n\nThough different textile colors and patterns changed from year to year,<ref>Thornton, Peter. ''Baroque and Rococo Silks''.</ref> the cut of a gentleman's coat and the length of his waistcoat, or the pattern to which a lady's dress was cut, changed more slowly. Men's fashions were primarily derived from military models, and changes in a European male silhouette were galvanized in theaters of European war where gentleman officers had opportunities to make notes of different styles such as the \"Steinkirk\" [[cravat]] or necktie.\n\n[[File:MA-Lebrun.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Marie Antoinette]], wife of Louis XVI, was a leader of fashion.

By 1800, all Western Europeans were dressing alike (or thought they were); local variation became first a sign of provincial culture and later a badge of the conservative peasant.<ref>James Laver and Fernand Braudel, op cit</ref>\n\nAlthough tailors and dressmakers were no doubt responsible for many innovations, and the textile industry indeed led many trends, the [[history of fashion design]] is generally understood to date from 1858 when the English-born [[Charles Frederick Worth]] opened the first authentic ''[[haute couture]]'' house in Paris. The Haute house was the name established by the government for the fashion houses that met the standards of the industry.  These fashion houses have to adhere to standards such as keeping at least twenty employees engaged in making the clothes, showing two collections per year at fashion shows, and presenting a certain number of patterns to costumers.<ref>Claire B.

[[Fashion week]]s are held in these cities, where designers exhibit their new clothing collections to audiences.  A succession of major designers such as [[Coco Chanel]] and [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint-Laurent]] have kept Paris as the center most watched by the rest of the world, although ''haute couture'' is now subsidized by the sale of [[ready-to-wear]] collections and perfume using the same branding.\n\nModern [[Western culture|West]]erners have a vast number of choices available in the selection of their clothes. What a person chooses to wear can reflect his or her personality or interests. When people who have high cultural [[Social status|status]] start to wear new or different clothes, a fashion trend may start. People who like or respect these people become influenced by their style and begin wearing similarly styled clothes. Fashions may vary considerably within a society according to age, [[social class]], generation, occupation, and geography and may also vary over time. If an older person dresses according to the fashion young people use, he or she may look ridiculous in the eyes of both young and older people. The terms ''fashionista'' and ''[[fashion victim]]'' refer to someone who slavishly follows current fashions.\n\nOne can regard the system of sporting various fashions as a fashion language incorporating various fashion statements using a grammar of fashion. (Compare some of the work of [[Roland Barthes]].)\n\nIn recent years, Asian fashion has become increasingly significant in local and global markets. Countries such as China, Japan, India, and Pakistan have traditionally had large textile industries, which have often been drawn upon by Western designers, but now Asian clothing styles are also gaining influence based on their ideas.<ref>Lemire, B., & Riello, G (2008). \"East & West: Textiles and Fashion in Early Modern Europe\".

It was handmade for individuals, either as home production or on order from dressmakers and tailors. By the beginning of the 20th century\u2014with the rise of new technologies such as the [[sewing machine]], the rise of global capitalism and the development of the factory system of production, and the proliferation of retail outlets such as department stores\u2014clothing had increasingly come to be [[mass production|mass-produced]] in standard sizes and sold at fixed prices.\n\nAlthough the fashion industry developed first in Europe and America, {{as of | 2017 | lc = on}}, it is an international and highly globalized industry, with clothing often designed in one country, manufactured in another, and sold worldwide. For example, an American fashion company might source fabric in China and have the clothes manufactured in Vietnam, finished in Italy, and shipped to a warehouse in the United States for distribution to retail outlets internationally. The fashion industry has long been one of the largest employers in the United States,<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry#toc296474</ref> and it remains so in the 21st century. However, U.S. employment declined considerably as production increasingly moved overseas, especially to China. Because data on the fashion industry typically are reported for national economies and expressed in terms of the industry's many separate sectors, aggregate figures for the world [[textile industry|production of textiles]] and [[Clothing industry|clothing]] are difficult to obtain. However, by any measure, the clothing industry accounts for a significant share of world economic output.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/cheap-clothes-2012-6/|title=How Bargain Fashion Chains Will Keep Themselves Cut-Rate -- New York Magazine|work=NYMag.com|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref>\nThe fashion industry consists of four levels:\n\n# The production of raw materials, principally Fiber ,and textiles but also leather and fur.\n#The production of fashion goods by designers, manufacturers, contractors, and others.\n# Retail sales.\n# Various forms of advertising and promotion.\n\nThese levels consist of many separate but interdependent sectors.

For example, First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] was a fashionable icon of the early 1960s who led the formal dressing trend. By wearing a Chanel suit, a structural Givenchy shift dress ,or a soft color Cassini coat with Large buttons, it created her elegant look and led a delicate trend.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5J3PDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA52#v=onepage&q=First%20Lady%20Jacqueline%20Kennedy%20was%20a%20fashionable%20icon%20of%20the%20early%201960s|title=Women in Fashion|last=Rissman|first=Rebecca|date=2016-08-15|publisher=ABDO|isbn=9781680774856}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the political revolution also made much impact on the fashion trend. For example, during the 1960s, the economy had become wealthier, the divorce rate was increasing ,and the government approved the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]. This revolution inspired the younger generation to rebellion. In 1964, the leg-baring mini-skirt became a significant  fashion trend of the 1960s. Given that fashion designers began to experiment with the shapes of garment, loose sleeveless, micro-minis, flared skirts, and trumpet sleeves. In this case, the mini-skirt trend became an icon of the 1960s.\n\nMoreover, the political movement built an impressive relationship with fashion trends. For instance, during the Vietnam war, the youth of America made a movement that affected the whole country. In the 1960s, the fashion trend was full of fluorescent colors, prints patterns, bell-bottom jeans, fringed vests, and skirt became a protest outfit of the 1960s. This trend was called Hippie , and it is still affecting the current fashion trend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://classroom.synonym.com/political-economic-factors-influenced-fashion-1960s-12014.html|title=Political & Economic Factors That Influenced Fashion in the 1960s {{!}} The Classroom {{!}} Synonym|website=classroom.synonym.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Technology influences ===\n\nTechnology plays a significant role in most aspects of today's society. Technological influences are growing more apparent in the fashion industry. Advances and new developments are shaping and creating current and future trends.\n\nDevelopments such as wearable technology have become an essential trend in fashion.

The camouflage pattern in clothing was developed to help military personnel be less visible to enemy forces.  A trend emerged in the 1960s , and camouflage fabric was introduced to streetwear.

People have also become more conscious of the impact their everyday consumption has on the environment and society, and these initiatives are often described as a move towards [[sustainable fashion]], yet critics argue a circular economy based on growth is an oxymoron, or an increasing spiral of consumption, rather than a utopian [[Cradle-to-cradle design|cradle-to-cradle]] circular solution.\n\nIn today's linear economical system, manufacturers extract resources from the earth to make products that will soon be discarded in landfills, on the other hand, under the [[Circular economy|circular]] model, the production of goods operates like systems in nature, where the waste and demise of a substance becomes the food and source of growth for something new. Companies such as MUD Jeans, which is based in the Netherlands employs a leasing scheme for jeans. This Dutch company \"represents a new consuming philosophy that is about using instead of owning,\" according to MUD's website. The concept also protects the company from volatile cotton prices. Consumers pay \u20ac7.50 a month for a pair of jeans; after a year, they can return the jeans to Mud,  trade them for a new pair and start another year-long lease, or keep them. MUD is responsible for any repairs during the lease period.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another ethical fashion company, [[Patagonia (clothing)|Patagonia]] set up the first multi-seller branded store on EBay in order to facilitate secondhand sales; consumers who take the Common Threads pledge can sell in this store and have their gear listed on Patagonia.com's \"Used Gear\" section.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== China's domestic spending ====\nConsumption as a share of gross domestic product in China has fallen for six decades, from 76 percent in 1952 to 28 percent in 2011. China plans to reduce [[tariff]]s on a number of consumer goods and expand its 72-hour transit visa plan to more cities in an effort to stimulate domestic consumption.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Ap|first=Tiffany|date=November 2015|title=China Makes Moves to Boost Consumption|url=http://0-wwd.com.library.scad.edu/retail-news/markets/china-consumption-beijing-import-tax-10286320/|journal=Women's Wear Daily|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe announcement of import tax reductions follows changes in June 2015, when the government cut the tariffs on clothing, cosmetics and various other goods by half. Among the changes \u2014 easier tax refunds for overseas shoppers and accelerated openings of more duty-free shops in cities covered by the 72-hour visa scheme. The 72-hour visa was introduced in Beijing and Shanghai in January 2013 and has been extended to 18 Chinese cities.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAccording to reports at the same time, Chinese consumer spending in other countries such as Japan has slowed even though the yen has dropped.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kaiser|first=Amanda|date=14 March 2016|title=Tokyo Fashion Week Starts in Challenging Economy|url=http://0-wwd.com.library.scad.edu/business-news/sourcing-global-markets/japan-fashion-week-fall-2016-10388614-10388614/|journal=Women's Wear Daily|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> There is clearly a trend in the next 5 years that the domestic fashion market will show an increase.\n\nChina is an interesting market for fashion retail as Chinese consumers' motivation to shop for fashion items are unique from Western Audiences.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Christopher J.|last2=Wenyu|first2=Lu|date=2019-05-13|title=What influences Chinese fashion retail?

Chinese high-street shoppers prefer adventure and social shopping, while online shoppers are motived by idea shopping. Another difference is how gratification and idea shopping influence spending over \u00a51k per month on fashion items, and regular spending influenced by value shopping.\n\n=== Marketing ===\n[[File:Petite Panoply- Trip to Cumberland Island, Georgia (20775335400).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A tourist couple wearing [[casual attire|casual]] clothes at [[Cumberland Island]], 2015]]\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=250\n| image1 = Chinese model posing as CEO (6759428801).jpg\n| image2 = LG\uc5d1\uc2a4\ub178\ud2b8 X300\u2019\uc758 CF \ub9e4\uc9c1(Magic)\ud3b8 (cropped).jpg\n| footer = Models posing in [[Informal attire|corporate office wear]].\n}}\n\n====Market research====\nConsumers of different groups have varying needs and demands. Factors taken into consideration when thinking of consumers' needs include key demographics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/consumer-needs-marketing-997.html|title=Consumer Needs & Marketing|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref>\nTo understand consumers' needs and predict fashion trends, fashion companies have to do [[market research]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://strategyn.com/customer-needs/|title=Strategyn|website=Strategyn|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref> There are two research methods: primary and secondary.<ref name=\"Consumer Research Methods\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.consumerpsychologist.com/cb_Research_Methods.html|title=Consumer Research Methods|website=www.consumerpsychologist.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref> Secondary methods are taking other information that has already been collected, for example using a book or an article for research. Primary research is collecting data through surveys, interviews, observation, and/or focus groups. Primary research often focuses on large sample sizes to determine customer's motivations to shop.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Christopher J.|last2=Wenyu|first2=Lu|date=2019-05-13|title=What influences Chinese fashion retail? Shopping motivations, demographics and spending|url=https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JFMM-09-2017-0093/full/html|journal=Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management: An International Journal|language=en|volume=23|issue=2|pages=158\u2013175|doi=10.1108/JFMM-09-2017-0093|issn=1361-2026}}</ref>\n\nBenefits of primary research is specific information about a fashion brand's consumer is explored. Surveys are helpful tools; questions can be open-ended or closed-ended. A negative factor surveys and interviews present is that the answers can be biased, due to wording in the survey or on face-to-face interactions.  Focus groups, about 8 to 12 people, can be beneficial because several points can be addressed in depth. However, there are drawbacks to this tactic, too. With such a small sample size, it is hard to know if the greater public would react the same way as the focus group.<ref name=\"Consumer Research Methods\"/> Observation can really help a company gain insight on what a consumer truly wants. There is less of a bias because consumers are just performing their daily tasks, not necessarily realizing they are being observed. For example, observing the public by taking street style photos of people, the consumer did not get dressed in the morning knowing that would have their photo taken necessarily. They just wear what they would normally wear. Through observation patterns can be seen, helping trend forecasters know what their target market needs and wants.\n\nKnowing the needs of the consumers will increase a fashion companies' sales and profits. Through research and studying the consumers' lives the needs of the customer can be obtained and help fashion brands know what trends the consumers are ready for.\n\n====Symbolic consumption====\nConsumption is driven not only by need, the symbolic meaning for consumers is also a factor. Consumers engaging in symbolic consumption may develop a sense of self over an extended period of time as various objects are collected as part of the process of establishing their identity and, when the symbolic meaning is shared in a social group, to communicate their identity to others. For teenagers consumption plays a role in distinguishing the child self from the adult. Researchers have found that the fashion choices of teenagers are used for self-expression and also to recognize other teens who wear similar clothes. The symbolic association of clothing items can link individuals personality and interests, with music as a prominent factor influencing fashion decisions.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Piacentini |first1=Maria |title=Symbolic consumption in teenagers' clothing choices |journal=Journal of Consumer Behavior |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=251-262}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n[[File:Tanzturnier 28.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Latin dance]]rs in their [[costume]]s. The woman is wearing [[backless dress]] with deep slits on its lower portion, while the man is wearing a shirt with top buttons open.]]\n\nThe media plays a significant role when it comes to fashion. For instance, an important part of fashion is [[fashion journalism]]. Editorial critique, guidelines, and commentary can be found on television and in magazines, newspapers, fashion websites, social networks, and [[fashion blog]]s. In recent years, fashion blogging and [[YouTube]] videos have become a major outlet for spreading trends and fashion tips, creating an online culture of sharing one's style on a website or Instagram account. Through these media outlets readers and viewers all over the world can learn about fashion, making it very accessible.<ref>Fashion (2012, March 29). Wwd. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news</ref> In addition to fashion journalism, another media platform that is important in fashion industry is advertisement. Advertisements provide information to audiences and promote the sales of products and services. Fashion industry utilizes advertisements to attract consumers and promote its products to generate sales. Few decades ago when technology was still underdeveloped, advertisements heavily relied on radio, magazines, billboards, and newspapers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://smallbusiness.chron.com/examples-traditional-advertising-24312.html|title=Examples of Traditional Advertising|last=Lauren|first=Lynn|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> These days, there are more various ways in advertisements such as television ads, online-based ads using internet websites, and posts, videos, and live streaming in social media platforms.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, fashion magazines began to include photographs of various fashion designs and became even more influential than in the past.<ref>{{Citation|publisher=Fairchild Publications|isbn=9781501303869|doi=10.5040/9781501303869.ch-014|title = Marketing Fashion|year = 2012|chapter = Fashion Advertising, Sales Promotion, and Public Relations}}</ref> In cities throughout the world these magazines were greatly sought after and had a profound effect on public taste in clothing. Talented illustrators drew exquisite fashion plates for the publications which covered the most recent developments in fashion and beauty. Perhaps the most famous of these magazines was ''[[La Gazette du Bon Ton]]'', which was founded in 1912 by Lucien Vogel and regularly published until 1925 (with the exception of the war years).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abebooks.com/books/features/lithographs/gazette-du-bon-ton.shtml|title=Gazette du Bon Ton: A Journal of Good Taste|website=www.abebooks.com|access-date=2018-07-04}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Crystal Couture Fashion Show & Sale (32801142162).jpg|thumb|upright|A [[See-through clothing|see-through]] top worn along with [[pasties]] by a model at a [[fashion show]] in USA, 2017. Such [[fashion trend]]s get popularised through media.]]\n''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', founded in the United States in 1892, has been the longest-lasting and most successful of the hundreds of fashion magazines that have come and gone. Increasing affluence after [[World War&nbsp;II]] and, most importantly, the advent of cheap color printing in the 1960s, led to a huge boost in its sales and heavy coverage of fashion in mainstream women's magazines, followed by men's magazines in the 1990s. One such example of ''Vogue'''s popularity is the younger version, ''[[Teen Vogue]]'', which covers clothing and trends that are targeted more toward the \"fashionista on a budget\". [[Haute couture]] designers followed the trend by starting [[ready-to-wear]] and [[perfume]] lines which are heavily advertised in the magazines and now dwarf their original couture businesses. A recent development within fashion print media is the rise of text-based and critical magazines which aim to prove that fashion is not superficial, by creating a dialogue between fashion academia and the industry. Examples of this trend are: ''[[Fashion Theory (journal)|Fashion Theory]]'' (1997)  and ''[[Vestoj]]'' (2009). Television coverage began in the 1950s with small fashion features. In the 1960s and 1970s, fashion segments on various entertainment shows became more frequent, and by the 1980s, dedicated fashion shows such as ''[[Fashion Television]]'' started to appear. ''[[FashionTV]]'' was the pioneer in this undertaking and has since grown to become the leader in both Fashion Television and new media channels. The Fashion Industry is beginning to promote their styles through Bloggers on social media's. Vogue specified Chiara Ferragni as \"blogger of the moment\" due to the rises of followers through her Fashion Blog, that became popular.<ref>Fateh, Azhar. \u201cHow Social Media Is Changing Fashion?\u201d The Huffington Post, TheHuffingtonPost.com, 19 Jan. 2017, Retrieved From www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-social-media-is-changing-fashion_us_587edd29e4b06a0baf64918f.</ref>\n\nA few days after the 2010 Fall Fashion Week in New York City came to a close, ''[[The New Islander]]'''s Fashion Editor, Genevieve Tax, criticized the fashion industry for running on a seasonal schedule of its own, largely at the expense of real-world consumers. \"Because designers release their fall collections in the spring and their spring collections in the fall, fashion magazines such as ''Vogue'' always and only look forward to the upcoming season, promoting parkas come September while issuing reviews on shorts in January\", she writes. \"Savvy shoppers, consequently, have been conditioned to be extremely, perhaps impractically, farsighted with their buying.\"<ref>Tax, Genevieve.

Specific fashion brands have been featured in film, not only as [[product placement]] opportunities, but as bespoke items that have subsequently led to trends in fashion.<ref>Thompson, S.B.N., Hussein, Y., Jones, N.

This is evident not only from television shows directly spotlighting the fashion industry, but also movies, events and music videos which showcase fashion statements as well as promote specific brands through product placements.\n\n=== Controversial advertisements in fashion industry ===\n\n==== Racism in fashion advertisements ====\nThere are some fashion advertisements that were accused of racism and led to boycotts from the customers. Globally known, Swedish fashion brand H&M faced this issue with one of its children's wear advertisements in 2018. A black child wearing a hoodie with a slogan written as \"coolest monkey in the jungle\" right at the center was featured in the ad. When it was released, it immediate became controversial and even led to boycott. A lot of people including celebrities posted on social media about their resentments towards H&M and refusal to work with and buy its products. H&M issued a statement saying \"we apologise to anyone this may have offended\", which seemed insincere to some.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/hm-hoodie-racist-boycott-advertising-people-h-m-a8149246.html|title=People are boycotting H&M over 'racist' hoodie|date=2018-01-09|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> \nAnother fashion advertisement regarding racism is from GAP, American worldwide clothing brand. GAP collaborated with Ellen DeGeneres in 2016 for the advertisement. It features playful, four young girls where tall white girl is leaning with her arm on a shorter black girl's head. When this ad was released, some viewers harshly criticized that it underlies passive racism. A representative from The Root, black culture magazine commented on the ad that it portrays the message that the black people are undervalued and seen like props for white people to look better.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-35968787|title=Is this Gap advert racist?|date=2016-04-06|access-date=2019-10-29|language=en-GB}}</ref> There were different points of views on this issue, some saying that people are being too sensitive, and some getting offended.

British high fashion brand, Jimmy Choo, was blamed for having sexism in its ad which featured a female British mode wearing the brand's boots. In this two-minute ad, men whistle at a model, walking on the street with red, sleeveless mini dress. This ad gained lots of backlashes and criticism by the viewers since sexual harassment and misconduct was a huge issue during this time and even till now. Many people showed their dismay through social media posts, leading Jimmy Choo to pull down the ad from social media platforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mashable.com/2017/12/22/jimmy-choo-cara-delevingne-catcall-ad/|title=Jimmy Choo pulls Cara Delevingne ad after online backlash|last=Gallucci|first=Nicole|website=Mashable|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref>\n\nFrench luxury fashion brand Yves Saint Laurent also faced this issue with its print ad shown in Paris in 2017. A female model is wearing a fishnet tights with roller-skate stilettos, almost lying down with her legs opened in front of the camera. This advertisement brought harsh comments from the viewers and French advertising organization directors for going against the advertising codes related to \"respect for decency, dignity and those prohibiting submission, violence or dependence, as well as the use of stereotypes.\" They even said that this ad is causing \"mental harm to adolescents.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adage.com/article/advertising/degrading-yves-saint-laurent-ads-shock-french-public/308196|title='Misogynist' YSL Ads Shock Parisians Ahead of International Women's Day|date=2017-03-07|website=adage.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> Lot of sarcastic comments were made in social media about the ad and the poster was removed from the city.\n\n==Public relations and social media==\n[[File:Ines Sainz.jpg|thumb|upright|A Mexican sports reporter wearing [[little black dress]] and knee-high boots]]\n\nFashion [[public relations]] involves being in touch with a company's audiences and creating strong relationships with them, reaching out to media and initiating messages that project positive images of the company.<ref>Sherman, G., & Perlman, S.

A certain way is chosen and that becomes the fashion as defined by a certain people as a whole, so if a particular style has a meaning in an already occurring set of beliefs that style will become fashion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=39\u201355 [42]}}</ref> According to Ted Polhemus and Lynn Procter, fashion can be described as adornment, of which there are two types: fashion and anti-fashion. Through the capitalization and commoditisation of clothing, accessories, and shoes, etc., what once constituted anti-fashion becomes part of fashion as the lines between fashion and anti-fashion are blurred.<ref>{{cite book|last=Polhemus and Procter|first=Ted and Lynn|title=Fashion and Anti-fashion: An Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment|year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|page=12}}</ref>\n\nThe definition of fashion and [[anti-fashion]] is as follows:  Anti-fashion is fixed and changes little over time.  Anti-fashion is different depending on the cultural or social group one is associated with or where one lives, but within that group or locality the style changes little.  Fashion is the exact opposite of anti-fashion.  Fashion changes very quickly and is not affiliated with one group or area of the world but is spread out throughout the world wherever people can communicate easily with each other. For example, Queen Elizabeth II's 1953 coronation gown is an example of anti-fashion because it is traditional and does not change over any period whereas a gown from fashion designer Dior's collection of 1953 is fashion because the style will change every season as Dior comes up with a new gown to replace the old one. In the Dior gown the length, cut, fabric, and embroidery of the gown change from season to season.  Anti-fashion is concerned with maintaining the status quo while fashion is concerned with social mobility. Time is expressed in terms of continuity in anti-fashion and as change in fashion. Fashion has changing modes of adornment while anti-fashion has fixed modes of adornment. Indigenous and peasant modes of adornment are an example of anti-fashion. Change in fashion is part of the larger system and is structured to be a deliberate change in style.<ref>{{cite book|last=Polhemus and Procter|first=Ted and Lynn|title=Fashion and Anti-fashion: An Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment|year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|pages=12\u201313}}</ref>\n\nToday, people in rich countries are linked to people in poor countries through the commoditization and consumption of what is called fashion.  People work long hours in one area of the globe to produce things that people in another part of the globe are anxious to consume. An example of this is the chain of production and consumption of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoes, which are produced in Taiwan and then purchased in North America. At the production end, there is nation-building a hard working ideology that leads people to produce and entices people to consume with a vast amount of goods for the offering{{clarify|date=June 2015}}. Commodities are no longer just utilitarian but are fashionable, be they running shoes or sweat suits.<ref>{{cite book|last=Skoggard|first=Ian|title=Transnational Commodity Flows and the Global Phenomenon of the Brand|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=57\u201369}}</ref>\n\nThe change from anti-fashion to fashion because of the influence of western consumer-driven civilization can be seen in eastern Indonesia. The ikat textiles of the Ngada area of eastern Indonesia are changing because of modernization and development. Traditionally, in the Ngada area there was no idea similar to that of the Western idea of fashion, but anti-fashion in the form of traditional textiles and ways to adorn oneself were widely popular. Textiles in Indonesia have played many roles for the local people.  Textiles defined a person's rank and status; certain textiles indicated being part of the ruling class.  People expressed their ethnic identity and social hierarchy through textiles.  Because some Indonesians bartered ikat textiles for food, the textiles constituted economic goods, and as some textile design motifs had spiritual religious meanings, textiles were also a way to communicate religious messages.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=39\u201343}}</ref>\n\nIn eastern Indonesia, both the production and use of traditional textiles have been transformed as the production, use and value associated with textiles have changed due to modernization.  In the past, women produced the textiles either for home consumption or to trade with others.  Today, this has changed as most textiles are not being produced at home. Western goods are considered modern and are valued more than traditional goods, including the sarong, which retain a lingering association with [[colonialism]].  Now, sarongs are used only for rituals and ceremonial occasions, whereas western clothes are worn to church or government offices. Civil servants working in urban areas are more likely than peasants to make the distinction between western and traditional clothes. Following Indonesia's independence from the Dutch, people increasingly started buying factory made shirts and sarongs. In textile-producing areas the growing of cotton and production of naturally colored thread became obsolete. Traditional motifs on textiles are no longer considered the property of a certain social class or age group. Wives of government officials are promoting the use of traditional textiles in the form of western garments such as skirts, vests and blouses.  This trend is also being followed by the general populace, and whoever can afford to hire a tailor is doing so to stitch traditional ikat textiles into western clothes. Thus, traditional textiles are now fashion goods and are no longer confined to the black, white and brown colour palette but come in array of colours. Traditional textiles are also being used in interior decorations and to make handbags, wallets and other accessories, which are considered fashionable by civil servants and their families. There is also a booming tourist trade in the eastern Indonesian city of Kupang where international as well as domestic tourists are eager to purchase traditionally printed western goods.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|page=41 and 45\u201348}}</ref>\n\nThe use of traditional textiles for fashion is becoming big business in eastern Indonesia, but these traditional textiles are losing their ethnic identity markers and are being used as an item of fashion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnationa}}</ref>\n\n==Intellectual property==\nIn the fashion industry, [[intellectual property]] is not enforced as it is within the [[film industry]] and [[music industry]]. Robert Glariston, an intellectual property expert, mentioned in a fashion seminar held in LA{{which|date=March 2014}} that \"Copyright law regarding clothing is a current hot-button issue in the industry. We often have to draw the line between designers being inspired by a design and those outright stealing it in different places.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://outspoken.wpshower.com/2013/06/design-details-by-larger-companies-is-what-often/|title=Design details by larger companies is what often {{!}} Outspoken|website=outspoken.wpshower.com|access-date=2018-08-16}}</ref>  To take inspiration from others' designs contributes to the fashion industry's ability to establish clothing trends. For the past few years, [[WGSN (fashion forecaster)|WGSN]] has been a dominant source of fashion news and forecasts in encouraging fashion brands worldwide to be inspired by one another. Enticing consumers to buy clothing by establishing new trends is, some have argued, a key component of the industry's success. Intellectual property rules that interfere with this process of trend-making would, in this view, be counter-productive. On the other hand, it is often argued that the blatant theft of new ideas, unique designs, and design details by larger companies is what often contributes to the failure of many smaller or independent design companies.\n\nSince fakes are distinguishable by their poorer quality, there is still a demand for luxury goods, and as only a trademark or logo can be copyrighted, many fashion brands make this one of the most visible aspects of the garment or accessory. In handbags, especially, the designer's brand may be woven into the fabric (or the lining fabric) from which the bag is made, making the brand an intrinsic element of the bag.\n\nIn 2005, the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) held a conference calling for stricter intellectual property enforcement within the fashion industry to better protect small and medium businesses and promote competitiveness within the textile and clothing industries.<ref>[http://www.ipfrontline.com/depts/article.asp?id=7678&deptid=8 IPFrontline.com]

African-American influencers often have been known to start trends though modern day social media, and even in past years they have been able to reach others with their fashion and style.\n\n=== Modern Day Fashion ===\nCelebrities like [[Rihanna]], [[Lupita Nyong'o]], [[Zendaya]], and [[Michelle Obama]] have been a few of the many fashion idols in the black female community. For men, [[Pharrell Williams]], [[Kanye West]], and [[Ice Cube]] have also helped define modern day fashion for black men. Today's fashion scene is not just clothes, but also hair and makeup. Recent trends have included the embracing of natural hair, traditional clothing worn with modern clothing, or traditional patterns used in modern clothing styles. All of these trends come with the long existing and persevering movement of \"Black is Beautiful\".\n\n=== Early American Fashion ===\nIn the mid to end of the 1900s, African American style changed and developed with the times. Around the 1950s is really when the black community was able to create their own distinct styles. The term \"Sunday attire\" was coined,  communities emphasized \"Correct\" dress, it was especially important when \"stepping out\" for social occasions with community members, a habit that continues in the early 2000s.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/fashion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/african-american-dress|title=African American Dress {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref> Hair-dos and hairstyles also became a fashion statement, for example the \"conk\" which is hair that is slightly flattened and waved.<ref name=\":2\" /> Afros also emerged and they were often used to symbolize the rejection of white beauty standards at the time.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-illustrative-identity_n_6519244|title=An Illustrative Identity of Fashion and Style Throughout African-American History and Movements|date=2015-02-10|website=HuffPost|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref> Around the 1970s is when flashy costumes began to appear and black artists really started to define their presences through fashion. Around this time is also when movements started using fashion as one of their outlets.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Movements using Fashion ===\n\n==== Civil Rights Movement ====\nBlack activists and supporters used fashion to express their solidarity and support of this  civil rights movement. Supporters adorned symbolic clothing, accessories and hairstyles, usually native to Africa. Politics and fashion were fused together during this time and the use of these symbolic fashion statements sent a message to America and the rest of the world that African Americans were proud of their heritage.<ref name=\":3\" /> They aimed to send an even stronger message that black is beautiful and they were not afraid to embrace their identities.<ref name=\":3\" /> An example would the [[Kente cloth]], it is a brightly colored strip of cloth that is stitched and woven together to create different accessories.<ref name=\":3\" /> This woven cloth of brightly colored strips of fabric became a strong symbolic representation of pride in African identity for African Americans of the 1960s and later. It was developed into what is called a dashiki, a flowing, loose fitting, tunic style shirt. This cloth became one of the most notorious symbols of this revolution.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Self|first=Robert O.|last2=Bush|first2=Rod|date=2006-10-10|title=In Search of the Black Panther Party|doi=10.1215/9780822388326|isbn=9780822388326}}</ref>\n\n==== Black Panther Party ====\nThe Black Panther Party (BPP) was an essential piece of the Black Power movement that allowed members that were involved advocate for the African American race in different subjects like equality and politics.

In the years from 1970 to 1990, black designers and models were very successful, but as the 1990s came to an end, the fashion aesthetic changed and it did not include black models or designers.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=Scarlett L.|date=2017|title=Black Models Matter: Challenging the Racism of Aesthetics and the Facade of Inclusion in the Fashion Industry|url=|journal=CUNY Academic Works|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> In today's fashion, black models, influencers, and designers account for one of the smallest percentages of the industry.<ref name=\":6\" /> There are many theories about this lack of diversity, that it can be attributed to the economic differences usually associated with race and class, or it can reflect the differences in arts schooling given to mostly black populated schools, and also blatant racism.\n\n==== Statistics ====\nA report from New York Fashion (Spring 2015) week found that while 79.69% of models on the runway were white, only 9.75% of models were black, 7.67% were Asian, and 2.12% were Latina. The lack of diversity also accounts for not only designers but models too, out of four hundred and seventy members of The Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) only twelve of the members are black.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Benson|first=Samii Lashanta Kennedy|date=2017|title=Black Fashion Designers Matter: A qualitative Study exploring the experience of Black female Fashion design entrepreneurs|url=|journal=Iowa State University|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> From the same study on New York Fashion Week, it was shown that only 2.7% of the 260 designers presented were black men, and an even smaller percentage were black female designers.<ref name=\":7\" /> Even the relationship between independent designers and retailers can show the racial gap, only 1% of designers stocked at department stores being people of color. It was also found that in editorial spreads, over eighty percent of models pictured were white and only nine percent were black models. These numbers have stayed stagnant over the past few years.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Tokenism ====\nMany fashion designers have come under fire over the years for what is known as tokenism. Designer or editors will add one or two members on an underrepresented group to help them appear as inclusive and diverse, and to also help them give the illusion that they have equality.<ref name=\":6\" /> This idea of tokenism helps designers avoid accusations of racism, sexism, body shaming, etc.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== Cultural Appropriation ====\nThere are many examples of cultural appropriation in fashion. In many instances, designers can be found using aspects of culture inappropriately, in most cases taking traditional clothing from middle eastern, African, and Hispanic culture and adding it to their runway fashion.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gammage|first=Marquita Marie|date=2015-10-16|title=Representations of Black Women in the Media|doi=10.4324/9781315671550|isbn=9781315671550}}</ref> Some examples are  in a 2018 Gucci runway show, white models wore Sikh headdresses, causing a lot of backlash.

This created the distinctive Western outline of a tailored top worn over leggings or trousers.\n\nThe pace of change accelerated considerably in the following century, and women's and men's fashion, especially in the dressing and adorning of the hair, became equally complex. [[Art history|Art historians]] are, therefore ,able to use fashion with confidence and precision to date images, often to within five years, particularly in the case of images from the 15th century. Initially, changes in fashion led to a fragmentation across the upper classes of Europe of what had previously been a very similar style of dressing and the subsequent development of distinctive national styles. These national styles remained very different until a counter-movement in the 17th to 18th centuries imposed similar styles once again, mostly originating from [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] [[France]].<ref>Braudel, 317\u2013324</ref> Though the rich usually led fashion, the increasing affluence of [[early modern Europe]] led to the [[bourgeoisie]] and even peasants following trends at a distance, but still uncomfortably close for the elites \u2013 a factor that Fernand Braudel regards as one of the main motors of changing fashion.<ref>Braudel, 313\u2013315</ref>\n\n[[File:ADurerNuremburgVenetianWomen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s drawing contrasts a well turned out ''bourgeoise'' from [[Nuremberg]] (left) with her counterpart from Venice.

[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] illustrated the differences in his actual (or composite) contrast of Nuremberg and Venetian fashions at the close of the 15th century (''illustration, right''). The \"Spanish style\" of the late 16th century began the move back to synchronicity among upper-class Europeans, and after a struggle in the mid-17th century, French styles decisively took over leadership, a process completed in the 18th century.<ref>Braudel, 317\u2013321</ref>\n\nThough different textile colors and patterns changed from year to year,<ref>Thornton, Peter. ''Baroque and Rococo Silks''.</ref> the cut of a gentleman's coat and the length of his waistcoat, or the pattern to which a lady's dress was cut, changed more slowly. Men's fashions were primarily derived from military models, and changes in a European male silhouette were galvanized in theaters of European war where gentleman officers had opportunities to make notes of different styles such as the \"Steinkirk\" [[cravat]] or necktie.\n\n[[File:MA-Lebrun.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Marie Antoinette]], wife of Louis XVI, was a leader of fashion.

By 1800, all Western Europeans were dressing alike (or thought they were); local variation became first a sign of provincial culture and later a badge of the conservative peasant.<ref>James Laver and Fernand Braudel, op cit</ref>\n\nAlthough tailors and dressmakers were no doubt responsible for many innovations, and the textile industry indeed led many trends, the [[history of fashion design]] is generally understood to date from 1858 when the English-born [[Charles Frederick Worth]] opened the first authentic ''[[haute couture]]'' house in Paris. The Haute house was the name established by the government for the fashion houses that met the standards of the industry.  These fashion houses have to adhere to standards such as keeping at least twenty employees engaged in making the clothes, showing two collections per year at fashion shows, and presenting a certain number of patterns to costumers.<ref>Claire B.

[[Fashion week]]s are held in these cities, where designers exhibit their new clothing collections to audiences.  A succession of major designers such as [[Coco Chanel]] and [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint-Laurent]] have kept Paris as the center most watched by the rest of the world, although ''haute couture'' is now subsidized by the sale of [[ready-to-wear]] collections and perfume using the same branding.\n\nModern [[Western culture|West]]erners have a vast number of choices available in the selection of their clothes. What a person chooses to wear can reflect his or her personality or interests. When people who have high cultural [[Social status|status]] start to wear new or different clothes, a fashion trend may start. People who like or respect these people become influenced by their style and begin wearing similarly styled clothes. Fashions may vary considerably within a society according to age, [[social class]], generation, occupation, and geography and may also vary over time. If an older person dresses according to the fashion young people use, he or she may look ridiculous in the eyes of both young and older people. The terms ''fashionista'' and ''[[fashion victim]]'' refer to someone who slavishly follows current fashions.\n\nOne can regard the system of sporting various fashions as a fashion language incorporating various fashion statements using a grammar of fashion. (Compare some of the work of [[Roland Barthes]].)\n\nIn recent years, Asian fashion has become increasingly significant in local and global markets. Countries such as China, Japan, India, and Pakistan have traditionally had large textile industries, which have often been drawn upon by Western designers, but now Asian clothing styles are also gaining influence based on their ideas.<ref>Lemire, B., & Riello, G (2008). \"East & West: Textiles and Fashion in Early Modern Europe\".

It was handmade for individuals, either as home production or on order from dressmakers and tailors. By the beginning of the 20th century\u2014with the rise of new technologies such as the [[sewing machine]], the rise of global capitalism and the development of the factory system of production, and the proliferation of retail outlets such as department stores\u2014clothing had increasingly come to be [[mass production|mass-produced]] in standard sizes and sold at fixed prices.\n\nAlthough the fashion industry developed first in Europe and America, {{as of | 2017 | lc = on}}, it is an international and highly globalized industry, with clothing often designed in one country, manufactured in another, and sold worldwide. For example, an American fashion company might source fabric in China and have the clothes manufactured in Vietnam, finished in Italy, and shipped to a warehouse in the United States for distribution to retail outlets internationally. The fashion industry has long been one of the largest employers in the United States,<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry#toc296474</ref> and it remains so in the 21st century. However, U.S. employment declined considerably as production increasingly moved overseas, especially to China. Because data on the fashion industry typically are reported for national economies and expressed in terms of the industry's many separate sectors, aggregate figures for the world [[textile industry|production of textiles]] and [[Clothing industry|clothing]] are difficult to obtain. However, by any measure, the clothing industry accounts for a significant share of world economic output.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/cheap-clothes-2012-6/|title=How Bargain Fashion Chains Will Keep Themselves Cut-Rate -- New York Magazine|work=NYMag.com|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref>\nThe fashion industry consists of four levels:\n\n# The production of raw materials, principally Fiber ,and textiles but also leather and fur.\n#The production of fashion goods by designers, manufacturers, contractors, and others.\n# Retail sales.\n# Various forms of advertising and promotion.\n\nThese levels consist of many separate but interdependent sectors. These sectors are Textile Design and Production, [[Fashion Design]] and Manufacturing, Fashion Retailing, Marketing and Merchandising, [[Fashion Show]]s, and Media and Marketing. Each sector is devoted to the goal of satisfying consumer demand for apparel under conditions that enable participants in the industry to operate at a profit.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry/296476/Fashion-design-and-manufacturing, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry/296477/Fashion-retailing-marketing-and-merchandising, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry/296479/Media-and-marketing</ref>\n\n== Fashion trend ==\n{{main|Fashion trend|2010s in fashion}}\nFashion trends influenced by several factors , including cinema, celebrities, climate, creative explorations, political, economic , social ,and technological. Examining these factors is called a [[PEST analysis]]. Fashion forecasters can use this information to help determine the growth or decline of a particular trend.\n\n=== Political influences ===\n[[File:Shinz\u014d Abe and Ivanka Trump (4).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ivanka Trump]] (right) along with [[Japanese Prime Minister|Japanese PM]] [[Shinz\u014d Abe]] wearing Western-style [[business suit]]s, 2017]]\n\nDid not only political events make a Significant impact on fashion trends, but also the political figure played a critical role in forecasting the fashion trend. For example, First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] was a fashionable icon of the early 1960s who led the formal dressing trend. By wearing a Chanel suit, a structural Givenchy shift dress ,or a soft color Cassini coat with Large buttons, it created her elegant look and led a delicate trend.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5J3PDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA52#v=onepage&q=First%20Lady%20Jacqueline%20Kennedy%20was%20a%20fashionable%20icon%20of%20the%20early%201960s|title=Women in Fashion|last=Rissman|first=Rebecca|date=2016-08-15|publisher=ABDO|isbn=9781680774856}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the political revolution also made much impact on the fashion trend. For example, during the 1960s, the economy had become wealthier, the divorce rate was increasing ,and the government approved the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]. This revolution inspired the younger generation to rebellion. In 1964, the leg-baring mini-skirt became a significant  fashion trend of the 1960s. Given that fashion designers began to experiment with the shapes of garment, loose sleeveless, micro-minis, flared skirts, and trumpet sleeves. In this case, the mini-skirt trend became an icon of the 1960s.\n\nMoreover, the political movement built an impressive relationship with fashion trends. For instance, during the Vietnam war, the youth of America made a movement that affected the whole country. In the 1960s, the fashion trend was full of fluorescent colors, prints patterns, bell-bottom jeans, fringed vests, and skirt became a protest outfit of the 1960s. This trend was called Hippie , and it is still affecting the current fashion trend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://classroom.synonym.com/political-economic-factors-influenced-fashion-1960s-12014.html|title=Political & Economic Factors That Influenced Fashion in the 1960s {{!}} The Classroom {{!}} Synonym|website=classroom.synonym.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Technology influences ===\n\nTechnology plays a significant role in most aspects of today's society. Technological influences are growing more apparent in the fashion industry. Advances and new developments are shaping and creating current and future trends.\n\nDevelopments such as wearable technology have become an essential trend in fashion. They will  continue with advances such as clothing constructed with solar panels that charge devices and [[E-textiles|smart fabrics]] that enhance wearer comfort by changing color or texture based on environmental changes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://apparel.edgl.com/news/Top-6-Tech-Trends-in-the-Fashion-Industry94135|title=Top 6 Tech Trends in the Fashion Industry|last=Communications|first=Edgell|website=apparel.edgl.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref>\n\nThe fashion industry is seeing how [[3D printing]] technology has influenced designers such as [[Iris van Herpen|Iris Van Herpen]] and [[Kimberly Ovitz]].

The camouflage pattern in clothing was developed to help military personnel be less visible to enemy forces.  A trend emerged in the 1960s , and camouflage fabric was introduced to streetwear. The camouflage fabric trend disappeared and resurfaced several times since then.

People have also become more conscious of the impact their everyday consumption has on the environment and society, and these initiatives are often described as a move towards [[sustainable fashion]], yet critics argue a circular economy based on growth is an oxymoron, or an increasing spiral of consumption, rather than a utopian [[Cradle-to-cradle design|cradle-to-cradle]] circular solution.\n\nIn today's linear economical system, manufacturers extract resources from the earth to make products that will soon be discarded in landfills, on the other hand, under the [[Circular economy|circular]] model, the production of goods operates like systems in nature, where the waste and demise of a substance becomes the food and source of growth for something new. Companies such as MUD Jeans, which is based in the Netherlands employs a leasing scheme for jeans. This Dutch company \"represents a new consuming philosophy that is about using instead of owning,\" according to MUD's website. The concept also protects the company from volatile cotton prices. Consumers pay \u20ac7.50 a month for a pair of jeans; after a year, they can return the jeans to Mud,  trade them for a new pair and start another year-long lease, or keep them. MUD is responsible for any repairs during the lease period.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another ethical fashion company, [[Patagonia (clothing)|Patagonia]] set up the first multi-seller branded store on EBay in order to facilitate secondhand sales; consumers who take the Common Threads pledge can sell in this store and have their gear listed on Patagonia.com's \"Used Gear\" section.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== China's domestic spending ====\nConsumption as a share of gross domestic product in China has fallen for six decades, from 76 percent in 1952 to 28 percent in 2011.

Another difference is how gratification and idea shopping influence spending over \u00a51k per month on fashion items, and regular spending influenced by value shopping.\n\n=== Marketing ===\n[[File:Petite Panoply- Trip to Cumberland Island, Georgia (20775335400).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A tourist couple wearing [[casual attire|casual]] clothes at [[Cumberland Island]], 2015]]\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=250\n| image1 = Chinese model posing as CEO (6759428801).jpg\n| image2 = LG\uc5d1\uc2a4\ub178\ud2b8 X300\u2019\uc758 CF \ub9e4\uc9c1(Magic)\ud3b8 (cropped).jpg\n| footer = Models posing in [[Informal attire|corporate office wear]].\n}}\n\n====Market research====\nConsumers of different groups have varying needs and demands. Factors taken into consideration when thinking of consumers' needs include key demographics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/consumer-needs-marketing-997.html|title=Consumer Needs & Marketing|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref>\nTo understand consumers' needs and predict fashion trends, fashion companies have to do [[market research]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://strategyn.com/customer-needs/|title=Strategyn|website=Strategyn|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref> There are two research methods: primary and secondary.<ref name=\"Consumer Research Methods\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.consumerpsychologist.com/cb_Research_Methods.html|title=Consumer Research Methods|website=www.consumerpsychologist.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref> Secondary methods are taking other information that has already been collected, for example using a book or an article for research. Primary research is collecting data through surveys, interviews, observation, and/or focus groups. Primary research often focuses on large sample sizes to determine customer's motivations to shop.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Christopher J.|last2=Wenyu|first2=Lu|date=2019-05-13|title=What influences Chinese fashion retail? Shopping motivations, demographics and spending|url=https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JFMM-09-2017-0093/full/html|journal=Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management: An International Journal|language=en|volume=23|issue=2|pages=158\u2013175|doi=10.1108/JFMM-09-2017-0093|issn=1361-2026}}</ref>\n\nBenefits of primary research is specific information about a fashion brand's consumer is explored. Surveys are helpful tools; questions can be open-ended or closed-ended. A negative factor surveys and interviews present is that the answers can be biased, due to wording in the survey or on face-to-face interactions.  Focus groups, about 8 to 12 people, can be beneficial because several points can be addressed in depth. However, there are drawbacks to this tactic, too. With such a small sample size, it is hard to know if the greater public would react the same way as the focus group.<ref name=\"Consumer Research Methods\"/> Observation can really help a company gain insight on what a consumer truly wants. There is less of a bias because consumers are just performing their daily tasks, not necessarily realizing they are being observed. For example, observing the public by taking street style photos of people, the consumer did not get dressed in the morning knowing that would have their photo taken necessarily. They just wear what they would normally wear. Through observation patterns can be seen, helping trend forecasters know what their target market needs and wants.\n\nKnowing the needs of the consumers will increase a fashion companies' sales and profits. Through research and studying the consumers' lives the needs of the customer can be obtained and help fashion brands know what trends the consumers are ready for.\n\n====Symbolic consumption====\nConsumption is driven not only by need, the symbolic meaning for consumers is also a factor. Consumers engaging in symbolic consumption may develop a sense of self over an extended period of time as various objects are collected as part of the process of establishing their identity and, when the symbolic meaning is shared in a social group, to communicate their identity to others. For teenagers consumption plays a role in distinguishing the child self from the adult. Researchers have found that the fashion choices of teenagers are used for self-expression and also to recognize other teens who wear similar clothes. The symbolic association of clothing items can link individuals personality and interests, with music as a prominent factor influencing fashion decisions.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Piacentini |first1=Maria |title=Symbolic consumption in teenagers' clothing choices |journal=Journal of Consumer Behavior |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=251-262}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n[[File:Tanzturnier 28.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Latin dance]]rs in their [[costume]]s. The woman is wearing [[backless dress]] with deep slits on its lower portion, while the man is wearing a shirt with top buttons open.]]\n\nThe media plays a significant role when it comes to fashion. For instance, an important part of fashion is [[fashion journalism]]. Editorial critique, guidelines, and commentary can be found on television and in magazines, newspapers, fashion websites, social networks, and [[fashion blog]]s. In recent years, fashion blogging and [[YouTube]] videos have become a major outlet for spreading trends and fashion tips, creating an online culture of sharing one's style on a website or Instagram account. Through these media outlets readers and viewers all over the world can learn about fashion, making it very accessible.<ref>Fashion (2012, March 29). Wwd. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news</ref> In addition to fashion journalism, another media platform that is important in fashion industry is advertisement. Advertisements provide information to audiences and promote the sales of products and services. Fashion industry utilizes advertisements to attract consumers and promote its products to generate sales. Few decades ago when technology was still underdeveloped, advertisements heavily relied on radio, magazines, billboards, and newspapers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://smallbusiness.chron.com/examples-traditional-advertising-24312.html|title=Examples of Traditional Advertising|last=Lauren|first=Lynn|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> These days, there are more various ways in advertisements such as television ads, online-based ads using internet websites, and posts, videos, and live streaming in social media platforms.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, fashion magazines began to include photographs of various fashion designs and became even more influential than in the past.<ref>{{Citation|publisher=Fairchild Publications|isbn=9781501303869|doi=10.5040/9781501303869.ch-014|title = Marketing Fashion|year = 2012|chapter = Fashion Advertising, Sales Promotion, and Public Relations}}</ref> In cities throughout the world these magazines were greatly sought after and had a profound effect on public taste in clothing. Talented illustrators drew exquisite fashion plates for the publications which covered the most recent developments in fashion and beauty. Perhaps the most famous of these magazines was ''[[La Gazette du Bon Ton]]'', which was founded in 1912 by Lucien Vogel and regularly published until 1925 (with the exception of the war years).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abebooks.com/books/features/lithographs/gazette-du-bon-ton.shtml|title=Gazette du Bon Ton: A Journal of Good Taste|website=www.abebooks.com|access-date=2018-07-04}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Crystal Couture Fashion Show & Sale (32801142162).jpg|thumb|upright|A [[See-through clothing|see-through]] top worn along with [[pasties]] by a model at a [[fashion show]] in USA, 2017. Such [[fashion trend]]s get popularised through media.]]\n''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', founded in the United States in 1892, has been the longest-lasting and most successful of the hundreds of fashion magazines that have come and gone. Increasing affluence after [[World War&nbsp;II]] and, most importantly, the advent of cheap color printing in the 1960s, led to a huge boost in its sales and heavy coverage of fashion in mainstream women's magazines, followed by men's magazines in the 1990s. One such example of ''Vogue'''s popularity is the younger version, ''[[Teen Vogue]]'', which covers clothing and trends that are targeted more toward the \"fashionista on a budget\". [[Haute couture]] designers followed the trend by starting [[ready-to-wear]] and [[perfume]] lines which are heavily advertised in the magazines and now dwarf their original couture businesses. A recent development within fashion print media is the rise of text-based and critical magazines which aim to prove that fashion is not superficial, by creating a dialogue between fashion academia and the industry. Examples of this trend are: ''[[Fashion Theory (journal)|Fashion Theory]]'' (1997)  and ''[[Vestoj]]'' (2009). Television coverage began in the 1950s with small fashion features. In the 1960s and 1970s, fashion segments on various entertainment shows became more frequent, and by the 1980s, dedicated fashion shows such as ''[[Fashion Television]]'' started to appear. ''[[FashionTV]]'' was the pioneer in this undertaking and has since grown to become the leader in both Fashion Television and new media channels. The Fashion Industry is beginning to promote their styles through Bloggers on social media's. Vogue specified Chiara Ferragni as \"blogger of the moment\" due to the rises of followers through her Fashion Blog, that became popular.<ref>Fateh, Azhar. \u201cHow Social Media Is Changing Fashion?\u201d The Huffington Post, TheHuffingtonPost.com, 19 Jan. 2017, Retrieved From www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-social-media-is-changing-fashion_us_587edd29e4b06a0baf64918f.</ref>\n\nA few days after the 2010 Fall Fashion Week in New York City came to a close, ''[[The New Islander]]'''s Fashion Editor, Genevieve Tax, criticized the fashion industry for running on a seasonal schedule of its own, largely at the expense of real-world consumers. \"Because designers release their fall collections in the spring and their spring collections in the fall, fashion magazines such as ''Vogue'' always and only look forward to the upcoming season, promoting parkas come September while issuing reviews on shorts in January\", she writes. \"Savvy shoppers, consequently, have been conditioned to be extremely, perhaps impractically, farsighted with their buying.\"<ref>Tax, Genevieve.

Specific fashion brands have been featured in film, not only as [[product placement]] opportunities, but as bespoke items that have subsequently led to trends in fashion.<ref>Thompson, S.B.N., Hussein, Y., Jones, N.

This is evident not only from television shows directly spotlighting the fashion industry, but also movies, events and music videos which showcase fashion statements as well as promote specific brands through product placements.\n\n=== Controversial advertisements in fashion industry ===\n\n==== Racism in fashion advertisements ====\nThere are some fashion advertisements that were accused of racism and led to boycotts from the customers. Globally known, Swedish fashion brand H&M faced this issue with one of its children's wear advertisements in 2018. A black child wearing a hoodie with a slogan written as \"coolest monkey in the jungle\" right at the center was featured in the ad. When it was released, it immediate became controversial and even led to boycott. A lot of people including celebrities posted on social media about their resentments towards H&M and refusal to work with and buy its products. H&M issued a statement saying \"we apologise to anyone this may have offended\", which seemed insincere to some.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/hm-hoodie-racist-boycott-advertising-people-h-m-a8149246.html|title=People are boycotting H&M over 'racist' hoodie|date=2018-01-09|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> \nAnother fashion advertisement regarding racism is from GAP, American worldwide clothing brand. GAP collaborated with Ellen DeGeneres in 2016 for the advertisement. It features playful, four young girls where tall white girl is leaning with her arm on a shorter black girl's head. When this ad was released, some viewers harshly criticized that it underlies passive racism. A representative from The Root, black culture magazine commented on the ad that it portrays the message that the black people are undervalued and seen like props for white people to look better.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-35968787|title=Is this Gap advert racist?|date=2016-04-06|access-date=2019-10-29|language=en-GB}}</ref> There were different points of views on this issue, some saying that people are being too sensitive, and some getting offended. Regardless of various views and thoughts, GAP replaced the ad to different image and apologized to critics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/273593|title=Gap Apologizes for 'Racist' Ad|last=Kell|first=John|date=2016-04-05|website=Entrepreneur|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref>\n\n==== Sexism in fashion advertisements ====\nMany fashion brands have published ads that were too provocative and sexy to attract customers\u2019 attention. British high fashion brand, Jimmy Choo, was blamed for having sexism in its ad which featured a female British mode wearing the brand's boots. In this two-minute ad, men whistle at a model, walking on the street with red, sleeveless mini dress. This ad gained lots of backlashes and criticism by the viewers since sexual harassment and misconduct was a huge issue during this time and even till now. Many people showed their dismay through social media posts, leading Jimmy Choo to pull down the ad from social media platforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mashable.com/2017/12/22/jimmy-choo-cara-delevingne-catcall-ad/|title=Jimmy Choo pulls Cara Delevingne ad after online backlash|last=Gallucci|first=Nicole|website=Mashable|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref>\n\nFrench luxury fashion brand Yves Saint Laurent also faced this issue with its print ad shown in Paris in 2017. A female model is wearing a fishnet tights with roller-skate stilettos, almost lying down with her legs opened in front of the camera. This advertisement brought harsh comments from the viewers and French advertising organization directors for going against the advertising codes related to \"respect for decency, dignity and those prohibiting submission, violence or dependence, as well as the use of stereotypes.\" They even said that this ad is causing \"mental harm to adolescents.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adage.com/article/advertising/degrading-yves-saint-laurent-ads-shock-french-public/308196|title='Misogynist' YSL Ads Shock Parisians Ahead of International Women's Day|date=2017-03-07|website=adage.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> Lot of sarcastic comments were made in social media about the ad and the poster was removed from the city.\n\n==Public relations and social media==\n[[File:Ines Sainz.jpg|thumb|upright|A Mexican sports reporter wearing [[little black dress]] and knee-high boots]]\n\nFashion [[public relations]] involves being in touch with a company's audiences and creating strong relationships with them, reaching out to media and initiating messages that project positive images of the company.<ref>Sherman, G., & Perlman, S.

A certain way is chosen and that becomes the fashion as defined by a certain people as a whole, so if a particular style has a meaning in an already occurring set of beliefs that style will become fashion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=39\u201355 [42]}}</ref> According to Ted Polhemus and Lynn Procter, fashion can be described as adornment, of which there are two types: fashion and anti-fashion. Through the capitalization and commoditisation of clothing, accessories, and shoes, etc., what once constituted anti-fashion becomes part of fashion as the lines between fashion and anti-fashion are blurred.<ref>{{cite book|last=Polhemus and Procter|first=Ted and Lynn|title=Fashion and Anti-fashion: An Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment|year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|page=12}}</ref>\n\nThe definition of fashion and [[anti-fashion]] is as follows:  Anti-fashion is fixed and changes little over time.  Anti-fashion is different depending on the cultural or social group one is associated with or where one lives, but within that group or locality the style changes little.  Fashion is the exact opposite of anti-fashion.  Fashion changes very quickly and is not affiliated with one group or area of the world but is spread out throughout the world wherever people can communicate easily with each other. For example, Queen Elizabeth II's 1953 coronation gown is an example of anti-fashion because it is traditional and does not change over any period whereas a gown from fashion designer Dior's collection of 1953 is fashion because the style will change every season as Dior comes up with a new gown to replace the old one. In the Dior gown the length, cut, fabric, and embroidery of the gown change from season to season.  Anti-fashion is concerned with maintaining the status quo while fashion is concerned with social mobility. Time is expressed in terms of continuity in anti-fashion and as change in fashion. Fashion has changing modes of adornment while anti-fashion has fixed modes of adornment. Indigenous and peasant modes of adornment are an example of anti-fashion. Change in fashion is part of the larger system and is structured to be a deliberate change in style.<ref>{{cite book|last=Polhemus and Procter|first=Ted and Lynn|title=Fashion and Anti-fashion: An Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment|year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|pages=12\u201313}}</ref>\n\nToday, people in rich countries are linked to people in poor countries through the commoditization and consumption of what is called fashion.  People work long hours in one area of the globe to produce things that people in another part of the globe are anxious to consume. An example of this is the chain of production and consumption of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoes, which are produced in Taiwan and then purchased in North America. At the production end, there is nation-building a hard working ideology that leads people to produce and entices people to consume with a vast amount of goods for the offering{{clarify|date=June 2015}}. Commodities are no longer just utilitarian but are fashionable, be they running shoes or sweat suits.<ref>{{cite book|last=Skoggard|first=Ian|title=Transnational Commodity Flows and the Global Phenomenon of the Brand|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=57\u201369}}</ref>\n\nThe change from anti-fashion to fashion because of the influence of western consumer-driven civilization can be seen in eastern Indonesia. The ikat textiles of the Ngada area of eastern Indonesia are changing because of modernization and development. Traditionally, in the Ngada area there was no idea similar to that of the Western idea of fashion, but anti-fashion in the form of traditional textiles and ways to adorn oneself were widely popular. Textiles in Indonesia have played many roles for the local people.  Textiles defined a person's rank and status; certain textiles indicated being part of the ruling class.  People expressed their ethnic identity and social hierarchy through textiles.  Because some Indonesians bartered ikat textiles for food, the textiles constituted economic goods, and as some textile design motifs had spiritual religious meanings, textiles were also a way to communicate religious messages.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=39\u201343}}</ref>\n\nIn eastern Indonesia, both the production and use of traditional textiles have been transformed as the production, use and value associated with textiles have changed due to modernization.  In the past, women produced the textiles either for home consumption or to trade with others.  Today, this has changed as most textiles are not being produced at home. Western goods are considered modern and are valued more than traditional goods, including the sarong, which retain a lingering association with [[colonialism]].  Now, sarongs are used only for rituals and ceremonial occasions, whereas western clothes are worn to church or government offices. Civil servants working in urban areas are more likely than peasants to make the distinction between western and traditional clothes. Following Indonesia's independence from the Dutch, people increasingly started buying factory made shirts and sarongs. In textile-producing areas the growing of cotton and production of naturally colored thread became obsolete. Traditional motifs on textiles are no longer considered the property of a certain social class or age group. Wives of government officials are promoting the use of traditional textiles in the form of western garments such as skirts, vests and blouses.  This trend is also being followed by the general populace, and whoever can afford to hire a tailor is doing so to stitch traditional ikat textiles into western clothes. Thus, traditional textiles are now fashion goods and are no longer confined to the black, white and brown colour palette but come in array of colours. Traditional textiles are also being used in interior decorations and to make handbags, wallets and other accessories, which are considered fashionable by civil servants and their families. There is also a booming tourist trade in the eastern Indonesian city of Kupang where international as well as domestic tourists are eager to purchase traditionally printed western goods.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|page=41 and 45\u201348}}</ref>\n\nThe use of traditional textiles for fashion is becoming big business in eastern Indonesia, but these traditional textiles are losing their ethnic identity markers and are being used as an item of fashion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnationa}}</ref>\n\n==Intellectual property==\nIn the fashion industry, [[intellectual property]] is not enforced as it is within the [[film industry]] and [[music industry]]. Robert Glariston, an intellectual property expert, mentioned in a fashion seminar held in LA{{which|date=March 2014}} that \"Copyright law regarding clothing is a current hot-button issue in the industry. We often have to draw the line between designers being inspired by a design and those outright stealing it in different places.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://outspoken.wpshower.com/2013/06/design-details-by-larger-companies-is-what-often/|title=Design details by larger companies is what often {{!}} Outspoken|website=outspoken.wpshower.com|access-date=2018-08-16}}</ref>  To take inspiration from others' designs contributes to the fashion industry's ability to establish clothing trends. For the past few years, [[WGSN (fashion forecaster)|WGSN]] has been a dominant source of fashion news and forecasts in encouraging fashion brands worldwide to be inspired by one another. Enticing consumers to buy clothing by establishing new trends is, some have argued, a key component of the industry's success. Intellectual property rules that interfere with this process of trend-making would, in this view, be counter-productive. On the other hand, it is often argued that the blatant theft of new ideas, unique designs, and design details by larger companies is what often contributes to the failure of many smaller or independent design companies.\n\nSince fakes are distinguishable by their poorer quality, there is still a demand for luxury goods, and as only a trademark or logo can be copyrighted, many fashion brands make this one of the most visible aspects of the garment or accessory. In handbags, especially, the designer's brand may be woven into the fabric (or the lining fabric) from which the bag is made, making the brand an intrinsic element of the bag.\n\nIn 2005, the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) held a conference calling for stricter intellectual property enforcement within the fashion industry to better protect small and medium businesses and promote competitiveness within the textile and clothing industries.<ref>[http://www.ipfrontline.com/depts/article.asp?id=7678&deptid=8 IPFrontline.com]

African-American influencers often have been known to start trends though modern day social media, and even in past years they have been able to reach others with their fashion and style.\n\n=== Modern Day Fashion ===\nCelebrities like [[Rihanna]], [[Lupita Nyong'o]], [[Zendaya]], and [[Michelle Obama]] have been a few of the many fashion idols in the black female community. For men, [[Pharrell Williams]], [[Kanye West]], and [[Ice Cube]] have also helped define modern day fashion for black men. Today's fashion scene is not just clothes, but also hair and makeup. Recent trends have included the embracing of natural hair, traditional clothing worn with modern clothing, or traditional patterns used in modern clothing styles. All of these trends come with the long existing and persevering movement of \"Black is Beautiful\".\n\n=== Early American Fashion ===\nIn the mid to end of the 1900s, African American style changed and developed with the times. Around the 1950s is really when the black community was able to create their own distinct styles. The term \"Sunday attire\" was coined,  communities emphasized \"Correct\" dress, it was especially important when \"stepping out\" for social occasions with community members, a habit that continues in the early 2000s.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/fashion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/african-american-dress|title=African American Dress {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref> Hair-dos and hairstyles also became a fashion statement, for example the \"conk\" which is hair that is slightly flattened and waved.<ref name=\":2\" /> Afros also emerged and they were often used to symbolize the rejection of white beauty standards at the time.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-illustrative-identity_n_6519244|title=An Illustrative Identity of Fashion and Style Throughout African-American History and Movements|date=2015-02-10|website=HuffPost|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref> Around the 1970s is when flashy costumes began to appear and black artists really started to define their presences through fashion. Around this time is also when movements started using fashion as one of their outlets.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Movements using Fashion ===\n\n==== Civil Rights Movement ====\nBlack activists and supporters used fashion to express their solidarity and support of this  civil rights movement. Supporters adorned symbolic clothing, accessories and hairstyles, usually native to Africa. Politics and fashion were fused together during this time and the use of these symbolic fashion statements sent a message to America and the rest of the world that African Americans were proud of their heritage.<ref name=\":3\" /> They aimed to send an even stronger message that black is beautiful and they were not afraid to embrace their identities.<ref name=\":3\" /> An example would the [[Kente cloth]], it is a brightly colored strip of cloth that is stitched and woven together to create different accessories.<ref name=\":3\" /> This woven cloth of brightly colored strips of fabric became a strong symbolic representation of pride in African identity for African Americans of the 1960s and later. It was developed into what is called a dashiki, a flowing, loose fitting, tunic style shirt. This cloth became one of the most notorious symbols of this revolution.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Self|first=Robert O.|last2=Bush|first2=Rod|date=2006-10-10|title=In Search of the Black Panther Party|doi=10.1215/9780822388326|isbn=9780822388326}}</ref>\n\n==== Black Panther Party ====\nThe Black Panther Party (BPP) was an essential piece of the Black Power movement that allowed members that were involved advocate for the African American race in different subjects like equality and politics. The BPP members wore a very distinctive uniform: a black leather jacket, black pants, light blue shirts, a black beret, an afro, dark sunglasses, and usually a fist in the air.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Cleaver|first=Kathleen|date=2014-04-08|title=Liberation, Imagination and the Black Panther Party|doi=10.4324/9780203950920|isbn=9780203950920}}</ref> Their image gave off a very militant like feel to it. This notable uniform was established in 1996, but a different uniform was still in place before; just the sunglasses and leather jackets.<ref name=\":5\" /> Each member wore this uniform at events, rallies, and in their day-today life. Very few members changed the essential parts of the outfit, but some added personal touches such as necklaces or other jewelry that was usually were a part of African culture.<ref name=\":4\" /> The Black Panther uniform did  succeeded in intimidating enemies and onlookers and clearly sent a message of black pride and power even though the initial intention of this party was to communicate solidarity among the Black Panther Party members.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Colorism in Fashion ===\nSince the 1970s, fashion models of color, especially black men and women, have experienced an increase in discrimination in the fashion industry. In the years from 1970 to 1990, black designers and models were very successful, but as the 1990s came to an end, the fashion aesthetic changed and it did not include black models or designers.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=Scarlett L.|date=2017|title=Black Models Matter: Challenging the Racism of Aesthetics and the Facade of Inclusion in the Fashion Industry|url=|journal=CUNY Academic Works|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> In today's fashion, black models, influencers, and designers account for one of the smallest percentages of the industry.<ref name=\":6\" /> There are many theories about this lack of diversity, that it can be attributed to the economic differences usually associated with race and class, or it can reflect the differences in arts schooling given to mostly black populated schools, and also blatant racism.\n\n==== Statistics ====\nA report from New York Fashion (Spring 2015) week found that while 79.69% of models on the runway were white, only 9.75% of models were black, 7.67% were Asian, and 2.12% were Latina. The lack of diversity also accounts for not only designers but models too, out of four hundred and seventy members of The Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) only twelve of the members are black.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Benson|first=Samii Lashanta Kennedy|date=2017|title=Black Fashion Designers Matter: A qualitative Study exploring the experience of Black female Fashion design entrepreneurs|url=|journal=Iowa State University|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> From the same study on New York Fashion Week, it was shown that only 2.7% of the 260 designers presented were black men, and an even smaller percentage were black female designers.<ref name=\":7\" /> Even the relationship between independent designers and retailers can show the racial gap, only 1% of designers stocked at department stores being people of color. It was also found that in editorial spreads, over eighty percent of models pictured were white and only nine percent were black models. These numbers have stayed stagnant over the past few years.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Tokenism ====\nMany fashion designers have come under fire over the years for what is known as tokenism. Designer or editors will add one or two members on an underrepresented group to help them appear as inclusive and diverse, and to also help them give the illusion that they have equality.<ref name=\":6\" /> This idea of tokenism helps designers avoid accusations of racism, sexism, body shaming, etc.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== Cultural Appropriation ====\nThere are many examples of cultural appropriation in fashion. In many instances, designers can be found using aspects of culture inappropriately, in most cases taking traditional clothing from middle eastern, African, and Hispanic culture and adding it to their runway fashion.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gammage|first=Marquita Marie|date=2015-10-16|title=Representations of Black Women in the Media|doi=10.4324/9781315671550|isbn=9781315671550}}</ref> Some examples are  in a 2018 Gucci runway show, white models wore Sikh headdresses, causing a lot of backlash.

[[Folate]] levels in the individual may affect the course of pathological changes and symptomatology of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.  \n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Definition==\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin essential to the function of all cells. Cobalamins are characterized by a [[porphyrin]]-like [[corrin]] nucleus that contains a single [[cobalt]] atom bound to a [[benzimidazole|benzimidazolyl]] [[nucleotide]] and a variable residue (R) group. The vitamin exists as a family of [[vitamer]]s defined as a number of chemical compounds having a similar molecular structure, each of which shows vitamin activity in a vitamin-deficient biological system. [[Adenosylcobalamin]] (AdoB<sub>12</sub>) and [[methylcobalamin]] (MeB<sub>12</sub>) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body, the first in mitochondria and the second in cell cytosol. AdoB<sub>12</sub> has a 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl group linked to the cobalt atom at the core of the molecule; MeB<sub>12</sub> has a methyl group at that location.\n\n[[Cyanocobalamin]] is a manufactured form with a cyano ([[cyanide]]) group bound to cobalt. Bacterial fermentation creates AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub> which are converted to cyanocobalamin by addition of potassium cyanide in the presence of sodium nitrite and heat. Once consumed, cyanocobalamin is converted to the biologically active AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub>. Cyanocobalamin is the most common form used in dietary supplements and [[food fortification]] because cyanide stabilizes the molecule from degradation. However, methylcobalamin is also offered as a dietary supplement. [[Hydroxocobalamin]] has a hydroxyl group attached to the cobalt atom. It can be injected intramuscularly to treat Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Injected intravenously, it is used to treat cyanide poisoning, as the hydroxyl group is displaced by cyanide, creating a non-toxic cyanocobalamin that is excreted in urine. \"Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub>\" refers to compounds that are [[corrinoid]]s with structure similar to the vitamin but without vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe2018>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Bito T |title=Determination of Cobalamin and Related Compounds in Foods |journal=J AOAC Int |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=1308\u20131313 |date=September 2018 |pmid=29669618 |doi=10.5740/jaoacint.18-0045 |url=}}</ref> Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub> is the majority corrinoid in [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]], an algal health food sometimes erroneously claimed as having this vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe1999>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Katsura H, Takenaka S, Fujita T, Abe K, Tamura Y, Nakatsuka T, Nakano Y |title=Pseudovitamin B(12) is the predominant cobamide of an algal health food, spirulina tablets |journal=J.

The [[hydrogenase]]s and, by necessity, enzymes associated with cobalt utilization, involve metal-carbon bonds.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bioorganometallics: Biomolecules, Labeling, Medicine | veditors = Jaouen G | url = https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Bioorganometallics%3A+Biomolecules%2C+Labeling%2C+Medicine-p-9783527309900 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2006 |isbn=978-3-527-30990-0}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>\n\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> is a generic descriptor name referring to a collection of [[cobalt]] and [[corrin ring]] molecules, which are defined by their particular vitamin function in the body. All of the substrate cobalt-corrin molecules from which B<sub>12</sub> is made must be synthesized by bacteria. After this synthesis is complete, the human body has the ability to convert cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin to an active form, by means of enzymatically removing certain prosthetic chemical groups from the cobalt atom and replacing them with others.\n[[File:Cobalamin-general-structure-color.png|thumb|The structures of the four most common vitamers of cobalamin, together with some synonyms. The structure of the 5'-deoxyadenosyl group, which forms the R group of adensoylcobalamin is also shown.]]\n\n===Vitamers===\nThe four vitamers of B<sub>12</sub> (see figure) are all deeply red-colored crystals due to the color of the cobalt-corrin complex.\n\n*'''[[Cyanocobalamin]]''' is one form of B<sub>12</sub> because it can be metabolized in the body to an active [[coenzyme]] form.<ref name=lpi/> The cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> does not occur in nature normally, but is a byproduct of the fact that other forms of B<sub>12</sub> are avid binders of cyanide (\u2013CN) which they pick up in the process of [[activated charcoal]] purification of the vitamin after it is made by bacteria in the commercial process. Since the cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> is easy to crystallize and is not sensitive to air-oxidation, it is typically used as a form of B<sub>12</sub> for food fortification, in many common multivitamins and as a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> dietary supplement. \n*'''[[Hydroxocobalamin]]''' is another vitamer of B<sub>12</sub> commonly encountered in pharmacology, but is not normally present in the human body. Hydroxocobalamin is sometimes denoted B<sub>12a</sub>. This is the form of B<sub>12</sub> produced by bacteria, and which is converted to cyanocobalamin in the commercial charcoal filtration step of production. Hydroxocobalamin has an avid affinity for [[cyanide]] ions and has been used as an antidote to cyanide poisoning. It is supplied typically in water solution for injection. Hydroxocobalamin is thought to be converted to the active enzymic forms of B<sub>12</sub> more easily than cyanocobalamin, and since it is little more expensive than cyanocobalamin, and has longer retention times in the body, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is also the preferred treatment for [[pediatric]] patients with intrinsic cobalamin [[metabolic diseases]], for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficient patients with [[tobacco amblyopia]] (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.\n*'''[[Adenosylcobalamin]]''' (adoB<sub>12</sub> or AdoCbl) and '''[[methylcobalamin]]''' (MeB<sub>12</sub> or MeCbl) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body. Most of the body's reserves are stored as adoB<sub>12</sub> in the liver. This is converted to the methylcobalamin form as needed.\n\nA review of what is reported in the literature about cobalamin chemistry, transport, and processing suggests that there is unlikely to be any advantage to the use of adenosylcobalamin or methylcobalamin for treatment of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency over using cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin except possibly in very rare circumstances in which an inborn metabolic disorder reduces the efficiency of the conversion of cyanocobalamin to MeCbl or AdoCbl. The use of intramuscular hydroxocobalamin has been suggested in these cases. For the treatment of cyanide poisoning, hydroxocobalamin is the required form. Due to its excellent shelf-life and stability, cyanocobalamin is still considered the best choice for oral administration.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Obeid R, Fedosov SN, Nexo E | title = Cobalamin coenzyme forms are not likely to be superior to cyano- and hydroxyl-cobalamin in prevention or treatment of cobalamin deficiency | journal = Molecular Nutrition & Food Research | volume = 59 | issue = 7 | pages = 1364\u201372 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25820384 | pmc = 4692085 | doi = 10.1002/mnfr.201500019 }}</ref>\n\n==Biochemistry==\n[[File:Folicacid-B12.png|thumb|300px|[[Metabolism]] of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is seen at bottom left.]]\n\n===Coenzyme function===\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> functions as a [[coenzyme]], meaning that its presence is required for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Banerjee R, Ragsdale SW | title = The many faces of vitamin B12: catalysis by cobalamin-dependent enzymes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 72 | pages = 209\u201347 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 14527323 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161828 }}</ref> Three types of enzymes:\n\n# [[Isomerase]]s\n#: Rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine.

THF plays an important role in DNA synthesis so reduced availability of THF results in ineffective production of cells with rapid turnover, in particular red blood cells, and also intestinal wall cells which are responsible for absorption. [[Tetrahydrofolate|THF]] may be regenerated via MTR or may be obtained from fresh folate in the diet. Thus all of the DNA synthetic effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, including the [[megaloblastic anemia]] of [[pernicious anemia]], resolve if sufficient dietary folate is present. Thus the best-known \"function\" of B<sub>12</sub> (that which is involved with DNA synthesis, cell-division, and anemia) is actually a facultative function which is mediated by B<sub>12</sub>-conservation of an active form of folate which is needed for efficient DNA production.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wickramasinghe SN | title = Morphology, biology and biochemistry of cobalamin- and folate-deficient bone marrow cells | journal = Bailli\u00e8re's Clinical Haematology | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 441\u201359 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 8534956 | doi = 10.1016/S0950-3536(05)80215-X }}</ref> Other cobalamin-requiring methyltransferase enzymes are also known in bacteria, such as Me-H<sub>4</sub>-MPT, coenzyme M methyltransferase.\n\n===Enzyme function===\nIf folate is present in quantity, then of the two absolutely vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzyme-family reactions in humans, the [[Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase|MUT]]-family reactions show the most direct and characteristic secondary effects, focusing on the nervous system (see below). This is because the MTR (methyltransferase-type) reactions are involved in regenerating folate, and thus are less evident when folate is in good supply.\n\nSince the late 1990s, folic acid has begun to be added to fortify flour in many countries, so folate deficiency is now more rare. At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for [[anemia]] and [[erythrocyte]] size are routinely done in even simple medical test clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the [[Methionine synthase|MTR]]-dependent effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of homocysteine in the blood and urine ([[homocysteinuria]]). This condition may result in long-term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.\n\nThe specific myelin damage resulting from B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, even in the presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem.<ref name=lpi/> It has been connected to B<sub>12</sub> most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal [[fatty acid synthesis]], or it will be incorporated into [[fatty acid]]s itself rather than normal [[malonic acid]]. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur. Although the precise mechanism or mechanisms are not known with certainty, the result is [[subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Naidich MJ, Ho SU | title = Case 87: Subacute combined degeneration | journal = Radiology | volume = 237 | issue = 1 | pages = 101\u20135 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16183926 | doi = 10.1148/radiol.2371031757 }}</ref> Whatever the cause, it is known that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency causes [[neuropathies]], even if folic acid is present in good supply, and therefore anemia is not present.\n\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase|MTR]] reactions may also have neurological effects, through an indirect mechanism. Adequate [[methionine]] (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, if it is not regenerated from [[homocysteine]] by a B<sub>12</sub> dependent reaction) is needed to make [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of [[myelin]] sheath [[phospholipid]]s. Although production of SAMe is not B<sub>12</sub> dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the [[essential amino acid]] methionine) is assisted by B<sub>12</sub>. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain [[neurotransmitter]]s, [[catecholamine]]s and in brain metabolism. These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Methylation of the myelin sheath phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.\n\n==Physiology==\n===Absorption===\nFood B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed by two processes. The first is a vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-specific intestinal mechanism using [[intrinsic factor]] through which 1\u20132 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a passive diffusion process.<ref name=DRItext/> The human physiology of active vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption from food is complex. Protein-bound vitamin B<sub>12</sub> must be released from the proteins by the action of digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. [[Gastric acid]] releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore [[antacid]] and acid-blocking medications (especially [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s) may inhibit absorption of B<sub>12</sub>. After B<sub>12</sub> has been freed from proteins in food by [[pepsin]] in the stomach, [[R-protein]] (also known as haptocorrin and cobalophilin), a B<sub>12</sub> binding protein that is produced in the salivary glands, binds to B<sub>12</sub>. This protects the vitamin from degradation in the acidic environment of the stomach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen RH, Seetharam B, Podell E, Alpers DH | title = Effect of proteolytic enzymes on the binding of cobalamin to R protein and intrinsic factor.

The next binding protein for B<sub>12</sub> is [[intrinsic factor]] (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric [[parietal cell]]s that is secreted in response to [[histamine]], [[gastrin]] and [[pentagastrin]], as well as the presence of food. In the [[duodenum]], [[protease]]s digest R-proteins and release their bound B<sub>12</sub>, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B<sub>12</sub>). B<sub>12</sub> must be attached to IF for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal [[ileum]] of the [[small bowel]] only recognize the B<sub>12</sub>-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from [[catabolism]] by intestinal bacteria.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nAbsorption of food vitamin B<sub>12</sub> thus requires an intact and functioning [[stomach]], [[exocrine pancreas]], intrinsic factor, and small bowel.<ref name=DRItext/> Problems with any one of these organs makes a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency possible. Individuals who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B<sub>12</sub>. In [[pernicious anemia]], there is a lack of IF due to autoimmune [[atrophic gastritis]], in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B<sub>12</sub> protective function. Due to the complexity of B<sub>12</sub> absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.<ref name=combs2008>{{cite book|first=Gerald F. |last=Combs | name-list-format = vanc |title=The vitamins: fundamental aspects in nutrition and health |edition=3rd |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2008 |pages=381\u2013398 |isbn=978-0-12-183492-0|oclc=150255807}}</ref> This results in 80\u2013100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30\u201360% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.<ref name=combs2008/>\n\nOnce the IF/B<sub>12</sub> complex is recognized by specialized [[cubilin|ileal receptors]], it is transported into the [[portal circulation]]. The vitamin is then transferred to [[transcobalamin II]] (TC-II/B<sub>12</sub>), which serves as the plasma transporter. Hereditary defects in production of the transcobalamins and their receptors may produce functional deficiencies in B<sub>12</sub> and infantile [[megaloblastic anemia]], and abnormal B<sub>12</sub> related biochemistry, even in some cases with normal blood B<sub>12</sub> levels. For the vitamin to serve inside cells, the TC-II/B<sub>12</sub> complex must bind to a cell receptor, and be [[endocytosis|endocytosed]]. The transcobalamin-II is degraded within a [[lysosome]], and free B<sub>12</sub> is finally released into the cytoplasm, where it may be transformed into the proper coenzyme, by certain cellular enzymes (see above).<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Al-Awami HM, Raja A, Soos MP |title=Physiology, Intrinsic Factor (Gastric Intrinsic Factor) |journal=StatPearls [Internet] |volume= |issue= |pages= |date= August 2019 |pmid=31536261 |doi= |url=}}</ref>\n\nInvestigations into the intestinal absorption of B<sub>12</sub> point out that the upper limit of absorption per single oral dose, under normal conditions, is about 1.5{{nbsp}}\u00b5g.

Excess B<sub>12</sub> beyond the blood's binding capacity is typically excreted in urine.

[[Folate]] levels in the individual may affect the course of pathological changes and symptomatology of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.  \n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Definition==\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin essential to the function of all cells. Cobalamins are characterized by a [[porphyrin]]-like [[corrin]] nucleus that contains a single [[cobalt]] atom bound to a [[benzimidazole|benzimidazolyl]] [[nucleotide]] and a variable residue (R) group. The vitamin exists as a family of [[vitamer]]s defined as a number of chemical compounds having a similar molecular structure, each of which shows vitamin activity in a vitamin-deficient biological system. [[Adenosylcobalamin]] (AdoB<sub>12</sub>) and [[methylcobalamin]] (MeB<sub>12</sub>) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body, the first in mitochondria and the second in cell cytosol. AdoB<sub>12</sub> has a 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl group linked to the cobalt atom at the core of the molecule; MeB<sub>12</sub> has a methyl group at that location.\n\n[[Cyanocobalamin]] is a manufactured form with a cyano ([[cyanide]]) group bound to cobalt. Bacterial fermentation creates AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub> which are converted to cyanocobalamin by addition of potassium cyanide in the presence of sodium nitrite and heat. Once consumed, cyanocobalamin is converted to the biologically active AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub>. Cyanocobalamin is the most common form used in dietary supplements and [[food fortification]] because cyanide stabilizes the molecule from degradation. However, methylcobalamin is also offered as a dietary supplement. [[Hydroxocobalamin]] has a hydroxyl group attached to the cobalt atom. It can be injected intramuscularly to treat Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.

The sixth coordination site, the [[reactive center]], is variable, being a [[Cyanide|cyano group]] (\u2013CN), a [[hydroxyl]] group (\u2013OH), a [[methyl]] group (\u2013CH<sub>3</sub>) or a 5\u2032-deoxy[[Adenosine|adenosyl]] group (here the C5\u2032 atom of the deoxyribose forms the [[organocobalt chemistry|covalent bond with cobalt]] respectively, to yield the four [[vitamer]]s (forms) of B<sub>12</sub>). Historically, the covalent C-Co bond is one of the first examples of carbon-metal bonds to be discovered in biology.

All of the substrate cobalt-corrin molecules from which B<sub>12</sub> is made must be synthesized by bacteria. After this synthesis is complete, the human body has the ability to convert cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin to an active form, by means of enzymatically removing certain prosthetic chemical groups from the cobalt atom and replacing them with others.\n[[File:Cobalamin-general-structure-color.png|thumb|The structures of the four most common vitamers of cobalamin, together with some synonyms. The structure of the 5'-deoxyadenosyl group, which forms the R group of adensoylcobalamin is also shown.]]\n\n===Vitamers===\nThe four vitamers of B<sub>12</sub> (see figure) are all deeply red-colored crystals due to the color of the cobalt-corrin complex.\n\n*'''[[Cyanocobalamin]]''' is one form of B<sub>12</sub> because it can be metabolized in the body to an active [[coenzyme]] form.<ref name=lpi/> The cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> does not occur in nature normally, but is a byproduct of the fact that other forms of B<sub>12</sub> are avid binders of cyanide (\u2013CN) which they pick up in the process of [[activated charcoal]] purification of the vitamin after it is made by bacteria in the commercial process. Since the cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> is easy to crystallize and is not sensitive to air-oxidation, it is typically used as a form of B<sub>12</sub> for food fortification, in many common multivitamins and as a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> dietary supplement. \n*'''[[Hydroxocobalamin]]''' is another vitamer of B<sub>12</sub> commonly encountered in pharmacology, but is not normally present in the human body. Hydroxocobalamin is sometimes denoted B<sub>12a</sub>. This is the form of B<sub>12</sub> produced by bacteria, and which is converted to cyanocobalamin in the commercial charcoal filtration step of production. Hydroxocobalamin has an avid affinity for [[cyanide]] ions and has been used as an antidote to cyanide poisoning. It is supplied typically in water solution for injection. Hydroxocobalamin is thought to be converted to the active enzymic forms of B<sub>12</sub> more easily than cyanocobalamin, and since it is little more expensive than cyanocobalamin, and has longer retention times in the body, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is also the preferred treatment for [[pediatric]] patients with intrinsic cobalamin [[metabolic diseases]], for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficient patients with [[tobacco amblyopia]] (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.\n*'''[[Adenosylcobalamin]]''' (adoB<sub>12</sub> or AdoCbl) and '''[[methylcobalamin]]''' (MeB<sub>12</sub> or MeCbl) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body. Most of the body's reserves are stored as adoB<sub>12</sub> in the liver. This is converted to the methylcobalamin form as needed.\n\nA review of what is reported in the literature about cobalamin chemistry, transport, and processing suggests that there is unlikely to be any advantage to the use of adenosylcobalamin or methylcobalamin for treatment of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency over using cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin except possibly in very rare circumstances in which an inborn metabolic disorder reduces the efficiency of the conversion of cyanocobalamin to MeCbl or AdoCbl. The use of intramuscular hydroxocobalamin has been suggested in these cases. For the treatment of cyanide poisoning, hydroxocobalamin is the required form. Due to its excellent shelf-life and stability, cyanocobalamin is still considered the best choice for oral administration.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Obeid R, Fedosov SN, Nexo E | title = Cobalamin coenzyme forms are not likely to be superior to cyano- and hydroxyl-cobalamin in prevention or treatment of cobalamin deficiency | journal = Molecular Nutrition & Food Research | volume = 59 | issue = 7 | pages = 1364\u201372 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25820384 | pmc = 4692085 | doi = 10.1002/mnfr.201500019 }}</ref>\n\n==Biochemistry==\n[[File:Folicacid-B12.png|thumb|300px|[[Metabolism]] of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is seen at bottom left.]]\n\n===Coenzyme function===\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> functions as a [[coenzyme]], meaning that its presence is required for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Banerjee R, Ragsdale SW | title = The many faces of vitamin B12: catalysis by cobalamin-dependent enzymes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 72 | pages = 209\u201347 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 14527323 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161828 }}</ref> Three types of enzymes:\n\n# [[Isomerase]]s\n#: Rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine.

These are typified by the following two enzymes:\n\n# [[Methylmalonyl Coenzyme A mutase]] (MUT) is an isomerase which uses the AdoB<sub>12</sub> form and reaction type 1 to convert [[L-methylmalonyl-CoA]] to [[succinyl-CoA]], an important step in the catabolic breakdown of some [[amino acid]]s into succinyl-CoA, which then enters energy production via the [[citric acid cycle]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Forny P, Froese DS, Suormala T, Yue WW, Baumgartner MR | title = Functional characterization and categorization of missense mutations that cause methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT) deficiency | journal = Human Mutation | volume = 35 | issue = 12 | pages = 1449\u201358 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25125334 | pmc = 4441004 | doi = 10.1002/humu.22633 }}</ref> This functionality is lost in [[vitamin B12 deficiency|vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency]], and can be measured clinically as an increased [[methylmalonic acid]] (MMA) level.

THF plays an important role in DNA synthesis so reduced availability of THF results in ineffective production of cells with rapid turnover, in particular red blood cells, and also intestinal wall cells which are responsible for absorption. [[Tetrahydrofolate|THF]] may be regenerated via MTR or may be obtained from fresh folate in the diet. Thus all of the DNA synthetic effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, including the [[megaloblastic anemia]] of [[pernicious anemia]], resolve if sufficient dietary folate is present. Thus the best-known \"function\" of B<sub>12</sub> (that which is involved with DNA synthesis, cell-division, and anemia) is actually a facultative function which is mediated by B<sub>12</sub>-conservation of an active form of folate which is needed for efficient DNA production.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wickramasinghe SN | title = Morphology, biology and biochemistry of cobalamin- and folate-deficient bone marrow cells | journal = Bailli\u00e8re's Clinical Haematology | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 441\u201359 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 8534956 | doi = 10.1016/S0950-3536(05)80215-X }}</ref> Other cobalamin-requiring methyltransferase enzymes are also known in bacteria, such as Me-H<sub>4</sub>-MPT, coenzyme M methyltransferase.\n\n===Enzyme function===\nIf folate is present in quantity, then of the two absolutely vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzyme-family reactions in humans, the [[Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase|MUT]]-family reactions show the most direct and characteristic secondary effects, focusing on the nervous system (see below). This is because the MTR (methyltransferase-type) reactions are involved in regenerating folate, and thus are less evident when folate is in good supply.\n\nSince the late 1990s, folic acid has begun to be added to fortify flour in many countries, so folate deficiency is now more rare. At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for [[anemia]] and [[erythrocyte]] size are routinely done in even simple medical test clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the [[Methionine synthase|MTR]]-dependent effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of homocysteine in the blood and urine ([[homocysteinuria]]). This condition may result in long-term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.\n\nThe specific myelin damage resulting from B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, even in the presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem.<ref name=lpi/> It has been connected to B<sub>12</sub> most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal [[fatty acid synthesis]], or it will be incorporated into [[fatty acid]]s itself rather than normal [[malonic acid]]. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur. Although the precise mechanism or mechanisms are not known with certainty, the result is [[subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Naidich MJ, Ho SU | title = Case 87: Subacute combined degeneration | journal = Radiology | volume = 237 | issue = 1 | pages = 101\u20135 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16183926 | doi = 10.1148/radiol.2371031757 }}</ref> Whatever the cause, it is known that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency causes [[neuropathies]], even if folic acid is present in good supply, and therefore anemia is not present.\n\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase|MTR]] reactions may also have neurological effects, through an indirect mechanism. Adequate [[methionine]] (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, if it is not regenerated from [[homocysteine]] by a B<sub>12</sub> dependent reaction) is needed to make [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of [[myelin]] sheath [[phospholipid]]s. Although production of SAMe is not B<sub>12</sub> dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the [[essential amino acid]] methionine) is assisted by B<sub>12</sub>. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain [[neurotransmitter]]s, [[catecholamine]]s and in brain metabolism. These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Methylation of the myelin sheath phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.\n\n==Physiology==\n===Absorption===\nFood B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed by two processes. The first is a vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-specific intestinal mechanism using [[intrinsic factor]] through which 1\u20132 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a passive diffusion process.<ref name=DRItext/> The human physiology of active vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption from food is complex. Protein-bound vitamin B<sub>12</sub> must be released from the proteins by the action of digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. [[Gastric acid]] releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore [[antacid]] and acid-blocking medications (especially [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s) may inhibit absorption of B<sub>12</sub>. After B<sub>12</sub> has been freed from proteins in food by [[pepsin]] in the stomach, [[R-protein]] (also known as haptocorrin and cobalophilin), a B<sub>12</sub> binding protein that is produced in the salivary glands, binds to B<sub>12</sub>. This protects the vitamin from degradation in the acidic environment of the stomach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen RH, Seetharam B, Podell E, Alpers DH | title = Effect of proteolytic enzymes on the binding of cobalamin to R protein and intrinsic factor.

The next binding protein for B<sub>12</sub> is [[intrinsic factor]] (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric [[parietal cell]]s that is secreted in response to [[histamine]], [[gastrin]] and [[pentagastrin]], as well as the presence of food. In the [[duodenum]], [[protease]]s digest R-proteins and release their bound B<sub>12</sub>, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B<sub>12</sub>). B<sub>12</sub> must be attached to IF for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal [[ileum]] of the [[small bowel]] only recognize the B<sub>12</sub>-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from [[catabolism]] by intestinal bacteria.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nAbsorption of food vitamin B<sub>12</sub> thus requires an intact and functioning [[stomach]], [[exocrine pancreas]], intrinsic factor, and small bowel.<ref name=DRItext/> Problems with any one of these organs makes a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency possible. Individuals who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B<sub>12</sub>. In [[pernicious anemia]], there is a lack of IF due to autoimmune [[atrophic gastritis]], in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B<sub>12</sub> protective function. Due to the complexity of B<sub>12</sub> absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.<ref name=combs2008>{{cite book|first=Gerald F. |last=Combs | name-list-format = vanc |title=The vitamins: fundamental aspects in nutrition and health |edition=3rd |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2008 |pages=381\u2013398 |isbn=978-0-12-183492-0|oclc=150255807}}</ref> This results in 80\u2013100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30\u201360% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.<ref name=combs2008/>\n\nOnce the IF/B<sub>12</sub> complex is recognized by specialized [[cubilin|ileal receptors]], it is transported into the [[portal circulation]]. The vitamin is then transferred to [[transcobalamin II]] (TC-II/B<sub>12</sub>), which serves as the plasma transporter. Hereditary defects in production of the transcobalamins and their receptors may produce functional deficiencies in B<sub>12</sub> and infantile [[megaloblastic anemia]], and abnormal B<sub>12</sub> related biochemistry, even in some cases with normal blood B<sub>12</sub> levels. For the vitamin to serve inside cells, the TC-II/B<sub>12</sub> complex must bind to a cell receptor, and be [[endocytosis|endocytosed]]. The transcobalamin-II is degraded within a [[lysosome]], and free B<sub>12</sub> is finally released into the cytoplasm, where it may be transformed into the proper coenzyme, by certain cellular enzymes (see above).<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Al-Awami HM, Raja A, Soos MP |title=Physiology, Intrinsic Factor (Gastric Intrinsic Factor) |journal=StatPearls [Internet] |volume= |issue= |pages= |date= August 2019 |pmid=31536261 |doi= |url=}}</ref>\n\nInvestigations into the intestinal absorption of B<sub>12</sub> point out that the upper limit of absorption per single oral dose, under normal conditions, is about 1.5{{nbsp}}\u00b5g.

Approximately 0.1% of this is lost per day by secretions into the gut, as not all these secretions are reabsorbed. [[Bile]] is the main form of B<sub>12</sub> excretion; most of the B<sub>12</sub> secreted in the bile is recycled via [[enterohepatic circulation]]. Excess B<sub>12</sub> beyond the blood's binding capacity is typically excreted in urine. Owing to the extremely efficient enterohepatic circulation of B<sub>12</sub>, the liver can store 3 to 5 years' worth of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>; therefore, nutritional deficiency of this vitamin is rare in adults in the absence of malabsorption disorders.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\n==Production==\n===Biosynthesis===\n{{Main|Cobalamin biosynthesis}}\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> is derived from a [[tetrapyrrole|tetrapyrrolic structural framework]] created by the enzymes [[Porphobilinogen deaminase|deaminase]] and [[uroporphyrinogen III synthase|cosynthetase]] which transform [[aminolevulinic acid]] via [[porphobilinogen]] and [[hydroxymethylbilane]] to [[uroporphyrinogen III]].
