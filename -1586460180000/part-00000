It is a strict syntactical [[superset]] of [[JavaScript]], and adds optional static typing to the language. \n\nTypeScript is designed for development of large applications and [[source-to-source compiler|transcompiles]] to JavaScript.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/10/microsoft-typescript-the-javascript-we-need-or-a-solution-looking-for-a-problem/|title=Microsoft TypeScript: the JavaScript we need, or a solution looking for a problem?|last=Bright|first=Peter|date=3 October 2012|work=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]]|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref> As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs. TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both [[client-side]] and [[server-side]] execution (as with [[Node.js]] or [[Deno (software)|Deno]]).\n\nThere are multiple options available for transcompilation. Either the default TypeScript Checker can be used,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript|title=TypeScript Programming with Visual Studio Code|website=code.visualstudio.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> or the [[Babel (transcompiler)|Babel]] compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.\n\nTypeScript supports definition files that can contain type information of existing JavaScript libraries, much like [[C++]] header files can describe the structure of existing [[object file]]s. This enables other programs to use the values defined in the files as if they were statically typed TypeScript entities. There are third-party header files for popular libraries such as [[jQuery]], [[MongoDB]], and [[D3.js]]. TypeScript headers for the [[Node.js]] basic modules are also available, allowing development of [[Node.js]] programs within TypeScript.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped |title = borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped |date =  |work = [[GitHub]] |accessdate = 26 April 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe TypeScript compiler is itself written in TypeScript and [[Source-to-source compiler|compiled]] to JavaScript.

Knowing that the current ECMAScript standard proposal promised future support for [[class-based programming]], TypeScript was based on that proposal. That led to a JavaScript compiler with a set of syntactical language extensions, a superset based on the proposal, that transforms the extensions into regular JavaScript. In this sense TypeScript was a preview of what to expect of ECMAScript 2015. A unique aspect not in the proposal, but added to TypeScript, is optional [[static typing]]<ref>optional static typing is called [[gradual typing]]</ref> that enables static language analysis, which facilitates tooling and IDE support.\n\n=== ECMAScript 2015 support ===\n{{main article|ECMAScript#6th Edition - ECMAScript 2015}}\n\nTypeScript adds support for features such as classes, modules, and an arrow function syntax as defined in the ECMAScript 2015 standard.\n\n== Features ==\nTypeScript is a language extension that adds features to [[ECMAScript]] 6. Additional features include:\n* [[Type signature|Type annotations]] and [[compile-time]] [[type checking]]\n* [[Type inference]]\n* [[Type erasure]]\n* [[Interface (object-oriented programming)|Interfaces]]\n* [[Enumerated type]]s\n* [[Generic programming|Generics]]\n* [[Namespace]]s\n* [[Tuple]]s\n* [[Async/await]]\n\nThe following features are backported from ECMAScript 2015:\n* [[Class (computer programming)|Classes]]\n* [[Modular programming|Modules]]<ref>{{cite web |url = https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/microsoft-previews-new-javascript-like-programming-language-typescript/ |title = Microsoft Previews New JavaScript-Like Programming Language TypeScript |publisher = TechCrunch |date = 2012-10-01 |author = Klint Finley |accessdate = 2013-11-27 }}</ref>\n* Abbreviated \"arrow\" syntax for [[anonymous function]]s\n* Optional parameters and default parameters\n\nSyntactically, TypeScript is very similar to [[JScript .NET]], another Microsoft implementation of the ECMA-262 language standard that added support for static typing and classical object-oriented language features such as classes, inheritance, interfaces, and namespaces.\n\n=== Compatibility with JavaScript ===\nTypeScript is a strict superset of [[ECMAScript]] 2015, which is itself a superset of ECMAScript 5, commonly referred to as JavaScript.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/upgrade.html |title = Angular 2 |website = angular.io |access-date = 2016-05-04 }}</ref> As such, a JavaScript program is also a valid TypeScript program, and a TypeScript program can seamlessly consume JavaScript. By default the compiler targets ECMAScript 5, the current prevailing standard, but is also able to generate constructs used in ECMAScript 3 or 2015.\n\nWith TypeScript, it is possible to use existing JavaScript code, incorporate popular JavaScript libraries, and call TypeScript-generated code from other JavaScript.<ref name=\"typescript-home-page\">{{cite web |url = http://www.typescriptlang.org/ |title = Welcome to TypeScript |date =  |work = typescriptlang.org |publisher = [[Microsoft]] |accessdate = 26 April 2015 }}</ref> Type declarations for these libraries are provided with the source code.\n\n=== Type annotations ===\nTypeScript provides [[static typing]] through type annotations to enable [[type checking]] at [[compile time]]. This is optional and can be ignored to use the regular [[dynamic typing]] of JavaScript.\n<source lang=\"typescript\">\nfunction add(left: number, right: number): number {\n\treturn left + right;\n}\n</source>\n\nThe annotations for the primitive types are <code>number</code>, <code>boolean</code> and <code>string</code>. Weakly- or dynamically-typed structures are of type <code>any</code>.\n\nType annotations can be exported to a separate ''declarations file'' to make type information available for TypeScript scripts using types already compiled into JavaScript. Annotations can be declared for an existing JavaScript library, as has been done for [[Node.js]] and [[jQuery]].\n\nThe TypeScript compiler makes use of [[type inference]] to infer types when types are not given. For example, the <code>add</code> method in the code above would be inferred as returning a <code>number</code> even if no return type annotation had been provided. This is based on the static types of <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> being <code>numbers</code>, and the compiler's knowledge that the result of adding two <code>numbers</code> is always a <code>number</code>. However, explicitly declaring the return type allows the compiler to verify correctness.\n\nIf no type can be inferred because of lack of declarations, then it defaults to the dynamic <code>any</code> type. A value of the <code>any</code> type supports the same operations as a value in JavaScript and minimal static type checking is performed for operations on <code>any</code> values.<ref>[http://www.typescriptlang.org/Content/TypeScript%20Language%20Specification.pdf TypeScript Language Specification p.24] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117065339/http://www.typescriptlang.org/Content/TypeScript%20Language%20Specification.pdf |date=17 November 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==== Declaration files ====\nWhen a TypeScript script gets compiled there is an option to generate a ''declaration file'' (with the extension <code>.d.ts</code>) that functions as an [[interface (computing)|interface]] to the [[Component-oriented programming|component]]s in the compiled JavaScript. In the process the compiler strips away all function and method bodies and preserves only the signatures of the types that are exported. The resulting declaration file can then be used to describe the exported virtual TypeScript types of a JavaScript library or module when a third-party developer consumes it from TypeScript.\n\nThe concept of declaration files is analogous to the concept of [[header file]] found in [[C/C++]].\n<source lang=\"typescript\">\ndeclare namespace arithmetics {\n    add(left: number, right: number): number;\n    subtract(left: number, right: number): number;\n    multiply(left: number, right: number): number;\n    divide(left: number, right: number): number;\n}\n</source>\n\nType declaration files can be written by hand for existing JavaScript libraries, as has been done for jQuery and Node.js.\n\nLarge collections of declaration files for popular JavaScript libraries are hosted on GitHub in [https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped DefinitelyTyped].\n\n=== Classes ===\nTypeScript supports ECMAScript 2015 classes that integrate the optional type annotations support.\n<source lang=\"typescript\">\nclass Person {\n    private name: string;\n    private age: number;\n    private salary: number;\n\n    constructor(name: string, age: number, salary: number) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.age = age;\n        this.salary = salary;\n    }\n\n    toString(): string {\n        return `${this.name} (${this.age}) (${this.salary})`; // As of version 1.4\n    }\n}\n</source>\n\n=== Generics ===\nTypeScript supports [[generic programming]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://blogs.msdn.com/b/typescript/archive/2013/06/18/announcing-typescript-0-9.aspx |title = Announcing TypeScript 0.9 |work = TypeScript Language team blog |publisher = [[Microsoft]] |date = 18 June 2013 |first = Jonathan |last = Turner }}</ref> The following is an example of the [[identity function]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html#working-with-generic-type-variables|title=Generics in Typescript |publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref>\n\n\n<source lang=\"typescript\">\nfunction doSomething<T>(arg: T): T {\n    return arg;\n}\n</source>\n\n=== Modules and namespaces ===\nTypeScript distinguishes between modules and namespaces. Both features in TypeScript support encapsulation of classes, interfaces, functions and variables into containers. Namespaces (formerly internal modules) utilize [[immediately-invoked function expression]] of JavaScript to encapsulate code, whereas modules (formerly external modules) leverage JavaScript library patterns to do so ([[Asynchronous module definition|AMD]] or [[CommonJS]]).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://blog.oio.de/2014/01/31/an-introduction-to-typescript-module-system/ |title = An introduction to TypeScript\u2019s module system |publisher = blog.oio.de |date = 2014-01-31 |author = S&ouml;nke Sothmann |accessdate = 2014-02-21 }}</ref>\n\n== Development tools ==\n=== Compiler ===\nThe TypeScript compiler, named <code>tsc</code>, is [[Self-hosting (compilers)|written in TypeScript]]. As a result, it can be compiled into regular JavaScript and can then be executed in any JavaScript engine (e.g. a browser). The compiler package comes bundled with a script host that can execute the compiler. It is also available as a [[Node.js]] package that uses Node.js as a host.\n\nThere is also an [[Alpha test|alpha]] version of a client-side compiler in JavaScript, which executes TypeScript code on the fly, upon page load.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://github.com/niutech/typescript-compile |title = niutech/typescript-compile |date =  |work = GitHub |accessdate = 26 April 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe current version of the compiler supports ECMAScript 5 by default. An option is allowed to target ECMAScript 2015 to make use of language features exclusive to that version (e.g. generators). Classes, despite being part of the ECMAScript 2015 standard, are available in both modes.\n\n=== IDE and editor support ===\n* [[Microsoft]] provides a [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] for [[Visual Studio|Visual Studio 2012]] and [[Microsoft WebMatrix|WebMatrix]], full integrated support in [[Visual Studio|Visual Studio 2013]], [[Visual Studio|Visual Studio 2015]], and basic text editor support for [[Emacs]] and [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]].<ref name=\"blogs.msdn.com\">{{cite web |author = Olivier Bloch |title = Sublime Text, Vi, Emacs: TypeScript enabled! |url = http://blogs.msdn.com/b/interoperability/archive/2012/10/01/sublime-text-vi-emacs-typescript-enabled.aspx |publisher = [[Microsoft]] |date = 2012-10-01 |accessdate = 2012-10-28 }}</ref>\n* [[Visual Studio Code]] is a (mostly) open-source, cross-platform source code editor developed by Microsoft based on [[Electron (software framework)|Electron]].

Knowing that the current ECMAScript standard proposal promised future support for [[class-based programming]], TypeScript was based on that proposal. That led to a JavaScript compiler with a set of syntactical language extensions, a superset based on the proposal, that transforms the extensions into regular JavaScript. In this sense TypeScript was a preview of what to expect of ECMAScript 2015. A unique aspect not in the proposal, but added to TypeScript, is optional [[static typing]]<ref>optional static typing is called [[gradual typing]]</ref> that enables static language analysis, which facilitates tooling and IDE support.\n\n=== ECMAScript 2015 support ===\n{{main article|ECMAScript#6th Edition - ECMAScript 2015}}\n\nTypeScript adds support for features such as classes, modules, and an arrow function syntax as defined in the ECMAScript 2015 standard.\n\n== Features ==\nTypeScript is a language extension that adds features to [[ECMAScript]] 6. Additional features include:\n* [[Type signature|Type annotations]] and [[compile-time]] [[type checking]]\n* [[Type inference]]\n* [[Type erasure]]\n* [[Interface (object-oriented programming)|Interfaces]]\n* [[Enumerated type]]s\n* [[Generic programming|Generics]]\n* [[Namespace]]s\n* [[Tuple]]s\n* [[Async/await]]\n\nThe following features are backported from ECMAScript 2015:\n* [[Class (computer programming)|Classes]]\n* [[Modular programming|Modules]]<ref>{{cite web |url = https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/microsoft-previews-new-javascript-like-programming-language-typescript/ |title = Microsoft Previews New JavaScript-Like Programming Language TypeScript |publisher = TechCrunch |date = 2012-10-01 |author = Klint Finley |accessdate = 2013-11-27 }}</ref>\n* Abbreviated \"arrow\" syntax for [[anonymous function]]s\n* Optional parameters and default parameters\n\nSyntactically, TypeScript is very similar to [[JScript .NET]], another Microsoft implementation of the ECMA-262 language standard that added support for static typing and classical object-oriented language features such as classes, inheritance, interfaces, and namespaces.\n\n=== Compatibility with JavaScript ===\nTypeScript is a strict superset of [[ECMAScript]] 2015, which is itself a superset of ECMAScript 5, commonly referred to as JavaScript.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/upgrade.html |title = Angular 2 |website = angular.io |access-date = 2016-05-04 }}</ref> As such, a JavaScript program is also a valid TypeScript program, and a TypeScript program can seamlessly consume JavaScript. By default the compiler targets ECMAScript 5, the current prevailing standard, but is also able to generate constructs used in ECMAScript 3 or 2015.\n\nWith TypeScript, it is possible to use existing JavaScript code, incorporate popular JavaScript libraries, and call TypeScript-generated code from other JavaScript.<ref name=\"typescript-home-page\">{{cite web |url = http://www.typescriptlang.org/ |title = Welcome to TypeScript |date =  |work = typescriptlang.org |publisher = [[Microsoft]] |accessdate = 26 April 2015 }}</ref> Type declarations for these libraries are provided with the source code.\n\n=== Type annotations ===\nTypeScript provides [[static typing]] through type annotations to enable [[type checking]] at [[compile time]]. This is optional and can be ignored to use the regular [[dynamic typing]] of JavaScript.\n<source lang=\"typescript\">\nfunction add(left: number, right: number): number {\n\treturn left + right;\n}\n</source>\n\nThe annotations for the primitive types are <code>number</code>, <code>boolean</code> and <code>string</code>. Weakly- or dynamically-typed structures are of type <code>any</code>.\n\nType annotations can be exported to a separate ''declarations file'' to make type information available for TypeScript scripts using types already compiled into JavaScript. Annotations can be declared for an existing JavaScript library, as has been done for [[Node.js]] and [[jQuery]].\n\nThe TypeScript compiler makes use of [[type inference]] to infer types when types are not given. For example, the <code>add</code> method in the code above would be inferred as returning a <code>number</code> even if no return type annotation had been provided. This is based on the static types of <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> being <code>numbers</code>, and the compiler's knowledge that the result of adding two <code>numbers</code> is always a <code>number</code>. However, explicitly declaring the return type allows the compiler to verify correctness.\n\nIf no type can be inferred because of lack of declarations, then it defaults to the dynamic <code>any</code> type. A value of the <code>any</code> type supports the same operations as a value in JavaScript and minimal static type checking is performed for operations on <code>any</code> values.<ref>[http://www.typescriptlang.org/Content/TypeScript%20Language%20Specification.pdf TypeScript Language Specification p.24] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117065339/http://www.typescriptlang.org/Content/TypeScript%20Language%20Specification.pdf |date=17 November 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==== Declaration files ====\nWhen a TypeScript script gets compiled there is an option to generate a ''declaration file'' (with the extension <code>.d.ts</code>) that functions as an [[interface (computing)|interface]] to the [[Component-oriented programming|component]]s in the compiled JavaScript. In the process the compiler strips away all function and method bodies and preserves only the signatures of the types that are exported. The resulting declaration file can then be used to describe the exported virtual TypeScript types of a JavaScript library or module when a third-party developer consumes it from TypeScript.\n\nThe concept of declaration files is analogous to the concept of [[header file]] found in [[C/C++]].\n<source lang=\"typescript\">\ndeclare namespace arithmetics {\n    add(left: number, right: number): number;\n    subtract(left: number, right: number): number;\n    multiply(left: number, right: number): number;\n    divide(left: number, right: number): number;\n}\n</source>\n\nType declaration files can be written by hand for existing JavaScript libraries, as has been done for jQuery and Node.js.\n\nLarge collections of declaration files for popular JavaScript libraries are hosted on GitHub in [https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped DefinitelyTyped].\n\n=== Classes ===\nTypeScript supports ECMAScript 2015 classes that integrate the optional type annotations support.\n<source lang=\"typescript\">\nclass Person {\n    private name: string;\n    private age: number;\n    private salary: number;\n\n    constructor(name: string, age: number, salary: number) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.age = age;\n        this.salary = salary;\n    }\n\n    toString(): string {\n        return `${this.name} (${this.age}) (${this.salary})`; // As of version 1.4\n    }\n}\n</source>\n\n=== Generics ===\nTypeScript supports [[generic programming]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://blogs.msdn.com/b/typescript/archive/2013/06/18/announcing-typescript-0-9.aspx |title = Announcing TypeScript 0.9 |work = TypeScript Language team blog |publisher = [[Microsoft]] |date = 18 June 2013 |first = Jonathan |last = Turner }}</ref> The following is an example of the [[identity function]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html#working-with-generic-type-variables|title=Generics in Typescript |publishert=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref>\n\n\n<source lang=\"typescript\">\nfunction doSomething<T>(arg: T): T {\n    return arg;\n}\n</source>\n\n=== Modules and namespaces ===\nTypeScript distinguishes between modules and namespaces. Both features in TypeScript support encapsulation of classes, interfaces, functions and variables into containers. Namespaces (formerly internal modules) utilize [[immediately-invoked function expression]] of JavaScript to encapsulate code, whereas modules (formerly external modules) leverage JavaScript library patterns to do so ([[Asynchronous module definition|AMD]] or [[CommonJS]]).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://blog.oio.de/2014/01/31/an-introduction-to-typescript-module-system/ |title = An introduction to TypeScript\u2019s module system |publisher = blog.oio.de |date = 2014-01-31 |author = S&ouml;nke Sothmann |accessdate = 2014-02-21 }}</ref>\n\n== Development tools ==\n=== Compiler ===\nThe TypeScript compiler, named <code>tsc</code>, is [[Self-hosting (compilers)|written in TypeScript]].

It is also available as a [[Node.js]] package that uses Node.js as a host.\n\nThere is also an [[Alpha test|alpha]] version of a client-side compiler in JavaScript, which executes TypeScript code on the fly, upon page load.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://github.com/niutech/typescript-compile |title = niutech/typescript-compile |date =  |work = GitHub |accessdate = 26 April 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe current version of the compiler supports ECMAScript 5 by default.
