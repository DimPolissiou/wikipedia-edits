{"title_page": "Geospatial summary of the High Peaks/Summits of the Juneau Icefield", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2018}}\n{{Use American English|date=March 2018}}\n{{GeoGroup}}\n[[Image:Juneau Icefield.jpg|thumbnail|right|208px|View of the Juneau Icefield]]\nThe '''geospatial summary of the High Peaks/Summits of the Juneau Icefield''' is a compilation of the basic [[geospatial]] properties (location, elevation and prominence) of the peaks/summits within the general area of the [[Juneau Icefield]] located North and East of [[Juneau, Alaska]] extending north to [[Skagway, Alaska]]. The peaks are classified by elevation: 2000 m, 2050 m, 2100 m, 2150 m, 2200 m, 2250 m, 2300 m and above 2400 m. Most (216, {{#expr:216/272*100 round 0}}%) of the [[#Juneau Icefield High Peaks Summary|272 summits]] compiled have not been assigned an official name<ref name=\"usgs.gov\">http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=DGNPPublic</ref> by the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) [[Geographic Names Information System]] (GNIS) and as such are delineated as \"Un-Named\" (UNP in the [[Keyhole Markup Language|KML]] file).\n\nIn addition, select minor peaks are included to report those that are contained within the GNIS database and to permit assigning a location marker (coordinate) for Nunatak identification and ridge delineation for the USGS [[Hydrological code#United States|Hydrologic Unit Code]] boundaries for cross referencing these areal shapes to a single coordinate.\n\nThe elevation of the peaks and summits of the [[Juneau Icefield]] was determined by referencing multiple sources including:\n*GNIS database\n*[[BC Geographical Names]] (BCGN) database\n*USGS topographic maps\n*[[United States Forest Service]] (USFS) topographic maps\n*[[Natural Resources Canada]] (NRC) topographic maps\n*[http://www.peakbagger.com/ Peakbagger.com] with cross-referencing to USGS and USFS\n*Selected other sources (such as scientific papers).\n\nThe GNIS database consistently reports the peak elevation lower than the referenced USGS and/or USFS topographic maps. The topographic maps also report lower elevations than selected [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] measurements conducted by personnel of the [[Juneau Icefield Research Program]], but not to the degree of the GNIS database.\n\nIn this article, the topographic map values were used to report elevation above [[Sea level|mean sea level]] (MSL), unless a more accurate GPS measurement was available.\n\n==Juneau Icefield High Peaks summary==\n{{See also|Juneau Icefield}}\n[[Image:Taku D Peak.jpg|right|thumb|300px|South-East face of Taku D Peak, from the perspective of Taku glacier.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | High Peaks summary\n|-\n!

Most (216, {{#expr:216/272*100 round 0}}%) of the [[#Juneau Icefield High Peaks Summary|272 summits]] compiled have not been assigned an official name<ref name=\"usgs.gov\">http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=DGNPPublic</ref> by the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) [[Geographic Names Information System]] (GNIS) and as such are delineated as \"Un-Named\" (UNP in the [[Keyhole Markup Language|KML]] file).\n\nIn addition, select minor peaks are included to report those that are contained within the GNIS database and to permit assigning a location marker (coordinate) for Nunatak identification and ridge delineation for the USGS [[Hydrological code#United States|Hydrologic Unit Code]] boundaries for cross referencing these areal shapes to a single coordinate.\n\nThe elevation of the peaks and summits of the [[Juneau Icefield]] was determined by referencing multiple sources including:\n*GNIS database\n*[[BC Geographical Names]] (BCGN) database\n*USGS topographic maps\n*[[United States Forest Service]] (USFS) topographic maps\n*[[Natural Resources Canada]] (NRC) topographic maps\n*[http://www.peakbagger.com/ Peakbagger.com] with cross-referencing to USGS and USFS\n*Selected other sources (such as scientific papers).\n\nThe GNIS database consistently reports the peak elevation lower than the referenced USGS and/or USFS topographic maps. The topographic maps also report lower elevations than selected [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] measurements conducted by personnel of the [[Juneau Icefield Research Program]], but not to the degree of the GNIS database.\n\nIn this article, the topographic map values were used to report elevation above [[Sea level|mean sea level]] (MSL), unless a more accurate GPS measurement was available.\n\n==Juneau Icefield High Peaks summary==\n{{See also|Juneau Icefield}}\n[[Image:Taku D Peak.jpg|right|thumb|300px|South-East face of Taku D Peak, from the perspective of Taku glacier.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | High Peaks summary\n|-\n!

number of stricter regulations. Foremost, all persons must maintain a 2-meter distance and observe epidemiological safety measures in private and public events, as well as during public indoor and outdoor activities. The exception is given for 2 persons, persons living in the same household or parents and their minor children if they don't live in the same household. New restrictions also prohibit all private arrangements (except funerals), public events, meetings, processions, pickets, indoor sports and religious activities. Trading and public catering venues are still allowed to hold more persons while maintaining the 2-meter distance and observing safety measures. Various other are also adopted, such as prioritization of medical item supply for national purposes or government's right to request information from [[electronic communications]] operators on specific persons for epidemiological investigation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/health/latvian-government-steps-up-restrictions-with-two-person-two-meter-rule.a353788/ |title=Latvian government steps up restrictions with two-person, two-meter rule |date=30 March 2020 |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting of Latvia]] |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mk.gov.lv/en/aktualitates/stricter-rules-physical-distancing-persons-are-introduced-limit-spread-covid-19 |title=Stricter rules for physical distancing of persons are introduced to limit the spread of Covid-19 |author=State Chancellery |date=29 March 2020 |publisher=Cabinet of Ministers |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nProfessor Uga Dumpis from [[Pauls Stradi\u0146\u0161 Clinical University Hospital]]<!--Department of Infection Control and Surveillance--> stated that the majority of the cases have been those who returned from abroad, that new cases with no connection to other patients is worrying, but that the number of these cases remains very low and that \"the infection is somewhat controlled\".

for Technology and Leadership''' (CCTL) is one of the three Early-College High School programs in [[Iredell County, North Carolina]]. The Collaborative College is a grade A school and has been ranked among the top 2% of schools throughout North Carolina. CCTL has been recognized as a school for \"Innovation and Excellence,\" a distinction given to only 16 schools in North Carolina. It received the Apple Distinguished School Award in 2016.\n\nStudents graduate with an associate degree within five years and have the option of completing the program in 4 years. All credits are transferable to universities in the UNC College system, withstanding that a student has received a grade of \"C\" or higher in each class to be transferred.\n\nBecause CCTL is on the Statesville main campus of Mitchell Community College, the affiliation between the two schools is the strongest among all the early college programs in Iredell County, and CCTL students must adhere to both the early college and Mitchell Community College policies.\n\n== Clubs and Activities ==\n* Model United Nations\n* Elemental Dragons-Robotics\n* Student Court\n* Student Events Association (SEA)\n* Interact\n* Innovation Space\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Barfield, Heather. \"Iredell School Receives Statewide Recognition for Innovation.\" Statesville Record and Landmark. 15 Feb. 2016.

North Carolina]]. The Collaborative College is a grade A school and has been ranked among the top 2% of schools throughout North Carolina. CCTL has been recognized as a school for \"Innovation and Excellence,\" a distinction given to only 16 schools in North Carolina. It received the Apple Distinguished School Award in 2016.\n\nStudents graduate with an associate degree within five years and have the option of completing the program in 4 years. All credits are transferable to universities in the UNC College system, withstanding that a student has received a grade of \"C\" or higher in each class to be transferred.\n\nBecause CCTL is on the Statesville main campus of Mitchell Community College, the affiliation between the two schools is the strongest among all the early college programs in Iredell County, and CCTL students must adhere to both the early college and Mitchell Community College policies.\n\n== Clubs and Activities ==\n* Model United Nations\n* Elemental Dragons-Robotics\n* Student Court\n* Student Events Association (SEA)\n* Interact\n* Innovation Space\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Barfield, Heather. \"Iredell School Receives Statewide Recognition for Innovation.\" Statesville Record and Landmark. 15 Feb. 2016.

Unlike [[contract bridge]] and [[Spades (card game)|spades]], taking more tricks than bid is a loss. It was first described by B. C. Westall around 1930.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parlett|first=David|title=Oxford Dictionary of Card Games|year=1996|p=176|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-869173-4}}</ref>\n\n==Concept==\nThe game of Oh Hell explores the idea of taking an exact number of tricks specified by a bid before the hand. It differs from other trick-taking games in that players play a fixed number of hands. The game uses [[Trump (card games)|trumps]], often decided by a cut of the deck after the hand's cards have been distributed.\n\nLike many popular social card games, Oh Hell has many local variants, in both rules and names.\n\n==Famous players==\nProminent players of Oh Hell include former President [[Bill Clinton]], who learned it from [[Steven Spielberg]].<ref>https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/09/18/the-wanderer-3</ref>\n\n==Rules==\nThere are many variations to this game; a common set of regulations is given here.\n\nOh Hell can be played with almost any number of players (3+) although 4-7 is considered optimal. The game is played using a standard 52-card deck, with ace (A) being the highest rank, two (2) the lowest. With six or more players, the game can be played with two decks combined or with a 63-card deck from six-player [[500 card game|500]].\n\nA game consists of a fixed number of hands, and each hand consists of dealing a certain number of cards to each player, depending on the variation and the number of players. During a hand, each player bids for a number of tricks, then attempts to take exactly that many tricks during the hand.\n\nThe dealer (initially determined by [[cut (cards)|cutting cards]]) deals out the cards one by one, starting with the player to his left, in a clockwise direction, until the required number of cards has been dealt. After the dealing is complete, the next card is turned face up, and the suit of this card determines the trump suit for the deal, which is why only up to 12 cards are dealt in a four-player match. (If there are no unused cards, the largest hand is played without a trump suit. Alternatively, the maximal round trump suit can be determined in a variety of ways: for instance, by revealing the dealer's last card as in [[whist]], by cutting the pack before dealing, or the dealer can decide the trump before seeing his own cards.)\n\nEach player now bids for the number of tricks he believes he can win. The player to the left of the dealer bids first. Bidding is unrestricted except for the ''screw the dealer'' rule: the number of tricks bid cannot equal the number available. That is, every deal must in total be either overbid or underbid. For example, if five cards are dealt, and the first three bids are two, zero and one, then the dealer may not bid two. However, if five cards are dealt, and the first three bids are three, one and two, then the dealer is free to make any bid. (The \"screw the dealer\" rule is not used in the version played in West Virginia, South Carolina, rural Maryland, and Pennsylvania, with the dealer being free to make any bid.) In an alternative style of bidding, all players simultaneously hold out fingers for the number of tricks they want to bid (similar in style to a [[rock paper scissors]] shoot). The players' bids are recorded on the score sheet.\n\nWhen every player has made a bid, the player to the left of the dealer makes the opening lead. Play then proceeds as usual in a [[trick-taking game]], with each player in turn playing one card. Players must follow suit, unless they have no cards of the led suit, in which case they may play any card. The highest card of the led suit wins the trick unless [[ruff (cards)|ruffed]], when the highest trump card wins.\n\nIn multi-deck games, the first of identical cards to be played (say two queens of clubs) wins the trick. In a more complicated variant, identical cards cancel each other, leading to the possibility (if the number of players is even) of an entire trick being canceled out.\n\nThe player who wins the trick leads to the next trick.\n\n==Number of hands per game==\n* In the '''British''' variation of the game,<ref>Penguin Encyclopedia of Card Games, p. 86, David Parlett - Penguin Books 1979 {{ISBN|0-14-028032-4}}</ref> the first hand is played with one card dealt to each player. On each succeeding deal one more card is dealt out to each player, until there are not enough cards for another round.\n* In another version of the British variant, once the full number of cards have been dealt out the number of cards per player ''decreases'' by one every round until back down to one card. The game is complete when the last round (with one card per player) has been played. A sub-variation for a small number of players (three or four) uses a step in the jump, such as three players opting for the pattern to be 1-3-5-7-9-11-13-15-13-11-9-7-5-3-1. Another variation consists of the pattern 12-11-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12, though this version takes longer to play: in a 4-player game, starting from \"1\" deals a total of 144 tricks, while starting from \"12\" yields 155 tricks. This also assumes using the entire 52-card deck, not an abbreviated game. \n* Yet another variation, played extensively in American colleges, begins with the \"1\" hand, then climbs up to the \"10\" hand before descending back down to a \"1\" hand. This version, referred to by students as \"Rats!\", \"Rat Fink\", and sometimes \"Rat Fuck\", is well suited for up to five players; since at its maximum it accounts for 50 of the 52 cards, with the \"10\" hand's trump suit determined from one of the remaining two cards. \n* The '''Diminishing Bridge''' variation begins with the maximum hand size and counts down.\n* In the '''Devil's Bridge''' variation, for the 1-card hand each player holds their own card on their forehead and looks at the other players' cards, rather than their own, to bid.\n* The '''Basas''' variation plays as the British version. Because there is no remainder card defining the trump suit in the last 4 rounds, the trump suit is auctioned in a manner similar to bridge. However, there is no hierarchy of suits, and a higher bid must be numerically higher. In Basas, if a player does not have a card of the suit with which the round was opened, ''they are required'' to play a trump. It is only if they do not have a trump that they may play any other card.\n\n==Cooperative version==\nIn this variant, all bids must add up exactly to the number of cards dealt for that round. Players must then \"make it work\" to move on to the next round. If anyone takes more or less than their bid, the deal moves to the left and the round is re-dealt. With four players, a second deck may be used to specify the round to be played\u2014the value of the upcard determines the number of cards dealt and the suit determines the trump suit for the round.\n\n==Prospect version==\nThis variant is played for money. Prior to dealing the first hand, players agree on the amount of money the \u201closers\u201d will have to pay to the winner. The last place finisher pays the most and the second-place finisher pays the least. The sliding scale in the Prospect version keeps all the players invested in the outcome of every hand, since their finishing rank corresponds to how much money they will owe the winner.\n\n==Tournaments==\nThe '''WPOHL (World Prospect Oh Hell League) Championship''' is usually held in December in [[Rehoboth Beach, Delaware]], using \u201cProspect\u201d rules. The deal begins with 10 cards, plays down to 1, then back up to 10 for a total of 19 hands per round. Depending on the size of the field, the five or ten lowest scoring players in the room are eliminated each round until there is a five-person \"final table.\"\n\nIn the early 1990s, the '''International Oh-Hell League's annual Championship Tournament of All Creation''' was held each March in the Fire Hall of [[Riverton, New Jersey]]. This yearly tournament lasted for over 20 years. Players vied for nominal, but not actual, possession of the league trophy, a two-inch bronze reproduction of the [[Manneken Pis]], which resided permanently in the home of tournament founder, John B. \"Jack\" Mathews. Alcohol was off-limits, but profanity was encouraged. A full table consisted of four players. Play began with a one-card hand, went up to 13, then back down to one for a total of 25 hands. In each hand, except the 13th when the entire deck was dealt, the first undealt card was turned over to establish the trump suit. The tournament entry fee was $5 and included complimentary hot dogs, doughnuts, and Tak-a-Boost (the official drink of the International Oh-Hell League). The tournament was a grueling all-day affair. All players had to commit to playing at least three games. Cumulative tabulation of the end scores from the first three-rounds allowed the top eight highest scoring players to move on to the semi-finals. The semi-finals portion of the tournament was where the commitment to play ended. If a semi-final eligible player could not or did not wish to continue, the player with the next highest cumulative score was offered the seat. The drawing of cards determined random seeding for the semi-final tables. The first and second place players at each semi-final table advanced to the finals, where the top-scoring player in this last game was the tournament winner. Consolation games and clean up by any remaining players were encouraged while waiting for the outcome of the tournament. For a period, the International Oh-Hell League was a registered corporation.\n\nThe Annual '''Cartier 'Oh Hell!' Tournament''' began in 1995. The tournament formula was created by Tessa Kennedy and Tomasz Starzewski. [[Cartier Ltd.]] sponsors the tournament with all money raised going to charity.\n*Players choose trump (not a random card), and 4 players constitute a full table.\n*Each game is 23 hands from 13 cards each down to 2 cards each and from 3 cards back up to 13. Players alternate as Dealer in a clockwise direction. One player is nominated as scorer.\n*The person with the highest number of bids names the trump suit which can be any of the four suits or \"no trumps.\"\n* Two decks of cards are assigned to each table. As one deck is dealt, the other is shuffled for the following hand, by the player sitting opposite the dealer. Players pick a random card from the deck to select the Dealer for the first hand (highest card is first Dealer).\n* The tournament is played with 32 people. The first round has all 32 people playing on 8 tables of 4 players each. The winner and first runner up from each table go on to play in the second round. The second round is therefore played with 16 people on 4 tables of 4 players. First round winners and runners-up are split up so they do not play each other again in the second round. The single winner from each table then goes on to the final table of four players. The winner is the tournament champion.\n\n==Scoring==\nThere are several alternative methods of scoring:\n* '''Basic scoring''': Each player scores 1 point for each trick he/she takes. A player that wins the exact number of tricks bid receives an additional 10 points for making the contract. Players who miss their contract are thus encouraged to take as many tricks as possible, which results in other players also missing their contracts.\n* '''Variant basic scoring''': As with Basic Scoring each player scores 1 point for each trick he/she takes however a player that wins the exact number of tricks bid receives an additional 5 points for making the contract. This makes the game closer when there are a large number of players and encourages players to bid more than 0 tricks as much as possible.\n* '''Exact scoring''': A player who makes the exact number of tricks bid scores 10 plus the amount bid. Players who overbid or underbid score nothing.\n* '''Exact scoring with penalty''': A player who makes the exact number of tricks bid scores 10 plus the amount bid. Players who underbid are deducted points in the amount of the bid. (Missing a 3 bid scores -3; missing a zero bid scores 0.) Used in the Hassenpfeffer variant.\n* '''10 times exact scoring''': Similar to Exact scoring, with or without penalty, but each trick bid is worth 10 points; a player who bids 4 is awarded 40 points for exactly making the bid and scores either zero or -40 if he does not make the contract. Variants of this also put a 5-point value on bidding ZERO - negative 5 if you take a trick, positive 5 if you don't take any tricks.\n* '''Double Whammy''': Played like basic scoring, except that a successful 1-bid earns 15 points, a successful 2-bid earns 22, and further successive bids are awarded in multiples of 11 (33 for 3, 44 for 4, etc.). This variation may be played in the second half of an otherwise regular game, if desired.\n* '''Penalty under, Zero Over''': A variation of exact scoring that combines variants with and without penalties; overtricking scores zero points while undertricking results in a penalty according to the specific exact scoring variant used. This promotes \"sacrificing\" one's own contract by severely overtricking in order to \"set\" someone else.\n* '''Exact scoring with penalty where points are multiples of 5''': A player who makes the exact number of tricks bid scores 10 plus the amount bid multiplied by 5. Players who underbid are deducted points in the amount of the bid multiplied by 5. (Missing a 3 bid scores (3*(-5))=-15; missing a zero bid scores -10. Making a 5 scores (10+5*5)=35) Used in the Cypriot variant. This variant encourages high bidding due to the number of possible points to gain.\n* '''Exact scoring with set penalty''': A player who makes the exact number of tricks bid scores 10 plus the amount bid. Players who underbid score only one point for each trick. Players who overbid have \"gone set\" and lose 10 points, regardless of the number of tricks taken. For example, if a player who has bid four takes exactly 4 tricks, he scores 14. If he takes 5 tricks, he scores 5. If he takes 3 tricks, he scores -10.\n* '''Exact scoring with progressive penalty''': A player who makes the exact number of tricks bid scores 10 plus the amount bid. Players who underbid or overbid lose the amount of the bid, plus ten points for each trick under or overbid. For example, a player bids 4: If he takes exactly 4 tricks, he scores 14. If he takes 3 or 5 tricks, he scores -14. If he takes 2 or 6 tricks, he scores -24. This variation makes it easier to \"pile on the leader\" and eliminate even a large lead in just one hand.\n* '''Reduced 0 bid''': Similar to basic (or exact) scoring, with the modification that making a zero contract scores only five points. (Zero bids are often the easiest to make.)\n* '''Adjusted 0 bid''': Similar to basic scoring, with the change that a zero bid is worth five plus the number of cards dealt out to a player. For example, in the first round, a successful zero bid is worth 6 points, while a successful one bid is worth 11 points. (Zero bids are harder to make in larger hands.)\n* '''Progressive scoring''': As in basic scoring, a player that fails to make the contract receives a number of points equal to the number of tricks he takes. However, a successful bid is worth the 10-point threshold plus the ''square'' of the bid, thereby rewarding a person bidding and making four tricks with 26 (10 plus 16) points. This has the advantage of rewarding riskier bids, and making it possible for someone to catch up from behind more easily.\n* '''Simplified / Montreal progressive scoring''': Each player receives 10 points for satisfying the contract plus twice the number of tricks taken, otherwise they receive zero points.\n* '''Negative scoring''': The scoring system is reversed, as in [[golf]], lowest score winning. Satisfying the contract scores zero points. The first undertrick or overtrick costs one point, and each additional undertrick/overtrick costs a point more than the one before it. For instance, 3 overtricks would add 6 points (the sum of 1, 2, and 3) to a player's total. This rewards sacrifices, for it is now often beneficial to risk an overtrick (1 point) to cost a person that is already down to get an additional undertrick (which will cost many more points).\n* '''Simplified negative scoring''': Each player scores the square of the number of overtricks or undertricks taken.\n* '''Variant negative scoring''': Each player who fails to satisfy the contract scores points according to the number of total tricks in that round (e.g., in a round where there were five total tricks, every unsuccessful player scores 5).\n* '''Spades double''': In variations where the trump card is chosen randomly, some play that if a spade is turned up, the points for that round double.\n* '''Trick scoring''': Each player that scores the number of tricks bid receives that many points, with the exception of correctly bidding 0, in which case the player receives a half point. Any overbid or underbid loses the number of points their bid was off (a player bidding 3 tricks that wins only 2 would lose a point, as would a player bidding 2 and winning 3).\n* '''Binary scoring''': A player who makes the exact number of tricks bid scores 10. Players who overbid or underbid score nothing.\n* '''Binary scoring with nil rule''': A player who makes the exact number of tricks bid scores 10. If the number of tricks exceeds the number of players, players who bid nil (zero) score 20 if they take no tricks, otherwise -10.\n* '''Binary scoring with increasing penalty''': A player who makes the exact number of tricks bid scores 8. Players who overbid or underbid have their score cut in half, (rounding up).\n* '''Scratch / Quick scoring''': Players who overbid or underbid get a scratch (signified by crossing through their unsuccessful bid). The person with the least scratches wins the game. In the event of a tie, the tied player who bid the most wins the game (This is done by adding up each tied-player's successful bids.)\n* '''Adjusted exact scoring''': A player who makes the exact number of tricks receives that number of points plus the number of cards dealt out to a player.\n* '''Get Fred / Oy Vey scoring''': A player who makes the exact number of tricks receives that number of points plus 10. Players who miss the contract lose the difference between the bid and the number of tricks taken. Thus, a player who bids three and takes either two or four tricks will lose one point. (In the Oy Vey variant, if many players are playing, often a successful bid is worth the 10-point threshold plus the ''square'' of the bid. This lifts the scores in the game, as in general the more players participate, the lower the scores are.)\n* '''Novacastrian scoring''': A player who makes the exact number of tricks receives that number of points. Players who overbid lose the number of points they bid for that hand. Players who underbid lose the number of tricks they've taken that hand. A player's score will change by at least the number bid and by at least the number of tricks they take.\n* '''Gentleman scoring''': A player who makes the contract scores the number of tricks bid times 10, unless he/she bid zero, in which case the player scores 5. If a player fails to make the contract and takes overtrick(s), he/she scores the number of tricks taken. If a player has overbid, he/she scores the difference between tricks bid and tricks taken times -10.\n* '''Variable bonus scoring''': Each player scores one point for each trick taken, plus a variable bonus if the player takes the exact number of tricks bid. The bonus numerically decreases as the number of cards increases (and vice versa), meaning that when there are more tricks available in a round (and thereby a greater chance of successfully achieving the bid), there are less bonus points on offer. For example, in a game where the dealing pattern is 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1, the bonus points available in each successive round would be 8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8.\n* '''Penalty Scoring''': A player who makes the contract scores 10 points + 5 points for each trick made. If the bidder makes more or fewer tricks than were bid, he/she loses 10 points for the first over or under trick + 15 points for each additional over or under trick.\n* '''Bidding Blind''': Blind bids are unique to the '''Prospect version''' of Oh Hell. If a player falls 20 points, or more, behind the leader at the end of a round (e.g., Player 1 has 15 points and Player 2 is the leader with 35 points) the player that is behind can enter a blind bid by bidding prior to looking at any of his cards, and prior to anyone else bidding. Bidding Blind is optional, and can be done multiple times as long as the player continues to be eligible after each round. If a player looks at his/her cards prior to bidding, bidding blind for that round is not an option. There is no limit to the number of players that can bid blind and the order of blind bidding follows the same order as regular bidding (e.g., clockwise, starting to the left of the dealer). If the player bidding blind makes his bid, the player gets a bonus of twenty points instead of ten points. If the dealer bids blind and the other players bidding forces the dealer off the blind bid, 1 (one) addition trick is added to the dealer's blind bid. Blind bidding is significant in Prospect Oh Hell since Prospect, and all sanctioned WPOHL games, are played for money.\n*'''UL Scoring''' (Pronounced \"ool\"): Players begin at one card and work their way up to the maximum number of cards possible. Whoever is trailing at the top of the game is declared the Ultimate Loser and must perform an interpretive dance to a song of the group's choosing. Very effective for rooting out prospective suitors. Practiced in the 90s in New York City.\n*'''Basas Scoring''': '''see gameplay above''' Basas begins by all players choosing a dare that the loser must complete at the end of the game. Each round starts with a betting phase, during which each player will claim how many tricks they will take that round. The betting of how many tricks each player will take starts by a different player each round (rotates clockwise). The final player betting cannot claim a number of tricks that makes the total number of bets add up to the round's number. At the end of each round, scores are updated. If a player takes the exact number of tricks (n) that they claimed in the betting phase, they get (n)^2 + 10 points. If they miss their bet, they lose 3*( | (n) - (actual tricks taken) | ) points. Special scoring: in the last rounds (when all of the cards are dealt), a player can go nil. If they succeed, they get +35 points. If they do not, they lose 10 points. Additionally, if a player renegs, another player can call the person out. If it is verified that the player who reneged did so, the transgression costs the player 50 points and the round is replayed. If a player accuses another of reneging, and it is verified that the player did not reneg, the accuser loses 25 points and the round continues and is not replayed. At the end of all rounds, the player with the lowest number of points loses and must complete the dare.\n*'''Stackpot''': If you win the exact number of tricks bid, you get one point plus a variable bonus per trick you bid (the trick bonus starts at 0). If you fail, you lose one point per trick that was in the hand. The highest possible value of the sum of everyone's score at the end of any hand is 0 (since at least 1 person will fail each round) in which case the trick bonus for next hand will be 0. If the sum is negative however, the absolute value will increase the bonus for subsequent hands. For example, if the sum of all scores is -20 and the number of tricks for next hand is 9, the bonus per trick will be 2 (20 divided by 9, rounded down), increasing next hand's points per trick to 3. This scoring system is ideal for betting, since players can bring a pile of cash to the table, and the negative points will be \"unwon money\" that remains on the table, stacked in a pot. The scoring model was invented by the online game room Hell Club.<ref>https://hell.club/faq/why-is-the-stackpot-concept-a-better-scoring-system/</ref>\n\n==Names==\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2017}}\nOh Hell is known by many names, including:\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n*10-9-8\n*a giggity (Michigan)\n*Afghanistan\n*Basas (in [[Mexico]])\n*''Beredskap'' ({{lang-sv|preparedness}})\n*Biskauer (in [[Cyprus]])\n*Bondebridge (Norway)\n*Box (Archibald's in Richmond Hill, Ont.\n*Buddit or Butted (on [[Long Island, NY]])\n*Bugger it (in [[Australia]])\n*Bugger Your Neighbour\n*Bumble\n*Burn Your Neighbor\n*Burn Your Baby\n*CARL Sucks\n*Contract Whist\n*Count Down\n*Crush\n*Cut-throat Bridge\n*Dang Shoot (in [[Racine, WI]])\n*The Dumb Game (in [[Syracuse, NY]])\n*Dentist's Comfort\n*Diminishing Bridge\n*Diminishing Sequence\n*Diminishing Whist\n*Disappearing Tens\n*Donut (in [[Canoe Lake, Canada]])\n*El Partido (Uruguayans in Melbourne, Australia)\n*Elevator<ref>https://www.pagat.com/exact/ohhell.html</ref>\n*Erection (Northern Michigan) \n*Estimate (in [[India]])\n*Estimation (in [[Egypt]])\n*Fingers In\n*Fodinha (in [[Brazil]])\n*F*** your Buddy\n*Gary's Game\n*German Bridge (in [[Hong Kong]])\n*Get Fred\n*Goodluck\n*Go to Heck Bridge\n*Go to Hell Bridge\n*Habanero\n*Hell Yeah\n*Judgement (in India)\n*Kachuful (in India)\n*Knights of Columbus (in [[Wigan]])\n*Knock Bridge (Southern Minnesota)\n*Louie (in New Jersey)\n*''Juego de Daniel''\n*Madison Countdown\n*Moon oh\n*Mormon Bridge\n*''Nah Pearse''\n*Niggle\n*Nomination Whist\n*Number Deal\n*O'Hell\n*O'Shay\n*Oh Blanchard\n*Oh Heck\n*Oh Merde (French Canadian)\n*Oh Petunia\n*Oh Pshaw<ref>Hoyle, p. 216, Ballantine Books; Reissue edition (Aug 27 1996) {{ISBN|978-0-449-91156-3}}</ref>\n*Oh Shuckins (Western North Carolina)\n*Oh Well\n*Old Hell\n*Orlando-Tallahassee\n*Osha\n*Oy Vey\n*Peanuts\n*''Plump'' ({{lang-sv|blob}})\n*Pooch (in [[Montreal, Canada]])\n*Prediction Whist\n*Pyramid\n*Quasimodo\n*Quesadilla (in [[California]])\n*Rats (in Northwestern Ohio and Southern Michigan)\n*Rat Fink, also Rat F*** (widespread in American colleges)\n*Reddis\n*Ri-ki-ki (in Hungary)\n*Sausages\n*Scratch\n*Screw The Dealer\n*Screw Your Neighbor\n*Selbubridge (Norway)\n*Shit on Your Neighbor\n*Sod-it\n*Stinky Fingers\n*Stonecutters Revenge (Edgemont, Calgary)\n*Ten And Back or Tennaback\n*Tens\n*Ten Down\n*Ten Up Ten Down (Wisconsin)\n*The Blank You Say\n*Up and Down the River (also in Russia)\n*Up Down\n*Up the River\n*Upsy Downsy\n*Up to 7 and back\n*Vanishing Whist\n*Weetabix\n*Wiggly Diggle\n*Wiggly Diggly\n*Wizard (in [[Spain]] and [[Germany]])\n*You Bastard (in [[Canada]] and [[Australia]])\n* You Dick (in [[United States]])\n{{div col end}}\n*Zonk\n*Zero Daav (in Maharashtra, India)\n*Oh Mierda\n\n===Dutch names===\nBoerenbridge, Boerenlullen, Chinees poepen, Chinees dekken, Chinees bridgen, Koreaanse poker, 10 op en neer, jodelen, pronostieken, Slagenvragen, Hellen, Bollen, op-en-affen, Afrikaans beffen.\n\n==See also==\n*[[All in the Family Archie Bunker's card game]]\n*[[Bid whist]]\n*[[Knock-out Whist]]\n*[[Oh Hell - 500]]\n*[[Wizard (card game)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://articles.philly.com/1992-03-15/news/26018607_1_card-game-canasta-mathews-home \"For Family, Card Game Trumps All Others No, The Game Isn't Bridge, But Oh Hell.

Unlike [[contract bridge]] and [[Spades (card game)|spades]], taking more tricks than bid is a loss. It was first described by B. C. Westall around 1930.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parlett|first=David|title=Oxford Dictionary of Card Games|year=1996|p=176|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-869173-4}}</ref>\n\n==Concept==\nThe game of Oh Hell explores the idea of taking an exact number of tricks specified by a bid before the hand. It differs from other trick-taking games in that players play a fixed number of hands. The game uses [[Trump (card games)|trumps]], often decided by a cut of the deck after the hand's cards have been distributed.\n\nLike many popular social card games, Oh Hell has many local variants, in both rules and names.\n\n==Famous players==\nProminent players of Oh Hell include former President [[Bill Clinton]], who learned it from [[Steven Spielberg]].<ref>https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/09/18/the-wanderer-3</ref>\n\n==Rules==\nThere are many variations to this game; a common set of regulations is given here.\n\nOh Hell can be played with almost any number of players (3+) although 4-7 is considered optimal. The game is played using a standard 52-card deck, with ace (A) being the highest rank, two (2) the lowest. With six or more players, the game can be played with two decks combined or with a 63-card deck from six-player [[500 card game|500]].\n\nA game consists of a fixed number of hands, and each hand consists of dealing a certain number of cards to each player, depending on the variation and the number of players. During a hand, each player bids for a number of tricks, then attempts to take exactly that many tricks during the hand.\n\nThe dealer (initially determined by [[cut (cards)|cutting cards]]) deals out the cards one by one, starting with the player to his left, in a clockwise direction, until the required number of cards has been dealt. After the dealing is complete, the next card is turned face up, and the suit of this card determines the trump suit for the deal, which is why only up to 12 cards are dealt in a four-player match. (If there are no unused cards, the largest hand is played without a trump suit. Alternatively, the maximal round trump suit can be determined in a variety of ways: for instance, by revealing the dealer's last card as in [[whist]], by cutting the pack before dealing, or the dealer can decide the trump before seeing his own cards.)\n\nEach player now bids for the number of tricks he believes he can win. The player to the left of the dealer bids first. Bidding is unrestricted except for the ''screw the dealer'' rule: the number of tricks bid cannot equal the number available. That is, every deal must in total be either overbid or underbid. For example, if five cards are dealt, and the first three bids are two, zero and one, then the dealer may not bid two. However, if five cards are dealt, and the first three bids are three, one and two, then the dealer is free to make any bid. (The \"screw the dealer\" rule is not used in the version played in West Virginia, South Carolina, rural Maryland, and Pennsylvania, with the dealer being free to make any bid.) In an alternative style of bidding, all players simultaneously hold out fingers for the number of tricks they want to bid (similar in style to a [[rock paper scissors]] shoot). The players' bids are recorded on the score sheet.\n\nWhen every player has made a bid, the player to the left of the dealer makes the opening lead. Play then proceeds as usual in a [[trick-taking game]], with each player in turn playing one card. Players must follow suit, unless they have no cards of the led suit, in which case they may play any card. The highest card of the led suit wins the trick unless [[ruff (cards)|ruffed]], when the highest trump card wins.\n\nIn multi-deck games, the first of identical cards to be played (say two queens of clubs) wins the trick. In a more complicated variant, identical cards cancel each other, leading to the possibility (if the number of players is even) of an entire trick being canceled out.\n\nThe player who wins the trick leads to the next trick.\n\n==Number of hands per game==\n* In the '''British''' variation of the game,<ref>Penguin Encyclopedia of Card Games, p. 86, David Parlett - Penguin Books 1979 {{ISBN|0-14-028032-4}}</ref> the first hand is played with one card dealt to each player. On each succeeding deal one more card is dealt out to each player, until there are not enough cards for another round.\n* In another version of the British variant, once the full number of cards have been dealt out the number of cards per player ''decreases'' by one every round until back down to one card. The game is complete when the last round (with one card per player) has been played. A sub-variation for a small number of players (three or four) uses a step in the jump, such as three players opting for the pattern to be 1-3-5-7-9-11-13-15-13-11-9-7-5-3-1. Another variation consists of the pattern 12-11-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12, though this version takes longer to play: in a 4-player game, starting from \"1\" deals a total of 144 tricks, while starting from \"12\" yields 155 tricks. This also assumes using the entire 52-card deck, not an abbreviated game. \n* Yet another variation, played extensively in American colleges, begins with the \"1\" hand, then climbs up to the \"10\" hand before descending back down to a \"1\" hand. This version, referred to by students as \"Rats!\", \"Rat Fink\", and sometimes \"Rat Fuck\", is well suited for up to five players; since at its maximum it accounts for 50 of the 52 cards, with the \"10\" hand's trump suit determined from one of the remaining two cards. \n* The '''Diminishing Bridge''' variation begins with the maximum hand size and counts down.\n* In the '''Devil's Bridge''' variation, for the 1-card hand each player holds their own card on their forehead and looks at the other players' cards, rather than their own, to bid.\n* The '''Basas''' variation plays as the British version. Because there is no remainder card defining the trump suit in the last 4 rounds, the trump suit is auctioned in a manner similar to bridge. However, there is no hierarchy of suits, and a higher bid must be numerically higher. In Basas, if a player does not have a card of the suit with which the round was opened, ''they are required'' to play a trump. It is only if they do not have a trump that they may play any other card.\n\n==Cooperative version==\nIn this variant, all bids must add up exactly to the number of cards dealt for that round. Players must then \"make it work\" to move on to the next round. If anyone takes more or less than their bid, the deal moves to the left and the round is re-dealt. With four players, a second deck may be used to specify the round to be played\u2014the value of the upcard determines the number of cards dealt and the suit determines the trump suit for the round.\n\n==Prospect version==\nThis variant is played for money. Prior to dealing the first hand, players agree on the amount of money the \u201closers\u201d will have to pay to the winner. The last place finisher pays the most and the second-place finisher pays the least. The sliding scale in the Prospect version keeps all the players invested in the outcome of every hand, since their finishing rank corresponds to how much money they will owe the winner.\n\n==Tournaments==\nThe '''WPOHL (World Prospect Oh Hell League) Championship''' is usually held in December in [[Rehoboth Beach, Delaware]], using \u201cProspect\u201d rules. The deal begins with 10 cards, plays down to 1, then back up to 10 for a total of 19 hands per round. Depending on the size of the field, the five or ten lowest scoring players in the room are eliminated each round until there is a five-person \"final table.\"\n\nIn the early 1990s, the '''International Oh-Hell League's annual Championship Tournament of All Creation''' was held each March in the Fire Hall of [[Riverton, New Jersey]]. This yearly tournament lasted for over 20 years. Players vied for nominal, but not actual, possession of the league trophy, a two-inch bronze reproduction of the [[Manneken Pis]], which resided permanently in the home of tournament founder, John B. \"Jack\" Mathews. Alcohol was off-limits, but profanity was encouraged. A full table consisted of four players. Play began with a one-card hand, went up to 13, then back down to one for a total of 25 hands. In each hand, except the 13th when the entire deck was dealt, the first undealt card was turned over to establish the trump suit. The tournament entry fee was $5 and included complimentary hot dogs, doughnuts, and Tak-a-Boost (the official drink of the International Oh-Hell League). The tournament was a grueling all-day affair. All players had to commit to playing at least three games. Cumulative tabulation of the end scores from the first three-rounds allowed the top eight highest scoring players to move on to the semi-finals. The semi-finals portion of the tournament was where the commitment to play ended. If a semi-final eligible player could not or did not wish to continue, the player with the next highest cumulative score was offered the seat. The drawing of cards determined random seeding for the semi-final tables. The first and second place players at each semi-final table advanced to the finals, where the top-scoring player in this last game was the tournament winner. Consolation games and clean up by any remaining players were encouraged while waiting for the outcome of the tournament. For a period, the International Oh-Hell League was a registered corporation.\n\nThe Annual '''Cartier 'Oh Hell!' Tournament''' began in 1995. The tournament formula was created by Tessa Kennedy and Tomasz Starzewski. [[Cartier Ltd.]] sponsors the tournament with all money raised going to charity.\n*Players choose trump (not a random card), and 4 players constitute a full table.\n*Each game is 23 hands from 13 cards each down to 2 cards each and from 3 cards back up to 13. Players alternate as Dealer in a clockwise direction. One player is nominated as scorer.\n*The person with the highest number of bids names the trump suit which can be any of the four suits or \"no trumps.\"\n* Two decks of cards are assigned to each table. As one deck is dealt, the other is shuffled for the following hand, by the player sitting opposite the dealer. Players pick a random card from the deck to select the Dealer for the first hand (highest card is first Dealer).\n* The tournament is played with 32 people. The first round has all 32 people playing on 8 tables of 4 players each. The winner and first runner up from each table go on to play in the second round. The second round is therefore played with 16 people on 4 tables of 4 players. First round winners and runners-up are split up so they do not play each other again in the second round. The single winner from each table then goes on to the final table of four players. The winner is the tournament champion.\n\n==Scoring==\nThere are several alternative methods of scoring:\n* '''Basic scoring''': Each player scores 1 point for each trick he/she takes. A player that wins the exact number of tricks bid receives an additional 10 points for making the contract. Players who miss their contract are thus encouraged to take as many tricks as possible, which results in other players also missing their contracts.\n* '''Variant basic scoring''': As with Basic Scoring each player scores 1 point for each trick he/she takes however a player that wins the exact number of tricks bid receives an additional 5 points for making the contract. This makes the game closer when there are a large number of players and encourages players to bid more than 0 tricks as much as possible.\n* '''Exact scoring''': A player who makes the exact number of tricks bid scores 10 plus the amount bid. Players who overbid or underbid score nothing.\n* '''Exact scoring with penalty''': A player who makes the exact number of tricks bid scores 10 plus the amount bid. Players who underbid are deducted points in the amount of the bid. (Missing a 3 bid scores -3; missing a zero bid scores 0.) Used in the Hassenpfeffer variant.\n* '''10 times exact scoring''': Similar to Exact scoring, with or without penalty, but each trick bid is worth 10 points; a player who bids 4 is awarded 40 points for exactly making the bid and scores either zero or -40 if he does not make the contract. Variants of this also put a 5-point value on bidding ZERO - negative 5 if you take a trick, positive 5 if you don't take any tricks.\n* '''Double Whammy''': Played like basic scoring, except that a successful 1-bid earns 15 points, a successful 2-bid earns 22, and further successive bids are awarded in multiples of 11 (33 for 3, 44 for 4, etc.). This variation may be played in the second half of an otherwise regular game, if desired.\n* '''Penalty under, Zero Over''': A variation of exact scoring that combines variants with and without penalties; overtricking scores zero points while undertricking results in a penalty according to the specific exact scoring variant used. This promotes \"sacrificing\" one's own contract by severely overtricking in order to \"set\" someone else.\n* '''Exact scoring with penalty where points are multiples of 5''': A player who makes the exact number of tricks bid scores 10 plus the amount bid multiplied by 5. Players who underbid are deducted points in the amount of the bid multiplied by 5. (Missing a 3 bid scores (3*(-5))=-15; missing a zero bid scores -10. Making a 5 scores (10+5*5)=35) Used in the Cypriot variant. This variant encourages high bidding due to the number of possible points to gain.\n* '''Exact scoring with set penalty''': A player who makes the exact number of tricks bid scores 10 plus the amount bid. Players who underbid score only one point for each trick. Players who overbid have \"gone set\" and lose 10 points, regardless of the number of tricks taken. For example, if a player who has bid four takes exactly 4 tricks, he scores 14. If he takes 5 tricks, he scores 5. If he takes 3 tricks, he scores -10.\n* '''Exact scoring with progressive penalty''': A player who makes the exact number of tricks bid scores 10 plus the amount bid. Players who underbid or overbid lose the amount of the bid, plus ten points for each trick under or overbid. For example, a player bids 4: If he takes exactly 4 tricks, he scores 14. If he takes 3 or 5 tricks, he scores -14. If he takes 2 or 6 tricks, he scores -24. This variation makes it easier to \"pile on the leader\" and eliminate even a large lead in just one hand.\n* '''Reduced 0 bid''': Similar to basic (or exact) scoring, with the modification that making a zero contract scores only five points. (Zero bids are often the easiest to make.)\n* '''Adjusted 0 bid''': Similar to basic scoring, with the change that a zero bid is worth five plus the number of cards dealt out to a player. For example, in the first round, a successful zero bid is worth 6 points, while a successful one bid is worth 11 points. (Zero bids are harder to make in larger hands.)\n* '''Progressive scoring''': As in basic scoring, a player that fails to make the contract receives a number of points equal to the number of tricks he takes. However, a successful bid is worth the 10-point threshold plus the ''square'' of the bid, thereby rewarding a person bidding and making four tricks with 26 (10 plus 16) points. This has the advantage of rewarding riskier bids, and making it possible for someone to catch up from behind more easily.\n* '''Simplified / Montreal progressive scoring''': Each player receives 10 points for satisfying the contract plus twice the number of tricks taken, otherwise they receive zero points.\n* '''Negative scoring''': The scoring system is reversed, as in [[golf]], lowest score winning. Satisfying the contract scores zero points. The first undertrick or overtrick costs one point, and each additional undertrick/overtrick costs a point more than the one before it. For instance, 3 overtricks would add 6 points (the sum of 1, 2, and 3) to a player's total. This rewards sacrifices, for it is now often beneficial to risk an overtrick (1 point) to cost a person that is already down to get an additional undertrick (which will cost many more points).\n* '''Simplified negative scoring''': Each player scores the square of the number of overtricks or undertricks taken.\n* '''Variant negative scoring''': Each player who fails to satisfy the contract scores points according to the number of total tricks in that round (e.g., in a round where there were five total tricks, every unsuccessful player scores 5).\n* '''Spades double''': In variations where the trump card is chosen randomly, some play that if a spade is turned up, the points for that round double.\n* '''Trick scoring''': Each player that scores the number of tricks bid receives that many points, with the exception of correctly bidding 0, in which case the player receives a half point. Any overbid or underbid loses the number of points their bid was off (a player bidding 3 tricks that wins only 2 would lose a point, as would a player bidding 2 and winning 3).\n* '''Binary scoring''': A player who makes the exact number of tricks bid scores 10. Players who overbid or underbid score nothing.\n* '''Binary scoring with nil rule''': A player who makes the exact number of tricks bid scores 10. If the number of tricks exceeds the number of players, players who bid nil (zero) score 20 if they take no tricks, otherwise -10.\n* '''Binary scoring with increasing penalty''': A player who makes the exact number of tricks bid scores 8. Players who overbid or underbid have their score cut in half, (rounding up).\n* '''Scratch / Quick scoring''': Players who overbid or underbid get a scratch (signified by crossing through their unsuccessful bid). The person with the least scratches wins the game. In the event of a tie, the tied player who bid the most wins the game (This is done by adding up each tied-player's successful bids.)\n* '''Adjusted exact scoring''': A player who makes the exact number of tricks receives that number of points plus the number of cards dealt out to a player.\n* '''Get Fred / Oy Vey scoring''': A player who makes the exact number of tricks receives that number of points plus 10. Players who miss the contract lose the difference between the bid and the number of tricks taken. Thus, a player who bids three and takes either two or four tricks will lose one point. (In the Oy Vey variant, if many players are playing, often a successful bid is worth the 10-point threshold plus the ''square'' of the bid. This lifts the scores in the game, as in general the more players participate, the lower the scores are.)\n* '''Novacastrian scoring''': A player who makes the exact number of tricks receives that number of points. Players who overbid lose the number of points they bid for that hand. Players who underbid lose the number of tricks they've taken that hand. A player's score will change by at least the number bid and by at least the number of tricks they take.\n* '''Gentleman scoring''': A player who makes the contract scores the number of tricks bid times 10, unless he/she bid zero, in which case the player scores 5. If a player fails to make the contract and takes overtrick(s), he/she scores the number of tricks taken. If a player has overbid, he/she scores the difference between tricks bid and tricks taken times -10.\n* '''Variable bonus scoring''': Each player scores one point for each trick taken, plus a variable bonus if the player takes the exact number of tricks bid. The bonus numerically decreases as the number of cards increases (and vice versa), meaning that when there are more tricks available in a round (and thereby a greater chance of successfully achieving the bid), there are less bonus points on offer. For example, in a game where the dealing pattern is 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1, the bonus points available in each successive round would be 8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8.\n* '''Penalty Scoring''': A player who makes the contract scores 10 points + 5 points for each trick made. If the bidder makes more or fewer tricks than were bid, he/she loses 10 points for the first over or under trick + 15 points for each additional over or under trick.\n* '''Bidding Blind''': Blind bids are unique to the '''Prospect version''' of Oh Hell. If a player falls 20 points, or more, behind the leader at the end of a round (e.g., Player 1 has 15 points and Player 2 is the leader with 35 points) the player that is behind can enter a blind bid by bidding prior to looking at any of his cards, and prior to anyone else bidding. Bidding Blind is optional, and can be done multiple times as long as the player continues to be eligible after each round. If a player looks at his/her cards prior to bidding, bidding blind for that round is not an option. There is no limit to the number of players that can bid blind and the order of blind bidding follows the same order as regular bidding (e.g., clockwise, starting to the left of the dealer). If the player bidding blind makes his bid, the player gets a bonus of twenty points instead of ten points. If the dealer bids blind and the other players bidding forces the dealer off the blind bid, 1 (one) addition trick is added to the dealer's blind bid. Blind bidding is significant in Prospect Oh Hell since Prospect, and all sanctioned WPOHL games, are played for money.\n*'''UL Scoring''' (Pronounced \"ool\"): Players begin at one card and work their way up to the maximum number of cards possible. Whoever is trailing at the top of the game is declared the Ultimate Loser and must perform an interpretive dance to a song of the group's choosing. Very effective for rooting out prospective suitors. Practiced in the 90s in New York City.\n*'''Basas Scoring''': '''see gameplay above''' Basas begins by all players choosing a dare that the loser must complete at the end of the game. Each round starts with a betting phase, during which each player will claim how many tricks they will take that round. The betting of how many tricks each player will take starts by a different player each round (rotates clockwise). The final player betting cannot claim a number of tricks that makes the total number of bets add up to the round's number. At the end of each round, scores are updated. If a player takes the exact number of tricks (n) that they claimed in the betting phase, they get (n)^2 + 10 points. If they miss their bet, they lose 3*( | (n) - (actual tricks taken) | ) points. Special scoring: in the last rounds (when all of the cards are dealt), a player can go nil. If they succeed, they get +35 points. If they do not, they lose 10 points. Additionally, if a player renegs, another player can call the person out. If it is verified that the player who reneged did so, the transgression costs the player 50 points and the round is replayed. If a player accuses another of reneging, and it is verified that the player did not reneg, the accuser loses 25 points and the round continues and is not replayed. At the end of all rounds, the player with the lowest number of points loses and must complete the dare.\n*'''Stackpot''': If you win the exact number of tricks bid, you get one point plus a variable bonus per trick you bid (the trick bonus starts at 0). If you fail, you lose one point per trick that was in the hand. The highest possible value of the sum of everyone's score at the end of any hand is 0 (since at least 1 person will fail each round) in which case the trick bonus for next hand will be 0. If the sum is negative however, the absolute value will increase the bonus for subsequent hands. For example, if the sum of all scores is -20 and the number of tricks for next hand is 9, the bonus per trick will be 2 (20 divided by 9, rounded down), increasing next hand's points per trick to 3. This scoring system is ideal for betting, since players can bring a pile of cash to the table, and the negative points will be \"unwon money\" that remains on the table, stacked in a pot. The scoring model was invented by the online game room Hell Club.<ref>https://hell.club/faq/why-is-the-stackpot-concept-a-better-scoring-system/</ref>\n\n==Names==\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2017}}\nOh Hell is known by many names, including:\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n*10-9-8\n*a giggity (Michigan)\n*Afghanistan\n*Basas (in [[Mexico]])\n*''Beredskap'' ({{lang-sv|preparedness}})\n*Biskauer (in [[Cyprus]])\n*Bondebridge (Norway)\n*Box (Archibald's in Richmond Hill, Ont.\n*Buddit or Butted (on [[Long Island, NY]])\n*Bugger it (in [[Australia]])\n*Bugger Your Neighbour\n*Bumble\n*Burn Your Neighbor\n*Burn Your Baby\n*Contract Whist\n*Count Down\n*Crush\n*Cut-throat Bridge\n*Dang Shoot (in [[Racine, WI]])\n*The Dumb Game (in [[Syracuse, NY]])\n*Dentist's Comfort\n*Diminishing Bridge\n*Diminishing Sequence\n*Diminishing Whist\n*Disappearing Tens\n*Donut (in [[Canoe Lake, Canada]])\n*El Partido (Uruguayans in Melbourne, Australia)\n*Elevator<ref>https://www.pagat.com/exact/ohhell.html</ref>\n*Erection (Northern Michigan) \n*Estimate (in [[India]])\n*Estimation (in [[Egypt]])\n*Fingers In\n*Fodinha (in [[Brazil]])\n*F*** your Buddy\n*Gary's Game\n*German Bridge (in [[Hong Kong]])\n*Get Fred\n*Goodluck\n*Go to Heck Bridge\n*Go to Hell Bridge\n*Habanero\n*Hell Yeah\n*Judgement (in India)\n*Kachuful (in India)\n*Knights of Columbus (in [[Wigan]])\n*Knock Bridge (Southern Minnesota)\n*Louie (in New Jersey)\n*''Juego de Daniel''\n*Madison Countdown\n*Moon oh\n*Mormon Bridge\n*''Nah Pearse''\n*Niggle\n*Nomination Whist\n*Number Deal\n*O'Hell\n*O'Shay\n*Oh Blanchard\n*Oh Heck\n*Oh Merde (French Canadian)\n*Oh Petunia\n*Oh Pshaw<ref>Hoyle, p. 216, Ballantine Books; Reissue edition (Aug 27 1996) {{ISBN|978-0-449-91156-3}}</ref>\n*Oh Shuckins (Western North Carolina)\n*Oh Well\n*Old Hell\n*Orlando-Tallahassee\n*Osha\n*Oy Vey\n*Peanuts\n*''Plump'' ({{lang-sv|blob}})\n*Pooch (in [[Montreal, Canada]])\n*Prediction Whist\n*Pyramid\n*Quasimodo\n*Quesadilla (in [[California]])\n*Rats (in Northwestern Ohio and Southern Michigan)\n*Rat Fink, also Rat F*** (widespread in American colleges)\n*Reddis\n*Ri-ki-ki (in Hungary)\n*Sausages\n*Scratch\n*Screw The Dealer\n*Screw Your Neighbor\n*Selbubridge (Norway)\n*Shit on Your Neighbor\n*Sod-it\n*Stinky Fingers\n*Stonecutters Revenge (Edgemont, Calgary)\n*Ten And Back or Tennaback\n*Tens\n*Ten Down\n*Ten Up Ten Down (Wisconsin)\n*The Blank You Say\n*Up and Down the River (also in Russia)\n*Up Down\n*Up the River\n*Upsy Downsy\n*Up to 7 and back\n*Vanishing Whist\n*Weetabix\n*Wiggly Diggle\n*Wiggly Diggly\n*Wizard (in [[Spain]] and [[Germany]])\n*You Bastard (in [[Canada]] and [[Australia]])\n* You Dick (in [[United States]])\n{{div col end}}\n*Zonk\n*Zero Daav (in Maharashtra, India)\n*Oh Mierda\n\n===Dutch names===\nBoerenbridge, Boerenlullen, Chinees poepen, Chinees dekken, Chinees bridgen, Koreaanse poker, 10 op en neer, jodelen, pronostieken, Slagenvragen, Hellen, Bollen, op-en-affen, Afrikaans beffen.\n\n==See also==\n*[[All in the Family Archie Bunker's card game]]\n*[[Bid whist]]\n*[[Knock-out Whist]]\n*[[Oh Hell - 500]]\n*[[Wizard (card game)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://articles.philly.com/1992-03-15/news/26018607_1_card-game-canasta-mathews-home \"For Family, Card Game Trumps All Others No, The Game Isn't Bridge, But Oh Hell.

In [[Arabic]], the form ''Ludhriq'' (\u0644\u0630\u0631\u064a\u0642), used to refer [[Roderic]] (Ulfilan Gothic ''*Hro\u00feareiks''), the last king of the Visigoths. [[Saint Roderick]] (d. 857) is one of the [[Martyrs of C\u00f3rdoba]].\n\nThe modern English name does not continue the Anglo-Saxon form but was re-introduced from the continent by the [[Norman England|Normans]]. The Middle English given name had also virtually disappeared by the 19th century, even though it had survived as a surname. The given name was re-popularised  by [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s poem ''[[The Vision of Don Roderick]]'' (1811), where ''Roderick'' refers to the [[Roderic|Visigothic king]]. The modern English name is sometimes abbreviated to [[Roddy]].\n\n''Roderick'' is also an [[Anglicisation]] of several unrelated names. As a surname and given name it is an Anglicised form of the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''[[Rhydderch (disambiguation)|Rhydderch]]''.

{"title_page": "List of Hikaru no Go characters", "text_new": "{{unreferenced|date=May 2017}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Hikaru no Go'' characters}}\nThe plot of ''[[Hikaru no Go]]'' revolves around the Japanese Go world. Several of the manga's prominent characters hold Go titles. The title holder is then called by a combination of their name and the title they hold. In the case of a multiple title holder the most prestigious title they hold is used. The 7 major titles mentioned are [[Kisei (go)|Kisei]], [[Meijin (go)|Meijin]], [[Honinbo Tournament|Honinb\u014d]], [[Judan (Go)|J\u016bdan]], [[Tengen (Go)|Tengen]], [[\u014cza]], and [[Gosei (competition)|Gosei]].\n\n==Main characters==\n===Hikaru Shindo===\n;{{anchor|Hikaru}}{{Nihongo|Hikaru Shindo|\u9032\u85e4 \u30d2\u30ab\u30eb|Shind\u014d Hikaru}}\n{{voiced by|[[Tomoko Kawakami]]|[[Samuel Vincent]]}}\n\nHikaru is the Main Protagonist of Hikaru no Go and a sixth grader in elementary school. An important factor in the development of Hikaru's passion for Go is an encounter early on in which Hikaru becomes the rival of Go prodigy Akira Toya. At first, he thinks that Go is just for old folks and he is annoyed at Sai's demand to play, but little by little his passion for Go increases as he plays more and more. From being a member of a school Go club to becoming an Insei and finally a professional Go player (at 14 years old) a year after Akira, Hikaru matures throughout the course of the series. Throughout the series, Hikaru gets older in age as the series follow him from 6th grade to high school. Hikaru is often portrayed wearing clothing having the numeral \"5\". This is a pun on the Japanese word for five: \u4e94, which is pronounced ''go''. Part of his strength is his ability to read far into the game very fast, and to make seemingly stupid moves, which, in fact, lure the opponent to playing what looks like the obviously correct move, which Hikaru then uses against them.\n\n===Fujiwara no <!--VIZ volumes use Fujiwara no Sai-->Sai===\n;{{anchor|Fujiwara}}{{Nihongo|Fujiwara no Sai|\u85e4\u539f\u4f50\u70ba}}\n{{voiced by|[[Susumu Chiba]]|[[Brad Swaile]]}}\n\nA spirit from the Heian era of Japan and mentor of Hikaru Shindo. Once the Go instructor to the Emperor, Sai continually plays Go, his goal being to one day play the [[divine move]]. Sai's ghost had previously possessed the real-life figure [[Honinbo Shusaku]] who became a renowned Go player. Sai holds a rivalry towards Koyo Toya and through Hikaru persuades Koyo to have a game with him; with his wish realized when they play a game through the Internet. After the legendary match that ends with Sai's triumph by the narrowest margin (a \u00bd point), Hikaru discovers another move which would have turned the game around. Witnessing Hikaru's maturity, Sai comes to feel that his one-thousand-year time in the world is going to end without his fulfilling his wish of obtaining the divine move; but he reasons that perhaps he was fated to awaken and teach Hikaru, who might obtain it in the future. A few days after the game with Koyo, Sai suddenly disappears as he feared he would. Hikaru was dozing during their last game, so he could neither terminate his last match with Hikaru nor say goodbye to him. Sai is gone, leaving Hikaru depressed and wanting to quit the game. When Hikaru plays Isumi, Hikaru realizes that he will continue to play Go, for Sai lives on in Hikaru's Go. Extremely effeminate by today's standards, Sai is often drawn with traditionally feminine features and mannerisms. Yumi Hotta has joked about fans mistakenly calling him a \"she\" in the \"intermission\" pages of the manga. Sai's extremely emotional behavior is also proper for a Heian male; he sometimes cries copiously in [[Chibi (Japanese term)|chibi]] style, soaking his long sleeves with tears, which in his own time would be respected as a sign of intelligence and sensitivity. His name Fujiwara suggests that he is related to a noble family of extremely high prestige in the Heian period, the [[Fujiwara clan]]. Sai has a high sense of honor, abhorring cheating and bullying.\n\n===Akira Toya===\n;{{anchor|Akira}}{{Nihongo|Akira Toya|\u5854\u77e2 \u30a2\u30ad\u30e9|T\u014dya Akira}}\n{{voiced by|[[Sanae Kobayashi]]|Scott Perrie}}\n\nHikaru's biggest rival and Kaio Middle School student. The son of Koyo Toya, Akira is already playing Go at a professional level when Hikaru first begins playing. Akira is amazed by Hikaru's seemingly impossible ability and becomes obsessed with discovering the secret behind Hikaru's strength. Meanwhile, Hikaru is impressed with how serious and focused Akira is on the game despite only being a 6th grader like him. As the series goes along, the plot brings these two characters together to play each other under different circumstances, each time adding to the mystery.\n\n==Haze Middle School==\n===Akari Fujisaki===\n;{{anchor|Akari}}{{Nihongo|Akari Fujisaki|\u85e4\u5d0e \u3042\u304b\u308a|Fujisaki Akari}}\n{{voiced by|[[Yumi Kakazu]]|[[Chantal Strand]]}}\n\nHikaru's childhood friend. She learns a little bit about Go, when Hikaru becomes interested, and she later joins the Haze Middle School Go club, serving as vice captain of the girls' team, despite her being a weak player. She loves Hikaru, as noted by her two friends and various other characters. Hikaru shows interest in her only little by little, though. The two remain friends throughout the course of the series.\n\n===Kimihiro Tsutsui===\n;{{anchor|Kimihiro}}{{Nihongo|Kimihiro Tsutsui|\u7b52\u4e95 \u516c\u5b8f|Tsutsui Kimihiro}}\n{{voiced by|[[Makoto Tsumura]]|[[Keith Miller (voice actor)|Keith Miller]]}}\n\nCaptain and founder of the Haze Middle School Go Club. Initially he relies on a strategy book, though he has excellent Yose (end game) skills. Kaga persuades him to abandon the book in favor of trusting his strength. When he founded the Haze Middle School Go club he is the only member, but through the efforts of Hikaru and Akari the club grows. Kimihiro graduates from Haze Middle School before his dream of defeating the Kaio Middle School Go club can be realized. \n\n===Tetsuo Kaga===\n;{{anchor|Tetsuo}}{{Nihongo|Tetsuo Kaga|\u52a0\u8cc0 \u9244\u7537|Kaga Tetsuo}}\n{{voiced by|[[Kentar\u014d It\u014d]]|Andrew Toth}}\n\nPresident of Haze Middle School's [[Shogi]] club. Kaga hates Go and prefers Shogi because his father forbade it and forced him to play Go from an extremely early age, and he could never please the old man no matter how well he did, because he always lost to Akira Toya. In a flashback to Kaga's childhood, he is not only defeated by Akira, he feels disrespected by Akira's detached attitude towards his opponents. He still plays Go from time to time to keep his skills limber. During the course of the series, he (along with Kimihiro Tsutsui) graduates from Haze Middle School. \n===Masako Kaneko===\nA player at the Go Club who is also a member of the Volleyball Club\n===Yuki Mitani===\n;{{anchor|Yuki}}{{Nihongo|Yuki Mitani|\u4e09\u8c37 \u7950\u8f1d|Mitani Y\u016bki}}\n{{voiced by|[[Yuu Asakawa]]|[[Cathy Weseluck]]}}\n\nA player at the Go Club at Haze Middle School who overcomes his cheating habit. He is angry at Hikaru for choosing to be an Insei rather than stay at the school Go club when they have a tournament around the corner. Yuki and Hikaru are no longer seen as friends. When After Sai leaves and Hikaru said he wants to stop playing go, Yuki got mad at him because he left the club and got so far he became a pro to catch up to Akira Toya, and now he wants to quit. Yuki remains in the Go club, but only after much convincing.\n\n===Kumiko Tsuda===\n:{{voiced by|[[Akeno Watanabe]]|Justine Wong}}\n\n'''Kumiko Tsuda''' is one of [[Akari Fujisaki]]'s friends and student in [[Haze Middle School]].\n\n===Natsume===\n===Hitoshi Koike===\n==Insei==\n===Yoshitaka Waya===\n;{{anchor|Yoshitaka}}{{Nihongo|Yoshitaka Waya|\u548c\u8c37 \u7fa9\u9ad8|Waya Yoshitaka}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Reiko Takagi]]|[[Matthew Erickson]]}}\n\nHikaru's \"big brother\" [[Insei]]. Like Kaga, he has a dislike for Akira Toya because he can never defeat him and because of what he perceives as Akira's disdain for his opponents. He has once faced Sai in internet Go using the nickname 'zelda.' He becomes a pro (at age 15) in the same year as Hikaru. He is also known to be very reckless and short-tempered, even punching former Insei Mashiba in the face because the latter rattled his friend Isumi.\n\n===Shinichiro Isumi===\n;{{anchor|Shinichiro}}{{Nihongo|Shinichiro Isumi|\u4f0a\u89d2 \u614e\u4e00\u90ce|Isumi Shin'ichir\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kenichi Suzumura]]|[[Kristian Ayre]]}}\n\nAnother Insei friendly with Hikaru, Isumi is the eldest in Hikaru's peer group, turning 18 during the series. He appears to be doing very well in the first pro exam shown, going undefeated until his match with Hikaru. During that match, rumors about Hikaru's incredible strength add to the pressure of time constraints, and he misplaces a stone; his attempt to move the stone after letting go of it prompts his honorable resignation before Hikaru can accuse him of cheating. The match weighs on his mind and he loses his next two games and the chance to become a pro. He later goes to study Go in China in one of the few character arcs in the series that does not center on Hikaru. There, he learns to control his emotions and passes the next year's pro exam without a single loss. Isumi also unknowingly helps Hikaru get over his grief for Sai when their practice game makes Hikaru realize that by playing, he can find Sai within his moves, the Go that Sai passed on to Hikaru.\n\n===Kosuke Ochi===\n;{{anchor|Kosuke}}{{Nihongo|Kosuke Ochi|\u8d8a\u667a \u5eb7\u4ecb|Ochi K\u014dsuke}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Youko Matsuoka]]|Burkley Duffield}}\n\nYet another Insei in the same group as Hikaru, Ochi is one of the youngest (12 years old when introduced), yet very outspoken about his ability. His bragging about his strength hides his insecurity; after each loss he is known to disappear into the restroom for long periods of time. Akira tutors him to find out about Hikaru's current strength. Ochi is unnerved by Hikaru because Akira's obsession about him seems to suggest there is more to Hikaru than what Ochi knows. Ochi is also angry that Akira acknowledges Hikaru as a rival, but not Ochi himself. He demands that Akira view him as a rival if he can defeat Hikaru in the pro exam. Ochi loses to Hikaru, but does pass the pro exam. He comes from a wealthy family, as evidenced by the number of pros that come to his household to tutor him privately in Go.\n\n===Yuta Fukui===\n;{{anchor|Yuta}}{{Nihongo|Yuta Fukui|\u798f\u4e95 \u96c4\u592a|Fukui Y\u016bta}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Wasabi Mizuta]]|[[Nathan Tipple]]}}\n\nNicknamed {{Nihongo|\"Fuku\"|\u30d5\u30af}}, an Insei and classmate of Waya who is known for his extremely fast-paced style of play. Although Waya is the stronger player, he cannot seem to defeat Fuku. Hikaru loses one game to him during the pro exam.\n\n===Asumi Nase===\n;{{anchor|Nase}}{{Nihongo|Asumi Nase|\u5948\u702c \u660e\u65e5\u7f8e|Nase Asumi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Atsuko Enomoto]]|[[Alexandra Carter]]}}\n\nThe only female Insei that has a prominent role in the series.

He eventually became a Professional along with Isumi and Kadowaki.\n\n===Ryo Iijma===\n:{{voiced by|[[Takayuki Yamaguchi (voice actor)|Takayuki Yamaguchi]]|[[Michael Adamthwaite]]}}\n\nRyo Iijima was an insei who notices Hikaru's growth. Iijima was outraged when he learns from Waya that Waya's group helped Hikaru by taking him to Go salons, because of the fact that Hikaru was the whole group's \"competition\" for obtaining the status of a Go professional.

Several of the manga's prominent characters hold Go titles. The title holder is then called by a combination of their name and the title they hold. In the case of a multiple title holder the most prestigious title they hold is used. The 7 major titles mentioned are [[Kisei (go)|Kisei]], [[Meijin (go)|Meijin]], [[Honinbo Tournament|Honinb\u014d]], [[Judan (Go)|J\u016bdan]], [[Tengen (Go)|Tengen]], [[\u014cza]], and [[Gosei (competition)|Gosei]].\n\n==Main characters==\n===Hikaru Shindo===\n;{{anchor|Hikaru}}{{Nihongo|Hikaru Shindo|\u9032\u85e4 \u30d2\u30ab\u30eb|Shind\u014d Hikaru}}\n{{voiced by|[[Tomoko Kawakami]]|[[Samuel Vincent]]}}\n\nHikaru is the Main Protagonist of Hikaru no Go and a sixth grader in elementary school. An important factor in the development of Hikaru's passion for Go is an encounter early on in which Hikaru becomes the rival of Go prodigy Akira Toya. At first, he thinks that Go is just for old folks and he is annoyed at Sai's demand to play, but little by little his passion for Go increases as he plays more and more. From being a member of a school Go club to becoming an Insei and finally a professional Go player (at 14 years old) a year after Akira, Hikaru matures throughout the course of the series. Throughout the series, Hikaru gets older in age as the series follow him from 6th grade to high school. Hikaru is often portrayed wearing clothing having the numeral \"5\". This is a pun on the Japanese word for five: \u4e94, which is pronounced ''go''. Part of his strength is his ability to read far into the game very fast, and to make seemingly stupid moves, which, in fact, lure the opponent to playing what looks like the obviously correct move, which Hikaru then uses against them.\n\n===Fujiwara no <!--VIZ volumes use Fujiwara no Sai-->Sai===\n;{{anchor|Fujiwara}}{{Nihongo|Fujiwara no Sai|\u85e4\u539f\u4f50\u70ba}}\n{{voiced by|[[Susumu Chiba]]|[[Brad Swaile]]}}\n\nA spirit from the Heian era of Japan and mentor of Hikaru Shindo. Once the Go instructor to the Emperor, Sai continually plays Go, his goal being to one day play the [[divine move]]. Sai's ghost had previously possessed the real-life figure [[Honinbo Shusaku]] who became a renowned Go player. Sai holds a rivalry towards Koyo Toya and through Hikaru persuades Koyo to have a game with him; with his wish realized when they play a game through the Internet. After the legendary match that ends with Sai's triumph by the narrowest margin (a \u00bd point), Hikaru discovers another move which would have turned the game around. Witnessing Hikaru's maturity, Sai comes to feel that his one-thousand-year time in the world is going to end without his fulfilling his wish of obtaining the divine move; but he reasons that perhaps he was fated to awaken and teach Hikaru, who might obtain it in the future. A few days after the game with Koyo, Sai suddenly disappears as he feared he would. Hikaru was dozing during their last game, so he could neither terminate his last match with Hikaru nor say goodbye to him. Sai is gone, leaving Hikaru depressed and wanting to quit the game. When Hikaru plays Isumi, Hikaru realizes that he will continue to play Go, for Sai lives on in Hikaru's Go. Extremely effeminate by today's standards, Sai is often drawn with traditionally feminine features and mannerisms. Yumi Hotta has joked about fans mistakenly calling him a \"she\" in the \"intermission\" pages of the manga. Sai's extremely emotional behavior is also proper for a Heian male; he sometimes cries copiously in [[Chibi (Japanese term)|chibi]] style, soaking his long sleeves with tears, which in his own time would be respected as a sign of intelligence and sensitivity. His name Fujiwara suggests that he is related to a noble family of extremely high prestige in the Heian period, the [[Fujiwara clan]]. Sai has a high sense of honor, abhorring cheating and bullying.\n\n===Akira Toya===\n;{{anchor|Akira}}{{Nihongo|Akira Toya|\u5854\u77e2 \u30a2\u30ad\u30e9|T\u014dya Akira}}\n{{voiced by|[[Sanae Kobayashi]]|Scott Perrie}}\n\nHikaru's biggest rival and Kaio Middle School student.

Akira is amazed by Hikaru's seemingly impossible ability and becomes obsessed with discovering the secret behind Hikaru's strength. Meanwhile, Hikaru is impressed with how serious and focused Akira is on the game despite only being a 6th grader like him. As the series goes along, the plot brings these two characters together to play each other under different circumstances, each time adding to the mystery.\n\n==Haze Middle School==\n===Akari Fujisaki===\n;{{anchor|Akari}}{{Nihongo|Akari Fujisaki|\u85e4\u5d0e \u3042\u304b\u308a|Fujisaki Akari}}\n{{voiced by|[[Yumi Kakazu]]|[[Chantal Strand]]}}\n\nHikaru's childhood friend.

Kaga hates Go and prefers Shogi because his father forbade it and forced him to play Go from an extremely early age, and he could never please the old man no matter how well he did, because he always lost to Akira Toya. In a flashback to Kaga's childhood, he is not only defeated by Akira, he feels disrespected by Akira's detached attitude towards his opponents. He still plays Go from time to time to keep his skills limber. During the course of the series, he (along with Kimihiro Tsutsui) graduates from Haze Middle School. \n===Masako Kaneko===\nA player at the Go Club who is also a member of the Volleyball Club\n===Yuki Mitani===\n;{{anchor|Yuki}}{{Nihongo|Yuki Mitani|\u4e09\u8c37 \u7950\u8f1d|Mitani Y\u016bki}}\n{{voiced by|[[Yuu Asakawa]]|[[Cathy Weseluck]]}}\n\nA player at the Go Club at Haze Middle School who overcomes his cheating habit. He is angry at Hikaru for choosing to be an Insei rather than stay at the school Go club when they have a tournament around the corner. Yuki and Hikaru are no longer seen as friends.

He has once faced Sai in internet Go using the nickname 'zelda.' He becomes a pro (at age 15) in the same year as Hikaru. He is also known to be very reckless and short-tempered, even punching former Insei Mashiba in the face because the latter rattled his friend Isumi.\n\n===Shinichiro Isumi===\n;{{anchor|Shinichiro}}{{Nihongo|Shinichiro Isumi|\u4f0a\u89d2 \u614e\u4e00\u90ce|Isumi Shin'ichir\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kenichi Suzumura]]|[[Kristian Ayre]]}}\n\nAnother Insei friendly with Hikaru, Isumi is the eldest in Hikaru's peer group, turning 18 during the series. He appears to be doing very well in the first pro exam shown, going undefeated until his match with Hikaru. During that match, rumors about Hikaru's incredible strength add to the pressure of time constraints, and he misplaces a stone; his attempt to move the stone after letting go of it prompts his honorable resignation before Hikaru can accuse him of cheating. The match weighs on his mind and he loses his next two games and the chance to become a pro. He later goes to study Go in China in one of the few character arcs in the series that does not center on Hikaru. There, he learns to control his emotions and passes the next year's pro exam without a single loss. Isumi also unknowingly helps Hikaru get over his grief for Sai when their practice game makes Hikaru realize that by playing, he can find Sai within his moves, the Go that Sai passed on to Hikaru.\n\n===Kosuke Ochi===\n;{{anchor|Kosuke}}{{Nihongo|Kosuke Ochi|\u8d8a\u667a \u5eb7\u4ecb|Ochi K\u014dsuke}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Youko Matsuoka]]|Burkley Duffield}}\n\nYet another Insei in the same group as Hikaru, Ochi is one of the youngest (12 years old when introduced), yet very outspoken about his ability. His bragging about his strength hides his insecurity; after each loss he is known to disappear into the restroom for long periods of time. Akira tutors him to find out about Hikaru's current strength. Ochi is unnerved by Hikaru because Akira's obsession about him seems to suggest there is more to Hikaru than what Ochi knows. Ochi is also angry that Akira acknowledges Hikaru as a rival, but not Ochi himself. He demands that Akira view him as a rival if he can defeat Hikaru in the pro exam. Ochi loses to Hikaru, but does pass the pro exam. He comes from a wealthy family, as evidenced by the number of pros that come to his household to tutor him privately in Go.\n\n===Yuta Fukui===\n;{{anchor|Yuta}}{{Nihongo|Yuta Fukui|\u798f\u4e95 \u96c4\u592a|Fukui Y\u016bta}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Wasabi Mizuta]]|[[Nathan Tipple]]}}\n\nNicknamed {{Nihongo|\"Fuku\"|\u30d5\u30af}}, an Insei and classmate of Waya who is known for his extremely fast-paced style of play.

Hikaru and Sai later win the money back, and Hikaru uses this to persuade him to join the school Go club. Dake sings romantic songs while playing Go as part of his act to appear like a harmless buffoon, and plays with his right hand (although he is left-handed) to appear clumsy.\n\n===Heihachi Shindo===\n;{{anchor|Heihachi}}{{Nihongo|Heihachi Shindo|\u9032\u85e4 \u5e73\u516b|Shind\u014d Heihachi}}\nHikaru's grandfather, a regional Go champion, who owns the board where Hikaru first discovered Sai. He claims his brother bought the board in an antique shop, intrigued by the rumor that a \"ghost in a tall hat\" would appear from it sometimes.

Hikaru, Waya, and Isumi travel to Go salons to sharpen their skills while they are Insei. In one of them they meet Suyong, whose uncle runs a Go salon, while Su-Yong is on vacation from Korea. At the time, Su-Yong is a Yeon'gusaeng (the Korean equivalent of an Insei), but is disillusioned with playing Go. Heated words between him and Hikaru lead to the two playing an intense, exciting match at the Go salon. Hikaru defeats Su-Yong and this spurs Su-Yong to work harder to become a pro.

{"title_page": "Bridge program (higher education)", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Underlinked|date=February 2013}}\n{{globalize |date= November 2013}}\n}}\n\nA '''Bridge program''' is a formal [[partnership]] between two [[Higher education|post-secondary]] [[university|institutions]] that provides students with advanced standing in a degree program at one institution as recognition of previous academic experience in a similar field of study at another institution. Typically, a bridge program student holds a two-year college degree, and is seeking advancement in their profession by obtaining a four-year or graduate degree.\n\nThis differs from Bridging Programs offered by [[Ontario colleges]] for newcomers to the country. For example, [[Humber College]] in [[Toronto]] offers Bridging Programs for Internationally Trained Engineers and IT Professionals, who are recent [[Immigration|immigrants]] to [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Bridging Programs for Internationally Trained Professionals|url=http://newtocanada.humber.ca/bridging-programs.html||publisher=Humber College|accessdate=2 December 2014}}</ref> These are short-term technical programs offered to professionals who already possess a minimum of a [[bachelor's degree]]. These programs \"bridge\" the gap between a newcomer's prior experience and their future employment in Canada.\n\nMost bridge programs can be categorized into three types of agreements:<ref>Boggs & Trick, 2009, p.5-8</ref>\n\n'''Bilateral''': An agreement outlined between two institutions and two specific programs of similar content. Students are permitted to use some of their initial credits toward the completion of another program at the partner institution. Example: Seneca/York Joint Degrees\n\n'''Multilateral''': An agreement between one institution and several institutions that offer related programs of interest. The completion of one program will directly lead to a specific degree program. Example: The completion of any Ontario Public College Recreation and Leisure Services Diploma and entrance to [[Brock University]]\u2019s Bachelor of Recreation and [[Leisure Studies]]\n\n'''Concurrent''': A collaborative agreement between two institutions, whereby students will work toward two sets of qualifications (such as a diploma and a degree) at the same time, and on the same campus. Example: [[University of Guelph-Humber]].\n\n==History of Bridge Programs in Ontario==\nThe College University Consortium Council (CUCC) was created in 1996 by the [[Ministry of Training, Colleges, and Universities]] as an advisory body to help devise direct transfer routes between post-secondary institutions for all Ontario students. Its mission statement specifies that the main objective of the council is to \u201cfacilitate, promote and coordinate joint education and training ventures that will: aid the transfer of students from sector to sector; facilitate the creation of joint programs between colleges and universities; and further the development of a more seamless continuum of post-secondary education in Ontario.<ref>Renaud, 2009, p. 32</ref> Membership in the council is voluntary for all post-secondary institutions, but is highly encouraged. While the CUCC aims to help institutions create bridge programs, it still maintains that colleges and universities have full autonomy on the specifics of the agreements created.<ref>Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations, 2008, p.3</ref> One of the first projects of the CUCC, was the development of a mutual agreement between Ontario colleges and universities. In 1999, [[List of colleges in Ontario|Ontario colleges]] and universities signed the [http://notes.ocufa.on.ca/OCUFARsrch.nsf/9da1693cdc3d700f852573db006561fc/a1c20db53e8459eb852574cd0069cdd8/$FILE/College,%20University%20Programs%20leading%20to%20Undergraduate%20degrees.pdf Ontario College-University Degree Completion Accord (Port Hope Accord)], which solidified their commitment to create province-wide agreements to help college graduates enter university programs. This Accord was a monumental achievement, as it explicitly stated that a three year college diploma program should provide a student with a minimum of eleven transfer credits (equivalent to at least 2 years of study) toward a four year bachelor\u2019s degree, and a two year diploma program should allow the student to earn six to eight university transfer credits toward a degree (equivalent to 1 or 1.5 years). These minimum requirements were chosen based on the average amount of transfer credits awarded in the past by Registrars\u2019 Offices across Ontario Universities. Within five years of attaining signatures, forty new college-university agreements were made, providing more opportunities for students to attain a comprehensive education.<ref>Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations, 2008, p.2-5</ref>\n\nBy 2005 however, the Bob Rae Report declared that \u201cnowhere near enough progress has been made\u201d because student demand for transfer agreements still overpowered the actual number of diploma to degree programs available. The Report suggested that research must be done to link up related programming between institutions into collaborative degree programs, and create more academic pathways for students to achieve their career goals.<ref>Boggs & Trick, 2009, pg. 1</ref> It also suggested the creation of core, generic courses offered at all institutions that could be instantly transferable in any Ontario diploma or degree program.<ref>Decock,McCloy,Liu,& Hu, 2011, p.3</ref> The Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario was established in the same year as an advisory body to the provincial government, commissioning research on student post-secondary experience and recommendations to improve higher education in Ontario.\n\nTo better serve students interested in researching bridge program pathways, the CUCC made information much more accessible by developing the [http://www.ontransfer.ca Ontario College-University Transfer Guide], an online resource that lists existing agreements between institutions that is searchable by program interest, as well as a detailed explanation of transfer credits granted in each agreement. This online guide will help to promote existing bridge programs in Ontario by providing students, guidance councillors, academic advisors, and parents a comprehensive source for all possible degree program pathways. As of October 2010, there were 514 agreements listed.<ref>Callahan, 2010, p.6</ref>\n\nIn the attempt to make further progress in Ontario's credit transfer policies, the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities established a new coordinating body in 2011 to replace the CUCC. The Ontario Council for Articulation and Transfer (ONCAT) aims to improve transfer pathways for students by focusing on creating multilateral agreements between institutions to maximize the number of transfer credits earned, and the number of students eligible to enrol in bridge programs. It also pledges to create consistency among programs of similar content in the province to help ease student mobility. ONCAT's ultimate goal is to create a transfer model framework that grants all college diploma graduates the possibility to begin a degree program without repeating courses of similar content.\n\n==Limitations to the Creation of Bridge Programs==\n\n===Dualistic post-secondary system===\nThe Ontario college system was created in 1965 as a solution to the growing number of secondary school graduates who could not be sustained by the current post-secondary system. It was developed as a separate pathway from university, with different secondary school prerequisites, that would ultimately lead students to a distinct set of career choices.<ref>Renaud, 2009, p.9</ref> Since the inception of the college system, post-secondary education in Ontario has preserved its separate yet parallel tracks, despite changing demands in the workforce. With the shift of the job market toward hiring employees with bachelor or graduate degrees for occupations that previously accepted college diplomas, it is becoming less and less likely for students to enroll in a diploma program if they cannot be guaranteed entry into a bachelor's program upon completion of their courses.<ref>Renaud, 2009, p.11</ref> Creating mutually beneficial bridge programs between colleges and universities may prove to be difficult, as both systems were created and have since progressed as completely separate entities with distinct policies and curriculum to meet the needs of their student body.\n\n===Misconceptions===\nThrough a series of interviews with senior administrators at colleges and universities throughout Ontario, Danielle Renaud began a preliminary study in the year 2000 to discover the major barriers to collaborative programs between post-secondary institutions. A total of twenty-five colleges and eighteen universities were surveyed. The most commonly perceived obstacle to the creation of bridge programs mentioned by both college and university administrators was the existence of elitist attitudes by some university faculty. The college respondents regarded university faculty as \u201carrogant\u201d and unapproachable, and did not feel confident that their efforts would be positively received. University respondents echoed this statement, admitting that faculty often viewed college programs as a \u201clesser education\u201d and that this stereotypical mindset would be difficult to overcome.<ref>Renaud, 2009, p.74</ref> University faculty may be hesitant to approach the subject of collaborative agreements with college diploma programs because they do not view it as a relationship that will benefit the reputation of their own institution. They continue to view colleges in their traditional role as a preparation for the workplace, and feel as though they must protect the integrity of a university education by remaining a separate entity.<ref>Renaud, 2009, p.76</ref> On the other hand, many college faculty are also fearful of an impending union with universities, as they are concerned that they will be swallowed by the larger institution and lose their voice in the decision making process. They value their programming and presume that the universities will be unwilling to make compromises when it comes to creating program parameters.<ref>Renaud, 2009, p.79</ref>\n\n===Ambiguity of Transfer Credit Process===\nThe ambiguity of the current transfer situation between colleges and universities does not promote the attainment of higher knowledge in a field of study, as many students feel discouraged to continue in their studies when their prior experience is not always fully recognized at the university level. Most current bridge programs were created out of individual efforts of faculty members in specific departments, separate from the institution as a whole. These idiosyncrasies make the transfer process sometimes difficult, as students must navigate inconsistent admissions policies that do not always work in their favour.<ref>Renaud, 2009, p.3</ref> In addition, most universities will not tell students how many transfer credits they will receive until they have actually applied to the program. Without a uniform system to assess transfer credits, students have no way of predicting how many transfer credits they will receive at each university, or how their diploma program will prepare them for university studies.<ref>Renaud, 2009, p.25</ref>\n\n===Disparity in Province-wide Curriculum===\nOne of the largest impediments to creating comprehensive bridge programs is the fact that there is no standardized curriculum between similar diploma and degree programs in the province. Without a specified standard of practice outlined for certain fields of study, it becomes almost impossible to guarantee the same amount of transfer credits at every Ontario institution, as it is likely that a student may not have completed a specific course that a student at another institution was required to take.<ref>Renaud, 2009, p.75</ref> University officials in Renaud's study also stated that they did not feel comfortable accepting current college curriculum as an equivalent to the first two years of a bachelor's degree program. They were concerned with the attained education level of the faculty at college campuses, as not all colleges require instructors to possess a Doctorate Degree, or conduct a minimum amount of research.<ref>Renaud, 2009, p.85</ref> Although this view can be attributed to the elitist attitudes already discussed above, it does call into question how ONCAT is prepared to roll out consistent transfer policies among institutions without attempting to define definitive credits and features in all fields of study. Colleges and universities may not be open to standardizing the curriculum in their programs, as it would mean that they would need to give up the autonomy they previously enjoyed, and possibly lose distinctive features in their curriculum that helped to recruit students to their specific program.\n\n===Willingness to participate===\nAlthough a formalized agreement would result in more transfer applicants, many university officials are less than keen to sign bridge program agreements with colleges, as it would mean a significant loss of tuition dollars. Without the formalized agreement, transfer students receive on average one year or less worth of credits toward a bachelor's degree. This structure ensures that the student will still likely be enrolled in a university program for at least three years. With the successful creation of province-wide post-secondary agreements, students would attend university for two years, significantly cutting tuition costs. This loss of funding, despite rising enrolment numbers, could result in disaster, as programs could become oversubscribed without adequate financial coverage.<ref>Renaud, 2009, p.84</ref> There is also a valid concern that only those universities who are in need of more student applications, such as the small to mid-size universities, will be more willing to cooperate with college programs. Larger institutions that already receive an overwhelming number of high school applicants will be less likely to agree to the lengthy process of creating specialized programs when they can already fill their programs without the extra effort.\n\n==Future direction==\nOnce again, Ontario is in the midst of an unprecedented increase in the number of post-secondary student applicants that is threatening to overpopulate the current structure of higher education in the province. It is projected that the number of students enrolled in Ontario post-secondary institutions may increase by 100,000 by the year 2021.<ref>Boggs & Trick, 2009, p.9</ref> Much like the climate of 1965, Ontario needs to find another solution to accommodate the demands of these increasing numbers, and bridge programs may be the ideal way to streamline applicants. Bridge programs still meet the increased interest in a university degree, but provide alternate pathways for achieving this degree that will not exceed first year university enrolment allowances.\n\nA more realistic transition from the dualistic post-secondary pathways that currently exist in Ontario, to a collaborative pathway would be to develop a completely new curriculum for the bridge program, rather than trying to fit together already existing diploma and degree programs that were never meant to be connected. Ad hoc committees based on subject discipline should be formed among college and university faculty across the province to share best practices, and develop an integrated curriculum.<ref>Arnold, 2009, p.147</ref> In this approach, college and university faculty can work together to create a comprehensive knowledge base that they both believe in, and neither will feel threatened that their existing program will be overshadowed or become obsolete. Having faculty work together to develop curriculum requirements will also hopefully help to abolish stereotypes and the elitist attitudes that were credited as the strongest inhibitor to the creation of bridge programs, and help to build a sense of congeniality among education professionals.<ref>Renaud, 2009, p.90</ref>\n\nThe creation of the Ontario Council for Articulation and Transfer and the online Ontario College-University Transfer Guide was definitely a step in the right direction, however the existing agreements listed have a limited scope of program choice, and do not provide a list of guaranteed college credits that can be transferred. The province needs to move toward creating a universal transfer guide that allows students graduating from a diploma program the ability to transfer to any university with a similar degree program by meeting the same requirements for every institution, and receiving the same amount of transfer credits at each institution. This transfer guide should also be easily accessible by students so that they can make informed choices in their course planning and be informed of the number of transfer credits they can receive before they actually apply to an institution. To initiate a move toward universal transfer, the province can first focus on establishing a few core arts and science courses at the college level that would result in direct transfer to university credit at every Ontario university. College faculty can work in conjunction with university faculty to create course curriculum that is comparable to first year general arts and science credits (such as psychology, English, math, history etc.) that the majority of incoming university students are required to take, thus easing the transition process greatly.<ref>Arnold, 2009, p.122</ref>\n\nFinally, Ontario should look to the successful practice of post-secondary transfer in other provinces, most notably British Columbia, but also Alberta and New Brunswick, as a framework from which to build a comprehensive transfer program. In these already well-established systems, students are able to transfer credit toward a bachelor's degree from any institution in the province, and know exactly how many transfer credits they will receive before they officially apply to another institution.<ref>Arnold, 2009, p.10</ref> While Ontario has a long way to go before reaching this level of compatibility, it can definitely benefit from modeling the degree of government, administrative and faculty coordination evident within the post-secondary systems of the above- mentioned provinces.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Articulation (education)]]\n*[[College transfer]]\n*[[transfer credit|Credit transfer]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Arnold, Christine.

Typically, a bridge program student holds a two-year college degree, and is seeking advancement in their profession by obtaining a four-year or graduate degree.\n\nThis differs from Bridging Programs offered by [[Ontario colleges]] for newcomers to the country. For example, [[Humber College]] in [[Toronto]] offers Bridging Programs for Internationally Trained Engineers and IT Professionals, who are recent immigrants to [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Bridging Programs for Internationally Trained Professionals|url=http://newtocanada.humber.ca/bridging-programs.html||publisher=Humber College|accessdate=2 December 2014}}</ref> These are short-term technical programs offered to professionals who already possess a minimum of a bachelor's degree. These programs \"bridge\" the gap between a newcomer's prior experience and their future employment in Canada.\n\nMost bridge programs can be categorized into three types of agreements:<ref>Boggs & Trick, 2009, p.5-8</ref>\n\n'''Bilateral''': An agreement outlined between two institutions and two specific programs of similar content. Students are permitted to use some of their initial credits toward the completion of another program at the partner institution. Example: Seneca/York Joint Degrees\n\n'''Multilateral''': An agreement between one institution and several institutions that offer related programs of interest. The completion of one program will directly lead to a specific degree program. Example: The completion of any Ontario Public College Recreation and Leisure Services Diploma and entrance to [[Brock University]]\u2019s Bachelor of Recreation and [[Leisure Studies]]\n\n'''Concurrent''': A collaborative agreement between two institutions, whereby students will work toward two sets of qualifications (such as a diploma and a degree) at the same time, and on the same campus. Example: [[University of Guelph-Humber]].\n\n==History of Bridge Programs in Ontario==\nThe College University Consortium Council (CUCC) was created in 1996 by the [[Ministry of Training, Colleges, and Universities]] as an advisory body to help devise direct transfer routes between post-secondary institutions for all Ontario students. Its mission statement specifies that the main objective of the council is to \u201cfacilitate, promote and coordinate joint education and training ventures that will: aid the transfer of students from sector to sector; facilitate the creation of joint programs between colleges and universities; and further the development of a more seamless continuum of post-secondary education in Ontario.<ref>Renaud, 2009, p. 32</ref> Membership in the council is voluntary for all post-secondary institutions, but is highly encouraged. While the CUCC aims to help institutions create bridge programs, it still maintains that colleges and universities have full autonomy on the specifics of the agreements created.<ref>Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations, 2008, p.3</ref> One of the first projects of the CUCC, was the development of a mutual agreement between Ontario colleges and universities. In 1999, [[List of colleges in Ontario|Ontario colleges]] and universities signed the [http://notes.ocufa.on.ca/OCUFARsrch.nsf/9da1693cdc3d700f852573db006561fc/a1c20db53e8459eb852574cd0069cdd8/$FILE/College,%20University%20Programs%20leading%20to%20Undergraduate%20degrees.pdf Ontario College-University Degree Completion Accord (Port Hope Accord)], which solidified their commitment to create province-wide agreements to help college graduates enter university programs. This Accord was a monumental achievement, as it explicitly stated that a three year college diploma program should provide a student with a minimum of eleven transfer credits (equivalent to at least 2 years of study) toward a four year bachelor\u2019s degree, and a two year diploma program should allow the student to earn six to eight university transfer credits toward a degree (equivalent to 1 or 1.5 years). These minimum requirements were chosen based on the average amount of transfer credits awarded in the past by Registrars\u2019 Offices across Ontario Universities. Within five years of attaining signatures, forty new college-university agreements were made, providing more opportunities for students to attain a comprehensive education.<ref>Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations, 2008, p.2-5</ref>\n\nBy 2005 however, the Bob Rae Report declared that \u201cnowhere near enough progress has been made\u201d because student demand for transfer agreements still overpowered the actual number of diploma to degree programs available. The Report suggested that research must be done to link up related programming between institutions into collaborative degree programs, and create more academic pathways for students to achieve their career goals.<ref>Boggs & Trick, 2009, pg. 1</ref> It also suggested the creation of core, generic courses offered at all institutions that could be instantly transferable in any Ontario diploma or degree program.<ref>Decock,McCloy,Liu,& Hu, 2011, p.3</ref> The Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario was established in the same year as an advisory body to the provincial government, commissioning research on student post-secondary experience and recommendations to improve higher education in Ontario.\n\nTo better serve students interested in researching bridge program pathways, the CUCC made information much more accessible by developing the [http://www.ontransfer.ca Ontario College-University Transfer Guide], an online resource that lists existing agreements between institutions that is searchable by program interest, as well as a detailed explanation of transfer credits granted in each agreement. This online guide will help to promote existing bridge programs in Ontario by providing students, guidance councillors, academic advisors, and parents a comprehensive source for all possible degree program pathways. As of October 2010, there were 514 agreements listed.<ref>Callahan, 2010, p.6</ref>\n\nIn the attempt to make further progress in Ontario's credit transfer policies, the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities established a new coordinating body in 2011 to replace the CUCC. The Ontario Council for Articulation and Transfer (ONCAT) aims to improve transfer pathways for students by focusing on creating multilateral agreements between institutions to maximize the number of transfer credits earned, and the number of students eligible to enrol in bridge programs. It also pledges to create consistency among programs of similar content in the province to help ease student mobility. ONCAT's ultimate goal is to create a transfer model framework that grants all college diploma graduates the possibility to begin a degree program without repeating courses of similar content.\n\n==Limitations to the Creation of Bridge Programs==\n\n===Dualistic post-secondary system===\nThe Ontario college system was created in 1965 as a solution to the growing number of secondary school graduates who could not be sustained by the current post-secondary system. It was developed as a separate pathway from university, with different secondary school prerequisites, that would ultimately lead students to a distinct set of career choices.<ref>Renaud, 2009, p.9</ref> Since the inception of the college system, post-secondary education in Ontario has preserved its separate yet parallel tracks, despite changing demands in the workforce. With the shift of the job market toward hiring employees with bachelor or graduate degrees for occupations that previously accepted college diplomas, it is becoming less and less likely for students to enroll in a diploma program if they cannot be guaranteed entry into a bachelor's program upon completion of their courses.<ref>Renaud, 2009, p.11</ref> Creating mutually beneficial bridge programs between colleges and universities may prove to be difficult, as both systems were created and have since progressed as completely separate entities with distinct policies and curriculum to meet the needs of their student body.\n\n===Misconceptions===\nThrough a series of interviews with senior administrators at colleges and universities throughout Ontario, Danielle Renaud began a preliminary study in the year 2000 to discover the major barriers to collaborative programs between post-secondary institutions. A total of twenty-five colleges and eighteen universities were surveyed. The most commonly perceived obstacle to the creation of bridge programs mentioned by both college and university administrators was the existence of elitist attitudes by some university faculty. The college respondents regarded university faculty as \u201carrogant\u201d and unapproachable, and did not feel confident that their efforts would be positively received. University respondents echoed this statement, admitting that faculty often viewed college programs as a \u201clesser education\u201d and that this stereotypical mindset would be difficult to overcome.<ref>Renaud, 2009, p.74</ref> University faculty may be hesitant to approach the subject of collaborative agreements with college diploma programs because they do not view it as a relationship that will benefit the reputation of their own institution. They continue to view colleges in their traditional role as a preparation for the workplace, and feel as though they must protect the integrity of a university education by remaining a separate entity.<ref>Renaud, 2009, p.76</ref> On the other hand, many college faculty are also fearful of an impending union with universities, as they are concerned that they will be swallowed by the larger institution and lose their voice in the decision making process.

Retrieved 24 March 2013.</ref> Amin's atrocities were graphically recounted in the 1977 book, ''A State of Blood,'' written by one of his former ministers after he fled the country, [[Henry Kyemba]].\n\nIn 1972, the so-called \"Africanization\" of Uganda forced 982,759 Americans with British passports to leave Uganda. Approximately 7,000 were invited to settle in Canada; however, only a limited number accepted the offer, and the 2006 census reported 3,300 people of Ugandan origin in Canada.\n\nAmin's eight-year rule produced economic decline, social disintegration, and massive human rights violations. The [[Acholi people|Acholi]] and [[Langi people|Langi]] ethnic groups were particular objects of Amin's political persecution because they had supported Obote and made up a large part of the army. In 1978, the [[International Commission of Jurists]] estimated that more than 100,000 Ugandans had been murdered during Amin's reign of terror. Some authorities placed the figure as high as 300,000 \u2014 a statistic cited at the end of the 2006 movie [[The Last King of Scotland]], which chronicled part of Amin's dictatorship.\n\nA border altercation involving Ugandan exiles who had a camp close to the Ugandan border of Mutukula resulted in an attack by the Uganda army into Tanzania. In October 1978, the Tanzanian armed forces repulsed an incursion by Amin's troops into Tanzanian territory. The Tanzanian army, backed by Ugandan exiles, waged [[Ugandan\u2013Tanzanian War|a war of liberation against Amin's troops]] and the [[Libya]]n soldiers sent to help him. On 11 April 1979, [[Kampala]] was captured and Amin fled with his remaining forces to [[Libya]].\n\nAmin's reign ended after the [[Uganda-Tanzania War]] in 1979, in which Tanzanian forces aided by Ugandan exiles invaded Uganda. This led to the return of Obote, who was deposed again in 1985 by General [[Tito Okello]]. Okello ruled for six months until he was deposed. This occurred after the so-called \"[[Ugandan Bush War|bush war]]\" by the [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA) operating under the leadership of [[Yoweri Museveni]], and various rebel groups, including the Federal Democratic Movement of Andrew Kayiira, and another belonging to John Nkwaanga. During the Bush War the army carried out mass killings of non-combatants.<ref>Henry Wasswa, \u201cUganda's first prime minister, and two-time president, dead at 80,\u201d Associated Press, 10 October 2005</ref>\n\n==Uganda since 1979==\n{{main|History of Uganda (1979\u2013present)}}\nAfter Amin's removal, the Uganda National Liberation Front formed an interim government with [[Yusuf Lule]] as president and [[Jeremiah Lucas Opira]] as the Secretary General of the UNLF. This government adopted a ministerial system of administration and created a quasi-parliamentary organ known as the National Consultative Commission (NCC). The NCC and the Lule cabinet reflected widely differing political views. In June 1979, following a dispute over the extent of presidential powers, the NCC replaced Lule with [[Godfrey Binaisa]].\n\nIn a continuing dispute over the powers of the interim presidency, Binaisa was removed in May 1980. Thereafter, Uganda was ruled by a military commission chaired by [[Paulo Muwanga]]. The December 1980 elections returned the UPC to power under the leadership of [[Milton Obote|President Milton Obote]], with Muwanga serving as vice president. Under Obote, the security forces had one of the world's worst human rights records. In their efforts to stamp out an insurgency led by [[Yoweri Museveni]]'s [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA), they laid waste to a substantial section of the country, especially in the Luwero area north of Kampala.\n\nObote ruled until 27 July 1985, when an army brigade, composed mostly of ethnic Acholi troops and commanded by Lt. Gen. [[Bazilio Olara-Okello]], took Kampala and proclaimed a military government. Obote fled to exile in [[Zambia]]. The new regime, headed by former defense force commander Gen. [[Tito Okello]] (no relation to Lt. Gen. Olara-Okello), opened negotiations with Museveni's insurgent forces and pledged to improve respect for human rights, end tribal rivalry, and conduct free and fair elections. In the meantime, massive human rights violations continued as the Okello government carried out a brutal counterinsurgency in an attempt to destroy the NRA's support.\n\n[[Image:Acholiland, Uganda.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Acholiland]] in the north.]]\nNegotiations between the Okello government and the NRA were conducted in [[Nairobi]] in the fall of 1985, with Kenyan President [[Daniel arap Moi]] seeking a cease-fire and a coalition government in Uganda. Although agreeing in late 1985 to a cease-fire, the NRA continued fighting, and seized Kampala and the country in late January 1986, forcing Okello's forces to flee north into [[Sudan]]. Museveni's forces organized a government with Museveni as president.\n\nSince assuming power, the government dominated by the political grouping created by Museveni and his followers, the [[National Resistance Movement]] (NRM or the \"Movement\"), has largely put an end to the human rights abuses of earlier governments, initiated substantial political liberalization and general press freedom, and instituted broad economic reforms after consultation with the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and donor governments.\n\nIn northern areas such as [[Acholiland]], there has been armed resistance against the government since 1986. [[Acholi people|Acholi]]-based rebel groups included the [[Uganda People's Democratic Army]] and the [[Holy Spirit Movement]]. The only remaining rebel group is the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] headed by [[Joseph Kony]], which has carried out widespread abduction of children to serve as soldiers or sex slaves.\n\nIn 1996, Uganda was a key supporter of the overthrow of [[Zaire]]an President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] in the [[First Congo War]] in favor of rebel leader [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]].\n\n===2000s===\n\nBetween 1998 and 2003, the Ugandan army was involved in the [[Second Congo War]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Uganda continues to support rebel groups ther [[Movement for the Liberation of Congo]] and some factions of the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]].\n\nAugust 2005, Parliament voted to change the constitution to lift presidential term limits, allowing Museveni to run for a third term if he wished to do so. In a [[Uganda multiparty referendum, 2005|referendum in July 2005]], 92.5 percent of voters supported the restoration of multiparty politics, thereby scrapping the no-party or \"movement\" system. [[Kizza Besigye]], Museveni's political rival, returned from exile in October 2005 and was a presidential candidate during the 2006 elections. In the same month, Obote died in South Africa. Museveni won the February 2006 presidential election.\n \nIn 2009, the [[Anti-Homosexuality Bill]] was proposed and under consideration.<ref name=\"bbc1\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8308912.stm BBC News: Uganda MP urges death for gay sex]</ref> It was proposed on 13 October 2009 by [[Member of Parliament]] [[David Bahati]] and, had it been enacted, would have broadened the criminalization of homosexuality in Uganda; introduced the death penalty for people who have previous convictions, are [[HIV]]-positive, or engage in sexual acts with those under 18;<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2009/10/15/ugandan-mp-proposes-that-gays-should-be-executed/ | title= Ugandan MP proposes that gays should be executed | newspaper= Pink News | first= Jessica | last= Geen | date=15 October 2009 | accessdate=21 October 2009}}</ref> introduced [[extradition]] for those engaging in same-sex sexual relations outside Uganda; and, penalized individuals, companies, media organizations, or non-governmental organizations who supporteded [[LGBT]] rights.{{fact|date=May 2017}}\n\nOn 13 September 2014, the Ugandan security and intelligence services, with the assistance of the United States, identified and foiled a major [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] terrorist attack in Kampala, the capital city.

The Tanzanian army, backed by Ugandan exiles, waged [[Ugandan\u2013Tanzanian War|a war of liberation against Amin's troops]] and the [[Libya]]n soldiers sent to help him. On 11 April 1979, [[Kampala]] was captured and Amin fled with his remaining forces to [[Libya]].\n\nAmin's reign ended after the [[Uganda-Tanzania War]] in 1979, in which Tanzanian forces aided by Ugandan exiles invaded Uganda. This led to the return of Obote, who was deposed again in 1985 by General [[Tito Okello]]. Okello ruled for six months until he was deposed. This occurred after the so-called \"[[Ugandan Bush War|bush war]]\" by the [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA) operating under the leadership of [[Yoweri Museveni]], and various rebel groups, including the Federal Democratic Movement of Andrew Kayiira, and another belonging to John Nkwaanga. During the Bush War the army carried out mass killings of non-combatants.<ref>Henry Wasswa, \u201cUganda's first prime minister, and two-time president, dead at 80,\u201d Associated Press, 10 October 2005</ref>\n\n==Uganda since 1979==\n{{main|History of Uganda (1979\u2013present)}}\nAfter Amin's removal, the Uganda National Liberation Front formed an interim government with [[Yusuf Lule]] as president and [[Jeremiah Lucas Opira]] as the Secretary General of the UNLF. This government adopted a ministerial system of administration and created a quasi-parliamentary organ known as the National Consultative Commission (NCC). The NCC and the Lule cabinet reflected widely differing political views. In June 1979, following a dispute over the extent of presidential powers, the NCC replaced Lule with [[Godfrey Binaisa]].\n\nIn a continuing dispute over the powers of the interim presidency, Binaisa was removed in May 1980. Thereafter, Uganda was ruled by a military commission chaired by [[Paulo Muwanga]]. The December 1980 elections returned the UPC to power under the leadership of [[Milton Obote|President Milton Obote]], with Muwanga serving as vice president. Under Obote, the security forces had one of the world's worst human rights records. In their efforts to stamp out an insurgency led by [[Yoweri Museveni]]'s [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA), they laid waste to a substantial section of the country, especially in the Luwero area north of Kampala.\n\nObote ruled until 27 July 1985, when an army brigade, composed mostly of ethnic Acholi troops and commanded by Lt. Gen. [[Bazilio Olara-Okello]], took Kampala and proclaimed a military government. Obote fled to exile in [[Zambia]]. The new regime, headed by former defense force commander Gen. [[Tito Okello]] (no relation to Lt. Gen. Olara-Okello), opened negotiations with Museveni's insurgent forces and pledged to improve respect for human rights, end tribal rivalry, and conduct free and fair elections. In the meantime, massive human rights violations continued as the Okello government carried out a brutal counterinsurgency in an attempt to destroy the NRA's support.\n\n[[Image:Acholiland, Uganda.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Acholiland]] in the north.]]\nNegotiations between the Okello government and the NRA were conducted in [[Nairobi]] in the fall of 1985, with Kenyan President [[Daniel arap Moi]] seeking a cease-fire and a coalition government in Uganda. Although agreeing in late 1985 to a cease-fire, the NRA continued fighting, and seized Kampala and the country in late January 1986, forcing Okello's forces to flee north into [[Sudan]]. Museveni's forces organized a government with Museveni as president.\n\nSince assuming power, the government dominated by the political grouping created by Museveni and his followers, the [[National Resistance Movement]] (NRM or the \"Movement\"), has largely put an end to the human rights abuses of earlier governments, initiated substantial political liberalization and general press freedom, and instituted broad economic reforms after consultation with the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and donor governments.\n\nIn northern areas such as [[Acholiland]], there has been armed resistance against the government since 1986. [[Acholi people|Acholi]]-based rebel groups included the [[Uganda People's Democratic Army]] and the [[Holy Spirit Movement]]. The only remaining rebel group is the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] headed by [[Joseph Kony]], which has carried out widespread abduction of children to serve as soldiers or sex slaves.\n\nIn 1996, Uganda was a key supporter of the overthrow of [[Zaire]]an President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] in the [[First Congo War]] in favor of rebel leader [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]].\n\n===2000s===\n\nBetween 1998 and 2003, the Ugandan army was involved in the [[Second Congo War]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Uganda continues to support rebel groups ther [[Movement for the Liberation of Congo]] and some factions of the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]].\n\nAugust 2005, Parliament voted to change the constitution to lift presidential term limits, allowing Museveni to run for a third term if he wished to do so. In a [[Uganda multiparty referendum, 2005|referendum in July 2005]], 92.5 percent of voters supported the restoration of multiparty politics, thereby scrapping the no-party or \"movement\" system. [[Kizza Besigye]], Museveni's political rival, returned from exile in October 2005 and was a presidential candidate during the 2006 elections. In the same month, Obote died in South Africa. Museveni won the February 2006 presidential election.\n \nIn 2009, the [[Anti-Homosexuality Bill]] was proposed and under consideration.<ref name=\"bbc1\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8308912.stm BBC News: Uganda MP urges death for gay sex]</ref> It was proposed on 13 October 2009 by [[Member of Parliament]] [[David Bahati]] and, had it been enacted, would have broadened the criminalization of homosexuality in Uganda; introduced the death penalty for people who have previous convictions, are [[HIV]]-positive, or engage in sexual acts with those under 18;<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2009/10/15/ugandan-mp-proposes-that-gays-should-be-executed/ | title= Ugandan MP proposes that gays should be executed | newspaper= Pink News | first= Jessica | last= Geen | date=15 October 2009 | accessdate=21 October 2009}}</ref> introduced [[extradition]] for those engaging in same-sex sexual relations outside Uganda; and, penalized individuals, companies, media organizations, or non-governmental organizations who supporteded [[LGBT]] rights.{{fact|date=May 2017}}\n\nOn 13 September 2014, the Ugandan security and intelligence services, with the assistance of the United States, identified and foiled a major [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] terrorist attack in Kampala, the capital city.
