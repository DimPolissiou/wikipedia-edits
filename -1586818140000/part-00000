With particular focus on crossovers between the real and virtual, Transmoderna reached into elements of [[Augmented reality|AR]], launching two of their own [[Instagram]] face filters, created by Johanna Jaskowska. <ref>https://032c.com/the-future-has-expired-dixons-transmoderna-seeks-the-spirit-of-the-present</ref>\n\nTowards the end of the first season, an official Transmoderna [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOZ0-HmhBXE music video] was released, representing a culmination of the overlapping elements that came together initially to form the overall Transmoderna concept. Soundtracked by [[\u00c2me]] and [[Mathew Jonson]], it brought together visual artists, fashion designers, choreographers, dance performers and programmers, which was then given to an AI to tweak and alter the final product. <ref>https://032c.com/the-future-has-expired-dixons-transmoderna-seeks-the-spirit-of-the-present</ref>\n\nTransmoderna has since been confirmed for a second season, with its venue announced to be moving to [[DC10 (nightclub)|DC10]] in 2020. <ref>https://www.residentadvisor.net/news/71837</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\n\n=== Singles & EPs ===\n\n* 2005: Wahoo presented By Dixon and Georg Levin \u2013 ''Holding You'' ([[Sonar Kollektiv]])\t\n* 2006: Henrik Schwarz / \u00c2me / Dixon feat.

The initial season was hosted at Pacha and ran every Friday night for 20 weeks, from May to October. Transmoderna evolved into more than just a club night, in parallel acting as a digital platform to explore boundaries between different spheres of the music, art, fashion, technology and club culture. With particular focus on crossovers between the real and virtual, Transmoderna reached into elements of [[Augmented reality|AR]], launching two of their own [[Instagram]] face filters, created by Johanna Jaskowska. <ref>https://032c.com/the-future-has-expired-dixons-transmoderna-seeks-the-spirit-of-the-present</ref>\n\nTowards the end of the first season, an official Transmoderna [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOZ0-HmhBXE music video] was released, representing a culmination of the overlapping elements that came together initially to form the overall Transmoderna concept. Soundtracked by [[\u00c2me]] and [[Mathew Jonson]], it brought together visual artists, fashion designers, choreographers, dance performers and programmers, which was then given to an AI to tweak and alter the final product. <ref>https://032c.com/the-future-has-expired-dixons-transmoderna-seeks-the-spirit-of-the-present</ref>\n\nTransmoderna has since been confirmed for a second season, with its venue announced to be moving to [[DC10 (nightclub)|DC10]] in 2020. <ref>https://www.residentadvisor.net/news/71837</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\n\n=== Singles & EPs ===\n\n* 2005: Wahoo presented By Dixon and Georg Levin \u2013 ''Holding You'' ([[Sonar Kollektiv]])\t\n* 2006: Henrik Schwarz / \u00c2me / Dixon feat.

As a teenager, Stefano was so keen to become an actor that he dropped out of high school two weeks before graduation and traveled to [[New York City]]. In Manhattan he adopted the stage name Jerry Stevens.\n\nStefano's initial career was as a composer of [[pop music]] in the 1940s, writing songs for Las Vegas showman [[Donn Arden]]. In possession of a large collection of sheet music, he once spent five hours challenging pianist [[Michael Feinstein]] on names of obscure [[Tin Pan Alley]] songs.\n\n==Career as screenwriter, producer and director==\nStefano began writing movie scripts in the late 1950s, firstly for [[Martin Ritt]] with ''[[The Black Orchid (film)|The Black Orchid]]'' (1959); his father was a tailor, and his mother made silk flowers and this was an influence on the screenplay.\n\nStefano was commissioned by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] to adapt [[Robert Bloch]]'s novel ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' (1960) for the screen. His work was recognized by the [[Mystery Writers of America]] when he was given a 1961 [[Edgar Award]], for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. Stefano appears briefly onscreen, discussing Bloch's utilization of the basis of the character Norman Bates in the crimes of [[serial killer]] [[Ed Gein]], in the documentary \"Ed Gein: The Ghoul of Plainfield\", which can be found on Disc 2 of the DVD release of the remake of ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' (2003).\n\nStefano was also offered the job of scripting Hitchcock's ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963) and ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964), but was already committed to produce and write for his friend [[Leslie Stevens]]' [[science fiction television]] anthology series ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]''. Both Stefano and Stevens were involved only during the first season of the show. In the book ''[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0983205604 Writing with Hitchcock]'', Stefano said that Hitchcock held a grudge over his being unavailable to write the screenplay for ''Marnie''.\n\nAfter leaving the series due to network interference and exhaustion, Stefano wrote, produced and directed ''[[The Ghost of Sierra de Cobre]]'' (1964; aka ''The Haunted''), a film utilizing many of the crew responsible for ''The Outer Limits''. The [[thriller film|thriller]] ''[[Eye of the Cat]]'' (1969) and the [[comedy film|comedy]] ''Futz'' (1969) were Stefano's last big-screen jobs for many years. Throughout the 1970s, he wrote many [[television film]]s such as ''[[Revenge!]]'' (1971), ''[[A Death of Innocence]]'' (1971), ''[[Home for the Holidays (1972 film)|Home for the Holidays]]'' (1972), ''[[Live Again, Die Again]]'' (1974), ''Aloha Means Goodbye'' (1974) and ''[[Snowbeast]]'' (1977). Stefano also wrote one episode for the first season of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (1988) entitled \"[[Skin of Evil]]\". Stefano was one of the Guests of Honor at the 1974 NY Telefantasy Convention (along with [[Noel Neill]], Jim Danforth and William Tuttle), and spent hours signing autographs for hundreds of ''Outer Limits'' fans. At the show, he expressed his surprise that so many people still remembered the series almost a decade after its cancellation.\n\nIn 1990, he revisited the characters from ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' with the TV movie script for the [[prequel]], in what he believed had become an increasingly disappointing series of films. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' (1990) posits the origins of [[Norman Bates]]' destructive mother-love, featuring [[Olivia Hussey]] as Mrs. Bates. Stefano wrote and executive produced the [[Al Pacino]] [[drama]] ''[[Two Bits]]'' (1995), a personal project that fared poorly at the box-office and with critics, leaving Stefano less than enthusiastic about continuing to write for modern Hollywood. [[Gus Van Sant]]'s remake of ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998) followed Stefano's script punctiliously, and in the biopic ''[[Hitchcock (film)|Hitchcock]]'' (2012), about the making of ''Psycho,'' he is portrayed by [[Ralph Macchio]].\n\nStefano died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at [[Los Robles Hospital]] in [[Thousand Oaks, California]], in 2006.\n\n==''The Outer Limits''==\nStefano was a producer for the first season of ''The Outer Limits'' and wrote a total of 12 episodes. They are:\n*\"[[Nightmare (1963 The Outer Limits)|Nightmare]]\"\n*\"[[It Crawled Out of the Woodwork]]\"\n*\"[[The Zanti Misfits]]\"\n*\"[[The Mice (The Outer Limits)|The Mice]]\" (teleplay)\n*\"[[Don't Open Till Doomsday]]\"\n*\"[[The Invisibles (The Outer Limits)|The Invisibles]]\"\n*\"[[The Bellero Shield]]\" (story & teleplay)\n*\"[[Moonstone (The Outer Limits)|Moonstone]]\" (story)\n*\"[[Fun and Games (The Outer Limits)|Fun and Games]]\" (teleplay)\n*\"[[A Feasibility Study]]\"\n*\"[[The Chameleon (The Outer Limits)|The Chameleon]]\" (story)\n*\"[[The Forms of Things Unknown]]\"\nThe last episode was originally a pilot for a proposed TV series called ''The Unknown'', but after ABC rejected it, Stefano reworked it as the season one finale.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Films===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Voters chose four representatives, or electors to the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], who voted for [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]].\n\n[[Hawaii]] was won by Governor [[Bill Clinton]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Arkansas]]) with 48.09% of the popular vote over incumbent President [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W. Bush]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Texas]]) with 36.70%. Businessman [[Ross Perot]] ([[Independent politician|I]]-Texas) finished in third, with 14.22% of the popular vote, which was nonetheless Perot\u2019s poorest showing outside the District of Columbia and [[slave states and free states|antebellum slave states]].<ref name=results/> Clinton ultimately won the national vote, defeating incumbent President Bush. Clinton comfortably won Hawaii by a margin of 11.39%. It has only voted Republican twice since its statehood ([[1972 United States presidential election in Hawaii|1972]] for [[Richard Nixon]], and [[1984 United States presidential election in Hawaii|1984]] for [[Ronald Reagan]]). These Republican wins were landslides for Presidents Nixon and Reagan who both carried 49 out of 50 states.

Resolutions of the paradox have important implications for the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]].\n\n[[File:Einstein.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Albert Einstein]]]] The thought experiment involves a pair of particles prepared in an [[quantum entanglement|entangled state]] (note that this terminology was invented only later). Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen pointed out that, in this state, if the position of the first particle were measured, the result of measuring the position of the second particle could be predicted. If, instead, the momentum of the first particle were measured, then the result of measuring the momentum of the second particle could be predicted. They argued that no action taken on the first particle could instantaneously affect the other, since this would involve information being transmitted faster than light, which is forbidden by the [[theory of relativity]]. They invoked a principle, later known as the \"EPR criterion of reality\", positing that, \"If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e., with [[probability]] equal to unity) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element of reality corresponding to that quantity\". From this, they inferred that the second particle must have a definite value of position and of momentum prior to either being measured. This contradicted the view associated with [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]], according to which a quantum particle does not have a definite value of a property like momentum until the measurement takes place.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe work was done at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in 1934, which Einstein [[Albert Einstein#1933: Emigration to the US|had joined the prior year]] after he had fled Nazi Germany. The resulting paper was written by Podolsky, and Einstein thought it did not accurately reflect his own views.<ref name=\":0\" /> The publication of the paper prompted a response by [[Niels Bohr]], which he published in the same journal, in the same year, using the same title.<ref name='Bohr1935'>{{cite journal |title=Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete? |date=1935-10-13 |first=N. |last=Bohr |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=48 |issue=8 |pages=696\u2013702 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.48.696|bibcode=1935PhRv...48..696B |url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/1060284/files/PhysRev.48.696.pdf }}</ref>  This exchange was only one chapter in [[Bohr\u2013Einstein debates|a prolonged debate between Bohr and Einstein]] about the fundamental nature of reality.\n\nEinstein struggled to the end of his life for a theory that could better comply with his idea of [[Principle of locality|locality]]. However, since Einstein's death, experiments analogous to the one described in the EPR paper have been carried out, notoriously by the group of [[Alain Aspect]] in the 1980s. These have confirmed that physical probabilities, as predicted by quantum theory, do exhibit the phenomena of Bell-inequality violations that are considered to invalidate EPR's preferred \"local hidden-variables\" type of explanation for the correlations to which EPR first drew attention.<ref name=Bell1964>{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = J.

However, it is possible to measure the exact position of particle A. By calculation, therefore, with the exact position of particle A known, the exact position of particle B can be known. Alternatively, the exact momentum of particle A can be measured, so the exact momentum of particle B can be worked out. Kumar writes: \"EPR argued that they had proved that ... [particle] B can have simultaneously exact values of position and momentum. ... Particle B has a position that is real and a momentum that is real.\"<blockquote> EPR appeared to have contrived a means to establish the exact values of ''either'' the momentum ''or'' the position of B due to measurements made on particle A, without the slightest possibility of particle B being physically disturbed.<ref name=Kumar2011/>\n</blockquote>\nEPR tried to set up a paradox to question the range of true application of quantum mechanics: Quantum theory predicts that both values cannot be known for a particle, and yet the EPR thought experiment purports to show that they must all have determinate values. The EPR paper says: \"We are thus forced to conclude that the quantum-mechanical description of physical reality given by wave functions is not complete.\"<ref name=Kumar2011/>\n\nThe EPR paper ends by saying: <blockquote>While we have thus shown that the wave function does not provide a complete description of the physical reality, we left open the question of whether or not such a description exists. We believe, however, that such a theory is possible.</blockquote>\n\nThe [[1935 in science|1935]] EPR paper<ref name=\"EPR\"/> condensed the philosophical discussion into a physical argument. The authors claim that given a specific experiment, in which the outcome of a measurement is known before the measurement takes place, there must exist something in the real world, an \"element of reality\", that determines the measurement outcome. They postulate that these elements of reality are, in modern terminology, [[principle of locality|local]], in the sense that each belongs to a certain point in [[spacetime]]. Each element may, again in modern terminology, only be influenced by events which are located in the backward [[light cone]] of its point in spacetime (i.e., the past). These claims are founded on assumptions about nature that constitute what is now known as [[local realism]].\n\nThough the EPR paper has often been taken as an exact expression of Einstein's views, it was primarily authored by Podolsky, based on discussions at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] with Einstein and Rosen. Einstein later expressed to [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] that, \"it did not come out as well as I had originally wanted; rather, the essential thing was, so to speak, smothered by the formalism.\"<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last = Kaiser | first = David\n | year = 1994\n | title = Bringing the human actors back on stage: the personal context of the Einstein-Bohr debate\n | journal = British Journal for the History of Science\n | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 129\u2013152\n | doi = 10.1017/S0007087400031861\n | jstor = 4027432\n }}</ref> (Einstein would later go on to present an individual account of his [[Principle of locality|local realist]] ideas.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Einstein |first1=Albert |year=1936 |title=Physik und Realit\u00e4t |journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute |volume=221 |issue=3 |pages=313\u2013347 |doi=10.1016/S0016-0032(36)91045-1 }} English translation by Jean Piccard, pp 349\u2013382 in the same issue, {{doi|10.1016/S0016-0032(36)91047-5}}).</ref>) Shortly before the EPR paper appeared in the ''[[Physical Review]],'' the ''[[New York Times]]'' ran a news story about it, under the headline \"Einstein Attacks Quantum Theory\".

Because measurements of position and of momentum are [[Complementarity (physics)|complementary]], making the choice to measure one excludes the possibility of measuring the other. Consequently, a fact deduced regarding one arrangement of laboratory apparatus could not be combined with a fact deduced by means of the other, and so, the inference of predetermined position and momentum values for the second particle was not valid. Bohr concluded that EPR's \"arguments do not justify their conclusion that the quantum description turns out to be essentially incomplete.\"\n\n=== Einstein's own argument ===\nIn his own publications and correspondence, Einstein used a different argument to insist that quantum mechanics is an incomplete theory.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|first1=Nicholas |last1=Harrigan |first2=Robert W. |last2=Spekkens |title=Einstein, incompleteness, and the epistemic view of quantum states |journal=[[Foundations of Physics]] |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=125 |year=2010 |doi=10.1007/s10701-009-9347-0 |arxiv=0706.2661|bibcode=2010FoPh...40..125H }}</ref><ref name=\"howard\">{{cite journal |last1=Howard |first1=D. |title=Einstein on locality and separability |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A |date=1985 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=171\u2013201 |doi=10.1016/0039-3681(85)90001-9}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sauer|first=Tilman|date=2007-12-01|title=An Einstein manuscript on the EPR paradox for spin observables|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3222/|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|language=en|volume=38|issue=4|pages=879\u2013887|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2007.03.002|issn=1355-2198|via=|bibcode=2007SHPMP..38..879S|citeseerx=10.1.1.571.6089}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Einstein |first=Albert |title=Autobiographical Notes |encyclopedia=Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist |year=1949 |publisher=Open Court Publishing Company |editor-last=Schilpp |editor-first=Paul Arthur}}</ref>{{rp|83ff}} He explicitly de-emphasized EPR's attribution of \"elements of reality\" to the position and momentum of particle B, saying that \"I couldn't care less\" whether the resulting states of particle B allowed one to predict the position and momentum with certainty.{{efn|\"Ob die <math>\\psi_B</math> und <math>\\psi_\\underline{B}</math> als Eigenfunktionen von Observabeln <math>B,\\underline{B}</math> aufgefasst werden k\u00f6nnen ist mir <em>wurst</em>.\" Emphasis from the original. \"Ist mir wurst\" is a German expression that literally translates to \"It is a sausage to me\", but means \"I couldn't care less\".

He argued that, because of locality, the real state of particle B couldn't depend on which kind of measurement was done in A, and therefore the quantum states cannot be in one-to-one correspondence with the real states.\n\n==Later developments==\n\n=== Bohm's variant ===\nIn 1951, [[David Bohm]] proposed a variant of the EPR thought experiment in which the measurements have discrete ranges of possible outcomes, unlike the position and momentum measurements considered by EPR.<ref>Bohm, D.

Suppose we have a source that emits electron\u2013positron pairs, with the electron sent to destination ''A'', where there is an observer named [[Alice and Bob|Alice]], and the positron sent to destination ''B'', where there is an observer named [[Alice and Bob|Bob]]. According to quantum mechanics, we can arrange our source so that each emitted pair occupies a quantum state called a [[spin singlet]]. The particles are thus said to be [[quantum entanglement|entangled]]. This can be viewed as a [[quantum superposition]] of two states, which we call state I and state II. In state I, the electron has [[spin (physics)|spin]] pointing upward along the ''z''-axis (''+z'') and the positron has spin pointing downward along the ''z''-axis (\u2212''z''). In state II, the electron has spin \u2212''z'' and the positron has spin +''z''. Because it is in a superposition of states it is impossible without measuring to know the definite state of spin of either particle in the spin singlet.<ref name=Griffiths2004>{{cite book | author=Griffiths, David J.|title=Introduction to Quantum Mechanics |edition=2nd | publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2004 |isbn= 978-0-13-111892-8}}</ref>{{rp|421\u2013422}}\n\n[[Image:EPR illustration.svg|thumb|500px|center|The EPR thought experiment, performed with electron\u2013positron pairs.

She can obtain one of two possible outcomes: +''z'' or \u2212''z''. Suppose she gets +''z''. Informally speaking, the quantum state of the system [[wavefunction collapse|collapses]] into state I. The quantum state determines the probable outcomes of any measurement performed on the system. In this case, if Bob subsequently measures spin along the ''z''-axis, there is 100% probability that he will obtain \u2212''z''. Similarly, if Alice gets \u2212''z'', Bob will get +''z''.\n\nThere is, of course, nothing special about choosing the ''z''-axis: according to quantum mechanics the spin singlet state may equally well be expressed as a superposition of spin states pointing in the ''x'' direction.<ref name=Laloe>{{cite journal|last=Laloe|first=Franck|title=Do We Really Understand Quantum Mechanics|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=69|issue=6|pages=655\u2013701|year=2012|arxiv=quant-ph/0209123|bibcode=2002quant.ph..9123L|doi=10.1119/1.1356698}} {{erratum|doi=10.1119/1.1466818|checked=yes}}</ref>{{rp|318}} Suppose that Alice and Bob had decided to measure spin along the ''x''-axis. We'll call these states Ia and IIa. In state Ia, Alice's electron has spin +''x'' and Bob's positron has spin \u2212''x''. In state IIa, Alice's electron has spin \u2212''x'' and Bob's positron has spin +''x''. Therefore, if Alice measures +''x'', the system 'collapses' into state Ia, and Bob will get \u2212''x''. If Alice measures \u2212''x'', the system collapses into state IIa, and Bob will get +''x''.\n\nWhatever axis their spins are measured along, they are always found to be opposite. In quantum mechanics, the ''x''-spin and ''z''-spin are \"incompatible observables\", meaning the [[uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] applies to alternating measurements of them: a quantum state cannot possess a definite value for both of these variables. Suppose Alice measures the ''z''-spin and obtains ''+z'', so that the quantum state collapses into state I. Now, instead of measuring the ''z''-spin as well, Bob measures the ''x''-spin. According to quantum mechanics, when the system is in state I, Bob's ''x''-spin measurement will have a 50% probability of producing +''x'' and a 50% probability of -''x''. It is impossible to predict which outcome will appear until Bob actually ''performs'' the measurement.\n\nTherefore Bob's positron will have a definite spin when measured along the same axis as Alice's electron, but when measured in the perpendicular axis its spin will be uniformly random. It seems as if information has propagated (faster than light) from Alice's apparatus to make Bob's positron assume a definite spin in the appropriate axis.\n\n=== Bell's theorem ===\n{{Main|Bell's theorem}}\n\nIn 1964, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] published a paper<ref name=\"Bell1964\"/> investigating the puzzling situation at that time: on one hand, the EPR paradox purportedly showed that quantum mechanics was nonlocal, and suggested that a hidden-variable theory could heal this nonlocality. On the other hand, David Bohm had recently developed the first successful hidden-variable theory, but it had a grossly nonlocal character.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bohm |first1=D. |title=A Suggested Interpretation of the Quantum Theory in Terms of \"Hidden\" Variables. I |journal=Physical Review |date=1952 |volume=85 |issue=2 |page=166 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.85.166|bibcode=1952PhRv...85..166B }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bohm |first1=D. |title=A Suggested Interpretation of the Quantum Theory in Terms of \"Hidden\" Variables.

This second result became known as the Bell theorem.\n\nTo understand the first result, consider the following toy hidden-variable theory introduced later by J.J. Sakurai:<ref name=Sakurai>{{cite book  | last1 = Sakurai  | first1 = J. J.  |last2 = Napolitano  | first2 = Jim  | title = Modern Quantum Mechanics  | edition = 2nd  | publisher = Addison-Wesley  | year = 2010|isbn =978-0805382914  }}</ref>{{rp|239\u2013240}} in it, quantum spin-singlet states emitted by the source are actually approximate descriptions for \"true\" physical states possessing definite values for the ''z''-spin and ''x''-spin. In these \"true\" states, the positron going to Bob always has spin values opposite to the electron going to Alice, but the values are otherwise completely random. For example, the first pair emitted by the source might be \"(+''z'', \u2212''x'') to Alice and (\u2212''z'', +''x'') to Bob\", the next pair \"(\u2212''z'', \u2212''x'') to Alice and (+''z'', +''x'') to Bob\", and so forth. Therefore, if Bob's measurement axis is aligned with Alice's, he will necessarily get the opposite of whatever Alice gets; otherwise, he will get \"+\" and \"\u2212\" with equal probability.\n\nBell showed, however, that such models can only reproduce the singlet correlations when Alice and Bob make measurements on the same axis or on perpendicular axes. As soon as other angles between their axes are allowed, local hidden-variable theories become unable of reproducing the quantum mechanical correlations. This difference, expressed using [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] known as \"Bell inequalities\", is in principle experimentally testable. After the publication of Bell's paper, a variety of [[Bell test|experiments to test Bell's inequalities]] were devised. All experiments conducted to date have found behavior in line with the predictions of quantum mechanics.<ref name=Aspect1999/> The present view of the situation is that quantum mechanics flatly contradicts Einstein's philosophical postulate that any acceptable physical theory must fulfill \"local realism\". The fact that quantum mechanics violates Bell inequalities indicates that any hidden-variable theory underlying quantum mechanics must be non-local; whether this should be taken to imply that quantum mechanics ''itself'' is non-local is a matter of debate.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Werner |first=R.

EPR describe the principle of locality as asserting that physical processes occurring at one place should have no immediate effect on the elements of reality at another location. At first sight, this appears to be a reasonable assumption to make, as it seems to be a consequence of [[special relativity]], which states that energy can never be transmitted faster than the [[speed of light]] without violating [[causality (physics)|causality]].<ref name=Griffiths2004/>{{rp|427\u2013428}}<ref name=Blaylock>{{Cite journal\n  | last =Blaylock\n  | first = Guy\n  | title = The EPR paradox, Bell's inequality, and the question of locality\n  | journal = American Journal of Physics\n  | volume = 78\n  | issue = 1\n  | pages = 111\u2013120\n  | date=January 2010\n  | arxiv = 0902.3827\n  | bibcode = 2010AmJPh..78..111B\n  | doi = 10.1119/1.3243279\n }}</ref>\n\nHowever, it turns out that the usual rules for combining quantum mechanical and classical descriptions violate EPR's principle of locality without violating special relativity or causality.<ref name=Griffiths2004/>{{rp|427\u2013428}}<ref name=Blaylock/> Causality is preserved because there is no way for Alice to transmit messages (i.e., information) to Bob by manipulating her measurement axis. Whichever axis she uses, she has a 50% probability of obtaining \"+\" and 50% probability of obtaining \"\u2212\", completely at [[randomness|random]]; according to quantum mechanics, it is fundamentally impossible for her to influence what result she gets. Furthermore, Bob is only able to perform his measurement ''once'': there is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics, the [[no cloning theorem]], which makes it impossible for him to make an arbitrary number of copies of the electron he receives, perform a spin measurement on each, and look at the statistical distribution of the results. Therefore, in the one measurement he is allowed to make, there is a 50% probability of getting \"+\" and 50% of getting \"\u2212\", regardless of whether or not his axis is aligned with Alice's.\n\nIn summary, the results of the EPR thought experiment do not contradict the predictions of special relativity. Neither the EPR paradox nor any quantum experiment demonstrates that [[Faster-than-light communication|superluminal signaling]] is possible.\n\nHowever, the principle of locality appeals powerfully to physical intuition, and Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen were unwilling to abandon it.

The spin degree of freedom for an electron is associated with a two-dimensional complex [[vector space]] ''V'', with each quantum state corresponding to a vector in that space. The operators corresponding to the spin along the ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' direction, denoted ''S<sub>x</sub>'', ''S<sub>y</sub>'', and ''S<sub>z</sub>'' respectively, can be represented using the [[Pauli matrices]]:<ref name=Sakurai />{{rp|9}}\n\n:<math>\n  S_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &  1 \\\\ 1 &  0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n  S_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i &  0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n  S_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &  0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\hbar</math> is the [[reduced Planck constant]] (or the Planck constant divided by 2\u03c0).\n\nThe [[eigenstate]]s of ''S<sub>z</sub>'' are represented as\n\n:<math>\n  \\left|+z\\right\\rangle \\leftrightarrow \\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n  \\left|-z\\right\\rangle \\leftrightarrow \\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nand the eigenstates of ''S<sub>x</sub>'' are represented as\n\n:<math>\n  \\left|+x\\right\\rangle \\leftrightarrow \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n  \\left|-x\\right\\rangle \\leftrightarrow \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\-1\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nThe vector space of the electron-positron pair is <math> V \\otimes V </math>, the [[tensor product]] of the electron's and positron's vector spaces. The spin singlet state is\n\n:<math>\n  \\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\bigg (\n    \\left|+z\\right\\rangle \\otimes \\left|-z\\right\\rangle -\n    \\left|-z\\right\\rangle \\otimes \\left|+z\\right\\rang\n  \\bigg)\n</math>\n\nwhere the two terms on the right hand side are what we have referred to as state I and state II above.\n\nFrom the above equations, it can be shown that the spin singlet can also be written as\n\n:<math>\n  \\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\bigg(\n    \\left|+x\\right\\rangle \\otimes \\left|-x\\right\\rangle -\n    \\left|-x\\right\\rangle \\otimes \\left|+x\\right\\rangle\n  \\bigg)\n</math>\n\nwhere the terms on the right hand side are what we have referred to as state Ia and state IIa.\n\nTo illustrate the paradox, we need to show that after Alice's measurement of ''S<sub>z</sub>'' (or ''S<sub>x</sub>''), Bob's value of ''S<sub>z</sub>'' (or ''S<sub>x</sub>'') is uniquely determined and Bob's value of ''S<sub>x</sub>'' (or ''S<sub>z</sub>'') is uniformly random. This follows from the principles of [[measurement in quantum mechanics]]. When ''S''<sub>z</sub> is measured, the system state <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> collapses into an eigenvector of ''S''<sub>z</sub>.  If the measurement result is ''+z'', this means that immediately after measurement the system state collapses to\n\n:<math> \\left| +z \\right\\rangle \\otimes \\left| -z \\right\\rangle = \\left| +z \\right\\rangle \\otimes \\frac{\\left| +x \\right\\rangle - \\left| -x \\right\\rangle}{\\sqrt2}</math>\n\nSimilarly, if Alice's measurement result is \u2212''z'', the state collapses to\n\n:<math> \\left|-z\\right\\rangle \\otimes \\left|+z\\right\\rangle = \\left| -z \\right\\rangle \\otimes \\frac{\\left| +x \\right\\rangle + \\left| -x \\right\\rangle}{\\sqrt2}</math>\nThe left hand side of both equations show that the measurement of ''S''<sub>z</sub> on Bob's positron is now determined, it will be \u2212''z'' in the first case or +''z'' in the second case. The right hand side of the equations show that the measurement of ''S''<sub>x</sub> on Bob's positron will return, in both cases, +''x'' or -''x'' with probability 1/2 each.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[CHSH Bell test]]\n* [[Coherence (physics)|Coherence]]\n* [[Correlation does not imply causation]]\n* [[ER=EPR]]\n* [[GHZ experiment]]\n* [[Measurement problem]]\n* [[Philosophy of information]]\n* [[Philosophy of physics]]\n* [[Popper's experiment]]\n* [[Quantum information]]\n* [[Quantum pseudo-telepathy]]\n* [[Quantum teleportation]]\n* [[Quantum Zeno effect]]\n* [[Sakurai's Bell inequality]]\n* [[Synchronicity]]\n* [[John Clive Ward|Ward's probability amplitude]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notes|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Selected papers ===\n* {{cite journal | last=Eberhard | first=P.

Resolutions of the paradox have important implications for the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]].\n\n[[File:Einstein.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Albert Einstein]]]] The thought experiment involves a pair of particles prepared in an [[quantum entanglement|entangled state]] (note that this terminology was invented only later). Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen pointed out that, in this state, if the position of the first particle were measured, the result of measuring the position of the second particle could be predicted. If, instead, the momentum of the first particle were measured, then the result of measuring the momentum of the second particle could be predicted. They argued that no action taken on the first particle could instantaneously affect the other, since this would involve information being transmitted faster than light, which is forbidden by the [[theory of relativity]]. They invoked a principle, later known as the \"EPR criterion of reality\", positing that, \"If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e., with [[probability]] equal to unity) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element of reality corresponding to that quantity\". From this, they inferred that the second particle must have a definite value of position and of momentum prior to either being measured. This contradicted the view associated with [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]], according to which a quantum particle does not have a definite value of a property like momentum until the measurement takes place.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe work was done at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in 1934, which Einstein [[Albert Einstein#1933: Emigration to the US|had joined the prior year]] after he had fled Nazi Germany. The resulting paper was written by Podolsky, and Einstein thought it did not accurately reflect his own views.<ref name=\":0\" /> The publication of the paper prompted a response by [[Niels Bohr]], which he published in the same journal, in the same year, using the same title.<ref name='Bohr1935'>{{cite journal |title=Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete? |date=1935-10-13 |first=N. |last=Bohr |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=48 |issue=8 |pages=696\u2013702 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.48.696|bibcode=1935PhRv...48..696B |url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/1060284/files/PhysRev.48.696.pdf }}</ref>  This exchange was only one chapter in [[Bohr\u2013Einstein debates|a prolonged debate between Bohr and Einstein]] about the fundamental nature of reality.\n\nEinstein struggled to the end of his life for a theory that could better comply with his idea of [[Principle of locality|locality]]. However, since Einstein's death, experiments analogous to the one described in the EPR paper have been carried out, notoriously by the group of [[Alain Aspect]] in the 1980s. These have confirmed that physical probabilities, as predicted by quantum theory, do exhibit the phenomena of Bell-inequality violations that are considered to invalidate EPR's preferred \"local hidden-variables\" type of explanation for the correlations to which EPR first drew attention.<ref name=Bell1964>{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = J.

However, it is possible to measure the exact position of particle A. By calculation, therefore, with the exact position of particle A known, the exact position of particle B can be known. Alternatively, the exact momentum of particle A can be measured, so the exact momentum of particle B can be worked out. Kumar writes: \"EPR argued that they had proved that ... [particle] B can have simultaneously exact values of position and momentum. ... Particle B has a position that is real and a momentum that is real.\"<blockquote> EPR appeared to have contrived a means to establish the exact values of ''either'' the momentum ''or'' the position of B due to measurements made on particle A, without the slightest possibility of particle B being physically disturbed.<ref name=Kumar2011/>\n</blockquote>\nEPR tried to set up a paradox to question the range of true application of quantum mechanics: Quantum theory predicts that both values cannot be known for a particle, and yet the EPR thought experiment purports to show that they must all have determinate values. The EPR paper says: \"We are thus forced to conclude that the quantum-mechanical description of physical reality given by wave functions is not complete.\"<ref name=Kumar2011/>\n\nThe EPR paper ends by saying: <blockquote>While we have thus shown that the wave function does not provide a complete description of the physical reality, we left open the question of whether or not such a description exists. We believe, however, that such a theory is possible.</blockquote>\n\nThe [[1935 in science|1935]] EPR paper<ref name=\"EPR\"/> condensed the philosophical discussion into a physical argument. The authors claim that given a specific experiment, in which the outcome of a measurement is known before the measurement takes place, there must exist something in the real world, an \"element of reality\", that determines the measurement outcome. They postulate that these elements of reality are, in modern terminology, [[principle of locality|local]], in the sense that each belongs to a certain point in [[spacetime]]. Each element may, again in modern terminology, only be influenced by events which are located in the backward [[light cone]] of its point in spacetime (i.e., the past). These claims are founded on assumptions about nature that constitute what is now known as [[local realism]].\n\nThough the EPR paper has often been taken as an exact expression of Einstein's views, it was primarily authored by Podolsky, based on discussions at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] with Einstein and Rosen.

Because measurements of position and of momentum are [[Complementarity (physics)|complementary]], making the choice to measure one excludes the possibility of measuring the other. Consequently, a fact deduced regarding one arrangement of laboratory apparatus could not be combined with a fact deduced by means of the other, and so, the inference of predetermined position and momentum values for the second particle was not valid. Bohr concluded that EPR's \"arguments do not justify their conclusion that the quantum description turns out to be essentially incomplete.\"\n\n=== Einstein's own argument ===\nIn his own publications and correspondence, Einstein used a different argument to insist that quantum mechanics is an incomplete theory.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|first1=Nicholas |last1=Harrigan |first2=Robert W. |last2=Spekkens |title=Einstein, incompleteness, and the epistemic view of quantum states |journal=[[Foundations of Physics]] |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=125 |year=2010 |doi=10.1007/s10701-009-9347-0 |arxiv=0706.2661|bibcode=2010FoPh...40..125H }}</ref><ref name=\"howard\">{{cite journal |last1=Howard |first1=D. |title=Einstein on locality and separability |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A |date=1985 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=171\u2013201 |doi=10.1016/0039-3681(85)90001-9}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sauer|first=Tilman|date=2007-12-01|title=An Einstein manuscript on the EPR paradox for spin observables|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3222/|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|language=en|volume=38|issue=4|pages=879\u2013887|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2007.03.002|issn=1355-2198|via=|bibcode=2007SHPMP..38..879S|citeseerx=10.1.1.571.6089}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Einstein |first=Albert |title=Autobiographical Notes |encyclopedia=Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist |year=1949 |publisher=Open Court Publishing Company |editor-last=Schilpp |editor-first=Paul Arthur}}</ref>{{rp|83ff}} He explicitly de-emphasized EPR's attribution of \"elements of reality\" to the position and momentum of particle B, saying that \"I couldn't care less\" whether the resulting states of particle B allowed one to predict the position and momentum with certainty.{{efn|\"Ob die <math>\\psi_B</math> und <math>\\psi_\\underline{B}</math> als Eigenfunktionen von Observabeln <math>B,\\underline{B}</math> aufgefasst werden k\u00f6nnen ist mir <em>wurst</em>.\" Emphasis from the original. \"Ist mir wurst\" is a German expression that literally translates to \"It is a sausage to me\", but means \"I couldn't care less\".

He argued that, because of locality, the real state of particle B couldn't depend on which kind of measurement was done in A, and therefore the quantum states cannot be in one-to-one correspondence with the real states.\n\n==Later developments==\n\n=== Bohm's variant ===\nIn 1951, [[David Bohm]] proposed a variant of the EPR thought experiment in which the measurements have discrete ranges of possible outcomes, unlike the position and momentum measurements considered by EPR.<ref>Bohm, D.

Suppose we have a source that emits electron\u2013positron pairs, with the electron sent to destination ''A'', where there is an observer named [[Alice and Bob|Alice]], and the positron sent to destination ''B'', where there is an observer named [[Alice and Bob|Bob]]. According to quantum mechanics, we can arrange our source so that each emitted pair occupies a quantum state called a [[spin singlet]]. The particles are thus said to be [[quantum entanglement|entangled]]. This can be viewed as a [[quantum superposition]] of two states, which we call state I and state II. In state I, the electron has [[spin (physics)|spin]] pointing upward along the ''z''-axis (''+z'') and the positron has spin pointing downward along the ''z''-axis (\u2212''z''). In state II, the electron has spin \u2212''z'' and the positron has spin +''z''. Because it is in a superposition of states it is impossible without measuring to know the definite state of spin of either particle in the spin singlet.<ref name=Griffiths2004>{{cite book | author=Griffiths, David J.|title=Introduction to Quantum Mechanics |edition=2nd | publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2004 |isbn= 978-0-13-111892-8}}</ref>{{rp|421\u2013422}}\n\n[[Image:EPR illustration.svg|thumb|500px|center|The EPR thought experiment, performed with electron\u2013positron pairs.

She can obtain one of two possible outcomes: +''z'' or \u2212''z''. Suppose she gets +''z''. Informally speaking, the quantum state of the system [[wavefunction collapse|collapses]] into state I. The quantum state determines the probable outcomes of any measurement performed on the system. In this case, if Bob subsequently measures spin along the ''z''-axis, there is 100% probability that he will obtain \u2212''z''. Similarly, if Alice gets \u2212''z'', Bob will get +''z''.\n\nThere is, of course, nothing special about choosing the ''z''-axis: according to quantum mechanics the spin singlet state may equally well be expressed as a superposition of spin states pointing in the ''x'' direction.<ref name=Laloe>{{cite journal|last=Laloe|first=Franck|title=Do We Really Understand Quantum Mechanics|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=69|issue=6|pages=655\u2013701|year=2012|arxiv=quant-ph/0209123|bibcode=2002quant.ph..9123L|doi=10.1119/1.1356698}} {{erratum|doi=10.1119/1.1466818|checked=yes}}</ref>{{rp|318}} Suppose that Alice and Bob had decided to measure spin along the ''x''-axis. We'll call these states Ia and IIa. In state Ia, Alice's electron has spin +''x'' and Bob's positron has spin \u2212''x''. In state IIa, Alice's electron has spin \u2212''x'' and Bob's positron has spin +''x''. Therefore, if Alice measures +''x'', the system 'collapses' into state Ia, and Bob will get \u2212''x''. If Alice measures \u2212''x'', the system collapses into state IIa, and Bob will get +''x''.\n\nWhatever axis their spins are measured along, they are always found to be opposite. In quantum mechanics, the ''x''-spin and ''z''-spin are \"incompatible observables\", meaning the [[uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] applies to alternating measurements of them: a quantum state cannot possess a definite value for both of these variables. Suppose Alice measures the ''z''-spin and obtains ''+z'', so that the quantum state collapses into state I. Now, instead of measuring the ''z''-spin as well, Bob measures the ''x''-spin. According to quantum mechanics, when the system is in state I, Bob's ''x''-spin measurement will have a 50% probability of producing +''x'' and a 50% probability of -''x''. It is impossible to predict which outcome will appear until Bob actually ''performs'' the measurement.\n\nTherefore Bob's positron will have a definite spin when measured along the same axis as Alice's electron, but when measured in the perpendicular axis its spin will be uniformly random. It seems as if information has propagated (faster than light) from Alice's apparatus to make Bob's positron assume a definite spin in the appropriate axis.\n\n=== Bell's theorem ===\n{{Main|Bell's theorem}}\n\nIn 1964, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] published a paper<ref name=\"Bell1964\"/> investigating the puzzling situation at that time: on one hand, the EPR paradox purportedly showed that quantum mechanics was nonlocal, and suggested that a hidden-variable theory could heal this nonlocality. On the other hand, David Bohm had recently developed the first successful hidden-variable theory, but it had a grossly nonlocal character.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bohm |first1=D. |title=A Suggested Interpretation of the Quantum Theory in Terms of \"Hidden\" Variables.

This second result became known as the Bell theorem.\n\nTo understand the first result, consider the following toy hidden-variable theory introduced later by J.J. Sakurai:<ref name=Sakurai>{{cite book  | last1 = Sakurai  | first1 = J. J.  |last2 = Napolitano  | first2 = Jim  | title = Modern Quantum Mechanics  | edition = 2nd  | publisher = Addison-Wesley  | year = 2010|isbn =978-0805382914  }}</ref>{{rp|239\u2013240}} in it, quantum spin-singlet states emitted by the source are actually approximate descriptions for \"true\" physical states possessing definite values for the ''z''-spin and ''x''-spin. In these \"true\" states, the positron going to Bob always has spin values opposite to the electron going to Alice, but the values are otherwise completely random. For example, the first pair emitted by the source might be \"(+''z'', \u2212''x'') to Alice and (\u2212''z'', +''x'') to Bob\", the next pair \"(\u2212''z'', \u2212''x'') to Alice and (+''z'', +''x'') to Bob\", and so forth. Therefore, if Bob's measurement axis is aligned with Alice's, he will necessarily get the opposite of whatever Alice gets; otherwise, he will get \"+\" and \"\u2212\" with equal probability.\n\nBell showed, however, that such models can only reproduce the singlet correlations when Alice and Bob make measurements on the same axis or on perpendicular axes. As soon as other angles between their axes are allowed, local hidden-variable theories become unable of reproducing the quantum mechanical correlations. This difference, expressed using [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] known as \"Bell inequalities\", is in principle experimentally testable. After the publication of Bell's paper, a variety of [[Bell test|experiments to test Bell's inequalities]] were devised. All experiments conducted to date have found behavior in line with the predictions of quantum mechanics.<ref name=Aspect1999/> The present view of the situation is that quantum mechanics flatly contradicts Einstein's philosophical postulate that any acceptable physical theory must fulfill \"local realism\". The fact that quantum mechanics violates Bell inequalities indicates that any hidden-variable theory underlying quantum mechanics must be non-local; whether this should be taken to imply that quantum mechanics ''itself'' is non-local is a matter of debate.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Werner |first=R.

EPR describe the principle of locality as asserting that physical processes occurring at one place should have no immediate effect on the elements of reality at another location.

Whichever axis she uses, she has a 50% probability of obtaining \"+\" and 50% probability of obtaining \"\u2212\", completely at [[randomness|random]]; according to quantum mechanics, it is fundamentally impossible for her to influence what result she gets. Furthermore, Bob is only able to perform his measurement ''once'': there is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics, the [[no cloning theorem]], which makes it impossible for him to make an arbitrary number of copies of the electron he receives, perform a spin measurement on each, and look at the statistical distribution of the results. Therefore, in the one measurement he is allowed to make, there is a 50% probability of getting \"+\" and 50% of getting \"\u2212\", regardless of whether or not his axis is aligned with Alice's.\n\nIn summary, the results of the EPR thought experiment do not contradict the predictions of special relativity. Neither the EPR paradox nor any quantum experiment demonstrates that [[Faster-than-light communication|superluminal signaling]] is possible.\n\nHowever, the principle of locality appeals powerfully to physical intuition, and Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen were unwilling to abandon it.

The spin degree of freedom for an electron is associated with a two-dimensional complex [[vector space]] ''V'', with each quantum state corresponding to a vector in that space. The operators corresponding to the spin along the ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' direction, denoted ''S<sub>x</sub>'', ''S<sub>y</sub>'', and ''S<sub>z</sub>'' respectively, can be represented using the [[Pauli matrices]]:<ref name=Sakurai />{{rp|9}}\n\n:<math>\n  S_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &  1 \\\\ 1 &  0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n  S_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i &  0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n  S_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &  0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\hbar</math> is the [[reduced Planck constant]] (or the Planck constant divided by 2\u03c0).\n\nThe [[eigenstate]]s of ''S<sub>z</sub>'' are represented as\n\n:<math>\n  \\left|+z\\right\\rangle \\leftrightarrow \\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n  \\left|-z\\right\\rangle \\leftrightarrow \\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nand the eigenstates of ''S<sub>x</sub>'' are represented as\n\n:<math>\n  \\left|+x\\right\\rangle \\leftrightarrow \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n  \\left|-x\\right\\rangle \\leftrightarrow \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\-1\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nThe vector space of the electron-positron pair is <math> V \\otimes V </math>, the [[tensor product]] of the electron's and positron's vector spaces. The spin singlet state is\n\n:<math>\n  \\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\bigg (\n    \\left|+z\\right\\rangle \\otimes \\left|-z\\right\\rangle -\n    \\left|-z\\right\\rangle \\otimes \\left|+z\\right\\rang\n  \\bigg)\n</math>\n\nwhere the two terms on the right hand side are what we have referred to as state I and state II above.\n\nFrom the above equations, it can be shown that the spin singlet can also be written as\n\n:<math>\n  \\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\bigg(\n    \\left|+x\\right\\rangle \\otimes \\left|-x\\right\\rangle -\n    \\left|-x\\right\\rangle \\otimes \\left|+x\\right\\rangle\n  \\bigg)\n</math>\n\nwhere the terms on the right hand side are what we have referred to as state Ia and state IIa.\n\nTo illustrate the paradox, we need to show that after Alice's measurement of ''S<sub>z</sub>'' (or ''S<sub>x</sub>''), Bob's value of ''S<sub>z</sub>'' (or ''S<sub>x</sub>'') is uniquely determined and Bob's value of ''S<sub>x</sub>'' (or ''S<sub>z</sub>'') is uniformly random. This follows from the principles of [[measurement in quantum mechanics]]. When ''S''<sub>z</sub> is measured, the system state <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> collapses into an eigenvector of ''S''<sub>z</sub>.  If the measurement result is ''+z'', this means that immediately after measurement the system state collapses to\n\n:<math> \\left| +z \\right\\rangle \\otimes \\left| -z \\right\\rangle = \\left| +z \\right\\rangle \\otimes \\frac{\\left| +x \\right\\rangle - \\left| -x \\right\\rangle}{\\sqrt2}</math>\n\nSimilarly, if Alice's measurement result is \u2212''z'', the state collapses to\n\n:<math> \\left|-z\\right\\rangle \\otimes \\left|+z\\right\\rangle = \\left| -z \\right\\rangle \\otimes \\frac{\\left| +x \\right\\rangle + \\left| -x \\right\\rangle}{\\sqrt2}</math>\nThe left hand side of both equations show that the measurement of ''S''<sub>z</sub> on Bob's positron is now determined, it will be \u2212''z'' in the first case or +''z'' in the second case. The right hand side of the equations show that the measurement of ''S''<sub>x</sub> on Bob's positron will return, in both cases, +''x'' or -''x'' with probability 1/2 each.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[CHSH Bell test]]\n* [[Coherence (physics)|Coherence]]\n* [[Correlation does not imply causation]]\n* [[ER=EPR]]\n* [[GHZ experiment]]\n* [[Measurement problem]]\n* [[Philosophy of information]]\n* [[Philosophy of physics]]\n* [[Popper's experiment]]\n* [[Quantum information]]\n* [[Quantum pseudo-telepathy]]\n* [[Quantum teleportation]]\n* [[Quantum Zeno effect]]\n* [[Sakurai's Bell inequality]]\n* [[Synchronicity]]\n* [[John Clive Ward|Ward's probability amplitude]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notes|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Selected papers ===\n* {{cite journal | last=Eberhard | first=P.

During the Israeli occupation, the Blue Hole developed a significant international reputation as a dive site. In 1968 a group of Israeli divers led by Alex Shell were the first to dive the hole with [[scuba diving|modern scuba diving]]. During the dive, they noticed the underwater arch.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} .\n\nSince 1982 the Blue Hole has become very busy with recreational divers and is dived almost every day by recreational divers. Local dive centres take appropriately qualified divers to 30&nbsp;m (AOW level or CMAS**) at the El Bells or Bells to Blue Hole sites. The Bells entry is from the shore further along from the Blue Hole.<ref name=\"The Bells\">{{Cite web|url= https://www.diveglobal.com/divesite/the-bells/ |title= The Bells dive site: Diving from The Bells to Dahab Blue Hole}}</ref> At 26&nbsp;m at the bottom of the Bells is a mini arch that should not be confused with the arch in the Blue Hole itself. The dive is then a wall dive that finishes crossing the Blue Hole saddle at a depth of 7&nbsp;m. Recreational divers do not get to see the Blue Hole arch when doing the Bells to Blue Hole dive.\n\n==Fatalities==\n[[File:Blue hole memorial.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaques for divers killed in the hole, left by family and friends at the site]]\nThe Blue Hole itself is no more dangerous than any other Red Sea dive site but diving through the Arch, a submerged tunnel, which lies within the Blue Hole site, is an extreme dive that has resulted in many accidents and fatalities.\nThe number of Blue Hole fatalities is not recorded; one source estimates 130 divers died during the fifteen-year period from 1997 to 2012, averaging over eight per year, another claims as many as 200.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/><ref name=\"Spiegel2012\" /><ref name=divgrave /> This includes some snorkelling deaths at the surface unrelated to diving the Arch.<ref>[https://www.nightjartravel.com/magazine/fatal-attraction FATAL ATTRACTION] Theodora Sutcliffe</ref> The majority of diver fatalities were experienced, including highly trained technical divers and diving instructors. The Egyptian Chamber For Diving & Watersports (CDWS) now stations a policeman at the Blue Hole to ensure divers are diving with a certified guide who will make sure safety procedures are followed.\n\nThe ceiling of the Arch is 55&nbsp;m (170&nbsp;ft) deep, which requires suitable training and equipment as 40 metres is generally considered the limit for recreational diving. The Arch presents little problem for suitably qualified technical divers. The main challenge is gas management because any lingering or errors at this depth, plus the time to negotiate the horizontal section, will need more than a single tank of [[breathing gas]] to do safely. If gas is not carefully planned the diver may lack sufficient air for the decompression stops or run out of air altogether.\n\nThe main reasons suggested for the accident rate include that the:\n* Notoriety of the site attracts divers and presents a challenge that tempts many who lack the necessary experience or qualifications.\n* Accessibility of the site and the clear, warm waters of the Red Sea makes the dive look more benign that it is. At over 55&nbsp;m, and with an overhead environment, the dive requires advanced technical certification, the Tech 60 as a minimum. \n* Deceptive entry to the Arch is not easy to find because of the indirect line between the Blue Hole and open water. Divers who miss the entry may inadvertently continue to descend past it, while the floor continues on down to well over 100&nbsp;m providing no visual depth reference.<ref name=divgrave/>\n* Time taken to pass through the Arch may be underestimated. The tunnel appears shorter than it actually is because of the clarity of the water, the light at the outside end and the lack of reference points; divers report that the tunnel appears to be less than 10&nbsp;m long but has been measured as 26&nbsp;m.  Moreover, there is frequently a current flowing inward through the arch into the Blue Hole, increasing the time it takes to swim through and increasing gas consumption. \n* Depth and the time taken to find and navigate the tunnel inevitably makes this dive a decompression dive requiring possibly lengthy [[Decompression (diving)|decompression stops]] on ascent in order to avoid [[decompression sickness]] (DCS). Also, the rate of diving gas consumption increases with depth resulting in divers either becoming out of gas or beginning the ascent with insufficient gas to make the decompression stops required.\n* Likelihood of [[nitrogen narcosis]] is significant at this depth, causing confusion leading to poor judgement in an already demanding situation. Although the effects of nitrogen narcosis may be mitigated by using heliox the Arch is insufficiently deep to warrant its use.\n* Temptation to dive on a single gas tank. Theoretically, the Arch can be dived on a single 11 Litre tank, and often has been, but this is dangerously close to the minimum gas requirement for the dive and depends on a relaxed diver with a low gas consumption rate committing no errors or hesitations during the dive. Diving the Arch without a stage tank and without rigorous [[Scuba gas planning|gas planning]] has resulted in drowning or DCS.\n[[Image:Dahab Blue Hole Arc 2009.jpg|thumb|Technical diver passing under the Arch.]]\n[[Image:Blue Hole 2005.JPG|thumb|Beach and surface of the water at Blue Hole]]\n[[Image:Blue Hole Sinai-Free Diving.jpg|thumb|upright|Two [[Free-diving|freedivers]] at Blue Hole.]]\n\n===Yuri Lipski===\nA notable death was that of Yuri Lipski, a 22-year-old [[Russian people in Israel|Russian-Israeli]] diving instructor on 28 April 2000 at a depth of 115 metres after an uncontrolled descent.<ref name=\"Spiegel2012\" /><ref name=\"CairoSceneOmar\">{{Cite web|url= http://www.cairoscene.com/LifeStyle/Egyptian-Diver-Tarek-Omar-The-Keeper-of-Dahab-s-Divers-Cemetery |title= Egyptian Diver Tarek Omar: The Keeper of Dahab's Divers' Cemetery|first= Niveen|last= Ghoneim|publisher= Cairo Scene|date= October 20, 2016|access-date= August 27, 2017}}</ref> Yuri carried a video camera, which filmed his death.

He participated in various battles and campaigns throughout the [[Pacific War]] and was eventually shot down and killed over [[Leyte]], [[Philippines]] on 24 November 1944. He was officially credited with destroying nine enemy aircraft.\n\n==Early career==\nAyao Shirane enrolled in the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy]] in April 1933 and graduated from 64th class in March 1937. He completed an aerial training program and became a fighter pilot in March 1939. He was assigned to 12th Air Group in [[Central China]] in September and on 19 August 1940 participated in [[Bombing of Chongqing]]. It was the first time the new [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] fighters were used in a combat mission, however no aerial opposition was encountered on that day. On September 13, he was one of the 13 A6M Zeros that were led to [[Hankow]] by Sabur\u014d Shindo, where in the aerial battle IJN pilots managed to claim 27 enemy fighters shot down without suffering any losses. Even though this was [[Lieutenant Junior Grade|Lieutenant (jg)]] Shirane's first aerial combat, he managed to shot down one of the enemy fighters. He was promoted to full [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] in May 1941.\n\n==Pacific War==\nAt the start of Pacific War, Lieutenant Shirane was transferred to carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']] and participated in several early battles, including [[Attack on Darwin]] and [[Indian Ocean Raid]]. He was eventually appointed flight division leader ([[buntaich\u014d]]) of ''Akagi'''s fighter squadron. He participated in [[Battle of Midway]] and on 4 June 1942 led a Combat Air Patrol (CAP) that engaged [[United States Navy]] (USN) torpedo bombers. Nevertheless, his carrier was attacked and sank by [[Douglas SBD Dauntless]] dive bombers.\n\nIn July 1942, Lieutenant Shirane was transferred to carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|''Zuikaku'']] and became its fighter squadron leader. In late October 1942, he participated in the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]]. He led nine A6M Zeros that escorted the second wave strike on USN carriers, consisting of 27 [[Aichi D3A]] dive bombers under the command of Lieutenant [[Sadamu Takahashi]] (''Zuikaku'' dive bomber squadron leader and [[hik\u014dtaich\u014d]]). They however could not locate the enemy carriers since Takahashi failed to receive the report on updated position of USN fleet. Nevertheless, carrier ''[[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|Enterprise]]'' was badly damaged by the first wave strike commanded by [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Mamoru Seki]], which included his academy classmate Lieutenant [[Keiichi Arima]] who led one of the dive bomber divisions.\n\nIn late October 1942, Lieutenant Shirane participated in the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]]. He led eight A6M Zero fighters to escort the first strike wave on USN carriers, which consisted of 21 Aichi D3A dive bombers and 20 [[Nakajima B5N]] torpedo bombers and was under the command of Lieutenant Commander [[Shigeharu Murata]]. His fighter group was involved in intense aerial combat over the USN fleet, where they shot down several [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]] fighters and in return lost several of their own Zeros. After USN strikes damaged carriers [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dkaku|''Sh\u014dkaku'']] and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuih\u014d|''Zuih\u014d'']], remaining ''Zuikaku'' and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Jun'y\u014d|''Jun'y\u014d'']] launched follow-up strikes against USN carriers. Shirane again led Zeros to escort the bombers.\n\nOn 1 November 1943, Shirane was promoted to Lieutenant Commander and was transferred to 341st Air Group, which operated the new [[Kawanishi N1K]] fighters. On 24 November, he was shot down and killed over [[Leyte]], [[Philippines]] while he was engaged in a combat with [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]] fighters.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n; Sources\n*{{cite book |last       = Hata\n |first      = Ikuhiko\n |author2    = Yasuho Izawa\n |author3    = Christopher Shores\n |year       = 2011\n |title      = Japanese Naval Air Force Fighter Units and their aces, 1932-1945.\n |publisher  = Grub Street\n |location   = London, UK\n |isbn       = 9781906502843\n}}\n* {{cite book \n |last=Lundstrom \n |first=John B. \n |year=2005 \n |edition=New \n |chapter= \n |title=First Team and the Guadalcanal Campaign: Naval Fighter Combat from August to November 1942\n |publisher=Naval Institute Press \n |location=Annapolis, Maryland \n |isbn=1-59114-472-8\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |last=Lundstrom\n |first=John B. \n |year=2005 |edition=New \n |chapter= \n |title=The First Team: Pacific Naval Air Combat from Pearl Harbor to Midway \n |publisher=Naval Institute Press \n |location=Annapolis, Maryland \n |isbn=1-59114-471-X\n}}\n*{{cite book\n | last = Millman\n | first = Nicholas \n | year = 2013\n | title = A6M Zero-sen Aces 1940-42\n | publisher = Osprey Publishing\n | location =\n | series = Aircraft of the Aces #137\n | isbn = 1472821440\n }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shirane, Ayao}}\n[[Category:1916 births]]\n[[Category:Japanese naval aviators]]\n[[Category:Japanese World War II flying aces]]\n[[Category:Imperial Japanese Navy officers]]\n[[Category:1944 deaths]]\n[[Category:Imperial Japanese Naval Academy alumni]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military person\n|name= Ayao Shirane\n|birth_date=1916\n|death_date={{death date|df=y|1944|11|24}}\n|birth_place= [[Tokyo]], [[Empire of Japan]]\n|death_place= [[Leyte]], [[Philippines]]\n|image=Ayao Shirane.jpg\n|nickname= \n|allegiance= [[Empire of Japan]]\n|branch= [[File:Naval Ensign of Japan.svg|22x20px|border]] [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] ([[Imperial Japanese Navy|IJN]])\n|serviceyears=\n|rank= [[Commander]]\n|commands=\n|unit= 12st Air Group<br/>[[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']]<br/>[[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|''Zuikaku'']]\n|battles='''[[World War II]]:'''<br/>[[Second Sino-Japanese War]]<br/>[[Attack on Darwin]]<br/>[[Indian Ocean Raid]]<br/>[[Battle of Midway]]<br/>[[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]]<br/>[[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]]<br/>[[Solomon Islands Campaign]]\n|awards= \n|laterwork=\n}}\n{{Japanese name|Shirane}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Ayao Shirane'''|\u767d\u6839 \u6590\u592b|Shirane Ayao}} was an [[Flying ace|ace]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] [[ace]] pilot [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during [[World War II]].
