The band consists of three sisters: Este Haim (bass guitar and vocals), Danielle Haim (vocals and guitar) and Alana Haim (guitars, keyboards, and vocals). In addition to their primary instruments, each member is also proficient in several others. The group's pop sound on their studio work stands in contrast to the more rock-based music of their live shows.\n\nThe sisters grew up in a musical family, and began playing instruments from an early age in the [[cover band]] Rockinhaim, fronted by their parents, [[Mordechai Haim|Moti]] and Donna. The two elder sisters, Este and Danielle, began performing with the pop group Valli Girls in 2005. They released a few songs on soundtrack and compilation albums under that name, but left the group shortly after an appearance at the 2005 [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefader.com/2013/06/25/haim-best-friends-forever|title=Haim: Best Friends Forever|work=The FADER|access-date=October 19, 2017|language=en}}</ref> They formed Haim with younger sister Alana in 2007, but did not seriously consider it a professional career for some years. After Danielle became a successful touring guitarist, first with [[Jenny Lewis]] and later with [[Julian Casablancas]], Haim reformed as a full-time operation in 2012.\n\nThe group's first release, ''Forever'' (an EP released as a limited-time download), combined with positive reception at the [[South by Southwest]] festival, led to a deal with [[Polydor Records]] and a management deal with [[Jay-Z]]'s [[Roc Nation]] group in mid-2012. The band began recording material for their first album, ''[[Days Are Gone]]'', in sessions between touring dates, including appearances at the [[Glastonbury Festival]]. The album charted in the top ten in several countries, including the number-one spot in the UK, and the group had won several \"best of\" awards by the end of 2013. The group was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] at the [[57th Annual Grammy Awards]]. Their second album, ''[[Something to Tell You]]'', was released in July 2017.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news |last=Reznick |first=Melissa |date=July 6, 2017 |title= Haim Wants to Prove That Vintage Vibes Feel Just Fine Now|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/arts/music/haim-something-to-tell-you-interview.html |work=New York Times |location= New York|access-date=July 6, 2017}}</ref>  Their forthcoming third album, titled ''[[Women in Music Pt.

The band consists of three sisters: Este Haim (bass guitar and vocals), Danielle Haim (vocals and guitar) and Alana Haim (guitars, keyboards, and vocals). In addition to their primary instruments, each member is also proficient in several others. The group's pop sound on their studio work stands in contrast to the more rock-based music of their live shows.\n\nThe sisters grew up in a musical family, and began playing instruments from an early age in the [[cover band]] Rockinhaim, fronted by their parents, [[Mordechai Haim|Moti]] and Donna. The two elder sisters, Este and Danielle, began performing with the pop group Valli Girls in 2005. They released a few songs on soundtrack and compilation albums under that name, but left the group shortly after an appearance at the 2005 [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefader.com/2013/06/25/haim-best-friends-forever|title=Haim: Best Friends Forever|work=The FADER|access-date=October 19, 2017|language=en}}</ref> They formed Haim with younger sister Alana in 2007, but did not seriously consider it a professional career for some years. After Danielle became a successful touring guitarist, first with [[Jenny Lewis]] and later with [[Julian Casablancas]], Haim reformed as a full-time operation in 2012.\n\nThe group's first release, ''Forever'' (an EP released as a limited-time download), combined with positive reception at the [[South by Southwest]] festival, led to a deal with [[Polydor Records]] and a management deal with [[Jay-Z]]'s [[Roc Nation]] group in mid-2012. The band began recording material for their first album, ''[[Days Are Gone]]'', in sessions between touring dates, including appearances at the [[Glastonbury Festival]]. The album charted in the top ten in several countries, including the number-one spot in the UK, and the group had won several \"best of\" awards by the end of 2013. The group was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] at the [[57th Annual Grammy Awards]].

The page includes a dedication to the [[Electors of Saxony#Saxony-Poland|Saxon Elector]] and a list of voices and instruments.]]\n'''Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}} of 1733''', [[BWV]]&nbsp;232 I (early version), is a [[Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass]] in [[B&nbsp;minor]], composed in 1733 by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. It is an extended [[missa brevis]] ({{lang de|Kurzmesse}}, {{literal translation|short [[Mass (music)|Mass]]}}) consisting of a [[Kyrie]] in three [[movement (music)|movement]]s and a [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]] in nine movements. Bach started to compose it, partly based on earlier work, after the death of his sovereign [[Augustus the Strong]] (1&nbsp;February 1733), dedicating it to the latter's son and successor, [[Frederick August II]], in a letter dated 27&nbsp;July 1733. At the time, Bach was in his tenth year as [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church musician in [[Leipzig]], while the [[Catholic]] court of the sovereign [[Electors of Saxony#Saxony-Poland|Elector of Saxony]] was located in [[Dresden]]. Bach sent performance parts of his {{lang|la|Missa}} to Dresden while he kept the [[autograph score]] in Leipzig. Upon arrival in Dresden, the Mass was not added to the repertoire of the Catholic [[court chapel]], but instead the parts, and Bach's dedication letter, were archived in the sovereign's library.\n\nThe composition, also known as Bach's '''Mass for the Dresden court''', is an unusually extended work scored for five-part [[SATB|SSATB]] soloists and choir with an orchestra having a broad [[Wind instrument|winds section]]. After reusing some of its music in a cantata he composed around 1745 ([[BWV 191]]), Bach finally [[Mass in B minor structure|incorporated the 1733 ''Missa'' as the first of four parts]] of his [[Mass in B&nbsp;minor]], composed/assembled in the last years of his life, around 1748\u20131749. It seems unlikely that the 1733 Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass, either in its original form or as part of the Mass in B&nbsp;minor, was ever performed during Bach's lifetime.\n\nThe Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass was not assigned a separate number in the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis|BWV catalogue]], but in order to distinguish it from the later complete mass ({{nowrap|[[BWV 232]]}}), numbers like '''{{nowrap|BWV 232a}}''' and {{nowrap|'''BWV 232<sup>I</sup>'''}} are in use.<ref name=\"Laurson\" />{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} In 2005 [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the Mass in the [[New Bach Edition]] series as '''{{lang|de|Missa, {{nowrap|BWV 232 I,}} Fassung von 1733}}''' (i.e. 1733 version of [[Missa, BWV&nbsp;232&nbsp;I]]), in a volume of early versions of the Mass in B&nbsp;minor.<ref name=\"B\u00e4renreiter\" /> That volume also contained early versions of the Credo (BWV 232 II) and Sanctus (BWV 232 III) of the later Mass.<ref name=\"B\u00e4renreiter\" /> Bach's Mass for the Dresden court is also referred to as '''''{{nowrap|Missa 1733}}'''''<ref name=\"Grob\" /> and \"The {{lang|la|Missa}} of 1733\".<ref name=\"Butt\" /> The [[Bach Digital]] website refers to the work as \"BWV 232/I (Fr\u00fchfassung)\", i.e. early version of [[Mass in B minor#I. Kyrie and Gloria (\"Missa\")|Part I of BWV&nbsp;232]].<ref name=\"BDW0290\">Bach Digital Work {{BDW|0290}} at {{url|www.bach-digital.de}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Bach's church music in Latin}}\nBach was a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church musician, devoted to the composition of sacred music in German. He wrote more than 200 [[Church cantata (Bach)|cantatas for the liturgy]], most of them in [[Leipzig]] from 1723 to 1726 at the beginning of his tenure as ''[[Thomaskantor]]'', responsible for the music at the major churches. In Leipzig, a university city where Latin was understood, musical settings of the traditional Latin texts were performed on festive holidays. Bach composed [[Bach's church music in Latin|works on Latin texts]], for example a [[Magnificat in E-flat major, BWV 243a|Magnificat]] in 1723, performed both on the Marian feast [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]] and Christmas that year, and in 1724 a [[Sanctus]] for Christmas, which he later integrated into his [[Mass in B minor structure#Sanctus|Mass in B minor]].<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref name=\"Steinitz\" /> Both works were exceptional settings: the Magnificat extended to five vocal parts and the Sanctus to six voices, when four-part singing was common in Leipzig.<ref name=\"Rathey\" />\n\n=== Bach's intentions with the composition ===\n[[Augustus the Strong]], [[List of Polish monarchs#Elective Kings of Poland (Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth)|King of Poland]] and [[Electorate of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]], died on 1 February 1733. He had converted to the [[Catholic Church]] in order to ascend to the throne of Poland in 1697. During a period of mourning, no cantata performances were permitted in Leipzig, interrupting Bach's normal work of a weekly cantata performance. Bach was free to compose a Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass for the court of Dresden,<ref name=\"Leipzig\" /><ref name=\"Leisinger\" /> where the successor was the later [[Augustus III of Poland]]. Bach presented the parts of the works to him with a note dated 27 July 1733, in the hope of obtaining the title \"Saxon Electoral Court Composer\":\n{{quote|In deepest Devotion I present to your Royal Highness this small product of that science which I have attained in Musique, with the most humble request that you will deign to regard it not according to the imperfection of its Composition, but with a most gracious eye&nbsp;... and thus take me into your most mighty Protection.<ref name=\"Talbeck\" />}}\nA different translation of this polite understatement{{sfn|Wolff|2013|p=11}} is \"an insignificant product of the skill I have attained in music.\"<ref name=\"WDL\" /> In the note, Bach also complained that he had \"innocently suffered one injury or another\" in [[Leipzig]].<ref>An English translation of the letter is given in Hans T.

At least the panache with which Bach showed off as a versatile composer, only six years after openly choosing the Lutheran side at the death of the new elector's mother, must be admired.\n\nFor the music, Bach borrowed extensively from his previous cantata compositions.{{sfn|Wolff|2013|p=11}} Bach may have had the capabilities of the singers and instrumentalists of the Dresden [[court chapel]] (which served the Hofkirche) in mind when composing the piece: at the time these included [[Johann Georg Pisendel]] (violinist and [[concert master]]), Johann Christian Richter (oboist), and the flautists [[Pierre-Gabriel Buffardin]] and Johann Joachim Quantz.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013|pp=46-47}} These performers, versed in the French as well as Italian performance styles, were the best of what could be found anywhere in Europe.<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" /> The new elector's taste for the operatic genre was no secret either.<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" /> For church music the [[Neapolitan mass]] came closest to that genre, and this was the preferred Mass type at the Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} Bach was no doubt aware that apart from the excellent instrumentalists, the Dresden Hofkapelle (\"court chapel\") also had vocal soloists at its disposal (such as [[Faustina Bordoni]], the wife of [[Johann Adolph Hasse]]) who could excel in the type of arias that was customary in operas and Neapolitan masses.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" />\n\nThe score Bach sent to Dresden consisted of the separate parts for [[Soprano]] I, Soprano II, [[Alto]], [[Tenor]], [[Bass (voice type)|Bass]], [[Trumpet]] I, Trumpet II, Trumpet III, [[Timpani]], [[Corno da caccia|Corno da Caccia]], [[Flauto traverso]] I, Flauto traverso II, [[Oboe]] ([[Oboe d'amore|d'amore]]) I, Oboe (d'amore) II, Oboe (d'amore) III, [[Violin]]s I (2 copies), Violins II, [[Viola]], [[Cello]], [[Bassoon]] and [[Basso continuo]].

The repertoire performed there included over thirty masses consisting of only a Kyrie and Gloria. Many of these were composed or acquired by the court composer at the time [[Jan Dismas Zelenka]]; and in most cases, as also happened with Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}}, these were later expanded into a complete mass ([[missa tota]]), or at least a Mass with all the usual Mass sections except the Credo ([[missa senza credo]]). Nor the fact that Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}} was composed for virtuoso performers, nor that it was a composition requiring a [[SATB|SSATB]] choir could be considered exceptional at the time and place.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\nThe [[key signature]] of the mass was somewhat exceptional: the Hofkirche 1765 catalogue<ref>Janice B. Stockigt. \"\u201cCATALOGO (THEMATICO) [SIC] DELLA MUSICA DI CHIESA (CATHOLICA [SIC] IN DRESDA) COMPOSTA DA DIVERSI AUTORI \u2013 SECONDO L\u2019ALFABETTO '''1765'''\u201d: AN INTRODUCTION\"</ref> contains only one Mass in B minor, by [[Antonio Caldara]]. [[D major]], the relative major key of B minor (i.e. with the same accidentals), was the most usual key for festive music including trumpets, because of the Saxon [[natural trumpet]]: all of Zelenka's solemn masses were in that key, but also 6 of the 12 movements of Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}} (including the Christe eleison and the opening and closing movements of the Gloria) have that same key signature. The most exceptional feature of Bach's mass appears to have been its duration, which largely exceeded what was usual compared to similar compositions at the time in Dresden. This seems the most likely reason why the composition was filed in the Royal Library upon arrival in Dresden, instead of being added to the repertoire of the Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\nAs for the result of his petition to the new ruler in Dresden: some three years after his request Bach received the title of Royal Court Composer.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} In the intermediate period the Elector had other business to attend to: the [[War of the Polish Succession#Poland|War of the Polish Succession]].\n\n=== Performance history before being integrated in the Mass in B minor, BWV 232 ===\n[[File:Dresden Sophienkirche Lithographie.jpg|thumb|[[Sophienkirche, Dresden]], possibly the location of a first performance]]\nIt is debated if the {{lang|la|Missa}} was performed at the time.<ref name=\"Butt\" /> If it was performed, the most likely venue was the Sophienkirche in Dresden, where Bach's son [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach|Wilhelm Friedemann]] had been organist since June.<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref>The details added in this section are from Christoph Wolff \"Bach\", III, 7 (\u00a7&nbsp;8), ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove Music Online]]'' ed., L.

Bach made changes{{vague|date=November 2014}} to that score when he completed the mass.<ref name=\"Leisinger Interview\" />\n\nThe work is scored for five vocal parts, two [[soprano]]s, [[alto]], [[tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]], and an [[Baroque instruments|orchestra]] of three trumpets, timpani, corno da caccia, two flauti traversi, two oboes, two oboes d'amore, two bassoons, two violins, viola, and basso continuo.\n\nThe [[Mass in B minor structure#Parts and movements|Kyrie]] is structured in three movements. Two different choral movements frame a duet for two sopranos. The [[Mass in B minor structure#Gloria|Gloria]] is structured in nine movements in a symmetric arrangement around a duet of soprano and tenor.\n\nThe {{lang|la|Missa}} of 1733 forms a considerable part of the Mass in B minor which publisher [[Hans Georg N\u00e4geli]] described in 1818 as \"the greatest musical art work of all times and nations\" when he tried a first publication.<ref name=\"WDL\" />\n\n== Publication ==\n\nIn 2005, [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the work, titled \"Missa, BWV 232 I, Fassung von 1733\", as part of the [[Neue Bach Ausgabe]].

It is an extended [[missa brevis]] ({{lang de|Kurzmesse}}, {{literal translation|short [[Mass (music)|Mass]]}}) consisting of a [[Kyrie]] in three [[movement (music)|movement]]s and a [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]] in nine movements. Bach started to compose it, partly based on earlier work, after the death of his sovereign [[Augustus the Strong]] (1&nbsp;February 1733), dedicating it to the latter's son and successor, [[Frederick August II]], in a letter dated 27&nbsp;July 1733. At the time, Bach was in his tenth year as [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church musician in [[Leipzig]], while the [[Catholic]] court of the sovereign [[Electors of Saxony#Saxony-Poland|Elector of Saxony]] was located in [[Dresden]]. Bach sent performance parts of his {{lang|la|Missa}} to Dresden while he kept the [[autograph score]] in Leipzig. Upon arrival in Dresden, the Mass was not added to the repertoire of the Catholic [[court chapel]], but instead the parts, and Bach's dedication letter, were archived in the sovereign's library.\n\nThe composition, also known as Bach's '''Mass for the Dresden court''', is an unusually extended work scored for five-part [[SATB|SSATB]] soloists and choir with an orchestra having a broad [[Wind instrument|winds section]]. After reusing some of its music in a cantata he composed around 1745 ([[BWV 191]]), Bach finally [[Mass in B minor structure|incorporated the 1733 ''Missa'' as the first of four parts]] of his [[Mass in B&nbsp;minor]], composed/assembled in the last years of his life, around 1748\u20131749. It seems unlikely that the 1733 Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass, either in its original form or as part of the Mass in B&nbsp;minor, was ever performed during Bach's lifetime.\n\nThe Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass was not assigned a separate number in the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis|BWV catalogue]], but in order to distinguish it from the later complete mass ({{nowrap|[[BWV 232]]}}), numbers like '''{{nowrap|BWV 232a}}''' and {{nowrap|'''BWV 232<sup>I</sup>'''}} are in use.<ref name=\"Laurson\" />{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} In 2005 [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the Mass in the [[New Bach Edition]] series as '''{{lang|de|Missa, {{nowrap|BWV 232 I,}} Fassung von 1733}}''' (i.e. 1733 version of [[Missa, BWV&nbsp;232&nbsp;I]]), in a volume of early versions of the Mass in B&nbsp;minor.<ref name=\"B\u00e4renreiter\" /> That volume also contained early versions of the Credo (BWV 232 II) and Sanctus (BWV 232 III) of the later Mass.<ref name=\"B\u00e4renreiter\" /> Bach's Mass for the Dresden court is also referred to as '''''{{nowrap|Missa 1733}}'''''<ref name=\"Grob\" /> and \"The {{lang|la|Missa}} of 1733\".<ref name=\"Butt\" /> The [[Bach Digital]] website refers to the work as \"BWV 232/I (Fr\u00fchfassung)\", i.e. early version of [[Mass in B minor#I.

He wrote more than 200 [[Church cantata (Bach)|cantatas for the liturgy]], most of them in [[Leipzig]] from 1723 to 1726 at the beginning of his tenure as ''[[Thomaskantor]]'', responsible for the music at the major churches. In Leipzig, a university city where Latin was understood, musical settings of the traditional Latin texts were performed on festive holidays. Bach composed [[Bach's church music in Latin|works on Latin texts]], for example a [[Magnificat in E-flat major, BWV 243a|Magnificat]] in 1723, performed both on the Marian feast [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]] and Christmas that year, and in 1724 a [[Sanctus]] for Christmas, which he later integrated into his [[Mass in B minor structure#Sanctus|Mass in B minor]].<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref name=\"Steinitz\" /> Both works were exceptional settings: the Magnificat extended to five vocal parts and the Sanctus to six voices, when four-part singing was common in Leipzig.<ref name=\"Rathey\" />\n\n=== Bach's intentions with the composition ===\n[[Augustus the Strong]], [[List of Polish monarchs#Elective Kings of Poland (Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth)|King of Poland]] and [[Electorate of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]], died on 1 February 1733. He had converted to the [[Catholic Church]] in order to ascend to the throne of Poland in 1697. During a period of mourning, no cantata performances were permitted in Leipzig, interrupting Bach's normal work of a weekly cantata performance. Bach was free to compose a Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass for the court of Dresden,<ref name=\"Leipzig\" /><ref name=\"Leisinger\" /> where the successor was the later [[Augustus III of Poland]]. Bach presented the parts of the works to him with a note dated 27 July 1733, in the hope of obtaining the title \"Saxon Electoral Court Composer\":\n{{quote|In deepest Devotion I present to your Royal Highness this small product of that science which I have attained in Musique, with the most humble request that you will deign to regard it not according to the imperfection of its Composition, but with a most gracious eye&nbsp;... and thus take me into your most mighty Protection.<ref name=\"Talbeck\" />}}\nA different translation of this polite understatement{{sfn|Wolff|2013|p=11}} is \"an insignificant product of the skill I have attained in music.\"<ref name=\"WDL\" /> In the note, Bach also complained that he had \"innocently suffered one injury or another\" in [[Leipzig]].<ref>An English translation of the letter is given in Hans T.

At least the panache with which Bach showed off as a versatile composer, only six years after openly choosing the Lutheran side at the death of the new elector's mother, must be admired.\n\nFor the music, Bach borrowed extensively from his previous cantata compositions.{{sfn|Wolff|2013|p=11}} Bach may have had the capabilities of the singers and instrumentalists of the Dresden [[court chapel]] (which served the Hofkirche) in mind when composing the piece: at the time these included [[Johann Georg Pisendel]] (violinist and [[concert master]]), Johann Christian Richter (oboist), and the flautists [[Pierre-Gabriel Buffardin]] and Johann Joachim Quantz.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013|pp=46-47}} These performers, versed in the French as well as Italian performance styles, were the best of what could be found anywhere in Europe.<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" /> The new elector's taste for the operatic genre was no secret either.<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" /> For church music the [[Neapolitan mass]] came closest to that genre, and this was the preferred Mass type at the Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} Bach was no doubt aware that apart from the excellent instrumentalists, the Dresden Hofkapelle (\"court chapel\") also had vocal soloists at its disposal (such as [[Faustina Bordoni]], the wife of [[Johann Adolph Hasse]]) who could excel in the type of arias that was customary in operas and Neapolitan masses.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" />\n\nThe score Bach sent to Dresden consisted of the separate parts for [[Soprano]] I, Soprano II, [[Alto]], [[Tenor]], [[Bass (voice type)|Bass]], [[Trumpet]] I, Trumpet II, Trumpet III, [[Timpani]], [[Corno da caccia|Corno da Caccia]], [[Flauto traverso]] I, Flauto traverso II, [[Oboe]] ([[Oboe d'amore|d'amore]]) I, Oboe (d'amore) II, Oboe (d'amore) III, [[Violin]]s I (2 copies), Violins II, [[Viola]], [[Cello]], [[Bassoon]] and [[Basso continuo]]. Most of these copies were written by Bach himself, but for the last movements of both Kyrie and Gloria his sons [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|Carl Philipp Emanuel]] (soprano parts), [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach|Wilhelm Friedemann]] (violino I parts), and his wife [[Anna Magdalena Bach|Anna Magdalena]] (cello parts) helped, along with an anonymous copyist (oboe and basso continuo parts).<ref>[http://www.bach-digital.de/receive/BachDigitalSource_source_00002721 D-Dl Mus.2405-D-21] at Dresden, S\u00e4chsische Landesbibliothek \u2013 Staats- und Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek (University library), available online at {{url|bach-digital.de}}</ref> Performance material for the choir was not included, nor was the basso continuo part very elaborated.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013|p=53}} All these parts appear to have been copied directly from the full score, which Bach kept in Leipzig.<ref name=\"Butt\" /> Bach supplied the parts for single performers with many details that are not in the score he kept.<ref name=\"Leisinger Interview\" />\n[[File:Dresden Inneres der Hofkapelle 1719.jpg|thumb|500px|Interior of the Hofkirche (Hofkapelle){{efn|Court chapel: in this instance referring to the church building; other instances of Hofkapelle/court chapel in this article generally refer to [[chapel (music)|chapel as an ensemble of musicians]], directed by a [[chapel master]] (Kapellmeister).}} in 1719<ref>Hubert Ermisch. ''[[:File:Ermisch Das alte Archivgeb\u00e4ude am Taschenberge in Dresden.pdf|Das alte Archivgeb\u00e4ude am Taschenberge in Dresden: Ein Erinnerungsblatt]]''. Dresden: Baensch, 1888.</ref>]]\nAlthough some commentators suggest other liturgical and worldly venues where Bach may have anticipated a performance of the {{lang|la|Missa}},{{sfn|Stockigt|2013|p=41}} there seems little doubt that Bach intended to tailor the piece so that it could be performed at the Dresden Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\n=== Reception at the Dresden court ===\nWhen the composition arrived in Dresden its format wasn't very unusual compared to other works performed at the time at the Hofkirche. The repertoire performed there included over thirty masses consisting of only a Kyrie and Gloria. Many of these were composed or acquired by the court composer at the time [[Jan Dismas Zelenka]]; and in most cases, as also happened with Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}}, these were later expanded into a complete mass ([[missa tota]]), or at least a Mass with all the usual Mass sections except the Credo ([[missa senza credo]]). Nor the fact that Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}} was composed for virtuoso performers, nor that it was a composition requiring a [[SATB|SSATB]] choir could be considered exceptional at the time and place.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\nThe [[key signature]] of the mass was somewhat exceptional: the Hofkirche 1765 catalogue<ref>Janice B. Stockigt. \"\u201cCATALOGO (THEMATICO) [SIC] DELLA MUSICA DI CHIESA (CATHOLICA [SIC] IN DRESDA) COMPOSTA DA DIVERSI AUTORI \u2013 SECONDO L\u2019ALFABETTO '''1765'''\u201d: AN INTRODUCTION\"</ref> contains only one Missa in B minor, by [[Antonio Caldara]]. [[D major]], the relative major key of B minor (i.e. with the same accidentals), was the most usual key for festive music including trumpets, because of the Saxon [[natural trumpet]]: all of Zelenka's solemn masses were in that key, but also 6 of the 12 movements of Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}} (including the Christe eleison and the opening and closing movements of the Gloria) have that same key signature. The most exceptional feature of Bach's mass appears to have been its duration, which largely exceeded what was usual compared to similar compositions at the time in Dresden. This seems the most likely reason why the composition was filed in the Royal Library upon arrival in Dresden, instead of being added to the repertoire of the Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\nAs for the result of his petition to the new ruler in Dresden: some three years after his request Bach received the title of Royal Court Composer.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} In the intermediate period the Elector had other business to attend to: the [[War of the Polish Succession#Poland|War of the Polish Succession]].\n\n=== Performance history before being integrated in the Mass in B minor, BWV 232 ===\n[[File:Dresden Sophienkirche Lithographie.jpg|thumb|[[Sophienkirche, Dresden]], possibly the location of a first performance]]\nIt is debated if the {{lang|la|Missa}} was performed at the time.<ref name=\"Butt\" /> If it was performed, the most likely venue was the Sophienkirche in Dresden, where Bach's son [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach|Wilhelm Friedemann]] had been organist since June.<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref>The details added in this section are from Christoph Wolff \"Bach\", III, 7 (\u00a7&nbsp;8), ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove Music Online]]'' ed., L. Macy. http://www.grovemusic.com/ . Last accessed August 9, 2007.</ref>\n\nAround 1745 Bach used three movements of the [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]] of the {{lang|la|Missa}} of 1733 for his cantata [[Gloria in excelsis Deo, BWV 191|''Gloria in excelsis Deo'', BWV 191]].<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref name=\"Steinitz\" />\n\n== Scoring and structure \u2014 incorporation in the Mass in B minor, BWV 232 ==\n{{Main|Mass in B minor structure}}\n\nIn the last years of his life, presumably around 1748\u20131749, Bach integrated the complete {{lang|la|Missa}} of 1733 unchanged in his [[Mass in B minor]], his only missa tota.<ref name=\"Laurson\" /> Scoring and structure are identical with the later work, but markings differ because the parts contain more details than the 1733 score which he kept. Bach made changes{{vague|date=November 2014}} to that score when he completed the mass.<ref name=\"Leisinger Interview\" />\n\nThe work is scored for five vocal parts, two [[soprano]]s, [[alto]], [[tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]], and an [[Baroque instruments|orchestra]] of three trumpets, timpani, corno da caccia, two flauti traversi, two oboes, two oboes d'amore, two bassoons, two violins, viola, and basso continuo.\n\nThe [[Mass in B minor structure#Parts and movements|Kyrie]] is structured in three movements. Two different choral movements frame a duet for two sopranos. The [[Mass in B minor structure#Gloria|Gloria]] is structured in nine movements in a symmetric arrangement around a duet of soprano and tenor.\n\nThe {{lang|la|Missa}} of 1733 forms a considerable part of the Mass in B minor which publisher [[Hans Georg N\u00e4geli]] described in 1818 as \"the greatest musical art work of all times and nations\" when he tried a first publication.<ref name=\"WDL\" />\n\n== Publication ==\n\nIn 2005, [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the work, titled \"Missa, BWV 232 I, Fassung von 1733\", as part of the [[Neue Bach Ausgabe]].

He is said to have been descended from Prophet Mohammed's daughter [[Fatimah]]. Hence the Sheikh belonged to the [[Ashraf]] or [[Sayyid|Sada]], titles given to the descendants of the prophet. He married two local women in Somalia that left him eight sons, one of them being Abdirahman (Awal). The descendants of those eight sons are the what is known as Isaaq clan today.\n\nThe grave of Zubeyr Awal, the eponymous ancestor of the [[Habar Awal]] subclan of the [[Isaaq]], is located in Jidali in [[Sanaag]] which is about 100&nbsp;km east of the tomb of his grandfather and founding father of the [[Isaaq]] clan [[Sheikh Isaaq Bin Ahmed Al Hashimi]], whose tomb is located in the coastal town of [[Maydh]].\n\n===Medieval Period (Conquest of Abbysinia)===\n\nHistorically the Habar Awal were part of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and are mentioned in the famous \"Futuh Al-Habash\" for their major contributions in the [[Abyssinian-Adal war]] as the Habar Magaadle along with the [[Garhajis]], Arap and Ayub clans against the [[Abyssinian empire]], and also for producing a historical figure known as Ahmad Girri bin Husain who was the righthand partner of [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] and a chieftain for the Habar Magaadle forces during the Abyssinian\u2013Adal war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://makhtota.ksu.edu.sa/makhtota/554/16|title=\u0645\u062e\u0637\u0648\u0637\u0627\u062a > \u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 > \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u062d\u0629 \u0631\u0642\u0645 16|website=makhtota.ksu.edu.sa|access-date=2017-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Early Modern Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal have a rich mercantile history largely due to their possession of the major Somali port of [[Berbera]], which was the chief port and settlement of Habr Awal clan during the early modern period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reerahmednuux.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/piece-of-berbera-history-reer-ahmed-nuh-ismail/ |title=Piece of Berbera History: Reer Ahmed Nuh Ismail |website=wordpress.com|date=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Habr Awal as a whole are a rich people, mainly thanks to the trade passing though the port of Berbera which lies in the territory of the Sa\u2019ad Musa.<ref>{{cite book|title= Ethnographic Survey of Africa, Volume 5 |date=1969|pages=24|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Berbera Mosque Engraving.jpg|thumb|350px|Engraving of Berbera, including a Mosque and fort]]\nThe Habr Awal merchants had extensive trade relations with Arab and Indian merchants from Arabia and the Indian subcontinent respectively. When these foreign traders arrived in [[Berbera]] and [[Bulhar]] to conduct trade, there was a mutually beneficial arrangement based on the abban (protection) system between them and the local Ahmed Nuh and Yunis Nuh lineages of Sa\u2019ad Musa, Habr Awal:\n\n<blockquote>Before this, and prior to the British settlement at Aden in 1839, the Ayyal Yunis and Ayyal Ahmed lineages of the Habr Awal clan had held Berbera and jointly managed its trade, sharing in the profits on all commercial transactions as \u2018protectors\u2019 (abans) of foreign merchants from Arabia and India. When under the stimulus of developments at Aden the port\u2019s prosperity markedly increased, the numerically dominant Ayyal Yunis drove out their rival kinsmen and declared themselves commercial masters of Berbera. This led to a feud in which each side sought outside help; the defeated Ayyal Yunis turned to Haji Shirmarke \u2018Ali and his Habr Yunis clansmen for support. With this backing, they were then able to re-establish themselves and to expel the Ayyal Yunis who moved to the small roadstead of Bulhar, some miles to the west of Berbera.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=I.M.|title= The Modern History of Somaliland: from Nation to State |date=1965|publisher=Praeger|pages=35|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNot only did the Habr Awal host foreign merchants at their ports, they also conducted trade missions on their own vessels to the Arabian ports<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prichard|first1=J.

The majority of the Somali merchants who frequented Aden and other Southern Arabian ports hailed from the Habr Awal clan. They procured various raw goods from Harar and the interior in exchange for manufactured goods. During their stay, the Habr Awal rented their own houses and hired their own servants, whereas other Somali clans tended to stay with relatives already established across the Gulf. \n\n<blockquote>Merchants. \u2014 These are generally members of the Habr Awal tribe. They bring from Harrar and the Galla country, coffee, saffron (bastard), tusks (ivory), and feathers, taking away in return zinc, brass, broad cloth, and piece goods. They remain in Aden for about twenty days at a time during the trading season, which lasts about nine months,' making four trips. During their residence they hire a house, and are accompanied by their own domestics.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Frederick|title=An Account of the British Settlement of Aden in Arabia|date=1877|publisher=Cengage Gale|pages=41|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the interior, Habr Awal trade caravans (khafilas) were a frequent sight according to contemporary European accounts of the Somali Peninsula:\n\n<blockquote>On leaving Hargeisa we travelled for many miles through beautiful park-like land, alive with birds and jungle fowl.

He is said to have been descended from Prophet Mohammed's daughter [[Fatimah]]. Hence the Sheikh belonged to the [[Ashraf]] or [[Sayyid|Sada]], titles given to the descendants of the prophet. He married two local women in Somalia that left him eight sons, one of them being Abdirahman (Awal). The descendants of those eight sons are the what is known as Isaaq clan today.\n\nThe grave of Zubeyr Awal, the eponymous ancestor of the [[Habar Awal]] subclan of the [[Isaaq]], is located in Jidali in [[Sanaag]] which is about 100&nbsp;km east of the tomb of his grandfather and founding father of the [[Isaaq]] clan [[Sheikh Isaaq Bin Ahmed Al Hashimi]], whose tomb is located in the coastal town of [[Maydh]].\n\n===Medieval Period (Conquest of Abbysinia)===\n\nHistorically the Habar Awal were part of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and are mentioned in the famous \"Futuh Al-Habash\" for their major contributions in the [[Abyssinian-Adal war]] as the Habar Magaadle along with the [[Garhajis]], Arap and Ayub clans against the [[Abyssinian empire]], and also for producing a historical figure known as Ahmad Girri bin Husain who was the righthand partner of [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] and a chieftain for the Habar Magaadle forces during the Abyssinian\u2013Adal war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://makhtota.ksu.edu.sa/makhtota/554/16|title=\u0645\u062e\u0637\u0648\u0637\u0627\u062a > \u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 > \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u062d\u0629 \u0631\u0642\u0645 16|website=makhtota.ksu.edu.sa|access-date=2017-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Early Modern Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal have a rich mercantile history largely due to their possession of the major Somali port of [[Berbera]], which was the chief port and settlement of Habr Awal clan during the early modern period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reerahmednuux.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/piece-of-berbera-history-reer-ahmed-nuh-ismail/ |title=Piece of Berbera History: Reer Ahmed Nuh Ismail |website=wordpress.com|date=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Habr Awal as a whole are a rich people, mainly thanks to the trade passing though the port of Berbera which lies in the territory of the Sa\u2019ad Musa.<ref>{{cite book|title= Ethnographic Survey of Africa, Volume 5 |date=1969|pages=24|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Berbera Mosque Engraving.jpg|thumb|350px|Engraving of Berbera, including a Mosque and fort]]\nThe Habr Awal merchants had extensive trade relations with Arab and Indian merchants from Arabia and the Indian subcontinent respectively. When these foreign traders arrived in Berbera and Bulhar to conduct trade, there was a mutually beneficial arrangement based on the abban (protection) system between them and the local Ahmed Nuh and Yunis Nuh lineages of Sa\u2019ad Musa, Habr Awal:\n\n<blockquote>Before this, and prior to the British settlement at Aden in 1839, the Ayyal Yunis and Ayyal Ahmed lineages of the Habr Awal clan had held Berbera and jointly managed its trade, sharing in the profits on all commercial transactions as \u2018protectors\u2019 (abans) of foreign merchants from Arabia and India. When under the stimulus of developments at Aden the port\u2019s prosperity markedly increased, the numerically dominant Ayyal Yunis drove out their rival kinsmen and declared themselves commercial masters of Berbera. This led to a feud in which each side sought outside help; the defeated Ayyal Yunis turned to Haji Shirmarke \u2018Ali and his Habr Yunis clansmen for support. With this backing, they were then able to re-establish themselves and to expel the Ayyal Yunis who moved to the small roadstead of Bulhar, some miles to the west of Berbera.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=I.M.|title= The Modern History of Somaliland: from Nation to State |date=1965|publisher=Praeger|pages=35|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNot only did the Habr Awal host foreign merchants at their ports, they also conducted trade missions on their own vessels to the Arabian ports<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prichard|first1=J.

The majority of the Somali merchants who frequented Aden and other Southern Arabian ports hailed from the Habr Awal clan. They procured various raw goods from Harar and the interior in exchange for manufactured goods. During their stay, the Habr Awal rented their own houses and hired their own servants, whereas other Somali clans tended to stay with relatives already established across the Gulf. \n\n<blockquote>Merchants. \u2014 These are generally members of the Habr Awal tribe. They bring from Harrar and the Galla country, coffee, saffron (bastard), tusks (ivory), and feathers, taking away in return zinc, brass, broad cloth, and piece goods. They remain in Aden for about twenty days at a time during the trading season, which lasts about nine months,' making four trips. During their residence they hire a house, and are accompanied by their own domestics.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Frederick|title=An Account of the British Settlement of Aden in Arabia|date=1877|publisher=Cengage Gale|pages=41|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the interior, Habr Awal trade caravans (khafilas) were a frequent sight according to contemporary European accounts of the Somali Peninsula:\n\n<blockquote>On leaving Hargeisa we travelled for many miles through beautiful park-like land, alive with birds and jungle fowl. We met the usual Somali khafilas [trading caravans] of Habr-Awal men, carrying their skins, gums, ghee, and coffee to our port at Bulhar, situated between Berbera and Zeila.<ref>'Twixt sirdar & Menelik: an account of a year's expedition from Zeila to Cairo, p. 18, 1901</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Somalis from the deep interior, principally those from the [[Ogaden (clan)|Ogaden]], also gained most of their resources from the Habr Awal merchants who they called \"iidoor\", an enviable pejorative meaning [[merchant]] or trader, a reference to the mercantile nature of the Habr Awal traders at the time.<ref name=\"Info\">Somali Poetry, Lewis & Adrzejewski, 1964, pp. 111\u2013115</ref>\n\n===British Protectorate Period===\n\nThe [[Habar Awal]] [[Sultanate]] came under the [[British Protectorate]] by signing a treaty with the [[British Empire]] on 14 July 1884.

This slowed the train a small amount before it entered the turnout travelling at a speed in excess of {{convert|100|km/h|mph}}.

The points were being worked manually and the driver should have received adequate warning as to the route the train was to take.<ref name=ABC11987230>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-21/wallan-train-derailment-union-says-track-awaiting-maintenance/11987230|title=Fatal train derailment happened on track Victorian drivers had refused to travel on|date=2020-02-21|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref>\n\nThe derailment caused major speed restrictions to be implemented on the North East line, and as a result all Melbourne XPT services currently terminate at [[Albury railway station|Albury]].\n\n==Investigation==\nThe [[Australian Transport Safety Bureau]] (ATSB) opened an investigation into the accident,<ref name=BBC51573326/> as did the [[Transport Safety Victoria|Victorian Government's]] [[Chief Investigator, Transport Safety]] (CITS).

A Train Notice had been issued reflecting a change in track conditions, and had specified a {{convert|15|km/h|mph}} speed limit for entry into the loop. Initial findings were that the train was travelling approximately {{convert|100|km/h|mph}} above the restricted limits at the time of the derailment. The report states \"At about 1943, XPT ST23 was approaching the northern end of Wallan Loop at about the track\u2019s line speed. Recordings from the train indicate an Emergency brake application a short distance before the points. This slowed the train a small amount before it entered the turnout travelling at a speed in excess of {{convert|100|km/h|mph}}. The train was not able to negotiate the turnout to the loop track at this speed and derailed. All vehicles derailed excepting the rear power car (Figure 3)\"<ref name=Prelim/>. The report referenced the fact that the issued train notice and communication with ARTC train control reflected a change and also specified a {{convert|15|km/h|mph}} speed limit for entry into the loop, and a limit of {{convert|35|km/h|mph}} for exiting the loop.\n\nThe final report is expected to take 18 months to complete.<ref name=Age230220/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{2020 railway accidents}}\n\n[[Category:Derailments in Australia]]\n[[Category:February 2020 events in Australia]]\n[[Category:NSW TrainLink]]\n[[Category:Railway accidents in 2020]]\n\n{{Use Australian English|date=February 2020}}\n", "name_user": "Heyitsstevo", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Wallan_derailment"}
