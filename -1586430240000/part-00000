Within a photon sphere, it is possible to imagine a [[photon]] that's emitted from the back of one's head, orbiting the black hole, only then to be intercepted by the person's eyes, allowing one to see the back of the head.\nFor non-rotating black holes, the photon sphere is a sphere of [[radius]] 3/2 ''r''<sub>s</sub>. There are no stable free fall orbits that exist within or cross the photon sphere.  Any free fall orbit that crosses it from the outside spirals into the black hole.  Any orbit that crosses it from the inside escapes to infinity or falls back in and spirals into the black hole. No unaccelerated orbit with a [[semi-major axis]] less than this distance is possible, but within the photon sphere, a constant acceleration will allow a spacecraft or probe to hover above the event horizon.\n\nAnother property of the photon sphere is [[centrifugal force]] (nb: not [[Centripetal force|centripetal]]) reversal.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Abramowicz|first=Marek|title=Centrifugal-force reversal near a Schwarzschild black hole|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=245|pages=720|publisher=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]], Vol. 245, NO.4/AUG15, P. 720, 1990|bibcode=1990MNRAS.245..720A|year=1990}}</ref>   Outside the photon sphere, the faster one orbits the greater the outward force one feels.  Centrifugal force falls to zero at the photon sphere, including non-freefall orbits at any speed, i.e. you weigh the same no matter how fast you orbit, and becomes negative inside it.  Inside the photon sphere the faster you orbit the greater your felt weight or inward force.  This has serious ramifications for the fluid dynamics of inward fluid flow.\n\nA [[rotating black hole]] has two photon spheres.  As a black hole rotates, it [[Frame-dragging|drags]] space with it.  The photon sphere that is closer to the black hole is moving in the same direction as the rotation, whereas the photon sphere further away is moving against it.  The greater the [[angular velocity]] of the rotation of a black hole, the greater the distance between the two photon spheres.  Since the black hole has an axis of rotation, this only holds true if approaching the black hole in the direction of the equator.  If approaching at  a different angle, such as one from the poles of the black hole to the equator, there is only one photon sphere.  This is because approaching at this angle the possibility of traveling with or against the rotation does not exist.\n\n==Derivation for a Schwarzschild black hole==\nSince a Schwarzschild black hole has spherical symmetry, all possible axes for a circular photon orbit are equivalent, and all circular orbits have the same radius.\n\nThis derivation involves using the [[Schwarzschild metric]], given by:\n\n<math>ds^{2} = \\left(1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r}\\right)c^{2}dt^{2} - \\left(1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r}\\right)^{-1}dr^{2} - r^{2}(\\textrm{sin}^{2}\\theta d\\phi^{2} + d\\theta^{2})</math>\n\nFor a photon traveling at a constant radius r (i.e. in the \u03a6-coordinate direction), <math>dr=0</math>. Since it is a photon <math>ds=0</math> (a \"light-like interval\"). We can always rotate the coordinate system such that <math>\\theta</math> is constant, <math>d\\theta=0</math>.\n\nSetting ds, dr and d\u03b8 to zero, we have:\n\n<math>\\left(1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r}\\right)c^{2}dt^{2} = r^{2}\\textrm{sin}^{2}\\theta d\\phi^{2}</math>\n\nRe-arranging gives:\n\n<math>\\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = \\frac{c}{r\\textrm{sin}\\theta}\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r}}</math>\n\nTo proceed we need the relation <math> \\frac{d\\phi}{dt} </math>. To find it, we use the radial [[geodesic equation]]\n\n<math> \\frac{d^2r}{d\\tau^2}+\\Gamma^{r}_{\\mu\\nu}u^{\\mu}u^{\\nu}=0. </math>\n\nNon vanishing <math> \\Gamma</math>-connection coefficients  are <math> \\Gamma^r_{tt}=\\frac{c^2 BB^{\\prime}}{2}, \\; \\Gamma^r_{rr}=-\\frac{B^{-1}B^{\\prime}}{2}, \\; \\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta}=-rB, \\; \\Gamma^r_{\\phi\\phi}=-Br\\sin^2\\theta </math>, where <math> B^{\\prime}=\\frac{dB}{dr}, B=1-\\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r} </math>.\n\nWe treat photon radial geodesics with constant r and <math> \\theta </math>, therefore\n\n<math> \\frac{dr}{d\\tau}, \\; \\frac{d^2r}{d\\tau^2}, \\; \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\tau}=0 </math>.\n\nSubstituting it all into the radial geodesic equation (the geodesic equation with the radial coordinate as the dependent variable), we obtain\n\n<math> \\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dt}\\right)^2=\\frac{c^2r_{\\rm s}}{2r^3\\sin^2\\theta} </math>\n\nComparing it with what was obtained previously, we have:\n\n<math>c\\sqrt{\\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{2r}} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r}}</math>\n\nwhere we have inserted <math>\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}</math> radians (imagine that the central mass, about which the photon is orbiting, is located at the centre of the coordinate axes. Then, as the photon is travelling along the <math> \\phi </math>-coordinate line, for the mass to be located directly in the centre of the photon's orbit, we must have <math>\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}</math> radians).\n\nHence, rearranging this final expression gives:\n\n<math>r = \\frac{3}{2}r_{\\rm s}</math>\n\nwhich is the result we set out to prove.\n\n==Photon orbits around a Kerr black hole==\n[[File:Kerr_photon_orbits_with_orbital_inclination_thumbnail.gif|200px|right|thumb|link=commons:File:Kerr_photon_orbits_with_orbital_inclination.gif|Views from the side (l) and from above a pole (r).

Within a photon sphere, it is possible to imagine a [[photon]] that's emitted from the back of one's head, orbiting the black hole, only then to be intercepted by the person's eyes, allowing one to see the back of the head.\nFor non-rotating black holes, the photon sphere is a sphere of [[radius]] 3/2 ''r''<sub>s</sub>. There are no stable free fall orbits that exist within or cross the photon sphere.  Any free fall orbit that crosses it from the outside spirals into the black hole.  Any orbit that crosses it from the inside escapes to infinity or falls back in and spirals into the black hole. No unaccelerated orbit with a [[semi-major axis]] less than this distance is possible, but within the photon sphere, a constant acceleration will allow a spacecraft or probe to hover above the event horizon.\n\nAnother property of the photon sphere is [[centrifugal force]] (nb: not [[Centripetal force|centripetal]]) reversal.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Abramowicz|first=Marek|title=Centrifugal-force reversal near a Schwarzschild black hole|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=245|pages=720|publisher=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]], Vol. 245, NO.4/AUG15, P. 720, 1990|bibcode=1990MNRAS.245..720A|year=1990}}</ref>   Outside the photon sphere, the faster one orbits the greater the outward force one feels.  Centrifugal force falls to zero at the photon sphere, including non-freefall orbits at any speed, i.e. you weigh the same no matter how fast you orbit, and becomes negative inside it.  Inside the photon sphere the faster you orbit the greater your felt weight or inward force.  This has serious ramifications for the fluid dynamics of inward fluid flow.\n\nA [[rotating black hole]] has two photon spheres.  As a black hole rotates, it [[Frame-dragging|drags]] space with it.  The photon sphere that is closer to the black hole is moving in the same direction as the rotation, whereas the photon sphere further away is moving against it.  The greater the [[angular velocity]] of the rotation of a black hole, the greater the distance between the two photon spheres.  Since the black hole has an axis of rotation, this only holds true if approaching the black hole in the direction of the equator.  If approaching at  a different angle, such as one from the poles of the black hole to the equator, there is only one photon sphere.  This is because approaching at this angle the possibility of traveling with or against the rotation does not exist.\n\n==Derivation for a Schwarzschild black hole==\nSince a Schwarzschild black hole has spherical symmetry, all possible axes for a circular photon orbit are equivalent, and all circular orbits have the same radius.\n\nThis derivation involves using the [[Schwarzschild metric]], given by:\n\n<math>ds^{2} = \\left(1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r}\\right)c^{2}dt^{2} - \\left(1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r}\\right)^{-1}dr^{2} - r^{2}(\\textrm{sin}^{2}\\theta d\\phi^{2} + d\\theta^{2})</math>\n\nFor a photon traveling at a constant radius r (i.e. in the \u03a6-coordinate direction), <math>dr=0</math>. Since it is a photon <math>ds=0</math> (a \"light-like interval\"). We can always rotate the coordinate system such that <math>\\theta</math> is constant, <math>d\\theta=0</math>.\n\nSetting ds, dr and d\u03b8 to zero, we have:\n\n<math>\\left(1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r}\\right)c^{2}dt^{2} = r^{2}\\textrm{sin}^{2}\\theta d\\phi^{2}</math>\n\nRe-arranging gives:\n\n<math>\\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = \\frac{c}{r\\textrm{sin}\\theta}\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r}}</math>\n\nTo proceed we need the relation <math> \\frac{d\\phi}{dt} </math>. To find it, we use the radial [[geodesic equation]]\n\n<math> \\frac{d^2r}{d\\tau^2}+\\Gamma^{r}_{\\mu\\nu}u^{\\mu}u^{\\nu}=0. </math>\n\nNon vanishing <math> \\Gamma</math>-connection coefficients  are <math> \\Gamma^r_{tt}=\\frac{c^2 BB^{\\prime}}{2}, \\; \\Gamma^r_{rr}=-\\frac{B^{-1}B^{\\prime}}{2}, \\; \\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta}=-rB, \\; \\Gamma^r_{\\phi\\phi}=-Br\\sin^2\\theta </math>, where <math> B^{\\prime}=\\frac{dB}{dr}, B=1-\\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r} </math>.\n\nWe treat photon radial geodesics with constant r and <math> \\theta </math>, therefore\n\n<math> \\frac{dr}{d\\tau}, \\; \\frac{d^2r}{d\\tau^2}, \\; \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\tau}=0 </math>.\n\nSubstituting it all into the radial geodesic equation (the geodesic equation with the radial coordinate as the dependent variable), we obtain\n\n<math> \\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dt}\\right)^2=\\frac{c^2r_{\\rm s}}{2r^3\\sin^2\\theta} </math>\n\nComparing it with what was obtained previously, we have:\n\n<math>c\\sqrt{\\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{2r}} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{r_{\\rm s}}{r}}</math>\n\nwhere we have inserted <math>\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}</math> radians (imagine that the central mass, about which the photon is orbiting, is located at the centre of the coordinate axes. Then, as the photon is travelling along the <math> \\phi </math>-coordinate line, for the mass to be located directly in the centre of the photon's orbit, we must have <math>\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}</math> radians).\n\nHence, rearranging this final expression gives:\n\n<math>r = \\frac{3}{2}r_{\\rm s}</math>\n\nwhich is the result we set out to prove.\n\n==Photon orbits around a Kerr black hole==\n[[File:Kerr_photon_orbits_with_orbital_inclination_thumbnail.gif|200px|right|thumb|link=commons:File:Kerr_photon_orbits_with_orbital_inclination.gif|Views from the side (l) and from above a pole (r).

Cramer <ref name=\":0\" /> for details and simulations of photon orbits and photon circles.

It is powered by a 998&nbsp;cc [[inline-four engine]], which is based on the [[Honda CBR1000RR|CBR1000RR Fireblade]] engine. The CBF1000 has a steel frame also based on the frame of another model, the [[Honda CBF600|CBF600]]. Produced by Honda Italia Industriale S.p.A., the CBF1000 was first available in March 2006, mainly in the European market.\n\nThe chief designers, Ishu Akari and Magnus Jaderberg, targeted riders over 30, that prefer smooth progressive acceleration combined with a relaxed riding position and easy handling. In comparison to the high-revving characteristic of the CBR1000RR's engine, the CBF1000's engine has a more level power delivery, better suited to touring and relatively inexperienced riders. Although peak power and peak torque are significantly lower than the CBR1000RR engine, power and torque are higher in the lower rev range. The CBF1000 has [[programmed fuel injection]] (PGM-FI). [[Anti-lock braking system]] is an option but a combined half-fairing is standard. The handlebars, seat height, and screen height are adjustable.\n\nThe CBF1000GT version adds a full lower fairing, panniers, and top box. The CBF1000F, a new design, was released in 2010. The major changes were a new frame, made of aluminum rather than steel, four-into-one exhaust system replacing the original four-into-two, new digital instrument panels, and a redesigned fairing/screen. Power was also increased while weight and fuel consumption were reduced.{{citation-needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n== Specifications ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Specifications\n|-\n! \n!

It is powered by a 998&nbsp;cc [[inline-four engine]], which is based on the [[Honda CBR1000RR|CBR1000RR Fireblade]] engine. The CBF1000 has a steel frame also based on the frame of another model, the [[Honda CBF600|CBF600]]. Produced by Honda Italia Industriale S.p.A., the CBF1000 was first available in March 2006, mainly in the European market.\n\nThe chief designers, Ishu Akari and Magnus Jaderberg, targeted riders over 30, that prefer smooth progressive acceleration combined with a relaxed riding position and easy handling. In comparison to the high-revving characteristic of the CBR1000RR\u2019s engine, the CBF1000's engine has a more level power delivery, better suited to touring and relatively inexperienced riders. Although peak power and peak torque are significantly lower than the CBR1000RR engine, power and torque are higher in the lower rev range. The CBF1000 has [[programmed fuel injection]] (PGM-FI). [[Anti-lock braking system]] is an option but a combined half-fairing is standard. The handlebars, seat height, and screen height are adjustable.\n\nThe CBF1000GT version adds a full lower fairing, panniers, and top box. The CBF1000F, a new design, was released in 2010. The major changes were a new frame, made of aluminum rather than steel, four-into-one exhaust system replacing the original four-into-two, new digital instrument panels, and a redesigned fairing/screen. Power was also increased while weight and fuel consumption were reduced.{{citation-needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n== Specifications ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Specifications\n|-\n! \n!
