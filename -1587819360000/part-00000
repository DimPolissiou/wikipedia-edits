{"title_page": "Norah Lofts", "text_new": "{{short description|British writer}}\n{{refimprove|date=January 2012}}\n[[File:Norah Lofts.jpg|thumb|Norah Lofts]]\n'''Norah Lofts''', ''n\u00e9e'' '''Norah Ethel Robinson''', (27 August 1904{{spaced ndash}}10 September 1983) was a 20th-century [[best-selling]] British author. She wrote more than fifty books specialising in [[historical fiction]], but she also wrote non-fiction and short stories. Many of her novels, including her Suffolk Trilogy, follow the history of  specific houses and their residents over several generations.\n\n==Life and work== \n[[File:Bury St Edmunds - Northgate House.jpg|thumb|[[Northgate House]], Bury St Edmunds, home to Lofts from 1955 until her death in 1983]]\n\nLofts was born in [[Shipdham]], [[Norfolk]] in England, and died in 1983 in [[Bury St Edmunds]]. She also wrote under the [[pen name]]s '''Peter Curtis''' and '''Juliet Astley'''. Lofts chose to release her murder-mystery novels under the pen name Peter Curtis because she did not want the readers of her historic fiction to pick up a murder-mystery novel and expect classic Lofts historical fiction. However, the murders still show characteristic Lofts elements. Most of her historical novels fall into two general categories: [[biographical novel]]s about queens, among them [[Anne Boleyn]], [[Isabella I of Castile]], and [[Catherine of Aragon]]; and novels set in [[East Anglia]] centered around the fictitious town of Baildon (patterned largely on Bury St. Edmunds). Her creation of this fictitious area of England is reminiscent of [[Thomas Hardy]]'s creation of \"[[Thomas Hardy's Wessex|Wessex]]\"; and her use of recurring characters such that the protagonist of one novel appears as a secondary character in others is even more reminiscent of [[William Faulkner]]'s work set in \"[[Yoknapatawpha County]],\" Mississippi. Lofts' work set in East Anglia in the 1930s and 1940s shows great concern with the very poor in society and their inability to change their conditions. Her approach suggests an interest in the social reformism that became a feature of British post-war society.\n\nShe was not afraid to tackle potentially sensitive subjects; her version of the Nativity, with backstories of Mary, Joseph, the Magi, the shepherds -  even the innkeeper - is rendered in \"How Far To Bethlehem?\" as is the ill-fated Donner Party  expedition in \"Road to Revelation\" (aka \"Winter Harvest\")\n\nSeveral of her novels were turned into films. ''Jassy'' was filmed as ''[[Jassy (film)|Jassy]]'' (1947) starring [[Margaret Lockwood]] and [[Dennis Price]]. ''You're Best Alone'' was filmed as ''[[Guilt Is My Shadow]]'' (1950). ''The Devil's Own'' (also known as ''The Little Wax Doll'' and ''Catch As Catch Can'') was filmed as ''[[The Witches (1966 film)|The Witches]]'' (1966). The film ''[[7 Women]]'' (1966) was directed by John Ford and very loosely based on the story ''Chinese Finale'' by Norah Lofts.\nHer books still have a devoted international readership, notably on the [[Goodreads]] website.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/195727.Norah_Lofts | title=Norah Lofts | publisher=Goodreads | accessdate=August 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Honours==\nIn the United States, she won a [[List of National Book Award winners#1935 to 1941|National Book Award]] for ''I Met a Gypsy'', voted by members of the [[American Booksellers Association]].

It is located in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Munster]]. The county is named after the town of [[Tipperary (town)|Tipperary]], and was established in the early thirteenth century, shortly after the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]]. The population of the county was 159,553 at the 2016 census.<ref name=cso2016/> The largest towns are [[Clonmel]], [[Nenagh]] and [[Thurles]].\n\n[[Tipperary County Council]] is the [[local government in the Republic of Ireland|local government]] authority for the county. Between 1838 and 2014, County Tipperary was divided into two [[Riding (country subdivision)|ridings]]/counties, [[North Tipperary]] and [[South Tipperary]], which were unified under the [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]], which came into effect following the [[2014 Irish local elections|2014 local elections]] on 3 June 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tipperarycoco.ie/news/tipperary-county-council|title=Tipperary County Council|work=Tipperary County Council|date=29 May 2014|quote=Tipperary County Council will become an official unified authority on Tuesday, 3rd June 2014.

It is also the largest landlocked county in Ireland. The region is part of the central plain of Ireland, but the diverse terrain contains several mountain ranges: the [[Knockmealdown Mountains|Knockmealdown]], the [[Galtee Mountains|Galtee]], the [[Arra Hills]] and the [[Silvermine Mountains]]. Most of the county is drained by the [[River Suir]]; the north-western part by tributaries of the [[River Shannon]]; the eastern part by the [[River Nore]]; the south-western corner by the [[Munster Blackwater]]. No part of the county touches the coast. The centre is known as 'the [[Golden Vale]]', a rich pastoral stretch of land in the Suir basin which extends into counties [[County Limerick|Limerick]] and [[County Cork|Cork]].\n\n===Baronies===\nThere are 12 historic [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] in County Tipperary: [[Clanwilliam (County Tipperary)|Clanwilliam]], [[Eliogarty]], [[Iffa and Offa East]], [[Iffa and Offa West]], [[Ikerrin]], [[Kilnamanagh Lower]], [[Kilnamanagh Upper]],  [[Middle Third (County Tipperary barony)|Middle Third]], [[Ormond Lower]], [[Ormond Upper]], [[Owney and Arra]] and [[Slievardagh]].\n\n===Civil parishes and townlands===\n{{Main|Civil parishes in Ireland}}\nParishes were delineated after the [[Down Survey]] as an intermediate subdivision, with multiple [[townland]]s per parish and multiple parishes per barony.

The [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] is responsible for certain local [[Public services|services]] such as sanitation, planning and [[Real estate development|development]], libraries, the collection of motor taxation, local roads and [[social housing]]. The county is part of the [[South (European Parliament constituency)|South]] constituency for the purposes of European elections. For elections to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the constituency used is: [[Tipperary (D\u00e1il constituency)|Tipperary]].

It is located in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Munster]]. The county is named after the town of [[Tipperary (town)|Tipperary]], and was established in the early thirteenth century, shortly after the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]]. The population of the county was 159,553 at the 2016 census.<ref name=cso2016/> The largest towns are [[Clonmel]], [[Nenagh]] and [[Thurles]].\n\n[[Tipperary County Council]] is the [[local government in the Republic of Ireland|local government]] authority for the county. Between 1838 and 2014 county Tipperary was divided into two [[Riding (country subdivision)|ridings]]/counties, [[North Tipperary]] and [[South Tipperary]], which were unified under the [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]], which came into effect following the [[2014 Irish local elections|2014 local elections]] on 3 June 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tipperarycoco.ie/news/tipperary-county-council|title=Tipperary County Council|work=Tipperary County Council|date=29 May 2014|quote=Tipperary County Council will become an official unified authority on Tuesday, 3rd June 2014.

It is also the largest landlocked county in Ireland. The region is part of the central plain of Ireland, but the diverse terrain contains several mountain ranges: the [[Knockmealdown Mountains|Knockmealdown]], the [[Galtee Mountains|Galtee]], the [[Arra Hills]] and the [[Silvermine Mountains]]. Most of the county is drained by the [[River Suir]]; the north-western part by tributaries of the [[River Shannon]]; the eastern part by the [[River Nore]]; the south-western corner by the [[Munster Blackwater]]. No part of the county touches the coast. The centre is known as 'the [[Golden Vale]]', a rich pastoral stretch of land in the Suir basin which extends into counties [[County Limerick|Limerick]] and [[County Cork|Cork]].\n\n===Baronies===\nThere are 12 historic [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] in County Tipperary: [[Clanwilliam (County Tipperary)|Clanwilliam]], [[Eliogarty]], [[Iffa and Offa East]], [[Iffa and Offa West]], [[Ikerrin]], [[Kilnamanagh Lower]], [[Kilnamanagh Upper]],  [[Middle Third (County Tipperary barony)|Middle Third]], [[Ormond Lower]], [[Ormond Upper]], [[Owney and Arra]] and [[Slievardagh]].\n\n===Civil parishes and townlands===\n{{Main|Civil parishes in Ireland}}\nParishes were delineated after the [[Down Survey]] as an intermediate subdivision, with multiple [[townland]]s per parish and multiple parishes per barony.

Following the time trial on the penultimate day, he publicly stated in an interview with French cycling magazine ''Miroir du Cyclisme'': \"I'll stir things up to help Greg win, and I'll have fun doing it. That's a promise.\"{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=168}} On the victory podium in Paris, he leaned over to LeMond, telling him: \"Next year, it's you\", repeating the pledge again during the celebration dinner of {{ct|LVC|1985|nolink=yes}} that same evening.{{sfn|de Vis\u00e9|2019|pp=128\u2013129}} Public opinion saw Hinault and LeMond as good friends. The sports newspaper ''[[L'Equipe]]'' ran a cartoon on the day of the final stage, showing Hinault on a bicycle and LeMond next to him on a child's scooter, with Hinault saying \"Because you've been so good, I'll take you along next year on my handlebars\", to which LeMond replied: \"Thanks, Uncle Bernard.\"{{sfn|Abt|1990|p=96}} His first Tour victory the following year did not come to LeMond as easily as these pledges and jokes indicated. Hinault attacked several times during the [[1986 Tour de France]], only conceding defeat after the last time trial.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=162\u2013170}} LeMond was frustrated with the apparent unwillingness by Hinault to honour the deal, saying: \"He made promises to me he never intended to keep. He made them just to relieve the pressure on himself.\"{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=186}} The rivalry between Hinault and LeMond in both the 1985 and 1986 Tours was subject of the documentary ''Slaying the Badger'', part of [[ESPN]]'s series ''[[30 for 30]]''. Based on the book by the same name by journalist [[Richard Moore (journalist)|Richard Moore]], it premiered on 22 July 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=slayingthebadger|title=Slaying the Badger \u2013 ESPN Films: 30 for 30|publisher=[[ESPN]]|access-date=24 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715191744/http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=slayingthebadger|archive-date=15 July 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn previous years, cyclists tied their shoes to their pedals with toe-clips, allowing them to not only push the pedals down but also pull them up. In 1985, Hinault had used [[Bicycle pedal#Clipless pedals|clip-ins (clipless pedals)]], which allowed the shoes to snap into the pedal. His victory in this Tour made these clip-ins popular.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZdXCmwpk-SAC&pg=PA157|page=157|title=Historical Dictionary of Cycling|first1=Jeroen|last1=Heijmans|last2=Mallon|first2=Bill|year=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7175-5|series=Historical dictionaries of sports}}</ref>\n\nThere was some criticism that the time trials were too important.

Following the time trial on the penultimate day, he publicly stated in an interview with French cycling magazine ''Miroir du Cyclisme'': \"I'll stir things up to help Greg win, and I'll have fun doing it. That's a promise.\"{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=168}} On the victory podium in Paris, he leaned over to LeMond, telling him: \"Next year, it's you\", repeating the pledge again during the celebration dinner of {{ct|LVC|1985|nolink=yes}} that same evening.{{sfn|de Vis\u00e9|2019|pp=128\u2013129}} Public opinion saw Hinault and LeMond as good friends. The sports newspaper ''[[L'Equipe]]'' ran a cartoon on the day of the final stage, showing Hinault on a bicycle and LeMond next to him on a child's scooter, with Hinault saying \"Because you've been so good, I'll take you along next year on my handlebars\", to which LeMond replied: \"Thanks, Uncle Bernard.\"{{sfn|Abt|1990|p=96}} His first Tour victory the following year did not come to LeMond as easily as these pledges and jokes indicated. Hinault attacked several times during the [[1986 Tour de France]], only conceding defeat after the last time trial.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=162\u2013170}} LeMond was frustrated with the apparent unwillingness by Hinault to honour the deal, saying: \"He made promises to me he never intended to keep. He made them just to relieve the pressure on himself.\"{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=186}} The rivalry between Hinault and LeMond in both the 1985 and 1986 Tours was subject of the documentary ''Slaying the Badger'', part of [[ESPN]]'s series ''[[30 for 30]]''. Based on the book by the same name by journalist [[Richard Moore (journalist)|Richard Moore]], it premiered on 22 July 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=slayingthebadger|title=Slaying the Badger \u2013 ESPN Films: 30 for 30|publisher=[[ESPN]]|access-date=24 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715191744/http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=slayingthebadger|archive-date=15 July 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn previous years, cyclists tied their shoes to their pedals with toe-clips, allowing them to not only push the pedals down but also pull them up. In 1985, Hinault had used [[Bicycle pedal#Clipless pedals|clip-ins (clipless pedals)]], which allowed the shoes to snap into the pedal.

the [[China Agricultural University Gymnasium]].\n\nThis [[freestyle wrestling]] competition consisted of a single-elimination tournament, with a [[repechage]] used to determine the winner of two bronze medals. The two finalists faced off for gold and silver medals. Each wrestler who lost to one of the two finalists moved into the repechage, culminating in a pair of bronze medal matches featuring the semifinal losers each facing the remaining repechage opponent from their half of the bracket.\n\nEach bout consisted of up to three rounds, lasting two minutes apiece. The wrestler who scored more points in each round was the winner of that rounds; the bout finished when one wrestler had won two rounds (and thus the match).\n\n==Schedule==\n<small>All times are

The film takes the Harper family on a 23-year journey.\n\nEunice appeared occasionally on \"The Family\" skit's [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] sitcom ''[[Mama's Family]]''. As portrayed by Carol Burnett, Eunice was in five episodes of ''Mama's Family'', all of which were in the [[Mama's Family#First life of the sitcom (seasons 1, 2)|first life of Mama's Family]] on [[NBC]]. Four of Burnett's five appearances were in season 1. The fifth episode of season 2 (\"Rashomama\"), which aired on November 3, 1983, was Burnett's final portrayal of Eunice.

She declined to explain her reasons to Bubba, hanging up when Mama threatened to put him on the phone.\n\nAlways clad in a tattered green dress and wearing her hair in a 1940s-era perm, Eunice is a working-class homemaker married to Ed Higgins. Eunice had a stormy, irrepressible, browbeating persona, always going melodramatically out of control, ranting and raving.

Her mother is [[Thelma Harper]], whom she sometimes refers to as \"Old Lady.\" Eunice eloped with a hardware store owner named [[Ed Higgins]] after he impregnated her. Eunice and Ed had two sons, Bubba (who later moved in with Thelma during the run of ''Mama's Family'') and Billy Joe. Her older sister is [[Ellen Harper]] and she has at least one brother, depending on the installment (Vinton Harper in ''Mama's Family''; Larry, Phillip, and Jack in the original sketches.)\n\nEunice had a strained relationship with her parents growing up, as they blatantly favored her sister Ellen. She was bitter towards her father, who called her his \"Prune Tart\", while calling Ellen \"Apple Dumpling\".\n\n==Relationships==\n{{all plot|section|date=July 2018}}\nEven in adulthood, Eunice's mother blatantly favors her rich  sister Ellen, though Eunice visits her mother much more often and takes care of her more. This leads to a bitter, cold dynamic between the two sisters, Eunice regarding Ellen as a selfish snob,  and Ellen seeing Eunice as obnoxious, embarrassing and crazy.\n\nEunice and her mother, Thelma Harper have a very dysfunctional relationship. Eunice often tries to please her mother, but she is never satisfied, and nags Eunice to the point where she becomes irate and so agitated she goes into screaming fits. Mama often also guilts Eunice, putting her more on edge. This leads to Eunice snapping back at her mother, calling her \"old lady\", and hysterically ranting.\n\nEunice is unhappy with her marriage. She views her husband, Ed, as a dolt and has called him a dumb cluck or a goon numerous times. He eventually leaves her.\n\nEunice is generally very unhappy and bitter, distraught and broken down by her mother, and very emotionally unstable and going on many destructive hissy fits. She eventually visits a psychiatrist, where Eunice reveals she is worried about her fits, and is not happy about herself. The psychiatrist eventually helps her realize she does not have to let her abusive mother affect her, and leads her on the road to recovery.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{The Carol Burnett Show}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Higgins, Eunice Harper}}\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1974]]\n[[Category:Mama's Family characters]]\n[[Category:Carol Burnett]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=December 2009}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name = Eunice Higgins\n| image = Carol Burnett Madeline Kahn Eunice Carol Burnett Show.JPG\n| caption = Carol Burnett (left) as Eunice Higgins \n| first = ''Family'' sketch episode \"Phillip's Visit\" \n| last = ''Mama's Family'' episode \"Rashomama\" (last seen played by Carol Burnett) <br> ''Mama's Family'' episode \"Sins of the Mother\" (last seen in general) <br> ''Mama's Family'' episode \"Pomp and Circumstance\" (last heard, portrayed in voice only)\n| nickname = Eunie (by [[Ed Higgins|Ed]])\n| occupation = [[Homemaker]] <br> [[Mother]]\n| title = Mrs. Higgins\n| family = Carl Harper (father; deceased) <br> [[Thelma Harper]] (mother) <br> [[Ellen Jackson]] (sister) <br> [[Vinton Harper]] (brother)\n| spouse = [[Ed Higgins]]\n| children = [[Bubba Higgins]] (son) <br> Billy Joe Higgins (son; mentioned in ''Mama\u2019s Family'' sketches)\n| relatives = [[Fran Crowley]] (aunt; deceased)<br> [[Buzz Harper]] (nephew)<br> [[Sonja Harper]] (niece)<br> Tiffany Thelma Harper (niece)<br> Mary Beth Jackson (niece)\n| portrayer = [[Carol Burnett]]<br />Tanya Fenmore as a child version of Eunice (''Mama's Family'' episode \"Mama's Birthday\")<br />Heather Kerr as a teenage version of Eunice (''Mama's Family'' episode \"Sins of the Mother\")<br />Phyllis Franklin in a voice-only portrayal (''Mama's Family'' episode \"Pomp and Circumstance\") \n| creator = Dick Clair\n}}\n'''Eunice Higgins''' ([[n\u00e9e]] '''Harper''') is the [[main character]] in the comedy sketch \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" played by [[Carol Burnett]] and featured on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' (1974\u201378) and ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'' (1979).

Her mother is [[Thelma Harper]], whom she sometimes refers to as \"Old Lady.\" Eunice eloped with a hardware store owner named [[Ed Higgins]] after he impregnated her. Eunice and Ed had two sons, Bubba (who later moved in with Thelma during the run of ''Mama's Family'') and Billy Joe. Her older sister is [[Ellen Harper]] and she has at least one brother, depending on the installment (Vinton Harper in ''Mama's Family''; Larry, Phillip, and Jack in the original sketches.)\n\nEunice had a strained relationship with her parents growing up, as they blatantly favored her sister Ellen. She was bitter towards her father, who called her his \"Prune Tart\", while calling Ellen \"Apple Dumpling\".\n\n==Relationships==\n{{all plot|section|date=July 2018}}\nEven in adulthood, Eunice's mother blatantly favors her rich  sister Ellen, though Eunice visits her mother much more often and takes care of her more. This leads to a bitter, cold dynamic between the two sisters, Eunice regarding Ellen as a selfish snob,  and Ellen seeing Eunice as obnoxious, embarrassing and crazy.\n\nEunice and her mother, Thelma Harper have a very dysfunctional relationship. Eunice often tries to please her mother, but she is never satisfied, and nags Eunice to the point where she becomes irate and so agitated she goes into screaming fits. Mama often also guilts Eunice, putting her more on edge. This leads to Eunice snapping back at her mother, calling her \"old lady\", and hysterically ranting.\n\nEunice is unhappy with her marriage. She views her husband, Ed, as a dolt and has called him a dumb cluck or a goon numerous times. He eventually leaves her.\n\nEunice is generally very unhappy and bitter, distraught and broken down by her mother, and very emotionally unstable and going on many destructive hissy fits. She eventually visits a psychiatrist, where Eunice reveals she is worried about her fits, and is not happy about herself. The psychiatrist eventually helps her realize she does not have to let her abusive mother affect her, and leads her on the road to recovery.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{The Carol Burnett Show}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Higgins, Eunice Harper}}\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1974]]\n[[Category:Mama's Family characters]]\n[[Category:Carol Burnett]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunice_Harper_Higgins"}

In 1890, they founded in [[Munich]] the ''M\u00fcnchner Volkskunsthaus'' (\"Munich house of folk art\"). \nTheir seamstresses industriously produced the first elegant tracht dresses from colourful printed fabrics, predominantly silk. These were first exhibited by models from the firm at summer holiday resorts in the Alps. The breakthrough came in 1910, when the Wallach brothers organized and paid for the traditional costume parade for the 100th anniversary celebrations of the [[Oktoberfest]]. <ref name=\"staendecke\"> St\u00e4ndecke, Monika. 2007.

In 1890, they founded in [[Munich]] the ''M\u00fcnchner Volkskunsthaus'' (\"Munich house of folk art\"). \nTheir seamstresses industriously produced the first elegant tracht dresses from colourful printed fabrics, predominantly silk. These were first exhibited by models from the firm at summer holiday resorts in the Alps. The breakthrough came in 1910, when the Wallach brothers organized and paid for the traditional costume parade for the 100th anniversary celebrations of the [[Oktoberfest]]. <ref name=\"staendecke\"> St\u00e4ndecke, Monika. 2007.
