He regards himself as the leader of the group. Not only can he transform into a bat, he has also become a dog to save Laszlo from an animal shelter. He is also a [[USA Basketball]] fan since 1992 and even wanted to become an American citizen solely to compete in the Olympics for America before the [[Macarena (song)|Macarena]] swept the country and took up all his time. He was also the king of a country called Al Quolanudar which is in Southern Iran where he was born. Al Quolanudar dissolved in 1401 when Nandor was just 139 years old.\n* [[Matt Berry]] as Laszlo Cravensworth, an [[English nobility|English nobleman]] vampire who was turned by Nadja and is now married to her. He frequently disagrees with Nandor's leadership and enjoys making music and [[Topiary|topiary sculptures]], especially of [[vulva]]s. He is able to transform himself into a bat, but must shout \"Bat!\" whenever doing so and can communicate with animals. Laszlo reveals to the other vampires in one episode that he was [[Jack the Ripper]]. He is revealed to be bisexual and has an extensive filmography of pornographic movies in which he plays vampire characters.\n* [[Natasia Demetriou]] as Nadja, a [[Romani people|Romani]] vampire, married to Laszlo. However, she is secretly seeing a human man named Jeff Suckler who is the reincarnation of her former human lover, Gregor, whom she accidentally decapitated in a previous incarnation. She has a unique ability to transform into a swarm of rats.\n* [[Harvey Guill\u00e9n]] as Guillermo, Nandor's \"patient\" [[Familiar spirit |familiar]]. He has served his master for 10 years in order to become a vampire like the fictional vampire [[Armand (The Vampire Chronicles)|Armand]], played by [[Antonio Banderas]], who first inspired him. Nandor shows small acts of kindness for Guillermo, such as making a glitter portrait for him, and taking him flying, but otherwise excludes him, belittles him, and endlessly procrastinates about making Guillermo a vampire. He is mostly Mexican-American but 2% Dutch; so far unknown to the others, he is a descendant of [[Van Helsing]], the infamous vampire hunter.\n* [[Mark Proksch]] as Colin Robinson, an [[Psychic vampire|energy vampire]] who lives with the trio. Unlike regular vampires he shows no outward sign of vampirism, except that his pupils sometimes glow and his reflection shows a pale version of himself. He drains humans (and vampires) of their energy by boring or enraging them. He is also a Daywalker, which makes him free to roam day and night (making normal vampires envious). The others are continually annoyed by him, and often try to avoid associating with him, but they let him stay because his office job pays for their considerable rent.<ref name=\"PremiereTrailer\">{{cite web |last1=Petski |first1=Denise |title='What We Do in the Shadows': FX Vampire Comedy Series Unveils Trailer, Sets Premiere Date -TCA |url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-trailer-premiere-date-fx-vampire-comedy-series-tca-1202549095/ |website=Deadline Hollywood |accessdate=February 4, 2019 |date=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] as Baron Afanas, an ancient vampire from the Old Country who believes vampires should rule the world. He is also bisexual. Both Nadja and Laszlo had secret [[affair]]s with The Baron. Laszlo mentions that Afanas used to be a fun person but recently he has only come up with old fashioned ideas. A drunk Afanas mentions that he is not actually a baron, rather \"Baron\" is a nickname and it is actually spelled Barren. While drunk he says that he does not want to be who he has recently become. After a night of partying with the Staten Island vampires (while also becoming high by drinking blood from humans who were on drugs), the Baron was burned and destroyed by sunlight when Guillermo opened the front door unaware the Baron was there.\n* [[Beanie Feldstein]] as Jenna, a [[Live action role-playing game|LARPer]] and virgin whom Guillermo lured for the vampires to feast on. She was later transformed by Nadja into a vampire when she witnesses Jenna being treated poorly by her group and sympathized with her from her own struggles in her human life. During her vampire training with Nadja, she is revealed to have the unique ability to turn invisible, which fits the tendency of people to ignore her.\n* [[Jake McDorman]] as Jeff Suckler, a [[reincarnation]] of Nadja's former human lover, Gregor, a Knight who has been killed by decapitation in each of his lives. Nadja visited him in secret and eventually restored Jeff's memories of his previous lives so that he can be more like his former self, leading to him falling into insanity and being committed to a mental institution. It is later revealed to Nadja and Gregor that Laszlo had always known about Gregor and most of his subsequent reincarnations. Laszlo had been causing his deaths because Nadja would become sad whenever Gregor was reborn, a gesture that she finds touching. Nadja convinces Laszlo to let Jeff go and to allow him to live a single full life, only for him to be accidentally decapitated by a wire that Laszlo had been using to hold up one of his topiary structures.\n* [[Anthony Atamanuik]] as Sean, the human next door neighbor. He frequently witnesses Laszlo doing wildly inappropriate and illegal things, but is easily hypnotized into forgetting everything. The vampires only spare him because he brings their trash cans in when they forget.\n* Veronika Slowikowska as Shanice, Jenna's college roommate who is aware of her being a vampire, and later joins the Mosquito Collectors of the Tri-State Area, a secret team of amateur vampire hunters.\n\n===Guests===\n* Mary Gillis as June, Nadja and Laszlo's Familiar. She appears to be an ill old woman that communicates through grunts. She eventually meets her end when the Baron sucks all her blood when he arrives on Staten Island.\n* [[Hayden Szeto]] as Jonathan, a LARPer college student that Guillermo lured for the vampires to feast on. However, Colin beat them to it by draining his energy, making the blood totally without nourishment.\n* Gloria Laino as The Baron's Familiar. She is keeping a watchful eye on the vampires of Staten Island as her master awakes. Guillermo says that she pops out of nowhere and hears \"everything\". Despite staying silent most of the time she is perfectly capable of speaking.\n* [[Marceline Hugot]] as Barbara Lazarro, the madam president of the Staten Island Council. She was going to be the vampires' way of taking over Staten Island until Laszlo left a pile of dead raccoons on her doorstep in an attempt to win her trust, resulting in her believing it was a form of terrorist threat.\n* Richie Moriarty as Doug Peterson, a Junior Councilman of the Staten Island Council. Nandor hypnotizes him to use as his \"Agent of Chaos\", in order to take over the council. But the scheme fails when Peterson goes mad, screaming and ranting in the council chambers, only to be arrested and dragged out of the council by security.\n* [[Vanessa Bayer]] as Evie Russell, Colin's co-worker. She is an advanced form of Energy Vampire \u2014 an Emotional Vampire \u2014 who feeds off of the pity generated from her outlandish stories of suffering rather than simply frustrating people for energy to drain like Colin. She and Colin date for a short time until he begins to feel the relationship is unhealthy. Her first name is a [[homophone]] of \"E.V.\"\n* [[Arj Barker]] as Arjan, the pack leader of the [[Werewolf|Staten Island Werewolf Support Group]]. He entered into the truce between his kind and the vampires (which was created in 1993).\n* Hannan Younis as Ange, an African American werewolf and part of Arjan's group. She undermines Arjan's rules (like Laszlo does to Nandor) and is openly hostile towards Nadja due to Nadja's insulting the werewolves by [[racism|assuming]] they are all [[Jacob Black|Native Americans]] (or how she puts it, \"Indians.\")\n* [[1491s|Bobby Wilson]] as Marcus, the actual [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] member of the Werewolf Pack. He is Native American, and a werewolf but, as he explains, \"Not a werewolf ''because''\" he's Native American. \"It's not an ''ethnic'' thing.\"\n* Ro Manning as Dougie, the [[Black Canadians|Caribbean-Canadian]] member of Werewolf Pack. He is proud to be from [[Saskatoon]]. \n* Justin Bigelli as Toby, the new, gigantic member of the Werewolf Pack. Unlike his brethren, he can actually transform at any phase of the moon, simply by picturing the full moon in his mind, allowing him to transform at will (only if it's nighttime).\n* [[Nick Kroll]] as Simon the Devious, a vampire who rules over the Manhattan Vampires and owns the Sassy Cat nightclub. He was a close friend to the Staten Island trio when all the vampires first arrived in America. When the Staten Island Vampires propose an alliance to conquer America, he reveals that his invitation was just a ruse to get Laszlo's fancy hat (which is cursed because it's made from witch skin). The trio are kicked out of the club, but the cursed Hat causes Simon's flaming arrow to backfire, and his club goes up in a fiery explosion. Simon winds up in a full-body cast in the hospital, and Laszlo sneaks in and retrieves his cursed hat.\n* [[Jeremy O. Harris]] as Colby, a human familiar to Dantos the Cruel and Radinka the Brutal, two 400 year old vampires who appear to be children while Colby portrays as their father.\n* [[Kristen Schaal]] as The Guide (also known as the \"Floating Woman\"), an envoy of the Vampiric Council who likes to float and sometimes speak in a demonic voice.\n* [[Dave Bautista]] and Alexandra Henrikson as Garrett and Vasillika the Defiler, vampires imprisoned by the Council after Garrett was framed by Laszlo for turning a baby into a vampire (which is very illegal), and Vasillika for too much defiling.\n* [[Taika Waititi]], [[Jonathan Brugh]], and [[Jemaine Clement]] reprise their roles as Viago, Deacon, and Vladislav from the original film. Three vampires arrived from New Zealand to participate in the Vampiric Council.{{efn|name=Council|Indeed every known member of the Vampiric Council has played an on-screen vampire before.<br />\nMentioned only: [[Robert Pattinson]] as [[Edward Cullen]] in ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|The Twilight Saga]]'' (2008\u20132012), [[Kiefer Sutherland]] in ''[[The Lost Boys]]'' (1987), [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Lestat de Lioncourt]] and [[Louis de Pointe du Lac]] in ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'' (1994).<br />\nIt is reported that Waititi denied [[Cate Blanchett]] council membership due to insufficient on-screen vampiric experience.<ref>{{cite interview| subject=Jemaine Clement| subject-link=Jemaine Clement| subject2=Taika Waititi| subject-link2=Taika Waititi| subject3=Paul Simms| subject-link3=Paul Simms| interviewer=Clark Collis| title=What We Do in the Shadows producers discuss all-star episode| url=https://ew.com/tv/2019/05/09/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-season-1-episode-7/| work=[[EW.com]]| publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| date=2019-05-09| access-date=2019-06-10| quote=}}</ref>}}\n*[[Tilda Swinton]] as Tilda, the leader of the Vampiric Council.{{efn|name=Tilda|[[Tilda Swinton]] played a vampire lover in ''[[Only Lovers Left Alive]]'' (2013).}}\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Evan the Immortal Princess of the Undead, a member of the Council who just goes by her first name.{{efn|name=Evan|[[Evan Rachel Wood]] played [[List of True Blood characters#Supporting vampire characters|Sophie-Anne Leclerq]], the Vampire Queen of Louisiana, in ''[[True Blood]]'' Seasons 2\u20134 (2009\u20132011).}}\n* [[Danny Trejo]] as Danny, a Hispanic tattooed member of the Council.

He regards himself as the leader of the group. Not only can he transform into a bat, he has also become a dog to save Laszlo from an animal shelter. He is also a [[USA Basketball]] fan since 1992 and even wanted to become an American citizen solely to compete in the Olympics for America before the [[Macarena (song)|Macarena]] swept the country and took up all his time. He was also the king of a country called Al Quolanudar which is in Southern Iran where he was born. Al Quolanudar dissolved in 1401 when Nandor was just 139 years old.\n* [[Matt Berry]] as Laszlo Cravensworth, an [[English nobility|English nobleman]] vampire who was turned by Nadja and is now married to her. He frequently disagrees with Nandor's leadership and enjoys making music and [[Topiary|topiary sculptures]], especially of [[vulva]]s. He is able to transform himself into a bat, but must shout \"Bat!\" whenever doing so and can communicate with animals. Laszlo reveals to the other vampires in one episode that he was [[Jack the Ripper]]. He is revealed to be bisexual and has an extensive filmography of pornographic movies in which he plays vampire characters.\n* [[Natasia Demetriou]] as Nadja, a [[Romani people|Romani]] vampire, married to Laszlo. However, she is secretly seeing a human man named Jeff Suckler who is the reincarnation of her former human lover, Gregor, whom she accidentally decapitated in a previous incarnation. She has a unique ability to transform into a swarm of rats.\n* [[Harvey Guill\u00e9n]] as Guillermo, Nandor's \"patient\" [[Familiar spirit |familiar]]. He has served his master for 10 years in order to become a vampire like the fictional vampire [[Armand (The Vampire Chronicles)|Armand]], played by [[Antonio Banderas]], who first inspired him. Nandor shows small acts of kindness for Guillermo, such as making a glitter portrait for him, and taking him flying, but otherwise excludes him, belittles him, and endlessly procrastinates about making Guillermo a vampire. He is mostly Mexican-American but 2% Dutch; so far unknown to the others, he is a descendant of [[Van Helsing]], the infamous vampire hunter.\n* [[Mark Proksch]] as Colin Robinson, an [[Psychic vampire|energy vampire]] who lives with the trio. Unlike regular vampires he shows no outward sign of vampirism, except that his pupils sometimes glow and his reflection shows a pale version of himself. He drains humans (and vampires) of their energy by boring or enraging them. He is also a Daywalker, which makes him free to roam day and night (making normal vampires envious). The others are continually annoyed by him, and often try to avoid associating with him, but they let him stay because his office job pays for their considerable rent.<ref name=\"PremiereTrailer\">{{cite web |last1=Petski |first1=Denise |title='What We Do in the Shadows': FX Vampire Comedy Series Unveils Trailer, Sets Premiere Date -TCA |url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-trailer-premiere-date-fx-vampire-comedy-series-tca-1202549095/ |website=Deadline Hollywood |accessdate=February 4, 2019 |date=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] as Baron Afanas, an ancient vampire from the Old Country who believes vampires should rule the world. He is also bisexual. Both Nadja and Laszlo had secret [[affair]]s with The Baron. Laszlo mentions that Afanas used to be a fun person but recently he has only come up with old fashioned ideas. A drunk Afanas mentions that he is not actually a baron, rather \"Baron\" is a nickname and it is actually spelled Barren. While drunk he says that he does not want to be who he has recently become. After a night of partying with the Staten Island vampires (while also becoming high by drinking blood from humans who were on drugs), the Baron was burned and destroyed by sunlight when Guillermo opened the front door unaware the Baron was there.\n* [[Beanie Feldstein]] as Jenna, a [[Live action role-playing game|LARPer]] and virgin whom Guillermo lured for the vampires to feast on. She was later transformed by Nadja into a vampire when she witnesses Jenna being treated poorly by her group and sympathized with her from her own struggles in her human life. During her vampire training with Nadja, she is revealed to have the unique ability to turn invisible, which fits the tendency of people to ignore her.\n* [[Jake McDorman]] as Jeff Suckler, a [[reincarnation]] of Nadja's former human lover, Gregor, a Knight who has been killed by decapitation in each of his lives. Nadja visited him in secret and eventually restored Jeff's memories of his previous lives so that he can be more like his former self, leading to him falling into insanity and being committed to a mental institution. It is later revealed to Nadja and Gregor that Laszlo had always known about Gregor and most of his subsequent reincarnations. Laszlo had been causing his deaths because Nadja would become sad whenever Gregor was reborn, a gesture that she finds touching. Nadja convinces Laszlo to let Jeff go and to allow him to live a single full life, only for him to be accidentally decapitated by a wire that Laszlo had been using to hold up one of his topiary structures.\n* [[Anthony Atamanuik]] as Sean, the human next door neighbor. He frequently witnesses Laszlo doing wildly inappropriate and illegal things, but is easily hypnotized into forgetting everything. The vampires only spare him because he brings their trash cans in when they forget.\n* Veronika Slowikowska as Shanice, Jenna's college roommate who is aware of her being a vampire, and later joins the Mosquito Collectors of the Tri-State Area, a secret team of amateur vampire hunters.\n\n===Guests===\n* Mary Gillis as June, Nadja and Laszlo's Familiar. She appears to be an ill old woman that communicates through grunts. She eventually meets her end when the Baron sucks all her blood when he arrives on Staten Island.\n* [[Hayden Szeto]] as Jonathan, a LARPer college student that Guillermo lured for the vampires to feast on. However, Colin beat them to it by draining his energy, making the blood totally without nourishment.\n* Gloria Laino as The Baron's Familiar. She is keeping a watchful eye on the vampires of Staten Island as her master awakes. Guillermo says that she pops out of nowhere and hears \"everything\". Despite staying silent most of the time she is perfectly capable of speaking.\n* [[Marceline Hugot]] as Barbara Lazarro, the madam president of the Staten Island Council. She was going to be the vampires' way of taking over Staten Island until Laszlo left a pile of dead raccoons on her doorstep in an attempt to win her trust, resulting in her believing it was a form of terrorist threat.\n* Richie Moriarty as Doug Peterson, a Junior Councilman of the Staten Island Council. Nandor hypnotizes him to use as his \"Agent of Chaos\", in order to take over the council. But the scheme fails when Peterson goes mad, screaming and ranting in the council chambers, only to be arrested and dragged out of the council by security.\n* [[Vanessa Bayer]] as Evie Russell, Colin's co-worker. She is an advanced form of Energy Vampire \u2014 an Emotional Vampire \u2014 who feeds off of the pity generated from her outlandish stories of suffering rather than simply frustrating people for energy to drain like Colin. She and Colin date for a short time until he begins to feel the relationship is unhealthy. Her first name is a [[homophone]] of \"E.V.\"\n* [[Arj Barker]] as Arjan, the pack leader of the [[Werewolf|Staten Island Werewolf Support Group]]. He entered into the truce between his kind and the vampires (which was created in 1993).\n* Hannan Younis as Ange, an African American werewolf and part of Arjan's group. She undermines Arjan's rules (like Laszlo does to Nandor) and is openly hostile towards Nadja due to Nadja's insulting the werewolves by [[racism|assuming]] they are all [[Jacob Black|Native Americans]] (or how she puts it, \"Indians.\")\n* [[1491s|Bobby Wilson]] as Marcus, the actual [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] member of the Werewolf Pack. He is Native American, and a werewolf but, as he explains, \"Not a werewolf ''because''\" he's Native American. \"It's not an ''ethnic'' thing.\"\n* Ro Manning as Dougie, the [[Black Canadians|Caribbean-Canadian]] member of Werewolf Pack. He is proud to be from [[Saskatoon]]. \n* Justin Bigelli as Toby, the new, gigantic member of the Werewolf Pack. Unlike his brethren, he can actually transform at any phase of the moon, simply by picturing the full moon in his mind, allowing him to transform at will (only if it's nighttime).\n* [[Nick Kroll]] as Simon the Devious, a vampire who rules over the Manhattan Vampires and owns the Sassy Cat nightclub. He was a close friend to the Staten Island trio when all the vampires first arrived in America. When the Staten Island Vampires propose an alliance to conquer America, he reveals that his invitation was just a ruse to get Laszlo's fancy hat (which is cursed because it's made from witch skin). The trio are kicked out of the club, but the cursed Hat causes Simon's flaming arrow to backfire, and his club goes up in a fiery explosion. Simon winds up in a full-body cast in the hospital, and Laszlo sneaks in and retrieves his cursed hat.\n* [[Jeremy O. Harris]] as Colby, a human familiar to Dantos the Cruel and Radinka the Brutal, two 400 year old vampires who appear to be children while Colby portrays as their father.\n* [[Kristen Schaal]] as The Guide (also known as the \"Floating Woman\"), an envoy of the Vampiric Council who likes to float and sometimes speak in a demonic voice.\n* [[Dave Bautista]] and Alexandra Henrikson as Garrett and Vasillika the Defiler, vampires imprisoned by the Council after Garrett was framed by Laszlo for turning a baby into a vampire (which is very illegal), and Vasillika for too much defiling.\n* [[Taika Waititi]], [[Jonathan Brugh]], and [[Jemaine Clement]] reprise their roles as Viago, Deacon, and Vladislav from the original film. Three vampires arrived from New Zealand to participate in the Vampiric Council.{{efn|name=Council|Indeed every known member of the Vampiric Council has played an on-screen vampire before.<br />\nMentioned only: [[Robert Pattinson]] as [[Edward Cullen]] in ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|The Twilight Saga]]'' (2008\u20132012), [[Kiefer Sutherland]] in ''[[The Lost Boys]]'' (1987), [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Lestat de Lioncourt]] and [[Louis de Pointe du Lac]] in ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'' (1994).<br />\nIt is reported that Waititi denied [[Cate Blanchett]] council membership due to insufficient on-screen vampiric experience.<ref>{{cite interview| subject=Jemaine Clement| subject-link=Jemaine Clement| subject2=Taika Waititi| subject-link2=Taika Waititi| subject3=Paul Simms| subject-link3=Paul Simms| interviewer=Clark Collis| title=What We Do in the Shadows producers discuss all-star episode| url=https://ew.com/tv/2019/05/09/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-season-1-episode-7/| work=[[EW.com]]| publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| date=2019-05-09| access-date=2019-06-10| quote=}}</ref>}}\n*[[Tilda Swinton]] as Tilda, the leader of the Vampiric Council.{{efn|name=Tilda|[[Tilda Swinton]] played a vampire lover in ''[[Only Lovers Left Alive]]'' (2013).}}\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Evan the Immortal Princess of the Undead, a member of the Council who just goes by her first name.{{efn|name=Evan|[[Evan Rachel Wood]] played [[List of True Blood characters#Supporting vampire characters|Sophie-Anne Leclerq]], the Vampire Queen of Louisiana, in ''[[True Blood]]'' Seasons 2\u20134 (2009\u20132011).}}\n* [[Danny Trejo]] as Danny, a Hispanic tattooed member of the Council.

One of my favorite supernatural moments is completely in camera. It's where [[Beanie Feldstein]]'s character is walking along in the park and Nadja appears walking next to her. That was all just done completely the old fashioned way where Natasia was hiding behind a tree and the camera was tracking a long and at the right moment, she walked out from behind a tree.

(Many years later, in 1953, Barton built a replica of its original Durham Churchill vehicle, using a Daimler chassis dating from 1911.)\n\nBarton had already had experience of operating a motorised bus, in [[Mablethorpe]], some nine years earlier.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the fleet was used to transport workers to and from the [[National Shell Filling Factory, Chilwell]]. Also during the War, Barton pioneered the use of town gas as fuel, converting the whole fleet to run on it. The gas was stored in a large \"bag\" on the roof of the bus, and the company also manufactured these bags for sale to other operators.\n\nThe 1920s saw fierce competition in the British bus industry. Barton imported [[Lancia]] chassis from Italy, which were lengthened and fitted with a patented tag-[[axle]] by Barton.<ref name=AAlan>{{cite book|last=Townsin|first=Alan A|title=Duple 70 years of Coachbuilding|publisher=Venture Publications|location=Glossop|year=1999|pages=10, 54 & 76 }}</ref> The vehicles were known as \"Bartons Gliders\" and their speed and smooth riding provided a competitive advantage.\n\nBarton scored a first by operating the first diesel-engined passenger-carrying road vehicle, a [[Lancia]], in 1930. Barton had earlier been an engineer at Hornsbys where he had worked on the early development of \"oil engines\" (he always refused to use the term \"diesel\"). [[Leyland Bus|Leylands]] were purchased from the mid-1930s and made up a large part of the fleet by the beginning of [[World War II]]. Starting in 1939, a fleet of [[Leyland Titan (front engined double-decker)|Leyland Titan]] TD5, TD7 and rebodied TD1 double-deckers with stylish, front-entrance, [[lowbridge]] bodywork by [[Duple Coachbuilders|Duple]] and Willowbrook was purchased, which appeared very modern by the standards of the day.<ref name=AAlan/>\n\n===Postwar===\nAlthough Barton gained a reputation for having a varied fleet of vehicles during the 1950s and 1960s, from 1946-9 the vast majority of new chassis were from Leyland, and virtually all coachwork was from Duple. The Duple A type coach was chosen for [[Leyland Tiger (front-engined)|PS1]] Single deckers, some featuring a more compact front-design allowing up to 39 seats in the then maximum overall length of 27&nbsp;ft 6in. The 40 postwar double deckers on [[Leyland Titan (front engined double-decker)|PD1 or PD1A]] had an updated version of the forward entrance lowbridge body with more brightwork and power-operation for the entry door.<ref name=AAlan/>  Barton was a prolific rebuilder of buses &mdash; between 1950 and 1955, fifty-eight BTS1 \"Viewmaster\" single-deck coaches were rebuilt from Leyland Titan, Tiger, and Lion chassis; between 1959 and 1961, seven BTD2 full-fronted double-deckers were created from the chassis of a Leyland Tiger and six Titans; and between 1969 and 1971, eleven AEC Reliance chassis were rebuilt as Barton BTS2 and fitted with new Plaxton Panorama Elite bodywork.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.buslistsontheweb.co.uk/list.asp?listname=1158&Type=Chassis|title=Barton &mdash; Rebuilds|website=Bus Lists On The Web|access-date=19 June 2015}}</ref>\n[[File:Barton Dennis Loline II.jpg|thumb|Barton's unique Dennis Loline, 1984]]\nMany new and secondhand buses also joined the fleet, and Barton kept up its modern double-deck image with [[Northern Counties Motor & Engineering Company|Northern Counties]] bodied [[Associated Equipment Company|AEC]] Regents, which had wrap-around windscreens on both decks. Also built to the same style was a unique vehicle, no. 861, which had [[lowbridge]] bodywork on a lowheight [[Dennis Loline]] chassis, and was the lowest ever roofed British double-decker. It was specially designed to pass under an ultra low railway bridge at Sawley Junction, now {{stnlink|Long Eaton}}, station.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.old-bus-photos.co.uk/?p=36241 |website=Old Bus Photos |title=Barton Transport \u2013 Dennis Loline \u2013 861 HAL \u2013 861|accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1950s, Barton had over 280 vehicles and 1,000 employees. Numerous smaller companies were purchased, especially in the 1960s, including Hall Brothers of [[South Shields]] on [[Tyneside]] (1967), and Robin Hood Coaches of [[Nottingham]] (1963), whose emblem was retained and applied to the whole fleet.\n\n===1970s and 1980s===\nFrom the early 1970s, Barton began to standardise on new coaches for all of its purchases. Most were either [[Leyland Leopard]]s or [[Bedford Y series]], and the large majority had [[Plaxton Panorama Elite|Plaxton Elite Express]] or [[Plaxton Supreme|Supreme Express]] bodywork, built with a wide doorway and other minor modifications making them eligible for a Government grant towards their purchase. The wide variety of older vehicles was eradicated within a few years. By this time Barton was Britain's largest independent bus operator, and it was very unusual for such a large operator to use coaches on all of its local services, as well as on tours and express work. In 1981 the company joined the [[British Coachways]] consortium which competed with [[National Express Coaches|National Express]] on long-distance routes. The consortium was wound up in 1982.<ref>{{cite book|last=Townsin|first=Alan|title=The British Bus Story - The Early '80s: The Die is Cast|publisher=The Transport Publishing Company|year=1992|chapter=Coach deregulation arrives|pages=22\u201324|isbn=0-86317-170-2}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Barton bought five [[Leyland Tiger]]s and five [[DAF MB200]]s with [[Plaxton Paramount]] bodywork, these being the company's first modern 12m coaches, although not its first 12m vehicles, since Barton had experimented with lengthening a Daimler bus to 40' before World War I. From 1984 until the sale of the fleet in 1989, Barton standardised on the DAF MB with Plaxton Paramount bodywork, a further 26 being purchased.\n\nIn 1989, the business was sold to the [[Wellglade Group]] and merged with its Trent Buses business to form [[Trentbarton|Trent Barton]].<ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/22nd-june-1989/18/barton-voting-over-revamp Barton voting over revamp] ''[[Commercial Motor]]'' 22 June 1989</ref><ref>[https://www.trentbarton.co.uk/contact-us/centenary History] Trentbarton</ref><ref>[http://www.tramlinknottingham.co.uk/wellglade/ Wellglade] Tramlink Nottingham</ref>\n\n===Centenary===\nOn 1 October 2008, the journey of the first Barton bus, from [[Long Eaton]] to [[Nottingham]]'s Market Square, was recreated to mark the centenary of the company.

Also built to the same style was a unique vehicle, no. 861, which had [[lowbridge]] bodywork on a lowheight [[Dennis Loline]] chassis, and was the lowest ever roofed British double-decker. It was specially designed to pass under an ultra low railway bridge at Sawley Junction, now {{stnlink|Long Eaton}}, station.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.old-bus-photos.co.uk/?p=36241 |website=Old Bus Photos |title=Barton Transport \u2013 Dennis Loline \u2013 861 HAL \u2013 861|accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1950s, Barton had over 280 vehicles and 1,000 employees. Numerous smaller companies were purchased, especially in the 1960s, including Hall Brothers of [[South Shields]] on [[Tyneside]] (1967), and Robin Hood Coaches of [[Nottingham]] (1963), whose emblem was retained and applied to the whole fleet.\n\n===1970s and 1980s===\nFrom the early 1970s, Barton began to standardise on new coaches for all of its purchases. Most were either [[Leyland Leopard]]s or [[Bedford Y series]], and the large majority had [[Plaxton Panorama Elite|Plaxton Elite Express]] or [[Plaxton Supreme|Supreme Express]] bodywork, built with a wide doorway and other minor modifications making them eligible for a Government grant towards their purchase. The wide variety of older vehicles was eradicated within a few years. By this time Barton was Britain's largest independent bus operator, and it was very unusual for such a large operator to use coaches on all of its local services, as well as on tours and express work. In 1981 the company joined the [[British Coachways]] consortium which competed with [[National Express Coaches|National Express]] on long-distance routes. The consortium was wound up in 1982.<ref>{{cite book|last=Townsin|first=Alan|title=The British Bus Story - The Early '80s: The Die is Cast|publisher=The Transport Publishing Company|year=1992|chapter=Coach deregulation arrives|pages=22\u201324|isbn=0-86317-170-2}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Barton bought five [[Leyland Tiger]]s and five [[DAF MB200]]s with [[Plaxton Paramount]] bodywork, these being the company's first modern 12m coaches, although not its first 12m vehicles, since Barton had experimented with lengthening a Daimler bus to 40' before World War I. From 1984 until the sale of the fleet in 1989, Barton standardised on the DAF MB with Plaxton Paramount bodywork, a further 26 being purchased.\n\nIn 1989, the business was sold to the [[Wellglade Group]] and merged with its Trent Buses business to form [[Trentbarton|Trent Barton]].<ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/22nd-june-1989/18/barton-voting-over-revamp Barton voting over revamp] ''[[Commercial Motor]]'' 22 June 1989</ref><ref>[https://www.trentbarton.co.uk/contact-us/centenary History] Trentbarton</ref><ref>[http://www.tramlinknottingham.co.uk/wellglade/ Wellglade] Tramlink Nottingham</ref>\n\n===Centenary===\nOn 1 October 2008, the journey of the first Barton bus, from [[Long Eaton]] to [[Nottingham]]'s Market Square, was recreated to mark the centenary of the company.

During [[World War I]], following the German offensive of 1915, it was occupied by the [[Germany|German]] army. After the war, some parts of the area was ruled by local [[Poland|Polish]] self-government established after the German [[Ober-Ost]] army withdrew from the area.\n\nFollowing the start of the [[Polish-Bolshevik War]] in 1919, it was occupied by the [[Red Army]], which was pushed back by the [[Polish Army]]. In 1920, it was again occupied by the Red Army, but Soviets officially recognized the sovereignty of [[Lithuania|Lithuanian Republic]] over the city immediately after defeat during [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]]. During their retreat, the Bolsheviks passed the sovereignty over the area to Lithuania. The Polish commander [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] ordered his subordinate general [[Lucjan \u017beligowski]] to \"rebel\" his Lithuanian-[[Belarus]]ian division and capture the city of [[Vilnius]], without declaring war on Lithuania. The area of the future Vilnius County was seized by the Polish forces without significant opposition from Lithuanian forces and Gen. \u017beligowski created a short-lived state called [[Republic of Central Lithuania]]. Following the elections held there in 1922 the state was incorporated into Poland (see [[Vilnius region]], [[Republic of Central Lithuania|Central Lithuania]]).\n\nIn the effect of the [[Nazi-Soviet Alliance]] and the [[Invasion of Poland|Polish Defensive War]] of 1939, the area was captured by the [[Soviet Union]], which transferred parts of present ''Vilnius County'' and [[Utena County]] to [[Lithuania]], only to annex it the following year. In 1941, it was conquered by the [[Nazism|Nazi Germany]]. During [[World War II]], the area saw formation of many resistance units, most notably the Polish [[Home Army]] and, after 1943, the [[Soviet partisans]]. After the war, Vilniaus Apskritis existed as a relic of the pre-war independent state in [[Lithuanian SSR]] between 1944 and 1950. In this period, significant part of its population moved to [[Poland]] during so-called [[repatriation]].\n\nAfter 1990 saw the emergence of independent Lithuania, Vilnius county was re-established differently in 1994.

As of 2014, it has a membership of 5\u20136 million.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ifuxzl9NM5sC&pg=PA362&lpg=PA362&dq=rss+is+world's+largest+organization#v=onepage&q=rss+is+world's+largest+organization&f=false|title=Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh: National Upsurge|first=M.

B. Hedgewar|Keshav Baliram Hedgewar]]]]\nRSS was founded in 1925 by [[K. B. Hedgewar|Keshav Baliram Hedgewar]], a doctor in the city of [[Nagpur]], British India.<ref name=\"Curran1950\">{{cite journal |first=Jean A. |last=Curran |jstor=3023941 |title=The RSS: Militant Hinduism |journal=Far Eastern Survey |volume=19 |pages=93\u201398 |number=10 |date= 17 May 1950 |doi=10.2307/3023941}}</ref>\n\nHedgewar was a political protege of [[B. S. Moonje]], a [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilakite]] [[Indian National Congress|Congressman]], [[Hindu Mahasabha]] politician and social activist from Nagpur.  Moonje had sent Hedgewar to Calcutta to pursue his medical studies and to learn combat techniques from the revolutionary secret societies of the Bengalis.  Hedgewar became a member of the [[Anushilan Samiti]], an anti-British revolutionary group, getting into its inner circle. The secretive methods of these societies were eventually used by him in organising the RSS.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nAfter returning to Nagpur, Hedgewar organised anti-British activities through the ''Kranti Dal'' (Party of Revolution) and participated in independence activist [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilak]]'s Home Rule campaign in 1918.  According to the official RSS history,{{sfn|Bhishikar|1979}} he came to realise that revolutionary activities alone were not enough to overthrow the British. After reading [[V. D. Savarkar]]'s ''[[Hindutva: Who is a Hindu?|Hindutva]]'', published in Nagpur in 1923, and meeting Savarkar in the [[Ratnagiri]] prison in 1925, Hedgewar was extremely influenced by him, and he founded the RSS with the objective of strengthening the Hindu society.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}\n\n[[File:RSS meeting 1939.jpg|thumb|right|A rare group [[photo]] of six initial ''swayamsevaks'' taken on the occasion of a RSS meeting held in 1939<ref>Krant M. L. Verma ''Swadhinta Sangram Ke Krantikari Sahitya Ka Itihas'' (Vol{{nbsp}}3) p.{{nbsp}}854 (Dr.{{nbsp}}Hedgewar with five other ''swayamsevaks'' who established RSS in 1925)</ref>]]\nHedgewar believed that a handful of British were able to rule over the vast country of India because Hindus were disunited, lacked valour (''pararkram'') and lacked a civic character.  He recruited energetic Hindu youth with revolutionary fervour, gave them a uniform of a black forage cap, khaki shirt (later white shirt) and khaki shorts\u2014emulating the British police\u2014and taught them paramilitary techniques with ''lathi'' (bamboo staff), sword, javelin, and dagger. Hindu ceremonies and rituals played a large role in the organisation, not so much for religious observance, but to provide awareness of India's glorious past and to bind the members in a religious communion. Hedgewar also held weekly sessions of what he called ''baudhik'' (ideological education), consisting of simple questions to the novices concerning the Hindu nation and its history and heroes, especially warrior king [[Shivaji]]. The saffron flag of Shivaji, the [[Bhagwa Dhwaj]], was used as the emblem for the new organisation. Its public tasks involved protecting Hindu pilgrims at festivals and confronting Muslim resistance against Hindu processions near mosques.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nTwo years into the life of the organisation, in 1927, Hedgewar organised an \"Officers' Training Camp\" with the objective of forming a corps of key workers, whom he called ''pracharaks''. He asked the volunteers to become [[sadhu]]s first, renouncing professional and family lives and dedicating themselves to the cause of the RSS.  According to scholar [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], Hedgewar embraced this doctrine after it had been reinterpreted by nationalists such as [[Aurobindo]]. The tradition of renunciation gave the RSS the character of a 'Hindu sect'.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=40\u201341}} Development of the ''shakha'' network of the RSS was the main preoccupation for Hedgewar throughout his career as the RSS chief.  The first ''pracharaks'' were responsible for establishing as many ''shakhas'' as possible, first in Nagpur, then across Maharashtra and eventually in the rest of India. [[Prabhakar Balwant Dani|P. B. Dani]] was sent to establish a ''shakha'' at the [[Benaras Hindu University]] and other universities were similarly targeted to recruit new followers among the student population.  Three ''pracharaks'' went to Punjab: Appaji Joshi to [[Sialkot]], Moreshwar Munje to the [[DAV College]] in [[Rawalpindi]] and Raja Bhau Paturkar to the [[DAV College]] in [[Lahore]].  In 1940, Madhavrao Muley was appointed as the ''prant pracharak'' (regional missionary) in Lahore.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=65\u201367}}\n\n== Motivations ==\nScholars differ on Hedgewar's motivations for forming the RSS, especially because he never involved the RSS in fighting the British rule. Jaffrelot says that the RSS was intended to propagate the ideology of [[Hindutva]] and to provide \"new physical strength\" to the majority community.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot 2010\"/> An alternative interpretation is that he formed it to fight the Indian Muslims.{{sfn|Chitkara, National Upsurge|2004|p=249}}\n\n=== Tilakite ideology ===\nAfter Tilak's demise in 1920, like other followers of Tilak in Nagpur, Hedgewar was opposed to some of the programmes adopted by Gandhi. Gandhi's stance on the Indian Muslim [[Khilafat Movement|Khilafat issue]] was a cause for concern to Hedgewar, and so was the fact that the 'cow protection' was not on the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] agenda. This led Hedgewar, along with other Tilakities, to part ways with Gandhi. In 1921, Hedgewar delivered a series of lectures in Maharashtra with slogans such as \"Freedom within a year\" and \"boycott\". He deliberately broke the law, for which he was imprisoned for a year. After being released in 1922, Hedgewar was distressed at the lack of organisation among the Congress volunteers for the independence struggle. Without proper mobilisation and organisation, he felt that the patriotic youth of India could never get independence for the country. Subsequently, he felt the need to create an independent organisation that was based on the country's traditions and history.{{sfn|Andersen, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh: Early Concerns|1972}}\n\n=== Hindu-Muslim relations ===\nThe decade of 1920s witnessed a significant deterioration in the relations between Hindus and Muslims.  The Muslim masses were mobilised by the [[Khilafat movement]], demanding the reinstatement of the Caliphate in Turkey, and [[Gandhi]] made an alliance with it for conducting his own [[Non-co-operation movement]]. Gandhi aimed to create [[Hindu-Muslim unity]] in forming the alliance. However, the alliance saw a \"common enemy\", not a \"common enmity\".<ref>{{harvp|Stern, Democracy and Dictatorship in South Asia|2001|p=27}}. Quote: '... mobilizaiton of Indian Muslims in the name of Islam and in defense of the Ottoman ''khalifa'' was inherently \"communal\", no less than the Islamic movements of opposition to British imperialism which preceded it.... All defined a Hindu no less than a British \"other\".'</ref> When Gandhi called off the Non-co-operation movement due to outbreaks of violence, Muslims disagreed with his strategy. Once the movements failed, the mobilised Muslims turned their anger towards Hindus.<ref>{{harvp|Stern, Democracy and Dictatorship in South Asia|2001}}; {{harvp|Misra, Identity and Religion: Foundations of Anti-Islamism in India|2004}}</ref> The first major incident of religious violence was reportedly the [[Moplah rebellion]] in August 1921, it was widely narrated that the rebellion ended in large-scale violence against Hindu in [[Malabar region|Malabar]].  A cycle of inter-communal violence throughout India followed for several years.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|pp=19\u201320}} In 1923, there were riots in Nagpur, called \"Muslim riots\" by Hedgewar, where Hindus were felt to be \"totally disorganized and panicky.\" These incidents made a major impression on Hedgewar and convinced him of the need to organise the Hindu society.{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|p=34}}\n\nAfter acquiring about 100 ''swayamsevaks'' (volunteers) to the RSS in 1927, Hedgewar took the issue to the Muslim domain. He led the Hindu religious procession for [[Ganesha]], beating the drums in defiance of the usual practice not to pass in front of a mosque with music.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=40}} On the day of [[Lakshmi Puja]] on 4 September, Muslims are said to have retaliated.  When the Hindu procession reached a mosque in the Mahal area of Nagpur, Muslims blocked it. Later in the afternoon, they attacked the Hindu residences in the Mahal area. It is said that the RSS cadres were prepared for the attack and beat the Muslim rioters back. [[1927 Nagpur riots|Riots]] continued for 3 days and the army had to be called in to quell the violence. RSS organised the Hindu resistance and protected the Hindu households while the Muslim households had to leave Nagpur ''en masse'' for safety.{{sfn|Chitkara, National Upsurge|2004|p=250}}{{sfn|Basu & Sarkar, Khaki Shorts and Saffron Flags|1993|pp=19\u201320}}{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}{{sfn|Frykenberg|1996|p=241}} Tapan Basu et al. note the accounts of \"Muslim aggressiveness\" and the \"Hindu self-defence\" in the RSS descriptions of the incident. The above incident vastly enhanced the prestige of the RSS and enabled its subsequent expansion.{{sfn|Basu & Sarkar, Khaki Shorts and Saffron Flags|1993|pp=19\u201320}}\n\n=== Stigmatisation and emulation ===\n[[Christophe Jaffrelot]] points out the theme of \"stigmatisation and emulation\" in the ideology of the RSS along with other Hindu nationalist movements such as the [[Arya Samaj]] and the Hindu Mahasabha.  Muslims, Christians and the British were thought of as \"foreign bodies\" implanted in the Hindu nation, who were able to exploit the disunity and absence of valour among the Hindus in order to subdue them. The solution lay in emulating the characteristics of these \"Threatening Others\" that were perceived to give them strength, such as paramilitary organisation, emphasis on unity and nationalism. The Hindu nationalists combined these emulatory aspects with a selective borrowing of traditions from the Hindu past to achieve a synthesis that was uniquely Indian and Hindu.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|loc=Chapter 1}}\n\n=== Hindu Mahasabha influence ===\nThe [[Hindu Mahasabha]], which was initially a special interest group within the [[Indian National Congress]] and later an independent party, was an important influence on the RSS, even though it is rarely acknowledged. In 1923, prominent Hindu leaders like [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] met together on this platform and voiced their concerns on the 'division in the Hindu community'. In his presidential speech to Mahasabha, Malaviya stated: \"Friendship could exist between equals. If the Hindus made themselves strong and the rowdy section among the Mahomedans were convinced they could not safely rob and dishonour Hindus, unity would be established on a stable basis.\" He wanted the activists 'to educate all boys and girls, establish ''akharas'' (gymnasiums), establish a volunteer corps to persuade people to comply with decisions of the Hindu Mahasabha, to accept untouchables as Hindus and grant them the right to use wells, enter temples, get an education.' Later, Hindu Mahasabha leader [[V. D. Savarkar]]'s 'Hindutva' ideology also had a profound impact on Hedgewar's thinking about the 'Hindu nation'.{{sfn|Andersen, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh: Early Concerns|1972}}\n\nThe initial meeting for the formation of the Sangh on the [[Vijaya Dashami]] day of 1925 was held between Hedgewar and four Hindu Mahasabha leaders: [[B. S. Moonje]], [[Ganesh Savarkar]], [[L. V. Paranjpe]] and B. B. Tholkar. RSS took part as a volunteer force in organising the Hindu Mahasabha annual meeting in Akola in 1931.  Moonje remained a patron of the RSS throughout his life.  Both he and Ganesh Savarkar worked to spread the RSS ''shakhas'' in Maharashtra, Panjab, Delhi, and the princely states by initiating contacts with local leaders.  Savarkar merged his own youth organisation ''Tarun Hindu Sabha'' with the RSS and helped its expansion. V. D. Savarkar, after his release in 1937, joined them in spreading the RSS and giving speeches in its support.  Officials in the Home Department called the RSS the \"volunteer organisation of the Hindu Mahasabha.\"{{sfn|Bapu|2013|pp=97\u2013100}}{{sfn|Goyal|1979|pp=59\u201376}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Indian Independence Movement===\nAfter the formation of the RSS, which portrays itself as a social movement, Hedgewar kept the organisation from having any direct affiliation with the political organisations then fighting British rule.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/655722.stm|title=RSS aims for a Hindu nation|date=10 March 2003|work=BBC News|accessdate=26 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124011631/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/655722.stm|archive-date=24 November 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> RSS rejected Gandhi's willingness to co-operate with the Muslims.{{sfn|Nussbaum, The Clash Within|2008|p=156}}{{sfn|Bhatt, Hindu Nationalism|2001|p=115}}\n\nIn accordance with Hedgewar's tradition of keeping the RSS away from the Indian Independence movement, any political activity that could be construed as being anti-British was carefully avoided.

It stated:{{Quote|Even though Dr. Ambedkar is reported to have recently stated in [[Bombay]] that the days of Manu have ended it is nevertheless a fact that the daily lives of Hindus are even at present-day affected by the principles and injunctions contained in the ''Manusmrithi'' and other ''[[Smriti]]s''.

Accordingly, the [[Kapur Commission|Justice Kapur Commission]]<ref name=\"kapoor\">{{cite book|title=Report of Commission of Inquiry into Conspiracy to murder Mahatma Gandhi, By India (Republic).

Following his release in August 1948, Golwalkar wrote to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to lift the ban on RSS. After Nehru replied that the matter was the responsibility of the Home Minister, Golwalkar consulted Vallabhai Patel regarding the same.

Later, a constitution was drafted for RSS, which, however, initially did not meet any of Patel's demands. After a failed attempt to agitate again, eventually the RSS's constitution was amended according to Patel's wishes with the exception of the procedure for selecting the head of the organisation and the enrolment of pre-adolescents. However, the organisation's internal democracy which was written into its constitution, remained a 'dead letter'.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=89}}\n\nOn 11 July 1949 the Government of India lifted the ban on the RSS by issuing a communique stating that the decision to lift the ban on the RSS had been taken in view of the RSS leader Golwalkar's undertaking to make the group's loyalty towards the Constitution of India and acceptance and respect towards the National Flag of India more explicit in the Constitution of the RSS, which was to be worked out in a democratic manner.<ref name=\"Curran1950\"/><ref name=\"Noorani2000\" />\n\n===Decolonisation of Dadra, Nagar Haveli, and Goa===\n\nAfter India had achieved independence, the RSS was one of the socio-political organisations that supported and participated in movements to decolonise [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], which at that time was ruled by Portugal. In early 1954 volunteers Raja Wakankar and Nana Kajrekar of the RSS visited the area round about Dadra, Nagar Haveli, and Daman several times to study the topography and get acquainted with locals who wanted the area to change from being a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colony]] to being an [[States and Territories of India|Indian union territory]]. In April 1954 the RSS formed a coalition with the National Movement Liberation Organisation (NMLO) and the Azad Gomantak Dal (AGD) for the annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli into the Republic of India.<ref name=\"PurushottamShripad\">Purushottam Shripad Lele, Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present, published by Usha P. Lele, 1987</ref> On the night of 21 July, United Front of Goans, a group working independently of the coalition, captured the Portuguese police station at Dadra and declared Dadra independent. Subsequently, on 28 July, volunteer teams from the RSS and AGD captured the territories of Naroli and Phiparia and ultimately the capital of [[Silvassa]]. The Portuguese forces that had escaped and moved towards Nagar Haveli, were assaulted at Khandvel and forced to retreat until they surrendered to the Indian border police at Udava on 11 August 1954. A native administration was set up with Appasaheb Karmalkar of the NMLO as the Administrator of Dadra and Nagar Haveli on 11 August 1954.<ref name=\"PurushottamShripad\" />\n\nThe capture of Dadra and Nagar Haveli gave a boost to the movement against Portuguese colonial rule in the Indian subcontinent.<ref name=\"PurushottamShripad\"/> In 1955 RSS leaders demanded the end of Portuguese rule in Goa and its integration into India. When Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru refused to provide an armed intervention, RSS leader Jagannath Rao Joshi led the Satyagraha agitation straight into Goa. He was imprisoned with his followers by the Portuguese police. The nonviolent protests continued but met with repression. On 15 August 1955, the Portuguese police opened fire on the ''satyagrahis'', killing thirty or so civilians.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=130}}\n\nGoa was later [[Annexation of Goa|annexed into the Indian union]] in 1961 through an army operation, codenamed '[[Operation Vijay (1961)|Operation Vijay]]', that was carried out by the Nehru government.\n\n===War-time activities===\nAfter the declaration of [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 Bangladesh War of Independence]] by [[Indira Gandhi]], RSS provided support to the government, by offering its services to maintain law and order in Delhi and its volunteers were apparently the first to donate blood.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=243}}\n\n===Movement against the Emergency===\nIn 1975 the Indira Gandhi government proclaimed [[The Emergency (India)|emergency rule in India]], thereby suspending [[fundamental rights (India)|fundamental rights]] and curtailing the [[freedom of the press]].<ref name=emma>Emma Tarlo, ''Unsettling Memories: Narratives of India's \"emergency\"'', Published by Orient Blackswan, 2003, {{ISBN|81-7824-066-1}}, {{ISBN|978-81-7824-066-4}}</ref> This action was taken after the Supreme Court of India cancelled her election to the Indian Parliament on charges of [[malpractice]]s in the election.<ref name=emma/> Democratic institutions were suspended and prominent opposition leaders, including Gandhian [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], were arrested whilst thousands of people were detained without any charges taken up against them.{{sfn|Nussbaum, The Clash Within|2008}} RSS, which was seen as being close to opposition leaders, and with its large organisational base was seen to have the capability of organising protests against the government, was also banned.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=297}}\n\nDeoras, the then chief of RSS, wrote letters to Indira Gandhi, promising her to extend the organisation's co-operation in return for the lifting of the ban, asserting that RSS had no connection with the [[Bihar Movement|movement in Bihar]] and [[Navnirman Andolan|that in Gujarat]].

When Golwalkar wrote to Nehru asking for the lifting of the ban on RSS after Gandhi's assassination, Nehru replied that the government had proof that RSS activities were 'anti-national' by virtue of being 'communalist'. In his letter to the heads of provincial governments in December 1947, Nehru wrote that \"we have a great deal of evidence to show that RSS is an organisation which is in the nature of a private army and which is definitely proceeding on the strictest Nazi lines, even following the techniques of the organisation\".{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=87, 88}}\n\nSardar [[Vallabhbhai Patel|Vallabhai Patel]], the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India, said in early January 1948 that the RSS activists were \"patriots who love their country\". He asked the Congressmen to 'win over' the RSS by love, instead of trying to 'crush' them. He also appealed to the RSS to join the Congress instead of opposing it. Jaffrelot says that this attitude of Patel can be partly explained by the assistance the RSS gave the Indian administration in maintaining public order in September 1947, and that his expression of 'qualified sympathy' towards RSS reflected the long-standing inclination of several Hindu traditionalists in Congress. However, after Gandhi's assassination on 30 January 1948, Patel began to view that the activities of RSS were a danger to public security.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=86-}}{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=12}} In his reply letter to Golwalkar on 11 September 1948 regarding the lifting of ban on RSS, Patel stated that though RSS did service to the Hindu society by helping and protecting the Hindus when in need during partition violence, they also began attacking Muslims with revenge and went against \"innocent men, women and children\". He said that the speeches of RSS were \"full of communal poison\", and as a result of that 'poison', he remarked, India had to lose Gandhi, noting that the RSS men had celebrated Gandhi's death. Patel was also apprehensive of the secrecy in the working manner of RSS, and complained that all of its provincial heads were Maratha Brahmins. He criticised the RSS for having its own army inside India, which he said, cannot be permitted as \"it was a potential danger to the State\". He also remarked: \"The members of RSS claimed to be the defenders of Hinduism. But they must understand that Hinduism would not be saved by rowdyism.\"{{sfn|Patel, Prasad and Rajaji: Myth of the Indian Right|2015|pp=82}}\n\n[[Rajendra Prasad]], the first President of India, did not approve of RSS. In 1948, he criticised RSS for carrying out 'loot, arson, rioting and killing of Muslims' in Delhi and other Hindu majority areas. In his letter to home minister Patel on 14 May 1948, he stated that RSS men had planned to dress up as Muslims in Hindu majority areas and attack Muslims in Muslim majority areas to create trouble. He asked Patel to take strict action against RSS for aiming to create enmity among Hindus and Muslims. He called RSS a [[Maharashtrian Brahmin]] movement, and viewed it as a secret organisation which used violence and promoted fascism, without any regard to truthful means and constitutional methods.

of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh as the revitalisation of the Indian value system based on universalism and peace and prosperity to all.<ref name=\"bunch\">M S Golwalkar, Bunch of Thoughts, Publishers: Sahitya Sindhu Prakashana</ref> [[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam]], the worldview that the whole world is one family, propounded by the ancient thinkers of India, is considered as one of the ideologies of the organisation.<ref name=\"sheshadri\">H. V. Seshadri, ''Hindu renaissance under way'', Published in 1984, Jagarana Prakashana, Distributors, Rashtrotthana Sahitya (Bangalore)</ref>\n\nBut the immediate focus, the leaders believe, is on the Hindu renaissance, which would build an egalitarian society and a strong India that could propound this philosophy. Hence, the focus is on social reform, economic upliftment of the downtrodden, and the protection of the cultural diversity of the natives in India.<ref name=\"sheshadri\" /> The organisation says it aspires to unite all Hindus and build a strong India that can contribute to the welfare of the world. In the words of RSS ideologue and the second head of the RSS, Golwalkar, \"in order to be able to contribute our unique knowledge to mankind, in order to be able to live and strive for the unity and welfare of the world, we stand before the world as a self-confident, resurgent and mighty nation\".<ref name=\"bunch\" />\n\nIn ''Vichardhara'' (ideology), Golwalkar affirms the RSS mission of integration as:<ref name=\"bunch\" />\n{{Quote|RSS has been making determined efforts to inculcate in our people the burning devotion for Bharat and its national ethos; kindle in them the spirit of dedication and sterling qualities and character; rouse social consciousness, mutual good-will, love and cooperation among them all; to make them realise that casts, creeds, and languages are secondary and that service to the nation is the supreme end and to mold their behaviour accordingly; instill in them a sense of true humility and discipline and train their bodies to be strong and robust so as to shoulder any social responsibility; and thus to create all-round Anushasana (Discipline) in all walks of life and build together all our people into a unified harmonious national whole, extending from Himalayas to Kanyakumari.|[[M.

The movement considers Hindus as inclusive of Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, tribals, untouchables, Veerashaivism, Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna Mission, and other groups as a community, a view similar to the inclusive referencing of the term Hindu in the Indian Constitution Article 25 (2)(b).<ref>Martin E.

G.|year=2000|isbn=9788187496137|location=New Delhi|pages=99}}</ref>\n\n=== Involvement in politics ===\nSeveral Sangh Parivar politicians such as [[Balraj Madhok]] in the 1960s and 1970s to the [[BJP]] leaders like [[L. K. Advani]] have complained about the RSS's interference in party politics. Though some former Hindu nationalists believed that Sangh should take part in politics, they failed to draw the RSS, which was intended to be a purely cultural movement, into the political arena until the 1950s. Savarkar tried to convince Hedgewar and later Golwalkar, to tie up with Hindu Mahasabha, but failed to do so.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\nUnder pressure from other ''swayamsevaks'', Golwalkar gradually changed his mind after independence under unusual circumstances during the ban on RSS in 1948 after the assassination of Gandhi. After the first wave of arrests of RSS activists at that time, some of its members who had gone underground recommended that their movement be involved in politics, seeing that no political force was present to advocate the cause of RSS in parliament or anywhere else. One such member who significantly suggested this cause was [[K. R. Malkani]], who wrote in 1949:{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\n{{quote|Sangh must take part in politics not only to protect itself against the greedy design of politicians, but to stop the un-Bharatiya and anti-Bharatiya policies of the Government and to advance and expedite the cause of Bharatiya through state machinery side by side with official effort in the same direction. ... Sangh must continue as it is, an ''ashram'' for the national cultural education of the entire citizenry, but it must develop a political wing for the more effective and early achievement of its ideals.}}\n\nGolwalkar approved of Malkani's and others' views regarding the formation of a new party in 1950. Jaffrelot says that the death of Sardar Patel influenced this change since Golwalkar opined that Patel could have transformed the Congress party by emphasising its affinities with Hindu nationalism, while after Patel, Nehru became strong enough to impose his 'anti-communal' line within his party. Accordingly, Golwalkar met [[Syama Prasad Mukherjee]] and agreed for endorsing senior ''swayamsevaks'', who included [[Deendayal Upadhyaya]], Balraj Madhok and [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], to the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], a newly formed political party by Mukherjee. These men, who took their orders in Nagpur, captured power in the party after Mukherjee's death.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\n[[Balasaheb Deoras]], who succeeded Golwalkar as the chief of RSS, got very much involved in politics. In 1965, when he was the general secretary of the RSS, he addressed the annual meeting of Jana Sangh, which is seen as an \"unprecedented move\" by an RSS dignitary that reflected his strong interest in politics and his will to make the movement play a larger part in the public sphere. Jaffrelot says that he exemplified the specific kind of swayamsevaks known as 'activists', giving expression to his leanings towards political activism by having the RSS support the [[Bihar Movement|JP Movement]].{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} The importance that RSS began to give to the electoral politics is demonstrated when its units (''shakhas'') were made constituency-based in the early 1970s, from which the RSS shakhas began to involve directly in elections, not only of legislatures, but also of trade unions, student and cultural organisations.{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}}\n\nAs soon as the RSS men took over the Jana Sangh party, the Hindu traditionalists who previously joined the party because of S. P. Mukherjee were sidelined.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=Your explanation here}} The organisation of the party was restructured and all its organisational secretaries, who were the pillars of the party, came from the RSS, both at the district and state level. The party also took the vision of RSS in its mission, where its ultimate objective, in the long run, was the reform of society, but not the conquest of power, since the 'state' was not viewed as a prominent institution. Hence the Jana Sangh initially remained reluctant to join any alliance that was not fully in harmony with its ideology. In 1962, Deendayal Upadhyaya, who was the party's chief, explained this approach by saying that \"coalitions were bound to degenerate into a struggle for power by opportunist elements coming together in the interest of expediency\". He wanted to build the party as an alternative party to the Congress and saw the elections as an \"opportunity to educate the people on political issues and to challenge the right of the Congress to be in power\". Jaffrelot says that this indifferent approach of party politics was in accordance with its lack of interest in the 'state' and the wish to make it weaker, or more decentralised.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} After India's defeat in the [[Sino-Indian War|1962 Sino\u2013Indian war]], the RSS and other right-wing forces in India were strengthened since the leftist and centrist opinions, sometimes even Nehru himself, could then be blamed for being 'soft' towards China. The RSS and Jana Sangh also took complete advantage of the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965 war with Pakistan]] to \"deepen suspicion about Muslims\", and also en-cashed the growing unpopularity of Congress, particularly in the [[Hindi Belt|Hindi-belt]], where a left-wing alternative was weak or non-existent.{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} The major themes on the party's agenda during this period were banning [[Cattle slaughter in India|cow slaughter]], abolishing the [[Article 370 of the Constitution of India|special status given to Jammu and Kashmir]], and legislating a [[uniform civil code]]. Explaining the Jana Sangh's failure to become a major political force despite claiming to represent the national interests of the Hindus, scholar Bruce Desmond Graham states that the party's close initial ties with the Hindi-belt and its preoccupation with the issues of North India such as promotion of Hindi, energetic resistance to Pakistan etc., had become a serious disadvantage to the party in the long run. He also adds that its interpretation of Hinduism was \"restrictive and exclusive\", arguing that \"its doctrines were inspired by an activist version of Hindu nationalism and, indirectly, by the values of [[Brahmanism]] rather than the devotional and quietist values of popular Hinduism.\"{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=253}} Desmond says that, if the Jana Sangh had carefully moderated its Hindu nationalism, it could have been able to well-exploit any strong increase in support for the traditional and nationalist Hindu opinion, and hence to compete on equal terms with the Congress in the northern states. He also remarks that if it had adopted a less harsh attitude towards Pakistan and Muslims, \"it would have been much more acceptable to Hindu traditionalists in the central and southern states, where partition had left fewer emotional scars.\"{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe Jana Sangh started making alliances by entering the anti-Congress coalitions since 1960s. It became part of the 1971 Grand Alliance and finally merged itself with the [[Janata Party]] in 1977.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} The success of Janata Party in [[1977 Indian general election|1977 elections]] made the RSS members central ministers for the first time (Vajpayee, Advani and [[Brij Lal Verma]]),{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} and provided the RSS with an opportunity to avail the state and its instruments to further its ends, through the resources of various state governments as well as the central government.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8v7Vr2iQUHkC&pg=PA240|title=India Since Independence: Making Sense of Indian Politics|last=Krishna|first=Ananth V.|publisher=Pearson Education India|year=2011|isbn=9788131734650|pages=240|language=en}}</ref> However, this merge, which was seen as a dilution of its original doctrine, was viewed by the ex-Jana Sanghis as submersion of their initial identity. Meanwhile, the other components of the Janata Party denounced the allegiance the ex-Jana Sanghis continued to pay to the RSS. This led to a 'dual membership' controversy, regarding the links the former Jana Sangh members were retaining with the RSS, and it led to the split of Janata Party in 1979.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\nThe former Jana Sangh elements formed a new party, [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), in 1980. However, BJP originated more as a successor to the Janata Party and did not return to the beginning stages of the Hindu nationalist identity and Jana Sangh doctrines. The RSS resented this dilution of ideology \u2013 the new slogans promoted by the then BJP president Vajpayee like 'Gandhian socialism' and 'positive secularism'. By early 1980s, RSS is said to have established its political strategy of \"never keeping all its eggs in one basket\". It even decided to support Congress in some states, for instance, to create the [[Hindu Munnani]] in Tamil Nadu in the backdrop of the [[1981 Meenakshipuram conversion|1981 Meenakshipuram mass conversion to Islam]], and to support one of its offshoots, [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP), to launch an enthno-religious movement on the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. BJP did not have much electoral success in its initial years and was able to win only two seats in the [[1984 Indian general election|1984 elections]]. After L. K. Advani replaced Vajpayee as party president in 1986, the BJP also began to rally around the Ayodhya campaign. In 1990, the party organised the ''[[Ram Rath Yatra]]'' to advance this campaign in large-scale.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} Advani also attacked the then ruling Congress party with the slogans such as '[[pseudo-secularism]]', accusing Congress of misusing secularism for the political appeasement of minorities, and established an explicit and unambiguous path of Hindu revival.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe 'instrumentalisation' of the Ayodhya issue and the related communal riots which polarised the electorate along religious lines helped the BJP make good progress in the subsequent elections of [[1989 Indian general election|1989]], [[1991 Indian general election|1991]] and [[1996 Indian general election|1996]]. However, in the mid-1990s, BJP adopted a more moderate approach to politics in order to make allies. As Jaffrelot remarks, it was because the party realised during then that it would not be in a position to form the government on its own in the near future. In 1998, it built a major coalition, [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA), in the Lok Sabha and succeeded in the [[1998 Indian general election|general election in 1998]], and was able to succeed again in the [[1999 Indian general election|mid-term elections of 1999]], with Vajpayee as their Prime Ministerial candidate. Though the RSS and other Sangh Parivar components appreciated some of the steps taken by the Vajpayee government, like the [[Pokhran-II|testing of a nuclear bomb]], they felt disappointed with the government's overall performance. The fact that no solid step was taken towards building the [[Rama|Ram]] temple in Ayodhya was resented by the VHP. The [[Premiership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee#Economic policy|liberalisation policy of the government]] faced objection from the [[Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh]], a trade union controlled by the RSS. Jaffrelot says, RSS and the other Sangh Parivar elements had come to the view that the \"BJP leaders had been victims of their thirst for power: they had preferred to compromise to remain in office instead of sticking to their principles.\"{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175-179}}\n\nAfter the end of Vajpayee's tenure in 2004, BJP remained as a major opposition party in the subsequent years; and again in the year 2014, the NDA came to power after BJP gained an overwhelming majority in the [[2014 Indian general election|2014 general elections]], with [[Narendra Modi]], a former RSS member who previously served as Gujarat's chief minister for three tenures, as their prime ministerial candidate.

B. Hedgewar|Keshav Baliram Hedgewar]]]]\nRSS was founded in 1925 by [[K. B. Hedgewar|Keshav Baliram Hedgewar]], a doctor in the city of [[Nagpur]], British India.<ref name=\"Curran1950\">{{cite journal |first=Jean A. |last=Curran |jstor=3023941 |title=The RSS: Militant Hinduism |journal=Far Eastern Survey |volume=19 |pages=93\u201398 |number=10 |date= 17 May 1950 |doi=10.2307/3023941}}</ref>\n\nHedgewar was a political protege of [[B. S. Moonje]], a [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilakite]] [[Indian National Congress|Congressman]], [[Hindu Mahasabha]] politician and social activist from Nagpur.  Moonje had sent Hedgewar to Calcutta to pursue his medical studies and to learn combat techniques from the revolutionary secret societies of the Bengalis.  Hedgewar became a member of the [[Anushilan Samiti]], an anti-British revolutionary group, getting into its inner circle. The secretive methods of these societies were eventually used by him in organising the RSS.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nAfter returning to Nagpur, Hedgewar organised anti-British activities through the ''Kranti Dal'' (Party of Revolution) and participated in independence activist [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilak]]'s Home Rule campaign in 1918.  According to the official RSS history,{{sfn|Bhishikar|1979}} he came to realise that revolutionary activities alone were not enough to overthrow the British. After reading [[V. D. Savarkar]]'s ''[[Hindutva: Who is a Hindu?|Hindutva]]'', published in Nagpur in 1923, and meeting Savarkar in the [[Ratnagiri]] prison in 1925, Hedgewar was extremely influenced by him, and he founded the RSS with the objective of strengthening the Hindu society.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}\n\n[[File:RSS meeting 1939.jpg|thumb|right|A rare group [[photo]] of six initial ''swayamsevaks'' taken on the occasion of a RSS meeting held in 1939<ref>Krant M. L. Verma ''Swadhinta Sangram Ke Krantikari Sahitya Ka Itihas'' (Vol{{nbsp}}3) p.{{nbsp}}854 (Dr.{{nbsp}}Hedgewar with five other ''swayamsevaks'' who established RSS in 1925)</ref>]]\nHedgewar believed that a handful of British were able to rule over the vast country of India because Hindus were disunited, lacked valour (''pararkram'') and lacked a civic character.  He recruited energetic Hindu youth with revolutionary fervour, gave them a uniform of a black forage cap, khaki shirt (later white shirt) and khaki shorts\u2014emulating the British police\u2014and taught them paramilitary techniques with ''lathi'' (bamboo staff), sword, javelin, and dagger. Hindu ceremonies and rituals played a large role in the organisation, not so much for religious observance, but to provide awareness of India's glorious past and to bind the members in a religious communion. Hedgewar also held weekly sessions of what he called ''baudhik'' (ideological education), consisting of simple questions to the novices concerning the Hindu nation and its history and heroes, especially warrior king [[Shivaji]]. The saffron flag of Shivaji, the [[Bhagwa Dhwaj]], was used as the emblem for the new organisation. Its public tasks involved protecting Hindu pilgrims at festivals and confronting Muslim resistance against Hindu processions near mosques.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nTwo years into the life of the organisation, in 1927, Hedgewar organised an \"Officers' Training Camp\" with the objective of forming a corps of key workers, whom he called ''pracharaks''. He asked the volunteers to become [[sadhu]]s first, renouncing professional and family lives and dedicating themselves to the cause of the RSS.  According to scholar [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], Hedgewar embraced this doctrine after it had been reinterpreted by nationalists such as [[Aurobindo]]. The tradition of renunciation gave the RSS the character of a 'Hindu sect'.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=40\u201341}} Development of the ''shakha'' network of the RSS was the main preoccupation for Hedgewar throughout his career as the RSS chief.  The first ''pracharaks'' were responsible for establishing as many ''shakhas'' as possible, first in Nagpur, then across Maharashtra and eventually in the rest of India. [[Prabhakar Balwant Dani|P. B. Dani]] was sent to establish a ''shakha'' at the [[Benaras Hindu University]] and other universities were similarly targeted to recruit new followers among the student population.  Three ''pracharaks'' went to Punjab: Appaji Joshi to [[Sialkot]], Moreshwar Munje to the [[DAV College]] in [[Rawalpindi]] and Raja Bhau Paturkar to the [[DAV College]] in [[Lahore]].  In 1940, Madhavrao Muley was appointed as the ''prant pracharak'' (regional missionary) in Lahore.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=65\u201367}}\n\n== Motivations ==\nScholars differ on Hedgewar's motivations for forming the RSS, especially because he never involved the RSS in fighting the British rule. Jaffrelot says that the RSS was intended to propagate the ideology of [[Hindutva]] and to provide \"new physical strength\" to the majority community.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot 2010\"/> An alternative interpretation is that he formed it to fight the Indian Muslims.{{sfn|Chitkara, National Upsurge|2004|p=249}}\n\n=== Tilakite ideology ===\nAfter Tilak's demise in 1920, like other followers of Tilak in Nagpur, Hedgewar was opposed to some of the programmes adopted by Gandhi. Gandhi's stance on the Indian Muslim [[Khilafat Movement|Khilafat issue]] was a cause for concern to Hedgewar, and so was the fact that the 'cow protection' was not on the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] agenda. This led Hedgewar, along with other Tilakities, to part ways with Gandhi. In 1921, Hedgewar delivered a series of lectures in Maharashtra with slogans such as \"Freedom within a year\" and \"boycott\". He deliberately broke the law, for which he was imprisoned for a year. After being released in 1922, Hedgewar was distressed at the lack of organisation among the Congress volunteers for the independence struggle. Without proper mobilisation and organisation, he felt that the patriotic youth of India could never get independence for the country. Subsequently, he felt the need to create an independent organisation that was based on the country's traditions and history.{{sfn|Andersen, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh: Early Concerns|1972}}\n\n=== Hindu-Muslim relations ===\nThe decade of 1920s witnessed a significant deterioration in the relations between Hindus and Muslims.  The Muslim masses were mobilised by the [[Khilafat movement]], demanding the reinstatement of the Caliphate in Turkey, and [[Gandhi]] made an alliance with it for conducting his own [[Non-co-operation movement]]. Gandhi aimed to create [[Hindu-Muslim unity]] in forming the alliance. However, the alliance saw a \"common enemy\", not a \"common enmity\".<ref>{{harvp|Stern, Democracy and Dictatorship in South Asia|2001|p=27}}.

A cycle of inter-communal violence throughout India followed for several years.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|pp=19\u201320}} In 1923, there were riots in Nagpur, called \"Muslim riots\" by Hedgewar, where Hindus were felt to be \"totally disorganized and panicky.\" These incidents made a major impression on Hedgewar and convinced him of the need to organise the Hindu society.{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|p=34}}\n\nAfter acquiring about 100 ''swayamsevaks'' (volunteers) to the RSS in 1927, Hedgewar took the issue to the Muslim domain. He led the Hindu religious procession for [[Ganesha]], beating the drums in defiance of the usual practice not to pass in front of a mosque with music.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=40}} On the day of [[Lakshmi Puja]] on 4 September, Muslims are said to have retaliated.  When the Hindu procession reached a mosque in the Mahal area of Nagpur, Muslims blocked it. Later in the afternoon, they attacked the Hindu residences in the Mahal area. It is said that the RSS cadres were prepared for the attack and beat the Muslim rioters back. [[1927 Nagpur riots|Riots]] continued for 3 days and the army had to be called in to quell the violence. RSS organised the Hindu resistance and protected the Hindu households while the Muslim households had to leave Nagpur ''en masse'' for safety.{{sfn|Chitkara, National Upsurge|2004|p=250}}{{sfn|Basu & Sarkar, Khaki Shorts and Saffron Flags|1993|pp=19\u201320}}{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}{{sfn|Frykenberg|1996|p=241}} Tapan Basu et al. note the accounts of \"Muslim aggressiveness\" and the \"Hindu self-defence\" in the RSS descriptions of the incident.

Muslims, Christians and the British were thought of as \"foreign bodies\" implanted in the Hindu nation, who were able to exploit the disunity and absence of valour among the Hindus in order to subdue them. The solution lay in emulating the characteristics of these \"Threatening Others\" that were perceived to give them strength, such as paramilitary organisation, emphasis on unity and nationalism. The Hindu nationalists combined these emulatory aspects with a selective borrowing of traditions from the Hindu past to achieve a synthesis that was uniquely Indian and Hindu.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|loc=Chapter 1}}\n\n=== Hindu Mahasabha influence ===\nThe [[Hindu Mahasabha]], which was initially a special interest group within the [[Indian National Congress]] and later an independent party, was an important influence on the RSS, even though it is rarely acknowledged. In 1923, prominent Hindu leaders like [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] met together on this platform and voiced their concerns on the 'division in the Hindu community'. In his presidential speech to Mahasabha, Malaviya stated: \"Friendship could exist between equals. If the Hindus made themselves strong and the rowdy section among the Mahomedans were convinced they could not safely rob and dishonour Hindus, unity would be established on a stable basis.\" He wanted the activists 'to educate all boys and girls, establish ''akharas'' (gymnasiums), establish a volunteer corps to persuade people to comply with decisions of the Hindu Mahasabha, to accept untouchables as Hindus and grant them the right to use wells, enter temples, get an education.' Later, Hindu Mahasabha leader [[V. D. Savarkar]]'s 'Hindutva' ideology also had a profound impact on Hedgewar's thinking about the 'Hindu nation'.{{sfn|Andersen, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh: Early Concerns|1972}}\n\nThe initial meeting for the formation of the Sangh on the [[Vijaya Dashami]] day of 1925 was held between Hedgewar and four Hindu Mahasabha leaders: [[B. S. Moonje]], [[Ganesh Savarkar]], [[L. V. Paranjpe]] and B. B. Tholkar. RSS took part as a volunteer force in organising the Hindu Mahasabha annual meeting in Akola in 1931.  Moonje remained a patron of the RSS throughout his life.  Both he and Ganesh Savarkar worked to spread the RSS ''shakhas'' in Maharashtra, Panjab, Delhi, and the princely states by initiating contacts with local leaders.  Savarkar merged his own youth organisation ''Tarun Hindu Sabha'' with the RSS and helped its expansion. V. D. Savarkar, after his release in 1937, joined them in spreading the RSS and giving speeches in its support.  Officials in the Home Department called the RSS the \"volunteer organisation of the Hindu Mahasabha.\"{{sfn|Bapu|2013|pp=97\u2013100}}{{sfn|Goyal|1979|pp=59\u201376}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Indian Independence Movement===\nAfter the formation of the RSS, which portrays itself as a social movement, Hedgewar kept the organisation from having any direct affiliation with the political organisations then fighting British rule.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/655722.stm|title=RSS aims for a Hindu nation|date=10 March 2003|work=BBC News|accessdate=26 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124011631/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/655722.stm|archive-date=24 November 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> RSS rejected Gandhi's willingness to co-operate with the Muslims.{{sfn|Nussbaum, The Clash Within|2008|p=156}}{{sfn|Bhatt, Hindu Nationalism|2001|p=115}}\n\nIn accordance with Hedgewar's tradition of keeping the RSS away from the Indian Independence movement, any political activity that could be construed as being anti-British was carefully avoided.

Even an unorthodox Hindu feels himself bound at least in some matters by the rules contained in the ''Smrithis'' and he feels powerless to give up altogether his adherence to them.<ref>{{cite book|title=Undoing India the RSS Way|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQ5pO46SPk0C&pg=PA81|year=2002|publisher=Media House|isbn=978-81-7495-142-7|pages=81\u2013}}</ref>}} The RSS' opposition to, and vitriolic attacks against, the Constitution of India continued post-independence. In 1966 Golwalkar, in his book titled ''[[Bunch of Thoughts]]'' asserted:{{Quote|Our Constitution too is just a cumbersome and heterogeneous piecing together of various articles from various Constitutions of Western countries.

A Commission of Inquiry into Conspiracy to the murder of Gandhi was set, and its report was published by India's Ministry of Home Affairs in the year 1970. Accordingly, the [[Kapur Commission|Justice Kapur Commission]]<ref name=\"kapoor\">{{cite book|title=Report of Commission of Inquiry into Conspiracy to murder Mahatma Gandhi, By India (Republic).

Following his release in August 1948, Golwalkar wrote to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to lift the ban on RSS. After Nehru replied that the matter was the responsibility of the Home Minister, Golwalkar consulted Vallabhai Patel regarding the same. Patel then demanded an absolute pre-condition that the RSS adopt a formal written constitution<ref name=\"PLJ100\">{{cite book |last1=Panicker |first1=P L John |title=Gandhian approach to communalism in contemporary India |page=100 |url=https://sg.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/7178/9/09_chapter%202.pdf#page=79 |accessdate=6 November 2019}}</ref> and make it public, where Patel expected RSS to pledge its loyalty to the [[Constitution of India]], accept the Tricolor as the [[National Flag]] of India, define the power of the head of the organisation, make the organisation democratic by holding internal elections, authorisation of their parents before enrolling the pre-adolescents into the movement, and to renounce violence and secrecy.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=88, 89}}{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=14}}<ref name=\"Noorani2000\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6PnBFW7cdtsC&pg=PT42|title=The RSS and the BJP: A Division of Labour|author=Abdul Gafoor Abdul Majeed Noorani|publisher=LeftWord Books|year=2000|isbn=978-81-87496-13-7}}</ref>{{rp|42\u2013}} Golwalkar launched a huge agitation against this demand during which he was imprisoned again. Later, a constitution was drafted for RSS, which, however, initially did not meet any of Patel's demands. After a failed attempt to agitate again, eventually the RSS's constitution was amended according to Patel's wishes with the exception of the procedure for selecting the head of the organisation and the enrolment of pre-adolescents. However, the organisation's internal democracy which was written into its constitution, remained a 'dead letter'.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=89}}\n\nOn 11 July 1949 the Government of India lifted the ban on the RSS by issuing a communique stating that the decision to lift the ban on the RSS had been taken in view of the RSS leader Golwalkar's undertaking to make the group's loyalty towards the Constitution of India and acceptance and respect towards the National Flag of India more explicit in the Constitution of the RSS, which was to be worked out in a democratic manner.<ref name=\"Curran1950\"/><ref name=\"Noorani2000\" />\n\n===Decolonisation of Dadra, Nagar Haveli, and Goa===\n\nAfter India had achieved independence, the RSS was one of the socio-political organisations that supported and participated in movements to decolonise [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], which at that time was ruled by Portugal. In early 1954 volunteers Raja Wakankar and Nana Kajrekar of the RSS visited the area round about Dadra, Nagar Haveli, and Daman several times to study the topography and get acquainted with locals who wanted the area to change from being a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colony]] to being an [[States and Territories of India|Indian union territory]]. In April 1954 the RSS formed a coalition with the National Movement Liberation Organisation (NMLO) and the Azad Gomantak Dal (AGD) for the annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli into the Republic of India.<ref name=\"PurushottamShripad\">Purushottam Shripad Lele, Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present, published by Usha P. Lele, 1987</ref> On the night of 21 July, United Front of Goans, a group working independently of the coalition, captured the Portuguese police station at Dadra and declared Dadra independent. Subsequently, on 28 July, volunteer teams from the RSS and AGD captured the territories of Naroli and Phiparia and ultimately the capital of [[Silvassa]]. The Portuguese forces that had escaped and moved towards Nagar Haveli, were assaulted at Khandvel and forced to retreat until they surrendered to the Indian border police at Udava on 11 August 1954. A native administration was set up with Appasaheb Karmalkar of the NMLO as the Administrator of Dadra and Nagar Haveli on 11 August 1954.<ref name=\"PurushottamShripad\" />\n\nThe capture of Dadra and Nagar Haveli gave a boost to the movement against Portuguese colonial rule in the Indian subcontinent.<ref name=\"PurushottamShripad\"/> In 1955 RSS leaders demanded the end of Portuguese rule in Goa and its integration into India. When Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru refused to provide an armed intervention, RSS leader Jagannath Rao Joshi led the Satyagraha agitation straight into Goa. He was imprisoned with his followers by the Portuguese police. The nonviolent protests continued but met with repression. On 15 August 1955, the Portuguese police opened fire on the ''satyagrahis'', killing thirty or so civilians.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=130}}\n\nGoa was later [[Annexation of Goa|annexed into the Indian union]] in 1961 through an army operation, codenamed '[[Operation Vijay (1961)|Operation Vijay]]', that was carried out by the Nehru government.\n\n===War-time activities===\nAfter the declaration of [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 Bangladesh War of Independence]] by [[Indira Gandhi]], RSS provided support to the government, by offering its services to maintain law and order in Delhi and its volunteers were apparently the first to donate blood.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=243}}\n\n===Movement against the Emergency===\nIn 1975 the Indira Gandhi government proclaimed [[The Emergency (India)|emergency rule in India]], thereby suspending [[fundamental rights (India)|fundamental rights]] and curtailing the [[freedom of the press]].<ref name=emma>Emma Tarlo, ''Unsettling Memories: Narratives of India's \"emergency\"'', Published by Orient Blackswan, 2003, {{ISBN|81-7824-066-1}}, {{ISBN|978-81-7824-066-4}}</ref> This action was taken after the Supreme Court of India cancelled her election to the Indian Parliament on charges of [[malpractice]]s in the election.<ref name=emma/> Democratic institutions were suspended and prominent opposition leaders, including Gandhian [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], were arrested whilst thousands of people were detained without any charges taken up against them.{{sfn|Nussbaum, The Clash Within|2008}} RSS, which was seen as being close to opposition leaders, and with its large organisational base was seen to have the capability of organising protests against the government, was also banned.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=297}}\n\nDeoras, the then chief of RSS, wrote letters to Indira Gandhi, promising her to extend the organisation's co-operation in return for the lifting of the ban, asserting that RSS had no connection with the [[Bihar Movement|movement in Bihar]] and [[Navnirman Andolan|that in Gujarat]]. He tried to persuade Vinoba Bhave to mediate between the RSS and the government and also sought the offices of [[Sanjay Gandhi]], Indira Gandhi's son.{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}}{{sfn|Noorani, RSS and the BJP|2000|p=31}} Later, when there was no response, volunteers of the RSS formed underground movements against the Emergency.<ref name=\":0\" /> Literature that was censored in the media was clandestinely published and distributed on a large scale, and funds were collected for the movement.

When Golwalkar wrote to Nehru asking for the lifting of the ban on RSS after Gandhi's assassination, Nehru replied that the government had proof that RSS activities were 'anti-national' by virtue of being 'communalist'. In his letter to the heads of provincial governments in December 1947, Nehru wrote that \"we have a great deal of evidence to show that RSS is an organisation which is in the nature of a private army and which is definitely proceeding on the strictest Nazi lines, even following the techniques of the organisation\".{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=87, 88}}\n\nSardar [[Vallabhbhai Patel|Vallabhai Patel]], the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India, said in early January 1948 that the RSS activists were \"patriots who love their country\". He asked the Congressmen to 'win over' the RSS by love, instead of trying to 'crush' them. He also appealed to the RSS to join the Congress instead of opposing it. Jaffrelot says that this attitude of Patel can be partly explained by the assistance the RSS gave the Indian administration in maintaining public order in September 1947, and that his expression of 'qualified sympathy' towards RSS reflected the long-standing inclination of several Hindu traditionalists in Congress. However, after Gandhi's assassination on 30 January 1948, Patel began to view that the activities of RSS were a danger to public security.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=86-}}{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=12}} In his reply letter to Golwalkar on 11 September 1948 regarding the lifting of ban on RSS, Patel stated that though RSS did service to the Hindu society by helping and protecting the Hindus when in need during partition violence, they also began attacking Muslims with revenge and went against \"innocent men, women and children\". He said that the speeches of RSS were \"full of communal poison\", and as a result of that 'poison', he remarked, India had to lose Gandhi, noting that the RSS men had celebrated Gandhi's death. Patel was also apprehensive of the secrecy in the working manner of RSS, and complained that all of its provincial heads were Maratha Brahmins. He criticised the RSS for having its own army inside India, which he said, cannot be permitted as \"it was a potential danger to the State\". He also remarked: \"The members of RSS claimed to be the defenders of Hinduism. But they must understand that Hinduism would not be saved by rowdyism.\"{{sfn|Patel, Prasad and Rajaji: Myth of the Indian Right|2015|pp=82}}\n\n[[Rajendra Prasad]], the first President of India, did not approve of RSS. In 1948, he criticised RSS for carrying out 'loot, arson, rioting and killing of Muslims' in Delhi and other Hindu majority areas. In his letter to home minister Patel on 14 May 1948, he stated that RSS men had planned to dress up as Muslims in Hindu majority areas and attack Muslims in Muslim majority areas to create trouble. He asked Patel to take strict action against RSS for aiming to create enmity among Hindus and Muslims. He called RSS a [[Maharashtrian Brahmin]] movement, and viewed it as a secret organisation which used violence and promoted fascism, without any regard to truthful means and constitutional methods. He stated that RSS was \"definitely a menace to public peace\".{{sfn|Patel, Prasad and Rajaji: Myth of the Indian Right|2015|pp=113}}\n\nField Marshal [[K. M.

of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh as the revitalisation of the Indian value system based on universalism and peace and prosperity to all.<ref name=\"bunch\">M S Golwalkar, Bunch of Thoughts, Publishers: Sahitya Sindhu Prakashana</ref> [[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam]], the worldview that the whole world is one family, propounded by the ancient thinkers of India, is considered as one of the ideologies of the organisation.<ref name=\"sheshadri\">H. V. Seshadri, ''Hindu renaissance under way'', Published in 1984, Jagarana Prakashana, Distributors, Rashtrotthana Sahitya (Bangalore)</ref>\n\nBut the immediate focus, the leaders believe, is on the Hindu renaissance, which would build an egalitarian society and a strong India that could propound this philosophy. Hence, the focus is on social reform, economic upliftment of the downtrodden, and the protection of the cultural diversity of the natives in India.<ref name=\"sheshadri\" /> The organisation says it aspires to unite all Hindus and build a strong India that can contribute to the welfare of the world. In the words of RSS ideologue and the second head of the RSS, Golwalkar, \"in order to be able to contribute our unique knowledge to mankind, in order to be able to live and strive for the unity and welfare of the world, we stand before the world as a self-confident, resurgent and mighty nation\".<ref name=\"bunch\" />\n\nIn ''Vichardhara'' (ideology), Golwalkar affirms the RSS mission of integration as:<ref name=\"bunch\" />\n{{Quote|RSS has been making determined efforts to inculcate in our people the burning devotion for Bharat and its national ethos; kindle in them the spirit of dedication and sterling qualities and character; rouse social consciousness, mutual good-will, love and cooperation among them all; to make them realise that casts, creeds, and languages are secondary and that service to the nation is the supreme end and to mold their behaviour accordingly; instill in them a sense of true humility and discipline and train their bodies to be strong and robust so as to shoulder any social responsibility; and thus to create all-round Anushasana (Discipline) in all walks of life and build together all our people into a unified harmonious national whole, extending from Himalayas to Kanyakumari.|[[M.

The movement considers Hindus as inclusive of Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, tribals, untouchables, Veerashaivism, Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna Mission, and other groups as a community, a view similar to the inclusive referencing of the term Hindu in the Indian Constitution Article 25 (2)(b).<ref>Martin E.

K. Advani]] have complained about the RSS's interference in party politics. Though some former Hindu nationalists believed that Sangh should take part in politics, they failed to draw the RSS, which was intended to be a purely cultural movement, into the political arena until the 1950s. Savarkar tried to convince Hedgewar and later Golwalkar, to tie up with Hindu Mahasabha, but failed to do so.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\nUnder pressure from other ''swayamsevaks'', Golwalkar gradually changed his mind after independence under unusual circumstances during the ban on RSS in 1948 after the assassination of Gandhi. After the first wave of arrests of RSS activists at that time, some of its members who had gone underground recommended that their movement be involved in politics, seeing that no political force was present to advocate the cause of RSS in parliament or anywhere else. One such member who significantly suggested this cause was [[K. R. Malkani]], who wrote in 1949:{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\n{{quote|Sangh must take part in politics not only to protect itself against the greedy design of politicians, but to stop the un-Bharatiya and anti-Bharatiya policies of the Government and to advance and expedite the cause of Bharatiya through state machinery side by side with official effort in the same direction. ... Sangh must continue as it is, an ''ashram'' for the national cultural education of the entire citizenry, but it must develop a political wing for the more effective and early achievement of its ideals.}}\n\nGolwalkar approved of Malkani's and others' views regarding the formation of a new party in 1950. Jaffrelot says that the death of Sardar Patel influenced this change since Golwalkar opined that Patel could have transformed the Congress party by emphasising its affinities with Hindu nationalism, while after Patel, Nehru became strong enough to impose his 'anti-communal' line within his party. Accordingly, Golwalkar met [[Syama Prasad Mukherjee]] and agreed for endorsing senior ''swayamsevaks'', who included [[Deendayal Upadhyaya]], Balraj Madhok and [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], to the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], a newly formed political party by Mukherjee. These men, who took their orders in Nagpur, captured power in the party after Mukherjee's death.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\n[[Balasaheb Deoras]], who succeeded Golwalkar as the chief of RSS, got very much involved in politics. In 1965, when he was the general secretary of the RSS, he addressed the annual meeting of Jana Sangh, which is seen as an \"unprecedented move\" by an RSS dignitary that reflected his strong interest in politics and his will to make the movement play a larger part in the public sphere. Jaffrelot says that he exemplified the specific kind of swayamsevaks known as 'activists', giving expression to his leanings towards political activism by having the RSS support the [[Bihar Movement|JP Movement]].{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} The importance that RSS began to give to the electoral politics is demonstrated when its units (''shakhas'') were made constituency-based in the early 1970s, from which the RSS shakhas began to involve directly in elections, not only of legislatures, but also of trade unions, student and cultural organisations.{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}}\n\nAs soon as the RSS men took over the Jana Sangh party, the Hindu traditionalists who previously joined the party because of S. P. Mukherjee were sidelined.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=Your explanation here}} The organisation of the party was restructured and all its organisational secretaries, who were the pillars of the party, came from the RSS, both at the district and state level. The party also took the vision of RSS in its mission, where its ultimate objective, in the long run, was the reform of society, but not the conquest of power, since the 'state' was not viewed as a prominent institution. Hence the Jana Sangh initially remained reluctant to join any alliance that was not fully in harmony with its ideology. In 1962, Deendayal Upadhyaya, who was the party's chief, explained this approach by saying that \"coalitions were bound to degenerate into a struggle for power by opportunist elements coming together in the interest of expediency\". He wanted to build the party as an alternative party to the Congress and saw the elections as an \"opportunity to educate the people on political issues and to challenge the right of the Congress to be in power\". Jaffrelot says that this indifferent approach of party politics was in accordance with its lack of interest in the 'state' and the wish to make it weaker, or more decentralised.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} After India's defeat in the [[Sino-Indian War|1962 Sino\u2013Indian war]], the RSS and other right-wing forces in India were strengthened since the leftist and centrist opinions, sometimes even Nehru himself, could then be blamed for being 'soft' towards China. The RSS and Jana Sangh also took complete advantage of the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965 war with Pakistan]] to \"deepen suspicion about Muslims\", and also en-cashed the growing unpopularity of Congress, particularly in the [[Hindi Belt|Hindi-belt]], where a left-wing alternative was weak or non-existent.{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} The major themes on the party's agenda during this period were banning [[Cattle slaughter in India|cow slaughter]], abolishing the [[Article 370 of the Constitution of India|special status given to Jammu and Kashmir]], and legislating a [[uniform civil code]]. Explaining the Jana Sangh's failure to become a major political force despite claiming to represent the national interests of the Hindus, scholar Bruce Desmond Graham states that the party's close initial ties with the Hindi-belt and its preoccupation with the issues of North India such as promotion of Hindi, energetic resistance to Pakistan etc., had become a serious disadvantage to the party in the long run. He also adds that its interpretation of Hinduism was \"restrictive and exclusive\", arguing that \"its doctrines were inspired by an activist version of Hindu nationalism and, indirectly, by the values of [[Brahmanism]] rather than the devotional and quietist values of popular Hinduism.\"{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=253}} Desmond says that, if the Jana Sangh had carefully moderated its Hindu nationalism, it could have been able to well-exploit any strong increase in support for the traditional and nationalist Hindu opinion, and hence to compete on equal terms with the Congress in the northern states. He also remarks that if it had adopted a less harsh attitude towards Pakistan and Muslims, \"it would have been much more acceptable to Hindu traditionalists in the central and southern states, where partition had left fewer emotional scars.\"{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe Jana Sangh started making alliances by entering the anti-Congress coalitions since 1960s. It became part of the 1971 Grand Alliance and finally merged itself with the [[Janata Party]] in 1977.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} The success of Janata Party in [[1977 Indian general election|1977 elections]] made the RSS members central ministers for the first time (Vajpayee, Advani and [[Brij Lal Verma]]),{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} and provided the RSS with an opportunity to avail the state and its instruments to further its ends, through the resources of various state governments as well as the central government.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8v7Vr2iQUHkC&pg=PA240|title=India Since Independence: Making Sense of Indian Politics|last=Krishna|first=Ananth V.|publisher=Pearson Education India|year=2011|isbn=9788131734650|pages=240|language=en}}</ref> However, this merge, which was seen as a dilution of its original doctrine, was viewed by the ex-Jana Sanghis as submersion of their initial identity. Meanwhile, the other components of the Janata Party denounced the allegiance the ex-Jana Sanghis continued to pay to the RSS. This led to a 'dual membership' controversy, regarding the links the former Jana Sangh members were retaining with the RSS, and it led to the split of Janata Party in 1979.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\nThe former Jana Sangh elements formed a new party, [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), in 1980. However, BJP originated more as a successor to the Janata Party and did not return to the beginning stages of the Hindu nationalist identity and Jana Sangh doctrines. The RSS resented this dilution of ideology \u2013 the new slogans promoted by the then BJP president Vajpayee like 'Gandhian socialism' and 'positive secularism'. By early 1980s, RSS is said to have established its political strategy of \"never keeping all its eggs in one basket\". It even decided to support Congress in some states, for instance, to create the [[Hindu Munnani]] in Tamil Nadu in the backdrop of the [[1981 Meenakshipuram conversion|1981 Meenakshipuram mass conversion to Islam]], and to support one of its offshoots, [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP), to launch an enthno-religious movement on the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. BJP did not have much electoral success in its initial years and was able to win only two seats in the [[1984 Indian general election|1984 elections]]. After L. K. Advani replaced Vajpayee as party president in 1986, the BJP also began to rally around the Ayodhya campaign. In 1990, the party organised the ''[[Ram Rath Yatra]]'' to advance this campaign in large-scale.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} Advani also attacked the then ruling Congress party with the slogans such as '[[pseudo-secularism]]', accusing Congress of misusing secularism for the political appeasement of minorities, and established an explicit and unambiguous path of Hindu revival.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe 'instrumentalisation' of the Ayodhya issue and the related communal riots which polarised the electorate along religious lines helped the BJP make good progress in the subsequent elections of [[1989 Indian general election|1989]], [[1991 Indian general election|1991]] and [[1996 Indian general election|1996]]. However, in the mid-1990s, BJP adopted a more moderate approach to politics in order to make allies. As Jaffrelot remarks, it was because the party realised during then that it would not be in a position to form the government on its own in the near future. In 1998, it built a major coalition, [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA), in the Lok Sabha and succeeded in the [[1998 Indian general election|general election in 1998]], and was able to succeed again in the [[1999 Indian general election|mid-term elections of 1999]], with Vajpayee as their Prime Ministerial candidate. Though the RSS and other Sangh Parivar components appreciated some of the steps taken by the Vajpayee government, like the [[Pokhran-II|testing of a nuclear bomb]], they felt disappointed with the government's overall performance. The fact that no solid step was taken towards building the [[Rama|Ram]] temple in Ayodhya was resented by the VHP. The [[Premiership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee#Economic policy|liberalisation policy of the government]] faced objection from the [[Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh]], a trade union controlled by the RSS. Jaffrelot says, RSS and the other Sangh Parivar elements had come to the view that the \"BJP leaders had been victims of their thirst for power: they had preferred to compromise to remain in office instead of sticking to their principles.\"{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175-179}}\n\nAfter the end of Vajpayee's tenure in 2004, BJP remained as a major opposition party in the subsequent years; and again in the year 2014, the NDA came to power after BJP gained an overwhelming majority in the [[2014 Indian general election|2014 general elections]], with [[Narendra Modi]], a former RSS member who previously served as Gujarat's chief minister for three tenures, as their prime ministerial candidate.

Its head is unique to the breed and is described as being \"of one piece\" with a minimal stop and a backskull of about the same length as the muzzle. It has almond-shaped, dark brown eyes with an intelligent, friendly expression. The ears are pendant, relatively small, and lie close to the head. The occiput (the bone at the back of the skull) is not to be accentuated (as it is in setters, for example) with the head flowing smoothly into a well-arched neck. The topline is strong and straight with a well-feathered tail of moderate length held straight off the back. This breed should be well-angulated front and rear, allowing for open, effortless movement.\n[[Image:Flat Coated Retriever retrieving.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Flat-Coated Retrievers retrieve well on land or in the water.]]\n\n===Temperament===\n\nMy brother smells.........\nThe Flat-Coated Retriever is an active, multitalented bird dog with a strong desire to please people.<ref name=\"fcrsa.org\">{{cite web|url=https://fcrsa.org/the-forever-adolescent-flat-coat/|title=The Forever Adolescent Flat-Coat|website=Fcrsa.org|accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref> Exuberant, confident, and outgoing, they make a loving family pet and can be companions to small children, provided adults are nearby to direct this dog's boisterous enthusiasm.

The Flat-Coated Retriever is a slow maturing dog, as they do not reach full maturity until 3\u20135 years of age. Even then, these dogs retain their youthful, puppy-like outlook and demeanor well into old age.<ref name=\"fcrsa.org\"/> Paddy Petch, author of ''The Complete Flat-Coated Retriever'', refers to these dogs as the \"Peter Pan\" of the retriever breeds, given they never quite grow up.<ref name=\"petch\"/>\n\nThe Flat-Coated Retriever is a \"natural\" breed and enjoys partaking in \"natural\" activities such as rolling in feces, playing in mud, and digging.<ref name=\"fcrsa.org\"/> These dogs are also \"thinking\" dogs, meaning they want to please but look for a way to bend the rules.<ref name=\"fcrsa.org\"/> This characteristic helps with their hunting ability but only if they are bonded with their owner.

Part of its ancestry is thought to have come from stock imported from North America from the now extinct [[St. John's water dog]], but this is unverified. Canadian seafarers are thought to have brought [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]]s to British ports, and they factored into the ancestry of the Flat-Coated Retriever. [[Collie]]-type dogs may have been added to increase the breed's trainability along with the Newfoundland for strength and [[Setter]] blood for enhanced scenting ability. The first examples of the breed were introduced around 1860, but the final type was only established 20 years later.<ref>''The Reader's Digest Illustrated Book of Dogs'', 1982.</ref>\n\nAfter its introduction into the U.S., the Flat-Coated Retriever began to quickly gain in popularity as a gun dog, and from 1873 when the breed became a \"stable type\" according to the [[American Kennel Club]] until 1915 when it was officially recognised as a breed,<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.akc.org/breeds/flat_coated_retriever/history.cfm | title= Flat-Coated Retriever History | work= American Kennel Club | accessdate= 2007-07-08 }}</ref> \ntheir number grew rapidly. However, soon after, their popularity began to decrease, eclipsed by the [[Golden Retriever]], which was actually bred in part from the Flat-Coated Retriever, along with other breeds{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}. By the end of [[World War II]], so few Flat-Coated Retrievers remained, the breed's survival was uncertain. However, beginning in the 1960s, careful breeding brought the population back and the breed gained in popularity again, for both the [[List of dog sports|sport]] of [[conformation show]]ing, and as a companion [[pet]]. Today, the Flat-Coated Retriever enjoys a modest popularity and is moving ahead as a breed through attentive breeding for the conformation, health, multipurpose talent, and exceptional temperament that are its hallmarks. It has yet to return in substantial numbers to field competition.\n\nIn 2011, 'Sh Ch. [[Vbos The Kentuckian]]' (aka Jet), a 9.5-year-old Flat-Coated Retriever from South Queensferry, near Edinburgh, Scotland, won [[List of Best in Show winners of Crufts|Best in Show]] at [[Crufts]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/234386/Retriever-Jet-top-dog-at-Crufts/ | newspaper= [[Daily Express]] | date= 13 March 2011 | title= Retriever Jet Top Dog at Crufts}}</ref>\n''Almanza Far and Flyg'' (a.k.a.

The last UK dog to win the Gundog Group at Crufts was \"Sh Ch Gayplume Dream-maker\" in 2002. The only other Flat-Coated Retriever to win Best in Show at Crufts was 'Ch. [[Shargleam Blackcap]]' in 1980. These wins have contributed to the breed's popularity in Europe and the United Kingdom.\n\n==Health==\nRegular tests and clearances for hereditary joint conditions such as [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]], deafness, and eye conditions such as [[progressive retinal atrophy]] and [[Canine glaucoma|glaucoma]] should be conducted by breeders on any dogs used for breeding.

Its head is unique to the breed and is described as being \"of one piece\" with a minimal stop and a backskull of about the same length as the muzzle. It has almond-shaped, dark brown eyes with an intelligent, friendly expression. The ears are pendant, relatively small, and lie close to the head. The occiput (the bone at the back of the skull) is not to be accentuated (as it is in setters, for example) with the head flowing smoothly into a well-arched neck. The topline is strong and straight with a well-feathered tail of moderate length held straight off the back.

The Flat-Coated Retriever is a slow maturing dog, as they do not reach full maturity until 3\u20135 years of age. Even then, these dogs retain their youthful, puppy-like outlook and demeanor well into old age.<ref name=\"fcrsa.org\"/> Paddy Petch, author of ''The Complete Flat-Coated Retriever'', refers to these dogs as the \"Peter Pan\" of the retriever breeds, given they never quite grow up.<ref name=\"petch\"/>\n\nThe Flat-Coated Retriever is a \"natural\" breed and enjoys partaking in \"natural\" activities such as rolling in feces, playing in mud, and digging.<ref name=\"fcrsa.org\"/> These dogs are also \"thinking\" dogs, meaning they want to please but look for a way to bend the rules.<ref name=\"fcrsa.org\"/> This characteristic helps with their hunting ability but only if they are bonded with their owner.

Part of its ancestry is thought to have come from stock imported from North America from the now extinct [[St. John's water dog]], but this is unverified. Canadian seafarers are thought to have brought [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]]s to British ports, and they factored into the ancestry of the Flat-Coated Retriever. [[Collie]]-type dogs may have been added to increase the breed's trainability along with the Newfoundland for strength and [[Setter]] blood for enhanced scenting ability. The first examples of the breed were introduced around 1860, but the final type was only established 20 years later.<ref>''The Reader's Digest Illustrated Book of Dogs'', 1982.</ref>\n\nAfter its introduction into the U.S., the Flat-Coated Retriever began to quickly gain in popularity as a gun dog, and from 1873 when the breed became a \"stable type\" according to the [[American Kennel Club]] until 1915 when it was officially recognised as a breed,<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.akc.org/breeds/flat_coated_retriever/history.cfm | title= Flat-Coated Retriever History | work= American Kennel Club | accessdate= 2007-07-08 }}</ref> \ntheir number grew rapidly. However, soon after, their popularity began to decrease, eclipsed by the [[Golden Retriever]], which was actually bred in part from the Flat-Coated Retriever, along with other breeds{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}. By the end of [[World War II]], so few Flat-Coated Retrievers remained, the breed's survival was uncertain. However, beginning in the 1960s, careful breeding brought the population back and the breed gained in popularity again, for both the [[List of dog sports|sport]] of [[conformation show]]ing, and as a companion [[pet]]. Today, the Flat-Coated Retriever enjoys a modest popularity and is moving ahead as a breed through attentive breeding for the conformation, health, multipurpose talent, and exceptional temperament that are its hallmarks. It has yet to return in substantial numbers to field competition.\n\nIn 2011, 'Sh Ch. [[Vbos The Kentuckian]]' (aka Jet), a 9.5-year-old Flat-Coated Retriever from South Queensferry, near Edinburgh, Scotland, won [[List of Best in Show winners of Crufts|Best in Show]] at [[Crufts]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/234386/Retriever-Jet-top-dog-at-Crufts/ | newspaper= [[Daily Express]] | date= 13 March 2011 | title= Retriever Jet Top Dog at Crufts}}</ref>\n''Almanza Far and Flyg'' (a.k.a.

The last UK dog to win the Gundog Group at Crufts was \"Sh Ch Gayplume Dream-maker\" in 2002. The only other Flat-Coated Retriever to win Best in Show at Crufts was 'Ch. [[Shargleam Blackcap]]' in 1980. These wins have contributed to the breed's popularity in Europe and the United Kingdom.\n\n==Health==\nRegular tests and clearances for hereditary joint conditions such as [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]], deafness, and eye conditions such as [[progressive retinal atrophy]] and [[Canine glaucoma|glaucoma]] should be conducted by breeders on any dogs used for breeding.
