As cost pressures have increased, managers have turned their attention to human resources issues. In all personnel-intensive industries, workforce management has become an important strategic element in corporate management. The process has experienced growth in all sectors, including [[healthcare]]. The rise of the gig economy has also gone hand in hand with the rise of workforce management preactices.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://learn.alloc8.io/the-rise-of-the-gig-economy | title=The Rise of the Gig Economy }} </ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.openpr.com/news/363928/Global-workforce-management-software-market-in-the-healthcare-sector-to-grow-at-a-CAGR-of-13-18-percent-over-the-period-2014-2019.html |title=Global workforce management software market in the healthcare sector to grow at a CAGR of 13.18 percent over the period 2014-2019}}</ref>\n\n===Mobile workforce management===\n\nAs our society continues to adopt new technologies such as smartphones and enterprise mobility tools, more companies are allowing employees to become mobile. Mobile workforce management refers to activities used to schedule the employees working outside the company premises. It helps distribute workforce efficiently across various departments in an institution.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://beebole.com/blog/mobile-workforce-management-challenges/|title=5 challenges of mobile workforce management for 2018. 9 experts say.|date=2017-11-29|work=The Management Blog by BeeBole Timesheet|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Software==\nWorkforce management solutions{{solution-inline|date=August 2019}} can be deployed enterprise-wide and through mobile platforms. While special software is commonly used in numerous areas such as [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] ([[enterprise resource planning]]), [[Service lifecycle management|SLM]] (service lifecycle management), [[Customer relationship management|CRM]] ([[customer relationship management]]) and [[Human resources|HR]] ([[human resources]]) management, the management of the workforce is often still handled using spreadsheet programs or time recording. This often results in expensive overtime, non-productive idle times, high fluctuation rates, poor customer service and opportunity costs being incurred. By using a software solution{{solution-inline|date=August 2019}} for demand-oriented workforce management, planners can optimize staffing by creating schedules that at all times conform to the forecasted requirements. At the same time, a workforce management solution{{solution-inline|date=August 2019}} helps users to observe all relevant legislations, local agreements and the contracts of individual employees \u2013 including [[work-life balance]] guidelines.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2017/08/15/5-leadership-tips-for-digital-workforce-management/#284fe39beba8|title=5 Leadership Tips for Digital Workforce Management|last=Newman|first=Daniel|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en}}</ref>\n\nA key aspect of workforce management is scheduling. This is achieved by establishing likely demand by analyzing historical data (such as the number and duration of customer contacts, sales figures, check-out transactions or orders to be handled). Many workforce management systems also offer manual adjustment capabilities. The calculated forecast values are then converted into actual staffing requirements by means of an algorithm that is adjusted to the particular use case. The algorithm itself is based on the work of [[Agner Krarup Erlang|Erlang]] though most modern adaptations of workforce management have shifted towards a richer state management, and optimizations to the original idea.\n\nCurrent and future staffing requirements, short-term peak loads, availabilities, holidays, budget allowances, skills, labour law-related restrictions, as well as wage and contractual terms have to be integrated into the planning process to guarantee optimal staff deployment. In the workforce management process, the integration of employees is an important factor. In several workforce management systems, employees can log in their availability or planned absences and they can bid for specific shifts so long as they have the necessary skills for the activities planned for these shifts.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-workforce-management-wfm-software-075537806.html |title=Global Workforce Management (WFM) Software Market to Benefit from Rising Implementation in Smartphones}}</ref>\n\n===Delivery===\nThe three methods of delivery for contact center technologies are on-premises solution{{solution-inline|date=August 2019}}, hosted or cloud-based computing.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.techradar.com/news/internet/cloud-services/why-it-s-time-to-move-workforce-management-to-the-cloud-1278332|title=Why it's time to move workforce management to the cloud|work=TechRadar|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en}}</ref>\n\n*An on-premises system is one in which hardware and software must be physically installed, deployed and maintained at the business. All equipment is purchased up front. It is traditionally associated with large enterprises with the budget and the space to acquire the capabilities deemed necessary, and the personnel available to configure and modify systems.\n*A hosted system relies on an outside service provider. Software is purchased and installed in a data center on either physical or virtual servers that may be owned or leased by the business. Implementation is similar to an on-premises solution{{solution-inline|date=August 2019}}, but the cost is typically lower because hardware need not be purchased. However, the business must pay an initial provisioning fee as well as a monthly fee for the rental or usage of the hosting center\u2019s equipment and personnel.\n*Cloud computing converts such physical resources as processors and storage into Internet resources. By developing applications in a virtual environment, a company\u2019s computing infrastructure is treated as a utility service, and the company pays only for the time and capacity it needs. Cloud eliminates issues such as computing capacity, physical space, bandwidth and storage.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hcamag.com/features/maximising-talent-potential-224598.aspx |title=Maximising talent potential}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.genesys.com/platform-services/workforce-optimization/workforce-management |title=Optimal Workforce Management}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Medical outsourcing]]\n*[[Meeting scheduling tool]]\n*[[Project workforce management]]\n*[[Project management]]\n*[[Strategic service management]]\n*[[Time and attendance]]\n*[[Time tracking software]]\n*[[Workforce optimization]]\n*[[Employee scheduling software|Employee Scheduling Software]]\n*[[Timesheet]]\n\n==Notes==\n* AMR Research, 2006: The Human Capital Management Applications Report, 2005\u20132010<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/amr-research-releases-report-showing-human-capital-management-and-customer-management-as-fastest-growing-enterprise-application-segments-at-10-56176302.html |title=AMR Research Releases Report Showing Human Capital Management and Customer Management as Fastest-Growing Enterprise Application Segments at 10%}}</ref>\n* DMG Consulting: 2009 Contact Centre Workforce Management Market Report<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tmcnet.com/channels/bpa/articles/52686-dmg-consulting-workforce-management-market-grew-74-percent.htm |title=DMG Consulting: Workforce Management Market Grew 7.4 Percent in 2008}}</ref>\n* ''Workforce Asset Management Book of Knowledge'' (John Wiley & Sons Publishing, 2013)<ref>{{Cite book |title=Workforce Asset Management Book of Knowledge|doi=10.1002/9781118636442|year = 2013|isbn = 9781118636442}}</ref>\n* Portage Communications, LLC:<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://portagecommunications.com/a-primer-on-two-call-center-staffing-methods/ |title=Erlang Calculations Compared to Simulation Methods for Workforce Management}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Workforce Management}}\n[[Category:Business software]]\n[[Category:Human resource management]]\n", "text_old": "'''Workforce management''' ('''WFM''') is an institutional process that maximizes performance levels and competency for an organization.

As cost pressures have increased, managers have turned their attention to human resources issues. In all personnel-intensive industries, workforce management has become an important strategic element in corporate management. The process has experienced growth in all sectors, including [[healthcare]]. The rise of the gig economy has also gone hand in hand with the rise of workforce management preactices.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://learn.alloc8.io/the-rise-of-the-gig-economy | title=The Rise of the Gig Economy }} </ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.openpr.com/news/363928/Global-workforce-management-software-market-in-the-healthcare-sector-to-grow-at-a-CAGR-of-13-18-percent-over-the-period-2014-2019.html |title=Global workforce management software market in the healthcare sector to grow at a CAGR of 13.18 percent over the period 2014-2019}}</ref>\n\n===Mobile workforce management===\n\nAs our society continues to adopt new technologies such as smartphones and enterprise mobility tools, more companies are allowing employees to become mobile. Mobile workforce management refers to activities used to schedule the employees working outside the company premises. It helps distribute workforce efficiently across various departments in an institution.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://beebole.com/blog/mobile-workforce-management-challenges/|title=5 challenges of mobile workforce management for 2018. 9 experts say.|date=2017-11-29|work=The Management Blog by BeeBole Timesheet|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Software==\nWorkforce management solutions{{solution-inline|date=August 2019}} can be deployed enterprise-wide and through mobile platforms. While special software is commonly used in numerous areas such as [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] ([[enterprise resource planning]]), [[Service lifecycle management|SLM]] (service lifecycle management), [[Customer relationship management|CRM]] ([[customer relationship management]]) and [[Human resources|HR]] ([[human resources]]) management, the management of the workforce is often still handled using spreadsheet programs or time recording. This often results in expensive overtime, non-productive idle times, high fluctuation rates, poor customer service and opportunity costs being incurred. By using a software solution{{solution-inline|date=August 2019}} for demand-oriented workforce management, planners can optimize staffing by creating schedules that at all times conform to the forecasted requirements. At the same time, a workforce management solution{{solution-inline|date=August 2019}} helps users to observe all relevant legislations, local agreements and the contracts of individual employees \u2013 including [[work-life balance]] guidelines.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2017/08/15/5-leadership-tips-for-digital-workforce-management/#284fe39beba8|title=5 Leadership Tips for Digital Workforce Management|last=Newman|first=Daniel|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en}}</ref>\n\nA key aspect of workforce management is scheduling. This is achieved by establishing likely demand by analyzing historical data (such as the number and duration of customer contacts, sales figures, check-out transactions or orders to be handled). Many workforce management systems also offer manual adjustment capabilities. The calculated forecast values are then converted into actual staffing requirements by means of an algorithm that is adjusted to the particular use case. The algorithm itself is based on the work of [[Agner Krarup Erlang|Erlang]] though most modern adaptations of workforce management have shifted towards a richer state management, and optimizations to the original idea.\n\nCurrent and future staffing requirements, short-term peak loads, availabilities, holidays, budget allowances, skills, labour law-related restrictions, as well as wage and contractual terms have to be integrated into the planning process to guarantee optimal staff deployment. In the workforce management process, the integration of employees is an important factor. In several workforce management systems, employees can log in their availability or planned absences and they can bid for specific shifts so long as they have the necessary skills for the activities planned for these shifts.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-workforce-management-wfm-software-075537806.html |title=Global Workforce Management (WFM) Software Market to Benefit from Rising Implementation in Smartphones}}</ref>\n\n===Delivery===\nThe three methods of delivery for contact center technologies are on-premises solution{{solution-inline|date=August 2019}}, hosted or cloud-based computing.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.techradar.com/news/internet/cloud-services/why-it-s-time-to-move-workforce-management-to-the-cloud-1278332|title=Why it's time to move workforce management to the cloud|work=TechRadar|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en}}</ref>\n\n*An on-premises system is one in which hardware and software must be physically installed, deployed and maintained at the business. All equipment is purchased up front. It is traditionally associated with large enterprises with the budget and the space to acquire the capabilities deemed necessary, and the personnel available to configure and modify systems.\n*A hosted system relies on an outside service provider. Software is purchased and installed in a data center on either physical or virtual servers that may be owned or leased by the business. Implementation is similar to an on-premises solution{{solution-inline|date=August 2019}}, but the cost is typically lower because hardware need not be purchased. However, the business must pay an initial provisioning fee as well as a monthly fee for the rental or usage of the hosting center\u2019s equipment and personnel.\n*Cloud computing converts such physical resources as processors and storage into Internet resources. By developing applications in a virtual environment, a company\u2019s computing infrastructure is treated as a utility service, and the company pays only for the time and capacity it needs. Cloud eliminates issues such as computing capacity, physical space, bandwidth and storage.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hcamag.com/features/maximising-talent-potential-224598.aspx |title=Maximising talent potential}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.genesys.com/platform-services/workforce-optimization/workforce-management |title=Optimal Workforce Management}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Medical outsourcing]]\n*[[Meeting scheduling tool]]\n*[[Project workforce management]]\n*[[Project management]]\n*[[Strategic service management]]\n*[[Time and attendance]]\n*[[Time tracking software]]\n*[[Workforce optimization]]\n\n==Notes==\n* AMR Research, 2006: The Human Capital Management Applications Report, 2005\u20132010<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/amr-research-releases-report-showing-human-capital-management-and-customer-management-as-fastest-growing-enterprise-application-segments-at-10-56176302.html |title=AMR Research Releases Report Showing Human Capital Management and Customer Management as Fastest-Growing Enterprise Application Segments at 10%}}</ref>\n* DMG Consulting: 2009 Contact Centre Workforce Management Market Report<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tmcnet.com/channels/bpa/articles/52686-dmg-consulting-workforce-management-market-grew-74-percent.htm |title=DMG Consulting: Workforce Management Market Grew 7.4 Percent in 2008}}</ref>\n* ''Workforce Asset Management Book of Knowledge'' (John Wiley & Sons Publishing, 2013)<ref>{{Cite book |title=Workforce Asset Management Book of Knowledge|doi=10.1002/9781118636442|year = 2013|isbn = 9781118636442}}</ref>\n* Portage Communications, LLC:<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://portagecommunications.com/a-primer-on-two-call-center-staffing-methods/ |title=Erlang Calculations Compared to Simulation Methods for Workforce Management}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Workforce Management}}\n[[Category:Business software]]\n[[Category:Human resource management]]\n", "name_user": "Entire Software", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSee also", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce_management"}
