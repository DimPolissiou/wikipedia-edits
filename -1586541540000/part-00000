The team is known as ''gli Azzurri'' (the Blues). [[Savoy blue]] is the common colour of the national teams representing Italy, as it is the traditional colour of the royal [[House of Savoy]] which reigned over the [[Kingdom of Italy]] from 1860 to 1946.\n\nItaly has played international rugby since 1929, and for decades was considered one of the best European teams outside the Five Nations Championship. Since 2000, Italy has competed annually in the [[Six Nations Championship]] with [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[France national rugby union team|France]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]]. In 2013, they were holders of the [[Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy]] which is played annually between Italy and France. Italy is [[IRB World Rankings|ranked]] 14th in the world by the [[International Rugby Board|IRB]] as of 30 September 2019.\n\nItalian rugby rose to prominence in 2000 when it was added to the Five Nations, creating the Six Nations. Initially on the receiving end of some heavy defeats, the side has grown in competitiveness, recording a fourth-place finish in 2007 and 2013, and one-sided defeats have become less frequent. The Azzurri have shown respectable results when playing at home in recent years: they defeated France 22\u201321 in the [[2011 Six Nations]]; and during the [[2013 Six Nations]], they again beat France 23\u201318,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/six-nations-2013/rugby/match/133784.html|title=Rugby Union \u2013 ESPN Scrum \u2013 Italy v France at Rome|work=ESPN scrum}}</ref> also defeating [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] 22\u201315.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/six-nations-2013/rugby/match/133794.html|title=Rugby Union \u2013 ESPN Scrum \u2013 Italy v Ireland at Rome|work=ESPN scrum}}</ref> However, Italy has not won a Six Nations match since their 22\u201319 away win against Scotland in Round 3 of the 2015 tournament, losing every game since; this equates to a losing run of 22 matches.\n\nThe Italian team has also competed at every [[Rugby World Cup]] since the first tournament in [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]], where Italy played the inaugural game against New Zealand, but is yet to progress beyond the first round. The team has developed a reputation for being a consistent middle player at the tournament. Italy's results since the inception of a new group stage formula in [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003]] have consistently followed a pattern of two wins and two losses; in 2019 however, the game against New Zealand was cancelled due to [[typhoon Hagibis]].\n\nThe current head coach is [[Franco Smith]], and the captain is currently [[Number eight (rugby union)|number eight]] [[Sergio Parisse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/records/player/list_of_captains.html?id=20;type=team|title=Rugby Union \u2013 Italy \u2013 List of captains \u2013 ESPN Scrum|work=ESPN scrum}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Rugby union in Italy}}\n\n=== Early history: 1911\u201334 ===\nThe first match played by an Italian XV was in 1911 between US Milanese and Voiron of France. On 25 July of the same year the \"Propaganda Committee\" was formed which in 1928 became the Federazione Italiana Rugby (FIR) ([[Italian Rugby Federation]]).\n\nIn May 1929, Italy played their first international losing 0\u20139 against Spain in Barcelona. In 1934, Italy was one of the founder members of [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Rugby Amateur|FIRA]], today's [[Rugby Europe]]; the others were [[France national rugby union team|France]], [[Spain national rugby union team|Spain]], [[Belgium national rugby union team|Belgium]], [[Portugal national rugby union team|Portugal]],  [[Catalonia national rugby union team|Catalonia]], [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]], [[Holland national rugby union team|Holland]] and [[Germany national rugby union team|Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyeurope.eu/rugby-europe/about-us |title=About us |work=Rugby Europe |access-date=19 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120105159/http://www.rugbyeurope.eu/rugby-europe/about-us |archive-date=2017-01-20 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== 1945\u201385 ===\nWorld War II meant an hiatus for Italian rugby union, as it did in other rugby-playing nations. Post-war, there was a desire to return to normal and Italian [[rugby union]] entered a new dimension thanks to the help of Allied troops in Italy.\n\n[[File:Italy Rugby ITA - FRA 1975.jpg|thumb|Lineup of the Italy national rugby union team vs [[France national rugby union team|France]], 1975]]\nIn the 1970s and 1980s rugby union made enormous progress thanks to great foreign players ([[John Kirwan (rugby)|John Kirwan]], [[Naas Botha]], [[David Campese]], [[Michael Lynagh]]) and coaches (Julien Saby, Roy Bish, Greenwood, Nelie Smith) in the [[Top12|Italian championship]]. Even foreign coaches were and continue to be chosen for the national team, like Bertrande Fourcade and Georges Coste. In 1973, the national team went on a tour of [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]], coached by ex-Springbok prop Amos Du Plooey. Tours of England and Scotland followed, as well as games against Australia and New Zealand, the masters of their day. In 1978, Italy first played Argentina at Rovigo, winning 19\u20136.\n\n=== 1986\u201399 ===\n\nSince the mid 1980s, the Italian national side had been pursuing the ambition of playing in an expanded [[Five Nations Championship]]. Consistently winning against nations that now play in the [[European Nations Cup (Rugby Union)|European Nations Cup]] (Romania, Spain, Georgia, etc.), and good results against the major nations such as France, Scotland, Wales and Ireland meant that they were often talked as strong candidates.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IkLYDgTnMxEC&pg=RA1-PA424&lpg=RA1-PA424&dq=italy+rugby+1980s#v=onepage&q=italy%20rugby%201980s&f=false|title=Sports Around the World|work=google.ie|isbn=9781598843002|last1=Nauright|first1=John|last2=Parrish|first2=Charles|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, Italy hosted an England XV squad in Rome, drawing 15\u201315. The Azzurri took part in the first-ever Rugby World Cup match against New Zealand on 22 May 1987. The match proved a one-sided affair with New Zealand convincing 70\u20136 winners against a young Italian side. John Kirwan, later to become the Italian national coach, scored one of the tournament's greatest-ever tries for the [[All Blacks]]. Italy beat Fiji but lost to Argentina and finished third in their pool, failing to make the finals. In 1988, they played Ireland for the first time.\n\nAt the 1991 World Cup, Italy were grouped in a tough pool with the likes of England and the All Blacks. They lost both of these games but beat the USA. Italy first played Wales in 1994. At the 1995 World Cup in South Africa, Italy came close to beating England; losing 20\u201327, but recovered to beat Argentina. They finished third in their pool again below England and Western Samoa, but above the Argentines.\n\n[[File:Federazione Italiana Rugby.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The current badge on the Italy jersey]]\nThe late 1990s saw the Italians build a formidable side and record Test victories over Five Nations opposition. In 1996, a deal between [[British Sky Broadcasting]] and the [[Rugby Football Union]] meant that England home games were exclusively shown on Sky. England were threatened with being expelled from the Five Nations to be replaced by Italy. This threat was never carried out as a deal was worked out.\n\nIn 1996, Italy toured England, Wales and for the first time Scotland, losing all matches. The team recorded two consecutive victories over Ireland in 1997; 37\u201329 on 4 January, at [[Lansdowne Road]], and 37\u201322 on 20 December, in [[Bologna]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/rugby-world-cup/2011/0929/285413-rwc_blog_italy_ireland_oshea/ | work=RT\u00c9 News | title=RWC Blog: Italy's Golden Era against Ireland | date=29 September 2011}}</ref> On 22 March 1997 they recorded their first win over France, 40\u201332, (in [[Grenoble]]). In January 1998, Scotland were the victims with Italy winning 25\u201321 (in [[Treviso]]); in the same year in the Rugby World Cup Qualifiers, they narrowly lost 15\u201323 against England at Huddersfield, but they argued for a try by Alessandro Troncon disallowed by the referee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.love-rugby.com/rugby-memorabilia/rugby-Programmes/England-Italy-1998-rugby-Programmes-3407.php|title=England v Italy Rugby Programme 1998 \u2013 1998 England Italy Rugby Programme|author=Mediaclan 2010|work=love-rugby.com}}</ref>\n\nAt the 1999 World Cup, Italy were drawn with New Zealand for the third time and lost again.

Nevertheless, they won their opening game against the reigning champions [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] 34\u201320. Thereafter they struggled to compete against the other nations and their participation was called into question. The 2001 and 2002 tournaments were particularly disappointing as they did not win a single game. Coach [[Brad Johnstone]] was sacked in 2002 after an alleged show of 'player power'.\n\n[[John Kirwan (rugby)|John Kirwan]] was then appointed coach. Italy won two pool games at the 2003 World Cup, defeating both Canada and Tonga, but lost to the All Blacks and Wales.\nThey managed to win their second Six Nations game in 2003, a 30\u201322 victory over [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]], thus avoiding the [[Wooden spoon (award)#The wooden spoon in sport|wooden spoon]]. They followed up by winning two games at the World Cup, another first, though the tournament was ultimately disappointing as the Welsh gained revenge with a 27\u201315 success that meant that Italy were the only Six Nations country not to advance to the knock-out stage. Their third win came against Scotland in 2004.\n\nItaly, along with other nations, had made good use of IRB rules which allowed them to select foreign-born players if they had Italian ancestry or had lived in Italy for a qualifying period of three years. From 2004 they announced that they would only pick three such 'non-Italians' per team in order to develop their own domestic players.\n\nIn the [[2005 Six Nations]] Italy finished bottom of the table again and failed to win a single game. Kirwan was sacked and replaced with [[Pierre Berbizier]]. Italy then went on a tour of [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] where they surprised many by beating the Pumas 30\u201329 and drawing the series 1\u20131 (the only 2005 victory of a Northern Hemisphere team visiting a Southern Hemisphere team). However, the Pumas had their revenge when they visited Genoa and beat Italy 39\u201322.\n\n[[File:2012-03-17 ITA - SCO Lineout.jpg|thumb|Italy contesting a lineout with [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] during the [[2012 Six Nations]]]]\nIn the [[2006 Six Nations Championship]] the Italian team performed strongly against every team, leading against both [[England national rugby union team|England]] and France in the first half, but lost their first three games. They did, however, get a creditable 18\u201318 draw away to Wales, their first away point in the tournament, and were unlucky not to draw with Scotland in Rome in the final game, losing 10\u201313 courtesy of a late Scottish penalty.\nIn the 2007 Six Nations Championship, Italy started poorly, losing to France 3\u201339. However, Italy's performance improved, and they held England to a 20\u20137 result at Twickenham. Italy followed with a stunning start to their match at [[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]] against Scotland, scoring three quick tries to give Italy a 21\u20130 lead after seven minutes, and the ''Azzurri'' went on to a 37\u201317 victory; their first-ever away win in the Six Nations. Italy's next match was against Wales in Rome, with Italy winning 23\u201320, for their first consecutive victories in the competition and help them achieve their highest-ever position in the competition. The domestic interest in rugby reached new heights with Italy's new success front page media coverage and the sport being held up as a model of fair play.<ref name=news>{{cite web | publisher=Euro Sport | title=Italy salute Rugby heroes |url=http://www.eurosport.com/rugby/six-nations/2007/sport_sto1121056.shtml| accessdate=21 March 2007| date=2007-03-18 }}</ref> Media and public interest in the national team was very high during the side's newfound success,<ref name=\"news\"/> despite losing their last game to Ireland. 10,000 fans later greeted the national team at Rome's [[Piazza del Popolo]].<ref name=\"news\"/>\n\nThe [[2008 Six Nations Championship]] saw the Italians again finish in last place, albeit by only a three-point margin.

At the 2008 end of year tour Italy pushed the Wallabies in their clash in Padova, but the Australians eventually went on to win 30\u201320. A week later the Italians were defeated by Argentina, 14\u201322.\n\nItaly's [[2009 Six Nations Championship|2009 Six Nations]] campaign was ill-fated almost from the beginning, with both scrum-halves ruled out of the competition before a ball was kicked, and a third alternative ruled out of the opener at England due to injury. Head coach Nick Mallett tried flanker [[Mauro Bergamasco]] at scrum-half. Mallett's gamble failed in epic fashion, with Bergamasco's mistakes leading to three England tries before he was replaced at half-time; England went on to win 36\u201311.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs6nations.com/en/matchcentre/12763.php |title=England take opening victory |date=2009-02-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015122623/http://www.rbs6nations.com/en/matchcentre/12763.php |archive-date=2009-10-15 |first=Catherine |last=Goble |website=rbs6nations.com}}</ref> In week two Italy also put in a poor performance against Ireland losing 9\u201338.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs6nations.com/en/matchcentre/12903.php |title=Victory margin flatters erratic Ireland |date=2009-02-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015121657/http://www.rbs6nations.com/en/matchcentre/12903.php |archive-date=2009-10-15 |first=Rob |last=Barnett |website=rbs6nations.com}}</ref> The two poor performances were followed by another loss to Scotland.

They finished fifth in [[2003 Six Nations Championship|2003]] above Wales in the final standings, having defeated them 30\u201322, and were again fifth [[2004 Six Nations Championship|the following year]] above Scotland, after beating them 20\u201314. In [[2006 Six Nations Championship|2006]], Italy drew with Wales 18\u201318 at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in Cardiff.\n\nItaly's first three Six Nations match victories, in 2000, 2003, and 2004, had been in front of a home crowd at the [[Stadio Flaminio]] in Rome. However, on 24&nbsp;February 2007, they defeated Scotland 37\u201317 at [[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]] for their first away win in the competition. Two weeks later, they defeated Wales for the second time, 23\u201320 back in Rome. This was the first time that Italy had won two of their five games in the championship, and they finished the [[2007 Six Nations Championship]] in fourth place.\n\nItaly won the [[Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy]] for the first time in [[2011 Six Nations Championship|2011]] with a close-fought 22\u201321 victory over France. Two years later, they lifted the trophy for a second time by defeating France 23\u201318. Italy also recorded a first Six Nations victory over Ireland in [[2013 Six Nations Championship|2013]], beating them 22\u201315, and equalling their best finish of fourth place in the final standings.

Italy finished third in their pool at their first World Cup, defeating [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]], but not making the finals. They did not make the finals in [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]], grouped in a tough pool with [[England national rugby union team|England]] and the All Blacks. At the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]] in South Africa, they finished behind England and [[Samoa national rugby union team|Western Samoa]], but above [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] in their pool.\n\nIn [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999]] they did not make the finals, with their defeats by the All Blacks and [[Tonga national rugby union team|Tonga]]. Italy won two pool games at the [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003 World Cup]], defeating both [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]] and Tonga, but lost to the All Blacks and Wales.\nItaly played the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] in Pool C, against New Zealand, Scotland, Romania and Portugal (who had been beaten 83\u20130 by Italy in the qualifiers), with the goal of reaching the quarter finals for the first time. However, in the crucial group match against Scotland, Italy were undone by indiscipline. Chris Paterson kicked all of Scotland's points in an 18\u201316 victory, despite Italy crossing the line for the game's only try.\n\n=== European championships ===\n{{main|European Nations Cup (rugby union)}}\n\nBefore 2000, Italy was one of the leading European teams outside the Five Nations, along with [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]], and for a while the [[Soviet Union national rugby union team|USSR]].\n\nItaly competed in the original European Championships from 1936\u201338, but World War II meant that the tournament would not resume until 1952. Italy then competed in these tournaments from 1952\u20132000. Italy achieved only one the victory in [[1995\u201397 FIRA Trophy]].\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" width=\"450px\" style=\"border: 1px solid #aaaaaa;\"\n|-

The team is known as ''gli Azzurri'' (the Blues). [[Savoy blue]] is the common colour of the national teams representing Italy, as it is the traditional colour of the royal [[House of Savoy]] which reigned over the [[Kingdom of Italy]] from 1860 to 1946.\n\nItaly has played international rugby since 1929, and for decades was considered one of the best European teams outside the Five Nations Championship. Since 2000, Italy has competed annually in the [[Six Nations Championship]] with [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[France national rugby union team|France]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]]. In 2013, they were holders of the [[Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy]] which is played annually between Italy and France. Italy is [[IRB World Rankings|ranked]] 14th in the world by the [[International Rugby Board|IRB]] as of 30 September 2019.\n\nItalian rugby rose to prominence in 2000 when it was added to the Five Nations, creating the Six Nations. Initially on the receiving end of some heavy defeats, the side has grown in competitiveness, recording a fourth-place finish in 2007 and 2013, and one-sided defeats have become less frequent. The Azzurri have shown respectable results when playing at home in recent years: they defeated France 22\u201321 in the [[2011 Six Nations]]; and during the [[2013 Six Nations]], they again beat France 23\u201318,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/six-nations-2013/rugby/match/133784.html|title=Rugby Union \u2013 ESPN Scrum \u2013 Italy v France at Rome|work=ESPN scrum}}</ref> also defeating [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] 22\u201315.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/six-nations-2013/rugby/match/133794.html|title=Rugby Union \u2013 ESPN Scrum \u2013 Italy v Ireland at Rome|work=ESPN scrum}}</ref> However, Italy has not won a Six Nations match since their 22\u201319 away win against Scotland in Round 3 of the 2015 tournament, losing every game since; this equates to a losing run of 22 matches.\n\nThe Italian team has also competed at every [[Rugby World Cup]] since the first tournament in [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]], where Italy played the inaugural game against New Zealand, but is yet to progress beyond the first round. The team has developed a reputation for being a consistent middle player at the tournament. Italy's results since the inception of a new group stage formula in [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003]] have consistently followed a pattern of two wins and two losses; in 2019 however, the game against New Zealand was cancelled due to [[typhoon Hagibis]].\n\nThe current head coach is [[Franco Smith]], and the captain is currently [[Number eight (rugby union)|number eight]] [[Sergio Parisse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/records/player/list_of_captains.html?id=20;type=team|title=Rugby Union \u2013 Italy \u2013 List of captains \u2013 ESPN Scrum|work=ESPN scrum}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Rugby union in Italy}}\n\n=== Early history: 1911\u201334 ===\nThe first match played by an Italian XV was in 1911 between US Milanese and Voiron of France. On 25 July of the same year the \"Propaganda Committee\" was formed which in 1928 became the Federazione Italiana Rugby (FIR) ([[Italian Rugby Federation]]).\n\nIn May 1929, Italy played their first international losing 0\u20139 against Spain in Barcelona. In 1934, Italy was one of the founder members of [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Rugby Amateur|FIRA]], today's [[Rugby Europe]]; the others were [[France national rugby union team|France]], [[Spain national rugby union team|Spain]], [[Belgium national rugby union team|Belgium]], [[Portugal national rugby union team|Portugal]],  [[Catalonia national rugby union team|Catalonia]], [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]], [[Holland national rugby union team|Holland]] and [[Germany national rugby union team|Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyeurope.eu/rugby-europe/about-us |title=About us |work=Rugby Europe |access-date=19 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120105159/http://www.rugbyeurope.eu/rugby-europe/about-us |archive-date=2017-01-20 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== 1945\u201385 ===\nWorld War II meant an hiatus for Italian rugby union, as it did in other rugby-playing nations. Post-war, there was a desire to return to normal and Italian [[rugby union]] entered a new dimension thanks to the help of Allied troops in Italy.\n\n[[File:Italy Rugby ITA - FRA 1975.jpg|thumb|Lineup of the Italy national rugby union team vs [[France national rugby union team|France]], 1975]]\nIn the 1970s and 1980s rugby union made enormous progress thanks to great foreign players ([[John Kirwan (rugby)|John Kirwan]], [[Naas Botha]], [[David Campese]], [[Michael Lynagh]]) and coaches (Julien Saby, Roy Bish, Greenwood, Nelie Smith) in the [[Top12|Italian championship]]. Even foreign coaches were and continue to be chosen for the national team, like Bertrande Fourcade and Georges Coste. In 1973, the national team went on a tour of [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]], coached by ex-Springbok prop Amos Du Plooey. Tours of England and Scotland followed, as well as games against Australia and New Zealand, the masters of their day. In 1978, Italy first played Argentina at Rovigo, winning 19\u20136.\n\n=== 1986\u201399 ===\n\nSince the mid 1980s, the Italian national side had been pursuing the ambition of playing in an expanded [[Five Nations Championship]]. Consistently winning against nations that now play in the [[European Nations Cup (Rugby Union)|European Nations Cup]] (Romania, Spain, Georgia, etc.), and good results against the major nations such as France, Scotland, Wales and Ireland meant that they were often talked as strong candidates.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IkLYDgTnMxEC&pg=RA1-PA424&lpg=RA1-PA424&dq=italy+rugby+1980s#v=onepage&q=italy%20rugby%201980s&f=false|title=Sports Around the World|work=google.ie|isbn=9781598843002|last1=Nauright|first1=John|last2=Parrish|first2=Charles|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, Italy hosted an England XV squad in Rome, drawing 15\u201315. The Azzurri took part in the first-ever Rugby World Cup match against New Zealand on 22 May 1987. The match proved a one-sided affair with New Zealand convincing 70\u20136 winners against a young Italian side. John Kirwan, later to become the Italian national coach, scored one of the tournament's greatest-ever tries for the [[All Blacks]]. Italy beat Fiji but lost to Argentina and finished third in their pool, failing to make the finals. In 1988, they played Ireland for the first time.\n\nAt the 1991 World Cup, Italy were grouped in a tough pool with the likes of England and the All Blacks. They lost both of these games but beat the USA. Italy first played Wales in 1994. At the 1995 World Cup in South Africa, Italy came close to beating England; losing 20\u201327, but recovered to beat Argentina. They finished third in their pool again below England and Western Samoa, but above the Argentines.\n\n[[File:Federazione Italiana Rugby.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The current badge on the Italy jersey]]\nThe late 1990s saw the Italians build a formidable side and record Test victories over Five Nations opposition. In 1996, a deal between [[British Sky Broadcasting]] and the [[Rugby Football Union]] meant that England home games were exclusively shown on Sky. England were threatened with being expelled from the Five Nations to be replaced by Italy. This threat was never carried out as a deal was worked out.\n\nIn 1996, Italy toured England, Wales and for the first time Scotland, losing all matches. The team recorded two consecutive victories over Ireland in 1997; 37\u201329 on 4 January, at [[Lansdowne Road]], and 37\u201322 on 20 December, in [[Bologna]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/rugby-world-cup/2011/0929/285413-rwc_blog_italy_ireland_oshea/ | work=RT\u00c9 News | title=RWC Blog: Italy's Golden Era against Ireland | date=29 September 2011}}</ref> On 22 March 1997 they recorded their first win over France, 40\u201332, (in [[Grenoble]]).

Nevertheless, they won their opening game against the reigning champions [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] 34\u201320. Thereafter they struggled to compete against the other nations and their participation was called into question. The 2001 and 2002 tournaments were particularly disappointing as they did not win a single game. Coach [[Brad Johnstone]] was sacked in 2002 after an alleged show of 'player power'.\n\n[[John Kirwan (rugby)|John Kirwan]] was then appointed coach. Italy won two pool games at the 2003 World Cup, defeating both Canada and Tonga, but lost to the All Blacks and Wales.\nThey managed to win their second Six Nations game in 2003, a 30\u201322 victory over [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]], thus avoiding the [[Wooden spoon (award)#The wooden spoon in sport|wooden spoon]]. They followed up by winning two games at the World Cup, another first, though the tournament was ultimately disappointing as the Welsh gained revenge with a 27\u201315 success that meant that Italy were the only Six Nations country not to advance to the knock-out stage. Their third win came against Scotland in 2004.\n\nItaly, along with other nations, had made good use of IRB rules which allowed them to select foreign-born players if they had Italian ancestry or had lived in Italy for a qualifying period of three years. From 2004 they announced that they would only pick three such 'non-Italians' per team in order to develop their own domestic players.\n\nIn the [[2005 Six Nations]] Italy finished bottom of the table again and failed to win a single game. Kirwan was sacked and replaced with [[Pierre Berbizier]]. Italy then went on a tour of [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] where they surprised many by beating the Pumas 30\u201329 and drawing the series 1\u20131 (the only 2005 victory of a Northern Hemisphere team visiting a Southern Hemisphere team). However, the Pumas had their revenge when they visited Genoa and beat Italy 39\u201322.\n\n[[File:2012-03-17 ITA - SCO Lineout.jpg|thumb|Italy contesting a lineout with [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] during the [[2012 Six Nations]]]]\nIn the [[2006 Six Nations Championship]] the Italian team performed strongly against every team, leading against both [[England national rugby union team|England]] and France in the first half, but lost their first three games. They did, however, get a creditable 18\u201318 draw away to Wales, their first away point in the tournament, and were unlucky not to draw with Scotland in Rome in the final game, losing 10\u201313 courtesy of a late Scottish penalty.\nIn the 2007 Six Nations Championship, Italy started poorly, losing to France 3\u201339. However, Italy's performance improved, and they held England to a 20\u20137 result at Twickenham. Italy followed with a stunning start to their match at [[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]] against Scotland, scoring three quick tries to give Italy a 21\u20130 lead after seven minutes, and the ''Azzurri'' went on to a 37\u201317 victory; their first-ever away win in the Six Nations. Italy's next match was against Wales in Rome, with Italy winning 23\u201320, for their first consecutive victories in the competition and help them achieve their highest-ever position in the competition.

A week later the Italians were defeated by Argentina, 14\u201322.\n\nItaly's [[2009 Six Nations Championship|2009 Six Nations]] campaign was ill-fated almost from the beginning, with both scrum-halves ruled out of the competition before a ball was kicked, and a third alternative ruled out of the opener at England due to injury. Head coach Nick Mallett tried flanker [[Mauro Bergamasco]] at scrum-half.

They finished fifth in [[2003 Six Nations Championship|2003]] above Wales in the final standings, having defeated them 30\u201322, and were again fifth [[2004 Six Nations Championship|the following year]] above Scotland, after beating them 20\u201314. In [[2006 Six Nations Championship|2006]], Italy drew with Wales 18\u201318 at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in Cardiff.\n\nItaly's first three Six Nations match victories, in 2000, 2003, and 2004, had been in front of a home crowd at the [[Stadio Flaminio]] in Rome. However, on 24&nbsp;February 2007, they defeated Scotland 37\u201317 at [[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]] for their first away win in the competition. Two weeks later, they defeated Wales for the second time, 23\u201320 back in Rome. This was the first time that Italy had won two of their five games in the championship, and they finished the [[2007 Six Nations Championship]] in fourth place.\n\nItaly won the [[Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy]] for the first time in [[2011 Six Nations Championship|2011]] with a close-fought 22\u201321 victory over France. Two years later, they lifted the trophy for a second time by defeating France 23\u201318. Italy also recorded a first Six Nations victory over Ireland in [[2013 Six Nations Championship|2013]], beating them 22\u201315, and equalling their best finish of fourth place in the final standings. On 28&nbsp;February 2015, Italy achieved their second away win against Scotland, a tight 22\u201321 victory, but they have not won a game in the tournament since that date.\n\n{{As of|March 2019}}, Italy have won twelve Six Nations matches, seven of these against Scotland, two against both France and Wales, and one against Ireland.

Italy finished third in their pool at their first World Cup, defeating [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]], but not making the finals. They did not make the finals in [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]], grouped in a tough pool with [[England national rugby union team|England]] and the All Blacks. At the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]] in South Africa, they finished behind England and [[Samoa national rugby union team|Western Samoa]], but above [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] in their pool.\n\nIn [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999]] they did not make the finals, with their defeats by the All Blacks and [[Tonga national rugby union team|Tonga]]. Italy won two pool games at the [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003 World Cup]], defeating both [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]] and Tonga, but lost to the All Blacks and Wales.\nItaly played the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] in Pool C, against New Zealand, Scotland, Romania and Portugal (who had been beaten 83\u20130 by Italy in the qualifiers), with the goal of reaching the quarter finals for the first time. However, in the crucial group match against Scotland, Italy were undone by indiscipline.

Water is drawn from behind a dam above the Wairere Falls, which diverts the water through two penstocks to the Wairere Power Station, before being discharged back into the Mokau River. The station was commissioned in 1925 with the first generating unit. Three more generating units were added between 1938 and 1981 before a major refurbishment resulted in three of the units being replaced by a single generating unit in 2013-2014.\n\n==History==\n===Development===\n\nAfter being hired in 1903 by the Public Works Minister William Hall-Jones to investigate the hydro-electric potential of New Zealand, American electrical engineer L. M. Hancock identified 41 locations in 1904. Wairere Falls was ranked number 27.  Lawrence Birks had become the chief electrical engineer of the Public Works Department (PWD) in 1919 was familiar with the falls and was able to convince a number of residents of [[Aria, New Zealand|Aria]] and [[Piopio, New Zealand|Piopio]] that the Mokau River and Wairere Falls should be developed.<ref name=Reilly1>{{cite book |last= Reilly |first= Helen |title= Switching on the King Country: A Century of Community Achievement |location= Wellington |publisher= Steele Roberts |year= 2010 | pages= 60, 61, 89\u201392, 141, 172\u2013174, 178, 179, 219, 220 |isbn= 978-1-877448-99-7}}</ref>\n   \nAs a result, in November 1919 a group of citizens in Aria and Piopio formed a committee to undertake the work. They engaged experienced engineer Henry \"Harry\" Richmond Climie (1884-1961) of consulting engineers H.W. Clime & Son to undertake an investigation which he reported on at two meetings that were held recently at Piopio and Aria respectively. Climie estimated that a turbine capacity of 125 hp would be ample to supply present requirements within a {{convert|10|mi|km|2|abbr=on}} radius of the proposed power station and that double this amount would meet the demand for many years, provided no large industry such as a freezing or lime works required a supply. He estimated that the location had a potential total capacity of 1,500 hp<ref>{{ Citation |last = |first = |title= Wairere Falls Scheme |newspaper= King Country Chronicle |date= December 21, 1920 |url= https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/KCC19201221.2.24 |accessdate= December 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs work progressed the committee were invited by an offer in August 1922 to amalgamate their efforts with the new created Te Kuiti provisional power board. Wishing to maintain their independence and aware that they were remote from Te Kuiti they decided to continue on their own. Despite the withdraw of some of the potential customers who had initially expressed their support the Wairere Electric Power Board was established in January 1923.<ref name= Reilly1/>\n\nThe new board's first official meeting was in Piopio in May 1923, which Harry Climie attended. He was subsequently engaged to design the power station and the associated distribution system.\n\nClimie submitted his design within several weeks. Following acceptance, the board began the process of obtaining the required water, power and distribution licences, as well as polling the ratepayers in their area to raise a loan to pay for the works. Climie had estimated that the construction of the power station and associated distribution network would cost \u20a438,500 plus an additional amount to pay for the first three years of operation until sufficient customers could be connected.<ref name= Reilly1/><ref name= KCC1>{{Citation |last = |first = |title= Wairere Electric Power Board.

Taken out of service on the evening of 20 June 1939, G1 was dismantled overnight, transported up the hill from the power-house, from where all parts requiring repair were transported to Hamilton, where for the next two days it was refurbished and by the midnight on the following Tuesday last the machinery was returned to the power station and returned to service in time to carry the evening load on Thursday. While this repair was being carried out opportunity was taken install a new and more efficient stainless-steel runner, a rubber-lined submerged bearing was installed in place of the old oil circulation bearing, and improvements made to the lubrication system. These improvements lead to a 12 per cent, increase in output.<ref name= KCC3>{{Citation |last = |first = |title= Wairere Power Board: Overhaul Of Plant. Work Practically Completed.

The tailrace was deepened in order to utilise all of the available head, while the riverbed downstream from the power station was blasted to remove the rock bars which have impeded the flow of the stream below the station.<ref name= KCC4/>\n\nAssociated with the expansion of the power station the capacity of the transmission line which conveyed power from the power station to Piopio was doubled to cope with the heavy increase in consumption in this part of the Board's district.\n\nFollowing the death of the power station's operator in October 1942 the offer of his widow Isobel Gibbs to undertake his duties as a contribution to the war effort was accepted at a salary of \u20a44 10 shillings, which was 25% less than her late husbands. She worked seven days a week from 6 am to 10 pm.<ref name= Reilly1/>\nFollowing the end of the Second World War the board hired [[Lloyd Mandeno]] to about improving the power station and its connection to the system. He recommended that the board build a tie-line to connect the power station's output to the State Hydro-Electric Department's (SHD) system which would allow the board to supply its customers when the station was unable to supply all of its load as well as allowing them during periods of low load to sell any surplus generation from Wairere to the SHD. A condition of the connection to the SHD system was that the power station had to be manned 24 hours a day, which led to a second operator joining Mrs Gibbs at the power station. Upon her resignation in 1952 the board paid her a gift of \u20a420.<ref name= Reilly1/>\n\n===Installation of G3===\n\nIn August 1952 a major upgrade of the power station was completed which included the installation of an additional generating unit (G3) which had a horizontal Francis turbine driving a 825 kW Lancashire Dynamo & Crypto generator.<ref name= KCE1/>\n \nFollowing discussions that had been going on intermittently since the early 1930s the Wairere Electric Power Board merged with the Waitomo Electric Power Board in 1978 and took its name.<ref name= Reilly1/>\n\n===Installation of G4===\n\nBetween 1978 and 1981 the Wairere Power Station was upgraded at a cost of NZ$2 million and a new machine (G4) was added in 1981 which improved efficiency and maximized the use of the river flow.<ref name= Reilly1/>\n\nIn response to the introduction of the Energy Companies Act in 1992, the Waitomo Electric Power Board changed its financial structure to become Waitomo Energy Services Ltd.<ref name= Reilly1/>\n\nIn 1998 the New Zealand Government passed the Electricity Industry Reform Act which was intended to change the structure of the electricity industry to encourage competition.

Water is drawn from behind a dam above the Wairere Falls, which diverts the water through two penstocks to the Wairere Power Station, before being discharged back into the Mokau River. The station was commissioned in 1925 with the first generating unit. Three more generating units were added between 1938 and 1981 before a major refurbishment resulted in three of the units being replaced by a single generating unit in 2013-2014.\n\n==History==\n===Development===\n\nAfter being hired in 1903 by the Public Works Minister William Hall-Jones to investigate the hydro-electric potential of New Zealand, American electrical engineer L. M. Hancock identified 41 locations in 1904. Wairere Falls was ranked number 27.  Lawrence Birks had become the chief electrical engineer of the Public Works Department (PWD) in 1919 was familiar with the falls and was able to convince a number of residents of [[Aria, New Zealand | Aria]] and [[Piopio, New Zealand | Piopio]] that the Mokau River and Wairere Falls should be developed.<ref name=Reilly1>{{cite book |last= Reilly |first= Helen |title= Switching on the King Country: A Century of Community Achievement |location= Wellington |publisher= Steele Roberts |year= 2010 | pages= 60, 61, 89 - 92, 141, 172-174, 178, 179, 219, 220 |isbn= 978-1-877448-99-7}}</ref>\n   \nAs a result, in November 1919 a group of citizens in Aria and Piopio formed a committee to undertake the work. They engaged experienced engineer Henry \"Harry\" Richmond Climie (1884-1961) of consulting engineers H.W. Clime & Son to undertake an investigation which he reported on at two meetings that were held recently at Piopio and Aria respectively. Climie estimated that a turbine capacity of 125 hp would be ample to supply present requirements within a {{convert|10|mi|km|2|abbr=on}} radius of the proposed power station and that double this amount would meet the demand for many years, provided no large industry such as a freezing or lime works required a supply. He estimated that the location had a potential total capacity of 1,500 hp<ref>{{ Citation |last = |first = |title= Wairere Falls Scheme |newspaper= King Country Chronicle |date= December 21, 1920 |url= https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/KCC19201221.2.24 |accessdate= December 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs work progressed the committee were invited by an offer in August 1922 to amalgamate their efforts with the new created Te Kuiti provisional power board. Wishing to maintain their independence and aware that they were remote from Te Kuiti they decided to continue on their own. Despite the withdraw of some of the potential customers who had initially expressed their support the Wairere Electric Power Board was established in January 1923.<ref name= Reilly1/> \n\nThe new board's first official meeting was in Piopio in May 1923, which Harry Climie attended. He was subsequently engaged to design the power station and the associated distribution system.\n\nClimie submitted his design within several weeks. Following acceptance, the board began the process of obtaining the required water, power and distribution licences, as well as polling the ratepayers in their area to raise a loan to pay for the works. Climie had estimated that the construction of the power station and associated distribution network would cost \u20a438,500 plus an additional amount to pay for the first three years of operation until sufficient customers could be connected.<ref name= Reilly1/> <ref name= KCC1>{{Citation |last = |first = |title= Wairere Electric Power Board.

Taken out of service on the evening of 20 June 1939, G1 was dismantled overnight, transported up the hill from the power-house, from where all parts requiring repair were transported to Hamilton, where for the next two days it was refurbished and by the midnight on the following Tuesday last the machinery was returned to the power station and returned to service in time to carry the evening load on Thursday. While this repair was being carried out opportunity was taken install a new and more efficient stainless-steel runner, a rubber-lined submerged bearing was installed in place of the old oil circulation bearing, and improvements made to the lubrication system.

The tailrace was deepened in order to utilise all of the available head, while the riverbed downstream from the power station was blasted to remove the rock bars which have impeded the flow of the stream below the station.<ref name= KCC4/>\n\nAssociated with the expansion of the power station the capacity of the transmission line which conveyed power from the power station to Piopio was doubled to cope with the heavy increase in consumption in this part of the Board's district.\n\nFollowing the death of the power station's operator in October 1942 the offer of his widow Isobel Gibbs to undertake his duties as a contribution to the war effort was accepted at a salary of \u20a44 10 shillings, which was 25% less than her late husbands. She worked seven days a week from 6 am to 10 pm.<ref name= Reilly1/>\nFollowing the end of the Second World War the board hired [[Lloyd Mandeno]] to about improving the power station and its connection to the system. He recommended that the board build a tie-line to connect the power station's output to the State Hydro-Electric Department's (SHD) system which would allow the board to supply its customers when the station was unable to supply all of its load as well as allowing them during periods of low load to sell any surplus generation from Wairere to the SHD. A condition of the connection to the SHD system was that the power station had to be manned 24 hours a day, which led to a second operator joining Mrs Gibbs at the power station.

James Hough, also Chaplain of the East India Company, at Palamcottah, started a girls school at Nazareth in the year 1819, and in the year 1826, this school was closed due to financial constraints.\n\nThere are many Christian missionaries who have been stationed and worked at [[Nazareth, Tamil Nadu]]. In that way, Rev. Augustus Frederick Caemmerer and his wife Ann Caemmerer have contributed their part to this small village called Nazareth<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gore |first1=David |title=Faith and Family |url=https://www.britishempire.co.uk/article/faithandfamily/augustuscaemmerer.htm}}</ref>. When they began, the missionaries met with much opposition from the natives of Nazareth. In order to collect students for the new school, Ann Caemmerer went from house to house. spoke kindly to the parents, offered gifts to them and stressed the need for female education. Thus this Girls School called St. Johns Girls primary School was started in the year 1843, by Ann Caemmerer, at Nazareth. Ann Caemmerer is the daughter of Rev. Charles Mead, a LMS Missionary to Travancore. \n\nMrs. Ann Caemmerer was the first principal of this school. She died on 15th September, 1849 at the early age of 28. After the death of Ann Caemmerer, Mrs. Sarah Scarbarough took charge of the St. John's Girls' primary school, and during her time, the school was upgraded to a middle school. Later, women missionaries like Anne Brotherton, and Harriet Strachan also took control of this school one after the another<ref>{{cite book |last1=Woman's work in foreign parts |first1=The Grain of mustard seed |title=Letters for our working parties |publisher=LADIES' ASSOCIATION FOR PROMOTION OF FEMALE EDUCATION AMONG THE HEATHEN |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sy4EAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA1-PA100&dq#v=onepage&q=nazareth&f=false}}</ref>.

James Hough, also Chaplain of the East India Company, at Palamcottah, started a girls school at Nazareth in the year 1819, and in the year 1826, this school was closed due to financial constraints.\n\nThere are many christian missionaries who have been stationed and worked at [[Nazareth, Tamil Nadu]]. In that way, Rev. Augustus Frederick Caemmerer and his wife Ann Caemmerer have contributed their part to this small village called Nazareth<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gore |first1=David |title=Faith and Family |url=https://www.britishempire.co.uk/article/faithandfamily/augustuscaemmerer.htm}}</ref>. When they began, the missionaries met with much opposition from the natives of Nazareth. In order to collect students for the new school, Ann Caemmerer went from house to house. spoke kindly to the parents, offered gifts to them and stressed the need for female education. Thus this Girls School called St. Johns Girls primary School was started in the year 1843, by Ann Caemmerer, at Nazareth. Ann Caemmerer is the daughter of Rev. Charles Mead, a LMS Missionary to Travancore. \n\nMrs. Ann Caemmerer was the first principal of this school. She died on 15th September, 1849 at the early age of 28. After the death of Ann Caemmerer, Mrs. Sarah Scarbarough took charge of the St. John's Girls' primary school, and during her time, the school was upgraded to a middle school. Later, women missionaries like Anne Brotherton, and Harriet Strachan also took control of this school one after the another<ref>{{cite book |last1=Woman's work in foreign parts |first1=The Grain of mustard seed |title=Letters for our working parties |publisher=LADIES' ASSOCIATION FOR PROMOTION OF FEMALE EDUCATION AMONG THE HEATHEN |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sy4EAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA1-PA100&dq#v=onepage&q=nazareth&f=false}}</ref>. In the year 1876, Rev. [[Arthur Margoschis|Margoschis]] was made superintendent of this school.

The album was recorded using an eight-track [[ADAT]] and a [[Macintosh]] computer. Both musicians recalled that the album's making was not particularly difficult. Martin remembered: \"He [Andy] has the hearing of a bat. Things I would've just left, he had me go back and do seven, eight, nine times. He was exacting, but he wasn't cruel. He was fabulous to work with.\" Partridge similarly described the sessions as \"funny and intense. A lot of laughs were had.\"<ref name=\"Quietus\"/> On the album's songs, Newell denied that he was significant influenced by [[the Kinks]], and \"although I was pretty familiar with [[the Beach Boys]], at the time we were making the record, I'd never heard ''[[Pet Sounds]]''. Andy was incredulous when I told him and he immediately made me a cassette copy of it.\" However, by that time, the album's songs were already composed. XTC member [[Dave Gregory (musician)|Dave Gregory]] made frequent visits to the studio and was credited on the sleeve as \"Pop Mastermind\".  Partridge played most of the album's drum tracks with a Yamaha drum pad, since the shed studio was too small to reasonably hold a real full-sized drum kit.<ref name=\"Quietus\"/>\n\nThe album's title was originally planned to be ''Great New Product'' and credited to \"Martin Newell featuring the New & Improved Andy Partridge\". Humbug label owner Kevin Crace explained that \"by the time we'd finished, it had become obvious that Andy had done so much on this album that he should have some other credit besides 'producer'\". It was decided that the album should actually be called ''The Greatest Living Englishman'', but on initial pressings, the credit to a \"new and improved\" Andy Partridge was retained. He said: \"we were going to make it like a soap packet ... [I was credited] like an ingredient. And then suddenly, without me knowing it, the album title changed but for some reason they kept that credit. It made sense when the whole concept was like a soap packet, but then the title changed and it all went out the window.\"<ref name=\"Quietus\"/>\n\n==Release==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"AMrev\">{{cite web|last1=Unterberger|first1=Richie|authorlink1=Richie Unterberger|title=The Greatest Living Englishman|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-greatest-living-englishman-mw0000535804|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>\n| rev5      = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev5Score = {{rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Quietus\"/>\n}}\n''The Greatest Living Englishman'' was warmly received in the US and was met with critical acclaim in France.

Normally, his rate was \u00a33000 per song as a producer, but he agreed to take on the project anyway, provided that he receive the entirety of the budget \"and handle everything - production, engineering, mastering.\"<ref name=\"Quietus\">{{cite news|last1=Stone|first1=Aug|title=Martin Newell's The Greatest Living Englishman 25 Years On|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/24153-martin-newell-andy-partridge-interview-greatest-living-englishman-anniversary-xtc-cleaners-from-venus|work=[[The Quietus]]|date=3 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Recording==\n{{Listen |pos=left\n|filename=Greatest Living Englishman.ogg\n|title=\"The Greatest Living Englishman\"\n|description= Newell described the song as \"a tale about one of these 60s whizz kids when the class barriers broke down in the wake of [[the Beatles]] and the [[Profumo scandal]].\"<ref name=\"Quietus\"/>}}\n\nSessions lasted from January to August 1993 at Partridge's home studio shed in [[Swindon]]. The album was recorded using an eight-track [[ADAT]] and a [[Macintosh]] computer. Both musicians recalled that the album's making was not particularly difficult. Martin remembered: \"He [Andy] has the hearing of a bat. Things I would've just left, he had me go back and do seven, eight, nine times. He was exacting, but he wasn't cruel. He was fabulous to work with.\" Partridge similarly described the sessions as \"funny and intense. A lot of laughs were had.\"<ref name=\"Quietus\"/> On the album's songs, Newell denied that he was significant influenced by [[the Kinks]], and \"although I was pretty familiar with [[the Beach Boys]], at the time we were making the record, I'd never heard ''[[Pet Sounds]]''. Andy was incredulous when I told him and he immediately made me a cassette copy of it.\" However, by that time, the album's songs were already composed. XTC member [[Dave Gregory (musician)|Dave Gregory]] made frequent visits to the studio and was credited on the sleeve as \"Pop Mastermind\".  Partridge played most of the album's drum tracks with a Yamaha drum pad, since the shed studio was too small to reasonably hold a real full-sized drum kit.<ref name=\"Quietus\"/>\n\nThe album's title was originally planned to be ''Great New Product'' and credited to \"Martin Newell featuring the New & Improved Andy Partridge\". Humbug label owner Kevin Crace explained that \"by the time we'd finished, it had become obvious that Andy had done so much on this album that he should have some other credit besides 'producer'\". It was decided that the album should actually be called ''The Greatest Living Englishman'', but on initial pressings, the credit to a \"new and improved\" Andy Partridge was retained. He said: \"we were going to make it like a soap packet ... [I was credited] like an ingredient. And then suddenly, without me knowing it, the album title changed but for some reason they kept that credit. It made sense when the whole concept was like a soap packet, but then the title changed and it all went out the window.\"<ref name=\"Quietus\"/>\n\n==Release==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"AMrev\">{{cite web|last1=Unterberger|first1=Richie|authorlink1=Richie Unterberger|title=The Greatest Living Englishman|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-greatest-living-englishman-mw0000535804|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>\n| rev5      = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev5Score = {{rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Quietus\"/>\n}}\n''The Greatest Living Englishman'' was warmly received in the US and was met with critical acclaim in France.

{"title_page": "Peetre theorem", "text_new": "In [[mathematics]], the (linear) '''Peetre theorem,''' named after [[Jaak Peetre]], is a result of [[functional analysis]] that gives a characterisation of [[Differential operator|differential operator]]s in terms of their effect on generalized [[function space]]s, and without mentioning [[derivative|differentiation]] in explicit terms.  The Peetre theorem is an example of a [[finite order theorem]] in which a function or a [[functor]], defined in a very general way, can in fact be shown to be a polynomial because of some extraneous condition or symmetry imposed upon it.\n\nThis article treats two forms of the Peetre theorem.  The first is the original version which, although quite useful in its own right, is actually too general for most applications.\n\n== The original Peetre theorem ==\nLet ''M'' be a [[smooth manifold]] and let ''E'' and ''F'' be two [[vector bundles]] on ''M''.  Let\n:<math>\\Gamma^\\infty (E),\\ \\hbox{and}\\ \\Gamma^\\infty (F)</math>\nbe the spaces of [[smooth section]]s of ''E'' and ''F''.  An ''operator''\n:<math>D:\\Gamma^\\infty (E)\\rightarrow \\Gamma^\\infty(F)</math>\nis a [[sheaf (mathematics)|morphism of sheaves]] which is linear on sections such that the [[support (mathematics)|support]] of ''D'' is [[non-increasing]]: ''supp Ds'' &sube; ''supp s'' for every smooth section ''s'' of ''E''.   The original Peetre theorem asserts that, for every point ''p'' in ''M'', there is a neighborhood ''U'' of ''p'' and an integer ''k'' (depending on ''U'') such that ''D'' is a [[differential operator]] of order ''k'' over ''U''.  This means that ''D'' factors through a linear mapping ''i''<sub>''D''</sub> from the ''k''-[[jet (mathematics)|jet of sections]] of ''E'' into the space of smooth sections of ''F'':\n:<math>D=i_D\\circ j^k</math>\nwhere\n:<math>j^k:\\Gamma^\\infty E\\rightarrow J^kE</math>\nis the ''k''-jet operator and\n:<math>i_D:J^kE\\rightarrow F</math>\nis a linear mapping of vector bundles.\n\n=== Proof ===\nThe problem is invariant under local diffeomorphism, so it is sufficient to prove it when ''M'' is an open set in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> and ''E'' and ''F'' are trivial bundles.  At this point, it relies primarily on two lemmas:\n*'''Lemma 1.'''  If the hypotheses of the theorem are satisfied, then for every ''x''&isin;''M'' and ''C'' > 0, there exists a neighborhood ''V'' of ''x'' and a positive integer ''k'' such that for any ''y''&isin;''V''\\{''x''} and for any section ''s'' of ''E'' whose ''k''-jet  vanishes at ''y'' (''j<sup>k</sup>s''(''y'')=0), we have |''Ds''(''y'')|<C.\n*'''Lemma 2.'''  The first lemma is sufficient to prove the theorem.\n\nWe begin with the proof of Lemma 1.\n\n:Suppose the lemma is false.  Then there is a sequence ''x''<sub>k</sub> tending to ''x'', and a sequence of very disjoint balls ''B''<sub>k</sub> around the ''x''<sub>''k''</sub> (meaning that the geodesic distance between any two such balls is non-zero), and sections ''s''<sub>k</sub> of ''E'' over each ''B''<sub>''k''</sub> such that ''j''<sup>''k''</sup>s<sub>k</sub>(''x''<sub>''k''</sub>)=0 but |''Ds''<sub>k</sub>(''x''<sub>''k''</sub>)|&ge;C>0.\n\n:Let &rho;(''x'') denote a standard [[bump function]] for the unit ball at the origin: a smooth real-valued function which is equal to 1 on ''B''<sub>1/2</sub>(0), which vanishes to infinite order on the boundary of the unit ball.\n\n:Consider every other section ''s''<sub>''2k''</sub>.  At ''x''<sub>''2k''</sub>, these satisfy \n::''j''<sup>''2k''</sup>''s''<sub>2k</sub>(''x''<sub>''2k''</sub>)=0.\n:Suppose that ''2k'' is given.  Then, since these functions are smooth and each satisfy ''j''<sup>2k</sup>(''s''<sub>2k</sub>)(''x''<sub>2k</sub>)=0, it is possible to specify a smaller ball ''B&prime;''<sub>&delta;</sub>(''x''<sub>''2k''</sub>) such that the higher order derivatives obey the following estimate:\n::<math>\\sum_{|\\alpha|\\le k}\\ \\sup_{y\\in B'_\\delta(x_{2k})} |\\nabla^\\alpha s_k(y)|\\le \\frac{1}{M_k}\\left(\\frac{\\delta}{2}\\right)^k</math>\n:where\n::<math>M_k=\\sum_{|\\alpha|\\le k}\\sup |\\nabla^\\alpha\\rho|.</math>\n\n:Now\n::<math>\\rho_{2k}(y):=\\rho\\left(\\frac{y-x_{2k}}{\\delta}\\right)</math>\n:is a standard bump function supported in ''B&prime;''<sub>&delta;</sub>(''x''<sub>''2k''</sub>), and the derivative of the product ''s''<sub>2k</sub>&rho;<sub>2k</sub> is bounded in such a way that\n::<math>\\max_{|\\alpha|\\le k}\\ \\sup_{y\\in B'_\\delta(x_{2k})}|\\nabla^\\alpha (\\rho_{2k}s_{2k})|\\le 2^{-k}.</math>\n:As a result, because the following series and all of the partial sums of its derivatives converge uniformly\n::<math>q(y)=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\rho_{2k}(y)s_{2k}(y),</math> \n:''q''(''y'') is a smooth function on all of ''V''.\n\n:We now observe that since ''s''<sub>2k</sub> and <math>\\rho</math><sub>2k</sub>''s''<sub>2k</sub> are equal in a neighborhood of ''x''<sub>2k</sub>,\n::<math>\\lim_{k\\rightarrow\\infty}|Dq(x_{2k})|\\ge C</math>\n:So by continuity |''Dq''(''x'')|&ge; C>0.  On the other hand, \n::<math>\\lim_{k\\rightarrow\\infty}Dq(x_{2k+1})=0</math>\n:since ''Dq''(''x''<sub>2k+1</sub>)=0 because ''q'' is identically zero in ''B''<sub>2k+1</sub> and ''D'' is support non-increasing.  So ''Dq''(''x'')=0.  This is a contradiction.\n\nWe now prove Lemma 2.\n\n:First, let us dispense with the constant ''C'' from the first lemma.  We show that, under the same hypotheses as Lemma 1, |Ds(y)|=0.  Pick a ''y'' in ''V''\\{''x''} so that ''j''<sup>k</sup>''s''(y)=0 but |''Ds''(''y'')|=''g''>0.  Rescale ''s'' by a factor of 2''C''/g.  Then if ''g'' is non-zero, by the linearity of ''D'', |''Ds''(''y'')|=2''C''>''C'', which is impossible by Lemma 1.  This proves the theorem in the punctured neighborhood ''V''\\{''x''}.\n\n:Now, we must continue the differential operator to the central point ''x'' in the punctured neighborhood.  ''D'' is a linear differential operator with smooth coefficients.  Furthermore, it sends germs of smooth functions to germs of smooth functions at ''x'' as well.  Thus the coefficients of ''D'' are also smooth at ''x''.\n\n== A specialized application ==\nLet ''M'' be a [[compact (topology)|compact]] [[smooth manifold]] (possibly with [[manifold|boundary]]), and ''E'' and ''F'' be finite dimensional [[vector bundle]]s on ''M''.  Let\n\n:<math>\\Gamma^\\infty (E)</math>be the collection of [[smooth section]]s of ''E''.  An ''operator''\n\n:<math>D:\\Gamma^\\infty (E)\\rightarrow \\Gamma^\\infty (F)</math>\n\nis a smooth function (of [[Fr\u00e9chet manifold]]s) which is linear on the fibres and respects the base point on ''M'':\n\n:<math>\\pi\\circ D_p=p.</math>\n\nThe Peetre theorem asserts that for each operator ''D'', there exists an integer ''k'' such that ''D'' is a [[differential operator]] of order ''k''.   Specifically, we can decompose\n\n:<math>D=i_D\\circ j^k</math>\n\nwhere <math>i_D</math> is a mapping from the [[jet (mathematics)|jet]]s of sections of ''E'' to the bundle ''F''.  See also [[differential operator#Coordinate-independent_description|intrinsic differential operators]].\n\n== Simple Application ==\nConsider the following operator:\n\n:<math>(L f)(x_0) = \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\frac{2d}{r^2}\\frac{1}{|S_r|} \\int_{S_r} (f(x)-f(x_0)) dx</math>\n\nwhere <math> f \\in C^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^d) </math> and <math>S_r</math> is the sphere centered at <math>x_0</math> with radius <math>r</math>. This is in fact the Laplacian. We show will show <math>L</math> is a differential operator by Peetre's theorem.  \n\nLet <math> M = \\mathbb{R}^d </math> and <math>E</math> and <math>F</math> be the rank <math>1</math> trivial bundles. \n\nThen <math>\\Gamma^\\infty(E)</math> and <math>\\Gamma^\\infty(F)</math> are simply the space <math>C^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^d)</math> of smooth functions on <math>\\mathbb{R}^d</math>. As a sheaf, <math>\\mathcal{F}(U)</math> is the set of smooth functions on the open set <math>U</math> and restriction is function restriction.\n\nWe first check <math>L</math> is indeed a morphism. Let <math>U</math> and <math>V</math> be open sets such that <math>V \\subseteq U</math> and <math>u \\in C^\\infty(U)</math>. We need to check <math>(Lu)|V = L(u|V)</math>.\n\nFor <math>x \\in V</math>, since the definition of <math>(Lu)(x)</math> depends only on information on a small ball near <math>x</math>, <math>[(Lu)|V](x) = (Lu)(x) = [L(u|V)](x)</math>. The claim then follows.\n\nIt is easy to check that <math>L </math> is linear: \n\n:<math>L(f + g) = L(f) + L(g)</math> and <math>L(af) = aL(f)</math>\n\nFinally, we check that <math> L </math> is local in the sense that $supp Lu \\subseteq supp u$. If <math> x_0 \\notin supp(f) </math>, then <math> \\exists r > 0 </math> such that <math>f = 0</math> in the ball of radius  <math> r </math> centered at <math> x_0 </math>. Thus, \n\n:<math>\\int_{S_r}f(x)-f(x_0) dx = 0 \\implies (Lf)(x_0) = 0 \\implies L  </math> is a local operator.\n\nSo by Peetre's theorem, <math> L </math> is a differential operator.\n\n== References ==\n\n* Peetre, J., [http://www.mscand.dk/article.php?id=1545 ''Une caract\u00e9risation abstraite des op\u00e9rateurs diff\u00e9rentiels''], Math.
