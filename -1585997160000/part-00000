While Straczynski had to depart to get his new series ''[[Babylon 5]]'' on the air, executive producer David Moessinger remained to finish developing the series.

He was dropped from the team after he tore up his shoulder in a major game, which led to his career in the Rangers (often making references to watching the ''[[Lone Ranger]]'' and how C.D. Parker mentored him as a rookie officer). Trivette also works inside the office using computers and cellular phones to collate information of the people who have been taken into custody.\n\nWalker also works closely with (and shares a mutual attraction to) Alexandra \"Alex\" Cahill ([[Sheree J. Wilson]]), a [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant County]] Assistant District Attorney, who on occasion puts up a frown if Walker does not obtain results in time. He also gets advice on cases from C.D. Parker ([[Gailard Sartain]], pilot season; [[Noble Willingham]], Seasons 1\u20137), a veteran Ranger (later inducted into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame) who worked with Walker (and is the only character on the show to address Walker by his first name Cordell on a regular basis) until retiring to operate a small restaurant and bar called \"CD's Bar and Grill\", a restaurant widely known in the series for its chili. In Season 7, two rookie Texas Rangers, Sydney Cooke ([[Nia Peeples]]), and Francis Gage ([[Judson Mills]]), are assigned under Walker and Trivette's command.\n\nThe series was well known during its run for its [[product placement]] deal with [[Chrysler]], especially its [[Dodge]] division. After Walker used a [[Chevrolet C/K|GMC Sierra]] during the first season, he switched to the [[Dodge Ram]] (which at the start of the second season was completely redesigned for 1994), which would be advertised during commercial breaks. Other members of the cast often used other Chrysler vehicles, while villains would drive vehicles from [[General Motors]] or [[Ford Motor Company]]. This was not unlike ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', which exclusively used Ford vehicles due to a sponsorship deal with [[Andy Griffith]]. Coincidentally, the show ended just as Dodge was getting ready to redesign the Ram again for the 2002 model year. However the 2006 Dodge Ram SRT-10 was used in the movie ''Trial by Fire'', driven by Walker.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Walker, Texas Ranger episodes}}\n{{:List of Walker, Texas Ranger episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Walker Texas Ranger characters}}\n{{clear}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Name !! rowspan=\"2\"|Portrayed by !! rowspan=\"2\"|Occupation !! colspan=\"9\"|Seasons\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|Pilot\n!! style=\"width:5%;\"|1 \n!! style=\"width:5%;\"|2 \n!! style=\"width:5%;\"|3 \n!! style=\"width:5%;\"|4 \n!! style=\"width:5%;\"|5\n!! style=\"width:5%;\"|6 \n!!style=\"width:5%;\" |7 \n!! style=\"width:5%;\"|8\n|-\n|Cordell Walker || [[Chuck Norris]] || Texas Ranger<br /> || colspan=\"9\" style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\"| Main\n|-\n|James Trivette || [[Clarence Gilyard]] || Texas Ranger || colspan=\"9\" style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\"| Main\n|-\n|Alexandra Cahill || [[Sheree J.

He's one of those old-fashioned heroes who believes in justice and fights evil because his code of honor says it's the right thing to do...'Walker, Texas Ranger' is the closest thing these days to an old-time Western.

Chuck Norris, Sheree J. Wilson and Judson Mills reprised their roles, and Clarence Gilyard shot a cameo for the movie but was not featured due to the filming's conflict with a long-planned family vacation. To fill the void, Judson Mills, who was not in the original script, returned to reprise the role of Francis Gage. Nia Peeples, who played the role of Sydney Cooke for Seasons 7 and 8, was also not featured in Walker's return to prime-time television. The explanation given was that producers decided not to follow much of the original ''Walker Texas Ranger'' series, as to give the movie a fresh look. Even the show's original opening credits with the theme \"Eyes of a Ranger\" performed by Chuck Norris, was absent from the TV movie.\n\nAlthough the return of ''Walker Texas Ranger'' did not garner the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] CBS had hoped for, indications were that CBS was green-lighting future ''Walker Texas Ranger'' \"movie of the week\" projects. But as of spring 2006, both CBS and the Norris camp have been silent as to the future of the franchise, leaving many to wonder if it will return. ''Trial by Fire'' ended with Sheree J. Wilson's character the victim of a courthouse shooting, leaving many viewers to believe that there would be a follow-up movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2005/08/22/chuck-norris-returns-to-cbs-for-walker-texas-ranger-trial-by-fire-a-new-television-movie-to-be-broadcast-oct-16-on-the-cbs-television-network-19073/20050822cbs03/|title=Breaking News - Chuck Norris Returns to CBS for \"Walker, Texas Ranger: Trial by Fire,\" a New Television Movie to Be Broadcast OcT. 16 on the CBS Television Network|website=Thefutoncritic.com|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhen they announced their fall 2006 prime-time schedule, CBS said that they would no longer be producing \"Sunday Night Movie of the Week\" projects, which severely impaired any hopes of Walker's return to television in the foreseeable future.

Fricke and Padalecki are also set to [[Executive producer|executive produce]] the project alongside [[Dan Lin]] and Lindsey Libertore from their production company Rideback, as well as Dan Spilo of Industry Entertainment. [[The CW]], home of Padalecki's long-running series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', emerged as a leading contender to air the series in addition to CBS, which aired the original series. Like the original, the reboot, in which Walker would get a female partner, will explore morality, family, and rediscovering our lost common ground.

He explained since NBC had recently purchased Universal, he could now show clips from ''Walker Texas Ranger'' without having to pay any money. The joke was that he would pull a giant red lever, causing a random and comically awkward scene to play. Random scenes included Walker jumping out of a plane and punching a woman in the face, or being shot in the back while proposing, or [[Haley Joel Osment]] playing a boy who is first meeting the rest of Walker's friends, and suddenly interjects \"Walker told me I have [[AIDS]]\".

Trivette also works inside the office using computers and cellular phones to collate information of the people who have been taken into custody.\n\nWalker also works closely with (and shares a mutual attraction to) Alexandra \"Alex\" Cahill ([[Sheree J. Wilson]]), a [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant County]] Assistant District Attorney, who on occasion puts up a frown if Walker does not obtain results in time. He also gets advice on cases from C.D. Parker ([[Gailard Sartain]], pilot season; [[Noble Willingham]], Seasons 1\u20137), a veteran Ranger (later inducted into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame) who worked with Walker (and is the only character on the show to address Walker by his first name Cordell on a regular basis) until retiring to operate a small restaurant and bar called \"CD's Bar and Grill\", a restaurant widely known in the series for its chili. In Season 7, two rookie Texas Rangers, Sydney Cooke ([[Nia Peeples]]), and Francis Gage ([[Judson Mills]]), are assigned under Walker and Trivette's command.\n\nThe series was well known during its run for its [[product placement]] deal with [[Chrysler]], especially its [[Dodge]] division. After Walker used a [[Chevrolet C/K|GMC Sierra]] during the first season, he switched to the [[Dodge Ram]] (which at the start of the second season was completely redesigned for 1994), which would be advertised during commercial breaks. Other members of the cast often used other Chrysler vehicles, while villains would drive vehicles from [[General Motors]] or [[Ford Motor Company]]. This was not unlike ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', which exclusively used Ford vehicles due to a sponsorship deal with [[Andy Griffith]]. Coincidentally, the show ended just as Dodge was getting ready to redesign the Ram again for the 2002 model year. However the 2006 Dodge Ram SRT-10 was used in the movie ''Trial by Fire'', driven by Walker.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Walker, Texas Ranger episodes}}\n{{:List of Walker, Texas Ranger episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Walker Texas Ranger characters}}\n{{clear}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Name !! rowspan=\"2\"|Portrayed by !! rowspan=\"2\"|Occupation !! colspan=\"9\"|Seasons\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|Pilot\n!! style=\"width:5%;\"|1 \n!! style=\"width:5%;\"|2 \n!! style=\"width:5%;\"|3 \n!! style=\"width:5%;\"|4 \n!! style=\"width:5%;\"|5\n!! style=\"width:5%;\"|6 \n!!style=\"width:5%;\" |7 \n!! style=\"width:5%;\"|8\n|-\n|Cordell Walker || [[Chuck Norris]] || Texas Ranger<br /> || colspan=\"9\" style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\"| Main\n|-\n|James Trivette || [[Clarence Gilyard]] || Texas Ranger || colspan=\"9\" style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\"| Main\n|-\n|Alexandra Cahill || [[Sheree J.

He's one of those old-fashioned heroes who believes in justice and fights evil because his code of honor says it's the right thing to do...'Walker, Texas Ranger' is the closest thing these days to an old-time Western.

Chuck Norris, Sheree J. Wilson and Judson Mills reprised their roles, and Clarence Gilyard shot a cameo for the movie but was not featured due to the filming's conflict with a long-planned family vacation. To fill the void, Judson Mills, who was not in the original script, returned to reprise the role of Francis Gage. Nia Peeples, who played the role of Sydney Cooke for Seasons 7 and 8, was also not featured in Walker's return to prime-time television. The explanation given was that producers decided not to follow much of the original ''Walker Texas Ranger'' series, as to give the movie a fresh look. Even the show's original opening credits with the theme \"Eyes of a Ranger\" performed by Chuck Norris, was absent from the TV movie.\n\nAlthough the return of ''Walker Texas Ranger'' did not garner the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] CBS had hoped for, indications were that CBS was green-lighting future ''Walker Texas Ranger'' \"movie of the week\" projects. But as of spring 2006, both CBS and the Norris camp have been silent as to the future of the franchise, leaving many to wonder if it will return. ''Trial by Fire'' ended with Sheree J. Wilson's character the victim of a courthouse shooting, leaving many viewers to believe that there would be a follow-up movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2005/08/22/chuck-norris-returns-to-cbs-for-walker-texas-ranger-trial-by-fire-a-new-television-movie-to-be-broadcast-oct-16-on-the-cbs-television-network-19073/20050822cbs03/|title=Breaking News - Chuck Norris Returns to CBS for \"Walker, Texas Ranger: Trial by Fire,\" a New Television Movie to Be Broadcast OcT. 16 on the CBS Television Network|website=Thefutoncritic.com|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhen they announced their fall 2006 prime-time schedule, CBS said that they would no longer be producing \"Sunday Night Movie of the Week\" projects, which severely impaired any hopes of Walker's return to television in the foreseeable future.

[[The CW]], home of Padalecki's long-running series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', emerged as a leading contender to air the series in addition to CBS, which aired the original series.

Random scenes included Walker jumping out of a plane and punching a woman in the face, or being shot in the back while proposing, or [[Haley Joel Osment]] playing a boy who is first meeting the rest of Walker's friends, and suddenly interjects \"Walker told me I have [[AIDS]]\". Conan would go on to riff at the bizarre nature of the scene out of context. He did this primarily on ''[[Late Night With Conan O'Brien]]'', which prompted the show's star, [[Chuck Norris]] in character as Walker, to make a surprise guest appearance by acting out a skit in parody of the action scenes from ''Walker, Texas Ranger''.\n\n==Notable guest stars==\n{|class=wikitable\n!Actor!!Character!!Episode title!!Year\n|-\n|ROWSPAN=\"6\" |[[Marshall R.
