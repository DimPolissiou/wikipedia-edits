[[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1971, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> Banneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1971, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> Banneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

Along with the ship's primary weapons, the player also has access to three bombs: one that can make a wave of fire that starts from behind the player's ship and scrolls \"up\" the screen, one that makes a powerful circular, nova-like blast, and one that shoots several mini-missiles capable of homing in on multiple targets.

It was published in November 1992 by [[Sammy Corporation]], being their first foray into the market since the early 1980's. The game's isometric-scrolling gameplay was largely inspired by Sega's ''[[Zaxxon]]'', with its overall aesthetic taking inspiration from games like ''[[Xevious]]'' and ''[[R-Type]]''. ''Viewpoint'' ran on the [[Neo Geo MVS]] arcade system board, being Sammy's only game for it. The game's 3D graphics were drawn entirely by hand, as opposed to using pre-rendering software or 3D hardware.\n\n''Viewpoint'' also saw release on a variety of home platforms, including the [[Sega Genesis]] and [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]] game consoles, as well as the [[Sharp X68000]] and [[FM Towns]] computer platforms.

The FM Towns platform received the truest-to-arcade port, although it suffers the occasional slowdown.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| Allgame = Arcade: 17.5 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Biondich |first=Paul |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11493&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-12 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212065514/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11493&tab=review |archivedate=December 12, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> Neo Geo: 17.5 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Biondich |first=Paul |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14204&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-12 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212065516/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14204&tab=review |archivedate=December 12, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> Genesis: 11 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Michael |first=Christopher |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12531&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-11-16 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116034121/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12531&tab=review |archivedate=November 16, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> PS1: 11 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Sackenheim |first=Shawn |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=2346&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-11 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211012111/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=2346&tab=review |archivedate=December 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n| CVG = Arcade: 95%<ref name=\"CVG\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/225/385/viewpoint_review.html |title=Viewpoint arcade game review |website=Solvalou.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| EGM = Genesis: 35 / 50<ref name=\"egm65\"/> <br /> PS1: 30.5 / 40<ref name=\"egm78\"/>\n| Fam = Neo Geo: 30 / 40<ref name=\"Fam\"/>\n| GameFan = Neo Geo: 198.5 / 200<ref name=\"GameFan\"/> <br /> PS1: 233 / 300<ref>''GameFan'', volume 4, issue 1 (January 1996), page 16</ref>\n| GMaster = Neo Geo: 93%<ref>''[[GamesMaster (magazine)|GamesMaster]]'', issue 9 (September 1993), pages 62-63 (published 19 August 1993)</ref> <br /> PS1: 89%<ref name=\"GMasterPS1\">''[[GamesMaster]]'', episode 90 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwZdroNphXA&list=PL1F94E85D47458A50 series 5, episode 10]), November 23, 1995</ref>\n| Play = PS1: 74%<ref>''Play'', issue 2 (December 1995), pages 60-61 (published 16 November 1995)</ref>\n| rev1 = ''Maximum''\n| rev1Score = PS1: {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Max2\"/>\n| NGen = Genesis: {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"NGen3\"/><br />PS1: {{rating|1|5}}<ref name=\"NGen13\"/>\n| rev3 = ''{{ill|Player One (magazine)|lt=Player One|fr|Player One|vertical-align=sup}}''\n| rev3Score = Neo Geo: 97%<ref name=\"player1\"/>\n| rev4 = ''[[Sinclair User]]''\n| rev4Score = Arcade: 96%<ref name=\"Sinclair\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/157/385/viewpoint_review.html |title=Viewpoint arcade game review |website=Solvalou.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''{{ill|Video Games (magazine)|lt=Video Games|de|Video Games|vertical-align=sup}}''\n| rev5Score = Neo Geo: 84%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-12-2634.html |title=Viewpoint (Neo Geo) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref> <br /> Mega Drive: 70%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-4-746.html |title=Viewpoint (Mega Drive) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref> <br /> PS1: 70%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-10-1998.html |title=Viewpoint (PlayStation) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| award1Pub = ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''\n| award1 = Best Graphics in a Video Game<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1993\"/>\n| award2Pub = ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''\n| award2 = Best Music in a Video Game<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1993\"/>\n| award3Pub = [[GameFan|''GameFan'' Megawards]]\n| award3 = Best Shooter (Genesis)<ref>''GameFan'', volume 3, issue 1 (January 1995), pages 68-75</ref>\n}}\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nThe Neo Geo version received a positive critical reception.

The population was 11,896 as of the 2010 census. The city is named after [[Robert Fulton]], the inventor of the steamboat.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

The area on the west side of the [[Oswego River (New York)|Oswego River]] was formerly known as \"Oswego Falls\" recognizing the nearby rapids on the river. (The name  \"Oswego\" is from the Iroquois word meaning \"the outpouring.\") It was one of the first regions settled in the original [[Granby, New York|Town of Granby]]. Settlements took place in two west-side locations, the \"Upper Landing\" and the \"Lower Landing.\"  The community was incorporated as a village in 1835. In 1902, the Village of Fulton and the Village of Oswego Falls merged, and the resulting community was chartered as the City of Fulton. The two sides of the river have long been connected by two bridges-one known locally as the \"upper bridge\" (Broadway/NY State Route 3) and the other more commonly known as the \"lower bridge\" (Oneida St.) Both bridges have been rebuilt or refurbished a number of times during the history of the villages and city.\n\nOn August 6, 1931, Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]], pitching for the House of David semi-pro team, defeated the Byrne Sieberlings 5\u20133 in a game played in Fulton, NY. The contest was played before only 2,000 people. The Byrne Sieberlings, sponsored by the J. P. Byrne Tire Company, featured some of Central New York's greatest semi-pro ball players.<ref name=\"baseballhistory\">{{cite web|url=http://syracusebaseballhistory.blogspot.com/2012/01/history-of-syracuse-music-chapter-16-no.html|title=Chapter 16 - No Pro Ball, But Great Semi-Pro's, Post Standard, Herald Journal & Industrial Leagues|work=History of Syracuse Baseball|first=Ron|last=Gersbacher|date=31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe industrial nature of the small city led to a very stable workforce for many years. In fact, during the [[Great Depression]] of the early 1930s, the New York Sun newspaper (NYC) wrote a lengthy article describing Fulton, its residents and the strong local economy. It was headlined as, \"Fulton, the City the Great Depression Missed.\"\n\nIn 1942, [[Caroline Speare Rohland]] won a WPA commission to paint a [[United States Post Office (Fulton, New York)|post office mural]] for the town. ''Father LeMoyne Trying to Convert the Indians on Pathfinder Island'' was an oil on canvas depicting local Indians interacting with Europeans. The post office was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Oswego County, New York|National Register of Historic Places for Oswego County, New York]] in 1989.\n\nAt a May 2009 Common Council meeting, it was disclosed that the City of Fulton was exploring the possibility of merging with the neighboring towns of Granby and Volney to create one larger city. This idea has been floated a several times before and has yet to come to fruition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.valleynewsonline.com/viewnews.php?newsid=85917&id=1 |title=Welcome to Gran-ful-ney?

Many early Italian and Polish immigrants lived in simple wood-framed company housing and shopped at the company store during this time period. The factory-owned housing was eventually sold to the employee-occupants. Joining the woolen mills was the adjacent \"Silk Mill.\"  The American Woolen Mills closed their Fulton operations in the early 1950s. The largest buildings were demolished in the summer of 1962.  Another industry located on the west side of the river bank and using the force of the river water to power manufacturing equipment was the Foster Brothers' Knife Works, which produced [[cutlery]]. Besides Poles, the west side of the river was also settled with a sizable community of Italian immigrants as well as Czechoslovakians, Ukrainians, Syrians, and other mostly Eastern European nationalities.\n \nThe area on the east side of the Oswego River was originally a part of the [[Volney, New York|Township of Volney]]. Over time the east-side grew in industry, commerce, and residential development. In its prime, the east-side had a significant (several square blocks) downtown area (the primary retail business area was once known as \"The Dizzy Block\") with nearly one hundred stores and shops.\n\nSeveral factories were located north and the south of the downtown area along the Oswego River to make use of the rapids and fast-flowing water for power. Some of the industries located here over the years included Hunter Arms, Hunter Bicycle, Hunter Fan, Sealright-Oswego Falls Corporation (later, [[Phillips 66]] Corporation and more recently, [[Huhtam\u00e4ki]] Consumer Packaging) making paper and plastic coated packaging, Dilts, (later, Black-Clawson), a paper and plastic machine manufacturer.\n\nWhen Peter Cailer Kohler (later [[Nestl\u00e9]], S.A.) began chocolate production in the United States, Fulton became home to the first U.S. chocolate manufacturing facility. Many Swiss, skilled in the art of making chocolate, followed the company to Fulton and settled here. Many of their descendants still live in the area. However, in 2003, after more than 100 years, citing the high cost of restoring and updating the aging plant, Nestle closed the factory, leaving four hundred local employees jobless. Factory employees hung the Nestl\u00e9 company flag outside the factory upside down the day the closing was announced by company officials.\n\nSubsequent to the closing of the Nestl\u00e9 plant, investors from [[Ivory Coast]] purchased the chocolate factory and attempted to reopen it as \"New York Chocolate and Confections Company\". The company filed for bankruptcy and local Oswego County officials tried to find an appropriate buyer for the property so that it could continue to work toward a reopening. On June 30, 2010, the plant and its assets were sold.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://oswegocountytoday.com/chocolate-plant-sold-to-company-that-sells-to-others/|title=Chocolate Plant Sold To Company That Sells To Others|newspaper=Oswego County Today|first=Dave|last=Bullard|date=1 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Miller Brewing Company]] operated a plant in the Town of Volney, (just outside Fulton city limits) from the mid-1970s until its closure in 1994. The former plant was partially retrofitted and was used for a short time as an [[ethanol]] production facility with only limited production. In 2008, the owners filed for bankruptcy and on May, 2009, the facility was sold at auction to [[Sunoco]]. A retrofit was completed and the facility returned to production of [[biofuel]]s on June 21, 2010.  At full production rate, the renovated plant is able to produce in excess of 85 million gallons of fuel-grade ethanol per year, along with 400 million pounds of animal feed annually.\n\n==Government==\n\nFulton is governed by an elected mayor and common-council form of government. Administratively and politically, the city is divided into six [[Ward (country subdivision)|wards]]. City hall is located on South First Street near Academy Street and faces a small park and military memorial which overlooks the Oswego River. Fulton supports both a small professional police force and a fire department with two fire stations. The police station and the east-side fire station are included in the city hall complex.\n\n==Geography and weather==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|4.8|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|3.8|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.9|sqmi|km2}} (19.75%) is water.\n\nFulton is located near Lake Ontario and receives significant \"[[lake-effect snow]]\" fall in excess of a 100&nbsp;inches per year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://fultondailynews.com/index.php/fulton/news/what_happened_to_the_rest_of_the_snow |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050527022805/http://fultondailynews.com/index.php/fulton/news/what_happened_to_the_rest_of_the_snow |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-05-27 |title=What Happened to the Rest of the Snow? |newspaper=Fulton Daily News }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1850= 2344\n|1870= 3507\n|1880= 3941\n|1890= 4214\n|1900= 5281\n|1910= 10480\n|1920= 13043\n|1930= 12462\n|1940= 13362\n|1950= 13922\n|1960= 14261\n|1970= 14003\n|1980= 13312\n|1990= 12929\n|2000= 11855\n|2010= 11896\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=11243\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 8, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web |url=http://factfinder2.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=American FactFinder |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911234518/http://factfinder2.census.gov/ |archivedate=2013-09-11 }}</ref> of 2000, there were 11,855 people, 4,923 households, and 2,973 families residing in the city. The [[population density]] was 3,102.9 people per square mile (1,198.2/km<sup>2</sup>). There were 5,501 housing units at an average density of 1,439.8 per square mile (556.0/km<sup>2</sup>). The racial makeup of the city was 96.80% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.74% Black or [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.37% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.33% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.03% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 0.88% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.85% from two or more races.

Recreation Park, a city-owned facility on the banks of [[Lake Neatahwanta]] once hosted an amusement park, indoor skating/dancing rink as well as the county fair grounds. In its earlier years, the American Woolen Mills contributed greatly to the development and upkeep of Recreation Park. Today there are both football and softball fields, a waterfront area, pier, sheltered picnic tables, grills, and other outdoor leisure facilities. The Fulton War Memorial, a multipurpose group of buildings housing an exhibition hall/gymnasium and related ante-rooms as well as an adjacent covered arena used for ice skating and related sports in the winter and other events during warmer weather. The city-owned park adjoins the property owned by the [[Fulton City School District]] and occupied by G. Ray Bodley High School. The park facilities are sometimes used by the students for selected athletic and social events. On the northwest side of the park is a city-owned [[campground]] known as Bullhead Bay that hosts tents and recreational camper units throughout the late spring, summer and early fall. Included in the park and campground is a short hiking and conservation-nature trail. Concerts are held during the summer months featuring traditional and diverse styles of music and related entertainment. Also on the west side of the River and adjacent to the lower bridge (to the north) there is a park and athletic field complex known as Foster Park.  On the east side of the River one finds Voorhees Park, a city block bordered by South Fourth Street, South Third Street, Buffalo Street and Academy Street. Long ago a small bandstand connected by diagonal sidewalks to opposing corners of the park was located near the center of the acreage. Such bandstands were common in small rural towns. A new bandstand was erected in the \"old downtown\" area of Fulton overlooking the Oswego River and one of two locks in the \"New York State Barge Canal\" portion of the waterway. This bandstand, known as \"The Gazebo\" plays host to a variety of musical concerts in the summer season. At \"Sharp's Pond,\" Rowlee Beach is a small beach and swimming area near State Route #3 and Emery Street.\n\n==Education==\nFulton was long-known as the home of the [[Falley Seminary]], a preparatory school attended by both locals and out-of-area [[Boarding school|boarding students]]. This institution offered traditional classical education courses as well as some more practical coursework.\n\nOver the years there have been a number of public schools built in neighborhoods of Fulton and surrounding towns. These include Fulton High School and its descendant institution, G. Ray Bodley High School, Fulton Junior High School, Fourth Street School (in the former Fulton High School building), Fairgreve School, James Lanigan Elementary School, Erie Street School, State Street School, Oak Street School, Phillips Street School, Pine Woods School, Walradt Street School, and Granby Elementary School. For many years there were also two Catholic schools: St. Mary's School (also known as Fulton Catholic School) on the east side and Holy Family School on the west side of town.\n\nA branch of [[Cayuga Community College]] (CCC) is located in the retrofitted shell of a grocery store and other former retail spaces.\n\n==Business==\nSpring 2008, a [[Wal-Mart#Walmart Supercenter|Wal-Mart Supercenter]] opened just outside the Fulton city limits in [[Granby, New York|Granby]]. Construction of the store was temporarily halted in early 2007 after the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]] refused access to the area to preserve nesting [[bald eagle]]s during the spring mating season.\n\n==Media==\nRadio station [[WBBS|B104.7]], which is currently the top ranked radio outlet in Central New York,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} is licensed to Fulton. A local newspaper known as \"The Valley News\" is published in Fulton twice each week. An electronic media publication, the \"Oswego County Today\" also maintains a publication office in Fulton.\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Carlton W.

The area on the west side of the [[Oswego River (New York)|Oswego River]] was formerly known as \"Oswego Falls\" recognizing the nearby rapids on the river. (The name  \"Oswego\" is from the Iroquois word meaning \"the outpouring.\") It was one of the first regions settled in the original [[Granby, New York|Town of Granby]]. Settlements took place in two west-side locations, the \"Upper Landing\" and the \"Lower Landing.\"  The community was incorporated as a village in 1835. In 1902, the Village of Fulton and the Village of Oswego Falls merged, and the resulting community was chartered as the City of Fulton. The two sides of the river have long been connected by two bridges-one known locally as the \"upper bridge\" (Broadway/NY State Route 3) and the other more commonly known as the \"lower bridge\" (Oneida St.) Both bridges have been rebuilt or refurbished a number of times during the history of the villages and city.\n\nOn August 6, 1931, Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]], pitching for the House of David semi-pro team, defeated the Byrne Sieberlings 5-3 in a game played in Fulton, NY. The contest was played before only 2,000 people. The Byrne Sieberlings, sponsored by the J. P. Byrne Tire Company, featured some of Central New York's greatest semi-pro ball players.<ref name=\"baseballhistory\">{{cite web|url=http://syracusebaseballhistory.blogspot.com/2012/01/history-of-syracuse-music-chapter-16-no.html|title=Chapter 16 - No Pro Ball, But Great Semi-Pro's, Post Standard, Herald Journal & Industrial Leagues|work=History of Syracuse Baseball|first=Ron|last=Gersbacher|date=31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe industrial nature of the small city led to a very stable workforce for many years. In fact, during the [[Great Depression]] of the early 1930s, the New York Sun newspaper (NYC) wrote a lengthy article describing Fulton, its residents and the strong local economy. It was headlined as, \"Fulton, the City the Great Depression Missed.\"\n\nIn 1942, [[Caroline Speare Rohland]] won a WPA commission to paint a [[United States Post Office (Fulton, New York)|post office mural]] for the town. ''Father LeMoyne Trying to Convert the Indians on Pathfinder Island'' was an oil on canvas depicting local Indians interacting with Europeans. The post office was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Oswego County, New York|National Register of Historic Places for Oswego County, New York]] in 1989.\n\nAt a May 2009 Common Council meeting, it was disclosed that the City of Fulton was exploring the possibility of merging with the neighboring towns of Granby and Volney to create one larger city. This idea has been floated a several times before and has yet to come to fruition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.valleynewsonline.com/viewnews.php?newsid=85917&id=1 |title=Welcome to Gran-ful-ney?

Many early Italian and Polish immigrants lived in simple wood-framed company housing and shopped at the company store during this time period. The factory-owned housing was eventually sold to the employee-occupants. Joining the woolen mills was the adjacent \"Silk Mill.\"  The American Woolen Mills closed their Fulton operations in the early 1950s. The largest buildings were demolished in the summer of 1962.  Another industry located on the west side of the river bank and using the force of the river water to power manufacturing equipment was the Foster Brothers' Knife Works, which produced [[cutlery]]. Besides Poles, the west side of the river was also settled with a sizable community of Italian immigrants as well as Czechoslovakians, Ukrainians, Syrians, and other mostly Eastern European nationalities.\n \nThe area on the east side of the Oswego River was originally a part of the [[Volney, New York|Township of Volney]]. Over time the east-side grew in industry, commerce, and residential development. In its prime, the east-side had a significant (several square blocks) downtown area (the primary retail business area was once known as \"The Dizzy Block\") with nearly one hundred stores and shops.\n\nSeveral factories were located north and the south of the downtown area along the Oswego River to make use of the rapids and fast-flowing water for power. Some of the industries located here over the years included Hunter Arms, Hunter Bicycle, Hunter Fan, Sealright-Oswego Falls Corporation (later, [[Phillips 66]] Corporation and more recently, [[Huhtam\u00e4ki]] Consumer Packaging) making paper and plastic coated packaging, Dilts, (later, Black-Clawson), a paper and plastic machine manufacturer.\n\nWhen Peter Cailer Kohler (later [[Nestl\u00e9]], S.A.) began chocolate production in the United States, Fulton became home to the first U.S. chocolate manufacturing facility. Many Swiss, skilled in the art of making chocolate, followed the company to Fulton and settled here. Many of their descendants still live in the area. However, in 2003, after more than 100 years, citing the high cost of restoring and updating the aging plant, Nestle closed the factory, leaving four hundred local employees jobless. Factory employees hung the Nestl\u00e9 company flag outside the factory upside down the day the closing was announced by company officials.\n\nSubsequent to the closing of the Nestl\u00e9 plant, investors from [[Ivory Coast]] purchased the chocolate factory and attempted to reopen it as \"New York Chocolate and Confections Company\". The company filed for bankruptcy and local Oswego County officials tried to find an appropriate buyer for the property so that it could continue to work toward a reopening. On June 30, 2010, the plant and its assets were sold.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://oswegocountytoday.com/chocolate-plant-sold-to-company-that-sells-to-others/|title=Chocolate Plant Sold To Company That Sells To Others|newspaper=Oswego County Today|first=Dave|last=Bullard|date=1 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Miller Brewing Company]] operated a plant in the Town of Volney, (just outside Fulton city limits) from the mid-1970s until its closure in 1994. The former plant was partially retrofitted and was used for a short time as an [[ethanol]] production facility with only limited production. In 2008, the owners filed for bankruptcy and on May, 2009, the facility was sold at auction to [[Sunoco]]. A retrofit was completed and the facility returned to production of [[biofuel]]s on June 21, 2010.  At full production rate, the renovated plant is able to produce in excess of 85 million gallons of fuel-grade ethanol per year, along with 400 million pounds of animal feed annually.\n\n==Government==\n\nFulton is governed by an elected mayor and common-council form of government. Administratively and politically, the city is divided into six [[Ward (country subdivision)|wards]]. City hall is located on South First Street near Academy Street and faces a small park and military memorial which overlooks the Oswego River. Fulton supports both a small professional police force and a fire department with two fire stations. The police station and the east-side fire station are included in the city hall complex.\n\n==Geography and weather==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|4.8|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|3.8|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.9|sqmi|km2}} (19.75%) is water.\n\nFulton is located near Lake Ontario and receives significant \"[[lake-effect snow]]\" fall in excess of a 100&nbsp;inches per year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://fultondailynews.com/index.php/fulton/news/what_happened_to_the_rest_of_the_snow |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050527022805/http://fultondailynews.com/index.php/fulton/news/what_happened_to_the_rest_of_the_snow |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-05-27 |title=What Happened to the Rest of the Snow? |newspaper=Fulton Daily News }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1850= 2344\n|1870= 3507\n|1880= 3941\n|1890= 4214\n|1900= 5281\n|1910= 10480\n|1920= 13043\n|1930= 12462\n|1940= 13362\n|1950= 13922\n|1960= 14261\n|1970= 14003\n|1980= 13312\n|1990= 12929\n|2000= 11855\n|2010= 11896\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=11243\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 8, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web |url=http://factfinder2.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=American FactFinder |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911234518/http://factfinder2.census.gov/ |archivedate=2013-09-11 }}</ref> of 2000, there were 11,855 people, 4,923 households, and 2,973 families residing in the city.

Recreation Park, a city-owned facility on the banks of [[Lake Neatahwanta]] once hosted an amusement park, indoor skating/dancing rink as well as the county fair grounds. In its earlier years, the American Woolen Mills contributed greatly to the development and upkeep of Recreation Park. Today there are both football and softball fields, a waterfront area, pier, sheltered picnic tables, grills, and other outdoor leisure facilities. The Fulton War Memorial, a multipurpose group of buildings housing an exhibition hall/gymnasium and related ante-rooms as well as an adjacent covered arena used for ice skating and related sports in the winter and other events during warmer weather. The city-owned park adjoins the property owned by the [[Fulton City School District]] and occupied by G. Ray Bodley High School. The park facilities are sometimes used by the students for selected athletic and social events. On the northwest side of the park is a city-owned [[campground]] known as Bullhead Bay that hosts tents and recreational camper units throughout the late spring, summer and early fall. Included in the park and campground is a short hiking and conservation-nature trail. Concerts are held during the summer months featuring traditional and diverse styles of music and related entertainment. Also on the west side of the River and adjacent to the lower bridge (to the north) there is a park and athletic field complex known as Foster Park.  On the east side of the River one finds Voorhees Park, a city block bordered by South Fourth Street, South Third Street, Buffalo Street and Academy Street. Long ago a small bandstand connected by diagonal sidewalks to opposing corners of the park was located near the center of the acreage. Such bandstands were common in small rural towns. A new bandstand was erected in the \"old downtown\" area of Fulton overlooking the Oswego River and one of two locks in the \"New York State Barge Canal\" portion of the waterway. This bandstand, known as \"The Gazebo\" plays host to a variety of musical concerts in the summer season. At \"Sharp's Pond,\" Rowlee Beach is a small beach and swimming area near State Route #3 and Emery Street.\n\n==Education==\nFulton was long-known as the home of the [[Falley Seminary]], a preparatory school attended by both locals and out-of-area [[Boarding school|boarding students]]. This institution offered traditional classical education courses as well as some more practical coursework.\n\nOver the years there have been a number of public schools built in neighborhoods of Fulton and surrounding towns. These include Fulton High School and its descendant institution, G. Ray Bodley High School, Fulton Junior High School, Fourth Street School (in the former Fulton High School building), Fairgreve School, James Lanigan Elementary School, Erie Street School, State Street School, Oak Street School, Phillips Street School, Pine Woods School, Walradt Street School, and Granby Elementary School. For many years there were also two Catholic schools: St. Mary's School (also known as Fulton Catholic School) on the east side and Holy Family School on the west side of town.\n\nA branch of [[Cayuga Community College]] (CCC) is located in the retrofitted shell of a grocery store and other former retail spaces.\n\n==Business==\nSpring 2008, a [[Wal-Mart#Walmart Supercenter|Wal-Mart Supercenter]] opened just outside the Fulton city limits in [[Granby, New York|Granby]]. Construction of the store was temporarily halted in early 2007 after the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]] refused access to the area to preserve nesting [[bald eagle]]s during the spring mating season.\n\n==Media==\nRadio station [[WBBS|B104.7]], which is currently the top ranked radio outlet in Central New York,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} is licensed to Fulton. A local newspaper known as \"The Valley News\" is published in Fulton twice each week. An electronic media publication, the \"Oswego County Today\" also maintains a publication office in Fulton.\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Carlton W.

On the [[Army Combat Uniform]], the tabs are worn above a unit's [[Shoulder Sleeve Insignia (United States Army)|shoulder patch]] and are used to identify a unit's or a soldier's special skill(s) or are worn on shoulder patches as part of a unit's unique heritage. Individual tabs are also worn as small metal arches above or below [[Awards and decorations of the United States Army|medals or ribbons]] on the [[Army Service Uniform]].\n\nTabs are valued uniquely in the U.S. Army because images rather than words are traditionally used for the [[symbol]]ism of the shoulder patch worn to identify a soldier's unit. It is only to identify an individual soldier's or a whole unit's special skill that an additional shoulder patch is worn that uses words rather than images to symbolize this skill. For example, while any member of a special forces unit will wear the unit identifying patch that includes an arrowhead, sword, lightning, and Airborne Tab, only soldiers who have completed special forces training will have been awarded and wear an additional tab containing the words \"SPECIAL FORCES\" (i.e. the Special Forces Tab).\n\nSome tabs are awarded to recognize an individual soldier's combat related skills or marksmanship and are worn by a soldier permanently. These tabs are also considered [[Badges of the United States Army|special skill badges]] and have metal equivalents that are worn on the soldier's chest if their uniform does not have a place for shoulder patches (e.g. the Army Service Uniform). Other tabs recognize a whole unit's special skill and are considered to be part of a specific unit's shoulder sleeve patch and are worn by a soldier only while they belong to that unit.<ref>[http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Tab/Tabs.htm Pentagon.mil]</ref> The Jungle Expert Tab is unique in that while it is awarded to recognize an individual soldier's skill, it is only worn by soldiers while they belong to certain units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmedals.com/detail.aspx?ID=5717|title=USmedals.com|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref> Similarly, tabs awarded at the state level by the U.S. Army National Guard can only be worn by soldiers while they are on state-level orders.\n\n==Individual tabs==\nThere are currently four permanent individual skill/marksmanship tabs authorized for wear by the U.S. Army. In order of precedence, they are the [[Special Forces Tab]], the [[Ranger Tab]], the [[Sapper Tab]], and the [[President's Hundred Tab]].

The Special Forces Tab can be revoked by the Chain of Command for significant violations of conduct considered contrary to the high standards expected of a Special Forces soldier (for example, DUI or other forms of misconduct).\n\nThe Special Forces Tab was created in 1983 and is an embroidered quadrant patch worn on the upper left sleeve of a military uniform.

On the [[Army Combat Uniform]], the tabs are worn above a unit's [[Shoulder Sleeve Insignia (United States Army)|shoulder patch]] and are used to identify a unit's or a soldier's special skill(s) or are worn on shoulder patches as part of a unit's unique heritage. Individual tabs are also worn as small metal arches above or below [[Awards and decorations of the United States Army|medals or ribbons]] on the [[Army Service Uniform]].\n\nTabs are valued uniquely in the U.S. Army because images rather than words are traditionally used for the [[symbol]]ism of the shoulder patch worn to identify a soldier's unit. It is only to identify an individual soldier's or a whole unit's special skill that an additional shoulder patch is worn that uses words rather than images to symbolize this skill. For example, while any member of a special forces unit will wear the unit identifying patch that includes an arrowhead, sword, lightning, and Airborne Tab, only soldiers who have completed special forces training will have been awarded and wear an additional tab containing the words \"SPECIAL FORCES\" (i.e. the Special Forces Tab).\n\nSome tabs are awarded to recognize an individual soldier's combat related skills or marksmanship and are worn by a soldier permanently. These tabs are also considered [[Badges of the United States Army|special skill badges]] and have metal equivalents that are worn on the soldier's chest if their uniform does not have a place for shoulder patches (e.g. the Army Service Uniform). Other tabs recognize a whole unit's special skill and are considered to be part of a specific unit's shoulder sleeve patch and are worn by a soldier only while they belong to that unit.<ref>[http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Tab/Tabs.htm Pentagon.mil]</ref> The Jungle Expert Tab is unique in that while it is awarded to recognize an individual soldier's skill, it is only worn by soldiers while they belong to certain units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmedals.com/detail.aspx?ID=5717|title=USmedals.com|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref> Similarly, tabs awarded at the state level by the U.S. Army National Guard can only be worn by soldiers while they are on state-level orders.\n\n==Individual tabs==\nThere are currently four permanent individual skill/marksmanship tabs authorized for wear by the U.S. Army.
