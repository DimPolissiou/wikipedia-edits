It was attacked in 1863 ([[Toland's Raid]]) and 1865 ([[Stoneman's 1865 Raid]]).  The town is the birthplace of [[Edith Wilson|Edith Bolling Wilson]], second wife of President [[Woodrow Wilson]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Historical Collections of Virginia - Wytheville.jpg|thumb|left|Wytheville {{Circa|1845}}]]\nWythe County was created in 1789 and named for [[George Wythe]], the \"father of American Jurisprudence\" and signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. In May 1790, Chris Simmerman donated 90 acres, along with John Davis's 10 acres, to establish a town and county seat. Robert Adams completed a town survey in November of that year, dividing the area into half-acre lots. The town did not have an official name yet, but was generally known as Wythe Court House.<ref name=\"wch\"/>\n\nTwo years later, in October 1792, the town was officially named Evansham, for prominent local citizen Jesse Evans. After a disastrous fire in March 1839, the town was renamed Wytheville. At that time, it was home to about 500 residents.<ref name=\"wch\">{{cite web | url=http://www.wythecogha.org/pages/home.php | title=Wythe County History | publisher=Wythe County Genealogical and Historical Association | accessdate=April 28, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Lynching of Raymond Bird===\n{{Main|Killing of Raymond Bird}}\nAfter the Reconstruction era, the majority-white community joined the rest of the state in reasserting white supremacy and [[Jim Crow]] rules, which lasted long into the 20th century. In 1926 the last [[Lynchings in the United States|lynching]] in Virginia took place here, when [[Killing of Raymond Bird|Raymond Bird]], an African-American man, was taken from jail by a large group of white men, after being arrested for having sex with a white woman. He was shot, dragged miles behind a truck, and his dead body hanged from a tree on a county road. He had first been accused of raping Minnie Grubb, daughter of his employer, but she insisted their relationship was consensual and bore his daughter.<ref name=\"smith\">[https://books.google.com/books/about/Managing_White_Supremacy.html?id=dQ2bRvKy2pkC J.

The event provoked outrage and national coverage by newspapers.<ref name=\"newsleader\"/>\n\nBird's death was a catalyst for Virginia's passing an anti-lynching law in 1928, largely because of a campaign led by [[Louis I. Jaff\u00e9]], editor of the ''[[Norfolk Virginian-Pilot]]''. It was supported by Governor [[Harry Flood Byrd Sr.]], who linked the bill to his efforts to attract new businesses to the state.<ref name=\"newsleader\">[https://www.newsleader.com/story/news/local/2016/05/16/shameful-chapter-virginia-history-lynchings/84470508/ Sterling Giles, \"Shameful chapter in Virginia history: Lynchings\"], ''News-Leader'', May 16, 2016; Accessed March 15, 2018</ref><ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\n===Polio epidemic===\nA few cases of [[poliomyelitis|polio]] during the summer of 1950 swelled into an epidemic of hundreds.

In May 1790, Chris Simmerman donated 90 acres, along with John Davis's 10 acres, to establish a town and county seat. Robert Adams completed a town survey in November of that year, dividing the area into half-acre lots. The town did not have an official name yet, but was generally known as Wythe Court House.<ref name=\"wch\"/>\n\nTwo years later, in October 1792, the town was officially named Evansham, for prominent local citizen Jesse Evans. After a disastrous fire in March 1839, the town was renamed Wytheville. At that time, it was home to about 500 residents.<ref name=\"wch\">{{cite web | url=http://www.wythecogha.org/pages/home.php | title=Wythe County History | publisher=Wythe County Genealogical and Historical Association | accessdate=April 28, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Lynching of Raymond Bird===\n{{Main|Killing of Raymond Bird}}\nAfter the Reconstruction era, the majority-white community joined the rest of the state in reasserting white supremacy and [[Jim Crow]] rules, which lasted long into the 20th century. In 1926 the last [[Lynchings in the United States|lynching]] in Virginia took place here, when [[Killing of Raymond Bird|Raymond Bird]], an African-American man, was taken from jail by a large group of white men, after being arrested for having sex with a white woman. He was shot, dragged miles behind a truck, and his dead body hanged from a tree on a county road.

The event provoked outrage and national coverage by newspapers.<ref name=\"newsleader\"/>\n\nBird's death was a catalyst for Virginia's passing an anti-lynching law in 1928, largely because of a campaign led by [[Louis I.

It formed part of the [[South African Infantry Corps|South African Army Infantry Formation]] as well as the South African Territorial Reserve.\n\n==History==\n===Origin===\nOil was the one major raw material not available in South Africa except synthetically from coal. This priority resource was therefore placed under a high degree of control by the government, which expected to meet 50% of its oil needs from the SASOL program. The South African Coal Oil and Gas Corporation was a state controlled company. Three large plants were developed and eventually considered National Key Points.\n\n===The first industrial Commando===\nThe SASOL Commando was formed from workers from the refinery to protect these installations as they were already trained in the safety protocols and how to handle the inherent dangers involved.\n\nThese members had been originally part of the [[Heilbron Commando]] but were released on 14 February 1962 to form this first industrial commando. An industrial commando was specifically tasked to primarily protect sensitive installations. By 1974 a few other industrial commandos had been formed as well.\n\n===Relationship with other Commandos===\nThe SASOL Commando's first permanent HQ was opened in May 1975. They worked closely with [[Regiment Sasolburg]] on external threats to the refinery.<ref>http://dspace.nwu.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10394/14075/Fourie_SM_Chapter6.pdf?sequence=7</ref>\n\n===Freedom of the City===\nFreedom of the City of [[Sasolburg]] was awarded to the unit in August 1979.\n\n===Attacks on the refinery and response===\nIn June 1980, the SASOL plants were targeted by the ANC's MK, which resulted in the National Key Points Act being strengthened. Other companies considered critical could now be required to host commandos, would be given military training and be integrated into regional military plans. The attack on SASOL 1 itself resulted in a scaling up of activities of this unit.\n\nCombined with the Sasolburg Commando, it had become the largest commando (battalion size) in the 1980s.\n\n===Change of Command===\nThe unit was brought under the command of [[Group 17]] in January 1981 so that it could assist in the protection of industries of the [[Vaal Triangle]].\nThe SASOL Commando was finally transferred to [[Group 24]] at [[Kroonstad]].\n\n[[File:SADF SASOL Commando Higher Commands.png|thumb|center|200px|SADF SASOL Commando Higher Commands]]\n\n===Disbandment===\nThis unit, along with all other [[South African Commando System|Commando units]] was disbanded after a decision by South African President [[Thabo Mbeki]] to disband all Commando Units.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.issafrica.org/Pubs/ASR/6No2/VanStade.html |title=Rationalisation in the SANDF: The Next Challenge |accessdate=5 March 2015 |year=1997 |author=Col L B van Stade, Senior Staff Officer Rationalisation, SANDF |publisher=Institute for Security Studies |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316204323/https://issafrica.org/pubs/asr/6no2/vanstade.html |archivedate=16 March 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saps.gov.za/statistics/reports/rural_safety/eng/pages/no2e.htm|title=About the Commando system|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref> The Commando system was phased out between 2003 and 2008 \"because of the role it played in the apartheid era\", according to the [[Minister of Police (South Africa)|Minister of Safety and Security]] [[Charles Nqakula]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=de Lange|first1=Deon|title=South Africa: Commandos Were 'Hostile to New SA'|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200805290408.html|work=Cape Argus|accessdate=5 March 2015|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n==Leadership ==\n{{Empty Section|date=March 2015}}\n<!--\t\nPlease use these templates to added leadership information.

It formed part of the [[South African Infantry Corps|South African Army Infantry Formation]] as well as the South African Territorial Reserve.\n\n==History==\n===Origin===\nOil was the one major raw material not available in South Africa except synthetically from coal. This priority resource was therefor placed under a high degree of control by the government, which expected to meet 50% of its oil needs from the SASOL program. The South African Coal Oil and Gas Corporation was a state controlled company. Three large plants were developed and eventually considered National Key Points.\n\n===The first industrial Commando===\nThe SASOL Commando was formed from workers from the refinery to protect these installations as they were already trained in the safety protocols and how to handle the inherent dangers involved.\n\nThese members had been originally part of the [[Heilbron Commando]] but were released on 14 February 1962 to form this first industrial commando. An industrial commando was specifically tasked to primarily protect sensitive installations. By 1974 a few other industrial commandos had been formed as well.\n\n===Relationship with other Commandos===\nThe SASOL Commando's first permanent HQ was opened in May 1975. They worked closely with [[Regiment Sasolburg]] on external threats to the refinery.<ref>http://dspace.nwu.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10394/14075/Fourie_SM_Chapter6.pdf?sequence=7</ref>\n\n===Freedom of the City===\nFreedom of the City of [[Sasolburg]] was awarded to the unit in August 1979.\n\n===Attacks on the refinery and response===\nIn June 1980, the SASOL plants were targeted by the ANC's MK, which resulted in the National Key Points Act being strengthened. Other companies considered critical could now be required to host commandos, would be given military training and be integrated into regional military plans. The attack on SASOL 1 itself resulted in a scaling up of activities of this unit.\n\nCombined with the Sasolburg Commando, it had become the largest commando (battalion size) in the 1980s.\n\n===Change of Command===\nThe unit was brought under the command of [[Group 17]] in January 1981 so that it could assist in the protection of industries of the [[Vaal Triangle]].\nThe SASOL Commando was finally transferred to [[Group 24]] at [[Kroonstad]].\n\n[[File:SADF SASOL Commando Higher Commands.png|thumb|center|200px|SADF SASOL Commando Higher Commands]]\n\n===Disbandment===\nThis unit, along with all other [[South African Commando System|Commando units]] was disbanded after a decision by South African President [[Thabo Mbeki]] to disband all Commando Units.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.issafrica.org/Pubs/ASR/6No2/VanStade.html |title=Rationalisation in the SANDF: The Next Challenge |accessdate=5 March 2015 |year=1997 |author=Col L B van Stade, Senior Staff Officer Rationalisation, SANDF |publisher=Institute for Security Studies |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316204323/https://issafrica.org/pubs/asr/6no2/vanstade.html |archivedate=16 March 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saps.gov.za/statistics/reports/rural_safety/eng/pages/no2e.htm|title=About the Commando system|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref> The Commando system was phased out between 2003 and 2008 \"because of the role it played in the apartheid era\", according to the [[Minister of Police (South Africa)|Minister of Safety and Security]] [[Charles Nqakula]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=de Lange|first1=Deon|title=South Africa: Commandos Were 'Hostile to New SA'|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200805290408.html|work=Cape Argus|accessdate=5 March 2015|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n==Leadership ==\n{{Empty Section|date=March 2015}}\n<!--\t\nPlease use these templates to added leadership information.

There are two primary competing hypotheses. One is that \"everything is everywhere, but the environment selects,\" meaning [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] factors pose the only constraints, through [[natural selection]], to which microbes colonize what [[Ecology#Physical environments|environments]]. This is called the [[Niche (ecology)|niche]] hypothesis, and its counterpart is the hypothesis that neutral processes, such as distance and geographic barriers to [[Dispersal (ecology)|dispersal]], control microbial community assembly when [[Taxon|taxa]] are equally [[Biological fitness|fit]] within an environment. In this hypothesis, differences between individual taxa in modes and reach of dispersal explain the differences in microbial communities of different environments.<ref name=\"Nemergut\"/> Most likely, both natural selection and neutral processes affect microbial community assembly, though certain microbial taxa may be more restricted by one process or the other depending on their physiological restrictions and mode of dispersion.<ref name=\"Nemergut\"/>\n\nMicrobial dispersal mechanisms include wind, water, and hitchhiking on more mobile macrobes. Microbial dispersion is difficult to study, and little is known about its effect on microbial community assembly relative to the effect of abiotic and biotic assembly mechanisms,<ref name=\"Nemergut\"/> particularly in roots. For this reason only assembly mechanisms that fit within the niche hypothesis are discussed below.\n\nThe taxa within root microbial communities seem to be drawn from the surrounding soil, though the relative abundance of various taxa may differ greatly from those found in bulk soil due to unique [[Niche (ecology)|niches]] in the root and rhizosphere.<ref name=\"Buee\"/>\n\n===Biotic assembly mechanisms===\nDifferent parts of the root are associated with different microbial communities.

There are two primary competing hypotheses. One is that \"everything is everywhere, but the environment selects,\" meaning [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] factors pose the only constraints, through [[natural selection]], to which microbes colonize what [[Ecology#Physical environments|environments]]. This is called the [[Niche (ecology)|niche]] hypothesis, and its counterpart is the hypothesis that neutral processes, such as distance and geographic barriers to [[Dispersal (ecology)|dispersal]], control microbial community assembly when [[Taxon|taxa]] are equally [[Biological fitness|fit]] within an environment. In this hypothesis, differences between individual taxa in modes and reach of dispersal explain the differences in microbial communities of different environments.<ref name=\"Nemergut\"/> Most likely, both natural selection and neutral processes affect microbial community assembly, though certain microbial taxa may be more restricted by one process or the other depending on their physiological restrictions and mode of dispersion.<ref name=\"Nemergut\"/>\n\nMicrobial dispersal mechanisms include wind, water, and hitchhiking on more mobile macrobes. Microbial dispersion is difficult to study, and little is known about its effect on microbial community assembly relative to the effect of abiotic and biotic assembly mechanisms,<ref name=\"Nemergut\"/> particularly in roots. For this reason only assembly mechanisms that fit within the niche hypothesis are discussed below.\n\nThe taxa within root microbial communities seem to be drawn from the surrounding soil, though the relative abundance of various taxa may differ greatly from those found in bulk soil due to unique [[Niche (ecology)|niches]] in the root and rhizosphere.<ref name=\"Buee\"/>\n\n===Biotic assembly mechanisms===\nDifferent parts of the root are associated with different microbial communities. For example, fine roots, root tips, and the main root are all associated with different communities,<ref name=\"Buee\"/><ref name=\"Marchner\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Marschner P, Yang CH, Lieberei R, Crowley DE |year=2001 |title=Soil and plant specific effects on bacterial community composition in the rhizosphere |journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry |volume=33 |issue=11 |pages=1437\u201345 |doi=10.1016/S0038-0717(01)00052-9}}</ref> and the rhizosphere, root surface, and root tissue are all associated with different communities,<ref name =\"Gottel\"/><ref name=\"Nguyen\"/> likely due to the unique chemistry and nutrient status of each of these regions.

As in [[Macroecology|macroecological]] systems, the historical trajectory of the microbiotic community may partially determine the present and future community. Due to antagonistic and mutualistic interactions between microbial taxa, the taxa colonizing a root at any given moment could be expected to influence which new taxa are acquired, and therefor how the community responds to changes in the host or environment.<ref name=\"Nemergut\"/>  While the effect of initial community on microbial [[Ecological succession|succession]] has been studied in various environmental samples, [[human microbiome]], and laboratory settings, it has yet to be studied in roots.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:Soil biology]]\n[[Category:Microbiology]]\n[[Category:Biomes]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo/generalfixes, replaced: therefor \u2192 therefore", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_microbiome"}

She bettered her personal 72-hole best with 30 strokes and beat the whole Swedish amateur national team, of which some did not even had heard of Neumann before the tournament.
