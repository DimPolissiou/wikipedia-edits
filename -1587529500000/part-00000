[[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|Oxy-acetylene welding]] was a popular welding process in previous decades. The development and advantages of [[arc welding|arc-based welding processes]] have made oxy-fuel welding nearly extinct for many applications. Acetylene usage for welding has dropped significantly. On the other hand, oxy-acetylene welding ''equipment'' is quite versatile \u2013 not only because the torch is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding (as in certain artistic applications), but also because it lends itself easily to brazing, braze-welding, metal heating (for annealing or tempering, bending or forming), the loosening of corroded nuts and bolts, and other applications. [[Bell Canada]] cable-repair technicians still use portable acetylene-fuelled torch kits as a [[soldering]] tool for sealing lead sleeve splices in [[manhole]]s and in some aerial locations. Oxyacetylene welding may also be used in areas where electricity is not readily accessible. Oxy-acetylene cutting is used in many metal fabrication shops.

[[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|Oxy-acetylene welding]] was a popular welding process in previous decades. The development and advantages of [[arc welding|arc-based welding processes]] have made oxy-fuel welding nearly extinct for many applications. Acetylene usage for welding has dropped significantly. On the other hand, oxy-acetylene welding ''equipment'' is quite versatile \u2013 not only because the torch is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding (as in certain artistic applications), but also because it lends itself easily to brazing, braze-welding, metal heating (for annealing or tempering, bending or forming), the loosening of corroded nuts and bolts, and other applications. [[Bell Canada]] cable-repair technicians still use portable acetylene-fuelled torch kits as a [[soldering]] tool for sealing lead sleeve splices in [[manhole]]s and in some aerial locations. Oxyacetylene welding may also be used in areas where electricity is not readily accessible. Oxy-acetylene cutting is used in many metal fabrication shops.

The Kijun Sen acts as an indicator of future price movement. If the price is higher than the blue line, it could continue to climb higher. If the price is below the blue line, it could keep dropping.\n\n===Senkou span A===\nSenkou ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u5148\u884c|\u5148\u884c]]}}) span A calculation: (Tenkan-sen + kijun-sen)/2 plotted 26 periods ahead.\n\nAlso called leading span 1, this line forms one edge of the kumo or cloud.\n\nIf the price is above the Senkou span, the top line serves as the first support level while the bottom line serves as the second support level.\n\nIf the price is below the Senkou span, the bottom line forms the first resistance level while the top line is the second resistance level.\n\n===Senkou span B===\nSenkou span B calculation: (highest high + lowest low)/2 calculated over the past 52 time periods and plotted 26 periods ahead.\n\nAlso called leading span 2, this line forms the other edge of the Kumo.\n\n===Kumo===\nKumo ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u96f2|\u96f2]]}}, cloud) is the space between Senkou span A and B. The cloud edges identify current and potential future support and resistance points.\n\nThe Kumo cloud changes in shape and height based on price changes. This height represents volatility as larger price movements form thicker clouds, which creates stronger support and resistance. As thinner clouds offer only weak support and resistance, prices can and tend to break through such thin clouds.\n\nGenerally, markets are bullish when Senkou Span A is above Senkou Span B and vice versa when markets are bearish. Traders often look for Kumo Twists in future clouds, where Senkou Span A and B exchange positions, a signal of potential trend reversals.\n\nIn addition to thickness, the strength of the cloud can also be ascertained by its angle; upwards for bullish and downwards for bearish. Any clouds behind price are also known as Kumo Shadows.\n\n===Chikou span===\nChikou ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u9045\u884c|\u9045\u884c]]}}) span calculation: today's closing price projected back 26 days on the chart.\n\nAlso called the lagging span it is used as a support/resistance aid.\n\nIf the Chikou Span or the green line crosses the price in the bottom-up direction, that is a buy signal.

EXPTIME is one class in an [[exponential hierarchy]] of complexity classes with increasingly more complex oracles or quantifier alternations. For example, the class [[2-EXPTIME]] is defined similarly to EXPTIME but with a [[Double exponential function|doubly exponential]] time bound <math display=\"inline\">2^{2^{p(n)}}</math>. This can be generalized to higher and higher time bounds. EXPTIME can also be reformulated as the space class APSPACE, the set of all problems that can be solved by an [[alternating Turing machine]] in polynomial space.\n\n<!--Relationships to other classes-->\nEXPTIME relates to the other basic time and space complexity classes in the following way: [[P (complexity)|P]] \u2286 [[NP (complexity)|NP]] \u2286 [[PSPACE]] \u2286 [[EXPTIME]] \u2286 [[NEXPTIME]] \u2286 [[EXPSPACE]].

In other words, there is a polynomial-time [[algorithm]] that transforms instances of one to instances of the other with the same answer. Problems that are EXPTIME-complete might be thought of as the hardest problems in EXPTIME. Notice that although it is unknown whether NP is equal to P, we do know that EXPTIME-complete problems are not in P; it has been proven that these problems cannot be solved in [[polynomial time]], by the [[time hierarchy theorem]].\n\nIn [[computability theory]], one of the basic undecidable problems is the [[halting problem]]: deciding whether a [[deterministic Turing machine]] (DTM) halts. One of the most fundamental EXPTIME-complete problems is a simpler version of this, which asks if a DTM halts in at most ''k'' steps. It is in EXPTIME because a trivial simulation requires O(''k'') time, and the input ''k'' is encoded using O(log ''k'') bits which causes exponential number of simulations. It is EXPTIME-complete because, roughly speaking, we can use it to determine if a machine solving an EXPTIME problem accepts in an exponential number of steps; it will not use more.<ref>{{citation|title=Theory of Computational Complexity|series=Wiley Series in Discrete Mathematics and Optimization|first1=Ding-Zhu|last1=Du|first2=Ker-I|last2=Ko|edition=2nd|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2014|isbn=9781118594971|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMwOBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT203|at=Proposition 3.30}}.</ref> The same problem with the number of steps written in unary is [[P-complete]].\n\nOther examples of EXPTIME-complete problems include the problem of evaluating a position in [[generalized game|generalized]] [[chess]],<ref name=\"Fraenkel1981\">{{cite journal| author = [[Aviezri Fraenkel]] and D.

In the Go example, the Japanese ko rule is sufficiently intractable to imply EXPTIME-completeness, but it is not known if the more tractable American or Chinese rules for the game are EXPTIME-complete.\n\nBy contrast, generalized games that can last for a number of moves that is polynomial in the size of the board are often [[PSPACE-complete]]. The same is true of exponentially long games in which non-repetition is automatic.\n\nAnother set of important EXPTIME-complete problems relates to [[succinct circuit]]s. Succinct circuits are simple machines used to describe some graphs in exponentially less space. They accept two vertex numbers as input and output whether there is an edge between them. For many natural [[P-complete]] graph problems, where the graph is expressed in a natural representation such as an [[adjacency matrix]], solving the same problem on a succinct circuit representation is EXPTIME-complete, because the input is exponentially smaller; but this requires nontrivial proof, since succinct circuits can only describe a subclass of graphs.<ref>Papadimitriou (1994), section 20.1, page 492.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{ComplexityClasses}}\n\n[[Category:Complexity classes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|EXP||Exp (disambiguation){{!}}Exp}}\n<!--Basic definitions-->\nIn [[computational complexity theory]], the [[complexity class]] '''EXPTIME''' (sometimes called '''EXP''' or '''DEXPTIME''') is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all [[decision problem]]s that are solvable by a [[deterministic Turing machine]]  in [[exponential time]], i.e., in [[big O notation|O]](2<sup>''p''(''n'')</sup>) time, where ''p''(''n'') is a polynomial function of ''n''.

For example, the class [[2-EXPTIME]] is defined similarly to EXPTIME but with a [[Double exponential function|doubly exponential]] time bound <math display=\"inline\">2^{2^{p(n)}}</math>. This can be generalized to higher and higher time bounds. EXPTIME can also be reformulated as the space class APSPACE, the set of all problems that can be solved by an [[alternating Turing machine]] in polynomial space.\n\n<!--Relationships to other classes-->\nEXPTIME relates to the other basic time and space complexity classes in the following way: [[P (complexity)|P]] \u2286 [[NP (complexity)|NP]] \u2286 [[PSPACE]] \u2286 [[EXPTIME]] \u2286 [[NEXPTIME]] \u2286 [[EXPSPACE]].

In other words, there is a polynomial-time [[algorithm]] that transforms instances of one to instances of the other with the same answer. Problems that are EXPTIME-complete might be thought of as the hardest problems in EXPTIME. Notice that although it is unknown whether NP is equal to P, we do know that EXPTIME-complete problems are not in P; it has been proven that these problems cannot be solved in [[polynomial time]], by the [[time hierarchy theorem]].\n\nIn [[computability theory]], one of the basic undecidable problems is the [[halting problem]]: deciding whether a [[deterministic Turing machine]] (DTM) halts. One of the most fundamental EXPTIME-complete problems is a simpler version of this, which asks if a DTM halts in at most ''k'' steps. It is in EXPTIME because a trivial simulation requires O(''k'') time, and the input ''k'' is encoded using O(log ''k'') bits which causes exponential number of simulations. It is EXPTIME-complete because, roughly speaking, we can use it to determine if a machine solving an EXPTIME problem accepts in an exponential number of steps; it will not use more.<ref>{{citation|title=Theory of Computational Complexity|series=Wiley Series in Discrete Mathematics and Optimization|first1=Ding-Zhu|last1=Du|first2=Ker-I|last2=Ko|edition=2nd|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2014|isbn=9781118594971|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMwOBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT203|at=Proposition 3.30}}.</ref> The same problem with the number of steps written in unary is [[P-complete]].\n\nOther examples of EXPTIME-complete problems include the problem of evaluating a position in [[generalized game|generalized]] [[chess]],<ref name=\"Fraenkel1981\">{{cite journal| author = [[Aviezri Fraenkel]] and D.

In the Go example, the Japanese ko rule is sufficiently intractable to imply EXPTIME-completeness, but it is not known if the more tractable American or Chinese rules for the game are EXPTIME-complete.\n\nBy contrast, generalized games that can last for a number of moves that is polynomial in the size of the board are often [[PSPACE-complete]]. The same is true of exponentially long games in which non-repetition is automatic.\n\nAnother set of important EXPTIME-complete problems relates to [[succinct circuit]]s. Succinct circuits are simple machines used to describe some graphs in exponentially less space. They accept two vertex numbers as input and output whether there is an edge between them. For many natural [[P-complete]] graph problems, where the graph is expressed in a natural representation such as an [[adjacency matrix]], solving the same problem on a succinct circuit representation is EXPTIME-complete, because the input is exponentially smaller; but this requires nontrivial proof, since succinct circuits can only describe a subclass of graphs.<ref>Papadimitriou (1994), section 20.1, page 492.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{ComplexityClasses}}\n\n[[Category:Complexity classes]]\n", "name_user": "Jaydavidmartin", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEXPTIME-complete:removed extraneous comma", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXPTIME"}
