Photo-voltaic cells use [[sunlight]] as a source of energy and generate direct current [[electricity]]. A collection of PV modules is called a PV Panel, and a system of Panels is an Array. Arrays of a [[photovoltaic system]] supply [[solar electricity]] to electrical equipment.\n\nThe most common application of solar energy collection outside agriculture is [[solar water heating]] systems.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/sd.1547 |title=Comparing Solar Water Heater Popularization Policies in China, Israel and Australia: The Roles of Governments in Adopting Green Innovations |journal=Sustainable Development |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=160\u201370 |year=2013 |last1=Li |first1=Wei |last2=Rubin |first2=Tzameret H |last3=Onyina |first3=Paul A }}</ref>\n\n== Theory and construction ==\n{{See also|Solar cell}}\n[[File:From a solar cell to a PV system.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|From a [[solar cell]] to a [[PV system]]]]\n\n[[Photovoltaic]] modules use light energy ([[photon]]s) from the Sun to generate electricity through the [[photovoltaic effect]]. Most modules use [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]-based [[crystalline silicon]] cells or [[Thin film solar cell|thin-film cells]]. The structural ([[Dead and live loads|load carrying]]) member of a module can be either the top layer or the back layer. Cells must be protected from mechanical damage and moisture. Most modules are rigid, but semi-flexible ones based on thin-film cells are also available. The cells are connected electrically in series, one to another to a desired voltage, and then in parallel to increase amperage. The wattage of the module is the mathematical product of the voltage and the amperage of the module.\n\nA PV [[junction box]] is attached to the back of the solar panel and functions as its output interface. External connections for most photovoltaic modules use [[MC4 connector]]s to facilitate easy weatherproof connections to the rest of the system. A USB power interface can also be used.\n\nModule electrical connections are made [[Series circuits|in series]] to achieve a desired output voltage or [[Parallel circuits|in parallel]] to provide a desired current capability (amperes) of the solar panel or the PV system. The conducting wires that take the current off the modules are sized according to the ampacity and may contain silver, copper or other non-magnetic conductive transition metals. Bypass [[diode]]s may be incorporated or used externally, in case of partial module shading, to maximize the output of module sections still illuminated.\n\nSome special solar PV modules include [[Solar concentrator|concentrators]] in which light is focused by [[lens (optics)|lenses]] or mirrors onto smaller cells. This enables the use of cells with a high cost per unit area (such as [[gallium arsenide]]) in a cost-effective way. \n\nSolar panels also use metal frames consisting of racking components, brackets, reflector shapes, and troughs to better support the panel structure.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanindust.com/solar-panel-metal-stamping|title=Metal Stamped Parts for Solar Paneling {{!}} American Industrial|work=American Industrial|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Solar cell#History|Timeline of solar cells}}\n\nIn 1839, the ability of some materials to create an electrical charge from light exposure was first observed by [[Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Though the premiere solar panels were too inefficient for even simple electric devices they were used as an instrument to measure light.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.energymatters.com.au/panels-modules/ |title= The history of the invention of the solar panel summary. |accessdate=25 January 2019 |website=Engergymatters.com|first1=M |last1=Christian|publisher=Energymatters.com}}</ref> The observation by Becquerel was not replicated again until 1873, when [[Willoughby Smith]] discovered that the charge could be caused by light hitting selenium.

Hence, much of the incident [[sunlight]] energy is wasted by solar modules, and they can give far higher efficiencies if illuminated with [[monochromatic]] light. Therefore, another design concept is to split the light into six to eight different wavelength ranges that will produce a different color of light, and direct the beams onto different cells tuned to those ranges.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/513671/ultra-efficient-solar-power/|title=Managing Light To Increase Solar Efficiency|last=Orcutt|first=Mike|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}</ref> This has been projected to be capable of raising efficiency by 50%. \n\nA single solar module can produce only a limited amount of power; most installations contain multiple modules adding voltages or current to the wiring and PV system. A photovoltaic system typically includes an array of photovoltaic modules, an [[Power inverter|inverter]], a [[battery (electricity)|battery pack]] for energy storage, charge controller, interconnection wiring, circuit breakers, fuses, disconnect switches, voltage meters, and optionally a [[solar tracker|solar tracking]] mechanism. Equipment is carefully selected to optimize output, energy storage, reduce power loss during power transmission, and conversion from direct current to alternating current. \n\nScientists from Spectrolab, a subsidiary of [[Boeing]], have reported development of [[multi-junction solar cell]]s with an efficiency of more than 40%, a new world record for solar photovoltaic cells.<ref>KING, R.R., et al., Appl.

The [[Light scattering|scattered]] [[light]] then travels along a longer path in the semiconductor, absorbing more photons to be converted into current. Although these nanocylinders have been used previously (aluminum was preceded by [[gold]] and [[silver]]), the light scattering occurred in the near infrared region and visible light was absorbed strongly. Aluminum was found to have absorbed the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, while the visible and near infrared parts of the spectrum were found to be scattered by the aluminum surface. This, the research argued, could bring down the cost significantly and improve the efficiency as aluminum is more abundant and less costly than gold and silver. The research also noted that the increase in current makes thinner film solar panels technically feasible without \"compromising power conversion efficiencies, thus reducing material consumption\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/improving-the-efficiency-of-solar-panels/article5265330.ece |title=Improving the efficiency of solar panels |publisher=The Hindu |date=24 October 2013 |accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref>\n* Solar panel efficiency can be calculated by MPP (maximum power point) value of solar panels.\n* [[Solar inverter]]s convert the DC power to [[Alternating current|AC]] power by performing [[maximum power point tracking|the process of maximum power point tracking]] (MPPT): solar inverter samples the output Power (I-V curve) from the solar cell and applies the proper resistance (load) to solar cells to obtain maximum power.\n* MPP (Maximum power point) of the solar panel consists of MPP voltage (V mpp) and MPP current (I mpp): it is a capacity of the solar panel and the higher value can make higher MPP.\n\nMicro-inverted solar panels are wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]], which produces more output than normal panels wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]], with the output of the series determined by the lowest performing panel. This is known as the \"Christmas light effect\". Micro-inverters work independently to enable each panel to contribute its maximum possible output for a given amount of sunlight.<ref>{{cite web |title=Micro Inverters for Residential Solar Arrays |url=https://www.expertsure.com/uk/home/micro-inverters-for-residential-solar-arrays/ |accessdate=2017-05-10}}</ref>\n\n== Technology ==\n{{Main article|Crystalline silicon|Thin film solar cell}}\n[[File:Global Market Share by PV Technology from 1990 to 2013.svg|thumb|Market-share of PV technologies since 1990]]\n\nMost solar modules are currently produced from crystalline silicon (c-Si) [[solar cells]] made of [[polycrystalline silicon|multicrystalline]] and [[monocrystalline silicon]]. In 2013, crystalline silicon accounted for more than 90 percent of worldwide PV production, while the rest of the overall market is made up of [[thin film solar cells|thin-film technologies]] using [[CdTe PV|cadmium telluride]], [[CIGS panel|CIGS]] and [[amorphous silicon]]<ref>[http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/photovoltaics-report-slides.pdf Photovoltaics Report, Fraunhofer ISE, 28 July 2014], pages 18,19</ref> \n\nEmerging, [[Thin film solar cell#Emerging photovoltaics|third generation]] solar technologies use advanced thin-film cells. They produce a relatively high-efficiency conversion for the low cost compared to other solar technologies. Also, high-cost, high-efficiency, and close-packed rectangular [[multi-junction solar cell|multi-junction (MJ) cell]]s are preferably used in [[solar panels on spacecraft]], as they offer the highest ratio of generated power per kilogram lifted into space. MJ-cells are [[compound semiconductor]]s and made of [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) and other semiconductor materials. Another emerging PV technology using MJ-cells is [[concentrator photovoltaics]] ( CPV ).\n\n=== Thin film ===\nIn rigid [[thin-film module]]s, the cell and the module are manufactured in the same production line. The cell is created on a glass [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] or superstrate, and the electrical connections are created ''in situ'', a so-called \"monolithic integration\". The substrate or superstrate is laminated with an encapsulant to a front or back [[wikt:sheet|sheet]], usually another sheet of glass. The main cell technologies in this category are [[Cadmium telluride|CdTe]], or [[amorphous silicon|a-Si]], or [[micromorphous silicon|a-Si+uc-Si tandem]], or [[Copper indium gallium selenide|CIGS]] (or variant). Amorphous silicon has a sunlight conversion rate of 6\u201312%\n\nFlexible thin film cells and modules are created on the same production line by depositing the [[photoactive layer]] and other necessary layers on a [[flexible substrate]]. If the substrate is an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] (e.g. [[polyester]] or [[polyimide]] film) then [[Die (integrated circuit)|monolithic]] integration can be used. If it is a conductor then another technique for electrical connection must be used. The cells are assembled into modules by [[laminating]] them to a transparent colourless [[fluoropolymer]] on the front side (typically [[ETFE]] or [[Fluorinated ethylene propylene|FEP]]) and a polymer suitable for bonding to the final substrate on the other side.\n\n== Smart solar modules ==\n{{main article|Smart module|Solar micro-inverter}}\n\nSeveral companies have begun embedding electronics into PV modules. This enables performing MPPT for each module individually, and the measurement of performance data for monitoring and fault detection at module level. Some of these solutions make use of [[power optimizer]]s, a DC-to-DC converter technology developed to maximize the power harvest from solar photovoltaic systems. As of about 2010, such electronics can also compensate for shading effects, wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the module to fall to zero, but not having the output of the entire module fall to zero.\n\n== Performance and degradation ==\n{{original research|section|date=August 2013}}\n\n[[File:Actual output in volts, amps, and wattage from a 100 Watt Solar module in August.jpg|thumb]]\n\nModule performance is generally rated under standard test conditions (STC): [[irradiance]] of 1,000 [[W/m2|W/m<sup>2</sup>]], solar [[spectrum]] of [[Airmass|AM]] 1.5 and module temperature at 25\u00b0C. The actual voltage and current output of the module changes as lighting, temperature and load conditions change, so there is never one specific voltage, current, or wattage at which the module operates. Performance varies depending on time of day, amount of solar insolation, direction and tilt of modules, cloud cover, shading, state of charge, temperature, geographic location, and day of the year. The fluctuations in voltage and current can be logged with multimeter or data logger.\n\nFor optimum performance a solar panel needs to be made of similar modules oriented in the same direction perpendicular towards direct sunlight. The path of the sun varies by latitude and day of the year and can be studied using a sundial or a sunchart and tracked using a solar tracker. Differences in voltage or current of modules may affect the overall performance of a panel. Bypass diodes are used to circumvent broken or shaded panels to optimize output. \n\nElectrical characteristics include nominal power (P<sub>MAX</sub>, measured in [[watt|W]]), [[open circuit voltage]] (V<sub>OC</sub>), [[short circuit current]] (I<sub>SC</sub>, measured in [[ampere]]s), maximum power voltage (V<sub>MPP</sub>), maximum power current (I<sub>MPP</sub>), peak power, ([[watt-peak]], W<sub>p</sub>), and module efficiency (%).\n\nNominal voltage<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionaryofengineering.com/definition/nominal-voltage.html|title=nominal voltage Definition and Meaning|website=www.dictionaryofengineering.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref> refers to the voltage of the battery that the module is best suited to charge; this is a leftover term from the days when solar modules were only used to charge batteries. Nominal voltage allows users, at a glance, to make sure the module is compatible with a given system.\n\nOpen circuit voltage or V<sub>OC</sub> is the maximum voltage that the module can produce when not connected to an electrical circuit or system. V<sub>OC</sub> can be measured with a [[voltmeter]] directly on an illuminated module's terminals or on its disconnected cable.\n\nThe peak power rating, W<sub>p</sub>, is the maximum output under standard test conditions (not the maximum possible output). Typical modules, which could measure approximately {{convert|1|x|2|m|ft|sigfig=1}}, will be rated from as low as 75 W to as high as 350 W, depending on their efficiency. At the time of testing, the test modules are binned according to their test results, and a typical manufacturer might rate their modules in 5 W increments, and either rate them at +/- 3%, +/-5%, +3/-0% or +5/-0%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phoenixsolar-group.com/dms/produkte/module/pdf/en/FirstSolar_PD-5-401-03-Global-Series-3-Datasheet/PD-5-401-03%20Global%20Series%203%20Datasheet.pdf  |title=First Solar \u2013 FS-377 / FS-380 / FS-382 / FS-385 Datasheet |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trinasolar.com/images/PDF/datasheets/us/TSM-PA14_US.pdf |title=TSM PC/PM14 Datasheet |accessdate=2012-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200512/http://www.trinasolar.com/images/PDF/datasheets/us/TSM-PA14_US.pdf |archive-date=29 October 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lubisolar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Poly-260-275W.pdf |title=LBS Poly 260 275 Data sheet |date= |accessdate=2018-01-09}}</ref>\n\nThe ability of solar modules to withstand damage by rain, [[hail]], heavy snow load, and cycles of heat and cold varies by manufacturer, although most solar panels on the U.S. market are UL listed, meaning they have gone through testing to withstand hail.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://energyinformative.org/solar-panels-weather/|title=Are Solar Panels Affected by Weather? - Energy Informative|work=Energy Informative|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}</ref> Many [[crystalline silicon]] module manufacturers offer a [[Warranty#Defects_In_Materials_and_Workmanship|limited warranty]] that guarantees electrical production for 10 years at 90% of rated power output and 25 years at 80%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cti-solar.com/userfiles/file/brochlet%20CTI-SOLAR%20vers%20EN.pdf |title=CTI Solar sales brochure |work=cti-solar.com |accessdate=3 September 2010}}</ref> \n\n[[Potential induced degradation]] (also called PID) is a potential induced performance degradation in crystalline photovoltaic modules, caused by so-called stray currents. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.solarplaza.com/channels/asset-management/11674/potential-induced-degradation-combatting-phantom-menace/|title=Solarplaza Potential Induced Degradation: Combatting a Phantom Menace|website=www.solarplaza.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref>This effect may cause power loss of up to 30%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eicero.com/what-is-pid|title=What is PID? \u2014 eicero|last=(www.inspire.cz)|first=INSPIRE CZ s.r.o.|website=eicero.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref>\n\nThe largest challenge for [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] technology is said to be the purchase price per watt of electricity produced. New materials and manufacturing techniques continue to improve the price to power performance. The problem resides in the enormous activation energy that must be overcome for a photon to excite an electron for harvesting purposes. Advancements in photovoltaic technologies have brought about the process of \"doping\" the silicon substrate to lower the activation energy thereby making the panel more efficient in converting photons to retrievable electrons.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Solar Cells Work |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/solar-cell2.htm |website=HowStuffWorks |accessdate=2015-12-09}}</ref> \n\nChemicals such as [[boron]] (p-type) are applied into the semiconductor crystal in order to create donor and acceptor energy levels substantially closer to the valence and conductor [http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/section_16/6520efadc9fafd08d3043572e61e9765.jpg bands].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bonding in Metals and Semiconductors |url=http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/s16-06-bonding-in-metals-and-semicond.html |website=2012books.lardbucket.org|accessdate=2015-12-09}}</ref> In doing so, the addition of boron impurity allows the activation energy to decrease 20 fold from 1.12 eV to 0.05 eV. Since the potential difference (E<sub>B</sub>) is so low, the boron is able to thermally ionize at room temperatures. This allows for free energy carriers in the conduction and valence bands thereby allowing greater conversion of photons to electrons.\n\n== Maintenance ==\nSolar panel conversion efficiency, typically in the 20% range, is reduced by dust, grime, pollen, and other particulates that accumulate on the solar panel. \"A dirty solar panel can reduce its power capabilities by up to 30% in high dust/pollen or desert areas\", says Seamus Curran, associate professor of physics at the University of Houston and director of the Institute for NanoEnergy, which specializes in the design, engineering, and assembly of nanostructures.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/energy/self-cleaning-solar-panels-maximize-efficiency |title=Self-Cleaning Solar Panels Maximize Efficiency |date=October 2012 |accessdate=15 September 2014 |website=The American Society of Mechanical Engineers |publisher=ASME |last=Crawford |first=Mike}}</ref>\n\nPaying to have solar panels cleaned is often not a good investment; researchers found panels that had not been cleaned, or rained on, for 145 days during a summer drought in California, lost only 7.4% of their efficiency.

However, it produces only direct current electricity (DC), which is not what normal appliances use. Solar photovoltaic systems (solar PV systems) are often made of solar PV panels (modules) and inverter (changing DC to AC). Solar PV panels are mainly made of solar photovoltaic cells, which has no fundamental difference to the material for making computer chips{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. The process of producing solar PV cells (computer chips) is energy intensive and involves highly poisonous and environmental toxic chemicals{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. There are few solar PV manufacturing plants around the world producing PV modules with energy produced from PV{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. This measure greatly reduces the carbon footprint during the manufacturing process{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. Managing the chemicals used in the manufacturing process is subject to the factories' local laws and regulations{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}.\n\n=== Impact on electricity network ===\nWith the increasing levels of rooftop photovoltaic systems, the energy flow becomes 2-way. When there is more local generation than consumption, electricity is exported to the grid. However, an electricity network traditionally is not designed to deal with the 2- way energy transfer. Therefore, some technical issues may occur. For example, in Queensland Australia, more than 30% of households used rooftop PV by the end of 2017. The famous Californian 2020 [[duck curve]] appeared often for a lot of communities from 2015 onwards. An over-voltage issue may result as the electricity flows from  PV households back to the network.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Wendy |last2=Liu |first2=Aaron |last3=Amin |first3=Zakaria |last4=Wagner |first4=Andreas |title=Power Quality and Rooftop-Photovoltaic Households: An Examination of Measured Data at Point of Customer Connection |journal=Sustainability |volume=10 |issue=4 |year=2018 |pages=1224 |doi=10.3390/su10041224 |url=https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000082198/7829299 }}</ref> There are solutions to manage the over voltage issue, such as regulating PV inverter power factor, new voltage and energy control equipment at the electricity distributor level, re-conducting the electricity wires, demand side management, etc. There are often limitations and costs related to these solutions.\n\nWhen electric networks are down, such as during the October [[2019 California power shutoff]], solar panels are often insufficient to fully provide power to a house or other structure, because they are designed to supply power to the grid, not directly to homes. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Martin |first1=Chris |title=Californians Learning That Solar Panels Don't Work in Blackouts |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-10/californians-learning-that-solar-panels-don-t-work-in-blackouts |work=Bloomberg |publisher=Bloomberg LP |date=10 October 2019 |location=New York NY}}</ref>\n\n=== Implication onto electricity bill management and energy investment ===\nThere is no silver bullet in electricity or energy demand and bill management, because customers (sites) have different specific situations, e.g. different comfort/convenience needs, different electricity tariffs, or different usage patterns. Electricity tariff may have a few elements, such as daily access and metering charge, energy charge (based on kWh, MWh) or peak demand charge (e.g. a price for the highest 30min energy consumption in a month). PV is a promising option for reducing energy charge when electricity price is reasonably high and continuously increasing, such as in Australia and Germany. However, for sites with peak demand charge in place, PV may be less attractive if peak demands mostly occur in the late afternoon to early evening, for example residential communities. Overall, energy investment is largely an economical decision and it is better to make investment decisions based on systematical evaluation of options in operational improvement, energy efficiency, onsite generation and energy storage.<ref>L.

Most modules use [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]-based [[crystalline silicon]] cells or [[Thin film solar cell|thin-film cells]]. The structural ([[Dead and live loads|load carrying]]) member of a module can be either the top layer or the back layer. Cells must be protected from mechanical damage and moisture. Most modules are rigid, but semi-flexible ones based on thin-film cells are also available. The cells are connected electrically in series, one to another to a desired voltage, and then in parallel to increase amperage. The wattage of the module is the mathematical product of the voltage and the amperage of the module.\n\nA PV [[junction box]] is attached to the back of the solar panel and functions as its output interface. External connections for most photovoltaic modules use [[MC4 connector]]s to facilitate easy weatherproof connections to the rest of the system. A USB power interface can also be used.\n\nModule electrical connections are made [[Series circuits|in series]] to achieve a desired output voltage or [[Parallel circuits|in parallel]] to provide a desired current capability (amperes) of the solar panel or the PV system.

Hence, much of the incident [[sunlight]] energy is wasted by solar modules, and they can give far higher efficiencies if illuminated with [[monochromatic]] light. Therefore, another design concept is to split the light into six to eight different wavelength ranges that will produce a different color of light, and direct the beams onto different cells tuned to those ranges.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/513671/ultra-efficient-solar-power/|title=Managing Light To Increase Solar Efficiency|last=Orcutt|first=Mike|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}</ref> This has been projected to be capable of raising efficiency by 50%. \n\nA single solar module can produce only a limited amount of power; most installations contain multiple modules adding voltages or current to the wiring and PV system. A photovoltaic system typically includes an array of photovoltaic modules, an [[Power inverter|inverter]], a [[battery (electricity)|battery pack]] for energy storage, charge controller, interconnection wiring, circuit breakers, fuses, disconnect switches, voltage meters, and optionally a [[solar tracker|solar tracking]] mechanism. Equipment is carefully selected to optimize output, energy storage, reduce power loss during power transmission, and conversion from direct current to alternating current. \n\nScientists from Spectrolab, a subsidiary of [[Boeing]], have reported development of [[multi-junction solar cell]]s with an efficiency of more than 40%, a new world record for solar photovoltaic cells.<ref>KING, R.R., et al., Appl.

The [[Light scattering|scattered]] [[light]] then travels along a longer path in the semiconductor, absorbing more photons to be converted into current. Although these nanocylinders have been used previously (aluminum was preceded by [[gold]] and [[silver]]), the light scattering occurred in the near infrared region and visible light was absorbed strongly. Aluminum was found to have absorbed the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, while the visible and near infrared parts of the spectrum were found to be scattered by the aluminum surface. This, the research argued, could bring down the cost significantly and improve the efficiency as aluminum is more abundant and less costly than gold and silver. The research also noted that the increase in current makes thinner film solar panels technically feasible without \"compromising power conversion efficiencies, thus reducing material consumption\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/improving-the-efficiency-of-solar-panels/article5265330.ece |title=Improving the efficiency of solar panels |publisher=The Hindu |date=24 October 2013 |accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref>\n* Solar panel efficiency can be calculated by MPP (maximum power point) value of solar panels.\n* [[Solar inverter]]s convert the DC power to [[Alternating current|AC]] power by performing [[maximum power point tracking|the process of maximum power point tracking]] (MPPT): solar inverter samples the output Power (I-V curve) from the solar cell and applies the proper resistance (load) to solar cells to obtain maximum power.\n* MPP (Maximum power point) of the solar panel consists of MPP voltage (V mpp) and MPP current (I mpp): it is a capacity of the solar panel and the higher value can make higher MPP.\n\nMicro-inverted solar panels are wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]], which produces more output than normal panels wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]], with the output of the series determined by the lowest performing panel. This is known as the \"Christmas light effect\".

In 2013, crystalline silicon accounted for more than 90 percent of worldwide PV production, while the rest of the overall market is made up of [[thin film solar cells|thin-film technologies]] using [[CdTe PV|cadmium telluride]], [[CIGS panel|CIGS]] and [[amorphous silicon]]<ref>[http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/photovoltaics-report-slides.pdf Photovoltaics Report, Fraunhofer ISE, 28 July 2014], pages 18,19</ref> \n\nEmerging, [[Thin film solar cell#Emerging photovoltaics|third generation]] solar technologies use advanced thin-film cells. They produce a relatively high-efficiency conversion for the low cost compared to other solar technologies. Also, high-cost, high-efficiency, and close-packed rectangular [[multi-junction solar cell|multi-junction (MJ) cell]]s are preferably used in [[solar panels on spacecraft]], as they offer the highest ratio of generated power per kilogram lifted into space. MJ-cells are [[compound semiconductor]]s and made of [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) and other semiconductor materials. Another emerging PV technology using MJ-cells is [[concentrator photovoltaics]] ( CPV ).\n\n=== Thin film ===\nIn rigid [[thin-film module]]s, the cell and the module are manufactured in the same production line. The cell is created on a glass [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] or superstrate, and the electrical connections are created ''in situ'', a so-called \"monolithic integration\". The substrate or superstrate is laminated with an encapsulant to a front or back [[wikt:sheet|sheet]], usually another sheet of glass. The main cell technologies in this category are [[Cadmium telluride|CdTe]], or [[amorphous silicon|a-Si]], or [[micromorphous silicon|a-Si+uc-Si tandem]], or [[Copper indium gallium selenide|CIGS]] (or variant). Amorphous silicon has a sunlight conversion rate of 6\u201312%\n\nFlexible thin film cells and modules are created on the same production line by depositing the [[photoactive layer]] and other necessary layers on a [[flexible substrate]]. If the substrate is an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] (e.g. [[polyester]] or [[polyimide]] film) then [[Die (integrated circuit)|monolithic]] integration can be used. If it is a conductor then another technique for electrical connection must be used. The cells are assembled into modules by [[laminating]] them to a transparent colourless [[fluoropolymer]] on the front side (typically [[ETFE]] or [[Fluorinated ethylene propylene|FEP]]) and a polymer suitable for bonding to the final substrate on the other side.\n\n== Smart solar modules ==\n{{main article|Smart module|Solar micro-inverter}}\n\nSeveral companies have begun embedding electronics into PV modules. This enables performing MPPT for each module individually, and the measurement of performance data for monitoring and fault detection at module level. Some of these solutions make use of [[power optimizer]]s, a DC-to-DC converter technology developed to maximize the power harvest from solar photovoltaic systems. As of about 2010, such electronics can also compensate for shading effects, wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the module to fall to zero, but not having the output of the entire module fall to zero.\n\n== Performance and degradation ==\n{{original research|section|date=August 2013}}\n\n[[File:Actual output in volts, amps, and wattage from a 100 Watt Solar module in August.jpg|thumb]]\n\nModule performance is generally rated under standard test conditions (STC): [[irradiance]] of 1,000 [[W/m2|W/m<sup>2</sup>]], solar [[spectrum]] of [[Airmass|AM]] 1.5 and module temperature at 25\u00b0C. The actual voltage and current output of the module changes as lighting, temperature and load conditions change, so there is never one specific voltage, current, or wattage at which the module operates. Performance varies depending on time of day, amount of solar insolation, direction and tilt of modules, cloud cover, shading, state of charge, temperature, geographic location, and day of the year. The fluctuations in voltage and current can be logged with multimeter or data logger.\n\nFor optimum performance a solar panel needs to be made of similar modules oriented in the same direction perpendicular towards direct sunlight. The path of the sun varies by latitude and day of the year and can be studied using a sundial or a sunchart and tracked using a solar tracker. Differences in voltage or current of modules may affect the overall performance of a panel. Bypass diodes are used to circumvent broken or shaded panels to optimize output. \n\nElectrical characteristics include nominal power (P<sub>MAX</sub>, measured in [[watt|W]]), [[open circuit voltage]] (V<sub>OC</sub>), [[short circuit current]] (I<sub>SC</sub>, measured in [[ampere]]s), maximum power voltage (V<sub>MPP</sub>), maximum power current (I<sub>MPP</sub>), peak power, ([[watt-peak]], W<sub>p</sub>), and module efficiency (%).\n\nNominal voltage<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionaryofengineering.com/definition/nominal-voltage.html|title=nominal voltage Definition and Meaning|website=www.dictionaryofengineering.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref> refers to the voltage of the battery that the module is best suited to charge; this is a leftover term from the days when solar modules were only used to charge batteries. Nominal voltage allows users, at a glance, to make sure the module is compatible with a given system.\n\nOpen circuit voltage or V<sub>OC</sub> is the maximum voltage that the module can produce when not connected to an electrical circuit or system. V<sub>OC</sub> can be measured with a [[voltmeter]] directly on an illuminated module's terminals or on its disconnected cable.\n\nThe peak power rating, W<sub>p</sub>, is the maximum output under standard test conditions (not the maximum possible output). Typical modules, which could measure approximately {{convert|1|x|2|m|ft|sigfig=1}}, will be rated from as low as 75 W to as high as 350 W, depending on their efficiency. At the time of testing, the test modules are binned according to their test results, and a typical manufacturer might rate their modules in 5 W increments, and either rate them at +/- 3%, +/-5%, +3/-0% or +5/-0%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phoenixsolar-group.com/dms/produkte/module/pdf/en/FirstSolar_PD-5-401-03-Global-Series-3-Datasheet/PD-5-401-03%20Global%20Series%203%20Datasheet.pdf  |title=First Solar \u2013 FS-377 / FS-380 / FS-382 / FS-385 Datasheet |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trinasolar.com/images/PDF/datasheets/us/TSM-PA14_US.pdf |title=TSM PC/PM14 Datasheet |accessdate=2012-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200512/http://www.trinasolar.com/images/PDF/datasheets/us/TSM-PA14_US.pdf |archive-date=29 October 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lubisolar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Poly-260-275W.pdf |title=LBS Poly 260 275 Data sheet |date= |accessdate=2018-01-09}}</ref>\n\nThe ability of solar modules to withstand damage by rain, [[hail]], heavy snow load, and cycles of heat and cold varies by manufacturer, although most solar panels on the U.S. market are UL listed, meaning they have gone through testing to withstand hail.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://energyinformative.org/solar-panels-weather/|title=Are Solar Panels Affected by Weather? - Energy Informative|work=Energy Informative|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}</ref> Many [[crystalline silicon]] module manufacturers offer a [[Warranty#Defects_In_Materials_and_Workmanship|limited warranty]] that guarantees electrical production for 10 years at 90% of rated power output and 25 years at 80%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cti-solar.com/userfiles/file/brochlet%20CTI-SOLAR%20vers%20EN.pdf |title=CTI Solar sales brochure |work=cti-solar.com |accessdate=3 September 2010}}</ref> \n\n[[Potential induced degradation]] (also called PID) is a potential induced performance degradation in crystalline photovoltaic modules, caused by so-called stray currents. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.solarplaza.com/channels/asset-management/11674/potential-induced-degradation-combatting-phantom-menace/|title=Solarplaza Potential Induced Degradation: Combatting a Phantom Menace|website=www.solarplaza.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref>This effect may cause power loss of up to 30%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eicero.com/what-is-pid|title=What is PID? \u2014 eicero|last=(www.inspire.cz)|first=INSPIRE CZ s.r.o.|website=eicero.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref>\n\nThe largest challenge for [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] technology is said to be the purchase price per watt of electricity produced. New materials and manufacturing techniques continue to improve the price to power performance. The problem resides in the enormous activation energy that must be overcome for a photon to excite an electron for harvesting purposes. Advancements in photovoltaic technologies have brought about the process of \"doping\" the silicon substrate to lower the activation energy thereby making the panel more efficient in converting photons to retrievable electrons.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Solar Cells Work |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/solar-cell2.htm |website=HowStuffWorks |accessdate=2015-12-09}}</ref> \n\nChemicals such as [[boron]] (p-type) are applied into the semiconductor crystal in order to create donor and acceptor energy levels substantially closer to the valence and conductor [http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/section_16/6520efadc9fafd08d3043572e61e9765.jpg bands].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bonding in Metals and Semiconductors |url=http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/s16-06-bonding-in-metals-and-semicond.html |website=2012books.lardbucket.org|accessdate=2015-12-09}}</ref> In doing so, the addition of boron impurity allows the activation energy to decrease 20 fold from 1.12 eV to 0.05 eV. Since the potential difference (E<sub>B</sub>) is so low, the boron is able to thermally ionize at room temperatures. This allows for free energy carriers in the conduction and valence bands thereby allowing greater conversion of photons to electrons.\n\n== Maintenance ==\nSolar panel conversion efficiency, typically in the 20% range, is reduced by dust, grime, pollen, and other particulates that accumulate on the solar panel. \"A dirty solar panel can reduce its power capabilities by up to 30% in high dust/pollen or desert areas\", says Seamus Curran, associate professor of physics at the University of Houston and director of the Institute for NanoEnergy, which specializes in the design, engineering, and assembly of nanostructures.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/energy/self-cleaning-solar-panels-maximize-efficiency |title=Self-Cleaning Solar Panels Maximize Efficiency |date=October 2012 |accessdate=15 September 2014 |website=The American Society of Mechanical Engineers |publisher=ASME |last=Crawford |first=Mike}}</ref>\n\nPaying to have solar panels cleaned is often not a good investment; researchers found panels that had not been cleaned, or rained on, for 145 days during a summer drought in California, lost only 7.4% of their efficiency. Overall, for a typical residential solar system of 5 kW, washing panels halfway through the summer would translate into a mere $20 gain in electricity production until the summer drought ends\u2014in about 2 \u00bd months.

It can first be used in agriculture as a power source for irrigation. In health care solar panels can be used to refrigerate medical supplies. It can also be used for infrastructure. PV modules are used in [[photovoltaic system]]s and include a [[Photovoltaic system#Other systems|large variety of electric devices]]:\n* [[Photovoltaic power station]]s\n* [[Rooftop solar PV]] systems\n* [[PV system#Standalone|Standalone PV systems]]\n* [[Solar hybrid power systems]]\n* [[Concentrated photovoltaics]]\n* [[Solar plane]]s\n*[[Solar-powered water purification in rural Africa|Solar-powered water purification]]\n* [[Solar-pumped laser]]s\n* [[Solar vehicle]]s\n* [[Solar panels on spacecraft]]s and [[space station]]s\n\n== Limitations ==\n\n=== Pollution and energy in production ===\nSolar panel has been a well-known method of generating clean, emission free electricity. However, it produces only direct current electricity (DC), which is not what normal appliances use. Solar photovoltaic systems (solar PV systems) are often made of solar PV panels (modules) and inverter (changing DC to AC). Solar PV panels are mainly made of solar photovoltaic cells, which has no fundamental difference to the material for making computer chips{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. The process of producing solar PV cells (computer chips) is energy intensive and involves highly poisonous and environmental toxic chemicals{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. There are few solar PV manufacturing plants around the world producing PV modules with energy produced from PV{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. This measure greatly reduces the carbon footprint during the manufacturing process{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. Managing the chemicals used in the manufacturing process is subject to the factories' local laws and regulations{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}.\n\n=== Impact on electricity network ===\nWith the increasing levels of rooftop photovoltaic systems, the energy flow becomes 2-way. When there is more local generation than consumption, electricity is exported to the grid. However, an electricity network traditionally is not designed to deal with the 2- way energy transfer. Therefore, some technical issues may occur. For example, in Queensland Australia, more than 30% of households used rooftop PV by the end of 2017. The famous Californian 2020 [[duck curve]] appeared often for a lot of communities from 2015 onwards. An over-voltage issue may result as the electricity flows from  PV households back to the network.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Wendy |last2=Liu |first2=Aaron |last3=Amin |first3=Zakaria |last4=Wagner |first4=Andreas |title=Power Quality and Rooftop-Photovoltaic Households: An Examination of Measured Data at Point of Customer Connection |journal=Sustainability |volume=10 |issue=4 |year=2018 |pages=1224 |doi=10.3390/su10041224 |url=https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000082198/7829299 }}</ref> There are solutions to manage the over voltage issue, such as regulating PV inverter power factor, new voltage and energy control equipment at the electricity distributor level, re-conducting the electricity wires, demand side management, etc. There are often limitations and costs related to these solutions.\n\nWhen electric networks are down, such as during the October [[2019 California power shutoff]], solar panels are often insufficient to fully provide power to a house or other structure, because they are designed to supply power to the grid, not directly to homes. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Martin |first1=Chris |title=Californians Learning That Solar Panels Don't Work in Blackouts |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-10/californians-learning-that-solar-panels-don-t-work-in-blackouts |work=Bloomberg |publisher=Bloomberg LP |date=10 October 2019 |location=New York NY}}</ref>\n\n=== Implication onto electricity bill management and energy investment ===\nThere is no silver bullet in electricity or energy demand and bill management, because customers (sites) have different specific situations, e.g. different comfort/convenience needs, different electricity tariffs, or different usage patterns. Electricity tariff may have a few elements, such as daily access and metering charge, energy charge (based on kWh, MWh) or peak demand charge (e.g. a price for the highest 30min energy consumption in a month). PV is a promising option for reducing energy charge when electricity price is reasonably high and continuously increasing, such as in Australia and Germany. However, for sites with peak demand charge in place, PV may be less attractive if peak demands mostly occur in the late afternoon to early evening, for example residential communities. Overall, energy investment is largely an economical decision and it is better to make investment decisions based on systematical evaluation of options in operational improvement, energy efficiency, onsite generation and energy storage.<ref>L.

It too added a number of new datasets and features, including Ancient Literature cross-references, Cultural Concepts, [[Biblical manuscript|original manuscript]] images, multimedia and the new Factbook that attempted to integrate the increasing number of databases to an even greater extent than was possible in Logos 5. Logos 6 also integrates with the Send to [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] service provided by [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].\n\n''Logos Bible Software 7'' was released towards the end of August 2016. Features added with this full version include, Sermon Editor, Course Tool, Figurative Language (interactive), Hebrew Grammatical Constructions, Longacre Genre Analysis, Sentence Types of the New Testament Dataset, Quickstart Layouts, Speech Acts, An Empty Tomb (interactive), Exploring Biblical Manuscripts.\n\n''Logos Bible Software 8'' was released at the end of October 2018.\n\n=== Mobile versions ===\nAn [[iPhone]] [[mobile application|app]] was released alongside Logos 4 in November 2009. It allows users to access most of their Logos resources on the iPhone, with basic search and study features. Resources can be accessed over the [[Cloud computing|cloud]], or downloaded onto the device for offline access. Native [[iPad]] support was added with version 1.4 in April 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://thislamp.com/posts/2010/4/18/review-logos-bible-software-for-ipad-v-14.html|title = Review: Logos Bible Software for iPad v. 1.4|date = 18 April 2010|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = This Lamp|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Version 2.0 (January 2012) added notes, highlights and inline footnotes.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://community.logos.com/forums/t/44466.aspx|title = Logos for iOS 2.0.1 Release Notes|date = 27 January 2012|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Version 3.0 (August 2012) added reading plans and community notes,<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://community.logos.com/forums/t/53757.aspx|title = iOS Reader Suite 3.0.0 Release Notes|date = 29 August 2012|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> and version 4.0 a new [[User interface|UI]] updated for [[iOS 7]]. A topic guide was added in 4.3 (June 2014), and a scrolling view in 4.4 (December 2014). The app is now available in several 'flavours'. In addition to the standard ''Logos Bible Software'' app, other very similar apps exist under the ''Faithlife Study Bible'', ''Vyrso'', ''Verbum'' and ''Noet'' brands. These apps offer similar functionality, different branding, and a slightly different UI. The [[iOS]] app was awarded the [[DBW Publishing Innovation Award]] in 2011.\n\nAn [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app entered a public alpha in May 2011,<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://community.logos.com/forums/t/33287.aspx|title = Logos for Android Alpha 4|date = 14 May 2011|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> with a beta in July,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://bibleandtech.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/logos-for-android-released.html|title = Logos for Android released|date = 4 July 2011|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> and 1.0 released a year later. The initial release allowed little more than the reading of Logos books, so version 2.0 followed quickly in August 2012, which added notes, highlighting, reading plans, Bible Word Study, the Passage Guide and a split-screen view. This brought much closer parity with the iOS app,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.ccmag.com/2012_08/ccmag2012_08kevin.pdf|title = Logos Brings More Parity Between Android and iOS Bible Apps|date = August 2012|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = Christian Computing Magazine|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923201146/http://www.ccmag.com/2012_08/ccmag2012_08kevin.pdf|archivedate = 23 September 2015}}</ref> and future development has continued along similar lines to the iOS version.\n\n=== Rebranded versions ===\nFaithlife Corporation also produces two rebranded versions of ''Logos Bible Software'' with almost identical functionality''. Verbum'' is aimed at [[Roman Catholics]] (and adds databases of Catholic topics and [[Catholic Saints|Saints]], and more data from the [[Deuterocanonical books|Deuterocanonical Books]]), and ''Noet'' is for those undertaking scholarly work in the humanities, particularly the classics and philosophy.\n\n== Reception ==\nEach version of Logos Bible Software has generally been received very positively by reviewers and Christian leaders.

Native [[iPad]] support was added with version 1.4 in April 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://thislamp.com/posts/2010/4/18/review-logos-bible-software-for-ipad-v-14.html|title = Review: Logos Bible Software for iPad v. 1.4|date = 18 April 2010|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = This Lamp|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Version 2.0 (January 2012) added notes, highlights and inline footnotes.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://community.logos.com/forums/t/44466.aspx|title = Logos for iOS 2.0.1 Release Notes|date = 27 January 2012|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Version 3.0 (August 2012) added reading plans and community notes,<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://community.logos.com/forums/t/53757.aspx|title = iOS Reader Suite 3.0.0 Release Notes|date = 29 August 2012|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> and version 4.0 a new [[User interface|UI]] updated for [[iOS 7]]. A topic guide was added in 4.3 (June 2014), and a scrolling view in 4.4 (December 2014). The app is now available in several 'flavours'. In addition to the standard ''Logos Bible Software'' app, other very similar apps exist under the ''Faithlife Study Bible'', ''Vyrso'', ''Verbum'' and ''Noet'' brands. These apps offer similar functionality, different branding, and a slightly different UI. The [[iOS]] app was awarded the [[DBW Publishing Innovation Award]] in 2011.\n\nAn [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app entered a public alpha in May 2011,<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://community.logos.com/forums/t/33287.aspx|title = Logos for Android Alpha 4|date = 14 May 2011|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> with a beta in July,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://bibleandtech.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/logos-for-android-released.html|title = Logos for Android released|date = 4 July 2011|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> and 1.0 released a year later. The initial release allowed little more than the reading of Logos books, so version 2.0 followed quickly in August 2012, which added notes, highlighting, reading plans, Bible Word Study, the Passage Guide and a split-screen view. This brought much closer parity with the iOS app,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.ccmag.com/2012_08/ccmag2012_08kevin.pdf|title = Logos Brings More Parity Between Android and iOS Bible Apps|date = August 2012|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = Christian Computing Magazine|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923201146/http://www.ccmag.com/2012_08/ccmag2012_08kevin.pdf|archivedate = 23 September 2015}}</ref> and future development has continued along similar lines to the iOS version.\n\n=== Rebranded versions ===\nFaithlife Corporation also produces two rebranded versions of ''Logos Bible Software'' with almost identical functionality''. Verbum'' is aimed at [[Roman Catholics]] (and adds databases of Catholic topics and [[Catholic Saints|Saints]], and more data from the [[Deuterocanonical books|Deuterocanonical Books]]), and ''Noet'' is for those undertaking scholarly work in the humanities, particularly the classics and philosophy.\n\n== Reception ==\nEach version of Logos Bible Software has generally been received very positively by reviewers and Christian leaders. It is frequently praised for being user-friendly,<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Logos Bible Software 5|last = Barrett|first = Charles M.|date = April 2013|journal = Themelios|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> having the largest number of available resources of any comparable software,<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Logos Bible Software 3|last = Challies|first = Tim|date = Fall 2006|journal = The Journal of Modern Ministry|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref><ref name=\"themelios39\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Logos Bible Software 5 Platinum|last = Tabb|first = Brian J.|date = April 2014|journal = Themelios|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> and offering unique tools and datasets not found in any comparable products.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Logos Bible Software Series X|last = Parker|first = David|date = July 2003|journal = Evangelical Review of Theology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> However, it has also received some criticisms for its high cost<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Baker Academic Biblical Studies Bundle|last = Naselli|first = Andrew David|date = April 2014|journal = Themelios|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> and lack of speed when compared with other Bible software packages.<ref name=\"themelios39\" />\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\nLogos Bible Software official websites:\n* [https://www.logos.com/ Logos]\n* [https://verbum.com/ Verbum]\n* [https://noet.com/ Noet]\n\n[[Category:Electronic Bibles]]\n[[Category:Electronic publishing]]\n[[Category:Digital library software]]\n", "name_user": "Kevinalewis", "label": "safe", "comment": "8.13 Beta 3 (8.13.0.0006)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos_Bible_Software"}
