It is probably Berg's best-known and most frequently performed instrumental piece, in which the composer sought to reconcile [[diatonicism]] and [[dodecaphony]]. Berg composed it on a commission from [[Louis Krasner]], and it became the last work that he completed. Krasner performed the solo part in the premiere at the [[Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana]], [[Barcelona]] on 19 April 1936, after the composer's death.\n\n== Conception and composition ==\nThe piece stemmed from a commission from the [[violin]]ist [[Louis Krasner]]. When he first received the commission, Berg was working on his opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', and he did not begin work on the [[concerto]] for some months. The event that spurred him into writing was the death by polio of 18-year-old [[Manon Gropius]], the daughter of [[Alma Mahler]] (once [[Gustav Mahler]]'s wife) and [[Walter Gropius]]. Berg set ''Lulu'' aside to write the concerto, which he dedicated \"To the memory of an angel\".<ref name=\"Glass\" />\n\nBerg worked on the piece very quickly, completing it within a few months; it is thought that his working on the concerto was largely responsible for his failing to complete ''Lulu'' before his death on 24 December 1935. The violin concerto was the last work that Berg completed. In a letter to Krasner dated 16 July 1935, Berg confessed: {{quote|Yesterday I finished the composition [without the orchestration] of our Violin Concerto. I am probably more surprised by it than you will be (...) the work gave me more and more joy. I hope - no, I have the confident belief - that I have succeeded.{{cn|date=April 2020}}}}<!-- looked in ''Berg: Violin Concerto'' (1991) by Anthony Pople and Julian Rushton, but can't find it there -->\n\n== Scoring ==\n[[File:Louis Krasner (1903\u20131995) und Helene Berg (1885\u20131976) mit der Partitur des Violinkonzerts (1961) OeNB 657332.png|thumb|[[Louis Krasner|Krasner]] and Berg's widow [[:de:Helene Berg|Helene]] with the score (1961)]]\nThe concerto is scored for 2 [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (both doubling as [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s (one doubling as a [[cor anglais]]), [[alto saxophone]] (doubling as 3rd clarinet), 2 [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 4 [[French horn|horns]], 2 [[trumpet]]s, 2 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[percussion]], [[harp]] and [[string section|strings]].<ref name=\"Glass\">{{cite news\n |last         = Glass\n |first        = Herbert\n |url          = https://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/violin-concerto-alban-berg\n |title        = Violin Concerto \u2013 About the piece\n |publisher    = [[LA Phil]]\n |accessdate   = 2 November 2017\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20171107012243/https://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/violin-concerto-alban-berg\n |archive-date = 7 November 2017\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\nBerg described the structure of the concerto in a letter to [[Arnold Schoenberg]].<ref>Brand et al. (eds.), ''The Berg-Schoenberg Correspondence'', p.466. quoted in Pople (1991) ,p.47.</ref> It is in two movements, each divided into two sections:\n\n{{ordered-list|type=upper-roman\n| {{ordered-list|type=lower-alpha\n  | Andante (Prelude)\n  | Allegretto (Scherzo)\n  }}\n| {{ordered-list|type=lower-alpha\n  | Allegro (Cadenza)\n  | Adagio (Chorale Variations)\n  }}\n}}\n\nThe work begins with an [[tempo|Andante]] in classical [[sonata form]], followed by the [[tempo|Allegretto]], a dance-like section. The second movement starts with an [[tempo|Allegro]] largely based on a single recurring [[rhythm]]ic [[cell (music)|cell]]; this section has been described as [[cadenza]]-like, with very difficult passages in the solo part. The orchestration becomes rather violent at its climax (which is literally marked in the score as \"High point of the Allegro\"); the fourth and final section, marked [[tempo|Adagio]], is in a much calmer mood. The first two sections are meant to represent life, the last two death and [[Transfiguration (religion)|transfiguration]].\n\n[[Image:Berg - Violin Concerto lament melody.png|thumb|right|400px|\"lament\" melody and its construction from the pitches of RI-5 and P-8<ref>Whittall, Arnold. 2008.

New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-68200-8}} (pbk).</ref> {{audio|Berg - Violin Concerto lament melody.mid|Play}}]]\n\nLike a number of other works by Berg, the piece combines the [[twelve tone technique]], typical of [[Serialism|serialistic music]] learned from his teacher [[Arnold Schoenberg]] with passages written in a freer, more tonal style. The score integrates serialism and tonality in a remarkable fashion. Here is Berg's tone row:\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\new Staff \\with { \\remove \"Time_signature_engraver\" \\remove \"Bar_engraver\" } \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\override Stem #'transparent = ##t g4 bes d fis a c e gis b cis ees f } </score>\nAlthough this contains all twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]], there is a strong tonal undercurrent: the first three notes of the row make up a [[G minor]] [[Triad (music)|triad]]; notes three to five are a [[D major]] triad; notes five to seven are an [[A minor]] triad; notes seven to nine are an [[E major]] triad;\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> { \\new PianoStaff << \\new Staff \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\time 2/4 r8 <d bes>4( <d bes>8~ | <d bes> <d a>4 <d a>8~ | <d a>) <c a>4( <c a>8~ | <c a> <b e,>4 <b e,>8) } \\new Staff \\relative c { \\clef bass \\time 2/4 g,2( | fis' | e' | gis, } >> } </score>\nand the last four notes (B, C{{music|#}}, E{{music|b}}, F) and the first (G) together make up part of a [[whole tone scale]].

It is probably Berg's best-known and most frequently performed instrumental piece, in which the composer sought to reconcile [[diatonicism]] and [[dodecaphony]]. Berg composed it on a commission from [[Louis Krasner]], and it became the last work that he completed. Krasner performed the solo part in the premiere at the [[Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana]], [[Barcelona]] on 19 April 1936, after the composer's death.\n\n== Conception and composition ==\nThe piece stemmed from a commission from the [[violin]]ist [[Louis Krasner]]. When he first received the commission, Berg was working on his opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', and he did not begin work on the [[concerto]] for some months. The event that spurred him into writing was the death by polio of 18-year-old [[Manon Gropius]], the daughter of [[Alma Mahler]] (once [[Gustav Mahler]]'s wife) and [[Walter Gropius]]. Berg set ''Lulu'' aside to write the concerto, which he dedicated \"To the memory of an angel\".<ref name=\"Glass\" />\n\nBerg worked on the piece very quickly, completing it within a few months; it is thought that his working on the concerto was largely responsible for his failing to complete ''Lulu'' before his death on 24 December 1935. The violin concerto was the last work that Berg completed. In a letter to Krasner dated 16 July 1935, Berg confessed: {{quote|Yesterday I finished the composition [without the orchestration] of our Violin Concerto. I am probably more surprised by it than you will be (...) the work gave me more and more joy. I hope - no, I have the confident belief - that I have succeeded.{{cn|date=April 2020}}}}<!-- looked in ''Berg: Violin Concerto'' (1991) by Anthony Pople and Julian Rushton, but can't find it there -->\n\n== Scoring ==\n[[File:Louis Krasner (1903\u20131995) und Helene Berg (1885\u20131976) mit der Partitur des Violinkonzerts (1961) OeNB 657332.png|thumb|[[Louis Krasner|Krasner]] and Berg's widow [[:de:Helene Berg|Helene]] with the score (1961)]]\nThe concerto is scored for 2 [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (both doubling as [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s (one doubling as a [[cor anglais]]), [[alto saxophone]] (doubling as 3rd clarinet), 2 [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 4 [[French horn|horns]], 2 [[trumpet]]s, 2 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[percussion]], [[harp]] and [[string section|strings]].<ref name=\"Glass\">{{cite news\n |last         = Glass\n |first        = Herbert\n |url          = https://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/violin-concerto-alban-berg\n |title        = Violin Concerto \u2013 About the piece\n |publisher    = [[LA Phil]]\n |accessdate   = 2 November 2017\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20171107012243/https://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/violin-concerto-alban-berg\n |archive-date = 7 November 2017\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\nBerg described the structure of the concerto in a letter to [[Arnold Schoenberg]].<ref>Brand et al.

The second movement starts with an [[tempo|Allegro]] largely based on a single recurring [[rhythm]]ic [[cell (music)|cell]]; this section has been described as [[cadenza]]-like, with very difficult passages in the solo part. The orchestration becomes rather violent at its climax (which is literally marked in the score as \"High point of the Allegro\"); the fourth and final section, marked [[tempo|Adagio]], is in a much calmer mood. The first two sections are meant to represent life, the last two death and [[Transfiguration (religion)|transfiguration]].\n\n[[Image:Berg - Violin Concerto lament melody.png|thumb|right|400px|\"lament\" melody and its construction from the pitches of RI-5 and P-8<ref>Whittall, Arnold. 2008.

The score integrates serialism and tonality in a remarkable fashion. Here is Berg's tone row:\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\new Staff \\with { \\remove \"Time_signature_engraver\" \\remove \"Bar_engraver\" } \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\override Stem #'transparent = ##t g4 bes d fis a c e gis b cis ees f } </score>\nAlthough this contains all twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]], there is a strong tonal undercurrent: the first three notes of the row make up a [[G minor]] [[Triad (music)|triad]]; notes three to five are a [[D major]] triad; notes five to seven are an [[A minor]] triad; notes seven to nine are an [[E major]] triad;\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> { \\new PianoStaff << \\new Staff \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\time 2/4 r8 <d bes>4( <d bes>8~ | <d bes> <d a>4 <d a>8~ | <d a>) <c a>4( <c a>8~ | <c a> <b e,>4 <b e,>8) } \\new Staff \\relative c { \\clef bass \\time 2/4 g,2( | fis' | e' | gis, } >> } </score>\nand the last four notes (B, C{{music|#}}, E{{music|b}}, F) and the first (G) together make up part of a [[whole tone scale]].

Romania also joined Germany in the invasion of the [[Soviet Union]], initially with the purpose of regaining [[Bessarabia]], taken by Soviets in 1940, after the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]].\n\n==Organising the pogrom==\nIt was widely believed in interwar Romania that Communism was the work of the Jews, and Romania's coming entry into the war against the Soviet Union - a war billed as a struggle to \"annihilate\" the forces of \"Judeo-Bolshevism\"- greatly served to increase the anti-Semitic paranoia of the Romanian government.<ref>Ioanid, Radu \"The Holocaust in Romania: The Iasi Pogrom of June 1941\" pages 119-148 from ''Contemporary European History'',\nVolume 2, Issue # 2, July 1993 pages 121-122</ref> [[Operation Barbarossa]], as the invasion of the Soviet Union was code-named, was scheduled to begin on 22 June 1941. Ia\u0219i, a city with a large Jewish population located close to the Soviet border, was considered a problem by the Romanian dictator Marshal [[Ion Antonescu]], as he saw the Jews of Ia\u0219i as a fifth column which would sabotage the Romanian war effort.<ref>Ioanid, Radu \"The Holocaust in Romania: The Iasi Pogrom of June 1941\" pages 119-148 from ''Contemporary European History'',\nVolume 2, Issue # 2, July 1993 pages 122-123</ref> In mid-June 1941, Antonescu ordered that \"all the Judeo-Communist coffee shops in Moldavia be closed down, all kikes, Communist agents and sympathizers be identified by region...\".<ref name=\"Ioanid pages 119-148\">Ioanid, Radu \"The Holocaust in Romania: The Iasi Pogrom of June 1941\" pages 119-148 from ''Contemporary European History'', Volume 2, Issue # 2, July 1993 page 122</ref> On 21 June 1941, Antonescu signed a decree calling for all Jews between the ages of 18 and 60 who lived between the Siret and Pruth rivers to be deported to the concentration camp at [[T\u00e2rgu Jiu]] in the south of Romania.<ref name=\"Ioanid pages 119-148\"/> Officers of both the Romanian and German armies, poised to invade the Soviet Union, saw the Jews near the Soviet border as a major internal security threat and pressed the Romanian government to remove this alleged threat.<ref name=\"Ioanid pages 119-148\"/> Lieutenant-Colonel Traian Borcescu of the Special Information Service (''{{ill|Serviciul Special de Informa\u021bii|ro}}'', SSI), as the Romanian secret service was known, later recalled: \"I know for certain that Section II of the Supreme Headquarters was involved with the problem of moving the Jewish population in Moldavia under the auspices of the respective statistics offices, with Colonel Gheorghe Petrescu in charge of this activity\".<ref>Ioanid, Radu \"The Holocaust in Romania: The Iasi Pogrom of June 1941\" pages 119-148 from ''Contemporary European History'', Volume 2, Issue # 2, July 1993 pages 122-123</ref> Section II of the Romanian Supreme Headquarters was concerned with monitoring all political parties and all of the ethnic minorities in Romania.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Ioanid, Radu \"The Holocaust in Romania: The Iasi Pogrom of June 1941\" pages 119-148 from ''Contemporary European History'', Volume 2, Issue # 2, July 1993 page 123</ref> The responsibility for organising the pogrom rested with Section II, the SSI, and with the German ''[[Abwehr]]''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> After the invasion of the Soviet Union began on 22 June 1941, the SSI formed the First Operative Echelon of 160 men who were tasked with crushing any internal security threat that might hamper the war.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Colonel Borcescu recalled:\n\n<blockquote>One of the secret and unofficial aims of the expedition of the First Operative Echelon was to do away with the Moldavian Jews by deportation or extermination. For this purpose, SSI department head Florin Becescu-Georgescu, when leaving Bucharest, took along the files on the Jews and Communists. From Ia\u015fi, the Echelon drove to [[Chi\u015fin\u0103u]], where the Jews were massacred. The same SSI teams that operated in Ia\u015fi operated in Chi\u015fin\u0103u as well. The Echelon went also to [[Tighina]] and [[Tiraspol]], where it committed robberies and to [[Odessa]], where it committed massacres.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Ioanid, Radu \"The Holocaust in Romania: The Iasi Pogrom of June 1941\" pages 119-148 from ''Contemporary European History'', Volume 2, Issue # 2, July 1993 page 124</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn the same day that Operation Barbarossa began, the police force in Ia\u015fi released imprisoned members of the [[Iron Guard]], who had been held since a failed coup by the Legion in January 1941.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The newly freed Legionnaires were placed under police command and provided with weapons.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Since the Iron Guard was notorious for its virulent anti-semitism, the release of the imprisoned Iron Guard members suggested that the authorities were already planning to strike against the Jews of Ia\u015fi.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> On 24 June 1941, Ia\u015fi was bombed by the [[Soviet Air Force]]. The raid did little damage, but it produced a hysterical reaction, with rumors flying fast that the entire Jewish population of Ia\u015fi were Communist Party members and had lit beacons to guide the Soviet bombers.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> On 26 June, Ia\u015fi was again bombed and this time substantial damage was inflicted on the city.<ref>Ioanid, Radu \"The Holocaust in Romania: The Iasi Pogrom of June 1941\" pages 119-148 from ''Contemporary European History'', Volume 2, Issue # 2, July 1993 pages 124-125</ref> The second bombing killed about 600 people, of whom 38 were Jews.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Again, the bombing led to rampant rumors of alleged Jewish fifth column activity in the service of the Soviet Union.

On June 27, the authorities officially accused the Jewish community of sabotage, and assembled the soldiers and police who would spearhead the pogrom, where they were falsely told that Jews had attacked soldiers in the streets.<ref>Ioanid, Radu \"The Holocaust in Romania: The Iasi Pogrom of June 1941\" pages 119-148 from ''Contemporary European History'', Volume 2, Issue # 2, July 1993 pages 127-128.</ref>\n\nMarcel, a Jewish survivor from Ia\u0219i recounted,\n\n<blockquote>I remember that the real danger for the Jews started on June 29, 1941. It was a big surprise for all the Jews. We were forced to wear the yellow stars of David on our clothes. We could not buy or sell food anymore. For certain hours, we didn't have access to some public places. At that time there were cellars where Jews hid. It was difficult for the police to search the cellars. So, in order to make us come to the commissariat, they distributed a sort of ticket with the word \"Free\" written on it in a Jewish district. The Jews thought that if they showed up at the commissariat they could be set free, could again buy commodities.

Other participants were army soldiers, young people armed by SSI agents, and mobs who robbed and killed, knowing they would not have to account for their actions....In addition to informing on Jews, directing soldiers to Jewish homes and refuges, and even breaking into homes themselves, some Romanian residents of Ia\u015fi also took part in the arrests and humiliation forced upon the convoys of Jews on their way to the Chestura. The perpetrators included neighbors of Jews, known and lesser-known supporters of antisemitic movements, students, poorly-paid, low-level officials, railway workers, craftsmen frustrated by Jewish competition, \"white-collar\" workers, retirees and military veterans.<ref name=intcommissionch5>{{cite web|title=The Holocaust in Romania|url=http://www.ushmm.org/research/center/presentations/features/details/2005-03-10/pdf/english/chapter_05.pdf|publisher=International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania|access-date=4 April 2013|location=Bucharest, Romania|format=PDF|date=11 November 2004|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616061542/http://www.ushmm.org/research/center/presentations/features/details/2005-03-10/pdf/english/chapter_05.pdf|archive-date=16 June 2013|df=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSoon Romanian soldiers, police, and mobs started massacring Jews; at least 8,000 were killed in the initial pogrom.

This was the case with engineer Naum, a gentile, brother-in-law of Chief Public Prosecutor Casian. Naum, a former Assistant Professor of Medical Chemistry at the Ia\u0219i Institute of Hygiene, well-known in select circles as an eloquent defender of liberal views, attempted to save a Jew on Pacurari Street, outside the Ferdinand Foundation. The Romanian officer who was about to kill the Jew said to Naum, 'You dog, die with the kike you are defending!', and shot him point-blank. The priest Razmerita was shot on Sararie Street while attempting to save several Jews, dying with the victims he was trying to protect. While trying to defend some Jews on Zugravilor Street, outside ''Rampa'', the lathe operator Ioan Gheorghiu was killed by railroad workers.<ref>Ioanid, Radu \"The Holocaust in Romania: The Iasi Pogrom of June 1941\" pages 119-148 from ''Contemporary European History'', Volume 2, Issue # 2, July 1993 pages 132</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Italian journalist [[Curzio Malaparte]] who witnessed the pogrom first-hand wrote about how \"detachments of soldiers and gendarmes, groups of working men and women, groups of long-haired Gypsies squabbled, shouting with joy, as they undressed the corpses, lifted them and turned them over.\"<ref>Ioanid, Radu \"The Holocaust in Romania: The Iasi Pogrom of June 1941\" pages 119-148 from ''Contemporary European History'', Volume 2, Issue # 2, July 1993 pages 137.</ref>\n\n[[File:\u05e4\u05d5\u05d2\u05e8\u05d5\u05dd \u05d9\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9 5.jpg|thumb|right|Bodies being thrown down from the death train]]\n\nThe Romanian authorities also arrested more than 5,000 Jews, forcing them to the train station, shooting those who did not move quickly enough, and then robbing them of all of their possessions. Over 100 people were stuffed into each car. Many Jews died of thirst, starvation, and suffocation aboard two trains that for eight days travelled back and forth across the countryside.

On the night of 2 July 1941, after caring for the Romanian Army wounded coming from the Russian front, she overheard people moaning from a train transporting Jewish survivors of the Ia\u015fi pogrom. Taking advantage of her position, she asked and received permission to give food and water to those unfortunate passengers. Her actions were strongly condemned by the community of Roman and she had to move to [[Bucharest]]. Her story, as part of the story of the pogrom and its consequences, was vividly presented in the book \"Pogrom\", written by Eugen Luca. The book was originally published in Romanian, was then translated into both Hebrew and Czech, and can be found at Yad Vashem and at the Library of the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC.\n\nUnlike the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] evacuations and exterminations, which involved black-ops, secrecy and deceit, this pogrom was perpetrated in \"broad daylight\" by Romanian authorities and the Romanian Army on Romanian citizens of Jewish origin in Romania proper.\n\nIn contrast to the [[Vel' d'Hiv Roundup]] in the ''[[zone occup\u00e9e]]'' of France, where those arrested were transported to extermination camps in Nazi-occupied Poland, those arrested in the Ia\u0219i pogrom were not transported outside of the country.\n\n==War crimes trials==\n[[File:Ia\u0219i Pogrom Monument 1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The monument erected in Ia\u0219i in memory of the pogrom victims]]\n\nThe [[Romanian People's Tribunals]] were conducted in 1946 and a total of 57 people were tried for the Ia\u015fi pogroms: eight from the higher military echelons, the prefect of Ia\u015fi county and the mayor of Ia\u015fi, four military figures, 21 civilians and 22 gendarmes.

Romania also joined Germany in the invasion of the [[Soviet Union]], initially with the purpose of regaining [[Bessarabia]], taken by Soviets in 1940, after the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]].\n\n==Organising the pogrom==\nIt was widely believed in interwar Romania that Communism was the work of the Jews, and Romania's coming entry into the war against the Soviet Union - a war billed as a struggle to \"annihilate\" the forces of \"Judeo-Bolshevism\"- greatly served to increase the anti-Semitic paranoia of the Romanian government.<ref>Ioanid, Radu \"The Holocaust in Romania: The Iasi Pogrom of June 1941\" pages 119-148 from ''Contemporary European History'',\nVolume 2, Issue # 2, July 1993 pages 121-122</ref> [[Operation Barbarossa]], as the invasion of the Soviet Union was code-named, was scheduled to begin on 22 June 1941.

For this purpose, SSI department head Florin Becescu-Georgescu, when leaving Bucharest, took along the files on the Jews and Communists. From Ia\u015fi, the Echelon drove to [[Chi\u015fin\u0103u]], where the Jews were massacred. The same SSI teams that operated in Ia\u015fi operated in Chi\u015fin\u0103u as well.

The raid did little damage, but it produced a hysterical reaction, with rumors flying fast that the entire Jewish population of Ia\u015fi were Communist Party members and had lit beacons to guide the Soviet bombers.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> On 26 June, Ia\u015fi was again bombed and this time substantial damage was inflicted on the city.<ref>Ioanid, Radu \"The Holocaust in Romania: The Iasi Pogrom of June 1941\" pages 119-148 from ''Contemporary European History'', Volume 2, Issue # 2, July 1993 pages 124-125</ref> The second bombing killed about 600 people, of whom 38 were Jews.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Again, the bombing led to rampant rumors of alleged Jewish fifth column activity in the service of the Soviet Union.

For certain hours, we didn't have access to some public places. At that time there were cellars where Jews hid. It was difficult for the police to search the cellars. So, in order to make us come to the commissariat, they distributed a sort of ticket with the word \"Free\" written on it in a Jewish district. The Jews thought that if they showed up at the commissariat they could be set free, could again buy commodities.

This was the case with engineer Naum, a gentile, brother-in-law of Chief Public Prosecutor Casian. Naum, a former Assistant Professor of Medical Chemistry at the Ia\u0219i Institute of Hygiene, well-known in select circles as an eloquent defender of liberal views, attempted to save a Jew on Pacurari Street, outside the Ferdinand Foundation. The Romanian officer who was about to kill the Jew said to Naum, 'You dog, die with the kike you are defending!', and shot him point-blank. The priest Razmerita was shot on Sararie Street while attempting to save several Jews, dying with the victims he was trying to protect.

Over 100 people were stuffed into each car. Many Jews died of thirst, starvation, and suffocation aboard two trains that for eight days travelled back and forth across the countryside.

On the night of 2 July 1941, after caring for the Romanian Army wounded coming from the Russian front, she overheard people moaning from a train transporting Jewish survivors of the Ia\u015fi pogrom. Taking advantage of her position, she asked and received permission to give food and water to those unfortunate passengers. Her actions were strongly condemned by the community of Roman and she had to move to [[Bucharest]]. Her story, as part of the story of the pogrom and its consequences, was vividly presented in the book \"Pogrom\", written by Eugen Luca. The book was originally published in Romanian, was then translated into both Hebrew and Czech, and can be found at Yad Vashem and at the Library of the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC.\n\nUnlike the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] evacuations and exterminations, which involved black-ops, secrecy and deceit, this pogrom was perpetrated in \"broad daylight\" by Romanian authorities and the Romanian Army on Romanian citizens of Jewish origin in Romania proper.\n\nIn contrast to the [[Vel' d'Hiv Roundup]] in the ''[[zone occup\u00e9e]]'' of France, where those arrested were transported to extermination camps in Nazi-occupied Poland, those arrested in the Ia\u0219i pogrom were not transported outside of the country.\n\n==War crimes trials==\n[[File:Ia\u0219i Pogrom Monument 1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The monument erected in Ia\u0219i in memory of the pogrom victims]]\n\nThe [[Romanian People's Tribunals]] were conducted in 1946 and a total of 57 people were tried for the Ia\u015fi pogroms: eight from the higher military echelons, the prefect of Ia\u015fi county and the mayor of Ia\u015fi, four military figures, 21 civilians and 22 gendarmes.

Production began in 2005, and the copyrighted byline was created in July 2005.\n\nThe live action shorts illustrate and explain various concepts in [[math]] and [[science]], and show schoolchildren engaging in experiments, that teach the math or science concept featured in the previous story.\n\n==Settings==\n* The City: George and the Man with the Yellow Hat live in an apartment in \"The City\". The Doorman keeps a pigeon coop on the roof and is the guardian of Hundley, his dachshund dog. The apartment is near Endless Park, the museum where Professor Wiseman works, and a zoo. Chef Pisghetti's restaurant is nearby, as are a donut shop, Dulson's Toy Store, Mabel's Department Store (a parody of Macy's and its erstwhile competitor Gimbels), a supermarket and a pet shop. These are recurring locations.\n* The Country: George and the Man with the Yellow Hat vacation in a small house in the country. The house is near Lake Wanasink, a stream, and a river that eventually flows past the city and to the ocean. George is friends there with 5-year-old Allie and the teenage paperboy, Bill.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of Curious George characters}}\n* [[Curious George]] (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): A tailless [[monkey]] who is the [[protagonist]] of the show. He is excessively curious and often causes unintentional problems. He is used as the \"teachable\" character in the show, and he is the one to whom new concepts are explained in detail by the other characters. He is written as having the mind of a young child.\n* The Man with the Yellow Hat (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett (voice actor)|Jeff Bennett]]): The man who first befriended George and also acts as his primary teacher and mentor.

The Doorman keeps a pigeon coop on the roof and is the guardian of Hundley, his dachshund dog. The apartment is near Endless Park, the museum where Professor Wiseman works, and a zoo. Chef Pisghetti's restaurant is nearby, as are a donut shop, Dulson's Toy Store, Mabel's Department Store (a parody of Macy's and its erstwhile competitor Gimbels), a supermarket and a pet shop. These are recurring locations.\n* The Country: George and the Man with the Yellow Hat vacation in a small house in the country. The house is near Lake Wanasink, a stream, and a river that eventually flows past the city and to the ocean. George is friends there with 5-year-old Allie and the teenage paperboy, Bill.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of Curious George characters}}\n* [[Curious George]] (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): A tailless [[monkey]] who is the [[protagonist]] of the show. He is excessively curious and often causes unintentional problems. He is used as the \"teachable\" character in the show, and he is the one to whom new concepts are explained in detail by the other characters. He is written as having the mind of a young child.\n* The Man with the Yellow Hat (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett (voice actor)|Jeff Bennett]]): The man who first befriended George and also acts as his primary teacher and mentor.

When Jey walked into the store, he showed the shopkeeper an audio cassette of himself singing at the nightclub. The shopkeeper directed Jey to the sampling aisle of the store and called Massimo Gabutti, producer of the newly founded Bliss Corporation. Soon after, Jey was introduced to Gabutti and Roberto Molinaro at Bliss Corporation. Gabutti was impressed with Jey's demo tape, and immediately offered him a position at Bliss Corporation with Molinaro.\n\nJey was excited to be part of Bliss Corporation and when he returned home, he told his mother that he was going to go back to [[Turin]] and wouldn't be coming back home. Jey's mother was very surprised to hear the news. Feeling concerned about her son, she told his father the news and he decided to let him go, thinking that nothing would happen to him. Then Jey packed all of his possessions into a very big box and set off to Turin to move to his friends' house about 7 to 8 kilometers away from the studio. Jey's first day at Bliss Corporation was in January 1993, and working with him there were Gabutti, Molinaro, sound engineer Angelica Villella and 18 year old Maurizio Lobina. Two months after Jey's first day, while working on some songs, Gabutti told him about a demo that he had been working on with the other members and asked him to do the vocals for it. Jey agreed to do it. That track was a cover of Patti Smith's 1988 song \"People Have the Power\". Gabutti went to Milan to mix Jey's voice with the demo, and when he came back, he told him that the people of Milan loved his voice, and that it would be part of the final mix. Jey was absolutely astonished by the news, and loved the idea of having a song with his name on it. When Jey heard the song on the radio for the first time, he was very happy. \"People Have the Power\" was a big hit in Italy in the summer of 1993, peaking number 7 in charts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hitparadeitalia.it/hp_yends/hpe1993.htm|title=Hit Parade Italia - Top Annuali Single: 1993|website=www.hitparadeitalia.it|access-date=2018-06-06}}</ref>\n\nThe following year Domenico Capuano, Jeffrey Jey and Molinaro in the band.

In 2004 the Pittsburgh City Council announced commemoration of the 200th anniversary of Haiti's independence.<ref>[http://windowsonhaiti.com/windowsonhaiti/bicentennial/messages/790.html Message from State of Pennsylvania]</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oDN7aXyrUckC&pg=PA24&dq=little+haiti+pittsburgh+Hill+District+history#v=onepage&q=little%20haiti%20pittsburgh%20Hill%20District%20history&f=false |title=Pittsburgh in Stages: Two Hundred Years of Theater |author=Conner, Lynne |page=24 |year=2007 |isbn=9780822943303 |accessdate=15 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== The Great Migration ===\nBeginning in the 1910s, the Hill attracted migrants from elsewhere in the United States (particularly from the rural American South in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]) and from abroad. The neighborhood's black population grew rapidly from around 10,000 in 1890 to over 37,000 by 1920.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Lives of Their Own: Blacks, Italians, and Poles in Pittsburgh, 1900-1960|last=Bodnar|first=John|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1983|isbn=978-0252010637|location=Urbana|pages=30}}</ref> The influx of so many new residents resulted in a housing shortage which was exacerbated by the rigid system of segregation that limited potential dwellings for blacks almost entirely to the Hill District. The experience of young, single black men underscored the severity of the housing crisis. By virtue of housing segregation and their marital status, these men crammed into the limited number of units available in the district.<ref name=\":0\" /> The result was an epidemic of cramped boarding houses where workers slept in shifts, as one 1969 study showed when it stated:<blockquote>\"Men who work at night sleep during the day in the beds vacated by day workers. There is no space in these rooms, except for beds and as many of them are crowded in as can possibly be accommodated.\"</blockquote>\n\n=== Center of Culture (1920s-1950s) ===\nThe Hill developed a vibrant entertainment district that turned the area into a cultural hub for music, especially the jazz genre. Black entrepreneurs established and ran a large roster of nightspots that included nightclubs, bars, and gambling dens, all of which required a constant influx of musical acts to keep guests entertained.This concentration of entertainment spots along Wylie Avenue, Fullerton Street, and Center Avenue  provided ready venues for both famous national acts and upstart local artists to perform. A short list of the more well-known spots consisted of the following institutions:\n\n* The Crawford Grill\n* The Collins Inn\n* The Humming Bird\n* The Leader House\n* The ToonTown Hub\n* Derby Dan's \n* Harlem Bar\n* Musician's Club\n* Sawdust Trail\n* The Fullerton Inn<ref>{{Cite book|title=City At the Point: Essays on the Social History of Pittsburgh |chapter=Double Burden: The Black Experience in Pittsburgh |first=Lawrence |last=Glasco |editor-last=Hays|editor-first=Samuel P.|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=Pittsburgh|pages=76}}</ref>\n\nThe establishment of such robust entertainment infrastructure allowed for the proliferation of musical entertainment in the neighborhood, especially when it came to jazz.<ref name=\":1\">Harper, Colter. \"The Crossroads of the World\": A Social and Cultural History of Jazz in Pittsburgh's Hill District, 1920-1970.\" PhD Diss., The University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh: 2011. D-scholarship.</ref> Nationally known artists such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington made the Hill District a regular stop on national tours. In fact it was after a performance at the Lincoln Tavern that the nationally syndicated black-run newspaper \"The Pittsburgh Courier\" crowned Ellington \"the King of Jazz.\"<ref>{{cite news |work=The Pittsburgh Courier |title=The King of Jazz |date=9 Jul 1932 |page=16}}</ref>\n\nThe presence of such a vibrant entertainment district proved most instrumental to the development of Pittsburgh-reared jazz musicians. As historian Colter Harper notes, this thriving environment of entertainment venues served as a training ground for young innovators who needed regular employment to develop ideas and techniques, places in which to network with each other, audiences for feedback, and club managers to aid in accessing the music scene in other cities.<ref name=\":1\" />  The benefits of networking often showed themselves through mentor-ship opportunities, as famous musicians could provide young artists with crucial career and technical advice. This was the case with renowned Pittsburgh-reared jazz pianist Mary Lou Williams, whose distinct left-hand-dominated playing style could be traced back to her youthful interactions with touring vaudeville artist Jack Howard as he played shows in the city; Williams would later note that he gave her professional advice that \"would have taken me years and years to learn.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Soul on Soul: The Life and Music of Mary Lou Williams|last=Kernodle|first=Tammy|publisher=Northeastern University Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=25}}</ref>\n\nThe thriving musical culture which was endemic to the Hill for close to four decades led the neighborhood to be considered as \"the Crossroads of the World\" by [[Harlem Renaissance]] poet [[Claude McKay]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Taking its Bow|last = Klein|first = Barbara|date = Winter 2015|journal = Carnegie|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages=423\u201325}}</ref> That phrase would be popularized by radio DJ Mary Dee (Mary Dee Dudley), of WHOD Radio, Pittsburgh's only black radio station.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Benz|first1=Kate|title=Music in the Hill was a way of life until 'progress' silenced venues|url=http://triblive.com/aande/music/7660763-74/hill-district-crawford#axzz3ihlKDGBG|accessdate=13 August 2015|work=Triblive.com|date=February 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Economic decline===\nThe district had cultural vibrancy, and numerous successful entertainment venues and black-owned businesses, but much of the housing was aged and substandard. Following World War II, the federal government committed to upgrade housing across the nation, and in Pittsburgh, 95 acres of the Hill District were selected for redevelopment. In an article from 1943, [[George E. Evans]], a member of the City Council, reasoned that public-private redevelopment could provide significant employment to returning war veterans, while ameliorating what he saw as an area beset by deterioration and urban blight. He wrote, \n<blockquote>\"The Hill District of Pittsburgh is probably one of the most outstanding examples in Pittsburgh of neighborhood deterioration... There are 7,000 separate property owners; more than 10,000 dwelling units and in all more than 10,000 buildings. Approximately 90 per cent of the buildings in the area are sub-standard and have long outlived their usefulness, and so there would be no social loss if they were all destroyed.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=George E.|title=Here Is a Postwar Job for Pittsburgh... Transforming The Hill District|url=http://www.carnegielibrary.org/exhibit/neighborhoods/hill/hill_n41.html|accessdate=12 August 2015|work=Greater Pittsburgh|date=July\u2013August 1943|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910130313/http://carnegielibrary.org/exhibit/neighborhoods/hill/hill_n41.html|archivedate=10 September 2015}}</ref></blockquote>Much of older housing in cities still lacked indoor plumbing and other amenities considered basic; planners did not fully take into account the effects of the disruption of residents and social networks by wholesale redevelopment of urban areas.\n\nEvans represented the majority view of Pittsburgh politicians, including state representative [[Homer S. Brown]]. Born in West Virginia, Brown was the third African American to graduate from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] law school and was active in civic affairs. He established a law practice, became president of the local [[NAACP]] chapter, and served in the state legislature, supported by both black and white voters for eight consecutive terms. In the 1940s, working with [[David L. Lawrence|David Lawrence]], [[Richard King Mellon]], and other business leaders, Brown drafted legislation that opened the way to \"urban renewal\" in the Hill District. During the next decade, he authorized the relocation of 1,500 black families to make way for the Civic Arena.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Glasco|first1=Laurence|authorlink1=Double Burden: The Black Experience in Pittsburgh|editor1-last=Trotter, Jr.|editor1-first=Joe William|editor2-last=Ledell Smith|editor2-first=Eric|title=African Americans in Pennsylvania: Shifting Historical Perspectives|date=1997|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University|location=University Park, PA|pages=423\u201325}}</ref> He was elected as Allegheny County's first African-American judge, sitting in Pittsburgh.\n\nIn the summer of 1956, some 1,300 structures were razed, displacing about 1,500 families (more than 8000 residents), the great majority of whom were black.<ref name=\"The Hill District: History\"/> This cleared the way for the construction of the [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)|Civic Arena]] and adjacent parking, to support downtown events and attract major entertainment. But, the redevelopment severed the Hill District from surrounding neighborhoods, resulting in its dramatic economic decline. This structural problem was exacerbated by the decline of Pittsburgh's population more generally, as jobs disappeared due to industrial restructuring, and numerous middle-class residents moved out to newer suburban housing. Between 1950 and 1990, the Hill lost 71% of its residents (more than 38,000 individuals) <ref>{{cite web|last1=Stoker|first1=Susan E.|first2=Cecilia |last2= Robert|title=Hill District Community Plan|url=http://ucsur.pitt.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/HillDistrictCommuntyPlan_May291996.pdf|accessdate=12 August 2015|pages=Section 1, p. 4|date=1996}}</ref> and about 400 businesses, leaving the neighborhood hollowed out.<ref>Trotter, Joe W. & Day, Jared N.

In 2004 the Pittsburgh City Council announced commemoration of the 200th anniversary of Haiti's independence.<ref>[http://windowsonhaiti.com/windowsonhaiti/bicentennial/messages/790.html Message from State of Pennsylvania]</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oDN7aXyrUckC&pg=PA24&dq=little+haiti+pittsburgh+Hill+District+history#v=onepage&q=little%20haiti%20pittsburgh%20Hill%20District%20history&f=false |title=Pittsburgh in Stages: Two Hundred Years of Theater |author=Conner, Lynne |page=24 |year=2007 |isbn=9780822943303 |accessdate=15 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== The Great Migration ===\nBeginning in the 1910s, the Hill attracted migrants from elsewhere in the United States (particularly from the rural American South in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]) and from abroad. The neighborhood's black population grew rapidly from around 10,000 in 1890 to over 37,000 by 1920.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Lives of Their Own: Blacks, Italians, and Poles in Pittsburgh, 1900-1960|last=Bodnar|first=John|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1983|isbn=978-0252010637|location=Urbana|pages=30}}</ref> The influx of so many new residents resulted in a housing shortage which was exacerbated by the rigid system of segregation that limited potential dwellings for blacks almost entirely to the Hill District. The experience of young, single black men underscored the severity of the housing crisis. By virtue of housing segregation and their marital status, these men crammed into the limited number of units available in the district.<ref name=\":0\" /> The result was an epidemic of cramped boarding houses where workers slept in shifts, as one 1969 study showed when it stated:<blockquote>\"Men who work at night sleep during the day in the beds vacated by day workers. There is no space in these rooms, except for beds and as many of them are crowded in as can possibly be accommodated.\"</blockquote>\n\n=== Center of Culture (1920s-1950s) ===\nThe Hill developed a vibrant entertainment district that turned the area into a cultural hub for music, especially the jazz genre. Black entrepreneurs established and ran a large roster of nightspots that included nightclubs, bars, and gambling dens, all of which required a constant influx of musical acts to keep guests entertained.This concentration of entertainment spots along Wylie Avenue, Fullerton Street, and Center Avenue  provided ready venues for both famous national acts and upstart local artists to perform. A short list of the more well-known spots consisted of the following institutions:\n\n* The Crawford Grill\n* The Collins Inn\n* The Humming Bird\n* The Leader House\n* The ToonTown Hub\n* Derby Dan's \n* Harlem Bar\n* Musician's Club\n* Sawdust Trail\n* The Fullerton Inn<ref>{{Cite book|title=City At the Point: Essays on the Social History of Pittsburgh |chapter=Double Burden: The Black Experience in Pittsburgh |first=Lawrence |last=Glasco |editor-last=Hays|editor-first=Samuel P.|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=Pittsburgh|pages=76}}</ref>\n\nThe establishment of such robust entertainment infrastructure allowed for the proliferation of musical entertainment in the neighborhood, especially when it came to jazz.<ref name=\":1\">Harper, Colter. \"The Crossroads of the World\": A Social and Cultural History of Jazz in Pittsburgh's Hill District, 1920-1970.\" PhD Diss., The University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh: 2011. D-scholarship.</ref> Nationally known artists such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington made the Hill District a regular stop on national tours. In fact it was after a performance at the Lincoln Tavern that the nationally syndicated black-run newspaper \"The Pittsburgh Courier\" crowned Ellington \"the King of Jazz.\"<ref>{{cite news |work=The Pittsburgh Courier |title=The King of Jazz |date=9 Jul 1932 |page=16}}</ref>\n\nThe presence of such a vibrant entertainment district proved most instrumental to the development of Pittsburgh-reared jazz musicians. As historian Colter Harper notes, this thriving environment of entertainment venues served as a training ground for young innovators who needed regular employment to develop ideas and techniques, places in which to network with each other, audiences for feedback, and club managers to aid in accessing the music scene in other cities.<ref name=\":1\" />  The benefits of networking often showed themselves through mentor-ship opportunities, as famous musicians could provide young artists with crucial career and technical advice. This was the case with renowned Pittsburgh-reared jazz pianist Mary Lou Williams, whose distinct left-hand-dominated playing style could be traced back to her youthful interactions with touring vaudeville artist Jack Howard as he played shows in the city; Williams would later note that he gave her professional advice that \"would have taken me years and years to learn.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Soul on Soul: The Life and Music of Mary Lou Williams|last=Kernodle|first=Tammy|publisher=Northeastern University Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=25}}</ref>\n\nThe thriving musical culture which was endemic to the Hill for close to four decades led the neighborhood to be considered as \"the Crossroads of the World\" by [[Harlem Renaissance]] poet [[Claude McKay]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Taking its Bow|last = Klein|first = Barbara|date = Winter 2015|journal = Carnegie|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages=423\u201325}}</ref> That phrase would be popularized by radio DJ Mary Dee (Mary Dee Dudley), of WHOD Radio, Pittsburgh's only black radio station.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Benz|first1=Kate|title=Music in the Hill was a way of life until 'progress' silenced venues|url=http://triblive.com/aande/music/7660763-74/hill-district-crawford#axzz3ihlKDGBG|accessdate=13 August 2015|work=Triblive.com|date=February 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Economic decline===\nThe district had cultural vibrancy, and numerous successful entertainment venues and black-owned businesses, but much of the housing was aged and substandard. Following World War II, the federal government committed to upgrade housing across the nation, and in Pittsburgh, 95 acres of the Hill District were selected for redevelopment. In an article from 1943, [[George E. Evans]], a member of the City Council, reasoned that public-private redevelopment could provide significant employment to returning war veterans, while ameliorating what he saw as an area beset by deterioration and urban blight. He wrote, \n<blockquote>\"The Hill District of Pittsburgh is probably one of the most outstanding examples in Pittsburgh of neighborhood deterioration... There are 7,000 separate property owners; more than 10,000 dwelling units and in all more than 10,000 buildings. Approximately 90 per cent of the buildings in the area are sub-standard and have long outlived their usefulness, and so there would be no social loss if they were all destroyed.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=George E.|title=Here Is a Postwar Job for Pittsburgh... Transforming The Hill District|url=http://www.carnegielibrary.org/exhibit/neighborhoods/hill/hill_n41.html|accessdate=12 August 2015|work=Greater Pittsburgh|date=July\u2013August 1943|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910130313/http://carnegielibrary.org/exhibit/neighborhoods/hill/hill_n41.html|archivedate=10 September 2015}}</ref></blockquote>Much of older housing in cities still lacked indoor plumbing and other amenities considered basic; planners did not fully take into account the effects of the disruption of residents and social networks by wholesale redevelopment of urban areas.\n\nEvans represented the majority view of Pittsburgh politicians, including state representative [[Homer S. Brown]]. Born in West Virginia, Brown was the third African American to graduate from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] law school and was active in civic affairs. He established a law practice, became president of the local [[NAACP]] chapter, and served in the state legislature, supported by both black and white voters for eight consecutive terms. In the 1940s, working with [[David L. Lawrence|David Lawrence]], [[Richard King Mellon]], and other business leaders, Brown drafted legislation that opened the way to \"urban renewal\" in the Hill District. During the next decade, he authorized the relocation of 1,500 black families to make way for the Civic Arena.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Glasco|first1=Laurence|authorlink1=Double Burden: The Black Experience in Pittsburgh|editor1-last=Trotter, Jr.|editor1-first=Joe William|editor2-last=Ledell Smith|editor2-first=Eric|title=African Americans in Pennsylvania: Shifting Historical Perspectives|date=1997|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University|location=University Park, PA|pages=423\u201325}}</ref> He was elected as Allegheny County's first African-American judge, sitting in Pittsburgh.\n\nIn the summer of 1956, some 1,300 structures were razed, displacing about 1,500 families (more than 8000 residents), the great majority of whom were black.<ref name=\"The Hill District: History\"/> This cleared the way for the construction of the [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)|Civic Arena]] and adjacent parking, to support downtown events and attract major entertainment. But, the redevelopment severed the Hill District from surrounding neighborhoods, resulting in its dramatic economic decline. This structural problem was exacerbated by the decline of Pittsburgh's population more generally, as jobs disappeared due to industrial restructuring, and numerous middle-class residents moved out to newer suburban housing. Between 1950 and 1990, the Hill lost 71% of its residents (more than 38,000 individuals) <ref>{{cite web|last1=Stoker|first1=Susan E.|first2=Cecilia |last2= Robert|title=Hill District Community Plan|url=http://ucsur.pitt.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/HillDistrictCommuntyPlan_May291996.pdf|accessdate=12 August 2015|pages=Section 1, p. 4|date=1996}}</ref> and about 400 businesses, leaving the neighborhood hollowed out.<ref>Trotter, Joe W. & Day, Jared N.
