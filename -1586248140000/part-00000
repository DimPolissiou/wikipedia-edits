She returned to France in August 1944.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fr.unesco.org/70years/construire_paix|title=Construire la paix dans l'esprit des hommes et des femmes \u2013 La mission de l'UNESCO|last=|first=|date=|website=UNESCO|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> In 1954, Jeannine Manuel founded the Ecole Active Bilingue in a former townhouse on Avenue de La Bourdonnais in Paris. For Jeannine Manuel, the aim of education was to help shape \u201cwhole\u201d people, by which she meant, \u201cindividuals aware of their presence in this world, engaged in its history, and ready to play a part in world affairs\u201d.\n\n=== Expansion ===\nThe school opened its doors in September 1954 with 9 students enrolled, a number that grew to 100 by January 1955. The school continued growing at such a rate that, by 1960, there was a lack of available space to accommodate its growing student body.\n\nJeannine Manuel consequently created special bilingual classes for her secondary students and teachers at the Lyc\u00e9e de S\u00e8vres in collaboration with her friend, Edm\u00e9e Hatinguais, who was Inspector General, former head of the [[\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de jeunes filles|\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de jeunes filles de S\u00e8vres]], and the first director of the International Center for Pedagogical Studies ([[:fr:Centre international d'\u00e9tudes p\u00e9dagogiques|Centre international d\u2019\u00e9tudes p\u00e9dagogiques]]). The bilingual curriculum and pedagogical approach offered at the Lyc\u00e9e de S\u00e8vres closely mirrored that developed by Jeannine Manuel.\n\nA few years later, Jeannine Manuel opened a new school near Parc Monceau with the help of a new investor. However, in 1979, a conflict between a need for return on investment and Jeannine Manuel's pedagogical principles led to an official split between the two schools. Jeannine Manuel consequently left the school on the Parisian right bank but kept the two small schools on Avenue de la Bourdonnais and Avenue de Suffren. Jeannine Manuel opened another school on 70 Rue du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre in the [[15th arrondissement of Paris]]\n\nIn 1999, at Jeannine Manuel's behest, her eldest son Bernard Manuel regrouped the recently opened school in [[Marcq-en-Bar\u0153ul|Marcq-en-Baroeul (Lille)]] and the new Dupleix site in Paris into a single non-profit association together with the other pre-existing schools. Bernard Manuel remains president of the association.\n\n=== Creation of the Fondation Jeannine Manuel ===\nIn 2004, one year after Jeannine Manuel's death, the Fondation Jeannine Manuel was established under the patronage of the [[Fondation de France]]. The Fondation's mission is to support \u00c9cole Jeannine Manuel and to encourage the development of other schools with a similar mission and pedagogical approach. They host a [https://www.ecolejeanninemanuel.org/fr/news-tous/item/984-gala-fondation-2019.html gala] every year.\n\n=== School renamed in honor of Jeannine Manuel ===\nIn 2014, on the occasion of its sixtieth birthday, the school was officially renamed \u00c9cole Jeannine Manuel. This was also because there was a court case at this time between the two schools, and both [https://eibparis.com/en/eib-monceau-primary-school/ EIB] and EJM were told to change their names (they were previously both called EAB)\n\n=== \u00c9cole Jeannine Manuel opens its doors in London ===\nIn 2015, with the financial support of the Foundation and in honor of Jeannine Manuel's formative years in London, the school opened its first site in Bedford Square, London<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.londonpreprep.com/2015/11/ecole-jeannine-manuel/|title=A visit to \u00c9cole Jeannine Manuel, a new bilingual international school in Central London|last=November 7|last2=2015|date=2015-11-07|website=London's Top Schools|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref>.

She returned to France in August 1944.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fr.unesco.org/70years/construire_paix|title=Construire la paix dans l'esprit des hommes et des femmes \u2013 La mission de l'UNESCO|last=|first=|date=|website=UNESCO|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> In 1954, Jeannine Manuel founded the Ecole Active Bilingue in a former townhouse on Avenue de La Bourdonnais in Paris. For Jeannine Manuel, the aim of education was to help shape \u201cwhole\u201d people, by which she meant, \u201cindividuals aware of their presence in this world, engaged in its history, and ready to play a part in world affairs\u201d.\n\n=== Expansion ===\nThe school opened its doors in September 1954 with 9 students enrolled, a number that grew to 100 by January 1955. The school continued growing at such a rate that, by 1960, there was a lack of available space to accommodate its growing student body.\n\nJeannine Manuel consequently created special bilingual classes for her secondary students and teachers at the Lyc\u00e9e de S\u00e8vres in collaboration with her friend, Edm\u00e9e Hatinguais, who was Inspector General, former head of the [[\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de jeunes filles|\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de jeunes filles de S\u00e8vres]], and the first director of the International Center for Pedagogical Studies ([[:fr:Centre international d'\u00e9tudes p\u00e9dagogiques|Centre international d\u2019\u00e9tudes p\u00e9dagogiques]]). The bilingual curriculum and pedagogical approach offered at the Lyc\u00e9e de S\u00e8vres closely mirrored that developed by Jeannine Manuel.\n\nA few years later, Jeannine Manuel opened a new school near Parc Monceau with the help of a new investor. However, in 1979, a conflict between a need for return on investment and Jeannine Manuel's pedagogical principles led to an official split between the two schools. Jeannine Manuel consequently left the school on the Parisian right bank but kept the two small schools on Avenue de la Bourdonnais and Avenue de Suffren. Jeannine Manuel opened another school on 70 Rue du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre in the [[15th arrondissement of Paris]]\n\nIn 1999, at Jeannine Manuel's behest, her eldest son Bernard Manuel regrouped the recently opened school in [[Marcq-en-Bar\u0153ul|Marcq-en-Baroeul (Lille)]] and the new Dupleix site in Paris into a single non-profit association together with the other pre-existing schools. Bernard Manuel remains president of the association.\n\n=== Creation of the Fondation Jeannine Manuel ===\nIn 2004, one year after Jeannine Manuel's death, the Fondation Jeannine Manuel was established under the patronage of the [[Fondation de France]].

The British were attempting to deliver a [[Malta Convoys|convoy]] from [[Gibraltar]] to [[Malta]]. The convoy was escorted by several battleships and an aircraft carrier, to deter interference from the Italian surface fleet, while a close escort of cruisers and destroyers provided an anti-aircraft screen.\n\nThe Italian fleet sortied after the convoy was detected, but turned back after learning the strength of the escorting force. Air attacks by Italian bombers and fighters damaged several ships, and forced one of the merchant vessels to be scuttled.

Malta had recently received 27 long-range fighters (22 [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s and 5 [[Bristol Blenheim]]s), which had been bombing and strafing Italian airfields on Sicily and Sardinia, and would provide air cover for the convoy after Force H retired before reaching the Sicilian narrows.<ref name=g&m>Greene & Massignani, pp.182-187</ref>\n\n==Italian forces==\nItalian submarines deployed to ambush the British battleships thought to be planning a bombardment raid against the Italian coast. [[Marcello class submarine#Dandolo|''Dandolo'']], [[Italian submarine Adua|''Adua'']] and [[Italian submarine Turchese|''Turchese'']] patrolled south of [[Ibiza]] while [[Italian submarine Axum|''Axum'']], ''Serpente'', [[Italian submarine Aradam|''Aradam'']] and [[Italian submarine Diaspro|''Diaspro'']] patrolled east of the [[Balearic Islands]]. ''Squalo'', ''Bandiera'' and [[Italian submarine Delfino (1930)|''Delfino'']] patrolled Southwest of Sardinia and ''Narvalo'' was off the African shore of the Sicilian narrows. Light cruisers [[Italian cruiser Muzio Attendolo|''Muzio Attendolo'']] and [[Italian cruiser Duca degli Abruzzi|''Duca degli Abruzzi'']] of the 8th cruiser division sailed from [[Palermo]] with [[Maestrale-class destroyer]]s ''Maestrale'', ''Grecale'' and ''Scirocco'' of the 10th destroyer flotilla to take position off [[La Maddalena]]. Battleships [[Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto|''Vittorio Veneto'']] and [[Italian battleship Littorio|''Littorio'']] were prepared to sortie from [[Naples]] with [[Soldati-class destroyer|''Granatiere'']], [[Soldati-class destroyer|''Fuciliere'']], [[Soldati-class destroyer|''Bersagliere'']] and [[Oriani-class destroyer|''Gioberti'']] of the 13th flotilla, and [[Italian destroyer Nicoloso da Recco|''Nicoloso da Recco'']], [[Navigatori-class destroyer|''Pessagno'']] and [[Folgore-class destroyer|''Folgore'']] of the 16th flotilla while cruisers [[Italian cruiser Trieste|''Trieste'']], [[Italian cruiser Trento|''Trento'']] and [[Italian cruiser Gorizia|''Gorizia'']] from [[Taranto]] with [[Soldati-class destroyer|''Corazziere'']], [[Soldati-class destroyer|''Carabiniere'']], [[Soldati-class destroyer|''Ascari'']] and [[Soldati-class destroyer|''Lanciere'']] of the 12th flotilla prepared to join them. Sardinia deployed thirty [[Macchi C.200]], twenty [[Fiat CR.42]] and twenty-six [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]] and [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.84|SM.84]] torpedo bombers against the convoy while Sicily deployed fifteen C.200, three [[Reggiane Re.2000]], and nine [[Junkers Ju 87]] with twenty-four [[Fiat BR.20]], SM.79 and SM.84 as high-level bombers and plus three with torpedoes. More Italian aircraft were operational, but were assigned other missions including bombing Malta.<ref name=g&m/>\n\n==Prelude==\nShips of the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] operating from [[Alexandria]] began making heavy radio traffic in the hope of diverting ''Luftwaffe'' attention to possible preparations for a major operation in the eastern Mediterranean. On 24 September Admiral Somerville shifted his flag from ''Nelson'' to ''Rodney'' and ''Nelson'' sailed west into the [[Atlantic]] at 18:15 escorted by ''Garland'', ''Piorun'' and ''Isaac Sweers'' to give the impression the strength of Force H was being reduced. ''Nelson'' turned back after dusk to join the merchant ships from convoy WS 11X, now redesignated convoy GM 2 as the second convoy from '''G'''ibraltar to '''M'''alta. Force H separated from the merchant ships in the early hours of 25 September so [[Axis powers|Axis]] aerial reconnaissance might think only Force H was at sea. Fulmars from ''Ark Royal'' provided air cover over the convoy.<ref name=g&m/>\n\nItalian aircraft found Force H on the afternoon of 25 September, and assumed the battleships were on a bombardment raid against the Italian coast. A [[CANT Z.506]] seaplane observing Force H at 09:32 on 26 September reported a single battleship with an aircraft carrier incorrectly identified as {{HMS|Furious|47|6}}. Since ''Ark Royal'' had been seen leaving Gibraltar, the Italians assumed ''Furious'' might be flying off aircraft to reinforce Malta while ''Ark Royal'' attacked [[Genoa]]. The Italian fleet sailed from Naples to take a defensive position with the 8th cruiser division off northern Sardinia, but was ordered not to engage the British fleet unless the Italians held a decisive superiority of forces.<ref name=g&m/>\n\n==Battle of 27 September==\nForce H rejoined the convoy at 07:10 27 September. Sixteen destroyers formed a bent line screen ahead of two columns of merchant ships. The port column was led by the cruiser ''Kenya'', followed by ''Ajax'', ''Clan MacDonald'', ''Imperial Star'', ''Rowallan Castle'' and ''City of Calcutta''. The starboard column was led by the cruiser ''Edinburgh'' followed by ''Clan Ferguson'', {{MV|Dunedin Star}}, HMS ''Breconshire'' and ''City of Lincoln''. ''Rodney'' took position behind the port wing of the screen followed by ''Prince of Wales''. ''Nelson'' took position behind the starboard wing of the screen followed by ''Ark Royal'' in formation with the [[Dido-class cruiser|anti-aircraft cruisers]] ''Euryalus'' and ''Hermione''. The cruiser ''Sheffield'' took position astern of the merchant ships, while the destroyers ''Piorun'' and ''Legion'' assumed [[plane guard]] positions astern of ''Ark Royal''.<ref>Greene & Massignani, p.186</ref>\n\nItalian aircraft correctly identified ''Ark Royal'' at 08:10, and at 10:45 reported the convoy speed of {{convert|16|knot|kph}}, which indicated that merchant ships were with the convoy. The battleships from Naples rendezvoused with the cruisers from Taranto at 10:40, and were joined by the 8th cruiser division at 11:48. The Italian fleet was faster than the battleships of Force H, but was inferior to the British force in firepower. The ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' gave priority to fighter defence of bomber strikes, and the six fighters providing air cover over the Italian fleet could not travel more than {{convert|100|km|mi}} from their base. Since Italian aircraft had reported only a single British battleship, the Italian fleet received authorization at noon to engage the British formation. The ''Regia Aeronautica'' was requested to provide increased air cover for the Italian fleet by 14:00.<ref name=g&m2>Greene & Massignani, pp.187-191</ref>\n\nThe ''Regia Aeronautica'' launched a strike of 28 SM.79 and SM.84 torpedo planes with 20 Cr.42 fighters. The convoy came under air attack at 13:00. The strike was met by defending Fulmars and heavy anti-aircraft fire. Three bombers pressed through the barrage of starboard wing destroyers to launch torpedoes at ''Nelson''. ''Nelson'' turned to comb the torpedo tracks, and inadvertently steadied on the reciprocal course of a torpedo which struck the port side of the [[forecastle]].<ref>''The Royal Navy and the Mediterranean Convoys'', p.21. This account states that the torpedo attacks were carried out by [[SM-79]] and [[Fiat BR.20|BR-20]] torpedo bombers.</ref> ''Nelson'' slowed to 15 knots, but maintained position in the convoy. The Italian plane had released the torpedo at a range of only {{convert|450|yd|m}} and endured concentrated anti-aircraft fire from ''Prince of Wales'' before being shot down by one of the Fulmars. Six more torpedo planes and 1 fighter failed to return from the strike. [[Friendly fire]] from ''Rodney'' and ''Prince of Wales'' shot down two Fulmars, and a patrolling Swordfish had been shot down by the Italian fighters before the strike ended at 13:30.<ref name=g&m2/>\n\nThe Italian fleet was shadowed by British aircraft from Malta beginning at 13:07. At 14:30 the Italian fleet was about 40 miles from the convoy, but \"...decided to return home around 14:30 on the 27th when...\" it \"... learned that the British had two battleships, a carrier and six cruisers at sea.\"<ref>''The Italian Navy in WW2'', Sadkovich, p.181: \"He therefore decided to return home around 14:30 on the 27th when he learned that the British had two battleships, a carrier and six cruisers at sea.\"</ref> Aircraft from ''Ark Royal'' shadowed the Italian fleet from 15:15 to 17:50. Cr.42 fighters arrived at 15:30 to provide air cover, but the squadron leader of the first flight was shot down by friendly fire from an Italian destroyer. Two more Italian pilots were lost when another flight of ten C.200s ran out of fuel and ditched at sea. At 14:46 ''Prince of Wales'', ''Rodney'', ''Sheffield'', ''Edinburgh'', and six destroyers steamed toward the Italian fleet; but were recalled at 17:00 before making contact, and rejoined the convoy at 18:30.<ref>''The Royal Navy and the Mediterranean Convoys'', p.28</ref> ''Nelson'', ''Rodney'', ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Ark Royal'' turned west to return to Gibraltar escorted by ''Duncan'', ''Fury'', ''Gurkha'', ''Lance'', ''Legion'', ''Lively''. ''Garland'', ''Piorun'', and ''Isaac Sweers''. ''Euryalus'' fell in astern of the port column of merchant ships while ''Sheffield'' and ''Hermione'' joined the starboard column as the remaining destroyers closed into a night steaming formation. The night steaming formation was attacked by a few torpedo bombers, and ''Imperial Star'' was struck by a single torpedo. ''Oribi'' took the damaged freighter in tow. Italian [[MAS (boat)|''Motoscafo armato silurante'']] (MAS torpedo boats) deployed through the Strait of Messina, but failed to find the convoy.<ref name=g&m2/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n''Hermione'' detached from the convoy to bombard [[Pantelleria]] so that airfield would be out of action when the convoy arrived in Malta. The damaged ''Imperial Star'' was scuttled without loss of life to maintain convoy speed of advance, and the convoy arrived in Malta on 28 September. Retiring Force H was attacked by three submarines; and ''Adua'' was sunk by ''Gurkha'' and ''Legion''. Another ''Ark Royal'' Fulmar fell to friendly fire from ''Prince of Wales'', raising British aircraft losses to three Fulmars from friendly fire and one Swordfish from enemy action.<ref name=g&m2/> Italian aircraft losses were 21 including seven bombers and one fighter from enemy action, one fighter from friendly fire, and ten fighters from fuel exhaustion.<ref>''The Italian Navy in WW2'', Sadkovich, p.182</ref>\n\nAdmiral Somerville was knighted in recognition of his successful command of Force H during Operation Halberd. It was the second time Somerville had received that honour, and it occasioned a memorable congratulatory message from [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Admiral Cunningham]]: \"Fancy, twice a knight at your age.\"<ref>Greene & Massignani, p.191</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Battle of the Mediterranean]]\n* [[Malta Convoys]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |last=Hague |first=Arnold |authorlink = |title =The Allied Convoy System 1939\u20131945 |publisher =Naval Institute Press |volume = |edition = |date =2000 |location =Annapolis, Maryland |pages = |isbn =1-55750-019-3}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Greene |first1=Jack |last2=Massignani |first2=Alessandro |authorlink = |title =The Naval War in the Mediterranean 1940\u20131943 |publisher =Chatham Publishing |volume = |edition = |date =1998 |location =London |pages = |isbn =1-885119-61-5}}\n* [http://www.merlinsovermalta.com/ Merlins over Malta]\n* [http://www.naval-history.net/WW2CampaignsMaltaConvoys.htm Malta Convoys]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091215084028/http://freespace.virgin.net/e.gilroy/ The story of HMS Lightning - a WW2 destroyer ]\n* [http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/LondonGazette/38377.pdf MEDITERRANEAN CONVOY OPERATIONS] ([[London Gazette]])\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Operation Halberd}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it3pOYM0JkA Newsreel footage of Operation Halberd, as filmed from HMS ''Prince of Wales'']\n\n{{coord|37.5167|N|10.7667|E|source:kolossus-fiwiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Halberd}}\n[[Category:Aerial operations and battles of World War II]]\n[[Category:Malta Convoys]]\n[[Category:Allied naval victories in the battle of the Mediterranean]]\n[[Category:Naval battles and operations of World War II involving the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:September 1941 events]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2016}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n|conflict= Operation ''Halberd''\n|partof= the [[Battle of the Mediterranean]] of [[World War II]]\n|image= The Royal Navy during the Second World War A5634.jpg\n|image_size= 300px\n|caption= An Italian torpedo bomber on fire and crashing during Operation ''Halberd'', just beyond is {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}}\n|date= 27 September 1941\n|place=[[Mediterranean Sea]], southwest of [[Calabria]]\n|result=British victory\n|combatant1={{flag|United Kingdom}}<br>{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Dutch government-in-exile|Netherlands]]<br/>{{flagicon|POL}} [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Poland]]\n|combatant2={{flagcountry|Kingdom of Italy}}\n|commander1={{flagicon|United Kingdom|naval}} [[James Somerville]]\n|commander2={{flagicon|Kingdom of Italy}} [[Angelo Iachino]]\n|units1=[[Force H]]\n|units2=[[Regia Marina]]<br>[[Regia Aeronautica]]\n|strength1=1 aircraft carrier<br>12 bombers<br>54 fighters<br>3 battleships<br>5 cruisers<br>18 destroyers<br>8 submarines<br>9 transport ships\n|strength2=62 bombers<br>68 fighters<br>2 battleships<br>5 cruisers<br>14 destroyers<br>11 submarines<br>8 torpedo boats\n|casualties1=1 battleship damaged<br>1 merchant scuttled<br>4 aircraft\n|casualties2=1 submarine<br>21 aircraft\n|campaignbox={{Campaignbox Mediterranean Campaign}}\n}}\n\n'''Operation Halberd''' was a British naval operation that took place on 27 September 1941, during the [[Second World War]]. The British were attempting to deliver a [[Malta Convoys|convoy]] from [[Gibraltar]] to [[Malta]]. The convoy was escorted by several battleships and an aircraft carrier, to deter interference from the Italian surface fleet, while a close escort of cruisers and destroyers provided an anti-aircraft screen.\n\nThe Italian fleet sortied after the convoy was detected, but turned back after learning the strength of the escorting force. Air attacks by Italian bombers and fighters damaged several ships, and forced one of the merchant vessels to be scuttled. The rest of the convoy arrived at Malta and discharged their cargo.\n\n==The convoy==\nOperation Halberd was at the time the largest Malta resupply effort of the war.<ref>Greene & Massignani, p.181</ref> Nine merchant ships carrying 81,000 tons of military equipment and supplies sailed from [[Liverpool]] on 16 September and from the [[River Clyde|Clyde]] on 17 September as part of convoy WS ('''W'''inston '''S'''pecials) 11X, passing Gibraltar on 24 September 1941, with a close escort under the command of Rear-Admiral [[Harold Burrough]].<ref>Hague, p.195</ref> The nine ships were:<ref>[http://www.naval-history.net/xAH-WSConvoys04-1941B.htm WS CONVOYS - July to December 1941 SAILINGS, including two DM Convoys, WS 10 to 14B]</ref>\n*{{MV|Breconshire}} ({{GRT|9776}}) 'Convoy Commodore' Auxiliary Supply Ship\n*{{MV|Ajax|1931|2}} ({{GRT|7549}}) [[Blue Funnel Line]]\n*{{SS|City of Calcutta|1940|2}} ({{GRT|8063}}) [[Ellerman Lines|Ellerman's City Line]]\n*{{SS|City of Lincoln|1938|2}} ({{GRT|8039}}) [[Ellerman Lines|Ellerman & Bucknall]]\n*{{SS|Clan Ferguson||2}} ({{GRT|7347}}) [[Clan Line]]\n*{{SS|Clan MacDonald||2}} ({{GRT|9653}}) Clan Line\n*{{MV|Dunedin Star||2}} ({{GRT|12891}}) [[Blue Star Line]]\n*{{MV|Imperial Star||2}} ({{GRT|12427}}) Blue Star Line\n*{{MV|Rowallan Castle||2}} ({{GRT|7798}}) [[Union-Castle Line]]\n\n==British forces==\n[[Force H]], under the command of Admiral [[James Somerville]], accompanied the convoy as defence against Italian surface ships. Force H consisted of the [[battleship]]s {{HMS|Nelson|28|6}}, {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}} and {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|2}} with the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}} operating 12 [[Fairey Swordfish]] and 27 [[Fairey Fulmar]]s of [[807 Naval Air Squadron|807]] and [[808 Naval Air Squadron]]s. Force H included [[cruiser]]s {{HMS|Kenya|14|6}}, {{HMS|Edinburgh|16|2}}, {{HMS|Sheffield|C24|2}}, {{HMS|Euryalus|42|2}} and {{HMS|Hermione|74|2}}, and was screened by [[destroyer]]s [[HNLMS Isaac Sweers (1940)|HNLMS ''Isaac Sweers'']], [[HMS Garland (H37)|ORP ''Garland'']] and {{ship|ORP|Piorun|G65|6}}, and {{HMS|Duncan|D99|6}}, {{HMS|Farndale|L70|2}}, {{HMS|Foresight|H68|2}}, {{HMS|Forester|H74|2}}, {{HMS|Fury|H76|2}}, {{HMS|Heythrop|L85|2}}, {{HMS|Laforey|G99|2}}, {{HMS|Lance|G87|2}}, {{HMS|Legion|G74|2}}, {{HMS|Lightning|G55|2}}, {{HMS|Lively|G40|2}}, {{HMS|Oribi|G66|2}}, {{HMS|Cossack|F03|2}}, {{HMS|Gurkha|G63|2}} and {{HMS|Zulu|F18|2}}.

The Polish submarine {{ship|ORP|Sok\u00f3\u0142|1940|6}} patrolled north of [[Sicily]] with {{HMS|Urge||6}} and {{HMS|Upholder|P37|2}} while the Dutch submarine {{ship|HNLMS|O 21}} patrolled south of [[Sardinia]]. Malta had recently received 27 long-range fighters (22 [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s and 5 [[Bristol Blenheim]]s), which had been bombing and strafing Italian airfields on Sicily and Sardinia, and would provide air cover for the convoy after Force H retired before reaching the Sicilian narrows.<ref name=g&m>Greene & Massignani, pp.182-187</ref>\n\n==Italian forces==\nItalian submarines deployed to ambush the British battleships thought to be planning a bombardment raid against the Italian coast. [[Marcello class submarine#Dandolo|''Dandolo'']], [[Italian submarine Adua|''Adua'']] and [[Italian submarine Turchese|''Turchese'']] patrolled south of [[Ibiza]] while [[Italian submarine Axum|''Axum'']], ''Serpente'', [[Italian submarine Aradam|''Aradam'']] and [[Italian submarine Diaspro|''Diaspro'']] patrolled east of the [[Balearic Islands]]. ''Squalo'', ''Bandiera'' and [[Italian submarine Delfino (1930)|''Delfino'']] patrolled Southwest of Sardinia and ''Narvalo'' was off the African shore of the Sicilian narrows. Light cruisers [[Italian cruiser Muzio Attendolo|''Muzio Attendolo'']] and [[Italian cruiser Duca degli Abruzzi|''Duca degli Abruzzi'']] of the 8th cruiser division sailed from [[Palermo]] with [[Maestrale-class destroyer]]s ''Maestrale'', ''Grecale'' and ''Scirocco'' of the 10th destroyer flotilla to take position off [[La Maddalena]]. Battleships [[Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto|''Vittorio Veneto'']] and [[Italian battleship Littorio|''Littorio'']] were prepared to sortie from [[Naples]] with [[Soldati-class destroyer|''Granatiere'']], [[Soldati-class destroyer|''Fuciliere'']], [[Soldati-class destroyer|''Bersagliere'']] and [[Oriani-class destroyer|''Gioberti'']] of the 13th flotilla, and [[Italian destroyer Nicoloso da Recco|''Nicoloso da Recco'']], [[Navigatori-class destroyer|''Pessagno'']] and [[Folgore-class destroyer|''Folgore'']] of the 16th flotilla while cruisers [[Italian cruiser Trieste|''Trieste'']], [[Italian cruiser Trento|''Trento'']] and [[Italian cruiser Gorizia|''Gorizia'']] from [[Taranto]] with [[Soldati-class destroyer|''Corazziere'']], [[Soldati-class destroyer|''Carabiniere'']], [[Soldati-class destroyer|''Ascari'']] and [[Soldati-class destroyer|''Lanciere'']] of the 12th flotilla prepared to join them. Sardinia deployed thirty [[Macchi C.200]], twenty [[Fiat CR.42]] and twenty-six [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]] and [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.84|SM.84]] torpedo bombers against the convoy while Sicily deployed fifteen C.200, three [[Reggiane Re.2000]], and nine [[Junkers Ju 87]] with twenty-four [[Fiat BR.20]], SM.79 and SM.84 as high-level bombers and plus three with torpedoes. More Italian aircraft were operational, but were assigned other missions including bombing Malta.<ref name=g&m/>\n\n==Prelude==\nShips of the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] operating from [[Alexandria]] began making heavy radio traffic in the hope of diverting ''Luftwaffe'' attention to possible preparations for a major operation in the eastern Mediterranean. On 24 September Admiral Somerville shifted his flag from ''Nelson'' to ''Rodney'' and ''Nelson'' sailed west into the [[Atlantic]] at 18:15 escorted by ''Garland'', ''Piorun'' and ''Isaac Sweers'' to give the impression the strength of Force H was being reduced. ''Nelson'' turned back after dusk to join the merchant ships from convoy WS 11X, now redesignated convoy GM 2 as the second convoy from '''G'''ibraltar to '''M'''alta. Force H separated from the merchant ships in the early hours of 25 September so [[Axis powers|Axis]] aerial reconnaissance might think only Force H was at sea. Fulmars from ''Ark Royal'' provided air cover over the convoy.<ref name=g&m/>\n\nItalian aircraft found Force H on the afternoon of 25 September, and assumed the battleships were on a bombardment raid against the Italian coast. A [[CANT Z.506]] seaplane observing Force H at 09:32 on 26 September reported a single battleship with an aircraft carrier incorrectly identified as {{HMS|Furious|47|6}}. Since ''Ark Royal'' had been seen leaving Gibraltar, the Italians assumed ''Furious'' might be flying off aircraft to reinforce Malta while ''Ark Royal'' attacked [[Genoa]]. The Italian fleet sailed from Naples to take a defensive position with the 8th cruiser division off northern Sardinia, but was ordered not to engage the British fleet unless the Italians held a decisive superiority of forces.<ref name=g&m/>\n\n==Battle of 27 September==\nForce H rejoined the convoy at 07:10 27 September. Sixteen destroyers formed a bent line screen ahead of two columns of merchant ships. The port column was led by the cruiser ''Kenya'', followed by ''Ajax'', ''Clan MacDonald'', ''Imperial Star'', ''Rowallan Castle'' and ''City of Calcutta''. The starboard column was led by the cruiser ''Edinburgh'' followed by ''Clan Ferguson'', {{MV|Dunedin Star}}, HMS ''Breconshire'' and ''City of Lincoln''. ''Rodney'' took position behind the port wing of the screen followed by ''Prince of Wales''. ''Nelson'' took position behind the starboard wing of the screen followed by ''Ark Royal'' in formation with the [[Dido-class cruiser|anti-aircraft cruisers]] ''Euryalus'' and ''Hermione''. The cruiser ''Sheffield'' took position astern of the merchant ships, while the destroyers ''Piorun'' and ''Legion'' assumed [[plane guard]] positions astern of ''Ark Royal''.<ref>Greene & Massignani, p.186</ref>\n\nItalian aircraft correctly identified ''Ark Royal'' at 08:10, and at 10:45 reported the convoy speed of {{convert|16|knot|kph}}, which indicated that merchant ships were with the convoy. The battleships from Naples rendezvoused with the cruisers from Taranto at 10:40, and were joined by the 8th cruiser division at 11:48. The Italian fleet was faster than the battleships of Force H, but was inferior to the British force in firepower. The ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' gave priority to fighter defence of bomber strikes, and the six fighters providing air cover over the Italian fleet could not travel more than {{convert|100|km|mi}} from their base. Since Italian aircraft had reported only a single British battleship, the Italian fleet received authorization at noon to engage the British formation. The ''Regia Aeronautica'' was requested to provide increased air cover for the Italian fleet by 14:00.<ref name=g&m2>Greene & Massignani, pp.187-191</ref>\n\nThe ''Regia Aeronautica'' launched a strike of 28 SM.79 and SM.84 torpedo planes with 20 Cr.42 fighters. The convoy came under air attack at 13:00. The strike was met by defending Fulmars and heavy anti-aircraft fire. Three bombers pressed through the barrage of starboard wing destroyers to launch torpedoes at ''Nelson''. ''Nelson'' turned to comb the torpedo tracks, and inadvertently steadied on the reciprocal course of a torpedo which struck the port side of the [[forecastle]].<ref>''The Royal Navy and the Mediterranean Convoys'', p.21. This account states that the torpedo attacks were carried out by [[SM-79]] and [[Fiat BR.20|BR-20]] torpedo bombers.</ref> ''Nelson'' slowed to 15 knots, but maintained position in the convoy. The Italian plane had released the torpedo at a range of only {{convert|450|yd|m}} and endured concentrated anti-aircraft fire from ''Prince of Wales'' before being shot down by one of the Fulmars. Six more torpedo planes and 1 fighter failed to return from the strike. [[Friendly fire]] from ''Rodney'' and ''Prince of Wales'' shot down two Fulmars, and a patrolling Swordfish had been shot down by the Italian fighters before the strike ended at 13:30.<ref name=g&m2/>\n\nThe Italian fleet was shadowed by British aircraft from Malta beginning at 13:07. At 14:30 the Italian fleet was about 40 miles from the convoy, but \"...decided to return home around 14:30 on the 27th when...\" it \"... learned that the British had two battleships, a carrier and six cruisers at sea.\"<ref>''The Italian Navy in WW2'', Sadkovich, p.181: \"He therefore decided to return home around 14:30 on the 27th when he learned that the British had two battleships, a carrier and six cruisers at sea.\"</ref> Aircraft from ''Ark Royal'' shadowed the Italian fleet from 15:15 to 17:50. Cr.42 fighters arrived at 15:30 to provide air cover, but the squadron leader of the first flight was shot down by friendly fire from an Italian destroyer. Two more Italian pilots were lost when another flight of ten C.200s ran out of fuel and ditched at sea. At 14:46 ''Prince of Wales'', ''Rodney'', ''Sheffield'', ''Edinburgh'', and six destroyers steamed toward the Italian fleet; but were recalled at 17:00 before making contact, and rejoined the convoy at 18:30.<ref>''The Royal Navy and the Mediterranean Convoys'', p.28</ref> ''Nelson'', ''Rodney'', ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Ark Royal'' turned west to return to Gibraltar escorted by ''Duncan'', ''Fury'', ''Gurkha'', ''Lance'', ''Legion'', ''Lively''. ''Garland'', ''Piorun'', and ''Isaac Sweers''. ''Euryalus'' fell in astern of the port column of merchant ships while ''Sheffield'' and ''Hermione'' joined the starboard column as the remaining destroyers closed into a night steaming formation. The night steaming formation was attacked by a few torpedo bombers, and ''Imperial Star'' was struck by a single torpedo. ''Oribi'' took the damaged freighter in tow. Italian [[MAS (boat)|''Motoscafo armato silurante'']] (MAS torpedo boats) deployed through the Strait of Messina, but failed to find the convoy.<ref name=g&m2/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n''Hermione'' detached from the convoy to bombard [[Pantelleria]] so that airfield would be out of action when the convoy arrived in Malta. The damaged ''Imperial Star'' was scuttled without loss of life to maintain convoy speed of advance; and the convoy arrived in Malta on 28 September.

The name \u201csombuka\u201d means to begin; hence the first son was called Masombuka. Manala was the first son from the great wife and Ndzundza was the son of the second wife. According to Ndebele custom, the heir to the throne of the king is the first born son from the great wife; hence Manala was the heir to the Ndebele throne.\n\nWhen the great wife of King Musi died, King Musi was blind through old age and was sickly. He was nursed by his surviving second wife and mother of Ndzundza. Due to the fact that Musi was very old, he was also worried about the Kingship of the Ndebele Nation. Musi did not want Manala to be the King of the Nation hence one day Musi instructed Manala to come and see him in the morning. Musi then instructed Manala to go and hunt for the iMbuduma ([[Wildebeest]]) and this was a ploy to keep Manala away from the household in order to hand over the kingship to Ndzundza.\n\nAfter Manala had left to hunt for the Wildebeest Musi instructed his wife to call her son Ndzundza. King Musi then gave Ndzundza the accessory to the throne, customarily passed on from the incumbent to the successor. Musi knew that if he died naturally then, the kingship will be passed to Manala, hence he passed the kingship to Ndzundza while he was alive, and this was not common at that time for a king to give his son rulership while the king is still alive. This accessory called namrhali was a mysterious object that cries like a child, used to fortify the king.\n\nMusi then instructed Ndzundza to call a Royal meeting (Imbizo) and notify the nation that he is the King and also to live kwaMnyamana with his followers. Many people believed him and a few did not want to follow him. Ndzundza then left with a huge number of people. \nWhen Manala came back from the hunt he realised that Ndzundza had received the namrhali, he then went to see his father. His father informed him that he had already given away the namrhali to Ndzundza. Manala called a Royal meeting (imbizo) with the few people left behind and announced that Ndzundza had stolen the namrhali. Musi then instructed Manala that if he really wants to be a king he must pursue Ndzundza and bring him back to the royal household and if Ndzundza refuses to come back Manala should kill him.\n\nManala caught up with Ndzundza who was with Thombeni (Kekana) and Skhosana (Masombuka), his half brothers, at Masongololo around Cullinan. The two factions fought at Cullinan. Manala and his supporters returned home to replenish their provisions. Upon their return, they caught up with Ndzundza at Bhalule River (Oliphants River). Manala did not kill Ndzundza but an old woman called NoQoli from a Mnguni family mediated between the two brothers.\nAn agreement was reached whereby Manala surrendered the kingship to Ndzundza. It was further agreed that henceforth their daughters would inter-marry, a practice which later died out. The agreement was called \u201cisivumelwano sakoNoQoli\u201d and hence the Mnguni family was later called Msiza because they helped Ndzundza and Manala not to kill each other. Ndzundza never returned to the royal household but settled across the Bhalule River with his followers. Ndzundza settled across the Bhalule River whilst Manala returned to KwaMnyamana and each ruled separately.\n\nDlomu the son of Skhube went to Emboland, and became the father of the amaNdebele clan in Hlubiland which were later dominated by King Matiwane of the Hlubis. Some of Dlomu\u2019s descendants later joined the Manala and Ndzundza under the shield of Skhosana. Mhwaduba formed a Batswana traditional community and became the originator of the Bahwaduba clan (Mhwaduba of Bakgatla Ba Lekhuleni). \nThombeni left and joined Ndzundza but later hived along the Olifants River and established the Gegana (Kekana) traditional community in Zebediela known as Matebele a Moletlane and later the Mthombeni traditional community among VaTsonga. Sibasa left and joined the VhaVenda community and was later known as Tshivhase amongst the Venda nation. Mphafuli (later called Mphaphuli) joined Sibasa and usurped the leadership of the Vhavenda traditional community.\n\n==Ndebele Kings==\n\n===Ndzunza===\nNdebele \u2013 1400*\n\u2022\tMkhalangana \u2013 1425*\n\u2022\tMntuNgwa II \u2013 1450*\n\u2022\tJonono \u2013 1475*\n\u2022\tNanasi \u2013 1500*\n\u2022\tMafana \u2013 1525*\n\u2022\tMhlanga \u2013 1550*\n\u2022\tMusi \u2013 1575*\n\u2022\tNdzundza \u2013 (1600 \u2013 1621)\n\u2022\tMrhetjha \u2013 (1621 - 1642)\n\u2022\tMagobholi \u2013 (1642 \u2013 1677)\n\u2022\tBongwe \u2013 (1677 \u2013 1693)\n\u2022\tSindeni \u2013 (1693 \u2013 1701)\n\u2022\tMahlangu \u2013 (1701 \u2013 1745)\n\u2022\tPhaswana \u2013 (1745 \u2013 1756)\n\u2022\tMaridili \u2013 (1756 \u2013 1765)\n\u2022\tMdalanyana \u2013 (1765 \u2013 1771)\n\u2022\tMgwezana \u2013 (1771 \u2013 1804)\n\u2022\tDzela \u2013 (1804 \u2013 1806)\n\u2022\tMrhabuli \u2013 (1806 \u2013 1811)\n\u2022\tMagodongo \u2013 (1811 \u2013 1827)\n\u2022\tSoMdeyi \u2013 (1827 \u2013 1835)\n\u2022\tS'bogo \u2013 (1835 \u2013 1840)\n\u2022\tMabhoko \u2013 (1840 \u2013 1865) \n\u2022\tMkhephuli \u2013 (1865 \u2013 1873)\n\u2022\tRhobongo \u2013 (1873 \u2013 1879)\n\u2022\tNyabela \u2013 (1879 \u2013 1902)\n\u2022\tFene \u2013 (1902 \u2013 1921)\n\u2022\tMayitjha \u2013 (1921 \u2013 1961)\n\u2022\tMabusa Mabhoko II \u2013 (1961 \u2013 1992)\n\u2022\tNyumbabo Mayitjha II \u2013 (1992 \u2013 2005)\n\u2022\tSililo (2005 - 2005)\n\u2022\tMbusi Mabhoko III \u2013 (2005 \u2013 present)\n\n'''NZUNZA KINGS'''\n*King Nzunza\n*King Mrhetjha\n*King Magobholi\n*King Bongwe\n*King Mahlangu\n*King Phaswana (carried for Mgwezani to grow-up)\n*King Mgwezani\n\nKing Magodongo and has been killed by Mzilikazi along with his old first wife son who was supposed to rule after him(Magodongo) his name was Mloyi and he(Mloyi) was already married and issued a son namely Tjambowe and that's the reason why Mabhoko 1 from the forth house of Magodongo took over the Kingship as a regeme(umjaphethe) till Tjambowe grow up enough to rule and all the people who ruled after Magodongo as inngwenyama are all regeme till today and the actual line kingship of King Magodongo is strongly axisting under King Mkhambi 2 of Sokhulumi in Gauteng and the Ndzundza kingdom is the paramount kingdom of the amandebele as a whole as per Musi's decision and not of Manala, that is an insult to Ndebele nation especial Ndzundzas because King Ndzundza never ever fought for Kingship of Ndebele nation but because of the unsatisfied of Musi's elders or family between Musi and Manala heredity or relationship as father and son, Ndzundza was the preference to rule amandebele as a whole.\nKing Mabhoko (1839-1875)\nKing Mkhephuli (1875-1876)\nKing Rhobongo (1876-1879 carried for Fene to grow-up)\nKing Nyabela (1879-1902 carried for Fene to grow-up)\nKing Fene (1903-1921)\nKing Mayisha II\nKing Mabusabesala (1961-1992)\nKing Mayisha III\nKing Mabhoko III\n\n==Social and cultural life==\n\n===Internal political and social structures===\nNdebele authority structures were similar to those of their Zulu cousins. The authority over a tribe was vested in the tribal head (iKosi), assisted by an inner or family council (iimphakathi). Wards (izilindi) were administered by ward heads and the family groups within the wards were governed by the heads of the families. The residential unit of each family was called an umuzi. The umuzi usually consisted of a family head (umnumzana) with his wife and unmarried children. If he had more than one wife, the umuzi was divided into two halves, a right and a left half, to accommodate the different wives.\nAn umuzi sometimes grew into a more complex dwelling unit when the head's married sons and younger brothers joined the household. Every tribe consisted of a number of patrilineal clans or izibongo. This meant that every clan consisted of a group of individuals who shared the same ancestor in the paternal line.\n\n==Personal adornment==\nNdebele women traditionally adorned themselves with a variety of ornaments, each symbolising her status in society. After marriage, dresses became increasingly elaborate and spectacular. In earlier times, the Ndebele wife would wear copper and brass rings around her arms, legs and neck, symbolising her bond and faithfulness to her husband, once her home was built. She would only remove the rings after his death. The rings (called idzila) were believed to have strong ritual powers. Husbands used to provide their wives with rings; the richer the husband, the more rings the wife would wear. Today, it is no longer common practice to wear these rings permanently. \nIn addition to the rings, married women also wore neck hoops made of grass (called isirholwani) twisted into a coil and covered in beads, particularly for ceremonial occasions. Linrholwani are sometimes worn as neckpieces and as leg and arm bands by newly wed women whose husbands have not yet provided them with a home, or by girls of marriageable age after the completion of their initiation ceremony (ukuthomba). Married women also wore a five-fingered apron (called an itjhorholo) to mark the culmination of the marriage, which only takes place after the birth of the first child. The marriage blanket (untsurhwana) worn by married women was decorated with beadwork to record significant events throughout the woman's lifetime.\nFor example, long beaded strips signified that the woman's son was undergoing the initiation ceremony and indicated that the woman had now attained a higher status in Ndebele society. It symbolised joy because her son had achieved manhood as well as the sorrow at losing him to the adult world. A married woman always wore some form of head covering as a sign of respect for her husband. These ranged from a simple beaded headband or a knitted cap to elaborate beaded headdresses (amacubi). Boys usually ran around naked or wore a small front apron of goatskin. However, girls wore beaded aprons or beaded wraparound skirts from an early age. For rituals and ceremonies, Ndebele men adorned themselves with ornaments made for them by their wives.\n\n==Art==\n[[File:Ndebele_Architecture.jpg|thumb|Traditional Ndebele architecture at [[Lesedi Cultural Village]].]]{{See also|Ndebele house painting}}\nNdebele art has always been an important identifying characteristic of the Ndebele. Apart from its aesthetic appeal it has a cultural significance that serves to reinforce the distinctive Ndebele identity. The Ndebele's essential artistic skill has always been understood to be the ability to combine exterior sources of stimulation with traditional design concepts borrowed from their ancestors. Ndebele artists also demonstrated a fascination with the linear quality of elements in their environment and this is depicted in their artwork. Painting was done freehand, without prior layouts, although the designs were planned beforehand.\n\nThe characteristic symmetry, proportion and straight edges of Ndebele decorations were done by hand without the help of rulers and squares. Ndebele women were responsible for painting the colourful and intricate patterns on the walls of their houses. This presented the traditionally subordinate wife with an opportunity to express her individuality and sense of self-worth. Her innovativeness in the choice of colours and designs set her apart from her peer group. In some instances, the women also created sculptures to express themselves.\n\nThe back and side walls of the house were often painted in earth colours and decorated with simple geometric shapes that were shaped with the fingers and outlined in black. The most innovative and complex designs were painted, in the brightest colours, on the front walls of the house. The front wall that enclosed the courtyard in front of the house formed the gateway (izimpunjwana) and was given special care. Windows provided a focal point for mural designs and their designs were not always symmetrical. Sometimes, makebelieve windows are painted on the walls to create a focal point and also as a mechanism to relieve the geometric rigidity of the wall design. Simple borders painted in a dark colour, lined with white, accentuated less important windows in the inner courtyard and in outside walls.\n\nContemporary Ndebele artists make use of a wider variety of colours (blues, reds, greens and yellows) than traditional artists were able to, mainly because of their commercial availability. Traditionally, muted earth colours, made from ground ochre, and different natural-coloured clays, in white, browns, pinks and yellows, were used. Black was derived from charcoal. Today, bright colours are the order of the day. As Ndebele society became more westernised, the artists started reflecting this change of their society in their paintings. Another change is the addition of stylised representational forms to the typical traditional abstract geometric designs. Many Ndebele artists have now also extended their artwork to the interior of houses. Ndebele artists also produce other crafts such as sleeping mats and isingolwani.\n\nIinrholwani (colourful neck hoops) are made by winding grass into a hoop, binding it tightly with cotton and decorating it with beads. In order to preserve the grass and to enable the hoop to retain its shape and hardness, the hoop is boiled in sugar water and left in the hot sun for a few days. A further outstanding characteristic of the Ndebele is their beadwork. Beadwork is intricate and time-consuming and requires a deft hand and good eyesight. This pastime has long been a social practice in which the women engaged after their chores were finished but today, many projects involve the production of these items for sale to the public.\n\n==Special occasions==\n\n===Initiation===\nIn Ndebele culture, the initiation rite, symbolising the transition from childhood to adulthood, plays an important role. Initiation schools for boys are held every four years and for girls, as soon as they get into puberty stage. During the period of initiation, relatives and friends come from far and wide to join in the ceremonies and activities associated with initiation. Boys are initiated as a group when they are about 18 years of age when a special regiment (iintanga) is set up and led by a boy of high social rank. Each regiment has a distinguishing name. Among the Ndzundza tribe there is a cycle of 15 such regimental names, allocated successively, and among the Manala there is a cycle of 13 such names.\n\nDuring initiation girls wear an array of colourful beaded hoops (called iinrholwani) around their legs, arms, waist and neck. The girls are kept in isolation and are prepared and trained to become homemakers and matriarchs. The coming-out ceremony marks the conclusion of the initiation school and the girls then wear stiff rectangular aprons (called iphephetu), beaded in geometric and often three-dimensional patterns, to celebrate the event. After initiation, these aprons are replaced by stiff, square ones, made from hardened leather and adorned with beadwork.\n\n==Courtship and marriage==\nMarriages were only concluded between members of different clans, that is between individuals who did not have the same clan name. However, a man could marry a woman from the same family as his paternal grandmother. The prospective bride was kept secluded for two weeks before the wedding in a specially made structure in her parents' house, to shield her from men's eyes.\nWhen the bride emerged from her seclusion, she was wrapped in a blanket and covered by an umbrella that was held for her by a younger girl (called Ipelesi) who also attended to her other needs. On her marriage, the bride was given a marriage blanket, which she would, in time, adorn with beadwork, either added to the blanket's outer surface or woven into the fabric. After the wedding, the couple lived in the area belonging to the husband's clan. Women retained the clan name of their fathers but children born of the marriage took their father's clan name.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Ndebele: The art of an African tribe'', 1986.

The name \u201csombuka\u201d means to begin; hence the first son was called Masombuka. Manala was the first son from the great wife and Ndzundza was the son of the second wife. According to Ndebele custom, the heir to the throne of the king is the first born son from the great wife; hence Manala was the heir to the Ndebele throne.\n\nWhen the great wife of King Musi died, King Musi was blind through old age and was sickly. He was nursed by his surviving second wife and mother of Ndzundza. Due to the fact that Musi was very old, he was also worried about the Kingship of the Ndebele Nation. Musi did not want Manala to be the King of the Nation hence one day Musi instructed Manala to come and see him in the morning. Musi then instructed Manala to go and hunt for the iMbuduma ([[Wildebeest]]) and this was a ploy to keep Manala away from the household in order to hand over the kingship to Ndzundza.\n\nAfter Manala had left to hunt for the Wildebeest Musi instructed his wife to call her son Ndzundza. King Musi then gave Ndzundza the accessory to the throne, customarily passed on from the incumbent to the successor. Musi knew that if he died naturally then, the kingship will be passed to Manala, hence he passed the kingship to Ndzundza while he was alive, and this was not common at that time for a king to give his son rulership while the king is still alive. This accessory called namrhali was a mysterious object that cries like a child, used to fortify the king.\n\nMusi then instructed Ndzundza to call a Royal meeting (Imbizo) and notify the nation that he is the King and also to live kwaMnyamana with his followers. Many people believed him and a few did not want to follow him. Ndzundza then left with a huge number of people. \nWhen Manala came back from the hunt he realised that Ndzundza had received the namrhali, he then went to see his father. His father informed him that he had already given away the namrhali to Ndzundza. Manala called a Royal meeting (imbizo) with the few people left behind and announced that Ndzundza had stolen the namrhali. Musi then instructed Manala that if he really wants to be a king he must pursue Ndzundza and bring him back to the royal household and if Ndzundza refuses to come back Manala should kill him.\n\nManala caught up with Ndzundza who was with Thombeni (Kekana) and Skhosana (Masombuka), his half brothers, at Masongololo around Cullinan. The two factions fought at Cullinan. Manala and his supporters returned home to replenish their provisions. Upon their return, they caught up with Ndzundza at Bhalule River (Oliphants River). Manala did not kill Ndzundza but an old woman called NoQoli from a Mnguni family mediated between the two brothers.\nAn agreement was reached whereby Manala surrendered the kingship to Ndzundza. It was further agreed that henceforth their daughters would inter-marry, a practice which later died out. The agreement was called \u201cisivumelwano sakoNoQoli\u201d and hence the Mnguni family was later called Msiza because they helped Ndzundza and Manala not to kill each other. Ndzundza never returned to the royal household but settled across the Bhalule River with his followers. Ndzundza settled across the Bhalule River whilst Manala returned to KwaMnyamana and each ruled separately.\n\nDlomu the son of Skhube went to Emboland, and became the father of the amaNdebele clan in Hlubiland which were later dominated by King Matiwane of the Hlubis. Some of Dlomu\u2019s descendants later joined the Manala and Ndzundza under the shield of Skhosana. Mhwaduba formed a Batswana traditional community and became the originator of the Bahwaduba clan (Mhwaduba of Bakgatla Ba Lekhuleni). \nThombeni left and joined Ndzundza but later hived along the Olifants River and established the Gegana (Kekana) traditional community in Zebediela known as Matebele a Moletlane and later the Mthombeni traditional community among VaTsonga. Sibasa left and joined the VhaVenda community and was later known as Tshivhase amongst the Venda nation. Mphafuli (later called Mphaphuli) joined Sibasa and usurped the leadership of the Vhavenda traditional community.\n\n==Ndebele Kings==\n\n===Ndzunza===\nNdebele \u2013 1400*\n\u2022\tMkhalangana \u2013 1425*\n\u2022\tMntuNgwa II \u2013 1450*\n\u2022\tJonono \u2013 1475*\n\u2022\tNanasi \u2013 1500*\n\u2022\tMafana \u2013 1525*\n\u2022\tMhlanga \u2013 1550*\n\u2022\tMusi \u2013 1575*\n\u2022\tNdzundza \u2013 (1600 \u2013 1621)\n\u2022\tMrhetjha \u2013 (1621 - 1642)\n\u2022\tMagobholi \u2013 (1642 \u2013 1677)\n\u2022\tBongwe \u2013 (1677 \u2013 1693)\n\u2022\tSindeni \u2013 (1693 \u2013 1701)\n\u2022\tMahlangu \u2013 (1701 \u2013 1745)\n\u2022\tPhaswana \u2013 (1745 \u2013 1756)\n\u2022\tMaridili \u2013 (1756 \u2013 1765)\n\u2022\tMdalanyana \u2013 (1765 \u2013 1771)\n\u2022\tMgwezana \u2013 (1771 \u2013 1804)\n\u2022\tDzela \u2013 (1804 \u2013 1806)\n\u2022\tMrhabuli \u2013 (1806 \u2013 1811)\n\u2022\tMagodongo \u2013 (1811 \u2013 1827)\n\u2022\tSoMdeyi \u2013 (1827 \u2013 1835)\n\u2022\tS'bogo \u2013 (1835 \u2013 1840)\n\u2022\tMabhoko \u2013 (1840 \u2013 1865) \n\u2022\tMkhephuli \u2013 (1865 \u2013 1873)\n\u2022\tRhobongo \u2013 (1873 \u2013 1879)\n\u2022\tNyabela \u2013 (1879 \u2013 1902)\n\u2022\tFene \u2013 (1902 \u2013 1921)\n\u2022\tMayitjha \u2013 (1921 \u2013 1961)\n\u2022\tMabusa Mabhoko II \u2013 (1961 \u2013 1992)\n\u2022\tNyumbabo Mayitjha II \u2013 (1992 \u2013 2005)\n\u2022\tSililo (2005 - 2005)\n\u2022\tMbusi Mabhoko III \u2013 (2005 \u2013 present)\n\n'''NZUNZA KINGS'''\n*King Nzunza\n*King Mrhetjha\n*King Magobholi\n*King Bongwe\n*King Mahlangu\n*King Phaswana (carried for Mgwezani to grow-up)\n*King Mgwezani\n\nKing Magodongo and has been killed by Mzilikazi along with his old first wife son who was supposed to rule after him(Magodongo) his name was Mloyi and he(Mloyi) was already married and issued a son namely Tjambowe and that's the reason why Mabhoko 1 from the forth house of Magodongo took over the Kingship as a regeme(umjaphethe) till Tjambowe grow up enough to rule and all the people who ruled after Magodongo as inngwenyama are all regeme till today and the actual line kingship of King Magodongo is strongly axisting under King Mkhambi 2 of Sokhulumi in Gauteng and the Ndzundza kingdom is the paramount kingdom of the amandebele as a whole as per Musi's decision and not of Manala, that is an insult to Ndebele nation especial Ndzundzas because King Ndzundza never ever fought for Kingship of Ndebele nation but because of the unsatisfied of Musi's elders or family between Musi and Manala heredity or relationship as father and son, Ndzundza was the preference to rule amandebele as a whole.\nKing Mabhoko (1839-1875)\nKing Mkhephuli (1875-1876)\nKing Rhobongo (1876-1879 carried for Fene to grow-up)\nKing Nyabela (1879-1902 carried for Fene to grow-up)\nKing Fene (1903-1921)\nKing Mayisha II\nKing Mabusabesala (1961-1992)\nKing Mayisha III\nKing Mabhoko III\n\n==Social and cultural life==\n\n===Internal political and social structures===\nNdebele authority structures were similar to those of their Zulu cousins. The authority over a tribe was vested in the tribal head (iKosi), assisted by an inner or family council (iimphakathi). Wards (izilindi) were administered by ward heads and the family groups within the wards were governed by the heads of the families. The residential unit of each family was called an umuzi. The umuzi usually consisted of a family head (umnumzana) with his wife and unmarried children. If he had more than one wife, the umuzi was divided into two halves, a right and a left half, to accommodate the different wives.\nAn umuzi sometimes grew into a more complex dwelling unit when the head's married sons and younger brothers joined the household. Every tribe consisted of a number of patrilineal clans or izibongo. This meant that every clan consisted of a group of individuals who shared the same ancestor in the paternal line.\n\n==Personal adornment==\nNdebele women traditionally adorned themselves with a variety of ornaments, each symbolising her status in society. After marriage, dresses became increasingly elaborate and spectacular. In earlier times, the Ndebele wife would wear copper and brass rings around her arms, legs and neck, symbolising her bond and faithfulness to her husband, once her home was built. She would only remove the rings after his death. The rings (called idzila) were believed to have strong ritual powers. Husbands used to provide their wives with rings; the richer the husband, the more rings the wife would wear. Today, it is no longer common practice to wear these rings permanently. \nIn addition to the rings, married women also wore neck hoops made of grass (called isirholwani) twisted into a coil and covered in beads, particularly for ceremonial occasions. Linrholwani are sometimes worn as neckpieces and as leg and arm bands by newly wed women whose husbands have not yet provided them with a home, or by girls of marriageable age after the completion of their initiation ceremony (ukuthomba). Married women also wore a five-fingered apron (called an itjhorholo) to mark the culmination of the marriage, which only takes place after the birth of the first child. The marriage blanket (untsurhwana) worn by married women was decorated with beadwork to record significant events throughout the woman's lifetime.\nFor example, long beaded strips signified that the woman's son was undergoing the initiation ceremony and indicated that the woman had now attained a higher status in Ndebele society. It symbolised joy because her son had achieved manhood as well as the sorrow at losing him to the adult world. A married woman always wore some form of head covering as a sign of respect for her husband. These ranged from a simple beaded headband or a knitted cap to elaborate beaded headdresses (amacubi). Boys usually ran around naked or wore a small front apron of goatskin. However, girls wore beaded aprons or beaded wraparound skirts from an early age. For rituals and ceremonies, Ndebele men adorned themselves with ornaments made for them by their wives.\n\n==Art==\n[[File:Ndebele_Architecture.jpg|thumb|Traditional Ndebele architecture at [[Lesedi Cultural Village]].]]{{See also|Ndebele house painting}}\nNdebele art has always been an important identifying characteristic of the Ndebele. Apart from its aesthetic appeal it has a cultural significance that serves to reinforce the distinctive Ndebele identity. The Ndebele's essential artistic skill has always been understood to be the ability to combine exterior sources of stimulation with traditional design concepts borrowed from their ancestors. Ndebele artists also demonstrated a fascination with the linear quality of elements in their environment and this is depicted in their artwork. Painting was done freehand, without prior layouts, although the designs were planned beforehand.\n\nThe characteristic symmetry, proportion and straight edges of Ndebele decorations were done by hand without the help of rulers and squares. Ndebele women were responsible for painting the colourful and intricate patterns on the walls of their houses. This presented the traditionally subordinate wife with an opportunity to express her individuality and sense of self-worth. Her innovativeness in the choice of colours and designs set her apart from her peer group. In some instances, the women also created sculptures to express themselves.\n\nThe back and side walls of the house were often painted in earth colours and decorated with simple geometric shapes that were shaped with the fingers and outlined in black. The most innovative and complex designs were painted, in the brightest colours, on the front walls of the house. The front wall that enclosed the courtyard in front of the house formed the gateway (izimpunjwana) and was given special care. Windows provided a focal point for mural designs and their designs were not always symmetrical. Sometimes, makebelieve windows are painted on the walls to create a focal point and also as a mechanism to relieve the geometric rigidity of the wall design. Simple borders painted in a dark colour, lined with white, accentuated less important windows in the inner courtyard and in outside walls.\n\nContemporary Ndebele artists make use of a wider variety of colours (blues, reds, greens and yellows) than traditional artists were able to, mainly because of their commercial availability. Traditionally, muted earth colours, made from ground ochre, and different natural-coloured clays, in white, browns, pinks and yellows, were used. Black was derived from charcoal. Today, bright colours are the order of the day. As Ndebele society became more westernised, the artists started reflecting this change of their society in their paintings. Another change is the addition of stylised representational forms to the typical traditional abstract geometric designs. Many Ndebele artists have now also extended their artwork to the interior of houses. Ndebele artists also produce other crafts such as sleeping mats and isingolwani.\n\nIinrholwani (colourful neck hoops) are made by winding grass into a hoop, binding it tightly with cotton and decorating it with beads. In order to preserve the grass and to enable the hoop to retain its shape and hardness, the hoop is boiled in sugar water and left in the hot sun for a few days. A further outstanding characteristic of the Ndebele is their beadwork. Beadwork is intricate and time-consuming and requires a deft hand and good eyesight. This pastime has long been a social practice in which the women engaged after their chores were finished but today, many projects involve the production of these items for sale to the public.\n\n==Special occasions==\n\n===Initiation===\nIn Ndebele culture, the initiation rite, symbolising the transition from childhood to adulthood, plays an important role. Initiation schools for boys are held every four years and for girls, as soon as they get into puberty stage. During the period of initiation, relatives and friends come from far and wide to join in the ceremonies and activities associated with initiation. Boys are initiated as a group when they are about 18 years of age when a special regiment (iintanga) is set up and led by a boy of high social rank. Each regiment has a distinguishing name. Among the Ndzundza tribe there is a cycle of 15 such regimental names, allocated successively, and among the Manala there is a cycle of 13 such names.\n\nDuring initiation girls wear an array of colourful beaded hoops (called iinrholwani) around their legs, arms, waist and neck. The girls are kept in isolation and are prepared and trained to become homemakers and matriarchs. The coming-out ceremony marks the conclusion of the initiation school and the girls then wear stiff rectangular aprons (called iphephetu), beaded in geometric and often three-dimensional patterns, to celebrate the event. After initiation, these aprons are replaced by stiff, square ones, made from hardened leather and adorned with beadwork.\n\n==Courtship and marriage==\nMarriages were only concluded between members of different clans, that is between individuals who did not have the same clan name. However, a man could marry a woman from the same family as his paternal grandmother. The prospective bride was kept secluded for two weeks before the wedding in a specially made structure in her parents' house, to shield her from men's eyes.\nWhen the bride emerged from her seclusion, she was wrapped in a blanket and covered by an umbrella that was held for her by a younger girl called(Ipelesi) who also attended to her other needs. On her marriage, the bride was given a marriage blanket, which she would, in time, adorn with beadwork, either added to the blanket's outer surface or woven into the fabric. After the wedding, the couple lived in the area belonging to the husband's clan. Women retained the clan name of their fathers but children born of the marriage took their father's clan name.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Ndebele: The art of an African tribe'', 1986.

CBeebies Radio, however, has continued as a feature on the channel's website since 2013, and as a station on [[BBC Sounds]] broadcasting from 6am to 10pm. A magazine called ''CBeebies Weekly'' (now called CBeebies Magazine) was first published in 2006.\n\nSince 27 March 2013, CBeebies has been carried by the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service]], sharing a channel with BFBS Extra.<ref>[http://www.bfbs.com/tv/node/823536 BFBS TV IS CHANGING] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017201105/http://www.bfbs.com/tv/node/823536 |date=17 October 2012 }}</ref> The UK channel is also available in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n==International and Non-English versions==\n[[BBC Studios]] owns and operates the international CBeebies feeds, with most of them operating on a 24-hour schedule.\n\nThe first international launch for the CBeebies channel was in India in May 2007, although the channel was withdrawn at the end of November 2012 due to \"commercial considerations\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/11/02/bbc-pulls-plug-on-two-india-channels/|title=BBC Pulls Plug on Two India Channels|author=Will Davies|work=WSJ}}</ref>.  The Polish CBeebies channel was launched in December 2007, while feeds in [[Latin America]], Asia, South Africa and Australia were launched in 2008.\nIn March 2011, the [[Video on demand|on demand]] version of the network was launched in the US and is available on [[Xfinity|Xfinity]].\n\nOn 13 May 2011, CBeebies was launched as a programme block on the channel [[BBC Kids]] in Canada, available on weekdays between 9:00&nbsp;am and 3:00&nbsp;pm. It is serving a similar schedule to the main channel. The block ceased alongside its main channel on 31 December 2018, with some programmes moving to [[Knowledge Network]].\n\nIn April 2015, BBC Worldwide signed with South Korean broadcaster [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] and Japanese broadcaster [[Kids Station]] to launch CBeebies blocks on both channels.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/worldwide/2015/cbeebies-programming-blocks</ref>\n\nIn April 2016, a channel for the [[MENA]] region was launched.\n\nOn 10 March 2017, CBeebies Asia was launched in Taiwan, replacing [[BBC Entertainment]].

This block features its own presentation, presenters and shows all dubbed into [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\nOn 1 December 2019, The Australian feed launched in New Zealand on [[Sky (New Zealand)|Sky]].\n\n==Management==\nIn the UK, CBeebies is operated by the BBC Children's division and part of [[BBC North]]. The division is also responsible for CBBC and overall strategic responsibility for all of the BBC's domestic services for children rests with the Director of Children's, Alice Webb (since 2015).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2015/alice-webb|title=BBC - Alice Webb named as Director, BBC Children's - Media Centre|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> The direction of the domestic CBeebies channel itself rested with [[Kay Benbow]], the last Controller of the channel commissioning all CBeebies content across BBC television, online, interactive TV, and radio.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography \u2013 Kay Benbow|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/controllers/kay_benbow.shtml|publisher=BBC Press Office|accessdate=16 October 2011}}</ref> She took over from the first controller [[Michael Carrington (television executive)|Michael Carrington]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jan/27/cbeebies-michael-carrington-bbc-turner |title=Carrington Leaves BBC |date=27 January 2010|work= by Mark Sweney, guardian.co.uk }}</ref> In 2017 it was announced that the CBeebies controller post will close in December 2017 and all content for the CBeebies brand would be commissioned by a new, pan BBC Children's role entitled Head of Content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tbivision.com/news/2017/07/benbow-exiting-bbc-childrens-shake/776711/|title=Benbow exiting in BBC Children's shake-up - TBI Vision - Page 776711|website=tbivision.com}}</ref>\n\nInternationally, CBeebies is owned by [[BBC Studios]], who operate the brand.\n\n==Presentation==\nThe links between programmes on CBeebies are primarily achieved through the use of [[Continuity (broadcasting)|in-vision continuity]], using presenters to interact with the children. In the UK, links are pre-recorded rather than broadcast live, as is the case on sister channel [[CBBC]]. They were originally pre-recorded from studio TC0 at [[Television Centre, London|BBC Television Centre]] in London, however, moved out in 2008 to [[Teddington Studios]], and returned briefly in 2010. From September 2011, the links have been based at the BBC's Northern base at [[Dock10 (television facility)|Dock10]], [[MediaCityUK]], following the move of the BBC Children's department there. International variants feature broadcast links produced either in the corresponding country or from a central base.\n\n===Logo and idents===\n{{main|CBBC idents}}\n\n{{see also|History of BBC television idents}}\n\n===Presenters===\n\nAs well as hosting some of the shows, a number of presenters fill the gaps between the CBeebies shows, speaking directly to the child, leading activities based on a topic from the CBeebies website, showing viewers' birthday cards, and introducing the shows. Many of the presenters have histories as characters on other services or on children's programmes.\n\nIn the UK, presenters seen on the channel and the stranded service are:\n* [[Andy Day]] (2007\u2013present)\n* [[Katy Ashworth]] (2011\u2013present)\n* [[Cat Sandion]] (2013\u2013present)\n* [[Rebecca Keatley]] (2014\u2013present)\n* [[Ben Cajee]] (2015\u2013present)\n* [[Warrick Brownlow-Pike|Dodge T.

The original stranded section of the channel (and the only to still air to this day), Bedtime helps to prepare children for bed and features calm-natured programming. Programmes include ''[[Clangers]]'',  ''[[Moon & Me]]'',  ''[[Charlie and Lola (TV series)|Charlie and Lola]]'', ''[[Tee and Mo]]'' and ''[[In the Night Garden...]]'' Story-telling is often told during the programmes. The final programme is always the ''Bedtime Stories'' slot (see below) and is followed by a final song, \"The Time Has Come to Say Goodnight\", before the channel closes for the day and [[BBC Four]] starts up. CBeebies Bedtime was renamed from Bedtime Hour as of 4 February 2019.\n\nWhen these segments were initially introduced, each segment featured its own presenting team and set, with [[Chris Jarvis (presenter)|Chris Jarvis]] and [[Pui Fan Lee]] ([[Alex Winters]] and [[Cerrie Burnell]] after they left in January 2009) presenting '''Discover and Do''' in the CBeebies \"living room\"; '''Lunch Time''' in the \"kitchen\"; '''Bedtime Hour''' in the \"bedroom\"; [[Sidney Sloane]] (plus [[Andy Day]] when he joined the channel later in 2007) presenting '''Get, Set, Go!''' in the \"living room\" and '''Big Fun Time''' in the \"garage\". However, since moving production to Manchester this is no longer the case, with the exception of '''Bedtime Hour''' which is presented from the area nearest the house's bed.\n\n[[File:Bedtime Hour.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|The Bedtime Hour on-screen ident from March 2003 to March 2016.]]\n\n===Storytimes===\nWhile the lunchtime story is usually read by one of the regular presenters, the final show of each day, the ''Bedtime Story'' (known as ''St\u00f2iridh'' in Gaelic) is read by a guest storyteller, including well known actors, comedians, and past presenters of BBC children's television (Like [[Derek Jacobi|Sir Derek Jacobi]] who Narrated all 100 episodes of 2007's ''[[In the Night Garden...]]'' when he appeared in April 2018 and again in June 2018). Some notable storytellers in this slot have included [[James McAvoy]], [[Simon Pegg]], [[David Hasselhoff]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Damian Lewis]], [[Rosamund Pike]], [[Toby Stephens]], [[David Tennant]], [[Ben Faulks]], [[Michael Rosen]], [[Floella Benjamin]], [[Shayne Ward]], [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], [[Big Bird]], [[Tom Hardy]], [[David Schwimmer]], [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Elton John|Sir Elton John]].\n\nIn an unusual move, [[James Bolam]] appeared on \"Bedtime Story\" in costume and in character as Grandpa from ''[[Grandpa in My Pocket]]'', not as himself.\n\nLesser-known storytellers James Blishen and Elliot King have appeared in and taken inspiration from CBeebies' storytime slot, with a programme for James in pre-planning called 'Storytime with James'.{{Citation needed|reason=Cannot find any evidence for this|date=April 2019}}\n\n==CBeebies HD==\nOn 16 July 2013, the BBC announced that a [[High-definition television|high-definition]] (HD) [[simulcast]] of CBeebies would be launched by early 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23326709 |title=BBC to launch five new HD channels |publisher=BBC News |date=16 July 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref> The channel launched on 10 December 2013, though was rolled-out nationwide up to June 2014 (as did [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News HD]] and BBC Four HD).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/new-hd-channels.html|title=BBC to launch five new subscription-free HD channels on Tuesday 10 December|publisher=BBC|date=9 December 2013|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref> The channel broadcasts on the BBC's new HD multiplex on Freeview and shares its stream with [[BBC Four|BBC Four HD]] as they air at different times.

CBeebies Radio, however, has continued as a feature on the channel's website since 2013, and as a station on [[BBC Sounds]] broadcasting from 6am to 10pm. A magazine called ''CBeebies Weekly'' (now called CBeebies Magazine) was first published in 2006.\n\nSince 27 March 2013, CBeebies has been carried by the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service]], sharing a channel with BFBS Extra.<ref>[http://www.bfbs.com/tv/node/823536 BFBS TV IS CHANGING] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017201105/http://www.bfbs.com/tv/node/823536 |date=17 October 2012 }}</ref> The UK channel is also available in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n==International and Non-English versions==\n[[BBC Studios]] owns and operates the international CBeebies feeds, with most of them operating on a 24-hour schedule.\n\nThe first international launch for the CBeebies channel was in India in May 2007, although the channel was withdrawn at the end of November 2012 due to \"commercial considerations\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/11/02/bbc-pulls-plug-on-two-india-channels/|title=BBC Pulls Plug on Two India Channels|author=Will Davies|work=WSJ}}</ref>.

It is serving a similar schedule to the main channel. The block ceased alongside its main channel on 31 December 2018, with some programmes moving to [[Knowledge Network]].\n\nIn April 2015, BBC Worldwide signed with South Korean broadcaster [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] and Japanese broadcaster [[Kids Station]] to launch CBeebies blocks on both channels.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/worldwide/2015/cbeebies-programming-blocks</ref>\n\nIn April 2016, a channel for the [[MENA]] region was launched.\n\nOn 10 March 2017, CBeebies Asia was launched in Taiwan, replacing [[BBC Entertainment]].

This block features its own presentation, presenters and shows all dubbed into [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\nOn 1 December 2019, The Australian feed launched in New Zealand on [[Sky (New Zealand)|Sky]].\n\n==Management==\nIn the UK, CBeebies is operated by the BBC Children's division and part of [[BBC North]]. The division is also responsible for CBBC and overall strategic responsibility for all of the BBC's domestic services for children rests with the Director of Children's, Alice Webb (since 2015).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2015/alice-webb|title=BBC - Alice Webb named as Director, BBC Children's - Media Centre|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> The direction of the domestic CBeebies channel itself rested with [[Kay Benbow]], the last Controller of the channel commissioning all CBeebies content across BBC television, online, interactive TV, and radio.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography \u2013 Kay Benbow|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/controllers/kay_benbow.shtml|publisher=BBC Press Office|accessdate=16 October 2011}}</ref> She took over from the first controller [[Michael Carrington (television executive)|Michael Carrington]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jan/27/cbeebies-michael-carrington-bbc-turner |title=Carrington Leaves BBC |date=27 January 2010|work= by Mark Sweney, guardian.co.uk }}</ref> In 2017 it was announced that the CBeebies controller post will close in December 2017 and all content for the CBeebies brand would be commissioned by a new, pan BBC Children's role entitled Head of Content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tbivision.com/news/2017/07/benbow-exiting-bbc-childrens-shake/776711/|title=Benbow exiting in BBC Children's shake-up - TBI Vision - Page 776711|website=tbivision.com}}</ref>\n\nInternationally, CBeebies is owned by [[BBC Studios]], who operate the brand.\n\n==Presentation==\nThe links between programmes on CBeebies are primarily achieved through the use of [[Continuity (broadcasting)|in-vision continuity]], using presenters to interact with the children. In the UK, links are pre-recorded rather than broadcast live, as is the case on sister channel [[CBBC]]. They were originally pre-recorded from studio TC0 at [[Television Centre, London|BBC Television Centre]] in London, however, moved out in 2008 to [[Teddington Studios]], and returned briefly in 2010. From September 2011, the links have been based at the BBC's Northern base at [[Dock10 (television facility)|Dock10]], [[MediaCityUK]], following the move of the BBC Children's department there. International variants feature broadcast links produced either in the corresponding country or from a central base.\n\n===Logo and idents===\n{{main|CBBC idents}}\n\n{{see also|History of BBC television idents}}\n\n===Presenters===\n\nAs well as hosting some of the shows, a number of presenters fill the gaps between the CBeebies shows, speaking directly to the child, leading activities based on a topic from the CBeebies website, showing viewers' birthday cards, and introducing the shows. Many of the presenters have histories as characters on other services or on children's programmes.\n\nIn the UK, presenters seen on the channel and the stranded service are:\n* [[Andy Day]] (2007\u2013present)\n* [[Katy Ashworth]] (2011\u2013present)\n* [[Cat Sandion]] (2013\u2013present)\n* [[Rebecca Keatley]] (2014\u2013present)\n* [[Ben Cajee]] (2015\u2013present)\n* [[Warrick Brownlow-Pike|Dodge T.

Includes programmes such as ''[[Something Special (TV series)|Something Special]]'', ''[[Baby Jake]]'', ''[[Twirlywoos]]'', ''[[Raa Raa the Noisy Lion]]'', ''[[Postman Pat]]'', ''[[Bing (TV series)|Bing]]'', ''[[Hey Duggee]]'', ''[[Tinpo]]'', ''[[Biggleton]]'', ''[[Justin's House]]'', ''[[Octonauts]]'' and ''[[Go Jetters]]''. \n* '''Discover and Do''' \u2013 Late morning and early afternoon, weekdays between 9:00&nbsp;am and 3:00&nbsp;pm. The strand is aimed at young children who would not be attending school or pre-school. It often contains programmes that give a learning opportunity to viewers, such as ''[[Show Me Show Me]]'', ''[[Let's Play (TV series)|Let's Play]], ''[[Andy's Baby Animals]]'', ''[[Teletubbies]]'', ''[[My First]]'', ''[[Alphablocks]]'', ''[[Numberblocks]]'' & ''[[Yakka Dee]]''. The hour between 12:00&nbsp;pm and 1:00&nbsp;pm is branded as Lunch Time and features shows such as ''[[My World Kitchen]]'', ''[[Molly and Mack]]'' & [[Patchwork Pals]].\n* '''Big Fun Time''' \u2013 Late afternoon weekdays between 3:00&nbsp;pm and 5:45&nbsp;pm. This strand is notable for aiming at the higher end of its remit, airing programming for children who have recently returned from school. Programmes include ''[[Swashbuckle]]'', ''[[Do You Know? (TV series)|Do You Know?]]'', ''[[Andy's Safari Adventures]]'', ''[[Apple Tree House]]'', ''[[Catie's Amazing Machines]]'', ''[[Bitz & Bob]]'', ''[[Waffle the Wonder Dog]]'' & ''[[Gigglebiz]]''. \n* '''Bedtime''' \u2013 The final hour and 15 minutes of CBeebies broadcasting between 5:45&nbsp;pm and 7:00&nbsp;pm. The original stranded section of the channel (and the only to still air to this day), Bedtime helps to prepare children for bed and features calm-natured programming. Programmes include ''[[Clangers]]'',  ''[[Moon & Me]]'',  ''[[Charlie and Lola (TV series)|Charlie and Lola]]'', ''[[Tee and Mo]]'' and ''[[In the Night Garden...]]'' Story-telling is often told during the programmes. The final programme is always the ''Bedtime Stories'' slot (see below) and is followed by a final song, \"The Time Has Come to Say Goodnight\", before the channel closes for the day and [[BBC Four]] starts up. CBeebies Bedtime was renamed from Bedtime Hour as of 4 February 2019.\n\nWhen these segments were initially introduced, each segment featured its own presenting team and set, with [[Chris Jarvis (presenter)|Chris Jarvis]] and [[Pui Fan Lee]] ([[Alex Winters]] and [[Cerrie Burnell]] after they left in January 2009) presenting '''Discover and Do''' in the CBeebies \"living room\"; '''Lunch Time''' in the \"kitchen\"; '''Bedtime Hour''' in the \"bedroom\"; [[Sidney Sloane]] (plus [[Andy Day]] when he joined the channel later in 2007) presenting '''Get, Set, Go!''' in the \"living room\" and '''Big Fun Time''' in the \"garage\". However, since moving production to Manchester this is no longer the case, with the exception of '''Bedtime Hour''' which is presented from the area nearest the house's bed.\n\n[[File:Bedtime Hour.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|The Bedtime Hour on-screen ident from March 2003 to March 2016.]]\n\n===Storytimes===\nWhile the lunchtime story is usually read by one of the regular presenters, the final show of each day, the ''Bedtime Story'' (known as ''St\u00f2iridh'' in Gaelic) is read by a guest storyteller, including well known actors, comedians, and past presenters of BBC children's television (Like [[Derek Jacobi|Sir Derek Jacobi]] who Narrated all 100 episodes of 2007's ''[[In the Night Garden...]]'' when he appeared in April 2018 and again in June 2018).
