{"title_page": "LaVeyan Satanism", "text_new": "{{short description|Atheistic religion founded by Anton LaVey, in which Satan is a symbol of human freedom, but not believed to be a separately existing supernatural being}}\n[[File:Baphosimb.svg|thumb|right|The Sigil of Baphomet is the official [[Religious symbol|symbol]] of LaVeyan Satanism and the Church of Satan.]]\n'''LaVeyan Satanism''' is a [[religion]] founded in 1966 by the American [[occultism|occultist]] and author [[Anton LaVey|Anton Szandor LaVey]]. Scholars of religion have classified it as a [[new religious movement]] and a form of [[Western esotericism]]. It is one of several different movements that describe themselves as forms of [[Satanism]].\n\nLaVey established LaVeyan Satanism in the U.S. state of [[California]] through the founding of his [[Church of Satan]] on [[Walpurgisnacht]] of 1966, which he proclaimed to be \"the Year One\", ''Anno Satanas''\u2014the first year of the \"Age of Satan\". His ideas were heavily influenced by the ideas and writings of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Ayn Rand]]. The church grew under LaVey's leadership, with regional ''[[Grotto (Satanism)|grottos]]'' being founded across the United States. A number of these seceded from the church to form independent Satanic organizations during the early 1970s. In 1975, LaVey abolished the grotto system, after which Satanism became a far less organized movement, although it remained greatly influenced by LaVey's writings. In coming years, members of the church left it to establish their own organisations, also following LaVeyan Satanism, among them John Dewey Allee's First Church of Satan and [[Karla LaVey]]'s [[First Satanic Church]].\n\nThe religion's doctrines are codified in LaVey's book, ''[[The Satanic Bible]]''. The religion is [[materialist]], rejecting the existence of supernatural beings, [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|body-soul dualism]], and [[Afterlife|life after death]]. Practitioners do not believe that [[Satan]] literally exists and do not worship him. Instead, Satan is viewed as a positive archetype representing [[pride]], [[wiktionary:carnal|carnality]], and [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]]. He is also embraced as a [[symbol]] of defiance against [[Abrahamic religions]] which LaVeyans criticize for suppressing humanity's natural instincts and encouraging irrationality. The religion propagates a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] worldview, seeing mankind as animals existing in an [[amorality|amoral]] universe. It promotes a philosophy based on [[individualism]] and [[rational egoism|egoism]], coupled with [[Social Darwinism]] and [[anti-egalitarianism]].\n\nLaVeyan Satanism involves the practice of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], which encompasses two distinct forms; [[greater and lesser magic]]. Greater magic is a form of [[ritual]] practice and is meant as [[psychodramatic]] [[catharsis]] to focus one's emotional energy for a specific purpose. These rites are based on three major psycho-emotive themes: ''compassion'' ([[love]]), ''destruction'' ([[hate]]), and ''sex'' ([[lust]]).  Lesser magic is the practice of [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] by means of [[applied psychology]] and [[Glamour (presentation)|glamour]] (or [[Deception|\"wile and guile\"]]) to bend an individual or situation to one's will.

a real figure, the image of Satan is embraced because of its association with social non-conformity and rebellion against the dominant system.{{sfnm|1a1=Harvey|1y=1995|1p=290|2a1=La Fontaine|2y=1999|2p=97}} LaVey embraced the iconography of Satan and the label of \"Satanist\" because it shocked people into thinking,{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2001a|1p=17|2a1=Gallagher|2y=2006|2p=165}} and when asked about his religion, stated that \"the reason it's called Satanism is because it's fun, it's accurate and it's productive\".{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=290}}\n\nLaVey also conceptualised Satan as a symbol of the individual's own vitality,{{sfn|Schipper|2010|p=107}} thus representing an autonomous power within,{{sfn|Schipper|2010|p=106}} and a representation of personal liberty and individualism.{{sfn|Cavaglion|Sela-Shayovitz|2005|p=255}} Throughout ''The Satanic Bible'', the LaVeyan Satanist's view of god is described as the Satanist's true \"self\"\u2014a projection of his or her own personality\u2014not an external deity.{{sfn|Wright|1993|p=143}} In works like ''The Satanic Bible'', LaVey often uses the terms \"god\" and \"Satan\" interchangeably, viewing both as personifications of human nature.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=287|2a1=Muzzatti|2y=2005|2p=874}}\n\nDespite his professed atheism, some passages of LaVey's writings left room for a literal interpretation of Satan, and some members of his Church understood the Devil as an entity that really existed.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=348}} It is possible that LaVey left some ambivalence in his writings so as not to drive away those Church members who were theistic Satanists.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=355}}\nBoth LaVey's writings and the publications of the church continue to refer to Satan as if he were a real being, in doing so seeking to reinforce the Satanist's self-interest.{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=291}}\n\nLaVey used Christianity as a negative mirror for his new faith,{{sfn|Schipper|2010|p=109}} with LaVeyan Satanism rejecting the basic principles and theology of Christian belief.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=96}} It views Christianity &ndash; alongside other major religions, and philosophies such as [[humanism]] and [[liberal democracy]] &ndash; as a largely negative force on humanity; LaVeyan Satanists perceive Christianity as a lie which promotes idealism, self-denigration, herd behavior, and irrationality.{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2013|p=80}} LaVeyans view their religion as a force for redressing this balance by encouraging materialism, egoism, stratification, carnality, atheism, and social Darwinism.{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2013|p=80}} LaVey's Satanism was particularly critical of what it understands as Christianity's denial of humanity's animal nature, and it instead calls for the celebration of, and indulgence in, these desires.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=96}} In doing so, it places an emphasis on the carnal rather than the spiritual.{{sfn|Lewis|2001b|p=50}}\n\n===Human nature and society===\n\nLaVeyan Satanism has been characterised as belonging to the [[Right-wing politics|political right]] rather than to the [[Left-wing politics|political left]].{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=326}} The historian of Satanism Ruben van Luijk characterised it as a form of \"anarchism of the Right\".{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=374}} LaVey was anti-egalitarian and elitist, believing in the fundamental inequality of different human beings.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=289|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=366}} His philosophy was [[Social

added\".{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2001a|1p=18|2a1=Lewis|2y=2002|2p=9}} Characterising LaVey as a Nietzschean, the religious studies scholar Asbj\u00f8rn Dyrendal nevertheless thought that LaVey's \"personal synthesis seems decidedly his own creation, even though the different ingredients going into it are at times very visible.\"{{sfn|Dyrendal|2012|p=370}} Social Darwinism is particularly noticeable in ''The Book of Satan'', where LaVey uses portions of Redbeard's ''[[Might Is Right]]'', though it also appears throughout in references to man's inherent strength and instinct for self-preservation.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=4}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n\n | image1 = Nietzsche187a.jpg\n | alt1 = Friedrich Nietzsche\n | link1 = [Friedrich Nietzsche]\n\n | image2 = \n | alt2

human being was explicitly viewed as an animal,{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1p=4|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=288|3a1=Baddeley|3y=2010|3p=74|4a1=Lap|4y=2013|4p=94}} who thus has no purpose other than [[survival of the fittest]], and who therefore exists in an [[amorality|amoral]] context.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=4}} He believed that in adopting a philosophical belief in its own superiority above that of the other animals, humankind has become \"the most vicious animal of all\".{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=94}} For LaVey, non-human animals and children represent an ideal, \"the purest form of carnal existence\", because they have not been indoctrinated with Christian or other religious concepts of guilt and shame.{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=95}} His ethical views focused around placing oneself and one's family before others, minding one's own business, and &ndash; for men &ndash; behaving like a [[gentleman]].{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=289}} In responding to threats and harm, he promoted a policy of ''[[Eye for an eye|lex talionis]]'', for instance reversing a Biblical Christian teaching by stating that \"if a man smite thee on the one cheek, ''smash'' him on the other.\"{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=289}}\n\nLaVeyan Satanism places great emphasis on the role of [[liberty]] and personal freedom.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=322}} LaVey believed that the ideal Satanist should be individualistic and non-conformist, rejecting what he called the \"colorless existence\" that mainstream society sought to impose on those living within it.{{sfn|Dyrendal|2013|p=129}} He rejected [[consumerism]] and what he called the \"death cult\" of [[fashion]].{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=374}} He praised the human [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]] for encouraging an individual's pride, self-respect, and self-realization and accordingly believed in satisfying the ego's desires.{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=92}} He expressed the view that self-indulgence was a desirable trait,{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|2011|p=198}} and that hate and aggression were not wrong or undesirable emotions but that they were necessary and advantageous for survival.{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=94}} Accordingly, he praised the [[Seven Deadly Sins]] as virtues which were beneficial for the individual.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=288|2a1=Schipper|2y=2010|2p=107}}\n\nSimilarly, LaVey criticized the negative and restrictive attitude to sexuality present in many religions, instead supporting any sexual acts that take place between consenting adults.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=288|2a1=Lap|2y=2013|2p=91|3a1=Faxneld|3a2=Petersen|3y=2014|3p=168|4a1=van Luijk|4y=2016|4p=321}} His Church welcomed homosexual members from its earliest years,{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2014|p=168}} and he also endorsed celibacy for those who were [[asexuality|asexual]].{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2014|p=168}} He sought to discourage negative feelings of guilt arising from sexual acts such as masturbation and fetishes,{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=91}} and believed that rejecting these sexual inhibitions and guilt would result in a happier and healthier society.{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2014|p=169}} Discussing women, LaVey argued that they should use sex as a tool to manipulate men, in order to advance their own personal power.{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2014|p=170}} Conversely, non-consensual sexual relations, such as [[rape]] and [[child sexual abuse|child molestation]], were denounced by LaVey and his Church.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=288|2a1=Maxwell-Stuart|2y=2011|2p=198}}\n\nLaVey believed in the imminent demise of Christianity.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=357}} In addition, he believed that society would enter an Age of Satan, in which a generation living in accordance with LaVeyan principles would come to power.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=379}}\nLaVey supported [[eugenics]] and expected it to become a necessity in the future, when it would be used to breed an elite who reflected LaVey's \"Satanic\" principles.{{sfnm|1a1=Lap|1y=2013|1p=95|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=376}} In his view, this elite would be \"superior people\" who displayed the \"Satanic\" qualities of creativity and nonconformity.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=376}} He regarded these traits as capable of hereditary transmission, and made the claim that \"Satanists are born, not made\".{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=376}} He believed that the elite should be siphoned off from the rest of the human \"herd\", with the latter being forced into ghettoes, ideally \"space ghettoes\" located on other planets.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=375}}\nThe anthropologist Jean La Fontaine highlighted an article that appeared in a LaVeyan magazine, ''The Black Flame'', in which one writer described \"a true Satanic society\" as one in which the population consists of \"free-spirited, well-armed, fully-conscious, self-disciplined individuals, who will neither need nor tolerate any external entity 'protecting' them or telling them what they can and cannot do.\"{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=97}} This rebellious approach conflicts with LaVey's firm beliefs in observing the [[rule of law]].{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=97}} Although personally neither a [[fascism|fascist]] nor [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]],{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=373}} LaVey was on good terms with various neo-Nazi and other right-wing groups operating in the United States.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=368}}\n\n===Magic===\n{{main|Greater and lesser magic}}\n\n[[File:Aleister Crowley.jpg|thumb|right|150px|LaVey's understanding of magic was influenced by the British occultist Aleister Crowley]]\n\nAlthough LaVey's ideas were largely shaped around a secular and scientific world-view, he also expressed a belief in [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1pp=3\u20134|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=336}} Rather than characterising magic as a [[supernatural]] phenomenon, LaVey expressed the view that it was a part of the natural world thus far undiscovered by scientists.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|pp=3\u20134}} Outlined in ''The Satanic Bible'', LaVey defined magic as \"the change in situations or events in accordance with one's will, which would, using normally accepted methods, be unchangeable\",{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1pp=288&ndash;289|2a1=Petersen|2y=2012|2p=95|3a1=Lap|3y=2013|3p=96|4a1=van Luijk|4y=2016|4p=342}} a definition that reflects the influence of the British occultist [[Aleister Crowley]].{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=342}} Although he never explained exactly how he believed that this magical process worked,{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=339}} LaVey stated that magicians could successfully utilise this magical force through intensely imagining their desired goal and thus directing the force of their own willpower toward it.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1p=4|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=339}} He emphasised the idea that magical forces could be manipulated through \"purely emotional\" rather than intellectual acts.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=339}}\n\nThis practice puts LaVeyan Satanism within a wider tradition of 'high magic' or ceremonial magic,{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=339}} and has also been compared with [[Christian Science]] and [[Scientology]].{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=4}} LaVey adopted beliefs and ideas from older magicians but consciously de-Christianised and Satanised them for his own purposes.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=337}}\nIn presenting himself as applying a scientific perspective on magic, LaVey was likely influenced by Crowley, who had also presented his approach to magic in the same way.{{sfn|Dyrendal|2012|p=376}} However, in contrast to many older ceremonial magicians, LaVey denied that there was any division between [[black magic]] and [[white magic]],{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=289|2a1=Dyrendal|2y=2012|2p=377|3a1=Dyrendal|3a2=Petersen|3a3=Lewis|3y=2016|3p=86}} attributing this dichotomy purely to the \"smug hypocrisy and self-deceit\" of those who called themselves \"white magicians\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|2012|p=377}} He similarly differed from many older magicians who emphasised magic as a practice designed to bring about personal transformation and transcendence; rather, for LaVey magic was employer for material gain, personal influence, to harm enemies, and to gain success in love and sex.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|pp=336\u2013337}}\n\nLaVey defined his system of magic as [[greater and lesser magic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=289|2a1=Petersen|2y=2012|2pp=95\u201396|3a1=Lap|3y=2013|3p=97|4a1=Dyrendal|4a2=Lewis|4a3=Petersen|4y=2016|4p=86}} Greater magic is a form of ritual practice and is meant as psychodramatic catharsis to focus one's emotional energy for a specific purpose. These rites are based on three major psycho-emotive themes: ''compassion'' ([[love]]), ''destruction'' (hate), and ''sex'' (lust).{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=86}} The space in which a ritual is performed is known as an \"intellectual decompression chamber\",{{sfn|The Invention of Satanism Dyrendal, Petersen|2016|page=89}} where skepticism and disbelief are willfully suspended, thus allowing the magicians to fully express their mental and emotional needs, holding back nothing regarding their deepest feelings and desires. This magic could then be employed to ensure sexual gratification, material gain, personal success, or to curse one's enemies.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=289}} LaVey also wrote of \"the balance factor\", insisting that any magical aims should be realistic.{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=98}} These rituals are often considered to be magical acts,{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=98}} with LaVey's Satanism encouraging the practice of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] to aid one's selfish ends.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=21}} Much of Satanic ritual is designed for an individual to carry out alone; this is because concentration is seen as key to performing magical acts.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|pp=98\u201399}}\n\nLesser magic, also referred to an \"everyday\" or \"situational\" magic, is the practice of manipulation by means of applied psychology.

They are considered a touchstone of contemporary organized Satanism that constitute, in effect, brief aphorisms that capture Satanic philosophy.{{sfn|Lewis|2001b|p=192}} The first three statements touch on \"indulgence\", \"vital existence\" and \"undefiled wisdom\" which presents a positive view of the Satanist as a carnal, physical and pragmatic being, where enjoyment of physical existence and an undiluted view of this-worldly truth are promoted as the core values of Satanism, combining elements of Darwinism and Epicureanism. Statement four, five and six deal in matters of ethics, through \"kindness to those who deserve it\", \"vengeance\" and \"responsibility to the responsible\", painting a harsh picture of society and human relations by emphasizing justice rather than love. Statements seven, eight and nine reject the dignity of man, sin and the Christian church. Humans are characterized as \"just another animal\", traditional \"sins\" are promoted as means for gratification, and religion as mere business. The adversarial and [[Antinomy|antinomian]] aspect of Satan takes precedence in support of statements four through nine, with non-conformity being presented as a core ideal.{{sfn|Petersen|2011|pp=159-160}}\n\n# Satan represents [[Pleasure|indulgence]] instead of [[abstinence]].\n# Satan represents [[Self-preservation|vital existence]] instead of [[Delusion|spiritual pipe dreams]].\n# Satan represents [[Perspicacity|undefiled wisdom]] instead of hypocritical [[Self-deception|self-deceit]].\n# Satan represents [[Conditional love|kindness to those who deserve it]], instead of [[Unconditional love|love wasted on ingrates]].\n# Satan represents [[Revenge|vengeance]] instead of [[turning the other cheek]].\n# Satan represents [[Accountability|responsibility to the responsible]] instead of concern for [[Victim playing|psychic vampires]].\n# Satan represents man as just another animal who, because of his \"[[Anthropocentrism|divine spiritual and intellectual development]]\", has become the [[Human\u2013wildlife conflict|most vicious animal of all]].\n# Satan represents all of the [[Seven deadly sins|so-called sins]], as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification.\n# Satan has been the best friend the [[Christian Church|Church]] has ever had, as he has kept it in business all these years.{{sfnm|1a1=Drury|1y=2003|1pp=191&ndash;192|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=71|3a1=Van Luijk|3y=2016|3p=297}}\n\n===The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth===\n\n# Do not give opinions or advice unless you are asked.\n# Do not tell your troubles to others unless you are sure they want to hear them.\n# When in another's home, show them respect or else do not go there.\n# If a guest in your home annoys you, treat him cruelly and without mercy.\n# Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal.\n# Do not take that which does not belong to you unless it is a burden to the other person and they cry out to be relieved.\n# Acknowledge the power of magic if you have employed it successfully to obtain your desires.

This should be accompanied by various candles, all but one of which are to be black. The lone exception is to be a white candle, used in destructive magic, which is kept to the right of the altar.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=98}} Also to be included are a bell which is rung nine times at the start and end of the ceremony, a chalice made of anything but gold, and which contains an alcoholic drink symbolizing the \"Elixir of Life\", a sword that represents aggression, a model phallus used as an [[aspergillum]], a gong, and parchment on which requests to Satan are to be written before being burned.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=98}} Although alcohol was consumed in the church's rites, [[drunkenness]] was frowned upon and the taking of illicit drugs was forbidden.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=100}}\n\nLaVeyan rituals sometimes include anti-Christian blasphemies, which are intended to have a liberating effect on the participants.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=98}}\nIn some of the rituals, a naked woman serves as the altar; in these cases it is made explicit that the woman's body itself becomes the altar, rather than have her simply lying on an existing altar.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=97}} In contrast to longstanding stereotypes about Satanists, there is no place for sexual orgies in LaVeyan ritual.{{sfnm|1a1=La Fontaine|1y=1999|1p=97|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=337}} Neither animal nor human sacrifice takes place.{{sfnm|1a1=La Fontaine|1y=1999|1p=97|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=338}} Children are banned from attending these rituals, with the only exception being the Satanic Baptism, which is specifically designed to involve infants.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=97}}\n\nLaVey also developed his own [[Black Mass]], which was designed as a form of deconditioning to free the participant from any inhibitions that they developed living in Christian society.{{sfnm|1a1=Petersen|1y=2012|1pp=96&ndash;97|2a1=Faxneld|2y=2013|2p=76|3a1=Lap|3y=2013|3p=98}} He noted that in composing the Black Mass rite, he had drawn upon the work of the French fiction writers [[Charles Baudelaire]] and [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]].{{sfn|Faxneld|2013|p=86}} LaVey openly toyed with the use of literature and popular culture in other rituals and ceremonies, thus appealing to artifice, pageantry, and showmanship.{{sfn|Petersen|2012|pp=106&ndash;107}} For instance, he published an outline of a ritual which he termed the \"Call to Cthulhu\" which drew upon the stories of the alien god [[Cthulhu]] authored by American horror writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. In this rite, set to take place at night in a secluded location near to a turbulent body of water, a celebrant takes on the role of Cthulhu and appears before the assembled Satanists, signing a pact between them in the language of Lovecraft's fictional \"Old Ones\".{{sfn|Petersen|2012|p=106}}\n\n===Holidays===\n{{main|Satanic holidays}}\n\nLaVey and the Church of Satan deemed an individual's birthday to be the most important day of the year.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2001b|1p=50|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=288|3a1=Lap|3y=2013|3p=99|4a1=van Luijk|4y=2016|4p=330}} [[Walpurgisnacht]] (April 30) is celebrated as the date on which LaVey founded his Church.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2001b|1pp=50&ndash;51|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=288}} A third annual festival is [[Halloween]], which also has associations with magic and dark entities.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2001b|1p=51|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=288}}\n\n===Symbolism===\n[[Image:SamaelLilithGoatPentagram.png|thumb|right|The Sigil of Baphomet]]\nAs a symbol of his Satanic church, LaVey adopted the upturned five-pointed pentagram.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=26}} The upturned pentagram had previously been used by the French occultist [[Eliphas L\u00e9vi]], and had been adopted by his disciple, [[Stanislas de Guaita]], who merged it with a goat's head in his 1897 book, ''Key of Black Magic''.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=26}} In the literature and imagery predating LaVey, imagery used to represent the \"satanic\" is denoted by inverted crosses and blasphemous parodies of Christian art. The familiar goat's head inside an inverted pentagram did not become the foremost symbol of Satanism until the founding of the Church of Satan in 1966.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=20}} LaVey learned of this variant of the symbol after it had been reproduced on the front cover of Maurice Bessy's [[coffee table book]], ''Pictorial History of Magic and the Supernatural''.{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=26|2a1=Lewis|2y=2001b|2p=20}} Feeling that this symbol embodied his philosophy, LaVey decided to adopt it for his Church.{{sfn|Lewis|2001b|p=20}} In its formative years, the church utilized this image on its membership cards, stationary, medallions and most notably above the altar in the ritual chamber of the Black House.{{sfn|Lewis|2001b|p=21}}\n\nDuring the writing of ''The Satanic Bible'', it was decided that a unique version of the symbol should be rendered to be identified exclusively with the church. LaVey created a new version of Guaita's image, one which was geometrically precise, with two perfect circles surrounding the pentagram, the goat head redrawn, and the Hebrew lettering altered to look more serpentine.{{sfn|Lewis|2001b|p=21}} LaVey had this design copyrighted to the church,{{sfn|Lewis|2001b|p=21}} claiming authorship under the pseudonym of \"Hugo Zorilla\".{{sfn|Partridge|2005|p=376}} In doing so, the symbol &ndash; which came to be known as the [[Sigil of Baphomet]]{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2001b|1p=20|2a1=Partridge|2y=2005|2p=376}} &ndash; came to be closely associated with Satanism in the public imagination.{{sfn|Lewis|2001b|p=20}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins: 1966\u201372===\nAlthough there were forms of religious Satanism that predated the creation of LaVeyan Satanism\u2014namely those propounded by [[Stanis\u0142aw Przybyszewski]] and [[Ben Kadosh]]\u2014these had no unbroken lineage of succession to LaVey's form.{{sfn|Faxneld|2013|p=75}} For this reason, the sociologist of religion [[Massimo Introvigne]] stated that \"with few exceptions, LaVey is at the origins of all contemporary Satanism\".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=299}} Similarly, the historian Ruben van Luijk claimed that the creation of LaVeyan Satanism marked \"the actual beginning of Satanism as a religion such as it is practiced in the world today\".{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=297}}\n\nAfter he came to public attention, LaVey shielded much of his early life in secrecy, and little is known about it for certain.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=295}} He had been born in [[Chicago]] as Howard Stanton Levey in either March or April 1930.{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1p=51|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=300}} He was of mixed Ukrainian, Russian, and German ancestry.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=51}} He claimed to have worked in the [[circus]] and [[carnival]] in the years following the [[Second World War]],{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=301}} and in later years, he also alleged that he worked at the San Francisco Orchestra, although this never existed.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=301}} He also claimed to have had a relationship with a young [[Marilyn Monroe]], although this too was untrue.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=300\u2013301}}\n\nBy the 1960s he was living at 6114 California Street in San Francisco, a house that he had inherited from his parents.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|pp=294, 296}} He took an interest in occultism and amassed a large collection of books on the subject.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=296}} At some point between 1957 and 1960 he began hosting classes at his house every Friday in which lectures on occultism and other subjects were given.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=52}} Among the topics covered were [[freak]]s, [[extra-sensory perception]], [[Spiritualism]], [[cannibalism]], and historical methods of [[torture]].{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=296}} An informal group established around these lectures, which came to be known as the Magic Circle.{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1p=52|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=296}} Among those affiliated with this gathering were the filmmaker and [[Thelema|Thelemite]] occultist [[Kenneth Anger]],{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=53}} and the anthropologist [[Michael Harner]], who later established the [[core shamanism]] movement.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=53}}\n\nLaVey likely began preparations for the formation of his [[Church of Satan]] in either 1965 or early 1966,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=52}} and it was officially founded on [[Walpurgisnacht]] 1966.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1p=5|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=285|3a1=Baddeley|3y=2010|3p=71|4a1=Dyrendal|4a2=Lewis|4a3=Petersen|4y=2016|4p=52}} He then declared that 1966 marked Year One of the new Satanic era.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=297}} It was the first organized church in modern times to be devoted to the figure of Satan,{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=5}} and according to Faxneld and Petersen, the church represented \"the first public, highly visible, and long-lasting organisation which propounded a coherent satanic discourse\".{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2013|p=81}} Its early members were the attendees of LaVey's Magic Circle, although it soon began attracting new recruits.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=53}} Many of these individuals were sadomasochists or homosexuals, attracted by the LaVeyan openness to different sexual practices.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=346}} LaVey had painted his house black,{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=296}} with it becoming known as \"the [[Black House (Church of Satan)|Black

night.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=53}}\n\nLaVey played up to his Satanic associations by growing a pointed beard and wearing a black cloak and inverted pentagram.{{sfn|Drury|2003|p=188}} He added to his eccentric persona by obtaining unusual pets, including a lion that was kept caged in his back garden.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=296}} Describing himself as the \"High Priest of Satan\",{{sfn|Drury|2003|p=197}} LaVey defined his position within the church as \"monarchical in nature, papal in degree and absolute in power\".{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=287}} He led the churches' governing Council of Nine,{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=287}} and implemented a system of five initiatory levels that the LaVeyan Satanist could advance through by demonstrating their knowledge of LaVeyan philosophy and their personal accomplishments in life.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=287}} These were known as Apprentice Satanist I\u00b0, Witch or Warlock II\u00b0, Priest or Priestess of Mendes III\u00b0,

the use of topless women to attract attention alienated a number of the church's early members.{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1p=54|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=346}} Through these and other activities, he soon attracted international media attention, being dubbed \"the Black Pope\".{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=71}} He also attracted a number of celebrities to join his Church, most notably [[Sammy Davis Junior]] and [[Jayne Mansfield]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=286|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=72|3a1=Schipper|3y=2010|3pp=105&ndash;106}} LaVey also established branches of the church, known as ''grottos'', in various parts of the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=287|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=74}} He may have chosen the term ''grotto'' over ''[[coven]]'' because the latter term had come to be used by practitioners of the modern Pagan religion of [[Wicca]].{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=344}} These included the Babylon Grotto in [[Detroit]], the Stygian Grotto in [[Dayton]], and the Lilith Grotto in [[New York City]].{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=74}} In 1971, a Dutch follower of LaVey's, Maarten Lamers, established his own Kerk van Satan grotto in [[Amsterdam]].{{sfnm|1a1=Introvigne|1y=2016|1p=519|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2pp=344\u2013345}}\n\nAs a result of the success of the film ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' and the concomitant growth of interest in Satanism, an editor at [[Avon Books]], Peter Mayer, approached LaVey and commissioned him to write a book, which became ''[[The Satanic Bible]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1p=8|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=72}} While part of the text was LaVey's original writing, other sections of the book consisted of direct quotations from [[Arthur Desmond]]'s right-wing tract ''[[Might is Right]]'' and the occultist [[Aleister Crowley]]'s version of [[John Dee]]'s ''Enochian Keys''.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1p=8|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=315}} There is evidence that LaVey was inspired by the writings of the American philosopher [[Ayn Rand]]; and while accusations that he plagiarized her work in ''The Satanic Bible'' have been denied by one author, {{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=9}} Chris Mathews stated that \"LaVey stole selectively and edited lightly\" and that his \"Satanism at times closely parallels Ayn Rand's [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist philosophy]].\"{{sfn|Mathews|2009|p=65-66}} The book ''The Satanic Bible'' served to present LaVey's ideas to a far wider audience than they had previously had.{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=72}} In 1972, he published a sequel, ''The Satanic Rituals''.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=298}}\n\nLaVey's Church emerged at a point in American history when Christianity was on the decline as many of the nation's youth broke away from their parental faith and explored alternative systems of religiosity.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=298}} The milieu in which LaVey's Church was operating was dominated by the [[counterculture of the 1960s]]; his Church reflected some of its concerns &ndash; free love, alternative religions, freedom from church and state &ndash; but ran contrary to some of the counterculture's other main themes, such as peace and love, compassion, and the use of mind-altering drugs.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=295|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=298}} He expressed condemnation of the [[hippies]];

The court found in Hegarty's favour, after which LaVey immediately declared bankruptcy.{{sfnm|1a1=Introvigne|1y=2016|1p=516|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2pp=377\u2013378}} In May 1992, the ex-couple reached a settlement. The Black House was sold to a wealthy friend, the property developer Donald Werby, who agreed to allow LaVey to continue living at the residence for free.{{sfnm|1a1=Introvigne|1y=2016|1p=516|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=378}} Also in 1992, LaVey published his first book in twenty years, ''The Devil's Notebook''.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=287}} This was followed by the posthumous ''Satan Speaks'' in 1998, which included a foreword from the rock singer [[Marilyn Manson]],{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=287|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=516}} who was a priest in the church.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=384}}\n\nIn his final years, LaVey suffered from a heart condition, displayed increasing paranoia, and died in October 1997.{{sfnm|1a1=Introvigne|1y=2016|2p=516|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2pp=378\u2013379}} In November, the church announced that it would subsequently be run by two High Priestesses of joint rank, Barton and LaVey's daughter [[Karla LaVey]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=516}} That same year, the church established an official website.{{sfn|Petersen|2013|p=140}} Barton attempted to purchase the Black House from Werby, but was unable to raise sufficient funds; the building had fallen into disrepair and was demolished in 2001, subsequently being replaced with an apartment block.{{sfnm|1a1=Introvigne|1y=2016|1p=516|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=380}} A disagreement subsequently emerged between Barton and Karla, resulting in an agreement that Barton would retain legal ownership of the name and organization of the church while LaVey's personal belongings and copyrights would be distributed among his three children, Karla, Zeena, and Satan Xerxes.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=287|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2pp=516\u2013517}} Barton stood down as High Priestess in 2002, although continued to chair the church's Council of Nine.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=517}} The headquarters of the church were then moved from San Francisco to New York, where [[Peter H. Gilmore]] was appointed the church's High Priest, and his wife Peggy Nadramia as its High Priestess.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=517}}\n\n[[File:Peter H Gilmore 2 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|Peter Gilmore, High Priest of the Church of Satan]]\n\nAfter LaVey's death, conflict over the nature of Satanism intensified within the Satanic community.{{sfn|Petersen|2013|p=139}} At Halloween 1999 Karla established the [[First Satanic Church]], which uses its website to promote the idea that it represents a direct continuation of the original Church of Satan as founded by Anton LaVey.{{sfnm|1a1=Gallagher|1y=2006|1p=162|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=380}} Other LaVeyan groups appeared elsewhere in the United States. An early member of the Church of Satan, John Dewey Allee, established his own First Church of Satan, claiming allegiance to LaVey's original teachings and professing that LaVey himself had deviated from them in later life.{{sfn|Gallagher|2006|p=162}} In 1986, Paul Douglas Valentine founded the New York City-based [[World Church of Satanic Liberation]], having recruited many of its members through [[Herman Slater]]'s Magickal Childe esoteric store. Its membership remained small and it was discontinued in 2011.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=517}} In 1991, the Embassy of Lucifer was established by the Canadian [[Tsirk Susuej]], which was influenced by LaVeyan teachings but held that Satan was a real entity.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=518}} Splinter groups from Susuej's organisation included the Embassy of Satan in [[Stewart, British Columbia]], and the Luciferian Light Group in [[Baltimore]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=518}}\n\nLaVeyan groups also cropped up elsewhere in the world, with a particular concentration in Scandinavia; most of these Scandinavian groups either split from the Church of Satan or never affiliated with it.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=520}} These included the Svenska Satanistkyrkan and the Det Norske Sataniske Samfunn,{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=520}} as well as the Prometheus Grotten of the Church of Satan which was established in Denmark in 1997 but which officially seceded in 2000.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=520}} A Satanic Church was also established in [[Estonia]] based on the LaVeyan model; it later renamed itself the [[Order of the Black Widow]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=519\u2013520}}\n\nThe Church of Satan became increasingly doctrinally-rigid and focused on maintaining the purity of LaVeyan Satanism.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1p=5|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=380}} The church's increased emphasis on their role as the bearer of LaVey's legacy was partly a response to the growth in non-LaVeyan Satanists.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=5}} Some Church members &ndash; including Gilmore{{sfn|Petersen|2013|p=140}} &ndash; claimed that only they were the \"real\" Satanists and that those belonging to different Satanic traditions were \"pseudo\" Satanists.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1p=5|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=380}} After examining many of these claims on the church's website, Lewis concluded that it was \"''obsessed'' with shoring up its own legitimacy by attacking the heretics, especially those who criticize LaVey\".{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=7}} Meanwhile, the church experienced an exodus of its membership in the 2000s, with many of these individuals establishing new groups online.{{sfn|Petersen|2013|p=139}} Although the church's public face had performed little ceremonial activity since the early 1970s, in June 2006 they held a Satanic 'High Mass' in Los Angeles to mark the church's fortieth birthday.{{sfn|Petersen|2012|pp=115&ndash;116}}\n\n==Demographics==\n\nMembership levels of the Church of Satan are hard to determine, as the organisation has not released such information.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=287|2a1=Petersen|2y=2005|2p=430}} During its early years, the church claimed a membership of around 10,000, although defectors subsequently claimed that the number was only in the hundreds.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=344}} Membership was largely, although not exclusively, white.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|pp=369\u2013370}} LaVey recognised this, suggesting that the church appealed particularly to white Americans because they lacked the strong sense of ethnic identity displayed by African-Americans and Hispanic Americans.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=370}} The historian of religion [[Massimo Introvigne]] suggested that it had never had more than 1000 or 2000 members at its height, but that LaVeyan ideas had had a far greater influence through LaVey's books.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=320}} Membership is gained by paying $225 and filling out a registration statement,{{sfn|Petersen|2005|p=430}} and thus initiates are bestowed with lifetime memberships and not charged annual fees.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=287}}\n\nLa Fontaine thought it likely that the easy availability of LaVey's writings would have encouraged the creation of various Satanic groups that were independent of the Church of Satan itself.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=100}} In ''The Black Flame'', a number of groups affiliated with the church have been mentioned, most of which are based in the United States and Canada although two groups were cited as having existed in New Zealand.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=100}} In his 2001 examination of Satanists, the sociologist [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] noted that, to his surprise, his findings \"consistently pointed to the centrality of LaVey's influence on modern Satanism\".{{sfn|Lewis|2001a|p=5}} \"Reflecting the dominant influence of Anton LaVey's thought\", Lewis noted that the majority of those whom he examined were atheists or agnostics, with 60% of respondents viewing Satanism as a symbol rather than a real entity.{{sfn|Lewis|2001a|p=11}} 20% of his respondents described ''The Satanic Bible'' as the most important factor that attracted them to Satanism.{{sfn|Lewis|2001a|p=15}} Elsewhere, Lewis noted that few Satanists who weren't members of the Church of Satan would regard themselves as \"orthodox LaVeyans\".{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=2}}\n \nExamining the number of LaVeyan Satanists in Britain, in 1995 the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey noted that the Church of Satan had no organized presence in the country.{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=290}} He noted that LaVey's writings were widely accessible in British bookshops,{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=290}} and La Fontaine suggested that there may have been individual Church members within the country.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=100}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal bar|Religion|Philosophy}}\n*{{annotated link|Contemporary Religious Satanism|''Contemporary Religious Satanism''}}\n*{{annotated link|Satanic ritual abuse}}\n*{{annotated link|Devil in popular culture}}\n*{{annotated link|Conceptions of God}}\n*{{annotated link|Nontheistic religions}}\n*{{annotated link|Religious naturalism}}\n*{{annotated link|Secular religion}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite contribution |last=Alfred |first=A. |contribution=The Church of Satan |title=The New Religious Consciousness |editor=C.

Scholars of religion have classified it as a [[new religious movement]] and a form of [[Western esotericism]]. It is one of several different movements that describe themselves as forms of [[Satanism]].\n\nLaVey established LaVeyan Satanism in the U.S. state of [[California]] through the founding of his [[Church of Satan]] on [[Walpurgisnacht]] of 1966, which he proclaimed to be \"the Year One\", ''Anno Satanas''\u2014the first year of the \"Age of Satan\". His ideas were heavily influenced by the ideas and writings of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Ayn Rand]]. The church grew under LaVey's leadership, with regional ''[[Grotto (Satanism)|grottos]]'' being founded across the United States. A number of these seceded from the church to form independent Satanic organizations during the early 1970s. In 1975, LaVey abolished the grotto system, after which Satanism became a far less organized movement, although it remained greatly influenced by LaVey's writings. In coming years, members of the church left it to establish their own organisations, also following LaVeyan Satanism, among them John Dewey Allee's First Church of Satan and [[Karla LaVey]]'s [[First Satanic Church]].\n\nThe religion's doctrines are codified in LaVey's book, ''[[The Satanic Bible]]''. The religion is [[materialist]], rejecting the existence of supernatural beings, [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|body-soul dualism]], and [[Afterlife|life after death]]. Practitioners do not believe that [[Satan]] literally exists and do not worship him. Instead, Satan is viewed as a positive archetype representing [[pride]], [[wiktionary:carnal|carnality]], and [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]]. He is also embraced as a [[symbol]] of defiance against [[Abrahamic religions]] which LaVeyans criticize for suppressing humanity's natural instincts and encouraging irrationality. The religion propagates a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] worldview, seeing mankind as animals existing in an [[amorality|amoral]] universe. It promotes a philosophy based on [[individualism]] and [[rational egoism|egoism]], coupled with [[Social Darwinism]] and [[anti-egalitarianism]].\n\nLaVeyan Satanism involves the practice of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], which encompasses two distinct forms; [[greater and lesser magic]]. Greater magic is a form of [[ritual]] practice and is meant as [[psychodramatic]] [[catharsis]] to focus one's emotional energy for a specific purpose. These rites are based on three major psycho-emotive themes: ''compassion'' ([[love]]), ''destruction'' ([[hate]]), and ''sex'' ([[lust]]).  Lesser magic is the practice of [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] by means of [[applied psychology]] and [[Glamour (presentation)|glamour]] (or [[Deception|\"wile and guile\"]]) to bend an individual or situation to one's will.\n\n==Definition==\n{{LaVeyan Satanism sidebar}}\nLaVeyan Satanism &ndash; which is also sometimes termed \"Modern Satanism\"{{sfnm|1a1=Lap|1y=2013|1p=83|2a1=Dyrendal|2y=2013|2p=124}} and \"Rational Satanism\"{{sfnm|1a1=Petersen|1y=2009|1p=224|2a1=Dyrendal|2y=2013|2p=123}} &ndash; is classified by scholars of [[religious studies]] as a [[new religious movement]].{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2013||p=81}} When used, \"Rational Satanism\" is often employed to distinguish the approach of the LaVeyan Satanists from the \"Esoteric Satanism\" embraced by groups like the [[Temple of Set]].{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1y=2012|1p=370|2a1=Petersen|2y=2012|2p=95}} A number of religious studies scholars have also described it as a form of \"self-religion\" or \"self-spirituality\",{{sfnm|1a1=Harvey|1y=1995|1p=290|2a1=Partridge|2y=2004|2p=82|3a1=Petersen|3y=2009|3pp=224&ndash;225|4a1=Schipper|4y=2010|4p=108|5a1=Faxneld|5a2=Petersen|5y=2013|5p=79}} with religious studies scholar Amina Olander Lap arguing that it should be seen as being both part of the \"prosperity wing\" of the self-spirituality [[New Age]] movement and a form of the [[Human Potential Movement]].{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=84}} Conversely, the scholar of Satanism Jesper Aa.

and when asked about his religion, stated that \"the reason it's called Satanism is because it's fun, it's accurate and it's productive\".{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=290}}\n\nLaVey also conceptualised Satan as a symbol of the individual's own vitality,{{sfn|Schipper|2010|p=107}} thus representing an autonomous power within,{{sfn|Schipper|2010|p=106}} and a representation of personal liberty and individualism.{{sfn|Cavaglion|Sela-Shayovitz|2005|p=255}} Throughout ''The Satanic Bible'', the LaVeyan Satanist's view of god is described as the Satanist's true \"self\"\u2014a projection of his or her own personality\u2014not an external deity.{{sfn|Wright|1993|p=143}} In works like ''The Satanic Bible'', LaVey often uses the terms \"god\" and \"Satan\" interchangeably, viewing both as

interpretation of Satan, and some members of his Church understood the Devil as an entity that really existed.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=348}} It is possible that LaVey left some ambivalence in his writings so as not to drive away those Church members who were theistic Satanists.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=355}}\nBoth LaVey's writings and the publications of the church continue to refer to Satan as if he were a real being, in doing so seeking to reinforce the Satanist's self-interest.{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=291}}\n\nLaVey used Christianity as a negative mirror for his new faith,{{sfn|Schipper|2010|p=109}} with LaVeyan Satanism rejecting the basic principles and theology of Christian belief.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=96}} It views Christianity &ndash; alongside other major religions, and philosophies such as [[humanism]] and [[liberal democracy]] &ndash; as a largely negative force on humanity; LaVeyan Satanists perceive Christianity as a lie which promotes idealism, self-denigration, herd behavior, and irrationality.{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2013|p=80}} LaVeyans view their religion as a force for redressing this balance by encouraging materialism, egoism, stratification, carnality, atheism, and social Darwinism.{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2013|p=80}} LaVey's Satanism was particularly critical of what it understands as Christianity's denial of humanity's animal nature, and it instead calls for the celebration of, and indulgence in, these desires.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=96}} In doing so, it places an emphasis on the carnal rather than the

was anti-egalitarian and elitist, believing in the fundamental inequality of different human beings.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=289|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=366}} His philosophy was [[Social

added\".{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2001a|1p=18|2a1=Lewis|2y=2002|2p=9}} Characterising LaVey as a Nietzschean, the religious studies scholar Asbj\u00f8rn Dyrendal nevertheless thought that LaVey's \"personal synthesis seems decidedly his own creation, even though the different ingredients going into it are at times very visible.\"{{sfn|Dyrendal|2012|p=370}} Social Darwinism is particularly noticeable in ''The Book of Satan'', where LaVey uses portions of Redbeard's ''[[Might Is Right]]'', though it also appears throughout in references to man's inherent strength and instinct for self-preservation.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=4}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n\n | image1 = Nietzsche187a.jpg\n | alt1 = Friedrich Nietzsche\n | link1 = [Friedrich Nietzsche]\n\n | image2 = \n | alt2

human being was explicitly viewed as an animal,{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1p=4|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=288|3a1=Baddeley|3y=2010|3p=74|4a1=Lap|4y=2013|4p=94}} who thus has no purpose other than [[survival of the fittest]], and who therefore exists in an [[amorality|amoral]] context.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=4}} He believed that in adopting a philosophical belief in its own superiority above that of the other animals, humankind has become \"the most vicious animal of all\".{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=94}} For LaVey, non-human animals and children represent an ideal, \"the purest form of carnal existence\", because they have not been indoctrinated with Christian or other religious concepts of guilt and shame.{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=95}} His ethical views focused around placing oneself and one's family before others, minding one's own business, and &ndash; for men &ndash; behaving like a [[gentleman]].{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=289}} In responding to threats and harm, he promoted a policy of ''[[Eye for an eye|lex talionis]]'', for instance reversing a Biblical Christian teaching by stating that \"if a man smite thee on the one cheek, ''smash'' him on the other.\"{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=289}}\n\nLaVeyan Satanism places great emphasis on the role of [[liberty]] and personal freedom.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=322}} LaVey believed that the ideal Satanist should be individualistic and non-conformist, rejecting what he called the \"colorless existence\" that mainstream society sought to impose on those living within it.{{sfn|Dyrendal|2013|p=129}} He rejected [[consumerism]] and what he called the \"death cult\" of [[fashion]].{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=374}} He praised the human [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]] for encouraging an individual's pride, self-respect, and self-realization and accordingly believed in satisfying the ego's desires.{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=92}} He expressed the view that self-indulgence was a desirable trait,{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|2011|p=198}} and that hate and aggression were not wrong or undesirable emotions but that they were necessary and advantageous for survival.{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=94}} Accordingly, he praised the [[Seven Deadly Sins]] as virtues which were beneficial for the individual.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=288|2a1=Schipper|2y=2010|2p=107}}\n\nSimilarly, LaVey criticized the negative and restrictive attitude to sexuality present in many religions, instead supporting any sexual acts that take place between consenting adults.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=288|2a1=Lap|2y=2013|2p=91|3a1=Faxneld|3a2=Petersen|3y=2014|3p=168|4a1=van Luijk|4y=2016|4p=321}} His Church welcomed homosexual members from its earliest years,{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2014|p=168}} and he also endorsed celibacy for those who were [[asexuality|asexual]].{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2014|p=168}} He sought to discourage negative feelings of guilt arising from sexual acts such as masturbation and fetishes,{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=91}} and believed that rejecting these sexual inhibitions and guilt would result in a happier and healthier society.{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2014|p=169}} Discussing women, LaVey argued that they should use sex as a tool to manipulate men, in order to advance their own personal power.{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2014|p=170}} Conversely, non-consensual sexual relations, such as [[rape]] and [[child sexual abuse|child molestation]], were denounced by LaVey and his Church.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=288|2a1=Maxwell-Stuart|2y=2011|2p=198}}\n\nLaVey believed in the imminent demise of Christianity.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=357}} In addition, he believed that society would enter an Age of Satan, in which a generation living in accordance with LaVeyan principles would come to power.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=379}}\nLaVey supported [[eugenics]] and expected it to become a necessity in the future, when it would be used to breed an elite who reflected LaVey's \"Satanic\" principles.{{sfnm|1a1=Lap|1y=2013|1p=95|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=376}} In his view, this elite would be \"superior people\" who displayed the \"Satanic\" qualities of creativity and nonconformity.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=376}} He regarded these traits as capable of hereditary transmission, and made the claim that \"Satanists are born, not made\".{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=376}} He believed that the elite should be siphoned off from the rest of the human \"herd\", with the latter being forced into ghettoes, ideally \"space ghettoes\" located on other planets.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=375}}\nThe anthropologist Jean La Fontaine highlighted an article that appeared in a LaVeyan magazine, ''The Black Flame'', in which one writer described \"a true Satanic society\" as one in which the population consists of \"free-spirited, well-armed, fully-conscious, self-disciplined individuals, who will neither need nor tolerate any external entity 'protecting' them or telling them what they can and cannot do.\"{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=97}} This rebellious approach conflicts with LaVey's firm beliefs in observing the [[rule of law]].{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=97}} Although personally neither a [[fascism|fascist]] nor [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]],{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=373}} LaVey was on good terms with various neo-Nazi and other right-wing groups operating in the United States.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=368}}\n\n===Magic===\n{{main|Greater and lesser magic}}\n\n[[File:Aleister Crowley.jpg|thumb|right|150px|LaVey's understanding of magic was influenced by the British occultist Aleister Crowley]]\n\nAlthough LaVey's ideas were largely shaped around a secular and scientific world-view, he also expressed a belief in [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1pp=3\u20134|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=336}} Rather than characterising magic as a [[supernatural]] phenomenon, LaVey expressed the view that it was a part of the natural world thus far undiscovered by scientists.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|pp=3\u20134}} Outlined in ''The Satanic Bible'', LaVey defined magic as \"the change in situations or events in accordance with one's will, which would, using normally accepted methods, be unchangeable\",{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1pp=288&ndash;289|2a1=Petersen|2y=2012|2p=95|3a1=Lap|3y=2013|3p=96|4a1=van Luijk|4y=2016|4p=342}} a definition that reflects the influence of the British occultist [[Aleister Crowley]].{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=342}} Although he never explained exactly how he believed that this magical process worked,{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=339}} LaVey stated that magicians could successfully utilise this magical force through intensely imagining their desired goal and thus directing the force of their own willpower toward it.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1p=4|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=339}} He emphasised the idea that magical forces could be manipulated through \"purely emotional\" rather than intellectual acts.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=339}}\n\nThis practice puts LaVeyan Satanism within a wider tradition of 'high magic' or ceremonial magic,{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=339}} and has also been compared with [[Christian Science]] and [[Scientology]].{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=4}} LaVey adopted beliefs and ideas from older magicians but consciously de-Christianised and Satanised them for his own purposes.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=337}}\nIn presenting himself as applying a scientific perspective on magic, LaVey was likely influenced by Crowley, who had also presented his approach to magic in the same way.{{sfn|Dyrendal|2012|p=376}} However, in contrast to many older ceremonial magicians, LaVey denied that there was any division between [[black magic]] and [[white magic]],{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=289|2a1=Dyrendal|2y=2012|2p=377|3a1=Dyrendal|3a2=Petersen|3a3=Lewis|3y=2016|3p=86}} attributing this dichotomy purely to the \"smug hypocrisy and self-deceit\" of those who called themselves \"white magicians\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|2012|p=377}} He similarly differed from many older magicians who emphasised magic as a practice designed to bring about personal transformation and transcendence; rather, for LaVey magic was employer for material gain, personal influence, to harm enemies, and to gain success in love and sex.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|pp=336\u2013337}}\n\nLaVey defined his system of magic as [[greater and lesser magic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=289|2a1=Petersen|2y=2012|2pp=95\u201396|3a1=Lap|3y=2013|3p=97|4a1=Dyrendal|4a2=Lewis|4a3=Petersen|4y=2016|4p=86}} Greater magic is a form of ritual practice and is meant as psychodramatic catharsis to focus one's emotional energy for a specific purpose. These rites are based on three major psycho-emotive themes: ''compassion'' ([[love]]), ''destruction'' (hate), and ''sex'' (lust).{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=86}} The space in which a ritual is performed is known as an \"intellectual decompression chamber\",{{sfn|The Invention of Satanism Dyrendal, Petersen|2016|page=89}} where skepticism and disbelief are willfully suspended, thus allowing the magicians to fully express their mental and emotional needs, holding back nothing regarding their deepest feelings and desires. This magic could then be employed to ensure sexual gratification, material gain, personal success, or to curse one's enemies.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=289}} LaVey also wrote of \"the balance factor\", insisting that any magical aims should be realistic.{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=98}} These rituals are often considered to be magical acts,{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=98}} with LaVey's Satanism encouraging the practice of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] to aid one's selfish ends.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=21}} Much of Satanic ritual is designed for an individual to carry out alone; this is because concentration is seen as key to performing magical acts.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|pp=98\u201399}}\n\nLesser magic, also referred to an \"everyday\" or \"situational\" magic, is the practice of manipulation by means of applied psychology. LaVey defined it as \"wile and guile obtained through various devices and contrived situations, which when utilized, can create change in accordance with one's will.\"{{sfn|Witchcraft and Magic in Europe, Volume 6: The Twentieth Century|Blecourt, Hutton, Fontaine|1999|p=91}} LaVey wrote that a key concept in lesser magic is the \u201ccommand to look\u201d, which can be accomplished by utilizing elements of \u201csex, sentiment, and wonder\u201d,{{sfn|Controversial New Religions|Lewis, Petersen|p=418}} in addition to the utilization of looks, body language, scents,{{sfn|The Devil's Party: Satanism in Modernity|Faxneld, Petersen|2013|page=97}} color, patterns, and odor.{{sfn|Handbook of Religion and the Authority of Science|Lewis, Hammer|2014|p=90}} This system encourages a form of manipulative role-play, wherein the practitioner may alter several elements of their physical appearance in order to aid them in seducing or \"bewitching\" on object of desire.{{sfn|The Devil's Party: Satanism in Modernity|Faxneld, Petersen|2013|p=97}}\n\nLaVey developed \u201cThe Synthesizer Clock\u201d, the purpose of which is to divide humans into distinct groups of people based primarily on body shape and personality traits.{{sfn|The Devil's Party: Satanism in Modernity|Faxneld, Petersen|2013|p=97}} The synthesizer is modeled as a clock, and based on concepts of [[somatotypes]].{{sfn|Handbook of Religion and the Authority of Science|Petersen|2010|p=67}} The clock is intended to aid a witch in identifying themselves, subsequently aiding in utilizing the \u201cattraction of opposites\u201d to \u201cspellbind\u201d the witch's object of desire by assuming the opposite role.{{sfn|The Devil's Party: Satanism in Modernity|Faxneld, Petersen|2013|p=97}} The successful application of lesser magic is said to be built upon one's understanding of their place on the clock.{{sfn|Sexuality and New Religious Movements|Lewis, Bogdan|2014|p=}} Upon finding your position on the clock, you are encouraged to adapt it as seen fit, and perfect your type by harmonizing its element for better success.{{sfn|The Devil's Party: Satanism in Modernity|Faxneld, Petersen|2013|p=97}} Dyrendal referred to LaVey's techniques as \u201c[[Erving Goffman]] meets [[William Mortensen]]\u201d.{{sfn|Controversial New Religions|Lewis, Petersen|2014|page=418}} Drawing insights from psychology, biology, and sociology,{{sfn|Handbook of Religion and the Authority of Science|Lewis, Hammer|2010|p=89}} Petersen noted that lesser magic combines occult and \u201crejected sciences of body analysis [and] temperaments.\u201d{{sfn|Handbook of Religion and the Authority of Science|Lewis, Hammer|2010|p=68}}\n\n==Basic tenets==\n\nThe \"central convictions\" of LaVeyan Satanism are formulated into three lists, which are regularly reproduced within the Church of Satan's written material.{{sfn|Petersen|2005|p=431}}\n\n===The Nine Satanic Statements===\n[[File:Alchemy sulfur symbol.svg|thumb|right|150px|The [[alchemical symbol]] for [[Sulfur]], as it appears in ''The Satanic Bible'' above the Nine Satanic Statements.]]\n''The Nine Satanic Statements'' are a set of nine assertions made by LaVey in the introductory chapters of ''The Satanic Bible''. They are considered a touchstone of contemporary organized Satanism that constitute, in effect, brief aphorisms that capture Satanic philosophy.{{sfn|Lewis|2001b|p=192}} The first three statements touch on \"indulgence\", \"vital existence\" and \"undefiled wisdom\" which presents a positive view of the Satanist as a carnal, physical and pragmatic being, where enjoyment of physical existence and an undiluted view of this-worldly truth are promoted as the core values of Satanism, combining elements of Darwinism and Epicureanism. Statement four, five and six deal in matters of ethics, through \"kindness to those who deserve it\", \"vengeance\" and \"responsibility to the responsible\", painting a harsh picture of society and human relations by emphasizing justice rather than love. Statements seven, eight and nine reject the dignity of man, sin and the Christian church. Humans are characterized as \"just another animal\", traditional \"sins\" are promoted as means for gratification, and religion as mere business. The adversarial and [[Antinomy|antinomian]] aspect of Satan takes precedence in support of statements four through nine, with non-conformity being presented as a core ideal.{{sfn|Petersen|2011|pp=159-160}}\n\n# Satan represents [[Pleasure|indulgence]] instead of [[abstinence]].\n# Satan represents [[Self-preservation|vital existence]] instead of [[Delusion|spiritual pipe dreams]].\n# Satan represents [[Perspicacity|undefiled wisdom]] instead of hypocritical [[Self-deception|self-deceit]].\n# Satan represents [[Conditional love|kindness to those who deserve it]], instead of [[Unconditional love|love wasted on ingrates]].\n# Satan represents [[Revenge|vengeance]] instead of [[turning the other cheek]].\n# Satan represents [[Accountability|responsibility to the responsible]] instead of concern for [[Victim playing|psychic vampires]].\n# Satan represents man as just another animal who, because of his \"[[Anthropocentrism|divine spiritual and intellectual development]]\", has become the [[Human\u2013wildlife conflict|most vicious animal of all]].\n# Satan represents all of the [[Seven deadly sins|so-called sins]], as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification.\n# Satan has been the best friend the [[Christian Church|Church]] has ever had, as he has kept it in business all these years.{{sfnm|1a1=Drury|1y=2003|1pp=191&ndash;192|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=71|3a1=Van Luijk|3y=2016|3p=297}}\n\n===The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth===\n\n# Do not give opinions or advice unless you are asked.\n# Do not tell your troubles to others unless you are sure they want to hear them.\n# When in another's home, show them respect or else do not go there.\n# If a guest in your home annoys you, treat him cruelly and without mercy.\n# Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal.\n# Do not take that which does not belong to you unless it is a burden to the other person and they cry out to be relieved.\n# Acknowledge the power of magic if you have employed it successfully to obtain your desires.

This should be accompanied by various candles, all but one of which are to be black. The lone exception is to be a white candle, used in destructive magic, which is kept to the right of the altar.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=98}} Also to be included are a bell which is rung nine times at the start and end of the ceremony, a chalice made of anything but gold, and which contains an alcoholic drink symbolizing the \"Elixir of Life\", a sword that represents aggression, a model phallus used as an [[aspergillum]], a gong, and parchment on which requests to Satan are to be written before being burned.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=98}} Although alcohol was consumed in the church's rites, [[drunkenness]] was frowned upon and the taking of illicit drugs was forbidden.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=100}}\n\nLaVeyan rituals sometimes include anti-Christian blasphemies, which are intended to have a liberating effect on the participants.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=98}}\nIn some of the rituals, a naked woman serves as the altar; in these cases it is made explicit that the woman's body itself becomes the altar, rather than have her simply lying on an existing altar.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=97}} In contrast to longstanding stereotypes about Satanists, there is no place for sexual orgies in LaVeyan ritual.{{sfnm|1a1=La Fontaine|1y=1999|1p=97|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=337}} Neither animal nor human sacrifice takes place.{{sfnm|1a1=La Fontaine|1y=1999|1p=97|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=338}} Children are banned from attending these rituals, with the only exception being the Satanic Baptism, which is specifically designed to involve infants.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=97}}\n\nLaVey also developed his own [[Black Mass]], which was designed as a form of deconditioning to free the participant from any inhibitions that they developed living in Christian society.{{sfnm|1a1=Petersen|1y=2012|1pp=96&ndash;97|2a1=Faxneld|2y=2013|2p=76|3a1=Lap|3y=2013|3p=98}} He noted that in composing the Black Mass rite, he had drawn upon the work of the French fiction writers [[Charles Baudelaire]] and [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]].{{sfn|Faxneld|2013|p=86}} LaVey openly toyed with the use of literature and popular culture in other rituals and ceremonies, thus appealing to artifice, pageantry, and showmanship.{{sfn|Petersen|2012|pp=106&ndash;107}} For instance, he published an outline of a ritual which he termed the \"Call to Cthulhu\" which drew upon the stories of the alien god [[Cthulhu]] authored by American horror writer [[H.

In this rite, set to take place at night in a secluded location near to a turbulent body of water, a celebrant takes on the role of Cthulhu and appears before the assembled Satanists, signing a pact between them in the language of Lovecraft's fictional \"Old Ones\".{{sfn|Petersen|2012|p=106}}\n\n===Holidays===\n{{main|Satanic holidays}}\n\nLaVey and the Church of Satan deemed an individual's birthday to be the most important day of the year.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2001b|1p=50|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=288|3a1=Lap|3y=2013|3p=99|4a1=van Luijk|4y=2016|4p=330}} [[Walpurgisnacht]] (April 30) is celebrated as the date on which LaVey founded his Church.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2001b|1pp=50&ndash;51|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=288}} A third annual festival is [[Halloween]], which also has associations with magic and dark entities.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2001b|1p=51|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=288}}\n\n===Symbolism===\n[[Image:SamaelLilithGoatPentagram.png|thumb|right|The Sigil of Baphomet]]\nAs a symbol of his Satanic church, LaVey adopted the upturned five-pointed pentagram.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=26}} The upturned pentagram had previously been used by the French occultist [[Eliphas L\u00e9vi]], and had been adopted by his disciple, [[Stanislas de Guaita]], who merged it with a goat's head in his 1897 book, ''Key of Black Magic''.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=26}} In the literature and imagery predating LaVey, imagery used to represent the \"satanic\" is denoted by inverted crosses and blasphemous parodies of Christian art. The familiar goat's head inside an inverted pentagram did not become the foremost symbol of Satanism until the founding of the Church of Satan in 1966.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=20}} LaVey learned of this variant of the symbol after it had been reproduced on the front cover of Maurice Bessy's [[coffee table book]], ''Pictorial History of Magic and the Supernatural''.{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=26|2a1=Lewis|2y=2001b|2p=20}} Feeling that this symbol embodied his philosophy, LaVey decided to adopt it for his Church.{{sfn|Lewis|2001b|p=20}} In its formative years, the church utilized this image on its membership cards, stationary, medallions and most notably above the altar in the ritual chamber of the Black House.{{sfn|Lewis|2001b|p=21}}\n\nDuring the writing of ''The Satanic Bible'', it was decided that a unique version of the symbol should be rendered to be identified exclusively with the church. LaVey created a new version of Guaita's image, one which was geometrically precise, with two perfect circles surrounding the pentagram, the goat head redrawn, and the Hebrew lettering altered to look more serpentine.{{sfn|Lewis|2001b|p=21}} LaVey had this design copyrighted to the church,{{sfn|Lewis|2001b|p=21}} claiming authorship under the pseudonym of \"Hugo Zorilla\".{{sfn|Partridge|2005|p=376}} In doing so, the symbol &ndash; which came to be known as the [[Sigil of Baphomet]]{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2001b|1p=20|2a1=Partridge|2y=2005|2p=376}} &ndash; came to be closely associated with Satanism in the public imagination.{{sfn|Lewis|2001b|p=20}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins: 1966\u201372===\nAlthough there were forms of religious Satanism that predated the creation of LaVeyan Satanism\u2014namely those propounded by [[Stanis\u0142aw Przybyszewski]] and [[Ben Kadosh]]\u2014these had no unbroken lineage of succession to LaVey's form.{{sfn|Faxneld|2013|p=75}} For this reason, the sociologist of religion [[Massimo Introvigne]] stated that \"with few exceptions, LaVey is at the origins of all contemporary Satanism\".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=299}} Similarly, the historian Ruben van Luijk claimed that the creation of LaVeyan Satanism marked \"the actual beginning of Satanism as a religion such as it is practiced in the world today\".{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=297}}\n\nAfter he came to public attention, LaVey shielded much of his early life in secrecy, and little is known about it for certain.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=295}} He had been born in [[Chicago]] as Howard Stanton Levey in either March or April 1930.{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1p=51|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=300}} He was of mixed Ukrainian, Russian, and German ancestry.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=51}} He claimed to have worked in the [[circus]] and [[carnival]] in the years following the [[Second World War]],{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=301}} and in later years, he also alleged that he worked at the San Francisco Orchestra, although this never existed.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=301}} He also claimed to have had a relationship with a young [[Marilyn Monroe]], although this too was untrue.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=300\u2013301}}\n\nBy the 1960s he was living at 6114 California Street in San Francisco, a house that he had inherited from his parents.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|pp=294, 296}} He took an interest in occultism and amassed a large collection of books on the subject.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=296}} At some point between 1957 and 1960 he began hosting classes at his house every Friday in which lectures on occultism and other subjects were given.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=52}} Among the topics covered were [[freak]]s, [[extra-sensory perception]], [[Spiritualism]], [[cannibalism]], and historical methods of [[torture]].{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=296}} An informal group established around these lectures, which came to be known as the Magic Circle.{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1p=52|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=296}} Among those affiliated with this gathering were the filmmaker and [[Thelema|Thelemite]] occultist [[Kenneth Anger]],{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=53}} and the anthropologist [[Michael Harner]], who later established the [[core shamanism]] movement.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=53}}\n\nLaVey likely began preparations for the formation of his [[Church of Satan]] in either 1965 or early 1966,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=52}} and it was officially founded on [[Walpurgisnacht]] 1966.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1p=5|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=285|3a1=Baddeley|3y=2010|3p=71|4a1=Dyrendal|4a2=Lewis|4a3=Petersen|4y=2016|4p=52}} He then declared that 1966 marked Year One of the new Satanic era.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=297}} It was the first organized church in modern times to be devoted to the figure of Satan,{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=5}} and according to Faxneld and Petersen, the church represented \"the first public, highly visible, and long-lasting organisation which propounded a coherent satanic discourse\".{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2013|p=81}} Its early members were the attendees of LaVey's Magic Circle, although it soon began attracting new recruits.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=53}} Many of these individuals were sadomasochists or homosexuals, attracted by the LaVeyan openness to different sexual practices.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=346}} LaVey had painted his house black,{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=296}} with it becoming known as \"the [[Black House (Church of Satan)|Black

night.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=53}}\n\nLaVey played up to his Satanic associations by growing a pointed beard and wearing a black cloak and inverted pentagram.{{sfn|Drury|2003|p=188}} He added to his eccentric persona by obtaining unusual pets, including a lion that was kept caged in his back garden.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=296}} Describing himself as the \"High Priest of Satan\",{{sfn|Drury|2003|p=197}} LaVey defined his position within the church as \"monarchical in nature, papal in degree and absolute in power\".{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=287}} He led the churches' governing Council of Nine,{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=287}} and implemented a system of five initiatory levels that the LaVeyan Satanist could advance through by demonstrating their knowledge of LaVeyan philosophy and their personal accomplishments in life.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=287}} These were known as Apprentice Satanist I\u00b0, Witch or Warlock II\u00b0, Priest or Priestess of Mendes III\u00b0,

the use of topless women to attract attention alienated a number of the church's early members.{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1p=54|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=346}} Through these and other activities, he soon attracted international media attention, being dubbed \"the Black Pope\".{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=71}} He also attracted a number of celebrities to join his Church, most notably [[Sammy Davis Junior]] and [[Jayne Mansfield]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=286|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=72|3a1=Schipper|3y=2010|3pp=105&ndash;106}} LaVey also established branches of the church, known as ''grottos'', in various parts of the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=287|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=74}} He may have chosen the term ''grotto'' over ''[[coven]]'' because the latter term had come to be used by practitioners of the modern Pagan religion of [[Wicca]].{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=344}} These included the Babylon Grotto in [[Detroit]], the Stygian Grotto in [[Dayton]], and the Lilith Grotto in [[New York City]].{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=74}} In 1971, a Dutch follower of LaVey's, Maarten Lamers, established his own Kerk van Satan grotto in [[Amsterdam]].{{sfnm|1a1=Introvigne|1y=2016|1p=519|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2pp=344\u2013345}}\n\nAs a result of the success of the film ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' and the concomitant growth of interest in Satanism, an editor at [[Avon Books]], Peter Mayer, approached LaVey and commissioned him to write a book, which became ''[[The Satanic Bible]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1p=8|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=72}} While part of the text was LaVey's original writing, other sections of the book consisted of direct quotations from [[Arthur Desmond]]'s right-wing tract ''[[Might is Right]]'' and the occultist [[Aleister Crowley]]'s version of [[John Dee]]'s ''Enochian Keys''.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1p=8|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=315}} There is evidence that LaVey was inspired by the writings of the American philosopher [[Ayn Rand]];

his Church reflected some of its concerns &ndash; free love, alternative religions, freedom from church and state &ndash; but ran contrary to some of the counterculture's other main themes, such as peace and love, compassion, and the use of mind-altering drugs.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=295|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=298}} He expressed condemnation of the [[hippies]];

Its membership remained small and it was discontinued in 2011.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=517}} In 1991, the Embassy of Lucifer was established by the Canadian [[Tsirk Susuej]], which was influenced by LaVeyan teachings but held that Satan was a real entity.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=518}} Splinter groups from Susuej's organisation included the Embassy of Satan in [[Stewart, British Columbia]], and the Luciferian Light Group in [[Baltimore]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=518}}\n\nLaVeyan groups also cropped up elsewhere in the world, with a particular concentration in Scandinavia; most of these Scandinavian groups either split from the Church of Satan or never affiliated with it.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=520}} These included the Svenska Satanistkyrkan and the Det Norske Sataniske Samfunn,{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=520}} as well as the Prometheus Grotten of the Church of Satan which was established in Denmark in 1997 but which officially seceded in 2000.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=520}} A Satanic Church was also established in [[Estonia]] based on the LaVeyan model; it later renamed itself the [[Order of the Black Widow]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=519\u2013520}}\n\nThe Church of Satan became increasingly doctrinally-rigid and focused on maintaining the purity of LaVeyan Satanism.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1p=5|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=380}} The church's increased emphasis on their role as the bearer of LaVey's legacy was partly a response to the growth in non-LaVeyan Satanists.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=5}} Some Church members &ndash; including Gilmore{{sfn|Petersen|2013|p=140}} &ndash; claimed that only they were the \"real\" Satanists and that those belonging to different Satanic traditions were \"pseudo\" Satanists.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1p=5|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=380}} After examining many of these claims on the church's website, Lewis concluded that it was \"''obsessed'' with shoring up its own legitimacy by attacking the heretics, especially those who criticize LaVey\".{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=7}} Meanwhile, the church experienced an exodus of its membership in the 2000s, with many of these individuals establishing new groups online.{{sfn|Petersen|2013|p=139}} Although the church's public face had performed little ceremonial activity since the early 1970s, in June 2006 they held a Satanic 'High Mass' in Los Angeles to mark the church's fortieth birthday.{{sfn|Petersen|2012|pp=115&ndash;116}}\n\n==Demographics==\n\nMembership levels of the Church of Satan are hard to determine, as the organisation has not released such information.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=287|2a1=Petersen|2y=2005|2p=430}} During its early years, the church claimed a membership of around 10,000, although defectors subsequently claimed that the number was only in the hundreds.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=344}} Membership was largely, although not exclusively, white.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|pp=369\u2013370}} LaVey recognised this, suggesting that the church appealed particularly to white Americans because they lacked the strong sense of ethnic identity displayed by African-Americans and Hispanic Americans.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=370}} The historian of religion [[Massimo Introvigne]] suggested that it had never had more than 1000 or 2000 members at its height, but that LaVeyan ideas had had a far greater influence through LaVey's books.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=320}} Membership is gained by paying $225 and filling out a registration statement,{{sfn|Petersen|2005|p=430}} and thus initiates are bestowed with lifetime memberships and not charged annual fees.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=287}}\n\nLa Fontaine thought it likely that the easy availability of LaVey's writings would have encouraged the creation of various Satanic groups that were independent of the Church of Satan itself.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=100}} In ''The Black Flame'', a number of groups affiliated with the church have been mentioned, most of which are based in the United States and Canada although two groups were cited as having existed in New Zealand.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=100}} In his 2001 examination of Satanists, the sociologist [[James R.

Lewis]] noted that, to his surprise, his findings \"consistently pointed to the centrality of LaVey's influence on modern Satanism\".{{sfn|Lewis|2001a|p=5}} \"Reflecting the dominant influence of Anton LaVey's thought\", Lewis noted that the majority of those whom he examined were atheists or agnostics, with 60% of respondents viewing Satanism as a symbol rather than a real entity.{{sfn|Lewis|2001a|p=11}} 20% of his respondents described ''The Satanic Bible'' as the most important factor that attracted them to Satanism.{{sfn|Lewis|2001a|p=15}} Elsewhere, Lewis noted that few Satanists who weren't members of the Church of Satan would regard themselves as \"orthodox LaVeyans\".{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=2}}\n \nExamining the number of LaVeyan Satanists in Britain, in 1995 the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey noted that the Church of Satan had no organized presence in the country.{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=290}} He noted that LaVey's writings were widely accessible in British bookshops,{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=290}} and La Fontaine suggested that there may have been individual Church members within the country.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=100}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal bar|Religion|Philosophy}}\n*{{annotated link|Contemporary Religious Satanism|''Contemporary Religious Satanism''}}\n*{{annotated link|Satanic ritual abuse}}\n*{{annotated link|Devil in popular culture}}\n*{{annotated link|Conceptions of God}}\n*{{annotated link|Nontheistic religions}}\n*{{annotated link|Religious naturalism}}\n*{{annotated link|Secular religion}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite contribution |last=Alfred |first=A. |contribution=The Church of Satan |title=The New Religious Consciousness |editor=C.

Therefore Alat is an independent language that became distinct very early from the Oguz Turkic languages.<ref>Doerfer 1971</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ataturk.com/content/view/55/89/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109062059/http://www.ataturk.com/content/view/55/89/ |archivedate=2008-11-09}}</ref> Because of these distinct features, scholars speculated that the Alat (''Khalaj'') is a descendant of the [[Oghur languages|Ogur]] branch of the Turkic family, but there is no firm scholarly consensus on its affinities.\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Afghanistan]]\n*[[History of China]]\n*[[History of Kazakhstan]]\n*[[Alash Orda]]\n*[[History of Kyrgyzstan]]\n*[[History of Mongolia]]\n*[[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus]]\n*[[Oghur languages]]\n*[[Khalaj language]]\n*[[Khalji dynasty|Khalji]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=klj Khalaj, Turkic]\n* [http://www.language-archives.org/language/klj Resources in and about the Turkic Khalaj language]\n* [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/316083/Khalaj-language Khalaj language]\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book | last =Doerfer | first =Gerhard | publication-date =1971 | title =Khalaj Materials | publication-place =Bloomington, Indiana | publisher =Indiana University Publications | isbn =0-87750-150-5 | oclc =240052}}\n*{{cite book | author=Doerfer, Gerhard | title=Grammatik des Chaladsch |location=Wiesbaden | publisher=Harrassowitz | year=1998 | isbn=3-447-02865-3}}\n*{{cite book |author1=Doerfer, Gerhard |author2=Tezcan, Semih | title=Folklore-Texte der Chaladsch| location=Wiesbaden| publisher=Harrassowitz| year=1994}}\n*{{cite book |author1=Johanson, Lars |author2=Csat\u00f3, \u00c9va \u00c1gnes | title=The Turkic Languages | location=London | publisher=Routledge | year=1998}}\n\n{{Turkic languages}}\n{{Turkic topics}}\n{{Turkic peoples}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Alat (Tribe)}}\n[[Category:Turkic peoples of Asia]]\n", "name_user": "Erminwin", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eName", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alat_tribe"}

Santino also started to reunite with the priests again. Meanwhile, the DSWD came to the monastery and needed to take Santino away from the priests because another couple saw the records of all the kids in the DSWD. They also saw the records of Santino so they planned to take Santino. The couple adopted Santino, but the wife tried to \"re-live\" her dead son in the person of Santino. This caused the couple problems, and it was decided that he be returned to the DSWD. Meanwhile, Rico's accident finally makes Malena a changed woman. Aside from paying Santino the proper apologies for all her misdeeds, Malena also drops by Baby and Ato's store to say sorry for all her shortcomings. Later, after having a fight with Tilde, Malena's fall off a cliff put her in a rather critical condition, which eventually led to her untimely death. Santino tries reviving her, just as Rico requested, but even his miraculous hands couldn\u2019t change Malena's fate. On the other hand, Tilde's previous threats to Malena instantly backfire. Incidentally, someone witnessed what she had done to Malena. Father Jose applies for a job in a nearby resort, but it was discovered that his workplace is actually a casino. Santino sees Enrique in the place; the latter asked him to remain silent about that, but the former refused.

Pretty much aware of the scarcity of water in Bagong Pag-asa, she ends up selling her remaining supply for a pretty unreasonable price. Despite the old lady's bad reputation, Santino and his friends end up defending her from enraged neighbors; but instead of showing gratitude to the said kids, she ends up driving them away. On the other hand, the heat wave phenomenon in Bagong Pag-asa finally takes its toll on its residents; but despite the said fact, Enrique remains unmoved regarding the matter. Enrique then verbally harasses Mario, whom he accused of being Bagong Pag-asa's jueteng lord. A fire in Bagong Pag-asa destroyed Atong and Baby's livelihood; a newly-wed (to Tilde) Enrique helped them, but in return they would have to blame Cocoy for the fire, even if the fire was just an accident.

After the incident, Cocoy discovers that Santino has actually gone astray. And given the said situation, he is left with no other choice but to remain at large up until he finds the missing miracle kid. Incidentally, after obliviously walking around the streets of Manila to look for his big brother Cocoy, Santino finds himself spending sometime with Santa Claus. Santa Claus pursues his calling of giving out gifts from one house to another, and surprisingly, he ends up finding himself in his very own house. Immediately, his son Ramon recognizes him; but instead of greeting him with a hearty welcome, the lad instantly shoves him away. Ramon tries warning his younger sister Lea. Surprisingly, in contrast to her brother's display of disgust, Lea is somehow looking forward to seeing her biological father; so she makes it a plan to look for him before her time finally runs out. In order to fulfill his promise to Totoy, Santino drops by the hospital to lay his miraculous hand on Lea; and after successfully doing so, they rush to the precinct in order to check on Totoy's condition.

Incidentally, all these good deeds she has to offer have corresponding prices. Apparently, she is a self-professed material girl, and any thing that could bring her cash is basically worth her while. During one of their conversations, Santino tells Mia about the 1-million-peso reward Enrique is giving out in exchange for him and others are also in pursuit of the reward money; and upon learning about this, the young lady couldn\u2019t help but feel the urge of getting her hand on the said bundle of cash. Upon getting her chance, Mia tricks Santino to go with her, alone. At the last minute, Mia changes her mind about bringing Santino back to Bagong Pag-asa.

Without hesitation, Enrique gives his full support to Franco's case. He instantly suggests a DNA test; and once the DNA test results prove that Franco is in fact Santino's biological father, the DSWD will then be awarding Santino's custody to him. After Enrique finds out that Franco is not the real father, Enrique decided to have a DNA test. It is then proven that Enrique is Santino's real father, and the DNA sample Franco gave was actually Enrique's.

However, she was able to escape under the pretense of labor; while being driven, she got the gun of Dante, the policeman driving the vehicle. Rico was resentful of Santino because of their father's death. Santino then felt sad as he believes he's bad luck due to the death of Enrique and the anger of Rico; Father Jose told him that he was not the Santino who was trying to be happy despite the hardships and trials. Meanwhile, Santino was being told by a voice (possibly Satan's) that he should come to it and he was cursed by Bro. He ends up being helped by angels on his way and ends up at a home for the homeless, run by Lola Milgaros, a blind grandmother. Meanwhile, a Filipino-Chinese businessman named Mr. Chan is trying to put into action his plan to take the house and the land where it stands for his business expansion.

And to his delight, he alone gets his hands on the most sensational news there is, Rico's exclusive encounters with his so-called Bro ''(later revealed as Satan)''. Though a non-believer of such events, Paulo pursues this rather controversial issue for his show's sake. Santino has now returned to Bagong Pag-asa, but his former petty argument with Rico turns out to be a completely heated dispute. Apparently, Santino tries relaying Bro's real message to Rico, which instantly infuriates the latter. Given the rather controversial situation, Paulo then gets another angle for a truly sensational scoop. And to his surprise, the tension is further heightened up by Tilde's hired con-artist. This results in an accident which endangered Stella's life; but fortunately, Santino is around to save her. Meanwhile, detainees in Bagong Pag-asa's jail held the police chief hostage, and ordered all policemen to give them their arms. After the commotion in Bagong Pag-asa Jail ended in a miracle, a group of radicals led by Tilde's con-artist try to get Santino to perform more miracles so they may believe. Their actions however compromise Santino's safety and eventually puts his life in danger. Hearing of this, Paolo rescues Santino ''(who is fleeing from the radicals)'' and makes him stay in a secluded countryside villa he rented for his tenure in Bagong Pag-asa. There he takes care of Santino until it is safe for him to return. In one interview session, Paolo reveals to Santino an event that triggered his loss of faith in Christ; during his tenure as a missionary, the bombing of a chapel built by his congregation resulted in the death of several people and his co-missionaries. In the remains of the chapel, he managed to save a baby which died when he thought Jesus would help it. He threw away his habit and abandoned his vocation in despair.

As Mario contacts the monks of Santino's safety while driving the latter back to Bagong Pag-asa, Tilde deviously abducts Mario's daughter Joy, and calls Mario to request that Santino be brought to her in exchange for Joy's release. Santino convinces Mario that he would respond to Tilde's request; Mario agreeing unconditionally out of his desperate situation. Although Mario would not be giving Santino to Tilde, the young boy was abducted by Tilde, who asked the former to cure her sickness. Tilde was enraged and locked up Santino in a closet when Santino refused to heal her since he has no more power to cure the sick. Tilde then insistently commands him to lay his miraculous hands on her, but she accidentally pushes Santino off a flight of stairs, causing Santino's head to hit very hard on the floor, thus, causing him to instantly lose his consciousness\u2014just as Rico once predicted. Santino was then hospitalized, but when his chances of survival were declining, the priests then decided to bring his dying body to the monastery. Santino dies in the monastery, and his wish to reunite with his parents was finally granted, though it caused deep grief to everyone. People then flocked to Bagong Pag-asa in order to pay the necessary respects to his remains, while Tilde awaits sentencing for her crimes. During funeral preparations were underway, Santino wakes up alive after he was told by his parents ''(revealed to be Enrique and Teresa)'' in the afterlife that the time for him to be reunited with them has not yet come, and he still needs to continue his mission on Earth, and to be with and protect his half-brother Rico. This miracle was witnessed by Paolo, who saw the young boy sitting alongside Bro. People of Bagong Pag-asa rejoiced upon seeing Santino alive once more. This occurrence brought back Paolo's faith in God, and Santino lives a normal life thereafter. In the end of the series, Paolo gives a narration on what hope for him is and how Santino changed his life, and is now back on his vocation of priesthood after witnessing the miracle.\n\n*[[Charo Santos-Concio]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] - the mother of Bro.

But it\u2019s great to note that the gamble has paid off in a big way: ''May Bukas Pa'' has been enjoying very good ratings, proving what we\u2019ve been saying all this time--that viewers want to be inspired by the dramas they watch..\" However, he criticized the show's \"religious\" scenes which are \"poorly, shallowly staged, thus making genuine inspiration and devotion difficult to come by while viewing the series.\" He further criticized the show's use of extras mostly playing sick people, who turn out to be bad actors. He adds, \"Any director worth his salt would have sensed that the montage of healing needed good actors to make it meaningful and moving. Why were inept actors used instead?

Learning of the incident, Mr. Chan has a change of heart and quits his pursuit by giving Milagros a check of a huge sum of money for repairs and necessities.\n\n*[[Gloria Sevilla]] as Lola Milagros - A blind old woman who is the owner of a home open to homeless people.\n*Jeff Henson Dee as Mr. Chan - a wealthy [[Chinese Filipino]] businessman who is constantly trying to take the house for the homeless as well as the land where it stands. He later helps Milagros after arsonists set fire to her house.\n\n===Chapter Thirty-Seven: Believe===\nA Manila-based journalist named Paulo Pe\u00f1aflor arrives at Bagong Pag-asa to search for news featuring the miracles in the small town. And to his delight, he alone gets his hands on the most sensational news there is, Rico's exclusive encounters with his so-called Bro ''(later revealed as Satan)''. Though a non-believer of such events, Paulo pursues this rather controversial issue for his show's sake. Santino has now returned to Bagong Pag-asa, but his former petty argument with Rico turns out to be a completely heated dispute. Apparently, Santino tries relaying Bro's real message to Rico, which instantly infuriates the latter. Given the rather controversial situation, Paulo then gets another angle for a truly sensational scoop. And to his surprise, the tension is further heightened up by Tilde's hired con-artist. This results in an accident which endangered Stella's life; but fortunately, Santino is around to save her. Meanwhile, detainees in Bagong Pag-asa's jail held the police chief hostage, and ordered all policemen to give them their arms. After the commotion in Bagong Pag-asa Jail ended in a miracle, a group of radicals led by Tilde's con-artist try to get Santino to perform more miracles so they may believe. Their actions however compromise Santino's safety and eventually puts his life in danger. Hearing of this, Paolo rescues Santino ''(who is fleeing from the radicals)'' and makes him stay in a secluded countryside villa he rented for his tenure in Bagong Pag-asa. There he takes care of Santino until it is safe for him to return. In one interview session, Paolo reveals to Santino an event that triggered his loss of faith in Christ; during his tenure as a missionary, the bombing of a chapel built by his congregation resulted in the death of several people and his co-missionaries. In the remains of the chapel, he managed to save a baby which died when he thought Jesus would help it. He threw away his habit and abandoned his vocation in despair. At the monastery, the monks and Mario collaborate with each other to find Santino.\n\n*[[Ryan Agoncillo]] as Paulo Pe\u00f1aflor - A journalist and CBN News Reporter who visits Bagong Pag-asa after hearing about the news of Rico's encounter with \"Bro\". He was a former missionary who abandoned his vocation and lost his faith in Christ.\n\n===Chapter Thirty-Eight: Amen===\nPaolo turns Santino over to Mario and the police chief before going on an errand. As Mario contacts the monks of Santino's safety while driving the latter back to Bagong Pag-asa, Tilde deviously abducts Mario's daughter Joy, and calls Mario to request that Santino be brought to her in exchange for Joy's release. Santino convinces Mario that he would respond to Tilde's request; Mario agreeing unconditionally out of his desperate situation. Although Mario would not be giving Santino to Tilde, the young boy was abducted by Tilde, who asked the former to cure her sickness. Tilde was enraged and locked up Santino in a closet when Santino refused to heal her since he has no more power to cure the sick. Tilde then insistently commands him to lay his miraculous hands on her, but she accidentally pushes Santino off a flight of stairs, causing Santino's head to hit very hard on the floor, thus, causing him to instantly lose his consciousness\u2014just as Rico once predicted. Santino was then hospitalized, but when his chances of survival were declining, the priests then decided to bring his dying body to the monastery. Santino dies in the monastery, and his wish to reunite with his parents was finally granted, though it caused deep grief to everyone. People then flocked to Bagong Pag-asa in order to pay the necessary respects to his remains, while Tilde awaits sentencing for her crimes. During funeral preparations were underway, Santino wakes up alive after he was told by his parents ''(revealed to be Enrique and Teresa)'' in the afterlife that the time for him to be reunited with them has not yet come, and he still needs to continue his mission on Earth, and to be with and protect his half-brother Rico. This miracle was witnessed by Paolo, who saw the young boy sitting alongside Bro. People of Bagong Pag-asa rejoiced upon seeing Santino alive once more. This occurrence brought back Paolo's faith in God, and Santino lives a normal life thereafter. In the end of the series, Paolo gives a narration on what hope for him is and how Santino changed his life, and is now back on his vocation of priesthood after witnessing the miracle.\n\n*[[Charo Santos-Concio]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] - the mother of Bro.

But it\u2019s great to note that the gamble has paid off in a big way: ''May Bukas Pa'' has been enjoying very good ratings, proving what we\u2019ve been saying all this time--that viewers want to be inspired by the dramas they watch..\" However, he criticized the show's \"religious\" scenes which are \"poorly, shallowly staged, thus making genuine inspiration and devotion difficult to come by while viewing the series.\" He further criticized the show's use of extras mostly playing sick people, who turn out to be bad actors. He adds, \"Any director worth his salt would have sensed that the montage of healing needed good actors to make it meaningful and moving. Why were inept actors used instead? Possibly because the production was scrimping on talent fees. Well, it was a penny-wise pound-foolish decision, because the important sequence was botched.\"<ref>[http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20090316-194515/May-Bukas-Pa-plus-and-minus \"\u2018May Bukas Pa,\u2019 plus and minus\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320040119/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20090316-194515/May-Bukas-Pa-plus-and-minus|date=20 March 2009}} by Nestor Torre, 16 March 2009.</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|rowspan=9| 2009 || 1st MTRCB TV Awards || Special Award for Promoting Moral Values || {{won}}\n|-\n| Seoul International Drama Awards<ref>{{cite web|url=http://telebisyon.net/balita/Cristine-Reyes-attends-Seoul-International-Drama-Awards-Eva-Fonda-wins-Special-Prize/artikulo/73679/|title=Cristine Reyes attends Seoul International Drama Awards; Eva Fonda wins Special Prize|publisher=Telebisyon.net|date=23 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017125820/http://telebisyon.net/balita/Cristine-Reyes-attends-Seoul-International-Drama-Awards-Eva-Fonda-wins-Special-Prize/artikulo/73679/|archivedate=17 October 2012}}</ref> || Best Drama Series ||{{nom}}\n|-\n| Catholic Mass Media Awards || Best Drama (tied with [[Tayong Dalawa]]) || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[ASAP (variety show)|ASAP Pop Viewer's Choice Awards]] || Pop Kapamilya New Face (Zajian Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[ASAP (variety show)|ASAP Pop Viewer's Choice Awards]] || Pop Kapamilya TV Show|| {{nom}}\n|-\n| 18th KBP Golden Dove Awards || Best Primetime Drama Series || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Primetime Drama Series || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Male New TV Personality (Zajian Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Drama Actor (Albert Martinez) || {{nom}}\n|-\n| rowspan=4|2010 || 8th Gawad Tanglaw || Special Jury Award for Television || {{won}}\n|-\n| 8th Gawad Tanglaw || Natatanging Gawad TANGLAW para sa Sining ng Telebisyon (Zaijan Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=2|[[2010 GMMSF Box-Office Entertainment Awards|41st GMMSF Box-Office Entertainment Awards]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=579374&publicationSubCategoryId=70|title=Chiz: Don't extend Pagcor chief's term &#124; Headlines, News, The Philippine Star|publisher=philstar.com|date=20 May 2013|accessdate=28 July 2013}}</ref> || TV Program of the Year || {{won}}\n|-\n| TV Directors of the Year (Jojo Saguin and Jerome Pobocan ) || {{won}}\n|}\n\nMay Bukas Pa also received a special award at the 2009 Catholic Mass Media Awards (besides its Best Drama award), given by Cardinal Archbishop [[Gaudencio Rosales]].

The Smiths became famous for starting the \"Pants off in the Park\" movement which entailed patrons removing their pants during live performances. The group consisted of vocalist [[Morrissey]], guitarist [[Johnny Marr]], bassist [[Andy Rourke]], and drummer [[Mike Joyce (musician)|Mike Joyce]]. Critics have called them one of the most important bands to emerge from the British [[independent music]] scene of the 1980s. In 2012, all of their studio albums and one of their compilation albums appeared on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].\n\nBased on the songwriting partnership of Morrissey and Marr, the Smiths' focus on a guitar, bass, and drum sound, and their fusion of 1960s rock and [[post-punk]], were a rejection of the [[synthesiser]]-based [[dance-pop]] of the time. Marr's [[Rickenbacker]] guitar work had a [[jangle pop]] sound reminiscent of [[Roger McGuinn]] of [[the Byrds]].<ref name=\"Marr_Byrds\">{{cite web|last=Rosen|first=Steven|title=Johnny Marr on Fender Signature Guitar: 'It Was Such A Privilege'|work=UltimateGuitar.com (interview)|accessdate=5 May 2014|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506000635/http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/johnny_marr_on_fender_signature_guitar_it_was_such_a_privilege.html}}</ref> Morrissey's complex, literate lyrics combined themes about ordinary people with mordant humour.\n\nThe Smiths signed to the independent record label [[Rough Trade Records]].

The third track that the duo worked on was \"[[Suffer Little Children]]\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=18}} Alongside these original compositions, Morrissey suggested that the band produce a cover of \"I Want a Boy for My Birthday\", a song by the 1960s American girl band [[the Cookies]]; although he had never heard of the song before, Marr agreed, enjoying the subversive element of having a male vocalist sing it, and the song was recorded on his TEAC machine.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=22}}\n\nBy the end of the summer of 1982 Morrissey had chosen the band name \"the Smiths\",{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=34|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2p=20}} later informing an interviewer that \"it was the most ordinary name and I thought it was time that the ordinary folk of the world showed their faces\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=20}} Around the time of the band's formation, Morrissey decided that he would be publicly known only by his surname,{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=34|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2p=42}} with Marr referring to him as \"Mozzer\" or \"Moz\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=21}} In 1983 he forbade those around him from using the name \"Steven\", which he despised.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=21}}\n\nAfter remaining with the band for several rehearsals, Pomfret departed acrimoniously.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=19}} He was replaced by the bass player Dale Hibbert, who worked at Manchester's Decibel Studios, where Marr had met him while recording Freak Party's demo.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=20}} It was through Hibbert that the Smiths were able to record their first demo at Decibel, doing so one night in August 1982.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=23}} Aided by drummer [[Simon Wolstencroft]], whom Marr had worked with in Freak Party, the band recorded both \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\" and \"Suffer Little Children\".{{sfn|Goddard|2003|pp=23\u201324}} Wolstencroft was not interested in joining the band, so auditions were held to find a permanent drummer, which resulted in [[Mike Joyce (musician)|Mike Joyce]] joining them; he later revealed that he was under the influence of [[magic mushrooms]] during his audition performance.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=25\u201326}} Meanwhile, Morrissey took the demo recording to [[Factory Records]], but Factory's [[Tony Wilson]] wasn't interested.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=26\u201327}}\n\nIn October 1982 the Smiths gave their first public performance as a support act for [[Blue Rondo \u00e0 la Turk (band)|Blue Rondo \u00e0 la Turk]] during a student music and fashion show, \"An Evening of Pure Pleasure\", at Manchester's [[The Ritz (Manchester)|The Ritz]] venue.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1pp=34, 35|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2p=27}} During the performance, they played both their own compositions and \"I Want a Boy for My Birthday\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=28}} Morrissey had organised the gig's aesthetic; the band came onstage to [[Klaus Nomi]]'s version of [[Henry Purcell]]'s \"The Cold Song\" playing through the venue's sound system before his friend James Maker stepped onstage to introduce the band.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=27\u201329}} Maker remained onstage during the performance, relating that \"I was given a pair of maracas \u2013 an optional extra \u2013 and carte blanche.

I was there to drink red wine, make extraneous hand gestures and keep well within the tight, chalked circle that Morrissey had drawn around me.\"{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=28\u201329}} Hibbert however was unhappy with what he perceived as the band's gay aesthetic; in turn, Morrissey and Marr were unhappy with his bass playing, so he was removed from the band and replaced by Marr's old school friend [[Andy Rourke]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=36|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2pp=27\u201330}} Hibbert however denies that he had any issue with the band being perceived as a 'gay' band, and was unsure as to the reasons why he was asked to leave the band.<ref>{{cite book| last= Hibbert| first= D |year= 2015| title= Boy Interrupted.

Present at the gig was [[John Walters (broadcaster)|John Walters]], the producer of [[John Peel]]'s [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] show; interested, he invited the band to record a session for the program. Peel expressed the view that \"I was impressed because unlike most bands... you couldn't immediately tell what records they'd been listening to. That's fairly unusual, very rare indeed... It was that aspect of the Smiths that I found most impressive.\"{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=43}} Following this radio exposure, the band gained their first interviews, in music magazines ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=43}}\n\nThe Smiths then agreed to sign a record contract with Rough Trade, with Travis travelling up to Manchester to meet the band at their Crazy Face rehearsal space; there they signed the contract.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=46\u201347}} Only Morrissey and Marr signed it on behalf of the band, and there was no discussion at the time regarding how the band's earnings would be divided up, something that would lead to the eventual argument over royalties which resulted in the 1996 High Court case.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=47}} To produce the band's first album, Travis brought in [[Troy Tate]] of [[the Teardrop Explodes]], and under Tate's supervision the band recorded their first album, provisionally titled ''The Hand That Rocks the Cradle'', at the Elephant Studios in [[Wapping]], [[East London]].{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=47\u201350}} Rough Trade were unhappy with the album that the band produced and Troy's production of it, ordering the band to redo it with a new producer, [[John Porter (musician)|John Porter]].{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=50\u201351}}\n\nThe band soon generated controversy when [[Gary Bushell]] of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' tabloid alleged that their B-side \"Handsome Devil\" was an endorsement of [[paedophilia]].{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=2004|1p=108|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2pp=35\u201336}} The band denied this, with Morrissey stating that the song \"has nothing to do with children, and certainly nothing to do with child molesting\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=37}}\n\nThe follow-up singles \"[[This Charming Man]]\" and \"[[What Difference Does It Make?]]\" fared better when they reached numbers 25 and 12 respectively on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"guinness book\">{{Cite book|last=Roberts|first=David (ed.)|title=British Hit Singles & Albums|publisher=[[HIT Entertainment]]|year=2006|edition=19th|pages=509\u2013510|isbn=1-904994-10-5|title-link=Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums}}</ref> Aided by praise from the music press and a series of studio sessions for Peel and [[David Jensen]] at [[BBC Radio 1]], the Smiths began to acquire a dedicated fan base.\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=\"The Smiths brought realism to their romance, and tempered their angst with the lightest of touches.

This caused an uproar after the grandfather of one of the murdered children heard the song on a [[Public house|pub]] [[jukebox]] and felt the band was trying to commercialise the murders. After meeting with Morrissey, he accepted that the song was a sincere exploration of the impact of the murders.

This collected singles, B-sides and the versions of songs that had been recorded throughout the previous year for the Peel and Jensen shows.\n\n===''Meat Is Murder''===\nEarly in 1985 the band released their second album, ''[[Meat Is Murder]]''. This album was more strident and political than its predecessor, including the pro-vegetarian title track (Morrissey forbade the rest of the group from being photographed eating meat), the light-hearted republicanism of \"Nowhere Fast\", and the anti-[[corporal punishment]] \"The Headmaster Ritual\" and \"Barbarism Begins at Home\". The band had also grown more diverse musically, with Marr adding rockabilly riffs to \"Rusholme Ruffians\" and Rourke playing a funk bass solo on \"Barbarism Begins at Home\". The album was preceded by the re-release of the B-side \"[[How Soon Is Now?]]\" as a single, and although that song was not on the original [[Phonograph record|LP]], it has been added to subsequent releases. ''Meat Is Murder'' was the band's only album (barring compilations) to reach number one in the UK charts.<ref name=album/> In 2003, the album was ranked number 295 on ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 500 albums of all time|url=http://www.archer2000.net/sbs/awardsrs500.html|accessdate=26 April 2013|publisher=Rolling Stone LLC/Archer & Valerie Productions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102200719/http://www.archer2000.net/sbs/awardsrs500.html|archive-date=2 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMorrissey brought a political stance to many of his interviews, courting further controversy. Among his targets were the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]], the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarchy]], and the famine relief project [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]]. Morrissey famously quipped of the last, \"One can have great concern for the people of [[Ethiopia]], but it's another thing to inflict daily torture on the people of England\"<ref>{{cite web| date=18 November 2004 | title=Band Aid vs. Morrissey&nbsp;... | format=http | work=Overyourhead.co.uk | url=http://www.overyourhead.co.uk/2004/11/band-aid-vs.html | accessdate =22 April 2007}}</ref> (\"torture\" being a reference to the music that resulted from the project).

A legal dispute with Rough Trade had delayed the album by almost seven months (it had been completed in November 1985), and Marr was beginning to feel the stress of the band's exhausting touring and recording schedule. He later told ''NME'', \"'Worse for wear' wasn't the half of it: I was extremely ill. By the time the tour actually finished it was all getting a little bit&nbsp;... dangerous.

The breakdown in the relationship has been primarily attributed to Morrissey's irritation by Marr's work with other artists and Marr growing frustrated by Morrissey's musical inflexibility.

Morrissey's lyrics, while superficially depressing, were often full of mordant humour; John Peel remarked that the Smiths were one of the few bands capable of making him laugh out loud. Influenced by his childhood interest in the [[social realism]] of 1960s [[kitchen sink realism|\"kitchen sink\"]] television plays, Morrissey wrote about ordinary people and their experiences with despair, rejection and death. While \"songs such as 'Still Ill' sealed his role as spokesman for disaffected youth\", Morrissey's \"manic-depressive rants\" and his \"'woe-is-me' posture inspired some hostile critics to dismiss the Smiths as 'miserabilists.'\"<ref name=\"Ref-1\"/>\n\n==Visual imagery==\nThe group's cover artwork had a distinctive visual style and often featured images of film and pop stars, usually in [[duotone]]. Design was by Morrissey and Rough Trade art coordinator Jo Slee. The covers of singles rarely featured any text other than the band name, and the band itself did not appear on the cover of any UK release. (Morrissey did, however, appear on an alternative cover for \"What Difference Does It Make?\", mimicking the pose of the original subject, British actor [[Terence Stamp]], after the latter objected to his picture being used.) The choice of cover subjects reflected Morrissey's interest in cult film stars (Stamp, [[Alain Delon]], [[Jean Marais]], [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]] prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Joe Dallesandro]], [[James Dean]]); figures from sixties British popular culture ([[Viv Nicholson]], [[Pat Phoenix]], [[Yootha Joyce]], [[Shelagh Delaney]]); and anonymous images from old films and magazines.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/under_the_covers/the-smiths.htm\n| title = The Smiths.

The group consisted of vocalist [[Morrissey]], guitarist [[Johnny Marr]], bassist [[Andy Rourke]], and drummer [[Mike Joyce (musician)|Mike Joyce]]. Critics have called them one of the most important bands to emerge from the British [[independent music]] scene of the 1980s. In 2012, all of their studio albums and one of their compilation albums appeared on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].\n\nBased on the songwriting partnership of Morrissey and Marr, the Smiths' focus on a guitar, bass, and drum sound, and their fusion of 1960s rock and [[post-punk]], were a rejection of the [[synthesiser]]-based [[dance-pop]] of the time. Marr's [[Rickenbacker]] guitar work had a [[jangle pop]] sound reminiscent of [[Roger McGuinn]] of [[the Byrds]].<ref name=\"Marr_Byrds\">{{cite web|last=Rosen|first=Steven|title=Johnny Marr on Fender Signature Guitar: 'It Was Such A Privilege'|work=UltimateGuitar.com (interview)|accessdate=5 May 2014|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506000635/http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/johnny_marr_on_fender_signature_guitar_it_was_such_a_privilege.html}}</ref> Morrissey's complex, literate lyrics combined themes about ordinary people with mordant humour.\n\nThe Smiths signed to the independent record label [[Rough Trade Records]].

Morrissey provided the lyrics for \"Don't Blow Your Own Horn\", the first song that they worked on; however, they decided against retaining the song, with Marr commenting that \"neither of us liked it very much\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=17}} The next song that they worked on was \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\", which again was based on lyrics produced by Morrissey. Marr included a tempo which was based on the [[Patti Smith]] song \"Kimberly\", and they recorded it on Marr's TEAC three-track cassette recorder. The third track that the duo worked on was \"[[Suffer Little Children]]\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=18}} Alongside these original compositions, Morrissey suggested that the band produce a cover of \"I Want a Boy for My Birthday\", a song by the 1960s American girl band [[the Cookies]]; although he had never heard of the song before, Marr agreed, enjoying the subversive element of having a male vocalist sing it, and the song was recorded on his TEAC machine.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=22}}\n\nBy the end of the summer of 1982 Morrissey had chosen the band name \"the Smiths\",{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=34|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2p=20}} later informing an interviewer that \"it was the most ordinary name and I thought it was time that the ordinary folk of the world showed their faces\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=20}} Around the time of the band's formation, Morrissey decided that he would be publicly known only by his surname,{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=34|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2p=42}} with Marr referring to him as \"Mozzer\" or \"Moz\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=21}} In 1983 he forbade those around him from using the name \"Steven\", which he despised.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=21}}\n\nAfter remaining with the band for several rehearsals, Pomfret departed acrimoniously.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=19}} He was replaced by the bass player Dale Hibbert, who worked at Manchester's Decibel Studios, where Marr had met him while recording Freak Party's demo.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=20}} It was through Hibbert that the Smiths were able to record their first demo at Decibel, doing so one night in August 1982.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=23}} Aided by drummer [[Simon Wolstencroft]], whom Marr had worked with in Freak Party, the band recorded both \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\" and \"Suffer Little Children\".{{sfn|Goddard|2003|pp=23\u201324}} Wolstencroft was not interested in joining the band, so auditions were held to find a permanent drummer, which resulted in [[Mike Joyce (musician)|Mike Joyce]] joining them; he later revealed that he was under the influence of [[magic mushrooms]] during his audition performance.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=25\u201326}} Meanwhile, Morrissey took the demo recording to [[Factory Records]], but Factory's [[Tony Wilson]] wasn't interested.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=26\u201327}}\n\nIn October 1982 the Smiths gave their first public performance as a support act for [[Blue Rondo \u00e0 la Turk (band)|Blue Rondo \u00e0 la Turk]] during a student music and fashion show, \"An Evening of Pure Pleasure\", at Manchester's [[The Ritz (Manchester)|The Ritz]] venue.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1pp=34, 35|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2p=27}} During the performance, they played both their own compositions and \"I Want a Boy for My Birthday\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=28}} Morrissey had organised the gig's aesthetic; the band came onstage to [[Klaus Nomi]]'s version of [[Henry Purcell]]'s \"The Cold Song\" playing through the venue's sound system before his friend James Maker stepped onstage to introduce the band.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=27\u201329}} Maker remained onstage during the performance, relating that \"I was given a pair of maracas \u2013 an optional extra \u2013 and carte blanche.

Present at the gig was [[John Walters (broadcaster)|John Walters]], the producer of [[John Peel]]'s [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] show; interested, he invited the band to record a session for the program. Peel expressed the view that \"I was impressed because unlike most bands... you couldn't immediately tell what records they'd been listening to. That's fairly unusual, very rare indeed... It was that aspect of the Smiths that I found most impressive.\"{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=43}} Following this radio exposure, the band gained their first interviews, in music magazines ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=43}}\n\nThe Smiths then agreed to sign a record contract with Rough Trade, with Travis travelling up to Manchester to meet the band at their Crazy Face rehearsal space; there they signed the contract.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=46\u201347}} Only Morrissey and Marr signed it on behalf of the band, and there was no discussion at the time regarding how the band's earnings would be divided up, something that would lead to the eventual argument over royalties which resulted in the 1996 High Court case.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=47}} To produce the band's first album, Travis brought in [[Troy Tate]] of [[the Teardrop Explodes]], and under Tate's supervision the band recorded their first album, provisionally titled ''The Hand That Rocks the Cradle'', at the Elephant Studios in [[Wapping]], [[East London]].{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=47\u201350}} Rough Trade were unhappy with the album that the band produced and Troy's production of it, ordering the band to redo it with a new producer, [[John Porter (musician)|John Porter]].{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=50\u201351}}\n\nThe band soon generated controversy when [[Gary Bushell]] of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' tabloid alleged that their B-side \"Handsome Devil\" was an endorsement of [[paedophilia]].{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=2004|1p=108|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2pp=35\u201336}} The band denied this, with Morrissey stating that the song \"has nothing to do with children, and certainly nothing to do with child molesting\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=37}}\n\nThe follow-up singles \"[[This Charming Man]]\" and \"[[What Difference Does It Make?]]\" fared better when they reached numbers 25 and 12 respectively on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"guinness book\">{{Cite book|last=Roberts|first=David (ed.)|title=British Hit Singles & Albums|publisher=[[HIT Entertainment]]|year=2006|edition=19th|pages=509\u2013510|isbn=1-904994-10-5|title-link=Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums}}</ref> Aided by praise from the music press and a series of studio sessions for Peel and [[David Jensen]] at [[BBC Radio 1]], the Smiths began to acquire a dedicated fan base.\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=\"The Smiths brought realism to their romance, and tempered their angst with the lightest of touches.

This album was more strident and political than its predecessor, including the pro-vegetarian title track (Morrissey forbade the rest of the group from being photographed eating meat), the light-hearted republicanism of \"Nowhere Fast\", and the anti-[[corporal punishment]] \"The Headmaster Ritual\" and \"Barbarism Begins at Home\". The band had also grown more diverse musically, with Marr adding rockabilly riffs to \"Rusholme Ruffians\" and Rourke playing a funk bass solo on \"Barbarism Begins at Home\". The album was preceded by the re-release of the B-side \"[[How Soon Is Now?]]\" as a single, and although that song was not on the original [[Phonograph record|LP]], it has been added to subsequent releases. ''Meat Is Murder'' was the band's only album (barring compilations) to reach number one in the UK charts.<ref name=album/> In 2003, the album was ranked number 295 on ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 500 albums of all time|url=http://www.archer2000.net/sbs/awardsrs500.html|accessdate=26 April 2013|publisher=Rolling Stone LLC/Archer & Valerie Productions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102200719/http://www.archer2000.net/sbs/awardsrs500.html|archive-date=2 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMorrissey brought a political stance to many of his interviews, courting further controversy. Among his targets were the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]], the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarchy]], and the famine relief project [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]].

A legal dispute with Rough Trade had delayed the album by almost seven months (it had been completed in November 1985), and Marr was beginning to feel the stress of the band's exhausting touring and recording schedule.

The breakdown in the relationship has been primarily attributed to Morrissey's irritation by Marr's work with other artists and Marr growing frustrated by Morrissey's musical inflexibility. Marr particularly hated Morrissey's obsession with covering 1960s pop artists such as [[Twinkle (singer)|Twinkle]] and [[Cilla Black]]. Marr recalled in 1992, \"That was the last straw, really.

Electronic released three albums over the next decade. Marr was also a member of [[The The]], recording two albums with the group between 1989 and 1993.

Morrissey's lyrics, while superficially depressing, were often full of mordant humour; John Peel remarked that the Smiths were one of the few bands capable of making him laugh out loud. Influenced by his childhood interest in the [[social realism]] of 1960s [[kitchen sink realism|\"kitchen sink\"]] television plays, Morrissey wrote about ordinary people and their experiences with despair, rejection and death. While \"songs such as 'Still Ill' sealed his role as spokesman for disaffected youth\", Morrissey's \"manic-depressive rants\" and his \"'woe-is-me' posture inspired some hostile critics to dismiss the Smiths as 'miserabilists.'\"<ref name=\"Ref-1\"/>\n\n==Visual imagery==\nThe group's cover artwork had a distinctive visual style and often featured images of film and pop stars, usually in [[duotone]]. Design was by Morrissey and Rough Trade art coordinator Jo Slee.

(Morrissey did, however, appear on an alternative cover for \"What Difference Does It Make?\", mimicking the pose of the original subject, British actor [[Terence Stamp]], after the latter objected to his picture being used.) The choice of cover subjects reflected Morrissey's interest in cult film stars (Stamp, [[Alain Delon]], [[Jean Marais]], [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]] prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Joe Dallesandro]], [[James Dean]]); figures from sixties British popular culture ([[Viv Nicholson]], [[Pat Phoenix]], [[Yootha Joyce]], [[Shelagh Delaney]]); and anonymous images from old films and magazines.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/under_the_covers/the-smiths.htm\n| title = The Smiths.

The station is owned by the [[Fox Television Stations]] subsidiary of [[Fox Corporation]], as part of a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] with Tacoma-licensed [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] station [[KCPQ]] (channel 13). The two stations share studios on Westlake Avenue in Seattle's [[Westlake, Seattle|Westlake]] neighborhood; KZJO's transmitter is located near the [[Capitol Hill (Seattle)|Capitol Hill]] section of Seattle. There is no separate website for KZJO; instead, it is integrated with that of sister station KCPQ.\n\nThe station operates two UHF [[Broadcast relay station#Translator stations|translators]], and KZJO rebroadcasts KCPQ's programming on its second [[digital subchannel]] in [[widescreen]] [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] to provide that station to areas in the eastern portion of the Seattle market that receive weak signal coverage from KCPQ's [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]] transmitter.\n\n==History==\nThe station began broadcasting as '''KTZZ-TV''' on June 22, 1985, owned by Alden Television, Inc. The call letters stood for '''T'''elevision '''22''', the '''Z'''s closely resembling numeral '''2'''s. At the time the station signed on, it was the first new TV station to sign on in the Seattle area since [[KIRO-TV]] went on the air in 1958, and there was a hole in the Seattle market for [[animated cartoon|cartoons]] and [[sitcom]]s. While [[KSTW]] (channel 11) was running such programming, KCPQ counter-programmed with more adult fare like [[drama (film and television)|dramas]], [[game show]]s, and [[feature film|movies]]. As such, KTZZ signed on with a lineup of classic off-network sitcoms, [[Western (genre)|westerns]], cartoons, movies, and dramas. Originally, to keep people from changing channels, the station broadcast only its [[station identification]]\u2014no commercials\u2014between the [[closing credits]] of one show and the opening credits of the next show. One [[Christmas]] season, as snow fell in the [[Puget Sound]] area, viewers were treated to a gag in which someone pretending to be a [[janitor]] ([[Vern Fonk|Rob Thielke]]) takes control of the station for a few moments to deliver \"the news\" which was mostly a fake weather forecast which began \"The weather outside is frightful. But inside it's quite delightful. As long as I've got no place to go, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.\"\n\nKTZZ began with a very promising start, airing fairly strong syndicated shows, and was initially profitable under Alden ownership. However, in 1989, the station was sold to Dudley Broadcasting. By that time, KCPQ and KSTW had strong lineups, including much of the children's programming available, but KTZZ was losing ground and unable to acquire strong off-network syndicated shows. With KCPQ now in the kids business, the best cartoons were now airing on KSTW and KCPQ, leaving KTZZ with leftovers (which still was about five hours worth of cartoons a day). KTZZ was also the home, for several years, of the eclectic Seattle [[talk show]] ''[[The Spud Goodman Show]]''. Producing the weekly interview/music/feature show was an ambitious undertaking for a small station, and the program relied heavily on a large staff of volunteers. The programming costs became too high for KTZZ. As a result, KTZZ began airing [[CBS]] shows preempted by [[KIRO-TV]] (channel 7), along with paid programming and brokered shows. It still ran some conventional syndicated products, but they were essentially programs that no other stations in the market wanted.\n\nOn January 11, 1995, KTZZ affiliated with the newly-formed [[The WB|Warner Brothers television network]].<ref name=tst-ktzzwb>{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Chuck|title=KTZZ To Join New WB Television Network|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950104&slug=2097765|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=January 4, 1995}}</ref> The WB had initially signed KSTW in 1993 as its Seattle affiliate;<ref name=tst-kstwwb>{{cite news|title=KSTW-TV Will Join New WB Network|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19931104&slug=1729799|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=November 4, 1993}}</ref> however, that station's owner, [[Ryman Hospitality Properties|Gaylord Broadcasting]], backed out of the deal a year later to affiliate with CBS, only to become a UPN station in 1997.<ref name=tst-kstwnowb>{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Chuck|title=CBS Dropping KIRO-TV, May Pick Up KSTW \u2013 Industrywide Shake-Up Finally Hits Seattle Area|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19940913&slug=1930463|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=September 13, 1994}}</ref> KTZZ picked up syndicated cartoons formerly on KSTW in 1995, added more off-network sitcoms and moved away from the [[brokered programming|brokered show]] format. As it began airing programming from The WB, KTZZ was helped in part by the fact that KCPQ was moving towards news and more first-run syndicated talk, [[court show|courtroom]], and drama shows.\n\nDudley Communications sold KTZZ, along with sister station [[WXMI]] in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], to [[Emmis Communications]] in 1998; the two stations were then promptly dealt to [[Tribune Broadcasting]] in exchange for [[WFAN-FM|WQCD]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=psbj-saletotribune>{{cite news|last=Kim|first=Nancy J|title=Nordstrom eyes first national brand campaign|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/1998/01/12/newscolumn1.html?page=all|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=[[Puget Sound Business Journal]]|date=January 11, 1998}}</ref> Tribune changed the station's call letters to '''KTWB-TV''' ('''T'''he '''W'''arner '''B'''rothers Network) on April 26, 1999. After Tribune acquired KCPQ in early 1999, KTWB's license was transferred to a trustee in the short-term until the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]'s approval of television [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopolies]] later that year, though Tribune managed and operated the station during this period via a [[local marketing agreement]]. In 2004, KTWB revised its on-air brand from ''WB 22'' to ''Seattle's WB'' as part of a groupwide branding effort.\n\n===MyNetworkTV affiliation===\n[[File:KMYQ-TV.png|thumb|left|Logo as \"myQ\u00b2\", used from 2006 to 2010.]]\nOn January 24, 2006, [[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]] announced that the company would merge the operations of The WB with [[CBS Corporation]]'s [[UPN]] (which CBS acquired one month earlier in December 2005 following its [[Viacom (original)#2005 split|split]] from [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]), to form a joint venture called [[The CW|The CW Television Network]].<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/24/news/companies/cbs_warner/ 'Gilmore Girls' meet 'Smackdown'; CW Network to combine WB, UPN in CBS-Warner venture beginning in September], [[CNNMoney.com]], January 24, 2006.</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/business/media/24cnd-network.html?bl UPN and WB to Combine, Forming New TV Network], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 24, 2006.</ref> The network signed a ten-year affiliation agreement with Tribune Broadcasting for 13 of the 16 WB affiliates that the company owned at the time.<ref>[http://corporate.tribune.com/pressroom/?p=574 Tribune TV Stations to Lead Affiliate Group of New Network] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20121216131255/http://corporate.tribune.com/pressroom/?p=574 |date=December 16, 2012 }}, Tribune Company corporate website, January 24, 2006.</ref> KTWB was one of the three Tribune stations passed over for an affiliation as CBS-owned UPN affiliate KSTW (which was included in 11 of 14 CBS-owned UPN affiliates) was chosen as The CW's Seattle-Tacoma charter station.

On March 31, 2008, KMYQ became just the second MyNetworkTV affiliate in the [[Pacific Time Zone]] to utilize an early primetime schedule from 7\u20139 p.m. (the first was [[KQCA]]/[[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], which has since moved MyNetworkTV programming back to its recommended 8\u201310 p.m. timeslot). By 2009, MyNetworkTV converted from a full-fledged network to a programming service.\n\nOn September 13, 2010, the station moved its MyNetworkTV programming to 11&nbsp;pm.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150926105337/http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tvlistings/ZCSGrid.do?stnNum=10769&channel=10]</ref> KMYQ changed its call letters to '''KZJO''' and as part of a company-wide branding effort to play down network affiliations, unconventionally rebranded as ''JOEtv'' that same day, casting the station in its branding as a neighborhood [[dive bar]] carrying 'blue collar' programming (including its website being called \"Joe's Wall\" and being designed to look like a 'bar bathroom', with appropriate [[graffiti]] on virtual stalls advertising the station's offerings). Currently the branding remains, though outside the logo, it is now promoted more traditionally, after the last of the [[Sam Zell]] ownership group which forced the unconventional rebrandings was removed from Tribune Media. On September 19, 2011, the station moved MyNetworkTV programming yet again, this time, back one hour to 12 a.m. As of 2020, it airs even later, from 1 a.m. to 3 a.m. and is rarely promoted on air, if at all, to the point that the station's website does not mention the affiliation (for several years, the site's 'about us' copy erroneously said it ended the affiliation in 2011).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201185329/http://q13fox.com/joetv/|title=Archive of KZJO's website|date=1 February 2016|accessdate=18 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Aborted sale to Sinclair Broadcast Group===\nOn May 8, 2017, [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]\u2014which has owned [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[KOMO-TV]] (channel 4) and [[Univision]] affiliate [[KUNS-TV]] (channel 51) since its 2013 merger with Seattle-based [[Fisher Communications]]\u2014entered into an agreement to acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in debt held by Tribune.

The station is owned by the [[Fox Television Stations]] subsidiary of [[Fox Corporation]], as part of a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] with Tacoma-licensed [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] station [[KCPQ]] (channel 13). The two stations share studios on Westlake Avenue in Seattle's [[Westlake, Seattle|Westlake]] neighborhood; KZJO's transmitter is located near the [[Capitol Hill (Seattle)|Capitol Hill]] section of Seattle. There is no separate website for KZJO; instead, it is integrated with that of sister station KCPQ.\n\nThe station operates two UHF [[Broadcast relay station#Translator stations|translators]], and KZJO rebroadcasts KCPQ's programming on its second [[digital subchannel]] in [[widescreen]] [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] to provide that station to areas in the eastern portion of the Seattle market that receive weak signal coverage from KCPQ's [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]] transmitter.\n\n==History==\nThe station began broadcasting as '''KTZZ-TV''' on June 22, 1985, owned by Alden Television, Inc. The call letters stood for '''T'''elevision '''22''', the '''Z'''s closely resembling numeral '''2'''s. At the time the station signed on, it was the first new TV station to sign on in the Seattle area since [[KIRO-TV]] went on the air in 1958, and there was a hole in the Seattle market for [[animated cartoon|cartoons]] and [[sitcom]]s. While [[KSTW]] (channel 11) was running such programming, KCPQ counter-programmed with more adult fare like [[drama (film and television)|dramas]], [[game show]]s, and [[feature film|movies]]. As such, KTZZ signed on with a lineup of classic off-network sitcoms, [[Western (genre)|westerns]], cartoons, movies, and dramas. Originally, to keep people from changing channels, the station broadcast only its [[station identification]]\u2014no commercials\u2014between the [[closing credits]] of one show and the opening credits of the next show. One [[Christmas]] season, as snow fell in the [[Puget Sound]] area, viewers were treated to a gag in which someone pretending to be a [[janitor]] ([[Vern Fonk|Rob Thielke]]) takes control of the station for a few moments to deliver \"the news\" which was mostly a fake weather forecast which began \"The weather outside is frightful. But inside it's quite delightful. As long as I've got no place to go, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.\"\n\nKTZZ began with a very promising start, airing fairly strong syndicated shows, and was initially profitable under Alden ownership. However, in 1989, the station was sold to Dudley Broadcasting. By that time, KCPQ and KSTW had strong lineups, including much of the children's programming available, but KTZZ was losing ground and unable to acquire strong off-network syndicated shows. With KCPQ now in the kids business, the best cartoons were now airing on KSTW and KCPQ, leaving KTZZ with leftovers (which still was about five hours worth of cartoons a day). KTZZ was also the home, for several years, of the eclectic Seattle [[talk show]] ''[[The Spud Goodman Show]]''. Producing the weekly interview/music/feature show was an ambitious undertaking for a small station, and the program relied heavily on a large staff of volunteers. The programming costs became too high for KTZZ. As a result, KTZZ began airing [[CBS]] shows preempted by [[KIRO-TV]] (channel 7), along with paid programming and brokered shows. It still ran some conventional syndicated products, but they were essentially programs that no other stations in the market wanted.\n\nOn January 11, 1995, KTZZ affiliated with the newly-formed [[The WB|Warner Brothers television network]].<ref name=tst-ktzzwb>{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Chuck|title=KTZZ To Join New WB Television Network|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950104&slug=2097765|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=January 4, 1995}}</ref> The WB had initially signed KSTW in 1993 as its Seattle affiliate;<ref name=tst-kstwwb>{{cite news|title=KSTW-TV Will Join New WB Network|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19931104&slug=1729799|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=November 4, 1993}}</ref> however, that station's owner, [[Ryman Hospitality Properties|Gaylord Broadcasting]], backed out of the deal a year later to affiliate with CBS, only to become a UPN station in 1997.<ref name=tst-kstwnowb>{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Chuck|title=CBS Dropping KIRO-TV, May Pick Up KSTW \u2013 Industrywide Shake-Up Finally Hits Seattle Area|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19940913&slug=1930463|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=September 13, 1994}}</ref> KTZZ picked up syndicated cartoons formerly on KSTW in 1995, added more off-network sitcoms and moved away from the [[brokered programming|brokered show]] format. As it began airing programming from The WB, KTZZ was helped in part by the fact that KCPQ was moving towards news and more first-run syndicated talk, [[court show|courtroom]], and drama shows.\n\nDudley Communications sold KTZZ, along with sister station [[WXMI]] in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], to [[Emmis Communications]] in 1998; the two stations were then promptly dealt to [[Tribune Broadcasting]] in exchange for [[WFAN-FM|WQCD]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=psbj-saletotribune>{{cite news|last=Kim|first=Nancy J|title=Nordstrom eyes first national brand campaign|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/1998/01/12/newscolumn1.html?page=all|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=[[Puget Sound Business Journal]]|date=January 11, 1998}}</ref> Tribune changed the station's call letters to '''KTWB-TV''' ('''T'''he '''W'''arner '''B'''rothers Network) on April 26, 1999.

On March 31, 2008, KMYQ became just the second MyNetworkTV affiliate in the [[Pacific Time Zone]] to utilize an early primetime schedule from 7\u20139 p.m. (the first was [[KQCA]]/[[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], which has since moved MyNetworkTV programming back to its recommended 8\u201310 p.m. timeslot).

On September 19, 2011, the station moved MyNetworkTV programming yet again, this time, back one hour to 12 a.m. As of the 2015-16 season it airs even later, from 1 a.m. to 3 a.m. and is rarely promoted on air, if at all, to the point that the station's website does not mention the affiliation (for several years, the site's 'about us' copy erroneously said it ended the affiliation in 2011).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201185329/http://q13fox.com/joetv/|title=Archive of KZJO's website|date=1 February 2016|accessdate=18 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Aborted sale to Sinclair Broadcast Group===\nOn May 8, 2017, [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]\u2014which has owned [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[KOMO-TV]] (channel 4) and [[Univision]] affiliate [[KUNS-TV]] (channel 51) since its 2013 merger with Seattle-based [[Fisher Communications]]\u2014entered into an agreement to acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in debt held by Tribune.
