The ability to look at an item and remember what it looked like with just a split second of observation, or memorization, is the example of sensory memory. It is out of cognitive control and is an automatic response. With very short presentations, participants often report that they seem to \"see\" more than they can actually report. The first experiments exploring this form of sensory memory were precisely conducted by [[George Sperling]] (1963)<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/001872086300500103|pmid = 13990068|title = A Model for Visual Memory Tasks|journal = Human Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society|volume = 5|pages = 19\u201331|year = 1963|last1 = Sperling|first1 = George}}</ref>  using the \"partial report paradigm\".  Subjects were presented with a grid of 12 letters, arranged into three rows of four. After a brief presentation, subjects were then played either a high, medium or low tone, cuing them which of the rows to report. Based on these partial report experiments, Sperling was able to show that the capacity of sensory memory was approximately 12 items, but that it degraded very quickly (within a few hundred milliseconds). Because this form of memory degrades so quickly, participants would see the display but be unable to report all of the items (12 in the \"whole report\" procedure) before they decayed. This type of memory cannot be prolonged via rehearsal.\n\nThree types of sensory memories exist. [[Iconic memory]] is a fast decaying store of visual information; a type of sensory memory that briefly stores an image which has been perceived for a small duration. [[Echoic memory]] is a fast decaying store of auditory information, another type of sensory memory that briefly stores sounds that have been perceived for short durations.<ref name=\"Carlson 2010\">{{cite book |author=Carlson, Neil R. |title=Psychology: the science of behavior |publisher=Allyn & Bacon |location=Boston, Mass |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=978-0-205-68557-8 |oclc=268547522}}</ref> [[Haptic memory]] is a type of sensory memory that represents a database for touch stimuli.\n\n==Short-term memory==\n{{Main|Short-term memory}}\nShort-term memory is also known as '''working memory'''. Short-term memory allows recall for a period of several seconds to a minute without rehearsal. Its capacity is also very limited: In 1956, [[George Armitage Miller|George A. Miller]] (b. 1920), when working at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]], conducted experiments showing that the store of short-term memory was 7\u00b12 items (the title of his famous paper, \"[[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|The magical number 7\u00b12]]\").

This method of remembering telephone numbers is far more effective than attempting to remember a string of 10 digits; this is because we are able to chunk the information into meaningful groups of numbers.  This may be reflected in some countries in the tendency to display telephone numbers as several chunks of two to four numbers.\n\nShort-term memory is believed to rely mostly on an acoustic code for storing information, and to a lesser extent a visual code.

Confusion with recalling acoustically similar letters rather than visually similar letters implies that the letters were encoded acoustically.

Library of Congress [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington, D.C.]]\nThe storage in sensory memory and short-term memory generally has a strictly limited capacity and duration, which means that information is not retained indefinitely. By contrast, long-term memory can store much larger quantities of information for potentially unlimited duration (sometimes a whole life span). Its capacity is immeasurable. For example, given a random seven-digit number, one may remember it for only a few seconds before forgetting, suggesting it was stored in short-term memory. On the other hand, one can remember telephone numbers for many years through repetition; this information is said to be stored in long-term memory.\n\nWhile short-term memory encodes information acoustically, long-term memory encodes it semantically: Baddeley (1966)<ref name=\"Baddeley 1966\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/14640746608400047 | author = Baddeley, A.D. | year = 1966 | title = The influence of acoustic and semantic similarity on long-term memory for word sequences | url = | journal = Q.

Atkinson|Atkinson]] and [[Richard Shiffrin|Shiffrin]].\n\nThe multi-store model has been criticised for being too simplistic. For instance, long-term memory is believed to be actually made up of multiple subcomponents, such as episodic and [[procedural memory]]. It also proposes that rehearsal is the only mechanism by which information eventually reaches long-term storage, but evidence shows us capable of remembering things without rehearsal.\n\nThe model also shows all the memory stores as being a single unit whereas research into this shows differently. For example, short-term memory can be broken up into different units such as visual information and acoustic information. In a study by Zlonoga and Gerber (1986), patient 'KF' demonstrated certain deviations from the Atkinson\u2013Shiffrin model. Patient KF was [[brain damage]]d, displaying difficulties regarding short-term memory. Recognition of sounds such as spoken numbers, letters, words and easily identifiable noises (such as doorbells and cats meowing) were all impacted. Visual short-term memory was unaffected, suggesting a dichotomy between visual and audial memory.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=3952419 | volume=75 | issue=7 | title=A case from practice (49).

In this model, working memory consists of three basic stores: the central executive, the phonological loop and the visuo-spatial sketchpad. In 2000 this model was expanded with the multimodal episodic buffer ([[Baddeley's model of working memory]]).<ref name=\"Baddeley 2000\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01538-2 | author = Baddeley, A.D. | year = 2000 | title = The episodic buffer: a new component of working memory? | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 11| pages = 417\u201323 | pmid=11058819}}</ref>\n\nThe central executive essentially acts as an attention sensory store. It channels information to the three component processes: the phonological loop, the visuo-spatial sketchpad, and the episodic buffer.\n\nThe phonological loop stores auditory information by silently rehearsing sounds or words in a continuous loop: the articulatory process (for example the repetition of a telephone number over and over again). A short list of data is easier to remember.\n\nThe [[visuospatial sketchpad]] stores visual and spatial information. It is engaged when performing spatial tasks (such as judging distances) or visual ones (such as counting the windows on a house or imagining images).\n\nThe episodic buffer is dedicated to linking information across domains to form integrated units of visual, spatial, and verbal information and chronological ordering (e.g., the memory of a story or a movie scene). The episodic buffer is also assumed to have links to long-term memory and semantical meaning.\n\nThe working memory model explains many practical observations, such as why it is easier to do two different tasks (one verbal and one visual) than two similar tasks (e.g., two visual), and the aforementioned word-length effect.  Working memory is also the premise for what allows us to do everyday activities involving thought. It is the section of memory where we carry out thought processes and use them to learn and reason about topics.<ref name=\"Baddeley 2000\"/>\n\n==Types==\nResearchers distinguish between '''recognition''' and '''recall''' memory.  Recognition memory tasks require individuals to indicate whether they have encountered a stimulus (such as a picture or a word) before.  Recall memory tasks require participants to retrieve previously learned information.  For example, individuals might be asked  to produce a series of actions they have seen before or to say a list of words they have heard before.\n\n===By information type===\n'''Topographic memory''' involves the ability to orient oneself in space, to recognize and follow an itinerary, or to recognize familiar places.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.med.univ-rennes1.fr/iidris/cache/an/40/4003 |title=IIDRSI: topographic memory loss |publisher=Med.univ-rennes1.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430232457/http://www.med.univ-rennes1.fr/iidris/cache/an/40/4003 |archivedate=2013-04-30 }}</ref> Getting lost when traveling alone is an example of the failure of topographic memory.<ref name=\"Aguirre 1999\">{{cite journal |author1=Aguirre, G.K. |author2=D'Esposito, M. |title=Topographical disorientation: a synthesis and taxonomy |journal=Brain |volume=122 |issue= 9|pages=1613\u201328 |date=September 1999|pmid=10468502 |doi= 10.1093/brain/122.9.1613 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n'''Flashbulb memories''' are clear [[episodic memories]] of unique and highly emotional events.<ref>T.L.

It is sometimes called ''[[explicit memory]]'', since it consists of information that is explicitly stored and retrieved.\n\nDeclarative memory can be further sub-divided into [[semantic memory]], concerning principles and facts taken independent of context; and [[episodic memory]], concerning information specific to a particular context, such as a time and place. Semantic memory allows the encoding of abstract [[knowledge]] about the world, such as \"Paris is the capital of France\". Episodic memory, on the other hand, is used for more personal memories, such as the sensations, emotions, and personal associations of a particular place or time. Episodic memories often reflect the \"firsts\" in life such as a first kiss, first day of school or first time winning a championship. These are key events in one's life that can be remembered clearly.  [[Autobiographical memory]] \u2013 memory for particular events within one's own life \u2013 is generally viewed as either equivalent to, or a subset of, episodic memory. [[Visual memory]] is part of memory preserving some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience. One is able to place in memory information that resembles objects, places, animals or people in sort of a [[mental image]]. Visual memory can result in [[priming (psychology)|priming]] and it is assumed some kind of perceptual representational system underlies this phenomenon.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n==== Procedural ====\nIn contrast, [[procedural memory]] (or ''[[implicit memory]]'') is not based on the conscious recall of information, but on [[implicit learning]]. It can best be summarized as remembering how to do something. Procedural memory is primarily employed in learning [[motor skill]]s and should be considered a subset of implicit memory. It is revealed when one does better in a given task due only to repetition \u2013 no new explicit memories have been formed, but one is [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]] accessing aspects of those previous experiences. Procedural memory involved in [[motor learning]] depends on the [[cerebellum]] and [[basal ganglia]].\n\nA characteristic of procedural memory is that the things remembered are automatically translated into actions, and thus sometimes difficult to describe. Some examples of procedural memory include the ability to ride a bike or tie shoelaces.<ref name=\"Schacter 2011\">{{cite book |author1=Schacter, Daniel L |author2=Gilbert, Daniel T |author3=Wegner, Daniel M |title= Implicit Memory and Explicit Memory |work=Psychology |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=New York |year=2010 |pages=238 |isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2 |oclc=755079969 }}</ref>\n\n===By temporal direction===\nAnother major way to distinguish different memory functions is whether the content to be remembered is in the past, [[retrospective memory]], or in the future, [[prospective memory]]. Thus, retrospective memory as a category includes semantic, episodic  and autobiographical memory. In contrast, prospective memory is memory for future intentions, or ''remembering to remember'' (Winograd, 1988). Prospective memory can be further broken down into event- and time-based prospective remembering. Time-based prospective memories are triggered by a time-cue, such as going to the doctor (action) at 4pm (cue). Event-based prospective memories are intentions triggered by cues, such as remembering to post a letter (action) after seeing a mailbox (cue). Cues do not need to be related to the action (as the mailbox/letter example), and lists, sticky-notes, knotted handkerchiefs, or string around the finger all exemplify cues that people use as strategies to enhance prospective memory.\n\n==Study techniques==\n===To assess infants===\n\nInfants do not have the language ability to report on their memories and so verbal reports cannot be used to assess very young children's memory.  Throughout the years, however, researchers have adapted and developed a number of measures for assessing both infants' recognition memory and their recall memory.  [[Habituation]] and [[operant conditioning]] techniques have been used to assess infants' recognition memory and the deferred and elicited imitation techniques have been used to assess infants' recall memory.\n\nTechniques used to assess infants' recognition memory include the following:\n* '''Visual paired comparison procedure (relies on habituation)''': infants are first presented with pairs of visual stimuli, such as two black-and-white photos of human faces, for a fixed amount of time; then, after being familiarized with the two photos, they are presented with the \"familiar\" photo and a new photo.  The time spent looking at each photo is recorded.  Looking longer at the new photo indicates that they remember the \"familiar\" one.  Studies using this procedure have found that 5- to 6-month-olds can retain information for as long as fourteen days.<ref name=\"Fagan 1974\">{{cite journal |author=Fagan, J.F. |title=Infant recognition memory: the effects of length of familiarization and type of discrimination task |journal=Child Dev |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=351\u2013356 |date=June 1974 |pmid=4837713 |jstor=1127955 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1974.tb00603.x }}</ref>\n* '''Operant conditioning technique''': infants are placed in a crib and a ribbon that is connected to a mobile overhead is tied to one of their feet.  Infants notice that when they kick their foot the mobile moves \u2013 the rate of kicking increases dramatically within minutes.  Studies using this technique have revealed that infants' memory substantially improves over the first 18-months.  Whereas 2- to 3-month-olds can retain an operant response (such as activating the mobile by kicking their foot) for a week, 6-month-olds can retain it for two weeks, and 18-month-olds can retain a similar operant response for as long as 13 weeks.<ref name=\"Rovee-Collier 1999\">{{cite journal|last1=Rovee-Collier|first1=Carolyn|title=The Development of Infant Memory|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=8| issue=3|year=1999| pages=80\u201385| issn=0963-7214|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00019 |url=http://bernard.pitzer.edu/~dmoore/psych199s03articles/R-Collier_memory.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"Rovee-Collier 1993\">{{cite book |author=Rovee-Collier, C.K., Bhatt, R.S. | title=Evidence of long-term retention in infancy |work=Annals of Child Development |editor= Ross Vasta |publisher=Jessica Kingsley Pub |location=London |volume=9 |year=1993 |pages=1\u201345 |isbn=978-1-85302-219-7 |oclc=827689578}}</ref><ref name=\"Hartshorn 1998\">{{cite journal |author1=Hartshorn, K. |author2=Rovee-Collier, C. |author3=Gerhardstein, P. |title=The ontogeny of long-term memory over the first year-and-a-half of life |journal=Dev Psychobiol |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201389 |date=March 1998 |pmid=9526683 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2302(199803)32:2<69::AID-DEV1>3.0.CO;2-Q |url=|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nTechniques used to assess infants' recall memory include the following:\n* '''Deferred imitation technique''': an experimenter shows infants a unique sequence of actions (such as using a stick to push a button on a box) and then, after a delay, asks the infants to imitate the actions.

For example, the hippocampus is believed to be involved in spatial learning and [[declarative learning]], while the amygdala is thought to be involved in [[Emotion and memory|emotional memory]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=LaBar K.S. |author2=Cabeza R. |title=Cognitive neuroscience of emotional memory |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=7 |pages=54\u201364 |year=2006 |doi=10.1038/nrn1825 |pmid=16371950 |issue=1}}</ref>\n\nDamage to certain areas in patients and animal models and subsequent memory deficits is a primary source of information. However, rather than implicating a specific area, it could be that damage to adjacent areas, or to a pathway ''traveling'' through the area is actually responsible for the observed deficit. Further, it is not sufficient to describe memory, and its counterpart, [[learning]], as solely dependent on specific brain regions. Learning and memory are usually attributed to changes in neuronal [[synapse]]s, thought to be mediated by [[long-term potentiation]] and [[long-term depression]]. However, this has been questioned on computational as well as neurophysiological grounds by the cognitive scientist [[C. Randy Gallistel|Charles R. Gallistel]] and others.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Memory and the computational brain: Why cognitive science will transform neuroscience|author1=Gallistel C.R. |author2=King A.P. |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4051-2288-7|location=Chichester, England|pages=|quote=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gallistel|first=C.R.|last2=Matzel|first2=Louis D.|date=2013-01-02|title=The Neuroscience of Learning: Beyond the Hebbian Synapse|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=64|issue=1|pages=169\u2013200|doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143807|pmid=22804775|issn=0066-4308|doi-access=|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fa35595f7a651ad3668e0231606ca6cad7a5b6a8}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Trettenbrein|first=P.C.|date=2016-01-01|title=The Demise of the Synapse As the Locus of Memory: A Looming Paradigm Shift?|journal=Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience|volume=10 | issue = 88 |pages=88|doi=10.3389/fnsys.2016.00088|pmid=27909400|pmc=5112247|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nIn general, the more emotionally charged an event or experience is, the better it is remembered; this phenomenon is known as the '''memory enhancement effect'''.

He postulated that any memory that stayed in short-term storage for a long enough time would be consolidated into a long-term memory. Later research showed this to be false. Research has shown that direct injections of [[cortisol]] or [[epinephrine]] help the storage of recent experiences. This is also true for stimulation of the amygdala. This proves that excitement enhances memory by the stimulation of hormones that affect the amygdala. Excessive or prolonged stress (with prolonged cortisol) may hurt memory storage. Patients with amygdalar damage are no more likely to remember emotionally charged words than nonemotionally charged ones. The hippocampus is important for explicit memory. The hippocampus is also important for memory consolidation. The hippocampus receives input from different parts of the cortex and sends its output out to different parts of the brain also. The input comes from secondary and tertiary sensory areas that have processed the information a lot already. Hippocampal damage may also cause [[memory loss]] and problems with memory storage.<ref>{{cite book| last =Kalat| first =J.W.| title =Biological psychology (7th ed.)| publisher = Wadsworth Publishing| year =2001   | location =Belmont, CA }}</ref> This memory loss includes retrograde amnesia which is the loss of memory for events that occurred shortly before the time of brain damage.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Cognitive neuroscience==\nCognitive neuroscientists consider memory as the retention, reactivation, and reconstruction of the experience-independent internal representation. The term of internal [[Mental representation|representation]] implies that such a definition of memory contains two components: the expression of memory at the behavioral or conscious level, and the underpinning physical neural changes (Dudai 2007). The latter component is also called [[engram (neuropsychology)|engram]] or memory traces (Semon 1904). Some neuroscientists and psychologists mistakenly equate the concept of engram and memory, broadly conceiving all persisting after-effects of experiences as memory; others argue against this notion that memory does not exist until it is revealed in behavior or thought (Moscovitch 2007).\n\nOne question that is crucial in cognitive neuroscience is how information and mental experiences are coded and represented in the brain. Scientists have gained much knowledge about the neuronal codes from the studies of plasticity, but most of such research has been focused on simple learning in simple neuronal circuits; it is considerably less clear about the neuronal changes involved in more complex examples of memory, particularly declarative memory that requires the storage of facts and events (Byrne 2007). [[Convergence-divergence zone]]s might be the neural networks where memories are stored and retrieved. Considering that there are several kinds of memory, depending on types of represented knowledge, underlying mechanisms, processes functions and modes of acquisition, it is likely that different brain areas support different memory systems and that they are in mutual relationships in neuronal networks: \"components of memory representation are distributed widely across different parts of the brain as mediated by multiple neocortical circuits\".<ref name=\"crossingdialogues.com\">{{cite journal | author = Ofengenden Tzofit | year = 2014 | title = Memory formation and belief | url = http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-03.pdf | journal = Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 34\u201344 }}</ref>\n* [[Encoding (memory)|Encoding]]. Encoding of [[working memory]] involves the spiking of individual neurons induced by sensory input, which persists even after the sensory input disappears (Jensen and Lisman 2005; Fransen et al. 2002). Encoding of [[episodic memory]] involves persistent changes in molecular structures that alter [[synaptic transmission]] between neurons. Examples of such structural changes include [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP) or [[spike-timing-dependent plasticity]] (STDP).  The persistent spiking in working memory can enhance the synaptic and cellular changes in the encoding of episodic memory (Jensen and Lisman 2005).\n* Working memory. Recent functional imaging studies detected working memory signals in both [[medial temporal lobe]] (MTL), a brain area strongly associated with [[long-term memory]], and [[prefrontal cortex]] (Ranganath et al. 2005), suggesting a strong relationship between working memory and long-term memory. However, the substantially more working memory signals seen in the prefrontal lobe suggest that this area play a more important role in working memory than MTL (Suzuki 2007).\n* [[Memory consolidation|Consolidation]] and [[reconsolidation]]. [[Short-term memory]] (STM) is temporary and subject to disruption, while long-term memory (LTM), once consolidated, is persistent and stable. Consolidation of STM into LTM at the molecular level presumably involves two processes: synaptic consolidation and system consolidation. The former involves a protein synthesis process in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), whereas the latter transforms the MTL-dependent memory into an MTL-independent memory over months to years (Ledoux 2007). In recent years, such traditional consolidation dogma has been re-evaluated as a result of the studies on reconsolidation. These studies showed that prevention after [[recall (memory)|retrieval]] affects subsequent retrieval of the memory (Sara 2000). New studies have shown that post-retrieval treatment with protein synthesis inhibitors and many other compounds can lead to an amnestic state (Nadel et al. 2000b; Alberini 2005; Dudai 2006).  These findings on reconsolidation fit with the behavioral evidence that retrieved memory is not a carbon copy of the initial experiences, and memories are updated during retrieval.\n\n==Genetics==\n{{see also|Long-term potentiation|Eric Kandel}}\nStudy of the genetics of human memory is in its infancy though many genes have been investigated for their association to memory in humans and non-human animals. A notable initial success was the association of [[Apolipoprotein E|APOE]] with memory dysfunction in [[Alzheimer's disease]]. The search for genes associated with normally varying memory continues. One of the first candidates for normal variation in memory is the protein ''[[KIBRA]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/news/2006/10/20/20650.aspx |title=Gene called Kibra plays an important role in memory |publisher=News-medical.net |date= 2006-10-20|accessdate=2012-11-08}}</ref>'' which appears to be associated with the rate at which material is forgotten over a delay period.

The production of new proteins devoted to synapse reinforcement is triggered after the release of certain signaling substances (such as calcium within hippocampal neurons) in the cell. In the case of hippocampal cells, this release is dependent upon the expulsion of magnesium (a binding molecule) that is expelled after significant and repetitive synaptic signaling.

Those randomly assigned to the stress test group had a hand immersed in ice cold water (the reputable SECPT or 'Socially Evaluated Cold Pressor Test') for up to three minutes, while being monitored and videotaped.   Both the stress and control groups were then presented with 32 words to memorize.  Twenty-four hours later, both groups were tested to see how many words they could remember (free recall) as well as how many they could recognize from a larger list of words (recognition performance). The results showed a clear impairment of memory performance in the stress test group, who recalled 30% fewer words than the control group.  The researchers suggest that stress experienced during learning distracts people by diverting their attention during the memory encoding process.\n\nHowever, memory performance can be enhanced when material is linked to the learning context, even when learning occurs under stress.  A separate study by cognitive psychologists Schwabe and Wolf shows that when retention testing is done in a context similar to or congruent with the original learning task (i.e., in the same room), memory impairment and the detrimental effects of stress on learning can be attenuated.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schwabe|first1=L.|last2=Wolf|first2=O.T.|title=The context counts: Congruent learning and testing environments prevent memory retrieval impairment following stress|journal=Affective & Behavioral Neuroscience|year=2009|volume=9|issue=3|pages=229\u2013236|doi=10.3758/CABN.9.3.229|pmid=19679758}}</ref> Seventy-two healthy female and male university students, randomly assigned to the [[SECPT stress test]] or to a control group, were asked to remember the locations of 15 pairs of picture cards \u2013 a computerized version of the card game \"Concentration\" or \"Memory\".

The memory performance of subjects who experienced stress during the object-location task decreased significantly when they were tested in an unfamiliar room without the vanilla scent (an incongruent context);  however, the memory performance of stressed subjects showed no impairment when they were tested in the original room with the vanilla scent (a congruent context).   All participants in the experiment, both stressed and unstressed, performed faster when the learning and retrieval contexts were similar.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schwabe|first1=L.|last2=Bohringer|first2=A.|last3=Wolf|first3=O.T.|title=Stress disrupts context-dependent memory|journal=[[Learning and Memory]]|year=2009|volume=16|issue=2|pages=110\u2013113|doi=10.1101/lm.1257509|pmid=19181616|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nThis research on the [[effects of stress on memory]] may have practical implications for education, for eyewitness testimony and for psychotherapy:  students may perform better when tested in their regular classroom rather than an exam room, eyewitnesses may recall details better at the scene of an event than in a courtroom, and persons suffering from [[post-traumatic stress]] may improve when helped to situate their [[memories of a traumatic event]] in an appropriate context.\n\nStressful life experiences may be a cause of memory loss as a person ages. [[Glucocorticoids]] that are released during stress, damage neurons that are located in the [[hippocampal]] region of the brain. Therefore, the more stressful situations that someone encounters, the more susceptible they are to memory loss later on. The [[CA1 neurons]] found in the hippocampus are destroyed due to glucocorticoids decreasing the release of glucose and the reuptake of [[glutamate]]. This high level of extracellular glutamate allows calcium to enter [[NMDA receptors]] which in return kills neurons. Stressful life experiences can also cause repression of memories where a person moves an unbearable memory to the unconscious mind.<ref name=\":0\" /> This directly relates to traumatic events in one's past such as kidnappings, being prisoners of war or sexual abuse as a child.\n\nThe more long term the exposure to stress is, the more impact it may have. However, short term exposure to stress also causes impairment in memory by interfering with the function of the hippocampus. Research shows that subjects placed in a stressful situation for a short amount of time still have blood glucocorticoid levels that have increased drastically when measured after the exposure is completed. When subjects are asked to complete a learning task after short term exposure they often have difficulties. Prenatal stress also hinders the ability to learn and memorize by disrupting the development of the hippocampus and can lead to unestablished long term potentiation in the offspring of severely stressed parents. Although the stress is applied prenatally, the offspring show increased levels of glucocorticoids when they are subjected to stress later on in life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=N.|year=2013|title=Physiology of Behavior, eleventh edition|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Pearson}}</ref>\n\n==Sleep==\nMaking memories occurs through a three-step process, which can be enhanced by [[sleep]]. The three steps are as follows:\n# Acquisition which is the process of storage and retrieval of new information in memory\n# [[Memory consolidation|Consolidation]]\n# [[Recall (memory)|Recall]]\nSleep affects memory consolidation. During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhances the brain's abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS).<ref name=\"Sleep Deprivation and Memory Loss\">{{cite web|last1=Karriem-Norwood|first1=Varnada|title=Sleep Deprivation and Memory Loss|url=http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-deprivation-effects-on-memory|website=Web MD|publisher=Web MD LLC|accessdate=November 20, 2014}}</ref> This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesn't enhance every memory.  It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. During sleep, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory. When one does not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong, resulting in a lower retention rate of memories. Sleep deprivation makes it harder to focus, resulting in inefficient learning.<ref name=\"Sleep Deprivation and Memory Loss\"/> Furthermore, some studies have shown that sleep deprivation can lead to false memories as the memories are not properly transferred to long-term memory.\nOne of the primary functions of sleep is thought to be the improvement of the consolidation of information, as several studies have demonstrated that memory depends on getting sufficient sleep between training and test.<ref name=\"Ellenbogen 2006\">{{cite journal|author1=Ellenbogen, J.M. |author2=Hulbert, J.C. |author3=Stickgold, R. |author4=Dinges, D.F. |author5=Thompson-Schill, S.L. |title=Interfering with theories of sleep and memory: sleep, declarative memory, and associative interference |journal=Curr.

To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974)<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Loftus EF, Palmer JC|title=Reconstruction of automobile destruction: An example of the interaction between language and memory |journal=Journal of Verbal Learning & Verbal Behavior |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=585\u2013589 |year=1974 |doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(74)80011-3}}</ref> in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw.  The researchers found that the people who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they ''smashed'' into each other?\" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they ''hit'' each other?\"  Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they had seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with ''smashed'' were twice more likely to report that they had seen broken glass than those who had been asked the question with ''hit''.  There was no broken glass depicted in the film.  Thus, the wording of the questions distorted viewers' memories of the event.  Importantly, the wording of the question led people to construct different memories of the event \u2013 those who were asked the question with ''smashed'' recalled a more serious car accident than they had actually seen.  The findings of this experiment were replicated around the world, and researchers consistently demonstrated that when people were provided with misleading information they tended to misremember, a phenomenon known as the [[misinformation effect]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Loftus GR |title=When a lie becomes memory's truth: Memory distortion after exposure to misinformation |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=121\u2013123 |year=1992 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10769035}}</ref>\n\nResearch has revealed that asking individuals to repeatedly imagine actions that they have never performed or events that they have never experienced could result in false memories.

Findings revealed that those participants who repeatedly imagined performing such an act were more likely to think that they had actually performed that act during the first session of the experiment.  Similarly, Garry and her colleagues (1996)<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Garry M, Manning CG, Loftus EF, Sherman SJ |title=Imagination inflation: Imagining a childhood event inflates confidence that it occurred |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin & Review |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=208\u2013214 |year=1996 |doi=10.3758/bf03212420|pmid=24213869 |doi-access=free }}</ref> asked college students to report how certain they were that they experienced a number of events as children (e.g., broke a window with their hand) and then two weeks later asked them to imagine four of those events.  The researchers found that one-fourth of the students asked to imagine the four events reported that they had actually experienced such events as children.  That is, when asked to imagine the events they were more confident that they experienced the events.\n\nResearch reported in 2013 revealed that it is possible to artificially stimulate prior memories and artificially implant false memories in mice. Using [[optogenetics]], a team of RIKEN-MIT scientists caused the mice to incorrectly associate a benign environment with a prior unpleasant experience from different surroundings. Some scientists believe that the study may have implications in studying false memory formation in humans, and in treating PTSD and [[schizophrenia]].<ref name=BBC20130725>{{cite news |title=Scientists can implant false memories into mice |first=Melissa |last=Hogenboom |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23447600 |newspaper=BBC News |date=July 25, 2013 |access-date=July 26, 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ted.com/talks/steve_ramirez_and_xu_liu_a_mouse_a_laser_beam_a_manipulated_memory.html \"A mouse.

During this process, memories can be further strengthened and added to but there is also risk of manipulation involved. We like to think of our memories as something stable and constant when they are stored in long-term memory but this isn't the case. There are a large number of studies that that found that consolidation of memories is not a singular event but are put through the process again, known as reconsolidation.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite journal|last=Tronson|first=Natalie C.|last2=Taylor|first2=Jane R.|date=April 2007|title=Molecular mechanisms of memory reconsolidation|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|volume=8|issue=4|pages=262\u2013275|doi=10.1038/nrn2090|pmid=17342174|issn=1471-003X}}</ref> This is when a memory is recalled or retrieved and placed back into your working memory.

This study examined 17 subjects, (average age 53) with normal memory performance.\nEight subjects were asked to follow a \"brain healthy\" diet, relaxation, physical, and mental exercise (brain teasers and verbal memory training techniques). After 14 days, they showed greater word fluency (not memory) compared to their baseline performance.

Some of the recommendations are to stay intellectually active through learning, training or reading, to keep physically active so to promote blood circulation to the brain, to socialize, to reduce stress, to keep sleep time regular, to avoid depression or emotional instability and to observe good nutrition.\n\n[[Memorization]] is a method of learning that allows an individual to recall information verbatim. [[Rote learning]] is the method most often used. Methods of memorizing things have been the subject of much discussion over the years with some writers, such as [[Cosmos Rossellius]] using visual [[alphabets]]. The [[spacing effect]] shows that an individual is more likely to remember a list of items when rehearsal is spaced over an extended period of time. In contrast to this is [[Cram school|cramming]]: an intensive memorization in a short period of time. the spacing effect is exploited to improve memory in [[spaced repetition]] flashcard training. Also relevant is the [[Zeigarnik effect]] which states that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed ones. The so-called [[Method of loci]] uses spatial memory to memorize non-spatial information.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Olsson Henrik, Poom Leo, Treisman Anne | year = 2005 | title = Visual memory needs categories | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 24| pages = 8776\u20138780 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0500810102 | pmid = 15937119 | pmc = 1150822 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.8776O }}</ref>\n\n== In plants ==\nPlants lack a specialized organ devoted to memory retention, and so plant memory has been a controversial topic in recent years.

Native to the subtropical wetlands of the eastern United States, Venus Fly Traps have evolved the ability to obtain meat for sustenance, likely due to the lack of nitrogen in the soil.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Hedrich|first=Rainer|last2=Neher|first2=Erwin|year=2018|title=Venus Flytrap: How an Excitable, Carnivorous Plant Works|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=23|issue=3|pages=220\u2013234|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2017.12.004|pmid=29336976|issn=1360-1385}}</ref> This is done by two trap-forming leaf tips that snap shut once triggered by a potential prey. On each lobe, three triggers hairs await stimulation. In order to maximize the benefit to cost ratio, the plant enables a rudimentary form of memory in which two trigger hairs must be stimulated within 30 seconds in order to result in trap closure.<ref name=\":1\" /> This system ensures that the trap only closes when potential prey is within grasp.\n\nThe time lapse between trigger hair stimulations suggests that the plant can remember an initial stimulus long enough for a second stimulus to initiate trap closure. This memory isn't encoded in a brain, as plants lack this specialized organ. Rather, information is stored in the form of cytoplasmic calcium levels. The first trigger causes a subthreshold cytoplasmic calcium influx.<ref name=\":1\" /> This initial trigger isn't enough to activate trap closure, and so a subsequent stimulus allows for a secondary influx of calcium. The latter calcium rise superimposes on the initial one, creating an action potential that passes threshold, resulting in trap closure.<ref name=\":1\" /> Researchers, to prove that an electrical threshold must be met to stimulate trap closure, excited a single trigger hair with a constant mechanical stimulus using Ag/AgCl electrodes.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Volkov|first=Alexander G.|last2=Carrell|first2=Holly|last3=Baldwin|first3=Andrew|last4=Markin|first4=Vladislav S.|date=2009|title=Electrical memory in Venus flytrap|journal=Bioelectrochemistry|volume=75|issue=2|pages=142\u2013147|doi=10.1016/j.bioelechem.2009.03.005|pmid=19356999|issn=1567-5394}}</ref> The trap closed after only a few seconds.

The ability to look at an item and remember what it looked like with just a split second of observation, or memorization, is the example of sensory memory. It is out of cognitive control and is an automatic response. With very short presentations, participants often report that they seem to \"see\" more than they can actually report. The first experiments exploring this form of sensory memory were precisely conducted by [[George Sperling]] (1963)<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/001872086300500103|pmid = 13990068|title = A Model for Visual Memory Tasks|journal = Human Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society|volume = 5|pages = 19\u201331|year = 1963|last1 = Sperling|first1 = George}}</ref>  using the \"partial report paradigm\".  Subjects were presented with a grid of 12 letters, arranged into three rows of four. After a brief presentation, subjects were then played either a high, medium or low tone, cuing them which of the rows to report. Based on these partial report experiments, Sperling was able to show that the capacity of sensory memory was approximately 12 items, but that it degraded very quickly (within a few hundred milliseconds). Because this form of memory degrades so quickly, participants would see the display but be unable to report all of the items (12 in the \"whole report\" procedure) before they decayed. This type of memory cannot be prolonged via rehearsal.\n\nThree types of sensory memories exist. [[Iconic memory]] is a fast decaying store of visual information; a type of sensory memory that briefly stores an image which has been perceived for a small duration. [[Echoic memory]] is a fast decaying store of auditory information, another type of sensory memory that briefly stores sounds that have been perceived for short durations.<ref name=\"Carlson 2010\">{{cite book |author=Carlson, Neil R. |title=Psychology: the science of behavior |publisher=Allyn & Bacon |location=Boston, Mass |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=978-0-205-68557-8 |oclc=268547522}}</ref> [[Haptic memory]] is a type of sensory memory that represents a database for touch stimuli.\n\n==Short-term memory==\n{{Main|Short-term memory}}\nShort-term memory is also known as '''working memory'''. Short-term memory allows recall for a period of several seconds to a minute without rehearsal. Its capacity is also very limited: In 1956, [[George Armitage Miller|George A. Miller]] (b. 1920), when working at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]], conducted experiments showing that the store of short-term memory was 7\u00b12 items (the title of his famous paper, \"[[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|The magical number 7\u00b12]]\").

This method of remembering telephone numbers is far more effective than attempting to remember a string of 10 digits; this is because we are able to chunk the information into meaningful groups of numbers.  This may be reflected in some countries in the tendency to display telephone numbers as several chunks of two to four numbers.\n\nShort-term memory is believed to rely mostly on an acoustic code for storing information, and to a lesser extent a visual code.

Conrad's (1964) study, however, deals with the encoding of written text; thus, while memory of written language may rely on acoustic components, generalisations to all forms of memory cannot be made.\n\n==Long-term memory==\n{{Main|Long-term memory}}\n[[File:Memory-Warner-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|150px|[[Olin Levi Warner]], ''Memory'' (1896). Library of Congress [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington, D.C.]]\nThe storage in sensory memory and short-term memory generally has a strictly limited capacity and duration, which means that information is not retained indefinitely. By contrast, long-term memory can store much larger quantities of information for potentially unlimited duration (sometimes a whole life span). Its capacity is immeasurable. For example, given a random seven-digit number, one may remember it for only a few seconds before forgetting, suggesting it was stored in short-term memory. On the other hand, one can remember telephone numbers for many years through repetition; this information is said to be stored in long-term memory.\n\nWhile short-term memory encodes information acoustically, long-term memory encodes it semantically: Baddeley (1966)<ref name=\"Baddeley 1966\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/14640746608400047 | author = Baddeley, A.D. | year = 1966 | title = The influence of acoustic and semantic similarity on long-term memory for word sequences | url = | journal = Q.

The [[hippocampus]] is essential (for learning new information) to the consolidation of information from short-term to long-term memory, although it does not seem to store information itself.

Atkinson|Atkinson]] and [[Richard Shiffrin|Shiffrin]].\n\nThe multi-store model has been criticised for being too simplistic. For instance, long-term memory is believed to be actually made up of multiple subcomponents, such as episodic and [[procedural memory]]. It also proposes that rehearsal is the only mechanism by which information eventually reaches long-term storage, but evidence shows us capable of remembering things without rehearsal.\n\nThe model also shows all the memory stores as being a single unit whereas research into this shows differently. For example, short-term memory can be broken up into different units such as visual information and acoustic information. In a study by Zlonoga and Gerber (1986), patient 'KF' demonstrated certain deviations from the Atkinson\u2013Shiffrin model. Patient KF was [[brain damage]]d, displaying difficulties regarding short-term memory. Recognition of sounds such as spoken numbers, letters, words and easily identifiable noises (such as doorbells and cats meowing) were all impacted. Visual short-term memory was unaffected, suggesting a dichotomy between visual and audial memory.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=3952419 | volume=75 | issue=7 | title=A case from practice (49).

In this model, working memory consists of three basic stores: the central executive, the phonological loop and the visuo-spatial sketchpad. In 2000 this model was expanded with the multimodal episodic buffer ([[Baddeley's model of working memory]]).<ref name=\"Baddeley 2000\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01538-2 | author = Baddeley, A.D. | year = 2000 | title = The episodic buffer: a new component of working memory? | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 11| pages = 417\u201323 | pmid=11058819}}</ref>\n\nThe central executive essentially acts as an attention sensory store. It channels information to the three component processes: the phonological loop, the visuo-spatial sketchpad, and the episodic buffer.\n\nThe phonological loop stores auditory information by silently rehearsing sounds or words in a continuous loop: the articulatory process (for example the repetition of a telephone number over and over again). A short list of data is easier to remember.\n\nThe [[visuospatial sketchpad]] stores visual and spatial information. It is engaged when performing spatial tasks (such as judging distances) or visual ones (such as counting the windows on a house or imagining images).\n\nThe episodic buffer is dedicated to linking information across domains to form integrated units of visual, spatial, and verbal information and chronological ordering (e.g., the memory of a story or a movie scene). The episodic buffer is also assumed to have links to long-term memory and semantical meaning.\n\nThe working memory model explains many practical observations, such as why it is easier to do two different tasks (one verbal and one visual) than two similar tasks (e.g., two visual), and the aforementioned word-length effect.  Working memory is also the premise for what allows us to do everyday activities involving thought. It is the section of memory where we carry out thought processes and use them to learn and reason about topics.<ref name=\"Baddeley 2000\"/>\n\n==Types==\nResearchers distinguish between '''recognition''' and '''recall''' memory.  Recognition memory tasks require individuals to indicate whether they have encountered a stimulus (such as a picture or a word) before.  Recall memory tasks require participants to retrieve previously learned information.  For example, individuals might be asked  to produce a series of actions they have seen before or to say a list of words they have heard before.\n\n===By information type===\n'''Topographic memory''' involves the ability to orient oneself in space, to recognize and follow an itinerary, or to recognize familiar places.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.med.univ-rennes1.fr/iidris/cache/an/40/4003 |title=IIDRSI: topographic memory loss |publisher=Med.univ-rennes1.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430232457/http://www.med.univ-rennes1.fr/iidris/cache/an/40/4003 |archivedate=2013-04-30 }}</ref> Getting lost when traveling alone is an example of the failure of topographic memory.<ref name=\"Aguirre 1999\">{{cite journal |author1=Aguirre, G.K. |author2=D'Esposito, M. |title=Topographical disorientation: a synthesis and taxonomy |journal=Brain |volume=122 |issue= 9|pages=1613\u201328 |date=September 1999|pmid=10468502 |doi= 10.1093/brain/122.9.1613 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n'''Flashbulb memories''' are clear [[episodic memories]] of unique and highly emotional events.<ref>T.L.

It is sometimes called ''[[explicit memory]]'', since it consists of information that is explicitly stored and retrieved.\n\nDeclarative memory can be further sub-divided into [[semantic memory]], concerning principles and facts taken independent of context; and [[episodic memory]], concerning information specific to a particular context, such as a time and place. Semantic memory allows the encoding of abstract [[knowledge]] about the world, such as \"Paris is the capital of France\". Episodic memory, on the other hand, is used for more personal memories, such as the sensations, emotions, and personal associations of a particular place or time. Episodic memories often reflect the \"firsts\" in life such as a first kiss, first day of school or first time winning a championship. These are key events in one's life that can be remembered clearly.  [[Autobiographical memory]] \u2013 memory for particular events within one's own life \u2013 is generally viewed as either equivalent to, or a subset of, episodic memory. [[Visual memory]] is part of memory preserving some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience. One is able to place in memory information that resembles objects, places, animals or people in sort of a [[mental image]]. Visual memory can result in [[priming (psychology)|priming]] and it is assumed some kind of perceptual representational system underlies this phenomenon.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n==== Procedural ====\nIn contrast, [[procedural memory]] (or ''[[implicit memory]]'') is not based on the conscious recall of information, but on [[implicit learning]]. It can best be summarized as remembering how to do something. Procedural memory is primarily employed in learning [[motor skill]]s and should be considered a subset of implicit memory. It is revealed when one does better in a given task due only to repetition \u2013 no new explicit memories have been formed, but one is [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]] accessing aspects of those previous experiences. Procedural memory involved in [[motor learning]] depends on the [[cerebellum]] and [[basal ganglia]].\n\nA characteristic of procedural memory is that the things remembered are automatically translated into actions, and thus sometimes difficult to describe. Some examples of procedural memory include the ability to ride a bike or tie shoelaces.<ref name=\"Schacter 2011\">{{cite book |author1=Schacter, Daniel L |author2=Gilbert, Daniel T |author3=Wegner, Daniel M |title= Implicit Memory and Explicit Memory |work=Psychology |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=New York |year=2010 |pages=238 |isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2 |oclc=755079969 }}</ref>\n\n===By temporal direction===\nAnother major way to distinguish different memory functions is whether the content to be remembered is in the past, [[retrospective memory]], or in the future, [[prospective memory]]. Thus, retrospective memory as a category includes semantic, episodic  and autobiographical memory. In contrast, prospective memory is memory for future intentions, or ''remembering to remember'' (Winograd, 1988). Prospective memory can be further broken down into event- and time-based prospective remembering. Time-based prospective memories are triggered by a time-cue, such as going to the doctor (action) at 4pm (cue). Event-based prospective memories are intentions triggered by cues, such as remembering to post a letter (action) after seeing a mailbox (cue). Cues do not need to be related to the action (as the mailbox/letter example), and lists, sticky-notes, knotted handkerchiefs, or string around the finger all exemplify cues that people use as strategies to enhance prospective memory.\n\n==Study techniques==\n===To assess infants===\n\nInfants do not have the language ability to report on their memories and so verbal reports cannot be used to assess very young children's memory.  Throughout the years, however, researchers have adapted and developed a number of measures for assessing both infants' recognition memory and their recall memory.  [[Habituation]] and [[operant conditioning]] techniques have been used to assess infants' recognition memory and the deferred and elicited imitation techniques have been used to assess infants' recall memory.\n\nTechniques used to assess infants' recognition memory include the following:\n* '''Visual paired comparison procedure (relies on habituation)''': infants are first presented with pairs of visual stimuli, such as two black-and-white photos of human faces, for a fixed amount of time; then, after being familiarized with the two photos, they are presented with the \"familiar\" photo and a new photo.  The time spent looking at each photo is recorded.  Looking longer at the new photo indicates that they remember the \"familiar\" one.  Studies using this procedure have found that 5- to 6-month-olds can retain information for as long as fourteen days.<ref name=\"Fagan 1974\">{{cite journal |author=Fagan, J.F. |title=Infant recognition memory: the effects of length of familiarization and type of discrimination task |journal=Child Dev |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=351\u2013356 |date=June 1974 |pmid=4837713 |jstor=1127955 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1974.tb00603.x }}</ref>\n* '''Operant conditioning technique''': infants are placed in a crib and a ribbon that is connected to a mobile overhead is tied to one of their feet.  Infants notice that when they kick their foot the mobile moves \u2013 the rate of kicking increases dramatically within minutes.  Studies using this technique have revealed that infants' memory substantially improves over the first 18-months.  Whereas 2- to 3-month-olds can retain an operant response (such as activating the mobile by kicking their foot) for a week, 6-month-olds can retain it for two weeks, and 18-month-olds can retain a similar operant response for as long as 13 weeks.<ref name=\"Rovee-Collier 1999\">{{cite journal|last1=Rovee-Collier|first1=Carolyn|title=The Development of Infant Memory|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=8| issue=3|year=1999| pages=80\u201385| issn=0963-7214|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00019 |url=http://bernard.pitzer.edu/~dmoore/psych199s03articles/R-Collier_memory.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"Rovee-Collier 1993\">{{cite book |author=Rovee-Collier, C.K., Bhatt, R.S. | title=Evidence of long-term retention in infancy |work=Annals of Child Development |editor= Ross Vasta |publisher=Jessica Kingsley Pub |location=London |volume=9 |year=1993 |pages=1\u201345 |isbn=978-1-85302-219-7 |oclc=827689578}}</ref><ref name=\"Hartshorn 1998\">{{cite journal |author1=Hartshorn, K. |author2=Rovee-Collier, C. |author3=Gerhardstein, P. |title=The ontogeny of long-term memory over the first year-and-a-half of life |journal=Dev Psychobiol |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201389 |date=March 1998 |pmid=9526683 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2302(199803)32:2<69::AID-DEV1>3.0.CO;2-Q |url=|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nTechniques used to assess infants' recall memory include the following:\n* '''Deferred imitation technique''': an experimenter shows infants a unique sequence of actions (such as using a stick to push a button on a box) and then, after a delay, asks the infants to imitate the actions.

He postulated that any memory that stayed in short-term storage for a long enough time would be consolidated into a long-term memory. Later research showed this to be false. Research has shown that direct injections of [[cortisol]] or [[epinephrine]] help the storage of recent experiences. This is also true for stimulation of the amygdala. This proves that excitement enhances memory by the stimulation of hormones that affect the amygdala. Excessive or prolonged stress (with prolonged cortisol) may hurt memory storage. Patients with amygdalar damage are no more likely to remember emotionally charged words than nonemotionally charged ones. The hippocampus is important for explicit memory. The hippocampus is also important for memory consolidation. The hippocampus receives input from different parts of the cortex and sends its output out to different parts of the brain also. The input comes from secondary and tertiary sensory areas that have processed the information a lot already. Hippocampal damage may also cause [[memory loss]] and problems with memory storage.<ref>{{cite book| last =Kalat| first =J.W.| title =Biological psychology (7th ed.)| publisher = Wadsworth Publishing| year =2001   | location =Belmont, CA }}</ref> This memory loss includes retrograde amnesia which is the loss of memory for events that occurred shortly before the time of brain damage.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Cognitive neuroscience==\nCognitive neuroscientists consider memory as the retention, reactivation, and reconstruction of the experience-independent internal representation. The term of internal [[Mental representation|representation]] implies that such a definition of memory contains two components: the expression of memory at the behavioral or conscious level, and the underpinning physical neural changes (Dudai 2007). The latter component is also called [[engram (neuropsychology)|engram]] or memory traces (Semon 1904). Some neuroscientists and psychologists mistakenly equate the concept of engram and memory, broadly conceiving all persisting after-effects of experiences as memory; others argue against this notion that memory does not exist until it is revealed in behavior or thought (Moscovitch 2007).\n\nOne question that is crucial in cognitive neuroscience is how information and mental experiences are coded and represented in the brain. Scientists have gained much knowledge about the neuronal codes from the studies of plasticity, but most of such research has been focused on simple learning in simple neuronal circuits; it is considerably less clear about the neuronal changes involved in more complex examples of memory, particularly declarative memory that requires the storage of facts and events (Byrne 2007). [[Convergence-divergence zone]]s might be the neural networks where memories are stored and retrieved. Considering that there are several kinds of memory, depending on types of represented knowledge, underlying mechanisms, processes functions and modes of acquisition, it is likely that different brain areas support different memory systems and that they are in mutual relationships in neuronal networks: \"components of memory representation are distributed widely across different parts of the brain as mediated by multiple neocortical circuits\".<ref name=\"crossingdialogues.com\">{{cite journal | author = Ofengenden Tzofit | year = 2014 | title = Memory formation and belief | url = http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-03.pdf | journal = Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 34\u201344 }}</ref>\n* [[Encoding (memory)|Encoding]]. Encoding of [[working memory]] involves the spiking of individual neurons induced by sensory input, which persists even after the sensory input disappears (Jensen and Lisman 2005; Fransen et al. 2002). Encoding of [[episodic memory]] involves persistent changes in molecular structures that alter [[synaptic transmission]] between neurons. Examples of such structural changes include [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP) or [[spike-timing-dependent plasticity]] (STDP).  The persistent spiking in working memory can enhance the synaptic and cellular changes in the encoding of episodic memory (Jensen and Lisman 2005).\n* Working memory. Recent functional imaging studies detected working memory signals in both [[medial temporal lobe]] (MTL), a brain area strongly associated with [[long-term memory]], and [[prefrontal cortex]] (Ranganath et al. 2005), suggesting a strong relationship between working memory and long-term memory. However, the substantially more working memory signals seen in the prefrontal lobe suggest that this area play a more important role in working memory than MTL (Suzuki 2007).\n* [[Memory consolidation|Consolidation]] and [[reconsolidation]]. [[Short-term memory]] (STM) is temporary and subject to disruption, while long-term memory (LTM), once consolidated, is persistent and stable. Consolidation of STM into LTM at the molecular level presumably involves two processes: synaptic consolidation and system consolidation. The former involves a protein synthesis process in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), whereas the latter transforms the MTL-dependent memory into an MTL-independent memory over months to years (Ledoux 2007). In recent years, such traditional consolidation dogma has been re-evaluated as a result of the studies on reconsolidation. These studies showed that prevention after [[recall (memory)|retrieval]] affects subsequent retrieval of the memory (Sara 2000). New studies have shown that post-retrieval treatment with protein synthesis inhibitors and many other compounds can lead to an amnestic state (Nadel et al. 2000b; Alberini 2005; Dudai 2006).  These findings on reconsolidation fit with the behavioral evidence that retrieved memory is not a carbon copy of the initial experiences, and memories are updated during retrieval.\n\n==Genetics==\n{{see also|Long-term potentiation|Eric Kandel}}\nStudy of the genetics of human memory is in its infancy though many genes have been investigated for their association to memory in humans and non-human animals. A notable initial success was the association of [[Apolipoprotein E|APOE]] with memory dysfunction in [[Alzheimer's disease]]. The search for genes associated with normally varying memory continues. One of the first candidates for normal variation in memory is the protein ''[[KIBRA]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/news/2006/10/20/20650.aspx |title=Gene called Kibra plays an important role in memory |publisher=News-medical.net |date= 2006-10-20|accessdate=2012-11-08}}</ref>'' which appears to be associated with the rate at which material is forgotten over a delay period.

The production of new proteins devoted to synapse reinforcement is triggered after the release of certain signaling substances (such as calcium within hippocampal neurons) in the cell. In the case of hippocampal cells, this release is dependent upon the expulsion of magnesium (a binding molecule) that is expelled after significant and repetitive synaptic signaling. The temporary expulsion of magnesium frees NMDA receptors to release calcium in the cell, a signal that leads to gene transcription and the construction of reinforcing proteins.<ref>Neihoff, Debra (2005) \"The Language of Life 'How cells Communicate in Health and Disease'\" Speak Memory, 210\u2013223.</ref> For more information, see [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP).\n\nOne of the newly synthesized proteins in LTP is also critical for maintaining long-term memory. This protein is an autonomously active form of the enzyme [[protein kinase C]] (PKC), known as [[PKM\u03b6]]. PKM\u03b6 maintains the activity-dependent enhancement of synaptic strength and inhibiting [[PKM\u03b6]] erases established long-term memories, without affecting short-term memory or, once the inhibitor is eliminated, the ability to encode and store new long-term memories is restored. Also, [[BDNF]] is important for the persistence of long-term memories.<ref>{{Cite journal\n | last1 = Bekinschtein | first1 = Pedro | last2 = Cammarota | first2=Martin | last3 = Katche | first3 = Cynthia | last4 = Slipczuk | first4 = Leandro | last5 = Rossato | first5 = Janine I. | last6 = Goldin | first6 = Andrea | last7 = Izquierdo | first7 = Ivan | last8 = Medina | first8 = Jorge H.\n | title = BDNF is essential to promote persistence of long-term memory storage\n | journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA]]\n | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0711863105\n | date = February 2008\n | volume = 105\n | issue = 7\n | pages = 2711\u20132716\n | pmid = 18263738\n | pmc = 2268201\n| bibcode = 2008PNAS..105.2711B }}</ref>\n\nThe long-term stabilization of synaptic changes is also determined by a parallel increase of pre- and postsynaptic structures such as [[Bouton (synapse)|axonal bouton]], [[dendritic spine]] and [[postsynaptic density]].<ref name=\"stabilization_plasticity\">\n{{cite journal\n  |last=Meyer\n  |first=D.\n  |author2=Bonhoeffer T., and Scheuss V.\n  |year=2014\n  |title=Balance and Stability of Synaptic Structures during Synaptic Plasticity \n  |journal=Neuron\n  |volume=82\n  |issue=2\n  |pages=430\u2013443\n  |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2014.02.031\n  |pmid=24742464}}</ref>\nOn the molecular level, an increase of the postsynaptic scaffolding proteins [[PSD-95]] and [[HOMER1]]c has been shown to correlate with the stabilization of synaptic enlargement.<ref name=\"stabilization_plasticity\" /> The cAMP response element-binding protein ([[CREB]]) is a [[transcription factor]] which is believed to be important in consolidating short-term to long-term memories, and which is believed to be downregulated in [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0959-4388(96)80082-1 | pmid=8725970 | volume=6 | issue=2 | title=CREB and the formation of long-term memory | journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology | pages=264\u2013268| year=1996 | last1=Yin | first1=Jerry CP | last2=Tully | first2=Timothy }}</ref>\n\n===[[DNA methylation]] and [[DNA demethylation|demethylation]]===\n\nRats exposed to an intense [[learning]] event may retain a life-long memory of the event, even after a single training session.

Furthermore, many other genes were [[downregulation and upregulation|upregulated]], likely often due to hypomethylation.  Hypomethylation often results from the removal of methyl groups from previously existing [[5-methylcytosine]]s in DNA.  Demethylation is carried out by several proteins acting in concert, including the enzyme [[Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 1]] as well as enzymes of the DNA [[base excision repair]] pathway (see [[Epigenetics in learning and memory]]).  The pattern of induced and repressed genes in brain neurons subsequent to an intense learning event likely provides the molecular basis for a long-term memory of the event.\n\n===Epigenetics===\n{{Main|Epigenetics in learning and memory}}\nStudies of the molecular basis for memory formation indicate that [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] mechanisms operating in [[brain]] [[neuron]]s play a central role in determining this capability.  Key epigenetic mechanisms involved in memory include the [[DNA methylation|methylation]] and [[DNA demethylation|demethylation]] of neuronal DNA, as well as modifications of [[histone]] proteins including [[histone methylation|methylations]], [[histone acetylation and deacetylation|acetylations and deacetylations]].\n\nStimulation of brain activity in memory formation is often accompanied by the generation of [[DNA damage|damage in neuronal DNA]] that is followed by repair associated with persistent epigenetic alterations. In particular the DNA repair processes of [[non-homologous end joining]] and [[base excision repair]] are employed in memory formation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removal of citation to content from predatory publisher}}\n\n==In infancy==\n{{For|the inability of adults to retrieve early memories|Childhood amnesia}}\nUp until the mid-1980s it was assumed that infants could not encode, retain, and retrieve information.<ref>{{cite book |author=Teti D.M. |title=Handbook of research methods in developmental science: New developments in the study of infant memory |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=San Francisco |year=2005}}</ref>  A growing body of research now indicates that infants as young as 6-months can recall information after a 24-hour delay.<ref name=\"Barr R., Dowden A., & Hayne H. 1996 159\u2013170\">{{cite journal |author1=Barr R. |author2=Dowden A. |author3=Hayne H. |title=Developmental changes in deferred imitation by 6- to 24-month-old infants |journal=Infant Behavior and Development |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=159\u2013170 |year=1996 |doi=10.1016/s0163-6383(96)90015-6}}</ref>  Furthermore, research has revealed that as infants grow older they can store information for longer periods of time; 6-month-olds can recall information after a 24-hour period, 9-month-olds after up to five weeks, and 20-month-olds after as long as twelve months.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bauer P.J. |title=Getting explicit memory off the ground: Steps toward construction of a neuro-developmental account of changes in the first two years of life |journal=Developmental Review |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=347\u2013373 |year=2004 |doi=10.1016/j.dr.2004.08.003}}</ref>  In addition, studies have shown that with age, infants can store information faster.

In response to stressful situations, the brain releases hormones and neurotransmitters (ex. glucocorticoids and catecholamines) which affect memory encoding processes in the hippocampus.  Behavioural research on animals shows that chronic stress produces adrenal hormones which impact the hippocampal structure in the brains of rats.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Conrad C.D. | year = 2010 | title = A critical review of chronic stress effects on spatial learning and memory | url = | journal = [[Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry]] | volume = 34 | issue = 5| pages = 742\u2013755 | doi = 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2009.11.003 | pmid = 19903505 }}</ref>  An experimental study by German cognitive psychologists L.

Those randomly assigned to the stress test group had a hand immersed in ice cold water (the reputable SECPT or 'Socially Evaluated Cold Pressor Test') for up to three minutes, while being monitored and videotaped.   Both the stress and control groups were then presented with 32 words to memorize.  Twenty-four hours later, both groups were tested to see how many words they could remember (free recall) as well as how many they could recognize from a larger list of words (recognition performance). The results showed a clear impairment of memory performance in the stress test group, who recalled 30% fewer words than the control group.  The researchers suggest that stress experienced during learning distracts people by diverting their attention during the memory encoding process.\n\nHowever, memory performance can be enhanced when material is linked to the learning context, even when learning occurs under stress.  A separate study by cognitive psychologists Schwabe and Wolf shows that when retention testing is done in a context similar to or congruent with the original learning task (i.e., in the same room), memory impairment and the detrimental effects of stress on learning can be attenuated.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schwabe|first1=L.|last2=Wolf|first2=O.T.|title=The context counts: Congruent learning and testing environments prevent memory retrieval impairment following stress|journal=Affective & Behavioral Neuroscience|year=2009|volume=9|issue=3|pages=229\u2013236|doi=10.3758/CABN.9.3.229|pmid=19679758}}</ref> Seventy-two healthy female and male university students, randomly assigned to the [[SECPT stress test]] or to a control group, were asked to remember the locations of 15 pairs of picture cards \u2013 a computerized version of the card game \"Concentration\" or \"Memory\".

The memory performance of subjects who experienced stress during the object-location task decreased significantly when they were tested in an unfamiliar room without the vanilla scent (an incongruent context);  however, the memory performance of stressed subjects showed no impairment when they were tested in the original room with the vanilla scent (a congruent context).

[[Glucocorticoids]] that are released during stress, damage neurons that are located in the [[hippocampal]] region of the brain. Therefore, the more stressful situations that someone encounters, the more susceptible they are to memory loss later on. The [[CA1 neurons]] found in the hippocampus are destroyed due to glucocorticoids decreasing the release of glucose and the reuptake of [[glutamate]]. This high level of extracellular glutamate allows calcium to enter [[NMDA receptors]] which in return kills neurons. Stressful life experiences can also cause repression of memories where a person moves an unbearable memory to the unconscious mind.<ref name=\":0\" /> This directly relates to traumatic events in one's past such as kidnappings, being prisoners of war or sexual abuse as a child.\n\nThe more long term the exposure to stress is, the more impact it may have. However, short term exposure to stress also causes impairment in memory by interfering with the function of the hippocampus. Research shows that subjects placed in a stressful situation for a short amount of time still have blood glucocorticoid levels that have increased drastically when measured after the exposure is completed. When subjects are asked to complete a learning task after short term exposure they often have difficulties. Prenatal stress also hinders the ability to learn and memorize by disrupting the development of the hippocampus and can lead to unestablished long term potentiation in the offspring of severely stressed parents. Although the stress is applied prenatally, the offspring show increased levels of glucocorticoids when they are subjected to stress later on in life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=N.|year=2013|title=Physiology of Behavior, eleventh edition|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Pearson}}</ref>\n\n==Sleep==\nMaking memories occurs through a three-step process, which can be enhanced by [[sleep]]. The three steps are as follows:\n# Acquisition which is the process of storage and retrieval of new information in memory\n# [[Memory consolidation|Consolidation]]\n# [[Recall (memory)|Recall]]\nSleep affects memory consolidation. During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhances the brain's abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS).<ref name=\"Sleep Deprivation and Memory Loss\">{{cite web|last1=Karriem-Norwood|first1=Varnada|title=Sleep Deprivation and Memory Loss|url=http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-deprivation-effects-on-memory|website=Web MD|publisher=Web MD LLC|accessdate=November 20, 2014}}</ref> This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesn't enhance every memory.  It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. During sleep, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory. When one does not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong, resulting in a lower retention rate of memories. Sleep deprivation makes it harder to focus, resulting in inefficient learning.<ref name=\"Sleep Deprivation and Memory Loss\"/> Furthermore, some studies have shown that sleep deprivation can lead to false memories as the memories are not properly transferred to long-term memory.\nOne of the primary functions of sleep is thought to be the improvement of the consolidation of information, as several studies have demonstrated that memory depends on getting sufficient sleep between training and test.<ref name=\"Ellenbogen 2006\">{{cite journal|author1=Ellenbogen, J.M. |author2=Hulbert, J.C. |author3=Stickgold, R. |author4=Dinges, D.F. |author5=Thompson-Schill, S.L. |title=Interfering with theories of sleep and memory: sleep, declarative memory, and associative interference |journal=Curr.

There was no broken glass depicted in the film.  Thus, the wording of the questions distorted viewers' memories of the event.  Importantly, the wording of the question led people to construct different memories of the event \u2013 those who were asked the question with ''smashed'' recalled a more serious car accident than they had actually seen.  The findings of this experiment were replicated around the world, and researchers consistently demonstrated that when people were provided with misleading information they tended to misremember, a phenomenon known as the [[misinformation effect]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Loftus GR |title=When a lie becomes memory's truth: Memory distortion after exposure to misinformation |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=121\u2013123 |year=1992 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10769035}}</ref>\n\nResearch has revealed that asking individuals to repeatedly imagine actions that they have never performed or events that they have never experienced could result in false memories.

After marriage the entire family, including Shaina, is haunted by the spirit of a woman who usually leaves a red cloth around. The spirit is revealed to be of Kunal's ex-wife Sunaina, who died mysteriously 4 years ago. In a twist, it is revealed that Shaina is in fact Sunaina, who had plastic surgery. She married Kunal to take revenge as she thinks he tried to kill her. Kunal is then revealed to have been innocent all along. It was in fact her mother-in-law, Ramola Sikand, who tried to kill Sunaina. Thus a cold war begins between Ramola and Shaina.\n\nKunal's stepbrother Anish, who is Ramola's son, is married to Nisha and is cold towards Shaina. Kunal's youngest stepbrother Nakul is engaged to Surbhi. She commits suicide after finding out about her pregnancy and Nakul leaves the country. Natasha, Avantika and Malvika are the Sikand daughters and sisters of Kunal, Anish and Nakul. Aman got engaged with Natasha Sikand, however due to mismatch of both of their Kundali, Aman broke the engagement, eventually Natasha marries Akash. Avantika and Malvika marry Aman's brothers and move out of Sikand household. Nakul eventually returns and marries Sunidhi. \n\nShaina digs out Ramola's past life and finds Kunal's real mother is actually Nirupa. She is in an asylum. Ramola gave drugs (Kairoxin) to make Nirupa mentally ill and then tricked Kunal's father into marrying her to get his entire property. Shaina brings Nirupa home and starts taking care of her and makes her well but frustrates Ramola in the process. Ramola decides to take revenge and tries to shoot Shaina in the temple after which Ramola's true face is revealed to Kunal. Kunal decides to replace Ramola Sikand and take all their ownership of Sikand group of companies. Ramola kills Kunal by pushing a breakfree car towards him. Ramola brings Kunal's look-alike, Kuljeet, from Haryana to replace Kunal in the Sikand household and the business. Kunal, who has managed to survive, loses his memory and ends up joining a criminal organisation renaming himself Shaan. Shaan and his cohorts find Kuljeet in a temple and kidnap him so that Shaan can enter the Sikand household. Kunal enters the Sikand family and gradually regains his memory and joins forces with Shaina to destroy Ramola. \nKuljeet was deeply in love with Sikand family, especially Shaina, so he tried his best to prove Kunal wrong. Finally Kunal proves that he is the real Kunal and Kuljeet returns to Haryana. Ramola and Kunal compromise by hiding each other's sins, Ramola trying to kill Kunal and Kunal being Shaan, a Criminal.\n\n'''Maansi - Transition of Sunaina to Shaina Anisha'''<br />\nKaran Seth enters the Sikand Household and claims Shaina is actually Maansi. The fact is, when Sunaina was burnt, she lived with her burnt face for one year and then met Maansi. They were traveling together and met an accident. Maansi was killed in the accident, and mistakenly Sunaina's face was changed to Sankirti's face, the present face of Anisha Shaina. Kunal loses his faith on Shaina and he believes she is Maansi. Shaina had made a will stating the property would go to a trust if she and Kunal died. Karan Seth was paid by Ramola Sikand to prove that Shaina was Maansi, so that the will was nullified. Karan wanted Maansi's property that she had left to Baba. He kills Baba and proves Kunal guilty of it. Kunal realizes that Shaina is truthful and is not Maansi. Shaina plays Maansi's role to trap Karan and Ramola and to save Kunal. She creates misunderstandings between Karan and Ramola and so Kunal is saved.\n\n'''Kunal and Shaina Jailed'''<br />\nRamola brings her criminal brother Ratan and sets up Shaina and Kunal. They are sent to jail for fraud. Kuljeet helps Kunal and Shaina escape from jail and tries to find a way to prove them innocent. Ramola tries her best to find them and hand them over to the police but she fails. Eventually, she finds them hiding in a farmhouse. She sets the farmhouse on fire. Everyone thinks Kunal and Shaina are dead but they have survived and they start haunting Ramola, pretending to ghosts. Ramola gets mentally disturbed and is admitted to a mental asylum.\n\n'''The Revenge'''<br />\nWhen everything is revealed about Ramola and things begin to settle, Dhananjay(DJ) and his family enter their lives. Years ago Ramola cheated DJ of his inheritance of Sikand property and he is back to take revenge on Ramola. DJ tries to shoot Ramola, but by mistake the bullet hits his own daughter, Devika. DJ and his wife Avanti gets frustrated so they decide to kill the whole Sikand family by planting a bomb. Nakul and Sunidhi dies in the blast and Ramola and Shaina vow revenge on DJ. It is only four years later that DJ finds Kunal still alive. DJ goes after him and creates a lot of destruction in the Sikands' lives. Ramola and Shaina come together to defeat DJ. The Sikands use the alias of Sengupta. Each of them is given their new identity for security purposes. After a long war, Ramola and Shaina succeeds in killing DJ. As DJ takes his last breath, he shoots Ramola in the back. This leaves her paralyzed and she is confined to a wheel chair.\n\n'''Destruction'''<br />\nKunal and Shaina are finally convinced that Ramola has changed and is no longer evil. The cold war between Shaina and Nisha begins due to the lack of money in the family account. Somebody tries to kill Shaina, so she blames Anish and Nisha for all mishaps that happened with her. A witch appears everyday and threatens Shaina, new shadows appear and scare her. Shaina insults Anish and Nisha everyday and Kunal gets angry with all the family problems and somebody tries to prove Shaina is mentally ill. Somebody shoots Anish and he goes into coma and Shaina is blamed for that and is jailed. Ramola helps Shaina to escape from jail but in a twist it is revealed that Ramola was behind all the incidents that happened with Shaina. The bullet that hit Anish was meant for Shaina but Anish saw the hitman and in order to protect Shaina he got shot himself. Since Anish is in coma he is unable to reveal anything. Shaina eventually realizes that it was all along Ramola's doing. Nisha is revealed to be under Ramola's influence in plotting against Shaina. Once Anish recovered, Nisha tricked Anish to give statement against Shaina, hence Shaina goes to jail.\n\nRamola then creates a false affair between Vikram and Shaina to destroy Kunal's faith on Shaina. Kunal misunderstands Shaina and cannot hold himself anymore. Since Nisha was helping Ramola in all the crimes against Shaina, Ramola shot Nisha and falsely framed Shaina for Nisha's murder.\n\nRamola brings Shalini into the picture to win all hearts in the family and marry Kunal. When she fails, Shalini undergoes plastic surgery and gets Sunaina's (Shaina's previous) face. Shaina fails in all her steps to defeat Ramola. Kuljeet and Daiji returned to help Shaina fight against Ramola Sikand, however, Ramola kills Kuljeet and makes Shaina believe that Kunal was the murderer. Kuljeet becomes paralyzed and Shaina decides to destroy Sikand family. Aditi and Adtiya (children of Kunal and Shaina) helped Shaina to take over Sikand property and enters the Sikand house. \n\nA battle ensues among Shaina (real Sunaina), Shalini (fake Sunaina) and Ramola which results in the death of remaining family members - Anish, Avantika and Shalini (fake Sunaina). Finally Ramola succeeds in killing Shaina and Kunal along with their two children. Thus Ramola is left alone, with almost her entire family dead. The only survivors of the family besides Ramola are Nirupa, Anish and Nisha's daughter, Nisha's mother and two children of Ratan (whom Ramola adopts).\n\n'''The Next Generation'''<br />\nFor the next 20 years Ramola lives a peaceful life raising Ratan's children Rashi and Apoorva as her own. Shaina Sikand is re-incarnated as Devika who lives with her father and aunt. She has always had nightmares of someone trying to kill her. When Ramola comes to know about Devika she is shocked to see the same face but Devika does not remember anything of her past life. Kunal Sikand is re-incarnated as Nikhil who is born into a poor family. In the temple Devika sees Nikhil and faints. She is taken to a hospital but Nikhil takes her from there to their old farm house. Devika wakes up and remembers everything. Nikhil and Devika decide to marry. At the farmhouse Devika is alone as Nikhil is out. Devika sees a red cloth on a tree and as she goes to take it she finds Ramola's brother Ratan on top of the tree. He throws kerosene on her and burns her alive. After Devika's death Nikhil seeks revenge from Ramola and he takes over as company manager of the Sikand group of industries.

After marriage the entire family, including Shaina, is haunted by the spirit of a woman who usually leaves a red cloth around. The spirit is revealed to be of Kunal's ex-wife Sunaina, who died mysteriously 4 years ago. In a twist, it is revealed that Shaina is in fact Sunaina, who had plastic surgery. She married Kunal to take revenge as she thinks he tried to kill her. Kunal is then revealed to have been innocent all along. It was in fact her mother-in-law, Ramola Sikand, who tried to kill Sunaina. Thus a cold war begins between Ramola and Shaina.\n\nKunal's stepbrother Anish, who is Ramola's son, is married to Nisha and is cold towards Shaina. Kunal's youngest stepbrother Nakul is engaged to Surbhi. She commits suicide after finding out about her pregnancy and Nakul leaves the country. Natasha, Avantika and Malvika are the Sikand daughters and sisters of Kunal, Anish and Nakul. Aman got engaged with Natasha Sikand, however due to mismatch of both of their Kundali, Aman broke the engagement, eventually Natasha marries Akash. Avantika and Malvika get married to Aman's brothers and move out of Sikand household. Nakul eventually returns and marries Sunidhi. \n\nShaina digs out Ramola's past life and finds Kunal's real mother is actually Nirupa. She is in an asylum. Ramola gave drugs (Kairoxin) to make Nirupa mentally ill and then tricked Kunal's father into marrying her to get his entire property. Shaina brings Nirupa home and starts taking care of her and makes her well but frustrates Ramola in the process. Ramola decides to take revenge and tries to shoot Shaina in the temple after which Ramola's true face is revealed to Kunal. Kunal decides to replace Ramola Sikand and take all their ownership of Sikand group of companies. Ramola kills Kunal by pushing a breakfree car towards him. Ramola brings Kunal's look-alike, Kuljeet, from Haryana to replace Kunal in the Sikand household and the business. Kunal, who has managed to survive, loses his memory and ends up joining a criminal organisation renaming himself Shaan. Shaan and his cohorts find Kuljeet in a temple and kidnap him so that Shaan can enter the Sikand household. Kunal enters the Sikand family and gradually regains his memory and joins forces with Shaina to destroy Ramola. \nKuljeet was deeply in love with Sikand family, especially Shaina, so he tried his best to prove Kunal wrong. Finally Kunal proves that he is the real Kunal and Kuljeet returns to Haryana. Ramola and Kunal compromise by hiding each other's sins, Ramola trying to kill Kunal and Kunal being Shaan, a Criminal.\n\n'''Maansi - Transition of Sunaina to Shaina Anisha'''<br />\nKaran Seth enters the Sikand Household and claims Shaina is actually Maansi. The fact is, when Sunaina was burnt, she lived with her burnt face for one year and then met Maansi. They were traveling together and met an accident. Maansi was killed in the accident, and mistakenly Sunaina's face was changed to Sankirti's face, the present face of Anisha Shaina. Kunal loses his faith on Shaina and he believes she is Maansi. Shaina had made a will stating the property would go to a trust if she and Kunal died. Karan Seth was paid by Ramola Sikand to prove that Shaina was Maansi, so that the will was nullified. Karan wanted Maansi's property that she had left to Baba. He kills Baba and proves Kunal guilty of it. Kunal realizes that Shaina is truthful and is not Maansi. Shaina plays Maansi's role to trap Karan and Ramola and to save Kunal. She creates misunderstandings between Karan and Ramola and so Kunal is saved.\n\n'''Kunal and Shaina Jailed'''<br />\nRamola brings her criminal brother Ratan and sets up Shaina and Kunal. They are sent to jail for fraud. Kuljeet helps Kunal and Shaina escape from jail and tries to find a way to prove them innocent. Ramola tries her best to find them and hand them over to the police but she fails. Eventually, she finds them hiding in a farmhouse. She sets the farmhouse on fire. Everyone thinks Kunal and Shaina are dead but they have survived and they start haunting Ramola, pretending to ghosts. Ramola gets mentally disturbed and is admitted to a mental asylum.\n\n'''The Revenge'''<br />\nWhen everything is revealed about Ramola and things begin to settle, Dhananjay(DJ) and his family enter their lives. Years ago Ramola cheated DJ of his inheritance of Sikand property and he is back to take revenge on Ramola. DJ tries to shoot Ramola, but by mistake the bullet hits his own daughter, Devika. DJ and his wife Avanti gets frustrated so they decide to kill the whole Sikand family by planting a bomb. Nakul and Sunidhi dies in the blast and Ramola and Shaina vow revenge on DJ. It is only four years later that DJ finds Kunal still alive. DJ goes after him and creates a lot of destruction in the Sikands' lives. Ramola and Shaina come together to defeat DJ. The Sikands use the alias of Sengupta. Each of them is given their new identity for security purposes. After a long war, Ramola and Shaina succeeds in killing DJ. As DJ takes his last breath, he shoots Ramola in the back. This leaves her paralyzed and she is confined to a wheel chair.\n\n'''Destruction'''<br />\nKunal and Shaina are finally convinced that Ramola has changed and is no longer evil. The cold war between Shaina and Nisha begins due to the lack of money in the family account. Somebody tries to kill Shaina, so she blames Anish and Nisha for all mishaps that happened with her. A witch appears everyday and threatens Shaina, new shadows appear and scare her. Shaina insults Anish and Nisha everyday and Kunal gets angry with all the family problems and somebody tries to prove Shaina is mentally ill. Somebody shoots Anish and he goes into coma and Shaina is blamed for that and is jailed. Ramola helps Shaina to escape from jail but in a twist it is revealed that Ramola was behind all the incidents that happened with Shaina. The bullet that hit Anish was meant for Shaina but Anish saw the hitman and in order to protect Shaina he got shot himself. Since Anish is in coma he is unable to reveal anything. Shaina eventually realizes that it was all along Ramola's doing. Nisha is revealed to be under Ramola's influence in plotting against Shaina. Once Anish recovered, Nisha tricked Anish to give statement against Shaina, hence Shaina goes to jail.\n\nRamola then creates a false affair between Vikram and Shaina to destroy Kunal's faith on Shaina. Kunal misunderstands Shaina and cannot hold himself anymore. Since Nisha was helping Ramola in all the crimes against Shaina, Ramola shot Nisha and falsely framed Shaina for Nisha's murder.\n\nRamola brings Shalini into the picture to win all hearts in the family and marry Kunal. When she fails, Shalini undergoes plastic surgery and gets Sunaina's (Shaina's previous) face. Shaina fails in all her steps to defeat Ramola. Kuljeet and Daiji returned to help Shaina fight against Ramola Sikand, however, Ramola kills Kuljeet and makes Shaina believe that Kunal was the murderer. Kuljeet becomes paralyzed and Shaina decides to destroy Sikand family. Aditi and Adtiya (children of Kunal and Shaina) helped Shaina to take over Sikand property and enters the Sikand house. \n\nA battle ensues among Shaina (real Sunaina), Shalini (fake Sunaina) and Ramola which results in the death of remaining family members - Anish, Avantika and Shalini (fake Sunaina). Finally Ramola succeeds in killing Shaina and Kunal along with their two children. Thus Ramola is left alone, with almost her entire family dead. The only survivors of the family besides Ramola are Nirupa, Anish and Nisha's daughter, Nisha's mother and two children of Ratan (whom Ramola adopts).\n\n'''The Next Generation'''<br />\nFor the next 20 years Ramola lives a peaceful life raising Ratan's children Rashi and Apoorva as her own. Shaina Sikand is re-incarnated as Devika who lives with her father and aunt. She has always had nightmares of someone trying to kill her. When Ramola comes to know about Devika she is shocked to see the same face but Devika does not remember anything of her past life. Kunal Sikand is re-incarnated as Nikhil who is born into a poor family. In the temple Devika sees Nikhil and faints. She is taken to a hospital but Nikhil takes her from there to their old farm house. Devika wakes up and remembers everything. Nikhil and Devika decide to get married. At the farmhouse Devika is alone as Nikhil is out. Devika sees a red cloth on a tree and as she goes to take it she finds Ramola's brother Ratan on top of the tree. He throws kerosene on her and burns her alive. After Devika's death Nikhil seeks revenge from Ramola and he takes over as company manager of the Sikand group of industries.
