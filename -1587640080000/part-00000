Affected nations send military and scientific experts to monitor and study them; in the United States, US Army Colonel G.T. Weber recruits Banks and physicist Ian Donnely to study the craft above Montana. On board, Banks and Donnelly make contact with two seven-limbed aliens, whom they call heptpods; Donnely nicknames them [[Abbott and Costello]]. They both begin researching the complex written language of the aliens, made of [[palindrome]] phrases written with [[Longogram|circular symbols]], and share results with other nations. As Banks studies the language, she starts to have flashback-like visions of her daughter.\n\nWhen Banks is able to establish sufficient shared vocabulary to ask why the aliens have come, they answer with a statement which could be translated as \"offer weapon\". China interprets this as \"use weapon\", prompting it to break off communications, and other nations follow. Banks argues that the symbol interpreted as \"weapon\" can be more abstractly referred to the concept of \"means\", \"tool\"; China's translation likely results from interacting with the aliens using [[mahjong]], a highly competitive winner-take-all game.\n\nRogue soldiers put a bomb on the Montana grass'''Bold text'''. Unaware, Banks and Donnelly re-enter the alien vessel, and the aliens give them an extremely complex message. Just before the bomb explodes, one of the aliens ejects Donnelly and Banks, knocking them unconscious. When they reawaken, the military is preparing to evacuate in case of retaliation, and the craft has moved out of reach.\n\nDonnelly discovers that the symbol for time is present throughout the message, and that the writing occupies exactly one twelfth of the 3D space in which it is projected. Banks suggests that the full message is split among the twelve craft, and the aliens want all the nations to share what they learn.\n\nChina's General Shang issues an ultimatum to his local alien craft, demanding that it leave China within 24 hours. Russia, Pakistan and Sudan follow suit. Communications between the international research teams are terminated as worldwide panic sets in.\n\nBanks goes alone to the craft, and it sends down a transport pod. Abbott is dying from the explosion; Costello explains that they have come to help humanity, for in 3,000 years they will need humanity's help in return. Banks realises the \"weapon\" is their language, which changes humans' linear perception of time, allowing them to experience [[flashforward|\"memories\" of future events]]. Banks's visions of her daughter, Hannah (whose name is a palindrome itself), are revealed to actually be premonitions; her daughter will not be born until some time in the future.\n\nBanks returns to the camp as it is being evacuated and tells Donnelly that the alien language itself is the \"tool\". Reflecting the [[Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis]] of how language shapes perception, those who master the language are able to perceive the future and past. She has a premonition of a United Nations event celebrating newfound unity following the alien arrival, in which Shang thanks her for having convinced him to call off the attack by calling his private number and reciting his wife's dying words: \"War doesn't make winners, only widows.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=https://www.scriptslug.com/assets/uploads/scripts/arrival-2016.pdf |title=Arrival Screenplay |last=Heisserer |first=Eric |date=20 August 2015 |website=Script Slug |page=125 |access-date=28 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190928184436/https://www.scriptslug.com/assets/uploads/scripts/arrival-2016.pdf |archive-date=September 28, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the present, Banks steals CIA agent Halpern's satellite phone, a rarity when phones have been confiscated on the base, and calls Shang's number to recite the words. The Chinese announce that they are standing down and release their twelfth piece of the message. The other countries follow suit, and the twelve craft depart.\n\nDuring the evacuation of the camp, Donnelly expresses his love for Banks. They talk about life choices and whether he would change them if he could see the future. Banks knows that she will agree to have a child with him despite knowing their fate: that Hannah will die, and Donnelly will leave them after she reveals that she knew this.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Amy Adams]] as Louise Banks\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as Ian Donnelly\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as Colonel G.

Affected nations send military and scientific experts to monitor and study them; in the United States, US Army Colonel G.T. Weber recruits Banks and physicist Ian Donnelly to study the craft above Montana. On board, Banks and Donnelly make contact with two seven-limbed aliens, whom they call heptapods; Donnelly nicknames them [[Abbott and Costello]]. They both begin researching the complex written language of the aliens, made of [[palindrome]] phrases written with [[Logogram|circular symbols]], and share results with other nations. As Banks studies the language, she starts to have flashback-like visions of her daughter.\n\nWhen Banks is able to establish sufficient shared vocabulary to ask why the aliens have come, they answer with a statement which could be translated as \"offer weapon\". China interprets this as \"use weapon\", prompting it to break off communications, and other nations follow. Banks argues that the symbol interpreted as \"weapon\" can be more abstractly referred to the concept of \"means\", \"tool\"; China's translation likely results from interacting with the aliens using [[mahjong]], a highly competitive winner-take-all game.\n\nRogue soldiers plant a bomb in the Montana craft. Unaware, Banks and Donnelly re-enter the alien vessel, and the aliens give them an extremely complex message. Just before the bomb explodes, one of the aliens ejects Donnelly and Banks, knocking them unconscious. When they reawaken, the military is preparing to evacuate in case of retaliation, and the craft has moved out of reach.\n\nDonnelly discovers that the symbol for time is present throughout the message, and that the writing occupies exactly one twelfth of the 3D space in which it is projected. Banks suggests that the full message is split among the twelve craft, and the aliens want all the nations to share what they learn.\n\nChina's General Shang issues an ultimatum to his local alien craft, demanding that it leave China within 24 hours. Russia, Pakistan and Sudan follow suit. Communications between the international research teams are terminated as worldwide panic sets in.\n\nBanks goes alone to the craft, and it sends down a transport pod. Abbott is dying from the explosion; Costello explains that they have come to help humanity, for in 3,000 years they will need humanity's help in return. Banks realises the \"weapon\" is their language, which changes humans' linear perception of time, allowing them to experience [[flashforward|\"memories\" of future events]]. Banks's visions of her daughter, Hannah (whose name is a palindrome itself), are revealed to actually be premonitions; her daughter will not be born until some time in the future.\n\nBanks returns to the camp as it is being evacuated and tells Donnelly that the alien language itself is the \"tool\". Reflecting the [[Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis]] of how language shapes perception, those who master the language are able to perceive the future and past. She has a premonition of a United Nations event celebrating newfound unity following the alien arrival, in which Shang thanks her for having convinced him to call off the attack by calling his private number and reciting his wife's dying words: \"War doesn't make winners, only widows.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=https://www.scriptslug.com/assets/uploads/scripts/arrival-2016.pdf |title=Arrival Screenplay |last=Heisserer |first=Eric |date=20 August 2015 |website=Script Slug |page=125 |access-date=28 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190928184436/https://www.scriptslug.com/assets/uploads/scripts/arrival-2016.pdf |archive-date=September 28, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the present, Banks steals CIA agent Halpern's satellite phone, a rarity when phones have been confiscated on the base, and calls Shang's number to recite the words. The Chinese announce that they are standing down and release their twelfth piece of the message. The other countries follow suit, and the twelve craft depart.\n\nDuring the evacuation of the camp, Donnelly expresses his love for Banks. They talk about life choices and whether he would change them if he could see the future. Banks knows that she will agree to have a child with him despite knowing their fate: that Hannah will die, and Donnelly will leave them after she reveals that she knew this.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Amy Adams]] as Louise Banks\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as Ian Donnelly\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as Colonel G.
