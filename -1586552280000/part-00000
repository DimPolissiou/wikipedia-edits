Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death.

Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking.

Benefits for helpers include a reduced chance of predation, increased foraging time, territory inheritance, increased environmental conditions and an inclusive fitness. Inclusive fitness is the sum of all direct and indirect fitness, where direct fitness is defined as the amount of fitness gained through producing offspring. Indirect fitness is defined as the amount of fitness gained through aiding related individuals offspring, that is relatives are able to indirectly pass on their genes through increasing the fitness of related offspring.<ref name=\"Davies\">Nicholas B. Davies, John R. Krebs, S. A. W. An Introduction to Behavioural Ecology.pdf. 522 (2012).</ref> This is also called kin selection.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=Evolutionary explanations for cooperation|last=West|first=Stuart|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.06.004|pmid=17714660|volume=17|issue=16|year=2007|journal=Current Biology|pages=R661\u2013R672}}</ref>\n\nFor the breeding pair, costs include increased [[mate guarding]] and suppression of subordinate mating. Breeders receive benefits as reductions in offspring care and territory maintenance. Their primary benefit is an increased reproductive rate and survival.\n\nCooperative breeding causes the reproductive success of all sexually mature adults to be skewed towards one mating pair. This means the [[reproductive fitness]] of the group is held within a select few breeding members and helpers have little to no reproductive fitness.<ref name=\"Bartmann\" /> With this system, breeders gain an increased reproductive fitness, while helpers gain an increased inclusive fitness.<ref name=\"Bartmann\">{{cite journal | last1 = Gerlach | first1 = G. | last2 = Bartmann | first2 = S. | year = 1998 | title = Reproductive skew, costs, and benefits of cooperative breeding in female wood mice ( Apodemus sylvaticus ) | url = | journal = | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 408\u2013418 }}</ref>\n\n==Evolution==\n\nMany hypotheses have been presented to explain the [[evolution]] of cooperative breeding. The concept behind cooperative breeding is the forfeiting of an individual's reproductive fitness to aid the reproductive success of others. This concept is hard to understand and the evolution of cooperative breeding is important, but difficult to explain. Most hypotheses aim to determine the reason helpers selectively reduce their fitness and take on an alloparental role.\n\n[[Kin selection]] is the evolutionary strategy of aiding the reproductive success of related organisms, even at a cost to the own individual's direct fitness. Hamilton's rule (rB\u2212C>0) explains that kin selection will exist if the genetic relatedness (r) of the aided recipient to the aiding individual, times the benefit to the aid recipient (B) is greater than the cost to the aiding individual(C).<ref name=\"Davies\" /> For example, the [[chestnut-crowned babbler]] (''Pomatostomus ruficeps'') has been found to have high rates of kin selection. Helpers are predominantly found aiding closely related broods over nonrelated broods.<ref name=\"Browning\" /> Additional species such as ''[[Neolamprologus pulcher]]'' have shown that kin selection is a dominant driving force for cooperative breeding.<ref name=\"Browning\">{{cite journal | last1 = Browning | first1 = L.

The model is based on the evolution of larger litters forcing the need for helpers to maintain the high reproductive costs, thus leading to cooperative breeding. Lukas et al. suggests polytocy may have encouraged the evolution of cooperative breeding. Their proposed model suggests the transition from monotocy to polytocy is favorable. Additionally, they found the transition from polytocy without cooperative breeding to polytocy with cooperative breeding is highly favorable. This suggests cooperative breeding evolved from noncooperative breeding monotocy to cooperative breeding polytocy.<ref name=\"Lukas 2012\" />\n\nToday, there is growing support for the theory that cooperative breeding evolved by means of some form of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] or [[Reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocity]].  Mutualism is a form of symbiosis that is beneficial to both involved organisms.  Mutualism has many forms and can occur when the benefits are immediate or deferred, when individuals exchange beneficial behaviors in turn, or when a group of individuals contribute to a common good, where it may be advantageous for all group members to help raise young.  When a group raises young together, it may be advantageous because it maintains or increases the size of the group.<ref name=\"Clutton-Brock Science\" />  The greatest amount of research has been invested in reciprocal exchanges of beneficial behavior through the [[iterated prisoner's dilemma]].  In this model, two partners can either cooperate and exchange beneficial behavior or they can defect and refuse to help the other individual.<ref name=\"Clutton-Brock Science\">{{cite journal|last=Clutton-Brock|first=Tim|title=Breeding Together: Kin Selection and Mutualism in Cooperative Vertebrates|journal=Science|year=2002|volume=296|issue=5565|pages=69\u201372|doi=10.1126/science.296.5565.69|pmid=11935014|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6c6b6531bd56c2e39cf874af42bd1c12c46224a9}}</ref>\n\n==Environmental conditions==\n\nEnvironmental conditions govern whether offspring disperse from their natal group or remain as helpers. Food or territory availability can encourage individuals to disperse and establish new breeding territories, but unfavorable conditions promote offspring to remain at the natal territory and become helpers to obtain an inclusive fitness.<ref name=\"Marino\">{{cite journal | last1 = Marino | first1 = J. | last2 = Sillero-Zubiri | first2 = C. | last3 = Johnson | first3 = P.

Sexual dispersal is the movement of one sex, male or female, from the natal territory to establish new breeding grounds. This is highly regulated by the reproductive costs in producing a male versus a female offspring. Maternal investment within female offspring may be considerably higher than male offspring for one species, or vice versa for another. During unfavorable conditions the cheaper sex will be produced at higher ratios.<ref name=\"Sharp\">{{cite journal | last1 = Sharp | first1 = S.

Carrion crow ([[Carrion crow|''Corvus corone'']]) were found to produce more female offspring in favorable environmental conditions. Female ''Corvus corone'' have been found to establish successful breeding territories at a higher rate than males. Male ''Corvus corone'' were produced at a higher rate under unfavorable conditions.

If environmental conditions are unfavorable females may produce the philopatric sex, therefore generating more helpers and increasing the occurrence of cooperative breeding.<ref name=\"Vila\" />\n\n==Costs==\n\n===Breeders===\n\nBreeder costs consist of prenatal care, postnatal care and maintenance of breeding status. Prenatal care is the amount of maternal investment during fetus gestation and postnatal care is the investment following birth. Examples of prenatal care are fetal, placentae, uterus and mammary tissue development. Postnatal examples are lactation, food provisions and guarding behavior.<ref name=\"Sharp\" />\n\nDominant males and females exhibit suppressive behaviors towards subordinates to maintain their breeding status. These suppressive acts are dependent upon the sex ratio of helpers. Therefore, the costs will be altered depending upon the helpers. For example, if there are more male helpers as compared to females, then the dominant male will suppress subordinate males and experience a higher cost. The opposite is true for females. Breeders will even suppress subordinates from mating with other subordinates.<ref name=\"Mitchell 2009\">{{cite journal | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = J.

The act of helping requires an allocation of energy towards actually performing the behavior. Prolonged allocation of energy may greatly impact a helper's growth.<ref name=\"Hodge\" /> In banded mongoose ([[Banded mongoose|''Mungos mungo'']]) juvenile male helpers contribute far less than females. This is due to a difference in the age of sexual maturity.<ref name=\"Hodge\" /> Female banded mongooses reach sexual maturity at one year of age, but males reach sexual maturity at two years of age. The difference in age causes the prolonged energy allocation to be detrimental to a specific sex.<ref name=\"Hodge\" />\n\nMale juvenile ''Mungos mungo'' may reduce helping behaviors until sexual maturity is reached. Similarly, if there is a lack of food due to environmental conditions, such as reduced rainfall, the degree of helper input may be reduced greatly within juveniles. Adults may maintain their full activity because they are sexually mature.<ref name=\"Nichols 2012\" />\n\nAdditionally, the costs of being a helper can be more detrimental to one sex. For example, territorial defense costs are generally male dependent and lactation is female dependent. Meerkats ([[Meerkat|''Suricata suricatta'']]) have exhibited male territory defense strategies, where male helpers will fend off intruding males to prevent such intruders from mating with subordinates or dominant females.<ref name=\"Pauw\">{{cite journal | last1 = Pauw | first1 = A | year = 2000 | title = Parental care in a polygynous group of bat-eared foxes, Otocyon megalotis ( Carnivora : Canidae ) | url = | journal = African Zoology | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 139\u2013145 | doi=10.1080/15627020.2000.11407200}}</ref> Additionally, subordinate female pregnant helpers are sometimes exiled from the group by a dominant female.

The concept behind cooperative breeding is the forfeiting of an individual's reproductive fitness to aid the reproductive success of others. This concept is hard to understand and the evolution of cooperative breeding is important, but difficult to explain. Most hypotheses aim to determine the reason helpers selectively reduce their fitness and take on an alloparental role.\n\n[[Kin selection]] is the evolutionary strategy of aiding the reproductive success of related organisms, even at a cost to the own individual's direct fitness. Hamilton's rule (rB\u2212C>0) explains that kin selection will exist if the genetic relatedness (r) of the aided recipient to the aiding individual, times the benefit to the aid recipient (B) is greater than the cost to the aiding individual(C).<ref name=\"Davies\" /> For example, the [[chestnut-crowned babbler]] (''Pomatostomus ruficeps'') has been found to have high rates of kin selection. Helpers are predominantly found aiding closely related broods over nonrelated broods.<ref name=\"Browning\" /> Additional species such as ''[[Neolamprologus pulcher]]'' have shown that kin selection is a dominant driving force for cooperative breeding.<ref name=\"Browning\">{{cite journal | last1 = Browning | first1 = L.

The model is based on the evolution of larger litters forcing the need for helpers to maintain the high reproductive costs, thus leading to cooperative breeding. Lukas et al. suggests polytocy may have encouraged the evolution of cooperative breeding. Their proposed model suggests the transition from monotocy to polytocy is favorable. Additionally, they found the transition from polytocy without cooperative breeding to polytocy with cooperative breeding is highly favorable. This suggests cooperative breeding evolved from noncooperative breeding monotocy to cooperative breeding polytocy.<ref name=\"Lukas 2012\" />\n\nToday, there is growing support for the theory that cooperative breeding evolved by means of some form of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] or [[Reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocity]].  Mutualism is a form of symbiosis that is beneficial to both involved organisms.  Mutualism has many forms and can occur when the benefits are immediate or deferred, when individuals exchange beneficial behaviors in turn, or when a group of individuals contribute to a common good, where it may be advantageous for all group members to help raise young.  When a group raises young together, it may be advantageous because it maintains or increases the size of the group.<ref name=\"Clutton-Brock Science\" />  The greatest amount of research has been invested in reciprocal exchanges of beneficial behavior through the [[iterated prisoner's dilemma]].  In this model, two partners can either cooperate and exchange beneficial behavior or they can defect and refuse to help the other individual.<ref name=\"Clutton-Brock Science\">{{cite journal|last=Clutton-Brock|first=Tim|title=Breeding Together: Kin Selection and Mutualism in Cooperative Vertebrates|journal=Science|year=2002|volume=296|issue=5565|pages=69\u201372|doi=10.1126/science.296.5565.69|pmid=11935014|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6c6b6531bd56c2e39cf874af42bd1c12c46224a9}}</ref>\n\n==Environmental conditions==\n\nEnvironmental conditions govern whether offspring disperse from their natal group or remain as helpers.

Sexual dispersal is the movement of one sex, male or female, from the natal territory to establish new breeding grounds. This is highly regulated by the reproductive costs in producing a male versus a female offspring. Maternal investment within female offspring may be considerably higher than male offspring for one species, or vice versa for another. During unfavorable conditions the cheaper sex will be produced at higher ratios.<ref name=\"Sharp\">{{cite journal | last1 = Sharp | first1 = S.

Carrion crow ([[Carrion crow|''Corvus corone'']]) were found to produce more female offspring in favorable environmental conditions.

If environmental conditions are unfavorable females may produce the philopatric sex, therefore generating more helpers and increasing the occurrence of cooperative breeding.<ref name=\"Vila\" />\n\n==Costs==\n\n===Breeders===\n\nBreeder costs consist of prenatal care, postnatal care and maintenance of breeding status. Prenatal care is the amount of maternal investment during fetus gestation and postnatal care is the investment following birth. Examples of prenatal care are fetal, placentae, uterus and mammary tissue development. Postnatal examples are lactation, food provisions and guarding behavior.<ref name=\"Sharp\" />\n\nDominant males and females exhibit suppressive behaviors towards subordinates to maintain their breeding status. These suppressive acts are dependent upon the sex ratio of helpers. Therefore, the costs will be altered depending upon the helpers. For example, if there are more male helpers as compared to females, then the dominant male will suppress subordinate males and experience a higher cost. The opposite is true for females. Breeders will even suppress subordinates from mating with other subordinates.<ref name=\"Mitchell 2009\">{{cite journal | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = J.

The act of helping requires an allocation of energy towards actually performing the behavior. Prolonged allocation of energy may greatly impact a helper's growth.<ref name=\"Hodge\" /> In banded mongoose ([[Banded mongoose|''Mungos mungo'']]) juvenile male helpers contribute far less than females. This is due to a difference in the age of sexual maturity.<ref name=\"Hodge\" /> Female banded mongooses reach sexual maturity at one year of age, but males reach sexual maturity at two years of age. The difference in age causes the prolonged energy allocation to be detrimental to a specific sex.<ref name=\"Hodge\" />\n\nMale juvenile ''Mungos mungo'' may reduce helping behaviors until sexual maturity is reached. Similarly, if there is a lack of food due to environmental conditions, such as reduced rainfall, the degree of helper input may be reduced greatly within juveniles. Adults may maintain their full activity because they are sexually mature.<ref name=\"Nichols 2012\" />\n\nAdditionally, the costs of being a helper can be more detrimental to one sex. For example, territorial defense costs are generally male dependent and lactation is female dependent. Meerkats ([[Meerkat|''Suricata suricatta'']]) have exhibited male territory defense strategies, where male helpers will fend off intruding males to prevent such intruders from mating with subordinates or dominant females.<ref name=\"Pauw\">{{cite journal | last1 = Pauw | first1 = A | year = 2000 | title = Parental care in a polygynous group of bat-eared foxes, Otocyon megalotis ( Carnivora : Canidae ) | url = | journal = African Zoology | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 139\u2013145 | doi=10.1080/15627020.2000.11407200}}</ref> Additionally, subordinate female pregnant helpers are sometimes exiled from the group by a dominant female.

The dominant female and male will adjust their care input, or food provisioning, depending on the degree of activity of the helpers.<ref name=\"Nichols 2012\" />\n\nThe presence of helpers allows the breeding female to reduce her prenatal investment in the offspring, which may lead to [[altricial]] births; altricial is the production of young which are dependent upon adult aid to survive.
