Jos]''' {{IPAc-en|'|d\u0292|o\u02d0|s}} is a city in the [[Middle Belt]] of [[Nigeria]]. The city has a population of about 900,000 residents based on the 2006 census.<ref name=\"nigerianstat.gov.ng\"/> Popularly called \"'''J-Town'''\", it is the administrative capital and largest city of [[Plateau State]].\n\nThe city is located on the [[Jos Plateau]] at about {{convert|1238|m|ft|0|disp=or}} above sea level. During [[British Empire|British]] [[Colonialism|colonial rule]], Jos was an important centre for [[Tin|tin mining]] and is the trading hub of the state as commercial activities are steadily increasing.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest known settlers of the land that would come to be known as Nigeria were the [[Nok culture|Nok people]] (circa 1000&nbsp;BC), skilled artisans from around the Jos area who mysteriously vanished in the late first millennium.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-62-74.jpg|thumb|left|Early British settlement in Jos, 1905]]\nAccording to the historian Sen Luka Gwom Zangabadt,<ref>History of Jos and political development of Nigeria; Sen Luka Gwom Zangabadt</ref> the area known as Jos today was inhabited by [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[ethnic groups of Nigeria|ethnic groups]] who were mostly farmers. According to Billy J. Dudley,<ref>Billy J. Dudley. Parties and politics in Northern Nigeria</ref> the British colonialists used direct rule for the indigenous ethnic groups on the Jos Plateau since they were not under the [[Fulani]] [[emirate]]s where indirect rule was used. According to the historian Samuel N Nwabara,<ref>Samuel N Nwabara; The Fulani conquest and the rule of the Hausa kingdom of Northern  Nigeria (1804\u20131900){{Page needed|date=May 2014}}</ref> the [[Fula people|Fulani]] empire controlled most of [[northern Nigeria]], except the Plateau province and the [[Berom people|Berom]], [[Mwaghavul language|Mwaghavul]], [[Ngas language|Ngas]], [[Tiv people|Tiv]], [[Jukun people (West Africa)|Jukun]] and [[Idoma people|Idoma]] ethnic groups. It was the discovery of [[tin]] by the British that led to the influx of other ethnic groups such as the [[Hausa\u2013Fulani|Hausa]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], thus making Jos a cosmopolitan city.\n\nAccording to the white paper of the commission of inquiry into the 1994 crisis, Ames, a British colonial administrator, said that the original name for Jos was Gwosh which was a village situated at the current site of the city; according to Ames, the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] wrongly pronounced Gwosh as Jos and it stuck.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.petitiononline.com|title=Petition Online - Petition Online has been retired|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref> Another version was that \"Jos\" came from the word \"Jasad\" meaning body. To distinguish it from the hill tops, it was called \"Jas\", which was mis-pronounced by the British as \"Jos\". It grew rapidly after the British discovered vast [[tin]] deposits in the vicinity. Both tin and [[columbite]] were extensively mined in the area up until the 1960s. They were transported by railway to both [[Port Harcourt]] and [[Lagos]] on the coast, then exported from those ports. Jos is still often referred to as \"Tin City\". It was made capital of [[Benue-Plateau State]] in 1967, and became the capital of the new Plateau State in 1975.\n[[File:CENTRAL MOSQUE JOS NIGERIA - panoramio.jpg|left|thumb|Jos Central Mosque]]\n[[File:Gunshot victim and mother.jpg|thumb|A hospitalized gunshot victim (left) from the 2001 Jos Riots]]\nJos has become an important national administrative, commercial, and tourist centre. Tin mining has led to the influx of [[Human migration|migrant]]s (mostly Igbos, Yorubas and [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]]) who constitute more than half of the population of Jos. This \"melting pot\" of race, ethnicity and religion makes Jos one of the most cosmopolitan cities in Nigeria. For this reason, [[Plateau State]] is known in Nigeria as the \"home of peace and tourism\". \n\n==Religious violence==\nJos is inhabited by predominantly [[Christianity in Nigeria|Christian]] communities, but clashes have occurred between [[Christians]] and [[Islam in Nigeria|Muslims]]. In September 2001, [[2001 Jos riots|riots]] occurred in Jos between the divided and Christian and [[Muslim]] populations, in which about a thousand people were killed.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/regional-publications/GD-WP-Jos-deadly-cycle.pdf|title = A Deadly Cycle of Ethno-religious violence|last = Krause|first = Jana|date = 2011|journal = Working Paper|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 18 October 2015|pages = 13|isbn = 978-2-9700771-0-7|publisher = Geneva Declaration}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/nigeria/07812.pdf|title = The Jos Crisis: A Recurrent Nigerian Tragedy|last = Higazi|first = Adam|date = January 2011|journal = Working Paper|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 19 October 2015|issue = 2|publisher = Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung|pages = 17\u201318}}</ref> In 2004, the former governor of Plateau State, [[Joshua Dariye]], was suspended for six months for failing to control the violence. \n[[File:Residential Area In Tudun Wada, Jos, Plateau State (cropped).jpg|alt=|thumb|Residential area in Jos]]\nIn [[2008 Jos riots|November 2008]] and [[2010 Jos riots|January 2010]], further riots occurred in Jos.

The city proper lies between Jos north and Jos south. Jos east houses the prestigious National Center For Remote Sensing. Jos north is the state capital and the area where most commercial activities of the state takes place, although due to the recent communal clashes a lot of commercial activities are shifting to Jos south. The Governor's office is located in an area in Jos North called \"Jise\" in Berom language, \"Gise\" in Afizere (Jarawa) language or \"Tudun-Wada\" in Hausa language. Jos south is the seat of the Deputy Governor i.e. the old Government House in Rayfield and the industrial centre of Plateau State due to the presence of industries like the NASCO group, Standard Biscuits, Grand Cereals and Oil Mills, Zuma steel west Africa, aluminium roofing industries, Jos International Breweries among others. Jos south also houses prestigious institutions like the [[National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies]] (NIPSS), the highest academic awarding institution in Nigeria, the National Veterinary Research Institute, the Police Staff College, the [[Nigerian Television Authority|NTA]] television college and the [[Nigerian Film Corporation]]. Jos north is the location of the University of Jos and its teaching hospital. The city has formed an [[urban agglomeration|agglomeration]] with the town of [[Bukuru]] to form the Jos-Bukuru metropolis (JBM).\n\n==Geography and climate==\n{{climate chart\n|Jos\n|12.7|27.3|0.4\n|15.1|28.7|2.8\n|17.7|30.4|29.8\n|18.3|30.2|92.9\n|18.0|28.2|159.8\n|17.2|26.6|198.5\n|16.7|24.4|303.8\n|16.5|24.3|290.1\n|16.7|26.1|197.6\n|16.6|27.8|38.3\n|14.9|28.0|0.3\n|13.1|27.2|0.5\n|float=right\n|clear=none\n|source=Jos, Nigeria: Climate, Global Warming, and Daylight Charts and Data <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.climate-charts.com/Locations/n/NI65134.php |title=Jos, Nigeria: Climate, Global Warming, and Daylight Charts and Data |location=Jos, Nigeria |publisher=Climate-charts.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10}}</ref>\n}}\n\nSituated almost at the geographical centre of Nigeria and about {{convert|179|km|mi|abbr=off}} from [[Abuja]], the nation's capital, Jos is linked by road, rail and air to the rest of the country.

Jos]''' {{IPAc-en|'|d\u0292|o\u02d0|s}} is a city in the [[Middle Belt]] of [[Nigeria]]. The city has a population of about 900,000 residents based on the 2006 census.<ref name=\"nigerianstat.gov.ng\"/> Popularly called \"'''J-Town'''\", it is the administrative capital and largest city of [[Plateau State]].\n\nThe city is located on the [[Jos Plateau]] at about {{convert|1238|m|ft|0|disp=or}} above sea level. During [[British Empire|British]] [[Colonialism|colonial rule]], Jos was an important centre for [[Tin|tin mining]] and is the trading hub of the state as commercial activities are steadily increasing.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest known settlers of the land that would come to be known as Nigeria were the [[Nok culture|Nok people]] (circa 1000&nbsp;BC), skilled artisans from around the Jos area who mysteriously vanished in the late first millennium.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-62-74.jpg|thumb|left|Early British settlement in Jos, 1905]]\nAccording to the historian Sen Luka Gwom Zangabadt,<ref>History of Jos and political development of Nigeria; Sen Luka Gwom Zangabadt</ref> the area known as Jos today was inhabited by [[indigenous]] [[ethnic groups of Nigeria|ethnic groups]] who were mostly farmers. According to Billy J. Dudley,<ref>Billy J. Dudley. Parties and politics in Northern Nigeria</ref> the British colonialists used direct rule for the indigenous ethnic groups on the Jos Plateau since they were not under the [[Fulani]] [[emirate]]s where indirect rule was used. According to the historian Samuel N Nwabara,<ref>Samuel N Nwabara; The Fulani conquest and the rule of the Hausa kingdom of Northern  Nigeria (1804\u20131900){{Page needed|date=May 2014}}</ref> the [[Fula people|Fulani]] empire controlled most of [[northern Nigeria]], except the Plateau province and the [[Berom people|Berom]], [[Mwaghavul language|Mwaghavul]], [[Ngas language|Ngas]], [[Tiv people|Tiv]], [[Jukun people (West Africa)|Jukun]] and [[Idoma people|Idoma]] ethnic groups. It was the discovery of [[tin]] by the British that led to the influx of other ethnic groups such as the [[Hausa\u2013Fulani|Hausa]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], thus making Jos a cosmopolitan city.\n\nAccording to the white paper of the commission of inquiry into the 1994 crisis, Ames, a British colonial administrator, said that the original name for Jos was Gwosh which was a village situated at the current site of the city; according to Ames, the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] wrongly pronounced Gwosh as Jos and it stuck.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.petitiononline.com|title=Petition Online - Petition Online has been retired|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref> Another version was that \"Jos\" came from the word \"Jasad\" meaning body. To distinguish it from the hill tops, it was called \"Jas\", which was mis-pronounced by the British as \"Jos\". It grew rapidly after the British discovered vast [[tin]] deposits in the vicinity. Both tin and [[columbite]] were extensively mined in the area up until the 1960s. They were transported by railway to both [[Port Harcourt]] and [[Lagos]] on the coast, then exported from those ports. Jos is still often referred to as \"Tin City\". It was made capital of [[Benue-Plateau State]] in 1967, and became the capital of the new Plateau State in 1975.\n[[File:CENTRAL MOSQUE JOS NIGERIA - panoramio.jpg|left|thumb|Jos Central Mosque]]\n[[File:Gunshot victim and mother.jpg|thumb|A hospitalized gunshot victim (left) from the 2001 Jos Riots]]\nJos has become an important national administrative, commercial, and tourist centre. Tin mining has led to the influx of [[Human migration|migrant]]s (mostly Igbos, Yorubas and [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]]) who constitute more than half of the population of Jos. This \"melting pot\" of race, ethnicity and religion makes Jos one of the most cosmopolitan cities in Nigeria. For this reason, [[Plateau State]] is known in Nigeria as the \"home of peace and tourism\". \n\n==Religious violence==\nJos is inhabited by predominantly [[Christianity in Nigeria|Christian]] communities, but clashes have occurred between [[Christians]] and [[Islam in Nigeria|Muslims]]. In September 2001, [[2001 Jos riots|riots]] occurred in Jos between the divided and Christian and [[Muslim]] populations, in which about a thousand people were killed.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/regional-publications/GD-WP-Jos-deadly-cycle.pdf|title = A Deadly Cycle of Ethno-religious violence|last = Krause|first = Jana|date = 2011|journal = Working Paper|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 18 October 2015|pages = 13|isbn = 978-2-9700771-0-7|publisher = Geneva Declaration}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/nigeria/07812.pdf|title = The Jos Crisis: A Recurrent Nigerian Tragedy|last = Higazi|first = Adam|date = January 2011|journal = Working Paper|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 19 October 2015|issue = 2|publisher = Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung|pages = 17\u201318}}</ref> In 2004, the former governor of Plateau State, [[Joshua Dariye]], was suspended for six months for failing to control the violence. \n[[File:Residential Area In Tudun Wada, Jos, Plateau State (cropped).jpg|alt=|thumb|Residential area in Jos]]\nIn [[2008 Jos riots|November 2008]] and [[2010 Jos riots|January 2010]], further riots occurred in Jos.

The city proper lies between Jos north and Jos south. Jos east houses the prestigious National Center For Remote Sensing. Jos north is the state capital and the area where most commercial activities of the state takes place, although due to the recent communal clashes a lot of commercial activities are shifting to Jos south. The Governor's office is located in an area in Jos North called \"Jise\" in Berom language, \"Gise\" in Afizere (Jarawa) language or \"Tudun-Wada\" in Hausa language. Jos south is the seat of the Deputy Governor i.e. the old Government House in Rayfield and the industrial centre of Plateau State due to the presence of industries like the NASCO group, Standard Biscuits, Grand Cereals and Oil Mills, Zuma steel west Africa, aluminium roofing industries, Jos International Breweries among others. Jos south also houses prestigious institutions like the [[National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies]] (NIPSS), the highest academic awarding institution in Nigeria, the National Veterinary Research Institute, the Police Staff College, the [[Nigerian Television Authority|NTA]] television college and the [[Nigerian Film Corporation]]. Jos north is the location of the University of Jos and its teaching hospital.

In response to this formidable coalition and a provocation from another general, [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]], Perdiccas invaded Egypt, but when the invasion floundered his soldiers revolted and killed him.\n\n==Family background==\nAccording to [[Arrian]], Perdiccas was a son of the Macedonian nobleman, Orontes,<ref>{{cite book | last = Austin | first = M.M. | authorlink = | title = The Hellenistic World from Alexander to the Roman Conquest: A Selection of Ancient Sources in Translation | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1981 | location = | pages = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_frP_nixH9IC&pg=PA42&dq=perdiccas+son+of+Orontes | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-521-29666-3 }}</ref><ref>Arrian, ''Anabasis'', [https://archive.org/stream/L236ArrianIAnabasisOfAlexander14/L236-Arrian%20I%20Anabasis%20of%20Alexander%201-4#page/n275/mode/2up 3.11.9]</ref> a descendant of the independent princes of the Macedonian province of [[Orestis (region)|Orestis]]<ref>Arrian, ''Anabasis'', [https://archive.org/stream/L269ArrianAnabasisOfAlexanderI57/L269-Arrian%20Anabasis%20of%20Alexander%20I%3A5-7#page/n203/mode/2up 6.28.4]</ref>. While his actual date of birth is unknown, he would seem to have been of a similar age to Alexander. He had a brother called [[Alcetas]]<ref>Arrian, ''Successors'', [http://www.attalus.org/translate/fgh.html#156.0 1.21]</ref> and a sister, Atalant\u00ea, who married [[Attalus (son of Andromenes)|Attalus]].<ref>Diodorus Siculus, ''The Library of History'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/18B*.html 18.37.2]</ref>\n\n==Hetairos==\nAs the commander of a battalion of the [[Macedonian phalanx]] ([[Phalanx formation|heavy infantry]]), Perdiccas distinguished himself during the conquest of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] (335 BC), where he was severely wounded. Subsequently, he held an important command in the Indian campaigns of Alexander. In 324 BC, at the nuptials celebrated at [[Susa]], Perdiccas married the daughter of the [[satrap]] of [[Medes|Media]], a Persian named [[Atropates]]. When [[Hephaestion]] unexpectedly died the same year, Perdiccas was appointed his successor as commander of the [[Companion cavalry]] and ''[[chiliarch]]''. As Alexander lay dying on 11 June 323 BC, he gave his ring to Perdiccas.\n\n==Diadoch==\n{{further information|Partition of Babylon}}\nFollowing the [[death of Alexander the Great]], his generals met to discuss what should be their next steps.  Perdiccas proposed that a final decision wait until Alexander's wife [[Roxana]], who was pregnant, had given birth.  If the child was a boy, then Perdiccas proposed that the child would be chosen as the new king.  This meant that Perdiccas would be the regent and effectively the ruler of Alexander's empire until the boy was old enough to rule on his own.  Despite misgivings amongst the other generals, most accepted Perdiccas'  proposal.\n\nHowever, the infantry commander, [[Meleager (general)|Meleager]], disagreed with Perdiccas' plans.  Meleager argued in favour of Alexander's half brother, Arridaeus, who he considered to be first in line of succession.  The infantry supported this proposal with Meleagar's troops willing to fight in favour of Arridaeus.\n\n== Regent ==\n[[File:Philip III Arrhidaios Babylon mint struck under Perdikkas circa 323 320 BC.jpg|thumb|350px|Coin of [[Philip III Arrhidaios]] struck under Perdiccas in [[Babylon]], circa 323-320 BC.

Head of Herakles right, wearing lion skin headdress / [BASILEWS FILIPPOU], Zeus A\u00ebtophoros seated left; wheel and monogram in left field, monogram below throne.]]\nThrough the [[Partition of Babylon]] a compromise was reached under which Perdiccas was to serve as \"Regent of the Empire\" and supreme commander of the imperial army.  Arridaeus and the unborn child of Alexander's wife [[Roxana]] (the future [[Alexander IV of Macedon]]) were recognized as joint kings. While the general [[Craterus]] was officially declared \"Guardian of the Royal Family\", Perdiccas effectively held this position, as the joint kings were with him in Babylon. Perdiccas soon showed himself intolerant of any rivals, and, acting in the name of the two kings, sought to hold the empire together under his own hand. Alexander the Great's second wife, [[Stateira II|Stateira]], was murdered.  Perdiccas had Meleager arrested and murdered.\n\nPerdiccas' authority as regent and his control over the royal family were immediately challenged. Perdiccas appointed [[Leonnatus]], one of Alexander's bodyguards or [[somatophylakes]], as satrap of [[Phrygia|Hellespontine Phrygia]] on the western coast of [[Asia Minor]]. However, instead of assuming that position, Leonnatus sailed to Macedonia when Alexander's sister, [[Cleopatra of Macedon|Cleopatra]], widow of King [[Alexander I of Epirus]], offered her hand to him. Upon learning of this, in spring 322 BC Perdiccas marched the imperial army towards Asia Minor to reassert his dominance as regent. Perdiccas ordered Leonnatus to appear before him to stand trial for disobedience, but Leonnatus died during the [[Lamian War]] before the order reached him.\n\nAt around the same time, [[Cynane]], Alexander's half-sister, arranged for her daughter, [[Eurydice II of Macedon|Eurydice II]], to marry the joint king, Arridaeus (Philip III). Fearful of Cynane's influence, Perdiccas ordered his brother [[Alcetas]] to murder her. The discontent expressed by the army at the plan to murder her and their respect for Eurydice as a member of royal family persuaded Perdiccas not only to spare her life but to approve of the marriage to Philip III. Despite the marriage, Perdiccas continued to firmly hold control over the affairs of the royal family.\n\nAs regent and commander-in-chief, Perdiccas saw it as important that he consolidate Alexander's empire.  A key step in achieving this was to conquer Cappadocia which still remained under Persian rule.  However, [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus]], the Macedonian satrap of [[Pamphylia]] and [[Lycia]], was unwilling to support Perdiccas when in 322 BC Perdiccas successfully invaded Cappadocia. When Perdiccas ordered Antigonus to appear before his court, Antigonus fled to Antipater's court in Macedonia.\n\nTo strengthen his control over the empire, Perdiccas agreed to marry [[Nicaea of Macedonia|Nicaea]], the daughter of the satrap of Macedonia, [[Antipater]]. However, he broke off the engagement in 322 BC when [[Olympias]], mother of Alexander the Great, offered him the hand of Alexander's full sister [[Cleopatra of Macedon|Cleopatra]]. Given the intellectual disability of Philip III and the limited acceptance of the boy, [[Alexander IV of Macedon|Alexander IV]], due to his mother being a Persian, the marriage would have given Perdiccas a claim as Alexander's true successor, not merely as regent.\n\n== Civil War and Invasion of Egypt==\nAs a result of these events and actions, Perdiccas earned Antipater's animosity, while Antigonus had reason to fear Perdiccas. Another general, [[Craterus]], was also unhappy at being ignored by Perdiccas despite his important position within the army when Alexander was alive. So Antipater, Craterus and Antigonus agreed to revolt against Perdiccas.\n\nIn late 321 BC, Perdiccas intended to send Alexander's body back to [[Vergina|Aegae]] in [[Macedonia (Ancient Kingdom)| Macedonia]], the traditional place of burial for the Macedonian Royal Family. [[Arrhidaeus]] was chosen to escort the body back to  [[Macedonia (Ancient Kingdom)| Macedonia]] however, when Alexander's remains were passing through Syria, [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]], the satrap of Egypt, was able to bribe the escort and seize the body. [[Ptolemy I Sotor|Ptolemy]] brought Alexander's remains back to Egypt where they were housed in the city of [[Memphis, Egypt| Memphis]].  Perdiccas regarded Ptolemy's action as an unacceptable provocation and decided to invade Egypt. \n\nPerdiccas marched to attack [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] in [[Egypt]] and reached the most easterly [[tributary]] of the [[Nile]] near [[Pelusium]] but discovered that the opposite side of the river was garrisoned. in response he marched upstream to find a suitable point to cross , Perdiccas soon came across a ford which lead to the cities of [[Tanis]] and [[Avaris]] on the other side of the [[Nile]]. however a fort inhibited the advance, the fort was defended by an [[Egypt]]ian force known as the 'Camel's Rampart'. Perdiccas ordered his war [[Elephants]] and [[Silver Sheild]] infantry to attack however a larger army under [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] arrived, denying Perdiccas an easy victory. Despite this disadvantage, the attack began, however Perdiccas was overwhelmed and forced to retreat and search for another crossing. He came across another crossing near [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] however when he attempted the crossing the water became increasingly deeper, drowing many of his men.\n\n== Death ==\nFollowing what was so far a disastrous campaign. A mutiny broke out amongst Perdiccas' troops, who were disheartened by his failure to make progress in Egypt. Perdiccas was murdred by his officers ([[Peithon]], [[Antigenes (general)|Antigenes]], and [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]]) some time in either 321 or 320 BC. His officers and the rest of his army defected to [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | ref=harv | last=Austin | first=M.

A pre-[[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] bourse was not exactly a formal stock exchange in its modern sense.

Stock exchanges often function as \"continuous auction\" markets with buyers and sellers consummating transactions via [[open outcry]] at a central location such as the floor of the exchange or by using an [[electronic trading platform]].<ref>Lemke and Lins, ''Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities'', \u00a72:3 (Thomson West, 2013-2014 ed.).</ref>\n\nTo be able to trade a security on a certain stock exchange, the security must be [[Listing (finance)|listed]] there. Usually, there is a central location at least for record keeping, but trade is increasingly less linked to a physical place, as modern markets use [[electronic communication network]]s, which give them advantages of increased speed and reduced cost of transactions. Trade on an exchange is restricted to brokers who are members of the exchange. In recent years, various other trading venues, such as electronic communication networks, [[alternative trading system]]s and \"[[dark pool]]s\" have taken much of the trading activity away from traditional stock exchanges.<ref>Lemke and Lins, ''Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities'', \u00a7\u00a72:25 - 2:30 (Thomson West, 2013-2014 ed.).</ref>\n\n[[Initial public offering]]s of stocks and bonds to investors is done in the [[primary market]] and subsequent trading is done in the [[secondary market]]. A stock exchange is often the most important component of a stock market. Supply and demand in [[stock market]]s are driven by various factors that, as in all [[free market]]s, affect the price of stocks (see [[stock valuation]]).\n\nThere is usually no obligation for stock to be issued through the stock exchange itself, nor must stock be subsequently traded on an exchange. Such trading may be ''off exchange'' or [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]]. This is the usual way that [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] are traded.

One of Europe's oldest stock exchanges is the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] ([[:de:B\u00f6rse Frankfurt|Frankfurter Wertpapierb\u00f6rse]]) established in 1585 in [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]]. Economist [[Ulrike Malmendier]] of the [[University of California at Berkeley]] argues that a share market existed as far back as [[ancient Rome]], that derives from [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] \"Argentari\". In the [[Roman Republic]], which existed for centuries before the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] was founded, there were ''societates publicanorum'', organizations of contractors or leaseholders who performed temple-building and other services for the government. One such service was the feeding of geese on the Capitoline Hill as a reward to the birds after their honking warned of a Gallic invasion in 390&nbsp;B.C. Participants in such organizations had ''partes'' or shares, a concept mentioned various times by the statesman and orator [[Cicero]]. In one speech, Cicero mentions \"shares that had a very high price at the time\". Such evidence, in Malmendier's view, suggests the instruments were tradable, with fluctuating values based on an organization's success. The ''societas'' declined into obscurity in the time of the emperors, as most of their services were taken over by direct agents of the state.\n\nTradable [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] as a commonly used type of security were a more recent innovation, spearheaded by the Italian city-states of the late [[medieval]] and early [[Renaissance]] periods.<ref>Stringham, Edward Peter; Curott, Nicholas A.: ''On the Origins of Stock Markets'' [Part IV: ''Institutions and Organizations''; Chapter 14], pp. 324-344, in ''The Oxford Handbook of Austrian Economics'', edited by [[Peter J.

The company paid an average dividend of over 16% per year from 1602 to 1650. Financial innovation in Amsterdam took many forms. In 1609, investors led by [[Isaac Le Maire]] formed history's first [[bear market]] syndicate, but their coordinated trading had only a modest impact in driving down share prices, which tended to remain robust throughout the 17th century. By the 1620s, the company was expanding its securities issuance with the first use of corporate bonds.\n\n[[Joseph de la Vega]], also known as Joseph Penso de la Vega and by other variations of his name, was an Amsterdam trader from a Spanish Jewish family and a prolific writer as well as a successful businessman in 17th-century Amsterdam. His 1688 book ''Confusion of Confusions''<ref>[[Joseph de la Vega|De la Vega, Joseph]], ''Confusion de Confusiones'' (1688), ''Portions Descriptive of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange'', introduction by Hermann Kellenbenz, Baker Library, Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration (1957)</ref> explained the workings of the city's stock market. It was the earliest book about [[stock trading]] and inner workings of a stock market, taking the form of a dialogue between a merchant, a shareholder and a philosopher, the book described a market that was sophisticated but also prone to excesses, and de la Vega offered advice to his readers on such topics as the unpredictability of market shifts and the importance of patience in investment.\n\n[[File:Microcosm of London Plate 075 - New Stock Exchange (tone).jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[London Stock Exchange]] in 1810]]\nIn England, [[William III of England|King William III]] sought to modernize the kingdom's finances to pay for its wars, and thus the first government bonds were issued in 1693 and the [[Bank of England]] was set up the following year. Soon thereafter, English [[joint-stock company|joint-stock companies]] began going public. \n\nLondon's first stockbrokers, however, were barred from the old commercial center known as the Royal Exchange, reportedly because of their rude manners. Instead, the new trade was conducted from coffee houses along [[Exchange Alley, London|Exchange Alley]]. By 1698, a broker named John Castaing, operating out of [[Jonathan's Coffee House]], was posting regular lists of stock and commodity prices. Those lists mark the beginning of the [[London Stock Exchange]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.stockbroking101.com/stockbroker-101-a-cool-history/ | title=Stockbroker 101 - A Cool History | publisher=Stockbroker 101}}</ref>\n\nOne of history's greatest [[financial bubble]]s occurred around 1720. At the center of it were the [[South Sea Company]], set up in 1711 to conduct English trade with South America, and the [[Mississippi Company]], focused on commerce with France's Louisiana colony and touted by transplanted Scottish financier [[John Law (economist)|John Law]], who was acting in effect as France's central banker. Investors snapped up shares in both, and whatever else was available. In 1720, at the height of the mania, there was even an offering of \"a company for carrying out an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is\".\n\nBy the end of that same year, share prices had started collapsing, as it became clear that expectations of imminent wealth from the Americas were overblown. In London, Parliament passed the [[Bubble Act]], which stated that only royally chartered companies could issue public shares. In Paris, Law was stripped of office and fled the country. Stock trading was more limited and subdued in subsequent decades. Yet the market survived, and by the 1790s shares were being traded in the young United States.

For this reason, the public market provided by the stock exchanges has been one of the most important funding sources for many capital intensive [[Startup company|startup]]s. {{confusing-short|text=After the 1990s and early-2000s hi-tech listed companies' boom and bust in the world's major stock exchanges|reason=word grouping is ambiguous, especially with the word \"listed\" in there, but even without|post-text=(confusing syntax)|date=May 2019}}, it has been much more demanding for the high-tech entrepreneur to take his/her company public, unless either the company is already generating sales and earnings, or the company has demonstrated credibility and potential from successful outcomes: clinical trials, market research, patent registrations, etc. This is quite different from the situation of the 1990s to early-2000s period, when a number of companies (particularly Internet boom and biotechnology companies) [[Initial public offering|went public]] in the most prominent stock exchanges around the world in the total absence of sales, earnings, or any type of well-documented promising outcome. Though it's not as common, it still happens that highly speculative and financially unpredictable hi-tech startups are listed for the first time in a major stock exchange. Additionally, there are smaller, specialized entry markets for these kind of companies with [[stock index]]es tracking their performance (examples include the [[Alternext]], [[CAC Small]], [[SDAX]], [[TecDAX]]).\n\n====Alternatives to stock exchanges for raising capital====\n===== Research and Development limited partnerships=====\nCompanies have also raised significant amounts of capital through [[R&D]] [[limited partnership]]s. Tax law changes that were enacted in 1987 in the United States changed the tax deductibility of investments in R&D limited partnerships. In order for a partnership to be of interest to investors today, the [[cash on cash return]] must be high enough to entice investors.\n\n=====Venture capital=====\nA general source of capital for startup companies has been [[venture capital]]. This source remains largely available today, but the maximum statistical amount that the venture company firms in aggregate will invest in any one company is not limitless (it was approximately $15 million in 2001 for a biotechnology company).\n\n=====Corporate partners=====\nAnother alternative source of cash for a private company is a corporate partner, usually an established multinational company, which provides capital for the smaller company in return for marketing rights, patent rights, or equity. Corporate partnerships have been used successfully in a large number of cases.\n\n===Mobilizing savings for investment===\nWhen people draw their savings and invest in shares (through an [[initial public offering]] or the [[seasoned equity offering]] of an already listed company), it usually leads to [[Rationality|rational]] allocation of resources because funds, which could have been consumed, or kept in idle [[Deposit (finance)|deposits]] with banks, are mobilized and redirected to help companies' management boards finance their organizations. This may promote business activity with benefits for several economic sectors such as agriculture, commerce and industry, resulting in stronger economic growth and higher [[Productivity (economics)|productivity]] levels of firms.\n\n===Facilitating acquisitions===\nCompanies view acquisitions as an opportunity to expand [[product line]]s, increase distribution channels, hedge against volatility, increase their [[market share]], or acquire other necessary business [[asset]]s. A [[takeover bid]] or  [[mergers and acquisitions]] through the [[stock market]] is one of the simplest and most common ways for a company to grow by acquisition or fusion.\n\n===Profit sharing===\nBoth casual and professional [[stock investor]]s, as large as [[institutional investor]]s or as small as an ordinary [[Middle class|middle-class family]], through [[dividend]]s and [[stock price]] increases that may result in [[capital gain]]s, share in the wealth of profitable businesses. Unprofitable and troubled businesses may result in [[capital loss]]es for shareholders.\n\n===Corporate governance===\nBy having a wide and varied scope of owners, companies generally tend to improve management standards and [[Efficiency (economics)|efficiency]] to satisfy the demands of these shareholders and the more stringent rules for public corporations imposed by public stock exchanges and the government. This improvement can be attributed in some cases to the price mechanism exerted through shares of stock, wherein the price of the stock falls when management is considered poor (making the firm vulnerable to a takeover by new management) or rises when management is doing well (making the firm less vulnerable to a takeover).  In addition, publicly listed shares are subject to greater transparency so that investors can make informed decisions about a purchase.  Consequently, it is alleged that public companies (companies that are owned by shareholders who are members of the general public and trade shares on public exchanges) tend to have better management records than [[privately held company|privately held companies]] (those companies where shares are not publicly traded, often owned by the company founders, their families and heirs, or otherwise by a small group of investors).\n\nDespite this claim, some well-documented cases are known where it is alleged that there has been considerable slippage in [[corporate governance]] on the part of some public companies, particularly in the cases of [[accounting scandal]]s. The policies that led to the [[dot-com bubble]] in the late 1990s and the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] in 2007\u201308 are also examples of corporate mismanagement. The mismanagement of companies such as [[Pets.com]] (2000), [[Enron]] (2001), [[One.Tel]] (2001), [[Sunbeam Products]] (2001), [[Webvan]] (2001), [[Adelphia Communications Corporation]] (2002), [[MCI WorldCom]] (2002), [[Parmalat]] (2003), [[American International Group]] (2008), [[Bear Stearns]] (2008), [[Lehman Brothers]] (2008), [[General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization|General Motors]] (2009) and [[Satyam Computer Services]] (2009) all received plenty of media attention.\n\nMany banks and companies worldwide utilize securities identification numbers ([[ISIN]]) to identify, uniquely, their stocks, bonds and other securities. Adding an ISIN code helps to distinctly identify securities and the ISIN system is used worldwide by funds, companies, and governments.\n\nHowever, when poor financial, ethical or managerial records become public, [[stock investor]]s tend to lose money as the stock and the company tend to lose value. In the stock exchanges, shareholders of underperforming firms are often penalized by significant share price decline, and they tend as well to dismiss incompetent management teams.\n\n===Creating investment opportunities for small investors===\nAs opposed to other businesses that require huge capital outlay, investing in shares is open to both the large and small [[stock investor]]s as minimum investment amounts are minimal. Therefore, the stock exchange provides the opportunity for small investors to own shares of the same companies as large investors.\n\n===Government capital-raising for development projects===\nGovernments at various levels may decide to borrow money to finance infrastructure projects such as sewage and water treatment works or housing estates by selling another category of [[Security (finance)|securities]] known as [[bond (finance)|bonds]]. These bonds can be raised through the stock [https://www.smartworking1.in/2020/03/what-is-difference-between-nse-and-bse.html exchange] whereby members of the public buy them, thus loaning money to the government. The issuance of such bonds can obviate, in the short term, direct taxation of citizens to finance development\u2014though by securing such bonds with the full faith and credit of the government instead of with collateral, the government must eventually tax citizens or otherwise raise additional funds to make any regular coupon payments and refund the principal when the bonds mature.\n\n===Barometer of the economy===\nAt the stock exchange, share prices rise and fall depending, largely, on economic forces. Share prices tend to rise or remain stable when companies and the economy in general show signs of stability and growth. A [[recession]], [[Depression (economics)|depression]], or [[financial crisis]] could eventually lead to a [[stock market crash]]. Therefore, the movement of share prices and in general of the [[stock index]]es can be an indicator of the general trend in the economy.\n\n==Listing requirements==\nEach stock [https://www.smartworking1.in/?m=1 exchange] imposes its own [[listing requirements]] upon companies that want to be listed on that exchange. Such conditions may include minimum number of shares outstanding, minimum market capitalization, and minimum annual income.\n\n===Examples of listing requirements===\nThe listing requirements imposed by some stock exchanges include:\n* '''New York Stock Exchange:''' the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) requires a company to have issued at least a million shares of stock worth $100 million and must have earned more than $10 million over the last three years.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/listing/NYSE_Initial_Listing_Standards_Summary.pdf | title=Overview of NYSE Quantitative Initial Listing Standards | publisher=[[New York Stock Exchange]]}}</ref>\n* '''NASDAQ Stock Exchange:''' [[NASDAQ]] requires a company to have issued at least 1.25 million shares of stock worth at least $70 million and must have earned more than $11 million over the last three years.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nasdaq.com/about/listing_information.stm | title=Applications, Notifications & Guides - Nasdaq Listing Center | publisher=[[NASDAQ]]}}</ref>\n* '''London Stock Exchange:''' the main market of the [[London Stock Exchange]] requires a minimum market capitalization (\u00a3700,000), three years of audited financial statements, minimum public float (25%) and sufficient [[working capital]] for at least 12 months from the date of listing.\n* '''Bombay Stock Exchange:''' [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] (BSE) requires a minimum market capitalization of {{INRConvert|250|m}} and minimum public float equivalent to {{INRConvert|100|m}}.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bseindia.com/ | title=Bombay Stock Exchange | publisher=[[Bombay Stock Exchange]]}}</ref>\n\n==Ownership==\nStock exchanges originated as [[mutual organization]]s, owned by its member stockbrokers. However, the major stock exchanges have ''demutualized'', where the members sell their shares in an [[initial public offering]]. In this way the mutual organization becomes a corporation, with shares that are listed on a stock exchange. Examples are [[Australian Securities Exchange]] (1998), [[Euronext]] (merged with New York Stock Exchange), [[NASDAQ]] (2002), [[Bursa Malaysia]] (2004), the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (2005), [[Bolsas y Mercados Espa\u00f1oles]], and the [[S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange]] (2007).\n\nThe [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange]] and [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]] can be characterized as quasi-state institutions insofar as they were created by government bodies in China and their leading personnel are directly appointed by the [[China Securities Regulatory Commission]].\n\nAnother example is [[Tashkent Stock Exchange]] established in 1994, three years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, mainly state-owned but has a form of a public corporation ([[joint-stock company]]). [[Korea Exchange]] (KRX) owns 25% less one share of the Tashkent Stock Exchange.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.uzse.uz/abouts/history?locale=en | title=Stages of the Republican Stock Exchange | publisher=[[Tashkent Stock Exchange]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, there were 15 licensed stock exchanges in the United States, of which 13 actively traded securities.

A pre-[[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] bourse was not exactly a formal stock exchange in its modern sense. With the founding of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1602 and the rise of Dutch [[capital market]]s in the early 1600s, the 'old' bourse (a place to trade [[Commodity market|commodities]], [[government bond|government]] and [[municipal bond]]s) found a new purpose \u2013 a formal exchange that specializes in creating and sustaining [[secondary market]]s in the [[Security (finance)|securities]] (such as [[corporate bond|bond]]s and [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]]) issued by [[corporations]] \u2013 or a stock exchange as we know it today.<ref>Neal, Larry (2005). \"Venture Shares of the Dutch East India Company\", in Goetzmann & Rouwenhorst (eds.), Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 165\u2013175</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2014/07/01/is-asia-the-next-financial-center-of-the-world.html | title=Is Asia the next financial center of the world? | work=[[CNBC]] | last=Murphy | first=Richard McGill | quote=As Richard McGill Murphy (2014) notes: \"In 1602 the Dutch East India Company opened the world's first stock exchange in Amsterdam.

Stock exchanges often function as \"continuous auction\" markets with buyers and sellers consummating transactions via [[open outcry]] at a central location such as the floor of the exchange or by using an [[electronic trading platform]].<ref>Lemke and Lins, ''Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities'', \u00a72:3 (Thomson West, 2013-2014 ed.).</ref>\n\nTo be able to trade a security on a certain stock exchange, the security must be [[Listing (finance)|listed]] there. Usually, there is a central location at least for record keeping, but trade is increasingly less linked to a physical place, as modern markets use [[electronic communication network]]s, which give them advantages of increased speed and reduced cost of transactions. Trade on an exchange is restricted to brokers who are members of the exchange. In recent years, various other trading venues, such as electronic communication networks, [[alternative trading system]]s and \"[[dark pool]]s\" have taken much of the trading activity away from traditional stock exchanges.<ref>Lemke and Lins, ''Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities'', \u00a7\u00a72:25 - 2:30 (Thomson West, 2013-2014 ed.).</ref>\n\n[[Initial public offering]]s of stocks and bonds to investors is done in the [[primary market]] and subsequent trading is done in the [[secondary market]]. A stock exchange is often the most important component of a stock market. Supply and demand in [[stock market]]s are driven by various factors that, as in all [[free market]]s, affect the price of stocks (see [[stock valuation]]).\n\nThere is usually no obligation for stock to be issued through the stock exchange itself, nor must stock be subsequently traded on an exchange. Such trading may be ''off exchange'' or [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]]. This is the usual way that [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] are traded.

One of Europe's oldest stock exchanges is the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] ([[:de:B\u00f6rse Frankfurt|Frankfurter Wertpapierb\u00f6rse]]) established in 1585 in [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]]. Economist [[Ulrike Malmendier]] of the [[University of California at Berkeley]] argues that a share market existed as far back as [[ancient Rome]], that derives from [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] \"Argentari\". In the [[Roman Republic]], which existed for centuries before the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] was founded, there were ''societates publicanorum'', organizations of contractors or leaseholders who performed temple-building and other services for the government. One such service was the feeding of geese on the Capitoline Hill as a reward to the birds after their honking warned of a Gallic invasion in 390&nbsp;B.C. Participants in such organizations had ''partes'' or shares, a concept mentioned various times by the statesman and orator [[Cicero]]. In one speech, Cicero mentions \"shares that had a very high price at the time\". Such evidence, in Malmendier's view, suggests the instruments were tradable, with fluctuating values based on an organization's success. The ''societas'' declined into obscurity in the time of the emperors, as most of their services were taken over by direct agents of the state.\n\nTradable [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] as a commonly used type of security were a more recent innovation, spearheaded by the Italian city-states of the late [[medieval]] and early [[Renaissance]] periods.<ref>Stringham, Edward Peter; Curott, Nicholas A.: ''On the Origins of Stock Markets'' [Part IV: ''Institutions and Organizations''; Chapter 14], pp. 324-344, in ''The Oxford Handbook of Austrian Economics'', edited by [[Peter J.

Yet the title of the world's first stock market deservedly goes to that of seventeenth-century Amsterdam, where an active secondary market in company shares emerged. The two major companies were the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the [[Dutch West India Company]], founded in 1602 and 1621. Other companies existed, but they were not as large and constituted a small portion of the stock market (Israel [1989] 1991, 109\u2013112; Dehing and 't Hart 1997, 54; dela Vega [1688] 1996, 173).\"</ref>\n\n===Establishment of formal stock exchanges===\n{{See also|Economic history of the Dutch Republic|Financial history of the Dutch Republic|Dutch East India Company}}\n{{Cquote|The stock market \u2014 the daytime adventure serial of the well-to-do \u2014 would not be the stock market if it did not have its ups and downs.

Yet the title of the world's first stock market deservedly goes to that of seventeenth-century Amsterdam, where an active secondary market in company shares emerged. The two major companies were the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the [[Dutch West India Company]], founded in 1602 and 1621. Other companies existed, but they were not as large and constituted a small portion of the stock market (Israel [1989] 1991, 109\u2013112; Dehing and 't Hart 1997, 54; dela Vega [1688] 1996, 173).\"</ref> In the early 1600s the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) became the first company in history to issue [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and [[Share (finance)|shares]] of [[stock]] to the general public.

Control of the company was held tightly by its directors, with ordinary shareholders not having much influence on management or even access to the company's accounting statements.\n[[File:Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie spiegelretourschip Amsterdam replica.jpg|thumb|left|Replica of an [[East Indiaman]] of the [[Dutch East India Company]]/[[United East Indies Company]] (VOC).

The company paid an average dividend of over 16% per year from 1602 to 1650. Financial innovation in Amsterdam took many forms. In 1609, investors led by [[Isaac Le Maire]] formed history's first [[bear market]] syndicate, but their coordinated trading had only a modest impact in driving down share prices, which tended to remain robust throughout the 17th century. By the 1620s, the company was expanding its securities issuance with the first use of corporate bonds.\n\n[[Joseph de la Vega]], also known as Joseph Penso de la Vega and by other variations of his name, was an Amsterdam trader from a Spanish Jewish family and a prolific writer as well as a successful businessman in 17th-century Amsterdam. His 1688 book ''Confusion of Confusions''<ref>[[Joseph de la Vega|De la Vega, Joseph]], ''Confusion de Confusiones'' (1688), ''Portions Descriptive of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange'', introduction by Hermann Kellenbenz, Baker Library, Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration (1957)</ref> explained the workings of the city's stock market. It was the earliest book about [[stock trading]] and inner workings of a stock market, taking the form of a dialogue between a merchant, a shareholder and a philosopher, the book described a market that was sophisticated but also prone to excesses, and de la Vega offered advice to his readers on such topics as the unpredictability of market shifts and the importance of patience in investment.\n\n[[File:Microcosm of London Plate 075 - New Stock Exchange (tone).jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[London Stock Exchange]] in 1810]]\nIn England, [[William III of England|King William III]] sought to modernize the kingdom's finances to pay for its wars, and thus the first government bonds were issued in 1693 and the [[Bank of England]] was set up the following year. Soon thereafter, English [[joint-stock company|joint-stock companies]] began going public. \n\nLondon's first stockbrokers, however, were barred from the old commercial center known as the Royal Exchange, reportedly because of their rude manners. Instead, the new trade was conducted from coffee houses along [[Exchange Alley, London|Exchange Alley]]. By 1698, a broker named John Castaing, operating out of [[Jonathan's Coffee House]], was posting regular lists of stock and commodity prices. Those lists mark the beginning of the [[London Stock Exchange]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.stockbroking101.com/stockbroker-101-a-cool-history/ | title=Stockbroker 101 - A Cool History | publisher=Stockbroker 101}}</ref>\n\nOne of history's greatest [[financial bubble]]s occurred around 1720. At the center of it were the [[South Sea Company]], set up in 1711 to conduct English trade with South America, and the [[Mississippi Company]], focused on commerce with France's Louisiana colony and touted by transplanted Scottish financier [[John Law (economist)|John Law]], who was acting in effect as France's central banker. Investors snapped up shares in both, and whatever else was available. In 1720, at the height of the mania, there was even an offering of \"a company for carrying out an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is\".\n\nBy the end of that same year, share prices had started collapsing, as it became clear that expectations of imminent wealth from the Americas were overblown. In London, Parliament passed the [[Bubble Act]], which stated that only royally chartered companies could issue public shares. In Paris, Law was stripped of office and fled the country. Stock trading was more limited and subdued in subsequent decades. Yet the market survived, and by the 1790s shares were being traded in the young United States. On May 17, 1792, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] opened under a [[platanus occidentalis]] (buttonwood tree) in [[New York City]], as 24 stockbrokers signed the [[Buttonwood Agreement]], agreeing to trade five securities under that buttonwood tree.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/business/hottopic/stock_market.html | title=History of the NY Stock Exchange | publisher=[[Library of Congress]] | date=May 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Role of stock exchanges==\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Neue Boerse von Suedosten-20120222.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[B\u00f6rse Frankfurt]] (founded in 1585)]]\n[[File:NYSE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|The floor of the [[New York Stock Exchange]]]]\n[[File:Paternoster Square.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[London Stock Exchange]], the [[City of London]]]]\n[[File:TokyoStockExchange1144.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Tokyo Stock Exchange]], Tokyo]]\n[[File:S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange Building.jpg|thumb|[[B3 (stock exchange)|B3]] is the largest stock exchange in Latin America]]\n[[File:Indonesia Stock Exchange.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Indonesian Stock Exchange]] ''(Bursa Efek Indonesia)'' building in [[Jakarta]] is considered one of the oldest in Asia.]]\n[[File:Torre Axtel y Bolsa de Valores.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Mexican Stock Exchange]] (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores), it's the second largest stock exchanges in Latin America.]]\n[[File:Bursa Malaysia.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|The offices of [[Bursa Malaysia]], Malaysia's national stock exchange (known before demutualization as Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange) ]]\nStock exchanges have multiple roles in the economy. This may include the following:<ref>{{cite journal | last=Diamond | first=Peter A. | authorlink= | year=1967 | title=The Role of a Stock Market in a General Equilibrium Model with Technological Uncertainty | journal=[[American Economic Review]] | volume=57 | issue=4 | pages=759\u2013776 | doi= | jstor=1815367}}</ref>\n\n===Raising capital for businesses===\nBesides the borrowing capacity provided to an individual or firm by the [[banking system]], in the form of [[credit (finance)|credit]] or a loan, a stock exchange provides [[company|companies]] with the facility to raise [[Financial capital|capital]] for expansion through selling [[Share (finance)|shares]] to the investing public.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gilson |first=Ronald J. |authorlink= |author2=Black, Bernard S.  |year=1998 |title=Venture Capital and the Structure of Capital Markets: Banks Versus Stock Markets |journal=Journal of Financial Economics |volume=47 |issue= |doi=10.2139/ssrn.46909 |url=https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2152&context=faculty_scholarship}}</ref>\n\n[[Capital intensive]] companies, particularly [[high tech]] companies, always need to raise high volumes of capital in their early stages. For this reason, the public market provided by the stock exchanges has been one of the most important funding sources for many capital intensive [[Startup company|startup]]s. {{confusing-short|text=After the 1990s and early-2000s hi-tech listed companies' boom and bust in the world's major stock exchanges|reason=word grouping is ambiguous, especially with the word \"listed\" in there, but even without|post-text=(confusing syntax)|date=May 2019}}, it has been much more demanding for the high-tech entrepreneur to take his/her company public, unless either the company is already generating sales and earnings, or the company has demonstrated credibility and potential from successful outcomes: clinical trials, market research, patent registrations, etc. This is quite different from the situation of the 1990s to early-2000s period, when a number of companies (particularly Internet boom and biotechnology companies) [[Initial public offering|went public]] in the most prominent stock exchanges around the world in the total absence of sales, earnings, or any type of well-documented promising outcome. Though it's not as common, it still happens that highly speculative and financially unpredictable hi-tech startups are listed for the first time in a major stock exchange. Additionally, there are smaller, specialized entry markets for these kind of companies with [[stock index]]es tracking their performance (examples include the [[Alternext]], [[CAC Small]], [[SDAX]], [[TecDAX]]).\n\n====Alternatives to stock exchanges for raising capital====\n===== Research and Development limited partnerships=====\nCompanies have also raised significant amounts of capital through [[R&D]] [[limited partnership]]s. Tax law changes that were enacted in 1987 in the United States changed the tax deductibility of investments in R&D limited partnerships. In order for a partnership to be of interest to investors today, the [[cash on cash return]] must be high enough to entice investors.\n\n=====Venture capital=====\nA general source of capital for startup companies has been [[venture capital]]. This source remains largely available today, but the maximum statistical amount that the venture company firms in aggregate will invest in any one company is not limitless (it was approximately $15 million in 2001 for a biotechnology company).\n\n=====Corporate partners=====\nAnother alternative source of cash for a private company is a corporate partner, usually an established multinational company, which provides capital for the smaller company in return for marketing rights, patent rights, or equity. Corporate partnerships have been used successfully in a large number of cases.\n\n===Mobilizing savings for investment===\nWhen people draw their savings and invest in shares (through an [[initial public offering]] or the [[seasoned equity offering]] of an already listed company), it usually leads to [[Rationality|rational]] allocation of resources because funds, which could have been consumed, or kept in idle [[Deposit (finance)|deposits]] with banks, are mobilized and redirected to help companies' management boards finance their organizations. This may promote business activity with benefits for several economic sectors such as agriculture, commerce and industry, resulting in stronger economic growth and higher [[Productivity (economics)|productivity]] levels of firms.\n\n===Facilitating acquisitions===\nCompanies view acquisitions as an opportunity to expand [[product line]]s, increase distribution channels, hedge against volatility, increase their [[market share]], or acquire other necessary business [[asset]]s. A [[takeover bid]] or  [[mergers and acquisitions]] through the [[stock market]] is one of the simplest and most common ways for a company to grow by acquisition or fusion.\n\n===Profit sharing===\nBoth casual and professional [[stock investor]]s, as large as [[institutional investor]]s or as small as an ordinary [[Middle class|middle-class family]], through [[dividend]]s and [[stock price]] increases that may result in [[capital gain]]s, share in the wealth of profitable businesses. Unprofitable and troubled businesses may result in [[capital loss]]es for shareholders.\n\n===Corporate governance===\nBy having a wide and varied scope of owners, companies generally tend to improve management standards and [[Efficiency (economics)|efficiency]] to satisfy the demands of these shareholders and the more stringent rules for public corporations imposed by public stock exchanges and the government. This improvement can be attributed in some cases to the price mechanism exerted through shares of stock, wherein the price of the stock falls when management is considered poor (making the firm vulnerable to a takeover by new management) or rises when management is doing well (making the firm less vulnerable to a takeover).  In addition, publicly listed shares are subject to greater transparency so that investors can make informed decisions about a purchase.  Consequently, it is alleged that public companies (companies that are owned by shareholders who are members of the general public and trade shares on public exchanges) tend to have better management records than [[privately held company|privately held companies]] (those companies where shares are not publicly traded, often owned by the company founders, their families and heirs, or otherwise by a small group of investors).\n\nDespite this claim, some well-documented cases are known where it is alleged that there has been considerable slippage in [[corporate governance]] on the part of some public companies, particularly in the cases of [[accounting scandal]]s. The policies that led to the [[dot-com bubble]] in the late 1990s and the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] in 2007\u201308 are also examples of corporate mismanagement. The mismanagement of companies such as [[Pets.com]] (2000), [[Enron]] (2001), [[One.Tel]] (2001), [[Sunbeam Products]] (2001), [[Webvan]] (2001), [[Adelphia Communications Corporation]] (2002), [[MCI WorldCom]] (2002), [[Parmalat]] (2003), [[American International Group]] (2008), [[Bear Stearns]] (2008), [[Lehman Brothers]] (2008), [[General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization|General Motors]] (2009) and [[Satyam Computer Services]] (2009) all received plenty of media attention.\n\nMany banks and companies worldwide utilize securities identification numbers ([[ISIN]]) to identify, uniquely, their stocks, bonds and other securities. Adding an ISIN code helps to distinctly identify securities and the ISIN system is used worldwide by funds, companies, and governments.\n\nHowever, when poor financial, ethical or managerial records become public, [[stock investor]]s tend to lose money as the stock and the company tend to lose value. In the stock exchanges, shareholders of underperforming firms are often penalized by significant share price decline, and they tend as well to dismiss incompetent management teams.\n\n===Creating investment opportunities for small investors===\nAs opposed to other businesses that require huge capital outlay, investing in shares is open to both the large and small [[stock investor]]s as minimum investment amounts are minimal. Therefore, the stock exchange provides the opportunity for small investors to own shares of the same companies as large investors.\n\n===Government capital-raising for development projects===\nGovernments at various levels may decide to borrow money to finance infrastructure projects such as sewage and water treatment works or housing estates by selling another category of [[Security (finance)|securities]] known as [[bond (finance)|bonds]]. These bonds can be raised through the stock exchange whereby members of the public buy them, thus loaning money to the government. The issuance of such bonds can obviate, in the short term, direct taxation of citizens to finance development\u2014though by securing such bonds with the full faith and credit of the government instead of with collateral, the government must eventually tax citizens or otherwise raise additional funds to make any regular coupon payments and refund the principal when the bonds mature.\n\n===Barometer of the economy===\nAt the stock exchange, share prices rise and fall depending, largely, on economic forces. Share prices tend to rise or remain stable when companies and the economy in general show signs of stability and growth. A [[recession]], [[Depression (economics)|depression]], or [[financial crisis]] could eventually lead to a [[stock market crash]]. Therefore, the movement of share prices and in general of the [[stock index]]es can be an indicator of the general trend in the economy.\n\n==Listing requirements==\nEach stock [https://www.smartworking1.in/?m=1 exchange] imposes its own [[listing requirements]] upon companies that want to be listed on that exchange. Such conditions may include minimum number of shares outstanding, minimum market capitalization, and minimum annual income.\n\n===Examples of listing requirements===\nThe listing requirements imposed by some stock exchanges include:\n* '''New York Stock Exchange:''' the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) requires a company to have issued at least a million shares of stock worth $100 million and must have earned more than $10 million over the last three years.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/listing/NYSE_Initial_Listing_Standards_Summary.pdf | title=Overview of NYSE Quantitative Initial Listing Standards | publisher=[[New York Stock Exchange]]}}</ref>\n* '''NASDAQ Stock Exchange:''' [[NASDAQ]] requires a company to have issued at least 1.25 million shares of stock worth at least $70 million and must have earned more than $11 million over the last three years.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nasdaq.com/about/listing_information.stm | title=Applications, Notifications & Guides - Nasdaq Listing Center | publisher=[[NASDAQ]]}}</ref>\n* '''London Stock Exchange:''' the main market of the [[London Stock Exchange]] requires a minimum market capitalization (\u00a3700,000), three years of audited financial statements, minimum public float (25%) and sufficient [[working capital]] for at least 12 months from the date of listing.\n* '''Bombay Stock Exchange:''' [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] (BSE) requires a minimum market capitalization of {{INRConvert|250|m}} and minimum public float equivalent to {{INRConvert|100|m}}.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bseindia.com/ | title=Bombay Stock Exchange | publisher=[[Bombay Stock Exchange]]}}</ref>\n\n==Ownership==\nStock exchanges originated as [[mutual organization]]s, owned by its member stockbrokers. However, the major stock exchanges have ''demutualized'', where the members sell their shares in an [[initial public offering]]. In this way the mutual organization becomes a corporation, with shares that are listed on a stock exchange. Examples are [[Australian Securities Exchange]] (1998), [[Euronext]] (merged with New York Stock Exchange), [[NASDAQ]] (2002), [[Bursa Malaysia]] (2004), the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (2005), [[Bolsas y Mercados Espa\u00f1oles]], and the [[S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange]] (2007).\n\nThe [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange]] and [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]] can be characterized as quasi-state institutions insofar as they were created by government bodies in China and their leading personnel are directly appointed by the [[China Securities Regulatory Commission]].\n\nAnother example is [[Tashkent Stock Exchange]] established in 1994, three years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, mainly state-owned but has a form of a public corporation ([[joint-stock company]]). [[Korea Exchange]] (KRX) owns 25% less one share of the Tashkent Stock Exchange.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.uzse.uz/abouts/history?locale=en | title=Stages of the Republican Stock Exchange | publisher=[[Tashkent Stock Exchange]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, there were 15 licensed stock exchanges in the United States, of which 13 actively traded securities. All of these exchanges were owned by three publicly traded multinational companies, [[Intercontinental Exchange]], [[Nasdaq, Inc.]], and [[Cboe Global Markets]], except one, [[IEX]].<ref name=Reuters1-19>{{Cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wallstreet-exchange-idUSKCN1P11A6 |title=Major Wall Street players plan exchange to challenge NYSE, Nasdaq | first=Diptendu | last=Lahiri | work=[[Reuters]] | date=January 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.businessinsider.com/competition-among-exchanges-has-reached-a-new-low-and-its-dangerous-for-the-stock-market-2018-5 | title=Competition among exchanges has reached a new low, and it's dangerous for the stock market | first=John | last=Ramsay | work=[[Business Insider]] | date=May 23, 2018}} (for recent history see also, {{Cite web | url=http://www.finra.org/investors/nyse-nasdaq-and-get-know-uss-stock-exchanges-part-1 |title=NYSE, Nasdaq and...?
