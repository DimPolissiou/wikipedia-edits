She demonstrates a few on some of her siblings much to their annoyance. But little does Luan know that she might get pranked right back.\n# Lori Loud \u2013 With Bobby on her phone helping out from Great Lakes City and Luna providing musical accompanyment, he and Lori talk about how they first met and eventually started dating. However, they over-romanticize the details on their first date so Luan and Lynn Jr. chime in and tell them what really happened and how they had spied on them during the date to make sure that Bobby was good for Lori.\n# Lincoln Loud \u2013 Lincoln and Clyde give the listeners a virtual tour of their treehouse. When their hammock goes missing, Lincoln and Clyde become Ace Savvy and One-Eyed Jack to find out who stole it. While Lincoln suspects that it's one of his sisters, they soon discover that the culprit is someone they'd least suspect.\n# Lynn Loud Jr. \u2013 Lynn Jr. leads the listeners in her own at-home workout, arguing that gym memberships are expensive and mentioning how some gyms tend to ban people for bringing spicy submarine sandwiches into the sauna. During every single part of the workout, Lynn causes fitness-type chaos in the house which annoys her family.\n# Lana Loud \u2013 Lana teaches the listeners how to handle and take care of vehicles. She uses the family van Vanzilla as an example. Lana gets some more help from her faithful frog Hops, her parents (Lynn Sr. and Rita), and two of her sisters: Lori and Leni as they are the ones who drive Vanzilla.\n# Lucy Loud \u2013 Lucy talks about the five main features of the Royal Woods Cemetery with the help of Lincoln since Luan was unavailable. Though they soon find evidence that there is a [[ghost]] in the area.\n# Rita Loud \u2013 Rita discusses what she does at her dentist job as she runs the dental office while Dr. Feinstein is away at Cavity Con. While she does the dental work on Lola, Lori, and a reluctant Lynn Loud Sr., Rita also has to deal with some malfunctioning equipment which leads to her calling Lana in to take care of them.\n# Lisa Loud \u2013 Lisa takes a break from solving her family's problems so that she can use her brainpower to solve the greater challenges of humankind by hosting a call-in called \"Ask a Brainiac.\" Though the people who call her up are Lynn Loud Sr., Luan, Rita, Lincoln, and Lynn with their respectful questions.\n\n===Films===\n====Feature film====\nOn March 28, 2017, [[Paramount Pictures]]' president [[Marc Evans]] announced a film based on the series originally set for release on February 7, 2020 in cinemas.<ref name=\"D'Alessandro\">{{cite web|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|title=Paramount Teases Its Nickelodeon-Based Feature Toon Lineup Including \u2018The Loud House\u2019 \u2013 CinemaCon|url=http://deadline.com/2017/03/spongebob-loud-house-sherlock-gnomes-1202054433/|date=March 28, 2017|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=March 28, 2017}}</ref> However, in January 2019, Paramount removed the film from their schedule.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pedersen|first=Erik|title=Paramount Dates \u2018Crawl\u2019 & \u2018Playing With Fire\u2019, Moves \u2018Loud House\u2019 Off Schedule|url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/paramount-crawl-playing-with-fire-loud-house-release-dates-1202537734/|date=January 18, 2019|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=January 18, 2019}}</ref> On February 5, 2019, it was announced that the film would instead be produced for release on [[Netflix]].<ref name=\"Vlessing\"/> On April 30, 2019, it was announced the film will be released sometime in 2021.

She demonstrates a few on some of her siblings much to their annoyance. But little does Luan know that she might get pranked right back.\n# Lori Loud \u2013 With Bobby on her phone helping out from Great Lakes City and Luna providing musical accompanyment, he and Lori talk about how they first met and eventually started dating. However, they over-romanticize the details on their first date so Luan and Lynn Jr. chime in and tell them what really happened and how they had spied on them during the date to make sure that Bobby was good for Lori.\n# Lincoln Loud \u2013 Lincoln and Clyde give the listeners a virtual tour of their treehouse. When their hammock goes missing, Lincoln and Clyde become Ace Savvy and One-Eyed Jack to find out who stole it. While Lincoln suspects that it's one of his sisters, they soon discover that the culprit is someone they'd least suspect.\n# Lynn Loud Jr. \u2013 Lynn Jr. leads the listeners in her own at-home workout, arguing that gym memberships are expensive and mentioning how some gyms tend to ban people for bringing spicy submarine sandwiches into the sauna. During every single part of the workout, Lynn causes fitness-type chaos in the house which annoys her family.\n# Lana Loud \u2013 Lana teaches the listeners how to handle and take care of vehicles. She uses the family van Vanzilla as an example. Lana gets some more help from her faithful frog Hops, her parents (Lynn Sr. and Rita), and two of her sisters: Lori and Leni as they are the ones who drive Vanzilla.\n# Lucy Loud \u2013 Lucy talks about the five main features of the Royal Woods Cemetery with the help of Lincoln since Luan was unavailable. Though they soon find evidence that there is a [[ghost]] in the area.\n# Rita Loud \u2013 Rita discusses what she does at her dentist job as she runs the dental office while Dr. Feinstein is away at Cavity Con. While she does the dental work on Lola, Lori, and a reluctant Lynn Loud Sr., Rita also has to deal with some malfunctioning equipment which leads to her calling Lana in to take care of them.\n# Lisa Loud \u2013 Lisa takes a break from solving her family's problems so that she can use her brainpower to solve the greater challenges of humankind by hosting a call-in called \"Ask a Brainiac.\" Though the people who call her up are Lynn Loud Sr., Luan, Rita, Lincoln, and Lynn with their respectful questions.\n\n===Films===\n====Feature film====\nOn March 28, 2017, [[Paramount Pictures]]' president [[Marc Evans]] announced a film based on the series originally set for release on February 7, 2020 in cinemas.<ref name=\"D'Alessandro\">{{cite web|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|title=Paramount Teases Its Nickelodeon-Based Feature Toon Lineup Including \u2018The Loud House\u2019 \u2013 CinemaCon|url=http://deadline.com/2017/03/spongebob-loud-house-sherlock-gnomes-1202054433/|date=March 28, 2017|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=March 28, 2017}}</ref> However, in January 2019, Paramount removed the film from their schedule.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pedersen|first=Erik|title=Paramount Dates \u2018Crawl\u2019 & \u2018Playing With Fire\u2019, Moves \u2018Loud House\u2019 Off Schedule|url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/paramount-crawl-playing-with-fire-loud-house-release-dates-1202537734/|date=January 18, 2019|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=January 18, 2019}}</ref> On February 5, 2019, it was announced that the film would instead be produced for release on [[Netflix]].<ref name=\"Vlessing\"/> On April 30, 2019, it was announced the film will be released sometime in 2021.

Morales frequently wrestled fellow Puerto Rican [[Gypsy Joe]] on these cards, also earning wins over Jimmy Quinn, Don Savage and Sonny Fargo, while wrestling several local figures such as [[Swede Hanson (wrestler)|Swede Hanson]], Laverne Baxter and Tony Nero. The following year, Morales began visiting several more states, often teaming with different Latin [[luchadores]] such as Pepper Gonzales and [[Gory Guerrero]], while holding loose feuds with a wrestler simply known as \u201cThe Viking\u201d and Mark Starr.<ref name=\"page13\"/> As a traveling performer, he amassed mixed results, with most of his victories taking place in [[British Columbia]], where Morales defeated Tarzan Potvin, Tony Nero, Bud Rattal, Tommy O'Toole and Johnny Demchuk in a two-month period, before losing three challenges to Oliver Winrush. After a similar result in a short program with [[Hard Boiled Haggerty]], he had two draws against Allan Garfield, before defeating him on July 16, 1962.<ref name=\"page13\"/> During the following months, Morales served as a midcarder, losing to several of the high-card talents but gaining wins over jobbers such as Poncho Pico, Sputnik Monroe and winning a three-fall match over Gypsy Biviano.<ref name=\"page13\"/>\n\nIn August, Morales traveled to Texas and was involved in a series of matches with Jack and Jim Dalton, facing them along multiple tag team partners. After emerging victorious in a feud over Nelson Royal, he relocated to [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], where he wrestled  Miguel Torres, [[Angelo Savoldi]] and [[Lou Albano]], while entering into a rivalry with Tony Altomare.<ref name=\"page13\"/> It was here where he first teamed with [[Miguel P\u00e9rez (wrestler)|Miguel P\u00e9rez, Sr.]] and [[Argentina Apollo]], who were the first tag team champions recognized in the history of the [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF).

K. Paul on guitar, production, writing and mixing.\n\n===2019\u2013present: Return from hiatus and release of leaked material===\nIn 2019, the leak was made official and digitally available as ''[[Leak 04-13 (Bait Ones)]]'' to his website and streaming services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jai-paul.com/|title=Jai-Paul.com|access-date=2019-06-04}}</ref> The download included a long letter by Paul where he writes about how the music probably got leaked; 'I don't really know. I believe these particular versions of tracks may have come from a burned CD that got misplaced - a fair amount of people would have had access to my music in various forms between 2010 and 2013.'\n.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/jai-paul-returns-with-2-new-songs-listen/|title=Jai Paul Returns With 2 New Songs, Officially Drops 2013 Leaked Album|website=pitchfork.com|access-date=2019-06-04}}</ref> In the same letter, Paul also addresses the speculation about leaking the music himself: 'I was also frustrated by how all this was being framed online, leading to the widespread belief that I had decided to leak my own music, despite my record label and I saying otherwise. It didn't fit at all with anything I had done previously in style or attitude, and especially not in presentation.'\n\nHe also released two new singles, \"He\" and \"Do You Love Her Now\", as a double [[b-side]] to the ''Bait Ones'' album. This marked Paul's return from a hiatus of more than seven years after the release of his last single, \"Jasmine\".<ref name=\"p4knew2019\" /> Paul provided miscellaneous production to the [[Childish Gambino]]'s track \"Time\" featuring [[Ariana Grande]] on the album ''[[3.15.20]]'', released in March 2020.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Relationship with media and industry==\nMusic media has speculated about Paul's background, motivation and intent as he has remained out of the public eye, and his professional music career has not followed convention thus far. English publication ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'' noted Paul's distinctiveness early on, saying in 2011 \"Hype is a fascinating commodity. Where some quickly melt down the attention for liquid purpose, promising talent Jai Paul removed all his music from [[MySpace]] and went to get his shit together\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/electronic-talents-5-jai-paul  |title=Electronic Talents #5: Jai Paul |publisher=Clash Music |date=26 May 2011 |accessdate=12 June 2012}}</ref> XL Recordings founder and owner [[Richard Russell (XL Recordings)|Richard Russell]] accepts Paul's idiosyncratic style, saying \"Jai is a wizard... the way he's going about things is, I think for many, baffling.

{"title_page": "Baroque in Poland", "text_new": "{{Culture of Poland}}\n\nThe '''Polish Baroque''' lasted from the early 17th to the mid-18th century. As with [[Baroque]] style elsewhere in [[Europe]], Poland's Baroque emphasized the richness and triumphant power of contemporary art forms. In contrast to the previous, [[Renaissance]] style, which sought to depict the beauty and harmony of nature, Baroque artists strove to create their vision of the world. The result was manifold, regarded by some critics as grand and dramatic, but sometimes also chaotic and disharmonious and tinged with affectation and religious exaltation, thus reflecting [[Thirty Years' War|the turbulent times]] of the 17th-century Europe.\n\n==Baroque and Sarmatism==\n{{more|Sarmatism}}\n[[File:Portret Jakuba Narzymskiego.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Portrait of Jakub Narzymski by [[Szymon Czechowicz]], 1738]] \nThe Polish Baroque was influenced by [[Sarmatism]], the culture of the Polish nobility (''[[szlachta]]'').<ref name=mik_cul>[[Michael J.

Those Oriental influences stemmed from a large border shared by Poland with the [[Ottoman Empire]], and its frequent invasions.<ref name=mik_cul/> \n\nSarmatist thought had praised the idyllic countryside-existence, and the liberal [[Golden Freedom]] of the nobility, which stood against the [[absolute monarchy|absolute power of the monarchy]].<ref name=mik_cul/> Sarmatism stressed the military prowess going back to the times when Szlachta first emerged from the [[knight]] class; and its religious values, both associated with the historical [[Polish messianism|mission of the Polish people]] as a bastion of Christianity. Sarmatian nobles felt superior to even the nobility of the other nations, whom they considered non-free and almost enslaved by their rulers (according to Poland's constitution, the king was but the \"first among equals\"). With the progression of time, however, the Sarmatism ideals became corrupted. By the time of the 18th-century [[Enlightenment in Poland]], Sarmatism was often regarded as a backward and ultraconservative relic of the past. \n\nOn a more material realm, [[Orient]]al influences were visible in nobles' attire, arms, and decorations.<ref name=mik_cul/> New Polish costume was based on the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s robe, which spread from nobility to city dwellers and even peasants. A Polish nobleman wore long robe-like garment such as [[\u017cupan]], [[delia (clothing)|delia]], and [[kontusz]], often lined with expensive cloth; fitted with a sash belt ([[pas kontuszowy]]) and accessorized with [[knee-high boots]] from soft leather.<ref name=mik_cul/> [[Arabian horse]]s were common in [[Polish cavalry]]. During the 17th-century shaving one's head in the [[Tatar]], fashion became popular.<ref name=mik_cul/> The symbol of the noble class was the curved blade weapon, the ''[[szabla]]'', a cross between [[saber]] and [[scimitar]].<ref name=mik_cul/> Ottoman daggers, sheaths, carpets, helmets, saddles, [[klim (clothing)|klim]]s, rugs, tapestries, and embroideries were also common: what was not acquired from trade came as loot from many military conflicts along the Commonwealth southern border.<ref name=mik_cul/> The [[Manor house|manor]] (''dw\u00f3r, dworek'') of the Polish nobleman was decorated with such war trophies.<ref name=mik_cul/> Some luxury items were of domestic produce, often imitating the Orient style;<ref name=mik_cul/> most have imported from the West via Danzig ([[Gda\u0144sk]]) or from the East. Displaying one's wealth was important, and excuses were many: the [[name day]] of the [[patron saint]] as well as weddings and funerals were observed extravagantly.<ref name=mik_cul/> A distinctive art of [[coffin portrait]]s emerged during that period.<ref name=mik_cul/>\n\n==Counter-reformation==\n[[File:Siemiginowski_Allegory_of_Spring.jpg|thumb|right|[[Plafond]] ''Allegory of Spring'' by [[Jerzy Siemiginowski-Eleuter]], 1680s]]\nThe [[Roman Catholic Church]] became one of the major patrons of the arts; another was the royal house, whose patronage was most visible in the new capital of [[Warsaw]].<ref name=mik_cul/> There the pious Catholic king [[Sigismund III Vasa]] sponsored many Baroque sacral constructions. In its first phase, ecclesiastical Baroque architecture was primarily associated with the [[Jesuit Order]], who arrived in Poland in 1564, as part of the [[counter-reformation]], a trend which over the next century would triumph in Poland.<ref name=mik_cul/> The Jesuits established churches and schools in many major cities, slowly winning over the Protestant educational centers in Thorn ([[Toru\u0144]]), Danzig and Elbing ([[Elbl\u0105g]]), and [[Leszno]] (where the [[Comenius]] school of the [[Bohemian Brothers]] was located).<ref name=mik_cul/> The eventual victory of the counter-reformation in Poland would eventually be one of the reasons that would contribute to its cultural stagnation.<ref>{{in lang|en}} {{cite book |author=Robert Bideleux, Ian Jeffries|title=A history of eastern Europe: crisis and change|year=1998 |editor= |page=153|pages= |chapter=|chapterurl= |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=0-415-16112-6|url=|format= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Krak\u00f3w - Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 \u015awi\u0119tych Aposto\u0142\u00f3w Piotra i Paw\u0142a.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Saints Peter and Paul Church, Krak\u00f3w|Saints Peter and Paul Church]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]], Poland]]\n\nThe monumental castle [[Krzy\u017ctop\u00f3r]] (permanent ruin), built in the style ''palazzo in fortezza'' between 1627 and 1644, had several courtyards surrounded by fortifications.

As with [[Baroque]] style elsewhere in [[Europe]], Poland's Baroque emphasized the richness and triumphant power of contemporary art forms. In contrast to the previous, [[Renaissance]] style which sought to depict the beauty and harmony of nature, Baroque artists strove to create their own vision of the world.

Those Oriental influences stemmed from a large border shared by Poland with the [[Ottoman Empire]], and its frequent invasions.<ref name=mik_cul/> \n\nSarmatist thought had praised the idyllic countryside-existence, and the liberal [[Golden Freedom]] of the nobility, which stood against the [[absolute monarchy|absolute power of the monarchy]].<ref name=mik_cul/> Sarmatism stressed the military prowess going back to the times when szlachta first emerged from the [[knight]] class; and its religious values, both associated with the historical [[Polish messianism|mission of the Polish people]] as a bastion of Christianity. Sarmatian nobles felt superior to even the nobility of the other nations, whom they considered non-free and almost enslaved by their rulers (according to Poland's constitution, the king was but the \"first among equals\"). With the progression of time, however, the Sarmatism ideals became corrupted. By the time of the 18th-century [[Enlightenment in Poland]], Sarmatism was often regarded as a backward and ultraconservative relic of the past. \n\nOn a more material realm, [[Orient]]al influences were visible in nobles' attire, arms, and decorations.<ref name=mik_cul/> New Polish costume was based on the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s robe, which spread from nobility to city dwellers and even peasants. A Polish nobleman wore long robe-like garment such as [[\u017cupan]], [[delia (clothing)|delia]], and [[kontusz]], often lined with expensive cloth; fitted with a sash belt ([[pas kontuszowy]]) and accessorized with [[knee-high boots]] from soft leather.<ref name=mik_cul/> [[Arabian horse]]s were common in [[Polish cavalry]]. During the 17th century shaving one's head in the [[Tatar]] fashion became popular.<ref name=mik_cul/> The symbol of the noble class was the curved blade weapon, the ''[[szabla]]'', a cross between [[saber]] and [[scimitar]].<ref name=mik_cul/> Ottoman daggers, sheaths, carpets, helmets, saddles, [[klim (clothing)|klim]]s, rugs, tapestries and embroideries were also common: what was not acquired from trade came as loot from many military conflicts along the Commonwealth southern border.<ref name=mik_cul/> The [[Manor house|manor]] (''dw\u00f3r, dworek'') of the Polish nobleman was decorated with such war trophies.<ref name=mik_cul/> Some luxury items were of domestic produce, often imitating the Orient style;<ref name=mik_cul/> most were imported from the West via Danzig ([[Gda\u0144sk]]) or from the East. Displaying one's wealth was important, and excuses were many: the [[name day]] of the [[patron saint]] as well as weddings and funerals were observed in extravagant fashion.<ref name=mik_cul/> A distinctive art of [[coffin portrait]]s emerged during that period.<ref name=mik_cul/>\n\n==Counter-reformation==\n[[File:Siemiginowski_Allegory_of_Spring.jpg|thumb|right|[[Plafond]] ''Allegory of Spring'' by [[Jerzy Siemiginowski-Eleuter]], 1680s]]\nThe [[Roman Catholic Church]] became one of the major patrons of the arts; another was the royal house, whose patronage was most visible in the new capital of [[Warsaw]].<ref name=mik_cul/> There the pious Catholic king [[Sigismund III Vasa]] sponsored many Baroque sacral constructions.
