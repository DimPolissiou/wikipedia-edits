Separate [[GAA county|county boards]] are responsible for the promotion & development of [[Gaelic handball|handball]], [[camogie]] and [[ladies' Gaelic football]] within the county as well as having responsibility for their representative inter-county players/teams. The current team sponsor of Monaghan GAA is Investec.\n\n==Gaelic football==\n\n===History===\nGaelic football was recorded in Inniskeen in 1706 in a poem. Monaghan were prominent in Ulster championship competitions during the period 1914-30 and one of the first Ulster counties to contest an All Ireland final .\n\nMonaghan beat [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]] in a semi-final to reach the [[1930 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]], where [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] beat them by 3-11 to 0-2 without their goalkeeper touching the ball.\n\nIn 1979 the Monaghan team won the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]] for the first time in 41 years with a defeat of [[Donegal GAA|Donegal]]. In the final Monaghan Kieran Finlay scored 1-09, which was a record in an Ulster final for 20 years, until [[Armagh GAA|Armagh]]'s Oisin McConville bettered it with a 2-07 tally against [[Down GAA|Down]] in 1999. They also won the [[Dr McKenna Cup]] in 1979. Victories in the Ceannarus Tournament against [[Roscommon GAA|Roscommon]] and [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] in 1979 brought gloss to the county's finest year on the football field in almost half a century. In the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship 1979]] semi-final at [[Croke Park]], Monaghan were again beaten by Kerry, 5-14 to 0-07.\n\nIn 1984 the Centenary Cup final was reached following wins over [[Limerick GAA|Limerick]], [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]], [[Offaly GAA|Offaly]] (quarter final) and [[Derry GAA|Derry]] (semi-final after extra time) The Offaly and Derry games were played in Croke Park as was the final against [[Meath GAA|Meath]] which Monaghan lost by 0-10 to 0-08. Monaghan also won Division 3 of the National Football League that year and lost to Meath in the quarterfinal.\n\n1985 was the county's most successful year to date when a National Football League final victory against Armagh in 1985 created a momentum that peaked in 1985 when future Monaghan manager [[Eamonn McEneaney]] kicked one of the most spectacular equalizing points in many years from 48 metres out near the sideline beside the Hogan stand to draw the thrilling All Ireland semi-final against [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] on a scoreline of Monaghan 2-09 to Kerry's 1-12. Kerry won the replay on a 2-09 to 0-10 score.\n\nThat National football league title of 1985 was won by Monaghan on a 1-11 to 0-09 score against pre-match favourites Armagh. The game was effectively settled by an Eamon McEneaney penalty in the first half when referee John Gough from Antrim decided that an Armagh defender had taken too many steps in his own penalty area. Armagh got to within a point in the second half but a flurry of exceptional long range points from Bernie Murray, Eamon McEneaney and Ray McCarron brought the trophy to Monaghan for the first time ever.\n\nThat year's Ulster Senior Football Championship was also a stirring success. An easy first round victory over Donegal in [[Castleblayney]], marked by a spectacular Eamon Murphy goal, followed by a lucky draw against Armagh in the semi final and one-point victory in the replay saw Monaghan meet Derry in the Ulster Senior Football Championship final. The first day against Armagh, Monaghan relied on pure luck to survive for a draw, as Armagh dominated the game from start to finish, doing everything but score. Paddy Linden saved a penalty, while and Armagh player saw the line barely 30 seconds after coming onto the field as a substitute, following an apparent high tackle on Declan Flanagan. The replay was a better match but a late Armagh goal had Monaghan concerned. However they won by 1-11 to 2-07.\n\nIn the Ulster final against Derry Eamon McEneaney helped himself to 2-04 as Monaghan recorded and easy 2-09 to 0-08 win. As stated the drawn All-Ireland semi-final against Kerry was a thriller but the absence of David Byrne through injury in the second half probably cost Monaghan victory. Eamon McEneaney's last gasp equaliser was something special but in the replay Kerry were ruthless and despite serious Monaghan pressure the Kingdom won by 5 points. Monaghan's run that year was something special considering the fact that they were missing Declan Loughman, Gerry Hoey and Bernie Murray (all with broken legs). All three were prominent in the National Football League win over Armagh while they would form the spine of the Ulster Senior Football Championship winning side of 1988. It could be argued that with these three players on board, Monaghan could have won the All-Ireland in 1985. Certainly their absence robbed the team of vital strength in depth.\n\nThey reached the 1986 National Football League final but this time the opposition was [[Laois GAA|Laois]]. Played in front of over 30,000 supporters the Laoismen edged out Monaghan by 2-06 to 2-05. Monaghan's championship run in 1986 consisted of a draw against [[Down GAA|Down]] in Castleblayney thanks to a last gap Eamon McEneaney free while in the replay Down emerged victors in Newcastle on a 2-11 to 0-11 score. A promising season was over before it had begun.\n\nIn 1987, Monaghan reached the National Football League semi-final again where they played out a thrilling game against Kerry at [[Croke Park]]. A superb second half performance against the wind had Monaghan leading by a couple of points near the end but a [[Pat Spillane]] goal and a late point by Mikey Sheehy saw the Kingdom win by 2-11 to 2-09. Monaghan's goals came from Mick O'Dowd and Hugo Clerkin. Disappointment followed in the Ulster championship with a shock 0-14 to 0-12 loss to [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]] in [[Breffni Park]]. The early promise of 1985 looked over as two successive seasons of flattering to deceive left the county in a state of gloom.\n\nIn 1988, the team reached the National Football League semi-final again but ended in a 4-12 to 1-08 drubbing from Dublin at Croke Park. However a good league run prior to that had rescued a season where relegation to Division 2 of the National Football League looked a distinct possibility. A change in management during that league run also added to the merit of the achievement. The 1988 All Ireland semi-final against [[Cork GAA|Cork]] was even less memorable. Monaghan were holding out against a gale-force wind in the first half and were 0-08 to 0-01 behind at the break. Goalkeeper Paddy Linden had saved a penalty from Larry Tompkins. Two early second half points brought Monaghan to within 5 points. A highly controversial goal following an apparent foul on Monaghan's Brendan Murray rocked the Monaghan revival and Cork took over. Linden's display in that match was a significant factor in him being the first Ulster goalkeeper to receive an All-star award that year. As stated the game was decided when Cork scored a dubious goal and the All-Ireland dream died again. With that defeat, the successful team of the mid 80s started to break up.\n\nHowever 1988 will be remembered for the Ulster title win over [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]] when a \"Nudie\" Hughes goal following a fumble by Tyrone keeper Aidan Skelton saw Monaghan win by 1-10 to 0-11. An interesting facet of this particular game was that all Monaghan's scores came from play. Previous wins over [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]] (0-16 to 0-14), again marked by a 5 star performance from Nudie Hughes and [[Down GAA|Down]] (1-11 to 0-09) had brought Monaghan to the Ulster final.\n\nIn 1989 Monaghan scraped home with an 0-08 to 0-05 win against [[Antrim GAA|Antrim]] in [[Casement Park]], [[Belfast]], where the homesters literally kicked the game away. Down ended Monaghan's run in Castleblayney a few weeks later.\n\nThe 1990s and early part of the 2000s were lean years for the county. Notable wins in that period were championship successes over Donegal in 1995 and defending All-Ireland champions Armagh in 2003. They won the [[Dr McKenna Cup]] in 1995 against Derry and in 2003 against Tyrone.\n\nAnother noticeable effort was a dramatic second half display against Derry in 1992, which saw a 9-point deficit hauled back to earn a draw. Wins were also recorded over [[Antrim GAA|Antrim]] in 1990 and [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]] in 1993 and 1994. After losses to [[Fermanagh GAA|Fermanagh]] in 1999 and 2000, a win over them was recorded in 2001.\n\nThe [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] run of 1998 was also memorable for Monaghan when they surprisingly qualified from a \"group of death\" that included [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]], [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]], [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]], [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]] and [[Sligo GAA|Sligo]] to qualify for the quarter-finals against [[Down GAA|Down]] in Croke Park. Behind at one stage early in the second half by 1-05 to 0-02, the Down goal scored by James Mc Cartan, a rousing rally with goals by Darren Swift and Stephen Mc Ginnitty and a spectacular individual point by Peter Duffy saw Monaghan cause a mild surprise with a 2-05 to 1-06 win. The semi final against [[Derry GAA|Derry]] was less memorable and defeat on a score of 1-12 to 0-08 was the result. The game had a bit of controversy too when a Mark Daly goal was disallowed and a Monaghan player was sent off. It set the tone for a niggly [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]] meeting between both sides a few weeks later. Monaghan's Edwin Murphy was sent off on the advice of a linesman but video evidence subsequently cleared him. However it didn't stop Monaghan suffering a heavy defeat on the day to Derry.\n\n1999 was even less memorable at senior level, the big highlight being the county U-21 side winning the Ulster championship with a final success over Donegal thanks to a last gasp super point from Kieran Tavey. The run ended with a 2-10 to 0-08 defeat to eventual champions [[Westmeath GAA|Westmeath]] in Croke Park.\n\nAt minor level there was an upsurge in fortunes with the county U-18 team reaching the Ulster minor league finals in 2000 and 2002 losing to Tyrone on both occasions by a point. The Ulster championship final was reached in 2001 for the first time in 18 years when a splendid effort fell short with a 2-13 to 0-13 defeat again to Tyrone. A missed penalty late on when only 4 points separated the sides was a big blow, however on reflection it was Monaghan's misfortune to meet Tyrone sides that would backbone their senior All-Ireland winning sides of 2003 and 2005. In 2001 the counties Vocational Schools team won the Ulster and All-Ireland championships.\n\n2005 was another memorable year for the county when they contested the Division 2 National Football League final against [[Meath GAA|Meath]] at Croke Park. However it took a last gasp point from Paul Finlay in the final league game against [[Longford GAA|Longford]] in Clones to earn a draw and automatic promotion to Division 1 for the first time in 18 years. The league semi final against Derry in Clones was also a thriller from a Monaghan perspective. A goal within 15 seconds of the throw in by Tommy Freeman set Monaghan on their way and despite Rory Woods being sent off Monaghan held out for a 1-13 to 1-11 win.\n\nThe NFL Division 2 final was a thrilling ding dong battle between two well match sides and was full of top drawer scores. It had the 40,000+ crowd on their feet from start to finish. Fortunes ebbed and flowed between both sides and in injury time [[Meath GAA|Meath]] looked like holding onto a 2-point victory. However a Paul Finlay free with the last kick of the game (sounds familiar) from 40 yards out was deflected into the Meath net by a Meath player and Monaghan edged out 3-13 to 3-12 winners. This game preceded the National Football League final which saw Armagh overcome [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]] to gain their first league title. This marked Monaghan's first visit to Croke Park in 7 years, that resulting in a 1-12 to 0-08 defeat in a National Football League semi-final to Derry back in 1998.\n\nDerry gained revenge in the Ulster Senior Football Championship with a 1-17 to 2-08 win, but \"back door\" wins over [[London GAA|London]], [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]] and [[Louth GAA|Louth]] brought Monaghan to a last 12 meeting with eventual All-Ireland champions Tyrone in Croke Park. In a very entertaining game the tactic of isolating [[Tom\u00e1s Freeman|Tommy Freeman]] up front caused havoc for Tyrone in the first 25 minutes as they leaked 1-05, the goal a spectacular effort from Freeman. However a shrewd management move from Tyrone resulted in a player being brought back to double mark Freeman and the Farney threat was quashed. On the day Monaghan had no plan \"B\" and Tyrone took over. They ran out flattering 2-14 to 1-07 winners in the end, limiting Monaghan to a single point from a free in the second half. All the pre-match hype surrounded the question as to whether or not Tyrone's [[Ryan McMenamin]] would be playing, having been suspended following an incident in the Ulster final. He missed the game but later returned for the quarter-final against [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]]. Freeman's exploits in the summer of 2005 brought him an All-star nomination and an \"Irish News\" Ulster All star award on the \"40\".\n\n2006 saw Monaghan compete in Division 1A of the National Football League but apart from a win over [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] and a draw with [[Offaly GAA|Offaly]], there was little else to celebrate despite battling displays against Kerry and Tyrone and relegation followed in the spring. The season ended in the championship qualifiers with a desperately poor display against [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]] resulting in an 0-08 to 0-06 defeat. The [[Dr McKenna Cup]] final was also reached early in the year but ended in a heavy defeat by Tyrone. The Ulster championship started with a 0-10 to 0-10 draw against eventual Ulster champions Armagh in rain soaked Clones. Six days later Armagh emerged victorious on a 1-13 to 0-10 score, the main difference between the sides being that Armagh took their chances and Monaghan didn't. Two missed goal opportunities on the day proved costly. A 2-19 to 3-05 win over Wicklow in the qualifiers saw Monaghan meet Wexford in Clones in what was probably the worst game of 2006. The continuous rain and wet conditions didn't help but it was the performance of the referee that grabbed the headlines on the day. Wexford who had Matty Forde controversially on board following an incident against Offaly for which he would be subsequently suspended won out by 0-08 to 0-06 and thus Monaghan's year ended on a dismal note.\n\n====2007====\n2007 saw Monaghan compete in Division 2A of the National Football League. A backroom clean out of trainers and selectors didn't augur well but the introduction of Tyrone native Martin Mc Elkennon to the Oriel set up proved to be a master stroke by Seamus Mc Eneaney for the year ahead. A straight run of seven successive victories in matches away to [[Roscommon GAA|Roscommon]] and home to [[Longford GAA|Longford]] and Carlow and away to Clare and away trips to [[London GAA|London]] and home to [[Offaly GAA|Offaly]] and away to Leitrim were fashioned out of great work ethic and spirit and no little skill.  The semi-final match is against [[Meath GAA|Meath]]. The Ulster Championship saw Monaghan play in the quarter final against the winners of [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]] and [[Down GAA|Down]]; who meet in the preliminary round. If successful there they would play the winners of [[Derry GAA|Derry]] and [[Antrim GAA|Antrim]] in the semi-final. Having avoided the \"big 2\" namely [[Armagh GAA|Armagh]] and [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]], this was viewed as Monaghan's best chance of reaching an Ulster final for the first time in 19 years. However, in recent seasons they had flattered to deceive and have disappointed their supporters when something big was expected from them. This was a big year for the Farney county. Monaghan reached the [[Dr McKenna Cup]] semi-final where they suffered a heavy defeat to [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]] under floodlights in [[Kingspan Breffni Park]], [[Cavan]] on 13 February 2007. They had initially qualified from Section A of the competition as runners up to [[Armagh GAA|Armagh]].\n\n====National Football League Division 2A====\nMonaghan enjoyed a fantastic run in the National Football League, winning all their 7 games. The platforms for both successes against Roscommon, Longford and Carlow were excellent first half displays where big scoring returns were racked up. The second half display against Clare was probably the best of the season so far. Next up was an away trip to London which Monaghan easily won by 0-16 to 1-05. The game against Offaly in the penultimate round in Clones could well be called the defining match in the group. As it turned out it was and a last gasp Paul Meegan point in injury time was enough to give Monaghan a 0-13 to 0-12 win, guaranteeing them a semi final place as table toppers and an all important position in the revamped Division 2 in 2008. This was achieved with a game in hand against Leitrim which was scheduled for 15 April and won by Monaghan on a 1-14 to 2-10 score. The league semi-final against Meath was played in Croke Park and it was a disaster for the Farney men as two early Meath goals gave them a cushion that they built a winning platform on. Despite the early concession of 2 goals within the first 3 minutes Monaghan dominated and could have been in front at half time but instead went in 2-04 to 0-05 in arrears. The concession of a third goal early in the second half settled matters and despite a late Monaghan rally Meath emerged winners on a 3-10 to 0-12 score. This game asked more questions than it answered and it was obvious from this game that Monaghan's full back line and team in general needed a major overhaul prior to the Ulster championship meeting against Down in Newry on 10 June.\n\n====Ulster Senior Football Championship====\nP\u00e1irc Esler in Newry was the venue for Monaghan's first game of the Ulster championship where they faced a Down team who had disposed of Cavan in the preliminary round after a replay. This was the day Ciar\u00e1n Hanratty announced his arrival on the county stage with a 2-goal salvo which inspired Monaghan to a 2-15 to 1-15 success. The defence had tightened up considerably and a couple of late fantastic points by Paul \"Jap\" Finlay near the end were other highlights in a resolute display in front of 17,000 vocal onlookers. The semi final against Derry in [[Casement Park]] on 24 June was also another triumph for Monaghan as they easily defeated [[Derry GAA|Derry]] by 0-14 to 1-09. The scoreline doesn't in any reflect Monaghan's superiority on the day as they stuck to a rigid game plan and easily disposed of a fancied Derry side. The news that Paul Finlay wouldn't play any part due to illness proved no handicap to Monaghan and his replacement Rory Woods game a tigerish display on the \"45\" bringing much needed bulk and skill to trouble Derry's vaunted defence. The only disappointment on the day was the lack of credit given to the victors as the media seemed to concentrate solely on Derry's poor display when in fact credit should be given to Monaghan for playing them off the green carpet that was Casement Park.\nThe final set for 15 July in the home of Ulster football that is [[Clones, County Monaghan|Clones]] was between Monaghan and [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]], ironically the same pairing as 1988 when Monaghan recorded their last [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]] success and final appearance. Tyrone were favourites in everyone's eyes for this game but in the Oriel county there was an inner belief that their side could upset the formbook and win a title that seemed so unlikely in January 2007. Sales of Monaghan jerseys, flags and anything white and blue went through the roof as the county lit up in anticipation of a great day out. The question on everyone's lips was whether or not Paul Finlay would be cleared by the medical experts to play some part on a stage he was born to grace. He was awaiting results for a viral infection and up to the throw in no-one apart from the doctors treating him, the team management, players and Finlay's family was sure what the diagnosis was. Monaghan folk crossed their fingers in the hope this talented lad would get his chance to play in an Ulster senior football final- an arena he deserved to be part of. In the end Finlay started the match: a match which [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]] won by a scoreline of 1-15 to 1-13. However the scoreline doesn't tell the story of a cracking match which at one stage had Monaghan trailing by 8 points. A cracking goal by Philip Jordan after 6 minutes put Tyrone in the driving seat but slowly and surely Monaghan came back to trail by 1-08 to 0-07 at half time. Another strong Tyrone rally at the start of the second half put Tyrone on their way. Monaghan goaled in the 51st minute through Tommy Freeman and a succession of high balls on a beleaguered Tyrone defence saw Monaghan plunder the scores to leave just 3 points in it going into injury time. Monaghan had numerous chances to level the game but they had to settle for an injury time point from converted full back Vincent Corey whose switch from No. 3 to No 14 was the catalyst for the Farney fightback. Alas it was a case of too little too late and Tyrone edged out winners by 2 points.\n\n'''Ulster Senior Football Championship 2013'''\nIn the 2013 championship, Monaghan were handed a \"favorable\" draw. They were drawn against Antrim in the first round in Casement Park, Belfast. Monaghan had previously brushed aside the Antrim men in the National League. Monaghan started shakily and took a while to get going. They survived some scares but the free taking of Conor McManus powered them over the line 0-11 to 0-6. In the Ulster semi final Monaghan were pitted against local neighbours Cavan. The game was a tight affair with both teams trading scores tit for tat. In the end it finished on a score of 1-11 to 0-13. Coming into the final Monaghan faced the reigning Ulster and All Ireland Champions, Donegal. Nobody had given Monaghan a hope coming into the final but the Farney men took the Tir Chonaill boys by surprise rushing into a 4-0 lead while also keeping Donegal scoreless for 32 minutes. Drew Wylie and Colin Walshe were outstanding marking Colm McFadden and Paddy Mcbrearty respectively. At half time Monaghan led 05-02. Despite the 3 point advantage Donegal were still much fancied but Kieran Hughes stuck over 3 quick points in succession to buffer the Farney Men's advantage. With Vinny Corey's rough housing of Michael Murphy, Donegal failed to get going. Monaghan beat Donegal at their own game using the blanket defence system while Darren Hughes and Conor McManus remained outstanding. It was tight up until the last 10 minutes when Monaghan added some scores to put a gloss on the scoreline. Tommy Freeman one of the greatest servants of Monaghan coming off the bench and firing over the last point. At the end of the game Monaghan had won their first Ulster Senior Football Championship in 25 years. This result was coupled with the Minors superb comeback win earlier in the day defeating Tyrone to complete an historic double. At the final whistle there were scenes of unrivaled joy as Owen Lennon lifted the Anglo Celt Cup as no Monaghan Captain had done for 25 years.\n\n====All-Ireland qualifiers====\nIt was the qualifiers next and Monaghan were drawn against Donegal in Healy Park in Omagh. This was probably Monaghan's finest display of the year as they humiliated the National League Division One champions by 8 points in a game they dominated from start to finish. Superb displays by Dessie Mone, Eoin Lennon, Tommy Freeman and man of the match Vincent Corey were chief factors in a 2-12 to 1-07 win which saw the Donegal manager retire afterwards but in August 2007 it appeared as if he may rescind that decision according to newspaper reports. Donegal on the night had simply no answer to Monaghan's power, passion, poise and frightening will to win as the T\u00edr Chonnail men reverted to type and fell away long before the end.\n\n====All-Ireland quarter-final====\nThe quarter final draws were made as Monaghan entered this arena for the first time since the qualifiers were started. They were drawn against [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] and Croke Park was named as the venue as part of a triple header involving a minor hurling semi final involving Tipperary and Kilkenny and a senior hurling semi-final involving Waterford and Limerick.\n\nThe game was fixed for 12 August 2007, almost 22 years to the day that Eamon Mc Eneaney earned his place in Monaghan folklore for a massive equalising point against the same opposition who were as now defending all-Ireland champions. Monaghan were raging outsiders against the Kingdom where the defending champions were odds on to stroll to a semi final against Dublin. Monaghan started on fire with points from Rory Woods and Tommy Freeman. A 7th-minute penalty was awarded to Monaghan when Ci\u00e1ran Hanratty was dragged down whilst bearing in on the Kerry goals. Tommy Freeman coolly stuck the ball away to give Monaghan a commanding lead in front of 80,000 spellbound spectators. However Kerry fought back to parity at the interval on a 0-08 to 1-05 score.\n\nThe second half was a thrilling affair and despite the concession of a slack goal Monaghan led by 2 points entering the final 8 minutes. However a combination of panic and inexperience both on the field and on the line told as Kerry fought back to level terms and go a point in front with a minute left. Monaghan strived might and main for an equalising point but a series of missed passes and downright hard luck proved to be their downfall. It ended in heartbreak on a score of Kerry 1-12, Monaghan 1-11.\n\nA standing ovation was given by the Monaghan supporters to a team that in the words of their manager had left everything they had on the pitch. They gave their all but just came up short. That ended Monaghan's run of 2007 but in terms of the previous 2 decades what a run it was. The county was buzzing again, everywhere was a sea of blue and white and people were proud of their team once more.\n\nAfterwards manager [[S\u00e9amus McEnaney]] vowed they would be back again in 2008 and as a unit all Monaghan folk hoped they would be, especially team coach/trainer Martin Mc Elkennon, who brought this group from a bunch of also-rans to a team of great potential. On reflection this game was one that got away as it was there for the taking. The only plus was that it meant we were good enough to have beaten anyone in Ireland but Kerry. It also showed this group of players that they could indeed compete with the best.\n\nKerry though went back home to the south to prepare for a semi-final meeting with Dublin on 26 August which they duly won by 1-15 to 0-16 to qualify for the final against Munster rivals Cork. This turned out to be a complete mismatch as the Kingdom crushed a very weak Rebel side without ever slipping into top gear.\n\nThe eventual champions were quoted many times in the immediate aftermath that their joust with Monaghan had brought them on in leaps and bounds and steeled them sufficiently for the tests against Dublin and Cork. For Monaghan it was a case of a lot done and more to do. Martin Mc Elkennon had the team in superb shape, a fact that received comments from throughout the country. Hopes were high that he would stay on board for 2008 as he was the key to success.\n\nThe hopes of the county were realised when Mc Eneaney, Mc Elkennon and Trappe decided to stay on board for 2008 and this was ratified by the county committee in September 2007. The only retiree was kit man Michael Mc Kenna who stepped down for work reasons. A big miss to a solid team. Mc Eneaney promised to freshen things up and raise the bar again for 2008, a year that Monaghan fans are looking forward to with relish. The year finished with Monaghan being awarded 7 Irish News Ulster GAA all-stars but more significantly a Vodafone All-star award for Thomas Freeman at right corner forward. As well as that he was chosen as the Irish News and Ulster GAA writers Ulster Gaelic football player of the year. Manager Seamus Mc Eneaney picked up the Ulster GAA writers personality of the year award as well to end 2007 on a high note.\n\n===Current football squad===\n*[[Manager (Gaelic games)|Manager]]: S\u00e9amus McEnaney\n*[[Selector ()|Selectors]]: Conor Laverty, David McCague, and Ray Boyne\n*[[Strength and conditioning coach|Strength & Conditioning coach]]: Peter Donnelly\n{{GAA squad start}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=1|pos=Goalkeeper|name=[[Rory Beggan]]|club=[[Scotstown GAA|Scotstown]]}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=2|pos=Right Corner Back|name=Kieran Duffy|club=Latton}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=3|pos=Full Back|name=Drew Wylie|club=[[Ballybay Pearse Brothers GFC|Ballybay Pearse Brothers]]}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=4|pos=Left Corner Back|name=Ryan Wylie|club=[[Ballybay Pearse Brothers GFC|Ballybay Pearse Brothers]]}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=5|pos=Right Half Back|name=[[Colin Walshe]] ([[Captain (sports)|c]])|club=Doohamlet}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=6|pos=Centre Back|name=Vinny Corey|club=[[Clontibret O'Neills]]}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=7|pos=Left Half Back|name=[[Karl O'Connell]]|club=Tyholland}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=8|pos=Midfield|name=Niall Kearns|club=Se\u00e1n McDermott's}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=9|pos=Midfield|name=[[Darren Hughes (Gaelic footballer)|Darren Hughes]] |club=[[Scotstown GAA|Scotstown]]}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=10|pos=Right Half Forward|name=Ryan McAnespie|club=Emyvale}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=11|pos=Centre Half Forward|name=Shane Carey|club=[[Scotstown GAA|Scotstown]]}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=12|pos=Left Half Forward|name=Dessie Mone|club=[[Clontibret O'Neills]]}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=13|pos=Right Corner Forward|name=Dermot Malone|club=[[Castleblayney Faugh's GAC|Castleblayney]]}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=14|pos=Full Forward|name=Fintan Kelly|club=Clones}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=15|pos=Left Corner Forward|name=[[Conor McManus]]|club=[[Clontibret O'Neills]]}}\n{{GAA squad mid}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=16|pos=Substitute|name=Conor Forde|club=[[Scotstown GAA|Scotstown]]}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=17|pos=Substitute|name=Conor Boyle|club=[[Clontibret O'Neills]]}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=18|pos=Substitute|name=Barry Kerr|club=Cremartin}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=19|pos=Substitute|name=Dessie Ward|club=[[Ballybay Pearse Brothers GFC|Ballybay Pearse Brothers]]}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=20|pos=Substitute|name=Neil McAdam|club=Monaghan Harps}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=21|pos=Substitute|name=Kieran Hughes|club=[[Scotstown GAA|Scotstown]]}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=22|pos=Substitute|name=Owen Duffy|club=Latton}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=23|pos=Substitute|name=Paudie McKenna|club=Truagh}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=24|pos=Substitute|name=Conor McCarthy|club=[[Scotstown GAA|Scotstown]]}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=25|pos=Substitute|name=Jack McCarron|club=Currin}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=26|pos=Substitute|name=David Garland|club=Donaghmoyne}}\n{{GAA squad end}}\nSquad as per Monaghan v [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]], [[2018 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] Semi Final, {{as of|2018|08|12|lc=y}}\n\n===Under 21s===\nThe under-21 side also managed by the senior team management reached the Ulster final following emphatic wins against [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]] and [[Fermanagh GAA|Fermanagh]] respectively.

Other notable Monaghan Handball players include Darren Doherty who has achieved several major titles over the last 10+ years. The sport of handball continues to grow within the county, with most [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] clubs providing [[GAA Handball]] facilities, namely in the form of 40x20, Wallball/One-wall and/or 60x30 handball courts. New handball courts have been built in recent years with Truagh Gaels GAA Club (new 40x20 court), Scotstown GAA Club (new Wallball court) & Bawn GAA Handball Club (new 40x20 court) all building new courts respectively. Additionally, [[St Macartan's College]] have recently refurbished their handball courts, boasting the only combined dual 60x30 and 40x20 handball courts facility in Ireland.

Separate [[GAA county|county boards]] are responsible for the promotion & development of [[Gaelic handball|handball]], [[camogie]] and [[ladies' Gaelic football]] within the county as well as having responsibility for their representative inter-county players/teams. The current team sponsor of Monaghan GAA is Investec.\n\n==Gaelic football==\n\n===History===\nGaelic football was recorded in Inniskeen in 1706 in a poem. Monaghan were prominent in Ulster championship competitions during the period 1914-30 and one of the first Ulster counties to contest an All Ireland final .\n\nMonaghan beat [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]] in a semi-final to reach the [[1930 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]], where [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] beat them by 3-11 to 0-2 without their goalkeeper touching the ball.\n\nIn 1979 the Monaghan team won the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]] for the first time in 41 years with a defeat of [[Donegal GAA|Donegal]]. In the final Monaghan Kieran Finlay scored 1-09, which was a record in an Ulster final for 20 years, until [[Armagh GAA|Armagh]]'s Oisin McConville bettered it with a 2-07 tally against [[Down GAA|Down]] in 1999. They also won the [[Dr McKenna Cup]] in 1979. Victories in the Ceannarus Tournament against [[Roscommon GAA|Roscommon]] and [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] in 1979 brought gloss to the county's finest year on the football field in almost half a century. In the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship 1979]] semi-final at [[Croke Park]], Monaghan were again beaten by Kerry, 5-14 to 0-07.\n\nIn 1984 the Centenary Cup final was reached following wins over [[Limerick GAA|Limerick]], [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]], [[Offaly GAA|Offaly]] (quarter final) and [[Derry GAA|Derry]] (semi-final after extra time) The Offaly and Derry games were played in Croke Park as was the final against [[Meath GAA|Meath]] which Monaghan lost by 0-10 to 0-08. Monaghan also won Division 3 of the National Football League that year and lost to Meath in the quarterfinal.\n\n1985 was the county's most successful year to date when a National Football League final victory against Armagh in 1985 created a momentum that peaked in 1985 when future Monaghan manager [[Eamonn McEneaney]] kicked one of the most spectacular equalizing points in many years from 48 metres out near the sideline beside the Hogan stand to draw the thrilling All Ireland semi-final against [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] on a scoreline of Monaghan 2-09 to Kerry's 1-12. Kerry won the replay on a 2-09 to 0-10 score.\n\nThat National football league title of 1985 was won by Monaghan on a 1-11 to 0-09 score against pre-match favourites Armagh. The game was effectively settled by an Eamon McEneaney penalty in the first half when referee John Gough from Antrim decided that an Armagh defender had taken too many steps in his own penalty area. Armagh got to within a point in the second half but a flurry of exceptional long range points from Bernie Murray, Eamon McEneaney and Ray McCarron brought the trophy to Monaghan for the first time ever.\n\nThat year's Ulster Senior Football Championship was also a stirring success. An easy first round victory over Donegal in [[Castleblayney]], marked by a spectacular Eamon Murphy goal, followed by a lucky draw against Armagh in the semi final and one-point victory in the replay saw Monaghan meet Derry in the Ulster Senior Football Championship final. The first day against Armagh, Monaghan relied on pure luck to survive for a draw, as Armagh dominated the game from start to finish, doing everything but score. Paddy Linden saved a penalty, while and Armagh player saw the line barely 30 seconds after coming onto the field as a substitute, following an apparent high tackle on Declan Flanagan. The replay was a better match but a late Armagh goal had Monaghan concerned. However they won by 1-11 to 2-07.\n\nIn the Ulster final against Derry Eamon McEneaney helped himself to 2-04 as Monaghan recorded and easy 2-09 to 0-08 win. As stated the drawn All-Ireland semi-final against Kerry was a thriller but the absence of David Byrne through injury in the second half probably cost Monaghan victory. Eamon McEneaney's last gasp equaliser was something special but in the replay Kerry were ruthless and despite serious Monaghan pressure the Kingdom won by 5 points. Monaghan's run that year was something special considering the fact that they were missing Declan Loughman, Gerry Hoey and Bernie Murray (all with broken legs). All three were prominent in the National Football League win over Armagh while they would form the spine of the Ulster Senior Football Championship winning side of 1988. It could be argued that with these three players on board, Monaghan could have won the All-Ireland in 1985. Certainly their absence robbed the team of vital strength in depth.\n\nThey reached the 1986 National Football League final but this time the opposition was [[Laois GAA|Laois]]. Played in front of over 30,000 supporters the Laoismen edged out Monaghan by 2-06 to 2-05. Monaghan's championship run in 1986 consisted of a draw against [[Down GAA|Down]] in Castleblayney thanks to a last gap Eamon McEneaney free while in the replay Down emerged victors in Newcastle on a 2-11 to 0-11 score. A promising season was over before it had begun.\n\nIn 1987, Monaghan reached the National Football League semi-final again where they played out a thrilling game against Kerry at [[Croke Park]]. A superb second half performance against the wind had Monaghan leading by a couple of points near the end but a [[Pat Spillane]] goal and a late point by Mikey Sheehy saw the Kingdom win by 2-11 to 2-09. Monaghan's goals came from Mick O'Dowd and Hugo Clerkin. Disappointment followed in the Ulster championship with a shock 0-14 to 0-12 loss to [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]] in [[Breffni Park]]. The early promise of 1985 looked over as two successive seasons of flattering to deceive left the county in a state of gloom.\n\nIn 1988, the team reached the National Football League semi-final again but ended in a 4-12 to 1-08 drubbing from Dublin at Croke Park. However a good league run prior to that had rescued a season where relegation to Division 2 of the National Football League looked a distinct possibility. A change in management during that league run also added to the merit of the achievement. The 1988 All Ireland semi-final against [[Cork GAA|Cork]] was even less memorable. Monaghan were holding out against a gale-force wind in the first half and were 0-08 to 0-01 behind at the break. Goalkeeper Paddy Linden had saved a penalty from Larry Tompkins. Two early second half points brought Monaghan to within 5 points. A highly controversial goal following an apparent foul on Monaghan's Brendan Murray rocked the Monaghan revival and Cork took over. Linden's display in that match was a significant factor in him being the first Ulster goalkeeper to receive an All-star award that year. As stated the game was decided when Cork scored a dubious goal and the All-Ireland dream died again. With that defeat, the successful team of the mid 80s started to break up.\n\nHowever 1988 will be remembered for the Ulster title win over [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]] when a \"Nudie\" Hughes goal following a fumble by Tyrone keeper Aidan Skelton saw Monaghan win by 1-10 to 0-11. An interesting facet of this particular game was that all Monaghan's scores came from play. Previous wins over [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]] (0-16 to 0-14), again marked by a 5 star performance from Nudie Hughes and [[Down GAA|Down]] (1-11 to 0-09) had brought Monaghan to the Ulster final.\n\nIn 1989 Monaghan scraped home with an 0-08 to 0-05 win against [[Antrim GAA|Antrim]] in [[Casement Park]], [[Belfast]], where the homesters literally kicked the game away. Down ended Monaghan's run in Castleblayney a few weeks later.\n\nThe 1990s and early part of the 2000s were lean years for the county. Notable wins in that period were championship successes over Donegal in 1995 and defending All-Ireland champions Armagh in 2003. They won the [[Dr McKenna Cup]] in 1995 against Derry and in 2003 against Tyrone.\n\nAnother noticeable effort was a dramatic second half display against Derry in 1992, which saw a 9-point deficit hauled back to earn a draw. Wins were also recorded over [[Antrim GAA|Antrim]] in 1990 and [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]] in 1993 and 1994. After losses to [[Fermanagh GAA|Fermanagh]] in 1999 and 2000, a win over them was recorded in 2001.\n\nThe [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] run of 1998 was also memorable for Monaghan when they surprisingly qualified from a \"group of death\" that included [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]], [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]], [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]], [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]] and [[Sligo GAA|Sligo]] to qualify for the quarter-finals against [[Down GAA|Down]] in Croke Park. Behind at one stage early in the second half by 1-05 to 0-02, the Down goal scored by James Mc Cartan, a rousing rally with goals by Darren Swift and Stephen Mc Ginnitty and a spectacular individual point by Peter Duffy saw Monaghan cause a mild surprise with a 2-05 to 1-06 win. The semi final against [[Derry GAA|Derry]] was less memorable and defeat on a score of 1-12 to 0-08 was the result. The game had a bit of controversy too when a Mark Daly goal was disallowed and a Monaghan player was sent off. It set the tone for a niggly [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]] meeting between both sides a few weeks later. Monaghan's Edwin Murphy was sent off on the advice of a linesman but video evidence subsequently cleared him. However it didn't stop Monaghan suffering a heavy defeat on the day to Derry.\n\n1999 was even less memorable at senior level, the big highlight being the county U-21 side winning the Ulster championship with a final success over Donegal thanks to a last gasp super point from Kieran Tavey. The run ended with a 2-10 to 0-08 defeat to eventual champions [[Westmeath GAA|Westmeath]] in Croke Park.\n\nAt minor level there was an upsurge in fortunes with the county U-18 team reaching the Ulster minor league finals in 2000 and 2002 losing to Tyrone on both occasions by a point. The Ulster championship final was reached in 2001 for the first time in 18 years when a splendid effort fell short with a 2-13 to 0-13 defeat again to Tyrone. A missed penalty late on when only 4 points separated the sides was a big blow, however on reflection it was Monaghan's misfortune to meet Tyrone sides that would backbone their senior All-Ireland winning sides of 2003 and 2005. In 2001 the counties Vocational Schools team won the Ulster and All-Ireland championships.\n\n2005 was another memorable year for the county when they contested the Division 2 National Football League final against [[Meath GAA|Meath]] at Croke Park. However it took a last gasp point from Paul Finlay in the final league game against [[Longford GAA|Longford]] in Clones to earn a draw and automatic promotion to Division 1 for the first time in 18 years. The league semi final against Derry in Clones was also a thriller from a Monaghan perspective. A goal within 15 seconds of the throw in by Tommy Freeman set Monaghan on their way and despite Rory Woods being sent off Monaghan held out for a 1-13 to 1-11 win.\n\nThe NFL Division 2 final was a thrilling ding dong battle between two well match sides and was full of top drawer scores. It had the 40,000+ crowd on their feet from start to finish. Fortunes ebbed and flowed between both sides and in injury time [[Meath GAA|Meath]] looked like holding onto a 2-point victory. However a Paul Finlay free with the last kick of the game (sounds familiar) from 40 yards out was deflected into the Meath net by a Meath player and Monaghan edged out 3-13 to 3-12 winners. This game preceded the National Football League final which saw Armagh overcome [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]] to gain their first league title. This marked Monaghan's first visit to Croke Park in 7 years, that resulting in a 1-12 to 0-08 defeat in a National Football League semi-final to Derry back in 1998.\n\nDerry gained revenge in the Ulster Senior Football Championship with a 1-17 to 2-08 win, but \"back door\" wins over [[London GAA|London]], [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]] and [[Louth GAA|Louth]] brought Monaghan to a last 12 meeting with eventual All-Ireland champions Tyrone in Croke Park. In a very entertaining game the tactic of isolating [[Tom\u00e1s Freeman|Tommy Freeman]] up front caused havoc for Tyrone in the first 25 minutes as they leaked 1-05, the goal a spectacular effort from Freeman. However a shrewd management move from Tyrone resulted in a player being brought back to double mark Freeman and the Farney threat was quashed. On the day Monaghan had no plan \"B\" and Tyrone took over. They ran out flattering 2-14 to 1-07 winners in the end, limiting Monaghan to a single point from a free in the second half. All the pre-match hype surrounded the question as to whether or not Tyrone's [[Ryan McMenamin]] would be playing, having been suspended following an incident in the Ulster final. He missed the game but later returned for the quarter-final against [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]]. Freeman's exploits in the summer of 2005 brought him an All-star nomination and an \"Irish News\" Ulster All star award on the \"40\".\n\n2006 saw Monaghan compete in Division 1A of the National Football League but apart from a win over [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] and a draw with [[Offaly GAA|Offaly]], there was little else to celebrate despite battling displays against Kerry and Tyrone and relegation followed in the spring. The season ended in the championship qualifiers with a desperately poor display against [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]] resulting in an 0-08 to 0-06 defeat. The [[Dr McKenna Cup]] final was also reached early in the year but ended in a heavy defeat by Tyrone. The Ulster championship started with a 0-10 to 0-10 draw against eventual Ulster champions Armagh in rain soaked Clones. Six days later Armagh emerged victorious on a 1-13 to 0-10 score, the main difference between the sides being that Armagh took their chances and Monaghan didn't. Two missed goal opportunities on the day proved costly. A 2-19 to 3-05 win over Wicklow in the qualifiers saw Monaghan meet Wexford in Clones in what was probably the worst game of 2006. The continuous rain and wet conditions didn't help but it was the performance of the referee that grabbed the headlines on the day. Wexford who had Matty Forde controversially on board following an incident against Offaly for which he would be subsequently suspended won out by 0-08 to 0-06 and thus Monaghan's year ended on a dismal note.\n\n====2007====\n2007 saw Monaghan compete in Division 2A of the National Football League. A backroom clean out of trainers and selectors didn't augur well but the introduction of Tyrone native Martin Mc Elkennon to the Oriel set up proved to be a master stroke by Seamus Mc Eneaney for the year ahead. A straight run of seven successive victories in matches away to [[Roscommon GAA|Roscommon]] and home to [[Longford GAA|Longford]] and Carlow and away to Clare and away trips to [[London GAA|London]] and home to [[Offaly GAA|Offaly]] and away to Leitrim were fashioned out of great work ethic and spirit and no little skill.  The semi-final match is against [[Meath GAA|Meath]]. The Ulster Championship saw Monaghan play in the quarter final against the winners of [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]] and [[Down GAA|Down]]; who meet in the preliminary round. If successful there they would play the winners of [[Derry GAA|Derry]] and [[Antrim GAA|Antrim]] in the semi-final. Having avoided the \"big 2\" namely [[Armagh GAA|Armagh]] and [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]], this was viewed as Monaghan's best chance of reaching an Ulster final for the first time in 19 years. However, in recent seasons they had flattered to deceive and have disappointed their supporters when something big was expected from them. This was a big year for the Farney county. Monaghan reached the [[Dr McKenna Cup]] semi-final where they suffered a heavy defeat to [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]] under floodlights in [[Kingspan Breffni Park]], [[Cavan]] on 13 February 2007. They had initially qualified from Section A of the competition as runners up to [[Armagh GAA|Armagh]].\n\n====National Football League Division 2A====\nMonaghan enjoyed a fantastic run in the National Football League, winning all their 7 games. The platforms for both successes against Roscommon, Longford and Carlow were excellent first half displays where big scoring returns were racked up. The second half display against Clare was probably the best of the season so far. Next up was an away trip to London which Monaghan easily won by 0-16 to 1-05. The game against Offaly in the penultimate round in Clones could well be called the defining match in the group. As it turned out it was and a last gasp Paul Meegan point in injury time was enough to give Monaghan a 0-13 to 0-12 win, guaranteeing them a semi final place as table toppers and an all important position in the revamped Division 2 in 2008. This was achieved with a game in hand against Leitrim which was scheduled for 15 April and won by Monaghan on a 1-14 to 2-10 score. The league semi-final against Meath was played in Croke Park and it was a disaster for the Farney men as two early Meath goals gave them a cushion that they built a winning platform on. Despite the early concession of 2 goals within the first 3 minutes Monaghan dominated and could have been in front at half time but instead went in 2-04 to 0-05 in arrears. The concession of a third goal early in the second half settled matters and despite a late Monaghan rally Meath emerged winners on a 3-10 to 0-12 score. This game asked more questions than it answered and it was obvious from this game that Monaghan's full back line and team in general needed a major overhaul prior to the Ulster championship meeting against Down in Newry on 10 June.\n\n====Ulster Senior Football Championship====\nP\u00e1irc Esler in Newry was the venue for Monaghan's first game of the Ulster championship where they faced a Down team who had disposed of Cavan in the preliminary round after a replay. This was the day Ciar\u00e1n Hanratty announced his arrival on the county stage with a 2-goal salvo which inspired Monaghan to a 2-15 to 1-15 success. The defence had tightened up considerably and a couple of late fantastic points by Paul \"Jap\" Finlay near the end were other highlights in a resolute display in front of 17,000 vocal onlookers. The semi final against Derry in [[Casement Park]] on 24 June was also another triumph for Monaghan as they easily defeated [[Derry GAA|Derry]] by 0-14 to 1-09. The scoreline doesn't in any reflect Monaghan's superiority on the day as they stuck to a rigid game plan and easily disposed of a fancied Derry side. The news that Paul Finlay wouldn't play any part due to illness proved no handicap to Monaghan and his replacement Rory Woods game a tigerish display on the \"45\" bringing much needed bulk and skill to trouble Derry's vaunted defence. The only disappointment on the day was the lack of credit given to the victors as the media seemed to concentrate solely on Derry's poor display when in fact credit should be given to Monaghan for playing them off the green carpet that was Casement Park.\nThe final set for 15 July in the home of Ulster football that is [[Clones, County Monaghan|Clones]] was between Monaghan and [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]], ironically the same pairing as 1988 when Monaghan recorded their last [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]] success and final appearance. Tyrone were favourites in everyone's eyes for this game but in the Oriel county there was an inner belief that their side could upset the formbook and win a title that seemed so unlikely in January 2007. Sales of Monaghan jerseys, flags and anything white and blue went through the roof as the county lit up in anticipation of a great day out. The question on everyone's lips was whether or not Paul Finlay would be cleared by the medical experts to play some part on a stage he was born to grace. He was awaiting results for a viral infection and up to the throw in no-one apart from the doctors treating him, the team management, players and Finlay's family was sure what the diagnosis was. Monaghan folk crossed their fingers in the hope this talented lad would get his chance to play in an Ulster senior football final- an arena he deserved to be part of. In the end Finlay started the match: a match which [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]] won by a scoreline of 1-15 to 1-13. However the scoreline doesn't tell the story of a cracking match which at one stage had Monaghan trailing by 8 points. A cracking goal by Philip Jordan after 6 minutes put Tyrone in the driving seat but slowly and surely Monaghan came back to trail by 1-08 to 0-07 at half time. Another strong Tyrone rally at the start of the second half put Tyrone on their way. Monaghan goaled in the 51st minute through Tommy Freeman and a succession of high balls on a beleaguered Tyrone defence saw Monaghan plunder the scores to leave just 3 points in it going into injury time. Monaghan had numerous chances to level the game but they had to settle for an injury time point from converted full back Vincent Corey whose switch from No. 3 to No 14 was the catalyst for the Farney fightback. Alas it was a case of too little too late and Tyrone edged out winners by 2 points.\n\n'''Ulster Senior Football Championship 2013'''\nIn the 2013 championship, Monaghan were handed a \"favorable\" draw. They were drawn against Antrim in the first round in Casement Park, Belfast. Monaghan had previously brushed aside the Antrim men in the National League. Monaghan started shakily and took a while to get going. They survived some scares but the free taking of Conor McManus powered them over the line 0-11 to 0-6. In the Ulster semi final Monaghan were pitted against local neighbours Cavan. The game was a tight affair with both teams trading scores tit for tat. In the end it finished on a score of 1-11 to 0-13. Coming into the final Monaghan faced the reigning Ulster and All Ireland Champions, Donegal. Nobody had given Monaghan a hope coming into the final but the Farney men took the Tir Chonaill boys by surprise rushing into a 4-0 lead while also keeping Donegal scoreless for 32 minutes. Drew Wylie and Colin Walshe were outstanding marking Colm McFadden and Paddy Mcbrearty respectively. At half time Monaghan led 05-02. Despite the 3 point advantage Donegal were still much fancied but Kieran Hughes stuck over 3 quick points in succession to buffer the Farney Men's advantage. With Vinny Corey's rough housing of Michael Murphy, Donegal failed to get going. Monaghan beat Donegal at their own game using the blanket defence system while Darren Hughes and Conor McManus remained outstanding. It was tight up until the last 10 minutes when Monaghan added some scores to put a gloss on the scoreline. Tommy Freeman one of the greatest servants of Monaghan coming off the bench and firing over the last point. At the end of the game Monaghan had won their first Ulster Senior Football Championship in 25 years. This result was coupled with the Minors superb comeback win earlier in the day defeating Tyrone to complete an historic double. At the final whistle there were scenes of unrivaled joy as Owen Lennon lifted the Anglo Celt Cup as no Monaghan Captain had done for 25 years.\n\n====All-Ireland qualifiers====\nIt was the qualifiers next and Monaghan were drawn against Donegal in Healy Park in Omagh. This was probably Monaghan's finest display of the year as they humiliated the National League Division One champions by 8 points in a game they dominated from start to finish. Superb displays by Dessie Mone, Eoin Lennon, Tommy Freeman and man of the match Vincent Corey were chief factors in a 2-12 to 1-07 win which saw the Donegal manager retire afterwards but in August 2007 it appeared as if he may rescind that decision according to newspaper reports. Donegal on the night had simply no answer to Monaghan's power, passion, poise and frightening will to win as the T\u00edr Chonnail men reverted to type and fell away long before the end.\n\n====All-Ireland quarter-final====\nThe quarter final draws were made as Monaghan entered this arena for the first time since the qualifiers were started. They were drawn against [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] and Croke Park was named as the venue as part of a triple header involving a minor hurling semi final involving Tipperary and Kilkenny and a senior hurling semi-final involving Waterford and Limerick.\n\nThe game was fixed for 12 August 2007, almost 22 years to the day that Eamon Mc Eneaney earned his place in Monaghan folklore for a massive equalising point against the same opposition who were as now defending all-Ireland champions. Monaghan were raging outsiders against the Kingdom where the defending champions were odds on to stroll to a semi final against Dublin. Monaghan started on fire with points from Rory Woods and Tommy Freeman. A 7th-minute penalty was awarded to Monaghan when Ci\u00e1ran Hanratty was dragged down whilst bearing in on the Kerry goals. Tommy Freeman coolly stuck the ball away to give Monaghan a commanding lead in front of 80,000 spellbound spectators. However Kerry fought back to parity at the interval on a 0-08 to 1-05 score.\n\nThe second half was a thrilling affair and despite the concession of a slack goal Monaghan led by 2 points entering the final 8 minutes. However a combination of panic and inexperience both on the field and on the line told as Kerry fought back to level terms and go a point in front with a minute left. Monaghan strived might and main for an equalising point but a series of missed passes and downright hard luck proved to be their downfall. It ended in heartbreak on a score of Kerry 1-12, Monaghan 1-11.\n\nA standing ovation was given by the Monaghan supporters to a team that in the words of their manager had left everything they had on the pitch. They gave their all but just came up short. That ended Monaghan's run of 2007 but in terms of the previous 2 decades what a run it was. The county was buzzing again, everywhere was a sea of blue and white and people were proud of their team once more.\n\nAfterwards manager [[S\u00e9amus McEnaney]] vowed they would be back again in 2008 and as a unit all Monaghan folk hoped they would be, especially team coach/trainer Martin Mc Elkennon, who brought this group from a bunch of also-rans to a team of great potential. On reflection this game was one that got away as it was there for the taking. The only plus was that it meant we were good enough to have beaten anyone in Ireland but Kerry. It also showed this group of players that they could indeed compete with the best.\n\nKerry though went back home to the south to prepare for a semi-final meeting with Dublin on 26 August which they duly won by 1-15 to 0-16 to qualify for the final against Munster rivals Cork. This turned out to be a complete mismatch as the Kingdom crushed a very weak Rebel side without ever slipping into top gear.\n\nThe eventual champions were quoted many times in the immediate aftermath that their joust with Monaghan had brought them on in leaps and bounds and steeled them sufficiently for the tests against Dublin and Cork. For Monaghan it was a case of a lot done and more to do. Martin Mc Elkennon had the team in superb shape, a fact that received comments from throughout the country. Hopes were high that he would stay on board for 2008 as he was the key to success.\n\nThe hopes of the county were realised when Mc Eneaney, Mc Elkennon and Trappe decided to stay on board for 2008 and this was ratified by the county committee in September 2007. The only retiree was kit man Michael Mc Kenna who stepped down for work reasons. A big miss to a solid team. Mc Eneaney promised to freshen things up and raise the bar again for 2008, a year that Monaghan fans are looking forward to with relish. The year finished with Monaghan being awarded 7 Irish News Ulster GAA all-stars but more significantly a Vodafone All-star award for Thomas Freeman at right corner forward. As well as that he was chosen as the Irish News and Ulster GAA writers Ulster Gaelic football player of the year.

Perseus's name should properly be spelled Perseus, 'the destroyer'; and he was not, as Professor Kerenyi has suggested, an archetypal Death-figure but, probably, represented the patriarchal Hellenes who invaded Greece and Asia Minor early in the second millennium BC, and challenged the power of the Triple-goddess. Pegasus had been sacred to her because the horse with its moon-shaped hooves figured in the rain-making ceremonies and the installment of sacred kings; his wings were symbolical of a celestial nature, rather than speed.<br />Jane Harrison has pointed out (Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion) that Medusa was once the goddess herself, hiding behind a prophylactic Gorgon mask: a hideous face intended to warn the profane against trespassing on her Mysteries.

In Freud's interpretation: \"To decapitate = to castrate. The terror of Medusa is thus a terror of castration that is linked to the sight of something. Numerous analyses have made us familiar with the occasion for this: it occurs when a boy, who has hitherto been unwilling to believe the threat of castration, catches sight of the female genitals, probably those of an adult, surrounded by hair, and essentially those of his mother.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|date=Summer 2017|title=Medusa's Head|url=|journal=The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud.|publisher=The Hogarth Press|volume= XVIII|pages=273}}</ref> In this perspective the \"ravishingly beautiful\" Medusa (see above) is the mother remembered in innocence; before the mythic truth of castration dawns on the subject. Classic Medusa, in contrast, is an Oedipal/libidinous symptom. Looking at forbidden mother (in her hair-covered genitals, so to speak) stiffens the subject in illicit desire and freezes him in terror of the Father's retribution. There are no recorded instances of Medusa turning a woman to stone.\n\n[[Archetypal literary criticism]] continues to find [[Psychoanalysts|psychoanalysis]] useful. Beth Seelig analyzes Medusa's punishment from the aspect of the crime of having been raped rather than having willingly consented in Athena's temple as an outcome of the goddess' unresolved conflicts with her own father, [[Zeus]].<ref>Seelig, B.J.

Its purpose was to act as a guardian for female power, keeping the book solely in the hands of women. Stephen Wilk, author of ''Medusa: Solving the Mystery of the Gorgon'', questioned Medusa's enduring status among the feminist movement. He believes that one reason for her longevity may be her role as a protector, fearsome and enraged. \"Only the Gorgon has the savage, threatening appearance to serve as an immediately recognized symbol of rage and a protector of women's secrets,\" wrote Wilk.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilk |first1=Stephen |title=Medusa: Solving the Mystery of the Gorgon |date=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |page=219}}</ref>\n\nEven in contemporary pop culture, Medusa has become largely synonymous with feminine rage. Through many of her iterations, Medusa pushes back against a story that seeks to place the male, Perseus, at its center, blameless and heroic. Author Sibylle Baumbach described Medusa as a \u201cmultimodal image of intoxication, petrifaction, and luring attractiveness,\" citing her seductive contemporary representation, as well as her dimensionality, as the reason for her longevity.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hastings |first1=Christobel |title=The Timeless Myth of Medusa, a Rape Victim Turned Into a Monster |url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/qvxwax/medusa-greek-myth-rape-victim-turned-into-a-monster |website=Broadly. |publisher=Vice |accessdate=5 December 2018}}</ref> Elizabeth Johnston's November 2016 Atlantic essay called Medusa the original 'Nasty Woman.' Johnston goes on to say that as Medusa has been repeatedly compared to Clinton during the 2016 presidential election, she proves her merit as an icon, finding relevance even in modern politics. \"Medusa has since haunted Western imagination, materializing whenever male authority feels threatened by female agency,\" writes Johnston.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Johnston |first1=Elizabeth |title=The Original 'Nasty Woman' |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/11/the-original-nasty-woman-of-classical-myth/506591/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=5 December 2018}}</ref> Beyond that, Medusa's story is, Johnston argues, a rape narrative. A story of victim blaming, one that she says sounds all too familiar in a current American context.\n\n{{quote|Medusa is widely known as a monstrous creature with snakes in her hair whose gaze turns men to stone. Through the lens of theology, film, art, and feminist literature, my students and I map how her meaning has shifted over time and across cultures.

Bellerophon masters winged Pegasus and kills the Chimaera. Perseus, in a variant of the same legend, flies through the air and beheads Pegasus's mother, the Gorgon Medusa; much as Marduk, a Babylonian hero, kills the she-monster Tiamat, Goddess of the Seal. Perseus's name should properly be spelled Perseus, 'the destroyer'; and he was not, as Professor Kerenyi has suggested, an archetypal Death-figure but, probably, represented the patriarchal Hellenes who invaded Greece and Asia Minor early in the second millennium BC, and challenged the power of the Triple-goddess. Pegasus had been sacred to her because the horse with its moon-shaped hooves figured in the rain-making ceremonies and the installment of sacred kings; his wings were symbolical of a celestial nature, rather than speed.<br />Jane Harrison has pointed out (Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion) that Medusa was once the goddess herself, hiding behind a prophylactic Gorgon mask: a hideous face intended to warn the profane against trespassing on her Mysteries. Perseus beheads Medusa: that is, the Hellenes overran the goddess's chief shrines, stripped her priestesses of their Gorgon masks, and took possession of the sacred horses\u2014an early representation of the goddess with a Gorgon's head and a mare's body has been found in Boeotia.

In Freud's interpretation: \"To decapitate = to castrate. The terror of Medusa is thus a terror of castration that is linked to the sight of something. Numerous analyses have made us familiar with the occasion for this: it occurs when a boy, who has hitherto been unwilling to believe the threat of castration, catches sight of the female genitals, probably those of an adult, surrounded by hair, and essentially those of his mother.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|date=Summer 2017|title=Medusa's Head|url=|journal=The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud.|publisher=The Hogarth Press|volume= XVIII|pages=273}}</ref> In this perspective the \"ravishingly beautiful\" Medusa (see above) is the mother remembered in innocence; before the mythic truth of castration dawns on the subject. Classic Medusa, in contrast, is an Oedipal/libidinous symptom. Looking at forbidden mother (in her hair-covered genitals, so to speak) stiffens the subject in illicit desire and freezes him in terror of the Father's retribution. There are no recorded instances of Medusa turning a woman to stone.\n\n[[Archetypal literary criticism]] continues to find [[Psychoanalysts|psychoanalysis]] useful. Beth Seelig analyzes Medusa's punishment from the aspect of the crime of having been raped rather than having willingly consented in Athena's temple as an outcome of the goddess' unresolved conflicts with her own father, [[Zeus]].<ref>Seelig, B.J.

Its purpose was to act as a guardian for female power, keeping the book solely in the hands of women. Stephen Wilk, author of ''Medusa: Solving the Mystery of the Gorgon'', questioned Medusa's enduring status among the feminist movement. He believes that one reason for her longevity may be her role as a protector, fearsome and enraged. \"Only the Gorgon has the savage, threatening appearance to serve as an immediately recognized symbol of rage and a protector of women's secrets,\" wrote Wilk.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilk |first1=Stephen |title=Medusa: Solving the Mystery of the Gorgon |date=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |page=219}}</ref>\n\nEven in contemporary pop culture, Medusa has become largely synonymous with feminine rage. Through many of her iterations, Medusa pushes back against a story that seeks to place the male, Perseus, at its center, blameless and heroic. Author Sibylle Baumbach described Medusa as a \u201cmultimodal image of intoxication, petrifaction, and luring attractiveness,\" citing her seductive contemporary representation, as well as her dimensionality, as the reason for her longevity.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hastings |first1=Christobel |title=The Timeless Myth of Medusa, a Rape Victim Turned Into a Monster |url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/qvxwax/medusa-greek-myth-rape-victim-turned-into-a-monster |website=Broadly. |publisher=Vice |accessdate=5 December 2018}}</ref> Elizabeth Johnston's November 2016 Atlantic essay called Medusa the original 'Nasty Woman.' Johnston goes on to say that as Medusa has been repeatedly compared to Clinton during the 2016 presidential election, she proves her merit as an icon, finding relevance even in modern politics. \"Medusa has since haunted Western imagination, materializing whenever male authority feels threatened by female agency,\" writes Johnston.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Johnston |first1=Elizabeth |title=The Original 'Nasty Woman' |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/11/the-original-nasty-woman-of-classical-myth/506591/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=5 December 2018}}</ref> Beyond that, Medusa's story is, Johnston argues, a rape narrative. A story of victim blaming, one that she says sounds all too familiar in a current American context.\n\n{{quote|Medusa is widely known as a monstrous creature with snakes in her hair whose gaze turns men to stone. Through the lens of theology, film, art, and feminist literature, my students and I map how her meaning has shifted over time and across cultures.

Cixous calls writing \"an act which will not only 'realize' the decensored relation of woman to her sexuality, to her womanly being, giving her access to her native strength; it will give her back her goods, her pleasures, her organs, her immense bodily territories which have been kept under seal.\" She claims \"we must kill the false woman who is preventing the live one from breathing.

He was the fifth and youngest son of [[Jabir al-Kaabi|Haji Jabir Khan Ibn Merdaw]], and his mother, Sheikha Noura, was the daughter of Talal Bin Alwan, the Sheikh of the powerful Bawi tribe. He was born on 18 August 1863, in the village Qout Al Zain in the district of Abu Khasib in Basra and he ascended to the throne on 2 June 1897 upon the death of his brother and predecessor, Sheikh [[Miz'al Khan ibn Haji Jabir Khan]].\n\n==Historical background==\nOn 2 June 1897, Khaz'al inherited the Emirate of Mohammerah. The Emirate, although within the Persian Empire, was autonomous and allowed to conduct its own affairs.\n\nThroughout Khaz\u2019al's reign (1897-1925), he was one of the most important political figures in the Persian Gulf and a prominent supporter of Britain's presence in the region. Although never formally a part of the British Empire, the Gulf had been effectively incorporated into the British imperial system since the early 19th century. The conclusion of treaties and agreements with the region's various tribal rulers was one of the central means by which Britain enforced its hegemonic presence, and Khaz\u2019al was no exception to this trend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.bl.uk/untoldlives/2017/11/the-shaikh-who-lost-his-shaikhdom-khazal-al-kab%C4%AB-of-mohammerah-.html|title=The Shaikh who lost his Shaikhdom, Khaz\u2019al al-Ka\u2018b\u012b of Mohammerah|last=Allday|first=Louis|date=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIndeed, Khaz\u2019al actively fostered close relations with Britain in an attempt to gain their assurance that in the event of the Qajar Empire collapsing or being overthrown, Arabistan would be formally recognised by Britain as an independent state with him as its ruler.\n\nAfter oil was discovered by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (the forerunner of BP) in Arabistan in 1908, Britain strengthened its ties to Khaz\u2019al further. In 1910 he was made a Knight Commander of the Indian Empire. During his reign Sheikh Khaz'al held a percentage of shares in BP. Those shares were later taken by force by Reza Khan.\n\nKhaz\u2019al sought to prove his loyalty to Britain in return and he acted as a key ally throughout the First World War during which he suppressed a pro-Ottoman tribal uprising in his domains. Khaz'al was also the darling of many Sunnite Iraqi nationalists, who sought to foment dissent among Iran's Arab population by referring to Khuzestan as ''Arabest\u0101n'' and glorifying Khaz'al as its independent \"Sultan\".<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica\">{{cite web|last=MILANI|first=MOHSEN M.|title=IRAQ vi.

The Bani Kaab were the largest and most powerful tribe in the province. In the early 19th century the Bani Kaab had dissolved into a number of rival clans that often clashed and feuded with each other.\n\nOf these factions, the Muhaisin clan, led by [[Haji Jabir Khan Ibn Merdaw]], became the strongest and under his leadership the Bani Kaab were reunified under a single authority, the capital of Arabistan being moved from the village of Fallahiyah to the flourishing port city of Mohammerah. Unlike previous rulers of Arabistan, Jabir maintained law and order, and established Mohammerah as a free port and sheikhdom, of which he was Sheikh. Jabir also became the Imperial-appointed governor-general of the province.\n\n==Rise to power==\nAfter Jabir's death in 1881, his elder son, Maz'al, took over as tribal leader and Sheikh of Mohammerah, as well as the provincial governor-general, which was confirmed by an Imperial firman (executive order). However, in June 1897 Maz'al was killed. Some accounts state that he was assassinated by his younger brother,<ref name=\"IranicaKAZAL\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=\u1e34AZ\u02bfAL KHAN|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kazal-khan|accessdate=2016-01-09|last=Shahnavaz|first=Shahbaz}}</ref> Khaz'al, while others state that this was done by a palace guard under orders from Khaz'al.\n\nThereafter Khaz'al assumed his position as Sheikh of Mohammerah, proclaiming himself not only the leader of the Bani Kaab, but also the ruler of the entire province. He then appointed his sons to the governorships of the various cities, towns and villages within his control, including Naseriyeh.\n\nUnlike his brother, Khaz'al had ambition. He had great vision for the future of Arabistan and the Arabs.

In 1909, the British government asked [[Percy Cox]], British resident to Bushehr, to negotiate an agreement with Khaz'al for APOC to obtain a site on Abadan Island for a refinery, depot, storage tanks, and other operations. The refinery was built and began operating in 1912. Khaz'al was knighted in 1910 and supported Britain in World War I.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the Petroleum Industry|last=Vassiliou|first=M.S|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=285|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the discovery of oil in Arabistan-controlled territory, the British moved quickly to establish control over the vast oil resources in the province, which culminated in the foundation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1909. The British established a treaty with Khaz'al, whereby in exchange for their guaranteed support and protection against any external attack, he would also guarantee to maintain internal security and not interfere with the process of oil extraction. As part of the treaty they were given a monopoly of drilling in the province in return for an annual payment to Khaz'al, though the profits of the company vastly exceeded the annual payments.\n\nAPOC had made Khaz\u2019al extremely wealthy. Not only was Khaz\u2019al receiving revenue from oil production but he also owned a certain amount of shares in the oil company. It was said that \"In all Arabia and its Sheikhdoms, in Mesopotamia and Iran, from the Red Sea to the Caspian, there was no sovereign so rich as Sheikh Khaz\u2019al.\"<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Averting An Iranian Geopolitical Crisis: A Tale of Power Play for Dominance Between Colonial Powers, Tribal and Government Actors in the Pre and Post World War One Era.|last=H|first=RamHormozi|publisher=FriesenPress|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n== Sheikh Khaz'al turns down the throne of Kuwait ==\nIn 1920, the Sheikh of Kuwait, Salim Al Mubarak Al Sabah, ambushed [[Ibn Saud]]'s men over a border dispute between Kuwait and Najd.

Then came the Shah's telegram of April 1924 about his loss of confidence in Reza Khan. In the following summer, Khaz\u2019al brought together some regional magnates and tribal heads - the Vali of Poshtkuh, heads of the Khamseh federation of tribes, and many of the local Arab tribal leaders - in a coalition to resist Reza. They described themselves as the ''Committee of the Rising for Happiness'', and sent telegrams and statements to Tehran. Their statements demanded constitutional government and the return of the Shah, who they said had been forced to remain in Europe. They also attacked military violations of the people's rights in the provinces, and \u2018the massacres of Loristan\u2019; demanded Reza Khan's dismissal; and described the Prince Regent, [[Ali Reza Khan Azod al-Molk]], as the legitimate fount of authority. It was all in the name of the law, justice and the constitution, and \u2018in the illustrious name of His Imperial Majesty Soltan Ahmad Shah, the constitutional monarch\u2019. The committee sought to defend and protect [[Constitutionalism]], and stop the traitors and criminals freely dispensing with it and re-establishing the apparatus of arbitrary rule and injustice once again ... and stop Reza Khan from trampling the principles of democratic government under foot by arbitrary government.\"<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=State and Society in Iran: The Eclipse of the Qajars and the Emergence of the Pahlavis|last=Katouzian|first=Homa|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\nThe Prince Regent wrote an encouraging letter to Khaz\u2019al, all in the name of the Shah and for protection of the constitution, and said that the bearer would discuss matters with the Shaikh in detail. The Shah and the court did not have the courage to commit themselves firmly to such a movement, but would go along with it if there was a very good change of success. Reza Khan subsequently sent him a bombastic tactless telegram, after which the Sheikh expressed his determination to overthrow Reza Khan or perish in the attempt. He declared that he would abandon his defensive measures only if Reza agreed to the following: <blockquote>''(i) to give written guarantees regarding the safety of life and property of those who were helping the Sheikh - especially the Bakhtiari Amir Mujahid. (ii) to withdraw all troops from Arabistan including Bebehan; (iii) to cancel the revenue settlement of the previous year and return to the pre-war basis; and (iv) to give a more specific confirmation of his firmans. On September 13th the British Political Resident was told to convey a message to [[Reza Shah|Reza Khan]] to accept Khaz'al's conditions.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=British Relations with Khazal, Sheikh of Mohammerah|last=|first=|publisher=India Office Records and Private Papers|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>''</blockquote>In the meantime, the Political Resident had interviewed the Sheikh, his second son (Sheikh Abdul Hamid), the Bakhtiari Amir Mujahid and Colonel Riza Quli Khan (who had replaced Colonel Baqir Khan at Shushtar but who had apparently thrown in his lot with the Sheikh); all declared that no peace with Reza Khan was possible; the Sheikh had telegraphed to the Majlis explaining that his opposition was to Reza Khan personally and that it was hoped to persuade the Shah to return. On September 16 the Sheikh had also addressed a telegram to the foreign legations in Tehran in the nature of a proclamation against Reza Khan, who was described as a usurper and a transgressor of the Persian Empire.<ref name=\":6\" /> Reza sent a telegram to Khaz\u2019al that stating that he should either apologise to him and relent publicly, or take the full consequences.\n\nKhaz\u2019al and his remaining associates could muster an army of 25,000 men, which was no less than Reza Khan could throw in the region at the time. In fact the army he had amassed at the foot of the Loristan elevations was 15,000 strong. But Khaz\u2019al did not dare to go into action without British approval. The British government was in no mood to go to war on Khaz\u2019al's behalf. Loraine convinced Khaz\u2019al to desist and to apologize to Reza Khan. In return, he promised to intervene with Reza Khan to halt the advance of his troops into Arabistan. The Shaikh sent an apology, but, realizing that the danger had passed, Reza Khan paid little attention to Loraine's representations on the Shaikh's behalf. He let the troops pour into Arabistan, and demanded that Khaz\u2019al should surrender unconditionally and go straight to Tehran. The Foreign Office was very unhappy at Reza Khan's intransigence. In the presence of Loraine, Khaz\u2019al and Reza met and even swore an oath of friendship on the Qur\u2019an. [[File:Sheikh Khaz'al's yacht.jpeg|left|thumb|259x259px|The Khaz'aliyah Yacht, where Khaz'al was Kidnapped, near ''Qasr Al-Failiyah'' (Failiyah Palace) in Mohammerah]]After a short while, Reza broke all his pledges. In April 1925, he ordered one of his commanders, who had a friendly relationship with Khaz'al, to meet Khaz'al. The commander, General [[Fazlollah Zahedi]], accompanied by several government officials, met with Khaz'al and spent an evening with him onboard his yacht, anchored in the Shatt al-Arab river by his palace in Failiyeh near the city of Mohammerah. Later that evening several gunboats, sent by Reza Khan, stealthily made their way next to the yacht, which was then immediately boarded by fifty Persian troops. The soldiers kidnapped<ref>{{Cite book|title=Days of God: The Revolution in Iran and its Consequences\".|last=Wynn|first=Antony|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Khaz'al and took him by motorboat down the river to Mohammerah, where a car was waiting to take him to the military base in [[Ahvaz|Ahwaz]]. From there he was taken to Dezful, along with his son and heir, and then to the city of Khorramabad in Lorestan, and then eventually to Tehran.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nUpon his arrival, Khaz'al was warmly greeted and well received by Reza Khan, who assured him that his problems would be quickly settled, and that in the meantime, he would be treated very well. However, many of his personal assets in Arabistan were quickly liquidated and his properties eventually came under the domain of the Imperial government after Reza Khan was crowned the new Shah. The emirate was abolished and the provincial authority took full control of regional affairs.\n\nKhaz'al spent the rest of his life under virtual house arrest, unable to travel beyond Tehran's city limits. He was able to retain ownership of his properties in Kuwait and Iraq, where he was exempted from taxation. In May 1936, while alone in his house, as earlier in the day his servants had been taken to court by the police, he was murdered by one of the guards stationed outside his house under direct orders from Reza Shah.\n\n== Freemasonry ==\n[[File:Khaz'al-Khan-gm-Mespotmaia.jpg|left|thumb|316x316px|A photograph of Khaz'al wearing Masonic regalia]]\nSheikh Khaz'al was an active Freemason and a recipient of many high Masonic honours. Up until his death, Sheikh Khaz'al was the most influential of all Masons of the Middle East.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Creating the Arabian Gulf: The British Raj and the Invasions of the Gulf|last=Rich|first=Paul John|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=2009|isbn=|location=United Kingdom|pages=}}</ref> It is not clear when exactly Sheikh Khaz'al joined Freemasonry. What is known, is that he was the first Freemason among the inhabitants of the Persian Gulf, and that he became the Grand Master of Freemasonry in all Mesopotamia. It is likely that the East India Co. established the first Masonic lodge in the area and that Sheikh Khaz'al became its first chairman.\n\nA secret document found after the seizure of Masonic lodges in Egypt was the agenda for al-Abbasi Lodge No. 223 of Cairo for its meeting of 16 December 1923. One of the items discussed the subject of presenting Sheikh Khaz'al, the chairman of 'Khaz'al' lodge, and the regional Grand Master of Mesopotamia, with a decoration in recognition of his valuable services to Freemasonry.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Arab Papers; Freemasonry in the Arab World|last=Safwat|first=Najdat Fathi|publisher=An Arab Research Centre Publication|year=1980|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\n\" The bestowal of honours to all of the Brothers mentioned, in recognition of their great services:\n\nFirstly - His Greatness, the Sardar Aqdas, Ruler of Arabistan and Prince of Nuyan, respected Brother, Khaz'al Khan Sultan of Mohammerah, and Chairman of the Khaz'al Khan Lodge and Provincial Grand Master of Mesopotamia...\"\n\n== Humanitarian acts ==\n\n=== Chaldean victims of the Ottoman Empire ===\n[[File:Khaz'al Al-Ka'bi with Talib Al-Naqib 1920.jpg|thumb|318x318px|Sheikh Khaz'al Bin Jabir (centre) with Sir Hugh Bell (right) and Talib Al Naqib (Left).]]\nIn October 1914, the [[Assyrian genocide]] occurred whereby thousands of Chaldeans were killed or deported by the Ottoman Empire. After having experienced such atrocities on the hands of the Ottomans, the [[Chaldean Catholics]] began to migrate away from their homeland, in search of somewhere safer. Some of these emigrants found their way to the city of Ahwaz where,<blockquote>''\u201c...under the protective shadow of His Highness the Sardar Aqdas\u2026 they found refugee, and when their numbers increased, they approached His Highness asking for a plot of land that they may build a church and a school to bring up their children and he accepted with what he promised of the welcoming of the heart and the tolerance of the palm and he granted them the land and he provided them endowment.

He explained that those of his spiritual children who had remained happy in the East were the ones who emigrated to Ahwaz and lived under the shadow of the Sardar Aqdas. The Pope was moved by the benevolence of Sheikh Khaz\u2019al Khan towards those who were distressed amongst the children of the church and he granted him the Order of St Gregory the Great of the rank of Knight Commander, announcing his thanks and his acknowledgment of \"...the grace of this great and generous Arab King\".\n\nIn 1920, Khaz\u2019al was awarded the Order of St Gregory the Great of the rank of Knight Commander. Out of the ''Orders of the Holy Seal,'' it is the fourth highest Papal order and is the highest papal order that can be received by a non-catholic.\n\n== King Faisal I attempts to kidnap Sheikh Khaz\u2019al from Tehran ==\n[[File:Sheikh-khaz'al-king- faisal.png|thumb|311x311px|Sheikh Khaz'al and King Faisal I in Basra]]\nThe first of a number of attempts to rescue Khaz\u2019al was in 1927 by King [[Faisal I of Iraq]]. Faisal felt that the arrest of Khaz\u2019al and the injustice of the Persian government towards [[Mohammerah|Arabistan]] were severe and cruel. Moreover, Faisal felt that he was in debt to Khaz\u2019al for withdrawing his candidacy for the throne of Iraq. For Faisal, after being deposed from the Kingship of Syria, was a King without a country. He viewed this mission not only as an act of loyalty, but more importantly, of duty. Faisal informed [[Nuri al-Said]] of his plan to which the latter recommended using diplomacy rather than physical intervention.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Al Ahwaz, The Past, The Present, The Future|last=Ahmad|first=Nassar|publisher=Dar Al Sharq Al Awsat|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, al-Said, without Faisal's knowledge, informed [[Henry Dobbs]], the British Ambassador to Iraq, of the latters intentions of kidnapping Khaz\u2019al. Dobbs immediately met with Faisal and warned him of the consequences of such an act, stating that \u2018''His Majesty's Government''\u2019 would take a firm stand against him. \"Do not play with fire, King Faisal,\" warned Dobbs.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Khaz'al in literature ==\n\n=== [[Abd al-Mas\u012bh al-Ant\u0101k\u012b]] in The ''Kit\u0101b Riy\u0101\u1e0d Al-Khaz\u02bbal\u012byah F\u012b al-Siy\u0101sah Al-Ins\u0101n\u012byah (The Garden of Khaz\u2019al in Human Politics).'' ===\nThe official author of the book is Khaz\u2019al, but it was written by the Syrian poet and journalist, Abdul Maseeh al Antaki. Born in Aleppo, with Greek origins, he emigrated to Egypt and travelled the Arab world. He established the ''Al Omran'' newspaper in Egypt and became a frequent figure in Khaz\u2019al's court.\n\nHe explains, in the introduction of the book, his objective:<blockquote>''\u201c...and here I am mentioning His Highness the Sardar Aqdas, so that the reader my learn that His Highness the author is the bearer of the sword and the pen, and that amongst the Arab Kings and Princes he is the greatest King, the most magnificent Prince, the respectable gentleman, the most knowledgeable of the knowledgeable, and I am full of what I have seen myself and have known after my long mission and my study, unexaggerated in my story, and not passed the line of rationality and guidance, so that the Arabs may know that His Highness the Sovereign the Mu\u2019iz has combined between determination and knowledge, and has been struck by both by the most blessed arrow, that is how that Kings and Princes should be, if they sought to revive the glory of their forefathers.\u201d'' <ref name=\":4\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== [[Ameen Rihani]] in Molouk el-Arab (Kings of the Arabs) ===\n<blockquote>''\"Mention one who does not know him. For he is amongst the Arab Princes. His Emirate being within the vicinity of the Persian Empire. He is the eldest, after King Hussein, the first to fame, and the greatest in generosity. This is what is known by most of those who know in the Arab countries. What most people outside of Kuwait and Basrah do not know, is that this Arab Prince is of the status of the Princes of the Abbasid era for he is rich, wise and generous together. He is like the Barmakids in his generosity, his taste, and his literature. He loves music, literature and poetry and   leans towards all that provides pleasure and joy, be it mental, social or physical. Yes, the Sheikh Khaz'al has a universal humanitarian taste, for he does not alienate that which is ugly or vilified in life, and he knows no preference or discrimination in his generosity. A singer visits from Aleppo or Damascus to Mohammerah with nothing but her anklets. After residing a few months at the palace, she returns rich and laden with jewels. And the poets come with poems of praise in their pockets, and return from Mohammerah with bags of gold. He is not in need of my testimony for if he were to wear his official gown, he carries on his chest the testimonies of the Kings of the Earth, of which is the Papal Order of Saint Gregory the Great. Amongst those honours are two which are not seen by all, yet are only seen by those who look at this man with the eye of poetry and philosophy. For in his human capacity, he holds decorations from the philosopher [[Epicurus]] and the wise divine mystic [[Ibn Arabi]].\"''</blockquote>\n\n==Views==\nIn regard to religious extremism, Khaz'al said:\n\n{{quote|It is the scourge of the world.

He was the fifth and youngest son of [[Jabir al-Kaabi|Haji Jabir Khan Ibn Merdaw]], and his mother, Sheikha Noura, was the daughter of Talal Bin Alwan, the Sheikh of the powerful Bawi tribe. He was born on 18 August 1863, in the village Qout Al Zain in the district of Abu Khasib in Basra and he ascended to the throne on 2 June 1897 upon the death of his brother and predecessor, Sheikh [[Miz'al Khan ibn Haji Jabir Khan]].\n\n==Historical background==\nOn 2 June 1897, Khaz'al inherited the Emirate of Mohammerah. The Emirate, although within the Persian Empire, was autonomous and allowed to conduct its own affairs.\n\nThroughout Khaz\u2019al's reign (1897-1925), he was one of the most important political figures in the Persian Gulf and a prominent supporter of Britain's presence in the region. Although never formally a part of the British Empire, the Gulf had been effectively incorporated into the British imperial system since the early 19th century. The conclusion of treaties and agreements with the region's various tribal rulers was one of the central means by which Britain enforced its hegemonic presence, and Khaz\u2019al was no exception to this trend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.bl.uk/untoldlives/2017/11/the-shaikh-who-lost-his-shaikhdom-khazal-al-kab%C4%AB-of-mohammerah-.html|title=The Shaikh who lost his Shaikhdom, Khaz\u2019al al-Ka\u2018b\u012b of Mohammerah|last=Allday|first=Louis|date=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIndeed, Khaz\u2019al actively fostered close relations with Britain in an attempt to gain their assurance that in the event of the Qajar Empire collapsing or being overthrown, Arabistan would be formally recognised by Britain as an independent state with him as its ruler.\n\nAfter oil was discovered by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (the forerunner of BP) in Arabistan in 1908, Britain strengthened its ties to Khaz\u2019al further. In 1910 he was made a Knight Commander of the Indian Empire. During his reign Sheikh Khaz'al held a percentage of shares in BP. Those shares were later taken by force by Reza Khan.\n\nKhaz\u2019al sought to prove his loyalty to Britain in return and he acted as a key ally throughout the First World War during which he suppressed a pro-Ottoman tribal uprising in his domains. Khaz'al was also the darling of many Sunnite Iraqi nationalists, who sought to foment dissent among Iran's Arab population by referring to Khuzestan as ''Arabest\u0101n'' and glorifying Khaz'al as its independent \"Sultan\".<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica\">{{cite web|last=MILANI|first=MOHSEN M.|title=IRAQ vi.

The Bani Kaab were the largest and most powerful tribe in the province. In the early 19th century the Bani Kaab had dissolved into a number of rival clans that often clashed and feuded with each other.\n\nOf these factions, the Muhaisin clan, led by [[Haji Jabir Khan Ibn Merdaw]], became the strongest and under his leadership the Bani Kaab were reunified under a single authority, the capital of Arabistan being moved from the village of Fallahiyah to the flourishing port city of Mohammerah. Unlike previous rulers of Arabistan, Jabir maintained law and order, and established Mohammerah as a free port and sheikhdom, of which he was Sheikh. Jabir also became the Imperial-appointed governor-general of the province.\n\n==Rise to power==\nAfter Jabir's death in 1881, his elder son, Maz'al, took over as tribal leader and Sheikh of Mohammerah, as well as the provincial governor-general, which was confirmed by an Imperial firman (executive order). However, in June 1897 Maz'al was killed. Some accounts state that he was assassinated by his younger brother,<ref name=\"IranicaKAZAL\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=\u1e34AZ\u02bfAL KHAN|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kazal-khan|accessdate=2016-01-09|last=Shahnavaz|first=Shahbaz}}</ref> Khaz'al, while others state that this was done by a palace guard under orders from Khaz'al.\n\nThereafter Khaz'al assumed his position as Sheikh of Mohammerah, proclaiming himself not only the leader of the Bani Kaab, but also the ruler of the entire province. He then appointed his sons to the governorships of the various cities, towns and villages within his control, including Naseriyeh.\n\nUnlike his brother, Khaz'al had ambition. He had great vision for the future of Arabistan and the Arabs. His rule in Arabistan was \"Supreme and unhindered\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Iran and the Rise of the Reza Shah: From Qajar Collapse to Pahlavi Power|last=Ghani|first=Cyrus|publisher=|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=203|quote=|via=}}</ref> The Arabs saw him as:\n\n{{quote|... a most astute politician and a far-seeing statesman with personal magnetism.

In 1909, the British government asked [[Percy Cox]], British resident to Bushehr, to negotiate an agreement with Khaz'al for APOC to obtain a site on Abadan Island for a refinery, depot, storage tanks, and other operations. The refinery was built and began operating in 1912. Khaz'al was knighted in 1910 and supported Britain in World War I.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the Petroleum Industry|last=Vassiliou|first=M.S|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=285|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the discovery of oil in Arabistan-controlled territory, the British moved quickly to establish control over the vast oil resources in the province, which culminated in the foundation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1909. The British established a treaty with Khaz'al, whereby in exchange for their guaranteed support and protection against any external attack, he would also guarantee to maintain internal security and not interfere with the process of oil extraction. As part of the treaty they were given a monopoly of drilling in the province in return for an annual payment to Khaz'al, though the profits of the company vastly exceeded the annual payments.\n\nAPOC had made Khaz\u2019al extremely wealthy. Not only was Khaz\u2019al receiving revenue from oil production but he also owned a certain amount of shares in the oil company. It was said that \"In all Arabia and its Sheikhdoms, in Mesopotamia and Iran, from the Red Sea to the Caspian, there was no sovereign so rich as Sheikh Khaz\u2019al.\"<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Averting An Iranian Geopolitical Crisis: A Tale of Power Play for Dominance Between Colonial Powers, Tribal and Government Actors in the Pre and Post World War One Era.|last=H|first=RamHormozi|publisher=FriesenPress|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n== Sheikh Khaz'al turns down the throne of Kuwait ==\nIn 1920, the Sheikh of Kuwait, Salim Al Mubarak Al Sabah, ambushed [[Ibn Saud]]'s men over a border dispute between Kuwait and Najd. When [[Percy Cox]] was informed of this event, he sent a letter to Khaz'al offering the Kuwaiti throne to either him or one of his heirs, knowing that Khaz'al would be a wiser ruler. Khaz'al, who considered the Al Sabah as his own family, replied \"Do you expect me to allow the stepping down of Al Mubarak from the throne of Kuwait? Do you think I can accept this?\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Tareekh Al Kuwait Al Siyasi|last=Khalif|first=Hussein|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=221|via=}}</ref> He then asked:\n\n{{quote|...even so, do you think that you have come to me with something new?

Then came the Shah's telegram of April 1924 about his loss of confidence in Reza Khan. In the following summer, Khaz\u2019al brought together some regional magnates and tribal heads - the Vali of Poshtkuh, heads of the Khamseh federation of tribes, and many of the local Arab tribal leaders - in a coalition to resist Reza. They described themselves as the ''Committee of the Rising for Happiness'', and sent telegrams and statements to Tehran. Their statements demanded constitutional government and the return of the Shah, who they said had been forced to remain in Europe. They also attacked military violations of the people's rights in the provinces, and \u2018the massacres of Loristan\u2019; demanded Reza Khan's dismissal; and described the Prince Regent, [[Ali Reza Khan Azod al-Molk]], as the legitimate fount of authority. It was all in the name of the law, justice and the constitution, and \u2018in the illustrious name of His Imperial Majesty Soltan Ahmad Shah, the constitutional monarch\u2019. The committee sought to defend and protect [[Constitutionalism]], and stop the traitors and criminals freely dispensing with it and re-establishing the apparatus of arbitrary rule and injustice once again ... and stop Reza Khan from trampling the principles of democratic government under foot by arbitrary government.\"<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=State and Society in Iran: The Eclipse of the Qajars and the Emergence of the Pahlavis|last=Katouzian|first=Homa|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\nThe Prince Regent wrote an encouraging letter to Khaz\u2019al, all in the name of the Shah and for protection of the constitution, and said that the bearer would discuss matters with the Shaikh in detail. The Shah and the court did not have the courage to commit themselves firmly to such a movement, but would go along with it if there was a very good change of success. Reza Khan subsequently sent him a bombastic tactless telegram, after which the Sheikh expressed his determination to overthrow Reza Khan or perish in the attempt. He declared that he would abandon his defensive measures only if Reza agreed to the following: <blockquote>''(i) to give written guarantees regarding the safety of life and property of those who were helping the Sheikh - especially the Bakhtiari Amir Mujahid. (ii) to withdraw all troops from Arabistan including Bebehan; (iii) to cancel the revenue settlement of the previous year and return to the pre-war basis; and (iv) to give a more specific confirmation of his firmans. On September 13th the British Political Resident was told to convey a message to [[Reza Shah|Reza Khan]] to accept Khaz'al's conditions.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=British Relations with Khazal, Sheikh of Mohammerah|last=|first=|publisher=India Office Records and Private Papers|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>''</blockquote>In the meantime, the Political Resident had interviewed the Sheikh, his second son (Sheikh Abdul Hamid), the Bakhtiari Amir Mujahid and Colonel Riza Quli Khan (who had replaced Colonel Baqir Khan at Shushtar but who had apparently thrown in his lot with the Sheikh); all declared that no peace with Reza Khan was possible; the Sheikh had telegraphed to the Majlis explaining that his opposition was to Reza Khan personally and that it was hoped to persuade the Shah to return. On September 16 the Sheikh had also addressed a telegram to the foreign legations in Tehran in the nature of a proclamation against Reza Khan, who was described as a usurper and a transgressor of the Persian Empire.<ref name=\":6\" /> Reza sent a telegram to Khaz\u2019al that stating that he should either apologise to him and relent publicly, or take the full consequences.\n\nKhaz\u2019al and his remaining associates could muster an army of 25,000 men, which was no less than Reza Khan could throw in the region at the time. In fact the army he had amassed at the foot of the Loristan elevations was 15,000 strong. But Khaz\u2019al did not dare to go into action without British approval. The British government was in no mood to go to war on Khaz\u2019al's behalf. Loraine convinced Khaz\u2019al to desist and to apologize to Reza Khan. In return, he promised to intervene with Reza Khan to halt the advance of his troops into Arabistan. The Shaikh sent an apology, but, realizing that the danger had passed, Reza Khan paid little attention to Loraine's representations on the Shaikh's behalf. He let the troops pour into Arabistan, and demanded that Khaz\u2019al should surrender unconditionally and go straight to Tehran. The Foreign Office was very unhappy at Reza Khan's intransigence. In the presence of Loraine, Khaz\u2019al and Reza met and even swore an oath of friendship on the Qur\u2019an. [[File:Sheikh Khaz'al's yacht.jpeg|left|thumb|259x259px|The Khaz'aliyah Yacht, where Khaz'al was Kidnapped, near ''Qasr Al-Failiyah'' (Failiyah Palace) in Mohammerah]]After a short while, Reza broke all his pledges. In April 1925, he ordered one of his commanders, who had a friendly relationship with Khaz'al, to meet Khaz'al. The commander, General [[Fazlollah Zahedi]], accompanied by several government officials, met with Khaz'al and spent an evening with him onboard his yacht, anchored in the Shatt al-Arab river by his palace in Failiyeh near the city of Mohammerah. Later that evening several gunboats, sent by Reza Khan, stealthily made there way next to the yacht, which was then immediately boarded by fifty Persian troops. The soldiers kidnapped<ref>{{Cite book|title=Days of God: The Revolution in Iran and its Consequences\".|last=Wynn|first=Antony|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Khaz'al and took him by motorboat down the river to Mohammerah, where a car was waiting to take him to the military base in [[Ahvaz|Ahwaz]]. From there he was taken to Dezful, along with his son and heir, and then to the city of Khorramabad in Lorestan, and then eventually to Tehran.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nUpon his arrival, Khaz'al was warmly greeted and well received by Reza Khan, who assured him that his problems would be quickly settled, and that in the meantime, he would be treated very well. However, many of his personal assets in Arabistan were quickly liquidated and his properties eventually came under the domain of the Imperial government after Reza Khan was crowned the new Shah. The emirate was abolished and the provincial authority took full control of regional affairs.\n\nKhaz'al spent the rest of his life under virtual house arrest, unable to travel beyond Tehran's city limits. He was able to retain ownership of his properties in Kuwait and Iraq, where he was exempted from taxation. In May 1936, while alone in his house, as earlier in the day his servants had been taken to court by the police, he was murdered by one of the guards stationed outside his house under direct orders from Reza Shah.\n\n== Freemasonry ==\n[[File:Khaz'al-Khan-gm-Mespotmaia.jpg|left|thumb|316x316px|A photograph of Khaz'al wearing Masonic regalia]]\nSheikh Khaz'al was an active Freemason and a recipient of many high Masonic honours.

What is known, is that he was the first Freemason among the inhabitants of the Persian Gulf, and that he became the Grand Master of Freemasonry in all Mesopotamia. It is likely that the East India Co. established the first Masonic lodge in the area and that Sheikh Khaz'al became its first chairman. \n\nA secret document found after the seizure of Masonic lodges in Egypt was the agenda for al-Abbasi Lodge No. 223 of Cairo for its meeting of 16 December 1923. One of the items discussed the subject of presenting Sheikh Khaz'al, the chairman of 'Khaz'al' lodge, and the regional Grand Master of Mesopotamia, with a decoration in recognition of his valuable services to Freemasonry.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Arab Papers; Freemasonry in the Arab World|last=Safwat|first=Najdat Fathi|publisher=An Arab Research Centre Publication|year=1980|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\n\" The bestowal of honours to all of the Brothers mentioned, in recognition of their great services:\n\nFirstly - His Greatness, the Sardar Aqdas, Ruler of Arabistan and Prince of Nuyan, respected Brother, Khaz'al Khan Sultan of Mohammerah, and Chairman of the Khaz'al Khan Lodge and Provincial Grand Master of Mesopotamia...\"\n\n== Humanitarian acts ==\n\n=== Chaldean victims of the Ottoman Empire ===\n[[File:Khaz'al Al-Ka'bi with Talib Al-Naqib 1920.jpg|thumb|318x318px|Sheikh Khaz'al Bin Jabir (centre) with Sir Hugh Bell (right) and Talib Al Naqib (Left).]]\nOn October 1914, the [[Assyrian genocide]] occurred whereby thousands of Chaldeans were killed or deported by the Ottoman Empire.

He explained that those of his spiritual children who had remained happy in the East were the ones who emigrated to Ahwaz and lived under the shadow of the Sardar Aqdas. The Pope was moved by the benevolence of Sheikh Khaz\u2019al Khan towards those who were distressed amongst the children of the church and he granted him the Order of St Gregory the Great of the rank of Knight Commander, announcing his thanks and his acknowledgment of \"...the grace of this great and generous Arab King\".\n\nIn 1920, Khaz\u2019al was awarded the Order of St Gregory the Great of the rank of Knight Commander. Out of the ''Orders of the Holy Seal,'' it is the fourth highest Papal order and is the highest papal order that can be received by a non-catholic.\n\n== King Faisal I attempts to kidnap Sheikh Khaz\u2019al from Tehran ==\n[[File:Sheikh-khaz'al-king- faisal.png|thumb|311x311px|Sheikh Khaz'al and King Faisal I in Basra]]\nThe first of a number of attempts to rescue Khaz\u2019al was in 1927 by King [[Faisal I of Iraq]]. Faisal felt that the arrest of Khaz\u2019al and the injustice of the Persian government towards [[Mohammerah|Arabistan]] were severe and cruel. Moreover, Faisal felt that he was in debt to Khaz\u2019al for withdrawing his candidacy for the throne of Iraq. For Faisal, after being deposed from the Kingship of Syria, was a King without a country. He viewed this mission not only as an act of loyalty, but more importantly, of duty. Faisal informed [[Nuri al-Said]] of his plan to which the latter recommended using diplomacy rather than physical intervention.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Al Ahwaz, The Past, The Present, The Future|last=Ahmad|first=Nassar|publisher=Dar Al Sharq Al Awsat|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, al-Said, without Faisal's knowledge, informed [[Henry Dobbs]], the British Ambassador to Iraq, of the latters intentions of kidnapping Khaz\u2019al. Dobbs immediately met with Faisal and warned him of the consequences of such an act, stating that \u2018''His Majesty's Government''\u2019 would take a firm stand against him. \"Do not play with fire, King Faisal,\" warned Dobbs.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Khaz'al in literature ==\n\n=== [[Abd al-Mas\u012bh al-Ant\u0101k\u012b]] in The ''Kit\u0101b Riy\u0101\u1e0d Al-Khaz\u02bbal\u012byah F\u012b al-Siy\u0101sah Al-Ins\u0101n\u012byah (The Garden of Khaz\u2019al in Human Politics).'' ===\nThe official author of the book is Khaz\u2019al, but it was written by the Syrian poet and journalist, Abdul Maseeh al Antaki. Born in Aleppo, with Greek origins, he emigrated to Egypt and travelled the Arab world. He established the ''Al Omran'' newspaper in Egypt and became a frequent figure in Khaz\u2019al's court.\n\nHe explains, in the introduction of the book, his objective:<blockquote>''\u201c...and here I am mentioning His Highness the Sardar Aqdas, so that the reader my learn that His Highness the author is the bearer of the sword and the pen, and that amongst the Arab Kings and Princes he is the greatest King, the most magnificent Prince, the respectable gentleman, the most knowledgeable of the knowledgeable, and I am full of what I have seen myself and have known after my long mission and my study, unexaggerated in my story, and not passed the line of rationality and guidance, so that the Arabs may know that His Highness the Sovereign the Mu\u2019iz has combined between determination and knowledge, and has been struck by both by the most blessed arrow, that is how that Kings and Princes should be, if they sought to revive the glory of their forefathers.\u201d'' <ref name=\":4\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== [[Ameen Rihani]] in Molouk el-Arab (Kings of the Arabs) ===\n<blockquote>''\"Mention one who does not know him. For he is amongst the Arab Princes. His Emirate being within the vicinity of the Persian Empire. He is the eldest, after King Hussein, the first to fame, and the greatest in generosity. This is what is known by most of those who know in the Arab countries. What most people outside of Kuwait and Basrah do not know, is that this Arab Prince is of the status of the Princes of the Abbasid era for he is rich, wise and generous together. He is like the Barmakids in his generosity, his taste, and his literature. He loves music, literature and poetry and   leans towards all that provides pleasure and joy, be it mental, social or physical. Yes, the Sheikh Khaz'al has a universal humanitarian taste, for he does not alienate that which is ugly or vilified in life, and he knows no preference or discrimination in his generosity. A singer visits from Aleppo or Damascus to Mohammerah with nothing but her anklets. After residing a few months at the palace, she returns rich and laden with jewels. And the poets come with poems of praise in their pockets, and return from Mohammerah with bags of gold. He is not in need of my testimony for if he were to wear his official gown, he carries on his chest the testimonies of the Kings of the Earth, of which is the Papal Order of Saint Gregory the Great. Amongst those honours are two which are not seen by all, yet are only seen by those who look at this man with the eye of poetry and philosophy. For in his human capacity, he holds decorations from the philosopher [[Epicurus]] and the wise divine mystic [[Ibn Arabi]].\"''</blockquote>\n\n==Views==\nIn regard to religious extremism, Khaz'al said:\n\n{{quote|It is the scourge of the world.

The supply contract was signed in November 1999 with [[Motorola]] as the radio provider alongside Thales. Citylink's shareholders are [[Thales Group]] (33 per cent), [[Fluor Corporation]] (18%), [[Motorola]] (10%), Laing Investment (19.5%) and [[HSBC]] (19.5%). The cost of the design, build and maintain contract was \u00a32&nbsp;billion over twenty years.<br />Various subcontractors were used for the installation work, including Brookvex and Fentons.\n\nA key reasoning for the introduction of the system was in light of the [[King's Cross fire]] disaster, where efforts by the emergency services were hampered by a lack of radio coverage below ground. Work was due to be completed by the end of 2002, although suffered delays due to the necessity of installing the required equipment on an ageing railway infrastructure with no disruption to the operational railway. On 5 June 2006 the [[London Assembly]] published the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|7 July Review Committee]] report, which urged TfL to speed up implementation of the Connect system.<ref name=REGISTER />\n\nThe [[East London line]] was chosen as the first line to receive the TETRA radio in February 2006, as it was the second smallest line and is a mix of surface and sub surface.

Buses and trams share a common fare and ticketing regime, and the DLR, Overground, Underground, and National Rail services another.\n\n===Zonal fare system===\n{{main|London fare zones}}\nRail service fares in the capital are calculated by a zonal fare system. London is divided into [[London fare zones|eleven fare zones]], with every station on the [[London Underground]], [[London Overground]], [[Docklands Light Railway]] and, since 2007, on National Rail services, being in one, or in some cases, two zones. The zones are mostly concentric rings of increasing size emanating from the centre of London. They are (in order):\n\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 1|Zone 1]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 2|Zone 2]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 3|Zone 3]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 4|Zone 4]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 5|Zone 5]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 6|Zone 6]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zones 7\u2013W|Zones 7\u20139, C, G and W]]\n\n===Travelcard===\n{{Main|Travelcard}}\nSuperimposed on these mode-specific regimes is the [[Travelcard]] system, which provides zonal tickets with validities from one day to one year, and off-peak variants. These are accepted on the DLR, buses, railways, trams, and the Underground, and provide a discount on many river services fares.\n\n===Oyster card===\n{{Main|Oyster card}}\nThe [[Oyster card]] is a [[contactless smart card]] system introduced for the public in 2003, which can be used to pay individual fares (pay as you go) or to carry various Travelcards and other passes. It is used by scanning the card at a yellow card reader. Such readers are found on ticket gates where otherwise a paper ticket could be fed through, allowing the gate to open and the passenger to walk through, and on stand-alone Oyster validators, which do not operate a barrier. Since 2010, Oyster Pay as you go has been available on all [[National Rail]] services within London. Oyster Pay as you go has a set of daily maximum charges that are the same as buying the nearest equivalent Day Travelcard.\n\n===Contactless payments===\n{{Main|Contactless payments}}\nContactless Visa, Maestro, MasterCard and American Express debit and credit cards issued in the UK are accepted for travel on London Underground, London Overground, Docklands Light Railway, most National Rail, London Tramlink and Bus services. This works in the same way for the passenger as an [[Oyster card]], including the use of capping and reduced fares compared to paper tickets.

The roundel rendered in blue without any lettering represents TfL as a whole (see Transport for London logo), as well as used in situations where lettering on the roundel is not possible (such as bus receipts, where a logo is a blank roundel with the name \"London Buses\" to the right). The same range of colours is also used extensively in publicity and on the TfL website.\n\nTransport for London has always mounted advertising campaigns to encourage use of the Underground. For example, in 1999, they commissioned artist [[Stephen Whatley]] to paint an interior \u2013 'The Grand Staircase' \u2013 which he did on location inside Buckingham Palace. This painting was reproduced on posters and displayed all over the London Underground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ltmcollection.org/posters/artist/artist.html?IXartist=Stephen%20B%20Whatley|title=Artist: Stephen B Whatley \u2013 Poster and poster artwork collection, London Transport Museum|first=London Transport Museum, 39 Wellington Street, Covent Garden, London WC2E 7BB|last=enquiry@ltmuseum.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010 they commissioned artist Mark Wallinger to assist them in celebrating the 150th anniversary of the Underground, by creating the Labyrinth Project, with one painting to hang permanently in each of the Tube's 270 stations.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tube celebrates 150th birthday with labyrinth art project |author=Mark Brown |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/07/tube-150-birthday-labyrinth-art-project |newspaper=The Guardian |date=7 February 2013 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, in partnership with the [[London Transport Museum]] and sponsored by [[Exterion Media]],<ref name=\"exterionmedia.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.exterionmedia.com/uk/who-we-are/news/exterion-media-sponsors-tfls-transported-by-design-programme/|title=Exterion Media sponsors TfL|date=17 September 2015|access-date=7 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304190036/http://www.exterionmedia.com/uk/who-we-are/news/exterion-media-sponsors-tfls-transported-by-design-programme/|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"exterionmedia.com\"/> TfL launched [[Transported by Design]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tfl.gov.uk/campaign/transported-by-design|title=Transported by Design|author=Transport for London|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417060006/https://tfl.gov.uk/campaign/transported-by-design|archivedate=17 April 2016}}</ref> an 18-month programme of activities.

The supply contract was signed in November 1999 with [[Motorola]] as the radio provider alongside Thales. Citylink's shareholders are [[Thales Group]] (33 per cent), [[Fluor Corporation]] (18%), [[Motorola]] (10%), Laing Investment (19.5%) and [[HSBC]] (19.5%). The cost of the design, build and maintain contract was \u00a32&nbsp;billion over twenty years.<br />Various subcontractors were used for the installation work, including Brookvex and Fentons.\n\nA key reasoning for the introduction of the system was in light of the [[King's Cross fire]] disaster, where efforts by the emergency services were hampered by a lack of radio coverage below ground. Work was due to be completed by the end of 2002, although suffered delays due to the necessity of installing the required equipment on an ageing railway infrastructure with no disruption to the operational railway. On 5 June 2006 the [[London Assembly]] published the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|7 July Review Committee]] report, which urged TfL to speed up implementation of the Connect system.<ref name=REGISTER />\n\nThe [[East London line]] was chosen as the first line to receive the TETRA radio in February 2006, as it was the second smallest line and is a mix of surface and sub surface.

Buses and trams share a common fare and ticketing regime, and the DLR, Overground, Underground, and National Rail services another.\n\n===Zonal fare system===\n{{main|London fare zones}}\nRail service fares in the capital are calculated by a zonal fare system. London is divided into [[London fare zones|eleven fare zones]], with every station on the [[London Underground]], [[London Overground]], [[Docklands Light Railway]] and, since 2007, on National Rail services, being in one, or in some cases, two zones. The zones are mostly concentric rings of increasing size emanating from the centre of London. They are (in order):\n\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 1|Zone 1]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 2|Zone 2]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 3|Zone 3]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 4|Zone 4]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 5|Zone 5]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 6|Zone 6]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zones 7\u2013W|Zones 7\u20139, C, G and W]]\n\n===Travelcard===\n{{Main|Travelcard}}\nSuperimposed on these mode-specific regimes is the [[Travelcard]] system, which provides zonal tickets with validities from one day to one year, and off-peak variants. These are accepted on the DLR, buses, railways, trams, and the Underground, and provide a discount on many river services fares.\n\n===Oyster card===\n{{Main|Oyster card}}\nThe [[Oyster card]] is a [[contactless smart card]] system introduced for the public in 2003, which can be used to pay individual fares (pay as you go) or to carry various Travelcards and other passes. It is used by scanning the card at a yellow card reader. Such readers are found on ticket gates where otherwise a paper ticket could be fed through, allowing the gate to open and the passenger to walk through, and on stand-alone Oyster validators, which do not operate a barrier. Since 2010, Oyster Pay as you go has been available on all [[National Rail]] services within London. Oyster Pay as you go has a set of daily maximum charges that are the same as buying the nearest equivalent Day Travelcard.\n\n===Contactless payments===\n{{Main|Contactless payments}}\nContactless Visa, Maestro, MasterCard and American Express debit and credit cards issued in the UK are accepted for travel on London Underground, London Overground, Docklands Light Railway, most National Rail, London Tramlink and Bus services. This works in the same way for the passenger as an [[Oyster card]], including the use of capping and reduced fares compared to paper tickets.

The roundel rendered in blue without any lettering represents TfL as a whole (see Transport for London logo), as well as used in situations where lettering on the roundel is not possible (such as bus receipts, where a logo is a blank roundel with the name \"London Buses\" to the right). The same range of colours is also used extensively in publicity and on the TfL website.\n\nTransport for London has always mounted advertising campaigns to encourage use of the Underground. For example, in 1999, they commissioned artist [[Stephen Whatley]] to paint an interior \u2013 'The Grand Staircase' \u2013 which he did on location inside Buckingham Palace.
