In [[New Jersey]], I-80 runs for {{convert|68.54|mi|km}} from the [[Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge]] at the [[Pennsylvania]] state line to its eastern terminus at [[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|I-95]] in [[Teaneck, New Jersey|Teaneck]], [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]]. I-95 continues from the end of I-80 to the [[George Washington Bridge]] for access to [[New York City]]. The highway runs parallel to [[U.S. Route&nbsp;46]] (US&nbsp;46) through rural areas of [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren]] and [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex]] counties before heading into more suburban surroundings in [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris County]]. As the road continues into [[Passaic County, New Jersey|Passaic]] and Bergen counties, it heads into more urban areas. The [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] (NJDOT) identifies I-80 within the state as the '''Christopher Columbus Highway'''.<ref name=sld />\n\nA freeway along the I-80 corridor had been planned in 1936 and again in 1955 to provide relief along US&nbsp;46 between the George Washington Bridge and the [[Delaware Water Gap]]. With the establishment of the Interstate Highway System, this planned freeway, which had been identified in some planning documents as the '''Bergen-Passaic Expressway''', would be incorporated into I-80. The freeway was built across New Jersey in various stages from the 1960s to 1973. The westernmost four miles in New Jersey was originally a rerouting of [[U.S. Route 611|US&nbsp;611]] when built; that route was later realigned back into Pennsylvania. In the 1990s, [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]]s had existed on a part of I-80 in Morris County but were opened to regular traffic due to under-use.\n\n== Route description ==\n=== Warren and Sussex counties ===\n[[File:2018-06-28 09 19 00 View east along Interstate 80 just west of Exit 1 within the Delaware Water Gap in Hardwick Township, Warren County, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|left|View east along I-80 just after entering New Jersey within the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area]]\nI-80 enters [[Hardwick Township, New Jersey|Hardwick Township]], [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]] from Pennsylvania on the [[Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge]] over the [[Delaware River]], maintained by the [[Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission]] (DRJTBC).<ref name=sld /> In addition to carrying I-80, this bridge also carries the [[Appalachian Trail]] over the Delaware River.

The [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] (NJDOT) identifies I-80 within the state as the '''Christopher Columbus Highway'''.<ref name=sld />\n\nA freeway along the I-80 corridor had been planned in 1936 and again in 1955 to provide relief along US&nbsp;46 between the George Washington Bridge and the [[Delaware Water Gap]]. With the establishment of the Interstate Highway System, this planned freeway, which had been identified in some planning documents as the '''Bergen-Passaic Expressway''', would be incorporated into I-80. The freeway was built across New Jersey in various stages from the 1960s to 1973. The westernmost four miles in New Jersey was originally a rerouting of [[U.S. Route 611|US&nbsp;611]] when built; that route was later realigned back into Pennsylvania. In the 1990s, [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]]s had existed on a part of I-80 in Morris County but were opened to regular traffic due to under-use.\n\n== Route description ==\n=== Warren and Sussex counties ===\n[[File:2018-06-28 09 19 00 View east along Interstate 80 just west of Exit 1 within the Delaware Water Gap in Hardwick Township, Warren County, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|left|View east along I-80 just after entering New Jersey within the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area]]\nI-80 enters [[Hardwick Township, New Jersey|Hardwick Township]], [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]] from Pennsylvania on the [[Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge]] over the [[Delaware River]], maintained by the [[Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission]] (DRJTBC).<ref name=sld /> In addition to carrying I-80, this bridge also carries the [[Appalachian Trail]] over the Delaware River.

Nine rockfall incidents and one fatality have been reported between 2001 and 2016.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cassi |first1=Sarah |title=Controversial I-80 project in Delaware Water Gap, dubbed the 'Jurassic Park fence,\u2019 goes before the public |url=https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/warren-county/2019/06/controversial-i-80-project-in-delaware-water-gap-dubbed-the-jurassic-park-fence-goes-before-the-public.html |accessdate=August 22, 2019 |agency=lehighvalleylive.com |date=June 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Exit list ==\n{{jcttop|exit|state=NJ|length_ref=<ref name=sld />}}\n{{jctint|exit\n|river=[[Delaware River]]\n|lspan=2\n|mile=0.00\n|mspan=2\n|exit=\u2013\n|road={{jct|state=PA|I|80|dir1=west|PA|611|to2=yes|city1=Stroudsburg|city2=Delaware Water Gap}}\n|notes=Continuation into [[Pennsylvania]];

The club competed in Australia's top-level Rugby League competition from [[1982 NSWRFL season|1982]], when they, along with the [[Canberra Raiders]], were admitted into the then [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership|Sydney Rugby League premiership]] until [[1998 NRL season|1998]] when they formed a new joint venture team, the [[St George Illawarra Dragons]] with the [[St George Dragons]] in 1999,<ref>{{cite news|last=Warne-Smith|first=Drew|title=Saints face test with nerves of Steelers|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/sport/saints-face-test-with-nerves-of-steelers/story-e6frg7mf-1225933040209|accessdate=24 July 2011|newspaper=[[The Australian]]|date=2 October 2010}}</ref> before selling its remaining share in the club to [[WIN Corporation]] in 2018.<ref name=\"dailytelegraph.com.au\">{{cite web | url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/teams/dragons/what-the-new-changes-off-the-field-mean-for-st-george-illawarra/news-story/340f98e0225712ce030c848ab043393d?login=1 | title=Dailytelegraph.com.au &#124; Subscribe to the Daily Telegraph for exclusive stories}}</ref> Over those seventeen seasons the club received three wooden spoons, made the play-offs twice and had a total of three of its players (two [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales Blues]] and one [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland Maroon]]) selected to don the green and gold for [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]].\n\nIllawarra still field stand alone teams in the Tarsha Gale Cup (women's under 18's), SG Ball (under 18's) and Harold Matthews (under 16's) competitions as the Steelers. Their mascot from 1982 to 1998 was the popular Stanley, the Steel Avenger (commonly referred to as Stanley the Steeler).\n\n23,750 capacity [[Wollongong Showground|WIN Stadium]] is their home stadium.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Formation===\nThe Illawarra Rugby League made several attempts to enter the [[New South Wales Rugby League|NSWRL]] competition, the first major attempt was in the 1950s. It made a much more serious attempt for entry into the 1967 season but were blocked by the [[New South Wales Country Rugby League|Country Rugby League]] (CRL) who used their constitution to prevent Illawarra's plans of playing in the Sydney competition. This was a crucial moment in the emergence of the [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]], as it was after Illawarra were blocked and the NSWRL wanted a second new club to enter with [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]], preferably in the South of Sydney due to continued success at that time of the [[St George Dragons]], to avoid the need for a bye that \"the shire's\" submission was successful.\n\nIn this unsuccessful bid, Illawarra were to be backed by the then wealthy Illawarra Leagues Club in [[Church Street, Wollongong]]. The club is the second oldest leagues club in the world. It was originally established to financially support top class rugby league and soccer in the region.\n[[File:Illawarra Steelers v St George Dragons.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Illawarra Steelers v [[St George Dragons]]]]\nOn 13 December 1980, the NSWRL voted almost unanimously for Illawarra to enter in the 1982 season. Only three dissenting votes were counted, which were the three CRL representatives present. Illawarra's organiser Bob Millward told those at the meeting that rugby league in the region depended on this bid getting the go ahead. Interest in the region had turned away from local football to the Sydney competition. The ''[[Illawarra Mercury]]'' daily newspaper was increasing its coverage of the Sydney premiership and Illawarra's inclusion was viewed as the best way of reviving the local league.\n\n===1980s===\nIllawarra entered the competition in 1982, with financial backing from many of the local leagues clubs. Their first captain was star fullback [[John Dorahy]], and first coach [[Allan Fitzgibbon]].<ref name=RL85>{{cite book|title=Rugby League: Action '85|editor=Lester, Gary|publisher=Fairfax Publishing|location=Sydney|year=1984|page=30|isbn=978-0-909558-83-3}}</ref> Unfortunately, the recession hit hard and the leagues club money dried up and the Steelers were a new club in desperate financial trouble. In 1984, [[BlueScope|BHP Steel]] saved the club, signing on as the major sponsor. BHP stayed with the Steelers until they left the NRL at the end of the 1998 season.\n\nTheir first 8 seasons produced 3 [[wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoons]], but things started to improve for the club. In the [[1989 Panasonic Cup (rugby league)|1989 Panasonic Cup]] the club reached the final which was played against the [[Brisbane Broncos]] at [[Parramatta Stadium]]. The Broncos raced to a 16\u20130 lead and it seemed the Steelers much more fancied opponents would run away with the game. But Illawarra, inspired by eventual man-of-the-match, [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] international {{rlp|hb}} [[Andy Gregory]], hit back.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.loverugbyleague.com/feature_1634-legends:-andy-gregory.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912095212/http://www.loverugbyleague.com/feature_1634-legends:-andy-gregory.html |archive-date=12 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Young Illawarra juniors such as [[Brett Rodwell]] and [[Rod Wishart]] made their mark in this game, players that would form the foundation of the club's improved performances in the early 1990s. Illawarra lost the match 22\u201320, however Brisbane scored a try off what appeared to be forward pass. The large Illawarra contingent at Parramatta Stadium booed the Broncos after their win, with Brisbane captain [[Wally Lewis]] gaining their ire by gesturing back. Illawarra's performance inspired Australian folk singer [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]] to write a song about the match. The 1989 season also saw Gregory's [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] and Great Britain team mate, {{rlp|fb}} [[Steve Hampson]], playing for the Steelers.\n\n===1990s===\n1990 saw big improvements with the club finishing not too far away from the top five. The Steelers licensed club opened its doors thanks to the efforts of the local community and businesses.\n\nA new coach by the name of [[Graham Murray]] turned Illawarra into an almost unbeatable force at the [[Wollongong Showground]] in 1991, losing only to the [[Penrith Panthers]] who went on to win the premiership. A big win against Brisbane and a crushing 44\u20134 win over [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown]] were signs of things to come. A crucial refereeing decision by [[Bill Harrigan]] towards the end of the season in a game at Penrith Stadium put an end to their finals aspirations. Harrigan, much to his credit, apologised in the media after the game. Thus Illawarra missed out on a place in the finals by just two points, despite having a season points differential second only to eventual premiers, Penrith.\n\nThe Steelers had revenge in the 1992 pre-season Toohey's Challenge, defeating Brisbane 4\u20132 in a tryless final at [[Dubbo]]. This sparked their successful 1992 [[Winfield Cup]] campaign, going to within one game from the Grand Final.<ref>{{Cite news \n  | last = Barrett\n  | first = Chris\n  | title = Last of the Steelers set to bring down final curtain\n  | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]\n  | location = Australia\n  \n  | date = 26 August 2010\n  | url = http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/last-of-the-steelers-set-to-bring-down-final-curtain-20100825-13s9m.html\n  | accessdate = 5 October 2010}}</ref> Illawarra's first semi-final was against future merger partner St George, beating \"big-brother\" 18\u201316. Next a loss to the Broncos 22\u201312 and their last chance against St George, losing 4\u20130. However, Illawarra were denied tries on several controversial occasions leaving the Steelers with a bitter end to their successful season.\n\nDuring the 1992 season, the Steelers hosted the [[1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australasia|touring]] [[Great Britain Lions]]. In front of 9,500 fans at Steelers Stadium, the visitors won a tight game 11\u201310\n\n1993 and '94 were disappointing in contrast to '92, but the club still managed to finish just outside the top 5 each year.\n\n[[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] hit in 1995 and the Steelers were in for a rough ride. The good work in becoming a credible force in the competition went out the window and the sacking of Graham Murray was the only incident where anyone in the competition lost their job because of Super League. Murray was organising meetings between Illawarra players and Super League officials, as Super League had intentions of either getting the Steelers or possibly a new Illawarra club. Local club Wests Illawarra were reported in the ''Illawarra Mercury'' as being a potential Illawarra Super League club. Local league fans reacted angrily and nothing came of it. Illawarra and its supporters remained loyal to the ARL, though boardmember and then speaker of the house of representatives, [[Stephen Martin (Australian politician)|Dr Stephen Martin]], resigned from the club citing the need to join Super League for the club to survive. Martin would be proved right within less than three years.\n\nIn [[1997 ARL season|1997]]'s stand-alone [[Australian Rugby League]] competition, the Steelers finished sixth, again qualifying for the Finals series, only to bow out in the first week. [[1998 NRL season|1998]] saw the Steelers come agonisingly close to the finals, only missing out because of other results going against them. During season 1998, Illawarra approached St George and initiated joint venture talks. Western Suburbs (whom Illawarra were rumoured to be merging with in the 1980s) and Cronulla both expressed interest in talking with Illawarra but Steelers CEO Bob Millward claimed that the club's preferred partner was St George.\n\nThe Illawarra Steelers produced some brilliant playing talent, most notably International representatives [[Rod Wishart]] and [[Paul McGregor (rugby league)|Paul McGregor]]. Former Steelers players [[Trent Barrett]], [[Shaun Timmins]] and [[Craig Fitzgibbon]] have gone on to represent their country since the Steelers' final stand-alone season in 1998.\n\n===Season summaries===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|+ P=Premiers, R=Runners-up, M=Minor Premierships, F=Finals Appearance, W=Wooden Spoons <br>(Brackets Represent Finals Games)\n|- bgcolor=#bdb76b\n!

The Illawarra and St George contingents are equal stakeholders in the new club, and until 2014, half of the new team's home games were played at [[Wollongong Showground|WIN Stadium]]. The Illawarra Steelers have at times provided the bulk of St George Illawarra's squad, including internationals [[Matt Cooper (rugby league)|Matt Cooper]], [[Luke Bailey (rugby league)|Luke Bailey]], [[Jason Ryles]], [[Shaun Timmins]], [[Trent Barrett]], [[Brett Morris]], [[Josh Morris (rugby league)|Josh Morris]] and [[Ben Creagh]].\n\nSome supporters, however, feel that the Illawarra is not appropriately acknowledged in St George Illawarra, as the logo and main jersey were taken directly from those of St George (albeit with the addition of \"Illawarra\" to the bottom of the emblem). More recently, however, St George Illawarra has taken steps to appropriately acknowledge both St George and Illawarra as equally as possible. One example of this is that, on 18 April 2004 against Penrith at [[Wollongong Showground|WIN Stadium]], St George Illawarra introduced an alternate jersey which was predominantly red (with white stripes), this being recognisably similar to the former Steelers' jersey. This replaced the \"blood and bandages\" jersey of red-and-white horizontal stripes, which was also a former St George jersey.\n\nWhile Illawarra is still somewhat represented in the [[National Rugby League]] by the St George Illawarra Dragons, the Illawarra Steelers participated as a single entity in the NSW Cup until the end of 2017 (as the Illawarra Cutters from 2012 and then Illawarra RLFC in 2017, due to a sponsorship deal with [[Illawarra Coal]]) and in the junior competitions, most notably [[S.G. Ball Cup]] and [[Harold Matthews Cup]]. The Steelers made the Harold Matthews Cup grand final in 2011, losing 13\u201312 to the [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury Bulldogs]].\n \nIn early 2006, [[WIN Television]] Network bought a 25% share in the St. George Illawarra club for $6.5&nbsp;million (half of Illawarra's share), erasing most of the debt Illawarra owed to St. George.  This formalised the strong support the network has shown for the Steelers in years gone by and ensured that Wollongong will continue to host world class rugby league matches. WIN Corp can only sell their stake back to the Steelers, should they wish to withdraw their involvement, thus ensuring Illawarra are properly represented in the joint venture.\n\nIn 2008, Illawarra's debt to St George was paid off, with the 20% sale of the Steelers Club building to a Bermuda-based company owned by Illawarra billionaire (and WIN Television boss) [[Bruce Gordon (businessman)|Bruce Gordon]], plus 25% of its stake in the St George Illawarra Dragons.\n\nIn 2016, Illawarra won their first and only premiership title with the [[2016 Intrust Super Premiership NSW|2016]] against [[Mount Pritchard Mounties]] at [[Parramatta Stadium]].  This was the final ever game to played at this venue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nswrl.com.au/news/2016/10/14/season-review--illawarra-cutters/|title=SEASON REVIEW Illawarra Cutters|website=nswrl.com.au}}</ref>\n\nOne week later, Illawarra claimed the [[NRL State Championship]] on NRL Grand Final day with an emphatic 54\u201312 win over Queensland Cup winners the [[Burleigh Bears]] at [[Stadium Australia]].\n\nOn October 27 2017, it was announced that Illawarra would be replaced by The [[St George Illawarra Dragons]] for The 2018 [[Intrust Super Premiership NSW]] season as part of a restructure in the competition.  It was the first time since 2007 that a full St George Illawarra Dragons side featured in the reserve grade competition.  \n\nThe approach brought the club in line with the NRL\u2019s  \u2018whole of game\u2019 strategy that also saw top-grade squads increased from 25 players to 30.  Club director of rugby league pathways Ian Millward said of the change \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a lot of changes in rugby league at the moment, one of the changes we\u2019ve made is that the reserve grade team is St George Illawarra,\u201d Millward said. \u201cWhat it gives us is a clear pathway where younger players aspire to be Dragons right through to our first grade squad. There\u2019s a clear acknowledgment for coaches, training staff and players that when they\u2019re in our environment they are a part of the St George Illawarra Dragons\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/5016766/2018-dragons-united-as-st-george-illawarra/|title=Dragons bring all senior grades into joint-venture fold|website=Illawarra Mercury}}</ref> \n\nIn August 2018 WIN Corporation purchased the Illawarra Steelers remaining 25% stake in the club for a \"commercially in confidence\" sum. The St. George Dragons and WIN Corporation now have a 50% stake each. WIN Corporation has paid off the $6 million debt the St. George Illawarra Dragons owed the NRL.\n\n==Name and Emblem==\nThe name \"Steelers\" was chosen in reference to the local [[Port Kembla, New South Wales|Port Kembla]] Steelworks, which was the Illawarra region's largest employer. ([[BHP]], who owned the steelworks, eventually sponsored the team for most of their existence.) Other names considered were \"Lions\" and \"Steelies\". The actual 'Steelers' name came after a competition was run to choose a name. The name was chosen by Dapto High School student Roger White, who was also a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers NFL team in the United States. Roger responded to a competition published in the Illawarra Mercury Newspaper.\n<center>\n<gallery perrow=\"2\" align=\"center\" caption=\"Illawarra Steelers - Emblems\">\n<!-- Deleted image removed: Image:illawarra 1988.png|1982-1997 -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: Image:Illawarra steelers logo 1998.jpg|1998- -->\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==Colours==\nThe original Steelers jersey was all scarlet with two white stripes on each sleeve. The alternate design was the same colours in reverse. The club kept this design until 1995, adding a third stripe on each sleeve and three hoops around the middle of the jersey. The Steelers simplistic design compared well with the many \"space-aged\" designs of several other clubs that came and went each season. For the Steelers heritage days in 2005 and 2010, the [[St. George Illawarra Dragons|Dragons]] wore an Illawarra heritage jersey, which was the same as the original Steelers jumper. This move proved popular amongst former Illawarra fans. From 2011 to 2013, the Dragons wore an alternate jersey based on the original Steelers' design.\n\nThe colours scarlet and white were automatically chosen as they were long worn by Illawarra representative teams in several sports. Local miners uniforms in the early 20th century were scarlet and some associate this with the reason for it becoming the region's sporting colours. It is also the colour of the [[Brachychiton acerifolius|Illawarra Flame Tree]], another symbol of the region.\n\nThe Illawarra Cutters wore a kit similar to that of the club's 1980s design.\n\nMany of the current [[National Rugby League|NRL]] clubs are reverting to more simplistic jerseys, such as Illawarra's fellow 1982 entrants Canberra.\n\nThe junior Illawarra sides such as the Harold Matthews and SG Ball sides currently wear the 1980s design.\n\n==Illawarra Steelers Leagues Club==\nThe Illawarra Steelers Leagues Club is situated in the middle of the City Beach precinct, the Steelers Club is located adjacent to WIN Entertainment Centre and [[Wollongong Showground|WIN Stadium]]. It is directly across the road from the grounds Western Grandstand. Established in 1990, the club has struggled financially against much larger and more popular leagues clubs in Wollongong, such as Collegians, Dapto Leagues Club, Wests Illawarra Leagues Club, and Shellharbour Workers Club in Shellharbour. However, after a major restructure of its operations, the Steelers Club has trading profitably over the last 12 months.{{when|date=July 2012}}{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Twenty percent of the club premises were sold to Bermuda-based Billionaire and owner of WIN Corp, [[Bruce Gordon (businessman)|Bruce Gordon]].

The ground for many years was also named Steelers Stadium, which many still affectionately call the ground.\n\nThe Steelers record attendance in Wollongong was against St. George on 21 May 1993 at 17,527. The lowest crowd record was against Cronulla on 6 July 1985 at 3,433.\n\nThe Illawarra sides in lower grades still the play the bulk of home games at WIN Stadium. On rare occasions, the Illawarra Cutters move home games to WIN Jubilee Oval to coincide with NRL fixtures and to also other venues on the South Coast.\n\n==Junior Steelers==\nThe Illawarra Steelers still field teams in the under-age NSWRL competitions of [[Harold Matthews Cup]] (U-16s) and [[S.

Their mascot from 1982 to 1998 was the popular Stanley, the Steel Avenger (commonly referred to as Stanley the Steeler).\n\n23,750 capacity [[Wollongong Showground|WIN Stadium]] is their home stadium. The pies are often cold and the beer is usually warm.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Formation===\nThe Illawarra Rugby League made several attempts to enter the [[New South Wales Rugby League|NSWRL]] competition, the first major attempt was in the 1950s. It made a much more serious attempt for entry into the 1967 season but were blocked by the [[New South Wales Country Rugby League|Country Rugby League]] (CRL) who used their constitution to prevent Illawarra's plans of playing in the Sydney competition. This was a crucial moment in the emergence of the [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]], as it was after Illawarra were blocked and the NSWRL wanted a second new club to enter with [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]], preferably in the South of Sydney due to continued success at that time of the [[St George Dragons]], to avoid the need for a bye that \"the shire's\" submission was successful.\n\nIn this unsuccessful bid, Illawarra were to be backed by the then wealthy Illawarra Leagues Club in [[Church Street, Wollongong]]. The club is the second oldest leagues club in the world. It was originally established to financially support top class rugby league and soccer in the region.\n[[File:Illawarra Steelers v St George Dragons.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Illawarra Steelers v [[St George Dragons]]]]\nOn 13 December 1980, the NSWRL voted almost unanimously for Illawarra to enter in the 1982 season. Only three dissenting votes were counted, which were the three CRL representatives present. Illawarra's organiser Bob Millward told those at the meeting that rugby league in the region depended on this bid getting the go ahead. Interest in the region had turned away from local football to the Sydney competition. The ''[[Illawarra Mercury]]'' daily newspaper was increasing its coverage of the Sydney premiership and Illawarra's inclusion was viewed as the best way of reviving the local league.\n\n===1980s===\nIllawarra entered the competition in 1982, with financial backing from many of the local leagues clubs. Their first captain was star fullback [[John Dorahy]], and first coach [[Allan Fitzgibbon]].<ref name=RL85>{{cite book|title=Rugby League: Action '85|editor=Lester, Gary|publisher=Fairfax Publishing|location=Sydney|year=1984|page=30|isbn=978-0-909558-83-3}}</ref> Unfortunately, the recession hit hard and the leagues club money dried up and the Steelers were a new club in desperate financial trouble. In 1984, [[BlueScope|BHP Steel]] saved the club, signing on as the major sponsor. BHP stayed with the Steelers until they left the NRL at the end of the 1998 season.\n\nTheir first 8 seasons produced 3 [[wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoons]], but things started to improve for the club. In the [[1989 Panasonic Cup (rugby league)|1989 Panasonic Cup]] the club reached the final which was played against the [[Brisbane Broncos]] at [[Parramatta Stadium]]. The Broncos raced to a 16\u20130 lead and it seemed the Steelers much more fancied opponents would run away with the game. But Illawarra, inspired by eventual man-of-the-match, [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] international {{rlp|hb}} [[Andy Gregory]], hit back.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.loverugbyleague.com/feature_1634-legends:-andy-gregory.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912095212/http://www.loverugbyleague.com/feature_1634-legends:-andy-gregory.html |archive-date=12 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Young Illawarra juniors such as [[Brett Rodwell]] and [[Rod Wishart]] made their mark in this game, players that would form the foundation of the club's improved performances in the early 1990s. Illawarra lost the match 22\u201320, however Brisbane scored a try off what appeared to be forward pass. The large Illawarra contingent at Parramatta Stadium booed the Broncos after their win, with Brisbane captain [[Wally Lewis]] gaining their ire by gesturing back. Illawarra's performance inspired Australian folk singer [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]] to write a song about the match. The 1989 season also saw Gregory's [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] and Great Britain team mate, {{rlp|fb}} [[Steve Hampson]], playing for the Steelers.\n\n===1990s===\n1990 saw big improvements with the club finishing not too far away from the top five. The Steelers licensed club opened its doors thanks to the efforts of the local community and businesses.\n\nA new coach by the name of [[Graham Murray]] turned Illawarra into an almost unbeatable force at the [[Wollongong Showground]] in 1991, losing only to the [[Penrith Panthers]] who went on to win the premiership. A big win against Brisbane and a crushing 44\u20134 win over [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown]] were signs of things to come. A crucial refereeing decision by [[Bill Harrigan]] towards the end of the season in a game at Penrith Stadium put an end to their finals aspirations. Harrigan, much to his credit, apologised in the media after the game. Thus Illawarra missed out on a place in the finals by just two points, despite having a season points differential second only to eventual premiers, Penrith.\n\nThe Steelers had revenge in the 1992 pre-season Toohey's Challenge, defeating Brisbane 4\u20132 in a tryless final at [[Dubbo]]. This sparked their successful 1992 [[Winfield Cup]] campaign, going to within one game from the Grand Final.<ref>{{Cite news \n  | last = Barrett\n  | first = Chris\n  | title = Last of the Steelers set to bring down final curtain\n  | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]\n  | location = Australia\n  \n  | date = 26 August 2010\n  | url = http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/last-of-the-steelers-set-to-bring-down-final-curtain-20100825-13s9m.html\n  | accessdate = 5 October 2010}}</ref> Illawarra's first semi-final was against future merger partner St George, beating \"big-brother\" 18\u201316. Next a loss to the Broncos 22\u201312 and their last chance against St George, losing 4\u20130. However, Illawarra were denied tries on several controversial occasions leaving the Steelers with a bitter end to their successful season.\n\nDuring the 1992 season, the Steelers hosted the [[1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australasia|touring]] [[Great Britain Lions]]. In front of 9,500 fans at Steelers Stadium, the visitors won a tight game 11\u201310\n\n1993 and '94 were disappointing in contrast to '92, but the club still managed to finish just outside the top 5 each year.\n\n[[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] hit in 1995 and the Steelers were in for a rough ride. The good work in becoming a credible force in the competition went out the window and the sacking of Graham Murray was the only incident where anyone in the competition lost their job because of Super League. Murray was organising meetings between Illawarra players and Super League officials, as Super League had intentions of either getting the Steelers or possibly a new Illawarra club. Local club Wests Illawarra were reported in the ''Illawarra Mercury'' as being a potential Illawarra Super League club. Local league fans reacted angrily and nothing came of it. Illawarra and its supporters remained loyal to the ARL, though boardmember and then speaker of the house of representatives, [[Stephen Martin (Australian politician)|Dr Stephen Martin]], resigned from the club citing the need to join Super League for the club to survive. Martin would be proved right within less than three years.\n\nIn [[1997 ARL season|1997]]'s stand-alone [[Australian Rugby League]] competition, the Steelers finished sixth, again qualifying for the Finals series, only to bow out in the first week. [[1998 NRL season|1998]] saw the Steelers come agonisingly close to the finals, only missing out because of other results going against them. During season 1998, Illawarra approached St George and initiated joint venture talks. Western Suburbs (whom Illawarra were rumoured to be merging with in the 1980s) and Cronulla both expressed interest in talking with Illawarra but Steelers CEO Bob Millward claimed that the club's preferred partner was St George.\n\nThe Illawarra Steelers produced some brilliant playing talent, most notably International representatives [[Rod Wishart]] and [[Paul McGregor (rugby league)|Paul McGregor]]. Former Steelers players [[Trent Barrett]], [[Shaun Timmins]] and [[Craig Fitzgibbon]] have gone on to represent their country since the Steelers' final stand-alone season in 1998.\n\n===Season summaries===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|+ P=Premiers, R=Runners-up, M=Minor Premierships, F=Finals Appearance, W=Wooden Spoons <br>(Brackets Represent Finals Games)\n|- bgcolor=#bdb76b\n!

The Illawarra and St George contingents are equal stakeholders in the new club, and until 2014, half of the new team's home games were played at [[Wollongong Showground|WIN Stadium]]. The Illawarra Steelers have at times provided the bulk of St George Illawarra's squad, including internationals [[Matt Cooper (rugby league)|Matt Cooper]], [[Luke Bailey (rugby league)|Luke Bailey]], [[Jason Ryles]], [[Shaun Timmins]], [[Trent Barrett]], [[Brett Morris]], [[Josh Morris (rugby league)|Josh Morris]] and [[Ben Creagh]].\n\nSome supporters, however, feel that the Illawarra is not appropriately acknowledged in St George Illawarra, as the logo and main jersey were taken directly from those of St George (albeit with the addition of \"Illawarra\" to the bottom of the emblem). More recently, however, St George Illawarra has taken steps to appropriately acknowledge both St George and Illawarra as equally as possible. One example of this is that, on 18 April 2004 against Penrith at [[Wollongong Showground|WIN Stadium]], St George Illawarra introduced an alternate jersey which was predominantly red (with white stripes), this being recognisably similar to the former Steelers' jersey. This replaced the \"blood and bandages\" jersey of red-and-white horizontal stripes, which was also a former St George jersey.\n\nWhile Illawarra is still somewhat represented in the [[National Rugby League]] by the St George Illawarra Dragons, the Illawarra Steelers participated as a single entity in the NSW Cup until the end of 2017 (as the Illawarra Cutters from 2012 and then Illawarra RLFC in 2017, due to a sponsorship deal with [[Illawarra Coal]]) and in the junior competitions, most notably [[S.G. Ball Cup]] and [[Harold Matthews Cup]]. The Steelers made the Harold Matthews Cup grand final in 2011, losing 13\u201312 to the [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury Bulldogs]].\n \nIn early 2006, [[WIN Television]] Network bought a 25% share in the St. George Illawarra club for $6.5&nbsp;million (half of Illawarra's share), erasing most of the debt Illawarra owed to St. George.  This formalised the strong support the network has shown for the Steelers in years gone by and ensured that Wollongong will continue to host world class rugby league matches. WIN Corp can only sell their stake back to the Steelers, should they wish to withdraw their involvement, thus ensuring Illawarra are properly represented in the joint venture.\n\nIn 2008, Illawarra's debt to St George was paid off, with the 20% sale of the Steelers Club building to a Bermuda-based company owned by Illawarra billionaire (and WIN Television boss) [[Bruce Gordon (businessman)|Bruce Gordon]], plus 25% of its stake in the St George Illawarra Dragons.\n\nIn 2016, Illawarra won their first and only premiership title with the [[2016 Intrust Super Premiership NSW|2016]] against [[Mount Pritchard Mounties]] at [[Parramatta Stadium]].  This was the final ever game to played at this venue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nswrl.com.au/news/2016/10/14/season-review--illawarra-cutters/|title=SEASON REVIEW Illawarra Cutters|website=nswrl.com.au}}</ref>\n\nOne week later, Illawarra claimed the [[NRL State Championship]] on NRL Grand Final day with an emphatic 54\u201312 win over Queensland Cup winners the [[Burleigh Bears]] at [[Stadium Australia]].\n\nOn October 27 2017, it was announced that Illawarra would be replaced by The [[St George Illawarra Dragons]] for The 2018 [[Intrust Super Premiership NSW]] season as part of a restructure in the competition.  It was the first time since 2007 that a full St George Illawarra Dragons side featured in the reserve grade competition.  \n\nThe approach brought the club in line with the NRL\u2019s  \u2018whole of game\u2019 strategy that also saw top-grade squads increased from 25 players to 30.  Club director of rugby league pathways Ian Millward said of the change \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a lot of changes in rugby league at the moment, one of the changes we\u2019ve made is that the reserve grade team is St George Illawarra,\u201d Millward said. \u201cWhat it gives us is a clear pathway where younger players aspire to be Dragons right through to our first grade squad. There\u2019s a clear acknowledgment for coaches, training staff and players that when they\u2019re in our environment they are a part of the St George Illawarra Dragons\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/5016766/2018-dragons-united-as-st-george-illawarra/|title=Dragons bring all senior grades into joint-venture fold|website=Illawarra Mercury}}</ref> \n\nIn August 2018 WIN Corporation purchased the Illawarra Steelers remaining 25% stake in the club for a \"commercially in confidence\" sum. The St. George Dragons and WIN Corporation now have a 50% stake each. WIN Corporation has paid off the $6 million debt the St. George Illawarra Dragons owed the NRL.\n\n==Name and Emblem==\nThe name \"Steelers\" was chosen in reference to the local [[Port Kembla, New South Wales|Port Kembla]] Steelworks, which was the Illawarra region's largest employer. ([[BHP]], who owned the steelworks, eventually sponsored the team for most of their existence.) Other names considered were \"Lions\" and \"Steelies\". The actual 'Steelers' name came after a competition was run to choose a name. The name was chosen by Dapto High School student Roger White, who was also a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers NFL team in the United States. Roger responded to a competition published in the Illawarra Mercury Newspaper.\n<center>\n<gallery perrow=\"2\" align=\"center\" caption=\"Illawarra Steelers - Emblems\">\n<!-- Deleted image removed: Image:illawarra 1988.png|1982-1997 -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: Image:Illawarra steelers logo 1998.jpg|1998- -->\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==Colours==\nThe original Steelers jersey was all scarlet with two white stripes on each sleeve. The alternate design was the same colours in reverse. The club kept this design until 1995, adding a third stripe on each sleeve and three hoops around the middle of the jersey. The Steelers simplistic design compared well with the many \"space-aged\" designs of several other clubs that came and went each season. For the Steelers heritage days in 2005 and 2010, the [[St. George Illawarra Dragons|Dragons]] wore an Illawarra heritage jersey, which was the same as the original Steelers jumper. This move proved popular amongst former Illawarra fans. From 2011 to 2013, the Dragons wore an alternate jersey based on the original Steelers' design.\n\nThe colours scarlet and white were automatically chosen as they were long worn by Illawarra representative teams in several sports. Local miners uniforms in the early 20th century were scarlet and some associate this with the reason for it becoming the region's sporting colours. It is also the colour of the [[Brachychiton acerifolius|Illawarra Flame Tree]], another symbol of the region.\n\nThe Illawarra Cutters wore a kit similar to that of the club's 1980s design.\n\nMany of the current [[National Rugby League|NRL]] clubs are reverting to more simplistic jerseys, such as Illawarra's fellow 1982 entrants Canberra.\n\nThe junior Illawarra sides such as the Harold Matthews and SG Ball sides currently wear the 1980s design.\n\n==Illawarra Steelers Leagues Club==\nThe Illawarra Steelers Leagues Club is situated in the middle of the City Beach precinct, the Steelers Club is located adjacent to WIN Entertainment Centre and [[Wollongong Showground|WIN Stadium]]. It is directly across the road from the grounds Western Grandstand. Established in 1990, the club has struggled financially against much larger and more popular leagues clubs in Wollongong, such as Collegians, Dapto Leagues Club, Wests Illawarra Leagues Club, and Shellharbour Workers Club in Shellharbour. However, after a major restructure of its operations, the Steelers Club has trading profitably over the last 12 months.{{when|date=July 2012}}{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Twenty percent of the club premises were sold to Bermuda-based Billionaire and owner of WIN Corp, [[Bruce Gordon (businessman)|Bruce Gordon]].

The ground for many years was also named Steelers Stadium, which many still affectionately call the ground.\n\nThe Steelers record attendance in Wollongong was against St. George on 21 May 1993 at 17,527. The lowest crowd record was against Cronulla on 6 July 1985 at 3,433.\n\nThe Illawarra sides in lower grades still the play the bulk of home games at WIN Stadium. On rare occasions, the Illawarra Cutters move home games to WIN Jubilee Oval to coincide with NRL fixtures and to also other venues on the South Coast.\n\n==Junior Steelers==\nThe Illawarra Steelers still field teams in the under-age NSWRL competitions of [[Harold Matthews Cup]] (U-16s) and [[S. G. Ball Cup]] (U-18s).  In 2019, Illawarra won the [[S. G.

These measures were enacted by the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] states at the turn of the 20th century, and by [[Oklahoma]] when it gained statehood in 1907,<ref name=\"Kentucky\"/> although ''not'' by the former [[border states (American Civil War)|border slave states]]. Their actions were designed to thwart the objective of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]], [[ratified]] in 1870, which sought to protect the [[Voting rights in the United States|suffrage]] of [[freedmen]] after the [[American Civil War]].\n\nDuring the later elections of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] era, beginning in the 1870s, [[White people|white]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] used violence by [[paramilitary]] groups, as well as fraud, to suppress black [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] voters and turn Republicans out of office.  After regaining control of the state legislatures, Democrats were alarmed by a late 19th-century alliance between Republicans and Populists that cost them some elections. After achieving control of state legislatures, white Democrats added to previous efforts and achieved widespread disenfranchisement by law: from 1890 to 1908, Southern state legislatures passed new constitutions, constitutional amendments, and laws that made voter registration and voting more difficult, especially when administered by white staff in a discriminatory way. They succeeded in disenfranchising most of the black citizens, as well as many [[Poor White|poor whites]] in the South, and voter rolls dropped dramatically in each state. The Republican Party was nearly eliminated in the region for decades, and the Democrats established one-party control throughout the southern states.<ref>Valelly, Richard M.; ''The Two Reconstructions: The Struggle for Black Enfranchisement'' University of Chicago Press, 2009, pp. 134-139 {{ISBN|9780226845302}}</ref>\n\nIn 1912, the Republican Party was split when Roosevelt ran against the party regular, Taft. In the South by this time, the Republican Party had been hollowed out by the disenfranchisement of African Americans, who were largely excluded from voting. Democrat [[Woodrow Wilson]] was elected as the first southern [[President of the United States|President]] since 1856. He was re-elected in 1916, in a much closer presidential contest. During his first term, Wilson satisfied the request of Southerners in his cabinet and instituted overt [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] throughout federal government workplaces, as well as [[racial discrimination]] in hiring.<ref name=\"Teachingamericanhistory.org\">{{cite web |url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?documentprint=1115 |title=Another Open Letter to Woodrow Wilson W.E.B.

They favored seniority privileges in Congress, which became the standard by 1920, and Southerners controlled chairmanships of important [[Congressional committee|committees]], as well as leadership of the national Democratic Party.<ref name=\"valelly146-147\"/> During the [[Great Depression]], legislation establishing numerous national social programs were passed without the representation of [[African Americans]], leading to gaps in program coverage and discrimination against them in operations. In addition, because black Southerners were not listed on local voter rolls, they were automatically excluded from [[jury duty|serving in local courts]]. Juries were [[all-white jury|all white]] across the South.\n\nPolitical disenfranchisement did not end until after passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which authorized the federal government to monitor voter registration practices and elections where populations were historically underrepresented, and to enforce constitutional voting rights. The challenge to voting rights has continued into the 21st century, as shown by numerous court cases in 2016 alone, though attempts to restrict voting rights for political advantage have not been confined to the Southern states. Another method of seeking political advantage through the voting system is the [[Gerrymandering in the United States|gerrymandering of electoral boundaries]], as was the case of North Carolina, which in January 2018 was declared by a federal court to be unconstitutional.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/us/north-carolina-gerrymander.html North Carolina Is Ordered to Redraw Its Congressional Map]</ref> Such cases are expected to reach the Supreme Court.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/us/gerrymander-court-north-carolina-pennsylvania.html Is Partisan Gerrymandering Legal?

Congress passed the [[Reconstruction Acts]], starting in 1867, establishing military districts to oversee the affairs of these states pending reconstruction.\n\nDuring the Reconstruction era, blacks constituted absolute majorities of the populations in [[Mississippi]] and [[South Carolina]], were equal to the white population in Louisiana, and represented more than 40 percent of the population in four other former Confederate states. Southern whites, fearing black domination, resisted the [[freedmen]]'s exercise of political power.<ref>Gabriel J. Chin & Randy Wagner, \"The Tyranny of the Minority: Jim Crow and the Counter-Majoritarian Difficulty,\" [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=963036&high=%20Gabriel%20CHin 43 ''Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review'' 65 (2008)]</ref> In 1867, black men voted for the first time. By the [[1868 United States presidential election|1868 presidential election]], Texas, Mississippi, and Virginia had still not been re-admitted to the Union. General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was elected as president thanks in part to 700,000 black voters. In February 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified; it was designed to protect blacks' right to vote from infringement by the states.\n\nWhite supremacist [[paramilitary]] organizations, allied with Southern Democrats, used intimidation, violence and even committed assassinations in order to repress blacks and prevent them from exercising their [[civil and political rights]] in elections from 1868 until the mid-1870s. The insurgent [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) was formed in 1865 in [[Tennessee]] (as a backlash to defeat in the war) and it quickly became a powerful secret [[vigilante]] group, with chapters across the South. The Klan initiated a campaign of intimidation directed against blacks and sympathetic whites. Their violence included [[vandalism]] and destruction of property, physical attacks and assassinations, and [[lynching]]s. Teachers who came from the North to teach freedmen were sometimes attacked or intimidated as well.\n\nThe toll of Klan murders and attacks led [[United States Congress|Congress]] to pass laws to end the violence. In 1870, the strongly [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congress passed the [[Enforcement Acts]], imposing penalties for conspiracy to deny black suffrage.<ref name=\"Andrews\">{{cite book\n  | last =Andrews\n  | first =E. Benjamin\n  | authorlink =Elisha Benjamin Andrews\n  | title =History of the United States\n  | publisher =Charles Scribner's Sons\n  | year =1912\n  | location =New York }}</ref> The Acts empowered the President to deploy the armed forces to suppress organizations that deprived people of rights guaranteed by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. Organizations whose members appeared in arms were considered in rebellion against the United States. The President could suspend ''[[habeas corpus]]'' under those circumstances. President Grant used these provisions in parts of the [[Carolinas]] in late 1871. United States marshals supervised state voter registrations and elections and could summon the help of military or naval forces if needed.<ref name=\"Andrews\" /> These measures led to the demise of the first Klan by the early 1870s.\n\nNew paramilitary groups quickly sprang up, as tens of thousands of veterans belonged to gun clubs and similar groups. A second wave of violence began, resulting in over 1,000 deaths, usually black or Republican. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in 1876 in ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'', arising from trials related to the [[Colfax Massacre]], that protections of the Fourteenth Amendment, which the Enforcement Acts were intended to support, did not apply to the actions of individuals, but only to the actions of state governments. They recommended that persons seek relief from state courts, which had not been supportive of freedmen's rights.\n\nThe [[paramilitary]] organizations that arose in the mid to late 1870s were part of continuing [[insurgency]] in the South after the Civil War, as armed veterans in the South resisted social changes, and worked to prevent black Americans and other Republicans from voting and running for office. Such groups included the [[White League]], formed in Louisiana in 1874 from white [[militias]], with chapters forming in other Southern states; the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], formed in 1875 in Mississippi but also active in [[North Carolina]] and South Carolina; and other \"White Liners,\" such as [[rifle clubs]] and the [[Knights of the White Camellia]]. Compared to the Klan, they were open societies, better organized and devoted to the political goal of regaining control of the state legislatures and suppressing Republicans, including most blacks. They often solicited newspaper coverage for publicity to increase their threat. The scale of operations was such that in 1876, North Carolina had 20,000 men in rifle clubs. Made up of well-armed Confederate veterans, a class that covered most adult men who could have fought in the war, the paramilitary groups worked for political aims: to turn Republicans out of office, disrupt their organizing, and use force to intimidate and terrorize [[freedmen]] to keep them away from the polls. Such groups have been described as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party\".<ref>George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132</ref>\n\nThey were instrumental in many Southern states in driving blacks away from the polls and ensuring a white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] takeover of legislatures and governorships in most Southern states in the 1870s, most notoriously during the [[1876 United States presidential election|controversial 1876 elections]]. As a result of a national [[Compromise of 1877]] arising from the 1876 presidential election, the federal government withdrew its military forces from the South, formally ending the Reconstruction era. By that time, Southern Democrats had effectively regained control in [[Louisiana]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Florida]] \u2013 they identified as the [[Redeemers]]. In the South, the process of white Democrats regaining control of state governments has been called \"the Redemption\". African-American historians sometimes call the Compromise of 1877 \"The Great Betrayal\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Key Events in the Presidency of Rutherford B.

Other measures followed, particularly near the end of the century, after a Republican-Populist alliance caused the Democrats to temporarily lose some Congressional seats and control of some gubernatorial positions.\n\nTo secure their power, the Democrats worked to exclude blacks (and most Republicans) from politics. The results could be seen across the South. After Reconstruction, Tennessee initially had the most \"consistently competitive political system in the South\".<ref name=\"shaping\">J. Morgan Kousser, ''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South, 1880\u20131910'', p.104</ref> A bitter election battle in 1888, marked by unmatched corruption and violence, resulted in white Democrats taking over the state legislature. To consolidate their power, they worked to suppress the black vote and sharply reduced it through changes in voter registration, requiring [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], as well as changing election procedures to make voting more complex.\n\nIn 1890 Mississippi adopted a new constitution, which contained provisions for voter registration which required voters pay [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] and pass a [[literacy test]]. The literacy test was subjectively applied by white administrators, and the two provisions effectively disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites. The constitutional provisions survived a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] challenge in ''[[Williams v. Mississippi]]'' (1898). Other southern states quickly adopted new constitutions and what they called the \"Mississippi plan\". By 1908, all states of the former Confederacy had passed new constitutions or suffrage amendments, sometimes bypassing general elections to achieve this. Legislators created a variety of barriers, including longer residency requirements, rule variations, literacy and understanding tests, which were subjectively applied against minorities, or were particularly hard for the poor to fulfill.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H.

You had set us an impossible task.<br/><br/>We did not disfranchise the negroes until 1895. Then we had a constitutional convention convened which took the matter up calmly, deliberately, and avowedly with the purpose of disfranchising as many of them as we could under the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments. We adopted the educational qualification as the only means left to us, and the negro is as contented and as prosperous and as well protected in South Carolina to-day as in any State of the Union south of the Potomac.

Apportionment of seats was still based on total population (with the assumption of the usual number of voting males in relation to the residents); as a result white Southerners commanded a number of seats far out of proportion to the voters they represented.<ref name=\"committee\">[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1900/12/21/102438623.pdf \u2018COMMITTEE AT ODDS ON REAPPORTIONMENT\u2019], ''The New York Times'', 20 Dec 1900, accessed 10 Mar 2008</ref> In the end, Congress did not act on this issue, as the Southern bloc of Democrats had sufficient power to reject or stall such action. For decades, white Southern Democrats exercised Congressional representation derived from a full count of the population, but they disfranchised several million black and white citizens. Southern white Democrats comprised the \"[[Solid South]]\", a powerful voting bloc in Congress until the mid-20th century. Their representatives, re-elected repeatedly by one-party states, exercised the power of seniority, controlling numerous chairmanships of important committees in both houses. Their power allowed them to have control over rules, budgets and important patronage projects, among other issues, as well as to defeat bills to make [[lynching]] a federal crime.<ref name=\"p10\"/>\n\n==New state constitutions, 1890 to 1908==\n{{See also|Voting rights in the United States}}\nDespite white Southerners' complaints about Reconstruction, several Southern states kept most provisions of their Reconstruction constitutions for more than two decades, until late in the 19th century.<ref>W.E.B. DuBois, ''Black Reconstruction in America, 1868\u20131880'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1935; reprint, New York: The Free Press, 1998</ref> In some states, the number of blacks elected to local offices reached a peak in the 1880s although Reconstruction had ended. They had an influence at the local level, where much of government took place, although they did not win many statewide or national seats. Subsequently, state legislatures passed restrictive laws or constitutions that made voter registration and election rules more complicated. As literacy tests and other restrictions could be applied subjectively, these changes sharply limited the vote by most blacks and, often, many poor whites; voter rolls dropped across the South into the new century.\n\n[[Florida]] approved a new constitution in 1885 that included provisions for [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] as a prerequisite for voter registration and voting. From 1890 to 1908, ten of the eleven Southern states rewrote their constitutions. All included provisions that effectively restricted voter registration and suffrage, including requirements for poll taxes, increased residency, and subjective [[literacy tests]].<ref name=\"Michael Perman 2001\">Michael Perman.''Struggle for Mastery: Disfranchisement in the South, 1888\u20131908''. Chapel Hill: North Carolina Press, 2001, Introduction</ref>\n\nWith educational improvements, blacks had markedly increased their rate of literacy. By 1891, their illiteracy had declined to 58 percent, whilst the rate of white illiteracy in the South at that time was 31 percent.<ref>[http://www.sefatl.org/1878.asp 1878\u20131895: Disenfranchisement (sic), Southern Education Foundation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607074413/http://www.sefatl.org/1878.asp |date=2008-06-07 }}, accessed 16 Mar 2008</ref> Some states used [[grandfather clause]]s to exempt white voters from literacy tests altogether. Other states required otherwise eligible black voters to meet literacy and knowledge requirements to the satisfaction of white registrars, who applied subjective judgment and, in the process, rejected most black voters. By 1900, the majority of blacks were literate, but even many of the best-educated of these men continued to \"fail\" the literacy tests administered by white registrars.\n\nThe historian [[J. Morgan Kousser]] noted, \"Within the Democratic party, the chief impetus for restriction came from the black belt members,\" whom he identified as \"always socioeconomically privileged.\" In addition to wanting to affirm white supremacy, the [[planter (American South)|planter]] and business elite were concerned about voting by lower-class and uneducated whites. Kousser found, \"They disfranchised these whites as willingly as they deprived blacks of the vote.\"<ref>J. Morgan Kousser.''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974</ref> Perman noted the goals of disenfranchisement resulted from several factors. Competition between white elites and white lower classes, for example, and a desire to prevent alliances between lower-class white and black Americans, as had been seen in Populist-Republican alliances, led white Democratic legislators to restrict voter rolls.<ref name=\"Michael Perman 2001\" />\n\nWith the passage of new constitutions, Southern states adopted provisions that caused disenfranchisement of large portions of their populations by skirting US constitutional protections of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. While their voter registration requirements applied to all citizens, in practice they disenfranchised most blacks. As in Alabama, they also \"would remove [from voter registration rolls] the less educated, less organized, more impoverished whites as well \u2013 and that would ensure one-party Democratic rules through most of the 20th century in the South\".<ref name=\"p10\" /><ref name=\"Glenn Feldman 2004, pp. 135\u2013136\">Glenn Feldman, ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, pp.&nbsp;135\u2013136</ref>\n\nThe new provisions of the state constitutions almost entirely eliminated black voting. Although nothing approaching precise data exists, it is estimated that in the late 1930s less than one percent of blacks in the Deep South and around five percent in the Rim South were registered to vote,<ref>Mickey, Robert; ''Paths Out of Dixie: The Democratization of Authoritarian Enclaves in America's Deep South, 1944-1972'', p. 87 {{ISBN|1400838789}}</ref> and that the proportion actually voting even in general elections, which were of no consequence due to complete Democratic dominance, was much smaller still. Secondly, the Democratic legislatures passed [[Jim Crow laws]] to assert white supremacy, establish [[racial segregation]] in public facilities, and treat blacks as second-class citizens. The landmark court decision in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896) held that \"separate but equal\" facilities, as on railroad cars, were constitutional. The new constitutions passed numerous Supreme Court challenges. In cases where a particular restriction was overruled by the Supreme Court in the early 20th century, states quickly devised new methods of excluding most blacks from voting, such as the [[white primary]]. Democratic Party primaries became the only competitive contests in southern states.\n\nFor the national Democratic Party, the alignment after Reconstruction resulted in a powerful Southern region that was useful for congressional clout. Nevertheless, prior to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the \"Solid South\" inhibited the national party from fulfilling center-left initiatives{{clarify|date=February 2017}} desired since the days of [[William Jennings Bryan]]. [[Woodrow Wilson#Segregation in the federal government|Woodrow Wilson]], one of two Democrats elected to the presidency between Abraham Lincoln and [[Franklin D.

The literacy test was administered by the voting registrar; in practice, they were white Democrats. Provisions in the constitution also included a [[grandfather clause]], which provided a loophole to enable illiterate whites to register to vote. It said that \"Any citizen who was a voter on January 1, 1867, or his son or grandson, or any person naturalized prior to January 1, 1898, if applying for registration before September 1, 1898, might vote, notwithstanding illiteracy or poverty.\" Separate registration lists were kept for whites and blacks, making it easy for white registrars to discriminate against blacks in literacy tests. The constitution of 1898 also required a person to satisfy a longer [[residency requirement]] in the state, county, parish, and precinct before voting than did the constitution of 1879. This worked against the lower classes, who were more likely to move frequently for work, especially in agricultural areas where there were many migrant workers and sharecroppers.\n\nThe effect of these changes on the population of black voters in Louisiana was devastating; by 1900 black voters were reduced from 130,334 to 5,320 on the rolls. By 1910, only 730 blacks were registered, less than 0.5% of eligible black men. \"In 27 of the state's sixty parishes, not a single black voter was registered any longer; in nine more parishes, only one black voter was.\"<ref name=\"p12\"/>\n\n===North Carolina===\nIn 1894, a coalition of Republicans and the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]] won control of the North Carolina state legislature (and with it, the ability to elect two US Senators) and were successful in electing several US Representatives elected through [[electoral fusion]].<ref name=\"fusion\">{{cite web|url=http://www.northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/58/entry|title=Fusion Politics - North Carolina History Project|first=Website design and web development by Mango Web Design|last=http://mangowebdesign.com|website=northcarolinahistory.org|accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref> The fusion coalition made impressive gains in the 1896 election when their legislative majority expanded. Republican [[Daniel Lindsay Russell]] won the gubernatorial race in 1897, the first Republican governor of the state since the end of Reconstruction in 1877. The election also resulted in more than 1,000 elected or appointed black officials, including the election in 1897 of [[George Henry White]] to Congress, as a member of the House of Representatives.\n\nAt the 1898 election, the Democrats ran on [[White Supremacy]] and disenfranchisement in a bitter race-baiting campaign led by [[Furnifold McLendel Simmons]] and [[Josephus Daniels]], editor and publisher of ''[[The News & Observer|The Raleigh News & Observer]].'' The Republican/Populist coalition disintegrated, and the Democrats won the North Carolina 1898 election and the following 1900 election. Simmons was elected as the state's US senator in 1900, holding office until 1931 through multiple re-elections by the state legislature and by popular vote after 1920.\n\nThe Democrats used their power in the state legislature to disenfranchise minorities, primarily blacks, and ensure that Democratic Party and white power would not be threatened again.<ref name=\"shaping\" /><ref name=\"fusion\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.unc.edu/ncc/1898/1898.html|title=The North Carolina Election of 1898 \u00b7 UNC Libraries|website=www.lib.unc.edu|accessdate=2 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427010250/http://www.lib.unc.edu/ncc/1898/1898.html|archive-date=27 April 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> They passed laws restricting voter registration.

The Readjuster Party held control from 1881 to 1883, electing a governor and controlling the legislature, which also elected a US Senator from the state. As in North Carolina, state Democrats were able to divide Readjuster supporters through appeals to White Supremacy. After regaining power, Democrats changed state laws and the constitution in 1902 to disenfranchise blacks. They ratified the new constitution in the legislature and did not submit it to popular vote. Voting in Virginia fell by nearly half as a result of the disenfranchisement of blacks.<ref name=\"historical\"/><ref name = \"Dabney\"/> The eighty-year stretch of white Democratic control ended only in the late 1960s after passage and enforcement of the federal [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965 and the collapse of the [[Byrd Organization]] machine.\n\n===Border States: failed disenfranchisement===\nThe five [[border states (American Civil War)|border states]] of Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky and Missouri, had legacies similar to the Confederate slave states from the Civil War. The Border States, all slave states, also established laws requiring racial segregation between the 1880s and 1900s; however, disenfranchisement of blacks was never attained to any significant degree. Most Border States did attempt such disenfranchisement during the 1900s.\n\nThe causes of failure to disenfranchise blacks and poor whites in the Border States, as compared to their success for well over half a century in former Confederate states, were complicated. During the 1900s Maryland was vigorously divided between supporters and opponents of disenfranchisement, but it had a large and increasingly educated black community concentrated in Baltimore.

In addition, many states surrounded registration and voting with other complex record-keeping requirements.<ref name=\"Andrews\" /> These were particularly difficult for sharecropper and tenant farmers to comply with, as they moved frequently.\n\nThe poll tax was sometimes used alone or together with a literacy qualification. In a kind of [[grandfather clause]], North Carolina in 1900 exempted from the poll tax those men entitled to vote as of January 1, 1867. This excluded all blacks in the State, who did not have suffrage before that date.<ref name=Pildes />\n\n===Educational and character requirements===\nAlabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee, created an educational requirement, with review by a local registrar of a voter's qualifications. In 1898 Georgia rejected such a device.\n\nAlabama delegates at first hesitated, out of concern that illiterate whites would lose their votes.  After the legislature stated that the new constitution would not disenfranchise any white voters and that it would be submitted to the people for ratification, Alabama passed an educational requirement. It was ratified at the polls in November 1901. Its distinctive feature was the \"good character clause\" (also known as the \"[[grandfather clause]]\"). An appointment board in each county could register \"all voters under the present [previous] law\" who were veterans or the lawful descendants of such, and \"all who are of good character and understand the duties and obligations of citizenship\". This gave the board discretion to approve voters on a case-by-case basis. In practice, they enfranchised many whites, but rejected both poor whites and blacks. Most of the latter had been slaves and unable to attain military service.<ref name=\"Andrews\" />\n\nSouth Carolina, Louisiana (1889), and later, Virginia incorporated an educational requirement in their new constitutions. In 1902 Virginia adopted a constitution with the \"understanding\" clause as a literacy test to use until 1904. In addition, application for registration had to be in the applicant's handwriting and written in the presence of the registrar. Thus, someone who could not write, could not vote.<ref name=\"Andrews\" />\n\n===Eight Box Law===\n<!-- linked from [[Jim Crow laws]] (do not change this header--will break the link) -->\nBy 1882, the Democrats were firmly in power in [[South Carolina]]. Republican voters were mostly limited to the majority-black counties of [[Beaufort County, South Carolina|Beaufort]] and [[Georgetown County, South Carolina|Georgetown]]. Because the state had a large black-majority population (nearly sixty percent [[1890 United States Census|in 1890]]),<ref name=rogersJr/> white Democrats had narrow margins in many counties and feared a possible resurgence of black Republican voters at the polls. To remove the black threat, the [[South Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]] created an indirect literacy test, called the \"Eight Box Law\".\n\nThe law required a separate box for ballots for each office; a voter had to insert the ballot into the corresponding box or it would not count. The ballots could not have party symbols on them. They had to be of a correct size and type of paper. Many ballots were arbitrarily rejected because they slightly deviated from the requirements. Ballots could also randomly be rejected if there were more ballots in a box than registered voters.<ref name=\"Holt\">{{cite book\n  | last =Holt\n  | first =Thomas\n  | authorlink =Thomas C.

On May 8, 1895, Judge Goff of the United States Circuit Court declared the provision unconstitutional and enjoined the state from taking further action under it. But in June 1895, the US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Goff and dissolved the injunction, leaving the way open for a convention.\n\nThe constitutional convention met on September 10 and adjourned on December 4, 1895. By the new constitution, South Carolina adopted the Mississippi Plan until January 1, 1898. Any male citizen could be registered who was able to read a section of the constitution or to satisfy the election officer that he understood it when read to him. Those thus registered were to remain voters for life. Under the new constitution and application of literacy practices, black voters were dropped in great number from the registration rolls: by 1896, in a state where according to the 1890 census blacks numbered 728,934 and comprised nearly sixty percent of the total population,<ref name=rogersJr>{{cite book | first = George C. and C.

It allowed a man to vote if his grandfather or father had voted prior to January 1, 1867; at that time, most African Americans had been slaves, while [[free people of color]], even if property owners, and [[freedmen]] were ineligible to vote until 1870.{{refn|Free men of color could vote in North Carolina prior to 1831 if they met property qualifications, but they were barred from voting in 1835 there and elsewhere after fears raised by the [[Nat Turner]] slave rebellion of 1831.|group=\"nb\"}}\n\n[[Benjamin Robbins Curtis|Justice Benjamin Curtis']] dissent in ''[[Dred Scott v.

United States]]'' (1915), the Supreme Court invalidated the [[Oklahoma]] [[Oklahoma Constitution|Constitution]]'s \"old soldier\" and \"grandfather clause\" exemptions from literacy tests. In practice, these had disenfranchised blacks, as had occurred in numerous Southern states. This decision affected similar provisions in the constitutions of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Virginia election rules. Oklahoma and other states quickly reacted by passing laws that created other rules for voter registration that worked against blacks and minorities.<ref>Richard M. Valelly, ''The Two Reconstructions: The Struggle for Black Enfranchisement'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004, p.141</ref> ''Guinn'' was the first of many cases in which the NAACP filed a brief challenging discriminatory electoral rules.\n\nIn ''[[Lane v. Wilson]]'' (1939), the Supreme Court invalidated an Oklahoma provision designed to disenfranchise blacks. It had replaced the clause struck down in ''Guinn.''  This clause permanently disenfranchised everyone qualified to vote who had not registered to vote in a twelve-day window between April 30 and May 11, 1916, except for those who had voted in 1914. While designed to be more resistant to challenges based on discrimination, as the law did not specifically mention race, the Court struck it down partially because it relied on the 1914 election, when voters had been discriminated against under the rule invalidated in ''Guinn.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/307/268/case.html|title=Lane v.

These became common for all elections. As the Democratic Party was dominant and the only competitive voting was in the primaries, barring minority voters from the primaries was another means of excluding them from politics. Court challenges overturned the white primary system, but many states then passed laws that authorized political  parties to set up the rules for their own systems, such as the white primary. Texas, for instance, passed such a state law in 1923. It was used to bar Mexican Americans as well as black Americans from voting; it survived challenges to the US Supreme Court until the 1940s.<ref>[http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/6_5_3.html ''Texas Politics: Historical Barriers to Voting''], accessed 11 Apr 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402060131/http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/html/vce/0503.html |date=April 2, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Congressional response==\nThe North had heard the South's version of Reconstruction abuses, such as financial corruption, high taxes, and incompetent freedmen. Industry wanted to invest in the South and not worry about political problems. In addition, reconciliation between white veterans of the North and South reached a peak in the early 20th century. As historian [[David Blight]] demonstrated in ''Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory'', reconciliation meant the pushing aside by whites of the major issues of race and suffrage. Southern whites were effective for many years at having their version of history accepted, especially as it was confirmed in ensuing decades by influential historians of the [[Dunning School]] at [[Columbia University]] and other institutions.\n\nDisfranchisement of black Americans in the South was covered by national newspapers and magazines as new laws and constitutions were created, and many Northerners were outraged and alarmed. The [[Lodge Bill]] or Federal Elections Bill or Lodge Force Bill of 1890 was a bill drafted by Representative [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] (R) of Massachusetts, and sponsored in the Senate by [[George Frisbie Hoar]]. It would have authorized federal electors to supervise elections under certain conditions. Due to a Senate filibuster, as well as trade-off of support with Democrats by western [[Silver Republican Party|Silver Republicans]], the bill failed to pass.<ref>Keyssar, Alexander ; ''The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States'', Basic Books, 2000/2009, p. 86 {{ISBN|0465005020}}</ref><ref>Wendy Hazard, 'Thomas Brackett Reed, Civil Rights, and the Fight for Fair Elections,' '' Maine History'', March 2004, Vol. 42 Issue 1, pp 1\u201323</ref>\n\nIn 1900 the Committee of Census of Congress considered proposals for adding more seats to the House of Representatives because of increased population. Proposals ranged for a total number of seats from 357 to 386. [[Edgar D. Crumpacker]] (R-IN) filed an independent report urging that the Southern states be stripped of seats due to the large numbers of voters they had disfranchised. He noted this was provided for in Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provided for stripping representation from states that reduced suffrage due to race.<ref name=\"valelly146-147\"/> The Committee and House failed to agree on this proposal.<ref name=\"committee\"/> Supporters of black suffrage worked to secure Congressional investigation of disfranchisement, but concerted opposition of the Southern Democratic bloc was aroused, and the efforts failed.<ref name=\"Andrews\" />\n\nFrom 1896 to 1900, the House of Representatives with a Republican majority had acted in more than thirty cases to set aside election results from Southern states where the House Elections Committee had concluded that \"black voters had been excluded due to fraud, violence, or intimidation.\" Nevertheless, in the early 20th century, it began to back off from its enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment and suggested that state and federal courts should exercise oversight of this issue. The Southern bloc of Democrats exercised increasing power in the House.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H.

Because they were disfranchised, blacks could not serve on juries, and whites were clearly aligned against them on this and other racial issues.\n\n{{anchor|Tinkham}}\nDespite the Lever decision and domination of Congress by Democrats, some Northern Congressmen continued to raise the issue of black disfranchisement and resulting malapportionment. For instance, on December 6, 1920, Representative [[George H. Tinkham]] (R-MA) offered a resolution for the Committee of Census to investigate alleged disfranchisement of blacks. His intention was to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments.<ref name=\"tinkham\"/>\n\nIn addition, he believed there should be reapportionment in the House related to the voting population of southern states, rather than the general population as enumerated in the census.<ref name=\"tinkham\"/> Such reapportionment was authorized by the Constitution and would reflect reality, so that the South should not get credit for people and voters it had disfranchised.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/273560 in JSTOR]</ref>  The NAACP lobbied for commissioning of African Americans as officers in World War I. It was arranged for W.E.B. Du Bois to receive an Army commission, but he failed his physical.  In 1915 the NAACP organized public education and protests in cities across the nation against D.W. Griffith's film ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'', a film that glamorized the Ku Klux Klan and shown in the Wilson White House as a personal favor to its author, a college roommate of President Wilson.  Boston and a few other cities refused to allow the film to open.\n\n==Legislative and cultural effects==\n===20th-century Supreme Court decisions===\nBlack Americans and their allies worked hard to regain their ability to exercise the constitutional rights of citizens. [[Booker T. Washington]], widely known for his accommodationist approach as the leader of the [[Tuskegee Institute]], called on northern backers to help finance legal challenges to disenfranchisement and segregation. He raised substantial funds and also arranged for representation on some cases, such as the two for Giles in Alabama. He challenged the state's grandfather clause and a citizenship test required for new voters, which was administered in a discriminatory way against blacks.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H.

Harris]]'' (1903), the [[United States Supreme Court]] under Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] effectively upheld such southern voter registration provisions in dealing with a challenge to the Alabama constitution. Its decision said the provisions were not targeted at blacks and thus did not deprive them of rights. This has been characterized as the \"most momentous ignored decision\" in constitutional history.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, 'Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon', ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol. 17, 2000, p.32] Accessed 10 Mar 2008</ref>\n\nTrying to deal with the grounds of the Court's ruling, Giles mounted another challenge. In ''[[Giles v. Teasley]]'' (1904), the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Alabama's disenfranchising constitution. That same year the Congress refused to overturn a disputed election, and essentially sent plaintiffs back to the state courts. Even when black plaintiffs gained rulings in their favor from the Supreme Court, states quickly devised alternative ways to exclude them from the political process. It was not until later in the 20th century that such legal challenges on disenfranchisement began to meet more success in the courts.\n\nWith the founding of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in 1909, the interracial group based in New York began to provide financial and strategic support to lawsuits on voting issues. What became the [[NAACP Legal Defense Fund]] organized and mounted numerous cases in repeated court and legal challenges to the many barriers of segregation, including disenfranchisement provisions of the states. The NAACP often represented plaintiffs directly, or helped raise funds to support legal challenges. The NAACP also worked at public education, lobbying of Congress, demonstrations, and encouragement of theater and academic writing as other means to reach the public. NAACP chapters were organized in cities across the country, and membership increased rapidly in the South. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] also represented plaintiffs in some disenfranchisement cases.\n\n===Successful challenges===\nIn ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'' (1944), the Supreme Court reviewed a Texas case and ruled against the [[white primary]]; the state legislature had authorized the Democratic Party to devise its own rules of operation. The 1944 court ruling was that this was unconstitutional, as the state had failed to protect the constitutional rights of its citizens.\n\nFollowing the 1944 ruling, civil rights organizations in major cities moved quickly to register black voters. For instance, in Georgia, in 1940 only 20,000 blacks had managed to register to vote. After the Supreme Court decision, the All-Citizens Registration Committee (ACRC) of Atlanta started organizing. By 1947 they and others had succeeded in getting 125,000 black Americans registered, 18.8% of those of eligible age.<ref>Chandler Davidson and Bernard Grofman, ''Quiet Revolution in the South: The Impact of the Voting Rights Act'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994, p.70</ref>\n\nEach legal victory was followed by white-dominated legislatures' renewed efforts to control black voting through different exclusionary schemes. In the 1940s, Alabama passed a law to give white registrars more discretion in testing applicants for comprehension and literacy. In 1958 Georgia passed a new voter registration act that required those who were illiterate to satisfy \"understanding tests\" by correctly answering 20 of 30 questions related to citizenship posed by the voting registrar. Blacks had made substantial advances in education, but the individual white registrars were the sole persons to determine whether individual prospective voters answered correctly. In practice, registrars disqualified most black voters, whether they were educated or not. In Terrell County, for instance, which was 64% black in population, after passage of the act, only 48 black Americans were able to register to vote in 1958.<ref>Davidson and Grofman (1994), ''Quiet Revolution in the South'', p. 71</ref>\n\n==Civil Rights Movement==\n{{Main|Civil Rights Movement}}\nThe NAACP's steady progress with individual cases was thwarted by southern Democrats' continuing resistance and passage of new statutory barriers to blacks' exercising the franchise. Through the 1950s and 1960s, private citizens enlarged the effort by becoming activists throughout the South, led by many black churches and their leaders, and joined by both young and older activists from northern states. Nonviolent confrontation and demonstrations were mounted in numerous Southern cities, often provoking violent reaction by white bystanders and authorities. The moral crusade of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] gained national media coverage, attention across the country, and a growing national demand for change.\n\nWidespread violence against the [[Freedom Riders]] in 1961, which was covered by television and newspapers, the murders of activists in Alabama in 1963 gained support for the activists' cause at the national level. President [[John F. Kennedy]] introduced civil rights legislation to Congress in 1963 before he was assassinated.\n\nPresident [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] took up the charge. In January 1964, Johnson met with civil rights leaders. On January 8, during his first [[State of the Union (USA)|State of the Union address]], Johnson asked Congress to \"let this session of Congress be known as the session which did more for civil rights than the last hundred sessions combined.\" On January 23, 1964, the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|24th Amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution, prohibiting the use of [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] in national elections, was ratified with the approval of [[South Dakota]], the 38th state to do so.\n\nOn June 21, 1964, civil rights workers [[Michael Schwerner]], [[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Andrew Goodman]], and [[James Chaney]], disappeared in [[Neshoba County, Mississippi]]. The three were volunteers aiding in the registration of black voters as part of the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party|Mississippi Freedom Summer Project]]. Forty-four days later the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] recovered their bodies from an earthen dam where they were buried. The Neshoba County deputy sheriff Cecil Price and 16 others, all [[Ku Klux Klan]] members, were indicted for the murders; seven were convicted. The investigation also revealed the bodies of several black men, whose deaths had never been revealed or prosecuted by white law enforcement officials.\n\nWhen the Civil Rights Bill came before the full Senate for debate on March 30, 1964, the \"Southern Bloc\" of 18 southern Democratic Senators and one Republican Senator, led by [[Richard Russell, Jr.|Richard Russell]] (D-GA), launched a [[filibuster]] to prevent its passage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.congresslink.org/print_basics_histmats_civilrights64text.htm |title=Major Features of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 |publisher=Congresslink.org |accessdate=2010-06-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206191323/http://www.congresslink.org/print_basics_histmats_civilrights64text.htm |archivedate=2014-12-06 }}</ref> Russell said:\n\n{{quote|We will resist to the bitter end any measure or any movement which would have a tendency to bring about [[social equality]] and [[miscegenation|intermingling and amalgamation of the races]] in our (Southern) states.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://spartacus-educational.com/USAcivil64.htm |title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 |publisher=Spartacus-Educational.com |accessdate=2019-02-27 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516142923/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAcivil64.htm |archivedate=2010-05-16 }}</ref>}}\n\nAfter 57 working days of filibuster, and several compromises, the Senate had enough votes (71 to 29) to end the debate and the filibuster. It was the first time that Southern senators had failed to win with such tactics against civil rights bills. On July 2, President Johnson signed into law the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Civil Rights during the administration of Lyndon B.

It did not explicitly ban [[literacy tests]], which had been used to disqualify blacks and poor white voters.\n\nAs the [[United States Department of Justice]] has stated:\n\n<blockquote>By 1965 concerted efforts to break the grip of state disenfranchisement (sic) had been under way for some time, but had achieved only modest success overall and in some areas had proved almost entirely ineffectual. The murder of voting-rights activists in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]], gained national attention, along with numerous other acts of violence and terrorism. Finally, the unprovoked attack on March 7, 1965, by state troopers on peaceful marchers crossing the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] in [[Selma, Alabama]], en route to the state capitol in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], persuaded the President and Congress to overcome Southern legislators' resistance to effective voting rights legislation.

It provided for recourse for local voters to federal oversight and intervention, plus federal monitoring of areas that historically had low voter turnouts to ensure that new measures were not taken against minority voters. It provided for federal enforcement of voting rights. African Americans began to enter the formal political process, most in the South for the first time in their lives.

Their actions were designed to thwart the objective of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]], [[ratified]] in 1870, which sought to protect the [[Voting rights in the United States|suffrage]] of [[freedmen]] after the [[American Civil War]].\n\nDuring the later elections of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] era, beginning in the 1870s, [[White people|white]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] used violence by [[paramilitary]] groups, as well as fraud, to suppress black [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] voters and turn Republicans out of office.  After regaining control of the state legislatures, Democrats were alarmed by a late 19th-century alliance between Republicans and Populists that cost them some elections. After achieving control of state legislatures, white Democrats added to previous efforts and achieved widespread disenfranchisement by law: from 1890 to 1908, Southern state legislatures passed new constitutions, constitutional amendments, and laws that made voter registration and voting more difficult, especially when administered by white staff in a discriminatory way. They succeeded in disenfranchising most of the black citizens, as well as many [[Poor White|poor whites]] in the South, and voter rolls dropped dramatically in each state. The Republican Party was nearly eliminated in the region for decades, and the Democrats established one-party control throughout the southern states.<ref>Valelly, Richard M.; ''The Two Reconstructions: The Struggle for Black Enfranchisement'' University of Chicago Press, 2009, pp. 134-139 {{ISBN|9780226845302}}</ref>\n\nIn 1912, the Republican Party was split when Roosevelt ran against the party regular, Taft. In the South by this time, the Republican Party had been hollowed out by the disenfranchisement of African Americans, who were largely excluded from voting. Democrat [[Woodrow Wilson]] was elected as the first southern [[President of the United States|President]] since 1856. He was re-elected in 1916, in a much closer presidential contest. During his first term, Wilson satisfied the request of Southerners in his cabinet and instituted overt [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] throughout federal government workplaces, as well as [[racial discrimination]] in hiring.<ref name=\"Teachingamericanhistory.org\">{{cite web |url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?documentprint=1115 |title=Another Open Letter to Woodrow Wilson W.E.B.

In addition, because black Southerners were not listed on local voter rolls, they were automatically excluded from [[jury duty|serving in local courts]]. Juries were [[all-white jury|all white]] across the South.\n\nPolitical disenfranchisement did not end until after passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which authorized the federal government to monitor voter registration practices and elections where populations were historically underrepresented, and to enforce constitutional voting rights. The challenge to voting rights has continued into the 21st century, as shown by numerous court cases in 2016 alone, though attempts to restrict voting rights for political advantage have not been confined to the Southern states. Another method of seeking political advantage through the voting system is the [[Gerrymandering in the United States|gerrymandering of electoral boundaries]], as was the case of North Carolina, which in January 2018 was declared by a federal court to be unconstitutional.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/us/north-carolina-gerrymander.html North Carolina Is Ordered to Redraw Its Congressional Map]</ref> Such cases are expected to reach the Supreme Court.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/us/gerrymander-court-north-carolina-pennsylvania.html Is Partisan Gerrymandering Legal?

Congress passed the [[Reconstruction Acts]], starting in 1867, establishing military districts to oversee the affairs of these states pending reconstruction.\n\nDuring the Reconstruction era, blacks constituted absolute majorities of the populations in [[Mississippi]] and [[South Carolina]], were equal to the white population in Louisiana, and represented more than 40 percent of the population in four other former Confederate states. Southern whites, fearing black domination, resisted the [[freedmen]]'s exercise of political power.<ref>Gabriel J. Chin & Randy Wagner, \"The Tyranny of the Minority: Jim Crow and the Counter-Majoritarian Difficulty,\" [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=963036&high=%20Gabriel%20CHin 43 ''Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review'' 65 (2008)]</ref> In 1867, black men voted for the first time. By the [[1868 United States presidential election|1868 presidential election]], Texas, Mississippi, and Virginia had still not been re-admitted to the Union. General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was elected as president thanks in part to 700,000 black voters. In February 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified; it was designed to protect blacks' right to vote from infringement by the states.\n\nWhite supremacist [[paramilitary]] organizations, allied with Southern Democrats, used intimidation, violence and even committed assassinations in order to repress blacks and prevent them from exercising their [[civil and political rights]] in elections from 1868 until the mid-1870s. The insurgent [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) was formed in 1865 in [[Tennessee]] (as a backlash to defeat in the war) and it quickly became a powerful secret [[vigilante]] group, with chapters across the South. The Klan initiated a campaign of intimidation directed against blacks and sympathetic whites. Their violence included [[vandalism]] and destruction of property, physical attacks and assassinations, and [[lynching]]s. Teachers who came from the North to teach freedmen were sometimes attacked or intimidated as well.\n\nThe toll of Klan murders and attacks led [[United States Congress|Congress]] to pass laws to end the violence. In 1870, the strongly [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congress passed the [[Enforcement Acts]], imposing penalties for conspiracy to deny black suffrage.<ref name=\"Andrews\">{{cite book\n  | last =Andrews\n  | first =E. Benjamin\n  | authorlink =Elisha Benjamin Andrews\n  | title =History of the United States\n  | publisher =Charles Scribner's Sons\n  | year =1912\n  | location =New York }}</ref> The Acts empowered the President to deploy the armed forces to suppress organizations that deprived people of rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Organizations whose members appeared in arms were considered in rebellion against the United States. The President could suspend ''[[habeas corpus]]'' under those circumstances. President Grant used these provisions in parts of the [[Carolinas]] in late 1871. United States marshals supervised state voter registrations and elections and could summon the help of military or naval forces if needed.<ref name=\"Andrews\" /> These measures led to the demise of the first Klan by the early 1870s.\n\nNew paramilitary groups quickly sprang up, as tens of thousands of veterans belonged to gun clubs and similar groups. A second wave of violence began, resulting in over 1,000 deaths, usually black or Republican. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in 1876 in ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'', arising from trials related to the [[Colfax Massacre]], that protections of the Fourteenth Amendment, which the Enforcement Acts were intended to support, did not apply to the actions of individuals, but only to the actions of state governments. They recommended that persons seek relief from state courts, which had not been supportive of freedmen's rights.\n\nThe [[paramilitary]] organizations that arose in the mid to late 1870s were part of continuing [[insurgency]] in the South after the Civil War, as armed veterans in the South resisted social changes, and worked to prevent black Americans and other Republicans from voting and running for office. Such groups included the [[White League]], formed in Louisiana in 1874 from white [[militias]], with chapters forming in other Southern states; the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], formed in 1875 in Mississippi but also active in [[North Carolina]] and South Carolina; and other \"White Liners,\" such as [[rifle clubs]] and the [[Knights of the White Camellia]]. Compared to the Klan, they were open societies, better organized and devoted to the political goal of regaining control of the state legislatures and suppressing Republicans, including most blacks. They often solicited newspaper coverage for publicity to increase their threat. The scale of operations was such that in 1876, North Carolina had 20,000 men in rifle clubs. Made up of well-armed Confederate veterans, a class that covered most adult men who could have fought in the war, the paramilitary groups worked for political aims: to turn Republicans out of office, disrupt their organizing, and use force to intimidate and terrorize [[freedmen]] to keep them away from the polls. Such groups have been described as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party\".<ref>George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132</ref>\n\nThey were instrumental in many Southern states in driving blacks away from the polls and ensuring a white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] takeover of legislatures and governorships in most Southern states in the 1870s, most notoriously during the [[1876 United States presidential election|controversial 1876 elections]]. As a result of a national [[Compromise of 1877]] arising from the 1876 presidential election, the federal government withdrew its military forces from the South, formally ending the Reconstruction era. By that time, Southern Democrats had effectively regained control in [[Louisiana]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Florida]] \u2013 they identified as the [[Redeemers]]. In the South, the process of white Democrats regaining control of state governments has been called \"the Redemption\". African-American historians sometimes call the Compromise of 1877 \"The Great Betrayal\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Key Events in the Presidency of Rutherford B.

Other measures followed, particularly near the end of the century, after a Republican-Populist alliance caused the Democrats to temporarily lose some Congressional seats and control of some gubernatorial positions.\n\nTo secure their power, the Democrats worked to exclude blacks (and most Republicans) from politics. The results could be seen across the South. After Reconstruction, Tennessee initially had the most \"consistently competitive political system in the South\".<ref name=\"shaping\">J. Morgan Kousser, ''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South, 1880\u20131910'', p.104</ref> A bitter election battle in 1888, marked by unmatched corruption and violence, resulted in white Democrats taking over the state legislature. To consolidate their power, they worked to suppress the black vote and sharply reduced it through changes in voter registration, requiring [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], as well as changing election procedures to make voting more complex.\n\nIn 1890 Mississippi adopted a new constitution, which contained provisions for voter registration which required voters pay [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] and pass a [[literacy test]]. The literacy test was subjectively applied by white administrators, and the two provisions effectively disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites. The constitutional provisions survived a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] challenge in ''[[Williams v. Mississippi]]'' (1898). Other southern states quickly adopted new constitutions and what they called the \"Mississippi plan\". By 1908, all states of the former Confederacy had passed new constitutions or suffrage amendments, sometimes bypassing general elections to achieve this. Legislators created a variety of barriers, including longer residency requirements, rule variations, literacy and understanding tests, which were subjectively applied against minorities, or were particularly hard for the poor to fulfill.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H.

You had set us an impossible task.<br/><br/>We did not disfranchise the negroes until 1895. Then we had a constitutional convention convened which took the matter up calmly, deliberately, and avowedly with the purpose of disfranchising as many of them as we could under the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments. We adopted the educational qualification as the only means left to us, and the negro is as contented and as prosperous and as well protected in South Carolina to-day as in any State of the Union south of the Potomac. He is not meddling with politics, for he found that the more he meddled with them the worse off he got. As to his \u201crights\u201d\u2014I will not discuss them now.

Apportionment of seats was still based on total population (with the assumption of the usual number of voting males in relation to the residents); as a result white Southerners commanded a number of seats far out of proportion to the voters they represented.<ref name=\"committee\">[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1900/12/21/102438623.pdf \u2018COMMITTEE AT ODDS ON REAPPORTIONMENT\u2019], ''The New York Times'', 20 Dec 1900, accessed 10 Mar 2008</ref> In the end, Congress did not act on this issue, as the Southern bloc of Democrats had sufficient power to reject or stall such action. For decades, white Southern Democrats exercised Congressional representation derived from a full count of the population, but they disfranchised several million black and white citizens. Southern white Democrats comprised the \"[[Solid South]]\", a powerful voting bloc in Congress until the mid-20th century. Their representatives, re-elected repeatedly by one-party states, exercised the power of seniority, controlling numerous chairmanships of important committees in both houses. Their power allowed them to have control over rules, budgets and important patronage projects, among other issues, as well as to defeat bills to make [[lynching]] a federal crime.<ref name=\"p10\"/>\n\n==New state constitutions, 1890 to 1908==\n{{See also|Voting rights in the United States}}\nDespite white Southerners' complaints about Reconstruction, several Southern states kept most provisions of their Reconstruction constitutions for more than two decades, until late in the 19th century.<ref>W.E.B. DuBois, ''Black Reconstruction in America, 1868\u20131880'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1935; reprint, New York: The Free Press, 1998</ref> In some states, the number of blacks elected to local offices reached a peak in the 1880s although Reconstruction had ended. They had an influence at the local level, where much of government took place, although they did not win many statewide or national seats. Subsequently, state legislatures passed restrictive laws or constitutions that made voter registration and election rules more complicated. As literacy tests and other restrictions could be applied subjectively, these changes sharply limited the vote by most blacks and, often, many poor whites; voter rolls dropped across the South into the new century.\n\n[[Florida]] approved a new constitution in 1885 that included provisions for [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] as a prerequisite for voter registration and voting. From 1890 to 1908, ten of the eleven Southern states rewrote their constitutions. All included provisions that effectively restricted voter registration and suffrage, including requirements for poll taxes, increased residency, and subjective [[literacy tests]].<ref name=\"Michael Perman 2001\">Michael Perman.''Struggle for Mastery: Disfranchisement in the South, 1888\u20131908''. Chapel Hill: North Carolina Press, 2001, Introduction</ref>\n\nWith educational improvements, blacks had markedly increased their rate of literacy. By 1891, their illiteracy had declined to 58 percent, whilst the rate of white illiteracy in the South at that time was 31 percent.<ref>[http://www.sefatl.org/1878.asp 1878\u20131895: Disenfranchisement (sic), Southern Education Foundation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607074413/http://www.sefatl.org/1878.asp |date=2008-06-07 }}, accessed 16 Mar 2008</ref> Some states used [[grandfather clause]]s to exempt white voters from literacy tests altogether. Other states required otherwise eligible black voters to meet literacy and knowledge requirements to the satisfaction of white registrars, who applied subjective judgment and, in the process, rejected most black voters. By 1900, the majority of blacks were literate, but even many of the best-educated of these men continued to \"fail\" the literacy tests administered by white registrars.\n\nThe historian [[J. Morgan Kousser]] noted, \"Within the Democratic party, the chief impetus for restriction came from the black belt members,\" whom he identified as \"always socioeconomically privileged.\" In addition to wanting to affirm white supremacy, the [[planter (American South)|planter]] and business elite were concerned about voting by lower-class and uneducated whites. Kousser found, \"They disfranchised these whites as willingly as they deprived blacks of the vote.\"<ref>J. Morgan Kousser.''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974</ref> Perman noted the goals of disenfranchisement resulted from several factors. Competition between white elites and white lower classes, for example, and a desire to prevent alliances between lower-class white and black Americans, as had been seen in Populist-Republican alliances, led white Democratic legislators to restrict voter rolls.<ref name=\"Michael Perman 2001\" />\n\nWith the passage of new constitutions, Southern states adopted provisions that caused disenfranchisement of large portions of their populations by skirting US constitutional protections of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. While their voter registration requirements applied to all citizens, in practice they disenfranchised most blacks. As in Alabama, they also \"would remove [from voter registration rolls] the less educated, less organized, more impoverished whites as well \u2013 and that would ensure one-party Democratic rules through most of the 20th century in the South\".<ref name=\"p10\" /><ref name=\"Glenn Feldman 2004, pp. 135\u2013136\">Glenn Feldman, ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, pp.&nbsp;135\u2013136</ref>\n\nThe new provisions of the state constitutions almost entirely eliminated black voting. Although nothing approaching precise data exists, it is estimated that in the late 1930s less than one percent of blacks in the Deep South and around five percent in the Rim South were registered to vote,<ref>Mickey, Robert; ''Paths Out of Dixie: The Democratization of Authoritarian Enclaves in America's Deep South, 1944-1972'', p. 87 {{ISBN|1400838789}}</ref> and that the proportion actually voting even in general elections, which were of no consequence due to complete Democratic dominance, was much smaller still. Secondly, the Democratic legislatures passed [[Jim Crow laws]] to assert white supremacy, establish [[racial segregation]] in public facilities, and treat blacks as second-class citizens. The landmark court decision in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896) held that \"separate but equal\" facilities, as on railroad cars, were constitutional. The new constitutions passed numerous Supreme Court challenges. In cases where a particular restriction was overruled by the Supreme Court in the early 20th century, states quickly devised new methods of excluding most blacks from voting, such as the [[white primary]]. Democratic Party primaries became the only competitive contests in southern states.\n\nFor the national Democratic Party, the alignment after Reconstruction resulted in a powerful Southern region that was useful for congressional clout. Nevertheless, prior to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the \"Solid South\" inhibited the national party from fulfilling center-left initiatives{{clarify|date=February 2017}} desired since the days of [[William Jennings Bryan]]. [[Woodrow Wilson#Segregation in the federal government|Woodrow Wilson]], one of two Democrats elected to the presidency between Abraham Lincoln and [[Franklin D.

The literacy test was administered by the voting registrar; in practice, they were white Democrats. Provisions in the constitution also included a [[grandfather clause]], which provided a loophole to enable illiterate whites to register to vote. It said that \"Any citizen who was a voter on January 1, 1867, or his son or grandson, or any person naturalized prior to January 1, 1898, if applying for registration before September 1, 1898, might vote, notwithstanding illiteracy or poverty.\" Separate registration lists were kept for whites and blacks, making it easy for white registrars to discriminate against blacks in literacy tests. The constitution of 1898 also required a person to satisfy a longer [[residency requirement]] in the state, county, parish, and precinct before voting than did the constitution of 1879. This worked against the lower classes, who were more likely to move frequently for work, especially in agricultural areas where there were many migrant workers and sharecroppers.\n\nThe effect of these changes on the population of black voters in Louisiana was devastating; by 1900 black voters were reduced from 130,334 to 5,320 on the rolls. By 1910, only 730 blacks were registered, less than 0.5% of eligible black men. \"In 27 of the state's sixty parishes, not a single black voter was registered any longer; in nine more parishes, only one black voter was.\"<ref name=\"p12\"/>\n\n===North Carolina===\nIn 1894, a coalition of Republicans and the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]] won control of the North Carolina state legislature (and with it, the ability to elect two US Senators) and were successful in electing several US Representatives elected through [[electoral fusion]].<ref name=\"fusion\">{{cite web|url=http://www.northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/58/entry|title=Fusion Politics - North Carolina History Project|first=Website design and web development by Mango Web Design|last=http://mangowebdesign.com|website=northcarolinahistory.org|accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref> The fusion coalition made impressive gains in the 1896 election when their legislative majority expanded. Republican [[Daniel Lindsay Russell]] won the gubernatorial race in 1897, the first Republican governor of the state since the end of Reconstruction in 1877. The election also resulted in more than 1,000 elected or appointed black officials, including the election in 1897 of [[George Henry White]] to Congress, as a member of the House of Representatives.\n\nAt the 1898 election, the Democrats ran on [[White Supremacy]] and disenfranchisement in a bitter race-baiting campaign led by [[Furnifold McLendel Simmons]] and [[Josephus Daniels]], editor and publisher of ''[[The News & Observer|The Raleigh News & Observer]].'' The Republican/Populist coalition disintegrated, and the Democrats won the North Carolina 1898 election and the following 1900 election. Simmons was elected as the state's US senator in 1900, holding office until 1931 through multiple re-elections by the state legislature and by popular vote after 1920.\n\nThe Democrats used their power in the state legislature to disenfranchise minorities, primarily blacks, and ensure that Democratic Party and white power would not be threatened again.<ref name=\"shaping\" /><ref name=\"fusion\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.unc.edu/ncc/1898/1898.html|title=The North Carolina Election of 1898 \u00b7 UNC Libraries|website=www.lib.unc.edu|accessdate=2 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427010250/http://www.lib.unc.edu/ncc/1898/1898.html|archive-date=27 April 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> They passed laws restricting voter registration. In 1900 the Democrats adopted a constitutional suffrage amendment which lengthened the residence period required before registration, and enacted both an educational qualification (to be assessed by a registrar, which meant that it could be subjectively applied) and prepayment of a [[poll tax]]. A [[grandfather clause]] exempted from the poll tax those entitled to vote on January 1, 1867.<ref name=\"Pildes\"/> The legislature also passed [[Jim Crow]] laws establishing racial [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in public facilities and transportation.\n\nThe effect in North Carolina was the complete elimination of black voters from voter rolls by 1904.

The Readjuster Party held control from 1881 to 1883, electing a governor and controlling the legislature, which also elected a US Senator from the state. As in North Carolina, state Democrats were able to divide Readjuster supporters through appeals to White Supremacy. After regaining power, Democrats changed state laws and the constitution in 1902 to disenfranchise blacks. They ratified the new constitution in the legislature and did not submit it to popular vote. Voting in Virginia fell by nearly half as a result of the disenfranchisement of blacks.<ref name=\"historical\"/><ref name = \"Dabney\"/> The eighty-year stretch of white Democratic control ended only in the late 1960s after passage and enforcement of the federal [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965 and the collapse of the [[Byrd Organization]] machine.\n\n===Border States: failed disenfranchisement===\nThe five [[border states (American Civil War)|border states]] of Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky and Missouri, had legacies similar to the Confederate slave states from the Civil War. The Border States, all slave states, also established laws requiring racial segregation between the 1880s and 1900s; however, disenfranchisement of blacks was never attained to any significant degree. Most Border States did attempt such disenfranchisement during the 1900s.\n\nThe causes of failure to disenfranchise blacks and poor whites in the Border States, as compared to their success for well over half a century in former Confederate states, were complicated. During the 1900s Maryland was vigorously divided between supporters and opponents of disenfranchisement, but it had a large and increasingly educated black community concentrated in Baltimore. This city had many free blacks before the Civil War and they had established both economic and political power.<ref name=\"Here\">Smith, C.

Many states required payment of the tax at a time separate from the election, and then required voters to bring receipts with them to the polls. If they could not locate such receipts, they could not vote. In addition, many states surrounded registration and voting with other complex record-keeping requirements.<ref name=\"Andrews\" /> These were particularly difficult for sharecropper and tenant farmers to comply with, as they moved frequently.\n\nThe poll tax was sometimes used alone or together with a literacy qualification. In a kind of [[grandfather clause]], North Carolina in 1900 exempted from the poll tax those men entitled to vote as of January 1, 1867. This excluded all blacks in the State, who did not have suffrage before that date.<ref name=Pildes />\n\n===Educational and character requirements===\nAlabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee, created an educational requirement, with review by a local registrar of a voter's qualifications. In 1898 Georgia rejected such a device.\n\nAlabama delegates at first hesitated, out of concern that illiterate whites would lose their votes.  After the legislature stated that the new constitution would not disenfranchise any white voters and that it would be submitted to the people for ratification, Alabama passed an educational requirement. It was ratified at the polls in November 1901. Its distinctive feature was the \"good character clause\" (also known as the \"[[grandfather clause]]\"). An appointment board in each county could register \"all voters under the present [previous] law\" who were veterans or the lawful descendants of such, and \"all who are of good character and understand the duties and obligations of citizenship\". This gave the board discretion to approve voters on a case-by-case basis. In practice, they enfranchised many whites, but rejected both poor whites and blacks. Most of the latter had been slaves and unable to attain military service.<ref name=\"Andrews\" />\n\nSouth Carolina, Louisiana (1889), and later, Virginia incorporated an educational requirement in their new constitutions. In 1902 Virginia adopted a constitution with the \"understanding\" clause as a literacy test to use until 1904. In addition, application for registration had to be in the applicant's handwriting and written in the presence of the registrar. Thus, someone who could not write, could not vote.<ref name=\"Andrews\" />\n\n===Eight Box Law===\n<!-- linked from [[Jim Crow laws]] (do not change this header--will break the link) -->\nBy 1882, the Democrats were firmly in power in [[South Carolina]]. Republican voters were mostly limited to the majority-black counties of [[Beaufort County, South Carolina|Beaufort]] and [[Georgetown County, South Carolina|Georgetown]]. Because the state had a large black-majority population (nearly sixty percent [[1890 United States Census|in 1890]]),<ref name=rogersJr/> white Democrats had narrow margins in many counties and feared a possible resurgence of black Republican voters at the polls. To remove the black threat, the [[South Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]] created an indirect literacy test, called the \"Eight Box Law\".\n\nThe law required a separate box for ballots for each office; a voter had to insert the ballot into the corresponding box or it would not count. The ballots could not have party symbols on them. They had to be of a correct size and type of paper. Many ballots were arbitrarily rejected because they slightly deviated from the requirements. Ballots could also randomly be rejected if there were more ballots in a box than registered voters.<ref name=\"Holt\">{{cite book\n  | last =Holt\n  | first =Thomas\n  | authorlink =Thomas C.

On May 8, 1895, Judge Goff of the United States Circuit Court declared the provision unconstitutional and enjoined the state from taking further action under it. But in June 1895, the US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Goff and dissolved the injunction, leaving the way open for a convention.\n\nThe constitutional convention met on September 10 and adjourned on December 4, 1895. By the new constitution, South Carolina adopted the Mississippi Plan until January 1, 1898. Any male citizen could be registered who was able to read a section of the constitution or to satisfy the election officer that he understood it when read to him. Those thus registered were to remain voters for life. Under the new constitution and application of literacy practices, black voters were dropped in great number from the registration rolls: by 1896, in a state where according to the 1890 census blacks numbered 728,934 and comprised nearly sixty percent of the total population,<ref name=rogersJr>{{cite book | first = George C. and C.

It allowed a man to vote if his grandfather or father had voted prior to January 1, 1867; at that time, most African Americans had been slaves, while [[free people of color]], even if property owners, and [[freedmen]] were ineligible to vote until 1870.{{refn|Free men of color could vote in North Carolina prior to 1831 if they met property qualifications, but they were barred from voting in 1835 there and elsewhere after fears raised by the [[Nat Turner]] slave rebellion of 1831.|group=\"nb\"}}\n\n[[Benjamin Robbins Curtis|Justice Benjamin Curtis']] dissent in ''[[Dred Scott v.

United States]]'' (1915), the Supreme Court invalidated the [[Oklahoma]] [[Oklahoma Constitution|Constitution]]'s \"old soldier\" and \"grandfather clause\" exemptions from literacy tests. In practice, these had disenfranchised blacks, as had occurred in numerous Southern states. This decision affected similar provisions in the constitutions of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Virginia election rules. Oklahoma and other states quickly reacted by passing laws that created other rules for voter registration that worked against blacks and minorities.<ref>Richard M. Valelly, ''The Two Reconstructions: The Struggle for Black Enfranchisement'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004, p.141</ref> ''Guinn'' was the first of many cases in which the NAACP filed a brief challenging discriminatory electoral rules.\n\nIn ''[[Lane v. Wilson]]'' (1939), the Supreme Court invalidated an Oklahoma provision designed to disenfranchise blacks. It had replaced the clause struck down in ''Guinn.''  This clause permanently disenfranchised everyone qualified to vote who had not registered to vote in a twelve-day window between April 30 and May 11, 1916, except for those who had voted in 1914. While designed to be more resistant to challenges based on discrimination, as the law did not specifically mention race, the Court struck it down partially because it relied on the 1914 election, when voters had been discriminated against under the rule invalidated in ''Guinn.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/307/268/case.html|title=Lane v.

These became common for all elections. As the Democratic Party was dominant and the only competitive voting was in the primaries, barring minority voters from the primaries was another means of excluding them from politics. Court challenges overturned the white primary system, but many states then passed laws that authorized political  parties to set up the rules for their own systems, such as the white primary. Texas, for instance, passed such a state law in 1923. It was used to bar Mexican Americans as well as black Americans from voting; it survived challenges to the US Supreme Court until the 1940s.<ref>[http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/6_5_3.html ''Texas Politics: Historical Barriers to Voting''], accessed 11 Apr 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402060131/http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/html/vce/0503.html |date=April 2, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Congressional response==\nThe North had heard the South's version of Reconstruction abuses, such as financial corruption, high taxes, and incompetent freedmen. Industry wanted to invest in the South and not worry about political problems. In addition, reconciliation between white veterans of the North and South reached a peak in the early 20th century. As historian [[David Blight]] demonstrated in ''Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory'', reconciliation meant the pushing aside by whites of the major issues of race and suffrage. Southern whites were effective for many years at having their version of history accepted, especially as it was confirmed in ensuing decades by influential historians of the [[Dunning School]] at [[Columbia University]] and other institutions.\n\nDisfranchisement of black Americans in the South was covered by national newspapers and magazines as new laws and constitutions were created, and many Northerners were outraged and alarmed. The [[Lodge Bill]] or Federal Elections Bill or Lodge Force Bill of 1890 was a bill drafted by Representative [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] (R) of Massachusetts, and sponsored in the Senate by [[George Frisbie Hoar]]. It would have authorized federal electors to supervise elections under certain conditions. Due to a Senate filibuster, as well as trade-off of support with Democrats by western [[Silver Republican Party|Silver Republicans]], the bill failed to pass.<ref>Keyssar, Alexander ; ''The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States'', Basic Books, 2000/2009, p. 86 {{ISBN|0465005020}}</ref><ref>Wendy Hazard, 'Thomas Brackett Reed, Civil Rights, and the Fight for Fair Elections,' '' Maine History'', March 2004, Vol. 42 Issue 1, pp 1\u201323</ref>\n\nIn 1900 the Committee of Census of Congress considered proposals for adding more seats to the House of Representatives because of increased population. Proposals ranged for a total number of seats from 357 to 386. [[Edgar D. Crumpacker]] (R-IN) filed an independent report urging that the Southern states be stripped of seats due to the large numbers of voters they had disfranchised. He noted this was provided for in Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provided for stripping representation from states that reduced suffrage due to race.<ref name=\"valelly146-147\"/> The Committee and House failed to agree on this proposal.<ref name=\"committee\"/> Supporters of black suffrage worked to secure Congressional investigation of disfranchisement, but concerted opposition of the Southern Democratic bloc was aroused, and the efforts failed.<ref name=\"Andrews\" />\n\nFrom 1896 to 1900, the House of Representatives with a Republican majority had acted in more than thirty cases to set aside election results from Southern states where the House Elections Committee had concluded that \"black voters had been excluded due to fraud, violence, or intimidation.\" Nevertheless, in the early 20th century, it began to back off from its enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment and suggested that state and federal courts should exercise oversight of this issue.

For instance, on December 6, 1920, Representative [[George H. Tinkham]] (R-MA) offered a resolution for the Committee of Census to investigate alleged disfranchisement of blacks.

He suggested reduction of their congressional delegations in proportion to the populations they had disenfranchised. He was defeated again by the [[Solid South]]. Its representatives had rallied in outrage that the [[First Lady]] had invited [[Jessie De Priest tea at the White House|Jessie De Priest for tea to the White House]] with other congressional wives. She was the wife of [[Oscar Stanton De Priest]] from Chicago, the first African-American elected to Congress in the 20th century.<ref name=\"racialtea\">{{cite journal|last=Day|first=Davis S.|date=Winter 1980|title=Herbert Hoover and Racial Politics: The De Priest Incident|journal=Journal of Negro History|volume=65|issue=1|pages=6\u201317|jstor=3031544|doi=10.2307/3031544}}</ref>\n\nSegregation of the federal service began under President Woodrow Wilson, ignoring complaints by the NAACP, which had supported his election in 1912.<ref>August Meier, August, and Elliott Rudwick.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/273560 in JSTOR]</ref>  The NAACP lobbied for commissioning of African Americans as officers in World War I. It was arranged for W.E.B. Du Bois to receive an Army commission, but he failed his physical.  In 1915 the NAACP organized public education and protests in cities across the nation against D.W. Griffith's film ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'', a film that glamorized the Ku Klux Klan and shown in the Wilson White House as a personal favor to its author, a college roommate of President Wilson.  Boston and a few other cities refused to allow the film to open.\n\n==Legislative and cultural effects==\n===20th-century Supreme Court decisions===\nBlack Americans and their allies worked hard to regain their ability to exercise the constitutional rights of citizens. [[Booker T. Washington]], widely known for his accommodationist approach as the leader of the [[Tuskegee Institute]], called on northern backers to help finance legal challenges to disenfranchisement and segregation. He raised substantial funds and also arranged for representation on some cases, such as the two for Giles in Alabama. He challenged the state's grandfather clause and a citizenship test required for new voters, which was administered in a discriminatory way against blacks.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, \u2018Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon\u2019, ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol. 17, 2000, p. 21] Accessed 10 Mar 2008</ref>\n\nIn its ruling in ''[[Giles v. Harris]]'' (1903), the [[United States Supreme Court]] under Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] effectively upheld such southern voter registration provisions in dealing with a challenge to the Alabama constitution. Its decision said the provisions were not targeted at blacks and thus did not deprive them of rights. This has been characterized as the \"most momentous ignored decision\" in constitutional history.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, 'Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon', ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol. 17, 2000, p.32] Accessed 10 Mar 2008</ref>\n\nTrying to deal with the grounds of the Court's ruling, Giles mounted another challenge. In ''[[Giles v. Teasley]]'' (1904), the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Alabama's disenfranchising constitution. That same year the Congress refused to overturn a disputed election, and essentially sent plaintiffs back to the state courts. Even when black plaintiffs gained rulings in their favor from the Supreme Court, states quickly devised alternative ways to exclude them from the political process. It was not until later in the 20th century that such legal challenges on disenfranchisement began to meet more success in the courts.\n\nWith the founding of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in 1909, the interracial group based in New York began to provide financial and strategic support to lawsuits on voting issues. What became the [[NAACP Legal Defense Fund]] organized and mounted numerous cases in repeated court and legal challenges to the many barriers of segregation, including disenfranchisement provisions of the states. The NAACP often represented plaintiffs directly, or helped raise funds to support legal challenges. The NAACP also worked at public education, lobbying of Congress, demonstrations, and encouragement of theater and academic writing as other means to reach the public. NAACP chapters were organized in cities across the country, and membership increased rapidly in the South. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] also represented plaintiffs in some disenfranchisement cases.\n\n===Successful challenges===\nIn ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'' (1944), the Supreme Court reviewed a Texas case and ruled against the [[white primary]]; the state legislature had authorized the Democratic Party to devise its own rules of operation. The 1944 court ruling was that this was unconstitutional, as the state had failed to protect the constitutional rights of its citizens.\n\nFollowing the 1944 ruling, civil rights organizations in major cities moved quickly to register black voters. For instance, in Georgia, in 1940 only 20,000 blacks had managed to register to vote. After the Supreme Court decision, the All-Citizens Registration Committee (ACRC) of Atlanta started organizing. By 1947 they and others had succeeded in getting 125,000 black Americans registered, 18.8% of those of eligible age.<ref>Chandler Davidson and Bernard Grofman, ''Quiet Revolution in the South: The Impact of the Voting Rights Act'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994, p.70</ref>\n\nEach legal victory was followed by white-dominated legislatures' renewed efforts to control black voting through different exclusionary schemes. In the 1940s, Alabama passed a law to give white registrars more discretion in testing applicants for comprehension and literacy. In 1958 Georgia passed a new voter registration act that required those who were illiterate to satisfy \"understanding tests\" by correctly answering 20 of 30 questions related to citizenship posed by the voting registrar. Blacks had made substantial advances in education, but the individual white registrars were the sole persons to determine whether individual prospective voters answered correctly. In practice, registrars disqualified most black voters, whether they were educated or not. In Terrell County, for instance, which was 64% black in population, after passage of the act, only 48 black Americans were able to register to vote in 1958.<ref>Davidson and Grofman (1994), ''Quiet Revolution in the South'', p. 71</ref>\n\n==Civil Rights Movement==\n{{Main|Civil Rights Movement}}\nThe NAACP's steady progress with individual cases was thwarted by southern Democrats' continuing resistance and passage of new statutory barriers to blacks' exercising the franchise. Through the 1950s and 1960s, private citizens enlarged the effort by becoming activists throughout the South, led by many black churches and their leaders, and joined by both young and older activists from northern states. Nonviolent confrontation and demonstrations were mounted in numerous Southern cities, often provoking violent reaction by white bystanders and authorities. The moral crusade of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] gained national media coverage, attention across the country, and a growing national demand for change.\n\nWidespread violence against the [[Freedom Riders]] in 1961, which was covered by television and newspapers, the murders of activists in Alabama in 1963 gained support for the activists' cause at the national level. President [[John F. Kennedy]] introduced civil rights legislation to Congress in 1963 before he was assassinated.\n\nPresident [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] took up the charge. In January 1964, Johnson met with civil rights leaders. On January 8, during his first [[State of the Union (USA)|State of the Union address]], Johnson asked Congress to \"let this session of Congress be known as the session which did more for civil rights than the last hundred sessions combined.\" On January 23, 1964, the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|24th Amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution, prohibiting the use of [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] in national elections, was ratified with the approval of [[South Dakota]], the 38th state to do so.\n\nOn June 21, 1964, civil rights workers [[Michael Schwerner]], [[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Andrew Goodman]], and [[James Chaney]], disappeared in [[Neshoba County, Mississippi]]. The three were volunteers aiding in the registration of black voters as part of the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party|Mississippi Freedom Summer Project]]. Forty-four days later the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] recovered their bodies from an earthen dam where they were buried. The Neshoba County deputy sheriff Cecil Price and 16 others, all [[Ku Klux Klan]] members, were indicted for the murders; seven were convicted. The investigation also revealed the bodies of several black men, whose deaths had never been revealed or prosecuted by white law enforcement officials.\n\nWhen the Civil Rights Bill came before the full Senate for debate on March 30, 1964, the \"Southern Bloc\" of 18 southern Democratic Senators and one Republican Senator, led by [[Richard Russell, Jr.|Richard Russell]] (D-GA), launched a [[filibuster]] to prevent its passage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.congresslink.org/print_basics_histmats_civilrights64text.htm |title=Major Features of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 |publisher=Congresslink.org |accessdate=2010-06-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206191323/http://www.congresslink.org/print_basics_histmats_civilrights64text.htm |archivedate=2014-12-06 }}</ref> Russell said:\n\n{{quote|We will resist to the bitter end any measure or any movement which would have a tendency to bring about [[social equality]] and [[miscegenation|intermingling and amalgamation of the races]] in our (Southern) states.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://spartacus-educational.com/USAcivil64.htm |title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 |publisher=Spartacus-Educational.com |accessdate=2019-02-27 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516142923/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAcivil64.htm |archivedate=2010-05-16 }}</ref>}}\n\nAfter 57 working days of filibuster, and several compromises, the Senate had enough votes (71 to 29) to end the debate and the filibuster. It was the first time that Southern senators had failed to win with such tactics against civil rights bills. On July 2, President Johnson signed into law the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Civil Rights during the administration of Lyndon B.

It did not explicitly ban [[literacy tests]], which had been used to disqualify blacks and poor white voters.\n\nAs the [[United States Department of Justice]] has stated:\n\n<blockquote>By 1965 concerted efforts to break the grip of state disenfranchisement (sic) had been under way for some time, but had achieved only modest success overall and in some areas had proved almost entirely ineffectual. The murder of voting-rights activists in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]], gained national attention, along with numerous other acts of violence and terrorism. Finally, the unprovoked attack on March 7, 1965, by state troopers on peaceful marchers crossing the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] in [[Selma, Alabama]], en route to the state capitol in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], persuaded the President and Congress to overcome Southern legislators' resistance to effective voting rights legislation. President Johnson issued a call for a strong voting rights law and hearings began soon thereafter on the bill that would become the [[Voting Rights Act]].<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Introduction To Federal Voting Rights Laws\n |url         = http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/voting/intro/intro_b.htm\n |publisher   = United States Department of Justice\n |accessdate  = 2007-02-25\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070304111738/http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/voting/intro/intro_b.htm\n |archivedate = 2007-03-04\n}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nPassed in 1965, this law prohibited the use of literacy tests as a requirement to register to vote. It provided for recourse for local voters to federal oversight and intervention, plus federal monitoring of areas that historically had low voter turnouts to ensure that new measures were not taken against minority voters. It provided for federal enforcement of voting rights. African Americans began to enter the formal political process, most in the South for the first time in their lives. They have since won numerous seats and offices at local, state and federal levels.\n\n==See also==\n* [[African-American history]]\n* [[Civil rights movement (1865\u20131896)]]\n* [[Civil rights movement (1896\u20131954)]]\n* [[List of 19th-century African-American civil rights activists]]\n* [[Timeline of the civil rights movement]]\n* [[Felony disenfranchisement]]\n* [[Jim Crow laws]]\n* [[Nadir of American race relations]]\n* [[Judicial aspects of race in the United States]]\n* [[Voting rights in the United States]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist| group=\"nb\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Grantham, Dewey W.
