After leaving XFM, Merchant began a production course at the BBC.

(Merchant's father also appears in multiple episodes as an office handyman named Gordon.) Merchant also directed a sitcom pilot called ''[[The Last Chancers]]'', which aired on ''Comedy Lab'' in November 2002 and became a five-part series broadcast in December on [[E4 (channel)|E4]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Last Chancers|url=http://curtisbrown.co.uk/client/anthony-macmurray/work/the-last-chancers-1|publisher=Curtis Brown|accessdate=19 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nMerchant and Gervais continued to host ''The Ricky Gervais Show'' through 2003, taking another break to film the ''Office'' Christmas special, which aired that December.

During the era symbolized by the reign of British monarch [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], women did not have the right to vote, sue, or own property. At the same time, women participated in the paid workforce in increasing numbers following the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Feminist ideas spread among the educated middle classes, discriminatory laws were repealed, and the [[women's suffrage]] movement gained momentum in the last years of the Victorian era.\n\nIn the Victorian era, women were seen, by the middle classes at least, as belonging to the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]], and this stereotype required them to provide their husbands with a clean home, to put food on the table and to raise their children. Women's rights were extremely limited in this era, losing ownership of their wages, all of their physical property, excluding land property, and all other cash they generated once married.<ref>{{cite book|last=Buckner|first=Phillip Alfred|title=Rediscovering the British World|year=2005|publisher=University of Calgary Press|location=Calgary}}</ref> When a Victorian man and woman married, the rights of the woman were legally given over to her spouse. Under the law the married couple became one entity represented by the husband, placing him in control of all property, earnings, and money. In addition to losing money and material goods to their husbands, Victorian wives became property to their husbands, giving them rights to what their bodies produced: children, sex and domestic labor.<ref>{{cite book|last=Buckner|first=Phillip Alfred|title=Rediscovering the British World|year=2005|publisher=Calgary University Press|location=Calgary|page=137}}</ref> Marriage abrogated a woman's right to consent to sexual intercourse with her husband, giving him \"ownership\" over her body. Their mutual matrimonial consent therefore became a contract to give herself to her husband as he desired.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baines|first=Barbara J.|title=Effacing Rape in Early Modern Representation |journal=ELH|year=1998 |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=69\u201398\n|jstor=30030170|doi=10.1353/elh.1998.0009}}</ref>\n\nThe rights and privileges of Victorian women were limited, and both single and married women had to live with hardships and disadvantages. Victorian women were disadvantaged both financially and sexually, enduring inequalities within their marriages and society. There were sharp distinctions between men's and women's rights during this era; men were allotted more stability, financial status, and power over their homes and women. Marriages for Victorian women became contracts<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kreps|first=Barbara Irene|title=The Paradox of Women: The Legal Position of Early Modern Wives and Thomas Dekker's ''The Honest Whore''|journal=ELH|date=Spring 2002|volume=69|issue=1|pages=83\u2013102|doi=10.1353/elh.2002.0007}}</ref> which were extremely difficult if not impossible to get out of during the Victorian era. Women's rights groups fought for equality and over time made strides in attaining rights and privileges; however, many Victorian women endured their husband's control and even cruelty, including sexual violence, verbal abuse, and economic deprivation,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Joanne|title=English Marital Violence in Litigation, Literature and the Press|journal=Women's History|date=Winter 2007|volume=19|issue=4|pages=144\u2013153|doi=10.1353/jowh.2007.0065}}</ref> with no way out. While husbands participated in affairs with other women, wives endured infidelity, as they had no rights to divorce on these grounds and divorce was considered to be a social taboo.<ref name=\"Forman\">{{cite journal|last=Forman|first=Cody Lisa|title=The Politics of Illegitimacy in an Age of Reform: Women, Reproduction, and Political Economy in England's New Poor Law of 1834|journal=Women's History|year=2000|volume=11|issue=4|pages=131\u2013156|doi=10.1353/jowh.2000.0005}}</ref>\n\n==\"The Angel in the House\"==\n\nBy the Victorian era, the concept of \"[[pater familias]]\", meaning the husband as head of the household and moral leader of his family, was firmly entrenched in British culture. A wife's proper role was to love, honour and obey her husband, as her marriage vows stated.  A wife's place in the family hierarchy was secondary to her husband, but far from being considered unimportant, a wife's duties to tend to her husband and properly raise her children were considered crucial cornerstones of social stability by the Victorians.<ref>K. Theodore Hoppen, ''The mid-Victorian generation, 1846\u20131886'' (2000), pp 316ff.</ref>\n\nRepresentations of ideal wives were abundant in Victorian culture, providing women with their role models. The Victorian ideal of the tirelessly patient, sacrificing wife is depicted in ''[[The Angel in the House]]'', a popular poem by [[Coventry Patmore]], published in 1854:{{blockquote|\nMan must be pleased; but him to please<br> \nIs woman's pleasure; down the gulf<br>\nOf his condoled necessities<br>\nShe casts her best, she flings herself ...<br>\n<br>\nShe loves with love that cannot tire;<br>\nAnd when, ah woe, she loves alone,<br>\nThrough passionate duty love springs higher,<br>\nAs grass grows taller round a stone.<ref>{{cite web|last=Patmore|first=Coventry Kelsey Dighton|title=The Angel in the House|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4099|publisher=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=6 November 2011}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Virginia Woolf]] described the angel as:{{blockquote|immensely sympathetic, immensely charming, utterly unselfish. She excelled in the difficult arts of family life. She sacrificed herself daily ... in short, she was so constituted that she never had a mind but preferred to sympathize always with the minds and wishes of others. Above all ... she was pure. Her purity was supposed to be her chief beauty.<ref>{{cite book|last=Woolf, Virginia|chapter=The Professions of Women|title=Norton Anthology of Literature by Women|year=1996|publisher=W. W.

Advice such as \"The burden, or, rather the privilege, of making home happy is not the wife's alone. There is something demanded of the lord and master and if he fails in his part, domestic misery must follow\" (published in 1883 in ''Our Manners and Social Customs'' by Daphne Dale) was common in many publications of the time.<ref>Erbsen, Wayne. ''Manners and Morals of Victorian America.'' Native Ground Books & Music, Ashville; 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-883206-54-3}}. LCCN: 2008943591.</ref>\n\nLiterary critics of the time suggested that superior feminine qualities of delicacy, sensitivity, sympathy, and sharp observation gave women novelists a superior insight into stories about home, family, and love. This made their work highly attractive to the middle-class women who bought the novels and the serialized versions that appeared in many magazines. However, a few early feminists called for aspirations beyond the home. By the end of the century, the \"New Woman\" was riding a bicycle, wearing bloomers, signing petitions, supporting worldwide mission activities, and talking about the vote.<ref>F. Elizabeth Gray, \"Angel of the House\" in Adams, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Victorian Era'' (2004) 1: 40\u201341</ref>  \nFeminists of the 20th century reacted in hostile fashion to the \"Angel of the House\" theme since they felt the norm was still holding back their aspirations. Virginia Woolf was adamant. In a lecture to the Women's Service League in 1941, she  said \"killing the Angel in the House was part of the occupation of a woman writer.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Marcus|first=Jane|title=New Feminist Essays on Virginia Woolf|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DIJCr4MCvi0C&pg=PA45|year=1981|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|pages=45\u201346}}</ref>\n\n==\"The Household General\"==\n\n'The Household General' is a term coined in 1861 by [[Isabella Beeton]] in her influential manual ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management]]''. Here she explained that the mistress of a household is comparable to the commander of an army or the leader of an enterprise. To run a respectable household and secure the happiness, comfort and well-being of her family she must perform her duties intelligently and thoroughly. For example, she had to organize, delegate and instruct her servants, which was not an easy task as many of them were not reliable. Isabella Beeton's upper-middle-class readers may also have had a large complement of \"domestics\", a staff requiring supervision by the mistress of the house. Beeton advises her readers to maintain a \"housekeeping account book\" to track spending. She recommends daily entries and checking the balance monthly. In addition to tracking servants' wages, the mistress of the house was responsible for tracking payments to tradesmen such as butchers and bakers. If a household had the means to hire a housekeeper, whose duties included keeping the household accounts, Beeton goes so far as to advise readers to check the accounts of housekeepers regularly to ensure nothing was amiss.<ref name=\"Beeton\">{{cite web|last=Beeton|first=Isabella|title=The Book of Household Management|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10136/10136-8.txt|accessdate=11 November 2011|year=1861}}</ref>\n\nBeeton provided a table of domestic servant roles and their appropriate annual pay scale (\"found in [[livery]]\" meant that the employer provided meals and a work uniform). The sheer number of Victorian servants and their duties makes it clear why expertise in logistical matters would benefit the mistress of the house. Beeton indicates that the full list of servants in this table would be expected in the household of a \"wealthy nobleman\"; her readers are instructed to adjust staff size and pay according to the household's available budget, and other factors such as a servant's level of experience:<ref name=\"Beeton\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Beeton gives extensively detailed instructions on how to supervise servants in preparation for hosting dinners and balls. The etiquette to be observed in sending and receiving formal invitations is given, as well as the etiquette to be observed at the events themselves. The mistress of the house also had an important role in supervising the education of the youngest children. Beeton makes it clear that a woman's place is in the home, and her domestic duties come first. Social activities as an individual were less important than household management and socialising as her husband's companion. They were to be strictly limited: {{blockquote|After luncheon, morning calls and visits may be made and received.... Visits of ceremony, or courtesy ... are uniformly required after dining at a friend's house, or after a ball, picnic, or any other party.

In addition to Mrs. Beeton's ''Book of Household Management'', there were ''[[Infant Nursing and the Management of Young Children]]'' (1866) and ''[[Practical Housekeeping; or, the duties of a home-wife]]'' (1867) by [[Mrs. Frederick Pedley]], and ''[[From Kitchen to Garret]]'' by [[Jane Ellen Panton]], which went through 11 editions in a decade. [[Shirley Forster Murphy]] a doctor and medical writer, wrote the influential ''[[Our Homes, and How to Make them Healthy]]'' (1883), before he served as [[Medical Officer of Health for London|London's chief medical officer]] in the 1890s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Flanders|first=Judith|title=The Victorian House|year=2003|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=London|isbn=0-00-713189-5|pages=392\u20133}}</ref>\n\n==Working-class domestic life==\n\nDomestic life for a working-class family was far less comfortable. Legal standards for minimum housing conditions were a new concept during the Victorian era, and a working-class wife was responsible for keeping her family as clean, warm, and dry as possible in housing stock that was often literally rotting around them. In London, overcrowding was endemic in the slums inhabited by the working classes. (See [[Life and Labour of the People in London]].) Families living in single rooms were not unusual. The worst areas had examples such as 90 people crammed into a 10-room house, or 12 people living in a single room (7 feet 3&nbsp;inches by 14 feet).<ref name=\"Wise 2009 6\">{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Sarah|title=The Blackest Streets: The Life and Death of a Victorian Slum|year=2009|publisher=Vintage Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-84413-331-4|pages=6}}</ref> Rents were exorbitant; 85 percent of working-class households in London spent at least one-fifth of their income on rent, with 50 percent paying one-quarter to one-half of their income on rent. The poorer the neighbourhood, the higher the rents. Rents in the [[Old Nichol]] area near [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]], per cubic foot, were five to eleven times higher than rents in the fine streets and squares of the [[West End of London]]. The owners of the slum housing included peers, churchmen, and investment trusts for estates of long-deceased members of the upper classes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Sarah|title=The Blackest Streets: The Life and Death of a Victorian Slum|year=2009|publisher=Vintage Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-84413-331-4|pages=9\u201310}}</ref>\n\nDomestic chores for women without servants meant a great deal of washing and cleaning. Coal-dust from stoves (and factories) was the bane of the Victorian woman's housekeeping existence. Carried by wind and fog, it coated windows, clothing, furniture and rugs. [[Laundry|Washing clothing and linens]] would usually be done one day a week, scrubbed by hand in a large zinc or copper tub. Some water would be heated and added to the wash tub, and perhaps a handful of soda to soften the water.<ref>{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Janet Horowitz|title=Strong-Minded Women and Other Lost Voices from Nineteenth-Century England|url=https://archive.org/details/strongmindedwome00murr|url-access=registration|year=1982|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New york|isbn=0-394-71044-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/strongmindedwome00murr/page/177 177]}}</ref> Curtains were taken down and washed every fortnight; they were often so blackened by coal smoke that they had to be soaked in salted water before being washed.

Canada (Attorney General)]] in 1929). Women lost the rights to the property they brought into the marriage, even following divorce; a husband had complete legal control over any income earned by his wife; women were not allowed to open banking accounts; and married women were not able to conclude a contract without her husband's legal approval. These property restrictions made it difficult or impossible for a woman to leave a failed marriage, or to exert any control over her finances if her husband was incapable or unwilling to do so on her behalf.\n\nDomestic violence towards wives was given increasing attention by social and legal reformers as the 19th century continued. The first animal-cruelty legislation in Sudan was passed in 1824, however, legal protection from domestic violence was not granted to women until 1853 with the [[Act for the Better Prevention and Punishment of Aggravated Assaults upon Women and Children]]. Even this law did not outright ban violence by a man against his wife and children; it imposed legal limits on the amount of force that was permitted.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Sarah|title=The Blackest Streets: The Life and Death of a Victorian Slum|year=2009|publisher=Vintage Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-84413-331-4|pages=112}}</ref>\n\nAnother challenge was persuading women being battered by their husbands to make use of the limited legal recourse available to them. In 1843, an organisation founded by animal-rights and pro-temperance activists was established to help this social cause. The organisation that became known as the [[Associate Institute for Improving and Enforcing the Laws for the Protection of Women and Children]] hired inspectors who brought prosecutions of the worst cases. It focused its efforts on work-class women, since Victorian practise was to deny that middle-class or aristocratic families were in need of such intervention. There were sometimes cracks in the facade of propriety. In 1860, Mr. J. Walter, MP for [[Berkshire]], stated in the House of Commons that if members \"looked to the revelations in the Divorce Court they might well fear that if the secrets of all households were known, these brutal assaults upon women were by no means confined to the lower classes\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Sarah|title=The Blackest Streets: The Life and Death of a Victorian Slum|year=2009|publisher=Vintage Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-84413-331-4|pages=113}}</ref> A strong deterrent to middle-class or aristocratic wives seeking legal recourse, or divorce, was the social stigma and shunning that would follow such revelations in a public trial.\n\n===Divorce and separation===\nGreat change in the situation of women took place in the 19th century, especially concerning marriage laws and the legal rights of women to divorce and/or gain custody of children. The situation that fathers always received [[child custody|custody]] of their children, leaving the mother without any rights, slowly started to change. The ''[[Custody of Infants Act 1839|Custody of Infants Act]]'' in 1839 gave mothers of unblemished character access to their children in the event of [[Legal separation|separation]] or divorce, and the [[Matrimonial Causes Act]] in 1857 gave women limited access to divorce. But while the husband only had to prove his wife's [[adultery]], a woman had to prove her husband had not only committed adultery but also [[incest]], [[bigamy]], [[cruelty]] or [[desertion]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hurvitz|first=Rachael|title=Women and Divorce in the Victorian Era|url=http://www.123helpme.com/women-and-divorce-in-the-victorian-era-view.asp?id=154377|accessdate=6 October 2015}}</ref> In 1873 the ''Custody of Infants Act'' extended access to children to all women in the event of separation or divorce. In 1878, after an [[Law|amendment]] to the ''Matrimonial Causes Act'', women could secure a separation on the grounds of cruelty and claim custody of their children. [[Magistrate]]s even authorised protection orders to wives whose husbands have been convicted of aggravated assault. An important change was caused by an amendment to the [[Married Women's Property Act 1884]]. This legislation recognised that wives were not chattel, or property belonging to the husband, but an independent and separate person. Through the [[Guardianship of Infants Act]] in 1886, women could be made the sole [[legal guardian|guardian]] of their children if their husband died. Women slowly had their rights changed so that they could eventually leave their husbands for good. Some notable dates include:\n* 1857: violence recognized as grounds for divorce\n* 1870: women could keep money they earned\n* 1878: entitlement to spousal and child support recognized\n\n==Sexuality==\n\n===Cultural taboos surrounding the female body===\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 166831 Unidentified woman on a camel, ca. 1880.jpg|thumb|Camels were imported to Australia during the Victorian era; even then, women were expected to ride sidesaddle ([[Queensland]], 1880).]]\nThe ideal Victorian woman was pure, chaste, refined, and modest. This ideal was supported by etiquette and manners. The etiquette extended to the pretension of never acknowledging the use of undergarments (in fact, they were sometimes generically referred to as \"unmentionables\"). The discussion of such a topic, it was feared, would gravitate towards unhealthy attention on anatomical details. As one Victorian lady expressed it: \"[those] are not things, my dear, that we speak of; indeed, we try not even to think of them\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Cunnington|first=C.

In 1859, the Hon. Eleanor Stanley wrote about an incident where the [[Louisa Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Duchess of Manchester]] moved too quickly while manoeuvring over a [[stile]], tripping over her large [[hoop skirt]]:{{blockquote|[the Duchess] caught a hoop of her cage in it and went regularly head over heels lighting on her feet with her cage and whole petticoats above, above her head. They say there was never such a thing seen \u2013 and the other ladies hardly knew whether to be thankful or not that a part of her undergarments consisted in a pair of scarlet tartan [[knickerbockers (clothing)|knickerbockers]] (the things Charlie shoots in) which were revealed to the view of all the world in general and the [[Aimable P\u00e9lissier|Duc de Malakoff]] in particular\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Cunnington|first=C.

Many etiquette manuals for riding were published for this new market. For women, preserving modesty while riding was crucial. Breeches and riding trousers for women were introduced, for the practical reason of preventing chafing, yet these were worn under the dress. Riding clothes for women were made at the same tailors that made men's riding apparel, rather than at a dressmaker, so female assistants were hired to help with fittings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Berg|first=Valerie|title=The Berg Companion to Fashion|year=2010|publisher=Berg Publishers|isbn=978-1-84788-592-0|pages=249\u201350}}</ref>\n\nThe advent of colonialism and world travel presented new obstacles for women. Travel on horseback (or on [[donkey]]s, or even [[camel]]s) was often impossible to do sidesaddle because the animal had not been \"broken\" (trained) for sidesaddle riding. Riding costumes for women were introduced that used breeches or [[zouave]] trousers beneath long coats in some countries, while [[jodhpurs]] breeches used by men in India were adopted by women. These concessions were made so that women could ride astride a horse when necessary, but they were still exceptions to the rule of riding sidesaddle until after World War I.<ref>{{cite book|last=Berg|first=Valerie|title=The Berg Companion to Fashion|year=2010|publisher=Berg Publishers|isbn=978-1-84788-592-0|pages=250}}</ref> Travel writer [[Isabella Bird]] (1831\u20131904) was instrumental in challenging this taboo. At age 42, she travelled abroad on a doctor's recommendation. In [[Hawaii]], she determined that seeing the islands riding sidesaddle was impractical, and switched to riding astride. She was an ambitious traveller, going to the American West, the [[Rocky Mountains]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Baghdad]], [[Tehran]], and the [[Black Sea]]. Her written accounts sold briskly.\n\nWomen's physical activity was a cause of concern at the highest levels of academic research during the Victorian era. In Canada, physicians debated the appropriateness of women using bicycles:\n{{blockquote|A series of letters published in the Dominion Medical Monthly and Ontario Medical Journal in 1896, expressed concern that women seated on bicycle seats could have orgasms. [43] Fearful of unleashing and creating a nation of 'over-sexed' females, some physicians urged colleagues to encourage women to eschew 'modern dangers' and continue to pursue traditional leisure pursuits.  However, not all medical colleagues were convinced of the link between cycling and orgasm, and this debate on women's leisure activities continued well into the 20th century.<ref name=\"O'Connor\">{{cite web|last=O'Connor|first=Eileen|title=Medicine and Women's Clothing and Leisure Activities in Victorian Canada|url=http://yjhm.yale.edu/essays/eoconnor20070608.htm|publisher=Yale Journal for Humanities in Medicine|accessdate=26 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001045152/http://yjhm.yale.edu/essays/eoconnor20070608.htm|archivedate=1 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}\n\n===Victorian morality and sexuality===\n{{further|Victorian morality}}\nWomen were expected to have sex with only one man,her husband. However, it was acceptable for men to have multiple partners in their life; some husbands had lengthy affairs with other women while their wives stayed with their husbands because divorce was not an option.<ref name=\"Forman\"/> If a woman had sexual contact with another man, she was seen as \"ruined\" or \"[[Fallen woman|fallen]]\". Victorian literature and art was full of examples of women paying dearly for straying from moral expectations. Adulteresses met tragic ends in novels, including the ones by great writers such as [[Tolstoy]], [[Flaubert]] or [[Thomas Hardy]]. While some writers and artists showed sympathy towards women's subjugation to this double standard, some works were didactic and reinforced the cultural norm.\nIn the Victorian era, sex was not discussed openly and honestly; public discussion of sexual encounters and matters were met with ignorance, embarrassment and fear. One public opinion of women's sexual desires was that they were not very troubled by sexual urges. Even if women's desires were lurking, sexual experiences came with consequences for women and families. Limiting family sizes resulted in resisting sexual desires, except when a husband had desires which as a wife women were \"contracted\" to fulfill. Many people in the Victorian era were \"factually uninformed and emotionally frigid about sexual matters\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Marsh|first=Jan|title=Sex & Sexuality in the 19th Century|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/s/sex-and-sexuality-19th-century/|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref> To discourage premarital sexual relations the New Poor Law provided that \"women bear financial responsibilities for out-of-wedlock pregnancies\". In 1834 women were made legally and financially supportive of their illegitimate children.<ref name=\"Forman\"/> Sexual relations for women could not just be about desire and feelings: this was a luxury reserved for men; the consequences of sexual interactions for women took away the physical desires that women could possess.\n<gallery>\nFile:TheOutcastRichardRedgrave.jpg|''[[The Outcast (1851)|The Outcast]]'' by [[Richard Redgrave]] (1851).

Women suspected of being unclean were subjected to an involuntary [[pelvic examination|genital examination]]. Refusal was punishable by imprisonment; diagnosis with an illness was punishable by involuntary confinement to hospital until perceived as cured.\n\nThe disease prevention law was only applied to women, which became the primary rallying point for activists who argued that the law was both ineffective and inherently unfair to women.<ref>{{cite web|last=McElroy|first=Wendy|title=The Contagious Disease Acts|url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/0300e.asp|accessdate=30 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009121356/http://www.fff.org/freedom/0300e.asp|archivedate=9 October 2011}}</ref> Women could be picked up off the streets, suspected of prostitution on little or no evidence, and subjected to an examination. These were inexpertly performed by male police officers, making the exams painful as well as humiliating. After two extensions of the law in 1866 and 1869 the acts were finally repealed in 1896.  [[Josephine Butler]] was a women's rights crusader who fought to repeal the Acts.\n\n==Education==\nWomen were generally expected to marry and perform household and motherly duties rather than seek formal education. Even women who were not successful in finding husbands were generally expected to remain uneducated, and to take a position in childcare (as a governess or as a supporter to other members of her family). The outlook for education-seeking women improved when Queen's College in Harley Street, London was founded in 1848 \u2013 the goal of this college was to provide governesses with a marketable education. Later, the Cheltenham Ladies' College and other girls' public schools were founded, increasing educational opportunities for women's education and leading eventually to the development of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies in 1897.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/victorian-britain/articles/education-in-victorian-britain|title=Education in Victorian Britain|website=The British Library|language=en|access-date=24 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Women in the workforce==\n\n===Working-class employment===\n[[File:Statue in Bilston Town Centre - geograph.org.uk - 236033.jpg|thumb|A monument to women steel workers in [[Bilston]], England.]]\nWorking-class women often had occupations to make ends meet, and to ensure family income in the event that a husband became sick, injured, or died. There was no workers' compensation until late in the Victorian era, and a husband too ill or injured to work often meant an inability to pay the rent and a stay at the dreaded Victorian [[workhouse]].\n\nThroughout the Victorian era, some women were employed in heavy industry such as [[coal]] mines and the [[steel]] industry. Although they were employed in fewer numbers as the Victorian era continued and employment laws changed, they could still be found in certain roles. Before the [[Mines and Collieries Act 1842]], women (and children) worked underground as \"hurriers\" who carted tubs of coal up through the narrow mine shafts. In Wolverhampton, the law did not have much of an impact on women's mining employment, because they mainly worked above-ground at the coal mines, sorting coal, loading canal boats, and other surface tasks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Women at Work in the 19th Century|url=http://www.wolverhamptonhistory.org.uk/work/women/19th|publisher=Wolverhampton City Council|accessdate=6 November 2011}}</ref> Women also traditionally did \"all the chief tasks in agriculture\" in all counties of England, as a government inquiry found in 1843. By the late 1860s, agricultural work was not paying well, and women turned to industrial employment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=188}}</ref>\n\nIn areas with industrial factories, women could find employment on assembly lines for items ranging from locks to canned food. Industrial laundry services employed many women (including inmates of [[Magdalene asylum]]s who did not receive wages for their work). Women were also commonly employed in the textile mills that sprang up during the industrial revolution in such cities as Manchester, Leeds, and Birmingham. Working for a wage was often done from the home in London, although many women worked as \"hawkers\" or street vendors, who sold such things as [[watercress]], [[lavender]], flowers or herbs that they would collect at the Spitalfields fruit and vegetable market. Many working-class women worked as washerwomen, taking in laundry for a fee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/gender/wojtczak/lower.html|title=Women of the \"Lower\" Working Class|website=www.victorianweb.org|access-date=26 July 2016}}</ref> Animal-breeding in slum flats was common, such as dogs, geese, [[rabbit]]s and birds, to be sold at animal and bird markets. Housing inspectors often found livestock in slum cellars, including cows and donkeys.<ref name=\"Wise 2009 6\"/> Spinning and winding wool, silk, and other types of piecework were a common way of earning income by working from home, but wages were very low, and hours were long; often 14 hours per day were needed to earn enough to survive.<ref>{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=189}}</ref> Furniture-assembling and -finishing were common piecework jobs in working-class households in London that paid relatively well. Women in particular were known as skillful \"French polishers\" who completed the finish on furniture. The lowest-paying jobs available to working-class London women were matchbox-making, and sorting rags in a rag factory, where flea- and lice-ridden rags were sorted to be pulped for manufacturing paper.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Sarah|title=The Blackest Streets: The Life and Death of a Victorian Slum|year=2009|publisher=Vintage Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-84413-331-4|pages=60, 64}}</ref> Needlework was the single largest paid occupation for women working from home, but the work paid little, and women often had to rent sewing machines that they could not afford to buy. These home manufacturing industries became known as \"sweated industries\". The Select Committee of the House of Commons defined sweated industries in 1890 as \"work carried on for inadequate wages and for excessive hours in unsanitary conditions\". By 1906, such workers earned about a penny an hour.<ref>{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=189\u201390}}</ref>\n\nWomen could not expect to be paid the same wage as a man for the same work, despite the fact that women were as likely as men to be married and supporting children. In 1906, the government found that the average weekly factory wage for a woman ranged from 11s 3d to 18s 8d, whereas a man's average weekly wage was around 25s 9d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/victorian-britain/articles/the-working-classes-and-the-poor|title=The working classes and the poor|website=The British Library|access-date=26 July 2016}}</ref> Women were also preferred by many factory owners because they could be \"more easily induced to undergo severe bodily fatigue than men\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=191}}</ref> Childminding was another necessary expense for many women working in factories. Pregnant women worked up until the day they gave birth and returned to work as soon as they were physically able. In 1891, a law was passed requiring women to take four weeks away from factory work after giving birth, but many women could not afford this unpaid leave, and the law was unenforceable.<ref>{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=192\u20133}}</ref>\n\n===Middle-class employment===\nAs education for girls spread literacy to the working-classes during the mid- and late-Victorian era, some ambitious young women were able to find salaried jobs in new fields, such as salesgirls, cashiers, typists and secretaries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Sarah|title=The Blackest Streets: The Life and Death of a Victorian Slum|year=2009|publisher=Vintage Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-84413-331-4|pages=61}}</ref> Work as a domestic, such as a maid or cook, was common, but there was great competition for employment in the more respectable, and higher-paying, households. Private registries were established to control the employment of the better-qualified domestic servants.\n\nThroughout the Victorian era, respectable employment for women from solidly middle-class families was largely restricted to work as a school teacher or [[governess]]. Once [[telephone]] use became widespread, work as a telephone operator became a respectable job for middle-class women needing employment.\n\nThree medical professions were opened to women in the 19th century: [[nursing]], [[midwifery]], and doctoring. However, it was only in nursing, the one most subject to the supervision and authority of male doctors, that women were widely accepted. Victorians thought the doctor's profession characteristically belonged only to the male sex and a woman should not intrude upon this area but stay with the conventions the will of God has assigned to her. In conclusion, Englishmen would not have woman [[surgeons]] or physicians; they confined them to their role as ''nurses''.\n[[Florence Nightingale]] (1820\u20131910) was an important figure in renewing the traditional [[image]] of the nurse as the self-sacrificing, ministering angel\u2014the 'Lady with the lamp', spreading comfort as she passed among the wounded. She succeeded in modernising the nursing profession, promoting training for women and teaching them courage, confidence and self-assertion.\n\n==Leisure activities==\n[[File:George William Joy - The Bayswater Omnibus.jpg|thumb|400px|[[George William Joy]]'s depiction of men and women travelling in an omnibus in the early Victorian era]]\nMiddle-class women's leisure activities included in large part traditional pastimes such as reading, embroidery, music, and traditional handicrafts.

Opportunities for leisure activities increased dramatically as real wages continued to grow and hours of work continued to decline. In urban areas, the nine-hour workday became increasingly the norm; the 1874 Factory Act limited the workweek to 56.5 hours, encouraging the movement toward an eventual eight-hour workday. Helped by the [[Bank Holiday Act 1871|Bank Holiday Act of 1871]], which created a number of fixed holidays, a system of routine annual vacations came into play, starting with white-collar workers and moving into the working-class.<ref>[[G. R. Searle]], ''A New England?: Peace and War, 1886\u20131918'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), 529\u201370.</ref><ref>Hugh Cunningham, ''Time, work and leisure: Life changes in England since 1700'' (2014)</ref> Some 200 seaside resorts emerged thanks to cheap hotels and inexpensive railway fares, widespread banking holidays and the fading of many religious prohibitions against secular activities on Sundays. Middle-class Victorians used the train services to visit the seaside. Large numbers travelling to quiet fishing villages such as [[Worthing]], [[Morecambe]] and [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] began turning them into major tourist centres, and entrepreneurs led by [[Thomas Cook]] saw tourism and overseas travel as viable business models.<ref>John K. Walton, ''The English seaside resort. A social history 1750\u20131914'' (1983)</ref>\n\nBy the late Victorian era, the leisure industry had emerged in all cities with many women in attendance. It provided scheduled entertainment of suitable length at convenient locales at inexpensive prices. These included sporting events, music halls, and popular theater. Women were now allowed in some sports, such as archery, [[tennis]], [[badminton]] and gymnastics.<ref>Searle, ''A New England?'' pp 547\u201353</ref>\n\n===Physical activity===\n\nIn the early part of the nineteenth century, it was believed that physical activity was dangerous and inappropriate for women. Girls were taught to reserve their delicate health for the express purpose of birthing healthy children. Furthermore, the physiological difference between the sexes helped to reinforce the societal inequality. An anonymous female writer was able to contend that women were not intended to fill male roles, because \"women are, as a rule, physically smaller and weaker than men; their brain is much lighter; and they are in every way unfitted for the same amount of bodily or mental labour that men are able to undertake.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Anonymous|title=Women's Work: A Woman's Thoughts on Women's Rights|year=1876|publisher=William Blackwood and Sons|location=London|page=7}}</ref> Yet by the end of the century, medical understanding of the benefits of exercise created a significant expansion in physical culture for girls. Thus by 1902, ''The Girl's Empire'' magazine was able to run a series of articles on \"How to Be Strong\", proclaiming, \"The old-fashioned fallacies regarding health, diet, exercise, dress, &c., have nearly all been exploded, and to-day women are discarding the old ideas and methods, and entering into the new ''r\u00e9gime'' with a zest and vigour which bodes well for the future.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Anonymous|title=How to Be Strong: Special Exercises with the Sandow Grip Dumb-bell|year=1902|publisher=Andrew Melrose Publishing Company|location=London|page=4}}</ref>\n\nGirl's magazines, such as ''[[The Girl's Own Paper]]'' and ''The Girl's Empire'' frequently featured articles encouraging girls to take up daily exercises or learn how to play a sport. Popular sports for girls included [[hockey]], [[golf]], cycling, tennis, fencing, and swimming. Of course, many of these sports were limited to the middle and upper classes who could afford the necessary materials and free time needed to play. Nonetheless, the inclusion of girls in physical culture created a new space for girls to be visible outside of the home and to partake in activities previously only open to boys. Sports became central to the lives of many middle-class girls, to the point where social commentators worried it would overshadow other cultural concerns. For example, a 1902 ''Girl's Own Paper'' article on \"Athletics for Girls\" bewailed, \"To hear some modern schoolgirls, and even modern mothers, talk, one would suppose that hockey was the chief end of all education! The tone of the school\u2014the intellectual training\u2014these come in the second place. Tennis, cricket, but above all, hockey!\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Watson|first=Lily|title=Athleticism for Girls|journal=The Girl's Own Paper|date=25 October 1902|volume=24|page=62}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, older cultural conventions connecting girls to maternity and domesticity continued to influence girls' development. Thus, while girls had more freedom than ever before, much of the physical culture for girls was simultaneously justified in terms of motherhood: athletic, healthy girls would have healthier children, better able to improve the British race. For instance, an early article advising girls to exercise stresses the future role of girls as mothers to vindicate her argument: \"If, then, the importance of duly training the body in conjunction with the mind is thus recognised in the cause of our boys, surely the future wives and mothers of England\u2014for such is our girls' destiny\u2014may lay claim to a no less share of attention in this respect.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Arnold|first=Mrs. Wallace|title=The Physical Education of Girls|journal=The Girl's Own Paper|date=17 May 1884|volume=5|page=516}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:James Tissot - Croquet.jpg|''Croquet'' by [[James Tissot]].

Badminton and tennis were popular occasions for parties, with women playing \"mixed doubles\" alongside male players.\n</gallery>\n\n===Victorian women's fashion===\n{{Further|Victorian fashion}}\nVictorian women's clothing followed trends that emphasised elaborate dresses, skirts with wide volume created by the use of layered material such as [[crinoline]]s, [[hoop skirt]] frames, and heavy fabrics. Because of the impracticality and health impact of the era's fashions, a [[Victorian dress reform|reform movement]] began among women.\n\nThe ideal silhouette of the time demanded a narrow waist, which was accomplished by constricting the abdomen with a laced [[corset]]. While the silhouette was striking, and the dresses themselves were often exquisitely detailed creations, the fashions were cumbersome. At best, they restricted women's movements and at worst, they had a harmful effect on women's health. Physicians turned their attention to the use of corsets and determined that they caused several medical problems: compression of the thorax, restricted breathing, organ displacement, poor circulation, and prolapsed uterus.<ref name=\"O'Connor\"/>\n\nArticles advocating the reform of women's clothing by the British National Health Society, the Ladies' Dress Association, and the Rational Dress Society were reprinted in ''The Canada Lancet'', Canada's medical journal. In 1884, Dr. J. Algernon Temple of Toronto even voiced concern that the fashions were having a negative impact on the health of young women from the working classes. He pointed out that a young working-class woman was likely to spend a large part of her earnings on fine hats and shawls, while \"her feet are improperly protected, and she wears no flannel petticoat or woollen stockings\".<ref name=\"O'Connor\"/>\n\nFlorence Pomeroy, Lady Haberton, was president of the Rational Dress movement in Britain. At a National Health Society exhibition held in 1882, Viscountess Haliburton presented her invention of a \"divided skirt\", which was a long skirt that cleared the ground, with separate halves at the bottom made with material attached to the bottom of the skirt. She hoped that her invention would become popular by supporting women's freedom of physical movement, but the British public was not impressed by the invention, perhaps because of the negative \"unwomanly\" association of the style with the American Bloomers movement.<ref>{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Janet Horowitz|title=Strong-Minded Women and Other Lost Voices from 19th Century England|year=1982|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|isbn=0-394-71044-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/strongmindedwome00jane/page/68 68\u201370]|url=https://archive.org/details/strongmindedwome00jane/page/68}}</ref> [[Amelia Jenks Bloomer]] had encouraged the wearing of visible bloomers by feminists to assert their right to wear comfortable and practical clothing, but it was no more than a passing fashion itself among radical feminists. The movement to reform women's dress would persist and have longterm success, however; by the 1920s, [[Coco Chanel]] was enormously successful at selling a progressive, far less restrictive silhouette that abandoned the corset and raised hemlines. The new silhouette symbolised modernism for trendy young women and became the 20th century standard. Other Paris designers continued reintroducing pants for women and the trend was gradually adopted over the next century.\n\nFashion trends, in one sense, travelled \"full circle\" over the course of the Victorian era. The popular women's styles during the [[Georgian era]], and at the very beginning of Victoria's reign, emphasised a simple style influenced by flowing gowns worn by women in Ancient Greece and Rome. The [[Empire waist]] silhouette was replaced by a trend towards ornate styles and an artificial silhouette, with the restrictiveness of women's clothing reaching its low point during the mid-century passion for narrow corseted waists and hoop skirts. The iconic wide-brimmed women's hats of the later Victorian era also followed the trend towards ostentatious display. Hats began the Victorian era as simple bonnets. By the 1880s, milliners were tested by the competition among women to top their outfits with the most creative (and extravagant) hats, designed with expensive materials such as silk flowers and exotic plumes such as ostrich and peacock. As the Victorian era drew to a close, however, fashions were showing indications of a popular backlash against excessive styles. Model, actress and socialite [[Lillie Langtry]] took London by storm in the 1870s, attracting notice for wearing simple black dresses to social events. Combined with her natural beauty, the style appeared dramatic. Fashions followed her example (as well as Queen Victoria's wearing of mourning black later in her reign). According to [[Harold Koda]], the former Curator-in-chief of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute,<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2014/death-becomes-her]</ref> \"The predominantly black palette of mourning dramatizes the evolution of period silhouettes and the increasing absorption of fashion ideals into this most codified of etiquettes,\" said Koda, \"The veiled widow could elicit sympathy as well as predatory male advances. As a woman of sexual experience without marital constraints, she was often imagined as a potential threat to the social order.\"\n\n====Evolution of Victorian women's fashion====\n<gallery>\nFile:Princess Victoria and Dash by George Hayter.jpg|''Princess Victoria and Dash'' by [[George Hayter]] (1833).

The influence of British imperialism and British culture was powerful throughout the Victorian era. Women's roles in the colonial countries were determined by the expectations associated with loyalty to the Crown and the cultural standards that it symbolised.\n\n===Canada===\n{{see also|History of Canadian women}}\nThe upper classes of Canada were almost without exception of British origin during the Victorian era. At the beginning of the Victorian era, British North America included several separate colonies that joined together as a Confederation in 1867 to create Canada. Military and government officials and their families came to British North America from England or Scotland, and less often were of Protestant Irish origin. Most business interests were controlled by Canadians who were of British stock. English-speaking minorities who immigrated to Canada struggled for economic and government influence, including large numbers of Roman Catholic [[Irish Canadian|Irish]] and later [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukrainians]], [[Polish Canadians|Poles]], and other European immigrants. [[French-Canadians]] remained largely culturally isolated from English-speaking Canadians (a situation later described in ''[[Two Solitudes (novel)|Two Solitudes]]'' by [[Hugh MacLennan]]). Visible minority groups, such as indigenous [[First Nations]] and [[Chinese Canadian|Chinese]] labourers, were marginalised and suffered profound discrimination. Women's status was thus heavily dependent upon their ethnic identity as well as their place within the dominant British class structure.\n\nEnglish-speaking Canadian writers became popular, especially [[Catharine Parr Traill]] and her sister [[Susanna Moodie]], middle-class English settlers who published memoirs of their demanding lives as pioneers. Traill published ''The Backwoods of Canada'' (1836) and ''[[Canadian Crusoes]]'' (1852), and Moodie published ''[[Roughing it in the Bush]]'' (1852) and ''Life in the Clearings'' (1853). Their memoirs recount the harshness of life as women settlers, but were nonetheless popular.<ref>Marian Fowler,  '' The Embroidered Tent: Five Gentlewomen in Early Canada: Elizabeth Simcoe, Catharine Parr Traill, Susanna Moodie, Anna Jameson, Lady Dufferin'' (House Of Anansi, 1982).</ref>\n\nUpper-class Canadian women emulated British culture and imported as much of it as possible across the Atlantic. Books, magazines, popular music, and theatre productions were all imported to meet women's consumer demand.\n\nUpper-class women supported philanthropic causes similar to the educational and nursing charities championed by upper-class women in England. The [[Victorian Order of Nurses]], still in existence, was founded in 1897 as a gift to [[Queen Victoria]] to commemorate her [[Diamond Jubilee]]. The [[Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire]], founded in 1900, supports educational bursaries and book awards to promote [[Canadian patriotism]], but also to support knowledge of the [[British Empire]]. Both organisations had Queen Victoria as their official patron.  One of the patrons of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]]'s Victoria School of Art and Design (founded in 1887 and later named the [[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design]]) was [[Anna Leonowens]]. Women began making headway in their struggle to gain access to higher education: in 1875, the first woman university graduate in Canada was [[Grace Annie Lockhart]] ([[Mount Allison University]]). In 1880, [[Emily Stowe]] became the first woman licensed to practice medicine in Canada.\n\nWomen's legal rights made slow progress throughout the 19th century. In 1859, [[Upper Canada]] passed a law allowing married women to own property. In 1885, Alberta passed a law allowing unmarried women who owned property gained the right to vote and hold office in school matters.\n\nWomen's suffrage would not be achieved until the World War I period. Suffrage activism began during the later decades of the Victorian era. In 1883, the [[Toronto Women's Literary and Social Progress Club]] met and established the [[Canadian Women's Suffrage Association]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[The Edwardian Country House]]\n*[[Women in early modern Scotland]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|last=Goodwin|first=Harvey |authorlink=Harvey Goodwin|title=[[s:An address to women (Goodwin)|An address to women]]|year=1885|publisher=Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge|location=London}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist |2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Adams, James Eli, ed.

During the era symbolized by the reign of British monarch [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], women did not have the right to vote, sue, or own property. At the same time, women participated in the paid workforce in increasing numbers following the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Feminist ideas spread among the educated middle classes, discriminatory laws were repealed, and the [[women's suffrage]] movement gained momentum in the last years of the Victorian era.\n\nIn the Victorian era, women were seen, by the middle classes at least, as belonging to the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]], and this stereotype required them to provide their husbands with a clean home, to put food on the table and to raise their children. Women's rights were extremely limited in this era, losing ownership of their wages, all of their physical property, excluding land property, and all other cash they generated once married.<ref>{{cite book|last=Buckner|first=Phillip Alfred|title=Rediscovering the British World|year=2005|publisher=University of Calgary Press|location=Calgary}}</ref> When a Victorian man and woman married, the rights of the woman were legally given over to her spouse. Under the law the married couple became one entity represented by the husband, placing him in control of all property, earnings, and money. In addition to losing money and material goods to their husbands, Victorian wives became property to their husbands, giving them rights to what their bodies produced: children, sex and domestic labor.<ref>{{cite book|last=Buckner|first=Phillip Alfred|title=Rediscovering the British World|year=2005|publisher=Calgary University Press|location=Calgary|page=137}}</ref> Marriage abrogated a woman's right to consent to sexual intercourse with her husband, giving him \"ownership\" over her body.

A wife's proper role was to love, honour and obey her husband, as her marriage vows stated.  A wife's place in the family hierarchy was secondary to her husband, but far from being considered unimportant, a wife's duties to tend to her husband and properly raise her children were considered crucial cornerstones of social stability by the Victorians.<ref>K. Theodore Hoppen, ''The mid-Victorian generation, 1846\u20131886'' (2000), pp 316ff.</ref>\n\nRepresentations of ideal wives were abundant in Victorian culture, providing women with their role models. The Victorian ideal of the tirelessly patient, sacrificing wife is depicted in ''[[The Angel in the House]]'', a popular poem by [[Coventry Patmore]], published in 1854:{{blockquote|\nMan must be pleased; but him to please<br> \nIs woman's pleasure; down the gulf<br>\nOf his condoled necessities<br>\nShe casts her best, she flings herself ...<br>\n<br>\nShe loves with love that cannot tire;<br>\nAnd when, ah woe, she loves alone,<br>\nThrough passionate duty love springs higher,<br>\nAs grass grows taller round a stone.<ref>{{cite web|last=Patmore|first=Coventry Kelsey Dighton|title=The Angel in the House|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4099|publisher=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=6 November 2011}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Virginia Woolf]] described the angel as:{{blockquote|immensely sympathetic, immensely charming, utterly unselfish. She excelled in the difficult arts of family life. She sacrificed herself daily ... in short, she was so constituted that she never had a mind but preferred to sympathize always with the minds and wishes of others. Above all ... she was pure. Her purity was supposed to be her chief beauty.<ref>{{cite book|last=Woolf, Virginia|chapter=The Professions of Women|title=Norton Anthology of Literature by Women|year=1996|publisher=W. W.

Advice such as \"The burden, or, rather the privilege, of making home happy is not the wife's alone. There is something demanded of the lord and master and if he fails in his part, domestic misery must follow\" (published in 1883 in ''Our Manners and Social Customs'' by Daphne Dale) was common in many publications of the time.<ref>Erbsen, Wayne.

LCCN: 2008943591.</ref>\n\nLiterary critics of the time suggested that superior feminine qualities of delicacy, sensitivity, sympathy, and sharp observation gave women novelists a superior insight into stories about home, family, and love. This made their work highly attractive to the middle-class women who bought the novels and the serialized versions that appeared in many magazines. However, a few early feminists called for aspirations beyond the home. By the end of the century, the \"New Woman\" was riding a bicycle, wearing bloomers, signing petitions, supporting worldwide mission activities, and talking about the vote.<ref>F. Elizabeth Gray, \"Angel of the House\" in Adams, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Victorian Era'' (2004) 1: 40\u201341</ref>  \nFeminists of the 20th century reacted in hostile fashion to the \"Angel of the House\" theme since they felt the norm was still holding back their aspirations. Virginia Woolf was adamant. In a lecture to the Women's Service League in 1941, she  said \"killing the Angel in the House was part of the occupation of a woman writer.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Marcus|first=Jane|title=New Feminist Essays on Virginia Woolf|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DIJCr4MCvi0C&pg=PA45|year=1981|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|pages=45\u201346}}</ref>\n\n==\"The Household General\"==\n\n'The Household General' is a term coined in 1861 by [[Isabella Beeton]] in her influential manual ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management]]''. Here she explained that the mistress of a household is comparable to the commander of an army or the leader of an enterprise. To run a respectable household and secure the happiness, comfort and well-being of her family she must perform her duties intelligently and thoroughly. For example, she had to organize, delegate and instruct her servants, which was not an easy task as many of them were not reliable. Isabella Beeton's upper-middle-class readers may also have had a large complement of \"domestics\", a staff requiring supervision by the mistress of the house. Beeton advises her readers to maintain a \"housekeeping account book\" to track spending. She recommends daily entries and checking the balance monthly. In addition to tracking servants' wages, the mistress of the house was responsible for tracking payments to tradesmen such as butchers and bakers. If a household had the means to hire a housekeeper, whose duties included keeping the household accounts, Beeton goes so far as to advise readers to check the accounts of housekeepers regularly to ensure nothing was amiss.<ref name=\"Beeton\">{{cite web|last=Beeton|first=Isabella|title=The Book of Household Management|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10136/10136-8.txt|accessdate=11 November 2011|year=1861}}</ref>\n\nBeeton provided a table of domestic servant roles and their appropriate annual pay scale (\"found in [[livery]]\" meant that the employer provided meals and a work uniform). The sheer number of Victorian servants and their duties makes it clear why expertise in logistical matters would benefit the mistress of the house. Beeton indicates that the full list of servants in this table would be expected in the household of a \"wealthy nobleman\"; her readers are instructed to adjust staff size and pay according to the household's available budget, and other factors such as a servant's level of experience:<ref name=\"Beeton\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Beeton gives extensively detailed instructions on how to supervise servants in preparation for hosting dinners and balls. The etiquette to be observed in sending and receiving formal invitations is given, as well as the etiquette to be observed at the events themselves. The mistress of the house also had an important role in supervising the education of the youngest children. Beeton makes it clear that a woman's place is in the home, and her domestic duties come first. Social activities as an individual were less important than household management and socialising as her husband's companion. They were to be strictly limited: {{blockquote|After luncheon, morning calls and visits may be made and received.... Visits of ceremony, or courtesy ... are uniformly required after dining at a friend's house, or after a ball, picnic, or any other party. These visits should be short, a stay of from fifteen to twenty minutes being quite sufficient. A lady paying a visit may remove her boa or neckerchief; but neither shawl nor bonnet....<ref name=\"Beeton\"/>}}\n\nAdvice books on housekeeping and the duties of an ideal wife were plentiful during the Victorian era, and sold well among the middle class. In addition to Mrs. Beeton's ''Book of Household Management'', there were ''[[Infant Nursing and the Management of Young Children]]'' (1866) and ''[[Practical Housekeeping; or, the duties of a home-wife]]'' (1867) by [[Mrs. Frederick Pedley]], and ''[[From Kitchen to Garret]]'' by [[Jane Ellen Panton]], which went through 11 editions in a decade. [[Shirley Forster Murphy]] a doctor and medical writer, wrote the influential ''[[Our Homes, and How to Make them Healthy]]'' (1883), before he served as [[Medical Officer of Health for London|London's chief medical officer]] in the 1890s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Flanders|first=Judith|title=The Victorian House|year=2003|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=London|isbn=0-00-713189-5|pages=392\u20133}}</ref>\n\n==Working-class domestic life==\n\nDomestic life for a working-class family was far less comfortable. Legal standards for minimum housing conditions were a new concept during the Victorian era, and a working-class wife was responsible for keeping her family as clean, warm, and dry as possible in housing stock that was often literally rotting around them. In London, overcrowding was endemic in the slums inhabited by the working classes. (See [[Life and Labour of the People in London]].) Families living in single rooms were not unusual. The worst areas had examples such as 90 people crammed into a 10-room house, or 12 people living in a single room (7 feet 3&nbsp;inches by 14 feet).<ref name=\"Wise 2009 6\">{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Sarah|title=The Blackest Streets: The Life and Death of a Victorian Slum|year=2009|publisher=Vintage Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-84413-331-4|pages=6}}</ref> Rents were exorbitant; 85 percent of working-class households in London spent at least one-fifth of their income on rent, with 50 percent paying one-quarter to one-half of their income on rent. The poorer the neighbourhood, the higher the rents. Rents in the [[Old Nichol]] area near [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]], per cubic foot, were five to eleven times higher than rents in the fine streets and squares of the [[West End of London]]. The owners of the slum housing included peers, churchmen, and investment trusts for estates of long-deceased members of the upper classes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Sarah|title=The Blackest Streets: The Life and Death of a Victorian Slum|year=2009|publisher=Vintage Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-84413-331-4|pages=9\u201310}}</ref>\n\nDomestic chores for women without servants meant a great deal of washing and cleaning. Coal-dust from stoves (and factories) was the bane of the Victorian woman's housekeeping existence. Carried by wind and fog, it coated windows, clothing, furniture and rugs. [[Laundry|Washing clothing and linens]] would usually be done one day a week, scrubbed by hand in a large zinc or copper tub. Some water would be heated and added to the wash tub, and perhaps a handful of soda to soften the water.<ref>{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Janet Horowitz|title=Strong-Minded Women and Other Lost Voices from Nineteenth-Century England|url=https://archive.org/details/strongmindedwome00murr|url-access=registration|year=1982|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New york|isbn=0-394-71044-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/strongmindedwome00murr/page/177 177]}}</ref> Curtains were taken down and washed every fortnight; they were often so blackened by coal smoke that they had to be soaked in salted water before being washed. Scrubbing the front wooden doorstep of the home every morning was also an important chore to maintain respectability.<ref>{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Janet Horowitz|title=Strong-Minded Women and Other Lost Voices from Nineteenth-Century England|url=https://archive.org/details/strongmindedwome00murr|url-access=registration|year=1982|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New york|isbn=0-394-71044-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/strongmindedwome00murr/page/179 179]}}</ref>\n\n==Divorce and legal discrimination==\n\n===Domestic violence and abuse===\nThe law regarded men as persons, and legal recognition of women's rights as autonomous persons would be a slow process, and would not be fully accomplished until well into the 20th century (in Canada, women achieved legal recognition through the \"Persons Case\", [[Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General)]] in 1929). Women lost the rights to the property they brought into the marriage, even following divorce; a husband had complete legal control over any income earned by his wife; women were not allowed to open banking accounts; and married women were not able to conclude a contract without her husband's legal approval. These property restrictions made it difficult or impossible for a woman to leave a failed marriage, or to exert any control over her finances if her husband was incapable or unwilling to do so on her behalf.\n\nDomestic violence towards wives was given increasing attention by social and legal reformers as the 19th century continued. The first animal-cruelty legislation in Sudan was passed in 1824, however, legal protection from domestic violence was not granted to women until 1853 with the [[Act for the Better Prevention and Punishment of Aggravated Assaults upon Women and Children]]. Even this law did not outright ban violence by a man against his wife and children; it imposed legal limits on the amount of force that was permitted.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Sarah|title=The Blackest Streets: The Life and Death of a Victorian Slum|year=2009|publisher=Vintage Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-84413-331-4|pages=112}}</ref>\n\nAnother challenge was persuading women being battered by their husbands to make use of the limited legal recourse available to them. In 1843, an organisation founded by animal-rights and pro-temperance activists was established to help this social cause. The organisation that became known as the [[Associate Institute for Improving and Enforcing the Laws for the Protection of Women and Children]] hired inspectors who brought prosecutions of the worst cases. It focused its efforts on work-class women, since Victorian practise was to deny that middle-class or aristocratic families were in need of such intervention. There were sometimes cracks in the facade of propriety. In 1860, Mr. J. Walter, MP for [[Berkshire]], stated in the House of Commons that if members \"looked to the revelations in the Divorce Court they might well fear that if the secrets of all households were known, these brutal assaults upon women were by no means confined to the lower classes\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Sarah|title=The Blackest Streets: The Life and Death of a Victorian Slum|year=2009|publisher=Vintage Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-84413-331-4|pages=113}}</ref> A strong deterrent to middle-class or aristocratic wives seeking legal recourse, or divorce, was the social stigma and shunning that would follow such revelations in a public trial.\n\n===Divorce and separation===\nGreat change in the situation of women took place in the 19th century, especially concerning marriage laws and the legal rights of women to divorce and/or gain custody of children. The situation that fathers always received [[child custody|custody]] of their children, leaving the mother without any rights, slowly started to change. The ''[[Custody of Infants Act 1839|Custody of Infants Act]]'' in 1839 gave mothers of unblemished character access to their children in the event of [[Legal separation|separation]] or divorce, and the [[Matrimonial Causes Act]] in 1857 gave women limited access to divorce. But while the husband only had to prove his wife's [[adultery]], a woman had to prove her husband had not only committed adultery but also [[incest]], [[bigamy]], [[cruelty]] or [[desertion]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hurvitz|first=Rachael|title=Women and Divorce in the Victorian Era|url=http://www.123helpme.com/women-and-divorce-in-the-victorian-era-view.asp?id=154377|accessdate=6 October 2015}}</ref> In 1873 the ''Custody of Infants Act'' extended access to children to all women in the event of separation or divorce. In 1878, after an [[Law|amendment]] to the ''Matrimonial Causes Act'', women could secure a separation on the grounds of cruelty and claim custody of their children. [[Magistrate]]s even authorised protection orders to wives whose husbands have been convicted of aggravated assault. An important change was caused by an amendment to the [[Married Women's Property Act 1884]]. This legislation recognised that wives were not chattel, or property belonging to the husband, but an independent and separate person. Through the [[Guardianship of Infants Act]] in 1886, women could be made the sole [[legal guardian|guardian]] of their children if their husband died. Women slowly had their rights changed so that they could eventually leave their husbands for good. Some notable dates include:\n* 1857: violence recognized as grounds for divorce\n* 1870: women could keep money they earned\n* 1878: entitlement to spousal and child support recognized\n\n==Sexuality==\n\n===Cultural taboos surrounding the female body===\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 166831 Unidentified woman on a camel, ca. 1880.jpg|thumb|Camels were imported to Australia during the Victorian era; even then, women were expected to ride sidesaddle ([[Queensland]], 1880).]]\nThe ideal Victorian woman was pure, chaste, refined, and modest. This ideal was supported by etiquette and manners. The etiquette extended to the pretension of never acknowledging the use of undergarments (in fact, they were sometimes generically referred to as \"unmentionables\"). The discussion of such a topic, it was feared, would gravitate towards unhealthy attention on anatomical details. As one Victorian lady expressed it: \"[those] are not things, my dear, that we speak of; indeed, we try not even to think of them\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Cunnington|first=C.

In 1859, the Hon. Eleanor Stanley wrote about an incident where the [[Louisa Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Duchess of Manchester]] moved too quickly while manoeuvring over a [[stile]], tripping over her large [[hoop skirt]]:{{blockquote|[the Duchess] caught a hoop of her cage in it and went regularly head over heels lighting on her feet with her cage and whole petticoats above, above her head. They say there was never such a thing seen \u2013 and the other ladies hardly knew whether to be thankful or not that a part of her undergarments consisted in a pair of scarlet tartan [[knickerbockers (clothing)|knickerbockers]] (the things Charlie shoots in) which were revealed to the view of all the world in general and the [[Aimable P\u00e9lissier|Duc de Malakoff]] in particular\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Cunnington|first=C.

Many etiquette manuals for riding were published for this new market. For women, preserving modesty while riding was crucial. Breeches and riding trousers for women were introduced, for the practical reason of preventing chafing, yet these were worn under the dress. Riding clothes for women were made at the same tailors that made men's riding apparel, rather than at a dressmaker, so female assistants were hired to help with fittings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Berg|first=Valerie|title=The Berg Companion to Fashion|year=2010|publisher=Berg Publishers|isbn=978-1-84788-592-0|pages=249\u201350}}</ref>\n\nThe advent of colonialism and world travel presented new obstacles for women. Travel on horseback (or on [[donkey]]s, or even [[camel]]s) was often impossible to do sidesaddle because the animal had not been \"broken\" (trained) for sidesaddle riding. Riding costumes for women were introduced that used breeches or [[zouave]] trousers beneath long coats in some countries, while [[jodhpurs]] breeches used by men in India were adopted by women. These concessions were made so that women could ride astride a horse when necessary, but they were still exceptions to the rule of riding sidesaddle until after World War I.<ref>{{cite book|last=Berg|first=Valerie|title=The Berg Companion to Fashion|year=2010|publisher=Berg Publishers|isbn=978-1-84788-592-0|pages=250}}</ref> Travel writer [[Isabella Bird]] (1831\u20131904) was instrumental in challenging this taboo. At age 42, she travelled abroad on a doctor's recommendation. In [[Hawaii]], she determined that seeing the islands riding sidesaddle was impractical, and switched to riding astride. She was an ambitious traveller, going to the American West, the [[Rocky Mountains]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Baghdad]], [[Tehran]], and the [[Black Sea]]. Her written accounts sold briskly.\n\nWomen's physical activity was a cause of concern at the highest levels of academic research during the Victorian era. In Canada, physicians debated the appropriateness of women using bicycles:\n{{blockquote|A series of letters published in the Dominion Medical Monthly and Ontario Medical Journal in 1896, expressed concern that women seated on bicycle seats could have orgasms. [43] Fearful of unleashing and creating a nation of 'over-sexed' females, some physicians urged colleagues to encourage women to eschew 'modern dangers' and continue to pursue traditional leisure pursuits.  However, not all medical colleagues were convinced of the link between cycling and orgasm, and this debate on women's leisure activities continued well into the 20th century.<ref name=\"O'Connor\">{{cite web|last=O'Connor|first=Eileen|title=Medicine and Women's Clothing and Leisure Activities in Victorian Canada|url=http://yjhm.yale.edu/essays/eoconnor20070608.htm|publisher=Yale Journal for Humanities in Medicine|accessdate=26 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001045152/http://yjhm.yale.edu/essays/eoconnor20070608.htm|archivedate=1 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}\n\n===Victorian morality and sexuality===\n{{further|Victorian morality}}\nWomen were expected to have sex with only one man,her husband. However, it was acceptable for men to have multiple partners in their life; some husbands had lengthy affairs with other women while their wives stayed with their husbands because divorce was not an option.<ref name=\"Forman\"/> If a woman had sexual contact with another man, she was seen as \"ruined\" or \"[[Fallen woman|fallen]]\". Victorian literature and art was full of examples of women paying dearly for straying from moral expectations. Adulteresses met tragic ends in novels, including the ones by great writers such as [[Tolstoy]], [[Flaubert]] or [[Thomas Hardy]]. While some writers and artists showed sympathy towards women's subjugation to this double standard, some works were didactic and reinforced the cultural norm.\nIn the Victorian era, sex was not discussed openly and honestly; public discussion of sexual encounters and matters were met with ignorance, embarrassment and fear. One public opinion of women's sexual desires was that they were not very troubled by sexual urges. Even if women's desires were lurking, sexual experiences came with consequences for women and families. Limiting family sizes resulted in resisting sexual desires, except when a husband had desires which as a wife women were \"contracted\" to fulfill. Many people in the Victorian era were \"factually uninformed and emotionally frigid about sexual matters\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Marsh|first=Jan|title=Sex & Sexuality in the 19th Century|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/s/sex-and-sexuality-19th-century/|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref> To discourage premarital sexual relations the New Poor Law provided that \"women bear financial responsibilities for out-of-wedlock pregnancies\". In 1834 women were made legally and financially supportive of their illegitimate children.<ref name=\"Forman\"/> Sexual relations for women could not just be about desire and feelings: this was a luxury reserved for men; the consequences of sexual interactions for women took away the physical desires that women could possess.\n<gallery>\nFile:TheOutcastRichardRedgrave.jpg|''[[The Outcast (1851)|The Outcast]]'' by [[Richard Redgrave]] (1851).

Women suspected of being unclean were subjected to an involuntary [[pelvic examination|genital examination]]. Refusal was punishable by imprisonment; diagnosis with an illness was punishable by involuntary confinement to hospital until perceived as cured.\n\nThe disease prevention law was only applied to women, which became the primary rallying point for activists who argued that the law was both ineffective and inherently unfair to women.<ref>{{cite web|last=McElroy|first=Wendy|title=The Contagious Disease Acts|url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/0300e.asp|accessdate=30 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009121356/http://www.fff.org/freedom/0300e.asp|archivedate=9 October 2011}}</ref> Women could be picked up off the streets, suspected of prostitution on little or no evidence, and subjected to an examination. These were inexpertly performed by male police officers, making the exams painful as well as humiliating. After two extensions of the law in 1866 and 1869 the acts were finally repealed in 1896.  [[Josephine Butler]] was a women's rights crusader who fought to repeal the Acts.\n\n==Education==\nWomen were generally expected to marry and perform household and motherly duties rather than seek formal education. Even women who were not successful in finding husbands were generally expected to remain uneducated, and to take a position in childcare (as a governess or as a supporter to other members of her family). The outlook for education-seeking women improved when Queen's College in Harley Street, London was founded in 1848 \u2013 the goal of this college was to provide governesses with a marketable education. Later, the Cheltenham Ladies' College and other girls' public schools were founded, increasing educational opportunities for women's education and leading eventually to the development of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies in 1897.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/victorian-britain/articles/education-in-victorian-britain|title=Education in Victorian Britain|website=The British Library|language=en|access-date=24 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Women in the workforce==\n\n===Working-class employment===\n[[File:Statue in Bilston Town Centre - geograph.org.uk - 236033.jpg|thumb|A monument to women steel workers in [[Bilston]], England.]]\nWorking-class women often had occupations to make ends meet, and to ensure family income in the event that a husband became sick, injured, or died. There was no workers' compensation until late in the Victorian era, and a husband too ill or injured to work often meant an inability to pay the rent and a stay at the dreaded Victorian [[workhouse]].\n\nThroughout the Victorian era, some women were employed in heavy industry such as [[coal]] mines and the [[steel]] industry. Although they were employed in fewer numbers as the Victorian era continued and employment laws changed, they could still be found in certain roles. Before the [[Mines and Collieries Act 1842]], women (and children) worked underground as \"hurriers\" who carted tubs of coal up through the narrow mine shafts. In Wolverhampton, the law did not have much of an impact on women's mining employment, because they mainly worked above-ground at the coal mines, sorting coal, loading canal boats, and other surface tasks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Women at Work in the 19th Century|url=http://www.wolverhamptonhistory.org.uk/work/women/19th|publisher=Wolverhampton City Council|accessdate=6 November 2011}}</ref> Women also traditionally did \"all the chief tasks in agriculture\" in all counties of England, as a government inquiry found in 1843. By the late 1860s, agricultural work was not paying well, and women turned to industrial employment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=188}}</ref>\n\nIn areas with industrial factories, women could find employment on assembly lines for items ranging from locks to canned food. Industrial laundry services employed many women (including inmates of [[Magdalene asylum]]s who did not receive wages for their work). Women were also commonly employed in the textile mills that sprang up during the industrial revolution in such cities as Manchester, Leeds, and Birmingham. Working for a wage was often done from the home in London, although many women worked as \"hawkers\" or street vendors, who sold such things as [[watercress]], [[lavender]], flowers or herbs that they would collect at the Spitalfields fruit and vegetable market. Many working-class women worked as washerwomen, taking in laundry for a fee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/gender/wojtczak/lower.html|title=Women of the \"Lower\" Working Class|website=www.victorianweb.org|access-date=26 July 2016}}</ref> Animal-breeding in slum flats was common, such as dogs, geese, [[rabbit]]s and birds, to be sold at animal and bird markets.

These home manufacturing industries became known as \"sweated industries\". The Select Committee of the House of Commons defined sweated industries in 1890 as \"work carried on for inadequate wages and for excessive hours in unsanitary conditions\". By 1906, such workers earned about a penny an hour.<ref>{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=189\u201390}}</ref>\n\nWomen could not expect to be paid the same wage as a man for the same work, despite the fact that women were as likely as men to be married and supporting children. In 1906, the government found that the average weekly factory wage for a woman ranged from 11s 3d to 18s 8d, whereas a man's average weekly wage was around 25s 9d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/victorian-britain/articles/the-working-classes-and-the-poor|title=The working classes and the poor|website=The British Library|access-date=26 July 2016}}</ref> Women were also preferred by many factory owners because they could be \"more easily induced to undergo severe bodily fatigue than men\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=191}}</ref> Childminding was another necessary expense for many women working in factories. Pregnant women worked up until the day they gave birth and returned to work as soon as they were physically able. In 1891, a law was passed requiring women to take four weeks away from factory work after giving birth, but many women could not afford this unpaid leave, and the law was unenforceable.<ref>{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=192\u20133}}</ref>\n\n===Middle-class employment===\nAs education for girls spread literacy to the working-classes during the mid- and late-Victorian era, some ambitious young women were able to find salaried jobs in new fields, such as salesgirls, cashiers, typists and secretaries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Sarah|title=The Blackest Streets: The Life and Death of a Victorian Slum|year=2009|publisher=Vintage Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-84413-331-4|pages=61}}</ref> Work as a domestic, such as a maid or cook, was common, but there was great competition for employment in the more respectable, and higher-paying, households. Private registries were established to control the employment of the better-qualified domestic servants.\n\nThroughout the Victorian era, respectable employment for women from solidly middle-class families was largely restricted to work as a school teacher or [[governess]]. Once [[telephone]] use became widespread, work as a telephone operator became a respectable job for middle-class women needing employment.\n\nThree medical professions were opened to women in the 19th century: [[nursing]], [[midwifery]], and doctoring. However, it was only in nursing, the one most subject to the supervision and authority of male doctors, that women were widely accepted. Victorians thought the doctor's profession characteristically belonged only to the male sex and a woman should not intrude upon this area but stay with the conventions the will of God has assigned to her. In conclusion, Englishmen would not have woman [[surgeons]] or physicians; they confined them to their role as ''nurses''.\n[[Florence Nightingale]] (1820\u20131910) was an important figure in renewing the traditional [[image]] of the nurse as the self-sacrificing, ministering angel\u2014the 'Lady with the lamp', spreading comfort as she passed among the wounded. She succeeded in modernising the nursing profession, promoting training for women and teaching them courage, confidence and self-assertion.\n\n==Leisure activities==\n[[File:George William Joy - The Bayswater Omnibus.jpg|thumb|400px|[[George William Joy]]'s depiction of men and women travelling in an omnibus in the early Victorian era]]\nMiddle-class women's leisure activities included in large part traditional pastimes such as reading, embroidery, music, and traditional handicrafts. Upper-class women donated handicrafts to charity bazaars, which allowed these women to publicly display and sell their handicrafts.<ref name=Whitlock>{{cite book|last1=Whitlock|first1=Tammy C.|title=Crime, Gender and Consumer Culture in Nineteenth-Century England.|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781351947572|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0WoDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT61&dq=%22charity+bazaar%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiLh9OEi8TXAhULyWMKHUODDTMQ6AEISTAI#v=onepage&q=%22charity%20bazaar%22&f=false<!--no page numbers in the google book result-->}}</ref><ref name=Waddington>{{cite book|last1=Waddington|first1=Keir|title=Charity and the London hospitals, 1850-1898|date=2000|publisher=Royal Historical Society|location=London|isbn=9780861932467|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7v_Fmu_6lIMC&pg=PA48&dq=%22charity+bazaar%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjvycmOi8TXAhUELmMKHUnTD_M4ChDoAQgnMAA#v=onepage&q=%22charity%20bazaar%22&f=false|pages=47\u201349}}</ref>\n\nMore modern pursuits were introduced to women's lives during the 19th century.  Opportunities for leisure activities increased dramatically as real wages continued to grow and hours of work continued to decline. In urban areas, the nine-hour workday became increasingly the norm; the 1874 Factory Act limited the workweek to 56.5 hours, encouraging the movement toward an eventual eight-hour workday. Helped by the [[Bank Holiday Act 1871|Bank Holiday Act of 1871]], which created a number of fixed holidays, a system of routine annual vacations came into play, starting with white-collar workers and moving into the working-class.<ref>[[G. R. Searle]], ''A New England?: Peace and War, 1886\u20131918'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), 529\u201370.</ref><ref>Hugh Cunningham, ''Time, work and leisure: Life changes in England since 1700'' (2014)</ref> Some 200 seaside resorts emerged thanks to cheap hotels and inexpensive railway fares, widespread banking holidays and the fading of many religious prohibitions against secular activities on Sundays. Middle-class Victorians used the train services to visit the seaside. Large numbers travelling to quiet fishing villages such as [[Worthing]], [[Morecambe]] and [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] began turning them into major tourist centres, and entrepreneurs led by [[Thomas Cook]] saw tourism and overseas travel as viable business models.<ref>John K. Walton, ''The English seaside resort. A social history 1750\u20131914'' (1983)</ref>\n\nBy the late Victorian era, the leisure industry had emerged in all cities with many women in attendance. It provided scheduled entertainment of suitable length at convenient locales at inexpensive prices. These included sporting events, music halls, and popular theater. Women were now allowed in some sports, such as archery, [[tennis]], [[badminton]] and gymnastics.<ref>Searle, ''A New England?'' pp 547\u201353</ref>\n\n===Physical activity===\n\nIn the early part of the nineteenth century, it was believed that physical activity was dangerous and inappropriate for women. Girls were taught to reserve their delicate health for the express purpose of birthing healthy children. Furthermore, the physiological difference between the sexes helped to reinforce the societal inequality. An anonymous female writer was able to contend that women were not intended to fill male roles, because \"women are, as a rule, physically smaller and weaker than men; their brain is much lighter; and they are in every way unfitted for the same amount of bodily or mental labour that men are able to undertake.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Anonymous|title=Women's Work: A Woman's Thoughts on Women's Rights|year=1876|publisher=William Blackwood and Sons|location=London|page=7}}</ref> Yet by the end of the century, medical understanding of the benefits of exercise created a significant expansion in physical culture for girls. Thus by 1902, ''The Girl's Empire'' magazine was able to run a series of articles on \"How to Be Strong\", proclaiming, \"The old-fashioned fallacies regarding health, diet, exercise, dress, &c., have nearly all been exploded, and to-day women are discarding the old ideas and methods, and entering into the new ''r\u00e9gime'' with a zest and vigour which bodes well for the future.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Anonymous|title=How to Be Strong: Special Exercises with the Sandow Grip Dumb-bell|year=1902|publisher=Andrew Melrose Publishing Company|location=London|page=4}}</ref>\n\nGirl's magazines, such as ''[[The Girl's Own Paper]]'' and ''The Girl's Empire'' frequently featured articles encouraging girls to take up daily exercises or learn how to play a sport. Popular sports for girls included [[hockey]], [[golf]], cycling, tennis, fencing, and swimming. Of course, many of these sports were limited to the middle and upper classes who could afford the necessary materials and free time needed to play. Nonetheless, the inclusion of girls in physical culture created a new space for girls to be visible outside of the home and to partake in activities previously only open to boys. Sports became central to the lives of many middle-class girls, to the point where social commentators worried it would overshadow other cultural concerns. For example, a 1902 ''Girl's Own Paper'' article on \"Athletics for Girls\" bewailed, \"To hear some modern schoolgirls, and even modern mothers, talk, one would suppose that hockey was the chief end of all education! The tone of the school\u2014the intellectual training\u2014these come in the second place. Tennis, cricket, but above all, hockey!\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Watson|first=Lily|title=Athleticism for Girls|journal=The Girl's Own Paper|date=25 October 1902|volume=24|page=62}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, older cultural conventions connecting girls to maternity and domesticity continued to influence girls' development. Thus, while girls had more freedom than ever before, much of the physical culture for girls was simultaneously justified in terms of motherhood: athletic, healthy girls would have healthier children, better able to improve the British race. For instance, an early article advising girls to exercise stresses the future role of girls as mothers to vindicate her argument: \"If, then, the importance of duly training the body in conjunction with the mind is thus recognised in the cause of our boys, surely the future wives and mothers of England\u2014for such is our girls' destiny\u2014may lay claim to a no less share of attention in this respect.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Arnold|first=Mrs. Wallace|title=The Physical Education of Girls|journal=The Girl's Own Paper|date=17 May 1884|volume=5|page=516}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:James Tissot - Croquet.jpg|''Croquet'' by [[James Tissot]].

Badminton and tennis were popular occasions for parties, with women playing \"mixed doubles\" alongside male players.\n</gallery>\n\n===Victorian women's fashion===\n{{Further|Victorian fashion}}\nVictorian women's clothing followed trends that emphasised elaborate dresses, skirts with wide volume created by the use of layered material such as [[crinoline]]s, [[hoop skirt]] frames, and heavy fabrics. Because of the impracticality and health impact of the era's fashions, a [[Victorian dress reform|reform movement]] began among women.\n\nThe ideal silhouette of the time demanded a narrow waist, which was accomplished by constricting the abdomen with a laced [[corset]]. While the silhouette was striking, and the dresses themselves were often exquisitely detailed creations, the fashions were cumbersome. At best, they restricted women's movements and at worst, they had a harmful effect on women's health. Physicians turned their attention to the use of corsets and determined that they caused several medical problems: compression of the thorax, restricted breathing, organ displacement, poor circulation, and prolapsed uterus.<ref name=\"O'Connor\"/>\n\nArticles advocating the reform of women's clothing by the British National Health Society, the Ladies' Dress Association, and the Rational Dress Society were reprinted in ''The Canada Lancet'', Canada's medical journal. In 1884, Dr. J. Algernon Temple of Toronto even voiced concern that the fashions were having a negative impact on the health of young women from the working classes. He pointed out that a young working-class woman was likely to spend a large part of her earnings on fine hats and shawls, while \"her feet are improperly protected, and she wears no flannel petticoat or woollen stockings\".<ref name=\"O'Connor\"/>\n\nFlorence Pomeroy, Lady Haberton, was president of the Rational Dress movement in Britain. At a National Health Society exhibition held in 1882, Viscountess Haliburton presented her invention of a \"divided skirt\", which was a long skirt that cleared the ground, with separate halves at the bottom made with material attached to the bottom of the skirt. She hoped that her invention would become popular by supporting women's freedom of physical movement, but the British public was not impressed by the invention, perhaps because of the negative \"unwomanly\" association of the style with the American Bloomers movement.<ref>{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Janet Horowitz|title=Strong-Minded Women and Other Lost Voices from 19th Century England|year=1982|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|isbn=0-394-71044-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/strongmindedwome00jane/page/68 68\u201370]|url=https://archive.org/details/strongmindedwome00jane/page/68}}</ref> [[Amelia Jenks Bloomer]] had encouraged the wearing of visible bloomers by feminists to assert their right to wear comfortable and practical clothing, but it was no more than a passing fashion itself among radical feminists. The movement to reform women's dress would persist and have longterm success, however; by the 1920s, [[Coco Chanel]] was enormously successful at selling a progressive, far less restrictive silhouette that abandoned the corset and raised hemlines. The new silhouette symbolised modernism for trendy young women and became the 20th century standard. Other Paris designers continued reintroducing pants for women and the trend was gradually adopted over the next century.\n\nFashion trends, in one sense, travelled \"full circle\" over the course of the Victorian era. The popular women's styles during the [[Georgian era]], and at the very beginning of Victoria's reign, emphasised a simple style influenced by flowing gowns worn by women in Ancient Greece and Rome. The [[Empire waist]] silhouette was replaced by a trend towards ornate styles and an artificial silhouette, with the restrictiveness of women's clothing reaching its low point during the mid-century passion for narrow corseted waists and hoop skirts. The iconic wide-brimmed women's hats of the later Victorian era also followed the trend towards ostentatious display. Hats began the Victorian era as simple bonnets. By the 1880s, milliners were tested by the competition among women to top their outfits with the most creative (and extravagant) hats, designed with expensive materials such as silk flowers and exotic plumes such as ostrich and peacock. As the Victorian era drew to a close, however, fashions were showing indications of a popular backlash against excessive styles. Model, actress and socialite [[Lillie Langtry]] took London by storm in the 1870s, attracting notice for wearing simple black dresses to social events. Combined with her natural beauty, the style appeared dramatic. Fashions followed her example (as well as Queen Victoria's wearing of mourning black later in her reign). According to [[Harold Koda]], the former Curator-in-chief of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute,<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2014/death-becomes-her]</ref> \"The predominantly black palette of mourning dramatizes the evolution of period silhouettes and the increasing absorption of fashion ideals into this most codified of etiquettes,\" said Koda, \"The veiled widow could elicit sympathy as well as predatory male advances. As a woman of sexual experience without marital constraints, she was often imagined as a potential threat to the social order.\"\n\n====Evolution of Victorian women's fashion====\n<gallery>\nFile:Princess Victoria and Dash by George Hayter.jpg|''Princess Victoria and Dash'' by [[George Hayter]] (1833).

The influence of British imperialism and British culture was powerful throughout the Victorian era. Women's roles in the colonial countries were determined by the expectations associated with loyalty to the Crown and the cultural standards that it symbolised.\n\n===Canada===\n{{see also|History of Canadian women}}\nThe upper classes of Canada were almost without exception of British origin during the Victorian era. At the beginning of the Victorian era, British North America included several separate colonies that joined together as a Confederation in 1867 to create Canada. Military and government officials and their families came to British North America from England or Scotland, and less often were of Protestant Irish origin. Most business interests were controlled by Canadians who were of British stock. English-speaking minorities who immigrated to Canada struggled for economic and government influence, including large numbers of Roman Catholic [[Irish Canadian|Irish]] and later [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukrainians]], [[Polish Canadians|Poles]], and other European immigrants. [[French-Canadians]] remained largely culturally isolated from English-speaking Canadians (a situation later described in ''[[Two Solitudes (novel)|Two Solitudes]]'' by [[Hugh MacLennan]]). Visible minority groups, such as indigenous [[First Nations]] and [[Chinese Canadian|Chinese]] labourers, were marginalised and suffered profound discrimination. Women's status was thus heavily dependent upon their ethnic identity as well as their place within the dominant British class structure.\n\nEnglish-speaking Canadian writers became popular, especially [[Catharine Parr Traill]] and her sister [[Susanna Moodie]], middle-class English settlers who published memoirs of their demanding lives as pioneers. Traill published ''The Backwoods of Canada'' (1836) and ''[[Canadian Crusoes]]'' (1852), and Moodie published ''[[Roughing it in the Bush]]'' (1852) and ''Life in the Clearings'' (1853). Their memoirs recount the harshness of life as women settlers, but were nonetheless popular.<ref>Marian Fowler,  '' The Embroidered Tent: Five Gentlewomen in Early Canada: Elizabeth Simcoe, Catharine Parr Traill, Susanna Moodie, Anna Jameson, Lady Dufferin'' (House Of Anansi, 1982).</ref>\n\nUpper-class Canadian women emulated British culture and imported as much of it as possible across the Atlantic. Books, magazines, popular music, and theatre productions were all imported to meet women's consumer demand.\n\nUpper-class women supported philanthropic causes similar to the educational and nursing charities championed by upper-class women in England. The [[Victorian Order of Nurses]], still in existence, was founded in 1897 as a gift to [[Queen Victoria]] to commemorate her [[Diamond Jubilee]]. The [[Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire]], founded in 1900, supports educational bursaries and book awards to promote [[Canadian patriotism]], but also to support knowledge of the [[British Empire]]. Both organisations had Queen Victoria as their official patron.  One of the patrons of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]]'s Victoria School of Art and Design (founded in 1887 and later named the [[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design]]) was [[Anna Leonowens]]. Women began making headway in their struggle to gain access to higher education: in 1875, the first woman university graduate in Canada was [[Grace Annie Lockhart]] ([[Mount Allison University]]). In 1880, [[Emily Stowe]] became the first woman licensed to practice medicine in Canada.\n\nWomen's legal rights made slow progress throughout the 19th century. In 1859, [[Upper Canada]] passed a law allowing married women to own property. In 1885, Alberta passed a law allowing unmarried women who owned property gained the right to vote and hold office in school matters.\n\nWomen's suffrage would not be achieved until the World War I period. Suffrage activism began during the later decades of the Victorian era. In 1883, the [[Toronto Women's Literary and Social Progress Club]] met and established the [[Canadian Women's Suffrage Association]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[The Edwardian Country House]]\n*[[Women in early modern Scotland]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|last=Goodwin|first=Harvey |authorlink=Harvey Goodwin|title=[[s:An address to women (Goodwin)|An address to women]]|year=1885|publisher=Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge|location=London}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist |2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Adams, James Eli, ed.

Legal recognition of nobility has been more common in monarchies, but nobility also existed in such regimes as the [[Dutch Republic]] (1581\u20131795), the [[Republic of Genoa]] (1005\u20131815), the [[Republic of Venice]] (697\u20131797), and the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] (1300\u20131798), and remains part of the legal social structure of some non-hereditary regimes, e.g., [[San Marino]], and the [[Vatican City]] in Europe.\n\n[[Hereditary title]]s and [[Style (manner of address)|styles]] added to names (such as \"Prince\" or \"Lord\" or \"Lady\"), as well as [[honorific]]s often distinguish nobles from non-nobles in conversation and written speech. In many nations most of the nobility have been un-titled, and some hereditary titles do not indicate nobility (e.g., [[vidame]]).

(Compare the entrenched position and [[leadership]] expectations of the nobility of the Kingdom of [[Tonga]].)\n\nNobility is a historical, social and often legal notion, differing from high [[social status|socio-economic status]] in that the latter is mainly based on income, possessions or [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]. Being wealthy or influential cannot ''[[ipso facto]]'' make one noble, nor are all nobles wealthy or influential (aristocratic families have lost their fortunes in various ways, and the concept of the 'poor nobleman' is almost as old as nobility itself).\n\nVarious republics, including former [[Iron Curtain]] countries, Greece, [[Mexican nobility|Mexico]], and Austria have expressly abolished the conferral and use of titles of nobility for their citizens. This is distinct from countries which have not abolished the right to inherit titles, but which do not grant legal recognition or protection to them, such as Germany and Italy, although Germany recognizes their use as part of the legal surname. Still other countries and authorities allow their use, but forbid attachment of any privilege thereto, e.g., Finland, Norway and the European Union,{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} while French law also protects lawful titles against [[usurpation]].\n\nAlthough many societies have a privileged [[upper class]] with substantial wealth and power, the status is not necessarily hereditary and does not entail a distinct [[legal status]], nor differentiated [[style (manner of address)|forms of address]].\n\n==Noble privileges==\n[[File:Troisordres.jpg|thumb|A French political cartoon of the three orders of [[Social class|feudal society]] (1789). The rural third estate carries the clergy and the nobility.]]\n\nNot all of the benefits of nobility derived from noble status ''per se''. Usually privileges were granted or recognised by the [[monarch]] in association with possession of a specific title, office or estate. Most nobles' wealth derived from one or more [[estate (land)|estates]], large or small, that might include fields, pasture, orchards, timberland, hunting grounds, streams, etc. It also included infrastructure such as castle, well and mill to which local peasants were allowed some access, although often at a price. Nobles were expected to live \"nobly\", that is, from the proceeds of these possessions. Work involving [[manual labour]] or subordination to those of lower rank (with specific exceptions, such as in military or ecclesiastic service) was either forbidden (as derogation from noble status) or frowned upon socially. On the other hand, membership in the nobility was usually a prerequisite for holding offices of trust in the realm and for career promotion, especially in the military, at court and often the higher functions in the government, judiciary and church.\n\nPrior to the [[French Revolution]], European nobles typically commanded tribute in the form of entitlement to cash rents or usage taxes, labour or a portion of the annual crop yield from [[commoner]]s or nobles of lower rank who lived or worked on the noble's [[Manorialism|manor]] or within his ''[[feudalism|seigneurial]]'' domain. In some countries, the local lord could impose restrictions on such a commoner's movements, religion or legal undertakings. Nobles exclusively enjoyed the privilege of [[hunting]]. In France, nobles were exempt from paying the ''[[taille]]'', the major direct tax. Peasants were not only bound to the nobility by dues and services, but the exercise of their rights was often also subject to the [[jurisdiction]] of courts and police from whose authority the actions of nobles were entirely or partially exempt. In some parts of Europe the right of [[private war]] long remained the privilege of every noble.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Nobility |volume=19 |page=728}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early Renaissance, [[duel]]ling established the status of a respectable [[gentry|gentleman]], and was an accepted manner of resolving disputes.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Jonathan |first=Dewald |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-fct5tlRFwEC&pg=PA117&dq#v=onepage |title=The European nobility, 1400-1800 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-521-42528-X |page=117}}</ref>\n\nSince the end of World War I the hereditary nobility entitled to [[special rights]] has largely been abolished in the [[Western World]] as intrinsically [[discrimination|discriminatory]], and discredited as inferior in efficiency to individual [[meritocracy]] in the allocation of societal resources.<ref name=\"pine\">{{Cite book |last=Pine |first=L.G. |url=https://archive.org/details/titleshowkingbec0000pine/page/77 |title=Titles: How the King became His Highness |publisher=Barnes & Noble Books |year=1992 |isbn=978-1-56619-085-5 |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/titleshowkingbec0000pine/page/77 77] |author-link=L.G.

By the 21st century even that deference had become increasingly minimised.\n\n==Ennoblement==\n[[File:Hungarian troops in 18th century.jpg|thumb|Hungarian [[hussar]] troops set up by the Hungarian nobility, during the [[Austro\u2013Turkish War (1787\u20131791)|Austro\u2013Turkish War]] of 1787\u20131791.]]\n\nIn France, a ''seigneurie'' (lordship) might include one or more manors surrounded by land and villages subject to a noble's prerogatives and disposition. ''Seigneuries'' could be bought, sold or mortgaged. If erected by the crown into, e.g., a barony or countship, it became legally [[entail]]ed for a specific family, which could use it as their title. Yet most French nobles were untitled (\"seigneur of Montagne\" simply meant ownership of that lordship but not, if one was not otherwise noble, the right to use a title of nobility, as commoners often purchased lordships). Only a member of the nobility who owned a countship was allowed, ''ipso facto'', to style himself as its ''comte'', although this restriction came to be increasingly ignored as the ''[[ancien r\u00e9gime]]'' drew to its close.\n\nIn other parts of Europe, sovereign rulers arrogated to themselves the exclusive prerogative to act as ''[[fount of honor|fons honorum]]'' within their realms. For example, in the United Kingdom royal [[letters patent]] are necessary to obtain a title of the [[peerage]], which also carries nobility and formerly a seat in the [[House of Lords]], but never came without automatic [[entail]] of land nor rights to the local peasants' output.\n\n==Rank within the nobility==\n[[File:Polish magnates 1576-1586.PNG|thumb|left|[[Polish magnates]] 1576\u20131586]]\n[[File:Polish magnates 1697-1795.PNG|thumb|left|[[Polish magnates]] 1697\u20131795]]\n\n{{Main|Royal and noble ranks}}\nNobility might be either inherited or conferred by a ''[[fount of honour|fons honorum]]''. It is usually an acknowledged preeminence that is hereditary, i.e. the status descends exclusively to some or all of the [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimate]], and usually [[patrilineality|male-line]], descendants of a nobleman. In this respect, the nobility as a class has always been much more extensive than the [[primogeniture]]-based [[title of nobility|titled nobility]], which included [[peerage of France|peerages in France]] and [[peerage of the United Kingdom|in the United Kingdom]], ''[[grandee|grandezas]]'' in Portugal and Spain, and some noble titles in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Prussia and Scandinavia. In Russia, Scandinavia and non-Prussian Germany, titles usually descended to all male-line descendants of the original titleholder, including females. In Spain, noble titles are now equally heritable by females and males. Noble estates, on the other hand, gradually came to descend by [[primogeniture]] in much of western Europe aside from Germany. In Eastern Europe, by contrast, with the exception of a few [[Hungary|Hungarian]] estates, they usually descended to all sons or even all children.<ref>[http://www.palgrave.com/PDFs/140393374X.Pdf The consolidation of Noble Power in Europe, c. 1600\u20131800]</ref>\n\nIn France, some wealthy ''[[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]'', most particularly the members of the various ''[[parlement]]s'', were ennobled by the king, constituting the ''[[nobles of the Robe|noblesse de robe]]''. The old nobility of [[landed gentry|landed]] or [[chivalry|knightly]] origin, the ''[[nobles of the Sword|noblesse d'\u00e9p\u00e9e]]'', increasingly resented the influence and pretensions of this ''[[parvenu]]'' nobility. In the last years of the ''[[ancien r\u00e9gime]]'' the old nobility pushed for restrictions of certain offices and [[chivalric order|orders of chivalry]] to noblemen who could demonstrate that their lineage had extended \"[[quartering (heraldry)|quartering]]s\", i.e. several generations of noble ancestry, to be eligible for offices and favors at [[court (royal)|court]] along with nobles of [[medieval]] descent, although historians such as [[William Doyle (historian)|William Doyle]] have disputed this so-called \"Aristocratic Reaction\".<ref>W. Doyle, ''Essays on Eighteenth Century France'', London, 1995</ref> Various court and military positions were reserved by tradition for nobles who could \"prove\" an ancestry of at least ''seize quartiers'' (16 quarterings), indicating exclusively noble descent (as displayed, ideally, in the family's [[coat of arms]]) extending back five generations (all 16 great-great grandparents).\n[[File:Esterh\u00e1zy M.jpg|thumb|Hungarian count [[Nikolaus, Count Esterh\u00e1zy|Nicholaus Eszterh\u00e1zy of Gal\u00e1ntha]] (1583\u20131645)]]\n\nThis illustrates the traditional link in many countries between [[heraldry]] and nobility; in those countries where heraldry is used, nobles have almost always been [[gentry|armigerous]], and have used heraldry to demonstrate their ancestry and [[family history]]. However, heraldry has never been restricted to the noble classes in most countries, and being armigerous does not necessarily demonstrate nobility. [[Scotland]], however, is an exception.<ref>An opinion of [[Innes of Learney]] differentiates the system in use in Scotland from many other European traditions, in that armorial bearings which are entered in the Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland by warrant of the [[Lord Lyon]] [[King of Arms]] are legally \"Ensigns of Nobility\", and although the historical accuracy of that interpretation has been [http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/lordlyon.htm challenged], Innes of Learney's perspective is accepted in the ''[[Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia]]'' entry, 'Heraldry' (Volume 11), 3, The Law of Arms. 1613.

European ranks of nobility lower than [[baron]] or its equivalent, are commonly referred to as the [[petty nobility]], although [[baronet]]s of the British Isles are deemed titled [[gentry]]. Most nations traditionally had an untitled lower nobility in addition to titled nobles.

In Scandinavia, the [[Benelux]] nations and Spain there are still untitled as well as titled families recognised in law as noble.\n\nIn Hungary members of the nobility always theoretically enjoyed the same rights. In practice, however, a noble family's financial assets largely defined its significance. Medieval Hungary's concept of nobility originated in the notion that nobles were \"free men\", eligible to own land.<ref>\u00d6lyvedi Vad Imre. (1930) Nemess\u00e9gi k\u00f6nyv. Koroknay-Nyomda. Szeged, Hungary. 45p.</ref> This basic standard explains why the noble population was relatively large, although the economic status of its members varied widely. Untitled nobles were not infrequently wealthier than titled families, while considerable differences in wealth were also to be found within the titled nobility. The custom of granting titles was introduced to Hungary in the 16th century by the [[House of Habsburg]]. Historically, once nobility was granted, if a nobleman served the monarch well he might obtain the title of baron, and might later be elevated to the rank of count. As in other countries of post-medieval central Europe, hereditary titles were not attached to a particular land or estate but to the noble family itself, so that all patrilineal descendants shared a title of baron or count (cf. [[peerage]]). Neither nobility nor titles could be transmitted through women.<ref>\u00d6lyvedi Vad Imre. (1930) Nemess\u00e9gi k\u00f6nyv. Koroknay-Nyomda.

The idiom originates from ancient and medieval societies of Europe and distinguishes an [[upper class]] (whose [[superficial vein]]s appeared blue through their untanned skin) from a [[working class]] of the time. The latter consisted mainly of agricultural peasants who spent most of their time working outdoors and thus had tanned skin, through which superficial veins appear less prominently.\n\n[[Robert Lacey]] explains the genesis of the blue blood concept:<blockquote>\nIt was the Spaniards who gave the world the notion that an aristocrat's blood is not red but blue. The Spanish nobility started taking shape around the ninth century in classic military fashion, occupying land as warriors on horseback. They were to continue the process for more than five hundred years, clawing back sections of the peninsula from its Moorish occupiers, and a nobleman demonstrated his pedigree by holding up his sword arm to display the filigree of blue-blooded veins beneath his pale skin\u2014proof that his birth had not been contaminated by the dark-skinned enemy.<ref>Robert Lacey, ''Aristocrats.''

Large numbers of English nobility perished in the [[Wars of the Roses]]]]\n\nThis was coupled with a loss of the socio-economic power of the nobility, owing to the economic changes of the [[Renaissance]] and the growing economic importance of the merchant classes, which increased still further during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. In countries where the nobility was the dominant class, the ''bourgeoisie'' gradually grew in power; a rich city merchant came to be more influential than a nobleman, and the latter sometimes sought inter-marriage with families of the former to maintain their noble lifestyles.\n\nHowever, in many countries at this time, the nobility retained substantial political importance and social influence: for instance, the United Kingdom's government was dominated by the (unusually small) nobility until the middle of the 19th century. Thereafter the powers of the nobility were progressively reduced by legislation. However, until 1999, all [[hereditary peer]]s were entitled to sit and vote in the [[House of Lords]].

The titles of the junior princes were gradually lowered in rank by each generation while the senior heir continued to inherit their father's titles.\n\nIt was a custom in China for the new dynasty to ennoble and enfeoff a member of the dynasty which they overthrew with a title of nobility and a fief of land so that they could offer sacrifices to their ancestors, in addition to members of other preceding dynasties.\n\nChina had a feudal system in the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou dynasties]], which gradually gave way to a more bureaucratic one beginning in the [[Qin dynasty]] (221 BC). This continued through the [[Song dynasty]], and by its peak power shifted from nobility to bureaucrats.\n\nThis development was gradual and generally only completed in full by the Song dynasty. In the [[Han dynasty]], for example, even though noble titles were no longer given to those other than the Emperor's relatives, the fact that the process of selecting officials was mostly based on a vouching system by current officials as officials usually vouched for their own sons or those of other officials meant that a de facto aristocracy continued to exist. This process was further deepened during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period with the introduction of the [[Nine-rank system]].\n\nBy the [[Sui dynasty]], however, the institution of the [[Imperial examination]] system marked the transformation of a power shift towards a full bureaucracy, though the process would not be truly completed until the Song dynasty.\n\nTitles of nobility became symbolic along with a stipend while governance of the country shifted to scholar officials.\n\nIn the [[Qing dynasty]] titles of nobility were still granted by the emperor, but served merely as honorifics based on a loose system of favors to the Qing emperor.\n\nUnder a centralized system, the empire's governance was the responsibility of the Confucian-educated scholar-officials and the local gentry, while the [[Scholar-official|literati]] were accorded gentry status. For male citizens, advancement in status was possible via garnering the top three positions in imperial examinations.\n\nThe Qing appointed the Ming imperial descendants to the title of [[Marquis of Extended Grace]].\n\nThe oldest held continuous noble title in Chinese history was that held by the descendants of [[Confucius]], as [[Duke Yansheng]], which was renamed as the Sacrificial Official to Confucius in 1935 by the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]]. The title is held by [[Kung Tsui-chang]]. There is also a \"Sacrificial Official to Mencius\" for a descendant of [[Mencius]], a \"Sacrificial Official to Zengzi\" for a descendant of [[Zengzi]], and a \"Sacrificial Official to Yan Hui\" for a descendant of [[Yan Hui]].\n\nThe bestowal of titles was abolished upon the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, as part of a larger effort to remove feudal influences and practises from Chinese society.\n\n===Islamic world===\nIn some Islamic countries, there are no definite noble titles (titles of hereditary rulers being distinct from those of hereditary intermediaries between monarchs and commoners). Persons who can trace legitimate descent from [[Muhammad]] or the clans of [[Quraysh]], as can members of several present or formerly reigning dynasties, are widely regarded as belonging to the ancient, hereditary Islamic nobility. In some Islamic countries they inherit (through mother or father) hereditary titles, although without any other associated privilege, e.g., variations of the title ''[[Sayyid]]'' and ''[[Sharif]]''. Regarded as more religious than the general population, many people turn to them for clarification or guidance in religious matters.\n\nIn [[Iran]], historical titles of the nobility including ''[[Mirza]]'', ''[[Khan (title)|Khan]]'', ''[[ed-Dowleh]]'' and ''Shahzada'' (\"Son of a Shah), are now no longer recognised. An aristocratic family is now recognised by their [[family name]], often derived from the post held by their ancestors, considering the fact that family names in Iran only appeared in the beginning of the 20th century.\nSultans have been an integral part of Islamic history .\n\nDuring the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the Imperial Court and the provinces there were many [[List of Ottoman titles and appellations|Ottoman titles and appellations]] forming a somewhat unusual and complex system in comparison with the other Islamic countries. The bestowal of noble and aristocratic titles was widespread across the empire even after its fall by independent monarchs. One of the most elaborate examples is that of the Egyptian aristocracy's largest clan, the [[Abaza family]].\n\n===Japan===\n[[File:\uff33\uff41\uff4d\uff55\uff52\uff41\uff49.jpg|thumb|Japanese samurai, 1798]]\n\nMedieval Japan developed a feudal system similar to the European system, where land was held in exchange for military service. The ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' class, or hereditary landowning nobles, held great socio-political power. As in Europe, they commanded private armies made up of ''[[samurai]]'', an elite [[Edo society#Samurai|warrior class]]; for long periods, these held the real power without a real [[central government]], and often plunged the country into a state of civil war. The ''daimy\u014d'' class can be compared to European peers, and the samurai to European knights, but important differences exist.\n\nFeudal title and rank were abolished during the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, and was replaced by the ''[[kazoku]]'', a five-rank [[peerage]] system after the British example, which granted seats in the upper house of the [[Imperial Diet (Japan)|Imperial Diet]]; this ended in 1947 following Japan's defeat in World War II.\n\n===Philippines===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| width =120\n| image1 =Visayans_3.png\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 =\n| image2 =Visayans_4.png\n| alt2 =\n| caption2 =\n| image3 =Native of Visayan origin.jpg\n| alt3 =\n| caption3 =\n| image4 =Naturales 4.png\n| alt4 =\n| caption4 =\n| footer ='''Left to right''': Images from the [[Boxer Codex]] illustrating ancient Filipino nobility wearing the distinctive colours of their social status: ['''1'''] a [[Visayans|Visayan]] noble couple; ['''2'''] a [[Visayans|Visayan]] [[Royal family|royal]] couple dressed in colours distinctive of their class (gold or [[Imperial yellow jacket|imperial yellow]], red and blue), which are also used by royalty in Asia;  ['''3'''] a native [[princess]]; and ['''4'''] a [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] royal and his [[wikt:consort|consort]].\n| footer_align = left\n}}\nLike other Southeast Asian countries, many regions in the [[Philippines]] have indigenous nobility, partially influenced by Hindu, Chinese, and Islamic custom. Since ancient times, ''[[Datu]]'' was the common title of a chief or monarch of the many [[History of the Philippines (900\u20131521)|pre-colonial]] principalities and sovereign dominions throughout the isles; in some areas the term ''Apo'' was also used.<ref>[http://www.subicbaypi.com/sub_stories_olongapostory.htm The Olongapo Story], July 28, 1953 \u2013 Bamboo Breeze \u2013 Vol.6, No.3</ref> With the titles ''[[Sultan]]'' and ''[[Rajah]]'', ''Datu'' (and its [[Malay language|Malay]] [[cognate]], ''Datok'') are currently used in some parts of the Philippines, [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Brunei]]. These titles are the rough equivalents of European titles, albeit dependent on the actual wealth and prestige of the bearer.\n\n====Recognition by the Spanish Crown====\n\nUpon the [[History of the Philippines#Spanish settlement during the 16th and 17th centuries|islands' Christianisation]], the datus retained governance of their territories despite annexation to the [[Spanish Empire]]. In a law signed 11 June 1594,<ref>\"It is not right that the Indian chiefs of Filipinas be in a worse condition after conversion; rather they should have such treatment that would gain their affection and keep them loyal, so that with the spiritual blessings that God has communicated to them by calling them to His true knowledge, the temporal blessings may be added and they may live contentedly and comfortably. Therefore, we order the governors of those islands to show them good treatment and entrust them, in our name, with the government of the Indians, of whom they were formerly lords. In all else the governors shall see that the chiefs are benefited justly, and the Indians shall pay them something as a recognition, as they did during the period of their paganism, provided it be without prejudice to the tributes that are to be paid us, or prejudicial to that which pertains to their encomenderos.\" Felipe II, ''Ley de Junio 11, 1594'' in ''Recapilaci\u00f3n de leyes'', lib. vi, tit.

It can be seen very clearly and irrefutably that, during the colonial period, indigenous chiefs were equated with the [[Hidalgo (nobility)|Spanish Hidalgos]], and the most resounding proof of the application of this comparison is the General Military Archive in [[Segovia]], where the qualifications of \"Nobility\" (found in the Service Records) are attributed to those Filipinos who were admitted to the Spanish Military Academies and whose ancestors were [[cacique]]s, [[encomendero]]s, notable Tagalogs, chieftains,  [[Gobernadorcillo|governors]] or those  who held positions in the municipal administration or government in all different regions of the large islands of the Archipelago, or of the many small islands of which it is composed.<ref>''Por ella se aprecia bien claramente y de manera fehaciente que a los caciques ind\u00edgenas se les equiparada a los Hidalgos espa\u00f1oles y la prueba m\u00e1s rotunda de su aplicaci\u00f3n se halla en el Archivo General Militar de Segovia, en donde las calificaciones de \u00abNobleza\u00bb se encuentran en las Hojas de Servicio de aquellos filipinos que ingresaron en nuestras Academias Militares y cuyos ascendientes eran caciques, encomenderos, tagalos notables, ped\u00e1neos, por los gobernadores o que ocupan cargos en la Administraci\u00f3n municipal o en la del Gobierno, de todas las diferentes regiones de las grandes islas del Archipi\u00e9lago o en las m\u00faltiples islas peque\u00f1as de que se compone el mismo.''

Many of them accepted the Catholic religion and were his allies from the very beginning. He only demanded from these local rulers [[Vassal state|vassalage]] to the Spanish Crown,<ref>FERRANDO, Fr Juan & FONSECA OSA, Fr Joaquin (1870\u20131872). ''Historia de los PP.

Other independent [[polity|polities]] which were not vassals to other States, e.g., [[Madja-as|Confederation of Madja-as]] and the [[Rajahnate of Cebu]], were more of [[Protectorate]]s/[[Suzerainty|Suzerainties]] having had alliances with the Spanish Crown before the Kingdom took total control of most parts of the Archipelago. An interesting question remains after the cessession of the Spanish rule in the Philippines, that is, what is the equivalent of the rank of the [[Filipinos|Filipino]] [[Principal\u00eda]], freed from vassalage yet not able to exercise their sovereignty within the democratic society in the Archipelago?\n\nOne logical conclusion would be the reassumption of their ancestral Royal and noble [[Royal and noble ranks|title]] as [[Datu]]s while retaining the [[Hidalgo (nobility)|Hidalgu\u00eda]] of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] (their former protector State), as a [[subsidiary title]], appears most suitable to the hispanized Filipino nobles. Besides, as stated in the above-mentioned Royal Decree of Charles II, the ancient nobility of the Filipino Principales ''\"is still retained and acknowledged\"''.\n\nJust like the deposed royal families elsewhere in the world, which still lay claim to their hereditary rights as [[pretender]]s to the former thrones of their ancestors, the descendants of the [[Principal\u00eda]] have the same [[de iure]] claims to the historical domains of their forebears.\n\n{{See also2|[[Lakan]] of the island of Luzon}}\n\n==Africa==\nAfrica has a plethora of ancient lineages in its various constituent nations. Some, such as the numerous ''[[sharif]]ian'' families of North Africa, the [[Keita dynasty]] of [[Mali]], the [[Solomonic dynasty]] of [[Ethiopia]], the [[Francisco Felix de Sousa|De Souza]] family of [[Benin]] and the [[Sherbro Tuckers|Sherbro Tucker]] clan of [[Sierra Leone]], claim descent from notables from outside of the continent. Most, such as those composed of the descendants of [[Shaka]] and [[Moshoeshoe I|Moshoeshoe]] of [[Southern Africa]], belong to peoples that have been resident in the continent for millennia. Generally their royal or noble status is recognized by and derived from the authority of traditional custom. A number of them also enjoy either a constitutional or a statutory recognition of their high social positions.\n\n===Ethiopia===\n[[File:Haile Selassie and group.jpg|thumb|Emperor [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia]] (center) and members of the imperial court]]\n[[Ethiopia]] has a [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|nobility]] that is almost as old as the country itself. Throughout the history of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] most of the titles of nobility have been tribal or military in nature. However the Ethiopian nobility resembled its European counterparts in some respects;  until 1855, when [[Tewodros II]] ended the ''[[Zemene Mesafint]]'' its aristocracy was organised similarly to the feudal system in Europe during the Middle Ages. For more than seven centuries, Ethiopia (or [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]], as it was then known) was made up of many small kingdoms, principalities, emirates and [[imam]]ates, which owed their allegiance to the ''n\u0259gus\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st'' (literally \"King of Kings\"). Despite its being a Christian monarchy, various Muslim states paid tribute to the emperors of Ethiopia for centuries: including the [[Adal Sultanate]], the [[Emirate of Harar]], and the [[Awsa sultanate]].\n\nEthiopian nobility were divided into two different categories: ''Mesafint'' (\"prince\"), the hereditary nobility that formed the upper echelon of the ruling class; and the ''Mekwanin'' (\"governor\") who were appointed nobles, often of humble birth, who formed the bulk of the nobility (''[[cf.]]'' the ''[[Ministerialis]]'' of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]). In  Ethiopia there were titles of nobility among the ''Mesafint'' borne by those at the apex of medieval Ethiopian society. The highest royal title (after that of emperor) was ''[[Negus]]'' (\"king\") which was held by hereditary governors of the provinces of [[Begemder]], [[Shewa]], [[Gojjam]], and [[Wollo]]. The next highest seven titles were ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles#Men's honorifics|Ras]]'', ''[[Dejazmach]]'', ''Fit'awrari'', ''[[Grazmach]]'', ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles#Qenyazmach|Qenyazmach]]'', ''[[Azmach]]'' and ''[[Balambaras]]''. The title of ''Le'ul Ras'' was accorded to the heads of various noble families and [[cadet branch]]es of the [[Solomonic dynasty]], such as the princes of Gojjam, Tigray, and Selalle. The heirs of the ''Le'ul Rases'' were titled ''Le'ul Dejazmach'', indicative of the higher status they enjoyed relative to ''Dejazmaches'' who were not of the blood imperial. There were various [[hereditary title]]s in Ethiopia: including that of ''[[Jantirar]]'', reserved for males of the family of Empress [[Menen Asfaw]] who ruled over the mountain fortress of [[Ambassel]] in Wollo; ''[[Wagshum]]'', a title created for the descendants of the deposed [[Zagwe dynasty]]; and ''Shum Agame'', held by the descendants of ''Dejazmach'' [[Sabagadis]], who ruled over the [[Agame]] district of Tigray. The  vast majority of titles borne by nobles were not, however, hereditary.\n\nDespite being largely dominated by Christian elements, some Muslims obtained ''entr\u00e9e'' into the Ethiopian nobility as part of their quest for aggrandizement during the 1800s. To do so they were generally obliged to abandon their faith and some are believed to have feigned conversion to Christianity for the sake of acceptance by the old Christian aristocratic families. One such family, the Wara Seh (more commonly called the \"Yejju dynasty\") converted to Christianity and eventually wielded power for over a century, ruling with the sanction of the Solomonic emperors. The last such Muslim noble to join the ranks of Ethiopian society was [[Mikael of Wollo]] who converted, was made ''Negus'' of Wollo, and later King of Zion, and even married into the Imperial family. He lived to see his son, [[Iyasu V]], inherit the throne in 1913\u2014only to be deposed in 1916 because of his conversion to Islam.\n\n===Madagascar===\n[[File:Radama I, portrait by Ramanankirahina.jpg|thumb|King [[Radama I of Madagascar]] was from the Andriana stratum of the [[Merina people]].]]\n\nThe nobility in [[Madagascar]] are known as the ''[[Andriana]]''. In much of Madagascar, before French colonization of the island, the [[Malagasy people]] were organised into a rigid social caste system, within which the ''Andriana'' exercised both spiritual and political leadership. The word \"Andriana\" has been used to denote nobility in various ethnicities in Madagascar: including  the ''[[Merina]]'', the ''[[Betsileo]]'', the ''[[Betsimisaraka people|Betsimisaraka]]'', the ''[[Tsimihety]]'', the ''[[Bezanozano]]'', the ''[[Antambahoaka]]'' and the ''[[Antemoro]]''.\n\nThe word ''Andriana'' has often formed part of the names of Malagasy kings, princes and nobles. Linguistic evidence suggests that the origin of the title ''Andriana'' is traceable back to an ancient [[Javanese language|Javanese]] title of nobility. Before the colonization by France in the 1890s, the ''Andriana'' held various privileges, including land ownership, preferment for senior government posts, free labor from members of lower classes, the right to have their tombs constructed within town limits, etc. The ''Andriana'' rarely married outside their caste: a high-ranking woman who married a lower-ranking man took on her husband's lower rank, but a high-ranking man marrying a woman of lower rank did not forfeit his status, although his children could not inherit his rank or property (''[[cf.]]'' [[morganatic marriage]]).\n\nIn 2011, the Council of Kings and Princes of Madagascar endorsed the revival of a Christian ''Andriana'' monarchy that would blend modernity and tradition.\n\n===Nigeria===\n[[File:Emir of Kano on his throne 092016.jpg|thumb|The [[Kano Emirate Council|Emir of Kano]], [[Sanusi Lamido Sanusi|Muhammadu Sanusi II]], on his throne in 2016]]\nContemporary [[Nigeria]] has a [[Nigerian Chieftaincy|class of traditional notables]] which is led by its reigning monarchs, the [[Nigerian traditional rulers]]. Though their functions are largely ceremonial, the titles of the country's noblemen and women are often centuries old and are usually vested in the membership of historically prominent families in the various [[List of Nigerian traditional states|subnational kingdoms of the country]].\n\nMembership of initiatory societies that have inalienable functions within the kingdoms is also a common feature of Nigerian nobility, particularly among the southern tribes, where such figures as the ''[[Ogboni]]'' of the ''[[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]'', the ''[[Nze na Ozo]]'' of the ''[[Igbo people|Igbo]]'' and the ''[[Ekpe]]'' of the ''[[Efik people|Efik]]'' are some of the most famous examples. Although many of their traditional functions have become dormant due to the advent of modern governance, their members retain precedence of a traditional nature and are especially prominent during festivals.\n\nOutside of this, many of the traditional nobles of Nigeria continue to serve as [[privy counsellor]]s and [[viceroy]]s in the service of their traditional sovereigns in a symbolic continuation of the way that their titled ancestors and predecessors did during the pre-colonial and colonial periods. Many of them are also members of the country's [[political elite]] due to their not being covered by the prohibition from involvement in politics that governs the activities of the traditional rulers.\n\nHolding a [[chieftaincy]] title, either of the [[traditional]] variety (which involves taking part in ritual re-enactments of your title's history during annual festivals, roughly akin to a British [[peerage]]) or the honorary variety (which does not involve the said re-enactments, roughly akin to a [[knighthood]]), grants an individual the right to use the word \"chief\" as a pre-nominal [[honorific]] while in Nigeria.\n\n== Latin America==\nIn addition to a variety of indigenous peoples (such as the ''[[Aymara people|Aymara]]'' and the ''[[Quechua people|Quechua]]'', who have long traditions of being led by monarchs and nobles called ''[[Apu Mallku]]s'' and ''[[Mallku]]s''), aristocratic connections exist among a number of other groups. Peerage traditions dating to the colonial period of such countries as [[Brazilian nobility|Brazil]], [[Cuban nobility|Cuba]] and [[Mexican nobility|Mexico]] have left noble families in each of them that have ancestral ties to those nations' native tribes, while such figures as the [[Afro-Bolivian monarchy|Afro-Bolivian king]] and the [[high priestess]] of the ''[[Ile Maroia Laji]]'' sect of Brazilian ''[[Candombl\u00e9]]'' trace their ancestries to and derive their prestige from ancient monarchs and nobles of the pre-colonial African continent.\n\n=== Bolivia ===\n[[File:AfrobolivanQueen.jpg|thumb|Ang\u00e9lica Larrea, Queen Consort of the [[Afro-Bolivians]], in 2012.

When Brazil became a [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|united kingdom with Portugal]] in 1815, the first [[Brazilian nobility|Brazilian titles of nobility]] were granted by the King of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves.\n\nWith the independence of Brazil in 1822 as a constitutional monarchy, the titles of nobility initiated by the King of Portugal were continued and new titles of nobility were created by the [[Emperor of Brazil]]. However, according to the [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazilian Constitution of 1824]], the Emperor conferred titles of nobility, which were personal and therefore non-hereditary, unlike the earlier Portuguese and Portuguese-Brazilian titles, being inherited exclusively to the royal titles of the [[Brazilian Imperial Family]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nDuring the existence of the [[Empire of Brazil]], 1,211 noble titles were acknowledged. {{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} With the proclamation of the [[First Brazilian Republic]], in 1889, the Brazilian nobility was extinguished. It was also prohibited, under penalty of accusation of [[high treason]] and the suspension of political rights, to accept noble titles and foreign decorations without the proper permission of the State. In particular, the nobles of greater distinction, by respect and tradition, were allowed to use their titles during the republican regime. The Imperial Family also could not return to the Brazilian soil until 1921, when the Banishment Law was repealed.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Nobility by nation==\n[[File:KITLV 408096 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Regent of Bandung with his pajoeng bearer - 1863-1865.jpg|thumb|Regent of [[Bandung]], Java, [[Dutch East Indies]], with his pajung bearer \u2013 1863\u20131865]]\n[[File:KITLV 6553 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Sons of Crown Prince Krom Loeang of Siam, Bangkok - 1862.tif|thumb|Sons of Crown Prince [[Wongsa Dhiraj Snid|Krom Loeang of Siam]], Bangkok, 1862]]\n[[File:A Siamese noble on hammock.png|thumb|A [[Siam]]ese noble in a hammock, 1900]]\n\nA list of noble titles for different European countries can be found at [[Royal and noble ranks]].\n\n{{For|the proper address of holders of these titles|Royal and noble title styles}}\n{{For|the English Wikipedia category|:Category:Nobility by nation}}\n\n===Africa===\n* [[Botswanan chieftaincy]]\n** [[Kgosi]]\n* [[Ganwa|Burundian nobility]]\n* [[Sahib-ul-Ma'ali|Egyptian nobility]]\n* [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|Ethiopian nobility]]\n* [[Ghanaian chieftaincy]]\n** [[Akan chieftaincy]]\n* [[Andriana|Malagasy nobility]]\n* [[Gbara|Malian nobility]]\n* [[Nigerian Chieftaincy|Nigerian chieftaincy]]\n** [[Nigerian traditional rulers]]\n*** [[Lamido]]\n****[[Hakim (title)|Hakimi]]\n*** [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]]\n****[[Ogboni]]\n*** [[Eze]]\n****[[Nze na Ozo]]\n* [[Abiru|Rwandan nobility]]\n* [[Somali aristocratic and court titles|Somali nobility]]\n* [[Zimbabwean chieftaincy]]\n\n===America===\n* [[Canadian peers and baronets]]\n* [[Brazilian nobility]]\n* [[Cuban nobility]]\n* [[Mexican nobility]]\n** [[Pipiltin]]\n* In the United States, establishment of a nobility is prohibited by the [[Title of Nobility Clause]] of the country's [[Constitution of the United States|constitution]].

Nobility possesses more acknowledged [[Privilege (law)|privileges]] and higher [[social status]] than most other classes in society.  The privileges associated with nobility may constitute substantial advantages over or relative to non-nobles, or may be largely honorary (e.g., [[order of precedence|precedence]]), and vary by country and era. As referred to in the Medieval [[chivalry|chivalric]] motto ''[[noblesse oblige]]'' (\"nobility obliges\"), nobles can also carry a lifelong duty to uphold various social responsibilities, such as honorable behavior, customary service,{{clarify|date=March 2019}} or leadership positions. Membership in the nobility, including rights and responsibilities, is typically [[hereditary]].\n\nMembership in the nobility has historically been granted by a monarch or government, unlike other social classes where membership is determined solely by wealth, lifestyle, or affiliation.{{clarify|date=March 2019}}<!-- what is meant by \"affiliation\"?--> Nonetheless, acquisition of sufficient power, wealth, military prowess, or royal favour has occasionally enabled commoners to ascend into the nobility.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.vogue.com/article/royals-who-married-commoners-kate-middleton-prince-william |title=Move Over, Kate Middleton: These Commoners All Married Royals, Too |work=Vogue |access-date=2018-10-24 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThere are often a variety of ranks within the noble class. Legal recognition of nobility has been more common in monarchies, but nobility also existed in such regimes as the [[Dutch Republic]] (1581\u20131795), the [[Republic of Genoa]] (1005\u20131815), the [[Republic of Venice]] (697\u20131797), and the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] (1300\u20131798), and remains part of the legal social structure of some non-hereditary regimes, e.g., [[San Marino]], and the [[Vatican City]] in Europe.\n\n[[Hereditary title]]s and [[Style (manner of address)|styles]] added to names (such as \"Prince\" or \"Lord\" or \"Lady\"), as well as [[honorific]]s often distinguish nobles from non-nobles in conversation and written speech. In many nations most of the nobility have been un-titled, and some hereditary titles do not indicate nobility (e.g., [[vidame]]).  Some countries have had non-hereditary nobility, such as the [[Brazilian nobility|Empire of Brazil]] or [[life peer]]s in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Crusader cavalry.jpg|thumb|left|Nobility offered protection in exchange for service]]\n[[File:Le bal par\u00e9.jpg|thumb|left|French aristocrats, c. 1774]]\n\nThe term derives from Latin ''nobilitas'', the [[abstract noun]] of the adjective ''nobilis'' (\"well-known, famous, notable\").<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Oliver |first=Revilo P. |author-link=Revilo P.

(Compare the entrenched position and [[leadership]] expectations of the nobility of the Kingdom of [[Tonga]].)\n\nNobility is a historical, social and often legal notion, differing from high [[social status|socio-economic status]] in that the latter is mainly based on income, possessions or [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]. Being wealthy or influential cannot ''[[ipso facto]]'' make one noble, nor are all nobles wealthy or influential (aristocratic families have lost their fortunes in various ways, and the concept of the 'poor nobleman' is almost as old as nobility itself).\n\nVarious republics, including former [[Iron Curtain]] countries, Greece, [[Mexican nobility|Mexico]], and Austria have expressly abolished the conferral and use of titles of nobility for their citizens. This is distinct from countries which have not abolished the right to inherit titles, but which do not grant legal recognition or protection to them, such as Germany and Italy, although Germany recognizes their use as part of the legal surname. Still other countries and authorities allow their use, but forbid attachment of any privilege thereto, e.g., Finland, Norway and the European Union,{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} while French law also protects lawful titles against [[usurpation]].\n\nAlthough many societies have a privileged [[upper class]] with substantial wealth and power, the status is not necessarily hereditary and does not entail a distinct [[legal status]], nor differentiated [[style (manner of address)|forms of address]].\n\n==Noble privileges==\n[[File:Troisordres.jpg|thumb|A French political cartoon of the three orders of [[Social class|feudal society]] (1789). The rural third estate carries the clergy and the nobility.]]\n\nNot all of the benefits of nobility derived from noble status ''per se''. Usually privileges were granted or recognised by the [[monarch]] in association with possession of a specific title, office or estate. Most nobles' wealth derived from one or more [[estate (land)|estates]], large or small, that might include fields, pasture, orchards, timberland, hunting grounds, streams, etc. It also included infrastructure such as castle, well and mill to which local peasants were allowed some access, although often at a price. Nobles were expected to live \"nobly\", that is, from the proceeds of these possessions. Work involving [[manual labour]] or subordination to those of lower rank (with specific exceptions, such as in military or ecclesiastic service) was either forbidden (as derogation from noble status) or frowned upon socially. On the other hand, membership in the nobility was usually a prerequisite for holding offices of trust in the realm and for career promotion, especially in the military, at court and often the higher functions in the government, judiciary and church.\n\nPrior to the [[French Revolution]], European nobles typically commanded tribute in the form of entitlement to cash rents or usage taxes, labour or a portion of the annual crop yield from [[commoner]]s or nobles of lower rank who lived or worked on the noble's [[Manorialism|manor]] or within his ''[[feudalism|seigneurial]]'' domain. In some countries, the local lord could impose restrictions on such a commoner's movements, religion or legal undertakings. Nobles exclusively enjoyed the privilege of [[hunting]]. In France, nobles were exempt from paying the ''[[taille]]'', the major direct tax. Peasants were not only bound to the nobility by dues and services, but the exercise of their rights was often also subject to the [[jurisdiction]] of courts and police from whose authority the actions of nobles were entirely or partially exempt. In some parts of Europe the right of [[private war]] long remained the privilege of every noble.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Nobility |volume=19 |page=728}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early Renaissance, [[duel]]ling established the status of a respectable [[gentry|gentleman]], and was an accepted manner of resolving disputes.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Jonathan |first=Dewald |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-fct5tlRFwEC&pg=PA117&dq#v=onepage |title=The European nobility, 1400-1800 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-521-42528-X |page=117}}</ref>\n\nSince the end of World War I the hereditary nobility entitled to [[special rights]] has largely been abolished in the [[Western World]] as intrinsically [[discrimination|discriminatory]], and discredited as inferior in efficiency to individual [[meritocracy]] in the allocation of societal resources.<ref name=\"pine\">{{Cite book |last=Pine |first=L.G. |url=https://archive.org/details/titleshowkingbec0000pine/page/77 |title=Titles: How the King became His Highness |publisher=Barnes & Noble Books |year=1992 |isbn=978-1-56619-085-5 |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/titleshowkingbec0000pine/page/77 77] |author-link=L.G.

By the 21st century even that deference had become increasingly minimised.\n\n==Ennoblement==\n[[File:Hungarian troops in 18th century.jpg|thumb|Hungarian [[hussar]] troops set up by the Hungarian nobility, during the [[Austro\u2013Turkish War (1787\u20131791)|Austro\u2013Turkish War]] of 1787\u20131791.]]\n\nIn France, a ''seigneurie'' (lordship) might include one or more manors surrounded by land and villages subject to a noble's prerogatives and disposition. ''Seigneuries'' could be bought, sold or mortgaged. If erected by the crown into, e.g., a barony or countship, it became legally [[entail]]ed for a specific family, which could use it as their title. Yet most French nobles were untitled (\"seigneur of Montagne\" simply meant ownership of that lordship but not, if one was not otherwise noble, the right to use a title of nobility, as commoners often purchased lordships). Only a member of the nobility who owned a countship was allowed, ''ipso facto'', to style himself as its ''comte'', although this restriction came to be increasingly ignored as the ''[[ancien r\u00e9gime]]'' drew to its close.\n\nIn other parts of Europe, sovereign rulers arrogated to themselves the exclusive prerogative to act as ''[[fount of honor|fons honorum]]'' within their realms.

In this respect, the nobility as a class has always been much more extensive than the [[primogeniture]]-based [[title of nobility|titled nobility]], which included [[peerage of France|peerages in France]] and [[peerage of the United Kingdom|in the United Kingdom]], ''[[grandee|grandezas]]'' in Portugal and Spain, and some noble titles in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Prussia and Scandinavia. In Russia, Scandinavia and non-Prussian Germany, titles usually descended to all male-line descendants of the original titleholder, including females. In Spain, noble titles are now equally heritable by females and males. Noble estates, on the other hand, gradually came to descend by [[primogeniture]] in much of western Europe aside from Germany. In Eastern Europe, by contrast, with the exception of a few [[Hungary|Hungarian]] estates, they usually descended to all sons or even all children.<ref>[http://www.palgrave.com/PDFs/140393374X.Pdf The consolidation of Noble Power in Europe, c. 1600\u20131800]</ref>\n\nIn France, some wealthy ''[[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]'', most particularly the members of the various ''[[parlement]]s'', were ennobled by the king, constituting the ''[[nobles of the Robe|noblesse de robe]]''. The old nobility of [[landed gentry|landed]] or [[chivalry|knightly]] origin, the ''[[nobles of the Sword|noblesse d'\u00e9p\u00e9e]]'', increasingly resented the influence and pretensions of this ''[[parvenu]]'' nobility. In the last years of the ''[[ancien r\u00e9gime]]'' the old nobility pushed for restrictions of certain offices and [[chivalric order|orders of chivalry]] to noblemen who could demonstrate that their lineage had extended \"[[quartering (heraldry)|quartering]]s\", i.e. several generations of noble ancestry, to be eligible for offices and favors at [[court (royal)|court]] along with nobles of [[medieval]] descent, although historians such as [[William Doyle (historian)|William Doyle]] have disputed this so-called \"Aristocratic Reaction\".<ref>W. Doyle, ''Essays on Eighteenth Century France'', London, 1995</ref> Various court and military positions were reserved by tradition for nobles who could \"prove\" an ancestry of at least ''seize quartiers'' (16 quarterings), indicating exclusively noble descent (as displayed, ideally, in the family's [[coat of arms]]) extending back five generations (all 16 great-great grandparents).\n[[File:Esterh\u00e1zy M.jpg|thumb|Hungarian count [[Nikolaus, Count Esterh\u00e1zy|Nicholaus Eszterh\u00e1zy of Gal\u00e1ntha]] (1583\u20131645)]]\n\nThis illustrates the traditional link in many countries between [[heraldry]] and nobility; in those countries where heraldry is used, nobles have almost always been [[gentry|armigerous]], and have used heraldry to demonstrate their ancestry and [[family history]]. However, heraldry has never been restricted to the noble classes in most countries, and being armigerous does not necessarily demonstrate nobility. [[Scotland]], however, is an exception.<ref>An opinion of [[Innes of Learney]] differentiates the system in use in Scotland from many other European traditions, in that armorial bearings which are entered in the Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland by warrant of the [[Lord Lyon]] [[King of Arms]] are legally \"Ensigns of Nobility\", and although the historical accuracy of that interpretation has been [http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/lordlyon.htm challenged], Innes of Learney's perspective is accepted in the ''[[Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia]]'' entry, 'Heraldry' (Volume 11), 3, The Law of Arms. 1613. The nature of arms.</ref> In a number of recent cases in Scotland the Lord Lyon King of Arms has controversially (vis-\u00e0-vis Scotland's Salic law) granted the arms and allocated the chiefships of medieval noble families to female-line descendants of lords, even when they were not of noble lineage in the male line, while persons of legitimate male-line descent may still survive (e.g. the modern [[Chiefs of Clan MacLeod]]).\n\nIn some nations, [[hereditary title]]s, as distinct from noble rank, were not always recognised in law, e.g., Poland's ''[[Szlachta]]''. European ranks of nobility lower than [[baron]] or its equivalent, are commonly referred to as the [[petty nobility]], although [[baronet]]s of the British Isles are deemed titled [[gentry]]. Most nations traditionally had an untitled lower nobility in addition to titled nobles. An example is the [[landed gentry]] of the [[British Isles]].<ref name=\"lawrence\">{{Cite book |last=Larence |first=Sir James Henry |url=https://books.google.com/?id=k04RAQAAIAAJ |title=The nobility of the British Gentry or the political ranks and dignities of the British Empire compared with those on the continent |publisher=T.Hookham -- Simpkin and Marshall |year=1827 |edition=2nd |location=London |access-date=2013-01-06 |orig-year=first published 1824}}</ref><ref>Ruling of the Court of the Lord Lyon (26/2/1948, Vol. IV, page 26): \"With regard to the words 'untitled nobility' employed in certain recent birthbrieves in relation to the (Minor) Baronage of Scotland, Finds and Declares that the (Minor) Barons of Scotland are, and have been both in this nobiliary Court and in the Court of Session recognised as a \u2018titled nobility\u2019 and that the estait of the Baronage (i.e., ''Barones Minores'') are of the ancient Feudal Nobility of Scotland\".

In Scandinavia, the [[Benelux]] nations and Spain there are still untitled as well as titled families recognised in law as noble.\n\nIn Hungary members of the nobility always theoretically enjoyed the same rights. In practice, however, a noble family's financial assets largely defined its significance. Medieval Hungary's concept of nobility originated in the notion that nobles were \"free men\", eligible to own land.<ref>\u00d6lyvedi Vad Imre. (1930) Nemess\u00e9gi k\u00f6nyv. Koroknay-Nyomda. Szeged, Hungary. 45p.</ref> This basic standard explains why the noble population was relatively large, although the economic status of its members varied widely. Untitled nobles were not infrequently wealthier than titled families, while considerable differences in wealth were also to be found within the titled nobility. The custom of granting titles was introduced to Hungary in the 16th century by the [[House of Habsburg]]. Historically, once nobility was granted, if a nobleman served the monarch well he might obtain the title of baron, and might later be elevated to the rank of count. As in other countries of post-medieval central Europe, hereditary titles were not attached to a particular land or estate but to the noble family itself, so that all patrilineal descendants shared a title of baron or count (cf. [[peerage]]). Neither nobility nor titles could be transmitted through women.<ref>\u00d6lyvedi Vad Imre. (1930) Nemess\u00e9gi k\u00f6nyv. Koroknay-Nyomda.

The idiom originates from ancient and medieval societies of Europe and distinguishes an [[upper class]] (whose [[superficial vein]]s appeared blue through their untanned skin) from a [[working class]] of the time. The latter consisted mainly of agricultural peasants who spent most of their time working outdoors and thus had tanned skin, through which superficial veins appear less prominently.\n\n[[Robert Lacey]] explains the genesis of the blue blood concept:<blockquote>\nIt was the Spaniards who gave the world the notion that an aristocrat's blood is not red but blue. The Spanish nobility started taking shape around the ninth century in classic military fashion, occupying land as warriors on horseback. They were to continue the process for more than five hundred years, clawing back sections of the peninsula from its Moorish occupiers, and a nobleman demonstrated his pedigree by holding up his sword arm to display the filigree of blue-blooded veins beneath his pale skin\u2014proof that his birth had not been contaminated by the dark-skinned enemy.<ref>Robert Lacey, ''Aristocrats.''

Fayard, Paris 1998, {{ISBN|2-213-02148-1}}.</ref> Originally, [[knight]]s or nobles were mounted  [[warrior]]s who swore allegiance to their sovereign and promised to fight for him in exchange for an allocation of land (usually together with [[serf]]s living thereon). During the period known as the [[Military Revolution]], nobles gradually lost their role in raising and commanding private armies, as many nations created cohesive national armies.\n[[File:MS Ghent - Battle of Tewkesbury.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] in 1471. Large numbers of English nobility perished in the [[Wars of the Roses]]]]\n\nThis was coupled with a loss of the socio-economic power of the nobility, owing to the economic changes of the [[Renaissance]] and the growing economic importance of the merchant classes, which increased still further during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. In countries where the nobility was the dominant class, the ''bourgeoisie'' gradually grew in power; a rich city merchant came to be more influential than a nobleman, and the latter sometimes sought inter-marriage with families of the former to maintain their noble lifestyles.\n\nHowever, in many countries at this time, the nobility retained substantial political importance and social influence: for instance, the United Kingdom's government was dominated by the (unusually small) nobility until the middle of the 19th century. Thereafter the powers of the nobility were progressively reduced by legislation. However, until 1999, all [[hereditary peer]]s were entitled to sit and vote in the [[House of Lords]]. Since then, only 92 of them have this entitlement, of whom 90 are elected by the hereditary peers as a whole to [[Representative peer|represent the peerage]].\n\nThe countries with the highest proportion of nobles were [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] (probably 10%),{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (15% of an 18th-century population of 800,000),{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} Spain (722,000 in 1768 which was 7\u20138% of the entire population){{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} and other countries with lower percentages, such as Russia in 1760 with 500,000\u2013600,000 nobles (2\u20133% of the entire population), and pre-revolutionary [[Kingdom of France|France]] where there were no more than 300,000 prior to 1789,{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} which was 1% of the population (although some scholars believe this figure is an overestimate).

Hence, many nobles in the subcontinent had royal titles of Raja, Rai, Rana, Rao, etc. In Nepal, '''''Kaji''''' ({{lang-ne|\u0915\u093e\u091c\u0940}}) was a title and position used by nobility of [[Gorkha Kingdom]] (1559\u20131768) and [[Kingdom of Nepal]] between 1768\u20131804.\n\nOther noble and aristocratic titles were Thakur, Sardar, Dewan, Pradhan, Kaji etc.\n\n{{for|the historical hierarchy of the Indian subcontinent|princely state}}\n\n===China===\nIn [[East Asia]] the system was often modelled on imperial China, the leading culture. Emperors conferred [[Chinese nobility|titles of nobility]]. Imperial descendants formed the highest class of ancient Chinese nobility, their status based upon the rank of the empress or concubine from which they descend maternally (as emperors were polygamous). Numerous titles such as ''Taizi'' (crown prince), and equivalents of \"prince\" were accorded, and due to complexities in [[dynasty#Dynasts|dynastic]] rules, [[house law|rules]] were introduced for Imperial descendants. The titles of the junior princes were gradually lowered in rank by each generation while the senior heir continued to inherit their father's titles.\n\nIt was a custom in China for the new dynasty to ennoble and enfeoff a member of the dynasty which they overthrew with a title of nobility and a fief of land so that they could offer sacrifices to their ancestors, in addition to members of other preceding dynasties.\n\nChina had a feudal system in the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou dynasties]], which gradually gave way to a more bureaucratic one beginning in the [[Qin dynasty]] (221 BC). This continued through the [[Song dynasty]], and by its peak power shifted from nobility to bureaucrats.\n\nThis development was gradual and generally only completed in full by the Song dynasty. In the [[Han dynasty]], for example, even though noble titles were no longer given to those other than the Emperor's relatives, the fact that the process of selecting officials was mostly based on a vouching system by current officials as officials usually vouched for their own sons or those of other officials meant that a de facto aristocracy continued to exist. This process was further deepened during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period with the introduction of the [[Nine-rank system]].\n\nBy the [[Sui dynasty]], however, the institution of the [[Imperial examination]] system marked the transformation of a power shift towards a full bureaucracy, though the process would not be truly completed until the Song dynasty.\n\nTitles of nobility became symbolic along with a stipend while governance of the country shifted to scholar officials.\n\nIn the [[Qing dynasty]] titles of nobility were still granted by the emperor, but served merely as honorifics based on a loose system of favors to the Qing emperor.\n\nUnder a centralized system, the empire's governance was the responsibility of the Confucian-educated scholar-officials and the local gentry, while the [[Scholar-official|literati]] were accorded gentry status. For male citizens, advancement in status was possible via garnering the top three positions in imperial examinations.\n\nThe Qing appointed the Ming imperial descendants to the title of [[Marquis of Extended Grace]].\n\nThe oldest held continuous noble title in Chinese history was that held by the descendants of [[Confucius]], as [[Duke Yansheng]], which was renamed as the Sacrificial Official to Confucius in 1935 by the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]]. The title is held by [[Kung Tsui-chang]]. There is also a \"Sacrificial Official to Mencius\" for a descendant of [[Mencius]], a \"Sacrificial Official to Zengzi\" for a descendant of [[Zengzi]], and a \"Sacrificial Official to Yan Hui\" for a descendant of [[Yan Hui]].\n\nThe bestowal of titles was abolished upon the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, as part of a larger effort to remove feudal influences and practises from Chinese society.\n\n===Islamic world===\nIn some Islamic countries, there are no definite noble titles (titles of hereditary rulers being distinct from those of hereditary intermediaries between monarchs and commoners). Persons who can trace legitimate descent from [[Muhammad]] or the clans of [[Quraysh]], as can members of several present or formerly reigning dynasties, are widely regarded as belonging to the ancient, hereditary Islamic nobility. In some Islamic countries they inherit (through mother or father) hereditary titles, although without any other associated privilege, e.g., variations of the title ''[[Sayyid]]'' and ''[[Sharif]]''. Regarded as more religious than the general population, many people turn to them for clarification or guidance in religious matters.\n\nIn [[Iran]], historical titles of the nobility including ''[[Mirza]]'', ''[[Khan (title)|Khan]]'', ''[[ed-Dowleh]]'' and ''Shahzada'' (\"Son of a Shah), are now no longer recognised. An aristocratic family is now recognised by their [[family name]], often derived from the post held by their ancestors, considering the fact that family names in Iran only appeared in the beginning of the 20th century.\nSultans have been an integral part of Islamic history .\n\nDuring the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the Imperial Court and the provinces there were many [[List of Ottoman titles and appellations|Ottoman titles and appellations]] forming a somewhat unusual and complex system in comparison with the other Islamic countries. The bestowal of noble and aristocratic titles was widespread across the empire even after its fall by independent monarchs. One of the most elaborate examples is that of the Egyptian aristocracy's largest clan, the [[Abaza family]].\n\n===Japan===\n[[File:\uff33\uff41\uff4d\uff55\uff52\uff41\uff49.jpg|thumb|Japanese samurai, 1798]]\n\nMedieval Japan developed a feudal system similar to the European system, where land was held in exchange for military service. The ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' class, or hereditary landowning nobles, held great socio-political power. As in Europe, they commanded private armies made up of ''[[samurai]]'', an elite [[Edo society#Samurai|warrior class]]; for long periods, these held the real power without a real [[central government]], and often plunged the country into a state of civil war. The ''daimy\u014d'' class can be compared to European peers, and the samurai to European knights, but important differences exist.\n\nFeudal title and rank were abolished during the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, and was replaced by the ''[[kazoku]]'', a five-rank [[peerage]] system after the British example, which granted seats in the upper house of the [[Imperial Diet (Japan)|Imperial Diet]]; this ended in 1947 following Japan's defeat in World War II.\n\n===Philippines===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| width =120\n| image1 =Visayans_3.png\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 =\n| image2 =Visayans_4.png\n| alt2 =\n| caption2 =\n| image3 =Native of Visayan origin.jpg\n| alt3 =\n| caption3 =\n| image4 =Naturales 4.png\n| alt4 =\n| caption4 =\n| footer ='''Left to right''': Images from the [[Boxer Codex]] illustrating ancient Filipino nobility wearing the distinctive colours of their social status: ['''1'''] a [[Visayans|Visayan]] noble couple; ['''2'''] a [[Visayans|Visayan]] [[Royal family|royal]] couple dressed in colours distinctive of their class (gold or [[Imperial yellow jacket|imperial yellow]], red and blue), which are also used by royalty in Asia;  ['''3'''] a native [[princess]]; and ['''4'''] a [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] royal and his [[wikt:consort|consort]].\n| footer_align = left\n}}\nLike other Southeast Asian countries, many regions in the [[Philippines]] have indigenous nobility, partially influenced by Hindu, Chinese, and Islamic custom.

These titles are the rough equivalents of European titles, albeit dependent on the actual wealth and prestige of the bearer.\n\n====Recognition by the Spanish Crown====\n\nUpon the [[History of the Philippines#Spanish settlement during the 16th and 17th centuries|islands' Christianisation]], the datus retained governance of their territories despite annexation to the [[Spanish Empire]].

It can be seen very clearly and irrefutably that, during the colonial period, indigenous chiefs were equated with the [[Hidalgo (nobility)|Spanish Hidalgos]], and the most resounding proof of the application of this comparison is the General Military Archive in [[Segovia]], where the qualifications of \"Nobility\" (found in the Service Records) are attributed to those Filipinos who were admitted to the Spanish Military Academies and whose ancestors were [[cacique]]s, [[encomendero]]s, notable Tagalogs, chieftains,  [[Gobernadorcillo|governors]] or those  who held positions in the municipal administration or government in all different regions of the large islands of the Archipelago, or of the many small islands of which it is composed.<ref>''Por ella se aprecia bien claramente y de manera fehaciente que a los caciques ind\u00edgenas se les equiparada a los Hidalgos espa\u00f1oles y la prueba m\u00e1s rotunda de su aplicaci\u00f3n se halla en el Archivo General Militar de Segovia, en donde las calificaciones de \u00abNobleza\u00bb se encuentran en las Hojas de Servicio de aquellos filipinos que ingresaron en nuestras Academias Militares y cuyos ascendientes eran caciques, encomenderos, tagalos notables, ped\u00e1neos, por los gobernadores o que ocupan cargos en la Administraci\u00f3n municipal o en la del Gobierno, de todas las diferentes regiones de las grandes islas del Archipi\u00e9lago o en las m\u00faltiples islas peque\u00f1as de que se compone el mismo.''

The colonial officials were under obligation to show them the honor corresponding to their respective duties.

Many of them accepted the Catholic religion and were his allies from the very beginning. He only demanded from these local rulers [[Vassal state|vassalage]] to the Spanish Crown,<ref>FERRANDO, Fr Juan & FONSECA OSA, Fr Joaquin (1870\u20131872). ''Historia de los PP. Dominicos en las Islas Filipinas y en las Misiones del Japon, China, Tung-kin y Formosa'' (Vol. 1 of 6 vols) (in Spanish). Madrid: Imprenta y esteriotipia de M Rivadeneyra, p. 146</ref> replacing the similar [[Mandala (political model)|overlordship]], which previously existed in a few cases, e.g., [[Sultanate of Brunei]]'s overlordship of the [[Kingdom of Maynila]]. Other independent [[polity|polities]] which were not vassals to other States, e.g., [[Madja-as|Confederation of Madja-as]] and the [[Rajahnate of Cebu]], were more of [[Protectorate]]s/[[Suzerainty|Suzerainties]] having had alliances with the Spanish Crown before the Kingdom took total control of most parts of the Archipelago. An interesting question remains after the cessession of the Spanish rule in the Philippines, that is, what is the equivalent of the rank of the [[Filipinos|Filipino]] [[Principal\u00eda]], freed from vassalage yet not able to exercise their sovereignty within the democratic society in the Archipelago?\n\nOne logical conclusion would be the reassumption of their ancestral Royal and noble [[Royal and noble ranks|title]] as [[Datu]]s while retaining the [[Hidalgo (nobility)|Hidalgu\u00eda]] of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] (their former protector State), as a [[subsidiary title]], appears most suitable to the hispanized Filipino nobles. Besides, as stated in the above-mentioned Royal Decree of Charles II, the ancient nobility of the Filipino Principales ''\"is still retained and acknowledged\"''.\n\nJust like the deposed royal families elsewhere in the world, which still lay claim to their hereditary rights as [[pretender]]s to the former thrones of their ancestors, the descendants of the [[Principal\u00eda]] have the same [[de iure]] claims to the historical domains of their forebears.\n\n{{See also2|[[Lakan]] of the island of Luzon}}\n\n==Africa==\nAfrica has a plethora of ancient lineages in its various constituent nations. Some, such as the numerous ''[[sharif]]ian'' families of North Africa, the [[Keita dynasty]] of [[Mali]], the [[Solomonic dynasty]] of [[Ethiopia]], the [[Francisco Felix de Sousa|De Souza]] family of [[Benin]] and the [[Sherbro Tuckers|Sherbro Tucker]] clan of [[Sierra Leone]], claim descent from notables from outside of the continent. Most, such as those composed of the descendants of [[Shaka]] and [[Moshoeshoe I|Moshoeshoe]] of [[Southern Africa]], belong to peoples that have been resident in the continent for millennia. Generally their royal or noble status is recognized by and derived from the authority of traditional custom. A number of them also enjoy either a constitutional or a statutory recognition of their high social positions.\n\n===Ethiopia===\n[[File:Haile Selassie and group.jpg|thumb|Emperor [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia]] (center) and members of the imperial court]]\n[[Ethiopia]] has a [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|nobility]] that is almost as old as the country itself. Throughout the history of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] most of the titles of nobility have been tribal or military in nature. However the Ethiopian nobility resembled its European counterparts in some respects;  until 1855, when [[Tewodros II]] ended the ''[[Zemene Mesafint]]'' its aristocracy was organised similarly to the feudal system in Europe during the Middle Ages. For more than seven centuries, Ethiopia (or [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]], as it was then known) was made up of many small kingdoms, principalities, emirates and [[imam]]ates, which owed their allegiance to the ''n\u0259gus\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st'' (literally \"King of Kings\"). Despite its being a Christian monarchy, various Muslim states paid tribute to the emperors of Ethiopia for centuries: including the [[Adal Sultanate]], the [[Emirate of Harar]], and the [[Awsa sultanate]].\n\nEthiopian nobility were divided into two different categories: ''Mesafint'' (\"prince\"), the hereditary nobility that formed the upper echelon of the ruling class; and the ''Mekwanin'' (\"governor\") who were appointed nobles, often of humble birth, who formed the bulk of the nobility (''[[cf.]]'' the ''[[Ministerialis]]'' of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]). In  Ethiopia there were titles of nobility among the ''Mesafint'' borne by those at the apex of medieval Ethiopian society. The highest royal title (after that of emperor) was ''[[Negus]]'' (\"king\") which was held by hereditary governors of the provinces of [[Begemder]], [[Shewa]], [[Gojjam]], and [[Wollo]]. The next highest seven titles were ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles#Men's honorifics|Ras]]'', ''[[Dejazmach]]'', ''Fit'awrari'', ''[[Grazmach]]'', ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles#Qenyazmach|Qenyazmach]]'', ''[[Azmach]]'' and ''[[Balambaras]]''. The title of ''Le'ul Ras'' was accorded to the heads of various noble families and [[cadet branch]]es of the [[Solomonic dynasty]], such as the princes of Gojjam, Tigray, and Selalle. The heirs of the ''Le'ul Rases'' were titled ''Le'ul Dejazmach'', indicative of the higher status they enjoyed relative to ''Dejazmaches'' who were not of the blood imperial. There were various [[hereditary title]]s in Ethiopia: including that of ''[[Jantirar]]'', reserved for males of the family of Empress [[Menen Asfaw]] who ruled over the mountain fortress of [[Ambassel]] in Wollo; ''[[Wagshum]]'', a title created for the descendants of the deposed [[Zagwe dynasty]]; and ''Shum Agame'', held by the descendants of ''Dejazmach'' [[Sabagadis]], who ruled over the [[Agame]] district of Tigray. The  vast majority of titles borne by nobles were not, however, hereditary.\n\nDespite being largely dominated by Christian elements, some Muslims obtained ''entr\u00e9e'' into the Ethiopian nobility as part of their quest for aggrandizement during the 1800s. To do so they were generally obliged to abandon their faith and some are believed to have feigned conversion to Christianity for the sake of acceptance by the old Christian aristocratic families. One such family, the Wara Seh (more commonly called the \"Yejju dynasty\") converted to Christianity and eventually wielded power for over a century, ruling with the sanction of the Solomonic emperors. The last such Muslim noble to join the ranks of Ethiopian society was [[Mikael of Wollo]] who converted, was made ''Negus'' of Wollo, and later King of Zion, and even married into the Imperial family. He lived to see his son, [[Iyasu V]], inherit the throne in 1913\u2014only to be deposed in 1916 because of his conversion to Islam.\n\n===Madagascar===\n[[File:Radama I, portrait by Ramanankirahina.jpg|thumb|King [[Radama I of Madagascar]] was from the Andriana stratum of the [[Merina people]].]]\n\nThe nobility in [[Madagascar]] are known as the ''[[Andriana]]''. In much of Madagascar, before French colonization of the island, the [[Malagasy people]] were organised into a rigid social caste system, within which the ''Andriana'' exercised both spiritual and political leadership. The word \"Andriana\" has been used to denote nobility in various ethnicities in Madagascar: including  the ''[[Merina]]'', the ''[[Betsileo]]'', the ''[[Betsimisaraka people|Betsimisaraka]]'', the ''[[Tsimihety]]'', the ''[[Bezanozano]]'', the ''[[Antambahoaka]]'' and the ''[[Antemoro]]''.\n\nThe word ''Andriana'' has often formed part of the names of Malagasy kings, princes and nobles. Linguistic evidence suggests that the origin of the title ''Andriana'' is traceable back to an ancient [[Javanese language|Javanese]] title of nobility. Before the colonization by France in the 1890s, the ''Andriana'' held various privileges, including land ownership, preferment for senior government posts, free labor from members of lower classes, the right to have their tombs constructed within town limits, etc. The ''Andriana'' rarely married outside their caste: a high-ranking woman who married a lower-ranking man took on her husband's lower rank, but a high-ranking man marrying a woman of lower rank did not forfeit his status, although his children could not inherit his rank or property (''[[cf.]]'' [[morganatic marriage]]).\n\nIn 2011, the Council of Kings and Princes of Madagascar endorsed the revival of a Christian ''Andriana'' monarchy that would blend modernity and tradition.\n\n===Nigeria===\n[[File:Emir of Kano on his throne 092016.jpg|thumb|The [[Kano Emirate Council|Emir of Kano]], [[Sanusi Lamido Sanusi|Muhammadu Sanusi II]], on his throne in 2016]]\nContemporary [[Nigeria]] has a [[Nigerian Chieftaincy|class of traditional notables]] which is led by its reigning monarchs, the [[Nigerian traditional rulers]]. Though their functions are largely ceremonial, the titles of the country's noblemen and women are often centuries old and are usually vested in the membership of historically prominent families in the various [[List of Nigerian traditional states|subnational kingdoms of the country]].\n\nMembership of initiatory societies that have inalienable functions within the kingdoms is also a common feature of Nigerian nobility, particularly among the southern tribes, where such figures as the ''[[Ogboni]]'' of the ''[[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]'', the ''[[Nze na Ozo]]'' of the ''[[Igbo people|Igbo]]'' and the ''[[Ekpe]]'' of the ''[[Efik people|Efik]]'' are some of the most famous examples. Although many of their traditional functions have become dormant due to the advent of modern governance, their members retain precedence of a traditional nature and are especially prominent during festivals.\n\nOutside of this, many of the traditional nobles of Nigeria continue to serve as [[privy counsellor]]s and [[viceroy]]s in the service of their traditional sovereigns in a symbolic continuation of the way that their titled ancestors and predecessors did during the pre-colonial and colonial periods. Many of them are also members of the country's [[political elite]] due to their not being covered by the prohibition from involvement in politics that governs the activities of the traditional rulers.\n\nHolding a [[chieftaincy]] title, either of the [[traditional]] variety (which involves taking part in ritual re-enactments of your title's history during annual festivals, roughly akin to a British [[peerage]]) or the honorary variety (which does not involve the said re-enactments, roughly akin to a [[knighthood]]), grants an individual the right to use the word \"chief\" as a pre-nominal [[honorific]] while in Nigeria.\n\n== Latin America==\nIn addition to a variety of indigenous peoples (such as the ''[[Aymara people|Aymara]]'' and the ''[[Quechua people|Quechua]]'', who have long traditions of being led by monarchs and nobles called ''[[Apu Mallku]]s'' and ''[[Mallku]]s''), aristocratic connections exist among a number of other groups. Peerage traditions dating to the colonial period of such countries as [[Brazilian nobility|Brazil]], [[Cuban nobility|Cuba]] and [[Mexican nobility|Mexico]] have left noble families in each of them that have ancestral ties to those nations' native tribes, while such figures as the [[Afro-Bolivian monarchy|Afro-Bolivian king]] and the [[high priestess]] of the ''[[Ile Maroia Laji]]'' sect of Brazilian ''[[Candombl\u00e9]]'' trace their ancestries to and derive their prestige from ancient monarchs and nobles of the pre-colonial African continent.\n\n=== Bolivia ===\n[[File:AfrobolivanQueen.jpg|thumb|Ang\u00e9lica Larrea, Queen Consort of the [[Afro-Bolivians]], in 2012. The queen is the wife of King [[Julio Pinedo]].]]\nIn addition to the [[Criollo people#Spanish colonial caste system|casta upperclass]] that dates to the era of [[Colonial Bolivia]] and that has ancestral ties to the [[Spanish nobility]], the South American country also has a ceremonial [[monarchy]] that is recognized as part of the [[Plurinational State of Bolivia]] and that is led by a titular ruler that is known as the ''[[Afro-Bolivian monarchy|Afro-Bolivian king]]''. \n\nThe members of the royal house that he belongs to are the direct descendants of an old [[Monarchies_in_Africa#Sub-national_monarchies|African tribal monarchy]] that were brought to Bolivia as slaves. They have provided leadership to the [[Afro-Bolivian community]] ever since that event and have been officially recognized by Bolivia's government since 2007. <ref>[https://elpais.com/cultura/2018/01/19/actualidad/1516326396_507680.html El retorno del rey negro boliviano a sus ra\u00edces africanas - El Pa\u00eds]</ref>\n\n=== Brazil ===\n[[File:Marquis of Parana by Emilio Bauch.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Hon\u00f3rio Hermeto Carneiro Le\u00e3o, Marquis of Paran\u00e1|Marquis of Paran\u00e1]], [[President of the Council of Ministers of Brazil|Prime Minister of Brazil]].]]\n\nThe nobility in Brazil began during the [[Colonial Brazil|colonial era]] with the [[Portuguese nobility]]. When Brazil became a [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|united kingdom with Portugal]] in 1815, the first [[Brazilian nobility|Brazilian titles of nobility]] were granted by the King of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves.\n\nWith the independence of Brazil in 1822 as a constitutional monarchy, the titles of nobility initiated by the King of Portugal were continued and new titles of nobility were created by the [[Emperor of Brazil]]. However, according to the [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazilian Constitution of 1824]], the Emperor conferred titles of nobility, which were personal and therefore non-hereditary, unlike the earlier Portuguese and Portuguese-Brazilian titles, being inherited exclusively to the royal titles of the [[Brazilian Imperial Family]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nDuring the existence of the [[Empire of Brazil]], 1,211 noble titles were acknowledged. {{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} With the proclamation of the [[First Brazilian Republic]], in 1889, the Brazilian nobility was extinguished. It was also prohibited, under penalty of accusation of [[high treason]] and the suspension of political rights, to accept noble titles and foreign decorations without the proper permission of the State. In particular, the nobles of greater distinction, by respect and tradition, were allowed to use their titles during the republican regime.
