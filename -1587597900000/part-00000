It is the second series in the franchise to have nature as its main topic after ''[[Pretty Cure Splash Star]]'', with elements and medicine used for the Cure's main motifs.\n\n==Story==\n13-year old Nodoka Hanadera just recently moved to the town of Sukoyaka with her family in hopes that it can give her a fresh start from her life in the city. Meanwhile, in a place deep inside the Earth known as the \"Healing Garden\", everything is in ruins after an attack from an antagonistic group called the Byougens, whose goal is to infect the garden and slowly poison the planet. Its ruler, Teatine, entrusted the care of her daughter Latte to the \"medical trainee\" Healing Animals: Rabirin, Pegitan and Nyatoran, on a mission to go to the surface world and find three people whose hearts can resonate with their paws and can partner with them. While on Earth, the fairies witness an attack from the Byougens. In a sudden twist of fate, Rabirin meets up with Nodoka who, despite her somewhat frail condition, is determined to protect others. This determination resonated with Rabirin and resulted in Nodoka becoming the Pretty Cure foretold in legend, Cure Grace. Joined in by Chiyu/Cure Fontaine and Hinata/Cure Sparkle, they all form the Healin' Good Pretty Cure team in order to fight against the threat of the Byougens and protect all life on Earth and the Healing Garden.\n\n==Characters==\n===Pretty Cures===\n;{{nihongo|Nodoka Hanadera|\u82b1\u5bfa\u306e\u3069\u304b|Hanadera Nodoka}} / {{nihongo|Cure Grace|\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9|Kyua Gur\u0113su}}<ref name=HPR>{{cite news|date=26 December 2019|url=https://www.cinematoday.jp/news/N0113206|work=Cinematoday|language=Japanese|accessdate=25 December 2019|title=\u300c\u30d2\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3063\u3069\u3000\u30d7\u30ea\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u300d\u58f0\u512a\u306b\u60a0\u6728\u78a7\uff01\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u767a\u8868}}</ref>\n:{{anime voice|[[Aoi Y\u016bki]]}}<ref name=HPR/>\n:A girl who is the pink-colored Pretty Cure of Flowers, her fairy partner is Rabirin<ref name=HPR/> and has moved to Sukoyaka City.

It is the seventeenth season in the ''[[Pretty Cure]]'' franchise, featuring the fifteenth generation of Cures. It is directed by Yoko Ikeda and written by Junko Komura. The series began airing on all [[All-Nippon News Network|ANN]] stations in Japan on February 2, 2020, succeeding ''[[Star Twinkle PreCure]]'' in its initial time slot. It is the second series in the franchise to have nature as its main topic after ''[[Pretty Cure Splash Star]]'', with elements and medicine used for the Cure's main motifs.\n\n==Story==\n13-year old Nodoka Hanadera just recently moved to the town of Sukoyaka with her family in hopes that it can give her a fresh start from her life in the city. Meanwhile, in a place deep inside the Earth known as the \"Healing Garden\", everything is in ruins after an attack from an antagonistic group called the Byougens, whose goal is to infect the garden and slowly poison the planet. Its ruler, Teatine, entrusted the care of her daughter Latte to the \"medical trainee\" Healing Animals: Rabirin, Pegitan and Nyatoran, on a mission to go to the surface world and find three people whose hearts can resonate with their paws and can partner with them. While on Earth, the fairies witness an attack from the Byougens. In a sudden twist of fate, Rabirin meets up with Nodoka who, despite her somewhat frail condition, is determined to protect others. This determination resonated with Rabirin and resulted in Nodoka becoming the Pretty Cure foretold in legend, Cure Grace. Joined in by Chiyu/Cure Fontaine and Hinata/Cure Sparkle, they all form the Healin' Good Pretty Cure team in order to fight against the threat of the Byougens and protect all life on Earth and the Healing Garden.\n\n==Characters==\n===Pretty Cures===\n;{{nihongo|Nodoka Hanadera|\u82b1\u5bfa\u306e\u3069\u304b|Hanadera Nodoka}} / {{nihongo|Cure Grace|\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9|Kyua Gur\u0113su}}<ref name=HPR>{{cite news|date=26 December 2019|url=https://www.cinematoday.jp/news/N0113206|work=Cinematoday|language=Japanese|accessdate=25 December 2019|title=\u300c\u30d2\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3063\u3069\u3000\u30d7\u30ea\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u300d\u58f0\u512a\u306b\u60a0\u6728\u78a7\uff01\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u767a\u8868}}</ref>\n:{{anime voice|[[Aoi Y\u016bki]]}}<ref name=HPR/>\n:A girl who is the pink-colored Pretty Cure of Flowers, her fairy partner is Rabirin<ref name=HPR/> and has moved to Sukoyaka City.

It deals with the alliance between the pirates, samurai, and minks to liberate Wano Country from the shogun, who has allied with the Beast Pirates led by Kaido. Episodes 895 and 896 contain an original story arc, \"Carbonic Acid King\" which ties into the movie ''[[One Piece: Stampede]]''.

The season began broadcasting in Japan on [[Fuji Television]] on July 7, 2019. On April 19, 2020, Toei Animation announced that episode 930 and onward has been delayed until further notice due to the ongoing [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://toei-animation-usa.com/newsAdmin/new-episodes-of-one-piece-digimon-adventure-suspended-due-to-covid-19-84.html|title=NEW EPISODES OF \u201cONE PIECE\u201d & \u201cDIGIMON ADVENTURE:\u201d SUSPENDED DUE TO COVID-19|publisher=Toei Animation Inc.|date=April 19, 2020|accessdate=April 20, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"930 Delay ANN\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-04-19/one-piece-anime-delays-new-episodes-due-to-covid-19/.158758|title= One Piece Anime Delays New Episodes Due to COVID-19|publisher=Anime News Network|date=April 19, 2020|accessdate=April 20, 2020}}</ref> \n\nLike the rest of the series, this season follows the adventures of [[Monkey D. Luffy]] and his Straw Hat Pirates. The main story arc, called \"Wano Country\", adapts material from the rest of the 90th volume onwards. It deals with the alliance between the pirates, samurai, and minks to liberate Wano Country from the shogun, who has allied with the Beast Pirates led by Kaido. Episodes 895 and 896 contain an original story arc, \"Carbonic Acid King\" which ties into the movie ''[[One Piece: Stampede]]''. Episode 907 is an adaptation of Oda's one-shot manga ''Romance Dawn'', which features \"the story of a Luffy slightly different from the one in One Piece\".\n\nThe opening [[theme music]] for this season is {{nihongo|\"Over The Top\"|\u30aa\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u30b6\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7|\u014cb\u0101 Za Toppu}} by [[Hiroshi Kitadani]].\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Episode list==\n===\"Wano Country\"===\n<onlyinclude>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"width:98%; background:#fff;\"\n|- style=\"border-bottom:3px solid #9C3234\"\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| No.<ref group=\"n\" name=\"t-ep\">Episode number by [[Toei Animation]]'s count</ref>\n!

Luffy hands Balloon over to the nearby sorcerer pirate Speil, but gets imprisoned on Spiel's ship after insulting him. Luffy is trapped with Anne, a close friend of Balloon who explains that Spiel is after his magic blood and has kidnapped her as bait.

The actual group on the recordings were known as [[The Ron Hicklin Singers]] featuring [[Tom Bahler]] on lead (he would later go on to pen the classic [[Michael Jackson]] song \"[[She's Out of My Life]]\"), [[John Bahler]], [[Robin Ward (singer)|Jackie Ward]] and Stan Farber. This lineup would record on hundreds of commercials, TV themes and [[The Partridge Family discography|The Partridge Family]] recordings. Bahler's lead vocals are also prominent with the group [[The Love Generation]] who had a few LPs in the late 1960s as well.\n\n==Episodes==\nEach episode contained two shorts featuring the traditional antics and adventures of '''Fred and Barney''' and one short featuring '''Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm''' with their friends Moonrock, Penny, Wiggy, Schleprock, Cindy and Fabian, and the Bronto Bunch (Bronto, Noodles, Stub and Zonk).\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"background:#FFFFFF\"\n! style=\"background:#FFD700; width:20px\"| {{Abbr|N\u00ba|Number}}\n! style=\"background:#FFD700\"| Titles\n! style=\"background:#FFD700; width:135px\"| Air date\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1\n| Title = Birdbrained / Squawkie Talkies / Bedrock 500\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1972|9|9}}\n| ShortSummary =\n* '''Bird Brained:''' Fred has to birdsit Mr. Slate's pet parrot, Claymore, who causes nothing but trouble for the Flintstones and the Rubbles.\n* '''Squawkie Talkies:''' Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm mistakenly believe that Barney is eaten by a Hipposaurus while using Moonrock's \"squawkie talkie\" gadgets.\n* '''Bedrock 500:''' Bamm-Bamm and Moonrock, Pebbles and her girlfriends participate in the Bedrock 500 car race against the Bronto Bunch.\n| LineColor = FFD700\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 2\n| Title = The Flying Fools / Bedlam in Bedrock / The Stone Ranger Rides Again\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1972|9|16}}\n| ShortSummary =\n* '''The Flying Fools:''' Fred and Barney experience a turbulent afternoon while flying in Moonrock's new self-made airplane.\n* '''Bedlam in Bedrock:''' Pebbles and her friends try to help Radio R.O.C.K.

The governing [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] was reelected, going from a minority to a majority government, and gave Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] his third term. The [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]], led by [[Robert Stanfield]], did well in the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic provinces]], and in the [[Western Canada|West]], but the Liberal support in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] ensured a majority Liberal government.\n\n==Overview ==\n\nThe previous election had resulted in the Liberals emerging as the largest party, but far short of a majority, and only two seats ahead of the Progressive Conservatives. They were able to form a government with the support of the [[New Democratic Party]], but the NDP withdrew their backing in May 1974 and voted with the Progressive Conservatives to bring down Trudeau's government in protest of a budget proposed by finance minister [[John Turner]], which the opposition parties felt did not go far enough to control spiralling [[inflation]].\n\nThe issue of inflation would become key in the election campaign. Stanfield had proposed a \"90-day wage and price freeze\" to break the momentum of inflation. Trudeau had ridiculed this policy as an intrusion on the rights of businesses and employees to set or negotiate their own prices and wages with the catch-phrase, \"Zap! You're frozen!\" In 1975, Trudeau introduced his own wage and price control system under the auspices of the \"Anti-Inflation Board\".\n\nWhile polls at the election's outset had projected that the Progressive Conservatives would at least win a minority government, they in fact lost nearly a dozen seats. The Conservative campaign was also hurt by other factors, including Stanfield giving what was considered to be a poor interview immediately after the vote of no confidence in Trudeau's government, in which he could not name any potential Tory policies for the forthcoming election, and then by a bungled photo op later in the campaign when he attempted to play catch with some assembled journalists, only to fumble and drop the football.\n\nThe New Democratic Party, led by [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]], lost less than two-and-a-half percentage points in the popular vote, but lost almost half of their seats in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. It was the worst result in the party's history up until that point, with only their performances in [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993]] and [[2000 Canadian federal election|2000]] to date being worse. They were hurt principally by the collapse of their vote in British Columbia; having won the popular vote and most seats in the province two years prior, the NDP were almost totally wiped out there during this election, losing all but two of their seats and finishing a distant third behind the Liberals and Tories. Their poor showing was blamed primarily on Lewis strongly hinting prior to the election that he would back Stanfield over Trudeau in the event of another minority parliament - which may have caused left-wing voters to vote for the Liberals in order to keep the Tories out of power - and also by an unpopular mineral tax introduced by the provincial British Columbia government of [[Dave Barrett]], which would lead to Barrett's government suffering a landslide loss in the following year's [[1975 British Columbia general election|provincial election]].\n\nThe [[Social Credit Party of Canada]], led by [[R\u00e9al Caouette]], continued to lose ground, and fell to 11 seats, one short of the number required to be recognized as a party in the House of Commons (and therefore qualify for research funds and parliamentary committee memberships). This status was nonetheless extended to the party by the governing Liberals, who believed that Social Credit's support came primarily at the expense of the Tories.\n\nOne seat was won in [[New Brunswick]] by independent candidate [[Leonard Jones]]. Jones, the former mayor of [[Moncton]], had secured the Progressive Conservative nomination, but PC leader Stanfield refused to sign Jones' nomination papers because he was a vocal opponent of [[Official bilingualism in Canada|official bilingualism]], which the PC Party supported.  Jones had opposed providing services in French in the City of Moncton even though 30% of the city's population was [[francophone]]. Jones ran and won as an independent. After the election, Social Credit leader Caouette invited Jones to join the Socred caucus, which would have given that party enough members for official status. Caouette justified the invitation on the basis that Jones agreed with providing bilingual education at the primary school level. Jones declined Caouette's invitation, and sat as an independent.\n\nOf the four major party leaders, only Trudeau would remain in place for the following federal election five years later. Stanfield, having failed to defeat the Liberals in any of his three elections as leader, faced pressure to stand down and eventually did so in 1976, being succeeded by [[Joe Clark]]. Lewis's position was rendered untenable by the loss of his own seat, and he was forced to stand down within a year of the election (though it later transpired that he had intended to retire in 1975 regardless of the election result, as he had secretly been battling [[leukaemia]]); [[Ed Broadbent]] initially replaced him as interim leader, and was subsequently elected to the position permanently. Caouette, who had only been able to play a minimal role in the election due to injuries sustained in a snowmobiling accident, stood down as leader of the Socreds in late 1976 and died not long afterwards; a succession of leaders took charge in the years ahead, ultimately leaving [[Fabien Roy]] as the man who would lead them into the next election.\n\n==National results==\n[[File:Chambre des

The governing [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] was reelected, going from a minority to a majority government, and gave Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] his third term. The [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]], led by [[Robert Stanfield]], did well in the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic provinces]], and in the [[Western Canada|West]], but the Liberal support in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] ensured a majority Liberal government.\n\n==Overview ==\n\nThe previous election had resulted in the Liberals emerging as the largest party, but far short of a majority, and only two seats ahead of the Progressive Conservatives. They were able to form a government with the support of the [[New Democratic Party]], but the NDP withdrew their backing in May 1974 and voted with the Progressive Conservatives to bring down Trudeau's government in protest of a budget proposed by finance minister [[John Turner]], which the opposition parties felt did not go far enough to control spiralling [[inflation]].\n\nThe issue of inflation would become key in the election campaign. Stanfield had proposed a \"90-day wage and price freeze\" to break the momentum of inflation. Trudeau had ridiculed this policy as an intrusion on the rights of businesses and employees to set or negotiate their own prices and wages with the catch-phrase, \"Zap! You're frozen!\" In 1975, Trudeau introduced his own wage and price control system under the auspices of the \"Anti-Inflation Board\".\n\nWhile polls at the election's outset had projected that the Progressive Conservatives would at least win a minority government, they in fact lost nearly a dozen seats. The Conservative campaign was also hurt by other factors, including Stanfield giving what was considered to be a poor interview immediately after the vote of no confidence in Trudeau's government, in which he could not name any potential Tory policies for the forthcoming election, and then by a bungled photo op later in the campaign when he attempted to play catch with some assembled journalists, only to fumble and drop the football.\n\nThe New Democratic Party, led by [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]], lost less than two-and-a-half percentage points in the popular vote, but lost almost half of their seats in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. It was the worst result in the party's history up until that point, with only their performances in [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993]] and [[2000 Canadian federal election|2000]] to date being worse. They were hurt principally by the collapse of their vote in British Columbia; having won the popular vote and most seats in the province two years prior, the NDP were almost totally wiped out there during this election, losing all but two of their seats and finishing a distant third behind the Liberals and Tories. Their poor showing was blamed primarily on Lewis strongly hinting prior to the election that he would back Stanfield over Trudeau in the event of another minority parliament - which may have caused left-wing voters to vote for the Liberals in order to keep the Tories out of power - and also by an unpopular mineral tax introduced by the provincial British Columbia government of [[Dave Barrett]], which would lead to Barrett's government suffering a landslide loss in the following year's [[1975 British Columbia general election|provincial election]].\n\nThe [[Social Credit Party of Canada]], led by [[R\u00e9al Caouette]], continued to lose ground, and fell to 11 seats, one short of the number required to be recognized as a party in the House of Commons (and therefore qualify for research funds and parliamentary committee memberships). This status was nonetheless extended to the party by the governing Liberals, who believed that Social Credit's support came primarily at the expense of the Tories.\n\nOne seat was won in [[New Brunswick]] by independent candidate [[Leonard Jones]]. Jones, the former mayor of [[Moncton]], had secured the Progressive Conservative nomination, but PC leader Stanfield refused to sign Jones' nomination papers because he was a vocal opponent of [[Official bilingualism in Canada|official bilingualism]], which the PC Party supported.  Jones had opposed providing services in French in the City of Moncton even though 30% of the city's population was [[francophone]]. Jones ran and won as an independent. After the election, Social Credit leader Caouette invited Jones to join the Socred caucus, which would have given that party enough members for official status. Caouette justified the invitation on the basis that Jones agreed with providing bilingual education at the primary school level. Jones declined Caouette's invitation, and sat as an independent.\n\nOf the four major party leaders, only Trudeau would remain in place for the following federal election five years later. Stanfield, having failed to defeat the Liberals in any of his three elections as leader, faced pressure to stand down and eventually did so in 1976, being succeeded by [[Joe Clark]]. Lewis's position was rendered untenable by the loss of his own seat, and he was forced to stand down within a year of the election (though it later transpired that he had intended to retire in 1975 regardless of the election result, as he had secretly been battling [[leukaemia]]); [[Ed Broadbent]] initially replaced him as interim leader, and was subsequently elected to the position permanently. Caouette, who had only been able to play a minimal role in the election due to injuries sustained in a snowmobiling accident, stood down as leader of the Socreds in late 1976 and died not long afterwards; a succession of leaders took charge in the years ahead, ultimately leaving [[Fabien Roy]] as the man who would lead them into the next election.\n\n==National results==\n[[File:Chambre des
