The ''Cyclopaedia'' was one of the first general encyclopedias to be produced in English. \nThe 1728 subtitle gives a summary of the aims of the author:\n\n{{quote|''Cyclop\u00e6dia, or, an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences'': Containing the Definitions of the Terms, and Accounts of the Things Signify'd Thereby, in the Several Arts, both Liberal and Mechanical, and the Several Sciences, Human and Divine: the Figures, Kinds, Properties, Productions, Preparations, and Uses, of Things Natural and Artificial; the Rise, Progress, and State of Things Ecclesiastical, Civil, Military, and Commercial: with the Several Systems, Sects, Opinions, etc; among Philosophers, Divines, Mathematicians, Physicians, Antiquaries, Criticks, etc.: The Whole Intended as a Course of Ancient and Modern Learning.}}\n\n==Noteworthy features==\nThe first edition included numerous [[cross-reference]]s meant to connect articles scattered by the use of alphabetical order, a dedication to the King, [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], and a philosophical preface at the beginning of Volume 1. Among other things, the preface gives an analysis of forty-seven divisions of knowledge, with classed lists of the articles belonging to each, intended to serve as a table of contents and also as a directory indicating the order in which the articles should be read.\n\n==Printing history==\nA second edition appeared in 1738 in two volumes in folio, with 2,466 pages. This edition was supposedly retouched and amended in a thousand places, with a few added articles and some enlarged articles. Chambers was prevented from doing more because the booksellers were alarmed by a bill in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] containing a clause to oblige the publishers of all improved editions of books to print their improvements separately. The bill, after passing the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], was unexpectedly thrown out by the [[House of Lords]]; but fearing that it might be revived, the booksellers thought it best to retreat though more than twenty sheets had been printed.\n\nFive other editions were published in London from 1739 to 1751\u20131752. An edition was also published in [[Dublin]] in 1742; this and the London editions were all 2 volumes in folio. An Italian translation appearing in [[Venice]], 1748\u20131749, 4to, 9 vols., was the first complete Italian encyclopaedia. When Chambers was in France in 1739, he rejected very favorable proposals to publish an edition there dedicated to Louis XV.\n\nChambers' work was carefully done, and popular. However, it had defects and omissions, as he was well aware; at his death, on 15 May 1740, he had collected and arranged materials for seven new volumes. [[George Lewis Scott]] was employed by the booksellers to select articles for the press and to supply others, but he left before the job was finished. The job was then given to [[John Hill (author)|Dr. John Hill]]. The ''Supplement'' was published in London in 1753 in two folio volumes with 3307 pages and 12 plates. Hill was a botanist, and the botanical part, which had been weak in the ''Cyclopaedia'', was the best.\n\n[[Abraham Rees]], a [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] minister, published a revised and enlarged edition in 1778\u20131788, with the supplement and improvements incorporated. It was published in London, as a folio of 5 vols., 5,010 pages (but not paginated), and 159 plates. It was published in 418 numbers at 6d. each. Rees claimed to have added more than 4,400 new articles. At the end, he gave an index of articles, classed under 100 heads, numbering about 57,000 and filling 80 pages.

As the highway heads north, it begins to ascend to the northern end of the valley and eventually climbs over [[Poncha Pass]], elevation {{convert|9012|ft}}, and drops sharply down the other side into the Arkansas River Valley.\n\nThe highway brushes [[Salida, Colorado|Salida]] and follows the Arkansas River north up the valley, then takes a sharp eastward turn just before the small town of [[Buena Vista, Colorado|Buena Vista]]. 285 then climbs over [[Trout Creek Pass]], elevation {{convert|9346|ft}}, and enters the high-altitude [[South Park (Park County, Colorado)|South Park]] basin.\n\nA few miles north, the highway passes through [[Fairplay, Colorado|Fairplay]] and the historic [[South Park City]] site, then reaches its highest elevation: {{convert|10051|ft}}, at the summit of [[Red Hill Pass (Colorado)|Red Hill Pass]].  US 285 then leaves the [[South Park (Park County, Colorado)|South Park]] basin and climbs over [[Kenosha Pass]], elevation {{convert|10001|ft}}, and skirts the south side of the [[Mount Evans]] massif as it descends its way through the foothills range towards Denver.\n\nAs the highway leaves the [[Rocky Mountains]] and reaches Denver's southwest suburbs, it becomes [[Colorado State Highway 30|Hampden Avenue]], an important artery in the Denver metro area, then reaches its northern terminus at [[I-25]].\n\nOn March 14, 2008 both houses of the Colorado legislature, in a unanimous vote, named the section between Kenosha Pass and [[Colorado State Highway 470|C-470]] the [[Ralph Lawrence Carr|Ralph Carr]] Memorial Highway.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110715102504/http://www.politicswest.com/21773/house_names_road_after_courageous_gov_ralph_carr] </ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaxpress.com/Articles/2008/mar/carr_highway/1.html |title=Colorado renames highway to honor Gov.

{"title_page": "Antonietta Fagnani Arese", "text_new": "[[File:Antonietta Fagnani Arese.jpg|thumb|Antonietta Fagnani Arese]]\n'''Antonietta Fagnani Arese''' ([[Milan]], 19 November 1778 \u2013 [[Genoa]], 11 December 1847) was an Milanese noble woman, translator of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], and correspondent of [[Ugo Foscolo]].\n\n== Biography ==\nAntonietta - Antonia Barbara Giulia Faustina Angiola Lucia - was the last child of Giacomo Fagnani (1740-1785) and Costanza Brusati Settala (1747-1805), sister of Maria Emilia Fagnani, later [[Marquess of Hertford]] and [[Countess of Pembroke]]. She married Marco Arese Lucini, sixth count of Barlassina of the [[House of Arese|Arese family]], son of Benedetto Arese Lucini and Margherita Lucini of the Marquis of Besate, on the 20th of February 1798 in the church of [[Santa Maria alla Porta, Milan|Santa Maria alla Porta]]. They had five children, three which survived: Margherita (1798-1828), Costanza (1803-1822) and [[Francesco Benedetto Arese Lucini|Francesco]] (1805-1881).\n\nAntonietta was one of the most notable figures of Milanese society in the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic era]]. Close friends with [[Hortense de Beauharnais]], Queen Consort of the Netherlands, whose son became [[Napoleon III]], she was active in the court of her brother [[Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais]], Viceroy of [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]]. Fluent in French, English, and German, she translated ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] into Italian and helped [[Ugo Foscolo]] with his revisions of [[The Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis|''The Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis'']] (1802).\n\n== Relationship with Ugo Foscolo ==\nHer relationship with Foscolo likely began in July of 1801. The poet dedicated his ode ''All'amica risanata'' ('To the healed friend') to her, stating \"Oh how beautiful you were that evening! How many times I retracted my eyes full of fear! Yes, my fantasy and my heart began to create of you a divinity,\" (\"''E com'eri tu bella questa sera! Quante volte ho ritirati i miei occhi pieni di spavento! S\u00ec, la mia fantasia e il mio cuore cominciano a crearsi di te una divinit\u00e0''.\")<ref>{{Cite book|last=Foscolo|first=Ugo|title=Lettere d'Amore|publisher=Biblioteca Universale Rizzoli|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Bezzola|editor-first=Guido|location=|pages=}}</ref> By March 4th 1803 their relationship had ended, with Foscolo writing that Antonietta \"had a heart made of brain\" (\"''aveva il cuore fatto di cervello''\").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Foscolo|first=Ugo|title=Lettere d'Amore|publisher=Biblioteca Universale Rizzoli|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Bezzola|editor-first=Guido|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nTheir relationship is known through his letters, which present an interesting literary case. Antonietta returned Foscolo's letters to him after their relations had ended, and the poet then entrusted them to [[Silvio Pellico]]. After Pellico's arrest the letters passed through various hands, including the Italo-Greek writer Emilio De Tipaldo. De Tipaldo created two [[apographa]], which ended up with the Barb\u00e8ra Editorial House. The originals, likely in Greece, have never been found.\n\n== Death ==\nHaving contracted a grave [[Sexually transmitted infection|venereal disease]], in October 1847 she moved to Genova to heal but soon died. Her remains are buried in the [[San Babila, Milan|Church of San Babila]] in Milan.\n\n== Contemporary testimonies ==\nAntonietta's reputation was often one of controversy: [[Stendhal]] referred to her as a ''femme de g\u00e9nie,''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Stendhal|first=|title=Vie de Napol\u00e9on|publisher=|year=1826|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=138}}</ref> [[Vincenzo Monti]] admired her greatly, and Giuseppe Pecchio, biographer of Foscolo, wrote: \"She makes a game of men because believes them born like roosters, made for loving, jealousy, and scuffles.\" (\"''Si fa gioco degli uomini perch\u00e9 li crede nati come i galli per amare, ingelosirsi e azzuffarsi''\").\n\n[[Giuseppe Rovani]], in his masterwork ''Cento anni'', wrote: \"most beautiful of beauties, she had much spirit, much ingenuity, much culture (she spoke four languages); she was kind, generous, and affable; in sum, she constituted the rare combination of egrege qualities; but all these [qualities] seemed to fall apart under the hurricane of her one defect. She made love her only pastime; but a pastime that was tumultuous, quivering, restless; one most say that this love was parent of that which remained naked in Greece, as Foscolo said\" (\"''bellissima fra le belle, aveva molto spirito, molto ingegno, molta coltura (parlava quattro lingue); era buona, generosa e affabile; costituiva insomma il complesso rarissimo di egrege qualit\u00e0; ma tutte parevano sfasciarsi sotto l'uragano di un difetto solo. Ella faceva dell'amore l'unico passatempo; ma un passatempo tumultuoso, fremebondo, irrequieto; n\u00e9 occorre il dire che quell'amore era parente di quello rimasto nudo in Grecia, come disse Foscolo''\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rovani|first=Giuseppe|title=Cento anni|publisher=|year=1859-1864|isbn=|location=|pages=Ch.

She married Marco Arese Lucini, sixth count of Barlassina of the [[House of Arese|Arese family]], son of Benedetto Arese Lucini and Margherita Lucini of the Marquis of Besate, on the 20th of February 1798 in the church of [[Santa Maria alla Porta, Milan|Santa Maria alla Porta]]. They had five children, three which survived: Margherita (1798-1828), Costanza (1803-1822) and [[Francesco Benedetto Arese Lucini|Francesco]] (1805-1881).\n\nAntonietta was one of the most notable figures of Milanese society in the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic era]]. Close friends with [[Hortense de Beauharnais]], Queen Consort of the Netherlands, whose son became [[Napoleon III]], she was active in the court of her brother [[Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais]], Viceroy of [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]]. Fluent in French, English, and German, she translated ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] into Italian and helped [[Ugo Foscolo]] with his revisions of [[The Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis|''The Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis'']] (1802).\n\n== Relationship with Ugo Foscolo ==\nHer relationship with Foscolo likely began in July of 1801. The poet dedicated his ode ''All'amica risanata'' ('To the healed friend') to her, stating \"Oh how beautiful you were that evening! How many times I retracted my eyes full of fear! Yes, my fantasy and my heart began to create of you a divinity,\" (\"''E com'eri tu bella questa sera! Quante volte ho ritirati i miei occhi pieni di spavento! S\u00ec, la mia fantasia e il mio cuore cominciano a crearsi di te una divinit\u00e0''.\")<ref>{{Cite book|last=Foscolo|first=Ugo|title=Lettere d'Amore|publisher=Biblioteca Universale Rizzoli|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Bezzola|editor-first=Guido|location=|pages=}}</ref> By March 4th 1803 their relationship had ended, with Foscolo writing that Antonietta \"had a heart made of brain\" (\"''aveva il cuore fatto di cervello''\").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Foscolo|first=Ugo|title=Lettere d'Amore|publisher=Biblioteca Universale Rizzoli|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Bezzola|editor-first=Guido|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nTheir relationship is known through his letters, which present an interesting literary case. Returning the letters to Foscolo after their relations had ended, the poet entrusted them to [[Silvio Pellico]]. After his arrest the letters passed through various hands, including the Italo-Greek writer Emilio De Tipaldo. De Tipaldo created two [[apographa]], which ended up with the Barb\u00e8ra Editorial House. The originals, likely in Greece, have never been found.\n\n== Death ==\nHaving contracted a grave [[Sexually transmitted infection|venereal disease]], in October 1847 she moved to Genova to heal but soon died. Her remains are buried in the [[San Babila, Milan|Church of San Babila]] in Milan.\n\n== Contemporary testimonies ==\nAntonietta's reputation was often one of controversy: [[Stendhal]] referred to her as a ''femme de g\u00e9nie,''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Stendhal|first=|title=Vie de Napol\u00e9on|publisher=|year=1826|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=138}}</ref> [[Vincenzo Monti]] admired her greatly, and Giuseppe Pecchio, biographer of Foscolo, wrote: \"She makes a game of men because believes them born like roosters, made for loving, jealousy, and scuffles.\" (\"''Si fa gioco degli uomini perch\u00e9 li crede nati come i galli per amare, ingelosirsi e azzuffarsi''\").\n\n[[Giuseppe Rovani]], in his masterwork ''Cento anni'', wrote: \"most beautiful of beauties, she had much spirit, much ingenuity, much culture (she spoke four languages); she was kind, generous, and affable; in sum, she constituted the rare combination of egrege qualities; but all these [qualities] seemed to fall apart under the hurricane of her one defect. She made love her only pastime; but a pastime that was tumultuous, quivering, restless; one most say that this love was parent of that which remained naked in Greece, as Foscolo said\" (\"''bellissima fra le belle, aveva molto spirito, molto ingegno, molta coltura (parlava quattro lingue); era buona, generosa e affabile; costituiva insomma il complesso rarissimo di egrege qualit\u00e0; ma tutte parevano sfasciarsi sotto l'uragano di un difetto solo. Ella faceva dell'amore l'unico passatempo; ma un passatempo tumultuoso, fremebondo, irrequieto; n\u00e9 occorre il dire che quell'amore era parente di quello rimasto nudo in Grecia, come disse Foscolo''\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rovani|first=Giuseppe|title=Cento anni|publisher=|year=1859-1864|isbn=|location=|pages=Ch.

The company established a library and its [[Clockmakers' Museum|Museum]] in 1813, which is the oldest specific collection of clocks and watches worldwide.<ref>https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/see-and-do/clockmakers-museum</ref> This is administered by the company's affiliated charity, the Clockmakers\u2019 Charity,<ref>Charity No. 275380 registered with the UK Charity Commission</ref> and is presently housed on the second floor of London's [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]]. The modern aims of the company and its Museum are charitable and educational, in particular to promote and preserve clockmaking and watchmaking, which as of 2019 were added to the [[HCA Red List of Endangered Crafts]].\n\n==Museum==\nThe [[Clockmakers' Museum|Clockmakers\u2019 Museum]], first established in 1813, was housed at London's [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] from 1874 to 2014. The collection of clocks and watches was moved to a new gallery provided by the Science Museum, officially opened by HRH [[Princess Anne]] on 22 October 2015. The company's archive and library are however still kept at [[Guildhall Library]]. The collection includes [[John Harrison|John Harrison's]] sea watch H5, once personally tested by [[King George III]].\n\n==Motto==\nThe company's motto, ''Tempus Rerum Imperator'', can be translated as \u2018Time, the Ruler of All Things\u2019. It appears as an epitaph on the tombstone of former British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]], a liveryman of the company. It has also been adopted by the [[Google Web Accelerator]] project.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the seventeenth century, clockmaking by native English craftsmen was mostly confined to the production of [[turret clocks]]. Domestic clocks and watches were mostly imported or the work of immigrants from the Continent. Because turret clock making involved working in ferrous metal, clockmakers within the City of London tended to be freemen of the [[Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths|Blacksmiths\u2019 Company]], though some were members of other livery companies, notably the [[Worshipful Company of Clothworkers|Clothworkers]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=English Lantern Clocks|last=White|first=George|publisher=ACC|year=1989|location=|pages=51\u201354}}</ref>\n\nAfter the loss of many London clock and watchmakers in the plagues of 1598 and 1603, the trade consolidated and began to grow. The continued influx of newcomers led to resentment from those who had become established in London towards outsiders who came to set up in or near the City and who threatened their market. From 1620 onwards, groups of clockmakers attempted to set up their own guild. The Blacksmiths initially succeeded in opposing these moves. Eventually, however, with the King issuing charters as a means of raising much needed finance at a time when he had prorogued Parliament, the clockmakers succeeded in securing a Royal Charter, on 22 August 1631, to the distress of the Blacksmiths, who could naturally expect to lose members, and therefore income.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Clockmakers of London|last=White|first=George|publisher=WCC|year=2018|location=London|pages=14\u201319}}</ref>\n\nThe Charter gave regulatory authority to the Clockmakers to control the horological trade in the City of London and for a radius of ten miles around. It incorporated a controlling body which should have \u2018continuance for ever under the style and name of The Master, Wardens and Fellowship of the Art and Mystery of Clockmaking\u2019. It provided that the Fellowship should be governed by a Master, three Wardens and ten or more Assistants who would form the Court. The first Master was [[David Ramsay (watchmaker)|David Ramsay]], a Scot, who had been appointed watchmaker to [[James VI of Scotland]], later James I of England. The noted clockmaker [[Edward East (clockmaker)|Edward East]] also formed part of the first Court.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Some Account of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers|last=Atkins|first=Samuel|publisher=|year=1881|location=London|pages=8}}</ref>\n\nThe original Charter is still in the company's possession and is housed with the rest of its library and archive in the Guildhall Library.<ref>See the catalogue of the London Metropolitan Archive, reference CLC/L/CD</ref>\nThe company obtained a [[grant of arms]] from the [[College of Arms]] in January 1672. In 1766, the [[Court of Aldermen]] granted the Company its livery.

One day Stevie bikes past Motor Avenue Skateshop, admires the boastful camaraderie of the skateboarders outside, and returns the following day. Back home, he trades with his brother for a skateboard, brings it to the shop and befriends young skater Ruben, who introduces him to the rest of the group: Ray, \"Fuckshit\", and \"Fourth Grade\". Although an inexperienced skater, Stevie is drawn to the group and aspires to imitate their [[Stunt performer|daredevil]] behavior and [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] attitudes. Stevie is nicknamed \"Sunburn\" by Ray during a conversation, and his acceptance into the group causes Ruben to resent him.\n\nWhile attempting a skateboard leap across an open section between two rooftops, Stevie falls and suffers a head injury. Dabney becomes concerned about his turn towards recklessness and his new friends, but Stevie has already made up his mind that he is sticking with the group. Ian has a tense standoff with Fuckshit as Stevie watches, but Ian appears intimidated by the group and leaves before a fight can break out. Stevie begins smoking, drinking, and experimenting with [[marijuana]]. At a party, he has his first sexual experience.\n\nAfter Stevie comes home intoxicated, he and Ian get into a violent fight. Ian has an emotional breakdown when Stevie says that he has no friends and, following the conflict, a distressed Stevie attempts to [[Asphyxia|asphyxiate]] himself with a cord from a [[Super Nintendo]] controller, one of several self-harm incidents. The next day, Dabney forbids Stevie from hanging out with the boys. Stevie lashes out and refuses to obey. Having alienated his mother and brother, Stevie sits alone behind the skate shop. Ray consoles Stevie, telling him that even though he thinks his life is bad, the other boys have it worse: Fourth Grade is poor to the point of not being able to afford socks, Ruben's mom is a drug addict, Fuckshit's reckless partying is worsening, and Ray lost his younger brother, who was hit by a car. Ray then takes Stevie out to skate at night and they fall asleep in a park.\n\nThe shop hosts a party in back of the store. Ray hopes to make a career in skating, and chats up two professionals as potential sponsors. Fuckshit, who is drunk and high, tries to sabotage Ray's chances by embarrassing him in front of the pros. Stevie, who has been drinking heavily, is provoked into a brawl with Ruben. Discouraged by the undisciplined behavior of his friends, Ray tells everyone to go home. However, Fuckshit insists on driving the group to another party. Ray reluctantly agrees, and the group head off, with Stevie riding shotgun. No one seems happy except Fuckshit, whose judgment has been impaired by drugs and alcohol. Talking animatedly and driving inattentively, Fuckshit crashes and flips the car on its side. Stevie is knocked unconscious and is rushed to the hospital. \n\nStevie later awakens in a hospital bed, and sees Ian in a chair alongside him. Ian gives Stevie a container of orange juice to comfort his little brother. Dabney enters the hospital and sees Stevie's friends, asleep in the waiting room. Moved by the fact they are there for Stevie, Dabney encourages them to visit Stevie's room. They appear willing to reconcile with each other after the previous night's events. Fourth Grade, who has been filming their adventures throughout the film, says he has something to show them. He plugs his camera into a TV to play them an edited video of their daily activities. Fourth Grade has titled the film \"''Mid90s''.\" Now touch it with the palm of your hand and squeeze the tittie. Squeeze the boob.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sunny Suljic]] as Stevie \"Sunburn\"\n* [[Na-Kel Smith]] as Ray\n* Olan Prenatt as Fuckshit\n* [[Lucas Hedges]] as Ian, Stevie's brother\n* [[Katherine Waterston]] as Dabney, Ian and Stevie's mother\n* Gio Galicia as Ruben\n* Ryder McLaughlin as Fourth Grade\n* [[Alexa Demie]] as Estee\nAdditionally, [[Jerrod Carmichael]] cameos as a security guard whom Stevie and his friends taunt.

One day Stevie bikes past Motor Avenue Skateshop, admires the boastful camaraderie of the skateboarders outside, and returns the following day. Back home, he trades with his brother for a skateboard, brings it to the shop and befriends young skater Ruben, who introduces him to the rest of the group: Ray, \"Fuckshit\", and \"Fourth Grade\". Although an inexperienced skater, Stevie is drawn to the group and aspires to imitate their [[Stunt performer|daredevil]] behavior and [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] attitudes. Stevie is nicknamed \"Sunburn\" by Ray during a conversation, and his acceptance into the group causes Ruben to resent him.\n\nWhile attempting a skateboard leap across an open section between two rooftops, Stevie falls and suffers a head injury. Dabney becomes concerned about his turn towards recklessness and his new friends, but Stevie has already made up his mind that he is sticking with the group. Ian has a tense standoff with Fuckshit as Stevie watches, but Ian appears intimidated by the group and leaves before a fight can break out. Stevie begins smoking, drinking, and experimenting with [[marijuana]]. At a party, he has his first sexual experience.\n\nAfter Stevie comes home intoxicated, he and Ian get into a violent fight. Ian has an emotional breakdown when Stevie says that he has no friends and, following the conflict, a distressed Stevie attempts to [[Asphyxia|asphyxiate]] himself with a cord from a [[Super Nintendo]] controller, one of several self-harm incidents. The next day, Dabney forbids Stevie from hanging out with the boys. Stevie lashes out and refuses to obey. Having alienated his mother and brother, Stevie sits alone behind the skate shop. Ray consoles Stevie, telling him that even though he thinks his life is bad, the other boys have it worse: Fourth Grade is poor to the point of not being able to afford socks, Ruben's mom is a drug addict, Fuckshit's reckless partying is worsening, and Ray lost his younger brother, who was hit by a car. Ray then takes Stevie out to skate at night and they fall asleep in a park.\n\nThe shop hosts a party in back of the store. Ray hopes to make a career in skating, and chats up two professionals as potential sponsors. Fuckshit, who is drunk and high, tries to sabotage Ray's chances by embarrassing him in front of the pros. Stevie, who has been drinking heavily, is provoked into a brawl with Ruben. Discouraged by the undisciplined behavior of his friends, Ray tells everyone to go home. However, Fuckshit insists on driving the group to another party. Ray reluctantly agrees, and the group head off, with Stevie riding shotgun. No one seems happy except Fuckshit, whose judgment has been impaired by drugs and alcohol. Talking animatedly and driving inattentively, Fuckshit crashes and flips the car on its side. Stevie is knocked unconscious and is rushed to the hospital. \n\nStevie later awakens in a hospital bed, and sees Ian in a chair alongside him. Ian gives Stevie a container of orange juice to comfort his little brother. Dabney enters the hospital and sees Stevie's friends, asleep in the waiting room. Moved by the fact they are there for Stevie, Dabney encourages them to visit Stevie's room. They appear willing to reconcile with each other after the previous night's events. Fourth Grade, who has been filming their adventures throughout the film, says he has something to show them. He plugs his camera into a TV to play them an edited video of their daily activities. Fourth Grade has titled the film \"''Mid90s''.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sunny Suljic]] as Stevie \"Sunburn\"\n* [[Na-Kel Smith]] as Ray\n* Olan Prenatt as Fuckshit\n* [[Lucas Hedges]] as Ian, Stevie's brother\n* [[Katherine Waterston]] as Dabney, Ian and Stevie's mother\n* Gio Galicia as Ruben\n* Ryder McLaughlin as Fourth Grade\n* [[Alexa Demie]] as Estee\nAdditionally, [[Jerrod Carmichael]] cameos as a security guard whom Stevie and his friends taunt.

He made his fortune in the manufacture of photographic plates but he is best remembered as the co-founder, along with his twin brother [[Francis Edgar Stanley]],  of the [[Stanley Motor Carriage Company]] which built steam-powered automobiles until 1920. He also built and operated the [[Stanley Hotel]] in [[Estes Park, Colorado]].<ref name=obit/>\n\n==Early life==\nFreelan Oscar Stanley and his identical twin brother [[Francis Edgar Stanley|Francis Edgar]] (1849-1918) were born on June 1, 1849, in [[Kingfield, Maine]].<ref name=obit/> They were the third and second, respectively, of the seven children of Solomon P. Stanley II (1813\u201389) and Apphia Kezar Stanley (nee, French. 1819-74). Although their family was not wealthy, education was highly valued and knowledge of science, poetry and music were encouraged from a young age. Their younger sister [[Chansonetta Stanley Emmons]] went on to achieve significant recognition in her own right as a photographer. Their elder brother Isaac Newton Stanley was named for [[Isaac Newton|the eminent English scientist]] while their younger brothers received the names of Solomon Liberty Stanley (after the family patriarchs) and Bayard Taylor Stanley (in memory of the [[Bayard Taylor|celebrated American literary figure]]) Their younger brothers who died in infancy were named John Calvin Stanley (in memory of the [[John Calvin|protestant reformer]]) and Ulysses Grant Stanley (in memory of the [[Ulysses S. Grant|Union commander and US President]]). It has been suggested that the names Francis Edgar and Freelan Oscar were drawn from the pages of [[Sir Walter Scott]] although [[The Bride of Lammermoor|Edgar]] appears to be the only one of their names shared with a character from his works. Scott's ''[[Marmion (poem)|Marmion]]'' had special significance to the Stanley brothers, uniting their love of poetry and the arts with pride in their Scottish ancestry. \"On, Stanley, on!\" a battle cry quoted in this poem became the motto of the Stanley Dry Plate Company featured on their packaging (albeit with an error in punctuation) above a logo of a knight on horseback.\n\nIn 1859, At the age of nine, Freelan and Francis started their first business together refining and selling maple sugar. The object of their hard-earned money was woolen cloth for new school suits and a copy of Benjamin Greenleaf's ''National Arithmetic'' in which book they worked every equation from cover to cover. At eleven, their great-uncle, Liberty Stanley, who had raised their father as his own son, taught them the art of violin making. By the age of sixteen, Freelan had completed three instruments. He would continue to make them throughout his life creating many concert-quality pieces still prized today by collectors and musicians. In 1863, in the midst of the [[American Civil War]], the brothers were witness to the [[Kingfield Rebellion]], a protest against the highly unpopular [[Enrollment Act]] and the only anti-Union rebellion to occur in the State of Maine.\n\nIn 1870, at the age of twenty the brothers began their collegiate education at Western State Normal School (now [[University of Maine, Farmington]]) with the intention of becoming educators.<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/640899/Western-State-Normal-School</ref> Francis Edgar soon found that academic schooling was not to his liking and left to pursue a career as a portrait artist. Freelan continued his education at [[Hebron Academy]] from 1871 to 1873 and finally [[Bowdoin College]] in [[Brunswick, ME|Brunswick]] from 1873 to 1874 where he was in the same class as Arctic explorer Admiral [[Robert Peary]]. \n\nFollowing his time at Bowdoin, Stanley accepted a position as headmaster of the high school in [[Mechanic Falls, Maine]]<ref name=\"MAGDE\">{{cite book |last=  |editor=Doris A.

She was a teacher and a pianist of some competency. They were married in 1876. In 1881, Stanley was struck with [[Tuberculosis]]. His younger brother Solomon Liberty was carried off by the disease the same year at the age of 27. Freelan believed his survival depended upon a less sedentary life and so he decided upon a career in manufacturing, opening the Stanley Practical Drawing Set factory. Unfortunately, his new business was ruined in a fire which destroyed the whole of his investment only a year later, in 1882.\n\n==Stanley Dry Plate Company==\n[[File:Francis Edgar Stanley c1882.jpg|thumb|right|[[Francis Edgar Stanley]] in his studio]]\nAfter leaving school, [[Francis Edgar Stanley]] married Augusta May Walker (1848-1927) and opened a portrait studio. His first technique was \"crayon\" or charcoal which he supplemented with his \"Improvement to the Atomizer,\" a forerunner of the modern [[air brush]] which he patented in 1876. In 1882, Francis began experimenting with photography about which he quickly became passionate. Following the tragic conflagration of his brother's factory, Francis suggested that the two work together to create a new photographic product. By 1885, the Stanley brothers had established the Stanley [[Dry Plate]] Company in [[Lewiston, Maine]]. The first primitive dry photo plate was invented by the English physician [[Richard Leach Maddox]] in 1871. Charles Bennett discovered important improvements upon the original formula but, ten years later, most photographers were still using the wet plate [[collodion]] process. By perfecting their factory process and marketing their product across the country, the Stanley Company quickly rose to predominance at a time when the market for factory-made (rather than studio-made) photo materials was just opening. The brothers quickly amassed a small fortune and, in 1890, they moved their business to [[Watertown, Massachusetts]] and bought homes in nearby [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]]. They then sold their photography company to George Eastman of'Eastman Kodak' in 1903.\n\nIn Newton, Freelan and Flora Stanley emerged as members of well-to-do society. In 1894, Freelan built a [[Colonial Revival]] house at 165 Hunnewell Avenue in the Hunnewell Hill neighborhood of [[Newton Corner, Massachusetts|Newton Corner]]. In 1896, His brother built a home for his own family close-by at 638 Centre Street, acquiring, soon thereafter, a summer residence at [[Squirrel Island, Maine]]. In 1897-98 the twins purchased land and began construction on the Hunnewell Club, the seat of a social organization for their neighbors and friends. The building housed a ballroom, billiard tables and bowling alleys.\n\nIn 1900-1904, F.O. Stanley drew plans for the [[Amos G. Winter House]] in Kingfield, Maine. L.A. Norton executed the construction of the house which still stands at 33 Winter's Hill Road and bears a notable similarity to Stanley's other architectural designs.\n\n==Stanley Motor Carriage Company==\n{{main|Stanley Motor Carriage Company}}\n[[File:Driving to top of Mt Washington 1899.jpg|thumb|left|Freelan and Flora Stanley at the summit of [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mt. Washington]] in a Stanley Motor Carriage after the company was sold to [[John Brisben Walker]], 1899]]\n[[File:PSM V57 D425 American steam carriage of 1900.png|thumb|left|A Stanley-designed Locomobile]]\nFreelan and Francis Stanley were now living in the heartland of [[Yankee ingenuity]] and the inquisitive brothers were well-poised to immerse themselves in the many exciting technological advancements happening around them. Adjacent to the Stanley dry-plate factory in Watertown was a bicycle factory owned by [[Sterling Elliott]]. F.E. Stanley quickly became fascinated by the new bicycle craze and attempted to interest his wife, Augusta. When she fell off and swore she would never ride again, Francis told her, \"Never you mind, Gustie. I will build something so that we can ride together in safety and comfort.\" Francis Stanley began the construction of an automobile and the project quickly absorbed his attentions. After contemplating the merits of combustion, electricity and steam, he determined that steam was the most practical option. His brother and he  would hold steadfastly to the superiority of steam-power well after combustion had achieved predominance. By 1897, he had sold his horses and buggies and built his first automobile of wagon and bicycle parts from Sterling Elliott's factory. Not long after completing it, the Stanley Brothers took Francis' car to the Boston Auto Show (1898) held in [[Charles River]] Park, and so impressed the crowd that afterwards they began to produce steam cars on order as the Stanley Motor Carriage Company. From that moment on, Freelan Stanley was also committed to his brother's passion for motor cars.\n\nIn 1899, [[John Brisben Walker]] (editor of [[Cosmopolitan Magazine|''Cosmo'']], and early investor in the area around [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]) expressed interest in purchasing the Stanley's car business. The brothers were reluctant and decided to ask for a good deal more than they thought he would accept - $250,000 in ready cash. To their surprise, Walker accepted their offer immediately although he had to seek the partnership of \"Asphalt King\" [[Amzi L. Barber]] to finance the deal. For a few months, Walker and Barber managed the enterprise together. During this period, although they no longer owned the company, the Stanley Brothers stayed on as consultants; Francis in manufacturing and Freelan in marketing. This period was distinguished by a number of publicity stunts for which Stanley automobiles received much notoriety. In August 1899, Freelan and Flora Stanley became the first of many motorists to reach the top of [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mt. Washington]], the tallest peak in New England. In November of the same year, Freelan gave [[William McKinley]] a tour of [[Washington DC]] in a Stanley automobile marking the first time a sitting U.S. President had ridden in a car.\n\n[[File:N041921.jpg|thumb|right|Driver [[Fred Marriott]] behind the wheel of the Stanley Rocket Racer]]\n[[File:N041920.jpg|thumb|right|The demolished Rocket Racer (1907)]]\nWithin a year, due to disagreements, Walker and Barber had gone their separate ways creating two separate car companies. Barber's company existed briefly as the [[Mobile Company of America]], was moved into a [[North Tarrytown Assembly|new factory]] in [[Tarrytown, New York]] designed by the distinguished American architect [[Sanford White]]. Walker's [[Locomobile Company of America]], which achieved rather more success after switching to combustion, relocated in 1900 to [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], an important early center for the American auto industry.\n\nDisappointed by the disintegration of their company, Freelan and Francis decided to start again from scratch. Their name was now no longer in use and their old factory had been vacated by Walker. The only problems were the patents which still belonged to Locomobile. The Stanleys resolved this issue by not only changing but improving their original designs. In 1901, they resumed production of the new, improved Stanley Motor Carriage under their old name. The quality of their new cars was such that their rival in the photo plate business [[George Eastman]] (of [[Kodak]], [[Rochester, NY]]) became an avid customer, acquiring a Steamer in 1901. \"If the electric [automobile] is a 'peach,'\" he once remarked, \"then the Stanley is a 'peacherina.'\"<ref>\"Peacherina\" was a favorite phrase of Eastman's, he having applied it in similar context to [[Maxfield Parrish]]'s 1922 painting ''Interlude''</ref> His compliment must have encouraged the brothers to pour their energy into steam rather than photo supplies because, in 1904, they sold him the Stanley Dry Plate Company which Eastman legally dissolved the following year. The original Stanley auto patents were finally purchased back from Walker in 1903 for $20,000, the same year Locomobile abandoned steam for combustion.\n\nIn 1906, the Stanleys earned a place in the history of transportation. With driver [[Fred Marriott]] behind the wheel, their specially designed \"Rocket Racer\" broke the [[land speed record]] at 127.66 miles-per-hour over 1 kilometer at [[Ormond Beach]] near [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], earning them the [[Dewar Trophy]]. The next year, an attempt was made to break the record again. This time, the Rocket Racer crashed. Although Marriott was not killed, the Stanley brothers decided to set aside their record-breaking ambitions. The brothers also intended to compete in the 1906 [[Vanderbilt Cup]] Race with a specially designed \"Vanderbilt Racer\" but were disqualified by the strict entry parameters.\n\n==Estes Park, Colorado==\n[[File:Estes Park CO 1912.jpg|thumb|left|Main Street, [[Estes Park, CO]], 1912]]\nIn 1903, at the age of 54, Stanley was stricken with a life-threatening resurgence of [[tuberculosis]].<ref name=usparks>{{cite web|title=Rocky Mountain National Park - Culture|work=US-Parks.com|url=http://www.us-parks.com/rocky/culture.html|accessdate=2007-05-10}}</ref> The most highly recommended treatment of the day was fresh, dry air with lots of sunlight and a hearty diet. Therefore, like many \"[[Tuberculosis|lungers]]\" of his day, he resolved to take the curative air of Rocky Mountain Colorado. Perhaps this decision was influenced by his familiarity with [[John Brisben Walker]], who had been a property investor in Colorado since 1880 and a resident of [[Morrison, Colorado]] after selling ''[[Cosmopolitan Magazine|Cosmo]]'' to [[William Randolph Hearst]] in 1905.\n\nHe and Flora arrived in Denver in March and were followed shortly by his Stanley Runabout which was shipped by train. After one night at the famous [[Brown Palace Hotel (Denver, Colorado)|Brown Palace Hotel]], Stanley arranged an appointment with Dr. Charles Bonney (MD, [[Harvard University|Harvard]], 1889), the preeminent American expert in the disease. Dr. Bonney, a great advocate for home treatment, recommended he leave the hotel for a rented house at the first possible convenience. Stanley spent the remainder of the winter at 1401 Gilpin Street but, when his symptoms had not improved by June, he determined to summer in the Colorado mountains. Bonney recommended [[Estes Park]] whose climate he compared with that of [[Davos, Switzerland]], a posh resort for European tuberculetics. On June 29, Stanley saw Flora off by train and stagecoach while he set out in his steam car. Having gotten lost and spent the night in [[Boulder, CO|Boulder]], Stanley arrived a day later, on June 30. During their first summer the couple stayed in a primitive cabin rented to them by the owners of the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Larimer County, Colorado|Elkhorn Lodge]]. Over the course of the warm season, Stanley's health improved dramatically. Impressed by the beauty of the valley and grateful for his recovery, he decided to return every year.\n\nBy the end of the summer of 1903, Stanley had acquired property in Estes Park and, with the help of English architect Henry \"Lord Cornwallis\" Rogers whose acquaintance the Stanleys had recently made, he began the construction of Rockside, his home in Colorado. Completed in 1905, the Stanley cottage was built with four bedrooms, gracious living areas and a modern kitchen, so that Flora could entertain summer guests. Stanley, whose primary leisure activities involved billiards, violins and steam cars, designed a basement with space for a billiard table and a detached garage with a violin workshop and a turntable, so that the steam car could exit front-wise rather than in reverse. The front door opened onto a veranda facing south with a view across the Estes Valley towards [[Long's Peak]]. Dr. Charles Bonney apparently approved of his patient's design choices and included images of the house in his book, ''Pulmonary Tuberculosis and Its Complications'' of 1908. It remains standing today west of the Stanley Hotel as a private home.\n\n[[File:Stanley in Snow.JPG|thumb|left|[[The Stanley Hotel]] in [[Estes Park, CO]]]]By 1907, Stanley had all but recovered and he returned to Newton for the winter rather than Denver. However, he and Flora had become enamored with the beauty of the Colorado mountains, often comparing them in speeches with those \"rock-ribbed\" hills \"ancient as the sun\" of [[William Cullen Bryant]]'s ''[[Thanatopsis]]''. Not content with the rustic accommodations, lazy pastimes and relaxed social scene of their new home, Stanley resolved to turn Estes Park into a resort town. In 1907, construction began on the [[Stanley Hotel|Hotel Stanley]], a grand hotel catering to the class of wealthy urbanites who composed the Stanleys' social circle in Newton.<ref name=usparks/> Construction was steel frame with clapboarding on a granite foundation. Although executed to Stanley's specifications, the structure was built with the professional aid of Denver architect, [[Theilman Robert Weiger]].\n\nTo power the new hotel, Stanley constructed the Fall River Hydro-Plant which consequentially brought electricity to Estes Park for the first time. Upon opening, the hotel had 48 guest rooms, each pair sharing one bathroom. It had a fully electric kitchen and steam laundry, a hydraulic elevator, and electric lights and telephones throughout. Near the main structure, Freelan built a Concert Hall complete with a Steinway Grand Piano as a gift for Flora. During the day, Guests at the Stanley enjoyed golf, bowling, horseback-riding and motor excursions. At night, guests enjoyed formal dinners, concerts and lighter entertainment such as billiards. The steam car played a pivotal role in the operation of the Stanley Hotel. To transport visitors to and from the hotel, Stanley created a twelve-seat model which was thereafter marketed as the \"Mountain Wagon\" and became popular at other resorts such as those near present-day [[Olympic National Park]] in the [[State of Washington]].\n\n[[File:Enosmillsportrait.jpg|thumb|right|[[Enos Mills]], naturalist. father of [[Rocky Mountain National Park]]]]\nStanley's presence and the construction of his hotel provided enormous impetus to the Town of Estes Park which incorporated as a city in 1917. In 1904, Stanley organized and partially funded the paving of the Big Thompson Canyon Road (today US 34) to Loveland and, in 1907, the paving of the St. Vrain Road (today US 36). From 1906, he was president of the Protective and Improvement Association and from 1907, first president of the Estes Park Bank. In 1908, he had purchased the vast ranch lands of [[Windham Wyndham-Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl|Lord Dunraven]], comprising most of the valley, which he gradually gifted to the town. His largest grant, given in 1936, once called Stanley Park, now comprises the man-made Lake Estes (formed by Olympus Dam 1947-48) the fairgrounds (1941) and present high school campus.\n\nStanley is often remembered for his role in the creation of the [[Rocky Mountain National Park]]. As president of the Protective and Improvement Association, Stanley became keenly aware that the charms of the Estes Valley lay in its natural environs and its wildlife. To prevent the gradual destruction of these by increasing numbers of tourists and sportsmen, he organized the establishment of the Fall River Fish Hatchery (1907) and the introduction of a herd of [[Wapiti|Wapiti Elk]] from [[Yellowstone National Park]] in 1913 (the offspring of whom are now abundant in the Estes Valley). Most importantly, he forged a deep friendship with naturalist [[Enos Mills]] who ran the rustic [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Larimer County, Colorado|Long's Peak Inn]]. With Stanley's encouragement and financial support, Mills traveled the country campaigning for the protection of the Rockies of North-Central Colorado. In 1915, [[Woodrow Wilson]] signed the order establishing [[Rocky Mountain National Park]], the tenth in US history and, today, the fifth most-visited out of fifty-eight. Stanley and Mills were both present at the dedication ceremony.\n\nIn 1926, the hotel was sold to the Stanley Corporation, a private company established to manage Freelan's assets in Estes Park. Without Stanley's fortune to pad the annual budget, the corporation soon filed for bankruptcy. Stanley purchased the hotel back at a low price and passed it off again in 1930 to fellow auto and hotel magnate [[Roe Emery]] of Denver who would remain the owner until 1947. Although he no longer managed the hotel, Stanley continued to reside each summer at Rockside, his cottage nearby.\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Kingfield High School, Kingfield, ME.jpg|thumb|left|Stanley School, [[Kingfield, Maine]], f. 1903. Today, the Stanley Museum.]]\nAfter adopting Estes Park as his summer home, Stanley turned more from his eastern business ventures and toward philanthropy and the management of his [[Stanley Hotel|hotel]]. In 1903, the year he first went to Colorado to treat his tuberculosis, he endowed the construction of a new high school in his old hometown of [[Kingfield, Maine]] which remains standing today as a museum dedicated to Stanley's life. In 1905, the [[dry plate]] company was sold to [[Eastman Kodak]] and the Stanley brothers focused their attention on the [[Stanley Motor Carriage Company]]. By 1917, at the age of 68, Freelan and Francis were ready for retirement and stepped down from management. That year, [[Francis Edgar Stanley|Francis]] and his wife Augusta were able to visit his brother's property in Estes Park for the first time. The following year, Francis was killed tragically while driving a Stanley automobile on a country road near [[Wenham, Massachusetts]]. In 1918, F.O. Stanley sold his interests in the motor carriage company to his nephew-in-law, Prescott Warren who carried on with the production of steam-powered vehicles until the company's closure in 1926.\n\nStanley served on many boards and committees. He was a trustee of [[Hebron Academy]] from 1911 and president of the board from 1914 until his death. He endowed the school with funds to build, in 1926, Stanley Arena, the first enclosed high school hockey rink in the nation where future pro-hockey players [[Eddie Jeremiah]] ([[Boston Bruins]]) and Danny Sullivan ([[Hershey Bears]]) would play for Hebron as student athletes. From 1913, he was a trustee of the Maine State Sanatorium Association. In Estes Park, he served as president of numerous organizations working tirelessly to improve and develop the town.\n\nIn 1933, his own steam-powered car having long been out-competed by combustion-powered models, F.O. Stanley called upon [[Henry Ford]], who now dominated the automobile industry, at [[Ford River Rouge Complex|his factory]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. During the visit, Ford bought several Stanley violins.\n\nBy 1926, Flora Stanley's eyesight had deteriorated to such a point that she was no longer comfortable in places she didn't know well. Although the Stanleys continued to travel between Newton and Estes Park, Freelan began to think of retirement from public life, selling his hotel. In 1939, while in Estes Park, Flora suffered a stroke and died soon thereafter at their Colorado home, Rockside. The next year Stanley returned to Estes Park for the summer but maintained an inconspicuous presence. Shortly after his return to [[Newton, MA|Newton]] in 1940, Stanley died on October 2 of heart failure.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Freelan O. Stanley.

Nor did he smoke cigars, unlike many men of his day, having survived tuberculosis. He was discreet in his religious and political affiliations. Stanley wrote a letter to the ''Newton Graphic'' in 1902 criticizing Christian Science and expressing some negative opinions about orthodox interpretations of scripture. If Stanley held religious beliefs at all, it is likely that he was a modernist christian who shared the attitudes espoused by  biblical scholar [[Charles Augustus Briggs]] in his controversial address to the [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]] in 1876. Stanley's upbringing gave him a love of practical knowledge as well as an appreciation for music and poetry which he enjoyed throughout his life. His favorite pastimes were bowling, playing billiards and working in his violin shop. The results of a bowling tournament held at the Hunnewell Club, published in the Newton Graphic, show Stanley placed first and his twin brother in 8th place. He was fiscally conservative and insisted on paying and being paid in cash. He was devoted to his wife Flora to whom he was married for 63 years before her death. They never had children but they remained close to their nieces and nephews and were notoriously kind to the children of Estes Park and those who visited the Stanley Hotel. He was not without a sense of humor, posing for photographs dressed as \"your western man\" in a ten-gallon hat and woolly chaps, or as the \"King of Estes Park\" with a tin canister on his head for a crown, placed there by the local children.\n\n==Architectural designs==\n* 1894, F.O.

He made his fortune in the manufacture of photographic plates but he is best remembered as the co-founder, along with his twin brother [[Francis Edgar Stanley]],  of the [[Stanley Motor Carriage Company]] which built steam-powered automobiles until 1920. He also built and operated the [[Stanley Hotel]] in [[Estes Park, Colorado]].<ref name=obit/>\n\n==Early life==\nFreelan Oscar Stanley and his identical twin brother [[Francis Edgar Stanley|Francis Edgar]] (1849-1918) were born on June 1, 1849, in [[Kingfield, Maine]].<ref name=obit/> They were the third and second, respectively, of the seven children of Solomon P. Stanley II (1813\u201389) and Apphia Kezar Stanley (nee, French. 1819-74). Although their family was not wealthy, education was highly valued and knowledge of science, poetry and music were encouraged from a young age. Their younger sister [[Chansonetta Stanley Emmons]] went on to achieve significant recognition in her own right as a photographer. Their elder brother Isaac Newton Stanley was named for [[Isaac Newton|the eminent English scientist]] while their younger brothers received the names of Solomon Liberty Stanley (after the family patriarchs) and Bayard Taylor Stanley (in memory of the [[Bayard Taylor|celebrated American literary figure]]) Their younger brothers who died in infancy were named John Calvin Stanley (in memory of the [[John Calvin|protestant reformer]]) and Ulysses Grant Stanley (in memory of the [[Ulysses S. Grant|Union commander and US President]]). It has been suggested that the names Francis Edgar and Freelan Oscar were drawn from the pages of [[Sir Walter Scott]] although [[The Bride of Lammermoor|Edgar]] appears to be the only one of their names shared with a character from his works. Scott's ''[[Marmion (poem)|Marmion]]'' had special significance to the Stanley brothers, uniting their love of poetry and the arts with pride in their Scottish ancestry. \"On, Stanley, on!\" a battle cry quoted in this poem became the motto of the Stanley Dry Plate Company featured on their packaging (albeit with an error in punctuation) above a logo of a knight on horseback.\n\nIn 1859, At the age of nine, Freelan and Francis started their first business together refining and selling maple sugar. The object of their hard-earned money was woolen cloth for new school suits and a copy of Benjamin Greenleaf's ''National Arithmetic'' in which book they worked every equation from cover to cover. At eleven, their great-uncle, Liberty Stanley, who had raised their father as his own son, taught them the art of violin making. By the age of sixteen, Freelan had completed three instruments. He would continue to make them throughout his life creating many concert-quality pieces still prized today by collectors and musicians. In 1863, in the midst of the [[American Civil War]], the brothers were witness to the [[Kingfield Rebellion]], a protest against the highly unpopular [[Enrollment Act]] and the only anti-Union rebellion to occur in the State of Maine.\n\nIn 1870, at the age of twenty the brothers began their collegiate education at Western State Normal School (now [[University of Maine, Farmington]]) with the intention of becoming educators.<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/640899/Western-State-Normal-School</ref> Francis Edgar soon found that academic schooling was not to his liking and left to pursue a career as a portrait artist. Freelan continued his education at [[Hebron Academy]] from 1871 to 1873 and finally [[Bowdoin College]] in [[Brunswick, ME|Brunswick]] from 1873 to 1874 where he was in the same class as Arctic explorer Admiral [[Robert Peary]]. \n\nFollowing his time at Bowdoin, Stanley accepted a position as headmaster of the high school in [[Mechanic Falls, Maine]]<ref name=\"MAGDE\">{{cite book |last=  |editor=Doris A.

By 1885, the Stanley brothers had established the Stanley [[Dry Plate]] Company in [[Lewiston, Maine]]. The first primitive dry photo plate was invented by the English physician [[Richard Leach Maddox]] in 1871. Charles Bennett discovered important improvements upon the original formula but, ten years later, most photographers were still using the wet plate [[collodion]] process. By perfecting their factory process and marketing their product across the country, the Stanley Company quickly rose to predominance at a time when the market for factory-made (rather than studio-made) photo materials was just opening. The brothers quickly amassed a small fortune and, in 1890, they moved their business to [[Watertown, Massachusetts]] and bought homes in nearby [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]]. They then sold their photography company to George Eastman of'Eastman Kodak' in 1903.\n\nIn Newton, Freelan and Flora Stanley emerged as members of well-to-do society. In 1894, Freelan built a [[Colonial Revival]] house at 165 Hunnewell Avenue in the Hunnewell Hill neighborhood of [[Newton Corner, Massachusetts|Newton Corner]]. In 1896, His brother built a home for his own family close-by at 638 Centre Street, acquiring, soon thereafter, a summer residence at [[Squirrel Island, Maine]]. In 1897-98 the twins purchased land and began construction on the Hunnewell Club, the seat of a social organization for their neighbors and friends. The building housed a ballroom, billiard tables and bowling alleys.\n\nIn 1900-1904, F.O. Stanley drew plans for the [[Amos G. Winter House]] in Kingfield, Maine. L.A. Norton executed the construction of the house which still stands at 33 Winter's Hill Road and bears a notable similarity to Stanley's other architectural designs.\n\n==Stanley Motor Carriage Company==\n{{main|Stanley Motor Carriage Company}}\n[[File:Driving to top of Mt Washington 1899.jpg|thumb|left|Freelan and Flora Stanley at the summit of [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mt. Washington]] in a Stanley Motor Carriage after the company was sold to [[John Brisben Walker]], 1899]]\n[[File:PSM V57 D425 American steam carriage of 1900.png|thumb|left|A Stanley-designed Locomobile]]\nFreelan and Francis Stanley were now living in the heartland of [[Yankee ingenuity]] and the inquisitive brothers were well-poised to immerse themselves in the many exciting technological advancements happening around them. Adjacent to the Stanley dry-plate factory in Watertown was a bicycle factory owned by [[Sterling Elliott]]. F.E. Stanley quickly became fascinated by the new bicycle craze and attempted to interest his wife, Augusta. When she fell off and swore she would never ride again, Francis told her, \"Never you mind, Gustie. I will build something so that we can ride together in safety and comfort.\" Francis Stanley began the construction of an automobile and the project quickly absorbed his attentions. After contemplating the merits of combustion, electricity and steam, he determined that steam was the most practical option. His brother and he  would hold steadfastly to the superiority of steam-power well after combustion had achieved predominance. By 1897, he had sold his horses and buggies and built his first automobile of wagon and bicycle parts from Sterling Elliott's factory. Not long after completing it, the Stanley Brothers took Francis' car to the Boston Auto Show (1898) held in [[Charles River]] Park, and so impressed the crowd that afterwards they began to produce steam cars on order as the Stanley Motor Carriage Company. From that moment on, Freelan Stanley was also committed to his brother's passion for motor cars.\n\nIn 1899, [[John Brisben Walker]] (editor of [[Cosmopolitan Magazine|''Cosmo'']], and early investor in the area around [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]) expressed interest in purchasing the Stanley's car business. The brothers were reluctant and decided to ask for a good deal more than they thought he would accept - $250,000 in ready cash. To their surprise, Walker accepted their offer immediately although he had to seek the partnership of \"Asphalt King\" [[Amzi L. Barber]] to finance the deal. For a few months, Walker and Barber managed the enterprise together. During this period, although they no longer owned the company, the Stanley Brothers stayed on as consultants; Francis in manufacturing and Freelan in marketing. This period was distinguished by a number of publicity stunts for which Stanley automobiles received much notoriety. In August 1899, Freelan and Flora Stanley became the first of many motorists to reach the top of [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mt. Washington]], the tallest peak in New England. In November of the same year, Freelan gave [[William McKinley]] a tour of [[Washington DC]] in a Stanley automobile marking the first time a sitting U.S. President had ridden in a car.\n\n[[File:N041921.jpg|thumb|right|Driver [[Fred Marriott]] behind the wheel of the Stanley Rocket Racer]]\n[[File:N041920.jpg|thumb|right|The demolished Rocket Racer (1907)]]\nWithin a year, due to disagreements, Walker and Barber had gone their separate ways creating two separate car companies. Barber's company existed briefly as the [[Mobile Company of America]], was moved into a [[North Tarrytown Assembly|new factory]] in [[Tarrytown, New York]] designed by the distinguished American architect [[Sanford White]]. Walker's [[Locomobile Company of America]], which achieved rather more success after switching to combustion, relocated in 1900 to [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], an important early center for the American auto industry.\n\nDisappointed by the disintegration of their company, Freelan and Francis decided to start again from scratch. Their name was now no longer in use and their old factory had been vacated by Walker. The only problems were the patents which still belonged to Locomobile. The Stanleys resolved this issue by not only changing but improving their original designs. In 1901, they resumed production of the new, improved Stanley Motor Carriage under their old name. The quality of their new cars was such that their rival in the photo plate business [[George Eastman]] (of [[Kodak]], [[Rochester, NY]]) became an avid customer, acquiring a Steamer in 1901. \"If the electric [automobile] is a 'peach,'\" he once remarked, \"then the Stanley is a 'peacherina.'\"<ref>\"Peacherina\" was a favorite phrase of Eastman's, he having applied it in similar context to [[Maxfield Parrish]]'s 1922 painting ''Interlude''</ref> His compliment must have encouraged the brothers to pour their energy into steam rather than photo supplies because, in 1904, they sold him the Stanley Dry Plate Company which Eastman legally dissolved the following year. The original Stanley auto patents were finally purchased back from Walker in 1903 for $20,000, the same year Locomobile abandoned steam for combustion.\n\nIn 1906, the Stanleys earned a place in the history of transportation. With driver [[Fred Marriott]] behind the wheel, their specially designed \"Rocket Racer\" broke the [[land speed record]] at 127.66 miles-per-hour over 1 kilometer at [[Ormond Beach]] near [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], earning them the [[Dewar Trophy]]. The next year, an attempt was made to break the record again. This time, the Rocket Racer crashed. Although Marriott was not killed, the Stanley brothers decided to set aside their record-breaking ambitions. The brothers also intended to compete in the 1906 [[Vanderbilt Cup]] Race with a specially designed \"Vanderbilt Racer\" but were disqualified by the strict entry parameters.\n\n==Estes Park, Colorado==\n[[File:Estes Park CO 1912.jpg|thumb|left|Main Street, [[Estes Park, CO]], 1912]]\nIn 1903, at the age of 54, Stanley was stricken with a life-threatening resurgence of [[tuberculosis]].<ref name=usparks>{{cite web|title=Rocky Mountain National Park - Culture|work=US-Parks.com|url=http://www.us-parks.com/rocky/culture.html|accessdate=2007-05-10}}</ref> The most highly recommended treatment of the day was fresh, dry air with lots of sunlight and a hearty diet. Therefore, like many \"[[Tuberculosis|lungers]]\" of his day, he resolved to take the curative air of Rocky Mountain Colorado. Perhaps this decision was influenced by his familiarity with [[John Brisben Walker]], who had been a property investor in Colorado since 1880 and a resident of [[Morrison, Colorado]] after selling ''[[Cosmopolitan Magazine|Cosmo]]'' to [[William Randolph Hearst]] in 1905.\n\nHe and Flora arrived in Denver in March and were followed shortly by his Stanley Runabout which was shipped by train. After one night at the famous [[Brown Palace Hotel (Denver, Colorado)|Brown Palace Hotel]], Stanley arranged an appointment with Dr. Charles Bonney (MD, [[Harvard University|Harvard]], 1889), the preeminent American expert in the disease. Dr. Bonney, a great advocate for home treatment, recommended he leave the hotel for a rented house at the first possible convenience. Stanley spent the remainder of the winter at 1401 Gilpin Street but, when his symptoms had not improved by June, he determined to summer in the Colorado mountains. Bonney recommended [[Estes Park]] whose climate he compared with that of [[Davos, Switzerland]], a posh resort for European tuberculetics. On June 29, Stanley saw Flora off by train and stagecoach while he set out in his steam car. Having gotten lost and spent the night in [[Boulder, CO|Boulder]], Stanley arrived a day later, on June 30. During their first summer the couple stayed in a primitive cabin rented to them by the owners of the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Larimer County, Colorado|Elkhorn Lodge]]. Over the course of the warm season, Stanley's health improved dramatically. Impressed by the beauty of the valley and grateful for his recovery, he decided to return every year.\n\nBy the end of the summer of 1903, Stanley had acquired property in Estes Park and, with the help of English architect Henry \"Lord Cornwallis\" Rogers whose acquaintance the Stanleys had recently made, he began the construction of Rockside, his home in Colorado. Completed in 1905, the Stanley cottage was built with four bedrooms, gracious living areas and a modern kitchen, so that Flora could entertain summer guests. Stanley, whose primary leisure activities involved billiards, violins and steam cars, designed a basement with space for a billiard table and a detached garage with a violin workshop and a turntable, so that the steam car could exit front-wise rather than in reverse. The front door opened onto a veranda facing south with a view across the Estes Valley towards [[Long's Peak]]. Dr. Charles Bonney apparently approved of his patient's design choices and included images of the house in his book, ''Pulmonary Tuberculosis and Its Complications'' of 1908. It remains standing today west of the Stanley Hotel as a private home.\n\n[[File:Stanley in Snow.JPG|thumb|left|[[The Stanley Hotel]] in [[Estes Park, CO]]]]By 1907, Stanley had all but recovered and he returned to Newton for the winter rather than Denver. However, he and Flora had become enamored with the beauty of the Colorado mountains, often comparing them in speeches with those \"rock-ribbed\" hills \"ancient as the sun\" of [[William Cullen Bryant]]'s ''[[Thanatopsis]]''. Not content with the rustic accommodations, lazy pastimes and relaxed social scene of their new home, Stanley resolved to turn Estes Park into a resort town. In 1907, construction began on the [[Stanley Hotel|Hotel Stanley]], a grand hotel catering to the class of wealthy urbanites who composed the Stanleys' social circle in Newton.<ref name=usparks/> Construction was steel frame with clapboarding on a granite foundation. Although executed to Stanley's specifications, the structure was built with the professional aid of Denver architect, [[Theilman Robert Weiger]].\n\nTo power the new hotel, Stanley constructed the Fall River Hydro-Plant which consequentially brought electricity to Estes Park for the first time. Upon opening, the hotel had 48 guest rooms, each pair sharing one bathroom. It had a fully electric kitchen and steam laundry, a hydraulic elevator, and electric lights and telephones throughout. Near the main structure, Freelan built a Concert Hall complete with a Steinway Grand Piano as a gift for Flora. During the day, Guests at the Stanley enjoyed golf, bowling, horseback-riding and motor excursions. At night, guests enjoyed formal dinners, concerts and lighter entertainment such as billiards. The steam car played a pivotal role in the operation of the Stanley Hotel. To transport visitors to and from the hotel, Stanley created a twelve-seat model which was thereafter marketed as the \"Mountain Wagon\" and became popular at other resorts such as those near present-day [[Olympic National Park]] in the [[State of Washington]].\n\n[[File:Enosmillsportrait.jpg|thumb|right|[[Enos Mills]], naturalist. father of [[Rocky Mountain National Park]]]]\nStanley's presence and the construction of his hotel provided enormous impetus to the Town of Estes Park which incorporated as a city in 1917. In 1904, Stanley organized and partially funded the paving of the Big Thompson Canyon Road (today US 34) to Loveland and, in 1907, the paving of the St. Vrain Road (today US 36). From 1906, he was president of the Protective and Improvement Association and from 1907, first president of the Estes Park Bank. In 1908, he had purchased the vast ranch lands of [[Windham Wyndham-Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl|Lord Dunraven]], comprising most of the valley, which he gradually gifted to the town. His largest grant, given in 1936, once called Stanley Park, now comprises the man-made Lake Estes (formed by Olympus Dam 1947-48) the fairgrounds (1941) and present high school campus.\n\nStanley is often remembered for his role in the creation of the [[Rocky Mountain National Park]]. As president of the Protective and Improvement Association, Stanley became keenly aware that the charms of the Estes Valley lay in its natural environs and its wildlife. To prevent the gradual destruction of these by increasing numbers of tourists and sportsmen, he organized the establishment of the Fall River Fish Hatchery (1907) and the introduction of a herd of [[Wapiti|Wapiti Elk]] from [[Yellowstone National Park]] in 1913 (the offspring of whom are now abundant in the Estes Valley). Most importantly, he forged a deep friendship with naturalist [[Enos Mills]] who ran the rustic [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Larimer County, Colorado|Long's Peak Inn]]. With Stanley's encouragement and financial support, Mills traveled the country campaigning for the protection of the Rockies of North-Central Colorado. In 1915, [[Woodrow Wilson]] signed the order establishing [[Rocky Mountain National Park]], the tenth in US history and, today, the fifth most-visited out of fifty-eight. Stanley and Mills were both present at the dedication ceremony.\n\nIn 1926, the hotel was sold to the Stanley Corporation, a private company established to manage Freelan's assets in Estes Park. Without Stanley's fortune to pad the annual budget, the corporation soon filed for bankruptcy. Stanley purchased the hotel back at a low price and passed it off again in 1930 to fellow auto and hotel magnate Roe Emery of Denver who would remain the owner until 1947. Although he no longer managed the hotel, Stanley continued to reside each summer at Rockside, his cottage nearby.\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Kingfield High School, Kingfield, ME.jpg|thumb|left|Stanley School, [[Kingfield, Maine]], f. 1903. Today, the Stanley Museum.]]\nAfter adopting Estes Park as his summer home, Stanley turned more from his eastern business ventures and toward philanthropy and the management of his [[Stanley Hotel|hotel]]. In 1903, the year he first went to Colorado to treat his tuberculosis, he endowed the construction of a new high school in his old hometown of [[Kingfield, Maine]] which remains standing today as a museum dedicated to Stanley's life. In 1905, the [[dry plate]] company was sold to [[Eastman Kodak]] and the Stanley brothers focused their attention on the [[Stanley Motor Carriage Company]]. By 1917, at the age of 68, Freelan and Francis were ready for retirement and stepped down from management. That year, [[Francis Edgar Stanley|Francis]] and his wife Augusta were able to visit his brother's property in Estes Park for the first time. The following year, Francis was killed tragically while driving a Stanley automobile on a country road near [[Wenham, Massachusetts]]. In 1918, F.O. Stanley sold his interests in the motor carriage company to his nephew-in-law, Prescott Warren who carried on with the production of steam-powered vehicles until the company's closure in 1926.\n\nStanley served on many boards and committees. He was a trustee of [[Hebron Academy]] from 1911 and president of the board from 1914 until his death. He endowed the school with funds to build, in 1926, Stanley Arena, the first enclosed high school hockey rink in the nation where future pro-hockey players [[Eddie Jeremiah]] ([[Boston Bruins]]) and Danny Sullivan ([[Hershey Bears]]) would play for Hebron as student athletes. From 1913, he was a trustee of the Maine State Sanatorium Association. In Estes Park, he served as president of numerous organizations working tirelessly to improve and develop the town.\n\nIn 1933, his own steam-powered car having long been out-competed by combustion-powered models, F.O. Stanley called upon [[Henry Ford]], who now dominated the automobile industry, at [[Ford River Rouge Complex|his factory]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. During the visit, Ford bought several Stanley violins.\n\nBy 1926, Flora Stanley's eyesight had deteriorated to such a point that she was no longer comfortable in places she didn't know well. Although the Stanleys continued to travel between Newton and Estes Park, Freelan began to think of retirement from public life, selling his hotel. In 1939, while in Estes Park, Flora suffered a stroke and died soon thereafter at their Colorado home, Rockside. The next year Stanley returned to Estes Park for the summer but maintained an inconspicuous presence. Shortly after his return to [[Newton, MA|Newton]] in 1940, Stanley died on October 2 of heart failure.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Freelan O. Stanley.

His age was 91. He had returned ten days ago from Colorado, where he spent the Summer. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=October 3, 1940 |accessdate=2008-07-03 }}</ref>\n\n==Personal characteristics==\nRaised in a [[Scottish reformation|Calvinist]] household in the [[Maine Law|tee-totaling State of Maine]], Stanley did not drink alcoholic beverages. Nor did he smoke cigars, unlike many men of his day, having survived tuberculosis. He was discreet in his religious and political affiliations. Stanley wrote a letter to the ''Newton Graphic'' in 1902 criticizing Christian Science and expressing some negative opinions about orthodox interpretations of scripture. If Stanley held religious beliefs at all, it is likely that he was a modernist christian who shared the attitudes espoused by  biblical scholar [[Charles Augustus Briggs]] in his controversial address to the [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]] in 1876. Stanley's upbringing gave him a love of practical knowledge as well as an appreciation for music and poetry which he enjoyed throughout his life. His favorite pastimes were bowling, playing billiards and working in his violin shop. The results of a bowling tournament held at the Hunnewell Club, published in the Newton Graphic, show Stanley placed first and his twin brother in 8th place. He was fiscally conservative and insisted on paying and being paid in cash. He was devoted to his wife Flora to whom he was married for 63 years before her death. They never had children but they remained close to their nieces and nephews and were notoriously kind to the children of Estes Park and those who visited the Stanley Hotel. He was not without a sense of humor, posing for photographs dressed as \"your western man\" in a ten-gallon hat and woolly chaps, or as the \"King of Estes Park\" with a tin canister on his head for a crown, placed there by the local children.\n\n==Architectural designs==\n* 1894, F.O.

Sculptors Sutton Betti and Daniel Glanz won the competition with a sculpture of F.O. Stanley holding one of his violins.  The sculpture was installed and dedicated on September 29, 2016.\n\n==See also==\n'''People'''\n* [[Francis Edgar Stanley]]\n* [[Chansonetta Stanley Emmons]]\n* [[Fred Marriott]]\n* [[John Brisben Walker]]\n* [[George Eastman]]\n'''Places'''\n* [[Kingfield, ME]]\n* [[Newton, MA]]\n* [[Estes Park, CO]]\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Franklin County, Maine]]\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Larimer County, Colorado]]\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Newton, Massachusetts]]\n'''Institutions'''\n* [[Stanley Motor Carriage Company]]\n* [[Mobile Company of America]]\n* [[Locomobile Company of America]]\n* [[Stanley Hotel]]\n* [[Rocky Mountain National Park]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.stanleymuseum.org/ The Stanley Museum]\n*[http://www.stanleymotorcarriage.com/patents/FE%20&%20FO%20Stanley%20Patents.htm Stanley Brothers' patents]\n*[http://www.newtonma.gov/civicax/filebank/documents/31181/ Newton Corner Historic Walking Tour]\n*[https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/76000191/ Amos G.
