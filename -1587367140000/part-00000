Most of the current prison buildings date from [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] times. The current prison was designated a [[Dispersal prison]] in 1966 and is the oldest of the Dispersal prisons still operating across England and Wales.\n\nThe [[English Dialect Dictionary]] noted references to ''Wakefield'' were often short for referring to the long-standing prison (e.g. \"being sent to Wakefield\" meant being sent to prison).<ref>''English Dialect Dictionary part 6'' (1905), Joseph Wright, page 364</ref>\n\n===\"Here We Go 'Round the Mulberry Bush\"===\nThe exercise yard at Wakefield had a [[List of plants known as mulberry|mulberry]] tree, around which female inmates used to exercise.

Accommodation at the prison comprises single-occupancy cells with integral sanitation. All residential units have kitchens available for offenders to prepare their own meals. An Incentives and Earned Privileges system allows standard and enhanced offenders the opportunity of in-cell TV. All offenders are subject to mandatory drugs testing and there are voluntary testing arrangements, which are compulsory for all offenders employed, for example as wing cleaners or kitchen workers.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\nHMP Wakefield offers a range of activities for inmates, including charity work, an accredited course in industrial cleaning, and a Braille shop where offenders convert books to Braille. The Education Department is operated by [[The Manchester College]], and offers learning opportunities ranging from basic skills to [[Open University]] courses. Other facilities include a prison shop, [[gym]], and multi-faith [[chaplaincy]].\n\nA prison inspection in 2018 found that Wakefield Prison was on the whole calm, secure, decent and well managed.  The rest of the prison service could learn good practise from Wakefield.  Despite the above prisoners needing psychiatric care face unacceptable delays before they are transferred to secure psychiatric hospitals and prisoners' mental condition worsens while they are waiting for transfer.  [[Peter Clarke (police officer)|Peter Clarke]] said, \"Because of the totally unacceptable delays in doing so, many prisoners across the prison estate are held in conditions that are not in any way therapeutic and indeed in many cases clearly exacerbate their condition. (...) The situation at Wakefield was yet another example of prisoners with severe illness not receiving the care that they needed.\" Inspectors noted a prisoner who was \"exceptionally challenging to manage and had complex needs that could not be met in the prison. While staff attempted to manage him positively and constructively, his condition was deteriorating during a lengthy wait to be admitted to a secure hospital,\" according to the inspection report.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/01/inspectors-warn-of-worsening-conditions-for-mentally-ill-inmates Inspectors warn of worsening conditions for mentally ill inmates] ''[[The Guardian]].'' 1 November 2018</ref>\n\n==Notable inmates==\n===Current===\n*[[Ian Watkins (Lostprophets singer)|Ian Watkins]] \u2013 Former lead singer and lyricist of the band the [[Lostprophets]], convicted of several sex offences, some involving children and [[infants]].

The current prison was designated a [[Dispersal prison]] in 1966 and is the oldest of the Dispersal prisons still operating across England and Wales.\n\nThe [[English Dialect Dictionary]] noted references to ''Wakefield'' were often short for referring to the long-standing prison (e.g. \"being sent to Wakefield\" meant being sent to prison).<ref>''English Dialect Dictionary part 6'' (1905), Joseph Wright, page 364</ref>\n\n===\"Here We Go 'Round the Mulberry Bush\"===\nThe exercise yard at Wakefield had a [[List of plants known as mulberry|mulberry]] tree, around which female inmates used to exercise.

Accommodation at the prison comprises single-occupancy cells with integral sanitation. All residential units have kitchens available for offenders to prepare their own meals. An Incentives and Earned Privileges system allows standard and enhanced offenders the opportunity of in-cell TV. All offenders are subject to mandatory drugs testing and there are voluntary testing arrangements, which are compulsory for all offenders employed, for example as wing cleaners or kitchen workers.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\nHMP Wakefield offers a range of activities for inmates, including charity work, an accredited course in industrial cleaning, and a Braille shop where offenders convert books to Braille. The Education Department is operated by [[The Manchester College]], and offers learning opportunities ranging from basic skills to [[Open University]] courses. Other facilities include a prison shop, [[gym]], and multi-faith [[chaplaincy]].\n\nA prison inspection in 2018 found that Wakefield Prison was on the whole calm, secure, decent and well managed.  The rest of the prison service could learn good practise from Wakefield.  Despite the above prisoners needing psychiatric care face unacceptable delays before they are transferred to secure psychiatric hospitals and prisoners' mental condition worsens while they are waiting for transfer.  [[Peter Clarke (police officer)|Peter Clarke]] said, \"Because of the totally unacceptable delays in doing so, many prisoners across the prison estate are held in conditions that are not in any way therapeutic and indeed in many cases clearly exacerbate their condition. (...) The situation at Wakefield was yet another example of prisoners with severe illness not receiving the care that they needed.\" Inspectors noted a prisoner who was \"exceptionally challenging to manage and had complex needs that could not be met in the prison. While staff attempted to manage him positively and constructively, his condition was deteriorating during a lengthy wait to be admitted to a secure hospital,\" according to the inspection report.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/01/inspectors-warn-of-worsening-conditions-for-mentally-ill-inmates Inspectors warn of worsening conditions for mentally ill inmates] ''[[The Guardian]].'' 1 November 2018</ref>\n\n==Notable Inmates==\n===Current===\n*[[Ian Watkins (Lostprophets singer)|Ian Watkins]] \u2013 Former lead singer and lyricist of the band the [[Lostprophets]], convicted of several sex offences, some involving children and [[infants]].

A distinctly Australian poet but also a poet of the world, Tredinnick has been described as 'one of our great poets of place\u2014not just of geographic place, but of the spiritual and moral landscapes as well\u2014a Whitmanesque Emily Dickinson of the southern hemisphere.' Tredinnick's 'artlessly beautiful poetry' has won for him in recent years, as well as the international prizes, a number of major Australian awards\u2014[[Blake Poetry Prize|The Blake]] and [[Newcastle Poetry Prize|Newcastle Prizes]], among them, and a Premier's Literature Prize (for Fire Diary). His poems 'work elegantly and intimately over a huge terrain.' Tredinnick's poetry is poetry of witness: small moments, epiphanies, weather, birds, children, the divine comedy of everyday life, the \u2018beautiful struggle, the ordinary trouble\u2019 we find ourselves in, the beauty and peril of the natural world.\n\n\"I am a fool for places,\" Tredinnick has written, \"and for the vulgar, semantic music of sentences. I have grown deeply attached to the physicality and mystery of landforms and language. To the country people inhabit\u2014and which sometimes inhabits them\u2014and to the words people use to speak their truths and falsehoods.\"\n\nTredinnick also says: \"We need words and country more than we seem to remember; our futures may depend, now more than ever, on how well we use and how healthy we keep them both. Because I believe this, and because I cannot help it, my work often wanders the syntax of places and it tries the ecology of sentences; I want to hear and I\u2019d like to say what the land seems to know\u2014about us, I mean, and about itself and time and how we might use well what little we have.\"\n\nTredinnick's poetry explores \u2018ancient themes\u2014especially the theme of our human relationship with landscape\u2019, [[Andrew Motion|Sir Andrew Motion]] has written. Tredinnick's concern to divine both language and landscape and the way they interact led to his doctoral work on nature writing, completed in 2003, at the [[University of Western Sydney]]. Although he hasn't pursued an academic career, Tredinnick could be understood, in and beyond his poetry, as an ecocritic. He has written and spoken widely and often on [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s theme: \u201cin wildness is the preservation of the world.\u201d His doctorate Writing the Wild: Place, Prose, and the Ecological Imagination became his second book, ''The Land\u2019s Wild Music'' (2004), and with Professor Kate Rigby, he cofounded the Australian chapter of the Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment. His poetry and nature writing have been the focus of doctoral work and scholarship, in particular in China, where ecocriticism is a strong emergent field of academic work.\n\nAlong with his volumes of poetry\u2014 ''Bluewren Cantos'' (2013), ''Fire Diary'' (2010), ''The Lyrebird'' (2011), and ''The Road South'' (spoken word CD, 2008)\u2014 ''Tredinnick's thirteen books include the landscape memoir,''  ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009), ''four books on the writing craft, including'', ''The Little Red Writing Book'' (2006), and ''Australian Love Poems,'' which he edited in 2013.\n\nA bilingual (Chinese/English) selection of his poems (''The Lyrebird'') is due out late in 2014, along with his third collection of poems, ''Body Copy.'' He is working on a memoir of a reading life, Reading Slowly at the End of Time (2015).\n\n[[File:Mark Tredinnick.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick no longer lives with his family along the Wingecarribee River, southwest of Sydney. He spends much of his time teaching and consulting in the city. Although his daily writing practice is poetry (\"poetry is most of what I write now; it is how I live\", he has said), Tredinnick continues to write essays, criticism, reviews, and other prose, from his desk in a cowshed outside Bowral. He spent a long writing apprenticeship in prose, and published several prose books and hundreds of essays, before his first poems were published in the early 2005. As well as poetry workshops, Tredinnick teaches literary journalism, creative writing, and creative nonfiction at the [[University of Sydney]], and he has three times been a judge of the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards|NSW Premier's Prize]] in the nonfiction category,  [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards#Douglas Stewart Prize for Non-Fiction|Douglas Stewart Prize]]. Tredinnick's work, The Blue Plateau, an extended lyric essay on the life of one place on earth, won the [[Queensland Premier's Literary Awards|Queensland Premier's Literary Award]] in 2010 and was shortlisted for the Prime Minister's Literary Award the same year. Novelist Tony Birch nominated it as the one book he would give to anyone coming to Australia; 'it captures,' he said, 'what belonging to this antipodean place means and has meant through time.\u2019\nDrawing on his writing guides\u2014''The Little Red Writing Book, The Little Green Grammar Book'' and (with Geoff Whyte) ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing''\u2014Tredinnick also works with organisations in the government, education and private sectors to help them write with economy and grace. \nTredinnick's poetry and essays are widely anthologised and published in journals, blogs and newspapers, in Australia and internationally. and it has appeared in journals including Australian Book Review, Australian Poetry, Contrappasso, [[Eureka Street (magazine)|Eureka Street]], Island, Isotope, Magma, Mascara, Meanjin, New Welsh Review, Orion, PAN, [[Poetry London]], The Scotsman, Southerly, Wet Ink, The Wonderbook of Poetry, and [[World Literature Today]]. \nFor nearly twenty years, Tredinnick has taught and lectured poetry, creative nonfiction, grammar, nature writing, and composition at universities (chiefly the University of Sydney). He has been a guest of many literary and poetry festivals around the world, including the Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney, Perth, Oxford, and Ubud Festivals, and the Ottawa Poetry Festival (VerseFest). He has spent teaching residencies at the Universities of Alaska, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, the University of Aberystwyth and the [[University of Wales]], [[University of Wales, Trinity Saint David|Trinity Saint David]].\n\nIn the [[2020 Australia Day Honours]] Tredinnick was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for \"service to literature, and to education\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/2005311|title=Dr Mark Tredinnick|last=|first=|date=|website=honours.pmc.gov.au|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\nTredinnick, the grandson of Methodist minister, Wesley Tredinnick, the second of four sons of Bruce and Heather Tredinnick, was born in Epping, in suburban Sydney.  He went to primary school at North Epping Public School and won a bursary to [[Barker College]], Hornsby, an Anglican private school, where he completed his schooling in 1979. He took a double degree (with Honours) in Arts and Law at the University of Sydney University, majoring in history, and taking courses in philosophy, in addition to law.  In the last year of his degree, Tredinnick worked part-time as a paralegal for Allen Allen & Hemsley, before accepting a clerkship with Mallesons Stephen Jaques, one of Sydney's leading law firms. Tredinnick worked as a solicitor with Mallesons for a year, before moving into book publishing, where he stayed for nearly a decade; he worked as an editor and publisher at Butterworths, Allen & Unwin and HarperCollins. Tredinnick says of those years: \u2018they were part of my education as a writer, of course; I was learning what a sentence was; I was practising grammar and learning about design; I was learning what it took, the years and years sometimes, to make a book and to make it good enough to share.\u2019   \nTredinnick left the corporate world and began to write and teach writing (and some courses in leadership and organizational studies in Politics at the [[University of Sydney]]).\nIt was from Katoomba and a small apartment in Lavender Bay that Tredinnick wrote and published his first poems and won his first prizes. Tredinnick also travelled North America and worked on his doctoral thesis, a study of nature writing and an attempt to retheorise the capacity of prose to represent landscapes and the more than merely human world\u2014to 'catch the lyric of country', as he puts it. Tredinnick took his doctorate in 2003 and his thesis was published in 2005\n\nTredinnick's first book, an edited collection of nature writing essays from Australian and North America, ''A Place on Earth'', came out in 2003 in Australia (2004 in the United States). After that came ''The Land's Wild Music'' in 2005; ''The Little Red Writing Book'' in 2006; ''The Little Green Grammar Book'' in 2008; ''Writing Well'' (an adaptation of ''The Little Red Writing Book'' for the international market) also in 2008); ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009 in Australia; 2010 in the United States); ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing'' (with Geoff Whyte) in 2010; ''Australia's Wild Weather'' in 2011.\n\nTredinnick's first collection of poems, ''The Road South'', appeared as a spoken-word CD in 2008. His first volume of poems was Fire Diary, published in late 2010. That was followed by ''The Lyrebird'', a chapbook, in 2011 and ''Bluewren Cantos'' in 2013.\n\n[[File:10171025 634856153236106 2660669453524416387 n.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick's emergence as a poet was marked by a string of major Australian prizes, in particular the Newcastle Poetry Prize in 2007 and the Blake Poetry Prize in 2009. His work became better known outside Australia when he won the inaugural Montreal International Poetry Prize in 2011 and the Cardiff Prize the next year. In Australia, he won the Newcastle Prize second time in 2011 and took out some significant literary prizes for his books: the Queensland Premier's Literary Prize 2010 for ''The Blue Plateau'' and the West Australian Premier's Prize 2011 for ''Fire Diary''.\n\nIn 2013 he edited Australian Love Poems for a start-up literary press, Inkerman & Blunt. [[Pitt Street Poetry]], who published his second volume of poems, ''Bluewren Cantos'' in December 2013, released a second edition of ''Fire Diary'' early the following year.\n\nTredinnick's works and days\u2014the difficult dance between the silence of the desk, the higher frequencies of family life, the demands of earning a living to \"finance the silence\", as he puts it, and feed the family\u2014are discussed in a long interview he gave to ''Perilous Adventures'' magazine in 2010, and are glossed in a number of his poems, in particular \"Insolvency\", \"Eclogues\", and \"The Economics of Spring\" (in ''Fire Diary'').\n\n==Style==\n\nTredinnick's poetry often employs a long, stepped-down line. Poetry is an \"architecture of utterance\", he has said, \"a sculpture of voice.\" And his poems, though informal in voice, present themselves as small geographies, places, language worlds both sonic and visual. Although his architectures resemble sometimes the sestets of Charles Wright, whose influence and kinship Tredinnick has acknowledged, unlike Wright, Tredinnick's syntax is often complex, his sentences long, \"breathtakingly fluent\" (as Sinead Morrissey has put it), deltaic. His poetry, though painstakingly made and precise, is expansive, pushing against the forms it employs. Commenting on the tension between minute details and grandiosity, Australian novelist Greg Day has called him a \"failed minimalist.\" Bluewren Cantos, Mark's latest book of poetry, is praised as \"A gentle mix of the sublime and the mundane, so that we are invited to let such dualisms be undone in us.\"<ref>Anne Elvey, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014.</ref> The critic Michelle Borzi finds that Tredinnick's \"habit of relying on atmospheric image-making and self-intrusive references to impel the lines is a defining attribute of the poetry throughout ''Fire Diary''.\"<ref>[http://southerlyjournal.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/73.1_LP-Michelle-Borzi.pdf]</ref>\n\nTredinnick described his essays once as \"half chat, half chant\", and his poetic voice lies, similarly, between conversation and song. Informality is a key to his lyric. \nHe has named poets John Keats and Gerard Manley Hopkins, Emily Dickinson, Mary Oliver, Jane Kenyon, and Seamus Heaney, Robert Gray, Dylan Thomas, and Charles Wright, as influences and teachers. He also cites Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, and Debussy, and painters Van Gogh and Matisse. And the voices of lyric prose writers play in Tredinnick's poetry, as in his prose: Michael Ondaatje, Joan Didion, Barry Lopez, Peter Matthiessen, David Malouf, and Cormac McCarthy.\n\nTalking specifically of ''Bluewren Cantos'', poet and critic Jean Kent neatly summarises Tredinnick's poetics, including the way his work nearly always starts in place, but reaches out toward intimacy with a loved one, with the dead, with that which is most human in each of us.<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\n\"Like the singing of birds, it all feels artlessly beautiful, but only because of the exceptional art, which keeps the music of what\u2019s being said mesmerising. Behind the flowing lines and hypnotic melodies, there is as much control of the rhythm and counterpoint and harmony as there is in any of the compositions by Bach or Mozart or Debussy, composers who compete with all the real birds in Mark\u2019s Wingecarribee landscape.  Even before he began publishing poetry, Mark was renowned as a nature writer. His sensitivity to place and his ability to celebrate the Australian landscape are special joys in all his poems.\nOften, Mark\u2019s poems begin with nature \u2013 but invariably the solitary presence of the poet reaches out to another person \u2013 often a loved person \u2013 or, in an intimate connection, to the reader.\nThis is poetry like tightrope walking \u2013 a nonchalant, though thoughtful, ambling out into the world, which almost leads us into a transcendental state \u2013 only to be caught in a web of emotion and thought and connections to the daily reality of living. Tredinnick\u2019s poems are also full of playful paradoxes and wry humour.  His tone may be debonair, well-dressed and conscious of manners and historical allegiances, but for all the hypnotic oratory, his voice is both questing and self-deprecating, and the earth he walks over is emphatically today\u2019s.\"<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\nPoet Anne Elvey has said that Tredinnick \"Weaves the tropes of attentiveness to the other, mortality, and finitude, together with his wry humour, to tell a loving engagement with place, persons and otherkind. This is poetry as blessing. It is a poetics of witness.\"<ref>Anne Elvey, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014.</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\n'''Books'''\n\nWestern Australian Premier's Book Award (winner, poetry), 2011: ''Fire Diary''\n\nQueensland Premier's Literary Awards (winner, nonfiction), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n                                                                                            \nPrime Minister's Literary Awards (shortlisted), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n\nACT Book of the Year (shortlisted), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n\nAlec Bolton (ACT Arts prize for unpublished manuscript) (highly commended), 2010: ''Fire Diary''\n\n\n'''Poetry'''\n\n'''1<sup>st</sup> Prize'''\n\nRon Petty Poetry Prize, winner 2017: \u201cPanic Very Softly, Love\u201d\n\nACU Prize for Literature, winner 2016: \u201cThe Horse\u201d\n\nCardiff International Poetry Prize, winner 2012: \u201cMargaret River Sestets\u201d\n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, winner 2011: \u201cWalking Underwater\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, winner 2011: \u201cThe Wombat Vedas\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, winner 2008: \u201cHave You Seen\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, winner 2007: \u201cEclogues\u201d\n\nGwen Harwood Poetry Prize, winner 2005: \u201cThe Child & Time\u201d\n\n\n'''2<sup>nd</sup> Prize'''\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, second 2018: \u201cThe River Running Shallow\u201d\n\nACU Prize for Literature, second 2013: \u201cLight Years\u201d\n\nJosephine Ulrick Poetry Prize, runner up 2009: \u201cRed Tulips\u201d\n\n\n'''3<sup>rd</sup> Prize''' \n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, third 2019: \u201cOctober Morning After Rain\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, third 2013: \u201cTwo or Three Days in late October with Claude Debussy\u201d        \n\n'''Shortlisted''' \n\nABR (now Peter Porter) Poetry Prize, short listed 2019: \u201cRaven\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2019: \u201cThe Blue Pasture\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2019: \u201cThe News\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2019: \u201cGrace, and a Barking Owl\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2018: \u201cThe Reservoir\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2018: \u201cGrief Wears a Body\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2016: \u201cShred\u201d \n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2016: \u201cEnd of Lonely Day\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cWeeding\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cSpring Snow, Reno\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2013: \u201cFaith\u201d \n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2013: \u201cThe Reader\u201d\n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2011: \u201cThe Kingfisher\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2011: \u201cAt Home on a Sunday Trying to Find Nothing to Do\u201d\n\nABR (now Peter Porter) Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2005: \u201cUbirr Rock\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cThe Propinquity of Snow\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cThe Propinquity of Snow\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cNightfishing\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2009: \u201cBrisbane River Blues\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2008: \u201cWindflowers\u201d \n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2006: \u201cLake St Clair Cycle\u201d\n\n\n\n'''Longlisted'''\n\nUniversity of Canberra Vice-Chancellor\u2019s International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2014: \u201cWalking My Name Back Home\u201d \n\nUniversity of Canberra Vice-Chancellor\u2019s International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2014: \u201cThat Day\u201d \n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2011:\"You Over There;

A distinctly Australian poet but also a poet of the world, Tredinnick has been described as 'one of our great poets of place\u2014not just of geographic place, but of the spiritual and moral landscapes as well\u2014a Whitmanesque Emily Dickinson of the southern hemisphere.' Tredinnick's 'artlessly beautiful poetry' has won for him in recent years, as well as the international prizes, a number of major Australian awards\u2014[[Blake Poetry Prize|The Blake]] and [[Newcastle Poetry Prize|Newcastle Prizes]], among them, and a Premier's Literature Prize (for Fire Diary). His poems 'work elegantly and intimately over a huge terrain.' Tredinnick's poetry is poetry of witness: small moments, epiphanies, weather, birds, children, the divine comedy of everyday life, the \u2018beautiful struggle, the ordinary trouble\u2019 we find ourselves in, the beauty and peril of the natural world.\n\n\"I am a fool for places,\" Tredinnick has written, \"and for the vulgar, semantic music of sentences. I have grown deeply attached to the physicality and mystery of landforms and language. To the country people inhabit\u2014and which sometimes inhabits them\u2014and to the words people use to speak their truths and falsehoods.\"\n\nTredinnick also says: \"We need words and country more than we seem to remember; our futures may depend, now more than ever, on how well we use and how healthy we keep them both. Because I believe this, and because I cannot help it, my work often wanders the syntax of places and it tries the ecology of sentences; I want to hear and I\u2019d like to say what the land seems to know\u2014about us, I mean, and about itself and time and how we might use well what little we have.\"\n\nTredinnick's poetry explores \u2018ancient themes\u2014especially the theme of our human relationship with landscape\u2019, [[Andrew Motion|Sir Andrew Motion]] has written. Tredinnick's concern to divine both language and landscape and the way they interact led to his doctoral work on nature writing, completed in 2003, at the [[University of Western Sydney]]. Although he hasn't pursued an academic career, Tredinnick could be understood, in and beyond his poetry, as an ecocritic. He has written and spoken widely and often on [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s theme: \u201cin wildness is the preservation of the world.\u201d His doctorate Writing the Wild: Place, Prose, and the Ecological Imagination became his second book, ''The Land\u2019s Wild Music'' (2004), and with Professor Kate Rigby, he cofounded the Australian chapter of the Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment. His poetry and nature writing have been the focus of doctoral work and scholarship, in particular in China, where ecocriticism is a strong emergent field of academic work.\n\nAlong with his volumes of poetry\u2014 ''Bluewren Cantos'' (2013), ''Fire Diary'' (2010), ''The Lyrebird'' (2011), and ''The Road South'' (spoken word CD, 2008)\u2014 ''Tredinnick's thirteen books include the landscape memoir,''  ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009), ''four books on the writing craft, including'', ''The Little Red Writing Book'' (2006), and ''Australian Love Poems,'' which he edited in 2013.\n\nA bilingual (Chinese/English) selection of his poems (''The Lyrebird'') is due out late in 2014, along with his third collection of poems, ''Body Copy.'' He is working on a memoir of a reading life, Reading Slowly at the End of Time (2015).\n\n[[File:Mark Tredinnick.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick no longer lives with his family along the Wingecarribee River, southwest of Sydney. He spends much of his time teaching and consulting in the city. Although his daily writing practice is poetry (\"poetry is most of what I write now; it is how I live\", he has said), Tredinnick continues to write essays, criticism, reviews, and other prose, from his desk in a cowshed outside Bowral. He spent a long writing apprenticeship in prose, and published several prose books and hundreds of essays, before his first poems were published in the early 2005. As well as poetry workshops, Tredinnick teaches literary journalism, creative writing, and creative nonfiction at the [[University of Sydney]], and he has three times been a judge of the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards|NSW Premier's Prize]] in the nonfiction category,  [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards#Douglas Stewart Prize for Non-Fiction|Douglas Stewart Prize]]. Tredinnick's work, The Blue Plateau, an extended lyric essay on the life of one place on earth, won the [[Queensland Premier's Literary Awards|Queensland Premier's Literary Award]] in 2010 and was shortlisted for the Prime Minister's Literary Award the same year. Novelist Tony Birch nominated it as the one book he would give to anyone coming to Australia; 'it captures,' he said, 'what belonging to this antipodean place means and has meant through time.\u2019\nDrawing on his writing guides\u2014''The Little Red Writing Book, The Little Green Grammar Book'' and (with Geoff Whyte) ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing''\u2014Tredinnick also works with organisations in the government, education and private sectors to help them write with economy and grace. \nTredinnick's poetry and essays are widely anthologised and published in journals, blogs and newspapers, in Australia and internationally. and it has appeared in journals including Australian Book Review, Australian Poetry, Contrappasso, [[Eureka Street (magazine)|Eureka Street]], Island, Isotope, Magma, Mascara, Meanjin, New Welsh Review, Orion, PAN, [[Poetry London]], The Scotsman, Southerly, Wet Ink, The Wonderbook of Poetry, and [[World Literature Today]]. \nFor nearly twenty years, Tredinnick has taught and lectured poetry, creative nonfiction, grammar, nature writing, and composition at universities (chiefly the University of Sydney). He has been a guest of many literary and poetry festivals around the world, including the Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney, Perth, Oxford, and Ubud Festivals, and the Ottawa Poetry Festival (VerseFest). He has spent teaching residencies at the Universities of Alaska, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, the University of Aberystwyth and the [[University of Wales]], [[University of Wales, Trinity Saint David|Trinity Saint David]].\n\nIn the [[2020 Australia Day Honours]] Tredinnick was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for \"service to literature, and to education\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/2005311|title=Dr Mark Tredinnick|last=|first=|date=|website=honours.pmc.gov.au|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\nTredinnick, the grandson of Methodist minister, Wesley Tredinnick, the second of four sons of Bruce and Heather Tredinnick, was born in Epping, in suburban Sydney.  He went to primary school at North Epping Public School and won a bursary to [[Barker College]], Hornsby, an Anglican private school, where he completed his schooling in 1979. He took a double degree (with Honours) in Arts and Law at the University of Sydney University, majoring in history, and taking courses in philosophy, in addition to law.  In the last year of his degree, Tredinnick worked part-time as a paralegal for Allen Allen & Hemsley, before accepting a clerkship with Mallesons Stephen Jaques, one of Sydney's leading law firms. Tredinnick worked as a solicitor with Mallesons for a year, before moving into book publishing, where he stayed for nearly a decade; he worked as an editor and publisher at Butterworths, Allen & Unwin and HarperCollins. Tredinnick says of those years: \u2018they were part of my education as a writer, of course; I was learning what a sentence was; I was practising grammar and learning about design; I was learning what it took, the years and years sometimes, to make a book and to make it good enough to share.\u2019   \nTredinnick left the corporate world and began to write and teach writing (and some courses in leadership and organizational studies in Politics at the [[University of Sydney]]).\nIt was from Katoomba and a small apartment in Lavender Bay that Tredinnick wrote and published his first poems and won his first prizes. Tredinnick also travelled North America and worked on his doctoral thesis, a study of nature writing and an attempt to retheorise the capacity of prose to represent landscapes and the more than merely human world\u2014to 'catch the lyric of country', as he puts it. Tredinnick took his doctorate in 2003 and his thesis was published in 2005\n\nTredinnick's first book, an edited collection of nature writing essays from Australian and North America, ''A Place on Earth'', came out in 2003 in Australia (2004 in the United States). After that came ''The Land's Wild Music'' in 2005; ''The Little Red Writing Book'' in 2006; ''The Little Green Grammar Book'' in 2008; ''Writing Well'' (an adaptation of ''The Little Red Writing Book'' for the international market) also in 2008); ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009 in Australia; 2010 in the United States); ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing'' (with Geoff Whyte) in 2010; ''Australia's Wild Weather'' in 2011.\n\nTredinnick's first collection of poems, ''The Road South'', appeared as a spoken-word CD in 2008. His first volume of poems was Fire Diary, published in late 2010. That was followed by ''The Lyrebird'', a chapbook, in 2011 and ''Bluewren Cantos'' in 2013.\n\n[[File:10171025 634856153236106 2660669453524416387 n.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick's emergence as a poet was marked by a string of major Australian prizes, in particular the Newcastle Poetry Prize in 2007 and the Blake Poetry Prize in 2009. His work became better known outside Australia when he won the inaugural Montreal International Poetry Prize in 2011 and the Cardiff Prize the next year. In Australia, he won the Newcastle Prize second time in 2011 and took out some significant literary prizes for his books: the Queensland Premier's Literary Prize 2010 for ''The Blue Plateau'' and the West Australian Premier's Prize 2011 for ''Fire Diary''.\n\nIn 2013 he edited Australian Love Poems for a start-up literary press, Inkerman & Blunt. [[Pitt Street Poetry]], who published his second volume of poems, ''Bluewren Cantos'' in December 2013, released a second edition of ''Fire Diary'' early the following year.\n\nTredinnick's works and days\u2014the difficult dance between the silence of the desk, the higher frequencies of family life, the demands of earning a living to \"finance the silence\", as he puts it, and feed the family\u2014are discussed in a long interview he gave to ''Perilous Adventures'' magazine in 2010, and are glossed in a number of his poems, in particular \"Insolvency\", \"Eclogues\", and \"The Economics of Spring\" (in ''Fire Diary'').\n\n==Style==\n\nTredinnick's poetry often employs a long, stepped-down line. Poetry is an \"architecture of utterance\", he has said, \"a sculpture of voice.\" And his poems, though informal in voice, present themselves as small geographies, places, language worlds both sonic and visual. Although his architectures resemble sometimes the sestets of Charles Wright, whose influence and kinship Tredinnick has acknowledged, unlike Wright, Tredinnick's syntax is often complex, his sentences long, \"breathtakingly fluent\" (as Sinead Morrissey has put it), deltaic. His poetry, though painstakingly made and precise, is expansive, pushing against the forms it employs. Commenting on the tension between minute details and grandiosity, Australian novelist Greg Day has called him a \"failed minimalist.\" Bluewren Cantos, Mark's latest book of poetry, is praised as \"A gentle mix of the sublime and the mundane, so that we are invited to let such dualisms be undone in us.\"<ref>Anne Elvey, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014.</ref> The critic Michelle Borzi finds that Tredinnick's \"habit of relying on atmospheric image-making and self-intrusive references to impel the lines is a defining attribute of the poetry throughout ''Fire Diary''.\"<ref>[http://southerlyjournal.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/73.1_LP-Michelle-Borzi.pdf]</ref>\n\nTredinnick described his essays once as \"half chat, half chant\", and his poetic voice lies, similarly, between conversation and song. Informality is a key to his lyric. \nHe has named poets John Keats and Gerard Manley Hopkins, Emily Dickinson, Mary Oliver, Jane Kenyon, and Seamus Heaney, Robert Gray, Dylan Thomas, and Charles Wright, as influences and teachers. He also cites Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, and Debussy, and painters Van Gogh and Matisse. And the voices of lyric prose writers play in Tredinnick's poetry, as in his prose: Michael Ondaatje, Joan Didion, Barry Lopez, Peter Matthiessen, David Malouf, and Cormac McCarthy.\n\nTalking specifically of ''Bluewren Cantos'', poet and critic Jean Kent neatly summarises Tredinnick's poetics, including the way his work nearly always starts in place, but reaches out toward intimacy with a loved one, with the dead, with that which is most human in each of us.<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\n\"Like the singing of birds, it all feels artlessly beautiful, but only because of the exceptional art, which keeps the music of what\u2019s being said mesmerising. Behind the flowing lines and hypnotic melodies, there is as much control of the rhythm and counterpoint and harmony as there is in any of the compositions by Bach or Mozart or Debussy, composers who compete with all the real birds in Mark\u2019s Wingecarribee landscape.  Even before he began publishing poetry, Mark was renowned as a nature writer. His sensitivity to place and his ability to celebrate the Australian landscape are special joys in all his poems.\nOften, Mark\u2019s poems begin with nature \u2013 but invariably the solitary presence of the poet reaches out to another person \u2013 often a loved person \u2013 or, in an intimate connection, to the reader.\nThis is poetry like tightrope walking \u2013 a nonchalant, though thoughtful, ambling out into the world, which almost leads us into a transcendental state \u2013 only to be caught in a web of emotion and thought and connections to the daily reality of living. Tredinnick\u2019s poems are also full of playful paradoxes and wry humour.  His tone may be debonair, well-dressed and conscious of manners and historical allegiances, but for all the hypnotic oratory, his voice is both questing and self-deprecating, and the earth he walks over is emphatically today\u2019s.\"<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\nPoet Anne Elvey has said that Tredinnick \"Weaves the tropes of attentiveness to the other, mortality, and finitude, together with his wry humour, to tell a loving engagement with place, persons and otherkind. This is poetry as blessing. It is a poetics of witness.\"<ref>Anne Elvey, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014.</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\n'''Books'''\n\nWestern Australian Premier's Book Award (winner, poetry), 2011: ''Fire Diary''\n\nQueensland Premier's Literary Awards (winner, nonfiction), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n                                                                                            \nPrime Minister's Literary Awards (shortlisted), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n\nACT Book of the Year (shortlisted), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n\nAlec Bolton (ACT Arts prize for unpublished manuscript) (highly commended), 2010: ''Fire Diary''\n\n\n'''Poetry'''\n\n'''1<sup>st</sup> Prize'''\n\nRon Petty Poetry Prize, winner 2017: \u201cPanic Very Softly, Love\u201d\n\nACU Prize for Literature, winner 2016: \u201cThe Horse\u201d\n\nCardiff International Poetry Prize, winner 2012: \u201cMargaret River Sestets\u201d\n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, winner 2011: \u201cWalking Underwater\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, winner 2011: \u201cThe Wombat Vedas\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, winner 2008: \u201cHave You Seen\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, winner 2007: \u201cEclogues\u201d\n\nGwen Harwood Poetry Prize, winner 2005: \u201cThe Child & Time\u201d\n\n\n'''2<sup>nd</sup> Prize'''\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, second 2018: \u201cThe River Running Shallow\u201d\n\nACU Prize for Literature, second 2013: \u201cLight Years\u201d\n\nJosephine Ulrick Poetry Prize, runner up 2009: \u201cRed Tulips\u201d\n\n\n'''3<sup>rd</sup> Prize''' \n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, third 2019: \u201cOctober Morning After Rain\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, third 2013: \u201cTwo or Three Days in late October with Claude Debussy\u201d    \n\n'''Shortlisted''' \n\nABR (now Peter Porter) Poetry Prize, short listed 2019: \u201cRaven\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2019: \u201cThe Blue Pasture\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2019: \u201cThe News\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2019: \u201cGrace, and a Barking Owl\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2018: \u201cThe Reservoir\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2018: \u201cGrief Wears a Body\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2016: \u201cShred\u201d \n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2016: \u201cEnd of Lonely Day\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cWeeding\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cSpring Snow, Reno\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2013: \u201cFaith\u201d \n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2013: \u201cThe Reader\u201d\n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2011: \u201cThe Kingfisher\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2011: \u201cAt Home on a Sunday Trying to Find Nothing to Do\u201d\n\nABR (now Peter Porter) Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2005: \u201cUbirr Rock\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cThe Propinquity of Snow\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cThe Propinquity of Snow\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cNightfishing\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2009: \u201cBrisbane River Blues\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2008: \u201cWindflowers\u201d \n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2006: \u201cLake St Clair Cycle\u201d\n\n\n\n'''Longlisted'''\n\nUniversity of Canberra Vice-Chancellor\u2019s International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2014: \u201cWalking My Name Back Home\u201d \n\nUniversity of Canberra Vice-Chancellor\u2019s International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2014: \u201cThat Day\u201d \n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2011:\"You Over There;

With encouragement from community activists in south [[Minneapolis]], the Minneapolis city government hired Dworkin and MacKinnon to draft an antipornography civil rights ordinance as an amendment to the Minneapolis city civil rights ordinance.\n\nThe amendment defined pornography as a civil rights violation against women, and allowed women who claimed harm from pornography to [[lawsuit|sue]] the producers and distributors in [[Civil law (common law)|civil court]] for damages.

She identifies the book a revolutionary act, an expression of a \"commitment to ending male dominance\" in all its cultural and social manifestations.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dworkin|first=Andrea|title=Woman Hating|publisher=Plume|year=1974|isbn=978-0525474234|location=New York, NY|pages=17}}</ref> The introduction offers a complex understanding of women's lives. She describes the impossibility of a revolution for women if women with privilege and comfort are not willing to give up each in solidarity with women not so entitled. She recognizes that women occupy multiple positions: of oppression, privilege, and peril, such that one may stand on the freedom of other women and men, or be in more danger for one's ethnicity than one's sex. This is a white and Jewish feminist articulation of a new theory that, fifteen years later, was comprehensively presented as \"intersectionality\" by [[Kimberl\u00e9 Williams Crenshaw]], in 1989.\n\nThe guts of the book, its primary thesis, is that a male supremacist ideology requires female subordination and negation. She endeavors to reveal how it suffuses society, how it becomes mythic, religious. She extracts and analyzes themes in Western fairy tales and pornography, in Pauline Reage's ''[[Story of O|The Story of O]]'', in ''The Image'' by [[Catherine Robbe-Grillet|Jean de Berg]]. Whether in literature for children or adults, in cultural products portending to be fantasy, she finds the same epistemology: women are either Good or Evil. Either way they are to be ruled by men, spheres of existence severely limited, in mobility such as through foot binding, or snuffed out entirely, such as through witch burning. \n\nThe last section of the book she explores [[Androgyny]] in myths and religions across the globe to \"discern another ontology, one which discards the fiction that there are two polar distinct sexes.\" She was not alone in this endeavor. Dworkin's exploration exists in a Western literary lineage that includes ''Orlando'', by [[Virginia Woolf]], and ''[[Woman on the Edge of Time]]'', by [[Marge Piercy]]. In the final chapter, she examines sexual similarities, hermaphroditism, parthenogenesis, pansexuality, homosexuality, transsexuality, transvestism, bestiality, incest, the family, and children. About this chapter she reflects on her own theorizing as problematic, existing outside of girls' and women's lived experience: \"I think there are a lot of things really wrong with the last chapter of ''Woman Hating'',\" said Dworkin in an interview with Cindy Jenefsky for her book, ''Without Apology: Andrea Dworkin's Art and Politics''. She identifies factors which influenced the chapter: 'years of reading Freud and trying to figure out abstractly what all this was about'... [A]t the time ''Woman Hating'' was written, [there were] roots in the counterculture and the sexual liberation movement.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jenefsky|first=Cindy|title=Without Apology: Andrea Dworkin's Art and Politics|publisher=Westview Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0813318264|location=Boulder, CO|pages=139}}</ref>  \n\nDworkin's work from the early 1980s onward contained frequent condemnations of incest and [[pedophilia]] as one of the chief forms of violence against women, arguing once that \"incest is a crime committed against someone, a crime from which many victims never recover.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin, Letters from a War Zone|pp=139\u2013142, 149, 176\u2013180, 308, 314\u2013315}}; Dworkin, ''Intercourse'', pp. 171, 194; {{harvnb|Dworkin, Life and Death|pp=22\u201323, 79\u201380, 86, 123, 143, 173, 188\u2013189}}</ref> In the early 1980s, she had a public row with her formerly admired friend [[Allen Ginsberg]], with whom she shared godparent status of a mutual friend's child.

She argued that this kind of depiction enforced a male-centric and coercive view of sexuality, and that, when the cultural attitudes combine with the material conditions of women's lives in a [[sexist]] society, the experience of heterosexual intercourse itself becomes a central part of men's subordination of women, experienced as a form of \"occupation\" that is nevertheless expected to be pleasurable for women and to define their very status ''as women''.<ref name=\"UCCB\" />\n\nSuch descriptions are often cited by Dworkin's critics, interpreting the book as claiming \"all\" heterosexual intercourse is rape, or more generally that the anatomical mechanics of sexual intercourse make it intrinsically harmful to women's equality.

More broadly, Nussbaum faults Dworkin for (1) occluding economic injustice through an \"obsessive focus on sexual subordination\", (2) reproducing [[objectification]] in reducing her interlocutors to their abuse, and (3) refusing reconciliation in favor of \"violent extralegal resistance against male violence.\"<ref>Nussbaum, Martha C. \"Rage and Reason.\" ''The New Republic.''

In the fall of 1983, MacKinnon secured a one-semester appointment for Dworkin at the [[University of Minnesota]], to teach a course in literature for the [[Women's Studies]] program and co-teach (with MacKinnon) an interdepartmental course on pornography, where they hashed out details of a civil rights approach. With encouragement from community activists in south [[Minneapolis]], the Minneapolis city government hired Dworkin and MacKinnon to draft an antipornography civil rights ordinance as an amendment to the Minneapolis city civil rights ordinance.\n\nThe amendment defined pornography as a civil rights violation against women, and allowed women who claimed harm from pornography to [[lawsuit|sue]] the producers and distributors in [[Civil law (common law)|civil court]] for damages. The law was passed twice by the Minneapolis city council, but vetoed both times by Mayor Don Fraser, who considered the wording of the ordinance to be too vague.<ref>{{cite book |author=Donald Alexander Downs |title=The New Politics of Pornography |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1989 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newpoliticsofpor0000down/page/34 34\u201365] |isbn=978-0-226-16162-4 |chapter=The Minneapolis Ordinance and the Feminist Theory of Pornography and Sexuality |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=4h4rpVBqtMgC&pg=PA34 |url=https://archive.org/details/newpoliticsofpor0000down/page/34 }}</ref> Another version of the ordinance passed in [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]], in 1984, but was overturned as [[United States Constitution|unconstitutional]] under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]] in the case ''[[American Booksellers v.

She identifies the book a revolutionary act, an expression of a \"commitment to ending male dominance\" in all its cultural and social manifestations.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dworkin|first=Andrea|title=Woman Hating|publisher=Plume|year=1974|isbn=978-0525474234|location=New York, NY|pages=17}}</ref> The introduction offers a complex understanding of women's lives. She describes the impossibility of a revolution for women if women with privilege and comfort are not willing to give up each in solidarity with women not so entitled. She recognizes that women occupy multiple positions: of oppression, privilege, and peril, such that one may stand on the freedom of other women and men, or be in more danger for one's ethnicity than one's sex. This is a white and Jewish feminist articulation of a new theory that, fifteen years later, was comprehensively presented as \"intersectionality\" by [[Kimberl\u00e9 Williams Crenshaw]], in 1989.\n\nThe guts of the book, its primary thesis, is that a male supremacist ideology requires female subordination and negation. She endeavors to reveal how it suffuses society, how it becomes mythic, religious. She extracts and analyzes themes in Western fairy tales and pornography, in Pauline Reage's ''[[Story of O|The Story of O]]'', in ''The Image'' by [[Catherine Robbe-Grillet|Jean de Berg]]. Whether in literature for children or adults, in cultural products portending to be fantasy, she finds the same epistemology: women are either Good or Evil. Either way they are to be ruled by men, spheres of existence severely limited, in mobility such as through foot binding, or snuffed out entirely, such as through witch burning. \n\nThe last section of the book she explores [[Androgyny]] in myths and religions across the globe to \"discern another ontology, one which discards the fiction that there are two polar distinct sexes.\" She was not alone in this endeavor. Dworkin's exploration exists in a Western literary lineage that includes ''Orlando'', by [[Virginia Woolf]], and ''[[Woman on the Edge of Time]]'', by [[Marge Piercy]]. In the final chapter, she examines sexual similarities, hermaphroditism, parthenogenesis, pansexuality, homosexuality, transsexuality, transvestism, bestiality, incest, the family, and children. About this chapter she reflects on her own theorizing as problematic, existing outside of girls' and women's lived experience: \"I think there are a lot of things really wrong with the last chapter of ''Woman Hating'',\" said Dworkin in an interview with Cindy Jenefsky for her book, ''Without Apology: Andrea Dworkin's Art and Politics''. She made referenced factors which influenced the chapter: 'years of reading Freud and trying to figure out abstractly what all this was about'... [A]t the time ''Woman Hating'' was written, [there were] roots in the counterculture and the sexual liberation movement.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jenefsky|first=Cindy|title=Without Apology: Andrea Dworkin's Art and Politics|publisher=Westview Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0813318264|location=Boulder, CO|pages=139}}</ref>  \n\nDworkin's work from the early 1980s onward contained frequent condemnations of incest and [[pedophilia]] as one of the chief forms of violence against women, arguing once that \"incest is a crime committed against someone, a crime from which many victims never recover.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin, Letters from a War Zone|pp=139\u2013142, 149, 176\u2013180, 308, 314\u2013315}}; Dworkin, ''Intercourse'', pp. 171, 194; {{harvnb|Dworkin, Life and Death|pp=22\u201323, 79\u201380, 86, 123, 143, 173, 188\u2013189}}</ref> In the early 1980s, she had a public row with her formerly admired friend [[Allen Ginsberg]], with whom she shared godparent status of a mutual friend's child.

She argued that this kind of depiction enforced a male-centric and coercive view of sexuality, and that, when the cultural attitudes combine with the material conditions of women's lives in a [[sexist]] society, the experience of heterosexual intercourse itself becomes a central part of men's subordination of women, experienced as a form of \"occupation\" that is nevertheless expected to be pleasurable for women and to define their very status ''as women''.<ref name=\"UCCB\" />\n\nSuch descriptions are often cited by Dworkin's critics, interpreting the book as claiming \"all\" heterosexual intercourse is rape, or more generally that the anatomical mechanics of sexual intercourse make it intrinsically harmful to women's equality.

More broadly, Nussbaum faults Dworkin for (1) occluding economic injustice through an \"obsessive focus on sexual subordination\", (2) reproducing [[objectification]] in reducing her interlocutors to their abuse, and (3) refusing reconciliation in favor of \"violent extralegal resistance against male violence.\"<ref>Nussbaum, Martha C. \"Rage and Reason.\" ''The New Republic.''

When only one nickname is listed, it is used for teams of both sexes. (Note that in recent years, many schools have chosen to use the same nickname for men's and women's teams even when the nickname is distinctly masculine.) When two nicknames are given, the first is used for men's teams and the other is used for women's teams. Different nicknames for a specific sport within a school are noted separately below the table.\n**Full name of school.\n**Location of school.\n**Conference of the school (if conference column is left blank, the school is either independent or the conference is unknown).\n*Apart from the ongoing conversions, the following notes apply:\n**Following the normal standard of U.S. sports media, the terms \"University\" and \"College\" are ignored in alphabetization, unless necessary to distinguish schools (such as Boston College and Boston University) or are actually used by the media in normally describing the school (formerly the case for the College of Charleston, but that school's sports program is now called simply \"Charleston\").\n**Schools are also alphabetized by the names they are most commonly referred to by sports media, with non-intuitive examples included in parentheses next to the school name. This means, for example, that campuses bearing the name \"University of North Carolina\" may variously be found at \"C\" (Charlotte), \"N\" (North Carolina, referring to the Chapel Hill campus), and \"U\" (the Asheville, Greensboro, Pembroke, and Wilmington campuses, all normally referred to as UNC-<nowiki/>{campus name}).\n**The prefix \"St.\", as in \"Saint\", is alphabetized as if it were spelled out.\n\n==[[NCAA]]==\n\n===[[NCAA Division I|Division I]]===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! rowspan=3|Team !! rowspan=3|School !! rowspan=3|City !! rowspan=3|Conference !! colspan=7|Sport sponsorship\n|-\n! rowspan=2|Foot-<br/>ball !! colspan=2|Basketball !! rowspan=2|Base-<br/>ball !! rowspan=2|Soft-<br/>ball !! colspan=2|Soccer\n|-\n!

When only one nickname is listed, it is used for teams of both sexes. (Note that in recent years, many schools have chosen to use the same nickname for men's and women's teams even when the nickname is distinctly masculine.) When two nicknames are given, the first is used for men's teams and the other is used for women's teams. Different nicknames for a specific sport within a school are noted separately below the table.\n**Full name of school.\n**Location of school.\n**Conference of the school (if conference column is left blank, the school is either independent or the conference is unknown).\n*Apart from the ongoing conversions, the following notes apply:\n**Following the normal standard of U.S. sports media, the terms \"University\" and \"College\" are ignored in alphabetization, unless necessary to distinguish schools (such as Boston College and Boston University) or are actually used by the media in normally describing the school (formerly the case for the College of Charleston, but that school's sports program is now called simply \"Charleston\").\n**Schools are also alphabetized by the names they are most commonly referred to by sports media, with non-intuitive examples included in parentheses next to the school name. This means, for example, that campuses bearing the name \"University of North Carolina\" may variously be found at \"C\" (Charlotte), \"N\" (North Carolina, referring to the Chapel Hill campus), and \"U\" (the Asheville, Greensboro, Pembroke, and Wilmington campuses, all normally referred to as UNC-<nowiki/>{campus name}).\n**The prefix \"St.\", as in \"Saint\", is alphabetized as if it were spelled out.\n\n==[[NCAA]]==\n\n===[[NCAA Division I|Division I]]===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! rowspan=3|Team !! rowspan=3|School !! rowspan=3|City !! rowspan=3|Conference !! colspan=7|Sport sponsorship\n|-\n! rowspan=2|Foot-<br/>ball !! colspan=2|Basketball !! rowspan=2|Base-<br/>ball !! rowspan=2|Soft-<br/>ball !! colspan=2|Soccer\n|-\n!
