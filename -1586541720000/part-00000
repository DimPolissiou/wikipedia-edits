They compete in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of the [[English football league system]]. The club's home ground is the 30,750-capacity<ref name=\"auto\"/> [[Falmer Stadium]], situated in [[Falmer]] to the north east of the city. UP THE PALACE SE25! WE\u2019RE THE BOYS FROM SOUTH EAST LONDON AND WE\u2019LL ALWAYS FOLLOW YOU\n\nFounded in 1901, and nicknamed the \"Seagulls\" or \"[[Albion]]\", Brighton played their early professional football in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], before being elected to the [[English Football League|Football League]] in 1920. The club enjoyed greatest prominence between 1979 and 1983 when they played in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and reached the [[1983 FA Cup Final]], losing to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] after a replay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1983.htm|title=1983 FA Cup Final|publisher=Fa-CupFinals.co.uk|accessdate=6 September 2011}}</ref> They were relegated from the First Division in the same season.\n\nBy the late 1990s, Brighton was in the fourth tier of English football and were having financial difficulties. After narrowly avoiding relegation from the Football League to the [[National League (English football)|Conference]] in 1997, a boardroom takeover saved the club from liquidation. Successive [[Promotion and relegation|promotions]] in 2001 and 2002 brought Brighton back to the second tier, and in 2011, the club moved into the Falmer Stadium after 14 years without a permanent home ground. In the [[2016\u201317 EFL Championship|2016\u201317 season]], Brighton finished second in the [[EFL Championship]] and were thus promoted to the Premier League, ending a 34-year absence from the top flight.\n\n==History==\n{{recentism|date=May 2018}}\n{{main|History of Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.}}\n[[File:Dick Knight - Falmer opening.jpg|thumb|right|Former Brighton chairman [[Dick Knight (businessman)|Dick Knight]] who ultimately saved the club]]\n===Formation and early years (1901\u20131972)===\nBrighton & Hove Albion F.C. were founded in 1901 and 19 years later, in 1920, they were elected to [[the Football League]]'s new [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] \u2013 having previously been members of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]. In the Southern League they won their only national honour to date, the [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]], which at that time was contested by the champions of the Southern League, and the Football League, by defeating Football League Champions [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.talkfootball.co.uk/guides/brighton_and_hove_albion_history.html Brighton & Hove Albion] ''Talk Football''. Retrieved 9 August 2011</ref>\n\n===Mike Bamber years (1972\u20131987)===\nMike Bamber was the chairman of Brighton from October 1972 until 1983. He famously brought [[Brian Clough]] to the club in 1973 and later appointed former England player [[Alan Mullery]] as manager. Brighton's life as a [[the Football League|Football League]] club had brought little in the way of success and headlines until 1979, when, under Mullery's management, they were [[Promotion and relegation|promoted]] to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] as [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] [[runners-up]]. The 1982/83 season saw a wildly inconsistent start for the club, with victories over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] mixed in with heavy defeats. Manager Mike Bailey eventually lost his job at the start of December 1982. [[Jimmy Melia]] took over as manager, but was unable to turn the situation around and Brighton, after four seasons in the top flight, were relegated in 1983, finishing in last place.\n\nDespite their relegation, that season Brighton reached their first (and only to date) [[FA Cup]] final and drew 2\u20132 with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the first match. Brighton's goals were scored by [[Gordon Smith (footballer born December 1954)|Gordon Smith]] and [[Gary Stevens (footballer, born 1962)|Gary Stevens]]. The final featured an infamous \"miss\" by Gordon Smith with virtually the last kick of the game in extra time, prompting the [[BBC]] commentator Peter Jones to utter the well-known phrase \"...and Smith must score\".  However, Smith's kick was saved by the Manchester United goalkeeper, [[Gary Bailey]]. In the replay, Manchester United won 4\u20130.\n\n===Brief revival, relegation and last years at the Goldstone (1987\u20131997)===\nAfter four seasons, relegation to Division Three came in 1987, but the Albion bounced back the next season. In 1991 they lost the play-off final at Wembley to Notts County 3\u20131, only to be relegated the next season to the newly named Division Two. In 1996 further relegation came to Division Three. The club's financial situation was becoming increasingly precarious, and the club's directors decided that the [[Goldstone Ground]] would have to be sold to pay off some of the club's huge debts. Manager [[Jimmy Case]] was sacked after a very poor start to the 1996\u201397 season saw Brighton stuck at the bottom of the league by a considerable margin. The club's directors appointed a relative unknown in [[Steve Gritt]], the former joint manager of [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. Brighton's league form steadily improved under Gritt, although their improving chances of survival were put under further threat by a two-point deduction imposed as punishment for a pitch invasion by fans who were protesting against the sale of the [[Goldstone Ground|Goldstone]] ground. A lifelong fan named [[Dick Knight (businessman)|Dick Knight]] took control of the club in 1997 having led the fan pressure to oust the previous board following their sale of the club's Goldstone Ground to property developers.\n\nBy the last day of the season, after being 13 points adrift at one stage, they were off the bottom of the table and had to play the team directly below them, [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] \u2013 the game was in their hands. If Brighton won or drew, they would be safe. Brighton defender [[Kerry Mayo]] scored an own goal in the first half and it looked as though their 77-year league career was over. But a late goal from [[Robbie Reinelt]] ensured that Brighton retained their league status on goals scored (despite Hereford having a better goal difference as, in the Football League at the time, goals scored took precedence), and Hereford's 25-year league run was instead over.\n\n===Ups and Downs and takeover (1997\u20132011)===\nThe sale of the Goldstone Ground went through in 1997, leading to Brighton having to play some 70 miles away at Gillingham's [[Priestfield Stadium|Priestfield]] stadium for two seasons. [[Micky Adams]] was appointed Brighton's manager in 1999. For the start of the 1999\u20132000 season the Seagulls secured a lease to play home games at [[Withdean Stadium]], a converted athletics track in Brighton owned by the [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local council]]. 2000\u201301 was Brighton's first successful season for 13 years. They were crowned champions of [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] and promoted to [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]]. Adams left in October 2001 to work as [[Dave Bassett]]'s assistant at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester]], being replaced by former Leicester manager [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]]. The transition proved to be a plus point for Brighton, who maintained their good form and ended the season as [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] champions \u2013 winning a second successive [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]]. Just five years after almost succumbing to the double threat of losing their [[the Football League|Football League]] status and going out of business completely, Brighton were one division away from the [[Premier League]].\n\nIn May 2009, Knight was replaced as chairman at Brighton by [[Tony Bloom]], who successfully secured \u00a393&nbsp;million funding for the new [[Falmer Stadium]] and 75% shareholding at the club.<ref>[http://www.seagulls.co.uk/page/Latest/0,,10433~1661154,00.html Stadium Funding Secured] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522111808/http://www.seagulls.co.uk/page/Latest/0%2C%2C10433~1661154%2C00.html |date=22 May 2009 }}, Brighton & Hove Albion F.C., 18 May 2009.

The following season, Brighton changed their crest to a design similar to the crest used from the 1970s to the 1990s. This was to reflect on the club returning home after not having a stadium since 1997.\n\n===Move to new stadium and promotion under Hughton (2011\u20132017)===\nThe [[Falmer Stadium]] hosted its first league match on the opening day of the 2011\u201312 season against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]], who were the last opposition to play at the [[Goldstone Ground|Goldstone]] in 1997. The game finished 2\u20131 to Albion. The 2012\u201313 season saw Brighton finish 4th and lose in the play-off semi-finals to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. Poyet was suspended as manager following controversial comments made in his post-match interview,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/brighton-hove-albion/10062910/Brighton-and-Hove-Albion-suspend-manager-Gus-Poyet-for-an-alleged-breach-of-contract.html|title=Brighton & Hove Albion suspend manager Gus Poyet for an alleged breach of contract|journal=Daily Telegraph|last=Percy|first=John|date=2013-05-16|access-date=2019-08-03|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> and was later sacked as manager and replaced by [[Oscar Garcia Junyent|Oscar Garcia]].\n\nOn the final day of the 2013\u201314 season, Brighton beat [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] 2\u20131 with a last minute winner from [[Leonardo Ulloa]] to secure a 6th-place finish. After losing to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] in the play-offs semi-finals, Garc\u00eda resigned. Ex-Liverpool defender [[Sami Hyypi\u00e4]] was appointed manager for the 2014\u201315 season but resigned after four months and was replaced by former Norwich manager [[Chris Hughton]]. In the following campaign Brighton went on a 22-game unbeaten run from the opening day to 19 December when they lost 3\u20130 at home to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. On the final day of the season Brighton travelled to Middlesbrough and needed to win to secure promotion to the [[Premier League]], but a 1\u20131 draw meant 3rd and a play-off place, where defeat to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] was Brighton's third playoff semi-final defeat in four seasons.\n\nBrighton started 2016\u201317 with an 18-match unbeaten run, taking them to the top of the league for much of December and January. They remained in the automatic promotion positions for most of the rest of the season, and clinched promotion to the Premier League after a 2\u20131 win against Wigan Athletic at home on 17 April 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39549523|title=Brighton 2\u20131 Wigan|work=BBC Sport|date=17 April 2017}}</ref> They broke their transfer record multiple times throughout the summer window, with the previous club record signing of [[Jos\u00e9 Heriberto Izquierdo Mena|Jose Izquierdo]] commanding a fee reported to be over \u00a313&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40885839|title=Jose Izquierdo: Brighton sign Colombian winger in club record deal|work=BBC Sport|date=20 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Back in the top flight (2017\u2013present)===\nBrighton's first season back in the [[Premier League]] was largely successful, with the club rising into the top half several times in the season. Despite falling to one point above the relegation zone in January, victories over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the final months of the campaign helped secure a finish of 15th.\n\nBrighton\u2019s second season in the [[Premier League]] was inconsistent. Despite a promising start, the team had a disastrous second half of the season, achieving just 3 wins in their last 18 games. In the FA Cup, Brighton reached the semi-finals for the first time since 1983, losing 1-0 to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. Albion ultimately survived relegation with a 17th place finish, but Hughton was sacked following the end of the season due to the poor run of results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11718928/chris-hughton-sacked-by-brighton|title=Chris Hughton sacked by Brighton after four-and-a-half years as manager|website=Sky Sports}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Hughton's sacking, Swansea manager [[Graham Potter]] was appointed as the new manager on a four year contract.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48340989|title=Graham Potter appointed new Brighton manager after leaving Swansea|date=20 May 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk|work=BBC Sport}}</ref>.

The board of directors paid \u00a37&nbsp;million of this; the other \u00a32.5&nbsp;million had to be raised from the operations of the club. In an effort to achieve this, a fund-raising appeal known as the ''Alive and Kicking Fund'' was started, with everything from nude [[Christmas Card]]s featuring the players to a CD single being released to raise cash. On 9 January 2005 this fund-raising single '[[Tom Hark (We Want Falmer)|Tom Hark]]' went straight in at number 17 in the UK chart, gaining it national airplay on [[BBC Radio 1]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/4160559.stm|title=Brighton fans single makes top 20|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 September 2011|date=10 January 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Falmer Stadium===\n[[File:Falmer Stadium - League debut 2.jpg|thumb|Brighton fans at [[Falmer Stadium]] during the first league game at the stadium against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]]]]\n\n'''[[Falmer Stadium]]''' (currently known for sponsorship reasons as '''American Express Community Stadium''', '''Amex Stadium''') is a stadium located in Village Way, Brighton BN1 9BL.\n\nOn 28 October 2005, the [[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]] announced that the application for Falmer had been successful, much to the joy and relief of all the fans. [[Lewes (district)|Lewes District Council]] contested [[John Prescott]]'s decision to approve planning permission for Falmer, forcing a [[judicial review]]. This was based on a minor error in Prescott's original approval which neglected to state that some car parking for the stadium is in the Lewes district as opposed to the Brighton & Hove unitary authority. This caused further delay. Once the judicial review ruled in favour of the stadium, Lewes District Council said that it would not launch any further appeals.\n\nBuilding of [[Falmer Stadium]] started in December 2008.

They compete in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of the [[English football league system]]. The club's home ground is the 30,750-capacity<ref name=\"auto\"/> [[Falmer Stadium]], situated in [[Falmer]] to the north east of the city.\n\nFounded in 1901, and nicknamed the \"Seagulls\" or \"[[Albion]]\", Brighton played their early professional football in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], before being elected to the [[English Football League|Football League]] in 1920. The club enjoyed greatest prominence between 1979 and 1983 when they played in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and reached the [[1983 FA Cup Final]], losing to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] after a replay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1983.htm|title=1983 FA Cup Final|publisher=Fa-CupFinals.co.uk|accessdate=6 September 2011}}</ref> They were relegated from the First Division in the same season.\n\nBy the late 1990s, Brighton was in the fourth tier of English football and were having financial difficulties. After narrowly avoiding relegation from the Football League to the [[National League (English football)|Conference]] in 1997, a boardroom takeover saved the club from liquidation. Successive [[Promotion and relegation|promotions]] in 2001 and 2002 brought Brighton back to the second tier, and in 2011, the club moved into the Falmer Stadium after 14 years without a permanent home ground. In the [[2016\u201317 EFL Championship|2016\u201317 season]], Brighton finished second in the [[EFL Championship]] and were thus promoted to the Premier League, ending a 34-year absence from the top flight.\n\n==History==\n{{recentism|date=May 2018}}\n{{main|History of Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.}}\n[[File:Dick Knight - Falmer opening.jpg|thumb|right|Former Brighton chairman [[Dick Knight (businessman)|Dick Knight]] who ultimately saved the club]]\n===Formation and early years (1901\u20131972)===\nBrighton & Hove Albion F.C. were founded in 1901 and 19 years later, in 1920, they were elected to [[the Football League]]'s new [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] \u2013 having previously been members of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]. In the Southern League they won their only national honour to date, the [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]], which at that time was contested by the champions of the Southern League, and the Football League, by defeating Football League Champions [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.talkfootball.co.uk/guides/brighton_and_hove_albion_history.html Brighton & Hove Albion] ''Talk Football''. Retrieved 9 August 2011</ref>\n\n===Mike Bamber years (1972\u20131987)===\nMike Bamber was the chairman of Brighton from October 1972 until 1983. He famously brought [[Brian Clough]] to the club in 1973 and later appointed former England player [[Alan Mullery]] as manager. Brighton's life as a [[the Football League|Football League]] club had brought little in the way of success and headlines until 1979, when, under Mullery's management, they were [[Promotion and relegation|promoted]] to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] as [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] [[runners-up]]. The 1982/83 season saw a wildly inconsistent start for the club, with victories over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] mixed in with heavy defeats. Manager Mike Bailey eventually lost his job at the start of December 1982. [[Jimmy Melia]] took over as manager, but was unable to turn the situation around and Brighton, after four seasons in the top flight, were relegated in 1983, finishing in last place.\n\nDespite their relegation, that season Brighton reached their first (and only to date) [[FA Cup]] final and drew 2\u20132 with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the first match. Brighton's goals were scored by [[Gordon Smith (footballer born December 1954)|Gordon Smith]] and [[Gary Stevens (footballer, born 1962)|Gary Stevens]]. The final featured an infamous \"miss\" by Gordon Smith with virtually the last kick of the game in extra time, prompting the [[BBC]] commentator Peter Jones to utter the well-known phrase \"...and Smith must score\".  However, Smith's kick was saved by the Manchester United goalkeeper, [[Gary Bailey]]. In the replay, Manchester United won 4\u20130.\n\n===Brief revival, relegation and last years at the Goldstone (1987\u20131997)===\nAfter four seasons, relegation to Division Three came in 1987, but the Albion bounced back the next season. In 1991 they lost the play-off final at Wembley to Notts County 3\u20131, only to be relegated the next season to the newly named Division Two. In 1996 further relegation came to Division Three. The club's financial situation was becoming increasingly precarious, and the club's directors decided that the [[Goldstone Ground]] would have to be sold to pay off some of the club's huge debts. Manager [[Jimmy Case]] was sacked after a very poor start to the 1996\u201397 season saw Brighton stuck at the bottom of the league by a considerable margin. The club's directors appointed a relative unknown in [[Steve Gritt]], the former joint manager of [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. Brighton's league form steadily improved under Gritt, although their improving chances of survival were put under further threat by a two-point deduction imposed as punishment for a pitch invasion by fans who were protesting against the sale of the [[Goldstone Ground|Goldstone]] ground. A lifelong fan named [[Dick Knight (businessman)|Dick Knight]] took control of the club in 1997 having led the fan pressure to oust the previous board following their sale of the club's Goldstone Ground to property developers.\n\nBy the last day of the season, after being 13 points adrift at one stage, they were off the bottom of the table and had to play the team directly below them, [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] \u2013 the game was in their hands. If Brighton won or drew, they would be safe. Brighton defender [[Kerry Mayo]] scored an own goal in the first half and it looked as though their 77-year league career was over. But a late goal from [[Robbie Reinelt]] ensured that Brighton retained their league status on goals scored (despite Hereford having a better goal difference as, in the Football League at the time, goals scored took precedence), and Hereford's 25-year league run was instead over.\n\n===Ups and Downs and takeover (1997\u20132011)===\nThe sale of the Goldstone Ground went through in 1997, leading to Brighton having to play some 70 miles away at Gillingham's [[Priestfield Stadium|Priestfield]] stadium for two seasons. [[Micky Adams]] was appointed Brighton's manager in 1999. For the start of the 1999\u20132000 season the Seagulls secured a lease to play home games at [[Withdean Stadium]], a converted athletics track in Brighton owned by the [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local council]]. 2000\u201301 was Brighton's first successful season for 13 years. They were crowned champions of [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] and promoted to [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]]. Adams left in October 2001 to work as [[Dave Bassett]]'s assistant at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester]], being replaced by former Leicester manager [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]]. The transition proved to be a plus point for Brighton, who maintained their good form and ended the season as [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] champions \u2013 winning a second successive [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]]. Just five years after almost succumbing to the double threat of losing their [[the Football League|Football League]] status and going out of business completely, Brighton were one division away from the [[Premier League]].\n\nIn May 2009, Knight was replaced as chairman at Brighton by [[Tony Bloom]], who successfully secured \u00a393&nbsp;million funding for the new [[Falmer Stadium]] and 75% shareholding at the club.<ref>[http://www.seagulls.co.uk/page/Latest/0,,10433~1661154,00.html Stadium Funding Secured] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522111808/http://www.seagulls.co.uk/page/Latest/0%2C%2C10433~1661154%2C00.html |date=22 May 2009 }}, Brighton & Hove Albion F.C., 18 May 2009.

The following season, Brighton changed their crest to a design similar to the crest used from the 1970s to the 1990s. This was to reflect on the club returning home after not having a stadium since 1997.\n\n===Move to new stadium and promotion under Hughton (2011\u20132017)===\nThe [[Falmer Stadium]] hosted its first league match on the opening day of the 2011\u201312 season against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]], who were the last opposition to play at the [[Goldstone Ground|Goldstone]] in 1997. The game finished 2\u20131 to Albion. The 2012\u201313 season saw Brighton finish 4th and lose in the play-off semi-finals to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. Poyet was suspended as manager following controversial comments made in his post-match interview,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/brighton-hove-albion/10062910/Brighton-and-Hove-Albion-suspend-manager-Gus-Poyet-for-an-alleged-breach-of-contract.html|title=Brighton & Hove Albion suspend manager Gus Poyet for an alleged breach of contract|journal=Daily Telegraph|last=Percy|first=John|date=2013-05-16|access-date=2019-08-03|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> and was later sacked as manager and replaced by [[Oscar Garcia Junyent|Oscar Garcia]].\n\nOn the final day of the 2013\u201314 season, Brighton beat [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] 2\u20131 with a last minute winner from [[Leonardo Ulloa]] to secure a 6th-place finish. After losing to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] in the play-offs semi-finals, Garc\u00eda resigned. Ex-Liverpool defender [[Sami Hyypi\u00e4]] was appointed manager for the 2014\u201315 season but resigned after four months and was replaced by former Norwich manager [[Chris Hughton]]. In the following campaign Brighton went on a 22-game unbeaten run from the opening day to 19 December when they lost 3\u20130 at home to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. On the final day of the season Brighton travelled to Middlesbrough and needed to win to secure promotion to the [[Premier League]], but a 1\u20131 draw meant 3rd and a play-off place, where defeat to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] was Brighton's third playoff semi-final defeat in four seasons.\n\nBrighton started 2016\u201317 with an 18-match unbeaten run, taking them to the top of the league for much of December and January. They remained in the automatic promotion positions for most of the rest of the season, and clinched promotion to the Premier League after a 2\u20131 win against Wigan Athletic at home on 17 April 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39549523|title=Brighton 2\u20131 Wigan|work=BBC Sport|date=17 April 2017}}</ref> They broke their transfer record multiple times throughout the summer window, with the previous club record signing of [[Jos\u00e9 Heriberto Izquierdo Mena|Jose Izquierdo]] commanding a fee reported to be over \u00a313&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40885839|title=Jose Izquierdo: Brighton sign Colombian winger in club record deal|work=BBC Sport|date=20 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Back in the top flight (2017\u2013present)===\nBrighton's first season back in the [[Premier League]] was largely successful, with the club rising into the top half several times in the season. Despite falling to one point above the relegation zone in January, victories over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the final months of the campaign helped secure a finish of 15th.\n\nBrighton\u2019s second season in the [[Premier League]] was inconsistent. Despite a promising start, the team had a disastrous second half of the season, achieving just 3 wins in their last 18 games. In the FA Cup, Brighton reached the semi-finals for the first time since 1983, losing 1-0 to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. Albion ultimately survived relegation with a 17th place finish, but Hughton was sacked following the end of the season due to the poor run of results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11718928/chris-hughton-sacked-by-brighton|title=Chris Hughton sacked by Brighton after four-and-a-half years as manager|website=Sky Sports}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Hughton's sacking, Swansea manager [[Graham Potter]] was appointed as the new manager on a four year contract.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48340989|title=Graham Potter appointed new Brighton manager after leaving Swansea|date=20 May 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk|work=BBC Sport}}</ref>.

The board of directors paid \u00a37&nbsp;million of this; the other \u00a32.5&nbsp;million had to be raised from the operations of the club. In an effort to achieve this, a fund-raising appeal known as the ''Alive and Kicking Fund'' was started, with everything from nude [[Christmas Card]]s featuring the players to a CD single being released to raise cash. On 9 January 2005 this fund-raising single '[[Tom Hark (We Want Falmer)|Tom Hark]]' went straight in at number 17 in the UK chart, gaining it national airplay on [[BBC Radio 1]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/4160559.stm|title=Brighton fans single makes top 20|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 September 2011|date=10 January 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Falmer Stadium===\n[[File:Falmer Stadium - League debut 2.jpg|thumb|Brighton fans at [[Falmer Stadium]] during the first league game at the stadium against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]]]]\n\n'''[[Falmer Stadium]]''' (currently known for sponsorship reasons as '''American Express Community Stadium''', '''Amex Stadium''') is a stadium located in Village Way, Brighton BN1 9BL.\n\nOn 28 October 2005, the [[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]] announced that the application for Falmer had been successful, much to the joy and relief of all the fans. [[Lewes (district)|Lewes District Council]] contested [[John Prescott]]'s decision to approve planning permission for Falmer, forcing a [[judicial review]]. This was based on a minor error in Prescott's original approval which neglected to state that some car parking for the stadium is in the Lewes district as opposed to the Brighton & Hove unitary authority. This caused further delay. Once the judicial review ruled in favour of the stadium, Lewes District Council said that it would not launch any further appeals.\n\nBuilding of [[Falmer Stadium]] started in December 2008. On 31 May 2011 the club officially completed the handover and was given the keys to the stadium with an initial capacity of 22,374 seats, signifying the end of 12 years without a home. During January 2012, the club submitted an application to Brighton and Hove City council to increase the stadium capacity by a further 8,000 seats as well as to add additional corporate boxes, new television facilities and a luxury suite.<ref name=expansionjan12>{{cite news| url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/9446804.Albion_s___36_million_plans_to_push_for_Premiership/ |title=Albion's \u00a336&nbsp;million plans to push for Premiership |accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=The Argus|date=2 January 2012}}</ref> This was granted unanimously by Brighton & Hove City Council's planning committee on 25 April 2012.
