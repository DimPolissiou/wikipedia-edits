It has a stone tower above the [[Naos (architecture)|naos]]. Inside the church there are 15th century mural paintings that show [[Iisus]] wearing Romanian traditional clothes. These paintings were made by artist \u015etefan. Later more paintings were added by Simion de Pite\u015fti in the 18th century. \n\nFrom 1566 to the end of the 19th century this building functioned as a [[Reformed Church in Hungary|Calvinist]] church, too. Because of this, the paintings were lime-whited in the 16th century and its belltower has a Hungarian inscription from 1782.\n\nAccording to Romanian historians it is considered that on the setting of the present-day church, there was once a [[Dacians|Dacian]] temple dedicated to [[Zamolxis]], upon which the conquering [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] built a temple dedicated to the god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]. Its present form dates from the beginning of the 12th century. Considering its tradition, it dates from the 4th century AD, and is considered the oldest church in Romania and South East Europe.\n\n== Hypothesis about Densu\u0219 ==\n\nOne of the hypotheses about Densu\u0219 is that it was once a [[pagan]] temple, and to sustain this argument, it is shown that: the [[altar]] of the church is closer to the South than to the East, which would suggest that it was once a pagan [[temple]], because all early Christian houses of worship have the altar pointing towards the East. Other clues are the form of the roof, which, seen from a lateral perspective, has the form of a bird, to be exact a [[dove]], and above the altar there are two stone [[lion]]s, united by their tails. Another hypothesis, based on inscriptions found inside the church, holds that it was originally built as a mausoleum to the Roman general Longinus Maximus. But it is plausible, that the stones with the inscriptions were moved from their original place and were built into the temple later.  \n\nThe most widespread opinion among Romanian historians is that the present Densus church was once a Christianised Roman temple, which is to say a Paleo-Christian church from the 4th to 6th centuries AD and it is also the first church on [[Dacia]]n territory.\n\n==External links==\n* Ciprian Iancu, [http://www.evz.ro/article.php?artid=316132 \"Biserica Densu\u015f, un templu rom\u00e2nesc\"], ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', July 31, 2007\n\n* https://www.arcanum.hu/hu/online-kiadvanyok/Tunderkert-tunderkert-1/megszentelt-kovek-2/szentegyhazas-telepulesek-D0/x-hunyadi-foesperesseg-2161/12-demsus-21A1/\n\n* https://books.google.com/books?id=M8ReAAAAcAAJ&pg=RA1-PA118&lpg=RA1-PA118&dq=demsus+templom&source=bl&ots=r6IAdmxpyl&sig=ACfU3U0dxxTWfnSxEkI_c3MfHPrMEU30eA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiGkcOsgfXgAhWqxaYKHb2_D8U4ChDoATAHegQIBxAB#v=onepage&q=demsus%20templom&f=false\n\n{{commons|Category:Densu\u015f church|Densu\u015f church}}\n\n{{coord|45|34|57|N|22|48|19|E|region:RO_source:kolossus-huwiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Densus Church}}\n[[Category:Romanian Orthodox churches in Romania]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Hunedoara County]]\n[[Category:Historic monuments in Hunedoara County]]\n[[Category:13th-century Eastern Orthodox church buildings]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=November 2012}}\n[[File:XIII century church from Densu\u015f.jpg|thumb|250px|The Densu\u0219 church]]\n[[File:Densus Church Inscription 2011.jpg|thumb|250px|Roman inscription in the church's yard]]\nThe '''Densu\u0219 Church''' (also known as '''[[Saint Nicholas|St Nicholas]]' Church''') in the village of [[Densu\u0219]], [[Hunedoara County]], [[Romania]] is one of the oldest Romanian churches still standing.\n\nIt was built in its present form in the 13th century on the site of a 2nd-century [[Roman temple]], with some materials from the [[Dacia]]n [[Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa|Sarmizegetusa]] fortress.

{"title_page": "AltiVec", "text_new": "{{POWER, PowerPC, and Power ISA}}\n'''AltiVec''' is a single-precision [[floating point]] and integer [[SIMD]] [[instruction set]] designed and owned by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[IBM]], and [[Freescale Semiconductor]] (formerly [[Motorola]]'s Semiconductor Products Sector) &mdash; the [[AIM alliance]].  It is implemented on versions of the [[PowerPC]] processor architecture, including Motorola's [[PowerPC G4|G4]], [[IBM]]'s [[PowerPC 970|G5]] and [[POWER6]] processors, and [[P.A. Semi]]'s [[PWRficient]] PA6T.  AltiVec is a [[trademark]] owned solely by Freescale, so the system is also referred to as '''Velocity Engine''' by Apple and '''VMX''' ('''Vector Multimedia Extension''') by IBM and P.A. Semi.\n\nWhile AltiVec refers to an instruction set, the implementations in CPUs produced by IBM and Motorola are separate in terms of logic design. To date, no IBM core has included an AltiVec logic design licensed from Motorola or vice versa.\n\nAltiVec is a standard part of the [[Power ISA#Power ISA v.2.03|Power ISA v.2.03]]<ref name=\"isa203\">{{cite web\n |title     = Power ISA v.2.03\n |publisher = Power.org\n |url       = http://www.power.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/PowerISA_203_Final_Public.pdf\n}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> specification. It was never formally a part of the PowerPC architecture until this specification although it used PowerPC instruction formats and syntax and occupied the opcode space expressly allocated for such \npurposes.\n\n==Comparison to x86-64 SSE ==\n\nBoth VMX/AltiVec and [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] feature 128-bit vector registers that can represent sixteen 8-bit signed or unsigned chars, eight 16-bit signed or unsigned shorts, four 32-bit ints or four [[IEEE floating-point standard|32-bit]] floating point variables.  Both provide [[CPU cache|cache]]-control instructions intended to minimize [[cache pollution]] when working on streams of data.\n\nThey also exhibit important differences. Unlike [[SSE2]], VMX/AltiVec supports a special [[RGB color model|RGB]] \"[[pixel]]\" data type, but it does not operate on 64-bit double precision floats, and there is no way to move data directly between scalar and [[vector processor|vector]] registers. In keeping with the \"load/store\" model of the PowerPC's [[RISC]] design, the vector registers, like the scalar registers, can only be loaded from and stored to memory. However, VMX/AltiVec provides a much more complete set of \"horizontal\" operations that work across all the elements of a vector; the allowable combinations of data type and operations are much more complete. Thirty-two 128-bit vector registers are provided, compared to eight for SSE and SSE2 (extended to 16 in [[x86-64]]), and most VMX/AltiVec instructions take three register operands compared to only two register/register or register/memory operands on [[IA-32]].\n\nVMX/AltiVec is also unique in its support for a flexible vector [[permute instruction]], in which each byte of a resulting vector value can be taken from any byte of either of two other vectors, parametrized by yet another vector.  This allows for sophisticated manipulations in a single instruction.\n\nRecent versions of the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC), [[IBM VisualAge]] compiler and other compilers provide [[intrinsic function|intrinsics]] to access VMX/AltiVec instructions directly from [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] programs. As of version 4, the GCC also includes [[Automatic vectorization|auto-vectorization]] capabilities that attempt to intelligently create VMX/Altivec accelerated binaries without the need for the programmer to use intrinsics directly. The \"vector\" type keyword is introduced to permit the declaration of native vector types, e.g., \"<code>vector unsigned char foo;</code>\" declares a 128-bit vector variable named \"foo\" containing sixteen 8-bit unsigned chars. The full complement of arithmetic and binary operators is defined on vector types so that the normal C expression language can be used to manipulate vector variables. There are also overloaded intrinsic functions such as \"<code>vec_add</code>\" that emit the appropriate op code based on the type of the elements within the vector, and very strong type checking is enforced. In contrast, the Intel-defined data types for IA-32 SIMD registers declare only the size of the vector register (128 or 64 bits) and in the case of a 128-bit register, whether it contains integers or floating point values. The programmer must select the appropriate intrinsic for the data types in use, e.g., \"<code>_mm_add_epi16(x,y)</code>\" for adding two vectors containing eight 16-bit integers.\n\n==Development history==\nThe Power Vector Media Extension (VMX) was developed between 1996 and 1998 by a collaborative project between Apple, IBM, and Motorola. \nApple was the primary customer for Power Vector Media Extension (VMX) until Apple switched to Intel-made, x86-based CPUs on June 6, 2005. They used it to accelerate [[multimedia]] applications such as [[QuickTime]], [[iTunes]] and key parts of Apple's [[Mac OS X]] including in the [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz graphics compositor]].  Other companies such as Adobe used AltiVec to optimize their image-processing programs such as [[Adobe Photoshop]]. Motorola was the first to supply AltiVec enabled processors starting with their G4 line.  AltiVec was also used in some embedded systems for high-performance digital signal processing.\n\nIBM consistently left VMX out of their earlier [[IBM POWER microprocessors|POWER microprocessors]], which were intended for server applications where it was not very useful. The [[POWER6]] microprocessor, introduced in 2007, implements AltiVec. The last desktop microprocessor from IBM, the [[PowerPC 970]] (dubbed the \"G5\" by Apple) also implemented AltiVec with hardware similar to that of the [[PowerPC G4|PowerPC 7400]].\n\nAltiVec is a brandname trademarked by Freescale (previously Motorola) for the standard ''Category:Vector'' part of the [[Power ISA#Power ISA v.2.03|Power ISA v.2.03]]<ref name=\"isa203\" /> specification.  This Category is also known as VMX (used by IBM), and \"Velocity Engine\" (a brand name previously used by Apple).\n\nThe [[Cell microprocessor|Cell]] Broadband Engine, used in (amongst other things) the [[PlayStation 3]], also supports Power Vector Media Extension (VMX) in its PPU, with the SPU ISA being enhanced but architecturally similar.\n\nFreescale is bringing an enhanced version of AltiVec to [[PowerPC e6500|e6500]] based [[QorIQ]] processors.\n\n=== VMX128 ===\nIBM enhanced VMX for use in [[Xenon (processor)|Xenon]] (Xbox 360) and called this enhancement VMX128.

In addition it has 6 smaller arches, higher up in a second row, presumably to help the flow during flooding of the river. The main arch is the only one which has a permanent flow of water.<ref name=Petersen186/>\nThe bridge has [[voussoirs]] throughout its [[Vault (architecture)|vault]], differing from well known Mamluk bridges such as the [[Daughters of Jacob Bridge]], [[Yibna Bridge]] and [[Jisr Jindas]], which use small stones in the vault of their arches.<ref name=Petersen296/>\n\n==History==\n===Roman period===\nThe bridge shows at least two major phases of construction; a possibly Roman-origin lower level and the upper pointed arches likely from the medieval period.<ref name=Petersen296/> Some sources state that the bridge was built in Roman times, and others that it was built in the middle ages. A 1925 letter written by the Palestine Department of Antiquities wrote that the bridge was first built in Roman times.<ref name=Petersen186/> This is supported by a Roman [[milestone]] discovered nearby, which given the scarcity of other local structures makes it likely that a Roman river crossing existed at the point.<ref name=Petersen186/>\n\n===Middle ages===\n[[Al-Muqaddasi]] (c. 945/946 - 991),  described \"beyond the lower end of the [[Sea of Galilee|Lake of Tiberias]] is a great bridge, over which lies the road to [[Damascus]]\",<ref>Mukaddasi, 1886, p.
