{"title_page": "History of the iron and steel industry in the United States", "text_new": "{{update|2018 tariffs|date=November 2018}}\n[[File:USGS Iron-Steel 1900-2014.png|thumb|Graph of US iron and steel production, 1900-2014, data from USGS]]\nThe US iron and steel industry has paralleled the industry in other countries in technological developments. In the 1800s, the US switched from charcoal to coke in ore smelting, adopted the [[Bessemer process]], and saw the rise of very large integrated steel mills. In the 20th century, the US industry successively adopted the [[open hearth furnace]], then the [[basic oxygen steelmaking]] process. Since the American industry peaked in the 1940s and 1950s, the US industry has shifted to small mini-mills and specialty mills, using iron and steel scrap as feedstock, rather than iron ore.\n\n==Colonial==\n\nIron manufacture before the 19th century required charcoal, and Britain\u2019s once-vast forests could no longer supply enough charcoal for the nation\u2019s increasing need for iron. By 1700, Britain was becoming increasingly dependent on iron imported from its sometimes-adversary Sweden. Britain looked to the seemingly limitless forests of its American colonies to supply Britain with iron. British investors started an iron furnace near [[Perryville, Maryland]], which in 1718 started exporting iron back to Britain. That success prompted formation of more companies, which built numerous iron furnaces around [[Chesapeake Bay]], supplied by [[bog iron]] ore, which was widespread. By 1751, [[Virginia]] and [[Maryland]] were exporting 2,950 tons of pig iron to Britain each year;Naima helped the time, British iron production was about 20,000 tons per year.<ref>Norman J. G. Pounds and William N Parker, Coal and Steel in Western Europe (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1957) 22.</ref>\n\nWhile the Chesapeake Bay furnaces were established for export, iron furnaces were established in the 1700s throughout the American colonies for domestic consumption. Iron furnaces were located along rivers to supply water power. Also required were forests for charcoal, iron ore, and limestone for flux. In addition, the furnace needed to be close to a major market or close to water transport.\n\nBritish business interests were split on colonial iron: manufacturers appreciated the lower prices due to colonial imports, but the British iron and steel industry objected to the competition. [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] compromised in the [[Iron Act]] of 1750, which eliminated the import duty on colonial pig iron, but barred the manufacture of steel or of iron plate in the colonies. The law was widely ignored by colonial governments.\n\nBy 1776, up to 80 iron furnaces throughout the American colonies were producing about as much iron as Britain itself. If one estimate of 30,000 tons of iron each year is accurate, then the newly formed United States was the world\u2019s third-largest iron producer, after Sweden and Russia.\n\n'''Notable pre-19th-century iron furnaces in the US''' \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" \n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Name\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Location\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Start Date\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | End Date\n|-\n| align=center | [[Boonton Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Boonton, New Jersey]]\n| align=center | circa 1770\n| align=center | 1911\n|-\n| align=center | [[Catoctin Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Catoctin Furnace, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1774\n| align=center | 1903\n|-\n| align=center | [[Falling Creek Ironworks]]\n| align=center | [[Chesterfield County, Virginia]]\n| align=center | 1622\n| align=center | 1622\n|-\n| align=center | [[Furnace Mountain (Virginia)|Furnace Mountain]]\n| align=center | [[Loudoun County, Virginia]]\n| align=center | circa 1790\n| align=center | circa 1870\n|-\n| align=center | [[Hunter's Ironworks]]\n| align=center | [[Falmouth, Virginia]]\n| align=center | circa 1750\n| align=center | 1782\n|-\n| align=center | [[Huntingdon Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1796\n| align=center | circa 1880\n|-\n| align=center | [[Neabsco Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Woodbridge, Virginia]]\n| align=center | circa 1737\n| align=center | \n|-\n| align=center | [[New Roxbury Ironworks Site]]\n| align=center | [[Woodstock, Connecticut]]\n| align=center | 1757\n| align=center | \n|-\n| align=center | [[Patuxent Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1705\n| align=center | 1856\n|-\n| align=center | [[Principio Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Cecil County, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1719\n| align=center | 1925\n|-\n| align=center | [[Stirling Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Monroe, New York]]\n| align=center | 1761\n| align=center | 1842\n|-\n| align=center | [[Taunton Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Raynham, Massachusetts]]\n| align=center | 1656\n| align=center | 1876\n|-\n| align=center | [[Washington Iron Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Rocky Mount, Virginia]]\n| align=center | circa 1770\n| align=center | \n|-\n|}\n\n==Early republic==\n\nBecause wood for charcoal was available throughout the eastern states, iron smelters were located close to iron ore. Although the bog iron ores mined in colonial days were widespread, the deposits were also small, and quickly exhausted. In the late 1700s the iron furnaces moved away from the bog iron ore of the coastal swamps, to larger iron ore deposits further inland. Inland locations also allowed the furnaces to be closer to sources of limestone, which was used as a flux in iron smelting. The proximity to larger ore deposits favored larger, more permanent iron smelters.<ref>US Geological Survey, 2001, [http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/silent/silent.pdf Silent reminders], Geologic Wonders of the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests, No. 3.</ref>\n\nMost US iron smelting before 1850 took place near iron deposits in eastern [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and northern [[New Jersey]].<ref>John S.Brown, \"Ore deposits of the northeastern United States,\" ''in'', John D. Ridge (ed.), ''Ore Deposits of the United States, 1933-1967'' (New York:American Institute of Mining Engineers, 1970) 2-4.</ref> New Jersey's principal iron ore district, at [[Dover, New Jersey|Dover]], supported iron smelters beginning in 1710.

Dutton, 1959, ''Iron-Ore Resources of the United States, Including Alaska and Puerto Rico'', US Geological Survey, Bulletin 1082-C, p.66-67.</ref>\n\nThe movement away from charcoal in US iron smelting began in 1827, when a [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling]] furnace in [[Phoenixville, Pennsylvania]] started using anthracite coal. [[Blast furnaces]] continued to use only charcoal until about 1840, when [[coke (fuel)|coke]] from [[coal]] started replacing charcoal as the fuel and reducing agent.<ref>James M. Swank, \"The manufacture of iron and steel in the United States,\" in: ''Mineral Resources of the United States, 1883 and 1884'', US Geological Survey, 1885, p.247.</ref> Coke has a higher crushing strength than charcoal, allowing larger smelting furnaces.<ref>W. H. Dennis, ''100 Years of Metallurgy'' (Chicago: Aldine, 1963) 79-80.</ref> Because iron and steel-making at the time consumed more coal than iron ore, the steel mills moved closer to the coal mines to minimize transportation costs. A problem of coke was that it carried impurities such as sulfur, which degraded the quality of the steel. Although coke quickly became the dominant fuel for iron-smelting, in 1884 charcoal was still used to make ten percent of iron and steel in the US. The use of [[Charcoal iron|charcoal for steelmaking]] survived in the US on a small scale until 1945.\n\nThe [[Lackawanna River|Lackawanna Valley]] in [[Pennsylvania]] was rich in [[anthracite]] [[coal]] and [[iron]] deposits. Brothers [[George W. Scranton]] and [[Seldon T. Scranton]] moved to the valley in 1840 and settled in the five-house town of Slocum's Hollow (now Scranton) to establish an iron forge.<ref name=\"Yeomans\">Yeomans, \"36 Hours: Scranton, Pa.,\" ''New York Times,'' November 1, 2002.</ref><ref name=\"Bitter\">\"The Bitter Battle,\" ''Time,'' October 19, 1962.</ref> The most common processes for creating [[cementation process|blister steel]] and [[crucible steel]] were slow and extremely expensive.

The Scrantons also experimented with anthracite to make steel, rather than [[charcoal]] or [[bituminous coal]].<ref name=\"Lewis\">Lewis, \"The Early History of the Lackawanna Iron and Coal Company: A Study in Technological Adaptation,\" ''Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography,'' October 1972.</ref>\n\n'''Notable early 19th-century iron furnaces in the US''' \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" \n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Name\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Location\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Start Date\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | End Date\n|-\n| align=center | [[Bradys Bend Iron Company Furnaces]]\n| align=center | [[Armstrong County, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1840\n| align=center | 1873\n|-\n| align=center | [[Catherine Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Newport, Page County, Virginia]]\n| align=center | 1836\n| align=center | 1885\n|-\n| align=center | [[Curtin Village]]\n| align=center | [[Centre County, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1810\n| align=center | 1921\n|-\n| align=center | [[Elizabeth Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Fort Valley, Virginia]]\n| align=center | 1836\n| align=center | 1888\n|-\n| align=center | [[Georges Creek Coal and Iron Company]]\n| align=center | [[Lonaconing, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1837\n| align=center | 1855\n|-\n| align=center | [[Isabella Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Chester County, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1835\n| align=center | 1894\n|-\n| align=center | [[Joppa Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Baltimore County, Maryland]]\n| align=center | circa 1817\n| align=center | circa 1865\n|-\n| align=center | [[Longdale Furnace Historic District]]\n| align=center | [[Clifton Forge, Virginia]]\n| align=center | 1827\n| align=center | \n|-\n| align=center | [[Mount Savage Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Mount Savage, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1837\n| align=center | circa 1870\n|-\n| align=center | [[Nassawango Iron Furnace Site]]\n| align=center | [[Snow Hill, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1830\n| align=center | 1849\n|-\n| align=center | [[Richmond Furnace Historical and Archeological District]]\n| align=center | [[Richmond, Massachusetts]]\n| align=center | 1829\n| align=center | 1923\n|-\n| align=center | [[Roaring Run Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Eagle Rock, Virginia]]\n| align=center | 1832\n| align=center | \n|-\n| align=center | [[Scranton Iron Furnaces]]\n| align=center | [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1848\n| align=center | 1902\n|-\n| align=center | [[Tredegar Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Richmond, Virginia]]\n| align=center | 1837\n| align=center | circa 1950\n|-\n|}\n\n==Pittsburgh==\n\n[[Image:Bethlehem Steel.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Bethlehem Steel]] in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] was one of the world's largest manufacturers of steel.]]\nThe replacement of charcoal with coal in the steel-making process revolutionized the industry, and tied steelmaking to coal-mining areas. In the 1800s, making a ton of steel required a greater weight of coal than iron ore.  Therefore, it was more economical to locate closer to the coal mines. Pittsburgh, surrounded by large coal deposits and at the junction of three navigable rivers, was an ideal location for steelmaking.\n\n==Great Lakes ports==\n\nThe tremendous iron ore deposits around Lake Superior were located far from coal deposits, and so were shipped to ports on the southern Great Lakes that were closer to the coal mines of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Large integrated steel mills were built in Chicago, Detroit, Gary, Cleveland, and Buffalo, to handle the Lake Superior ore.\n\nCleveland's first blast furnace was built in 1859. In 1860, the steel mill employed 374 workers. By 1880, Cleveland was a major steel producer, with ten steel mills and 3,000 steelworkers.<ref>[http://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=IASI Iron and steel industry], Encyclopedia of Cleveland, accessed 5 Nov. 2015.</ref>\n\nThe city of [[Gary, Indiana]] was founded in 1906 by [[United States Steel Corporation]] to serve the [[Gary Works]].\n\nThe [[Lackawanna Steel Company]] built a large integrated steel works near Buffalo, which began producing steel from Lake Superior ore in 1903. The company had made steel in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] since 1840, but moved to provide easier access to iron ore, and in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid labor troubles.\n\n==Birmingham, Alabama==\n\nBirmingham, Alabama became a major steel producer in the late 1800s, using locally mined coal and iron ore. The iron ore was mined from the Clinton Formation of Silurian age.\n\n'''Notable defunct late 19th-century iron and steel furnaces in the US''' \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" \n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Name\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Owners\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Location\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Start Date\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | End Date\n|-\n| align=center | [[Antrim Iron Company]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Mancelona, Michigan]]\n| align=center | 1886\n| align=center | 1945\n|-\n| align=center | [[Bellefonte Furnace]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1888\n| align=center | 1910\n|-\n| align=center | [[Bethlehem Works]]\n| align=center | [[Bethlehem Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1857\n| align=center | 1995\n|-\n| align=center | [[Brierfield Furnace]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Brierfield, Alabama]]\n| align=center | 1861\n| align=center | 1894\n|-\n| align=center | [[Callie Furnace]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Glen Wilton, Virginia]]\n| align=center | circa 1873\n| align=center | 1884\n|-\n| align=center | [[Cornwall Furnace (Cedar Bluff, Alabama)|Cornwall Furnace]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Cedar Bluff, Alabama]]\n| align=center | circa 1862\n| align=center | 1874\n|-\n| align=center | [[Endor Iron Furnace]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Cumnock, North Carolina]]\n| align=center | 1861\n| align=center | 1971\n|-\n| align=center | [[Fayette Historic State Park]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Fayette, Michigan]]\n| align=center | 1867\n| align=center | 1891\n|-\n| align=center | [[Homestead Steel Works]]\n| align=center | [[Carnegie Steel]], [[US Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1881\n| align=center | 1986\n|-\n| align=center | [[Janney Furnace Park]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Ohatchee, Alabama]]\n| align=center | 1863\n| align=center | 1864\n|-\n| align=center | [[Nittany Furnace]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Centre County, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1888\n| align=center | 1911\n|-\n| align=center | [[Oregon Iron Company]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Lake Oswego, Oregon]]\n| align=center | 1867\n| align=center | 1893\n|-\n| align=center | [[Sloss Furnace]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Birmingham, Alabama]]\n| align=center | 1882\n| align=center | 1971\n|-\n| align=center | [[South Works]]\n| align=center | [[US Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Chicago, Illinois]]\n| align=center | 1857\n| align=center | 1992\n|-\n| align=center | [[Sparrows Point, Maryland]]\n| align=center | [[Bethlehem Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Baltimore County, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1889\n| align=center | 2012\n|-\n|}\n\n==World War II and after==\n\n[[File:US Steelmaking Process Percentages 1950-2012.png|thumb|Percentages of US steelmaking processes, 1900-2012. Data from USGS and US Bureau of Mines Minerals Yearbooks]]\nAs the only major steel maker not harmed during the war, the United States iron and steel industry reached its maximum world importance during and just after World War II. In 1945, the US produced 67% of the world's pig iron, and 72% of the steel. By comparison, 2014 percentages were 2.4% of the pig iron, and 5.3% of the steel production.\n\nAlthough US iron and steel output continued to grow overall through the 1950s and 1960s, the world steel industry grew much faster, and the US share of world production shrank. In the 1960s, the US became a major importer of steel, mostly from Japan.\n\n==Contraction: 1979-1984==\n\nUS production of iron and steel peaked in 1973, when the US industry produced a combined total of 229 million metric tons of iron and steel. But US iron and steel production dropped drastically during the recession of the late 1970s and early 1980s. From a combined iron and steel production of 203 million tons in 1979, US output fell almost in half, to 107 million tons in 1982. Some steel companies declared bankruptcy, and many permanently closed steelmaking plants. By 1989, US combined iron and steel production recovered to 142 million tons, a much lower level than in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe causes of the sudden decline are disputed. Among the many causes alleged have been: dumping of foreign imports below cost, high labor costs, poor management, unfavorable tax policies, and costs of environmental controls. One recent study found that hypotheses based on declining domestic production (such as foreign imports displacing domestic product) cannot explain the magnitude of the decline in employment, as shipments of domestic steel products in 2005 were similar to the level of the early 1960s, whereas employment in the domestic sector had plummeted by approximately 75% over the same time period. Instead, the majority of the losses could be accounted for by rising productivity, principally through technological efficiencies and the shift from traditional steel plants to [[mini mill]]s.<ref name=\"CWL2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Collard-Wexler|first1=Allan|last2=De Loecker|first2=Jan|title=Reallocation and Technology: Evidence from the US Steel Industry|journal=[[American Economic Review]]|date=January 2015|volume=105|issue=1|pages=131\u201371|doi=10.1257/aer.20130090}}</ref>\n\nCleveland had nine integrated steel mills in the 1970s. US Steel closed one mill in 1979, then shut down its six remaining Cleveland mills in 1984. Cleveland's two remaining steel producers, [[Republic Steel]] and Jones & Laughlin, merged to form LTV Steel in June 1984. LTV Steel declared bankruptcy in 2000. The operation, on both sides of the [[Cuyahoga River]], is Cleveland's last remaining integrated steel mill, now owned by [[Arcelor Mittal]].\n\n==Transformation==\n\nThe number of integrated steel mills has continued to decline, and in 2014, only 11 integrated mills were operating in the US. Most of the steel produced has been by the growing number of mini-mills, also called specialty mills, which in 2014 numbered 113. In 1981, mini-mills produced an estimated 15% of US steel.<ref>Linda Chaves, [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/23/business/the-rise-of-mini-steel-mills.html \"The rise of mini steel mills,\"] ''New York Times'', 23 Sept. 1981.</ref> Since 2002, steel produced by electric arc furnace, the process used by the mini-mills, has produced more than half the steel made in the US. Many companies operating integrated mills also have mini-mills.\n\nA number of bankruptcies and acquisitions between 2000 and 2014 reversed the trend of industry fragmentation. In 2000, the top three steelmakers ([[Nucor]], US Steel, and Bethlehem Steel) had 28% of the steelmaking capacity, and the top ten had 58%. By 2014, the top three (Nucor, ArcelorMittal, and US Steel) accounted for 56% of the steel capacity, and the top ten 87%.<ref>[http://usa.arcelormittal.com/globalassets/arcelormittal-usa/publications-reports/2014-arcelormittalusa-factbook.pdf 2014 Arcelormittal USA Factbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915214341/http://usa.arcelormittal.com/globalassets/arcelormittal-usa/publications-reports/2014-arcelormittalusa-factbook.pdf |date=2015-09-15 }}.</ref>\n\n'''Notable defunct 20th-century steel furnaces in the US''' \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" \n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Name\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Owners\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Location\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Start Date\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | End Date\n|-\n| align=center | [[Duluth Works]]\n| align=center | [[US Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Duluth, Minnesota]]\n| align=center | 1915\n| align=center | 1987\n|-\n| align=center | Fontana blast furnace\n| align=center | [[Kaiser Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Fontana, California]]\n| align=center | 1942\n| align=center | circa 1982<ref>http://articles.latimes.com/1987-02-09/business/fi-1840_1_kaiser-steel</ref>\n|-\n| align=center | [[Geneva Steel]] mill\n| align=center | [[US Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Vineyard, Utah]]\n| align=center | 1944\n| align=center | 2001\n|-\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Iron and steel industry in the United States]]\n* [[Iron mining in the United States]]\n* [[History of the steel industry (1850-1970)]]\n* [[History of the steel industry (1970-present)]]\n* [[2002 United States steel tariff]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n==Further reading==\n* Hoerr, John P.

In the 1800s, the US switched from charcoal to coke in ore smelting, adopted the [[Bessemer process]], and saw the rise of very large integrated steel mills. In the 20th century, the US industry successively adopted the [[open hearth furnace]], then the [[basic oxygen steelmaking]] process. Since the American industry peaked in the 1940s and 1950s, the US industry has shifted to small mini-mills and specialty mills, using iron and steel scrap as feedstock, rather than iron ore.\n\n==Colonial==\n\nIron manufacture before the 19th century required charcoal, and Britain\u2019s once-vast forests could no longer supply enough charcoal for the nation\u2019s increasing need for iron. By 1700, Britain was becoming increasingly dependent on iron imported from its sometimes-adversary Sweden. Britain looked to the seemingly limitless forests of its American colonies to supply Britain with iron. British investors started an iron furnace near [[Perryville, Maryland]], which in 1718 started exporting iron back to Britain. That success prompted formation of more companies, which built numerous iron furnaces around [[Chesapeake Bay]], supplied by [[bog iron]] ore, which was widespread. By 1751, [[Virginia]] and [[Maryland]] were exporting 2,950 tons of pig iron to Britain each year; at the time, British iron production was about 20,000 tons per year.<ref>Norman J. G. Pounds and William N Parker, Coal and Steel in Western Europe (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1957) 22.</ref>\n\nWhile the Chesapeake Bay furnaces were established for export, iron furnaces were established in the 1700s throughout the American colonies for domestic consumption. Iron furnaces were located along rivers to supply water power. Also required were forests for charcoal, iron ore, and limestone for flux. In addition, the furnace needed to be close to a major market or close to water transport.\n\nBritish business interests were split on colonial iron: manufacturers appreciated the lower prices due to colonial imports, but the British iron and steel industry objected to the competition. [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] compromised in the [[Iron Act]] of 1750, which eliminated the import duty on colonial pig iron, but barred the manufacture of steel or of iron plate in the colonies. The law was widely ignored by colonial governments.\n\nBy 1776, up to 80 iron furnaces throughout the American colonies were producing about as much iron as Britain itself. If one estimate of 30,000 tons of iron each year is accurate, then the newly formed United States was the world\u2019s third-largest iron producer, after Sweden and Russia.\n\n'''Notable pre-19th-century iron furnaces in the US''' \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" \n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Name\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Location\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Start Date\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | End Date\n|-\n| align=center | [[Boonton Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Boonton, New Jersey]]\n| align=center | circa 1770\n| align=center | 1911\n|-\n| align=center | [[Catoctin Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Catoctin Furnace, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1774\n| align=center | 1903\n|-\n| align=center | [[Falling Creek Ironworks]]\n| align=center | [[Chesterfield County, Virginia]]\n| align=center | 1622\n| align=center | 1622\n|-\n| align=center | [[Furnace Mountain (Virginia)|Furnace Mountain]]\n| align=center | [[Loudoun County, Virginia]]\n| align=center | circa 1790\n| align=center | circa 1870\n|-\n| align=center | [[Hunter's Ironworks]]\n| align=center | [[Falmouth, Virginia]]\n| align=center | circa 1750\n| align=center | 1782\n|-\n| align=center | [[Huntingdon Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1796\n| align=center | circa 1880\n|-\n| align=center | [[Neabsco Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Woodbridge, Virginia]]\n| align=center | circa 1737\n| align=center | \n|-\n| align=center | [[New Roxbury Ironworks Site]]\n| align=center | [[Woodstock, Connecticut]]\n| align=center | 1757\n| align=center | \n|-\n| align=center | [[Patuxent Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1705\n| align=center | 1856\n|-\n| align=center | [[Principio Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Cecil County, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1719\n| align=center | 1925\n|-\n| align=center | [[Stirling Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Monroe, New York]]\n| align=center | 1761\n| align=center | 1842\n|-\n| align=center | [[Taunton Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Raynham, Massachusetts]]\n| align=center | 1656\n| align=center | 1876\n|-\n| align=center | [[Washington Iron Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Rocky Mount, Virginia]]\n| align=center | circa 1770\n| align=center | \n|-\n|}\n\n==Early republic==\n\nBecause wood for charcoal was available throughout the eastern states, iron smelters were located close to iron ore. Although the bog iron ores mined in colonial days were widespread, the deposits were also small, and quickly exhausted. In the late 1700s the iron furnaces moved away from the bog iron ore of the coastal swamps, to larger iron ore deposits further inland. Inland locations also allowed the furnaces to be closer to sources of limestone, which was used as a flux in iron smelting. The proximity to larger ore deposits favored larger, more permanent iron smelters.<ref>US Geological Survey, 2001, [http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/silent/silent.pdf Silent reminders], Geologic Wonders of the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests, No. 3.</ref>\n\nMost US iron smelting before 1850 took place near iron deposits in eastern [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and northern [[New Jersey]].<ref>John S.Brown, \"Ore deposits of the northeastern United States,\" ''in'', John D. Ridge (ed.), ''Ore Deposits of the United States, 1933-1967'' (New York:American Institute of Mining Engineers, 1970) 2-4.</ref> New Jersey's principal iron ore district, at [[Dover, New Jersey|Dover]], supported iron smelters beginning in 1710. The [[Cornwall Iron Furnace]] in Pennsylvania was established next to an iron deposit. The Adirondack iron ore district of New York also supported iron smelters.<ref>Martha S. Carr and Carl E. Dutton, 1959, ''Iron-Ore Resources of the United States, Including Alaska and Puerto Rico'', US Geological Survey, Bulletin 1082-C, p.66-67.</ref>\n\nThe movement away from charcoal in US iron smelting began in 1827, when a [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling]] furnace in [[Phoenixville, Pennsylvania]] started using anthracite coal. [[Blast furnaces]] continued to use only charcoal until about 1840, when [[coke (fuel)|coke]] from [[coal]] started replacing charcoal as the fuel and reducing agent.<ref>James M. Swank, \"The manufacture of iron and steel in the United States,\" in: ''Mineral Resources of the United States, 1883 and 1884'', US Geological Survey, 1885, p.247.</ref> Coke has a higher crushing strength than charcoal, allowing larger smelting furnaces.<ref>W. H. Dennis, ''100 Years of Metallurgy'' (Chicago: Aldine, 1963) 79-80.</ref> Because iron and steel-making at the time consumed more coal than iron ore, the steel mills moved closer to the coal mines to minimize transportation costs. A problem of coke was that it carried impurities such as sulfur, which degraded the quality of the steel. Although coke quickly became the dominant fuel for iron-smelting, in 1884 charcoal was still used to make ten percent of iron and steel in the US. The use of [[Charcoal iron|charcoal for steelmaking]] survived in the US on a small scale until 1945.\n\nThe [[Lackawanna River|Lackawanna Valley]] in [[Pennsylvania]] was rich in [[anthracite]] [[coal]] and [[iron]] deposits. Brothers [[George W. Scranton]] and [[Seldon T. Scranton]] moved to the valley in 1840 and settled in the five-house town of Slocum's Hollow (now Scranton) to establish an iron forge.<ref name=\"Yeomans\">Yeomans, \"36 Hours: Scranton, Pa.,\" ''New York Times,'' November 1, 2002.</ref><ref name=\"Bitter\">\"The Bitter Battle,\" ''Time,'' October 19, 1962.</ref> The most common processes for creating [[cementation process|blister steel]] and [[crucible steel]] were slow and extremely expensive. The Scrantons instead used the new \"[[hot blast]] method,\" developed in [[Scotland]] in 1828.<ref name=\"Yeomans\" /> The hot blast method solved the problem of impurities from the coke, by burning them off. The Scrantons also experimented with anthracite to make steel, rather than [[charcoal]] or [[bituminous coal]].<ref name=\"Lewis\">Lewis, \"The Early History of the Lackawanna Iron and Coal Company: A Study in Technological Adaptation,\" ''Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography,'' October 1972.</ref>\n\n'''Notable early 19th-century iron furnaces in the US''' \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" \n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Name\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Location\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Start Date\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | End Date\n|-\n| align=center | [[Bradys Bend Iron Company Furnaces]]\n| align=center | [[Armstrong County, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1840\n| align=center | 1873\n|-\n| align=center | [[Catherine Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Newport, Page County, Virginia]]\n| align=center | 1836\n| align=center | 1885\n|-\n| align=center | [[Curtin Village]]\n| align=center | [[Centre County, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1810\n| align=center | 1921\n|-\n| align=center | [[Elizabeth Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Fort Valley, Virginia]]\n| align=center | 1836\n| align=center | 1888\n|-\n| align=center | [[Georges Creek Coal and Iron Company]]\n| align=center | [[Lonaconing, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1837\n| align=center | 1855\n|-\n| align=center | [[Isabella Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Chester County, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1835\n| align=center | 1894\n|-\n| align=center | [[Joppa Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Baltimore County, Maryland]]\n| align=center | circa 1817\n| align=center | circa 1865\n|-\n| align=center | [[Longdale Furnace Historic District]]\n| align=center | [[Clifton Forge, Virginia]]\n| align=center | 1827\n| align=center | \n|-\n| align=center | [[Mount Savage Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Mount Savage, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1837\n| align=center | circa 1870\n|-\n| align=center | [[Nassawango Iron Furnace Site]]\n| align=center | [[Snow Hill, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1830\n| align=center | 1849\n|-\n| align=center | [[Richmond Furnace Historical and Archeological District]]\n| align=center | [[Richmond, Massachusetts]]\n| align=center | 1829\n| align=center | 1923\n|-\n| align=center | [[Roaring Run Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Eagle Rock, Virginia]]\n| align=center | 1832\n| align=center | \n|-\n| align=center | [[Scranton Iron Furnaces]]\n| align=center | [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1848\n| align=center | 1902\n|-\n| align=center | [[Tredegar Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Richmond, Virginia]]\n| align=center | 1837\n| align=center | circa 1950\n|-\n|}\n\n==Pittsburgh==\n\n[[Image:Bethlehem Steel.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Bethlehem Steel]] in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] was one of the world's largest manufacturers of steel.]]\nThe replacement of charcoal with coal in the steel-making process revolutionized the industry, and tied steelmaking to coal-mining areas. In the 1800s, making a ton of steel required a greater weight of coal than iron ore.  Therefore, it was more economical to locate closer to the coal mines. Pittsburgh, surrounded by large coal deposits and at the junction of three navigable rivers, was an ideal location for steelmaking.\n\n==Great Lakes ports==\n\nThe tremendous iron ore deposits around Lake Superior were located far from coal deposits, and so were shipped to ports on the southern Great Lakes that were closer to the coal mines of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Large integrated steel mills were built in Chicago, Detroit, Gary, Cleveland, and Buffalo, to handle the Lake Superior ore.\n\nCleveland's first blast furnace was built in 1859. In 1860, the steel mill employed 374 workers. By 1880, Cleveland was a major steel producer, with ten steel mills and 3,000 steelworkers.<ref>[http://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=IASI Iron and steel industry], Encyclopedia of Cleveland, accessed 5 Nov. 2015.</ref>\n\nThe city of [[Gary, Indiana]] was founded in 1906 by [[United States Steel Corporation]] to serve the [[Gary Works]].\n\nThe [[Lackawanna Steel Company]] built a large integrated steel works near Buffalo, which began producing steel from Lake Superior ore in 1903. The company had made steel in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] since 1840, but moved to provide easier access to iron ore, and in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid labor troubles.\n\n==Birmingham, Alabama==\n\nBirmingham, Alabama became a major steel producer in the late 1800s, using locally mined coal and iron ore. The iron ore was mined from the Clinton Formation of Silurian age.\n\n'''Notable defunct late 19th-century iron and steel furnaces in the US''' \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" \n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Name\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Owners\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Location\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Start Date\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | End Date\n|-\n| align=center | [[Antrim Iron Company]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Mancelona, Michigan]]\n| align=center | 1886\n| align=center | 1945\n|-\n| align=center | [[Bellefonte Furnace]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1888\n| align=center | 1910\n|-\n| align=center | [[Bethlehem Works]]\n| align=center | [[Bethlehem Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1857\n| align=center | 1995\n|-\n| align=center | [[Brierfield Furnace]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Brierfield, Alabama]]\n| align=center | 1861\n| align=center | 1894\n|-\n| align=center | [[Callie Furnace]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Glen Wilton, Virginia]]\n| align=center | circa 1873\n| align=center | 1884\n|-\n| align=center | [[Cornwall Furnace (Cedar Bluff, Alabama)|Cornwall Furnace]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Cedar Bluff, Alabama]]\n| align=center | circa 1862\n| align=center | 1874\n|-\n| align=center | [[Endor Iron Furnace]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Cumnock, North Carolina]]\n| align=center | 1861\n| align=center | 1971\n|-\n| align=center | [[Fayette Historic State Park]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Fayette, Michigan]]\n| align=center | 1867\n| align=center | 1891\n|-\n| align=center | [[Homestead Steel Works]]\n| align=center | [[Carnegie Steel]], [[US Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1881\n| align=center | 1986\n|-\n| align=center | [[Janney Furnace Park]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Ohatchee, Alabama]]\n| align=center | 1863\n| align=center | 1864\n|-\n| align=center | [[Nittany Furnace]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Centre County, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1888\n| align=center | 1911\n|-\n| align=center | [[Oregon Iron Company]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Lake Oswego, Oregon]]\n| align=center | 1867\n| align=center | 1893\n|-\n| align=center | [[Sloss Furnace]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Birmingham, Alabama]]\n| align=center | 1882\n| align=center | 1971\n|-\n| align=center | [[South Works]]\n| align=center | [[US Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Chicago, Illinois]]\n| align=center | 1857\n| align=center | 1992\n|-\n| align=center | [[Sparrows Point, Maryland]]\n| align=center | [[Bethlehem Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Baltimore County, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1889\n| align=center | 2012\n|-\n|}\n\n==World War II and after==\n\n[[File:US Steelmaking Process Percentages 1950-2012.png|thumb|Percentages of US steelmaking processes, 1900-2012. Data from USGS and US Bureau of Mines Minerals Yearbooks]]\nAs the only major steel maker not harmed during the war, the United States iron and steel industry reached its maximum world importance during and just after World War II. In 1945, the US produced 67% of the world's pig iron, and 72% of the steel. By comparison, 2014 percentages were 2.4% of the pig iron, and 5.3% of the steel production.\n\nAlthough US iron and steel output continued to grow overall through the 1950s and 1960s, the world steel industry grew much faster, and the US share of world production shrank. In the 1960s, the US became a major importer of steel, mostly from Japan.\n\n==Contraction: 1979-1984==\n\nUS production of iron and steel peaked in 1973, when the US industry produced a combined total of 229 million metric tons of iron and steel. But US iron and steel production dropped drastically during the recession of the late 1970s and early 1980s. From a combined iron and steel production of 203 million tons in 1979, US output fell almost in half, to 107 million tons in 1982. Some steel companies declared bankruptcy, and many permanently closed steelmaking plants. By 1989, US combined iron and steel production recovered to 142 million tons, a much lower level than in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe causes of the sudden decline are disputed. Among the many causes alleged have been: dumping of foreign imports below cost, high labor costs, poor management, unfavorable tax policies, and costs of environmental controls. One recent study found that hypotheses based on declining domestic production (such as foreign imports displacing domestic product) cannot explain the magnitude of the decline in employment, as shipments of domestic steel products in 2005 were similar to the level of the early 1960s, whereas employment in the domestic sector had plummeted by approximately 75% over the same time period. Instead, the majority of the losses could be accounted for by rising productivity, principally through technological efficiencies and the shift from traditional steel plants to [[mini mill]]s.<ref name=\"CWL2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Collard-Wexler|first1=Allan|last2=De Loecker|first2=Jan|title=Reallocation and Technology: Evidence from the US Steel Industry|journal=[[American Economic Review]]|date=January 2015|volume=105|issue=1|pages=131\u201371|doi=10.1257/aer.20130090}}</ref>\n\nCleveland had nine integrated steel mills in the 1970s. US Steel closed one mill in 1979, then shut down its six remaining Cleveland mills in 1984. Cleveland's two remaining steel producers, [[Republic Steel]] and Jones & Laughlin, merged to form LTV Steel in June 1984. LTV Steel declared bankruptcy in 2000. The operation, on both sides of the [[Cuyahoga River]], is Cleveland's last remaining integrated steel mill, now owned by [[Arcelor Mittal]].\n\n==Transformation==\n\nThe number of integrated steel mills has continued to decline, and in 2014, only 11 integrated mills were operating in the US. Most of the steel produced has been by the growing number of mini-mills, also called specialty mills, which in 2014 numbered 113. In 1981, mini-mills produced an estimated 15% of US steel.<ref>Linda Chaves, [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/23/business/the-rise-of-mini-steel-mills.html \"The rise of mini steel mills,\"] ''New York Times'', 23 Sept. 1981.</ref> Since 2002, steel produced by electric arc furnace, the process used by the mini-mills, has produced more than half the steel made in the US. Many companies operating integrated mills also have mini-mills.\n\nA number of bankruptcies and acquisitions between 2000 and 2014 reversed the trend of industry fragmentation. In 2000, the top three steelmakers ([[Nucor]], US Steel, and Bethlehem Steel) had 28% of the steelmaking capacity, and the top ten had 58%. By 2014, the top three (Nucor, ArcelorMittal, and US Steel) accounted for 56% of the steel capacity, and the top ten 87%.<ref>[http://usa.arcelormittal.com/globalassets/arcelormittal-usa/publications-reports/2014-arcelormittalusa-factbook.pdf 2014 Arcelormittal USA Factbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915214341/http://usa.arcelormittal.com/globalassets/arcelormittal-usa/publications-reports/2014-arcelormittalusa-factbook.pdf |date=2015-09-15 }}.</ref>\n\n'''Notable defunct 20th-century steel furnaces in the US''' \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" \n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Name\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Owners\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Location\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Start Date\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | End Date\n|-\n| align=center | [[Duluth Works]]\n| align=center | [[US Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Duluth, Minnesota]]\n| align=center | 1915\n| align=center | 1987\n|-\n| align=center | Fontana blast furnace\n| align=center | [[Kaiser Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Fontana, California]]\n| align=center | 1942\n| align=center | circa 1982<ref>http://articles.latimes.com/1987-02-09/business/fi-1840_1_kaiser-steel</ref>\n|-\n| align=center | [[Geneva Steel]] mill\n| align=center | [[US Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Vineyard, Utah]]\n| align=center | 1944\n| align=center | 2001\n|-\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Iron and steel industry in the United States]]\n* [[Iron mining in the United States]]\n* [[History of the steel industry (1850-1970)]]\n* [[History of the steel industry (1970-present)]]\n* [[2002 United States steel tariff]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n==Further reading==\n* Hoerr, John P.

They differ not only in method, but also in strict ideology and interpretation, although they are generally within the [[Marxist]] [[communism]] tradition.\n\nThe formation of communist parties in various countries was first initiated by the Russian [[Bolsheviks]] within the [[Communist International]]. Since then, communist parties have governed numerous countries, whether as ruling parties in [[one-party states]] like the [[Communist Party of China]] or the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], or as ruling parties in [[multi-party system]]s, including majority and minority governments as well as leading or being part of several coalitions.\n\nMany other communist parties did not govern any country, but they did govern several states or region within a particular countries. Others have also been represented in the national, state or regional [[parliament]]s. Some communist parties and [[List of communist ideologies|schools of thought]] reject [[Parliamentarism|parliamentary representation]] and advocate [[insurrection]] or [[social revolution]].\n\n== Officially ruling in communist states ==\nIn the following countries, several communist parties either lead the ruling coalition or hold monopoly on state power as defined by their respective country's constitutions.\n* {{flag+link|List of political parties in|China}}{{efn|[[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] are administrated under the \"[[One country, two systems]]\" principle.}} \u2013 [[Communist Party of China]] leads the [[United Front (People's Republic of China)|United Front]]\n* {{flag+link|List of political parties in|Cuba}} \u2013 [[Communist Party of Cuba]]\n* {{flag+link|List of political parties in|North Korea}}{{efn|The [[Workers' Party of Korea]] is considered by some scholars to not be a communist party. <ref>{{cite book|title=Ethnic Nationalism in Korea: Genealogy, Politics, and Legacy|last=Shin|first=Gi-wook|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=9780804754088}}</ref> While recently it started to consider itself as [[Juche]]ist exclusively, the party nonetheless participates in the [[International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties]].<ref>[http://www.solidnet.org/15-imcwp/15-imcwp-list-of-participants \"List of participants of 15th International Meeting of Communist and Workers'\"].

They differ not only in method, but also in strict ideology and interpretation, although they are generally within the [[Marxist]] [[communism]] tradition.\n\nThe formation of communist parties in various countries was first initiated by the Russian [[Bolsheviks]] within the [[Communist International]]. Since then, communist parties have governed numerous countries, whether as ruling parties in [[one-party states]] like the [[Communist Party of China]] or the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], or as ruling parties in [[multi-party system]]s, including majority and minority governments as well as leading or being part of several coalitions.\n\nMany other communist parties did not govern any country, but they did govern several states or region within a particular countries.
