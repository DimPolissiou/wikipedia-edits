The information is encoded - or the power level is set - using pulses that have pseudo random widths. The pulses are produced in such a way that on average the produced signal will have a desired ratio between high and low states. The main benefit of using SSDM over for example [[Pulse-width modulation]] (PWM), which is usually the preferred method for controlling LED power, is reduced electromagnetic interference. Figure 1 illustrates a SSDM signal and demonstrates how the average signal density approaches desired value. The pseudo random pulses in the signal are clearly visible.\n\nSSDM can be seen as a special case of [[Pulse-density modulation]] (PDM) or Random Pulse Width Modulation (RPWM).\n\n==Principle and signal creation==\n\n[[File:SSDM-Generation.png|thumb|right|400px|Figure 2: SSDM generation block diagram.]]\n\n[[File:SSDM 5bits 30pct sequence.png|thumb|right|400px|Figure 3: creation of 5-bit SSDM signal with 30% signal density.]]\n\nProducing SSDM signal requires a [[Linear-feedback shift register]] (LFSR) or similar source providing a sequence of pseudo random numbers, a signal density register and a comparator. On each clock cycle, the LFSR provides one pseudo random number. This is compared against the signal density register. Should the signal density register be at or lower than the generated pseudo random number, output is set to high. If the signal density register is higher than the generated pseudo random number, the output is set to low. This is illustrated in figure 2.<ref name=US8129924 /><ref name=PrISM-appnote>[http://www.cypress.com/file/133251/download AN47372: PrISM Technology for LED Dimming] Cypress Semiconductor (Apr 28, 2017)</ref><ref name=SSDM-datasheet>[http://www.cypress.com/file/133186/download Stochastic Signal Density Modulation Datasheet] Cypress Semiconductor  (Jul 24, 2014)</ref>\n\nWhen LFSR is used to provide pseudo random numbers with maximum possible period, the sequence will contain each of the numbers in the range once (except the zero), and eventually repeat.<ref name=PrISM16-datasheet>[http://www.cypress.com/file/125321/download 16-Bit Hardware PrISM Datasheet ] Cypress Semiconductor  (Mar 3, 2014)</ref> For a 4-bit LFSR the sequence is [1 2 5 3 7 6 4]. If the signal density register would be set to 3, would the corresponding SSDM signal be repeating the [1 1 0 1 0 0 0] pattern.\n\nFigure 3 demonstrates the signal generation process. Generated sequence of pseudo random numbers is shown in the first sub-plot along with a desired 30% threshold. The lower plot is the produced SSDM signal. It can be seen that the output is high only when the generated pseudo random numbers are at or below the desired threshold. The SSDM signal will average at 30% of the maximum. Also the repetitive nature of LFSR is clearly visible in the pseudo random number sequence and in the resulting SSDM signal.\n\n==Comparison against other modulation methods==\n[[File:SSDM vs PWM 10pct 70pct sequence.png|thumb|right|400px|Figure 4: SSDM and PWM signals compared]]\n\n[[File:SSDM vs PWM 2khz spectrum.png|thumb|right|400px|Figure 5: Amplitude spectrum of simulated SSDM and PWM signals]]\n\nSSDM has significant advantages over [[Pulse-width modulation|PWM]] when used for power control. In PWM signal, the frequency at which the output is turned high is constant. Only the width of the pulses is varied. This results in relatively high electromagnetic interference amplitude. In the case of SSDM, as the pulse widths and intervals are not constant, the resulting interference is spread across wider spectrum reducing the overall interference amplitude.<ref name=PrISM-appnote />\n\nThe fundamentally different operational principles of SSDM and PWM are illustrated on figure 4. Both signals are shown with two different signal density or pulse-width ratios: 10% and 70%.\n\nFigure 5 illustrates the simulated spectrum of SSDM signal compared to PWM. Both are set to 30% signal density or pulse width, and operate on the same frequency. As it can be seen, the amplitude on the lowest frequency component in SSDM is attenuated more than 20 dB. This also demonstrates that for SSDM most of the signal energy is shifted to higher frequencies..<ref name=electronicdesign>{{cite web|url=http://www.electronicdesign.com/microcontrollers/enhanced-pwm-implementation-adds-high-performance-dac-mcu|title=Enhanced PWM Implementation Adds High-Performance DAC to MCU|first=Dennis|last=Seguine|date=Sep 4, 2015|work=Electronic Design|accessdate=October 17, 2017 }}</ref> Some sources cite attenuation of 30 dB<ref name=US8129924 />\n\nHowever, due to the higher frequencies present in the signal the SSDM may demand more from the load-driving circuitry than PWM. If there is any filtering present in the SSDM signal to reduce the higher frequency components may this have also an effect on the signal density. It's also worth noting that the increased number of individual transitions may also increase the switching losses on the [[Power_semiconductor_device#Switches|MOSFETs]] used.\n\nLike PWM, [[Delta-sigma_modulation]] (DSM) produces far higher amplitude on the fundamental frequency and for the four following harmonics than SSDM.<ref name=PrISM-appnote /><ref name=LED-dimming-appnote>[http://www.cypress.com/file/90081/download Cypress Semiconductor AN49262: Modulation Techniques for LED Dimming] Cypress Semiconductor (Oct 22, 2008)</ref>\n\n==Practical implementation==\n===Hardware support===\nThe SSDM technology is patented by Cypress Semiconductor.<ref name=US8129924 /><ref name=US8476846 /> Hence the microcontrollers supporting SSDM signal generation using dedicated hardware modules are PSoC devices from Cypress Semiconductor.

The London boroughs were all created at the same time as Greater London on 1 April 1965 by the [[London Government Act 1963]] and are a type of local government district. Twelve were designated as [[Inner London]] boroughs and twenty as [[Outer London]] boroughs.\n\nThe London boroughs have populations of around 150,000 to 300,000. Inner London boroughs tend to be smaller, in both population and area, and more densely populated than Outer London boroughs. The London boroughs were created by combining groups of former local government units. A review undertaken between 1987 and 1992 led to a number of relatively small alterations in borough boundaries. London borough councils provide the majority of local government services (schools, waste management, social services, libraries), in contrast to the strategic [[Greater London Authority]], which has limited authority over all of Greater London.\n\nThe councils were first [[1964 London local elections|elected in 1964]] and acted as shadow authorities until 1 April 1965. Each borough is divided into [[List of electoral wards in Greater London|electoral wards]], subject to periodic review, for the purpose of electing councillors. Council elections take place every four years, with the [[2014 London local elections|most recent elections]] in 2018 and the next elections due in 2022. The [[political make-up of London borough councils]] is dominated by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] parties. Twenty-eight councils follow the [[leader and cabinet]] model of executive governance, with directly elected mayors in [[Directly elected mayor of Hackney|Hackney]], [[Directly elected mayor of Lewisham|Lewisham]], [[Directly elected mayor of Newham|Newham]], and [[Directly elected mayor of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]]. The [[City of London]] is instead governed by the [[City of London Corporation]] (and the [[Inner Temple|Inner]] and [[Middle Temple|Middle]] Temples, which are not governed by the City of London Corporation).\n\n==History==\n\n===Creation===\nFrom the mid-1930s, the Greater London area comprised four types of local government authorities. There were [[county borough]]s, [[municipal borough]]s, [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban districts]] and [[Metropolitan boroughs of the County of London|metropolitan boroughs]]. The large county boroughs provided all local government services and held the powers usually invested in county councils. The municipal borough and urban district authorities had fewer powers. The situation was made more complex because county councils could delegate functions such as elementary education and library provision to the municipal borough and district councils, and this was implemented piecemeal. Reform of London local government sought to regularise this arrangement.\n\nThe [[Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London]] was established in 1957 and the report was published on 19 October 1960. It proposed 52 \"Greater London Boroughs\" with a population range of 100,000 to 250,000.<ref>{{cite book | title= The Report of The Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London | year=1961 | last= Sharpe |first=LJ}}</ref> This was made up of a mixture of whole existing units, mergers of two or three areas, and two boroughs formed as the result of a split. In December 1961 the government proposed that there would be 34 boroughs rather than 52, and detailed their boundaries. The proposed number was further reduced to 32 in 1962.\n\nOn 1 April 1965, the 32 London boroughs and [[Greater London]] were created by the [[London Government Act 1963]]. Twelve boroughs in the former County of London area were designated [[Inner London]] boroughs and the twenty others were designated [[Outer London]] boroughs. Outer London borough councils were [[Local education authority|local education authorities]], but Inner London borough councils were so designated primarily to continue the existence of an [[Inner London Education Authority]], praised by official Opposition and government who further noted that unusually the former County of London's many small local authorities had no history of providing education. The [[City of London]] continued to be administered by the [[City of London Corporation]], and the [[Inner Temple|Inner]] and [[Middle Temple|Middle]] Temples continued to govern their own areas.<ref group=\"notes\">Local government legislation makes special provision for the City of London Corporation, Inner Temple and Middle Temple to perform the functions of London borough councils in their areas</ref>\n\nElections were held on [[1964 London local elections|7 May 1964]], with the new councils acting as shadow authorities before coming into their powers the following year.\n\n===Former authorities===\nThe boroughs were created as follows. Some relatively minor changes have been made to the boundaries of boroughs since 1965, and two have changed their names.\n[[File:Greater London composite parts.PNG|600px|thumb|center|Former local authorities in the Greater London area]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=font-size:85%;\n|-\n!

Council===\nBetween 1965 and 1986 the boroughs were part of a two-tier system of government and shared power with the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC). The split of powers and functions meant that the Greater London Council was responsible for \"wide area\" services such as fire, ambulance, flood prevention, and refuse disposal; with the London borough councils responsible for \"personal\" services such as social care, libraries, cemeteries and refuse collection. Several London borough councils and the GLC were involved in the [[rate-capping rebellion]] of 1985. On 1 April 1986 the GLC was abolished and the borough councils gained responsibility for some services that had been provided by the Greater London Council, such as [[Waste disposal authorities in London|waste disposal]]. The [[Inner London Education Authority]] continued to exist as an ad hoc authority. In 1990 it was abolished and the Inner London borough councils also became local education authorities.\n\n===Name and boundary changes===\nThe [[Local Government Act 1972]] provided a mechanism for the name of a London borough and its council to be changed. This was used by the London Borough of Hammersmith (changed to Hammersmith and Fulham) on 1 April 1979 and the London Borough of Barking (changed to Barking and Dagenham) on 1 January 1980. Borough names formed by combining two locality names had been discouraged when the boroughs were created.\n\nThe London boroughs were created by combining whole existing units of local government and it was realised that this might provide arbitrary boundaries in some places. The London Government Act 1963 provided a mechanism for communities on the edge of Greater London to petition for transfer from London boroughs to a neighbouring county district.<ref>London Government Act 1963 Section 6 (4)</ref> This was used in 1969 in the transfers of [[Knockholt]] in Bromley to Kent, and of [[Farleigh, Surrey|Farleigh]] and [[Hooley]] in Croydon to Surrey. The Act also provided for transfers between London boroughs and neighbouring counties where there was consensus for the change between all the relevant local authorities. This provision was used to exchange two islands on the [[River Thames]] between Richmond upon Thames and Surrey. (See [[List of Greater London boundary changes]].)\n\nThe [[Local Government Boundary Commission for England]] was established by the Local Government Act 1972 to review periodically the boundaries of Greater London and the London boroughs. The first review of boundaries commenced on 1 April 1987 and reported in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Local Government Boundary Commission for England, The Boundaries of Greater London and The London Borough, Report 627|date=1992|url=https://www.lgbce.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/11419/627-the-boundaries-of-greater-london-and-the-london-boroughs.pdf|website=Lgbce.org.uk|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref> Following the review a series of relatively minor adjustments were made to borough boundaries, for example uniting the whole of the [[Becontree]] estate in [[London Borough of Barking and Dagenham|Barking and Dagenham]]. The commission noted that many of its recommendations were strongly opposed and were not implemented. The boundary of the City of London with adjacent boroughs was adjusted to remove some anomalies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1993/1445/made|title=The City and London Borough Boundaries Order 1993|website=Legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=22 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the London boroughs the legal entity is not the council as elsewhere in the country, but the inhabitants incorporated as a legal entity by [[royal charter]] (a process abolished elsewhere in England and Wales under the [[Local Government Act 1972]]). Thus, a London authority's official legal title is \"The Mayor and Burgesses of the London Borough of X\" (or \"The Lord Mayor and Citizens of the City of Westminster\").\n\n===Greater London Authority===\nIn 2000 the [[Greater London Authority]] was created, comprising the [[Mayor of London]] and the [[London Assembly]]. As a strategic authority, it absorbed only limited powers, such as major highways and planning strategy, from the borough councils.\n\n==London borough councils== <!-- [[London borough councils]] redirects here -->\nThe London boroughs are administered by London borough councils (sometimes abbreviated LBCs) which are elected every four years. They are the principal [[local government in England|local authorities]] in London and are responsible for running most local services, such as schools, social services, waste collection and roads. Some London-wide services are run by the [[Greater London Authority]], and some services and lobbying of government are pooled within [[London Councils]]. Some councils group together for services such as [[Waste disposal authorities in London|waste collection and disposal]]. The boroughs are [[Districts of England|local government districts]] and have similar functions to [[metropolitan borough]]s. Each borough council is a [[local education authority]].\n\n{{London local authority functions}}\n\n===Shared services===\n[[Shared services]] are borough council services shared between two or more boroughs. Shared services were previously resisted due to councils guarding their authority. However, as the need for budget cuts in the late 2000s became apparent some councils have sought service mergers.<ref>Jane Dudman (20 October 2010) [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/oct/20/public-service-cuts-back-office Public sector cuts will not hit 'back office' hardest], ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref> Westminster and Hammersmith & Fulham were due to merge their education services, including school admissions and transport, by 2011.<ref>Jaimie Kaffash (7 July 2010) [http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2010/07/london-boroughs-to-share-education-services/ London boroughs to share education services], Public Finance</ref> In October 2010, [[Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council|Hammersmith & Fulham]], [[Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council|Kensington & Chelsea]] and [[Westminster City Council|Westminster]] announced [[Tri-borough shared services|plans to merge all their services]] to create a \"super-council\".

each is governed by a [[London borough council]]. The London boroughs were all created at the same time as Greater London on 1 April 1965 by the [[London Government Act 1963]] and are a type of local government district. Twelve were designated as [[Inner London]] boroughs and twenty as [[Outer London]] boroughs.\n\nThe London boroughs have populations of around 150,000 to 300,000. Inner London boroughs tend to be smaller, in both population and area, and more densely populated than Outer London boroughs. The London boroughs were created by combining groups of former local government units. A review undertaken between 1987 and 1992 led to a number of relatively small alterations in borough boundaries. London borough councils provide the majority of local government services (schools, waste management, social services, libraries), in contrast to the strategic [[Greater London Authority]], which has limited authority over all of Greater London.\n\nThe councils were first [[1964 London local elections|elected in 1964]] and acted as shadow authorities until 1 April 1965. Each borough is divided into [[List of electoral wards in Greater London|electoral wards]], subject to periodic review, for the purpose of electing councillors. Council elections take place every four years, with the [[2014 London local elections|most recent elections]] in 2018 and the next elections due in 2022. The [[political make-up of London borough councils]] is dominated by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] parties. Twenty-eight councils follow the [[leader and cabinet]] model of executive governance, with directly elected mayors in [[Directly elected mayor of Hackney|Hackney]], [[Directly elected mayor of Lewisham|Lewisham]], [[Directly elected mayor of Newham|Newham]], and [[Directly elected mayor of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]]. The [[City of London]] is instead governed by the [[City of London Corporation]] (and the [[Inner Temple|Inner]] and [[Middle Temple|Middle]] Temples, which are not governed by the City of London Corporation).\n\n==History==\n\n===Creation===\nFrom the mid-1930s, the Greater London area comprised four types of local government authorities. There were [[county borough]]s, [[municipal borough]]s, [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban districts]] and [[Metropolitan boroughs of the County of London|metropolitan boroughs]]. The large county boroughs provided all local government services and held the powers usually invested in county councils. The municipal borough and urban district authorities had fewer powers. The situation was made more complex because county councils could delegate functions such as elementary education and library provision to the municipal borough and district councils, and this was implemented piecemeal. Reform of London local government sought to regularise this arrangement.\n\nThe [[Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London]] was established in 1957 and the report was published on 19 October 1960. It proposed 52 \"Greater London Boroughs\" with a population range of 100,000 to 250,000.<ref>{{cite book | title= The Report of The Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London | year=1961 | last= Sharpe |first=LJ}}</ref> This was made up of a mixture of whole existing units, mergers of two or three areas, and two boroughs formed as the result of a split. In December 1961 the government proposed that there would be 34 boroughs rather than 52, and detailed their boundaries. The proposed number was further reduced to 32 in 1962.\n\nOn 1 April 1965, the 32 London boroughs and [[Greater London]] were created by the [[London Government Act 1963]]. Twelve boroughs in the former County of London area were designated [[Inner London]] boroughs and the twenty others were designated [[Outer London]] boroughs. Outer London borough councils were [[Local education authority|local education authorities]], but Inner London borough councils were so designated primarily to continue the existence of an [[Inner London Education Authority]], praised by official Opposition and government who further noted that unusually the former County of London's many small local authorities had no history of providing education. The [[City of London]] continued to be administered by the [[City of London Corporation]], and the [[Inner Temple|Inner]] and [[Middle Temple|Middle]] Temples continued to govern their own areas.<ref group=\"notes\">Local government legislation makes special provision for the City of London Corporation, Inner Temple and Middle Temple to perform the functions of London borough councils in their areas</ref>\n\nElections were held on [[1964 London local elections|7 May 1964]], with the new councils acting as shadow authorities before coming into their powers the following year.\n\n===Former authorities===\nThe boroughs were created as follows. Some relatively minor changes have been made to the boundaries of boroughs since 1965, and two have changed their names.\n[[File:Greater London composite parts.PNG|600px|thumb|center|Former local authorities in the Greater London area]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=font-size:85%;\n|-\n!

Council===\nBetween 1965 and 1986 the boroughs were part of a two-tier system of government and shared power with the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC). The split of powers and functions meant that the Greater London Council was responsible for \"wide area\" services such as fire, ambulance, flood prevention, and refuse disposal; with the London borough councils responsible for \"personal\" services such as social care, libraries, cemeteries and refuse collection. Several London borough councils and the GLC were involved in the [[rate-capping rebellion]] of 1985. On 1 April 1986 the GLC was abolished and the borough councils gained responsibility for some services that had been provided by the Greater London Council, such as [[Waste disposal authorities in London|waste disposal]]. The [[Inner London Education Authority]] continued to exist as an ad hoc authority. In 1990 it was abolished and the Inner London borough councils also became local education authorities.\n\n===Name and boundary changes===\nThe [[Local Government Act 1972]] provided a mechanism for the name of a London borough and its council to be changed. This was used by the London Borough of Hammersmith (changed to Hammersmith and Fulham) on 1 April 1979 and the London Borough of Barking (changed to Barking and Dagenham) on 1 January 1980. Borough names formed by combining two locality names had been discouraged when the boroughs were created.\n\nThe London boroughs were created by combining whole existing units of local government and it was realised that this might provide arbitrary boundaries in some places. The London Government Act 1963 provided a mechanism for communities on the edge of Greater London to petition for transfer from London boroughs to a neighbouring county district.<ref>London Government Act 1963 Section 6 (4)</ref> This was used in 1969 in the transfers of [[Knockholt]] in Bromley to Kent, and of [[Farleigh, Surrey|Farleigh]] and [[Hooley]] in Croydon to Surrey. The Act also provided for transfers between London boroughs and neighbouring counties where there was consensus for the change between all the relevant local authorities. This provision was used to exchange two islands on the [[River Thames]] between Richmond upon Thames and Surrey. (See [[List of Greater London boundary changes]].)\n\nThe [[Local Government Boundary Commission for England]] was established by the Local Government Act 1972 to review periodically the boundaries of Greater London and the London boroughs. The first review of boundaries commenced on 1 April 1987 and reported in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Local Government Boundary Commission for England, The Boundaries of Greater London and The London Borough, Report 627|date=1992|url=https://www.lgbce.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/11419/627-the-boundaries-of-greater-london-and-the-london-boroughs.pdf|website=Lgbce.org.uk|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref> Following the review a series of relatively minor adjustments were made to borough boundaries, for example uniting the whole of the [[Becontree]] estate in [[London Borough of Barking and Dagenham|Barking and Dagenham]]. The commission noted that many of its recommendations were strongly opposed and were not implemented. The boundary of the City of London with adjacent boroughs was adjusted to remove some anomalies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1993/1445/made|title=The City and London Borough Boundaries Order 1993|website=Legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=22 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the London boroughs the legal entity is not the council as elsewhere in the country, but the inhabitants incorporated as a legal entity by [[royal charter]] (a process abolished elsewhere in England and Wales under the [[Local Government Act 1972]]). Thus, a London authority's official legal title is \"The Mayor and Burgesses of the London Borough of X\" (or \"The Lord Mayor and Citizens of the City of Westminster\").\n\n===Greater London Authority===\nIn 2000 the [[Greater London Authority]] was created, comprising the [[Mayor of London]] and the [[London Assembly]]. As a strategic authority, it absorbed only limited powers, such as major highways and planning strategy, from the borough councils.\n\n==London borough councils== <!-- [[London borough councils]] redirects here -->\nThe London boroughs are administered by London borough councils (sometimes abbreviated LBCs) which are elected every four years. They are the principal [[local government in England|local authorities]] in London and are responsible for running most local services, such as schools, social services, waste collection and roads. Some London-wide services are run by the [[Greater London Authority]], and some services and lobbying of government are pooled within [[London Councils]]. Some councils group together for services such as [[Waste disposal authorities in London|waste collection and disposal]]. The boroughs are [[Districts of England|local government districts]] and have similar functions to [[metropolitan borough]]s. Each borough council is a [[local education authority]].\n\n{{London local authority functions}}\n\n===Shared services===\n[[Shared services]] are borough council services shared between two or more boroughs. Shared services were previously resisted due to councils guarding their authority. However, as the need for budget cuts in the late 2000s became apparent some councils have sought service mergers.<ref>Jane Dudman (20 October 2010) [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/oct/20/public-service-cuts-back-office Public sector cuts will not hit 'back office' hardest], ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref> Westminster and Hammersmith & Fulham were due to merge their education services, including school admissions and transport, by 2011.<ref>Jaimie Kaffash (7 July 2010) [http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2010/07/london-boroughs-to-share-education-services/ London boroughs to share education services], Public Finance</ref> In October 2010, [[Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council|Hammersmith & Fulham]], [[Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council|Kensington & Chelsea]] and [[Westminster City Council|Westminster]] announced [[Tri-borough shared services|plans to merge all their services]] to create a \"super-council\".

{"title_page": "Discontinuity (linguistics)", "text_new": "In [[linguistics]], a '''discontinuity''' occurs when a given word or [[phrase]] is separated from another word or phrase that it modifies in such a manner that a direct connection cannot be established between the two without incurring crossing lines in the tree structure. The terminology that is employed to denote discontinuities varies depending on the theory of syntax at hand. The terms ''discontinuous constituent'', ''displacement'', ''long distance dependency'', ''unbounded dependency'', and ''projectivity violation'' are largely synonymous with the term ''discontinuity''.{{clarify|date=January 2017}} There are various types of discontinuities, the most prominent and widely studied of these being [[topicalization]], [[wh-fronting]], [[scrambling (linguistics)|scrambling]],<ref>Concerning scrambling, see Grewendorf and Stechow (1990).</ref> and [[extraposition]].\n\nDiscontinuities should be distinguished from ''[[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]]'' and ''[[shifting (syntax)|shifting]]'',<ref>See Gro\u00df and Osborne (2009:64-71).</ref> two mechanisms that result in non-canonical word order but that do not necessarily incur discontinuities depending on the theory of sentence structure one assumes (e.g. [[dependency grammar|dependency]]- or [[phrase structure grammar|constituency]]-based). Natural languages vary with respect to the types of discontinuities that they permit. The fixed word order of English allows for relatively few discontinuities compared to, for instance, the [[Slavic languages]], which are much more permissive. Even compared to a closely related language such as German, English is rigid, allowing few discontinuities.\n\n==Projectivity==\n''Projectivity'' is a principle of ''[[Tree (graph theory)|tree]]'' structures by which discontinuities are identified and defined. A tree structure is said to be ''projective'' if there are no crossing dependency edges and/or projection lines.<ref>See Gro\u00df (1999: 174-187).</ref> If there are crossing edges/lines however, then the structure is ''non-projective'' and contains one or more ''projectivity violations''. The concept and terminology of projectivity is associated most with the structures of ''[[dependency grammar]]'', although the concept is just as applicable to the structures of ''[[phrase structure grammar]]s'' (= ''constituency grammars''). The discussion here considers projectivity first in terms of dependency-based structures and then in terms of constituency-based structures.   \n\nThe flatter the tree structures are, the fewer projectivity violations they will contain. As structures become more layered, the number of projectivity violations can increase.\n\n===Dependency-based projectivity===\nThe following trees illustrate projective and non-projective structures in a dependency-based analysis of sentence structure:<ref>The dependency grammar understanding of projectivity given here follows Osborne (2019: 203-206) closely.</ref>\n\n::[[File:Discontinuity.jpg|Projectivity in DG]]\n\nThe trees show all six possible three-level structures conceivable for the three element hierarchy circle-square-triangle. Four of these six trees are projective because they contain no crossing lines. Trees (c) and (e), however, are not projective due to the crossing lines; each of (c) and (e) contains a projectivity violation because a solid dependency edge crosses a dotted projection line. In other words, each of (c) and (e) contains a discontinuity. The trees illustrate when discontinuities occur: if a given constituent (= complete subtree) is separated from its [[head (linguistics)|head]] by an element that dominates its head, a discontinuity obtains. \n\nDependency grammars have explored the projectivity principle in great detail and have formalized it rigorously.<ref>See for instance Hays (1964), Gaifman (1965), Robinson (1970), Mel'\u010duk (1988: 35ff.)</ref> The concept is, however, a simple one. If crossing lines obtain in the tree, projectivity has been violated, meaning a discontinuity is present.\n\n===Constituency-based projectivity===\nThe terminology that constituency grammars (= phrase structure grammars) employ to identify and define discontinuities is different. The projectivity principle certainly exists, although it is acknowledged in terms of discontinuous constituents,<ref>Concerning the term \"discontinuous constituent, see Wells (1947) and McCawley (1982).</ref> long distance dependencies, and/or unbounded dependencies. The constituency-based versions of the six hierarchies from the previous section are rendered as follows. The solid shapes represent [[syntactic category|phrasal categories]], and the empty shapes [[syntactic category|lexical categories]]:\n\n::[[File:Discontinuity-3.jpg|Projectivity in constituency-based syntax]]\n\nThe crossing lines again identify projectivity violations. Hence trees (c) and (e) here contain discontinuities, just as they do further above. The solid square constituents in tree (c) and tree (e) are discontinuous in a manner similar to that of the empty square constituents in the dependency-based trees (c) and (e) above.\n\n==Types==\nDiscontinuities occur in most if not all natural languages. But the types of discontinuities that a given language allows may differ from the discontinuities of another language, even if the languages are closely related. Worth noting is that a large majority of sentences in most languages are projective, i.e. they do not contain discontinuities. Only about 15\u201325% of actual sentences contain a discontinuity, and the percentage of discontinuous dependencies is even much less, approximately 1\u20132%.<ref>Concerning these numbers, see Nivre and Nilsson (2005: 99).</ref> \n\nThe following discussion briefly considers four widely acknowledged types of discontinuities: 1) topicalization, 2) wh-fronting, 3) scrambling, and 4) extraposition. English allows three of the four; it does not allow scrambling. Examples from German are therefore used to illustrate scrambling discontinuities.\n\n===Topicalization===\nTopicalization occurs when a constituent is fronted in order to establish it as the [[topic-comment|topic]]. The topicalization of [[verb argument|argument]] NPs is rare in English, but adjunct prepositional phrases (PPs) that establish situational context are frequently topicalized. Topicalization is illustrated here (and further below) using both a constituency- and a dependency-based tree, the constituency-based tree on the left and the dependency-based tree on the right. The convention is employed throughout whereby the words themselves are used to label the nodes in the trees: \n\n::[[File:That idea.jpg|Topicalization discontinuities]]\n\nThe crossing lines are clearly visible in these trees. Further examples of topicalization discontinuities (but without the trees):\n\n::''Due to the weather'', we are sure that they left.\n::''After school'', Connor has been practicing piano.\n::''To his wife'', Jim gave a fantastic present.\n\nThe material in italics has been topicalized, which results in a discontinuity each time.\n\n===''Wh''-fronting===\n'''[[Wh-fronting|''Wh''-fronting]]''' (= ''wh''-movement) occurs when a ''wh''-expression appears at the front of the clause in order to focus it. ''Wh''-fronting occurs in direct and indirect questions with interrogative words (e.g. ''how'', ''what'', ''when'', ''where'', ''which'', ''who'', ''why'', etc.) and in relative clauses with relative pro-forms (''that'', ''what'', ''where'', which, ''when'', ''who'', ''whose'', etc.). The constituency-based tree appears again on the left, and the dependency-based tree on the right:\n\n::[[File:Who has Sarah.jpg|Wh-fronting discontinuities]]\n\nThese trees are (merely) representative of the type of analyses that one encounters in various grammars. Especially the constituency-based tree here may be disputed. Nevertheless, the crossing lines are again clearly visible. Further examples of ''wh''-fronting discontinuities in matrix and embedded clauses:\n\n::''Which house'' does Jim plan to buy?\n::''Why'' has that been annoying you?\n::Nobody knows ''what'' they have been saying.\n\n::the person ''who'' we have been seeking\n::dangers ''which'' you have been ignoring\n::a politician ''whose flip-flops'' nobody is willing to forget\n\nThe material in italics has been ''wh''-fronted. The first three examples show ''wh''-fronting in direct or indirect interrogative clauses, and the second three illustrate ''wh''-fronting in relative clauses.\n\n===Scrambling===\n'''[[Scrambling (linguistics)|Scrambling]]''' can result in a discontinuity (although it need not; sometimes scrambling is accomplished by shifting alone). Scrambling discontinuities often occur in order to accommodate the informational content of constituents, old information preferring to precede new information. Scrambling is frequently visible in the leftward striving of definite pronouns. Scrambling discontinuities are absent from English, but they are very common in languages with freer word order such as German. The following trees illustrate a scrambling discontinuity in a subordinate clause of German:\n\n::[[File:Dass sich die Leute.jpg|Scrambling discontinuities]]\n\nThe crossing lines identifying the discontinuity are again completely visible. The reflexive pronoun ''sich'' strives leftward, which results in the discontinuity. Discontinuities of this sort occur frequently in German. The italicized expressions in the following examples are separated from their heads in such a manner that scrambling discontinuities obtain:\n\n::Nat\u00fcrlich kann ''uns'' nichts \u00fcberraschen. (naturally can us nothing surprise; 'Naturally nothing can surprise us.')\n::Sie haben ''den''  versucht zu lesen. (they have it tried to read; 'They tried to read it.')\n::dass ''ihn'' viele Leute bewundert haben (that him many people admired have; 'That many people have admired him.')\n::Essen werde ich ''das'' nicht. (eat shall I that not; 'I shall not eat that.')\n\nIn each of these examples, the italicized constituent is displaced, resulting in a discontinuity. An important aspect of scrambling is that it can operate in both directions. The displaced unit can both precede its head as in the first three examples and follow it as in the fourth example.\n\n===Extraposition===\n'''[[Extraposition]]''' occurs when an expression appears further to the right of where it would appear under other (but similar) circumstances. It is motivated by the desire to focus or emphasize the extraposed expression, or it serves to reduce center embedding and in doing so, it increases right-[[branching (linguistics)|branching]], right-branching structures being easier to process in English than left-branching structures:\n\n::[[File:Something happened.jpg|Extraposition discontinuities]]\n\nThe crossing lines identifying the discontinuity are again easily visible. In canonical cases, extraposition is optional, e.g.\n\n::Something ''that was unexpected'' then occurred.\n::Something then occurred ''that was unexpected''.\n\n::Did anyone ''who you expected to help'' actually help?\n::Did anyone actually help ''who you expected to help''?\n\n::They called someone ''to pick up the kids'' before school.\n::They called someone before school ''to pick up the kids''.\n\nOne can also distinguish between two types of extraposition. The examples above are canonical cases where extraposition is optional. In cases of ''it''-extraposition, the optionality disappears; extraposition is obligatory:\n\n:: *It ''that it rained'' surprised us.\n:: It surprised us ''that it rained''.\n\n:: *Did it ''that they had to study'' disturb them?\n:: Did it disturb them ''that they had to study''?\n\nThe star * indicates that the sentence is nonidiomatic. Apparently when ''it'' appears in subject or object position, it forces the modifying expression to be extraposed.\n\n==Theoretical accounts==\nThe challenge  posed by discontinuities has fascinated and vexed theories of syntax since the 1950s. Early [[transformational grammar]], which is based on phrase structure, addressed discontinuities in terms of [[deep structure and surface structure]] and transformations that mapped constituents out of one position in Deep Structure into another position in Surface Structure. Modern theories of transformational grammar (e.g. [[Government and Binding Theory]]<ref>See Chomsky (1981).</ref> and the [[Minimalist Program]]<ref>See Chomsky (1995).</ref>) assume a [[Syntactic movement|movement]] or copying procedure that moves or copies constituents out of one position into another in the course of the derivation. Representational phrase structure grammars (e.g. [[Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar]]<ref>See Pollard and Sag (1994).</ref> and [[Lexical Functional Grammar]]<ref>See Bresnan (2001).</ref>), in contrast, reject movement and in its stead, they assume some sort of feature passing mechanism that passes information about the displaced constituent up and down the tree.  \n\nTraditional dependency grammars (e.g. [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]'s Structural Syntax<ref>See Tesni\u00e8re (1959).</ref> and [[Igor Mel'\u010duk]]'s [[Meaning-Text Theory]]<ref>See Mel'\u010duk (1988).</ref>) approach discontinuities much differently. They tend to (posit one or more levels of syntactic structure that) abstract away from linear order and acknowledge hierarchical order alone. If linear order is taken to be (in a sense) secondary in this manner, discontinuities present less of a challenge and are therefore of secondary importance to the theory. Other dependency grammars, in contrast, take linear and hierarchical order to be of equal importance. These theories are likely to (also) pursue some sort of feature passing mechanism that passes information about the displaced unit up and down the tree.\n\nThe following trees illustrate the movement/copying type of approach to discontinuities:\n\n::[[File:That idea2.jpg|Movement analysis]]\n\nThe constituent ''that idea'' is seen as being first generated in its canonical position to the right of the verb ''likes''. It is then moved out of that position to the front of the sentence, or it is copied at the front of the sentence followed by the deletion of the lower occurrence. Due to the movement (or copying) this sort of approach to discontinuities can be called the ''movement approach'' (= derivational approach).\n\nThe alternative to the movement approach is information passing up and down the tree, e.g. \n\n::[[File:That idea3.jpg|Feature passing analysis]]\n\nThe displaced unit is taken to appear first in its surface position (it is not moved to that position), and information (= features) about it is seen as being passed down the tree to the position where it would appear under more normal circumstances. The path of information passing is shown in red. Due to the passing of information, this sort of approach can be called the ''feature passing approach'' (= representational approach). The movement and feature passing approaches have something important in common. They both assume that there are no actual discontinuities in surface syntax (for there are no crossing lines in the trees). What appears to be a discontinuity at first blush is actually rather an indication that movement or feature passing has occurred.\n\nFinally, one point is worth repeating. All theories must have a means of addressing discontinuities, but the nature of this means can vary significantly based upon the amount of structure that the theory at hand posits. Relatively flat structures incur significantly fewer discontinuities than more layered structures. Thus the component that addresses discontinuities plays a larger role in theories that restrict all [[Branching (linguistics)|branching]] to binary branching. In theories that allow n-ary branching, the role that inversion and shifting play can be greater, which reduces the role of the component of the theory that is needed to address discontinuities.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*Bresnan, J. 2001.

The terminology that is employed to denote discontinuities varies depending on the theory of syntax at hand. The terms ''discontinuous constituent'', ''displacement'', ''long distance dependency'', ''unbounded dependency'', and ''projectivity violation'' are largely synonymous with the term ''discontinuity''.{{clarify|date=January 2017}} There are various types of discontinuities, the most prominent and widely studied of these being [[topicalization]], [[wh-fronting]], [[scrambling (linguistics)|scrambling]],<ref>Concerning scrambling, see Grewendorf and Stechow (1990).</ref> and [[extraposition]].\n\nDiscontinuities should be distinguished from ''[[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]]'' and ''[[shifting (syntax)|shifting]]'',<ref>See Gro\u00df and Osborne (2009:64-71).</ref> two mechanisms that result in non-canonical word order but that do not necessarily incur discontinuities depending on the theory of sentence structure one assumes (e.g. [[dependency grammar|dependency]]- or [[phrase structure grammar|constituency]]-based). Natural languages vary with respect to the types of discontinuities that they permit. The fixed word order of English allows for relatively few discontinuities compared to, for instance, the Slavic languages, which are much more permissive. Even compared to a closely related language such as German, English is rigid, allowing few discontinuities.\n\n==Projectivity==\n''Projectivity'' is a principle of ''[[Tree (graph theory)|tree]]'' structures by which discontinuities are identified and defined. A tree structure is said to be ''projective'' if there are no crossing dependency edges and/or projection lines.<ref>See Gro\u00df (1999: 174-187).</ref> If there are crossing edges/lines however, then the structure is ''non-projective'' and contains one or more ''projectivity violations''. The concept and terminology of projectivity is associated most with the structures of ''[[dependency grammar]]'', although the concept is just as applicable to the structures of ''[[phrase structure grammar]]s'' (= ''constituency grammars''). The discussion here considers projectivity first in terms of dependency-based structures and then in terms of constituency-based structures.   \n\nThe flatter the tree structures are, the fewer projectivity violations they will contain. As structures become more layered, the number of projectivity violations can increase.\n\n===Dependency-based projectivity===\nThe following trees illustrate projective and non-projective structures in a dependency-based analysis of sentence structure:<ref>The dependency grammar understanding of projectivity given here follows Osborne (2019: 203-206) closely.</ref>\n\n::[[File:Discontinuity.jpg|Projectivity in DG]]\n\nThe trees show all six possible three-level structures conceivable for the three element hierarchy circle-square-triangle. Four of these six trees are projective because they contain no crossing lines. Trees (c) and (e), however, are not projective due to the crossing lines; each of (c) and (e) contains a projectivity violation because a solid dependency edge crosses a dotted projection line. In other words, each of (c) and (e) contains a discontinuity. The trees illustrate when discontinuities occur: if a given constituent (= complete subtree) is separated from its [[head (linguistics)|head]] by an element that dominates its head, a discontinuity obtains. \n\nDependency grammars have explored the projectivity principle in great detail and have formalized it rigorously.<ref>See for instance Hays (1964), Gaifman (1965), Robinson (1970), Mel'\u010duk (1988: 35ff.)</ref> The concept is, however, a simple one. If crossing lines obtain in the tree, projectivity has been violated, meaning a discontinuity is present.\n\n===Constituency-based projectivity===\nThe terminology that constituency grammars (= phrase structure grammars) employ to identify and define discontinuities is different. The projectivity principle certainly exists, although it is acknowledged in terms of discontinuous constituents,<ref>Concerning the term \"discontinuous constituent, see Wells (1947) and McCawley (1982).</ref> long distance dependencies, and/or unbounded dependencies. The constituency-based versions of the six hierarchies from the previous section are rendered as follows. The solid shapes represent [[syntactic category|phrasal categories]], and the empty shapes [[syntactic category|lexical categories]]:\n\n::[[File:Discontinuity-3.jpg|Projectivity in constituency-based syntax]]\n\nThe crossing lines again identify projectivity violations. Hence trees (c) and (e) here contain discontinuities, just as they do further above. The solid square constituents in tree (c) and tree (e) are discontinuous in a manner similar to that of the empty square constituents in the dependency-based trees (c) and (e) above.\n\n==Types==\nDiscontinuities occur in most if not all natural languages. But the types of discontinuities that a given language allows may differ from the discontinuities of another language, even if the languages are closely related. Worth noting is that a large majority of sentences in most languages are projective, i.e. they do not contain discontinuities. Only about 15\u201325% of actual sentences contain a discontinuity, and the percentage of discontinuous dependencies is even much less, approximately 1\u20132%.<ref>Concerning these numbers, see Nivre and Nilsson (2005: 99).</ref> \n\nThe following discussion briefly considers four widely acknowledged types of discontinuities: 1) topicalization, 2) wh-fronting, 3) scrambling, and 4) extraposition. English allows three of the four; it does not allow scrambling. Examples from German are therefore used to illustrate scrambling discontinuities.\n\n===Topicalization===\nTopicalization occurs when a constituent is fronted in order to establish it as the [[topic-comment|topic]]. The topicalization of [[verb argument|argument]] NPs is rare in English, but adjunct prepositional phrases (PPs) that establish situational context are frequently topicalized. Topicalization is illustrated here (and further below) using both a constituency- and a dependency-based tree, the constituency-based tree on the left and the dependency-based tree on the right. The convention is employed throughout whereby the words themselves are used to label the nodes in the trees: \n\n::[[File:That idea.jpg|Topicalization discontinuities]]\n\nThe crossing lines are clearly visible in these trees. Further examples of topicalization discontinuities (but without the trees):\n\n::''Due to the weather'', we are sure that they left.\n::''After school'', Connor has been practicing piano.\n::''To his wife'', Jim gave a fantastic present.\n\nThe material in italics has been topicalized, which results in a discontinuity each time.\n\n===''Wh''-fronting===\n'''[[Wh-fronting|''Wh''-fronting]]''' (= ''wh''-movement) occurs when a ''wh''-expression appears at the front of the clause in order to focus it. ''Wh''-fronting occurs in direct and indirect questions with interrogative words (e.g. ''how'', ''what'', ''when'', ''where'', ''which'', ''who'', ''why'', etc.) and in relative clauses with relative pro-forms (''that'', ''what'', ''where'', which, ''when'', ''who'', ''whose'', etc.). The constituency-based tree appears again on the left, and the dependency-based tree on the right:\n\n::[[File:Who has Sarah.jpg|Wh-fronting discontinuities]]\n\nThese trees are (merely) representative of the type of analyses that one encounters in various grammars. Especially the constituency-based tree here may be disputed. Nevertheless, the crossing lines are again clearly visible. Further examples of ''wh''-fronting discontinuities in matrix and embedded clauses:\n\n::''Which house'' does Jim plan to buy?\n::''Why'' has that been annoying you?\n::Nobody knows ''what'' they have been saying.\n\n::the person ''who'' we have been seeking\n::dangers ''which'' you have been ignoring\n::a politician ''whose flip-flops'' nobody is willing to forget\n\nThe material in italics has been ''wh''-fronted. The first three examples show ''wh''-fronting in direct or indirect interrogative clauses, and the second three illustrate ''wh''-fronting in relative clauses.\n\n===Scrambling===\n'''[[Scrambling (linguistics)|Scrambling]]''' can result in a discontinuity (although it need not; sometimes scrambling is accomplished by shifting alone). Scrambling discontinuities often occur in order to accommodate the informational content of constituents, old information preferring to precede new information. Scrambling is frequently visible in the leftward striving of definite pronouns. Scrambling discontinuities are absent from English, but they are very common in languages with freer word order such as German. The following trees illustrate a scrambling discontinuity in a subordinate clause of German:\n\n::[[File:Dass sich die Leute.jpg|Scrambling discontinuities]]\n\nThe crossing lines identifying the discontinuity are again completely visible. The reflexive pronoun ''sich'' strives leftward, which results in the discontinuity. Discontinuities of this sort occur frequently in German. The italicized expressions in the following examples are separated from their heads in such a manner that scrambling discontinuities obtain:\n\n::Nat\u00fcrlich kann ''uns'' nichts \u00fcberraschen. (naturally can us nothing surprise; 'Naturally nothing can surprise us.')\n::Sie haben ''den''  versucht zu lesen. (they have it tried to read; 'They tried to read it.')\n::dass ''ihn'' viele Leute bewundert haben (that him many people admired have; 'That many people have admired him.')\n::Essen werde ich ''das'' nicht. (eat shall I that not; 'I shall not eat that.')\n\nIn each of these examples, the italicized constituent is displaced, resulting in a discontinuity. An important aspect of scrambling is that it can operate in both directions. The displaced unit can both precede its head as in the first three examples and follow it as in the fourth example.\n\n===Extraposition===\n'''[[Extraposition]]''' occurs when an expression appears further to the right of where it would appear under other (but similar) circumstances. It is motivated by the desire to focus or emphasize the extraposed expression, or it serves to reduce center embedding and in doing so, it increases right-[[branching (linguistics)|branching]], right-branching structures being easier to process in English than left-branching structures:\n\n::[[File:Something happened.jpg|Extraposition discontinuities]]\n\nThe crossing lines identifying the discontinuity are again easily visible. In canonical cases, extraposition is optional, e.g.\n\n::Something ''that was unexpected'' then occurred.\n::Something then occurred ''that was unexpected''.\n\n::Did anyone ''who you expected to help'' actually help?\n::Did anyone actually help ''who you expected to help''?\n\n::They called someone ''to pick up the kids'' before school.\n::They called someone before school ''to pick up the kids''.\n\nOne can also distinguish between two types of extraposition. The examples above are canonical cases where extraposition is optional. In cases of ''it''-extraposition, the optionality disappears; extraposition is obligatory:\n\n:: *It ''that it rained'' surprised us.\n:: It surprised us ''that it rained''.\n\n:: *Did it ''that they had to study'' disturb them?\n:: Did it disturb them ''that they had to study''?\n\nThe star * indicates that the sentence is nonidiomatic.
