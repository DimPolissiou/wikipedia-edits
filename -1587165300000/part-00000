In 1913, Jeanette Hamill, J.D., M.A., joined the school's Economics department, becoming its first female faculty member.

In the 1960s, international business courses were introduced and soon became an important focus of the school's curriculum. The New York University, Graduate School of Business Administration, C.J. Devine Institute of Finance (1959\u20131966) published many key Finance and Investment bulletins related to International finance. The school awarded its first Doctor of Commercial Sciences degree in 1970.\n<!--a series of publications followed... HIST/DIF can identify these -->\n\n===Commerce/College of Business and Public Administration===\nThe School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance was renamed the College of Business and Public Administration in 1972. In the same year, Tisch Hall, designed by [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Richard Foster (architect)|Richard Foster]] (see also: [[Bobst Library]] and Meyer Building) opened at 40 West Fourth Street to house the undergraduate college.\n\n===Stern's donation===\nIn 1988, a $30 million gift from the school's alumnus Leonard N. Stern (B.S., 1957; M.B.A., 1959) allowed the school to consolidate its graduate and undergraduate facilities at NYU's Washington Square campus. The school was renamed Leonard N. Stern School of Business. In 1992, Stern's new $68 million state-of-the-art facility, now known as Kaufman Management Center, was inaugurated.\n\nIn 1998, a $10 million gift from [[Henry Kaufman]] (PhD 1958) supported a major expansion and upgrading of Stern's facilities. The new and renovated space is used almost exclusively to improve the quality of student life. Prominent investment banker and Home Depot investor [[Kenneth Langone]] (MBA 1960) donated $10 million to Stern in 1999. The Langone MBA for Working Professionals was renamed in his honor. Celebrating its 100th birthday in the year 2000, Stern launched a $100 million centennial campaign, the school's most ambitious fundraising effort to date. The campaign doubled the school's endowment, the number of named professorships, and the level of student financial aid.\n\n[[Peter Blair Henry]] became dean of the school in January 2010.<ref name=ft20100221>{{cite news|last=Murray|first=Sarah|title=The bigger picture|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/703f0e20-1d74-11df-a893-00144feab49a.html#axzz2E8r07iXd|accessdate=December 4, 2012|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=February 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the {{convert|84500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} renovation of the three Stern School of Business buildings, known as the Stern Concourse Project, was completed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Light, transparency and brand connect Stern students, faculty and New York City|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&upload_id=13465|publisher=World Architecture News.com|accessdate=December 24, 2012|date=February 24, 2010}}</ref>  This project was fully funded by donors, alumni and corporate partners.<ref>{{cite web|title=Concourse Project|url=http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/concourse/index.html|publisher=New York University|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\nNYU Stern Westchester offers its Langone MBA for Working Professionals in [[Purchase, New York]], at [[State University of New York at Purchase|SUNY Purchase]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.nyu.edu/programs-admissions/part-time-mba-westchester/index.htm |title=NYU Stern &#124; Part-time MBA Westchester &#124; Home |publisher=Stern.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-05}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n{{Infobox business school rankings\n| QSglobal = 19\n| BI = 16\n| Economist = 19\n| FT = 19\n| BWg = 17\n| Forbes = 18\n| USNWRg = 10\n| Vault = 9\n| USNWRu = 5\n}}\n\nAs of 2009, 2,305 students are enrolled in Stern's undergraduate program and 2,969 are enrolled in its [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) program.

This cccDNA serves as a template for transcription of four viral [[mRNA]]s by host RNA polymerase.

Negative selection refers to the identification and deletion ([[apoptosis]]) of self-reacting cells, that is T cells that may select for and attack self tissues. This class of algorithms are typically used for classification and pattern recognition problem domains where the problem space is modeled in the complement of available knowledge. For example, in the case of an [[anomaly detection]] domain the algorithm prepares a set of exemplar pattern detectors trained on normal (non-anomalous) patterns that model and detect unseen or anomalous patterns.<ref>\n{{cite conference\n  | last = Forrest\n  | first = S.\n  |author2= Perelson, A.S.|author3= Allen, L.|author4= Cherukuri, R.\n  | title = Self-nonself discrimination in a computer\n  | booktitle = Proceedings of the 1994 IEEE Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy\n  | place =  Los Alamitos, CA\n  | year = 1994\n  | pages = 202\u2013212\n  | url = http://www.cs.unm.edu/~immsec/publications/virus.pdf\n  }}\n</ref>\n\n*[[Immune Network Algorithms]]: Algorithms inspired by the [[idiotypic network]] theory proposed by [[Niels Kaj Jerne]] that describes the regulation of the immune system by anti-idiotypic antibodies (antibodies that select for other antibodies). This class of algorithms focus on the network graph structures involved where antibodies (or antibody producing cells) represent the nodes and the training algorithm involves growing or pruning edges between the nodes based on affinity (similarity in the problems representation space). Immune network algorithms have been used in clustering, data visualization, control, and optimization domains, and share properties with [[artificial neural networks]].<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last = Timmis\n | first = J.\n |author2= Neal, M.|author3= Hunt, J.\n | title = An artificial immune system for data analysis\n | journal = BioSystems\n | volume = 55\n | issue = 1\n | year = 2000\n | pages = 143\u2013150\n | doi = 10.1016/S0303-2647(99)00092-1\n| pmid=10745118| url = http://directory.umm.ac.id/Data%20Elmu/jurnal/B/Biosystems/Vol55.Issue1-3.2000/1953.pdf\n }}\n</ref>\n\n*[[Dendritic Cell Algorithms]]: The Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA) is an example of an immune inspired algorithm developed using a multi-scale approach. This algorithm is based on an abstract model of [[dendritic cells]] (DCs). The DCA is abstracted and implemented through a process of examining and modeling various aspects of DC function, from the molecular networks present within the cell to the behaviour exhibited by a population of cells as a whole. Within the DCA information is granulated at different layers, achieved through multi-scale processing.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Greensmith\n | first = J.\n | author2 = Aickelin, U.\n | title = Artificial Dendritic Cells: Multi-faceted Perspectives\n | journal = Human-Centric Information Processing Through Granular Modelling\n | volume = 182\n | year = 2009\n | pages = 375\u2013395\n | url = http://ima.ac.uk/papers/greensmith2009.pdf\n | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-92916-1_16\n | citeseerx = 10.1.1.193.1544\n | series = Studies in Computational Intelligence\n | isbn = 978-3-540-92915-4\n | access-date = 2009-06-19\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110809185435/http://ima.ac.uk/papers/greensmith2009.pdf\n | archive-date = 2011-08-09\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Biologically inspired computing]]\n*[[Computational immunology]]\n*[[Computational intelligence]]\n*[[Evolutionary computation]]\n*[[Immunocomputing]]\n*[[Natural computation]]\n*[[Swarm intelligence]]\n*[[Learning classifier system]]\n*[[Rule-based machine learning]]\n\nVillalobos-Arias M., Coello C.A.C., Hern\u00e1ndez-Lerma O.
