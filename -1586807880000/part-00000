It was published in Japan by [[Taito]] and in North America by [[Romstar]]. Controlling the titular attack helicopter, the player must fight endless waves of military vehicles while avoiding collision with their projectiles and other obstacles. The Tiger-Heli has a powerful bomb at its disposal that can clear the screen of enemies when fired. It was the first shoot 'em up game from Toaplan, and their third video game overall.\n\n''Tiger-Heli'' was the creation of video game composers Masahiro Yuge and [[Tatsuya Uemura]], who had previously worked on several titles for Japanese companies Orca and Crux before both of them declared bankruptcy in 1984. The development team drew inspiration from the arcade game ''[[Gyrodine]]''. The team wanted to create a scrolling shooter that balanced between being entertaining and fun, and to have players keep wanting to play it after dying. The staff chose a helicopter as the player's craft as they felt it would work for a game that had the screen continuously scrolling. The soundtrack, composed by Uemura, was made to convey a sense of bravery, which was hampered by technical limitations.\n\n''Tiger-Heli'' was well-received by critics for its gameplay, graphics and weapons, and helped establish Toaplan as a leading producer of shooting games throughout the 1980s and 1990s. It was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] by [[Micronics]], a conversion that was commended for its accurate portrayal of the arcade original. The NES version sold over one million copies. A [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was released in 1996 by [[Banpresto]] as part of the compilation ''Toaplan Shooting Battle 1''. It was followed by two sequels: ''[[Twin Cobra]]'' in 1987, and ''[[Twin Cobra II]]'' in 1995. The rights to ''Tiger-Heli'' are owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese developer formed by Yuge and other former Toaplan employees.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:ARC Tiger-Heli.png|thumb|right|Arcade version screenshot.]]\n''Tiger-Heli'' is a military-themed vertically scrolling shoot 'em up game, in which players take control of the titular attack helicopter through four increasingly difficult levels in order to defeat an assortment of military enemy forces like [[tank]]s, [[battleship]]s, and [[artillery]] as the main objective.<ref name=\"T-HACmanual\">''Tiger-Heli'' instruction manual (Arcade, US)</ref><ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\">''Tiger-Heli'' Game Pak Instructions (Nintendo Entertainment System, US)</ref><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\">{{cite web|last=Zverloff|first=Nick|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/tiger-heli/|title=Tiger-Heli|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=3 July 2011|access-date=2019-10-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402223234/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/tiger-heli/|archive-date=2 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Besides some [[airplane]]s taking off, there are no flying enemies in the entire game. As far as vertical scrolling shooters go, the title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their craft over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a [[helipad]] is reached. Players have only two weapons at their disposal: the standard shot that travels a max distance of half the screen's height and two [[bomb]]s.\n\nA unique gameplay feature is the bomb mechanic; unlike other games in the genre released at the time, the bombs are powerful weapons capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its [[blast radius]].<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/> The bombs also act as a shield against incoming enemy fire, however, as they can be triggered after taking enemy hits as well. There are also three types of [[Item (gaming)|item]]s scattered through every stage in total that appear as destructible flashing [[cross]]es: extra bomb stocks and two variations of helicopter \"options\" that attack at the player's will against incoming enemies, while is also possible to mix and match the two helicopter option types, totaling no more than two.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/> These items can be picked up by shooting their respective cross color but grabbing any item when not necessary yields a 3000 point bonus.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/>\n\nThe player are given three lives initially and bonus lives are awarded at 20000 points and every 80000 points thereafter, in addition of collecting ten [[gold]] [[diamond]]s in a row by shooting them.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/> Firing on determined locations is also crucial for reaching high-scores to obtain extra lives, as certain [[setpiece]]s in some stages hosts a bonus secret within their scenery.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/> There are also hidden bonus secrets to be found as well.

up|vertical-scrolling shooter]] [[arcade game]] developed by [[Toaplan]]. It was published in Japan by [[Taito]] and in North America by [[Romstar]]. Controlling the titular attack helicopter, the player must fight endless waves of military vehicles while avoiding collision with their projectiles and other obstacles. The Tiger-Heli has a powerful bomb at its disposal that can clear the screen of enemies when fired. It was the first shoot 'em up game from Toaplan, and their third video game overall.\n\n''Tiger-Heli'' was the creation of video game composers Masahiro Yuge and [[Tatsuya Uemura]], who had previously worked on several titles for Japanese companies Orca and Crux before both of them declared bankruptcy in 1984. The development team drew inspiration from the arcade game ''[[Gyrodine]]''. The team wanted to create a scrolling shooter that balanced between being entertaining and fun, and to have players keep wanting to play it after dying. The staff chose a helicopter as the player's craft as they felt it would work for a game that had the screen continuously scrolling. The soundtrack, composed by Uemura, was made to convey a sense of bravery, which was hampered by technical limitations.\n\n''Tiger-Heli'' was well-received by critics for its gameplay, graphics and weapons, and helped establish Toaplan as a leading producer of shooting games throughout the 1980s and 1990s. It was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] by [[Micronics]], a conversion that was commended for its accurate portrayal of the arcade original. The NES version sold over one million copies. A [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was released in 1996 by [[Banpresto]] as part of the compilation ''Toaplan Shooting Battle 1''. It was followed by two sequels: ''[[Twin Cobra]]'' in 1987, and ''[[Twin Cobra II]]'' in 1995. The rights to ''Tiger-Heli'' are owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese developer formed by Yuge and other former Toaplan employees.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:ARC Tiger-Heli.png|thumb|right|Arcade version screenshot.]]\n''Tiger-Heli'' is a military-themed vertically scrolling shoot 'em up game, in which players take control of the titular attack helicopter through four increasingly difficult levels in order to defeat an assortment of military enemy forces like [[tank]]s, [[battleship]]s, and [[artillery]] as the main objective.<ref name=\"T-HACmanual\">''Tiger-Heli'' instruction manual (Arcade, US)</ref><ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\">''Tiger-Heli'' Game Pak Instructions (Nintendo Entertainment System, US)</ref><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\">{{cite web|last=Zverloff|first=Nick|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/tiger-heli/|title=Tiger-Heli|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=3 July 2011|access-date=2019-10-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402223234/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/tiger-heli/|archive-date=2 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Besides some [[airplane]]s taking off, there are no flying enemies in the entire game. As far as vertical scrolling shooters go, the title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their craft over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a [[helipad]] is reached. Players have only two weapons at their disposal: the standard shot that travels a max distance of half the screen's height and two [[bomb]]s.\n\nA unique gameplay feature is the bomb mechanic; unlike other games in the genre released at the time, the bombs are powerful weapons capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its [[blast radius]].<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/> The bombs also act as a shield against incoming enemy fire, however, as they can be triggered after taking enemy hits as well. There are also three types of [[Item (gaming)|item]]s scattered through every stage in total that appear as destructible flashing [[cross]]es: extra bomb stocks and two variations of helicopter \"options\" that attack at the player's will against incoming enemies, while is also possible to mix and match the two helicopter option types, totaling no more than two.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/> These items can be picked up by shooting their respective cross color but grabbing any item when not necessary yields a 3000 point bonus.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/>\n\nThe player are given three lives initially and bonus lives are awarded at 20000 points and every 80000 points thereafter, in addition of collecting ten [[gold]] [[diamond]]s in a row by shooting them.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/> Firing on determined locations is also crucial for reaching high-scores to obtain extra lives, as certain [[setpiece]]s in some stages hosts a bonus secret within their scenery.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/> There are also hidden bonus secrets to be found as well. The game employs a [[Saved game#Checkpoints|checkpoint]] system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying.<ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/> Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a live, as well as the helicopter options and once all lives are lost, the [[Game over|game is over]] unless the player inserts more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. After completing the last stage, the game begins again with the second loop increasing in difficulty and enemies fire denser [[bullet]] patterns.<ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/>\n\n== Development ==\n''Tiger-Heli'' was created under the working title ''Cobra'' by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Orca and Crux before both companies declared bankruptcy in 1984, after which a group of employees from the two gaming divisions would go on to form Toaplan and among them were [[Video game composer|composer]]s Masahiro Yuge and Tatsuya Uemura, both of which recounted the project's development process and history between [[1989 in video gaming|1989]] and [[2012 in video gaming|2012]] through Japanese publications such as ''Shooting Gameside''.<ref name=\"PSGv10\">{{cite magazine|last=Abeto|first=Kobatsu|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc|magazine=PSG|volume=10|publisher=FSG|date=September 1989|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531193430/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/|date=2017-05-31}}).</ref><ref name=\"G49\">{{cite magazine|author=|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3|magazine=[[Gamest]]|issue=49|publisher=[[Shinseisha]]|date=September 1990|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107033548/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/|date=2019-11-07}}).</ref><ref name=\"THf25v9a\">{{cite magazine|author1=Iona|author2=VHS|author3=K-HEX|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3 FOREVER (1/5)|magazine=Floor 25|volume=9|publisher=|date=June 2009|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2332&type=translation Translation] by Gamengai. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219234827/http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2332&type=translation|date=2011-02-19}}).</ref><ref name=\"THf25v9b\">{{cite magazine|author1=Iona|author2=VHS|author3=K-HEX|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3 FOREVER (2/5)|magazine=Floor 25|volume=9|publisher=|date=June 2009|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2332&type=translation&p=2 Translation] by Gamengai. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224034931/http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2332&type=translation&p=2|date=2013-02-24}}).</ref><ref name=\"THf25v9c\">{{cite magazine|author1=Iona|author2=VHS|author3=K-HEX|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3 FOREVER (3/5)|magazine=Floor 25|volume=9|publisher=|date=June 2009|page=|lang=ja}} ([https://www.gamengai.com/#/cmnt-info?id=2332&p=3 Translation] by Gamengai. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191122014305/https://www.gamengai.com/#/cmnt-info?id=2332&p=3|date=2019-11-22}}).</ref><ref name=\"TSCa\">{{cite web|url=https://sweeprecord.com/srin-1100/|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3 \u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30af\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30eb|work=SweepRecord|publisher=SuperSweep|date=14 November 2011|access-date=2020-02-15|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021030143/https://sweeprecord.com/srin-1100/|archive-date=2019-10-21|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicle/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711134859/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicle/|date=2018-07-11}}).</ref><ref name=\"TSCb\">{{cite web|url=https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3 \u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30af\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30eb \u7279\u8a2d\u30da\u30fc\u30b8|work=SweepRecord|publisher=SuperSweep|date=27 October 2011|access-date=2020-02-15|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215231114/https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|archive-date=2020-02-15|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002072400/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/|date=2019-10-02}}).</ref><ref name=\"STGv4a\">{{cite magazine|last1=Kiyoshi|first1=Tane|author2=hally (VORC)|last3=Y\u016bsaku|first3=Yamamoto|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u7279\u96c6  -

As it became more popular in America, ''arany galuska'' came to be confused with monkey bread in which the balls of dough are not dipped in cinnamon and sugar but only in butter. \"Monkey bread\" soon became the more common name for this Hungarian Jewish dessert.<ref name=\"Marks2010\">{{cite book|author=Gil Marks|title=Encyclopedia of Jewish Food|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gFK_yx7Ps7cC|date=17 November 2010|publisher=HMH|isbn=978-0-544-18631-6}}</ref>\n\nRecipes for the bread first appeared in American [[women's magazine]]s and community cookbooks in the 1950s, but the dish is still virtually unknown outside the United States.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Preparation==\nThe bread is made with pieces of sweet yeast dough (often frozen), which are baked in a cake pan at high heat after first being individually covered in melted butter, cinnamon, sugar, and chopped pecans.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =Brown\n  | first =Alton\n  | authorlink =Alton Brown\n  | coauthors =\n  | title =Overnight Monkey Bread\n  | work =\"Good Eats\" Recipes\n  | publisher =Food Network\n  | year =2006\n  | url =http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,1977,FOOD_9936_33874,00.html\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =September 10, 2007\n  | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070920190024/http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,1977,FOOD_9936_33874,00.html\n  | archive-date =September 20, 2007\n  | url-status =dead\n  }}</ref>  It is traditionally served hot so that the baked segments can be easily torn away with the fingers and eaten by hand.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =Boodro\n  | first =Michael\n  | authorlink =Michael Boodro\n  | coauthors =\n  | title =Just Say Dough\n  | work =\"FOOD\" Magazine\n  | publisher =The New York Times Company\n  | year =2003\n  | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/23/magazine/food-just-say-dough.html\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2016-09-11 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food}}\n* [[Arany galuska]]\n* [[Bun#List of buns|List of buns]]\n* [[List of pastries]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Food and drink introduced in the 19th century]]\n[[Category:Breads]]\n[[Category:Pastries]]\n", "name_user": "97.85.152.160", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(Clarification)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_bread"}

It ranks Britain's fastest-growing privately-held companies by sales growth (% per annum) over the last three years. The list is produced by Fast Track, an Oxford-based research company, and has been sponsored by the [[Virgin Group]] since 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/entrepreneurs-are-lifeblood-uk-business|title=Entrepreneurs are the lifeblood of UK business|date=2018-12-17|website=Virgin|language=en|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\nThe Fast Track 100 is generally promoted as the definitive guide to the fastest growing privately held companies in the UK. [[Richard Branson]] is quoted as saying ''\"Fast Track has become the definitive barometer of growth companies\"'' However a number of limitations exists which mean that the list may not contain information on many fast growing companies.  Most important of these is the reliance on historical data.  Because Fast Track only deals in publicly available information generally from published accounts, the league table refers to data that is sometimes as much as 10 months out of date.\n\nOn the other hand, this method ensures objectivity and has led to the early identification of a number of household names, including [[Carphone Warehouse]], [[British Home Stores]] and [[Travelex]].\n\n== Entry criteria ==\nFor entry to the 2013 Fast Track 100 companies were required to be:\n\n* Unquoted\n* Registered in the UK\n* Non-subsidiary, independent\n* 10 or more employees\n* Annualised sales of at least \u00a3250,000 in 2009/10\n* Annualised sales of at least \u00a35m in 2012/13\n* An increase in sales from penultimate to latest year, and a forecast of further sales growth\n* Not a technology company\n\n== Other Fast Track lists ==\nFast Track 100 is one of seven business lists of private companies produced by Fast Track and published in the Sunday Times:\n* Fast Track 100 - Fastest growth in sales\n* [[Tech Track 100]] - Fastest growth in sales for 'tech' companies\n* International Track 200 - Fastest growth in overseas sales\n* [[Profit Track 100]] - Fastest growth in profits\n* [[Top Track 100]]- Biggest private companies based on sales\n* [[Top Track 250]] - Leading mid-market private companies\n\n== 2018 Fast Track 100 list ==\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+2018 Top 20 Rankings\n!Ranking\n!Company name\n!Business Activity\n!Sales growth (% per annum over 3 years)\n|-\n|1\n|Midwinter Solutions\n|Clinical trials supplier\n|233.29%\n|-\n|2\n|Crep Protect\n|Footwear accessories developer\n|190.74%\n|-\n|3\n|Revolution Beauty\n|Beauty products retailer\n|152.92%\n|-\n|4\n|Missoma\n|Online jewellery brand\n|148.26%\n|-\n|5\n|Mission Mars\n|Bar and restaurant operator\n|147.37%\n|-\n|6\n|Warner Edwards\n|Gin distiller\n|142.58%\n|-\n|7\n|One Retail Group\n|Consumer products retailer\n|141.53%\n|-\n|8\n|AerFin\n|Aircraft and spares services\n|140.68%\n|-\n|9\n|[[A.F.C.

It ranks Britain's fastest-growing privately-held companies by sales growth (% per annum) over the last three years. The list is produced by Fast Track, an Oxford-based research company, and has been sponsored by the [[Virgin Group]] since 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/entrepreneurs-are-lifeblood-uk-business|title=Entrepreneurs are the lifeblood of UK business|date=2018-12-17|website=Virgin|language=en|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\nThe Fast Track 100 is generally promoted as the definitive guide to the fastest growing privately held companies in the UK. [[Richard Branson]] is quoted as saying ''\"Fast Track has become the definitive barometer of growth companies\"'' However a number of limitations exists which mean that the list may not contain information on many fast growing companies.  Most important of these is the reliance on historical data.  Because Fast Track only deals in publicly available information generally from published accounts, the league table refers to data that is sometimes as much as 10 months out of date.\n\nOn the other hand, this method ensures objectivity and has led to the early identification of a number of household names, including [[Carphone Warehouse]], [[British Home Stores]] and [[Travelex]].\n\n== Entry criteria ==\nFor entry to the 2013 Fast Track 100 companies were required to be:\n\n* Unquoted\n* Registered in the UK\n* Non-subsidiary, independent\n* 10 or more employees\n* Annualised sales of at least \u00a3250,000 in 2009/10\n* Annualised sales of at least \u00a35m in 2012/13\n* An increase in sales from penultimate to latest year, and a forecast of further sales growth\n* Not a technology company\n\n== Other Fast Track lists ==\nFast Track 100 is one of seven business lists of private companies produced by Fast Track and published in the Sunday Times:\n* Fast Track 100 - Fastest growth in sales\n* [[Tech Track 100]] - Fastest growth in sales for 'tech' companies\n* International Track 200 - Fastest growth in overseas sales\n* [[Profit Track 100]] - Fastest growth in profits\n* [[Top Track 100]]- Biggest private companies based on sales\n* [[Top Track 250]] - Leading mid-market private companies\n\n== 2018 Fast Track 100 list ==\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+2018 Top 20 Rankings\n!Ranking\n!Company name\n!Business Activity\n!Sales growth (% per annum over 3 years)\n|-\n|1\n|Midwinter Solutions\n|Clinical trials supplier\n|233.29%\n|-\n|2\n|Crep Protect\n|Footwear accessories developer\n|190.74%\n|-\n|3\n|Revolution Beauty\n|Beauty products retailer\n|152.92%\n|-\n|4\n|Missoma\n|Online jewellery brand\n|148.26%\n|-\n|5\n|Mission Mars\n|Bar and restaurant operator\n|147.37%\n|-\n|6\n|Warner Edwards\n|Gin distiller\n|142.58%\n|-\n|7\n|One Retail Group\n|Consumer products retailer\n|141.53%\n|-\n|8\n|AerFin\n|Aircraft and spares services\n|140.68%\n|-\n|9\n|[[A.F.C.

Situated in the valley between the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] and [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] hills, it was the first and largest stadium in [[ancient Rome]] and its later [[Roman Empire|Empire]].

For discussion see {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=126}}</ref> In its fully developed form, it became the model for circuses throughout the Roman Empire. The site is now a [[public park]].\n\n== Events and uses ==\n{{See also|Chariot racing|Ludi}}\n[[File:Plan Rome Caen Circus Maximus Colis\u00e9e.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Model of Rome in the 4th century AD, by [[Paul Bigot]]. The Circus lies between the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] (left) and [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] (right); the oval structure to the far right is the [[Colosseum]].]]\nThe Circus was Rome's largest venue for ''ludi,'' public games connected to [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religious]] [[Roman festival|festivals]]. ''Ludi'' were sponsored by leading Romans or the Roman state for the benefit of the [[SPQR|Roman people (''populus Romanus'')]] and [[List of Roman deities|gods]]. Most were held annually or at annual intervals on the [[Roman calendar]]. Others might be given to fulfill a [[Votum|religious vow]], such as the games in celebration of a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. In Roman tradition, the earliest triumphal ''ludi'' at the Circus were [[Votum#Military vota|vowed]] by [[Tarquinius Superbus|Tarquin the Proud]] to Jupiter in the [[Roman kingdom|late Regal era]] for his victory over [[Suessa Pometia|Pometia]].<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=66\u201367}}</ref>\n\n''Ludi'' ranged in duration and scope from one-day or even half-day events to spectacular multi-venue celebrations held over several days, with religious ceremonies and public feasts, horse and chariot racing, athletics, [[Theatre of ancient Rome|plays]] and recitals, [[Venationes|beast-hunts]] and [[gladiator]] fights. Some included public executions. The greater ''ludi'' (<ref>http://latindictionary.wikidot.com/noun:ludus</ref>meaning sport or game in latin) at the Circus began with a flamboyant parade ''([[pompa circensis]])'', much like the [[Roman triumph|triumphal procession]], which marked the purpose of the games and introduced the participants.<ref>Described by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, 7.72.1\u201313, supplemented by [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]]'s history.</ref>\n\nDuring [[Roman Republic|Rome's Republican era]], the [[aedile]]s organised the games. The most costly and complex of the ''ludi'' offered opportunities to assess an aedile's competence, generosity, and fitness for [[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Republic|higher office]].<ref>Aedileship was a rung on the [[Cursus honorum|ladder of Roman politics]], available to [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] and [[plebs|plebeians]] of wealth and high standing. Despite the sometimes crippling personal cost of running for office and providing \"extras\" for the ''ludi'', a successful aedile could secure popular favor and a substantial share of the vote at election time. [[Julius Caesar]] was among those who solidified his support through his lavish ''ludi'' as aedile.</ref> Some Circus events, however, seem to have been relatively small and intimate affairs. In 167 BC, \"[[tibicen|flute players]], scenic artists and dancers\" performed on a temporary stage, probably erected between the two central seating banks. Others were enlarged at enormous expense to fit the entire space. A ''[[venatio]]'' held there in 169 BC, one of several in the 2nd century, employed \"63 leopards and 40 bears and elephants\", with spectators presumably kept safe by a substantial barrier.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=71}}, A later iron cage-work barrier is evident at [[Pompey]]'s ''venatione'' of 55 BC.</ref>\n\nAs Rome's provinces expanded, existing ''ludi'' were embellished and new ''ludi'' invented by politicians who competed for divine and popular support. By the [[Roman Republic#From the Gracchi to Caesar (133\u201349 BC)|late Republic]], ''ludi'' were held on 57 days of the year;<ref name=\"auto1\">Bunson, Matthew, ''A Dictionary of the Roman Empire'', Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 246.</ref> an unknown number of these would have required full use of the Circus. On many other days, charioteers and jockeys would need to practice on its track. Otherwise, it would have made a convenient corral for the animals traded in the nearby [[Forum Boarium|cattle market]], just outside the starting gate. Beneath the outer stands, next to the Circus' multiple entrances, were workshops and shops. When no games were being held, the Circus at the time of [[Catullus]] (mid-1st century BC) was likely \"a dusty open space with shops and booths ... a colourful crowded disreputable area\"<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=72}}, citing [[T. P. Wiseman]], \"Looking for Camerius. The Topography of [[Catullus 55]],\"  ''Papers of the British School at Rome'', 1980, pp. 11\u201313 with footnotes.</ref> frequented by \"prostitutes, jugglers, fortune tellers and low-class performing artists.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=72}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Circus Maximus - panorama view.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|View of the Circus site from the south-east.

Over the several centuries of its development, the Circus Maximus became Rome's paramount specialist venue for chariot races. By the late 1st century AD, the [[Colosseum]] had been built to host most of the city's [[gladiator]] shows and smaller beast-hunts, and most track-athletes competed at the purpose-designed [[Stadium of Domitian]], though long-distance foot races were still held at the Circus.<ref>Extraordinarily long races of up to 128 miles, if [[Pliny the Elder]] is to be believed; see {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=71}}</ref> Eventually, 135 days of the year were devoted to ''ludi''.<ref name=\"auto1\" />\n\nEven at the height of its development as a chariot-racing circuit, the circus remained the most suitable space in Rome for religious processions on a grand scale, and was the most popular venue for large-scale ''venationes'';<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=71\u201372}}</ref> in the late 3rd century, the emperor [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] laid on a spectacular Circus show in which beasts were hunted through a veritable forest of trees, on a specially built stage.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=128}}, citing ''Historia Augusta'', Probus, 19.2\u20134.</ref> With the advent of Christianity as the official religion of the Empire, ''ludi'' gradually fell out of favour. The last known beast-hunt at the Circus Maximus took place in 523, and the last known races there were held by [[Totila]] in 549.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bowersock|first1=Glen Warren|last2=Brown|first2=Peter|last3=Grabar|first3=Oleg|title=Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World|url=https://archive.org/details/lateantiquitygui00bowe|url-access=registration|year=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-51173-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/lateantiquitygui00bowe/page/674 674]}}; citing Procopius, ''The Gothic Wars'', 3. 37. 4.For the last known beast-hunt at the Circus, see {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=131}}. Humphrey describes the last known Circus event (549) as \"games\".</ref><!-- Similar claims elsewhere, though Procopius doesn't seem to specify the nature of the games or their venue; if any editor has access to Procopius' Bell. Goth. in anything like the original, input here would be useful. -->\n\n== Topography and construction ==\n\n=== Regal era ===\n[[File:Obelisk-popolo.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Flaminio Obelisk|Obelisco Flaminio]]'', now in the [[Piazza del Popolo]], was once part of the dividing barrier (''spina'') at the Circus Maximus]]\n\nThe Circus Maximus was sited on the level ground of the Valley of Murcia ''(Vallis Murcia)'', between Rome's [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] and [[Palatine Hill]]s. In Rome's early days, the valley would have been rich agricultural land, prone to flooding from the river [[Tiber]] and the stream which divided the valley. The stream was probably bridged at an early date, at the two points where the track had to cross it, and the earliest races would have been held within an agricultural landscape, \"with nothing more than turning posts, banks where spectators could sit, and some shrines and sacred spots\".<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=11}}. Humphrey describes this as \"like a Greek [[hippodrome]]\"</ref>\n\nIn [[Livy]]'s [[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|history of Rome]], the first [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[Roman Kingdom|king of Rome]] [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]] built raised, wooden perimeter seating at the Circus for Rome's highest echelons (the [[equites]] and [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]), probably midway along the Palatine straight, with an awning against the sun and rain. His grandson, [[Tarquinius Superbus]], added the first seating for citizen-commoners ([[plebs]], or plebeians), either adjacent or on the opposite, Aventine side of the track.<ref>The Aventine was a predominantly plebeian area.</ref> Otherwise, the Circus was probably still little more than a trackway through surrounding farmland. By this time, it may have been drained<ref>Tarquin might have employed the plebs in constructing a conduit or drain (cloaca) for Murcia's stream, discharging into the Tiber. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=67}}</ref> but the wooden stands and seats would have frequently rotted and been rebuilt. The turning posts (''metae''), each made of three conical stone pillars, may have been the earliest permanent Circus structures; an open drainage canal between the posts would have served as a dividing barrier.<ref>Etruscan tomb paintings of chariot races offer a possible seating model for this earliest phase; noble sponsors and other dignitaries sit in elevated stands, complete with awning. Commoners lounge or sit below, at ground level. At the early Circus Maximus, the sloping ground afforded the possibility of turf seating tiers at an early date \u2013 as imagined by [[Ovid]] in his account of the first Consualia \u2013 replaced with wooden seating tiers by later sponsors and benefactors. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=65\u201366, 68\u201369}}, for early ''metae'' and a possible canal as central dividing barrier, see summary on pp. 292\u20133.</ref>\n\n=== Republican era ===\nThe games' sponsor (Latin ''editor)'' usually sat beside the images of attending gods, on a conspicuous, elevated stand (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#pulvinar|pulvinar]]'') but seats at the track's perimeter offered the best, most dramatic close-ups. In 494 BC (very early in the [[Roman republic|Republican era]]) the [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Manius Valerius Maximus]] and his descendants were granted rights to a [[curule chair]] at the southeastern turn, an excellent viewpoint for the thrills and spills of chariot racing.<ref>In the earliest exercise of the right, a curule chair would have been brought to the spot; its permanent positioning there is unlikely. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=61}}</ref> In the 190s&nbsp;BC, stone track-side seating was built, exclusively for senators.<ref>Livy has the plebs seated \"promiscuously\" (''antea in promiscuo spectabant'') up to then: see {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=70}}</ref>\n\nPermanent wooden starting stalls were built in 329 BC. They were gated, brightly painted,<ref>Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, 8.20.1</ref> and staggered to equalise the distances from each start place to the central barrier. In theory, they might have accommodated up to 25 four-horse chariots ( [[Quadriga]]s ) abreast but when team-racing was introduced,<ref>Racing teams might have been used as early as the Regal era (according to some later Roman traditions), or as late as the end of the Punic Wars.</ref> they were widened, and their number reduced. By the late Republican or early Imperial era, there were twelve stalls. Their divisions were fronted by [[herma|herms]] that served as stops for spring-loaded gates, so that twelve light-weight, [[Quadriga|four-horse]] or [[Biga (chariot)|two-horse chariots]] could be simultaneously released onto the track. The stalls were allocated by lottery, and the various racing teams were identified by their colors.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=171}}; the gates probably used the same animal-sinew torsion springing as the Roman [[ballista]]; ''Ibid'', pp. 137\u2013138: opposing teams of Reds and Whites are prominent in late Republican literature, and Greens and Blues in the Imperial era. Some Roman authors held that team-racing in multiple colors dated back to the regal era. ''Ibid,'' p. 175 for allocation of stalls by lottery.</ref> Typically, there were seven laps per race.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/romans/empire/chariot.html|title=The Roman Empire: in the First Century. The Roman Empire. Life In Roman Times. Chariot Races|website=PBS.org}}</ref> From at least 174&nbsp;BC, they were counted off using large sculpted eggs. In 33&nbsp;BC, an additional system of large bronze dolphin-shaped lap counters was added, positioned well above the central dividing barrier ''(euripus)'' for maximum visibility.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=261\u2013265}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sestertius-Caracalla-Circus Maximus-RIC 0500a.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sestertius]] depicting [[Caracalla]], and the Circus Maximus, with Augustus' obelisk midway along the central dividing barrier ''(euripus)'']]\n[[Julius Caesar]]'s development of the Circus, commencing around 50&nbsp;BC, extended the seating tiers to run almost the entire circuit of the track, barring the starting gates and a processional entrance at the semi-circular end.<ref>A processional entrance at the semi-circular end,. prior to the erection there of Titus' triumphal arch, is assumed by most modern sources. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=69, 97ff}}</ref> The track measured approximately 621&nbsp;m (2,037&nbsp;ft) in length and 150&nbsp;m (387&nbsp;ft) in breadth. A&nbsp;canal was cut between the track perimeter and its seating to protect spectators and help drain the track.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=75, 84}}</ref> The inner third of the seating formed a trackside ''[[cavea]]''. Its front sections along the central straight were reserved for senators, and those immediately behind for ''equites''. The outer tiers, two thirds of the total, were meant for Roman plebs and non-citizens. They were timber-built, with wooden-framed service buildings, shops and entrance-ways beneath. The total number of seats is uncertain, but was probably in the order of 150,000;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Circus-Maximus|title=Circus Maximus arena, Rome, Italy|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> [[Pliny the Elder]]'s estimate of 250,000 is unlikely. The wooden bleachers were damaged in a fire of 31&nbsp;BC, either during or after construction.<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]]'s figure of 250,000 circus seats is unreliable; it ignores the necessary interruptions of seating rows by many access stairways and corridors. It might represent a per foot run seating estimate, or include those watching from the nearby heights, outside the building proper. In late Imperial regionary catalogues, seating estimates for the Circus become even wilder; one gives an impossible 450,000 seats. Discussion is in {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=126}}</ref>\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n[[File:Sestertius Trajan Circus Maximus AD103.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Sestertius of Trajan celebrating the restoration of the Circus Maximus (minted 103 AD).<ref>Sear, David R.

London: Spink. {{ISBN|1-902040-45-7}}</ref>]]\n\nThe fire damage of 31 was probably repaired by Augustus (Caesar's successor and Rome's first emperor). He modestly claimed credit only for an obelisk and ''pulvinar'' at the site but both were major projects. Ever since its quarrying, long before Rome existed, the obelisk had been sacred to Egyptian Sun-gods.<ref>It was quarried and first dedicated in the reign of [[Seti I]]</ref> Augustus had it brought from [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]<ref name=\"auto3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/raising/rome.html|title=Mysteries of the Nile \u2013 A World of Obelisks: Rome|website=NOVA Online}}</ref> at enormous expense, and erected midway along the dividing barrier of the Circus. It was Rome's first obelisk, an exotically sacred object and a permanent reminder of Augustus' victory over his Roman foes and their Egyptian allies in the recent civil wars. Thanks to him, Rome had secured both a lasting peace and a new Egyptian Province. The ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#pulvinar|pulvinar]]'' was built on monumental scale, a shrine or temple (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#aedes|aedes]]'') raised high above the trackside seats. Sometimes, while games were in progress, Augustus watched from there, alongside the gods. Occasionally, his family would join him there. This is the Circus described by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] as \"one of the most beautiful and admirable structures in Rome\", with \"entrances and ascents for the spectators at every shop, so that the countless thousands of people may enter and depart without inconvenience.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=72\u201373}}. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] described the Circus and its seating c.30 BC\u2013AD 8. Augustus also rebuilt Ceres' temple, above the starting gates; it was probably damaged in the fire of 31 BC. ''Ibid,'' pp. 268\u2013272 for Augustus' obelisk.</ref>\n[[File:Topographical diagram of the Circus Maximus by Samuel Ball Platner.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Groundplan of the Circus Maximus, according to [[Samuel Ball Platner]], 1911. The staggered starting gates are to the left.]]\nThe site remained prone to flooding,<ref>The ''Ludi Martiales'' of AD 12 were temporarily transferred from the Circus, after a flood.</ref> probably through the starting gates, until [[Claudius]] made improvements there; they probably included an extramural anti-flooding embankment. Fires in the crowded, wooden perimeter workshops and bleachers were a far greater danger. A fire of 36 AD seems to have started in a basket-maker's workshop under the stands, on the Aventine side; the emperor [[Tiberius]] compensated various small businesses there for their losses.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=100\u2013101}}. Claudius' improvements at the Circus included stone-built or marble-clad starting stalls and rebuilt turning posts.</ref> In [[Great Fire of Rome|AD 64]], during [[Nero]]'s reign, fire broke out at the semi-circular end of the Circus, swept through the stands and shops, and destroyed much of the city. Games and festivals continued at the Circus, which was rebuilt over several years to the same footprint and design.<ref>Nero, inordinately fond of chariot-racing, may have considered the Circus rebuilding a priority but the overall cost of Rome's rebuilding must have proved an extraordinary drain on Imperial and public funds. Wooden bleachers for the Roman masses were an expedient, cost-effective solution. If Nero had grander plans for the Circus, they ended with his suicide under compulsion, after a coup d'etat in AD 68. {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=101}}</ref>\n\nBy the late 1st century AD, the central dividing barrier comprised a series of water basins, or else a single watercourse open in some places and bridged over in others. It offered opportunities for artistic embellishment and decorative swagger, and included the temples and statues of various deities, fountains, and refuges for those assistants involved in more dangerous circus activities, such as beast-hunts and the recovery of casualties during races.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=293\u2013294}}</ref>\n\nIn AD 81 the Senate built a triple arch honoring [[Titus]] at the semi-circular end of the Circus, to replace or augment a former processional entrance.<ref>This is not to be confused with the [[Arch of Titus]], built over the [[Via Sacra]] on the opposite side of the Palatine.</ref> The emperor [[Domitian]] built a new, multi-storey palace on the Palatine, connected somehow to the Circus; he likely watched the games in autocratic style, from high above and barely visible to those below.

Under Trajan, the Circus Maximus found its definitive form, which was unchanged thereafter save for some monumental additions by later emperors, an extensive, planned rebuilding of the starting gate area under [[Caracalla]], and repairs and renewals to existing fabric. Some repairs were unforeseen and extensive, such as those carried out in [[Diocletian]]'s reign, after the collapse of a seating section killed some 13,000 people.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=80, 102, 126\u20139}}</ref>\n\n== Religious significance ==\n{{Wide image|Circus Maximus in Rome.jpg|900px|The Circus Maximus site and the Palatine Hill in background|box width|center|alt=alt text}}\n\nThe southeastern turn of the track ran between two shrines which may have predated the Circus' formal development. One, located at the outer southeast perimeter, was dedicated to the valley's eponymous goddess [[Murcia (mythology)|Murcia]], an obscure deity associated with [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the [[Myrtus|myrtle]] shrub, a sacred spring, the stream that divided the valley, and the lesser peak of the Aventine Hill.<ref>The prestige attached to the [[curule chair]] granted [[Manius Valerius Maximus]] and his descendants in 494 BC would have been enhanced by its positioning close to this shrine. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=61}}</ref> The other was at the southeastern turning-post; where there was an underground shrine to [[Consus]], a minor god of grain-stores, connected to the grain-goddess [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and to the [[underworld]]. According to Roman tradition, [[Romulus]] discovered this shrine shortly after the [[founding of Rome]]. He invented the [[Consualia]] festival, as a way of gathering his Sabine neighbours at a celebration that included horse-races and drinking. During these distractions, Romulus's men then [[bride abduction|abducted]] the Sabine daughters as brides. Thus the famous [[Roman mythology|Roman myth]] of the [[Rape of the Sabine women]] had as its setting the Circus and the Consualia.\n\nIn this quasi-legendary era, horse or chariot races would have been held at the Circus site. The track width may have been determined by the distance between Murcia's and Consus' shrines at the southeastern end, and its length by the distance between these two shrines and [[Hercules]]' [[Ara Maxima]], supposedly older than Rome itself and sited behind the Circus' starting place.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=62}}</ref> The position of Consus' shrine at the turn of the track recalls the placing of shrines to Roman [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]'s Greek equivalent, [[Poseidon]], in Greek [[hippodrome]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=62}}; \"later Roman authors often reported the Consualia were held in honour of [[Neptune (mythology)#Neptunus equestris|Neptunus Equestris]].\"</ref> In later developments, the altar of Consus, as one of the Circus' [[tutelary deity|patron deities]], was incorporated into the fabric of the south-eastern turning post. When Murcia's stream was partly built over, to form a dividing barrier (the ''spina'' or ''euripus'')<ref>Most modern sources use ''spina'' (a spine) for the central barrier, based on a single, very late Roman source ([[Cassiodorus]]), but most Roman sources used ''euripus'', a Greek word meaning a channel, strait, or canal, and thus a barrier. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=175}}</ref> between the turning posts, her shrine was either retained or rebuilt. In the Late Imperial period, both the southeastern turn and the circus itself were sometimes known as ''Vallis Murcia''.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=61\u201362}}.

Likewise, the later use of dolphin-shaped lap counters reinforced associations between the races, swiftness, and [[Neptune (mythology)#Neptunus equestris|Neptune]], as god of earthquakes and horses; the Romans believed dolphins to be the swiftest of all creatures.<ref name=\"auto2\" /> When the Romans adopted the Phrygian [[Magna Mater|Great Mother]] as an ancestral deity, a statue of her on lion-back was erected within the circus, probably on the dividing barrier.\n\n[[File:Roman - Intaglio of a Circus with a Chariot Race - Walters 421314.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Jasper]] [[intaglio (sculpture)|intaglio]] (2nd century AD) depicting chariot races, with the three-pointed  ''metae'' at each end of the dividing barrier shown at top ([[Walters Art Museum]])]]\nSun and Moon cults were probably represented at the Circus from its earliest phases. Their importance grew with the introduction of Roman cult to Apollo, and the development of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] and solar monism as a theological basis for the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Roman Imperial cult]]. In the Imperial era, the Sun-god was divine patron of the Circus and its games. His sacred [[obelisk]] towered over the arena, set in the central barrier, close to his temple and the finishing line.  The Sun-god was the ultimate, victorious charioteer, driving his four-horse chariot (''[[quadriga]]'') through the heavenly circuit from sunrise to sunset. His partner Luna drove her two-horse chariot (''[[biga (chariot)|biga]]''); together, they represented the predictable, orderly movement of the cosmos and the circuit of time, which found analogy in the Circus track.<ref>Jean Sorabella, \"A Roman Sarcophagus and Its Patron\", ''Metropolitan Museum Journal'', Vol. 36, (2001), p. 75.

The temples to [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]] stood close together on the Aventine, more or less opposite the Circus' starting gate, which remained under Hercules' protection. Further southeast along the Aventine was a temple to [[Temple of Luna|Luna]], the moon goddess. Aventine temples to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus Obsequens]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and [[Dis Pater|Dis]] (or perhaps [[Summanus]]) stood on the slopes above the southeast turn. On the Palatine hill, opposite to Ceres's temple, stood the temple to [[Temple of Cybele (Palatine)|Magna Mater]] and, more or less opposite Luna's temple, one to the sun-god [[Temple of Apollo Palatinus|Apollo]].\n\nSeveral festivals, some of uncertain foundation and date, were held at the Circus in historical times. The Consualia, with its semi-mythical establishment by Romulus, and the [[Cerealia]], the major festival of Ceres, were probably older than the earliest historically attested \"Roman Games\" ''([[Ludi Romani]])'' held at the Circus in honour of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] in 366 BC.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1.56.</ref> In the early Imperial era, [[Ovid]] describes the opening of Cerealia (mid to late April) with a horse race at the Circus,<ref>Wiseman, 1995, p.137.</ref> followed by the nighttime release of foxes into the stadium, their tails ablaze with lighted torches.<ref>See [[Barbette Spaeth|Spaeth, Barbette Stanley]], ''The Roman goddess Ceres'', University of Texas Press, 1996, pp. 36\u201337.</ref> Some early connection is likely between Ceres as goddess of grain crops and Consus as a god of grain storage and patron of the Circus.\n\n== Modern status and uses ==\n[[File:Circus-Maximus-June-1983.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ruins overlooking the Circus Maximus, seen from the Aventine (1983)]]\nAfter the 6th century, the Circus fell into disuse and decay, and was quarried for building materials.

The Circus lies between the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] (left) and [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] (right); the oval structure to the far right is the [[Colosseum]].]]\nThe Circus was Rome's largest venue for ''ludi,'' public games connected to [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religious]] [[Roman festival|festivals]]. ''Ludi'' were sponsored by leading Romans or the Roman state for the benefit of the [[SPQR|Roman people (''populus Romanus'')]] and [[List of Roman deities|gods]]. Most were held annually or at annual intervals on the [[Roman calendar]]. Others might be given to fulfill a [[Votum|religious vow]], such as the games in celebration of a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. In Roman tradition, the earliest triumphal ''ludi'' at the Circus were [[Votum#Military vota|vowed]] by [[Tarquinius Superbus|Tarquin the Proud]] to Jupiter in the [[Roman kingdom|late Regal era]] for his victory over [[Suessa Pometia|Pometia]].<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=66\u201367}}</ref>\n\n''Ludi'' ranged in duration and scope from one-day or even half-day events to spectacular multi-venue celebrations held over several days, with religious ceremonies and public feasts, horse and chariot racing, athletics, [[Theatre of ancient Rome|plays]] and recitals, [[Venationes|beast-hunts]] and [[gladiator]] fights. Some included public executions. The greater ''ludi'' (<ref>http://latindictionary.wikidot.com/noun:ludus</ref>meaning sport or game in latin) at the Circus began with a flamboyant parade ''([[pompa circensis]])'', much like the [[Roman triumph|triumphal procession]], which marked the purpose of the games and introduced the participants.<ref>Described by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, 7.72.1\u201313, supplemented by [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]]'s history.</ref>\n\nDuring [[Roman Republic|Rome's Republican era]], the [[aedile]]s organised the games. The most costly and complex of the ''ludi'' offered opportunities to assess an aedile's competence, generosity, and fitness for [[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Republic|higher office]].<ref>Aedileship was a rung on the [[Cursus honorum|ladder of Roman politics]], available to [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] and [[plebs|plebeians]] of wealth and high standing. Despite the sometimes crippling personal cost of running for office and providing \"extras\" for the ''ludi'', a successful aedile could secure popular favor and a substantial share of the vote at election time. [[Julius Caesar]] was among those who solidified his support through his lavish ''ludi'' as aedile.</ref> Some Circus events, however, seem to have been relatively small and intimate affairs. In 167 BC, \"[[tibicen|flute players]], scenic artists and dancers\" performed on a temporary stage, probably erected between the two central seating banks. Others were enlarged at enormous expense to fit the entire space. A ''[[venatio]]'' held there in 169 BC, one of several in the 2nd century, employed \"63 leopards and 40 bears and elephants\", with spectators presumably kept safe by a substantial barrier.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=71}}, A later iron cage-work barrier is evident at [[Pompey]]'s ''venatione'' of 55 BC.</ref>\n\nAs Rome's provinces expanded, existing ''ludi'' were embellished and new ''ludi'' invented by politicians who competed for divine and popular support. By the [[Roman Republic#From the Gracchi to Caesar (133\u201349 BC)|late Republic]], ''ludi'' were held on 57 days of the year;<ref name=\"auto1\">Bunson, Matthew, ''A Dictionary of the Roman Empire'', Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 246.</ref> an unknown number of these would have required full use of the Circus. On many other days, charioteers and jockeys would need to practice on its track. Otherwise, it would have made a convenient corral for the animals traded in the nearby [[Forum Boarium|cattle market]], just outside the starting gate. Beneath the outer stands, next to the Circus' multiple entrances, were workshops and shops. When no games were being held, the Circus at the time of [[Catullus]] (mid-1st century BC) was likely \"a dusty open space with shops and booths ... a colourful crowded disreputable area\"<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=72}}, citing [[T.

Over the several centuries of its development, the Circus Maximus became Rome's paramount specialist venue for chariot races. By the late 1st century AD, the [[Colosseum]] had been built to host most of the city's [[gladiator]] shows and smaller beast-hunts, and most track-athletes competed at the purpose-designed [[Stadium of Domitian]], though long-distance foot races were still held at the Circus.<ref>Extraordinarily long races of up to 128 miles, if [[Pliny the Elder]] is to be believed; see {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=71}}</ref> Eventually, 135 days of the year were devoted to ''ludi''.<ref name=\"auto1\" />\n\nEven at the height of its development as a chariot-racing circuit, the circus remained the most suitable space in Rome for religious processions on a grand scale, and was the most popular venue for large-scale ''venationes'';<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=71\u201372}}</ref> in the late 3rd century, the emperor [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] laid on a spectacular Circus show in which beasts were hunted through a veritable forest of trees, on a specially built stage.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=128}}, citing ''Historia Augusta'', Probus, 19.2\u20134.</ref> With the advent of Christianity as the official religion of the Empire, ''ludi'' gradually fell out of favour.

In Rome's early days, the valley would have been rich agricultural land, prone to flooding from the river [[Tiber]] and the stream which divided the valley. The stream was probably bridged at an early date, at the two points where the track had to cross it, and the earliest races would have been held within an agricultural landscape, \"with nothing more than turning posts, banks where spectators could sit, and some shrines and sacred spots\".<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=11}}. Humphrey describes this as \"like a Greek [[hippodrome]]\"</ref>\n\nIn [[Livy]]'s [[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|history of Rome]], the first [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[Roman Kingdom|king of Rome]] [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]] built raised, wooden perimeter seating at the Circus for Rome's highest echelons (the [[equites]] and [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]), probably midway along the Palatine straight, with an awning against the sun and rain. His grandson, [[Tarquinius Superbus]], added the first seating for citizen-commoners ([[plebs]], or plebeians), either adjacent or on the opposite, Aventine side of the track.<ref>The Aventine was a predominantly plebeian area.</ref> Otherwise, the Circus was probably still little more than a trackway through surrounding farmland. By this time, it may have been drained<ref>Tarquin might have employed the plebs in constructing a conduit or drain (cloaca) for Murcia's stream, discharging into the Tiber. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=67}}</ref> but the wooden stands and seats would have frequently rotted and been rebuilt. The turning posts (''metae''), each made of three conical stone pillars, may have been the earliest permanent Circus structures; an open drainage canal between the posts would have served as a dividing barrier.<ref>Etruscan tomb paintings of chariot races offer a possible seating model for this earliest phase; noble sponsors and other dignitaries sit in elevated stands, complete with awning. Commoners lounge or sit below, at ground level. At the early Circus Maximus, the sloping ground afforded the possibility of turf seating tiers at an early date \u2013 as imagined by [[Ovid]] in his account of the first Consualia \u2013 replaced with wooden seating tiers by later sponsors and benefactors. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=65\u201366, 68\u201369}}, for early ''metae'' and a possible canal as central dividing barrier, see summary on pp. 292\u20133.</ref>\n\n=== Republican era ===\nThe games' sponsor (Latin ''editor)'' usually sat beside the images of attending gods, on a conspicuous, elevated stand (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#pulvinar|pulvinar]]'') but seats at the track's perimeter offered the best, most dramatic close-ups. In 494 BC (very early in the [[Roman republic|Republican era]]) the [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Manius Valerius Maximus]] and his descendants were granted rights to a [[curule chair]] at the southeastern turn, an excellent viewpoint for the thrills and spills of chariot racing.<ref>In the earliest exercise of the right, a curule chair would have been brought to the spot; its permanent positioning there is unlikely. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=61}}</ref> In the 190s&nbsp;BC, stone track-side seating was built, exclusively for senators.<ref>Livy has the plebs seated \"promiscuously\" (''antea in promiscuo spectabant'') up to then: see {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=70}}</ref>\n\nPermanent wooden starting stalls were built in 329 BC. They were gated, brightly painted,<ref>Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, 8.20.1</ref> and staggered to equalise the distances from each start place to the central barrier. In theory, they might have accommodated up to 25 four-horse chariots ( [[Quadriga]]s ) abreast but when team-racing was introduced,<ref>Racing teams might have been used as early as the Regal era (according to some later Roman traditions), or as late as the end of the Punic Wars.</ref> they were widened, and their number reduced. By the late Republican or early Imperial era, there were twelve stalls. Their divisions were fronted by [[herma|herms]] that served as stops for spring-loaded gates, so that twelve light-weight, [[Quadriga|four-horse]] or [[Biga (chariot)|two-horse chariots]] could be simultaneously released onto the track. The stalls were allocated by lottery, and the various racing teams were identified by their colors.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=171}}; the gates probably used the same animal-sinew torsion springing as the Roman [[ballista]]; ''Ibid'', pp. 137\u2013138: opposing teams of Reds and Whites are prominent in late Republican literature, and Greens and Blues in the Imperial era. Some Roman authors held that team-racing in multiple colors dated back to the regal era. ''Ibid,'' p. 175 for allocation of stalls by lottery.</ref> Typically, there were seven laps per race.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/romans/empire/chariot.html|title=The Roman Empire: in the First Century.

See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=69, 97ff}}</ref> The track measured approximately 621&nbsp;m (2,037&nbsp;ft) in length and 150&nbsp;m (387&nbsp;ft) in breadth. A&nbsp;canal was cut between the track perimeter and its seating to protect spectators and help drain the track.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=75, 84}}</ref> The inner third of the seating formed a trackside ''[[cavea]]''. Its front sections along the central straight were reserved for senators, and those immediately behind for ''equites''. The outer tiers, two thirds of the total, were meant for Roman plebs and non-citizens. They were timber-built, with wooden-framed service buildings, shops and entrance-ways beneath. The total number of seats is uncertain, but was probably in the order of 150,000;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Circus-Maximus|title=Circus Maximus arena, Rome, Italy|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> [[Pliny the Elder]]'s estimate of 250,000 is unlikely.

It might represent a per foot run seating estimate, or include those watching from the nearby heights, outside the building proper. In late Imperial regionary catalogues, seating estimates for the Circus become even wilder; one gives an impossible 450,000 seats. Discussion is in {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=126}}</ref>\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n[[File:Sestertius Trajan Circus Maximus AD103.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Sestertius of Trajan celebrating the restoration of the Circus Maximus (minted 103 AD).<ref>Sear, David R.

London: Spink. {{ISBN|1-902040-45-7}}</ref>]]\n\nThe fire damage of 31 was probably repaired by Augustus (Caesar's successor and Rome's first emperor). He modestly claimed credit only for an obelisk and ''pulvinar'' at the site but both were major projects. Ever since its quarrying, long before Rome existed, the obelisk had been sacred to Egyptian Sun-gods.<ref>It was quarried and first dedicated in the reign of [[Seti I]]</ref> Augustus had it brought from [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]<ref name=\"auto3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/raising/rome.html|title=Mysteries of the Nile \u2013 A World of Obelisks: Rome|website=NOVA Online}}</ref> at enormous expense, and erected midway along the dividing barrier of the Circus. It was Rome's first obelisk, an exotically sacred object and a permanent reminder of Augustus' victory over his Roman foes and their Egyptian allies in the recent civil wars. Thanks to him, Rome had secured both a lasting peace and a new Egyptian Province. The ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#pulvinar|pulvinar]]'' was built on monumental scale, a shrine or temple (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#aedes|aedes]]'') raised high above the trackside seats. Sometimes, while games were in progress, Augustus watched from there, alongside the gods. Occasionally, his family would join him there. This is the Circus described by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] as \"one of the most beautiful and admirable structures in Rome\", with \"entrances and ascents for the spectators at every shop, so that the countless thousands of people may enter and depart without inconvenience.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=72\u201373}}. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] described the Circus and its seating c.30 BC\u2013AD 8. Augustus also rebuilt Ceres' temple, above the starting gates; it was probably damaged in the fire of 31 BC. ''Ibid,'' pp. 268\u2013272 for Augustus' obelisk.</ref>\n[[File:Topographical diagram of the Circus Maximus by Samuel Ball Platner.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Groundplan of the Circus Maximus, according to [[Samuel Ball Platner]], 1911. The staggered starting gates are to the left.]]\nThe site remained prone to flooding,<ref>The ''Ludi Martiales'' of AD 12 were temporarily transferred from the Circus, after a flood.</ref> probably through the starting gates, until [[Claudius]] made improvements there; they probably included an extramural anti-flooding embankment. Fires in the crowded, wooden perimeter workshops and bleachers were a far greater danger. A fire of 36 AD seems to have started in a basket-maker's workshop under the stands, on the Aventine side; the emperor [[Tiberius]] compensated various small businesses there for their losses.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=100\u2013101}}. Claudius' improvements at the Circus included stone-built or marble-clad starting stalls and rebuilt turning posts.</ref> In [[Great Fire of Rome|AD 64]], during [[Nero]]'s reign, fire broke out at the semi-circular end of the Circus, swept through the stands and shops, and destroyed much of the city. Games and festivals continued at the Circus, which was rebuilt over several years to the same footprint and design.<ref>Nero, inordinately fond of chariot-racing, may have considered the Circus rebuilding a priority but the overall cost of Rome's rebuilding must have proved an extraordinary drain on Imperial and public funds. Wooden bleachers for the Roman masses were an expedient, cost-effective solution. If Nero had grander plans for the Circus, they ended with his suicide under compulsion, after a coup d'etat in AD 68. {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=101}}</ref>\n\nBy the late 1st century AD, the central dividing barrier comprised a series of water basins, or else a single watercourse open in some places and bridged over in others. It offered opportunities for artistic embellishment and decorative swagger, and included the temples and statues of various deities, fountains, and refuges for those assistants involved in more dangerous circus activities, such as beast-hunts and the recovery of casualties during races.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=293\u2013294}}</ref>\n\nIn AD 81 the Senate built a triple arch honoring [[Titus]] at the semi-circular end of the Circus, to replace or augment a former processional entrance.<ref>This is not to be confused with the [[Arch of Titus]], built over the [[Via Sacra]] on the opposite side of the Palatine.</ref> The emperor [[Domitian]] built a new, multi-storey palace on the Palatine, connected somehow to the Circus; he likely watched the games in autocratic style, from high above and barely visible to those below. Repairs to fire damage during his reign may already have been under way before his assassination.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=74}}</ref>\n\nThe risk of further fire-damage, coupled with Domitian's fate, may have prompted [[Trajan]]'s decision to rebuild the Circus entirely in stone, and provide a new pulvinar in the stands where Rome's emperor could be seen and honoured as part of the Roman community, alongside their gods. Under Trajan, the Circus Maximus found its definitive form, which was unchanged thereafter save for some monumental additions by later emperors, an extensive, planned rebuilding of the starting gate area under [[Caracalla]], and repairs and renewals to existing fabric. Some repairs were unforeseen and extensive, such as those carried out in [[Diocletian]]'s reign, after the collapse of a seating section killed some 13,000 people.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=80, 102, 126\u20139}}</ref>\n\n== Religious significance ==\n{{Wide image|Circus Maximus in Rome.jpg|900px|The Circus Maximus site and the Palatine Hill in background|box width|center|alt=alt text}}\n\nThe southeastern turn of the track ran between two shrines which may have predated the Circus' formal development. One, located at the outer southeast perimeter, was dedicated to the valley's eponymous goddess [[Murcia (mythology)|Murcia]], an obscure deity associated with [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the [[Myrtus|myrtle]] shrub, a sacred spring, the stream that divided the valley, and the lesser peak of the Aventine Hill.<ref>The prestige attached to the [[curule chair]] granted [[Manius Valerius Maximus]] and his descendants in 494 BC would have been enhanced by its positioning close to this shrine. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=61}}</ref> The other was at the southeastern turning-post; where there was an underground shrine to [[Consus]], a minor god of grain-stores, connected to the grain-goddess [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and to the [[underworld]]. According to Roman tradition, [[Romulus]] discovered this shrine shortly after the [[founding of Rome]]. He invented the [[Consualia]] festival, as a way of gathering his Sabine neighbours at a celebration that included horse-races and drinking. During these distractions, Romulus's men then [[bride abduction|abducted]] the Sabine daughters as brides. Thus the famous [[Roman mythology|Roman myth]] of the [[Rape of the Sabine women]] had as its setting the Circus and the Consualia.\n\nIn this quasi-legendary era, horse or chariot races would have been held at the Circus site. The track width may have been determined by the distance between Murcia's and Consus' shrines at the southeastern end, and its length by the distance between these two shrines and [[Hercules]]' [[Ara Maxima]], supposedly older than Rome itself and sited behind the Circus' starting place.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=62}}</ref> The position of Consus' shrine at the turn of the track recalls the placing of shrines to Roman [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]'s Greek equivalent, [[Poseidon]], in Greek [[hippodrome]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=62}}; \"later Roman authors often reported the Consualia were held in honour of [[Neptune (mythology)#Neptunus equestris|Neptunus Equestris]].\"</ref> In later developments, the altar of Consus, as one of the Circus' [[tutelary deity|patron deities]], was incorporated into the fabric of the south-eastern turning post. When Murcia's stream was partly built over, to form a dividing barrier (the ''spina'' or ''euripus'')<ref>Most modern sources use ''spina'' (a spine) for the central barrier, based on a single, very late Roman source ([[Cassiodorus]]), but most Roman sources used ''euripus'', a Greek word meaning a channel, strait, or canal, and thus a barrier. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=175}}</ref> between the turning posts, her shrine was either retained or rebuilt. In the Late Imperial period, both the southeastern turn and the circus itself were sometimes known as ''Vallis Murcia''.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=61\u201362}}. For Murcia's shifting topographical associations, see Otto Skutsch, \"Enniana IV: Condendae urbis auspicia\", ''The Classical Quarterly, New Series'', Vol. 11, No. 2 (Nov., 1961), pp. 252\u201367.</ref> The symbols used to count race-laps also held religious significance; [[Castor and Pollux]], who were [[Leda (mythology)|born from an egg]], were patrons of horses, horsemen, and the [[equestrian order]] ''(equites)''. Likewise, the later use of dolphin-shaped lap counters reinforced associations between the races, swiftness, and [[Neptune (mythology)#Neptunus equestris|Neptune]], as god of earthquakes and horses; the Romans believed dolphins to be the swiftest of all creatures.<ref name=\"auto2\" /> When the Romans adopted the Phrygian [[Magna Mater|Great Mother]] as an ancestral deity, a statue of her on lion-back was erected within the circus, probably on the dividing barrier.\n\n[[File:Roman - Intaglio of a Circus with a Chariot Race - Walters 421314.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Jasper]] [[intaglio (sculpture)|intaglio]] (2nd century AD) depicting chariot races, with the three-pointed  ''metae'' at each end of the dividing barrier shown at top ([[Walters Art Museum]])]]\nSun and Moon cults were probably represented at the Circus from its earliest phases. Their importance grew with the introduction of Roman cult to Apollo, and the development of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] and solar monism as a theological basis for the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Roman Imperial cult]]. In the Imperial era, the Sun-god was divine patron of the Circus and its games. His sacred [[obelisk]] towered over the arena, set in the central barrier, close to his temple and the finishing line.  The Sun-god was the ultimate, victorious charioteer, driving his four-horse chariot (''[[quadriga]]'') through the heavenly circuit from sunrise to sunset. His partner Luna drove her two-horse chariot (''[[biga (chariot)|biga]]''); together, they represented the predictable, orderly movement of the cosmos and the circuit of time, which found analogy in the Circus track.<ref>Jean Sorabella, \"A Roman Sarcophagus and Its Patron\", ''Metropolitan Museum Journal'', Vol. 36, (2001), p. 75. See also Doro Levi, \"Aion\", ''Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens'', Vol. 13, 4, 1944, pp. 287ff.</ref> In Imperial cosmology, the emperor was Sol-Apollo's earthly equivalent, and Luna may have been linked to the empress.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}<!-- Emperor and Sol is covered by Humphrey but no RS as yet for Luna's Imperial equivalence in the reigning empress. Severan (Julia Domna) coins sorta suggest it but could equally show Cybele  --> Luna's temple, built long before Apollo's, burned down in the [[Great Fire of Rome|Great Fire of 64 AD]] and was probably not replaced. Her cult was closely identified with that of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], who seems to have been represented in the processions that started Circus games, and with [[Sol Indiges]], usually identified as her brother. After the loss of her temple, her cult may have been transferred to Sol's temple on the dividing barrier, or one beside it; both would have been open to the sky.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=61\u201364, 92\u201394, 270\u2013273}}</ref>\n\nTemples to several deities overlooked the Circus; most are now lost. The temples to [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]] stood close together on the Aventine, more or less opposite the Circus' starting gate, which remained under Hercules' protection. Further southeast along the Aventine was a temple to [[Temple of Luna|Luna]], the moon goddess. Aventine temples to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus Obsequens]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and [[Dis Pater|Dis]] (or perhaps [[Summanus]]) stood on the slopes above the southeast turn. On the Palatine hill, opposite to Ceres's temple, stood the temple to [[Temple of Cybele (Palatine)|Magna Mater]] and, more or less opposite Luna's temple, one to the sun-god [[Temple of Apollo Palatinus|Apollo]].\n\nSeveral festivals, some of uncertain foundation and date, were held at the Circus in historical times. The Consualia, with its semi-mythical establishment by Romulus, and the [[Cerealia]], the major festival of Ceres, were probably older than the earliest historically attested \"Roman Games\" ''([[Ludi Romani]])'' held at the Circus in honour of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] in 366 BC.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1.56.</ref> In the early Imperial era, [[Ovid]] describes the opening of Cerealia (mid to late April) with a horse race at the Circus,<ref>Wiseman, 1995, p.137.</ref> followed by the nighttime release of foxes into the stadium, their tails ablaze with lighted torches.<ref>See [[Barbette Spaeth|Spaeth, Barbette Stanley]], ''The Roman goddess Ceres'', University of Texas Press, 1996, pp. 36\u201337.</ref> Some early connection is likely between Ceres as goddess of grain crops and Consus as a god of grain storage and patron of the Circus.\n\n== Modern status and uses ==\n[[File:Circus-Maximus-June-1983.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ruins overlooking the Circus Maximus, seen from the Aventine (1983)]]\nAfter the 6th century, the Circus fell into disuse and decay, and was quarried for building materials. The lower levels, ever prone to flooding, were gradually buried under waterlogged alluvial soil and accumulated debris, so that the original track is now buried 6 meters beneath the modern surface. In the 11th century, the Circus was \"replaced by dwellings rented out by the congregation of Saint-Guy.\"<ref>Fran\u00e7oise Choay, (Trans. Lauren M.

It is often used for concerts and meetings. The [[Live 8 concert, Rome|Rome concert of Live 8]] (July 2, 2005) was held there. The English band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] performed a concert before an estimated audience of 500,000 people in 2007 (this was filmed and released as [[When in Rome 2007]]). [[The Rolling Stones]] played there in front of 71,527 people on June 22, 2014 for the Italian date of their [[14 On Fire]] tour. The Circus has also hosted victory celebrations, following the Italian [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup 2006]] victory and the [[A.S. Roma]] [[Serie A]] victory in 2001.
