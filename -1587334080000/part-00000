Four bytes are needed for characters in the [[Plane (Unicode)|other planes of Unicode]], which include less common [[CJK characters]], various historic scripts, mathematical symbols, and [[emoji]] (pictographic symbols).\n\nSome of the important features of this encoding are as follows:\n\n* ''Backward compatibility:'' Backwards compatibility with ASCII and the enormous amount of software designed to process ASCII-encoded text was the main driving force behind the design of UTF-8. In UTF-8, single bytes with values in the range of 0 to 127 map directly to Unicode code points in the ASCII range. Single bytes in this range represent characters, as they do in ASCII. Moreover, 7-bit bytes (bytes where the most significant bit is 0) never appear in a multi-byte sequence, and no valid multi-byte sequence decodes to an ASCII code-point. A sequence of 7-bit bytes is both valid ASCII and valid UTF-8, and under either interpretation represents the same sequence of characters. Therefore, the 7-bit bytes in a UTF-8 stream represent all and only the ASCII characters in the stream. Thus, many text processors, parsers, protocols, file formats, text display programs, etc., which use ASCII characters for formatting and control purposes, will continue to work as intended by treating the UTF-8 byte stream as a sequence of single-byte characters, without decoding the multi-byte sequences. ASCII characters on which the processing turns, such as punctuation, whitespace, and control characters will never be encoded as multi-byte sequences. It is therefore safe for such processors to simply ignore or pass-through the multi-byte sequences, without decoding them. For example, ASCII whitespace may be used to [[tokenize]] a UTF-8 stream into words; ASCII line-feeds may be used to split a UTF-8 stream into lines; and ASCII NUL characters can be used to split UTF-8-encoded data into null-terminated strings. Similarly, many format strings used by library functions like \"printf\" will correctly handle UTF-8-encoded input arguments.\n* {{anchor|fallback and auto-detection}}''Fallback and auto-detection:'' UTF-8 provided backwards compatibility for 7-bit ASCII, but much software and data uses 8-bit [[extended ASCII]] encodings designed prior to the adoption of Unicode to represent the character sets of European languages. Part of the popularity of UTF-8 is due to the fact that it provides a form of backward compatibility for these as well. A UTF-8 processor which erroneously receives an [[extended ASCII]] file as input can \"fall back\" or replace 8-bit bytes using the appropriate code-point in the Unicode [[Latin-1 Supplement]] block, when the 8-bit byte appears outside a valid multi-byte sequence. The bytes in extended ASCII encodings of \u201creal world\u201d text are typically not legal UTF-8 multi-byte sequences. This is because the bytes which ''introduce'' multi-byte sequences in UTF-8 are primarily accented letters (mostly vowels) in the common extended ASCII encodings, and the UTF-8 ''continuation'' bytes are punctuation and symbol characters. To appear as a valid UTF-8 multi-byte sequence, a series of 2 to 4 extended ASCII 8-bit characters would have to be an unusual combination of symbols and accented letters (such as an accented vowel followed immediately by certain punctuation). In short, real-world extended ASCII character sequences which look like valid UTF-8 multi-byte sequences are unlikely. Fallback errors will be false negatives, and these will be rare. Moreover, in many applications, such as text display, the consequence of incorrect fallback is usually slight. Only legibility is affected, and only for a few characters. These two things make fallback feasible, if somewhat imperfect. Indeed, as discussed further below, the [[HTML5]] standard requires that erroneous bytes in supposed UTF-8 data be replaced upon display on the assumption that they are [[Windows-1252]] characters. The presence of invalid 8-bit characters outside valid multi-byte sequences can also be used to \"auto-detect\" that an encoding is actually an extended ASCII encoding rather than UTF-8, and decode it accordingly. A UTF-8 stream may simply contain errors, resulting in the auto-detection scheme producing false positives; but auto-detection is successful in the majority of cases, especially with longer texts, and is widely used.\n* ''[[Prefix code]]:'' The first byte indicates the number of bytes in the sequence. Reading from a stream can instantaneously decode each individual fully received sequence, without first having to wait for either the first byte of a next sequence or an end-of-stream indication. The length of multi-byte sequences is easily determined by humans as it is simply the number of high-order 1s in the leading byte. An incorrect character will not be decoded if a stream ends mid-sequence.\n* ''[[Self-synchronizing code|Self-synchronization]]:'' The leading bytes and the continuation bytes do not share values (continuation bytes start with {{mono|10}} while single bytes start with {{mono|0}} and longer lead bytes start with {{mono|11}}). This means a search will not accidentally find the sequence for one character starting in the middle of another character. It also means the start of a character can be found from a random position by backing up at most 3 bytes to find the leading byte. An incorrect character will not be decoded if a stream starts mid-sequence, and a shorter sequence will never appear inside a longer one.\n* ''Sorting order:'' The chosen values of the leading bytes means that a list of UTF-8 strings can be sorted in code point order by sorting the corresponding byte sequences.\n\n===Examples===\nConsider the encoding of the [[Euro sign]], \u20ac:\n\n# The Unicode code point for \"\u20ac\" is U+20AC.\n# According to the scheme table above, this will take three bytes to encode, since it is between U+0800 and U+FFFF.\n#[[Hexadecimal]] {{mono|20AC}} is binary {{mono|{{fontcolor|blue|0010}} {{fontcolor|green|0000 10}}{{fontcolor|red|10 1100}}}}. The two leading zeros are added because, as the scheme table shows, a three-byte encoding needs exactly sixteen bits from the code point.\n# Because the encoding will be three bytes long, its leading byte starts with three 1s, then a 0 ({{mono|1110...}})\n# The four most significant bits of the code point are stored in the remaining low order four bits of this byte ({{mono|1110 {{fontcolor|blue|0010}}}}), leaving 12 bits of the code point yet to be encoded ({{mono|...{{fontcolor|green|0000 10}}{{fontcolor|red|10 1100}}}}).\n# All continuation bytes contain exactly six bits from the code point. So the next six bits of the code point are stored in the low order six bits of the next byte, and {{mono|10}} is stored in the high order two bits to mark it as a continuation byte (so {{mono|10{{fontcolor|green|00 0010}}}}).\n# Finally the last six bits of the code point are stored in the low order six bits of the final byte, and again {{mono|10}} is stored in the high order two bits ({{mono|10{{fontcolor|red|10 1100}}}}).\n\nThe three bytes {{mono|1110 {{fontcolor|blue|0010}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|green|00 0010}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|red|10 1100}}}} can be more concisely written in [[hexadecimal]], as {{mono|{{fontcolor|blue|E2}} {{fontcolor|green|82}} {{fontcolor|red|AC}}}}.\n\nThe following table summarises this conversion, as well as others with different lengths in UTF-8. The colors indicate how bits from the code point are distributed among the UTF-8 bytes. Additional bits added by the UTF-8 encoding process are shown in black.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 rowspan=2 | Character\n! colspan=2 | Code point\n! colspan=3 | UTF-8\n|-\n! Octal\n!

With a calculator which can convert between hexadecimal and octal it can be easier to manually create or interpret UTF-8 compared with using binary.\n\n* Octal 0\u2013177 (hex 0\u20137F) is coded with an unchanged single byte.\n* Octal 0200\u20133777 (hex 80\u20137FF) shall be coded with two bytes. xxyy will be 3xx 2yy.\n* Octal 4000\u201377777 (hex 800\u20137FFF) shall be coded with three bytes. xyyzz will be 34x 2yy 2zz.\n* Octal 100000\u2013177777 (hex 8000\u2013FFFF) shall be coded with three bytes. 1xyyzz will be 35x 2yy 2zz.\n* Octal 200000\u20134177777 (hex 10000\u201310FFFF) shall be coded with four bytes. wxxyyzz will be 36w 2xx 2yy 2zz.\nWhen converting UTF-8 into code points, the following rules apply:\n* Octal 302\u2013337 is the first of two bytes. 3xx 2yy will be xxyy in octal.\n* Octal 340\u2013347 is the first of three bytes. 34x 2yy 2zz will be xyyzz.\n* Octal 350\u2013357 is the first of three bytes. 35x 2yy 2zz will be 1xyyzz.\n* Octal 360\u2013364 is the first of four bytes. 36w 2xx 2yy 2zz will be wxxyyzz.\n* Octal 200\u2013277 are continuation bytes, and others beginning with 3 are invalid.\n\n===Codepage layout===\nThe following table summarizes usage of UTF-8 ''code units'' (individual bytes or octets) in a ''code'' page format. The upper half ({{mono|0_}} to {{mono|7_}}) is for bytes used only in single-byte codes, so it looks like a normal code page; the lower half is for continuation bytes ({{mono|8_}} to {{mono|B_}}) and leading bytes ({{mono|C_}} to {{mono|F_}}), and is explained further in the legend below.\n{| {{chset-tableformat}}\n{{chset-table-header|UTF-8}}\n|-\n!{{chset-left|0}}\n|

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Chset-tableformat -->\n\n{{colorbox|#d1f4ff}}{{nbsp}}Blue cells are 7-bit (single-byte) sequences. They must not be followed by a continuation byte.\n\n{{colorbox|#ffcc88}}{{nbsp}}Orange cells with a large dot are continuation bytes. The hexadecimal number shown after the {{mono|+}} symbol is the value of the 6 bits they add.\n\n{{colorbox|#fff}}{{nbsp}}White cells are the leading bytes for a sequence of multiple bytes, the length shown at the left edge of the row. The text shows the Unicode blocks encoded by sequences starting with this byte, and the hexadecimal code point shown in the cell is the lowest character value encoded using that leading byte.\n\n{{colorbox|red}}{{nbsp}}Red cells must never appear in a valid UTF-8 sequence. The first two red cells ({{mono|C0}} and {{mono|C1}}) could be used only for a 2-byte encoding of a 7-bit ASCII character which should be encoded in 1 byte; as described below, such \"overlong\" sequences are disallowed. The red cells in the {{mono|F_}} row ({{mono|F5}} to {{mono|FD}}) indicate leading bytes of 4-byte or longer sequences that cannot be valid because they would encode code points larger than the U+10FFFF limit of Unicode (a limit derived from the maximum code point encodable in [[UTF-16]]), and {{mono|FE}} and {{mono|FF}} were never defined for any purpose in UTF-8.\n\n{{colorbox|#fcc}}{{nbsp}}Pink cells are the leading bytes for a sequence of multiple bytes, of which some, but not all, possible continuation sequences are valid. {{mono|E0}} and {{mono|F0}} could start overlong encodings, in this case the lowest non-overlong-encoded code point is shown. {{mono|F4}} can start code points greater than U+10FFFF which are invalid. {{mono|ED}} can start the encoding of a code point in the range U+D800\u2013U+DFFF; these are invalid since they are reserved for UTF-16 [[Universal Character Set characters#Surrogates|surrogate halves]].\n\n===Overlong encodings===\nIn principle, it would be possible to inflate the number of bytes in an encoding by padding the code point with leading 0s. To encode the Euro sign \u20ac from the above example in four bytes instead of three, it could be padded with leading 0s until it was 21&nbsp;bits long{{snd}} {{mono|000 000010 000010 101100}}, and encoded as {{mono|11110{{fontcolor|#C000C0|000}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|blue|000010}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|green|000010}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|red|101100}}}} (or {{mono|{{fontcolor|#C000C0|F0}}}} {{mono|{{fontcolor|blue|82}}}} {{mono|{{fontcolor|green|82}}}} {{mono|{{fontcolor|red|AC}}}} in hexadecimal). This is called an ''overlong encoding''.\n\nThe standard specifies that the correct encoding of a code point use only the minimum number of bytes required to hold the significant bits of the code point. Longer encodings are called ''overlong'' and are not valid UTF-8 representations of the code point. This rule maintains a one-to-one correspondence between code points and their valid encodings, so that there is a unique valid encoding for each code point. This ensures that string comparisons and searches are well-defined.\n\n[[#Modified UTF-8|Modified UTF-8]] uses the two-byte overlong encoding of U+0000 (the [[Null character|NUL character]]) as {{mono|110{{fontcolor|green|00000}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|red|000000}}}} (hexadecimal {{mono|{{fontcolor|green|C0}}}} {{mono|{{fontcolor|red|80}}}}) instead of {{mono|00000000}} (hexadecimal {{mono|00}}). This allows the byte {{mono|00}} to be used as a [[null-terminated string|string terminator]].\n\n===Invalid byte sequences===\nNot all sequences of bytes are valid UTF-8. A UTF-8 decoder should be prepared for:\n\n* the red invalid bytes in the above table\n* an unexpected continuation byte\n* a non-continuation byte before the end of the character\n* the string ending before the end of the character (which can happen in simple string truncation)\n* an overlong encoding as described above\n* a sequence that decodes to an invalid code point as described below\n\nMany of the first UTF-8 decoders would decode these, ignoring incorrect bits and accepting overlong results. Carefully crafted invalid UTF-8 could make them either skip or create ASCII characters such as NUL, slash, or quotes. Invalid UTF-8 has been used to bypass security validations in high-profile products including Microsoft's [[Internet Information Services|IIS]] web server<ref name=\"MS00-078\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sans.org/resources/malwarefaq/wnt-unicode.php |author-first=Marvin |author-last=Marin |title=Web Server Folder Traversal MS00-078 |date=2000-10-17}}</ref> and Apache's Tomcat servlet container.<ref name=\"CVE-2008-2938\">{{cite web |url=https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2008-2938 |title=National Vulnerability Database \u2013 Summary for CVE-2008-2938}}</ref> <nowiki>RFC 3629</nowiki> states \"Implementations of the decoding algorithm MUST protect against decoding invalid sequences.\"<ref name=\"rfc3629\">{{Cite RFC |author-first=F. |author-last=Yergeau |title=RFC 3629 \u2013 UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]] |year=2003 |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629 |access-date=2015-02-03}}</ref> ''The Unicode Standard'' requires decoders to \"...treat any ill-formed code unit sequence as an error condition.

Replacement requires defining how many bytes are in the error:\n* Using the length defined by the lead byte (so that {{mono|E1,A0,C0}} is one error) is a bad idea, as a missing byte will cause the next character to become an error as well.\n* Since Unicode 6<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/ | title=Unicode 6.0.0}}</ref> (October 2010), the standard (chapter 3) has \u201crecommended\u201d a \"best practice\" where the error ends as soon as a disallowed byte is encountered. In these decoders {{mono|E1,A0,C0}} is two errors (2 bytes in the first one). This means an error is no more than three bytes long and never contains the start of a valid character, and there are 21,952 different possible errors.<ref>128 1-byte, (16+5)\u00d764 2-byte, and 5\u00d764\u00d764 3-byte. There may be somewhat fewer if more precise tests are done for each continuation byte.</ref> The standard also recommends replacing each error with the [[Specials (Unicode block)#Replacement character|replacement character]] \"\ufffd\" (U+FFFD).\n* Another popular practice is to turn each byte into an error. In this case {{mono|E1,A0,C0}} is three errors. This requires the UTF-8 parser to back up 2 bytes when an error is detected. The primary advantage is that there are now only 128 different errors. This allows the decoder to define 128 different error replacements such as:\n** The invalid Unicode code points U+DC80\u2013U+DCFF where the low eight bits are the byte's value.<ref name=\"Kuhn2000\">{{cite web |url=http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.internationalization.linux/920|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/20150315055005/http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.internationalization.linux/920|archivedate=2015-03-15|title=Substituting malformed UTF-8 sequences in a decoder |date=2000-07-23 |access-date=2014-09-25 |author-first=Markus |author-last=Kuhn |author-link=Markus Kuhn (computer scientist)}}</ref> Sometimes it is called UTF-8B.<ref name=\"Sittler2006\">{{cite web|url=http://bsittler.livejournal.com/10381.html |title=Binary vs. UTF-8, and why it need not matter |date=2006-04-02 |access-date=2014-09-25 |author-first=B. |author-last=Sittler |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723192908/http://bsittler.livejournal.com/10381.html |archivedate=2014-07-23 |df= }}</ref> <!-- Python 3.0 error replacement value --> This has the nice property that it makes invalid UTF-8 into invalid UTF-16.\n** The Unicode code points U+0080\u2013U+00FF with the same value as the byte, thus interpreting the bytes according to [[ISO/IEC 8859-1|ISO-8859-1]]{{Citation needed |date=August 2014}}<!-- very common in Linux and OS/X text rendering --> Care must be taken so that the [[C1 control codes]] such as [[Newline|NEL]] 0x0085 do not cause further code to misbehave.\n** The Unicode code point for the character represented by the byte in [[Windows-1252|CP1252]],{{Citation needed |date=August 2014}}<!-- Most modern browsers --> which is similar to using ISO-8859-1, except most bytes in the range 0x80\u20130x9F turn into printing characters. For example, 0x80 becomes the Euro sign, U+20AC. This makes text where legacy encodings are mixed with UTF-8 readable, and thus it is commonly done in browsers.\n\nThe large number of invalid byte sequences provides the advantage of making it easy to have a program accept both UTF-8 and legacy encodings such as ISO-8859-1. Software can check for UTF-8 correctness, and if that fails assume the input to be in the legacy encoding. It is technically true that this may detect an ISO-8859-1 string as UTF-8, but this is very unlikely if it contains any 8-bit bytes as they ''all'' have to be in unusual patterns of two or more in a row, such as \"\u00c2\u00a3\".\n\n===Invalid code points===\nSince RFC 3629 (November 2003), the high and low surrogate halves used by [[UTF-16]] (U+D800 through U+DFFF) and code points not encodable by UTF-16 (those after U+10FFFF) are not legal Unicode values, and their UTF-8 encoding must be treated as an invalid byte sequence.\n\nNot decoding unpaired surrogate halves makes it impossible to store invalid UTF-16 (such as Windows filenames or UTF-16 that has been split between the surrogates) as UTF-8. To preserve these invalid UTF-16 sequences, their corresponding UTF-8 encodings are sometimes allowed by implementations despite the above rule. There are attempts to define this behavior formally (see WTF-8 and CESU below).\n\n===Byte order mark===\n{{Main|Byte order mark}}<!-- but several statements here are ''not'' (yet) mentioned in the main article! -->\n\nMany [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] programs (including older versions of Windows [[Notepad (Windows)|Notepad]]) add the bytes {{mono|0xEF}}, {{mono|0xBB}}, {{mono|0xBF}} at the start of any document saved as UTF-8. This is the UTF-8 encoding of the Unicode [[byte order mark]] (BOM), and is commonly referred to as a UTF-8 BOM, even though byte order is irrelevant to UTF-8. While ASCII text encoded using UTF-8 normally is backwards compatible with ASCII, this is not true when Unicode Standard recommendations are ignored and a BOM is added. Non-UTF-8 software may show the BOM as three garbage characters, e.g. \"{{mono|\u00ef\u00bb\u00bf}}\" in software interpreting the document as [[ISO 8859-1]] or [[Windows-1252]], and \"{{mono|\u2229\u2557\u2510}}\" if interpreted as [[code page 437]]. This is an example of [[mojibake]], the output of garbled text when text is  decoded using an unintended character encoding.\n\nThe Unicode Standard neither requires nor recommends the use of the BOM for UTF-8, but warns that it may be encountered at the start of a file transcoded from another encoding.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/ch02.pdf |title=The Unicode Standard \u2013 Chapter 2 |page=30}}</ref> The presence of the UTF-8 BOM may cause problems with existing software that can handle UTF-8, for example:\n\n* Programming language parsers not explicitly designed for UTF-8 can often handle UTF-8 in string constants and comments, but cannot parse the UTF-8 BOM at the start of the file. <!-- Any program that does not change bytes with the high bit set in a quoted string is UTF-8 compatible -->\n* Programs that identify file types by leading characters may fail to identify the file if a UTF-8 BOM is present even if the user of the file can handle the BOM. An example is the Unix [[Shebang (Unix)|shebang]] syntax, another is [[Internet Explorer]] which will render pages in standards mode only when it starts with a [[document type declaration]].{{Citation needed|reason=Which IE versions?|date=December 2016}}\n* Programs that insert information at the start of a file will break use of the BOM to identify UTF-8 (one example is [[offline browser]]s that add the originating URL to the start of the file{{Citation needed|reason=Which ones? All or most?|date=December 2016}}).\n\nNonetheless, some software such as text editors will refuse to correctly display or interpret UTF-8 unless the text starts with a byte order mark or it contains only ASCII.{{Citation needed|reason=Which software?|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Official name and variants===\nThe official [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) code for the encoding is \"UTF-8\".<ref name=\"IANA_2013_CS\"/> All letters are upper-case, and the name is hyphenated.

The draft [[Universal Coded Character Set|ISO 10646]] standard contained a non-required [[Addendum|annex]] called [[UTF-1]] that provided a byte stream encoding of its [[32-bit]] code points. This encoding was not satisfactory on performance grounds, among other problems, and the biggest problem was probably that it did not have a clear separation between ASCII and non-ASCII: new UTF-1 tools would be backward compatible with ASCII-encoded text, but UTF-1-encoded text could confuse existing code expecting ASCII (or [[extended ASCII]]), because it could contain continuation bytes in the range 0x21\u20130x7E that meant something else in ASCII, e.g., 0x2F for '/', the [[Unix]] [[Path (computing)|path]] directory separator, and this example is reflected in the name and introductory text of its replacement. The table below was derived from a textual description in the annex.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+[[UTF-1]]\n|-\n!Number<br>of bytes!!First<br>code point!!Last<br>code point!!Byte 1!!Byte 2!!Byte 3!!Byte 4!!Byte 5\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |1\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+0000\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+009F\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |00\u20139F\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+00A0\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+00FF\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |A0\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |A0\u2013FF\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+0100\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+4015\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |A1\u2013F5\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |21\u20137E, A0\u2013FF\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |3\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+4016\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+38E2D\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |F6\u2013FB\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |21\u20137E, A0\u2013FF\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |21\u20137E, A0\u2013FF\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |5\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+38E2E\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+7FFFFFFF\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |FC\u2013FF\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |21\u20137E, A0\u2013FF\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |21\u20137E, A0\u2013FF\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |21\u20137E, A0\u2013FF\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |21\u20137E, A0\u2013FF\n|}\n\nIn July 1992, the [[X/Open]] committee XoJIG was looking for a better encoding. Dave Prosser of [[Unix System Laboratories]] submitted a proposal for one that had faster implementation characteristics and introduced the improvement that 7-bit ASCII characters would only represent themselves; all multi-byte sequences would include only bytes where the high bit was set.

A modification by [[Ken Thompson]] of the [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]] [[operating system]] group at [[Bell Labs]] made it somewhat less bit-efficient than the previous proposal but crucially allowed it to be [[Self-synchronizing code|self-synchronizing]], letting a reader start anywhere and immediately detect byte sequence boundaries. It also abandoned the use of biases and instead added the rule that only the shortest possible encoding is allowed; the additional loss in compactness is relatively insignificant, but readers now have to look out for invalid encodings to avoid reliability and especially security issues. Thompson's design was outlined on September 2, 1992, on a [[placemat]] in a New Jersey diner with [[Rob Pike]]. In the following days, Pike and Thompson implemented it and updated [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]] to use it throughout, and then communicated their success back to X/Open, which accepted it as the specification for FSS-UTF.<ref name=pikeviacambridge/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ FSS-UTF (1992) / UTF-8 (1993)<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n!Number<br>of bytes!!First<br>code point!!Last<br>code point!!Byte 1!!Byte 2!!Byte 3!!Byte 4!!Byte 5!!Byte 6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |1\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+0000\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+007F\n|{{mono|0xxxxxxx}}\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+0080\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+07FF\n|{{mono|110xxxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |3\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+0800\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+FFFF\n|{{mono|1110xxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |4\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+10000\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+1FFFFF\n|{{mono|11110xxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |5\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+200000\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+3FFFFFF\n|{{mono|111110xx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |6\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+4000000\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+7FFFFFFF\n|{{mono|1111110x}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}\n|}\n\nUTF-8 was first officially presented at the [[USENIX]] conference in [[San Diego]], from January 25 to 29, 1993.

For many scripts there have been more than one single-byte encoding in usage, so even knowing the script was insufficient information to display it correctly.\n* The bytes 0xFE and 0xFF do not appear, so a valid UTF-8 stream never matches the UTF-16 [[byte order mark]] and thus cannot be confused with it. The absence of 0xFF (0377) also eliminates the need to escape this byte in [[Telnet]] (and FTP control connection).\n* UTF-8 encoded text is larger than specialized single-byte encodings except for plain ASCII characters. In the case of scripts which used 8-bit character sets with non-Latin characters encoded in the upper half (such as most [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and [[Greek alphabet]] code pages), characters in UTF-8 will be double the size. For some scripts, such as [[Thai alphabet|Thai]] and [[Devanagari]] (which is used by various South Asian languages), characters will triple in size. There are even examples where a single byte turns into a composite character in Unicode and is thus six times larger in UTF-8. This has caused objections in India and other countries.\n*  It is possible in UTF-8 (or any other variable-length encoding) to split or [[Data truncation|truncate]] a string in the middle of a character. If the two pieces are not re-appended later before interpretation as characters, this can introduce an invalid sequence at both the end of the previous section and the start of the next, and some decoders will not preserve these bytes and result in data loss. Because UTF-8 is self-synchronizing this will however never introduce a different valid character, and it is also fairly easy to move the truncation point backwards to the start of a character.\n* If the code points are all the same size, measurements of a fixed number of them is easy. Due to ASCII-era documentation where \"character\" is used as a synonym for \"byte\" this is often considered important. However, by measuring string positions using bytes instead of \"characters\" most algorithms can be easily and efficiently adapted for UTF-8. Searching for a string within a long string can for example be done byte by byte; the self-synchronization property prevents false positives.\n\n===Comparison with other multi-byte encodings===\n* UTF-8 can encode any [[Unicode]] character. Files in different scripts can be displayed correctly without having to choose the correct code page or font. For instance, Chinese and Arabic can be written in the same file without specialised markup or manual settings that specify an encoding.\n* UTF-8 is [[Self-synchronizing code|self-synchronizing]]: character boundaries are easily identified by scanning for well-defined bit patterns in either direction. If bytes are lost due to error or [[data corruption|corruption]], one can always locate the next valid character and resume processing. If there is a need to shorten a string to fit a specified field, the previous valid character can easily be found. Many multi-byte encodings such as {{nowrap|Shift JIS}} are much harder to resynchronize. This also means that [[byte-oriented protocol|byte-oriented]] [[string-searching algorithm]]s can be used with UTF-8 (as a character is the same as a \"word\" made up of that many bytes), optimized versions of byte searches can be much faster due to hardware support and lookup tables that have only 256 entries.\n* Efficient to encode using simple [[bitwise operation]]s. UTF-8 does not require slower mathematical operations such as multiplication or division (unlike {{nowrap|Shift JIS}}, {{nowrap|[[GB 2312]]}} and other encodings).\n* UTF-8 will take more space than a multi-byte encoding designed for a specific script. East Asian legacy encodings generally used two bytes per character yet take three bytes per character in UTF-8. Self-synchronization also takes more space.\n\n===Comparison with UTF-16===\n{{See also|Comparison of Unicode encodings}}\n\n* Byte encodings and UTF-8 are represented by byte arrays in programs, and often nothing needs to be done to a function when converting from a byte encoding to UTF-8. [[UTF-16]] is represented by 16-bit word arrays, and converting to UTF-16 while maintaining compatibility with existing [[ASCII]]-based programs (such as was done with Windows) requires ''every'' API and data structure that takes a string to be duplicated, one version accepting byte strings and another version accepting UTF-16.\n* Text encoded in UTF-8 will be smaller than the same text encoded in UTF-16 if there are more code points below U+0080 than in the range U+0800..U+FFFF. This is true for all modern European languages.\n** Text in (for example) Chinese, Japanese or Devanagari will take more space in UTF-8 if there are more of these characters than there are ASCII characters. This is likely when data mainly consist of pure prose, but is lessened by the degree to which the context uses ASCII whitespace, digits, and punctuation.<ref group=\"nb\">The 2010-11-22 version of [[:hi:\u092f\u0942\u0928\u093f\u0915\u094b\u0921|\u092f\u0942\u0928\u093f\u0915\u094b\u0921]] (Unicode in Hindi), when the pure text was pasted to Notepad, generated 19&nbsp;KB when saved as UTF-16 and 22&nbsp;KB when saved as UTF-8.</ref>\n** Most of the [[formatted text|rich text formats]] (including HTML) contain a large proportion of ASCII characters for the sake of formatting, thus the size usually will be reduced significantly compared with UTF-16, even when the language mostly uses 3-byte long characters in UTF-8.<ref group=\"nb\">The 2010-10-27 version of [[:ja:UTF-8|UTF-8]] (in Japanese) generated 169&nbsp;KB when converted with Notepad to UTF-16, and only 101&nbsp;KB when converted back to UTF-8.

In such programs each half of a UTF-16 surrogate pair is encoded as its own three-byte UTF-8 encoding, resulting in six-byte sequences rather than four bytes for characters outside the [[Basic Multilingual Plane]]. [[Oracle Database|Oracle]] and [[MySQL]] databases use this, as well as Java and Tcl as described below, and probably many Windows programs where the programmers were unaware of the complexities of UTF-16.

Four bytes are needed for characters in the [[Plane (Unicode)|other planes of Unicode]], which include less common [[CJK characters]], various historic scripts, mathematical symbols, and [[emoji]] (pictographic symbols).\n\nSome of the important features of this encoding are as follows:\n\n* ''Backward compatibility:'' Backwards compatibility with ASCII and the enormous amount of software designed to process ASCII-encoded text was the main driving force behind the design of UTF-8. In UTF-8, single bytes with values in the range of 0 to 127 map directly to Unicode code points in the ASCII range. Single bytes in this range represent characters, as they do in ASCII. Moreover, 7-bit bytes (bytes where the most significant bit is 0) never appear in a multi-byte sequence, and no valid multi-byte sequence decodes to an ASCII code-point. A sequence of 7-bit bytes is both valid ASCII and valid UTF-8, and under either interpretation represents the same sequence of characters. Therefore, the 7-bit bytes in a UTF-8 stream represent all and only the ASCII characters in the stream. Thus, many text processors, parsers, protocols, file formats, text display programs, etc., which use ASCII characters for formatting and control purposes, will continue to work as intended by treating the UTF-8 byte stream as a sequence of single-byte characters, without decoding the multi-byte sequences. ASCII characters on which the processing turns, such as punctuation, whitespace, and control characters will never be encoded as multi-byte sequences. It is therefore safe for such processors to simply ignore or pass-through the multi-byte sequences, without decoding them. For example, ASCII whitespace may be used to [[tokenize]] a UTF-8 stream into words; ASCII line-feeds may be used to split a UTF-8 stream into lines; and ASCII NUL characters can be used to split UTF-8-encoded data into null-terminated strings. Similarly, many format strings used by library functions like \"printf\" will correctly handle UTF-8-encoded input arguments.\n* {{anchor|fallback and auto-detection}}''Fallback and auto-detection:'' UTF-8 provided backwards compatibility for 7-bit ASCII, but much software and data uses 8-bit [[extended ASCII]] encodings designed prior to the adoption of Unicode to represent the character sets of European languages. Part of the popularity of UTF-8 is due to the fact that it provides a form of backward compatibility for these as well. A UTF-8 processor which erroneously receives an [[extended ASCII]] file as input can \"fall back\" or replace 8-bit bytes using the appropriate code-point in the Unicode [[Latin-1 Supplement]] block, when the 8-bit byte appears outside a valid multi-byte sequence. The bytes in extended ASCII encodings of \u201creal world\u201d text are typically not legal UTF-8 multi-byte sequences. This is because the bytes which ''introduce'' multi-byte sequences in UTF-8 are primarily accented letters (mostly vowels) in the common extended ASCII encodings, and the UTF-8 ''continuation'' bytes are punctuation and symbol characters. To appear as a valid UTF-8 multi-byte sequence, a series of 2 to 4 extended ASCII 8-bit characters would have to be an unusual combination of symbols and accented letters (such as an accented vowel followed immediately by certain punctuation). In short, real-world extended ASCII character sequences which look like valid UTF-8 multi-byte sequences are unlikely. Fallback errors will be false negatives, and these will be rare. Moreover, in many applications, such as text display, the consequence of incorrect fallback is usually slight. Only legibility is affected, and only for a few characters. These two things make fallback feasible, if somewhat imperfect. Indeed, as discussed further below, the [[HTML5]] standard requires that erroneous bytes in supposed UTF-8 data be replaced upon display on the assumption that they are [[Windows-1252]] characters. The presence of invalid 8-bit characters outside valid multi-byte sequences can also be used to \"auto-detect\" that an encoding is actually an extended ASCII encoding rather than UTF-8, and decode it accordingly. A UTF-8 stream may simply contain errors, resulting in the auto-detection scheme producing false positives; but auto-detection is successful in the majority of cases, especially with longer texts, and is widely used.\n* ''[[Prefix code]]:'' The first byte indicates the number of bytes in the sequence. Reading from a stream can instantaneously decode each individual fully received sequence, without first having to wait for either the first byte of a next sequence or an end-of-stream indication. The length of multi-byte sequences is easily determined by humans as it is simply the number of high-order 1s in the leading byte. An incorrect character will not be decoded if a stream ends mid-sequence.\n* ''[[Self-synchronizing code|Self-synchronization]]:'' The leading bytes and the continuation bytes do not share values (continuation bytes start with {{mono|10}} while single bytes start with {{mono|0}} and longer lead bytes start with {{mono|11}}). This means a search will not accidentally find the sequence for one character starting in the middle of another character. It also means the start of a character can be found from a random position by backing up at most 3 bytes to find the leading byte. An incorrect character will not be decoded if a stream starts mid-sequence, and a shorter sequence will never appear inside a longer one.\n* ''Sorting order:'' The chosen values of the leading bytes means that a list of UTF-8 strings can be sorted in code point order by sorting the corresponding byte sequences.\n\n===Examples===\nConsider the encoding of the [[Euro sign]], \u20ac:\n\n# The Unicode code point for \"\u20ac\" is U+20AC.\n# According to the scheme table above, this will take three bytes to encode, since it is between U+0800 and U+FFFF.\n#[[Hexadecimal]] {{mono|20AC}} is binary {{mono|{{fontcolor|blue|0010}} {{fontcolor|green|0000 10}}{{fontcolor|red|10 1100}}}}. The two leading zeros are added because, as the scheme table shows, a three-byte encoding needs exactly sixteen bits from the code point.\n# Because the encoding will be three bytes long, its leading byte starts with three 1s, then a 0 ({{mono|1110...}})\n# The four most significant bits of the code point are stored in the remaining low order four bits of this byte ({{mono|1110 {{fontcolor|blue|0010}}}}), leaving 12 bits of the code point yet to be encoded ({{mono|...{{fontcolor|green|0000 10}}{{fontcolor|red|10 1100}}}}).\n# All continuation bytes contain exactly six bits from the code point. So the next six bits of the code point are stored in the low order six bits of the next byte, and {{mono|10}} is stored in the high order two bits to mark it as a continuation byte (so {{mono|10{{fontcolor|green|00 0010}}}}).\n# Finally the last six bits of the code point are stored in the low order six bits of the final byte, and again {{mono|10}} is stored in the high order two bits ({{mono|10{{fontcolor|red|10 1100}}}}).\n\nThe three bytes {{mono|1110 {{fontcolor|blue|0010}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|green|00 0010}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|red|10 1100}}}} can be more concisely written in [[hexadecimal]], as {{mono|{{fontcolor|blue|E2}} {{fontcolor|green|82}} {{fontcolor|red|AC}}}}.\n\nThe following table summarises this conversion, as well as others with different lengths in UTF-8. The colors indicate how bits from the code point are distributed among the UTF-8 bytes. Additional bits added by the UTF-8 encoding process are shown in black.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 rowspan=2 | Character\n! colspan=2 | Code point\n! colspan=3 | UTF-8\n|-\n! Octal\n!

With a calculator which can convert between hexadecimal and octal it can be easier to manually create or interpret UTF-8 compared with using binary.\n\n* Octal 0\u2013177 (hex 0\u20137F) is coded with an unchanged single byte.\n* Octal 0200\u20133777 (hex 80\u20137FF) shall be coded with two bytes. xxyy will be 3xx 2yy.\n* Octal 4000\u201377777 (hex 800\u20137FFF) shall be coded with three bytes. xyyzz will be 34x 2yy 2zz.\n* Octal 100000\u2013177777 (hex 8000\u2013FFFF) shall be coded with three bytes. 1xyyzz will be 35x 2yy 2zz.\n* Octal 200000\u20134177777 (hex 10000\u201310FFFF) shall be coded with four bytes. wxxyyzz will be 36w 2xx 2yy 2zz.\nWhen converting UTF-8 into code points, the following rules apply:\n* Octal 302\u2013337 is the first of two bytes. 3xx 2yy will be xxyy in octal.\n* Octal 340\u2013347 is the first of three bytes. 34x 2yy 2zz will be xyyzz.\n* Octal 350\u2013357 is the first of three bytes. 35x 2yy 2zz will be 1xyyzz.\n* Octal 360\u2013364 is the first of four bytes. 36w 2xx 2yy 2zz will be wxxyyzz.\n* Octal 200\u2013277 are continuation bytes, and others beginning with 3 are invalid.\n\n===Codepage layout===\nThe following table summarizes usage of UTF-8 ''code units'' (individual bytes or octets) in a ''code'' page format. The upper half ({{mono|0_}} to {{mono|7_}}) is for bytes used only in single-byte codes, so it looks like a normal code page; the lower half is for continuation bytes ({{mono|8_}} to {{mono|B_}}) and leading bytes ({{mono|C_}} to {{mono|F_}}), and is explained further in the legend below.\n{| {{chset-tableformat}}\n{{chset-table-header|UTF-8}}\n|-\n!{{chset-left|0}}\n|

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Chset-tableformat -->\n\n{{colorbox|#d1f4ff}}{{nbsp}}Blue cells are 7-bit (single-byte) sequences. They must not be followed by a continuation byte.\n\n{{colorbox|#ffcc88}}{{nbsp}}Orange cells with a large dot are continuation bytes. The hexadecimal number shown after the {{mono|+}} symbol is the value of the 6 bits they add.\n\n{{colorbox|#fff}}{{nbsp}}White cells are the leading bytes for a sequence of multiple bytes, the length shown at the left edge of the row. The text shows the Unicode blocks encoded by sequences starting with this byte, and the hexadecimal code point shown in the cell is the lowest character value encoded using that leading byte.\n\n{{colorbox|red}}{{nbsp}}Red cells must never appear in a valid UTF-8 sequence. The first two red cells ({{mono|C0}} and {{mono|C1}}) could be used only for a 2-byte encoding of a 7-bit ASCII character which should be encoded in 1 byte; as described below, such \"overlong\" sequences are disallowed. The red cells in the {{mono|F_}} row ({{mono|F5}} to {{mono|FD}}) indicate leading bytes of 4-byte or longer sequences that cannot be valid because they would encode code points larger than the U+10FFFF limit of Unicode (a limit derived from the maximum code point encodable in [[UTF-16]]), and {{mono|FE}} and {{mono|FF}} were never defined for any purpose in UTF-8.\n\n{{colorbox|#fcc}}{{nbsp}}Pink cells are the leading bytes for a sequence of multiple bytes, of which some, but not all, possible continuation sequences are valid. {{mono|E0}} and {{mono|F0}} could start overlong encodings, in this case the lowest non-overlong-encoded code point is shown. {{mono|F4}} can start code points greater than U+10FFFF which are invalid. {{mono|ED}} can start the encoding of a code point in the range U+D800\u2013U+DFFF; these are invalid since they are reserved for UTF-16 [[Universal Character Set characters#Surrogates|surrogate halves]].\n\n===Overlong encodings===\nIn principle, it would be possible to inflate the number of bytes in an encoding by padding the code point with leading 0s. To encode the Euro sign \u20ac from the above example in four bytes instead of three, it could be padded with leading 0s until it was 21&nbsp;bits long{{snd}} {{mono|000 000010 000010 101100}}, and encoded as {{mono|11110{{fontcolor|#C000C0|000}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|blue|000010}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|green|000010}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|red|101100}}}} (or {{mono|{{fontcolor|#C000C0|F0}}}} {{mono|{{fontcolor|blue|82}}}} {{mono|{{fontcolor|green|82}}}} {{mono|{{fontcolor|red|AC}}}} in hexadecimal). This is called an ''overlong encoding''.\n\nThe standard specifies that the correct encoding of a code point use only the minimum number of bytes required to hold the significant bits of the code point. Longer encodings are called ''overlong'' and are not valid UTF-8 representations of the code point. This rule maintains a one-to-one correspondence between code points and their valid encodings, so that there is a unique valid encoding for each code point. This ensures that string comparisons and searches are well-defined.\n\n[[#Modified UTF-8|Modified UTF-8]] uses the two-byte overlong encoding of U+0000 (the [[Null character|NUL character]]) as {{mono|110{{fontcolor|green|00000}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|red|000000}}}} (hexadecimal {{mono|{{fontcolor|green|C0}}}} {{mono|{{fontcolor|red|80}}}}) instead of {{mono|00000000}} (hexadecimal {{mono|00}}). This allows the byte {{mono|00}} to be used as a [[null-terminated string|string terminator]].\n\n===Invalid byte sequences===\nNot all sequences of bytes are valid UTF-8. A UTF-8 decoder should be prepared for:\n\n* the red invalid bytes in the above table\n* an unexpected continuation byte\n* a non-continuation byte before the end of the character\n* the string ending before the end of the character (which can happen in simple string truncation)\n* an overlong encoding as described above\n* a sequence that decodes to an invalid code point as described below\n\nMany of the first UTF-8 decoders would decode these, ignoring incorrect bits and accepting overlong results. Carefully crafted invalid UTF-8 could make them either skip or create ASCII characters such as NUL, slash, or quotes. Invalid UTF-8 has been used to bypass security validations in high-profile products including Microsoft's [[Internet Information Services|IIS]] web server<ref name=\"MS00-078\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sans.org/resources/malwarefaq/wnt-unicode.php |author-first=Marvin |author-last=Marin |title=Web Server Folder Traversal MS00-078 |date=2000-10-17}}</ref> and Apache's Tomcat servlet container.<ref name=\"CVE-2008-2938\">{{cite web |url=https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2008-2938 |title=National Vulnerability Database \u2013 Summary for CVE-2008-2938}}</ref> <nowiki>RFC 3629</nowiki> states \"Implementations of the decoding algorithm MUST protect against decoding invalid sequences.\"<ref name=\"rfc3629\">{{Cite RFC |author-first=F. |author-last=Yergeau |title=RFC 3629 \u2013 UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]] |year=2003 |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629 |access-date=2015-02-03}}</ref> ''The Unicode Standard'' requires decoders to \"...treat any ill-formed code unit sequence as an error condition.

Replacement requires defining how many bytes are in the error:\n* Using the length defined by the lead byte (so that {{mono|E1,A0,C0}} is one error) is a bad idea, as a missing byte will cause the next character to become an error as well.\n* Since Unicode 6<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/ | title=Unicode 6.0.0}}</ref> (October 2010), the standard (chapter 3) has \u201crecommended\u201d a \"best practice\" where the error ends as soon as a disallowed byte is encountered. In these decoders {{mono|E1,A0,C0}} is two errors (2 bytes in the first one). This means an error is no more than three bytes long and never contains the start of a valid character, and there are 21,952 different possible errors.<ref>128 1-byte, (16+5)\u00d764 2-byte, and 5\u00d764\u00d764 3-byte. There may be somewhat fewer if more precise tests are done for each continuation byte.</ref> The standard also recommends replacing each error with the [[Specials (Unicode block)#Replacement character|replacement character]] \"\ufffd\" (U+FFFD).\n* Another popular practice is to turn each byte into an error. In this case {{mono|E1,A0,C0}} is three errors. This requires the UTF-8 parser to back up 2 bytes when an error is detected. The primary advantage is that there are now only 128 different errors. This allows the decoder to define 128 different error replacements such as:\n** The invalid Unicode code points U+DC80\u2013U+DCFF where the low eight bits are the byte's value.<ref name=\"Kuhn2000\">{{cite web |url=http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.internationalization.linux/920|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/20150315055005/http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.internationalization.linux/920|archivedate=2015-03-15|title=Substituting malformed UTF-8 sequences in a decoder |date=2000-07-23 |access-date=2014-09-25 |author-first=Markus |author-last=Kuhn |author-link=Markus Kuhn (computer scientist)}}</ref> Sometimes it is called UTF-8B.<ref name=\"Sittler2006\">{{cite web|url=http://bsittler.livejournal.com/10381.html |title=Binary vs. UTF-8, and why it need not matter |date=2006-04-02 |access-date=2014-09-25 |author-first=B. |author-last=Sittler |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723192908/http://bsittler.livejournal.com/10381.html |archivedate=2014-07-23 |df= }}</ref> <!-- Python 3.0 error replacement value --> This has the nice property that it makes invalid UTF-8 into invalid UTF-16.\n** The Unicode code points U+0080\u2013U+00FF with the same value as the byte, thus interpreting the bytes according to [[ISO/IEC 8859-1|ISO-8859-1]]{{Citation needed |date=August 2014}}<!-- very common in Linux and OS/X text rendering --> Care must be taken so that the [[C1 control codes]] such as [[Newline|NEL]] 0x0085 do not cause further code to misbehave.\n** The Unicode code point for the character represented by the byte in [[Windows-1252|CP1252]],{{Citation needed |date=August 2014}}<!-- Most modern browsers --> which is similar to using ISO-8859-1, except most bytes in the range 0x80\u20130x9F turn into printing characters. For example, 0x80 becomes the Euro sign, U+20AC. This makes text where legacy encodings are mixed with UTF-8 readable, and thus it is commonly done in browsers.\n\nThe large number of invalid byte sequences provides the advantage of making it easy to have a program accept both UTF-8 and legacy encodings such as ISO-8859-1. Software can check for UTF-8 correctness, and if that fails assume the input to be in the legacy encoding. It is technically true that this may detect an ISO-8859-1 string as UTF-8, but this is very unlikely if it contains any 8-bit bytes as they ''all'' have to be in unusual patterns of two or more in a row, such as \"\u00c2\u00a3\".\n\n===Invalid code points===\nSince RFC 3629 (November 2003), the high and low surrogate halves used by [[UTF-16]] (U+D800 through U+DFFF) and code points not encodable by UTF-16 (those after U+10FFFF) are not legal Unicode values, and their UTF-8 encoding must be treated as an invalid byte sequence.\n\nNot decoding unpaired surrogate halves makes it impossible to store invalid UTF-16 (such as Windows filenames or UTF-16 that has been split between the surrogates) as UTF-8. To preserve these invalid UTF-16 sequences, their corresponding UTF-8 encodings are sometimes allowed by implementations despite the above rule. There are attempts to define this behavior formally (see WTF-8 and CESU below).\n\n===Byte order mark===\n{{Main|Byte order mark}}<!-- but several statements here are ''not'' (yet) mentioned in the main article! -->\n\nMany [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] programs (including older versions of Windows [[Notepad (Windows)|Notepad]]) add the bytes {{mono|0xEF}}, {{mono|0xBB}}, {{mono|0xBF}} at the start of any document saved as UTF-8. This is the UTF-8 encoding of the Unicode [[byte order mark]] (BOM), and is commonly referred to as a UTF-8 BOM, even though byte order is irrelevant to UTF-8. While ASCII text encoded using UTF-8 normally is backwards compatible with ASCII, this is not true when Unicode Standard recommendations are ignored and a BOM is added. Non-UTF-8 software may show the BOM as three garbage characters, e.g. \"{{mono|\u00ef\u00bb\u00bf}}\" in software interpreting the document as [[ISO 8859-1]] or [[Windows-1252]], and \"{{mono|\u2229\u2557\u2510}}\" if interpreted as [[code page 437]]. This is an example of [[mojibake]], the output of garbled text when text is  decoded using an unintended character encoding.\n\nThe Unicode Standard neither requires nor recommends the use of the BOM for UTF-8, but warns that it may be encountered at the start of a file transcoded from another encoding.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/ch02.pdf |title=The Unicode Standard \u2013 Chapter 2 |page=30}}</ref> The presence of the UTF-8 BOM may cause problems with existing software that can handle UTF-8, for example:\n\n* Programming language parsers not explicitly designed for UTF-8 can often handle UTF-8 in string constants and comments, but cannot parse the UTF-8 BOM at the start of the file. <!-- Any program that does not change bytes with the high bit set in a quoted string is UTF-8 compatible -->\n* Programs that identify file types by leading characters may fail to identify the file if a UTF-8 BOM is present even if the user of the file can handle the BOM. An example is the Unix [[Shebang (Unix)|shebang]] syntax, another is [[Internet Explorer]] which will render pages in standards mode only when it starts with a [[document type declaration]].{{Citation needed|reason=Which IE versions?|date=December 2016}}\n* Programs that insert information at the start of a file will break use of the BOM to identify UTF-8 (one example is [[offline browser]]s that add the originating URL to the start of the file{{Citation needed|reason=Which ones? All or most?|date=December 2016}}).\n\nNonetheless, some software such as text editors will refuse to correctly display or interpret UTF-8 unless the text starts with a byte order mark or it contains only ASCII.{{Citation needed|reason=Which software?|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Official name and variants===\nThe official [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) code for the encoding is \"UTF-8\".<ref name=\"IANA_2013_CS\"/> All letters are upper-case, and the name is hyphenated.

The draft [[Universal Coded Character Set|ISO 10646]] standard contained a non-required [[Addendum|annex]] called [[UTF-1]] that provided a byte stream encoding of its [[32-bit]] code points. This encoding was not satisfactory on performance grounds, among other problems, and the biggest problem was probably that it did not have a clear separation between ASCII and non-ASCII: new UTF-1 tools would be backward compatible with ASCII-encoded text, but UTF-1-encoded text could confuse existing code expecting ASCII (or [[extended ASCII]]), because it could contain continuation bytes in the range 0x21\u20130x7E that meant something else in ASCII, e.g., 0x2F for '/', the [[Unix]] [[Path (computing)|path]] directory separator, and this example is reflected in the name and introductory text of its replacement. The table below was derived from a textual description in the annex.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+[[UTF-1]]\n|-\n!Number<br>of bytes!!First<br>code point!!Last<br>code point!!Byte 1!!Byte 2!!Byte 3!!Byte 4!!Byte 5\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |1\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+0000\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+009F\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |00\u20139F\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+00A0\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+00FF\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |A0\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |A0\u2013FF\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+0100\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+4015\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |A1\u2013F5\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |21\u20137E, A0\u2013FF\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |3\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+4016\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+38E2D\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |F6\u2013FB\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |21\u20137E, A0\u2013FF\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |21\u20137E, A0\u2013FF\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |5\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+38E2E\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+7FFFFFFF\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |FC\u2013FF\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |21\u20137E, A0\u2013FF\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |21\u20137E, A0\u2013FF\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |21\u20137E, A0\u2013FF\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |21\u20137E, A0\u2013FF\n|}\n\nIn July 1992, the [[X/Open]] committee XoJIG was looking for a better encoding. Dave Prosser of [[Unix System Laboratories]] submitted a proposal for one that had faster implementation characteristics and introduced the improvement that 7-bit ASCII characters would only represent themselves; all multi-byte sequences would include only bytes where the high bit was set.

A modification by [[Ken Thompson]] of the [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]] [[operating system]] group at [[Bell Labs]] made it somewhat less bit-efficient than the previous proposal but crucially allowed it to be [[Self-synchronizing code|self-synchronizing]], letting a reader start anywhere and immediately detect byte sequence boundaries. It also abandoned the use of biases and instead added the rule that only the shortest possible encoding is allowed; the additional loss in compactness is relatively insignificant, but readers now have to look out for invalid encodings to avoid reliability and especially security issues. Thompson's design was outlined on September 2, 1992, on a [[placemat]] in a New Jersey diner with [[Rob Pike]]. In the following days, Pike and Thompson implemented it and updated [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]] to use it throughout, and then communicated their success back to X/Open, which accepted it as the specification for FSS-UTF.<ref name=pikeviacambridge/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ FSS-UTF (1992) / UTF-8 (1993)<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n!Number<br>of bytes!!First<br>code point!!Last<br>code point!!Byte 1!!Byte 2!!Byte 3!!Byte 4!!Byte 5!!Byte 6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |1\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+0000\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+007F\n|{{mono|0xxxxxxx}}\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+0080\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+07FF\n|{{mono|110xxxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |3\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+0800\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+FFFF\n|{{mono|1110xxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |4\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+10000\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+1FFFFF\n|{{mono|11110xxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |5\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+200000\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+3FFFFFF\n|{{mono|111110xx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}\n| style=\"background: darkgray;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |6\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+4000000\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" |U+7FFFFFFF\n|{{mono|1111110x}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}||{{mono|10xxxxxx}}\n|}\n\nUTF-8 was first officially presented at the [[USENIX]] conference in [[San Diego]], from January 25 to 29, 1993.

For many scripts there have been more than one single-byte encoding in usage, so even knowing the script was insufficient information to display it correctly.\n* The bytes 0xFE and 0xFF do not appear, so a valid UTF-8 stream never matches the UTF-16 [[byte order mark]] and thus cannot be confused with it. The absence of 0xFF (0377) also eliminates the need to escape this byte in [[Telnet]] (and FTP control connection).\n* UTF-8 encoded text is larger than specialized single-byte encodings except for plain ASCII characters. In the case of scripts which used 8-bit character sets with non-Latin characters encoded in the upper half (such as most [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and [[Greek alphabet]] code pages), characters in UTF-8 will be double the size. For some scripts, such as [[Thai alphabet|Thai]] and [[Devanagari]] (which is used by various South Asian languages), characters will triple in size. There are even examples where a single byte turns into a composite character in Unicode and is thus six times larger in UTF-8. This has caused objections in India and other countries.\n*  It is possible in UTF-8 (or any other variable-length encoding) to split or [[Data truncation|truncate]] a string in the middle of a character. If the two pieces are not re-appended later before interpretation as characters, this can introduce an invalid sequence at both the end of the previous section and the start of the next, and some decoders will not preserve these bytes and result in data loss. Because UTF-8 is self-synchronizing this will however never introduce a different valid character, and it is also fairly easy to move the truncation point backwards to the start of a character.\n* If the code points are all the same size, measurements of a fixed number of them is easy. Due to ASCII-era documentation where \"character\" is used as a synonym for \"byte\" this is often considered important. However, by measuring string positions using bytes instead of \"characters\" most algorithms can be easily and efficiently adapted for UTF-8. Searching for a string within a long string can for example be done byte by byte; the self-synchronization property prevents false positives.\n\n===Comparison with other multi-byte encodings===\n* UTF-8 can encode any [[Unicode]] character. Files in different scripts can be displayed correctly without having to choose the correct code page or font. For instance, Chinese and Arabic can be written in the same file without specialised markup or manual settings that specify an encoding.\n* UTF-8 is [[Self-synchronizing code|self-synchronizing]]: character boundaries are easily identified by scanning for well-defined bit patterns in either direction. If bytes are lost due to error or [[data corruption|corruption]], one can always locate the next valid character and resume processing. If there is a need to shorten a string to fit a specified field, the previous valid character can easily be found. Many multi-byte encodings such as {{nowrap|Shift JIS}} are much harder to resynchronize. This also means that [[byte-oriented protocol|byte-oriented]] [[string-searching algorithm]]s can be used with UTF-8 (as a character is the same as a \"word\" made up of that many bytes), optimized versions of byte searches can be much faster due to hardware support and lookup tables that have only 256 entries.\n* Efficient to encode using simple [[bitwise operation]]s. UTF-8 does not require slower mathematical operations such as multiplication or division (unlike {{nowrap|Shift JIS}}, {{nowrap|[[GB 2312]]}} and other encodings).\n* UTF-8 will take more space than a multi-byte encoding designed for a specific script. East Asian legacy encodings generally used two bytes per character yet take three bytes per character in UTF-8. Self-synchronization also takes more space.\n\n===Comparison with UTF-16===\n{{See also|Comparison of Unicode encodings}}\n\n* Byte encodings and UTF-8 are represented by byte arrays in programs, and often nothing needs to be done to a function when converting from a byte encoding to UTF-8. [[UTF-16]] is represented by 16-bit word arrays, and converting to UTF-16 while maintaining compatibility with existing [[ASCII]]-based programs (such as was done with Windows) requires ''every'' API and data structure that takes a string to be duplicated, one version accepting byte strings and another version accepting UTF-16.\n* Text encoded in UTF-8 will be smaller than the same text encoded in UTF-16 if there are more code points below U+0080 than in the range U+0800..U+FFFF. This is true for all modern European languages.\n** Text in (for example) Chinese, Japanese or Devanagari will take more space in UTF-8 if there are more of these characters than there are ASCII characters. This is likely when data mainly consist of pure prose, but is lessened by the degree to which the context uses ASCII whitespace, digits, and punctuation.<ref group=\"nb\">The 2010-11-22 version of [[:hi:\u092f\u0942\u0928\u093f\u0915\u094b\u0921|\u092f\u0942\u0928\u093f\u0915\u094b\u0921]] (Unicode in Hindi), when the pure text was pasted to Notepad, generated 19&nbsp;KB when saved as UTF-16 and 22&nbsp;KB when saved as UTF-8.</ref>\n** Most of the [[formatted text|rich text formats]] (including HTML) contain a large proportion of ASCII characters for the sake of formatting, thus the size usually will be reduced significantly compared with UTF-16, even when the language mostly uses 3-byte long characters in UTF-8.<ref group=\"nb\">The 2010-10-27 version of [[:ja:UTF-8|UTF-8]] (in Japanese) generated 169&nbsp;KB when converted with Notepad to UTF-16, and only 101&nbsp;KB when converted back to UTF-8.

Any bytes missing from UTF-8 will still allow the text to be recovered accurately starting with the next character after the missing bytes.\n\n==Derivatives==\nThe following implementations show slight differences from the UTF-8 specification.

[[Oracle Database|Oracle]] and [[MySQL]] databases use this, as well as Java and Tcl as described below, and probably many Windows programs where the programmers were unaware of the complexities of UTF-16.

His invention was a large, seated version that consisted of a bonnet that attached to the chimney pipe of a gas stove. Godefroy invented it for use in his [[hair salon]] in France, and it was not portable or handheld. It could only be used by having the person sit underneath it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2016/04/28/fashion/history-hair-dryers/s/28HAIRDRYERS-slide-KVQ5.html|title=A Lot of Hot Air|date=2016-04-27|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-07-05|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Armenian American]] inventor Gabriel Kazanjian was the first to patent a blow dryer in the United States, in 1911.<ref>Kazanjiadl \"Hair-Drier\" {{US Patent|994259}}, assigned on 6 June 1911</ref>\n\nAround 1920, hair dryers began to go on the market in handheld form. This was due to innovations by National Stamping and Electricworks under the white cross brand,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zIYLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=91MDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5997,3157234|title=The Evening Independent - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2018-05-23}}</ref> and later U.S. Racine Universal Motor Company and the Hamilton Beach Co., which allowed the dryer to be small enough to be held by hand. Even in the 1920s, the new dryers were often heavy, weighing in at approximately {{convert|2|lb|1}}, and were difficult to use. They also had many instances of [[thermal shock|overheating]] and [[electrocution]]. Hair dryers were only capable of using 100&nbsp;watts, which increased the amount of time needed to dry hair (the average dryer today can use up to 2000&nbsp;watts of heat).<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.madehow.com/Volume-7/Hair-Dryer.html|title = Hair Dryer|accessdate = 2015-10-26|website = MadeHow.com}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1920s, development of the hair dryer has mainly focused on improving the wattage and superficial exterior and material changes. In fact, the mechanism of the dryer has not had any significant changes since its inception. One of the more important changes for the hair dryer is to be made of plastic, so that it is more lightweight. This really caught on in the 1960s with the introduction of better electrical motors and the improvement of plastics. Another important change happened in 1954 when [[Green Electronics Council|GEC]] changed the design of the dryer to move the motor inside the casing.<ref name=\"homepage.ntlworld.com\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20071004071952/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/paul.linnell/sso/hairdryers.html Electric Hair Dryers]. ntlworld.com</ref>\n\n[[File:Excelsior hair dryer 1962.jpg|thumb|Bonnet hair dryer, 1962]]\nThe bonnet dryer was introduced to consumers in 1951. This type worked by having the dryer, usually in a small portable box, connected to a tube that went into a bonnet with holes in it that could be placed on top of a person's head. This worked by giving an even amount of heat to the whole head at once.\n\nThe 1950s also saw the introduction of the rigid-hood hair dryer which is the type most frequently seen in salons. It had a hard plastic helmet that wraps around the person's head. This dryer works similarly to the bonnet dryer of the 1950s but at a much higher wattage.<ref name=\"homepage.ntlworld.com\" />\n\n[[File:Bonnet-hood hair dryer, 1965.jpg|thumb|Bonnet hair dryer, 1965]]\n[[File:Bonnet_hair_dryer,_circa_early_1970s.jpg|thumb|right|Bonnet hair dryer, circa early 1970s]]\nIn the 1970s, the U.S. [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] set up guidelines that hair dryers had to meet to be considered safe to manufacture.

Hood dryers are mainly found in hair salons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-hair-hood-dryer.htm//|title=What is a hair hood dryer?|publisher=WiseGeek|accessdate=2012-05-24}}</ref>\n\n== Hair dryer brush ==\nA hair dryer brush (also called \"hot air brush\" and \"round brush hair dryer\" and \"hair styler\"<ref>https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/official-charcoal-infused-hair-styler-175723337.html</ref>) has the shape of a brush and it is used as a volumizer too.<ref>https://www.insider.com/revlon-one-step-hair-dryer-review</ref>\n\nThere are two types of round brush hair dryers \u2013 rotating and static. Rotating round brush hair dryers have barrels that rotate automatically while static round brush hair dryers don\u2019t.<ref>https://www.hairworldmag.com-best-round-brush-hair-dryers-</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AEG Foen Nr72355 03 mod03 res.jpg|thumb|150px|Dryer made by [[AEG]], c. 1920\u20131925]]\nIn 1890 the first hairdryer was invented by French stylist [[Alexander Godefroy]]. His invention was a large, seated version that consisted of a bonnet that attached to the chimney pipe of a gas stove. Godefroy invented it for use in his [[hair salon]] in France, and it was not portable or handheld. It could only be used by having the person sit underneath it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2016/04/28/fashion/history-hair-dryers/s/28HAIRDRYERS-slide-KVQ5.html|title=A Lot of Hot Air|date=2016-04-27|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-07-05|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Armenian American]] inventor Gabriel Kazanjian was the first to patent a blow dryer in the United States, in 1911.<ref>Kazanjiadl \"Hair-Drier\" {{US Patent|994259}}, assigned on 6 June 1911</ref>\n\nAround 1920, hair dryers began to go on the market in handheld form. This was due to innovations by National Stamping and Electricworks under the white cross brand,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zIYLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=91MDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5997,3157234|title=The Evening Independent - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2018-05-23}}</ref> and later U.S. Racine Universal Motor Company and the Hamilton Beach Co., which allowed the dryer to be small enough to be held by hand. Even in the 1920s, the new dryers were often heavy, weighing in at approximately {{convert|2|lb|1}}, and were difficult to use. They also had many instances of [[thermal shock|overheating]] and [[electrocution]]. Hair dryers were only capable of using 100&nbsp;watts, which increased the amount of time needed to dry hair (the average dryer today can use up to 2000&nbsp;watts of heat).<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.madehow.com/Volume-7/Hair-Dryer.html|title = Hair Dryer|accessdate = 2015-10-26|website = MadeHow.com}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1920s, development of the hair dryer has mainly focused on improving the wattage and superficial exterior and material changes. In fact, the mechanism of the dryer has not had any significant changes since its inception. One of the more important changes for the hair dryer is to be made of plastic, so that it is more lightweight. This really caught on in the 1960s with the introduction of better electrical motors and the improvement of plastics. Another important change happened in 1954 when [[Green Electronics Council|GEC]] changed the design of the dryer to move the motor inside the casing.<ref name=\"homepage.ntlworld.com\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20071004071952/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/paul.linnell/sso/hairdryers.html Electric Hair Dryers]. ntlworld.com</ref>\n\n[[File:Excelsior hair dryer 1962.jpg|thumb|Bonnet hair dryer, 1962]]\nThe bonnet dryer was introduced to consumers in 1951. This type worked by having the dryer, usually in a small portable box, connected to a tube that went into a bonnet with holes in it that could be placed on top of a person's head. This worked by giving an even amount of heat to the whole head at once.\n\nThe 1950s also saw the introduction of the rigid-hood hair dryer which is the type most frequently seen in salons. It had a hard plastic helmet that wraps around the person's head. This dryer works similarly to the bonnet dryer of the 1950s but at a much higher wattage.<ref name=\"homepage.ntlworld.com\" />\n\n[[File:Bonnet-hood hair dryer, 1965.jpg|thumb|Bonnet hair dryer, 1965]]\n[[File:Bonnet_hair_dryer,_circa_early_1970s.jpg|thumb|right|Bonnet hair dryer, circa early 1970s]]\nIn the 1970s, the U.S. [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] set up guidelines that hair dryers had to meet to be considered safe to manufacture. Since 1991 the CPSC has mandated that all dryers must use a [[ground fault circuit interrupter]] so that it cannot electrocute a person if it gets wet.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://home.howstuffworks.com/hair-dryer.htm|title = How Hair Dryers Work|date = 2000-12-15|accessdate = 2015-10-26|website = HowStuffWorks.com|last = Toothman|first = Jessika|last2 = Meeker-O'Connell|first2 = Ann}}</ref> By 2000, deaths by blowdryers had dropped to fewer than four people a year, a stark difference to the hundreds of cases of electrocution accidents during the mid-20th century.\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe British [[historical drama]] television series [[Downton Abbey]] made note of the invention of the portable hairdryer (blow dryer) when a character purchased one in Season 6 Episode 9, set in the year 1925.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Curling iron]]\n*[[Heat gun]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons category inline|Hairdryers}}\n{{Home appliances}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hairdressing]]\n[[Category:Home appliances]]\n[[Category:Products introduced in 1920]]\n[[Category:19th-century inventions]]\n[[Category:French inventions]]\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n", "name_user": "Avram25", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHair dryer brush", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_dryer"}

[[Francis Schmidt]] coached the Razorbacks from the 1923-24 season until the 1928-29 season, while also coaching the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|football]] and [[Arkansas Razorbacks baseball|baseball]] teams.\n\nSchmidt oversaw the construction of the gymnasium that was home to the Razorbacks from the inaugural season through the 1936-37 season. The project was headed by Schmidt and Jay Fulbright (father of future United States Senator from Arkansas, [[J. William Fulbright]]). Schmidt and Fulbright organized a group of businessmen that facilitated the transfer of a former car showroom to the university to serve as the gym for the Razorbacks. The wooden gym, made out of surplus [[World War I]] material and officially named Schmidt Gymnasium, became known as \"Schmidt's barn,\" in reference to its makeshift nature and lack of accomdations.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stuck |first1=Dorothy D. |title=Roberta: a Most Remarkable Fulbright |date=1997 |publisher=University of Arkansas Press |location=Fayetteville, AR |isbn=1610753518 |page=38 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_LQM1p8F1QcC&pg=PA38&dq=arkansas+schmidt+gymnasium+-gymnastics&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjg27rJv5DoAhUKVN8KHcfYDzgQ6AEwAXoECAIQAg#v=onepage&q=arkansas%20schmidt%20gymnasium%20-gymnastics&f=false |accessdate=10 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Hancock |first1=Hank |title=A history of Arkansas Razorbacks |date=1976 |publisher=H.

Building off the program's first season, the 1924-25 team finished third in the conference, quickly turning their record around to 9-3 in conference play. This second season laid the groundwork for tremendous success with Schmidt, as the Razorbacks won the conference championship outright in just the third year of the program's existence with a record of 23-2 (11-1).

Richardson's firing sent shockwaves through the Arkansas sports community, as he was the only coach to lead the Arkansas Razorback Men's basketball team to the NCAA National Championship, a pinnacle the team still hasn't reached since his time as head coach. The Razorbacks finished first in the [[Southwest Conference]] three times under Richardson. Arkansas joined the [[Southeastern Conference]] for the 1991-92 season and won the regular season conference championship in 1992 and 1994, also winning the SEC Western Division title in 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995. The Razorbacks also won the [[2000 SEC Men's Basketball Tournament|2000 SEC Tournament]]. Arkansas made the NCAA Tournament thirteen times during Richardson's seventeen seasons, and made the Final Four during the 1990, 1994 and 1995 season. They won their first [[1994 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|National Championship]] in 1994. The next season, they returned to the [[1995 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|Championship game]] and finished as runner-up, losing to [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]]. Richardson was fired in 2002 after making controversial public statements against the university and then-athletic director [[Frank Broyles]]. Assistant coach [[Mike Anderson (basketball)|Mike Anderson]] coached the rest of the season, going 1-1. Richardson holds the school record for most wins by a head coach, with an overall record of 389-169 (.697). Between the 1989-90 season and 1995-96 season, Arkansas won more games than any other school in the nation.\n\n===Stan Heath years (2002-07)===\n[[Stan Heath]] coached the Hogs beginning with the 2002-03 season and remained in Fayetteville through the 2006-07 season. During Heath's five seasons, the Razorbacks did not enjoy the success that they achieved under Richardson. They never finished higher than third place in the Western Division of the Southeastern Conference. They were invited to the NCAA Tournament in Heath's final two seasons, although they were eliminated in the Round of 64 each trip.

The Razorbacks had an SEC regular season record of 9-7. In Pelphrey's second year, the Razorbacks struggled in conference play after starting the season 12-1 in non-conference games with two notable wins over the nationally ranked [[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|Oklahoma Sooners]] (#4) and the [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas Longhorns]] (#7). Conference wins were few and far between giving the Razorbacks a final conference record of 2-14.

The Razorbacks made another tournament two years later but lost to top-seeded [[2016-17 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]], the eventual national champion, in the second round. The following year saw them make the tournament for the final time in Anderson's tenure at Arkansas, but a loss to Butler ended the Hogs' season in the [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|first round]]. Following an up-and-down 2018-19 campaign that culminated in an [[2019 National Invitation Tournament|NIT berth]], new athletic director Hunter Yurachek relieved Anderson of his duties on March 26 a little over a week after Arkansas lost to Indiana in the second round of the NIT.\n\n===Eric Musselman (2019\u2013present)===\n\nOn April 7, 2019, Yurachek announced the hiring of [[Eric Musselman]], who had previously served as the head coach of Nevada for four seasons, after multiple NBA head coaching jobs, as well as assistant coaching stops at Arizona State and LSU.<ref>https://arkansasrazorbacks.com/musselman-named-head-mens-basketball-coach/</ref> Musselman's first Razorbacks team finished the season with a record of 20-12, which is impressive considering there were no players on the team taller than 6'8\".

The Razorbacks have made six NCAA [[Final Four]] appearances ([[1941 NCAA Basketball Tournament|1941]], [[1945 NCAA Basketball Tournament|1945]], [[1978 NCAA Division I Basketball Tournament|1978]], [[1990 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1990]], [[1994 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1994]], and [[1995 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1995]]).\n\n==History==\n\n===Early success under Schmidt (1923-29)===\nArkansas had a relatively late start in basketball; it did not field its first team until 1923. [[Francis Schmidt]] coached the Razorbacks from the 1923-24 season until the 1928-29 season, while also coaching the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|football]] and [[Arkansas Razorbacks baseball|baseball]] teams. \n\nSchmidt oversaw the construction of the gymnasium that was home to the Razorbacks from the inaugural season through the 1936-37 season. The project was headed by Schmidt and Jay Fulbright (father of future United States Senator from Arkansas, [[J. William Fulbright]]). Schmidt and Fulbright organized a group of businessmen that facilitated the transfer of a former car showroom to the university to serve as the gym for the Razorbacks. The wooden gym, made out of surplus [[World War I]] material and officially named Schmidt Gymnasium, became known as \"Schmidt's barn,\" in reference to its makeshift nature and lack of accomdations.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stuck |first1=Dorothy D. |title=Roberta: a Most Remarkable Fulbright |date=1997 |publisher=University of Arkansas Press |location=Fayetteville, AR |isbn=1610753518 |page=38 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_LQM1p8F1QcC&pg=PA38&dq=arkansas+schmidt+gymnasium+-gymnastics&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjg27rJv5DoAhUKVN8KHcfYDzgQ6AEwAXoECAIQAg#v=onepage&q=arkansas%20schmidt%20gymnasium%20-gymnastics&f=false |accessdate=10 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Hancock |first1=Hank |title=A history of Arkansas Razorbacks |date=1976 |publisher=H.

Building off the program's first season, the 1924-25 team finished third in the conference, quickly turning their record around to 9-3 in conference play. This second season laid the groundwork for tremendous success with Schmidt, as the Razorbacks won the conference championship outright in just the third year of the program's existence with a record of 23-2 (11-1).

Richardson's firing sent shockwaves through the Arkansas sports community, as he was the only coach to lead the Arkansas Razorback Men's basketball team to the NCAA National Championship, a pinnacle the team still hasn't reached since his time as head coach. The Razorbacks finished first in the [[Southwest Conference]] three times under Richardson. Arkansas joined the [[Southeastern Conference]] for the 1991-92 season and won the regular season conference championship in 1992 and 1994, also winning the SEC Western Division title in 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995. The Razorbacks also won the [[2000 SEC Men's Basketball Tournament|2000 SEC Tournament]]. Arkansas made the NCAA Tournament thirteen times during Richardson's seventeen seasons, and made the Final Four during the 1990, 1994 and 1995 season. They won their first [[1994 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|National Championship]] in 1994. The next season, they returned to the [[1995 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|Championship game]] and finished as runner-up, losing to [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]]. Richardson was fired in 2002 after making controversial public statements against the university and then-athletic director [[Frank Broyles]]. Assistant coach [[Mike Anderson (basketball)|Mike Anderson]] coached the rest of the season, going 1-1. Richardson holds the school record for most wins by a head coach, with an overall record of 389-169 (.697). Between the 1989-90 season and 1995-96 season, Arkansas won more games than any other school in the nation.\n\n===Stan Heath years (2002-07)===\n[[Stan Heath]] coached the Hogs beginning with the 2002-03 season and remained in Fayetteville through the 2006-07 season. During Heath's five seasons, the Razorbacks did not enjoy the success that they achieved under Richardson. They never finished higher than third place in the Western Division of the Southeastern Conference. They were invited to the NCAA Tournament in Heath's final two seasons, although they were eliminated in the Round of 64 each trip. Heath's final record was 82-71 (.536).\n\n===Dana Altman (2007)===\n[[Dana Altman]] was hired as the head coach of the Arkansas Razorbacks on April 2, 2007.

The Razorbacks had an SEC regular season record of 9-7. In Pelphrey's second year, the Razorbacks struggled in conference play after starting the season 12-1 in non-conference games with two notable wins over the nationally ranked [[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|Oklahoma Sooners]] (#4) and the [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas Longhorns]] (#7). Conference wins were few and far between giving the Razorbacks a final conference record of 2-14. On March 13, 2011 John Pelphrey was dismissed as the head coach of the Razorbacks after an 18-13 season in which the Hogs missed postseason play for the third consecutive season, despite an impressive incoming recruiting class.

Anderson made three NCAA tournaments in his eight seasons, including a 27-win season in 2014-15 that resulted in a 5 seed in the [[2015 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|tournament]], the program's highest since 1999. The Razorbacks made another tournament two years later but lost to top-seeded [[2016-17 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]], the eventual national champion, in the second round. The following year saw them make the tournament for the final time in Anderson's tenure at Arkansas, but a loss to Butler ended the Hogs' season in the [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|first round]]. Following an up-and-down 2018-19 campaign that culminated in an [[2019 National Invitation Tournament|NIT berth]], new athletic director Hunter Yurachek relieved Anderson of his duties on March 26 a little over a week after Arkansas lost to Indiana in the second round of the NIT.\n\n===Eric Musselman (2019\u2013present)===\n\nOn April 7, 2019, Yurachek announced the hiring of [[Eric Musselman]], who had previously served as the head coach of Nevada for four seasons, after multiple NBA head coaching jobs, as well as assistant coaching stops at Arizona State and LSU. <ref>https://arkansasrazorbacks.com/musselman-named-head-mens-basketball-coach/</ref> Musselman's first Razorbacks team finished the season with a record of 20-12, which is impressive considering there were no players on the team taller than 6'8\".
