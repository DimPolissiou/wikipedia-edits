The Atlas V (AV-029) used a Russian-built [[RD-180]] main engine, powered by [[kerosene]] and [[liquid oxygen]]. At ignition it underwent checkout 3.8&nbsp;seconds prior to the ignition of five strap-on [[solid rocket booster]]s (SRBs). Following the SRB burnout, about 93 seconds into the flight, two of the spent boosters fell away from the vehicle, followed 1.5&nbsp;seconds later by the remaining three. When heating levels had dropped below predetermined limits, the [[payload fairing]] that protected ''Juno'' during launch and transit through the thickest part of the atmosphere separated, about 3&nbsp;minutes 24&nbsp;seconds into the flight. The Atlas&nbsp;V main engine cut off 4&nbsp;minutes 26&nbsp;seconds after liftoff. Sixteen seconds later, the [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur second stage]] ignited, and it burned for about 6&nbsp;minutes, putting the satellite into an initial [[parking orbit]].<ref name=spaceflightnow>{{cite news |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/atlas/av029/ascenttimeline.html |title=Atlas/Juno launch timeline |work=Spaceflight Now |date=July 28, 2011}}</ref> The vehicle coasted for about 30 minutes, and then the Centaur was reignited for a second firing of 9&nbsp;minutes, placing the spacecraft on an Earth escape trajectory in a [[heliocentric orbit]].\n\nPrior to separation, the Centaur stage used onboard [[reaction engine]]s to spin ''Juno'' up to 1.4&nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|r.p.m.]].

The Atlas V (AV-029) used a Russian-built [[RD-180]] main engine, powered by [[kerosene]] and [[liquid oxygen]]. At ignition it underwent checkout 3.8&nbsp;seconds prior to the ignition of five strap-on [[solid rocket booster]]s (SRBs). Following the SRB burnout, about 93 seconds into the flight, two of the spent boosters fell away from the vehicle, followed 1.5&nbsp;seconds later by the remaining three. When heating levels had dropped below predetermined limits, the [[payload fairing]] that protected ''Juno'' during launch and transit through the thickest part of the atmosphere separated, about 3&nbsp;minutes 24&nbsp;seconds into the flight. The Atlas&nbsp;V main engine cut off 4&nbsp;minutes 26&nbsp;seconds after liftoff. Sixteen seconds later, the [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur second stage]] ignited, and it burned for about 6&nbsp;minutes, putting the satellite into an initial [[parking orbit]].<ref name=spaceflightnow>{{cite news |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/atlas/av029/ascenttimeline.html |title=Atlas/Juno launch timeline |work=Spaceflight Now |date=July 28, 2011}}</ref> The vehicle coasted for about 30 minutes, and then the Centaur was reignited for a second firing of 9&nbsp;minutes, placing the spacecraft on an Earth escape trajectory in a [[heliocentric orbit]].\n\nPrior to separation, the Centaur stage used onboard [[reaction engine]]s to spin ''Juno'' up to 1.4&nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|r.p.m.]]. About 54&nbsp;minutes after launch, the spacecraft separated from the Centaur and began to extend its [[solar panel]]s.<ref name=spaceflightnow/> Following the full deployment and locking of the solar panels, ''Juno''{{'s}} batteries began to recharge.

Fenty ran on a platform of bringing a more energetic and hands-on approach to city government,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}, advancing bold ideas for change, and sticking to them.<ref name=\"cropp and fenty\"/> Fenty said he would take his uncompromising style to the mayor's office, and cited with approval, Margaret Thatcher's saying that, \"Consensus is the absence of leadership\".<ref name=\"cropp and fenty\"/> Cropp stressed her 25 years of experience in city government and her desire to continue the progress made by Anthony Williams, who endorsed her candidacy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} She also stressed her ability to cooperate with diverse groups and reach consensus.

The former had fought the British colonial government prior to independence; however, during the final days of the [[Japanese occupation of Burma]] in [[World War II]], both groups helped the British against the [[Imperial Japanese Army]].<ref name=\"Leeds\"/> Initially there was calm during the transitional period after independence, but on 2 April 1948, the CPB fired the first shots of the conflict in Paukkongyi, Pegu Region (present-day [[Bago Region]]).<ref name=\"Lintner1990\"/>\n\nDuring the post-independence period, the KNU favoured an [[independent state]], administered by the Karen people. The proposed state would have encompassed the territories of Karen State and Karenni State (present-day [[Kayin State]] and [[Kayah State]]), in [[Lower Burma]] (Outer Myanmar).

The former had fought the British colonial government prior to independence; however, during the final days of the [[Japanese occupation of Burma]] in [[World War II]], both groups helped the British against the [[Imperial Japanese Army]].<ref name=\"Leeds\"/> Initially there was calm during the transitional period after independence, but on 2 April 1948, the CPB fired the first shots of the conflict in Paukkongyi, Pegu Region (present-day [[Bago Region]]).<ref name=\"Lintner1990\"/>\n\nDuring the post-independence period, the KNU favoured an [[independent state]], administered by the Karen people. The proposed state would have encompassed the territories of Karen State and Karenni State (present-day [[Kayin State]] and [[Kayah State]]), in [[Lower Burma]] (Outer Myanmar). The KNU has since shifted their focus from full independence to [[regional autonomy]], under a [[Federalism|federal system]] with fair Karen representation in the government.<ref name=\"KNUabout\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.knuhq.org/about/|title=About {{!}} Official Karen National Union Webpage|access-date=21 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121204309/http://www.knuhq.org/about/|archive-date=21 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Post-coup conflict (1962\u20131988) ===\n[[File:They go back.jpg|thumb|\"''They Go Back''\": Insurgents of the [[Communist Party of Burma]] walk back to their bases after failed peace talks.

Accusations of severe human rights abuses and violations followed afterwards, and the cabinet of the parliamentary government and political leaders of ethnic minority groups were arrested and detained without trial.<ref name=\"Pavkovi\u0107, 2011: 476\"/> Around this period, other ethnic minority groups began forming larger rebel factions, such as the [[Kachin Independence Army]], in response to the new government's refusal to adopt a [[federalism|federal government]] structure.\n\nIn 1967, following [[China]]'s initiation of the [[Cultural Revolution]], violence broke out between local [[Bamar people|Bamars]] and overseas Chinese in Myanmar, leading to [[The 1967 anti-Chinese riots in Burma|anti-Chinese riots]] in Rangoon (present-day [[Yangon]]) and other cities.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fan|first1=Hongwei|title=The 1967 anti-Chinese riots in Burma and Sino-Burmese relations|journal=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|volume=43(2)|issue=June 2012}}</ref> The riots left many overseas Chinese dead, which allegedly prompted China to begin giving logistical aid to the [[Communist Party of Burma]] (CPB) in 1968.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fan|first1=Hong Wei|title=The 1967 Anti-Chinese Riots in Burma and Sino-Burmese Relations|issue=2|pages=234\u2013256|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-290856826/the-1967-anti-chinese-riots-in-burma-and-sino-burmese|journal=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|volume=43|language=en|date=1 June 2012|doi=10.1017/S0022463412000045}}</ref>\n\nBoth immediately after the coup and again in 1972, General Ne Win held peace talks with opposition forces, but both times they fell apart, partly due to General Ne Win's refusal to adopt a [[multi-party system]].
