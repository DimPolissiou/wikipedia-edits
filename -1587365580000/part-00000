However, some employees' unions conducted their negotiations within mutually agreed limits above this limit with employers.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/28/newsid_2531000/2531007.stm  On This Day: 1979: Early election as Callaghan defeated], [[BBC]]. Retrieved 17 December 2007.</ref> While the strikes were largely over by February 1979, the government's inability to contain the strikes earlier helped lead to [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] victory in the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] and legislation to restrict unions. Public sector employee strike actions included an unofficial strike by [[gravedigger]]s working in [[Liverpool]] and [[Tameside]], and strikes by refuse collectors.

Crosland had argued in his book ''[[The Future of Socialism]]'' that the government exerted enough control over private industry that it was not necessary to [[nationalisation|nationalise]] it as [[Clause IV|the party had long called to do]], and that the ultimate goals of [[socialism]] could be as readily achieved by assuring long-term economic stability and building out the social [[welfare state]]. His \"[[The Future of Socialism#Labour revisionism|revisionist]]\" views became Labour's perspective on the [[post-war consensus]], in which both they and the [[Conservative Party (United Kingdom)|Conservative Party]] agreed in principle on a strong government role in the economy, strong unions and a welfare state as foundational to Britain's prosperity.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\">{{cite book |last=L\u00f3pez |first=Tara Martin |title=The Winter of Discontent: Myth, Memory and History |date=2014 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9781781386019 |pages=40\u201345}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, following the surge in radical left-wing politics of the late 1960s, that view was challenged in another Labour figure's book, [[Stuart Holland]]'s ''The Socialist Challenge''. He argued that contrary to Crosland's assertions, the government could exercise little control over Britain's largest companies, which were likely to continue consolidating into an [[oligopoly]] that, by the 1980s, could raise prices high enough that governments following [[Keynesian economics]] would be unable to ensure their citizens the opportunity for [[full employment]] that they had been able to since the war, and exploit [[transfer pricing]] to avoid paying British taxes. Holland called for  returning to nationalisation, arguing that taking control of the top 25 companies that way would result in a market with more competition and less inflation.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\nHolland's ideas formed the basis of the [[Alternative Economic Strategy]] (AES) promoted by [[Tony Benn]], then [[Secretary of State for Industry]] in the Labour governments of [[Harold Wilson]] and [[James Callaghan]] as they considered responses to [[Pound sterling#1976 sterling crisis|the sterling crisis]] in 1976. The AES called on Britain to adopt a [[protectionism|protectionist]] stance in international trade, including reversing [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|its recent decision to join the European Common Market]], and impose no incomes policy to combat inflation. Benn believed that this approach was more in keeping with Labour's traditional policies and would have its strongest supporters in the unions and outside of them vigorously supporting the government against opposition from the financial sector and commanding heights of industry. It was ultimately rejected in favor of the [[Social Contract (Britain)|Social Contract]] and extensive cuts in public spending as the condition of an [[International Monetary Fund]] loan that supported the pound.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\nThe left wing of the Labour Party, while critical of the revisionist approach and the Social Contract, was not universally supportive of the AES either. Many thought it did not go far enough, or avoided the issue of nationalisation. [[Feminism in the United Kingdom|Feminists]] in particular criticised it for its focus on traditionally male-dominated manufacturing jobs and ignoring the broader issues that the increasing amount of women in the workforce faced, preferring a focus on broader social issues rather than just working conditions and pay, the traditional areas unions had negotiated with employers.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\n===1960s\u201370s labour law reforms===\n\nIn 1968 Wilson's government appointed the [[Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers' Associations|Donovan Commission]] to review [[United Kingdom labour law|British labour law]] with an eye toward reducing the days lost to strikes every year; many Britons had come to believe the unions were too powerful despite the country's economic growth since the war. It found much of the problem to lie in a parallel system of 'official' signed agreements between unions and employers, and [[Side letter|'unofficial', often unwritten ones]] at the local level, between [[shop steward]]s and managers, which often took precedence in practice over the official ones. The government responded with ''[[In Place of Strife]]'' a [[white paper]] by [[Secretary of State for Employment]] [[Barbara Castle]], which recommended restrictions on unions' ability to strike, such as requiring strikes take place after a member vote and fining unions for unofficial strikes.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 36\">L\u00f3pez, 36</ref>\n\nThe [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC) vigorously opposed making Castle's recommendations law, and Callaghan, then [[Home Secretary]], led a cabinet revolt which led to its abandonment. Callaghan did not believe it would be effective in curtailing unofficial strikes, that the proposals could not pass, and the effort would create unnecessary tension between the government and the unions that were key to its political strength.<ref name=\"Lopez 37\">{{cite book|last=Callaghan|first=James|authorlink=James Callaghan|title=Time and Chance|page=274|date=1987|publisher=Collins|isbn=9780002165150}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, 37</ref>\n\nAfter the Conservatives won [[1970 United Kingdom general election|the following year's election]], they implemented their own legislation to address the issue. The [[Industrial Relations Act 1971]], modeled in part on the U.S. [[Taft-Hartley Act]], passed over determined union opposition, included many of the same provisions as ''In Place of Strife'', and explicitly stated that formal [[collective bargaining agreement]]s would have the force of law unless they had [[disclaimer]]s to the contrary. It also created a [[National Industrial Relations Court]] to handle disputes and put unions under a central registry to enforce their rules.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 38\">L\u00f3pez, 38</ref>\n\nNew Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] hoped that the new law would not only address the strike issue but the steep [[inflation]] plaguing the British economy (along with other industrial capitalist economies) at the time, eliminating the need for a separate [[incomes policy]] by having a moderating effect on pay increases demanded by unions. Ongoing union resistance to the Industrial Relations Act led to a [[House of Lords]] ruling in their favor over demonstrations and widespread unofficial strikes following the [[Pentonville Five]]'s imprisonment for continuing to picket a London container depot in violation of a court order, which undermined the legislation. Coal miners [[UK miners' strike (1972)|officially went on strike]] for the first time in almost half a century in 1972; after two months the strike was settled with the miners getting a 21 per cent increase, less than half of what they had originally sought.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 39\">L\u00f3pez, 39</ref>\n\nHeath as a result turned to an incomes policy; inflation continued to worsen. Its implementation was abandoned in 1973 when [[1973 oil shock|that year's oil embargo]] nearly doubled prices within months. To meet demand for heat in the wintertime, the government had to return to coal, giving the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] more leverage. The government declared a [[state of emergency]] that November, and at the beginning of 1974 limited all nonessential businesses to [[Three-Day Week|three days of electricity each week]] to conserve power. Miners, who had seen their rise from two years before turn into a pay cut in real terms due to the inflation the government had not brought under control, voted overwhelmingly to go on strike in late January.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 39\" />\n\nTwo weeks later, the government responded by calling [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|an election]], running on the slogan \"Who Governs Britain?\". At the end of the month the Conservatives no longer did; Labour and Wilson returned, but [[hung parliament|without a majority]]. They were able to pass the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]], which repealed the Heath government's Industrial Relations Act.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 39\" /> \n\nIn [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October]] they won a majority of three seats; still they needed a coalition with the [[Liberal Party (United Kingdom)|Liberal Party]] to have a majority on many issues. Callaghan, now [[Foreign Secretary]], warned his fellow Cabinet members at the time of the possibility of \"a breakdown of democracy\", telling them that \"If I were a young man, I would emigrate.\"<ref name=\"beckett2010\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-NURERF4hb8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA175#v=onepage&f=false | title=When the Lights Went Out: Britain in the Seventies | publisher=Faber & Faber | author=Beckett, Andy | year=2010 | pages=175 | isbn=978-0-571-22137-0}}</ref>\n\n===Incomes policy===\n\nWilson, and Callaghan, who succeeded him as Prime Minister after Wilson resigned for health reasons in 1976, continued to fight inflation, which peaked at 26.9 per cent in the 12 months to August 1975. While demonstrating to markets [[fiscal responsibility]] the government wished to avoid large increases in unemployment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Colin Hay |title=Chronicles of a Death Foretold: the Winter of Discontent and Construction of the Crisis of British Keynesianism |journal=Parliamentary Affairs |year=2010 |volume=63 |pages=446\u201370 |doi=10.1093/pa/gsp056 |issue=3}}</ref> As part of the campaign to bring down inflation, the government had agreed a \"[[Social Contract (Britain)|Social Contract]]\" with the TUC which allowed for a voluntary [[incomes policy]] in which the pay rises for workers were held down to limits set by the government. Previous governments had brought in incomes policies backed by [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]], but the social contract agreed that this would not happen.<ref name=bbc/>\n\n====Phases I and II====\nPhase I of the pay policy was announced on 11 July 1975 with a [[white paper]] entitled ''The Attack on Inflation''. This proposed a limit on wage rises of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]6 per week for all earning below \u00a38,500 annually.  The [[TUC General Council]] had accepted these proposals by 19 votes to 13. On 5 May 1976 the TUC accepted a new policy for 1976 increases, beginning 1 August, of between \u00a32.50 and \u00a34 per week with further years outlined.  At the Annual Congress on 8 September 1976 the TUC rejected a motion which called for a return to free [[collective bargaining]] (which meant no incomes policy at all) once Phase I expired on 1 August 1977. This new policy was Phase II of the incomes policy.<ref name=hay> Hay, \"The winter of discontent thirty years on.\"</ref>\n\n====Phase III====\nOn 15 July 1977, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]] announced Phase III of the incomes policy in which there was to be a phased return to free collective bargaining, without \"a free-for-all\".  After prolonged negotiations, the TUC agreed to continue with the modest increases recommended for 1977\u201378 under Phase II limits and not to try to reopen pay agreements made under the previous policy, while the Government agreed not to intervene in pay negotiations. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] criticised the power of the unions and lack of any stronger policy to cover the period from the summer of 1978. The inflation rate continued to fall through 1977 and by 1978 the annual rate fell below 10 per cent.<ref name=hay/>\n\nAt the end of the year [[Bernard Donoughue, Baron Donoughue|Bernard Donoughue]], Callaghan's chief policy advisor, sent him a memo analysing possible election dates. He concluded that the following October or November would be the best option, as the economy was likely to remain in good shape through then. After that, he wrote, the outlook was unclear, with pressure from the government's own incomes policy likely.<ref name=\"The Heat of the Kitchen\">{{cite book|last=Donoughue|first=Bernard|authorlink=Bernard Donoughue, Baron Donoughue|title=The Heat of the Kitchen: An Autobiography|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/yE4KAQAAMAAJ?hl=en|page=298|date=2003|isbn=9781842750513}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA61 56\u201357]</ref>\n\n====Five per cent limit====\nAt a May 1978 Downing Street lunch with editors and reporters from the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', Callaghan asked if they believed it was possible that the planned Phase IV would succeed, as he believed it would if the unions and their members understood it was the best way to keep Labour in power. Most told him that it would be difficult, but not impossible. [[Geoffrey Goodman]] disagreed, saying in his view it would be impossible for the union leaders to keep their membership from demanding higher pay increases. \"If that is the case, then I will go over the heads of the trade union leadership and appeal directly to their members\u2014and the voters\", the prime minister responded. \"We have to hold the line on pay or else the government will fall.\"<ref name=\"Goodman 220\u201321\">{{cite book |last1=Goodman |first1=Geoffrey |authorlink1=Geoffrey Goodman |title=From Bevan to Blair: Fifty Years Reporting from the Political Frontline |date=2003 |publisher=Pluto Press |isbn=9780745321783 |pages=220\u201321 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VqlZAAAAMAAJ}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA60 60\u201361]</ref>\n\nHaving prepared for the imminent end of the [[incomes policy]], global inflation supervened and was coming towards [[Interest rate#Historical interest rates|record levels during the 1978\u201382 period]].{{refn|And therefore a second trigger for a rise in [[inflation]]|group= n}} On 21 July 1978 [[Denis Healey]] introduced a new White Paper which set a guideline for pay rises of 5 per cent in the year from 1 August. Callaghan was determined to keep inflation down to single figures, however trade union leaders warned the government that the 5 per cent limit was unachievable, and urged a more flexible approach with a range of settlements between 5 and 8 per cent. [[Terry Duffy]] president of the AUEW described the limit as 'political suicide'. Denis Healey also privately expressed scepticism about the achievability of the limit. The TUC voted overwhelmingly on 26 July to reject the limit and insist on a return to [[collective bargaining|free collective bargaining]] as they were promised.<ref name=\"Conroy\">{{cite book |last1=Conroy |first1=Harry |title=Callaghan |date=2006 |publisher=Haus Publishing |isbn=1-904950-70-1 |pages=109-124}}</ref><ref name=hay/> \n\nIt had been widely expected that Callaghan would call a general election in the autumn of 1978, and that the 5 per cent limit would be revised if Labour won. At a private dinner before that year's TUC conference, Callaghan discussed election strategy with the leaders of major unions. He asked whether he should call an autumn election; with the exception of Scanlon they all urged him to call for one no later than November. Any later, they said, and they could not guarantee their memberships would remain on the job and off the picket line through the winter.<ref name=\"Goodman 226\u201327\">Goodman, 226\u201327, cited at L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA60 60\u201361]</ref>\n\nUnexpectedly however on 7 September, Callaghan announced that he would not be calling a general election that autumn but seeking to go through the winter with continued pay restraint so that the economy would be in a better state in preparation for a spring election, therefore the 5 per cent limit stood. The pay limit was officially termed \"Phase IV\" but most referred to it as \"the 5 per cent limit\". Although the government did not make the 5 per cent limit a legal requirement, it decided to impose penalties on private and public government contractors who broke the limit.<ref name=hay/><ref name=\"Davies\">{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=A.J. |title=To Build a New Jerusalem |date=1996 |isbn=0-349-10809-9 |pages=363-368}}</ref>\n\n===Changes in labour movement===\n\nBetween 1966 and 1979, Britain's unions were changing and becoming more diverse. Most of the increase in union membership was driven by women returning to or entering the workforce\u201473 per cent of them joined a union during that period against 19.3 per cent of men newly in work, as manufacturing jobs, traditionally heavily male, disappeared. Black and Asian workers also filled union ranks; in 1977 61 per cent of black men in work belonged to a union as opposed to 47 per cent of white men.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\">L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA32 32\u201333]</ref> Asian women became the face of the labour movement during the 1976\u201378 [[Grunwick dispute]] over pay and conditions at a film processing plant in suburban London.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 57\u201359\">L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA61 57\u201359]</ref>\n\nWithin unions, power was also devolving to the rank and file. The political upheavals of the late 1960s in Europe and the United States had brought [[participatory democracy]] to the fore, and workers felt [[Industrial democracy|they should be taking decisions]], including about when and whether to strike, that had hitherto been the province of union leadership. [[Hugh Scanlon]], who took over as head of the [[Amalgamated Engineering Union|Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers]] (AUEW) in 1967, and [[Jack Jones (trade unionist)|Jack Jones]], general secretary of the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]] (TGWU) from shortly afterward, were known among union leaders as \"the dubious duo\" for their advocacy for devolution.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\" />\n\n====Dissatisfied public employees====\n\nMany new members were also coming from government jobs. In 1974, about half of the total British workforce was unionised, but 83.1 per cent of all public-sector workers were. In the health sector that reached 90 per cent. Many of the government workers joining unions were women.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\" /> \n\nThe public employees were in a particularly difficult position with regard to incomes policy. Governments kept their employees' pay, already lower than their private-sector colleagues, low both because they could and because they wanted to set an example for the private sector, an example the private sector rarely followed. Their unions were also frustrated that their growing numbers had not yet translated into corresponding influence within the TUC.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 111\">L\u00f3pez, 111</ref>\n\nThese matters came to a head with the 1977 fire brigadiers' strike, a strike that many brigadiers were conflicted about since they knew they would be abandoning their own profession's duty to protect life, but felt that they could no longer make ends meet with their pay packets. They asked a 30 per cent increase, 20 per cent over the government's limit at the time, and a limit to 42 hours of work each week. The government responded by declaring a [[state of emergency]] and bringing in Army troops as replacements. The TUC voted late in the strike to not campaign in support of the brigadiers, in order to maintain its relationship with the government.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 57\u201359\" />\n\n===\"Stepping Stones\" and hardening of Conservative position on unionism===\n\n[[Margaret Thatcher]] was elected [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative leader]] to succeed Heath in 1975. She had been known as a member of his Cabinet, where she served as [[Secretary of State for Education]], for her advocacy of market-based solutions over government intervention in the economy, and had become convinced, as she wrote later, by that experience that the only thing more damaging to the British economy than Labour's socialist policies was her own party's attempts to emulate them. Influenced by writers such as [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Colm Brogan]], she came to believe the power of British unions under the [[postwar consensus]] had come at the expense of Britain as a whole.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 55\u201357\">L\u00f3pez, 55\u201357</ref>\n\nIn 1977 two of her advisors, [[John Hoskyns]] and Norman Strauss, prepared a report called \"[[John Hoskyns#The Stepping Stones Report, 1977|Stepping Stones]]\" which diagrammed the [[vicious cycle]] through which they believed the unions' influence exacerbated Britain's ongoing economic difficulties, such as [[unemployment in the United Kingdom|unemployment]] and inflation. Thatcher made it available to her [[Shadow Cabinet of Margaret Thatcher|shadow cabinet]] with the authors' recommendation that they all read it.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hoskyns|first1=John|authorlink1=John Hoskyns|last2=Strauss|first2=Norman|title=Stepping Stones|url=https://c59574e9047e61130f13-3f71d0fe2b653c4f00f32175760e96e7.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/5B6518B5823043FE9D7C54846CC7FE31.pdf|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|date=14 November 1977|accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref> By the end of the year she had formed a steering group to develop a specific policy aimed at curbing union power under a Tory government, and a media strategy that would invest the public in this.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 55\u201357\" />\n\nTo implement the media strategy, the party hired the advertising firm of [[Saatchi & Saatchi]], whose 1978 \"[[Labour Isn't Working]]\" campaign has been credited with persuading Callaghan not to hold an election that year. In 1978 Britain's largest tabloid, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', dropped its longtime support for Labour to instead embrace the Tories. Editor [[Larry Lamb (newspaper editor)|Larry Lamb]] met frequently with Thatcher's media advisor [[Gordon Reece]] to plan and refine strategy.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 18\">L\u00f3pez, 18</ref> During the later phases of the Grunwick dispute, as strikers took to the streets to march and sometimes clashed violently with the police, the Tories began using the media coverage to leverage \"Stepping Stones\"' critique of unionism.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 58\u201359\">L\u00f3pez, 58\u201359</ref>\n\n==Ford negotiations==\n\nAlthough not an official guideline, the pay rise set by [[Ford of Britain]] was accepted throughout private industry as a benchmark for negotiations.  Ford had enjoyed a good year, and could afford to offer a large pay rise to its workers.  The company was, however, also a major government contractor.  Ford's management therefore made a pay offer within the 5 per cent guidelines. In response, 15,000 Ford workers, mostly from the [[Transport and General Workers Union]] (TGWU), began an unofficial strike on 22 September 1978, which subsequently became an official TGWU action on 5 October.  The number of participants grew to 57,000.\n\nDuring the strike, [[Vauxhall Motors]] employees accepted an 8.5 per cent rise.  After long negotiation in which they weighed the chances of suffering from government sanctions against the continued damage of the strike, Ford eventually revised their offer to 17 per cent and decided to accept the sanctions; Ford workers accepted the rise on 22 November.\n\n==Political difficulties==\nAs the Ford strike was starting, the Labour Party conference began at [[Blackpool]]. Terry Duffy, the delegate from [[Liverpool Wavertree (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Wavertree]] Constituency Labour Party and a supporter of the [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] group, moved a motion on 2 October which demanded \"that the Government immediately cease intervening in wage negotiations\". Despite a plea from [[Michael Foot]] not to put the motion to the vote, the resolution was carried by 4,017,000 to 1,924,000. The next day, the Prime Minister accepted the fact of defeat by saying \"I think it was a lesson in democracy yesterday\", but insisted that he would not let up on the fight against inflation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Labour Party|title=Report of the Annual Conference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sjCNAAAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Labour Representation Committee|page=235}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the government's situation in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] was increasingly difficult; through by-elections it had lost its majority of three seats in 1976 and had been forced to put together a [[Lab-Lib pact#1977|pact]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in 1977 in order to keep winning votes on legislation; the pact lapsed in July 1978.  A decision to grant extra parliamentary seats to [[Northern Ireland]] afforded temporary support from the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], but the Unionists were clear that this support would be withdrawn immediately after the Bill to grant extra seats had been passed &ndash; it was through the Ulster Unionists agreeing to abstain that the government defeated a [[motion of no confidence]] by 312 to 300 on 9 November.<ref name=hay/>\n\n===Further negotiation at the TUC===\nBy the middle of November it was clear that Ford would offer an increase substantially over the 5 per cent limit. The government subsequently entered into intense negotiations with the TUC, hoping to produce an agreement on pay policy that would prevent disputes and show political unity in the run-up to the general election. A limited and weak formula was eventually worked out and put to the General Council of the TUC on 14 November, but its General Council vote was tied 14\u201314, with the formula being rejected on the chair's casting vote. One important personality on the TUC General Council had changed earlier in 1978 with [[Moss Evans]] replacing [[Jack Jones (trade union leader)|Jack Jones]] at the TGWU. Evans proved a weak leader of his union, although it is doubtful whether Jones could have restrained the actions of some of the TGWU shop stewards.\n\nAfter Ford settled, the government announced on 28 November that sanctions{{clarify|date=August 2013}} would be imposed on Ford, along with 220 other companies, for breach of the pay policy. The announcement of actual sanctions produced an immediate protest from the [[Confederation of British Industry]] which announced that it would challenge their legality. The Conservatives put down a motion in the House of Commons to revoke the sanctions. A co-ordinated protest by left-wing Labour MPs over spending on defence forced the debate set for 7 December to be postponed; however on 13 December an anti-sanctions amendment was passed by 285 to 279. The substantive motion as amended was then passed by 285 to 283. James Callaghan put down a further motion of confidence for the next day, which the government won by ten votes (300 to 290), but accepted that his government could not use sanctions. In effect this deprived the government of any means of enforcing the 5 per cent limit on private industry.\n\n==Severe weather==\n\nA mild autumn turned cold on the morning of 25 November when temperatures recorded at [[Heathrow Airport]] dropped from {{convert|14|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|0|\u00b0C}} overnight, with some snowflakes. Throughout most of the following month, wintry conditions lingered, only for temperatures to rise well above {{convert|10|\u00b0C}} around Christmas. On 30 December, the cold returned, along with rain that soon turned to snow; the next day 1979 ended with Heathrow recording a high of only {{convert|-3|\u00b0C}} amid steady snowfall.<ref name=\"The British and their weather\">{{cite book |last1=Nobbs |first1=Patrick |title=The Story of the British and Their Weather: From Frost Fairs to Indian Summers |date=2015 |publisher=Amberley Publishing Ltd. |isbn=9781445644615 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wUp4BgAAQBAJ&pg=PT92&lpg=PT9 |accessdate=April 20, 2020 |chapter=9; The Winter of Discontent 1978\u201379}}</ref>\n\nThe effects were more severe outside of London. [[Ilfracombe]] and other towns in [[North Devon]] could only be reached by helicopter as many roads could not be adequately cleared. The [[Royal Automobile Club]] blamed local councils, who in turn pointed to unresolved issues with their unions and staff shortages. Two Scottish trains near [[Stirling]] were stuck in the snow, leaving 300 passengers stranded. Only three League football matches could take place over the [[New Year's Day|New Year's]] holiday, and all rugby contests were canceled.<ref name=\"The British and their weather\" />\n\n==Lorry drivers==\nWith the government now having no way of enforcing its pay policy, unions which had not yet put in pay claims began to increase their aim. The first to take  action were [[truck|lorry]] drivers, members of the TGWU. Large numbers of the lorry drivers worked on oil tankers, and drivers working for [[BP]] and [[Esso]] began an overtime ban in support of rises of up to 40 per cent on 18 December. With supplies of oil being disrupted, the [[Cabinet Office]] prepared \"Operation Drumstick\", by which the [[British Army|Army]] were put on standby to take over from the tanker drivers. However, the operation would need the declaration of a [[state of emergency]] in order to allow conscription of the assets of the oil companies, and the government drew back from such a step. Before the situation developed into a crisis the oil companies settled on wage rises of around 15 per cent.\n\nFrom 3 January 1979 an unofficial strike of all TGWU lorry drivers began. With petrol distribution held up, petrol stations closed across the country. The strikers also [[Picketing (protest)|picketed]] the main ports. The strikes were made official on 11 January by the TGWU and 12 January by the United Road Transport Union. With 80 per cent of the nation's goods transported by road, essential supplies were put in danger as striking drivers picketed those firms that continued to work. While the oil tanker drivers were working, the main refineries were also targeted and the tanker drivers let the strikers know where they were going, allowing for flying pickets to turn them back at their destination. More than a million UK workers were laid off temporarily during the disputes.\n\nA further plan was drawn up to call a state of emergency and safeguard essential supplies through the Army, regarding which the government warned the TGWU leadership, which resulted in the union accepting (12 January 1979) a list of emergency supplies which were officially exempt from action. In practice, what counted as an emergency was left up to local officials of the TGWU to determine, and practice across the country varied according to the views of the local shop stewards who established \"dispensation committees\" to decide. When strikers in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] did not allow the correct mix of animal feed through to local farms, the farmers dropped the bodies of dead piglets and chickens outside the union offices; the union contended that the farmers had actually wrung the chicken's necks to kill them, and the piglets had been killed when the sow rolled over and crushed them.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn 29 January, lorry drivers in the South West accepted a deal awarded by an [[arbitration|arbitration panel]] of a rise of up to 20 per cent, just \u00a31 per week less than the union had been striking for; this settlement proved a model which was accepted throughout the country.\n\n==\"Crisis? What crisis?\"==\nOn 10 January, [[James Callaghan]] arrived back from a [[Guadeloupe Conference|summit in Guadeloupe]] in the middle of the lorry drivers' strike. Having been tipped off that the press were present, his press secretary Tom McCaffrey advised him to say nothing and return immediately to work, but his political adviser [[Thomas McNally, Baron McNally|Tom McNally]] thought that the image of Callaghan returning and declaring his intent to take control of the situation would be reassuring. Callaghan therefore decided to give a press conference at [[Heathrow Airport]]. To McNally's dismay Callaghan was jocular and referred to having had a swim in the Caribbean during the summit. He was then asked (by a reporter from the ''[[Evening Standard]]'') \"What is your general approach, in view of the mounting chaos in the country at the moment?\" and replied:\n\n{{Quote|Well, that's a judgment that you are making. I promise you that if you look at it from outside, and perhaps you're taking rather a parochial view at the moment, I don't think that other people in the world would share the view that there is mounting chaos.}}\n\nThe next day's edition of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' featured the famous headline \"Crisis? What crisis?\" with a subheading \"Rail, lorry, jobs chaos \u2013 and Jim blames Press\", condemning Callaghan as being \"out of touch\" with British society.<ref name=bbc>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge79.shtml BBC News \u2013 History of the Winter of Discontent]</ref>\n\n==Public sector employees==\n22 January 1979 was the biggest individual day of strike action since the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike]] of 1926, and many workers stayed out indefinitely afterwards.  With many in the private sector having achieved substantial rises, the public sector unions became increasingly concerned to keep pace in terms of pay. The government had already announced a slight weakening of the policy on 16 January, which gave the unions cause for hope that they might win and use free collective bargaining. Train drivers belonging to [[ASLEF]] and the [[National Union of Railwaymen]] had already begun a series of 24-hour strikes, and the [[Royal College of Nursing]] conference on 18 January decided to ask that the pay of nurses be increased to the same level in real terms as 1974, which would mean a 25 per cent average rise.  The public sector unions labelled the date the \"Day of Action\", in which they held a 24-hour strike and marched to demand a \u00a360 per week minimum wage.\n\nWith the succession of strikes having been called and then won, many groups of workers began to take unofficial action \u2013 often without the consent or support of the union leaderships. Ambulance drivers began to take strike action in mid-January, and in parts of the country (London, West Midlands, [[Cardiff]], [[Glasgow]] and the west of Scotland) their action included refusing to attend 999 emergency calls. In these areas, the Army was drafted in to provide a skeleton service. Ancillary hospital staff also went on strike.<ref name=bbc/> On 30 January, the [[Secretary of State for Social Services]] [[David Ennals]] announced that 1,100 of 2,300 [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospitals were only treating emergencies, that practically no ambulance service was operating normally, and that the ancillary health service workers were deciding which cases merited treatment. The media reported with scorn that [[cancer]] patients were being prevented from getting essential treatment.\n\n===Gravediggers' strike===\nA notorious industrial action during the winter, and one which was later frequently referred to by Conservative politicians, was the strike by gravediggers, members of the [[GMWU]] in [[Liverpool]] and in [[Tameside]] near [[Manchester]].<ref>Moore (2014), p. 399.</ref> Eighty gravediggers being on strike, [[Liverpool City Council]] hired a factory in [[Speke]] to store the corpses until they could be buried. The Department of Environment noted that there were 150 bodies stored at the factory at one point, with 25 more added every day. The reports of unburied bodies caused concern with the public.<ref name=\"Travis\">{{cite news|last=Travis|first=Alan|title=National archives: Fear of fights at cemetery gates during 1979 winter of discontent|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/30/liverpool-gravedigger-strikes|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 December 2009}}</ref> On 1 February a persistent journalist asked the Medical Officer of Health for Liverpool, Dr Duncan Bolton, what would be done if the strike continued for months, Bolton speculated that [[burial at sea]] would be considered. Although his response was hypothetical, in the circumstances it caused great alarm. Other alternatives were considered, including allowing the bereaved to dig their own funeral's graves, deploying troops, and engaging private contractors to inter the bodies.  The main concerns were said to be aesthetic because bodies could be safely stored in heat-sealed bags for up to six weeks.<ref name=\"Travis\"/> Bolton later reported being \"horrified\" by the sensationalised reportage of the strike in the mass media.<ref>James Thomas, '\"Bound by History\": The Winter of Discontent in British Politics 1979\u20132004', ''Media, Culture and Society'', 29 (2007), p. 270.</ref> The gravediggers eventually settled for a 14 per cent rise after a fortnight's strike.\n\n===Waste collectors===\nWith many collectors having been on strike since 22 January, local authorities began to run out of space for storing waste and used local parks under their control. The Conservative controlled [[Westminster City Council]] used [[Leicester Square]] in the heart of London's West End for piles of rubbish and, as the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' reported, this attracted [[rat]]s.\n\nOn 21 February, a settlement of the local authority workers' dispute was agreed, whereby workers got an 11 per cent rise, plus \u00a31 per week, with the possibility of extra rises, should a pay comparability study recommend them. Some left-wing local authorities, among them the [[London Borough of Camden]], conceded the union demands in full (known as the \"Camden surplus\") and then saw an investigation by the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|District Auditor]], which eventually ruled it a breach of [[Fiduciary|fiduciary duty]]{{refn|Owed to the payers, the ratepayers of the area|group= n}} and therefore illegal. Camden Borough councillors, among them [[Ken Livingstone]], avoided [[Surcharge (sanction on public servant)|surcharge]]. Livingstone was Leader of the [[Greater London Council]] at the time the decision not to impose a surcharge was made.\n\n==End of the strikes==\nStrikes by essential services dismayed many senior ministers in the Labour government who had been close to the trade union movement, who had thought it unlikely that trade unionists would take such action. Among these was Prime Minister James Callaghan himself, who had built his political career on his connection to the trade unions, and had practically founded one, the [[Inland Revenue Staff Federation]]. Callaghan called the actions of the strikers \"free collective vandalism\".<ref>{{cite web |title=CALLAGHAN DEPICTS STRIKERS AS VANDALS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/02/archives/callaghan-depicts-strikers-as-vandals-britons-woes-mount-as-workers.html |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=30 November 2019 |date=2 February 1979}}</ref><ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nThe government was negotiating with the senior union leaders and on 11 February came to agreement on a proposal to be put to the TUC General Council. On 14 February the General Council agreed the concordat, published under the title \"The Economy, the Government, and Trade Union Responsibilities\".{{refn|The significance of a comprehensive agreement on [[Valentine's Day]] was remarked upon by the press{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}|group= n}} By this stage union executives had limited control over their members and strikes did not immediately cease, although they began to wind down from this point. In total in 1979, 29,474,000 working days were lost in industrial disputes, compared with 9,306,000 in 1978.\n\n==Political fallout==\nIn the summer before the Winter of Discontent, the minority Labour government's fortunes in the opinion polls had been improving and suggested that they could gain an overall majority in the event of a general election being held. However, on 7 September 1978, Callaghan announced that no general election would be held that year. Callaghan's failure to call an election would ultimately prove to be a costly mistake for his government.<ref name=calruns>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/7/newsid_2502000/2502781.stm |work=BBC News | title=1978: Callaghan accused of running scared | date=7 September 1978}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Thatcher-loc.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Margaret Thatcher]], who won the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] and became Prime Minister]]\nThe strikes appeared to have a profound effect on voting intention. According to [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]], Labour had a lead of 5 percentage points over the Conservatives in November 1978, which turned to a Conservative lead of 7.5 percentage points in January 1979, and of 20 percentage points in February. On 1 March, referendums on [[devolution]] to Scotland and Wales were held. That in Wales went strongly against devolution; that in Scotland produced a small majority in favour which did not reach the threshold set by Parliament of 40 per cent of that electorate. The government's decision not to press ahead with devolution immediately led the [[Scottish National Party]] to withdraw support from the government and on 28 March in a [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|motion of no confidence the government lost by one vote]], precipitating a [[1979 United Kingdom general election|general election]].\n\n[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[Margaret Thatcher]] had already outlined her proposals for restricting trade union power in a [[party political broadcast]] on 17 January in the middle of the lorry drivers' strike. During the election campaign the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] made extensive use of the disruption caused during the strike. One broadcast on 23 April began with the Sun's headline \"Crisis? What Crisis?\" being shown and read out by an increasingly desperate voiceover interspersed with film footage of piles of rubbish, closed factories, picketed hospitals and locked graveyards. The scale of the Conservatives' victory in the general election has often been ascribed to the effect of the strikes, as well as their \"[[Labour Isn't Working]]\" campaign, and the party used film of the events of the winter in election campaigns for years to come.\n\nFollowing Thatcher's election win, she brought the [[post-war consensus]] to a halt and made drastic changes to trade union laws (most notably the regulation that unions had to hold a ballot among members before calling strikes) and as a result strikes were at their lowest level for 30 years by the time of the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], which the Conservatives won by a landslide.<ref name=\"83electionyoutube\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7noHkLaZ5VI|title=Conservative Party Election Broadcast (1983)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Organized labour|United Kingdom}}\n\n* [[Three-Day Week]], the [[Heath government]]'s reaction to the [[coal mining|coal miner]]s' [[work-to-rule]] and strikes in 1974, with a similarly disastrous impact on the government's popularity and led to the period of [[Labour government, 1974\u20131979|Labour government]].\n* [[Labour Isn't Working]]\n* [[Strike wave of 1945\u201346]], in U.S., followed by election of conservative Republican majorities in Congress who also passed laws restricting union activities\n* [[Winter of 1946\u201347 in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=n}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Beckett, Andy.

However, some employees' unions conducted their negotiations within mutually agreed limits above this limit with employers.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/28/newsid_2531000/2531007.stm  On This Day: 1979: Early election as Callaghan defeated], [[BBC]].

Public sector employee strike actions included an unofficial strike by [[gravedigger]]s working in [[Liverpool]] and [[Tameside]], and strikes by refuse collectors.

Crosland had argued in his book ''[[The Future of Socialism]]'' that the government exerted enough control over private industry that it was not necessary to [[nationalisation|nationalise]] it as [[Clause IV|the party had long called to do]], and that the ultimate goals of [[socialism]] could be as readily achieved by assuring long-term economic stability and building out the social [[welfare state]]. His \"[[The Future of Socialism#Labour revisionism|revisionist]]\" views became Labour's perspective on the [[post-war consensus]], in which both they and the [[Conservative Party (United Kingdom)|Conservative Party]] agreed in principle on a strong government role in the economy, strong unions and a welfare state as foundational to Britain's prosperity.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\">{{cite book |last=L\u00f3pez |first=Tara Martin |title=The Winter of Discontent: Myth, Memory and History |date=2014 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9781781386019 |pages=40\u201345}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, following the surge in radical left-wing politics of the late 1960s, that view was challenged in another Labour figure's book, [[Stuart Holland]]'s ''The Socialist Challenge''. He argued that contrary to Crosland's assertions, the government could exercise little control over Britain's largest companies, which were likely to continue consolidating into an [[oligopoly]] that, by the 1980s, could raise prices high enough that governments following [[Keynesian economics]] would be unable to ensure their citizens the opportunity for [[full employment]] that they had been able to since the war, and exploit [[transfer pricing]] to avoid paying British taxes. Holland called for  returning to nationalisation, arguing that taking control of the top 25 companies that way would result in a market with more competition and less inflation.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\nHolland's ideas formed the basis of the [[Alternative Economic Strategy]] (AES) promoted by [[Tony Benn]], then [[Secretary of State for Industry]] in the Labour governments of [[Harold Wilson]] and [[James Callaghan]] as they considered responses to [[Pound sterling#1976 sterling crisis|the sterling crisis]] in 1976. The AES called on Britain to adopt a [[protectionism|protectionist]] stance in international trade, including reversing [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|its recent decision to join the European Common Market]], and impose no incomes policy to combat inflation. Benn believed that this approach was more in keeping with Labour's traditional policies and would have its strongest supporters in the unions and outside of them vigorously supporting the government against opposition from the financial sector and commanding heights of industry. It was ultimately rejected in favor of the [[Social Contract (Britain)|Social Contract]] and extensive cuts in public spending as the condition of an [[International Monetary Fund]] loan that supported the pound.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\nThe left wing of the Labour Party, while critical of the revisionist approach and the Social Contract, was not universally supportive of the AES either. Many thought it did not go far enough, or avoided the issue of nationalisation. [[Feminism in the United Kingdom|Feminists]] in particular criticised it for its focus on traditionally male-dominated manufacturing jobs and ignoring the broader issues that the increasing amount of women in the workforce faced, preferring a focus on broader social issues rather than just working conditions and pay, the traditional areas unions had negotiated with employers.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\n===1960s\u201370s labour law reforms===\n\nIn 1968 Wilson's government appointed the [[Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers' Associations|Donovan Commission]] to review [[United Kingdom labour law|British labour law]] with an eye toward reducing the days lost to strikes every year; many Britons had come to believe the unions were too powerful despite the country's economic growth since the war. It found much of the problem to lie in a parallel system of 'official' signed agreements between unions and employers, and [[Side letter|'unofficial', often unwritten ones]] at the local level, between [[shop steward]]s and managers, which often took precedence in practice over the official ones. The government responded with ''[[In Place of Strife]]'' a [[white paper]] by [[Secretary of State for Employment]] [[Barbara Castle]], which recommended restrictions on unions' ability to strike, such as requiring strikes take place after a member vote and fining unions for unofficial strikes.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 36\">L\u00f3pez, 36</ref>\n\nThe [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC) vigorously opposed making Castle's recommendations law, and Callaghan, then [[Home Secretary]], led a cabinet revolt which led to its abandonment. Callaghan did not believe it would be effective in curtailing unofficial strikes, that the proposals could not pass, and the effort would create unnecessary tension between the government and the unions that were key to its political strength.<ref name=\"Lopez 37\">{{cite book|last=Callaghan|first=James|authorlink=James Callaghan|title=Time and Chance|page=274|date=1987|publisher=Collins|isbn=9780002165150}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, 37</ref>\n\nAfter the Conservatives won [[1970 United Kingdom general election|the following year's election]], they implemented their own legislation to address the issue. The [[Industrial Relations Act 1971]], modeled in part on the U.S. [[Taft-Hartley Act]], passed over determined union opposition, included many of the same provisions as ''In Place of Strife'', and explicitly stated that formal [[collective bargaining agreement]]s would have the force of law unless they had [[disclaimer]]s to the contrary. It also created a [[National Industrial Relations Court]] to handle disputes and put unions under a central registry to enforce their rules.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 38\">L\u00f3pez, 38</ref>\n\nNew Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] hoped that the new law would not only address the strike issue but the steep [[inflation]] plaguing the British economy (along with other industrial capitalist economies) at the time, eliminating the need for a separate [[incomes policy]] by having a moderating effect on pay increases demanded by unions. Ongoing union resistance to the Industrial Relations Act led to a [[House of Lords]] ruling in their favor over demonstrations and widespread unofficial strikes following the [[Pentonville Five]]'s imprisonment for continuing to picket a London container depot in violation of a court order, which undermined the legislation. Coal miners [[UK miners' strike (1972)|officially went on strike]] for the first time in almost half a century in 1972; after two months the strike was settled with the miners getting a 21 per cent increase, less than half of what they had originally sought.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 39\">L\u00f3pez, 39</ref>\n\nHeath as a result turned to an incomes policy; inflation continued to worsen. Its implementation was abandoned in 1973 when [[1973 oil shock|that year's oil embargo]] nearly doubled prices within months. To meet demand for heat in the wintertime, the government had to return to coal, giving the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] more leverage. The government declared a [[state of emergency]] that November, and at the beginning of 1974 limited all nonessential businesses to [[Three-Day Week|three days of electricity each week]] to conserve power. Miners, who had seen their rise from two years before turn into a pay cut in real terms due to the inflation the government had not brought under control, voted overwhelmingly to go on strike in late January.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 39\" />\n\nTwo weeks later, the government responded by calling [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|an election]], running on the slogan \"Who Governs Britain?\". At the end of the month the Conservatives no longer did; Labour and Wilson returned, but [[hung parliament|without a majority]]. They were able to pass the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]], which repealed the Heath government's Industrial Relations Act.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 39\" /> \n\nIn [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October]] they won a majority of three seats; still they needed a coalition with the [[Liberal Party (United Kingdom)|Liberal Party]] to have a majority on many issues. Callaghan, now [[Foreign Secretary]], warned his fellow Cabinet members at the time of the possibility of \"a breakdown of democracy\", telling them that \"If I were a young man, I would emigrate.\"<ref name=\"beckett2010\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-NURERF4hb8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA175#v=onepage&f=false | title=When the Lights Went Out: Britain in the Seventies | publisher=Faber & Faber | author=Beckett, Andy | year=2010 | pages=175 | isbn=978-0-571-22137-0}}</ref>\n\n===Incomes policy===\n\nWilson, and Callaghan, who succeeded him as Prime Minister after Wilson resigned for health reasons in 1976, continued to fight inflation, which peaked at 26.9 per cent in the 12 months to August 1975. While demonstrating to markets [[fiscal responsibility]] the government wished to avoid large increases in unemployment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Colin Hay |title=Chronicles of a Death Foretold: the Winter of Discontent and Construction of the Crisis of British Keynesianism |journal=Parliamentary Affairs |year=2010 |volume=63 |pages=446\u201370 |doi=10.1093/pa/gsp056 |issue=3}}</ref> As part of the campaign to bring down inflation, the government had agreed a \"[[Social Contract (Britain)|Social Contract]]\" with the TUC which allowed for a voluntary [[incomes policy]] in which the pay rises for workers were held down to limits set by the government. Previous governments had brought in incomes policies backed by [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]], but the social contract agreed that this would not happen.<ref name=bbc/>\n\n====Phases I and II====\nPhase I of the pay policy was announced on 11 July 1975 with a [[white paper]] entitled ''The Attack on Inflation''. This proposed a limit on wage rises of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]6 per week for all earning below \u00a38,500 annually.  The [[TUC General Council]] had accepted these proposals by 19 votes to 13. On 5 May 1976 the TUC accepted a new policy for 1976 increases, beginning 1 August, of between \u00a32.50 and \u00a34 per week with further years outlined.  At the Annual Congress on 8 September 1976 the TUC rejected a motion which called for a return to free [[collective bargaining]] (which meant no incomes policy at all) once Phase I expired on 1 August 1977. This new policy was Phase II of the incomes policy.<ref name=hay> Hay, \"The winter of discontent thirty years on.\"</ref>\n\n====Phase III====\nOn 15 July 1977, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]] announced Phase III of the incomes policy in which there was to be a phased return to free collective bargaining, without \"a free-for-all\".  After prolonged negotiations, the TUC agreed to continue with the modest increases recommended for 1977\u201378 under Phase II limits and not to try to reopen pay agreements made under the previous policy, while the Government agreed not to intervene in pay negotiations. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] criticised the power of the unions and lack of any stronger policy to cover the period from the summer of 1978. The inflation rate continued to fall through 1977 and by 1978 the annual rate fell below 10 per cent.<ref name=hay/>\n\nAt the end of the year [[Bernard Donoughue, Baron Donoughue|Bernard Donoughue]], Callaghan's chief policy advisor, sent him a memo analysing possible election dates. He concluded that the following October or November would be the best option, as the economy was likely to remain in good shape through then. After that, he wrote, the outlook was unclear, with pressure from the government's own incomes policy likely.<ref name=\"The Heat of the Kitchen\">{{cite book|last=Donoughue|first=Bernard|authorlink=Bernard Donoughue, Baron Donoughue|title=The Heat of the Kitchen: An Autobiography|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/yE4KAQAAMAAJ?hl=en|page=298|date=2003|isbn=9781842750513}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA61 56\u201357]</ref>\n\n====Five per cent limit====\nAt a May 1978 Downing Street lunch with editors and reporters from the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', Callaghan asked if they believed it was possible that the planned Phase IV would succeed, as he believed it would if the unions and their members understood it was the best way to keep Labour in power. Most told him that it would be difficult, but not impossible. [[Geoffrey Goodman]] disagreed, saying in his view it would be impossible for the union leaders to keep their membership from demanding higher pay increases. \"If that is the case, then I will go over the heads of the trade union leadership and appeal directly to their members\u2014and the voters\", the prime minister responded. \"We have to hold the line on pay or else the government will fall.\"<ref name=\"Goodman 220\u201321\">{{cite book |last1=Goodman |first1=Geoffrey |authorlink1=Geoffrey Goodman |title=From Bevan to Blair: Fifty Years Reporting from the Political Frontline |date=2003 |publisher=Pluto Press |isbn=9780745321783 |pages=220\u201321 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VqlZAAAAMAAJ}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA60 60\u201361]</ref>\n\nHaving prepared for the imminent end of the [[incomes policy]], global inflation supervened and was coming towards [[Interest rate#Historical interest rates|record levels during the 1978\u201382 period]].{{refn|And therefore a second trigger for a rise in [[inflation]]|group= n}} On 21 July 1978 [[Denis Healey]] introduced a new White Paper which set a guideline for pay rises of 5 per cent in the year from 1 August. Callaghan was determined to keep inflation down to single figures, however trade union leaders warned the government that the 5 per cent limit was unachievable, and urged a more flexible approach with a range of settlements between 5 and 8 per cent. [[Terry Duffy]] president of the AUEW described the limit as 'political suicide'. Denis Healey also privately expressed scepticism about the achievability of the limit. The TUC voted overwhelmingly on 26 July to reject the limit and insist on a return to [[collective bargaining|free collective bargaining]] as they were promised.<ref name=\"Conroy\">{{cite book |last1=Conroy |first1=Harry |title=Callaghan |date=2006 |publisher=Haus Publishing |isbn=1-904950-70-1 |pages=109-124}}</ref><ref name=hay/> \n\nIt had been widely expected that Callaghan would call a general election in the autumn of 1978, and that the 5 per cent limit would be revised if Labour won. At a private dinner before that year's TUC conference, Callaghan discussed election strategy with the leaders of major unions. He asked whether he should call an autumn election; with the exception of Scanlon they all urged him to call for one no later than November. Any later, they said, and they could not guarantee their memberships would remain on the job and off the picket line through the winter.<ref name=\"Goodman 226\u201327\">Goodman, 226\u201327, cited at L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA60 60\u201361]</ref>\n\nUnexpectedly however on 7 September, Callaghan announced that he would not be calling a general election that autumn but seeking to go through the winter with continued pay restraint so that the economy would be in a better state in preparation for a spring election, therefore the 5 per cent limit stood. The pay limit was officially termed \"Phase IV\" but most referred to it as \"the 5 per cent limit\". Although the government did not make the 5 per cent limit a legal requirement, it decided to impose penalties on private and public government contractors who broke the limit.<ref name=hay/><ref name=\"Davies\">{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=A.J. |title=To Build a New Jerusalem |date=1996 |isbn=0-349-10809-9 |pages=363-368}}</ref>\n\n===Changes in labour movement===\n\nBetween 1966 and 1979, Britain's unions were changing and becoming more diverse. Most of the increase in union membership was driven by women returning to or entering the workforce\u201473 per cent of them joined a union during that period against 19.3 per cent of men newly in work, as manufacturing jobs, traditionally heavily male, disappeared. Black and Asian workers also filled union ranks; in 1977 61 per cent of black men in work belonged to a union as opposed to 47 per cent of white men.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\">L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA32 32\u201333]</ref> Asian women became the face of the labour movement during the 1976\u201378 [[Grunwick dispute]] over pay and conditions at a film processing plant in suburban London.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 57\u201359\">L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA61 57\u201359]</ref>\n\nWithin unions, power was also devolving to the rank and file. The political upheavals of the late 1960s in Europe and the United States had brought [[participatory democracy]] to the fore, and workers felt [[Industrial democracy|they should be taking decisions]], including about when and whether to strike, that had hitherto been the province of union leadership. [[Hugh Scanlon]], who took over as head of the [[Amalgamated Engineering Union|Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers]] (AUEW) in 1967, and [[Jack Jones (trade unionist)|Jack Jones]], general secretary of the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]] (TGWU) from shortly afterward, were known among union leaders as \"the dubious duo\" for their advocacy for devolution.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\" />\n\n====Dissatisfied public employees====\n\nMany new members were also coming from government jobs. In 1974, about half of the total British workforce was unionised, but 83.1 per cent of all public-sector workers were. In the health sector that reached 90 per cent. Many of the government workers joining unions were women.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\" /> \n\nThe public employees were in a particularly difficult position with regard to incomes policy. Governments kept their employees' pay, already lower than their private-sector colleagues, low both because they could and because they wanted to set an example for the private sector, an example the private sector rarely followed. Their unions were also frustrated that their growing numbers had not yet translated into corresponding influence within the TUC.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 111\">L\u00f3pez, 111</ref>\n\nThese matters came to a head with the 1977 fire brigadiers' strike, a strike that many brigadiers were conflicted about since they knew they would be abandoning their own profession's duty to protect life, but felt that they could no longer make ends meet with their pay packets. They asked a 30 per cent increase, 20 per cent over the government's limit at the time, and a limit to 42 hours of work each week. The government responded by declaring a [[state of emergency]] and bringing in Army troops as replacements. The TUC voted late in the strike to not campaign in support of the brigadiers, in order to maintain its relationship with the government.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 57\u201359\" />\n\n===\"Stepping Stones\" and hardening of Conservative position on unionism===\n\n[[Margaret Thatcher]] was elected [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative leader]] to succeed Heath in 1975. She had been known as a member of his Cabinet, where she served as [[Secretary of State for Education]], for her advocacy of market-based solutions over government intervention in the economy, and had become convinced, as she wrote later, by that experience that the only thing more damaging to the British economy than Labour's socialist policies was her own party's attempts to emulate them. Influenced by writers such as [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Colm Brogan]], she came to believe the power of British unions under the [[postwar consensus]] had come at the expense of Britain as a whole.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 55\u201357\">L\u00f3pez, 55\u201357</ref>\n\nIn 1977 two of her advisors, [[John Hoskyns]] and Norman Strauss, prepared a report called \"[[John Hoskyns#The Stepping Stones Report, 1977|Stepping Stones]]\" which diagrammed the [[vicious cycle]] through which they believed the unions' influence exacerbated Britain's ongoing economic difficulties, such as [[unemployment in the United Kingdom|unemployment]] and inflation. Thatcher made it available to her [[Shadow Cabinet of Margaret Thatcher|shadow cabinet]] with the authors' recommendation that they all read it.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hoskyns|first1=John|authorlink1=John Hoskyns|last2=Strauss|first2=Norman|title=Stepping Stones|url=https://c59574e9047e61130f13-3f71d0fe2b653c4f00f32175760e96e7.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/5B6518B5823043FE9D7C54846CC7FE31.pdf|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|date=14 November 1977|accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref> By the end of the year she had formed a steering group to develop a specific policy aimed at curbing union power under a Tory government, and a media strategy that would invest the public in this.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 55\u201357\" />\n\nTo implement the media strategy, the party hired the advertising firm of [[Saatchi & Saatchi]], whose 1978 \"[[Labour Isn't Working]]\" campaign has been credited with persuading Callaghan not to hold an election that year. In 1978 Britain's largest tabloid, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', dropped its longtime support for Labour to instead embrace the Tories. Editor [[Larry Lamb (newspaper editor)|Larry Lamb]] met frequently with Thatcher's media advisor [[Gordon Reece]] to plan and refine strategy.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 18\">L\u00f3pez, 18</ref> During the later phases of the Grunwick dispute, as strikers took to the streets to march and sometimes clashed violently with the police, the Tories began using the media coverage to leverage \"Stepping Stones\"' critique of unionism.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 58\u201359\">L\u00f3pez, 58\u201359</ref>\n\n==Ford negotiations==\n\nAlthough not an official guideline, the pay rise set by [[Ford of Britain]] was accepted throughout private industry as a benchmark for negotiations.  Ford had enjoyed a good year, and could afford to offer a large pay rise to its workers.  The company was, however, also a major government contractor.  Ford's management therefore made a pay offer within the 5 per cent guidelines. In response, 15,000 Ford workers, mostly from the [[Transport and General Workers Union]] (TGWU), began an unofficial strike on 22 September 1978, which subsequently became an official TGWU action on 5 October.  The number of participants grew to 57,000.\n\nDuring the strike, [[Vauxhall Motors]] employees accepted an 8.5 per cent rise.  After long negotiation in which they weighed the chances of suffering from government sanctions against the continued damage of the strike, Ford eventually revised their offer to 17 per cent and decided to accept the sanctions; Ford workers accepted the rise on 22 November.\n\n==Political difficulties==\nAs the Ford strike was starting, the Labour Party conference began at [[Blackpool]]. Terry Duffy, the delegate from [[Liverpool Wavertree (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Wavertree]] Constituency Labour Party and a supporter of the [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] group, moved a motion on 2 October which demanded \"that the Government immediately cease intervening in wage negotiations\". Despite a plea from [[Michael Foot]] not to put the motion to the vote, the resolution was carried by 4,017,000 to 1,924,000. The next day, the Prime Minister accepted the fact of defeat by saying \"I think it was a lesson in democracy yesterday\", but insisted that he would not let up on the fight against inflation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Labour Party|title=Report of the Annual Conference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sjCNAAAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Labour Representation Committee|page=235}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the government's situation in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] was increasingly difficult; through by-elections it had lost its majority of three seats in 1976 and had been forced to put together a [[Lab-Lib pact#1977|pact]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in 1977 in order to keep winning votes on legislation; the pact lapsed in July 1978.  A decision to grant extra parliamentary seats to [[Northern Ireland]] afforded temporary support from the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], but the Unionists were clear that this support would be withdrawn immediately after the Bill to grant extra seats had been passed &ndash; it was through the Ulster Unionists agreeing to abstain that the government defeated a [[motion of no confidence]] by 312 to 300 on 9 November.<ref name=hay/>\n\n===Further negotiation at the TUC===\nBy the middle of November it was clear that Ford would offer an increase substantially over the 5 per cent limit. The government subsequently entered into intense negotiations with the TUC, hoping to produce an agreement on pay policy that would prevent disputes and show political unity in the run-up to the general election. A limited and weak formula was eventually worked out and put to the General Council of the TUC on 14 November, but its General Council vote was tied 14\u201314, with the formula being rejected on the chair's casting vote. One important personality on the TUC General Council had changed earlier in 1978 with [[Moss Evans]] replacing [[Jack Jones (trade union leader)|Jack Jones]] at the TGWU. Evans proved a weak leader of his union, although it is doubtful whether Jones could have restrained the actions of some of the TGWU shop stewards.\n\nAfter Ford settled, the government announced on 28 November that sanctions{{clarify|date=August 2013}} would be imposed on Ford, along with 220 other companies, for breach of the pay policy. The announcement of actual sanctions produced an immediate protest from the [[Confederation of British Industry]] which announced that it would challenge their legality. The Conservatives put down a motion in the House of Commons to revoke the sanctions. A co-ordinated protest by left-wing Labour MPs over spending on defence forced the debate set for 7 December to be postponed; however on 13 December an anti-sanctions amendment was passed by 285 to 279. The substantive motion as amended was then passed by 285 to 283. James Callaghan put down a further motion of confidence for the next day, which the government won by ten votes (300 to 290), but accepted that his government could not use sanctions. In effect this deprived the government of any means of enforcing the 5 per cent limit on private industry.\n\n==Severe weather==\n\nA mild autumn turned cold on the morning of 25 November when temperatures recorded at [[Heathrow Airport]] dropped from {{convert|14|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|0|\u00b0C}} overnight, with some snowflakes. Throughout most of the following month, wintry conditions lingered, only for temperatures to rise well above {{convert|10|\u00b0C}} around [[Christmas in the United Kingdom|Christmas]]. On 30 December, the cold returned, along with rain that soon turned to snow; the next day 1979 ended with Heathrow recording a high of only {{convert|-3|\u00b0C}} amid steady snowfall.<ref name=\"The British and their weather\">{{cite book |last1=Nobbs |first1=Patrick |title=The Story of the British and Their Weather: From Frost Fairs to Indian Summers |date=2015 |publisher=Amberley Publishing Ltd. |isbn=9781445644615 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wUp4BgAAQBAJ&pg=PT92&lpg=PT9 |accessdate=April 20, 2020 |chapter=9; The Winter of Discontent 1978\u201379}}</ref>\n\nThe effects were more severe outside of London. [[Ilfracombe]] and other towns in [[North Devon]] could only be reached by helicopter as many roads could not be adequately cleared. The [[Royal Automobile Club]] blamed local councils, who in turn pointed to unresolved issues with their unions and staff shortages. Two Scottish trains near [[Stirling]] were stuck in the snow, leaving 300 passengers stranded. Only three League football matches could take place over the [[New Year's Day|New Year's]] holiday, and all rugby contests were canceled.<ref name=\"The British and their weather\" /> \n\n==Lorry drivers==\nWith the government now having no way of enforcing its pay policy, unions which had not yet put in pay claims began to increase their aim. The first to take  action were [[truck|lorry]] drivers, members of the TGWU. Large numbers of the lorry drivers worked on oil tankers, and drivers working for [[BP]] and [[Esso]] began an overtime ban in support of rises of up to 40 per cent on 18 December. With supplies of oil being disrupted, the [[Cabinet Office]] prepared \"Operation Drumstick\", by which the [[British Army|Army]] were put on standby to take over from the tanker drivers. However, the operation would need the declaration of a [[state of emergency]] in order to allow conscription of the assets of the oil companies, and the government drew back from such a step. Before the situation developed into a crisis the oil companies settled on wage rises of around 15 per cent.\n\nFrom 3 January 1979 an unofficial strike of all TGWU lorry drivers began. With petrol distribution held up, petrol stations closed across the country. The strikers also [[Picketing (protest)|picketed]] the main ports. The strikes were made official on 11 January by the TGWU and 12 January by the United Road Transport Union. With 80 per cent of the nation's goods transported by road, essential supplies were put in danger as striking drivers picketed those firms that continued to work. While the oil tanker drivers were working, the main refineries were also targeted and the tanker drivers let the strikers know where they were going, allowing for flying pickets to turn them back at their destination. More than a million UK workers were laid off temporarily during the disputes.\n\nA further plan was drawn up to call a state of emergency and safeguard essential supplies through the Army, regarding which the government warned the TGWU leadership, which resulted in the union accepting (12 January 1979) a list of emergency supplies which were officially exempt from action. In practice, what counted as an emergency was left up to local officials of the TGWU to determine, and practice across the country varied according to the views of the local shop stewards who established \"dispensation committees\" to decide. When strikers in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] did not allow the correct mix of animal feed through to local farms, the farmers dropped the bodies of dead piglets and chickens outside the union offices; the union contended that the farmers had actually wrung the chicken's necks to kill them, and the piglets had been killed when the sow rolled over and crushed them.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn 29 January, lorry drivers in the South West accepted a deal awarded by an [[arbitration|arbitration panel]] of a rise of up to 20 per cent, just \u00a31 per week less than the union had been striking for; this settlement proved a model which was accepted throughout the country.\n\n==\"Crisis? What crisis?\"==\nOn 10 January, [[James Callaghan]] arrived back from a [[Guadeloupe Conference|summit in Guadeloupe]] in the middle of the lorry drivers' strike. Having been tipped off that the press were present, his press secretary Tom McCaffrey advised him to say nothing and return immediately to work, but his political adviser [[Thomas McNally, Baron McNally|Tom McNally]] thought that the image of Callaghan returning and declaring his intent to take control of the situation would be reassuring. Callaghan therefore decided to give a press conference at [[Heathrow Airport]]. To McNally's dismay Callaghan was jocular and referred to having had a swim in the Caribbean during the summit. He was then asked (by a reporter from the ''[[Evening Standard]]'') \"What is your general approach, in view of the mounting chaos in the country at the moment?\" and replied:\n\n{{Quote|Well, that's a judgment that you are making. I promise you that if you look at it from outside, and perhaps you're taking rather a parochial view at the moment, I don't think that other people in the world would share the view that there is mounting chaos.}}\n\nThe next day's edition of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' featured the famous headline \"Crisis? What crisis?\" with a subheading \"Rail, lorry, jobs chaos \u2013 and Jim blames Press\", condemning Callaghan as being \"out of touch\" with British society.<ref name=bbc>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge79.shtml BBC News \u2013 History of the Winter of Discontent]</ref>\n\n==Public sector employees==\n22 January 1979 was the biggest individual day of strike action since the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike]] of 1926, and many workers stayed out indefinitely afterwards.  With many in the private sector having achieved substantial rises, the public sector unions became increasingly concerned to keep pace in terms of pay. The government had already announced a slight weakening of the policy on 16 January, which gave the unions cause for hope that they might win and use free collective bargaining. Train drivers belonging to [[ASLEF]] and the [[National Union of Railwaymen]] had already begun a series of 24-hour strikes, and the [[Royal College of Nursing]] conference on 18 January decided to ask that the pay of nurses be increased to the same level in real terms as 1974, which would mean a 25 per cent average rise.  The public sector unions labelled the date the \"Day of Action\", in which they held a 24-hour strike and marched to demand a \u00a360 per week minimum wage.\n\nWith the succession of strikes having been called and then won, many groups of workers began to take unofficial action \u2013 often without the consent or support of the union leaderships. Ambulance drivers began to take strike action in mid-January, and in parts of the country (London, West Midlands, [[Cardiff]], [[Glasgow]] and the west of Scotland) their action included refusing to attend 999 emergency calls. In these areas, the Army was drafted in to provide a skeleton service. Ancillary hospital staff also went on strike.<ref name=bbc/> On 30 January, the [[Secretary of State for Social Services]] [[David Ennals]] announced that 1,100 of 2,300 [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospitals were only treating emergencies, that practically no ambulance service was operating normally, and that the ancillary health service workers were deciding which cases merited treatment. The media reported with scorn that [[cancer]] patients were being prevented from getting essential treatment.\n\n===Gravediggers' strike===\nA notorious industrial action during the winter, and one which was later frequently referred to by Conservative politicians, was the strike by gravediggers, members of the [[GMWU]] in [[Liverpool]] and in [[Tameside]] near [[Manchester]].<ref>Moore (2014), p. 399.</ref> Eighty gravediggers being on strike, [[Liverpool City Council]] hired a factory in [[Speke]] to store the corpses until they could be buried. The Department of Environment noted that there were 150 bodies stored at the factory at one point, with 25 more added every day. The reports of unburied bodies caused concern with the public.<ref name=\"Travis\">{{cite news|last=Travis|first=Alan|title=National archives: Fear of fights at cemetery gates during 1979 winter of discontent|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/30/liverpool-gravedigger-strikes|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 December 2009}}</ref> On 1 February a persistent journalist asked the Medical Officer of Health for Liverpool, Dr Duncan Bolton, what would be done if the strike continued for months, Bolton speculated that [[burial at sea]] would be considered. Although his response was hypothetical, in the circumstances it caused great alarm. Other alternatives were considered, including allowing the bereaved to dig their own funeral's graves, deploying troops, and engaging private contractors to inter the bodies.  The main concerns were said to be aesthetic because bodies could be safely stored in heat-sealed bags for up to six weeks.<ref name=\"Travis\"/> Bolton later reported being \"horrified\" by the sensationalised reportage of the strike in the mass media.<ref>James Thomas, '\"Bound by History\": The Winter of Discontent in British Politics 1979\u20132004', ''Media, Culture and Society'', 29 (2007), p. 270.</ref> The gravediggers eventually settled for a 14 per cent rise after a fortnight's strike.\n\n===Waste collectors===\nWith many collectors having been on strike since 22 January, local authorities began to run out of space for storing waste and used local parks under their control. The Conservative controlled [[Westminster City Council]] used [[Leicester Square]] in the heart of London's West End for piles of rubbish and, as the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' reported, this attracted [[rat]]s.\n\nOn 21 February, a settlement of the local authority workers' dispute was agreed, whereby workers got an 11 per cent rise, plus \u00a31 per week, with the possibility of extra rises, should a pay comparability study recommend them. Some left-wing local authorities, among them the [[London Borough of Camden]], conceded the union demands in full (known as the \"Camden surplus\") and then saw an investigation by the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|District Auditor]], which eventually ruled it a breach of [[Fiduciary|fiduciary duty]]{{refn|Owed to the payers, the ratepayers of the area|group= n}} and therefore illegal. Camden Borough councillors, among them [[Ken Livingstone]], avoided [[Surcharge (sanction on public servant)|surcharge]]. Livingstone was Leader of the [[Greater London Council]] at the time the decision not to impose a surcharge was made.\n\n==End of the strikes==\nStrikes by essential services dismayed many senior ministers in the Labour government who had been close to the trade union movement, who had thought it unlikely that trade unionists would take such action. Among these was Prime Minister James Callaghan himself, who had built his political career on his connection to the trade unions, and had practically founded one, the [[Inland Revenue Staff Federation]]. Callaghan called the actions of the strikers \"free collective vandalism\".<ref>{{cite web |title=CALLAGHAN DEPICTS STRIKERS AS VANDALS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/02/archives/callaghan-depicts-strikers-as-vandals-britons-woes-mount-as-workers.html |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=30 November 2019 |date=2 February 1979}}</ref><ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nThe government was negotiating with the senior union leaders and on 11 February came to agreement on a proposal to be put to the TUC General Council. On 14 February the General Council agreed the concordat, published under the title \"The Economy, the Government, and Trade Union Responsibilities\".{{refn|The significance of a comprehensive agreement on [[Valentine's Day]] was remarked upon by the press{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}|group= n}} By this stage union executives had limited control over their members and strikes did not immediately cease, although they began to wind down from this point. In total in 1979, 29,474,000 working days were lost in industrial disputes, compared with 9,306,000 in 1978.\n\n==Political fallout==\nIn the summer before the Winter of Discontent, the minority Labour government's fortunes in the opinion polls had been improving and suggested that they could gain an overall majority in the event of a general election being held. However, on 7 September 1978, Callaghan announced that no general election would be held that year. Callaghan's failure to call an election would ultimately prove to be a costly mistake for his government.<ref name=calruns>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/7/newsid_2502000/2502781.stm |work=BBC News | title=1978: Callaghan accused of running scared | date=7 September 1978}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Thatcher-loc.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Margaret Thatcher]], who won the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] and became Prime Minister]]\nThe strikes appeared to have a profound effect on voting intention. According to [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]], Labour had a lead of 5 percentage points over the Conservatives in November 1978, which turned to a Conservative lead of 7.5 percentage points in January 1979, and of 20 percentage points in February. On 1 March, referendums on [[devolution]] to Scotland and Wales were held. That in Wales went strongly against devolution; that in Scotland produced a small majority in favour which did not reach the threshold set by Parliament of 40 per cent of that electorate. The government's decision not to press ahead with devolution immediately led the [[Scottish National Party]] to withdraw support from the government and on 28 March in a [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|motion of no confidence the government lost by one vote]], precipitating a [[1979 United Kingdom general election|general election]].\n\n[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[Margaret Thatcher]] had already outlined her proposals for restricting trade union power in a [[party political broadcast]] on 17 January in the middle of the lorry drivers' strike. During the election campaign the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] made extensive use of the disruption caused during the strike. One broadcast on 23 April began with the Sun's headline \"Crisis? What Crisis?\" being shown and read out by an increasingly desperate voiceover interspersed with film footage of piles of rubbish, closed factories, picketed hospitals and locked graveyards. The scale of the Conservatives' victory in the general election has often been ascribed to the effect of the strikes, as well as their \"[[Labour Isn't Working]]\" campaign, and the party used film of the events of the winter in election campaigns for years to come.\n\nFollowing Thatcher's election win, she brought the [[post-war consensus]] to a halt and made drastic changes to trade union laws (most notably the regulation that unions had to hold a ballot among members before calling strikes) and as a result strikes were at their lowest level for 30 years by the time of the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], which the Conservatives won by a landslide.<ref name=\"83electionyoutube\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7noHkLaZ5VI|title=Conservative Party Election Broadcast (1983)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Organized labour|United Kingdom}}\n\n* [[Three-Day Week]], the [[Heath government]]'s reaction to the [[coal mining|coal miner]]s' [[work-to-rule]] and strikes in 1974, with a similarly disastrous impact on the government's popularity and led to the period of [[Labour government, 1974\u20131979|Labour government]].\n* [[Labour Isn't Working]]\n* [[Strike wave of 1945\u201346]], in U.S., followed by election of conservative Republican majorities in Congress who also passed laws restricting union activities\n* [[Winter of 1946\u201347 in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=n}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Beckett, Andy.

Andretti announced that the 2003 Indy 500 would be his final race, and that he would retire from driving immediately after, to focus on team ownership.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/02/sports/plus-auto-racing-michael-andretti-to-retire-in-may.html|title=Michael Andretti To Retire in May|work=The New York Times|date=2003-02-02|accessdate=2012-02-02}}</ref> (Note that [[Michael Andretti|Andretti]] came out of retirement and returned to drive at Indy in [[2006 Indianapolis 500|2006]]-[[2007 Indianapolis 500|2007]].)\n\nDespite the open wheel \"split\" continuing into what was now its eighth season, nearly all of the top [[Champ Car|CART]]-based teams entered at Indy for 2003. It was the fourth consecutive year that CART-based teams entered the Indy 500, and each successive year saw an increased number of participants \"crossing over.\" The 2003 season was a turning point in the \"split,\" as several teams, including [[Penske Racing|Penske]], [[Andretti Autosport|Andretti-Green]], [[Chip Ganassi Racing|Ganassi]], and [[Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing|Rahal]] pulled out of CART and defected permanently to the [[IndyCar|Indy Racing League]] on a full-time bases. One of the few holdouts for 2003 was [[Newman/Haas Racing]]. [[Paul Tracy]], a key fixture in the controversial [[2002 Indianapolis 500|2002 race]], also did not enter.\n\nDuring the spring [[Dario Franchitti]] of [[Andretti Autosport|Andretti-Green Racing]] was injured in a [[motorcycle]] accident, which sidelined him for most of the season.<ref>{{cite news | title = Scot Dario becomes an American idol | publisher = [[BBC Sport]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/6700913.stm| accessdate = 2009-07-15 | date=29 May 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Franchitti injured in bike crash| publisher = [[The Scotsman|Scotsman]]| url = http://sport.scotsman.com/motorbikes/Franchitti-injured-in-bike-crash.2417267.jp| accessdate = 2009-07-15}}</ref> [[Robby Gordon]] replaced him in the car at Indy, and Gordon planned to attempt the [[Double Duty (auto racing)|Indy-Charlotte \"Double Duty.\"]]\n\nAfter changes in the rules, [[Greg Ray]] entered and qualified a car carrying the [[13 (number)|number 13]].

If Kanaan was not cleared to drive in enough time, tentative plans were being prepared for Andretti to qualify the car for him.<ref name=\"WRTV 4-23-03\"/> He would then turn the car over to Kanaan on race day. No firm plans had yet been made though for Andretti to actually drive in the race.<ref name=\"USA today 4-23-03\">{{cite news \n|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/irl/indy500/2003-04-22-mario-andretti_x.htm\n|title=Mario Andretti back behind wheel for Indy test|publisher=USA Today|first=Curt|last=Cavin|date=2003-04-23|accessdate=2012-04-26}}</ref>\n\nDuring Andretti's test session, it was noted by many observers that despite his lack of experience in modern Indy cars (which had changed substantially since his retirement in [[1994 Indianapolis 500|1994]]) and his advanced age (63), he quickly reached competitive speed. During the morning session, he turned a lap of 212.509&nbsp;mph,<ref name=\"WRTV 4-23-03\"/> and looked \"as if he had never been away.\" Later in the day, he upped his speed to over 223&nbsp;mph.<ref name=\"WRTV 4-23-03\"/> The success of the test created a stir, and speculation grew during the afternoon that Andretti may even attempt to qualify for the race.\n\nWith only two minutes left in the session, [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]] crashed in turn one, and the yellow light came on. Andretti entered turn one at full speed, and struck debris on the track from Br\u00e4ck's crash. The object, identified by some as the rear wing, or possibly a piece of foam from the impacted [[SAFER Barrier]], pitched the nose of Andretti's car upward, and the car became airborne. The car then went into a rapid double-reverse somersault flip at speeds exceeding 200 miles per hour.<ref name=\"NYT 4-24-03\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/24/sports/plus-auto-racing-mario-andretti-crashes-at-indy.html\n|title=Mario Andretti Crashes at Indy|publisher=The New York Times|date=2003-04-24|accessdate=2012-04-26}}</ref> Television footage from the [[WTHR]] helicopter-cam showed that the car clipped the top of the debris fence, and was nearly high enough to go over it.

That was short of the traditional 33 starters for the race, and there was ongoing speculation around the garage area on who would potentially fill the four open spots. At the onset, drivers were flirting with the 230&nbsp;mph barrier.\n\nOn Tuesday May 6, rookie [[Dan Wheldon]] (231.108&nbsp;mph) became the first driver to break the 230&nbsp;mph barrier. A day later, [[Kenny Brack]] (231.039&nbsp;mph) also broke 231&nbsp;mph. [[Dan Wheldon]] set the fastest lap of the month on Thursday May 8 at 232.202&nbsp;mph, the fastest lap run at the Speedway since [[1996 Indianapolis 500|1996]].\n\nOn \"Fast Friday\" May 9, [[Arie Luyendyk]] spun exiting turn one, and hit the outside wall with the back end of the car. The car slid down the track, and hit the outside wall in turn 2 also. Luyendyk suffered a back injury, and soreness in his neck and shoulders. Ultimately, Luyendyk decided to sit out the race, and retired from driving permanently.\n\n===Time trials \u2013 Pole Day===\nPole Day was scheduled for Saturday May 10. During the morning practice session [[Billy Boat]] spun out of turn four, and made heavy contact with the safety attenuator at the north end of the pit wall. The car hit with the back end, flew up into the air momentarily, and came to rest against the outside wall on the mainstretch. The energy-absorbing barrier was demolished, but officials stated that the barrier withstood the impact, and worked effectively.<ref name=\"Daily Trackside Report\"/> Boat was transferred to [[Methodist Hospital of Indianapolis|Methodist Hospital]] for observation, but was eventually released and cleared to drive.<ref name=\"Daily Trackside Report\"/> By the time that track crews could replace the barrier, rain began to fall. A violent thunderstorm swept through the area, and washed out qualifying for the afternoon.<ref name=\"Daily Trackside Report\"/>\n\nPole qualifying was moved to Sunday May 11. The weather was cool and windy. [[Robbie Buhl]] was the first car to make an attempt, and he put his car the field with a safe run of 224.369&nbsp;mph. At 12:30&nbsp;p.m., rookie [[Scott Dixon]] (230.099&nbsp;mph) was the first car over 230&nbsp;mph. At 12:45&nbsp;p.m., [[Robby Gordon]] (230.205&nbsp;mph) took over the provisional pole position.\n\nAt 12:55&nbsp;p.m., rookie [[A. J. Foyt IV]] was attempting to become the youngest driver ever to qualify for the Indy 500. On his first lap, he spun exiting turn 2, did not hit the wall, and slid backwards down nearly the entire length of the backstretch. He was uninjured.\n\nThe first trip through the qualifying line was completed at about 1:45&nbsp;p.m. Several drivers had pulled out of line, waiting for better conditions. At 2:41&nbsp;p.m., [[Tony Kanaan]] took over the top spot with a run of 231.006&nbsp;mph.\n\nAt 4:36&nbsp;p.m., two-time defending race winner [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] (231.725&nbsp;mph) secured the pole position. [[Tony Kanaan]] was bumped to the middle of the front row, and [[Robby Gordon]] held on to the outside of the front row. The day ended with [[A. J. Foyt IV]] completing a run, and [[Gil de Ferran]], the last car with a realistic shot of the front row, turning in a somewhat-disappointing 228.633&nbsp;mph, good enough only for 10th starting position.\n\n===Practice \u2013 week 2===\nPractice resumed on Wednesday May 14. With nine spots open in the field, unqualified teams began to prepare for the final day of qualifying. [[Alex Barron (racing driver)|Alex Barron]] was named to replace [[Arie Luyendyk]] in the [[Mo Nunn]] entry. By Thursday, 32 car/driver combinations had materialized.\n\nAmong the fastest drivers who had yet to qualify were [[Jimmy Vasser]] (228.275&nbsp;mph) and Alex Barron (227.714&nbsp;mph). Vasser missed the first weekend of time trials due to his participation in the [[Champ Car]] [[2003 German 500|German 500]].\n\n===Time trials \u2013 Bump Day===\nThe final day of time trials, Sunday, May 18, opened with nine spots open in the field. During the week, there was considerable concern about the prospects of filling the field to the [[Indianapolis 500 traditions|traditional 33 starters]]. [[Airton Dar\u00e9]] and [[Vitor Meira]] were named to rides in the morning, meaning there were then nine cars preparing to qualify.\n\nTime trials opened at 12:30&nbsp;p.m., with [[Jimmy Kite]] the first car out. After two fast laps, however, the car stalled with an electrical problem. In the first half-hour, three cars qualified, led by [[Jimmy Vasser]], and the field was up to 27 cars.\n\n[[Jimmy Kite]] returned to the track, this time qualifying without incident. [[Airton Dar\u00e9]] stalled several times trying to leave the pits, but after repairs, he qualified to fill the field to 29 cars. Just before 2 p.m., [[Alex Barron (racing driver)|Alex Barron]] and [[Richie Hearn]] completed runs, and the field was up to 31 cars. Hearn's team acquired a Penske back-up car, and he was safely in the field.\n\nAt 3 p.m., there were two spots left in the field. Only two cars remained on the sidelines, [[Robby McGehee]] and [[Vitor Meira]]. No other teams were planning on qualifying, although a rumor circulated around the garage area that [[Chip Ganassi Racing|Ganassi]] was considering on wheeling out a backup car for [[Jeff Ward (motorsports)|Jeff Ward]]. McGehee (224.493&nbsp;mph) completed his qualifying attempt at 3:30&nbsp;p.m., leaving only one spot open in the grid. At 4:05&nbsp;p.m., Meira (227.158&nbsp;mph) filled the field to 33 cars. At that point, the track was opened for practice, and the track officially closed at 6 o'clock without any other qualifiers.\n\nThe series avoided the embarrassment{{Clarify|date=July 2012}} of not filling the field to the traditional 33 cars. The race had not failed to do so since [[1947 Indianapolis 500|1947]], when several drivers that were members of ASPAR (the American Society of Professional Auto Racing) threatened to boycott the race over the purse size.<ref>{{cite news \n|url=http://www.racer.com/indianapolis-500-centenary-countdown-not-33-times-3/article/180996/\n|title=Indianapolis 500 Centenary Countdown: Not 33 (times 3)\n|publisher=Racer magazine\n|date=2010-10-14\n|accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref> Nonetheless, some members of the media chastised the effort, later nicknaming the afternoon \"Fill Day\" rather than the traditional ''Bump Day''.

[[Mari Hulman George]] gave the command to start engines at 10:47&nbsp;a.m. EST, and all 33 cars pulled away from the starting grid. It would be the final time that the race would begin at the traditional 11 a.m. EST start time.\n\nPolesitter [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] took the lead at the start, and led for the first 16 laps. The first yellow came out on lap 9 when [[Billy Boat]] stalled in turn two. After the restart on lap 15, [[Sarah Fisher]] spun in turn three, hitting the outside wall. After pit stops, [[Scott Dixon]] took the lead on lap 17.\n\n===First half===\n[[Michael Andretti]] led 28 laps in the first half, but during a pit stop on lap 98, the car quit with the broken throttle linkage.\n\nOn lap 61, [[Richie Hearn]] got up in the \"marbles\" in turn two, hitting the outside wall. [[Jaques Lazier]] spun to avoid the crash and came to rest on the inside of the track. Both drivers were uninjured.\n\nThe lead changed several times in the first half, with [[Tomas Scheckter]], [[Tony Kanaan]], and [[Jimmy Vasser]] each taking turns in the lead. [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] and [[Gil de Ferran]] were running in the top 5 most of the way.\n\n===Second half===\n[[Tomas Scheckter]] led from laps 101-128, with [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] close behind in second. On lap 127, [[Airton Dare]] crashed in turn 2, bringing out the caution, and the leaders all made pit stops. Castroneves beat Scheckter out of the pits and took the lead. [[Gil de Ferran]] was in third. On lap 135 restart, de Ferran passed Scheckter for second place.\n\nAt lap 150, Penske teammates Castroneves and [[Gil de Ferran]] were still running 1st-2nd. Castroneves was looking to put himself in position to win his third \"500\" in a row. The leaders made their final pit stops on laps 165-168. After the sequence of green flag stops, Castroneves and de Ferran were again running 1st-2nd.\n\nOn lap 169, leader Castroneves was hung up behind the lapped car of [[A. J. Foyt IV]] down the backstretch. While it was not captured by TV cameras, earlier in the race [[A. J. Foyt IV]] had come down and made contact with Castroneves while being lapped in Turn 2. This perhaps led to Castroneves following A. J. Foyt IV through the 2nd turn allowing de Ferran to make the pass for the lead going into turn 3.\n \nOn lap 172, [[Robby Gordon]] stopped on the track with a broken gearbox. The yellow came out, but none of the leaders pitted. Gordon immediately departed the grounds, and flew to Charlotte for the [[Coca-Cola 600]].\n\nWith 25 laps to go, the green came back out with de Ferran leading, and Castroneves in second.\n\n===Finish===\nOn lap 182, [[Scott Sharp]] brushed the wall in turn 4, then crashed in turn 1. After the cleanup, the green came back out on lap 186. One lap later, however, [[Dan Wheldon]] spun in turn three, hit the outside wall, then the car flipped over and landed upside-down. Wheldon was not injured.\n\nDuring the caution for the Wheldon crash, [[Scott Dixon]], who was running in the top ten, was weaving back and forth on the mainstretch to warm up his tires. He began to do it too vigorously, and brushed the inside wall. The car was too damaged to continue.\n\nThe green came out with six laps to go. [[Gil de Ferran]] held off [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] by 0.2290 seconds to win his first Indianapolis 500. After the race, Castroneves coaxed de Ferran to climb the catch fence on the mainstretch, mimicking his own traditional post-race victory celebration. de Ferran ended up retiring at season's end, becoming the fourth Indy 500 winner to retire as a reigning \"500\" champion.\n\nThe \"curse of the Indy three-peat\" prevailed again as Castroneves failed to achieve victory. His three-race career record of 1st-1st-2nd, however, established an Indy record for a driver's first three starts. Castroneves' second place tied [[Al Unser]]'s 1970-1971-1972 effort of 1st-1st-2nd.\n\n==Box score==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Finish\n!Start\n!No\n!Name\n!Qual\n!Rank\n!C\n!E\n!Laps\n!Led\n!Status\n!Entrant\n|-\n!1\n|10\n|6\n|{{Flagicon|BRA}} [[Gil de Ferran]]\n|228.633\n|10\n|P\n|T\n|200\n|31\n|Running\n|[[Team Penske]]\n|-\n!2\n|1\n|3\n|{{Flagicon|BRA}} [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] '''{{Color box|gold|W|border=darkgray}}'''\n|231.725\n|1\n|D\n|T\n|200\n|58\n|Running\n|[[Team Penske]]\n|-\n!3\n|2\n|11\n|{{Flagicon|BRA}} [[Tony Kanaan]]\n|231.006\n|2\n|D\n|H\n|200\n|2\n|Running\n|[[Andretti Green Racing]]\n|-\n!4\n|12\n|10\n|{{Flagicon|RSA}} [[Tomas Scheckter]]\n|227.768\n|12\n|P\n|T\n|200\n|63\n|Running\n|[[Chip Ganassi Racing]]\n|-\n!5\n|7\n|12\n|{{Flagicon|JPN}} [[Toranosuke Takagi|Tora Takagi]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n|229.358\n|7\n|P\n|T\n|200\n|2\n|Running\n|[[Mo Nunn Racing]]\n|-\n!6\n|25\n|20\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Alex Barron (driver)|Alex Barron]]\n|227.274\n|15\n|P\n|T\n|200\n|0\n|Running\n|[[Mo Nunn Racing]]\n|-\n!7\n|8\n|32\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Tony Renna]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n|228.765\n|8\n|D\n|T\n|200\n|0\n|Running\n|[[Kelley Racing]]\n|-\n!8\n|14\n|13\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Greg Ray]]\n|227.288\n|14\n|P\n|H\n|200\n|0\n|Running\n|[[Access Motorsports]]\n|-\n!9\n|17\n|31\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Al Unser, Jr.]] '''{{Color box|gold|W|border=darkgray}}'''\n|226.285\n|20\n|D\n|T\n|200\n|0\n|Running\n|[[Kelley Racing]]\n|-\n!10\n|11\n|55\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Roger Yasukawa]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n|228.577\n|11\n|D\n|H\n|199\n|0\n|Running\n|[[Autobacs Racing Team Aguri#Indy Racing League|Super Aguri Fernandez Racing]]\n|-\n!11\n|19\n|52\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Buddy Rice]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n|226.213\n|22\n|D\n|C\n|199\n|0\n|Running\n|[[Team Cheever]]\n|-\n!12\n|26\n|22\n|{{Flagicon|BRA}} [[Vitor Meira]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n|227.158\n|18\n|D\n|C\n|199\n|0\n|Running\n|[[Team Menard]]\n|-\n!13\n|32\n|18\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Jimmy Kite]]\n|224.195\n|30\n|D\n|C\n|197\n|0\n|Running\n|[[PDM Racing]]\n|-\n!14\n|15\n|54\n|{{Flagicon|JPN}} [[Shinji Nakano]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n|227.222\n|16\n|D\n|H\n|196\n|0\n|Running\n|[[Beck Motorsports]]\n|-\n!15\n|18\n|4\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Sam Hornish, Jr.]]\n|226.225\n|21\n|D\n|C\n|195\n|0\n|Engine\n|[[Panther Racing]]\n|-\n!16\n|6\n|15\n|{{Flagicon|SWE}} [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]] '''{{Color box|gold|W|border=darkgray}}'''\n|229.509\n|6\n|D\n|H\n|195\n|0\n|Running\n|[[Team Rahal]]\n|-\n!17\n|4\n|9\n|{{Flagicon|NZL}} [[Scott Dixon]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n|230.099\n|4\n|P\n|T\n|191\n|15\n|Accident\n|[[Chip Ganassi Racing]]\n|-\n!18\n|23\n|14\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[A.J.

Joining King in the booth were two newcomers, [[Dave Wilson (radio personality)|Dave Wilson]] who served as color commentator, and new \"driver expert\" [[Davey Hamilton]]. Hamilton was on a hiatus from driving after his serious crash at Texas in 2001. The broadcast was heard on 555 affiliates.\n\nThe 2003 race saw all four turn reporters return to their assigned posts from the previous year. The three pit reporters remained the same, although they swapped their locations along pit road. The 2003 race would be the final 500 on the radio for longtime members Howdy Bell and Chuck Marlowe. Bell once again had the limited role of reporting from the track hospital, while Marlowe covered the garage area as he had since 1989.\n\nSponsor guests interviewed in the booth included Tim Manganello ([[BorgWarner]]), Keith Sirios ([[Checkers and Rally's]]), and Chevrolet pace car driver Herb Fishel.

His statements were considered biased in favor of the [[IndyCar|IRL]]/[[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|IMS]], and that he allowed his personal opinions enter his reporting.\n\nDuring [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]] coverage of time trials, [[Vitor Meira]] filled the field to 33 cars. Arute opened his interview with Meira at 5:17&nbsp;p.m. EDT by stating:<ref name=\"TV-ABC\">{{cite AV media|title=2003 Indianapolis 500 Bump Day telecast|publisher=[[ESPN on ABC|ABC]]|date=2003-05-18}}</ref>\n{{cquote|And to all the naysayers who predicted that there would '''''NOT''''' be 33 cars in the field of this year's Indy 500, allow me to introduce you to [[Vitor Meira]].}}\nA minute later, Jenkins replied with:<ref name=\"TV-ABC\"/>\n{{cquote|The naysayers have been proven wrong, there is a 33-car field set for the 500.}}\nAs the day was coming to a close, the television coverage switched to [[ESPN]] for the final hour. Jenkins closed the broadcast with the following commentary at 6:56&nbsp;p.m. EDT:<ref name=\"TV-ESPN\">{{cite AV media|title=2003 Indianapolis 500 Bump Day telecast|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2003-05-18}}</ref>\n{{cquote|I want to again say how disappointed I am in some of the journalists in ''this'' city and in other cities who have questioned the 33-car starting lineup this year.

It was 50 years ago, it is today, and it will be next year and in years to come.}}\nA minute later, Arute followed:<ref name=\"TV-ESPN\"/>\n{{cquote|I want to echo what Bob Jenkins said. From the beginning of the month of May here at Indianapolis, misguided people have said that this race wasn't going to have a field of 33. '''''Hello!'''''

Mora|Jim Mora]] (local [[National Football League|NFL]] coach) who once said to misguided media, ''ya think ya know, but ya just don't know''.}}\n\nJenkins was released from ABC/ESPN at the end of the 2003 season. After a very brief stint covering [[Champ Car|CART]] on [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike TV]] in 2004, and after a single race at ESPN in 2008, he joined Versus (now known as the [[NBC Sports Network]]) in 2009. It was never announced if the on-air comments were a factor in his release, and Jenkins contends he was never informed if that was the case. Following the 2012 season, Jenkins reduced his schedule to a reserve role that includes Carb Day coverage.\n\n==Notes==\n\n===References===\n{{Commons category|2003 Indianapolis 500}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Works cited===\n*''2003 Indianapolis 500 Daily Trackside Report for the Media''\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120427163136/https://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/indy500/history/stats/ Indianapolis 500 History: Race & All-Time Stats] \u2013 Official Site\n\n{{\nIndy 500 Walker|\nPrevious_race = 2002|\nPrevious_winner = [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]]|\nThis_race = 2003|\nThis_winner = [[Gil de Ferran]]|\nNext_race = 2004|\nNext_winner = [[Buddy Rice]]|\n}}\n\n{{Indy 500}}\n{{IndyCar Series Seasons}}\n{{IndyCar Series on ABC}}\n\n[[Category:Indianapolis 500 races]]\n[[Category:2003 in IndyCar]]\n[[Category:2003 in motorsport|Indianapolis 500]]\n[[Category:2003 in American motorsport|Indianapolis 500]]\n[[Category:2003 in sports in Indiana|Indianapolis 500]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|87th running of the Indianapolis 500 motor race}}\n{{Infobox Indy500\n| race_name      = 87th Indianapolis 500\n| race_logo      = Indy500winningcar2003.JPG\n| sanction       = [[IndyCar|Indy Racing League]]\n| season         =[[2003 IndyCar Series season|2003 IndyCar season]]\n| team           =[[Penske Racing]]\n| date           = May 25, 2003\n| winner         = [[Gil de Ferran]]\n| mph            = 156.291 mph\n| pole           = [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]]\n| pole_speed     = 231.725 mph\n| fast_time      = [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]]\n| rookie         = [[Toranosuke Takagi|Tora Takagi]]\n| leader         = [[Tomas Scheckter]] (63)\n| anthem         = [[Daniel Rodr\u00edguez (tenor)|Daniel Rodriguez]]\n| back_home      = [[Jim Nabors]]\n| start_engines  = [[Mari Hulman George]]\n| pace_car       = [[Chevrolet SSR]]\n| pace_driver    = [[Herb Fishel]]\n| starter        = Bryan Howard\n| honorary_start = \n| attendance     = 300,000 (estimated)\n| network        = [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]]\n| announcers     = [[Paul Page]], [[Scott Goodyear]]\n| rating         = 4.6\n| share          = 14\n| previous       = [[2002 Indianapolis 500|2002]]\n| next           = [[2004 Indianapolis 500|2004]]\n}}\n\nThe '''87th Indianapolis 500''' was held at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] in [[Speedway, Indiana]] on Sunday, May 25, 2003.

[[Paul Tracy]], a key fixture in the controversial [[2002 Indianapolis 500|2002 race]], also did not enter.\n\nDuring the spring [[Dario Franchitti]] of [[Andretti Autosport|Andretti-Green Racing]] was injured in a [[motorcycle]] accident, which sidelined him for most of the season.<ref>{{cite news | title = Scot Dario becomes an American idol | publisher = [[BBC Sport]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/6700913.stm| accessdate = 2009-07-15 | date=29 May 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Franchitti injured in bike crash| publisher = [[The Scotsman|Scotsman]]| url = http://sport.scotsman.com/motorbikes/Franchitti-injured-in-bike-crash.2417267.jp| accessdate = 2009-07-15}}</ref> [[Robby Gordon]] replaced him in the car at Indy, and Gordon planned to attempt the [[Double Duty (auto racing)|Indy-Charlotte \"Double Duty.\"]]\n\nAfter changes in the rules, [[Greg Ray]] entered and qualified a car carrying the [[13 (number)|number 13]].

The race was scheduled for the Saturday of Bump Day weekend.\n\n===Mario Andretti crash===\n[[Andretti Autosport|Andretti-Green Racing]] driver, [[Tony Kanaan]], suffered a radial fracture of his arm on April 15 in a crash at [[Indy Japan 300|Motegi]]. On April 23, former Indy 500 winner [[Mario Andretti]] took over Kanaan's car for a test session.<ref name=\"WRTV 4-23-03\">{{cite news|url=http://www.wthr.com/Global/story.asp?S=1246622|title=At 63, Mario not slowing down|publisher=[[WRTV]]|date=2003-04-26|accessdate=2012-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620135137/http://www.wthr.com/Global/story.asp?S=1246622|archive-date=2015-06-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> Andretti retired in [[1994 IndyCar season|1994]], and this was the first time in nine years he had driven a major [[open wheel car]]. If Kanaan was not cleared to drive in enough time, tentative plans were being prepared for Andretti to qualify the car for him.<ref name=\"WRTV 4-23-03\"/> He would then turn the car over to Kanaan on race day. No firm plans had yet been made though for Andretti to actually drive in the race.<ref name=\"USA today 4-23-03\">{{cite news \n|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/irl/indy500/2003-04-22-mario-andretti_x.htm\n|title=Mario Andretti back behind wheel for Indy test|publisher=USA Today|first=Curt|last=Cavin|date=2003-04-23|accessdate=2012-04-26}}</ref>\n\nDuring Andretti's test session, it was noted by many observers that despite his lack of experience in modern Indy cars (which had changed substantially since his retirement in [[1994 Indianapolis 500|1994]]) and his advanced age (63), he quickly reached competitive speed. During the morning session, he turned a lap of 212.509&nbsp;mph,<ref name=\"WRTV 4-23-03\"/> and looked \"as if he had never been away.\" Later in the day, he upped his speed to over 223&nbsp;mph.<ref name=\"WRTV 4-23-03\"/> The success of the test created a stir, and speculation grew during the afternoon that Andretti may even attempt to qualify for the race.\n\nWith only two minutes left in the session, [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]] crashed in turn one, and the yellow light came on. Andretti entered turn one at full speed, and struck debris on the track from Br\u00e4ck's crash. The object, identified by some as the rear wing, or possibly a piece of foam from the impacted [[SAFER Barrier]], pitched the nose of Andretti's car upward, and the car became airborne. The car then went into a rapid double-reverse somersault flip at speeds exceeding 200 miles per hour.<ref name=\"NYT 4-24-03\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/24/sports/plus-auto-racing-mario-andretti-crashes-at-indy.html\n|title=Mario Andretti Crashes at Indy|publisher=The New York Times|date=2003-04-24|accessdate=2012-04-26}}</ref> Television footage from the [[WTHR]] helicopter-cam showed that the car clipped the top of the debris fence, and was nearly high enough to go over it.

That was short of the traditional 33 starters for the race, and there was ongoing speculation around the garage area on who would potentially fill the four open spots. At the onset, drivers were flirting with the 230&nbsp;mph barrier.\n\nOn Tuesday May 6, rookie [[Dan Wheldon]] (231.108&nbsp;mph) became the first driver to break the 230&nbsp;mph barrier. A day later, [[Kenny Brack]] (231.039&nbsp;mph) also broke 231&nbsp;mph. [[Dan Wheldon]] set the fastest lap of the month on Thursday May 8 at 232.202&nbsp;mph, the fastest lap run at the Speedway since [[1996 Indianapolis 500|1996]].\n\nOn \"Fast Friday\" May 9, [[Arie Luyendyk]] spun exiting turn one, and hit the outside wall with the back end of the car. The car slid down the track, and hit the outside wall in turn 2 also. Luyendyk suffered a back injury, and soreness in his neck and shoulders. Ultimately, Luyendyk decided to sit out the race, and retired from driving permanently.\n\n===Time trials \u2013 Pole Day===\nPole Day was scheduled for Saturday May 10. During the morning practice session [[Billy Boat]] spun out of turn four, and made heavy contact with the safety attenuator at the north end of the pit wall. The car hit with the back end, flew up into the air momentarily, and came to rest against the outside wall on the mainstretch. The energy-absorbing barrier was demolished, but officials stated that the barrier withstood the impact, and worked effectively.<ref name=\"Daily Trackside Report\"/> Boat was transferred to [[Methodist Hospital of Indianapolis|Methodist Hospital]] for observation, but was eventually released and cleared to drive.<ref name=\"Daily Trackside Report\"/> By the time that track crews could replace the barrier, rain began to fall. A violent thunderstorm swept through the area, and washed out qualifying for the afternoon.<ref name=\"Daily Trackside Report\"/>\n\nPole qualifying was moved to Sunday May 11. The weather was cool and windy. [[Robbie Buhl]] was the first car to make an attempt, and he put his car the field with a safe run of 224.369&nbsp;mph. At 12:30&nbsp;p.m., rookie [[Scott Dixon]] (230.099&nbsp;mph) was the first car over 230&nbsp;mph. At 12:45&nbsp;p.m., [[Robby Gordon]] (230.205&nbsp;mph) took over the provisional pole position.\n\nAt 12:55&nbsp;p.m., rookie [[A. J. Foyt IV]] was attempting to become the youngest driver ever to qualify for the Indy 500. On his first lap, he spun exiting turn 2, did not hit the wall, and slid backwards down nearly the entire length of the backstretch. He was uninjured.\n\nThe first trip through the qualifying line was completed at about 1:45&nbsp;p.m. Several drivers had pulled out of line, waiting for better conditions. At 2:41&nbsp;p.m., [[Tony Kanaan]] took over the top spot with a run of 231.006&nbsp;mph.\n\nAt 4:36&nbsp;p.m., two-time defending race winner [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] (231.725&nbsp;mph) secured the pole position. [[Tony Kanaan]] was bumped to the middle of the front row, and [[Robby Gordon]] held on to the outside of the front row. The day ended with [[A. J. Foyt IV]] completing a run, and [[Gil de Ferran]], the last car with a realistic shot of the front row, turning in a somewhat-disappointing 228.633&nbsp;mph, good enough only for 10th starting position.\n\n===Practice \u2013 week 2===\nPractice resumed on Wednesday May 14. With nine spots open in the field, unqualified teams began to prepare for the final day of qualifying. [[Alex Barron (racing driver)|Alex Barron]] was named to replace [[Arie Luyendyk]] in the [[Mo Nunn]] entry. By Thursday, 32 car/driver combinations had materialized.\n\nAmong the fastest drivers who had yet to qualify were [[Jimmy Vasser]] (228.275&nbsp;mph) and Alex Barron (227.714&nbsp;mph). Vasser missed the first weekend of time trials due to his participation in the [[Champ Car]] [[2003 German 500|German 500]].\n\n===Time trials \u2013 Bump Day===\nThe final day of time trials, Sunday, May 18, opened with nine spots open in the field. During the week, there was considerable concern about the prospects of filling the field to the [[Indianapolis 500 traditions|traditional 33 starters]]. [[Airton Dar\u00e9]] and [[Vitor Meira]] were named to rides in the morning, meaning there were then nine cars preparing to qualify.\n\nTime trials opened at 12:30&nbsp;p.m., with [[Jimmy Kite]] the first car out. After two fast laps, however, the car stalled with an electrical problem. In the first half-hour, three cars qualified, led by [[Jimmy Vasser]], and the field was up to 27 cars.\n\n[[Jimmy Kite]] returned to the track, this time qualifying without incident. [[Airton Dar\u00e9]] stalled several times trying to leave the pits, but after repairs, he qualified to fill the field to 29 cars. Just before 2 p.m., [[Alex Barron (racing driver)|Alex Barron]] and [[Richie Hearn]] completed runs, and the field was up to 31 cars. Hearn's team acquired a Penske back-up car, and he was safely in the field.\n\nAt 3 p.m., there were two spots left in the field. Only two cars remained on the sidelines, [[Robby McGehee]] and [[Vitor Meira]]. No other teams were planning on qualifying, although a rumor circulated around the garage area that [[Chip Ganassi Racing|Ganassi]] was considering on wheeling out a backup car for [[Jeff Ward (motorsports)|Jeff Ward]]. McGehee (224.493&nbsp;mph) completed his qualifying attempt at 3:30&nbsp;p.m., leaving only one spot open in the grid. At 4:05&nbsp;p.m., Meira (227.158&nbsp;mph) filled the field to 33 cars. At that point, the track was opened for practice, and the track officially closed at 6 o'clock without any other qualifiers.\n\nThe series avoided the embarrassment{{Clarify|date=July 2012}} of not filling the field to the traditional 33 cars. The race had not failed to do so since [[1947 Indianapolis 500|1947]], when several drivers that were members of ASPAR (the American Society of Professional Auto Racing) threatened to boycott the race over the purse size.<ref>{{cite news \n|url=http://www.racer.com/indianapolis-500-centenary-countdown-not-33-times-3/article/180996/\n|title=Indianapolis 500 Centenary Countdown: Not 33 (times 3)\n|publisher=Racer magazine\n|date=2010-10-14\n|accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref> Nonetheless, some members of the media chastised the effort, later nicknaming the afternoon \"Fill Day\" rather than the traditional ''Bump Day''.

[[Mari Hulman George]] gave the command to start engines at 10:47&nbsp;a.m. EST, and all 33 cars pulled away from the starting grid. It would be the final time that the race would begin at the traditional 11 a.m. EST start time.\n\nPolesitter [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] took the lead at the start, and led for the first 16 laps. The first yellow came out on lap 9 when [[Billy Boat]] stalled in turn two. After the restart on lap 15, [[Sarah Fisher]] spun in turn three, hitting the outside wall. After pit stops, [[Scott Dixon]] took the lead on lap 17.\n\n===First half===\n[[Michael Andretti]] led 28 laps in the first half, but during a pit stop on lap 98, the car quit with the broken throttle linkage.\n\nOn lap 61, [[Richie Hearn]] got up in the \"marbles\" in turn two, hitting the outside wall. [[Jaques Lazier]] spun to avoid the crash and came to rest on the inside of the track. Both drivers were uninjured.\n\nThe lead changed several times in the first half, with [[Tomas Scheckter]], [[Tony Kanaan]], and [[Jimmy Vasser]] each taking turns in the lead. [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] and [[Gil de Ferran]] were running in the top 5 most of the way.\n\n===Second half===\n[[Tomas Scheckter]] led from laps 101-128, with [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] close behind in second. On lap 127, [[Airton Dare]] crashed in turn 2, bringing out the caution, and the leaders all made pit stops. Castroneves beat Scheckter out of the pits and took the lead. [[Gil de Ferran]] was in third. On lap 135 restart, de Ferran passed Scheckter for second place.\n\nAt lap 150, Penske teammates Castroneves and [[Gil de Ferran]] were still running 1st-2nd. Castroneves was looking to put himself in position to win his third \"500\" in a row. The leaders made their final pit stops on laps 165-168. After the sequence of green flag stops, Castroneves and de Ferran were again running 1st-2nd.\n\nOn lap 169, leader Castroneves was hung up behind the lapped car of [[A. J. Foyt IV]] down the backstretch. While it was not captured by TV cameras, earlier in the race [[A. J. Foyt IV]] had come down and made contact with Castroneves while being lapped in Turn 2. This perhaps led to Castroneves following A. J. Foyt IV through the 2nd turn allowing de Ferran to make the pass for the lead going into turn 3.\n \nOn lap 172, [[Robby Gordon]] stopped on the track with a broken gearbox. The yellow came out, but none of the leaders pitted. Gordon immediately departed the grounds, and flew to Charlotte for the [[Coca-Cola 600]].\n\nWith 25 laps to go, the green came back out with de Ferran leading, and Castroneves in second.\n\n===Finish===\nOn lap 182, [[Scott Sharp]] brushed the wall in turn 4, then crashed in turn 1. After the cleanup, the green came back out on lap 186. One lap later, however, [[Dan Wheldon]] spun in turn three, hit the outside wall, then the car flipped over and landed upside-down. Wheldon was not injured.\n\nDuring the caution for the Wheldon crash, [[Scott Dixon]], who was running in the top ten, was weaving back and forth on the mainstretch to warm up his tires. He began to do it too vigorously, and brushed the inside wall. The car was too damaged to continue.\n\nThe green came out with six laps to go. [[Gil de Ferran]] held off [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] by 0.2290 seconds to win his first Indianapolis 500. After the race, Castroneves coaxed de Ferran to climb the catch fence on the mainstretch, mimicking his own traditional post-race victory celebration. de Ferran ended up retiring at season's end, becoming the fourth Indy 500 winner to retire as a reigning \"500\" champion.\n\nThe \"curse of the Indy three-peat\" prevailed again as Castroneves failed to achieve victory. His three-race career record of 1st-1st-2nd, however, established an Indy record for a driver's first three starts. Castroneves' second place tied [[Al Unser]]'s 1970-1971-1972 effort of 1st-1st-2nd.\n\n==Box score==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Finish\n!Start\n!No\n!Name\n!Qual\n!Rank\n!C\n!E\n!Laps\n!Led\n!Status\n!Entrant\n|-\n!1\n|10\n|6\n|{{Flagicon|BRA}} [[Gil de Ferran]]\n|228.633\n|10\n|P\n|T\n|200\n|31\n|Running\n|[[Team Penske]]\n|-\n!2\n|1\n|3\n|{{Flagicon|BRA}} [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] '''{{Color box|gold|W|border=darkgray}}'''\n|231.725\n|1\n|D\n|T\n|200\n|58\n|Running\n|[[Team Penske]]\n|-\n!3\n|2\n|11\n|{{Flagicon|BRA}} [[Tony Kanaan]]\n|231.006\n|2\n|D\n|H\n|200\n|2\n|Running\n|[[Andretti Green Racing]]\n|-\n!4\n|12\n|10\n|{{Flagicon|RSA}} [[Tomas Scheckter]]\n|227.768\n|12\n|P\n|T\n|200\n|63\n|Running\n|[[Chip Ganassi Racing]]\n|-\n!5\n|7\n|12\n|{{Flagicon|JPN}} [[Toranosuke Takagi|Tora Takagi]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n|229.358\n|7\n|P\n|T\n|200\n|2\n|Running\n|[[Mo Nunn Racing]]\n|-\n!6\n|25\n|20\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Alex Barron (driver)|Alex Barron]]\n|227.274\n|15\n|P\n|T\n|200\n|0\n|Running\n|[[Mo Nunn Racing]]\n|-\n!7\n|8\n|32\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Tony Renna]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n|228.765\n|8\n|D\n|T\n|200\n|0\n|Running\n|[[Kelley Racing]]\n|-\n!8\n|14\n|13\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Greg Ray]]\n|227.288\n|14\n|P\n|H\n|200\n|0\n|Running\n|[[Access Motorsports]]\n|-\n!9\n|17\n|31\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Al Unser, Jr.]] '''{{Color box|gold|W|border=darkgray}}'''\n|226.285\n|20\n|D\n|T\n|200\n|0\n|Running\n|[[Kelley Racing]]\n|-\n!10\n|11\n|55\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Roger Yasukawa]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n|228.577\n|11\n|D\n|H\n|199\n|0\n|Running\n|[[Autobacs Racing Team Aguri#Indy Racing League|Super Aguri Fernandez Racing]]\n|-\n!11\n|19\n|52\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Buddy Rice]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n|226.213\n|22\n|D\n|C\n|199\n|0\n|Running\n|[[Team Cheever]]\n|-\n!12\n|26\n|22\n|{{Flagicon|BRA}} [[Vitor Meira]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n|227.158\n|18\n|D\n|C\n|199\n|0\n|Running\n|[[Team Menard]]\n|-\n!13\n|32\n|18\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Jimmy Kite]]\n|224.195\n|30\n|D\n|C\n|197\n|0\n|Running\n|[[PDM Racing]]\n|-\n!14\n|15\n|54\n|{{Flagicon|JPN}} [[Shinji Nakano]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n|227.222\n|16\n|D\n|H\n|196\n|0\n|Running\n|[[Beck Motorsports]]\n|-\n!15\n|18\n|4\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Sam Hornish, Jr.]]\n|226.225\n|21\n|D\n|C\n|195\n|0\n|Engine\n|[[Panther Racing]]\n|-\n!16\n|6\n|15\n|{{Flagicon|SWE}} [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]] '''{{Color box|gold|W|border=darkgray}}'''\n|229.509\n|6\n|D\n|H\n|195\n|0\n|Running\n|[[Team Rahal]]\n|-\n!17\n|4\n|9\n|{{Flagicon|NZL}} [[Scott Dixon]] '''{{Color box|orange|R|border=darkgray}}'''\n|230.099\n|4\n|P\n|T\n|191\n|15\n|Accident\n|[[Chip Ganassi Racing]]\n|-\n!18\n|23\n|14\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[A.J.

Hamilton was on a hiatus from driving after his serious crash at Texas in 2001. The broadcast was heard on 555 affiliates.\n\nThe 2003 race saw all four turn reporters return to their assigned posts from the previous year. The three pit reporters remained the same, although they swapped their locations along pit road. The 2003 race would be the final 500 on the radio for longtime members Howdy Bell and Chuck Marlowe. Bell once again had the limited role of reporting from the track hospital, while Marlowe covered the garage area as he had since 1989.\n\nSponsor guests interviewed in the booth included Tim Manganello ([[BorgWarner]]), Keith Sirios ([[Checkers and Rally's]]), and Chevrolet pace car driver Herb Fishel.

His statements were considered biased in favor of the [[IndyCar|IRL]]/[[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|IMS]], and that he allowed his personal opinions enter his reporting.\n\nDuring [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]] coverage of time trials, [[Vitor Meira]] filled the field to 33 cars. Arute opened his interview with Meira at 5:17&nbsp;p.m. EDT by stating:<ref name=\"TV-ABC\">{{cite AV media|title=2003 Indianapolis 500 Bump Day telecast|publisher=[[ESPN on ABC|ABC]]|airdate=2003-05-18}}</ref>\n{{cquote|And to all the naysayers who predicted that there would '''''NOT''''' be 33 cars in the field of this year's Indy 500, allow me to introduce you to [[Vitor Meira]].}}\nA minute later, Jenkins replied with:<ref name=\"TV-ABC\"/>\n{{cquote|The naysayers have been proven wrong, there is a 33-car field set for the 500.}}\nAs the day was coming to a close, the television coverage switched to [[ESPN]] for the final hour. Jenkins closed the broadcast with the following commentary at 6:56&nbsp;p.m. EDT:<ref name=\"TV-ESPN\">{{cite AV media|title=2003 Indianapolis 500 Bump Day telecast|publisher=[[ESPN]]|airdate=2003-05-18}}</ref>\n{{cquote|I want to again say how disappointed I am in some of the journalists in ''this'' city and in other cities who have questioned the 33-car starting lineup this year.

It was 50 years ago, it is today, and it will be next year and in years to come.}}\nA minute later, Arute followed:<ref name=\"TV-ESPN\"/>\n{{cquote|I want to echo what Bob Jenkins said.

After a very brief stint covering [[Champ Car|CART]] on [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike TV]] in 2004, and after a single race at ESPN in 2008, he joined Versus (now known as the [[NBC Sports Network]]) in 2009. It was never announced if the on-air comments were a factor in his release, and Jenkins contends he was never informed if that was the case. Following the 2012 season, Jenkins reduced his schedule to a reserve role that includes Carb Day coverage.\n\n==Notes==\n\n===References===\n{{Commons category|2003 Indianapolis 500}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Works cited===\n*''2003 Indianapolis 500 Daily Trackside Report for the Media''\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120427163136/https://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/indy500/history/stats/ Indianapolis 500 History: Race & All-Time Stats] \u2013 Official Site\n\n{{\nIndy 500 Walker|\nPrevious_race = 2002|\nPrevious_winner = [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]]|\nThis_race = 2003|\nThis_winner = [[Gil de Ferran]]|\nNext_race = 2004|\nNext_winner = [[Buddy Rice]]|\n}}\n\n{{Indy 500}}\n{{IndyCar Series Seasons}}\n{{IndyCar Series on ABC}}\n\n[[Category:Indianapolis 500 races]]\n[[Category:2003 in IndyCar]]\n[[Category:2003 in motorsport|Indianapolis 500]]\n[[Category:2003 in American motorsport|Indianapolis 500]]\n[[Category:2003 in sports in Indiana|Indianapolis 500]]\n", "name_user": "John B123", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed cite errors", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Indianapolis_500"}

''C. d. saulcyi'' and ''C. d. venusta'' occur along the coasts of [[Florida]], the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and [[Mexico]].<ref name=WBTB/> In general, ''C. dorsalis'' is most abundant on broad, fine-sand beaches that are highly exposed to tidal action and relatively undisturbed by humans. In order for the beetles to breed, beaches need to be at least {{convert|100|m}} long and {{convert|2|m}} wide, 5-8 being the optimal width.<ref name=5YR>USFWS.

Adults emerge between mid-June and mid-August, usually reaching peak abundance by mid-July and declining by September. They spend the day foraging in the [[intertidal zone]] when the weather is warm and sunny.<ref name=ESP/> They feed on small [[invertebrate]]s including [[fly|flies]], [[ant]]s, and [[amphipoda|amphipods]], but will also scavenge dead [[fish]] and [[crabs]].<ref name=NBTB>The State Of New Jersey. [http://www.nj.gov/dep/fgw/ensp/pdf/end-thrtened/nebchtgrbeetle.pdf Northeastern Beach Tiger Beetle, ''Cicindela d. dorsalis'']</ref>\n\n[[Mating]] takes place between mid-July and early August when the weather is warm and humid. Females lay their [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] in the intertidal zone. They use sensitive hairs on their abdomen to determine whether the soil moisture content is suitable for larval survival and development.<ref name=ADW/> [[Oviposition]] takes place at night. The female uses her [[ovipositor]] to create a small hole in the sand where she deposits the eggs individually.<ref name=OB>[http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1649/072.066.0403 Observations of Oviposition Behavior Among North American Tiger Beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae: Cicindelinae) Species and Notes on Mass Rearing]</ref>\n\nEggs hatch in mid-August, and the larvae dig vertical burrows where they secure themselves using hooks along their abdomen.<ref name=ADW/> They are predatory and prey on passing insects and other small invertebrates. Tiger beetle larvae go through three [[instars]] before pupating. They usually reach the second instar by September. As winter approaches, the larvae dig new burrows higher up the beach to protect themselves against storms and wave activity. After [[overwintering]], they emerge in late May and June. Then they reach the third instar and overwinter again. The following spring they [[pupa]]te in their burrows and emerge as adults.<ref name=NBTB/>\n\n==Status==\nThe subspecies ''C. d. dorsalis'' (northeastern beach tiger beetle) suffered a major decline over the last 20 years. It used to be found all along the Atlantic coast of the USA from [[Massachusetts]] to [[Virginia]]. Today it only occurs in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] of [[Maryland]], [[Martha's Vineyard]] island off the coast of Massachusetts, and Virginia.<ref name=ESP/> This decline was caused by the destruction and disturbance of the beetle\u2019s natural beach habitat by human activity, one of the greatest threats being shoreline hardening by the placement of [[rip-rap]].<ref name=5YR/> Other threats include [[pollution]] and [[pesticides]], as well as the use of [[off-road vehicles]] that crush adults and larvae, also damaging larval burrows.<ref name=ESP/> In 2009 the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] recommended ''C. d. dorsalis'' be uplisted to endangered status.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Coleoptera}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q5119427}}\n\n[[Category:Cicindela|Dorsalis]]\n[[Category:Beetles of North America]]\n[[Category:Beetles described in 1817]]\n[[Category:Fauna of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Rolling animals]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Species of beetle}}\n{{speciesbox\n|image = Northeastern beach tiger beetle (Cicindela dorsalis dorsalis).jpg\n|image_caption = ''Cicindela dorsalis dorsalis''\n|status = G4\n|status_system = TNC\n|genus = Cicindela\n|species = dorsalis\n|authority = [[Thomas Say|Say]], 1817\n}}\n\n'''''Cicindela dorsalis''''' (common name '''eastern beach tiger beetle''') is a species of [[tiger beetle]].\n\n==Description==\nThe body length is {{convert|13|to|15|mm}}.

''C. d. media'' is found along the southeast coast of the United States, including [[South Carolina]]. ''C. d. dorsalis'' is found along the northeast coast. ''C. d. saulcyi'' and ''C. d. venusta'' occur along the coasts of [[Florida]], the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and [[Mexico]].<ref name=WBTB/> In general, ''C. dorsalis'' is most abundant on broad, fine-sand beaches that are highly exposed to tidal action and relatively undisturbed by humans. In order for the beetles to breed, beaches need to be at least {{convert|100|m}} long and {{convert|2|m}} wide, 5-8 being the optimal width.<ref name=5YR>USFWS. [http://ecos.fws.gov/docs/five_year_review/doc2372.pdf ''Cicindela dorsalis dorsalis'' Five-year Review.]</ref> The eastern beach tiger beetle prefers a climate with average temperatures exceeding 15&nbsp;\u00b0C and moderate to arid rainfall totals.<ref name=ADW>[[Animal Diversity Web]]. [http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Cicindela_dorsalis/#food_habits ''Cicindela dorsalis'' (northeastern beach tiger beetle)]</ref>\n\n==Biology==\nThe entire life cycle lasts 2 years. Adults emerge between mid-June and mid-August, usually reaching peak abundance by mid-July and declining by September. They spend the day foraging in the [[intertidal zone]] when the weather is warm and sunny.<ref name=ESP/> They feed on small [[invertebrate]]s including [[fly|flies]], [[ant]]s, and [[amphipoda|amphipods]], but will also scavenge dead [[fish]] and [[crabs]].<ref name=NBTB>The State Of New Jersey. [http://www.nj.gov/dep/fgw/ensp/pdf/end-thrtened/nebchtgrbeetle.pdf Northeastern Beach Tiger Beetle, ''Cicindela d. dorsalis'']</ref>\n\n[[Mating]] takes place between mid-July and early August when the weather is warm and humid. Females lay their [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] in the intertidal zone. They use sensitive hairs on their abdomen to determine whether the soil moisture content is suitable for larval survival and development.<ref name=ADW/> [[Oviposition]] takes place at night. The female uses her [[ovipositor]] to create a small hole in the sand where she deposits the eggs individually.<ref name=OB>[http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1649/072.066.0403 Observations of Oviposition Behavior Among North American Tiger Beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae: Cicindelinae) Species and Notes on Mass Rearing]</ref>\n\nEggs hatch in mid-August, and the larvae dig vertical burrows where they secure themselves using hooks along their abdomen.<ref name=ADW/> They are predatory and prey on passing insects and other small invertebrates. Tiger beetle larvae go through three [[instars]] before pupating. They usually reach the second instar by September. As winter approaches, the larvae dig new burrows higher up the beach to protect themselves against storms and wave activity. After [[overwintering]], they emerge in late May and June. Then they reach the third instar and overwinter again. The following spring they [[pupa]]te in their burrows and emerge as adults.<ref name=NBTB/>\n\n==Status==\nThe subspecies ''C. d. dorsalis'' (northeastern beach tiger beetle) suffered a major decline over the last 20 years. It used to be found all along the Atlantic coast of the USA from [[Massachusetts]] to [[Virginia]]. Today it only occurs in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] of [[Maryland]], [[Martha's Vineyard]] island off the coast of Massachusetts, and Virginia.<ref name=ESP/> This decline was caused by the destruction and disturbance of the beetle\u2019s natural beach habitat by human activity, one of the greatest threats being shoreline hardening by the placement of [[rip-rap]].<ref name=5YR/> Other threats include [[pollution]] and [[pesticides]], as well as the use of [[off-road vehicles]] that crush adults and larvae, also damaging larval burrows.<ref name=ESP/> In 2009 the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] recommended ''C. d. dorsalis'' be uplisted to endangered status.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Coleoptera}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q5119427}}\n\n[[Category:Cicindela|Dorsalis]]\n[[Category:Beetles of North America]]\n[[Category:Beetles described in 1817]]\n[[Category:Fauna of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Rolling animals]]\n", "name_user": "Lafenton", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicindela_dorsalis"}

Anarchists, along with the Bolsheviks and the Left Essers, became the leading force of the October Revolution. Soon Lenin's party will even adopt the name \"communist\" from [[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkinites]]. But in order to distinguish itself from the anarchist-communists and esser-communists, [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] stresses in his name - \"Communist Bolsheviks\".\n\nIf in the central part of Russia this union was soon broken up, in German-occupied Belarus, the united front of all Soviet parties, acting in the underground, was preserved until early 1919. But then repressions - on the one hand, attracting loyal anarchist Communists to the Communist Party - on the other, the Bolsheviks managed to limit the influence of the anarchist movement. But until the early 1920s, legal and semi-legal anarchist circles were still operating in Belarus. Soon, however, the Councils of People's Self-Government, which was the dream of Peter Kropotkin's supporters, were finally turned by the party bureaucracy into its auxiliary bodies. The anarchists added to the exiles and political isolators.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u0420\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0430! \u0414\u0430 \u0437\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u044f!|last=\u0413\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439|publisher=\u0428SS|year=2015|isbn=|location=\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Anarchism in Republic Belarus ==\nThe revival of anarchism takes place already in the years of [[perestroika]]. However, in the 60-70s in Minsk, [[Gomel]] and other cities there were \"hippies,\" which can be referred to anarchist subculture with a certain degree of tension. However, there were no organizations in this case, of course.\n\nIn the spring of 1991, Gomel anarchists took part in a citywide strike, helping the workers of the \"Polespechat\" factory to join it.\n\nIn summer 1992, at the initiative of Oleg Novikov, at a congress in Minsk, activists from Minsk, Gomel and Svetlogorsk joined the Federation of Anarchists of Belarus (FAB).\n\nOn October 6th , 1992, International Unemployment Day, Gomel anarchists held an unsanctioned rally, which ended in clashes with police and arrests. The same year the \"Union of the Unemployed\" was created with the participation of Gomel anarchists and agitation campaigns were organized at the city enterprises. The Anarchy newspaper, the first anarchist edition in Belarus, was published in Gomel in 1993.\n\nIn 1995 in Minsk the anti-party group \"Chyrvony Zhond\" also started its activity, which played a significant role in the development of anarchist movement in Belarus.\n\nSince the beginning of 1998, the Navinki newspaper has been published. At the beginning of 1999, as a result of the hapening campaign \"Legalize It\", the newspaper Navinki was officially registered, which had previously been published illegally. At the same time, Chyrvonyi Zhond, which originally issued Navinki, was banned in Belarus.\n\nOne of the longest and at the same time the most successful actions, conducted with the participation of Belarusian anarchists, can be considered the environmental campaign \"Viasiolka\", launched in 1998. The campaign was directed against the plans of the [[Belarusian nuclear power plant|Belarusian NPP]] construction developed by the government. With the participation of the FAB activists an independent environmental initiative Ecasupraciou was created, which took upon itself the organization of the whole campaign, to which were drawn employees of the Academy of Sciences of Belarus, interested scientists, press, as well as activists of the Russian radical environmental movement Rainbow Keepers, who had experience of such events. The newspaper Viasiolka started to be published. Its pages covered all aspects of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] and radioecology. During 1998-99 with the help of scientists several seminars were organized on the expediency of NPP construction. In summer 1998, the activists of Ekasupravu organized a \"March for Nuclear Free Belarus\" on the planned sites of the NPP construction in [[Mogilev Region|Mahiliou voblast]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anarchy in By - \u0410\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0437\u043c \u0432 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438|last=\u041a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0438\u043a|first=\u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044e\u043a|publisher=Samizdat|year=2003|isbn=|location=Minsk|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<!--Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

However, the anarchists could not move beyond local economic victories.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://politring.com/articles/25433-yuriy-glushakov-anarhisty-v-belarusi.html|title=\u0410\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b \u0432 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438|last=\u0413\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439|date=2019|work=\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0433|access-date=|url-status=live|language=Russian}}</ref>\n\n=== [[October Revolution|The October Revolution.]] ===\nThe leaders of the anarchist movement in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] and [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt]] in 1917 were born or participated in the anarchist movement in Belarus - Joseph Blakhman-Solntsev, Konstantin Akashev, Efim Yarchuk, and others. Anarchists, along with the Bolsheviks and the Left Essers, became the leading force of the October Revolution. Soon Lenin's party will even adopt the name \"communist\" from [[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkinites]]. But in order to distinguish itself from the anarchist-communists and esser-communists, [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] stresses in his name - \"Communist Bolsheviks\".\n\nIf in the central part of Russia this union was soon broken up, in German-occupied Belarus, the united front of all Soviet parties, acting in the underground, was preserved until early 1919. But then repressions - on the one hand, attracting loyal anarchist Communists to the Communist Party - on the other, the Bolsheviks managed to limit the influence of the anarchist movement. But until the early 1920s, legal and semi-legal anarchist circles were still operating in Belarus. Soon, however, the Councils of People's Self-Government, which was the dream of Peter Kropotkin's supporters, were finally turned by the party bureaucracy into its auxiliary bodies. The anarchists added to the exiles and political isolators.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u0420\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0430! \u0414\u0430 \u0437\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u044f!|last=\u0413\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439|publisher=\u0428SS|year=2015|isbn=|location=\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Anarchism in Republic Belarus ==\nThe revival of anarchism takes place already in the years of [[perestroika]]. However, in the 60-70s in Minsk, [[Gomel]] and other cities there were \"hippies,\" which can be referred to anarchist subculture with a certain degree of tension. However, there were no organizations in this case, of course.\n\nIn the spring of 1991, Gomel anarchists took part in a citywide strike, helping the workers of the \"Polespechat\" factory to join it.\n\nIn summer 1992, at the initiative of Oleg Novikov, at a congress in Minsk, activists from Minsk, Gomel and Svetlogorsk joined the Federation of Anarchists of Belarus (FAB).\n\nOn October 6th , 1992, International Unemployment Day, Gomel anarchists held an unsanctioned rally, which ended in clashes with police and arrests. The same year the \"Union of the Unemployed\" was created with the participation of Gomel anarchists and agitation campaigns were organized at the city enterprises. The Anarchy newspaper, the first anarchist edition in Belarus, was published in Gomel in 1993.\n\nIn 1995 in Minsk the anti-party group \"Chyrvony Zhond\" also started its activity, which played a significant role in the development of anarchist movement in Belarus.\n\nSince the beginning of 1998, the Navinki newspaper has been published. At the beginning of 1990, as a result of the hapening campaign \"Legalize It\", the newspaper Navinki was officially registered, which had previously been published illegally. At the same time, Chyrvonyi Zhond, which originally issued Navinki, was banned in Belarus.\n\nOne of the longest and at the same time the most successful actions, conducted with the participation of Belarusian anarchists, can be considered the environmental campaign \"Viasiolka\", launched in 1998. The campaign was directed against the plans of the [[Belarusian nuclear power plant|Belarusian NPP]] construction developed by the government. With the participation of the FAB activists an independent environmental initiative Ecasupraciou was created, which took upon itself the organization of the whole campaign, to which were drawn employees of the Academy of Sciences of Belarus, interested scientists, press, as well as activists of the Russian radical environmental movement Rainbow Keepers, who had experience of such events. The newspaper Viasiolka started to be published. Its pages covered all aspects of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] and radioecology. During 1998-99 with the help of scientists several seminars were organized on the expediency of NPP construction. In summer 1998, the activists of Ekasupravu organized a \"March for Nuclear Free Belarus\" on the planned sites of the NPP construction in [[Mogilev Region|Mahiliou voblast]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anarchy in By - \u0410\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0437\u043c \u0432 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438|last=\u041a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0438\u043a|first=\u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044e\u043a|publisher=Samizdat|year=2003|isbn=|location=Minsk|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<!--Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

Easton]] (1856\u20131915) and a group of investors. It derived its name from the [[District of Columbia]], where it was headquartered.<ref name=\"IEEE Easton\">{{cite web|title=Edward Easton|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Edward_Easton |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=January 22, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bilton|first=Lynn|title=Hail, Columbia: A fresh book at last gives Edward Easton and his Graphophone company their due|url=http://www.intertique.com/Hail%20Columbia.htm|accessdate=January 22, 2014|year=1998}}</ref> At first it had a local monopoly on sales and service of Edison [[phonograph]]s and [[phonograph cylinder]]s in Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Delaware. As was the custom of some of the regional phonograph companies, Columbia produced many commercial cylinder recordings of its own, and its catalogue of musical records in 1891 was 10 pages.\n\nColumbia's ties to Edison and the [[North American Phonograph Company]] were severed in 1894 with the [[North American Phonograph Company]]'s breakup. Thereafter it sold only records and phonographs of its own manufacture. In 1902, Columbia introduced the \"XP\" record, a molded brown wax record, to use up old stock. Columbia introduced black wax records in 1903. According to one source, they continued to mold brown waxes until 1904 with the highest number being 32601, \"Heinie\", which is a duet by [[Arthur Collins (singer)|Arthur Collins]] and [[Byron G. Harlan]]. The molded brown waxes may have been sold to [[Sears]] for distribution (possibly under Sears' Oxford trademark for Columbia products).<ref>{{cite web|last=Gracyk |first=Tim |url=http://www.gracyk.com/wax.shtml |title=Tim Gracyk's Phonographs, Singers, and Old Records - How Late Did Columbia Use Brown Wax? |publisher=Gracyk.com |date=October 11, 1904 |accessdate=December 31, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Graphophone1901.jpg|right|thumb|A Columbia type AT cylinder [[graphophone]] was produced in 1898.<ref name=\"guide\">{{cite book|last=Hazelcorn|first=Howard|title=A Collector's Guide to the Columbia Spring-Wound Cylinder Graphophone|publisher=Antique Phonograph Monthly|year=1976|edition=1|pages=10, 13}}</ref>]]\n\nColumbia began selling [[gramophone record|disc records]] (invented and patented by Victor Talking Machine Company's [[Emile Berliner]]) and phonographs in addition to the cylinder system in 1901, preceded only by their \"Toy Graphophone\" of 1899, which used small, vertically cut records. For a decade, Columbia competed with both the [[Edison Phonograph Company]] cylinders and the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] disc records as one of the top three names in American recorded sound.\n\nIn order to add prestige to its early catalog of artists, Columbia contracted a number of [[New York Metropolitan Opera]] stars to make recordings (from 1903 onward). These stars included [[Marcella Sembrich]], [[Lillian Nordica]], [[Antonio Scotti]] and [[Edouard de Reszke]], but the technical standard of their recordings was not considered to be as high as the results achieved with classical singers during the pre\u2013World War I period by Victor, Edison, England's [[His Master's Voice]] (The [[Gramophone Company]] Ltd.) or Italy's [[Fonotipia Records]]. After an abortive attempt in 1904 to manufacture discs with the recording grooves stamped into both sides of each disc\u2014not just one\u2014in 1908 Columbia commenced successful mass production of what they called their \"Double-Faced\" discs, the 10-inch variety initially selling for 65 cents apiece. The firm also introduced the internal-horn \"'''[[Graphophone|Grafonola]]'''\" to compete with the extremely popular \"[[Victrola]]\" sold by the rival Victor Talking Machine Company.\n\nDuring this era, Columbia used the \"Magic Notes\" logo\u2014a pair of sixteenth notes (semiquavers) in a circle\u2014both in the United States and overseas (where this particular logo would never substantially change).\n\n[[File:Columbia1116D.jpg|left|thumb|The American label of an electrically recorded Columbia disc by [[Art Gillham]] from the mid-twenties]]\n\nColumbia stopped recording and manufacturing wax cylinder records in 1908, after arranging to issue celluloid cylinder records made by the [[Indestructible Record Company]] of [[Albany, New York]], as \"Columbia Indestructible Records\". In July 1912, Columbia decided to concentrate exclusively on disc records and stopped manufacturing cylinder phonographs, although they continued selling Indestructible's cylinders under the Columbia name for a year or two more.\n\nColumbia was split into two companies, one to make records and one to make players. Columbia Phonograph was moved to Connecticut, and Ed Easton went with it. Eventually it was renamed the [[Dictaphone|Dictaphone Corporation]].<ref name=\"IEEE Easton\"/>\n\n[[File:Col4951A.jpg|right|thumb|The British label of an electrically recorded Columbia disc by [[Paul Whiteman]]]]\n\nIn late 1922, Columbia went into receivership.<ref name=\"New Grove\">{{cite book|last1=Rye|first1=Howard |last2=Kernfeld |first2=Barry|editor1-last=Kernfeld|editor1-first=Barry|title=The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz|date=2002|publisher=Grove's Dictionaries Inc.|location=New York|isbn=1-56159-284-6|page=172|volume=1|edition=2nd}}</ref> The company was bought by its [[Columbia Graphophone Company|English subsidiary, the Columbia Graphophone Company]] in 1925 and the label, record numbering system, and recording process changed. On February 25, 1925, Columbia began recording with the electric recording process licensed from [[Western Electric]]. \"Viva-tonal\" records set a benchmark in tone and clarity unequaled on commercial discs during the 78-rpm era. The first electrical recordings were made by [[Art Gillham]], the \"Whispering Pianist\". In a secret agreement with Victor, electrical technology was kept secret to avoid hurting sales of acoustic records.\n\nIn 1926, Columbia acquired [[Okeh Records]] and its growing stable of jazz and blues artists, including [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]]. Columbia had already built a catalog of blues and jazz artists, including [[Bessie Smith]] in their 14000-D Race series. Columbia also had a successful \"Hillbilly\" series (15000-D). In 1928, [[Paul Whiteman]], the nation's most popular orchestra leader, left Victor to record for Columbia. During the same year, Columbia executive [[Frank Buckley Walker]] pioneered some of the first country music or \"hillbilly\" genre recordings with the [[Johnson City sessions]] in Tennessee, including artists such as [[Clarence Horton Greene]] and [[Charlie Bowman|\"Fiddlin'\" Charlie Bowman]]. He followed that with a return to Tennessee the next year, as well as recording sessions in other cities of the South.\n\nIn 1929 [[Ben Selvin]] became house bandleader and A. & R. director. Other favorites in the Viva-tonal era included [[Ruth Etting]], Paul Whiteman, [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Ipana Troubadours]] (a Sam Lanin group), and [[Ted Lewis (musician)|Ted Lewis]]. Columbia used acoustic recording for \"budget label\" pop product well into 1929 on the labels Harmony, Velvet Tone (both general purpose labels), and [[Diva Records|Diva]] (sold exclusively at [[W.T. Grant]] stores). When Edison Records folded, Columbia was the oldest surviving record label.\n\n===Columbia ownership separation (1931\u20131936)===\nIn 1931, the British Columbia Graphophone Company (itself originally a subsidiary of American Columbia Records, then to become independent, actually went on to purchase its former parent, American Columbia, in late 1929) merged with the [[Gramophone Company]] to form Electric & Musical Industries Ltd. ([[EMI]]). EMI was forced to sell its American Columbia operations (because of anti-trust concerns) and the Grigsby-Grunow Company, makers of the Majestic Radio were the purchaser. But Majestic soon fell on hard times. An abortive attempt in 1932 (around the same time that Victor was experimenting with its 33{{fraction|1|3}} \"program transcriptions\") was the \"Longer Playing Record\", a finer-grooved 10\" 78 with 4:30 to 5:00 playing time per side. Columbia issued about eight of these (in the 18000-D series), as well as a short-lived series of double-grooved \"Longer Playing Record\"s on its Clarion Records, Harmony and Velvet Tone labels. All of these experiments (and indeed the Clarion, Harmony and Velvet Tone labels) were discontinued by mid-1932.\n\nA longer-lived marketing ploy was the Columbia \"Royal Blue Record,\" a brilliant blue laminated product with matching label. Royal Blue issues, made from late 1932 through 1935, are particularly popular with collectors for their rarity and musical interest. The Columbia plant in Oakland, California, did Columbia's pressings for sale west of the Rockies and continued using the Royal Blue material for these until about mid-1936.\n\nWith the Great Depression's tightened economic stranglehold on the country, in a day when the phonograph itself had become a luxury, nothing slowed Columbia's decline. It was still producing some of the most remarkable records of the day, especially on sessions produced by [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] and financed by EMI for overseas release. Grigsby-Grunow went under in 1934 and was forced to sell Columbia for a mere $70,000 to the [[American Record Corporation]] (ARC).<ref name=\"Hoffman2004\">{{cite book|author=Frank Hoffman|title=Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xV6tghvO0oMC&pg=PA212|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=August 21, 2004|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-203-48427-2|page=212}}</ref> This combine already included [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] as its premium label so Columbia was relegated to slower sellers such as the Hawaiian music of [[Andy Iona]], the [[Irving Mills]] stable of artists and songs, and the still unknown [[Benny Goodman]]. By late 1936, pop releases were discontinued, leaving the label essentially defunct.\n\nIn 1935, Herbert M. Greenspon, an 18-year-old shipping clerk, led a committee to organize the first trade union shop at the main manufacturing factory in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Elected as president of the Congress of Industrial Unions (CIO) local, Greenspon negotiated the first contract between factory workers and Columbia management. In a career with Columbia that lasted 30 years, Greenspon retired after achieving the position of executive vice president of the company.

Most fortuitously for Columbia in its Depression Era financial woes, in 1936 the company entered into an exclusive recording contract with the [[Chuck Wagon Gang]], a hugely successful relationship which continued into the 1970s. A signature group of southern gospel, the Chuck Wagon Gang became Columbia's bestsellers with at least 37 million records,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcenter.org/Home/News/Concerts/ChuckWagonGang.asp |title=Solid Gospel series brings Chuck Wagon Gang to Renaissance Center. |publisher= |accessdate=November 8, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810135439/http://www.rcenter.org/Home/News/Concerts/ChuckWagonGang.asp |archivedate=August 10, 2012}}</ref> many of them through the aegis of the ''Mull Singing Convention of the Air'' sponsored on radio (and later television) by southern gospel broadcaster [[J. Bazzel Mull]] (1914\u20132006).\n\nAnother event in this period that would prove to be of importance to Columbia was the 1937 hiring of talent scout, music writer, producer, and impresario John Hammond. Alongside his significance as a discoverer, promoter, and producer of jazz, blues, and folk artists during the [[swing music]] era, Hammond had already been of great help to Columbia in 1932\u201333. Through his involvement in the UK music paper ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Hammond had arranged for the struggling US Columbia label to provide recordings for the UK Columbia label, mostly using the specially created Columbia W-265000 matrix series. Hammond recorded [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Benny Carter]], [[Joe Venuti]], [[Roger Wolfe Kahn]] and other jazz performers during a time when the economy was bad enough that many of them would not have had the opportunity to enter a studio and play real jazz (a handful of these in this special series were issued in the US). Hammond's work for Columbia was interrupted by his service during World War II, and he had less involvement with the music scene during the [[bebop]] era, but when he returned to work as a talent scout for Columbia in the 1950s, his career proved to be of incalculable historical and cultural importance - the list of superstar artists he would discover and sign to Columbia over the course of his career included [[Charlie Christian]], [[Count Basie]], [[Teddy Wilson]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and in the early 1960s Hammond would also exert an enormous cultural effect on the emerging rock music scene thanks to his championing of reissue LPs of the music of blues artists [[Robert Johnson]] and [[Bessie Smith]].\n\n===CBS takes over (1938\u20131947)===\n[[File:notesandmike.jpg|thumbnail|125px|left|Columbia \"notes and mic\" logo]]\n\nIn 1938 ARC, including the Columbia label in the US, was bought by [[William S.

The Royal Blue labels now disappeared in favor of a deep red, which caused [[RCA Victor]] to claim infringement on its [[RCA Red Seal Records|Red Seal]] trademark (RCA lost the case). The blue Columbia label was kept for its [[European classical music|classical music]] [[Columbia Masterworks Records]] line until it was later changed to a green label before switching to a gray label in the late 1950s, and then to the bronze that is familiar to owners of its classical and Broadway albums.

He set his talents to his goal of hearing an entire movement of a symphony on one side of an album. Ward Botsford writing for the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Issue of ''High Fidelity Magazine'' relates, \"He was no inventor\u2014he was simply a man who seized an idea whose time was ripe and begged, ordered, and cajoled a thousand men into bringing into being the now accepted medium of the record business.\" Despite Wallerstein's stormy tenure, in June 1948, Columbia introduced the Long Playing \"microgroove\" [[LP record]] format (sometimes written \"Lp\" in early advertisements), which rotated at 33\u2153 [[revolutions per minute]], to be the standard for the gramophone record for half a century. CBS research director Dr. [[Peter Carl Goldmark|Peter Goldmark]] played a managerial role in the collaborative effort, but Wallerstein credits engineer [[William Savory]] with the technical prowess that brought the long-playing disc to the public.<ref name=\"catalog1949\">{{cite book|title=Columbia Record Catalog 1949|publisher=Columbia Records Inc.|pages=1\u201320}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 1940s, Columbia had been experimenting with higher fidelity recordings, as well as longer masters, which paved the way for the successful release of the LPs in 1948. One such record that helped set a new standard for music listeners was the 10\" LP reissue of ''[[The Voice of Frank Sinatra]]'', originally released on March 4, 1946 as an album of four 78 rpm records, which was the first pop album issued in the new LP format. [[Sinatra]] was arguably Columbia's hottest commodity and his artistic vision combined with the direction Columbia were taking the medium of music, both popular and classic, were well suited. ''The Voice of Frank Sinatra'' was also considered to be the first genuine ''[[concept album]]''. Since the term \"LP\" has come to refer to the 12-inch {{frac|33|1|3}} rpm vinyl disk, the first LP is the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto in E minor played by Nathan Milstein with Bruno Walter conducting the New York Philharmonic (then called the Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra of New York), Columbia ML 4001, found in the Columbia Record Catalog for 1949, published in July 1948. The other \"LP's\" listed in the catalog were in the 10 inch format starting with ML 2001 for the light classics, CL 6001 for popular songs and JL 8001 for children's records.<ref name=\"catalog1949\"/> The Library of Congress (Washington DC) now holds the Columbia Records Paperwork Archive which shows the Label order for ML 4001 being written on March 1, 1948. One can infer that Columbia was pressing the first LPs for distribution to their dealers for at least 3 months prior to the introduction of the LP in June 1948.<ref>Library of Congress Columbia Records Paperwork Box 121</ref> The catalog numbering system has had minor changes ever since.\n\nColumbia's LPs were particularly well-suited to classical music's longer pieces, so some of the early albums featured such artists as [[Eugene Ormandy]] and the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], [[Bruno Walter]] and the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], and [[Sir Thomas Beecham]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]]. The success of these recordings eventually persuaded [[Capitol Records]] to begin releasing LPs in 1949. Even before the LP record was officially demonstrated, Columbia offered to share the new speed with rival  RCA Victor, who initially rejected it and soon introduced their new competitive 45 RPM record. When it became clear that the LP was the preferred format for classical recordings, RCA Victor announced that the company would begin releasing its own LPs in January, 1950. This was quickly followed by the other major American labels. [[Decca Records]] in the U.K. was the first to release LPs in Europe, beginning in 1949. EMI would not fully adopt the LP format until 1955.\n\nAn \"original cast recording\" of [[Rodgers & Hammerstein]]'s ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' with [[Ezio Pinza]] and [[Mary Martin]] was recorded in 1949. Both conventional metal masters and tape were used in the sessions in New York City. For some reason, the taped version was not used until Sony released it as part of a set of CDs devoted to Columbia's Broadway albums.<ref>Sony liner notes</ref>  Over the years, Columbia joined Decca and RCA Victor in specializing in albums devoted to Broadway musicals with members of the original casts. In the 1950s, Columbia also began releasing LPs drawn from the soundtracks of popular films.\n\nMany album covers put together by Columbia and the other major labels were put together using one piece of cardboard (folded in half) and two paper \"slicks,\" one for the front and one for the back. The front slick bent around the top, bottom, and left sides (the right side is open for the record to be inserted into the cover) and glued the two halves of cardboard together at the top and bottom. The back slick is pasted over the edges of the pasted-on front slick to make it appear that the album cover is one continuous piece.\n\nColumbia discovered that printing two front cover slicks, one for mono and one for stereo, was inefficient and therefore needlessly costly. Starting in the summer of 1959 with some of the albums released in August, they went to the \"paste-over\" front slick, which had the stereo information printed on the top and the mono information printed on the bottom. For stereo issues, they moved the front slick down so the stereo information was showing at the top, and the mono information was bent around the bottom to the back and \"pasted over\" by the back slick. Conversely, for a mono album, they moved the slick up so the mono information showed at the bottom, and the stereo information was pasted over.\n\n===The 1950s===\n[[File:ATeenageLoveAffair.JPG|thumbnail|left|Columbia used this label for its 45 r.p.m. records from 1951 until 1958.]]\n\nIn 1951, Columbia US began issuing records in the 45 rpm format RCA Victor had introduced two years earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubby.net/worldofcubby/RCR/record_history.html |title=Record Collector's Resource: A History of Records |publisher=Cubby.net |date=February 26, 1917 |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref> The same year, Ted Wallerstein retired as Columbia Records chairman;<ref name=\"Inc.1970\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=September 26, 1970|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=10|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> and Columbia US also severed its decades-long distribution arrangement with EMI and signed a distribution deal with [[Philips Records]] to market Columbia recordings outside North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/bbe12043 |title=Mitch Miller And His Orchestra And Chorus - Mitch Miller - Philips - UK |publisher=45cat |date= |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref> EMI continued to distribute Okeh and later Epic label recordings until 1968.

Columbia continued to use the \"notes and mike\" logo on record labels and even used a promo label showing both logos until the \"notes and mike\" was phased out (along with the 78 in the US) in 1958. In Canada, Columbia 78s were pressed with the \"Walking Eye\" logo in 1958.

Under new head producer [[George Avakian]], Columbia became the most vital label to the general public's appreciation and understanding (with help from Avakian's prolific and perceptive play-by-play liner notes) of America's indigenous art, releasing the most important LP's by the music's founding father, [[Louis Armstrong]], but also signing to long-term contracts  [[Dave Brubeck]] and [[Miles Davis]], the two modern jazz artists who would in 1959 record albums that remain\u2014more than a half century later\u2014among the best-selling jazz albums by any label\u2014viz., ''[[Time Out (album)|Time Out]]'' by the Brubeck Quartet and, to an even greater extent, ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' by the Davis Sextet, which, in 2003, appeared as number 12 in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'s'' list of the \"500 Greatest Albums Of All Time\".<ref>{{cite magazine| url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/kind-of-blue-miles-davis-19691231| title = Kind of Blue\n| date = February 9, 2003| accessdate = April 11, 2012| magazine = Rollingstone.com}}</ref> With another producer, [[Teo Macero]], a skilled modernist composer himself, Columbia cemented contracts with jazz giants [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Charles Mingus]], while Macero became a key agent in recording and representing\u2014through attention-grabbing, colorful\u2014albums the protean faces of Miles Davis\u2014from leading exponent of [[cool jazz]] and an explorer of the art of [[modal jazz]] through his sextet's 1958 album ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'' to innovator and avatar of the marriage of jazz with rock and electronic sounds\u2014commonly known as [[jazz fusion]].\n\n1954 was the eventful year of Columbia's embracing small-group modern jazz\u2014first, in the signing of the Dave Brubeck Quartet, which resulted in the release of the on-location, best-selling jazz album (up to this time), ''[[Jazz Goes to College]]''. Contemporaneously with Columbia's first release of modern jazz by a small group, which was also the Brubeck Quartet's debut on the label, was a [[Time Magazine]] cover story on the phenomenon of Brubeck's success on college campuses. The humble [[Dave Brubeck]] demurred, saying that the second [[Time Magazine]] cover story on a jazz musician (the first featured [[Louis Armstrong]]'s picture) had been earned by [[Duke Ellington]], not himself. Within two years Ellington's picture would appear on the cover of [[Time Magazine]], following his \"wild\" success at the 1956 Newport Jazz Festival. [[Ellington at Newport]], recorded on Columbia, was also the bandleader-composer-pianist's best-selling album. Moreover, this exclusive trinity of jazz giants featured on [[Time Magazine]] were all Columbia artists. (In the early 1960s Columbia jazz artist [[Thelonious Monk]] would be afforded the same honor.)\n\nColumbia changed distributors in Australia and New Zealand in 1956 when the Australian Record Company picked up distribution of U.S. Columbia product to replace the [[Capitol Records]] product which ARC lost when EMI bought Capitol. As EMI owned the Columbia trademark at that time, the U.S. Columbia material was issued in Australia and New Zealand on the [[Coronet Records|CBS Coronet]] label.\n\nIn the same year, former Columbia A&R manager [[Goddard Lieberson]] was promoted to President of the entire CBS recording division, which included Columbia and Epic, as well as the company's various international divisions and licensees. Under his leadership the corporation's music division soon overtook [[RCA Victor]] as the top recording company in the world, boasting a star-studded roster of artists and an unmatched catalogue of popular, jazz, classical and stage and screen soundtrack titles. Lieberson, who had joined Columbia as an A&R manager in 1938, was noted for both his personal elegance and his dedication to quality, overseeing the release of many hugely successful albums and singles, as well as championing prestige releases that sold relatively poorly, and even some titles that had very limited appeal, such as complete editions of the works of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Anton von Webern]]. One of his first major successes was the original cast soundtrack of ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', which sold over 5 million copies worldwide in 1957, becoming the most successful LP ever released up to that time. Lieberson also convinced long-serving CBS President William S. Paley to become the sole backer of the original Broadway production, a $500,000 investment which subsequently earned the company some $32 million in profits.<ref>Dannen, Frederic, ''Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside The Music Business'', Vintage Books, 1991 ({{ISBN|0099813106}}), pp. 60-61</ref>\n\nIn October 1958, Columbia, in time for the Christmas season, put out a series of \"Greatest Hits\" packages by such artists as Johnny Mathis, Doris Day, Guy Mitchell, Johnnie Ray, [[Jo Stafford]], Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney, Frankie Laine and [[the Four Lads]]; months later, it put out another Mathis compilation as well as that of [[Marty Robbins]]. Only Mathis' compilations charted, since there were only 25 positions on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'''s album charts]] at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1200.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 14 (CL 1200-1299) 1958-1959|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> However, the compilations were so successful that they led to Columbia doing such packages on a widespread basis, usually when an artist's career was in decline.\n\n====Stereo====\n\nAlthough Columbia began recording in stereo in 1956, stereo LPs did not begin to be manufactured until 1958. One of Columbia's first stereo releases was an abridged and re-structured performance of [[Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (oratorio)|Messiah]]'' by the [[New York Philharmonic]] and the [[Westminster Choir]] conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]] (recorded on December 31, 1956, on {{1/2}}-inch tape, using an Ampex 300-3 machine). Bernstein combined the Nativity and Resurrection sections, and ended the performance with the death of Christ. As with RCA Victor, most of the early stereo recordings were of classical artists, including the New York Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by [[Bruno Walter]], [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]], and [[Leonard Bernstein]], and the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by [[Eugene Ormandy]], who also recorded an abridged ''Messiah'' for Columbia. Some sessions were made with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, an ensemble drawn from leading New York musicians, which had first made recordings with Sir Thomas Beecham in 1949 in Columbia's famous New York City studios. [[George Szell]] and the [[Cleveland Orchestra]] recorded mostly for Epic. When Epic dropped classical music, the roster and catalogue was moved to [[Columbia Masterworks Records]].\n\nColumbia released its first pop stereo albums in the summer of 1958. All of the first dozen or so were stereo versions of albums already available in mono. It wasn't until September 1958, that Columbia started simultaneous mono/stereo releases. Mono records sold to the general public were subsequently discontinued in 1968. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the introduction of the LP, in 1958 Columbia initiated the \"Adventures in Sound\" series that showcased music from around the world.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Billboard|date=January 6, 1958|title=Columbia's 1958 Tee-Off Cues Big Product Campaign: Program Set to Tie in with LP Disk's 10th Anniversary Year|url=|journal=Billboard|volume=|page=15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Designed for Hi-Fi Living : The Vinyl LP in Midcentury America|last=Borgerson|first=Janet|publisher=MIT Press|others=Schroeder, Jonathan E., 1962|year=2017|isbn=9780262036238|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=283\u2013297|oclc=958205262}}</ref>\n\nAs far as the catalog numbering system went, there was no correlation between mono and stereo versions for the first few years. Columbia started a new CS 8000 series for pop stereo releases, and figuring the stereo releases as some sort of specialty niche records, didn't bother to link the mono and stereo numbers for two years. Masterworks classical LPs had an MS 6000 series, while showtunes albums on Masterworks were OS 2000. Finally, in 1960, the pop stereo series jumped from 8300 to 8310 to match ''Lambert, Hendricks & Ross Sing [[Duke Ellington|Ellington]]'', the [[Lambert, Hendricks & Ross]] album issued as CL-1510. From that point, the stereo numbers on pop albums were exactly 6800 higher than the mono; stereo classical albums were the mono number plus 600; and showtunes releases were the mono number MINUS 3600. Only the last two digits in the respective catalog series' matched.\n\nPop stereo LPs got into the high 9000s by 1970, when CBS Records revamped and unified its catalog numbering system across all its labels. Masterworks classical albums were in the 7000s, while showtunes stayed in the low 2000s.\n\n===The 1960s===\n====Outing of \"deep groove\"====\nBy the latter half of 1961, Columbia started using pressing plants with newer equipment. The \"deep groove\" pressings were made on older pressing machines, where the groove was an artifact of the metal stamper being affixed to a round center \"block\" to assure the resulting record would be centered. Newer machines used parts with a slightly different geometry, that only left a small \"ledge\" where the deep groove used to be. This changeover did not happen all at once, as different plants replaced machines at different times, leaving the possibility that both deep groove and ledge varieties could be original pressings. The changeover took place starting in late 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1600.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 12 (CL 1600-1699/CS 8400-8499) 1961-1962|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====CBS Records====\n{{see also|CBS Records International}}\n[[File:CBSRecords.png|thumbnail|125px|right|CBS Records logo outside of the United States]]\n\nIn 1961, CBS ended its arrangement with Philips Records and formed its own international organization, CBS Records, in 1962, which released Columbia recordings outside the US and Canada on the CBS label (until 1964 marketed by Philips in Britain).<ref name=\"Inc.1963\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media|title=Billboard|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_eQsEAAAAMBAJ|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=March 16, 1963|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_eQsEAAAAMBAJ/page/n37 40]|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> The recordings could not be released under the Columbia Records name because EMI operated a separate record label by that name, [[Columbia Graphophone Company]], outside North America. This was the result of legal maneuvers which led to the creation of EMI in the early 1930s.\n\nWhile this happened, starting in late 1961, both the mono and the stereo labels of domestic Columbia releases started carrying a small \"CBS\" at the top of the label. This was not something that changed at a certain date, but rather, pressing plants were told to use up the stock of old (pre-CBS) labels first, resulting in a mixture of labels for some given releases. Some are known with the CBS text on mono albums, and not on stereo of the same album, and vice versa; diggings brought up pressings with the CBS text on one side and not on the other. Many, but certainly not all, of the early numbers with the \"ledge\" variation (i.e., no deep groove), had the small \"CBS\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1700.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 13 (CL 1700-1799/CS 8500-8598) 1961-1962|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> This text would be used on the Columbia labels until June, 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1800.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 14 (CL 1800-1899/CS 8600-8699) 1960-1961|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\nColumbia's Mexican unit, Discos Columbia, was renamed Discos CBS.<ref name=\"Inc.1963\"/>\n\nWith the formation of [[CBS Records International]], CBS started establishing its own distribution in the early 1960s, beginning in Australia.

His early folk songs were recorded by many acts and became hits for [[Peter, Paul & Mary]] and [[The Turtles]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/celebritynews/6201418/Peter-Paul-and-Mary-Top-songs-of-all-time.html|title=Peter, Paul and Mary: Top songs of all time|last=Willis|first=Amy|date=2009-09-17|access-date=2017-12-26|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Some of these cover versions became the foundation of the [[folk rock]] genre. The Byrds achieved their pop breakthrough with a version of Dylan's \"[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]\". In 1965, Dylan's controversial decision to [[Electric Dylan controversy|'go electric']] and work with rock musicians divided his audience but catapulted him to greater commercial success with his 1965 hit single \"[[Like a Rolling Stone]]\". Following his withdrawal from touring in 1966, Dylan recorded a large group of songs with his backing group [[The Band]] which reached other artists as 'demo recordings'. These resulted in hits by [[Manfred Mann]] (\"[[Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)|The Mighty Quinn]]\") and [[Brian Auger]], [[Julie Driscoll]] & Trinity (\"[[This Wheel's On Fire]]\"). Dylan's late 1960s albums ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]'' and ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' became cornerstone recordings of the emergent [[country rock]] genre and influenced The Byrds and [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]].\n\n====Converting mono====\nColumbia's engineering department developed a process for emulating stereo from a mono source. They called this process \"Electronically Rechanneled for Stereo\". In the June 16, 1962, issue of ''Billboard'' magazine (page 5), Columbia announced it would issue \"rechanneled\" versions of greatest hits compilations that had been recorded in mono, including albums by Doris Day, Frankie Laine, Percy Faith, Mitch Miller, Marty Robbins, Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis, and Johnny Mathis.\n\nColumbia's rechanneling process involved a slight time delay and some bass-treble separation between channels. RCA Victor and Capitol (\"[[Duophonic]]\") used similar processes, but the relatively large delay between channels resulted in a sound that has been described by collectors as \"messy\" (Duophonic) or \"garbage can echo\" (RCA Victor). Columbia's rechanneling resulted in a sound similar to reverb, though some found it annoying.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n====Rock and roll====\nWhen the [[British Invasion]] arrived in January 1964, Columbia had no rock musicians on its roster except for [[Dion DiMucci|Dion]], who was signed in 1963 as the label's first major rock star, and [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]] who were also signed in 1963. The label released a [[merseybeat]] album, ''The Exciting New Liverpool Sound'' (Columbia CL-2172, issued in mono only). [[Terry Melcher]], son of Doris Day, produced the hard driving \"Don't Make My Baby Blue\" for Frankie Laine, who had gone six years without a hit record. The song reached No. 51 on the pop chart and No. 17 on the easy listening chart.\n\nMelcher and [[Bruce Johnston]] discovered and brought to Columbia [[The Rip Chords]], a vocal group consisting of Ernie Bringas and Phil Stewart, and turned it into a rock group through production techniques. The group had hits in \"Here I Stand\", a remake of the song by [[Wade Flemons]], and \"[[Hey Little Cobra]]\". Columbia saw the two recordings as a start to getting into rock and roll. Melcher and Johnston recorded several additional singles for Columbia in 1964 as \"Bruce & Terry\" and later as \"The Rogues\". Melcher produced early albums by [[The Byrds]] and Paul Revere & the Raiders for Columbia while Johnston produced [[The Beach Boys]] for [[Capitol Records]].\n\n====Ascension of Clive Davis====\nWhen Mitch Miller retired in 1965,<ref name=\"Inc.1965\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7iIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA3|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=December 11, 1965|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=3|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> Columbia was at a turning point. Miller's disdain for rock and roll and pop rock had dominated Columbia's A&R policy. The label's only significant \"pop\" acts at the time were Bob Dylan, The Byrds, Paul Revere & The Raiders and [[Simon & Garfunkel]]. In its catalogue were other genres: classical, jazz and country, along with a select group of R&B artists, among them [[Aretha Franklin]].<ref name=\"bsn17\" /> Most historians noted that Columbia had problems marketing Franklin as a major talent in the R&B genre, which led to her leaving the label for [[Atlantic Records]] in 1967.<ref>{{Gilliland|https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1|Show 52 \u2013 The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

Sales of Broadway soundtracks and Mitch Miller's singalong series were waning. Pretax earnings had flattened to about $5 million annually.<ref name=\"hitmen\" /> Following the appointment of Davis, the Columbia label became more of a rock music label, thanks mainly to Davis's fortuitous decision to attend the [[Monterey International Pop Festival]], where he spotted and signed several leading acts including [[Janis Joplin]]. Joplin led the way for several generations of female rock and rollers. However, Columbia/CBS still had a hand in traditional pop and jazz and one of its key acquisitions during this period was [[Barbra Streisand]]. She released her first solo album on Columbia in 1963 and remains with the label to this day. Additionally, the label kept \nMiles Davis on the roster, and his late 1960s recordings, ''[[In a Silent Way]]'' and ''[[Bitches Brew]]'', pioneered a [[Jazz fusion|fusion of jazz and rock music]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/bitches-brew-r106167/review| title = Bitches Brew| author = Jurek, Thom| accessdate = April 11, 2012| publisher = Allmusic.com}}</ref>\n\nA San Francisco group called [[Moby Grape]] had been gaining popularity on the West Coast, and were signed by Davis in 1967. As a way of introducing them to the world with a splash, they released [[Moby Grape (album)|their debut album]], along with five singles from the album, all on the same day, June 6, 1967, 23 years following [[D-Day]]. The album hit made #24 on the [[Billboard 200]], but the singles barely made a dent in the charts, the best performer being \"Omaha,\" which lasted a mere three weeks on the Hot 100 reaching only No. 88. The other charter, \"Hey Grandma,\" only reached the Bubbling Under chart and faded within a week. Also, there were some complaints about the obscene gesture made to the American flag on the front cover that had to be edited out on the second pressing, not to mention that the group started to decline in sales after that. The return on all the promotional budget for the singles realized nothing. Although the group made two more albums, this particular publicity stunt was never again attempted by Columbia or any other major label.\n\n====Simon & Garfunkel====\nArguably the most commercially successful Columbia pop act of this period, other than Bob Dylan, was Simon & Garfunkel. The duo scored a surprise No. 1 hit in 1965 when CBS producer [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]], inspired by the folk-rock experiments of The Byrds and others, added drums and bass to the duo's earlier recording of \"[[The Sound of Silence]]\" without their knowledge or approval. Indeed, the duo had already broken up some months earlier, discouraged by the poor sales of their debut LP, and [[Paul Simon]] had relocated to the UK, where he famously only found out about the single being a hit via the music press. The dramatic success of the song prompted Simon to return to the US; the duo reformed, and they soon became one of the flagship acts of the [[folk-rock]] boom of the mid-1960s. Their next album, ''[[Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme]]'', went to No. 4 on the ''Billboard'' album chart. The duo subsequently had a Top 20 single, \"[[A Hazy Shade of Winter]]\", but progress slowed during 1966-67 as Simon struggled with writer's block and the demands of constant touring. They shot back to the top in 1968 after Simon agreed to write songs for the [[Mike Nichols]] film ''[[The Graduate]]''. The resulting single, \"[[Mrs. Robinson]]\", became a smash hit. Both ''The Graduate'' soundtrack and Simon & Garfunkel's next studio album, ''[[Bookends (album)|Bookends]]'', were major hits on the album chart, with combined total sales in excess of five million copies. Simon and Garfunkel's fifth and final studio album, ''[[Bridge over Troubled Water]]'' (1970), reached number one in the US album charts in January 1970 and became one of the most successful albums of all time.<ref name=\"bridge\">{{cite web|last1=Eder|first1=Bruce|title=Bridge Over Troubled Water|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bridge-over-troubled-water-mw0000191730|website=AllMusic|accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Hoyt Axton and Tom Rush====\nDavis lured artists [[Hoyt Axton]] and [[Tom Rush]] to Columbia in 1969, and both were given what was known as \"the pop treatment\" by the label. Hoyt Axton had been a folk/blues singer-songwriter since the early 1960s, when he made several albums for [[Horizon Records|Horizon]], then [[Vee-Jay Records|Vee-Jay]]. By the time he joined Columbia, he had mixed successful pop songs like \"[[Greenback Dollar]],\" with hard rock songs for [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], such as \"[[The Pusher]]\", which was used in the film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' in the same year. When he landed at Columbia, his album ''My Griffin Is Gone'' was described as \"the poster child for 'overproduced,' full of all kinds of instruments and even strings\".<ref name=\"bsn27\">{{cite web|last1=Watts|first1=Randy|last2=Callahan|first2=Mike|last3=Edwards|first3=David|last4=Eyries|first4=Patrice|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 27 (K)CS 9000-9999 (1969-1970)|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia3100.html|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}</ref> After that album, Axton left and joined Capitol Records, where his next albums contained \"[[Joy to the World (Three Dog Night song)|Joy to the World]]\" and \"[[Never Been to Spain]],\" which became hits for [[Three Dog Night]] on [[Dunhill Records|Dunhill]]. Axton eventually became a country singer, and founded his own record label, Jeremiah.\n\nTom Rush had always been the \"storyteller\" or \"balladeer\" type of folk artist, before and after his stint with Columbia, to which Rush was lured from [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]. As with Axton, Rush was given \"the treatment\" on [[Tom Rush (1970 album)|his self-titled Columbia debut]]. The multitude of instruments added to his usual solo guitar were all done \"tastefully\", of course, but was not really on par with Rush's audience expectations. He commented to record label historian Mike Callahan: {{cquote|Well, when you're in the studio, they bring out all these \"sweeteners\" and things they have, and while you're there, you say, yeah, that sounds good. But then you get the album home and you almost can't hear yourself under all that.<ref name=\"bsn27\" />}} Eventually, Rush returned to his usual sound (which he applied to his [[Wrong End of the Rainbow|next]] [[Merrimack County (album)|three]] [[Ladies Love Outlaws (Tom Rush album)|albums]] for Columbia) and has been playing to appreciative audiences ever since.\n\n===The 1970s===\n====Catalog numbers====\nThe Columbia album series began in 1951 with album GL-500 (CL-500) and reached an awkward milestone in 1970, when the stereo numbering sequence reached CS-9999, assigned to the [[Patti Page]] album ''Honey Come Back''. This presented a catalog numbering system challenge as Columbia had used a four-digit catalog number for 13 years, and CS-10000 seemed cumbersome. Columbia decided to start issuing albums at CS-1000 instead, preserving the four-digit catalog number. However, this resulted in the reuse of numbers previously used in 1957-58, although the prefix was now different. In July, 1970, the cataloging department implemented a new system, combining all their labels into a unified catalog numbering system starting with 30000, with the prefix letter indicating the label: C=Columbia, E=[[Epic Records|Epic]], M=[[Columbia Masterworks]], Y=[[Odyssey Records|Columbia Odyssey]], and Z=every other label that CBS distributed.  The prefix letter G was also used for two album sets\u2014or the number of records in the set after the label letter, such as KC2).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaldogproductions.info/c/cbs-lps-us.html|title=CBS LPs - US unified numbering system|website=Globaldogproductions.info|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> The first CBS album released under the new system was [[Elvin Bishop|The Elvin Bishop Group]]'s self-titled album on Fillmore Records, assigned with 30001, while the first actual Columbia release under the system was [[Herschel Bernardi]]'s ''Show Stopper'', assigned with C 30004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaldogproductions.info/c/cbs-us-30000-30499.html|title=LP Discography for CBS Records US combined numbering system 30000-30499|website=Globaldogproductions.info|accessdate=May 5, 2019}}</ref> The highest catalog number released in the old system was CS-1069, assigned to ''[[Sesame Street discography|The Sesame Street Book and Record]]''. Chronologically, Columbia issued at least one album in this series in August, but by that time, the CBS Consolidated 30000 series, which started issuing albums in July with the new label design, was well underway, having issued nearly 100 albums. The system was later expanded with even more prefix letters, which continued until 2005.\n\n====Quadraphonics====\nIn September 1970, under the guidance of [[Clive Davis]], Columbia Records entered the West Coast rock market, opening a state-of-the art recording studio (which was located at 827 Folsom St. in San Francisco and later morphed into the [[Automatt]]) and establishing an A&R head and office in San Francisco at [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman's Wharf]], headed by [[George Daly (Music Industry)|George Daly]], a producer and artist for [[Monument Records]] (who inked a distribution deal with Columbia at the time) and a former bandmate of [[Nils Lofgren]] and [[Roy Buchanan]]. The recording studio operated under CBS until 1978.<ref>{{cite book |title=If These Halls Could Talk: A Historical Tour Through San Francisco Recording Studios |url=https://archive.org/details/ifthesehallscoul00heat |url-access=registration |last=Johnson |first=Heather |publisher=Thomson Course Technology |year=2006 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ifthesehallscoul00heat/page/n104 90]\u201394 |isbn=1-59863-141-1}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early 1970s, Columbia began recording in a four-channel process called [[quadraphonic]], using the \"SQ\" (Stereo Quadraphonic) standard that used an electronic encoding process that could be decoded by special amplifiers and then played through four speakers, with each speaker placed in the corner of a room. Remarkably, RCA countered with another quadraphonic process that required a special cartridge to play the \"discrete\" recordings for four-channel playback. Both Columbia and RCA's quadraphonic records could be played on conventional stereo equipment. Although the Columbia process required less equipment and was quite effective, many were confused by the competing systems and sales of both Columbia's matrix recordings and RCA's discrete recordings were disappointing. A few other companies also issued some matrix recordings for a few years. Quadraphonic recording was used by both classical artists, including [[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Pierre Boulez]], and popular artists such as [[Electric Light Orchestra]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Ray Conniff]], [[Carlos Santana]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[The Clash]] and [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]]. Columbia even released a soundtrack album of the movie version of ''[[Funny Girl (film)|Funny Girl]]'' in quadraphonic. Many of these recordings were later remastered and released in Dolby surround sound on CD.\n\n====Yetnikoff becomes president====\nIn 1975, Walter Yetnikoff was promoted to become President of Columbia Records, and his vacated position as President of CBS Records International was filled by Dick Asher. At this point, according to music historian Frederic Dannen, the  shy and introverted Yetnikoff began to transform his personality, becoming (in Asher's words) \"wild, menacing, crude, and above all, very loud\". In Dannen's view, Yetnikoff was probably over-compensating for his naturally sensitive and generous personality, and that he had little hope of being recognised as a \"record man\" (someone with a musical ear and an intuitive understanding of current trends and artists' intentions) because he was tone-deaf, so he instead determined to become a \"colourful character\".<ref>Dannen, ''op cit'', p.19</ref> Yetnikoff soon became notorious for his violent temper and regular tantrums: \"He shattered glassware, spewed a mixture of Yiddish and barnyard epithets, and had people physically ejected from the CBS building.\"<ref>Dannen, ''op cit'', p.21</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Columbia Records of Canada was renamed CBS Records Canada Ltd.<ref name=ce /> The Columbia label continued to be used by CBS Canada, but the CBS label was introduced for [[French language|French-language]] recordings. On May 5, 1979, Columbia Masterworks began [[digital recording]] in a recording session of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Petrouchka]]'' by the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], conducted by [[Zubin Mehta]], in New York (using [[3M]]'s 32-channel multitrack digital recorder).\n\n====Dick Asher vs \"The Network\"====\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2017}}\nCBS Records had a popular roster of musicians. It distributed [[Philadelphia International Records]], [[Blue Sky Records]], the [[Isley Brothers]]' [[T-Neck Records]] and [[Monument Records]] (from 1971 to 1976). But the music industry was in financial decline. Total sales fell by 11%, the biggest drop since World War II. In 1979 CBS had a pre-tax income of $51 million and sales of over $1 billion. The label laid off hundreds of employees.\n\nTo deal with the crisis, CEO [[John Backe]] promoted [[Dick Asher]] from Vice President of Business Affairs to Deputy President. Charged with cutting costs and restoring profits, Asher was reportedly reluctant to take on the role. He was worried that Yetnikoff would resent his promotion. But Backe had confidence in Asher's experience. In 1972 Asher had turned the British division of CBS from loss to profit. Backe considered him to be honest and trustworthy, and he appealed to Asher's loyalty to the company. Employees at CBS thought Asher was a bore and an interloper. He cut back on expenses and on perks like limousines and restaurants. His relationship with Yetnikoff deteriorated.\n\nAsher became increasingly concerned about the huge and rapidly growing cost of hiring independent agents, who were paid to promote new singles to radio station program directors. \"Indies\" had been used by record labels for many years to promote new releases, but as he methodically delved into CBS Records' expenses, Asher was dismayed to discover that hiring these independent promoters was now costing CBS alone as much as $10 million per year. When Asher took over CBS' UK division in 1972, a freelance promoter might only charge $100 per week, but by 1979 the top American independent promoters had organized themselves into a loose collective known as \"The Network\", and their fees were now running into the tens millions of dollars per year, Music historian [[Frederic Dannen]] estimates that by 1980 the major labels were paying anywhere from to $100,000 to $300,000 ''per song'' to the \"Network\" promoters, and that it was costing the industry as whole as much as $80 million annually.\n\nDuring this period, Columbia scored a Top 40 hit with the [[Pink Floyd]] single \"[[Another Brick In The Wall]]\", and its parent album ''[[The Wall]]'' would spend four months at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' LP chart in early 1980, but few in the industry knew that Dick Asher was in fact using the single as a covert experiment to test the extent of the pernicious influence of The Network - by ''not'' paying them to promote the new Pink Floyd single. The results were immediate and deeply troubling - not one of the major radio stations in Los Angeles would program the record, despite the fact that the group was in town, performing the first seven concerts on their elaborate [[The Wall Tour (1980\u201381)|The Wall Tour]] at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] to rave reviews and sold-out crowds. Asher was already worried about the growing power of The Network, and the fact it operated entirely outside the control of the label, but he was profoundly dismayed to realize that \"The Network\" was in effect a huge [[extortion]] racket, and that the operation could well be linked to organized crime - a concern vehemently dismissed by Yetnikoff, who resolutely defended the \"indies\" and declared them to be \"mensches\". But Dick Asher now knew that The Network's real power lay in their ability to ''prevent'' records from being picked up by radio, and as an experienced media lawyer and a loyal CBS employee, he was also acutely aware that this could become a new [[payola]] scandal which had the potential to engulf the entire CBS corporation, and that the Federal Communications Commission could even revoke CBS' all-important broadcast licenses if the corporation was found to be involved in any illegality.<ref>Dannen, Frederic, ''Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside The Music Business'', Vintage Books, 1991 ({{ISBN|0099813106}}), pp. 4-27</ref>\n\n===The 1980s and sale to Sony===\n\nThe structure of US Columbia remained the same until 1980, when it spun off the classical/Broadway unit, Columbia Masterworks Records, into a separate imprint, CBS Masterworks Records.\n\nIn 1988, the CBS Records Group, including the Columbia Records unit, was acquired by [[Sony]], which re-christened the parent division [[Sony Music Entertainment]] in 1991.

For much of the 1990s, Columbia released its albums without a logo, just the \"COLUMBIA\" word mark in the [[Bodoni]] Classic Bold typeface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://columbiarecords.com/  |title=Columbia Records Online - USA |date=February 8, 1999 |accessdate=December 31, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/19990208003842/http://columbiarecords.com/ |archivedate = February 8, 1999}}</ref>  Columbia experimented with bringing back the \"Notes and Mic\" logo but without the CBS mark on the microphone.

It was used by several denominations over the next seventy years, then briefly became a radio studio in the late 1940s before being leased by CBS in 1952 and converted into a state-of-the-art recording studio. The 30th Street Studio had unique sonic characteristics, thanks to its soaring one-hundred-foot vaulted ceiling, exposed timber beams, plaster walls and unvarnished wooden floor. When Columbia took over the property, then head of A&R [[Mitch Miller]] (a musician himself) recognised its singular acoustic properties and declared that the hall was to be left \"untouched by human hands\". He posted detailed standing orders to all staff to control the maintenance and cleaning of the space, even down to the changing of light bulbs, ordering that the curtains and other fittings were never to be touched, that no painting was allowed, and especially that the wooden floor could only be swept or vacuumed, and was never under any circumstances to be mopped with water, for fear that this might alter the room's resonant and reflective properties.<ref>Milner, Greg, ''Perfecting Sound Forever: The Story of recorded Music'', Granta Books, London, 2009 ({{ISBN|978-1-84708-140-7}}), p. 149</ref> CBS never took up the option to buy the building outright and it gave up its lease and closed the studio in 1982.

As was the custom of some of the regional phonograph companies, Columbia produced many commercial cylinder recordings of its own, and its catalogue of musical records in 1891 was 10 pages.\n\nColumbia's ties to Edison and the [[North American Phonograph Company]] were severed in 1894 with the [[North American Phonograph Company]]'s breakup. Thereafter it sold only records and phonographs of its own manufacture. In 1902, Columbia introduced the \"XP\" record, a molded brown wax record, to use up old stock. Columbia introduced black wax records in 1903. According to one source, they continued to mold brown waxes until 1904 with the highest number being 32601, \"Heinie\", which is a duet by [[Arthur Collins (singer)|Arthur Collins]] and [[Byron G. Harlan]]. The molded brown waxes may have been sold to [[Sears]] for distribution (possibly under Sears' Oxford trademark for Columbia products).<ref>{{cite web|last=Gracyk |first=Tim |url=http://www.gracyk.com/wax.shtml |title=Tim Gracyk's Phonographs, Singers, and Old Records - How Late Did Columbia Use Brown Wax? |publisher=Gracyk.com |date=October 11, 1904 |accessdate=December 31, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Graphophone1901.jpg|right|thumb|A Columbia type AT cylinder [[graphophone]] was produced in 1898.<ref name=\"guide\">{{cite book|last=Hazelcorn|first=Howard|title=A Collector's Guide to the Columbia Spring-Wound Cylinder Graphophone|publisher=Antique Phonograph Monthly|year=1976|edition=1|pages=10, 13}}</ref>]]\n\nColumbia began selling [[gramophone record|disc records]] (invented and patented by Victor Talking Machine Company's [[Emile Berliner]]) and phonographs in addition to the cylinder system in 1901, preceded only by their \"Toy Graphophone\" of 1899, which used small, vertically cut records. For a decade, Columbia competed with both the [[Edison Phonograph Company]] cylinders and the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] disc records as one of the top three names in American recorded sound.\n\nIn order to add prestige to its early catalog of artists, Columbia contracted a number of [[New York Metropolitan Opera]] stars to make recordings (from 1903 onward). These stars included [[Marcella Sembrich]], [[Lillian Nordica]], [[Antonio Scotti]] and [[Edouard de Reszke]], but the technical standard of their recordings was not considered to be as high as the results achieved with classical singers during the pre\u2013World War I period by Victor, Edison, England's [[His Master's Voice]] (The [[Gramophone Company]] Ltd.) or Italy's [[Fonotipia Records]]. After an abortive attempt in 1904 to manufacture discs with the recording grooves stamped into both sides of each disc\u2014not just one\u2014in 1908 Columbia commenced successful mass production of what they called their \"Double-Faced\" discs, the 10-inch variety initially selling for 65 cents apiece. The firm also introduced the internal-horn \"'''[[Graphophone|Grafonola]]'''\" to compete with the extremely popular \"[[Victrola]]\" sold by the rival Victor Talking Machine Company.\n\nDuring this era, Columbia used the \"Magic Notes\" logo\u2014a pair of sixteenth notes (semiquavers) in a circle\u2014both in the United States and overseas (where this particular logo would never substantially change).\n\n[[File:Columbia1116D.jpg|left|thumb|The American label of an electrically recorded Columbia disc by [[Art Gillham]] from the mid-twenties]]\n\nColumbia stopped recording and manufacturing wax cylinder records in 1908, after arranging to issue celluloid cylinder records made by the [[Indestructible Record Company]] of [[Albany, New York]], as \"Columbia Indestructible Records\". In July 1912, Columbia decided to concentrate exclusively on disc records and stopped manufacturing cylinder phonographs, although they continued selling Indestructible's cylinders under the Columbia name for a year or two more.\n\nColumbia was split into two companies, one to make records and one to make players. Columbia Phonograph was moved to Connecticut, and Ed Easton went with it. Eventually it was renamed the [[Dictaphone|Dictaphone Corporation]].<ref name=\"IEEE Easton\"/>\n\n[[File:Col4951A.jpg|right|thumb|The British label of an electrically recorded Columbia disc by [[Paul Whiteman]]]]\n\nIn late 1922, Columbia went into receivership.<ref name=\"New Grove\">{{cite book|last1=Rye|first1=Howard |last2=Kernfeld |first2=Barry|editor1-last=Kernfeld|editor1-first=Barry|title=The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz|date=2002|publisher=Grove's Dictionaries Inc.|location=New York|isbn=1-56159-284-6|page=172|volume=1|edition=2nd}}</ref> The company was bought by its [[Columbia Graphophone Company|English subsidiary, the Columbia Graphophone Company]] in 1925 and the label, record numbering system, and recording process changed. On February 25, 1925, Columbia began recording with the electric recording process licensed from [[Western Electric]]. \"Viva-tonal\" records set a benchmark in tone and clarity unequaled on commercial discs during the 78-rpm era. The first electrical recordings were made by [[Art Gillham]], the \"Whispering Pianist\". In a secret agreement with Victor, electrical technology was kept secret to avoid hurting sales of acoustic records.\n\nIn 1926, Columbia acquired [[Okeh Records]] and its growing stable of jazz and blues artists, including [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]]. Columbia had already built a catalog of blues and jazz artists, including [[Bessie Smith]] in their 14000-D Race series. Columbia also had a successful \"Hillbilly\" series (15000-D). In 1928, [[Paul Whiteman]], the nation's most popular orchestra leader, left Victor to record for Columbia. During the same year, Columbia executive [[Frank Buckley Walker]] pioneered some of the first country music or \"hillbilly\" genre recordings with the [[Johnson City sessions]] in Tennessee, including artists such as [[Clarence Horton Greene]] and [[Charlie Bowman|\"Fiddlin'\" Charlie Bowman]]. He followed that with a return to Tennessee the next year, as well as recording sessions in other cities of the South.\n\nIn 1929 [[Ben Selvin]] became house bandleader and A. & R. director. Other favorites in the Viva-tonal era included [[Ruth Etting]], Paul Whiteman, [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Ipana Troubadours]] (a Sam Lanin group), and [[Ted Lewis (musician)|Ted Lewis]]. Columbia used acoustic recording for \"budget label\" pop product well into 1929 on the labels Harmony, Velvet Tone (both general purpose labels), and [[Diva Records|Diva]] (sold exclusively at [[W.T. Grant]] stores). When Edison Records folded, Columbia was the oldest surviving record label.\n\n===Columbia ownership separation (1931\u20131936)===\nIn 1931, the British Columbia Graphophone Company (itself originally a subsidiary of American Columbia Records, then to become independent, actually went on to purchase its former parent, American Columbia, in late 1929) merged with the [[Gramophone Company]] to form Electric & Musical Industries Ltd. ([[EMI]]). EMI was forced to sell its American Columbia operations (because of anti-trust concerns) and the Grigsby-Grunow Company, makers of the Majestic Radio were the purchaser. But Majestic soon fell on hard times. An abortive attempt in 1932 (around the same time that Victor was experimenting with its 33{{fraction|1|3}} \"program transcriptions\") was the \"Longer Playing Record\", a finer-grooved 10\" 78 with 4:30 to 5:00 playing time per side. Columbia issued about eight of these (in the 18000-D series), as well as a short-lived series of double-grooved \"Longer Playing Record\"s on its Clarion Records, Harmony and Velvet Tone labels. All of these experiments (and indeed the Clarion, Harmony and Velvet Tone labels) were discontinued by mid-1932.\n\nA longer-lived marketing ploy was the Columbia \"Royal Blue Record,\" a brilliant blue laminated product with matching label. Royal Blue issues, made from late 1932 through 1935, are particularly popular with collectors for their rarity and musical interest. The Columbia plant in Oakland, California, did Columbia's pressings for sale west of the Rockies and continued using the Royal Blue material for these until about mid-1936.\n\nWith the Great Depression's tightened economic stranglehold on the country, in a day when the phonograph itself had become a luxury, nothing slowed Columbia's decline. It was still producing some of the most remarkable records of the day, especially on sessions produced by [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] and financed by EMI for overseas release. Grigsby-Grunow went under in 1934 and was forced to sell Columbia for a mere $70,000 to the [[American Record Corporation]] (ARC).<ref name=\"Hoffman2004\">{{cite book|author=Frank Hoffman|title=Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xV6tghvO0oMC&pg=PA212|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=August 21, 2004|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-203-48427-2|page=212}}</ref> This combine already included [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] as its premium label so Columbia was relegated to slower sellers such as the Hawaiian music of [[Andy Iona]], the [[Irving Mills]] stable of artists and songs, and the still unknown [[Benny Goodman]]. By late 1936, pop releases were discontinued, leaving the label essentially defunct.\n\nIn 1935, Herbert M. Greenspon, an 18-year-old shipping clerk, led a committee to organize the first trade union shop at the main manufacturing factory in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Elected as president of the Congress of Industrial Unions (CIO) local, Greenspon negotiated the first contract between factory workers and Columbia management. In a career with Columbia that lasted 30 years, Greenspon retired after achieving the position of executive vice president of the company.

Most fortuitously for Columbia in its Depression Era financial woes, in 1936 the company entered into an exclusive recording contract with the [[Chuck Wagon Gang]], a hugely successful relationship which continued into the 1970s. A signature group of southern gospel, the Chuck Wagon Gang became Columbia's bestsellers with at least 37 million records,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcenter.org/Home/News/Concerts/ChuckWagonGang.asp |title=Solid Gospel series brings Chuck Wagon Gang to Renaissance Center. |publisher= |accessdate=November 8, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810135439/http://www.rcenter.org/Home/News/Concerts/ChuckWagonGang.asp |archivedate=August 10, 2012}}</ref> many of them through the aegis of the ''Mull Singing Convention of the Air'' sponsored on radio (and later television) by southern gospel broadcaster [[J. Bazzel Mull]] (1914\u20132006).\n\nAnother event in this period that would prove to be of importance to Columbia was the 1937 hiring of talent scout, music writer, producer, and impresario John Hammond. Alongside his significance as a discoverer, promoter, and producer of jazz, blues, and folk artists during the [[swing music]] era, Hammond had already been of great help to Columbia in 1932\u201333. Through his involvement in the UK music paper ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Hammond had arranged for the struggling US Columbia label to provide recordings for the UK Columbia label, mostly using the specially created Columbia W-265000 matrix series. Hammond recorded [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Benny Carter]], [[Joe Venuti]], [[Roger Wolfe Kahn]] and other jazz performers during a time when the economy was bad enough that many of them would not have had the opportunity to enter a studio and play real jazz (a handful of these in this special series were issued in the US). Hammond's work for Columbia was interrupted by his service during World War II, and he had less involvement with the music scene during the [[bebop]] era, but when he returned to work as a talent scout for Columbia in the 1950s, his career proved to be of incalculable historical and cultural importance - the list of superstar artists he would discover and sign to Columbia over the course of his career included [[Charlie Christian]], [[Count Basie]], [[Teddy Wilson]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and in the early 1960s Hammond would also exert an enormous cultural effect on the emerging rock music scene thanks to his championing of reissue LPs of the music of blues artists [[Robert Johnson]] and [[Bessie Smith]].\n\n===CBS takes over (1938\u20131947)===\n[[File:notesandmike.jpg|thumbnail|125px|left|Columbia \"notes and mic\" logo]]\n\nIn 1938 ARC, including the Columbia label in the US, was bought by [[William S.

The Royal Blue labels now disappeared in favor of a deep red, which caused [[RCA Victor]] to claim infringement on its [[RCA Red Seal Records|Red Seal]] trademark (RCA lost the case). The blue Columbia label was kept for its [[European classical music|classical music]] [[Columbia Masterworks Records]] line until it was later changed to a green label before switching to a gray label in the late 1950s, and then to the bronze that is familiar to owners of its classical and Broadway albums. Columbia Phonograph Company of Canada did not survive the [[Great Depression]], so CBS made a distribution deal with [[Sparton Records]] in 1939 to release Columbia records in Canada under the Columbia name.\n\nDuring the 1940s Columbia had a contract with [[Frank Sinatra]]. Sinatra helped boost Columbia in revenue. Sinatra recorded over 200 songs with Columbia which include his most popular songs from his early years.

Some, like opera tenor (''sic''), Ezio Pinza, would go to Columbia...\"</ref>\n\n===The LP record (1948\u20131959)===\n\nColumbia's president Edward Wallerstein was instrumental in steering Paley towards the ARC purchase. He set his talents to his goal of hearing an entire movement of a symphony on one side of an album. Ward Botsford writing for the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Issue of ''High Fidelity Magazine'' relates, \"He was no inventor\u2014he was simply a man who seized an idea whose time was ripe and begged, ordered, and cajoled a thousand men into bringing into being the now accepted medium of the record business.\" Despite Wallerstein's stormy tenure, in June 1948, Columbia introduced the Long Playing \"microgroove\" [[LP record]] format (sometimes written \"Lp\" in early advertisements), which rotated at 33\u2153 [[revolutions per minute]], to be the standard for the gramophone record for half a century. CBS research director Dr. [[Peter Carl Goldmark|Peter Goldmark]] played a managerial role in the collaborative effort, but Wallerstein credits engineer [[William Savory]] with the technical prowess that brought the long-playing disc to the public.<ref name=\"catalog1949\">{{cite book|title=Columbia Record Catalog 1949|publisher=Columbia Records Inc.|pages=1\u201320}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 1940s, Columbia had been experimenting with higher fidelity recordings, as well as longer masters, which paved the way for the successful release of the LPs in 1948. One such record that helped set a new standard for music listeners was the 10\" LP reissue of ''[[The Voice of Frank Sinatra]]'', originally released on March 4, 1946 as an album of four 78 rpm records, which was the first pop album issued in the new LP format. [[Sinatra]] was arguably Columbia's hottest commodity and his artistic vision combined with the direction Columbia were taking the medium of music, both popular and classic, were well suited. ''The Voice of Frank Sinatra'' was also considered to be the first genuine ''[[concept album]]''. Since the term \"LP\" has come to refer to the 12-inch {{frac|33|1|3}} rpm vinyl disk, the first LP is the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto in E minor played by Nathan Milstein with Bruno Walter conducting the New York Philharmonic (then called the Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra of New York), Columbia ML 4001, found in the Columbia Record Catalog for 1949, published in July 1948. The other \"LP's\" listed in the catalog were in the 10 inch format starting with ML 2001 for the light classics, CL 6001 for popular songs and JL 8001 for children's records.<ref name=\"catalog1949\"/> The Library of Congress (Washington DC) now holds the Columbia Records Paperwork Archive which shows the Label order for ML 4001 being written on March 1, 1948. One can infer that Columbia was pressing the first LPs for distribution to their dealers for at least 3 months prior to the introduction of the LP in June 1948.<ref>Library of Congress Columbia Records Paperwork Box 121</ref> The catalog numbering system has had minor changes ever since.\n\nColumbia's LPs were particularly well-suited to classical music's longer pieces, so some of the early albums featured such artists as [[Eugene Ormandy]] and the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], [[Bruno Walter]] and the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], and [[Sir Thomas Beecham]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]]. The success of these recordings eventually persuaded [[Capitol Records]] to begin releasing LPs in 1949. Even before the LP record was officially demonstrated, Columbia offered to share the new speed with rival  RCA Victor, who initially rejected it and soon introduced their new competitive 45 RPM record. When it became clear that the LP was the preferred format for classical recordings, RCA Victor announced that the company would begin releasing its own LPs in January, 1950. This was quickly followed by the other major American labels. [[Decca Records]] in the U.K. was the first to release LPs in Europe, beginning in 1949. EMI would not fully adopt the LP format until 1955.\n\nAn \"original cast recording\" of [[Rodgers & Hammerstein]]'s ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' with [[Ezio Pinza]] and [[Mary Martin]] was recorded in 1949. Both conventional metal masters and tape were used in the sessions in New York City. For some reason, the taped version was not used until Sony released it as part of a set of CDs devoted to Columbia's Broadway albums.<ref>Sony liner notes</ref>  Over the years, Columbia joined Decca and RCA Victor in specializing in albums devoted to Broadway musicals with members of the original casts. In the 1950s, Columbia also began releasing LPs drawn from the soundtracks of popular films.\n\nMany album covers put together by Columbia and the other major labels were put together using one piece of cardboard (folded in half) and two paper \"slicks,\" one for the front and one for the back. The front slick bent around the top, bottom, and left sides (the right side is open for the record to be inserted into the cover) and glued the two halves of cardboard together at the top and bottom. The back slick is pasted over the edges of the pasted-on front slick to make it appear that the album cover is one continuous piece.\n\nColumbia discovered that printing two front cover slicks, one for mono and one for stereo, was inefficient and therefore needlessly costly. Starting in the summer of 1959 with some of the albums released in August, they went to the \"paste-over\" front slick, which had the stereo information printed on the top and the mono information printed on the bottom. For stereo issues, they moved the front slick down so the stereo information was showing at the top, and the mono information was bent around the bottom to the back and \"pasted over\" by the back slick. Conversely, for a mono album, they moved the slick up so the mono information showed at the bottom, and the stereo information was pasted over.\n\n===The 1950s===\n[[File:ATeenageLoveAffair.JPG|thumbnail|left|Columbia used this label for its 45 r.p.m. records from 1951 until 1958.]]\n\nIn 1951, Columbia US began issuing records in the 45 rpm format RCA Victor had introduced two years earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubby.net/worldofcubby/RCR/record_history.html |title=Record Collector's Resource: A History of Records |publisher=Cubby.net |date=February 26, 1917 |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref> The same year, Ted Wallerstein retired as Columbia Records chairman;<ref name=\"Inc.1970\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=September 26, 1970|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=10|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> and Columbia US also severed its decades-long distribution arrangement with EMI and signed a distribution deal with [[Philips Records]] to market Columbia recordings outside North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/bbe12043 |title=Mitch Miller And His Orchestra And Chorus - Mitch Miller - Philips - UK |publisher=45cat |date= |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref> EMI continued to distribute Okeh and later Epic label recordings until 1968.

Under new head producer [[George Avakian]], Columbia became the most vital label to the general public's appreciation and understanding (with help from Avakian's prolific and perceptive play-by-play liner notes) of America's indigenous art, releasing the most important LP's by the music's founding father, [[Louis Armstrong]], but also signing to long-term contracts  [[Dave Brubeck]] and [[Miles Davis]], the two modern jazz artists who would in 1959 record albums that remain\u2014more than a half century later\u2014among the best-selling jazz albums by any label\u2014viz., ''[[Time Out (album)|Time Out]]'' by the Brubeck Quartet and, to an even greater extent, ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' by the Davis Sextet, which, in 2003, appeared as number 12 in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'s'' list of the \"500 Greatest Albums Of All Time\".<ref>{{cite magazine| url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/kind-of-blue-miles-davis-19691231| title = Kind of Blue\n| date = February 9, 2003| accessdate = April 11, 2012| magazine = Rollingstone.com}}</ref> With another producer, [[Teo Macero]], a skilled modernist composer himself, Columbia cemented contracts with jazz giants [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Charles Mingus]], while Macero became a key agent in recording and representing\u2014through attention-grabbing, colorful\u2014albums the protean faces of Miles Davis\u2014from leading exponent of [[cool jazz]] and an explorer of the art of [[modal jazz]] through his sextet's 1958 album ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'' to innovator and avatar of the marriage of jazz with rock and electronic sounds\u2014commonly known as [[jazz fusion]].\n\n1954 was the eventful year of Columbia's embracing small-group modern jazz\u2014first, in the signing of the Dave Brubeck Quartet, which resulted in the release of the on-location, best-selling jazz album (up to this time), ''[[Jazz Goes to College]]''. Contemporaneously with Columbia's first release of modern jazz by a small group, which was also the Brubeck Quartet's debut on the label, was a [[Time Magazine]] cover story on the phenomenon of Brubeck's success on college campuses. The humble [[Dave Brubeck]] demurred, saying that the second [[Time Magazine]] cover story on a jazz musician (the first featured [[Louis Armstrong]]'s picture) had been earned by [[Duke Ellington]], not himself. Within two years Ellington's picture would appear on the cover of [[Time Magazine]], following his \"wild\" success at the 1956 Newport Jazz Festival. [[Ellington at Newport]], recorded on Columbia, was also the bandleader-composer-pianist's best-selling album. Moreover, this exclusive trinity of jazz giants featured on [[Time Magazine]] were all Columbia artists. (In the early 1960s Columbia jazz artist [[Thelonious Monk]] would be afforded the same honor.)\n\nColumbia changed distributors in Australia and New Zealand in 1956 when the Australian Record Company picked up distribution of U.S. Columbia product to replace the [[Capitol Records]] product which ARC lost when EMI bought Capitol. As EMI owned the Columbia trademark at that time, the U.S. Columbia material was issued in Australia and New Zealand on the [[Coronet Records|CBS Coronet]] label.\n\nIn the same year, former Columbia A&R manager [[Goddard Lieberson]] was promoted to President of the entire CBS recording division, which included Columbia and Epic, as well as the company's various international divisions and licensees. Under his leadership the corporation's music division soon overtook [[RCA Victor]] as the top recording company in the world, boasting a star-studded roster of artists and an unmatched catalogue of popular, jazz, classical and stage and screen soundtrack titles. Lieberson, who had joined Columbia as an A&R manager in 1938, was noted for both his personal elegance and his dedication to quality, overseeing the release of many hugely successful albums and singles, as well as championing prestige releases that sold relatively poorly, and even some titles that had very limited appeal, such as complete editions of the works of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Anton von Webern]]. One of his first major successes was the original cast soundtrack of ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', which sold over 5 million copies worldwide in 1957, becoming the most successful LP ever released up to that time. Lieberson also convinced long-serving CBS President William S. Paley to become the sole backer of the original Broadway production, a $500,000 investment which subsequently earned the company some $32 million in profits.<ref>Dannen, Frederic, ''Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside The Music Business'', Vintage Books, 1991 ({{ISBN|0099813106}}), pp. 60-61</ref>\n\nIn October 1958, Columbia, in time for the Christmas season, put out a series of \"Greatest Hits\" packages by such artists as Johnny Mathis, Doris Day, Guy Mitchell, Johnnie Ray, [[Jo Stafford]], Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney, Frankie Laine and [[the Four Lads]]; months later, it put out another Mathis compilation as well as that of [[Marty Robbins]]. Only Mathis' compilations charted, since there were only 25 positions on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'''s album charts]] at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1200.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 14 (CL 1200-1299) 1958-1959|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> However, the compilations were so successful that they led to Columbia doing such packages on a widespread basis, usually when an artist's career was in decline.\n\n====Stereo====\n\nAlthough Columbia began recording in stereo in 1956, stereo LPs did not begin to be manufactured until 1958. One of Columbia's first stereo releases was an abridged and re-structured performance of [[Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (oratorio)|Messiah]]'' by the [[New York Philharmonic]] and the [[Westminster Choir]] conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]] (recorded on December 31, 1956, on {{1/2}}-inch tape, using an Ampex 300-3 machine). Bernstein combined the Nativity and Resurrection sections, and ended the performance with the death of Christ. As with RCA Victor, most of the early stereo recordings were of classical artists, including the New York Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by [[Bruno Walter]], [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]], and [[Leonard Bernstein]], and the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by [[Eugene Ormandy]], who also recorded an abridged ''Messiah'' for Columbia. Some sessions were made with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, an ensemble drawn from leading New York musicians, which had first made recordings with Sir Thomas Beecham in 1949 in Columbia's famous New York City studios. [[George Szell]] and the [[Cleveland Orchestra]] recorded mostly for Epic. When Epic dropped classical music, the roster and catalogue was moved to [[Columbia Masterworks Records]].\n\nColumbia released its first pop stereo albums in the summer of 1958. All of the first dozen or so were stereo versions of albums already available in mono. It wasn't until September 1958, that Columbia started simultaneous mono/stereo releases. Mono records sold to the general public were subsequently discontinued in 1968. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the introduction of the LP, in 1958 Columbia initiated the \"Adventures in Sound\" series that showcased music from around the world.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Billboard|date=January 6, 1958|title=Columbia's 1958 Tee-Off Cues Big Product Campaign: Program Set to Tie in with LP Disk's 10th Anniversary Year|url=|journal=Billboard|volume=|page=15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Designed for Hi-Fi Living : The Vinyl LP in Midcentury America|last=Borgerson|first=Janet|publisher=MIT Press|others=Schroeder, Jonathan E., 1962|year=2017|isbn=9780262036238|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=283\u2013297|oclc=958205262}}</ref>\n\nAs far as the catalog numbering system went, there was no correlation between mono and stereo versions for the first few years. Columbia started a new CS 8000 series for pop stereo releases, and figuring the stereo releases as some sort of specialty niche records, didn't bother to link the mono and stereo numbers for two years. Masterworks classical LPs had an MS 6000 series, while showtunes albums on Masterworks were OS 2000. Finally, in 1960, the pop stereo series jumped from 8300 to 8310 to match ''Lambert, Hendricks & Ross Sing [[Duke Ellington|Ellington]]'', the [[Lambert, Hendricks & Ross]] album issued as CL-1510. From that point, the stereo numbers on pop albums were exactly 6800 higher than the mono; stereo classical albums were the mono number plus 600; and showtunes releases were the mono number MINUS 3600. Only the last two digits in the respective catalog series' matched.\n\nPop stereo LPs got into the high 9000s by 1970, when CBS Records revamped and unified its catalog numbering system across all its labels. Masterworks classical albums were in the 7000s, while showtunes stayed in the low 2000s.\n\n===The 1960s===\n====Outing of \"deep groove\"====\nBy the latter half of 1961, Columbia started using pressing plants with newer equipment. The \"deep groove\" pressings were made on older pressing machines, where the groove was an artifact of the metal stamper being affixed to a round center \"block\" to assure the resulting record would be centered. Newer machines used parts with a slightly different geometry, that only left a small \"ledge\" where the deep groove used to be. This changeover did not happen all at once, as different plants replaced machines at different times, leaving the possibility that both deep groove and ledge varieties could be original pressings. The changeover took place starting in late 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1600.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 12 (CL 1600-1699/CS 8400-8499) 1961-1962|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====CBS Records====\n{{see also|CBS Records International}}\n[[File:CBSRecords.png|thumbnail|125px|right|CBS Records logo outside of the United States]]\n\nIn 1961, CBS ended its arrangement with Philips Records and formed its own international organization, CBS Records, in 1962, which released Columbia recordings outside the US and Canada on the CBS label (until 1964 marketed by Philips in Britain).<ref name=\"Inc.1963\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media|title=Billboard|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_eQsEAAAAMBAJ|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=March 16, 1963|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_eQsEAAAAMBAJ/page/n37 40]|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> The recordings could not be released under the Columbia Records name because EMI operated a separate record label by that name, [[Columbia Graphophone Company]], outside North America.

This was not something that changed at a certain date, but rather, pressing plants were told to use up the stock of old (pre-CBS) labels first, resulting in a mixture of labels for some given releases. Some are known with the CBS text on mono albums, and not on stereo of the same album, and vice versa; diggings brought up pressings with the CBS text on one side and not on the other. Many, but certainly not all, of the early numbers with the \"ledge\" variation (i.e., no deep groove), had the small \"CBS\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1700.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 13 (CL 1700-1799/CS 8500-8598) 1961-1962|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> This text would be used on the Columbia labels until June, 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1800.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 14 (CL 1800-1899/CS 8600-8699) 1960-1961|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\nColumbia's Mexican unit, Discos Columbia, was renamed Discos CBS.<ref name=\"Inc.1963\"/>\n\nWith the formation of [[CBS Records International]], CBS started establishing its own distribution in the early 1960s, beginning in Australia. In 1960 CBS took over its distributor in Australia and New Zealand, the [[Australian Record Company]] (founded in 1936) including [[Coronet Records]], one of the leading Australian independent recording and distribution companies of the day. The CBS Coronet label was replaced by the CBS label with the 'walking eye' logo in 1963. ARC continued trading under that name until the late 1970s when it formally changed its business name to CBS Australia.\n\n====Mitch Miller on television====\nIn 1961, Columbia's music repertoire was given an enormous boost when [[Mitch Miller]], its A&R manager and bandleader, became the host of the variety series ''[[Sing Along with Mitch]]'' on NBC.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128957153|title=Remembering Singing Along With Mitch Miller|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-12-26|language=en}}</ref> The show was based on Miller's 'folksy' but appealing 'chorus' style performance of popular standards.

His early folk songs were recorded by many acts and became hits for [[Peter, Paul & Mary]] and [[The Turtles]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/celebritynews/6201418/Peter-Paul-and-Mary-Top-songs-of-all-time.html|title=Peter, Paul and Mary: Top songs of all time|last=Willis|first=Amy|date=2009-09-17|access-date=2017-12-26|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Some of these cover versions became the foundation of the [[folk rock]] genre. The Byrds achieved their pop breakthrough with a version of Dylan's \"[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]\". In 1965, Dylan's controversial decision to [[Electric Dylan controversy|'go electric']] and work with rock musicians divided his audience but catapulted him to greater commercial success with his 1965 hit single \"[[Like a Rolling Stone]]\". Following his withdrawal from touring in 1966, Dylan recorded a large group of songs with his backing group [[The Band]] which reached other artists as 'demo recordings'. These resulted in hits by [[Manfred Mann]] (\"[[Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)|The Mighty Quinn]]\") and [[Brian Auger]], [[Julie Driscoll]] & Trinity (\"[[This Wheel's On Fire]]\"). Dylan's late 1960s albums ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]'' and ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' became cornerstone recordings of the emergent [[country rock]] genre and influenced The Byrds and [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]].\n\n====Converting mono====\nColumbia's engineering department developed a process for emulating stereo from a mono source. They called this process \"Electronically Rechanneled for Stereo\". In the June 16, 1962, issue of ''Billboard'' magazine (page 5), Columbia announced it would issue \"rechanneled\" versions of greatest hits compilations that had been recorded in mono, including albums by Doris Day, Frankie Laine, Percy Faith, Mitch Miller, Marty Robbins, Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis, and Johnny Mathis.\n\nColumbia's rechanneling process involved a slight time delay and some bass-treble separation between channels. RCA Victor and Capitol (\"[[Duophonic]]\") used similar processes, but the relatively large delay between channels resulted in a sound that has been described by collectors as \"messy\" (Duophonic) or \"garbage can echo\" (RCA Victor). Columbia's rechanneling resulted in a sound similar to reverb, though some found it annoying.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n====Rock and roll====\nWhen the [[British Invasion]] arrived in January 1964, Columbia had no rock musicians on its roster except for [[Dion DiMucci|Dion]], who was signed in 1963 as the label's first major rock star, and [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]] who were also signed in 1963. The label released a [[merseybeat]] album, ''The Exciting New Liverpool Sound'' (Columbia CL-2172, issued in mono only). [[Terry Melcher]], son of Doris Day, produced the hard driving \"Don't Make My Baby Blue\" for Frankie Laine, who had gone six years without a hit record. The song reached No. 51 on the pop chart and No. 17 on the easy listening chart.\n\nMelcher and [[Bruce Johnston]] discovered and brought to Columbia [[The Rip Chords]], a vocal group consisting of Ernie Bringas and Phil Stewart, and turned it into a rock group through production techniques. The group had hits in \"Here I Stand\", a remake of the song by [[Wade Flemons]], and \"[[Hey Little Cobra]]\". Columbia saw the two recordings as a start to getting into rock and roll. Melcher and Johnston recorded several additional singles for Columbia in 1964 as \"Bruce & Terry\" and later as \"The Rogues\". Melcher produced early albums by [[The Byrds]] and Paul Revere & the Raiders for Columbia while Johnston produced [[The Beach Boys]] for [[Capitol Records]].\n\n====Ascension of Clive Davis====\nWhen Mitch Miller retired in 1965,<ref name=\"Inc.1965\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7iIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA3|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=December 11, 1965|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=3|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> Columbia was at a turning point. Miller's disdain for rock and roll and pop rock had dominated Columbia's A&R policy. The label's only significant \"pop\" acts at the time were Bob Dylan, The Byrds, Paul Revere & The Raiders and [[Simon & Garfunkel]]. In its catalogue were other genres: classical, jazz and country, along with a select group of R&B artists, among them [[Aretha Franklin]].<ref name=\"bsn17\" /> Most historians noted that Columbia had problems marketing Franklin as a major talent in the R&B genre, which led to her leaving the label for [[Atlantic Records]] in 1967.<ref>{{Gilliland|https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1|Show 52 \u2013 The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

Sales of Broadway soundtracks and Mitch Miller's singalong series were waning. Pretax earnings had flattened to about $5 million annually.<ref name=\"hitmen\" /> Following the appointment of Davis, the Columbia label became more of a rock music label, thanks mainly to Davis's fortuitous decision to attend the [[Monterey International Pop Festival]], where he spotted and signed several leading acts including [[Janis Joplin]]. Joplin led the way for several generations of female rock and rollers. However, Columbia/CBS still had a hand in traditional pop and jazz and one of its key acquisitions during this period was [[Barbra Streisand]]. She released her first solo album on Columbia in 1963 and remains with the label to this day. Additionally, the label kept \nMiles Davis on the roster, and his late 1960s recordings, ''[[In a Silent Way]]'' and ''[[Bitches Brew]]'', pioneered a [[Jazz fusion|fusion of jazz and rock music]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/bitches-brew-r106167/review| title = Bitches Brew| author = Jurek, Thom| accessdate = April 11, 2012| publisher = Allmusic.com}}</ref>\n\nA San Francisco group called [[Moby Grape]] had been gaining popularity on the West Coast, and were signed by Davis in 1967. As a way of introducing them to the world with a splash, they released [[Moby Grape (album)|their debut album]], along with five singles from the album, all on the same day, June 6, 1967, 23 years following [[D-Day]]. The album hit made #24 on the [[Billboard 200]], but the singles barely made a dent in the charts, the best performer being \"Omaha,\" which lasted a mere three weeks on the Hot 100 reaching only No. 88. The other charter, \"Hey Grandma,\" only reached the Bubbling Under chart and faded within a week. Also, there were some complaints about the obscene gesture made to the American flag on the front cover that had to be edited out on the second pressing, not to mention that the group started to decline in sales after that. The return on all the promotional budget for the singles realized nothing. Although the group made two more albums, this particular publicity stunt was never again attempted by Columbia or any other major label.\n\n====Simon & Garfunkel====\nArguably the most commercially successful Columbia pop act of this period, other than Bob Dylan, was Simon & Garfunkel. The duo scored a surprise No. 1 hit in 1965 when CBS producer [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]], inspired by the folk-rock experiments of The Byrds and others, added drums and bass to the duo's earlier recording of \"[[The Sound of Silence]]\" without their knowledge or approval. Indeed, the duo had already broken up some months earlier, discouraged by the poor sales of their debut LP, and [[Paul Simon]] had relocated to the UK, where he famously only found out about the single being a hit via the music press. The dramatic success of the song prompted Simon to return to the US; the duo reformed, and they soon became one of the flagship acts of the [[folk-rock]] boom of the mid-1960s. Their next album, ''[[Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme]]'', went to No. 4 on the ''Billboard'' album chart. The duo subsequently had a Top 20 single, \"[[A Hazy Shade of Winter]]\", but progress slowed during 1966-67 as Simon struggled with writer's block and the demands of constant touring. They shot back to the top in 1968 after Simon agreed to write songs for the [[Mike Nichols]] film ''[[The Graduate]]''. The resulting single, \"[[Mrs. Robinson]]\", became a smash hit. Both ''The Graduate'' soundtrack and Simon & Garfunkel's next studio album, ''[[Bookends (album)|Bookends]]'', were major hits on the album chart, with combined total sales in excess of five million copies. Simon and Garfunkel's fifth and final studio album, ''[[Bridge over Troubled Water]]'' (1970), reached number one in the US album charts in January 1970 and became one of the most successful albums of all time.<ref name=\"bridge\">{{cite web|last1=Eder|first1=Bruce|title=Bridge Over Troubled Water|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bridge-over-troubled-water-mw0000191730|website=AllMusic|accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Hoyt Axton and Tom Rush====\nDavis lured artists [[Hoyt Axton]] and [[Tom Rush]] to Columbia in 1969, and both were given what was known as \"the pop treatment\" by the label. Hoyt Axton had been a folk/blues singer-songwriter since the early 1960s, when he made several albums for [[Horizon Records|Horizon]], then [[Vee-Jay Records|Vee-Jay]]. By the time he joined Columbia, he had mixed successful pop songs like \"[[Greenback Dollar]],\" with hard rock songs for [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], such as \"[[The Pusher]]\", which was used in the film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' in the same year. When he landed at Columbia, his album ''My Griffin Is Gone'' was described as \"the poster child for 'overproduced,' full of all kinds of instruments and even strings\".<ref name=\"bsn27\">{{cite web|last1=Watts|first1=Randy|last2=Callahan|first2=Mike|last3=Edwards|first3=David|last4=Eyries|first4=Patrice|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 27 (K)CS 9000-9999 (1969-1970)|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia3100.html|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}</ref> After that album, Axton left and joined Capitol Records, where his next albums contained \"[[Joy to the World (Three Dog Night song)|Joy to the World]]\" and \"[[Never Been to Spain]],\" which became hits for [[Three Dog Night]] on [[Dunhill Records|Dunhill]]. Axton eventually became a country singer, and founded his own record label, Jeremiah.\n\nTom Rush had always been the \"storyteller\" or \"balladeer\" type of folk artist, before and after his stint with Columbia, to which Rush was lured from [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]. As with Axton, Rush was given \"the treatment\" on [[Tom Rush (1970 album)|his self-titled Columbia debut]]. The multitude of instruments added to his usual solo guitar were all done \"tastefully\", of course, but was not really on par with Rush's audience expectations. He commented to record label historian Mike Callahan: {{cquote|Well, when you're in the studio, they bring out all these \"sweeteners\" and things they have, and while you're there, you say, yeah, that sounds good. But then you get the album home and you almost can't hear yourself under all that.<ref name=\"bsn27\" />}} Eventually, Rush returned to his usual sound (which he applied to his [[Wrong End of the Rainbow|next]] [[Merrimack County (album)|three]] [[Ladies Love Outlaws (Tom Rush album)|albums]] for Columbia) and has been playing to appreciative audiences ever since.\n\n===The 1970s===\n====Catalog numbers====\nThe Columbia album series began in 1951 with album GL-500 (CL-500) and reached an awkward milestone in 1970, when the stereo numbering sequence reached CS-9999, assigned to the [[Patti Page]] album ''Honey Come Back''. This presented a catalog numbering system challenge as Columbia had used a four-digit catalog number for 13 years, and CS-10000 seemed cumbersome. Columbia decided to start issuing albums at CS-1000 instead, preserving the four-digit catalog number. However, this resulted in the reuse of numbers previously used in 1957-58, although the prefix was now different. In July, 1970, the cataloging department implemented a new system, combining all their labels into a unified catalog numbering system starting with 30000, with the prefix letter indicating the label: C=Columbia, E=[[Epic Records|Epic]], M=[[Columbia Masterworks]], Y=[[Odyssey Records|Columbia Odyssey]], and Z=every other label that CBS distributed.  The prefix letter G was also used for two album sets\u2014or the number of records in the set after the label letter, such as KC2).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaldogproductions.info/c/cbs-lps-us.html|title=CBS LPs - US unified numbering system|website=Globaldogproductions.info|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> The first CBS album released under the new system was [[Elvin Bishop|The Elvin Bishop Group]]'s self-titled album on Fillmore Records, assigned with 30001, while the first actual Columbia release under the system was [[Herschel Bernardi]]'s ''Show Stopper'', assigned with C 30004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaldogproductions.info/c/cbs-us-30000-30499.html|title=LP Discography for CBS Records US combined numbering system 30000-30499|website=Globaldogproductions.info|accessdate=May 5, 2019}}</ref> The highest catalog number released in the old system was CS-1069, assigned to ''[[Sesame Street discography|The Sesame Street Book and Record]]''. Chronologically, Columbia issued at least one album in this series in August, but by that time, the CBS Consolidated 30000 series, which started issuing albums in July with the new label design, was well underway, having issued nearly 100 albums. The system was later expanded with even more prefix letters, which continued until 2005.\n\n====Quadraphonics====\nIn September 1970, under the guidance of [[Clive Davis]], Columbia Records entered the West Coast rock market, opening a state-of-the art recording studio (which was located at 827 Folsom St. in San Francisco and later morphed into the [[Automatt]]) and establishing an A&R head and office in San Francisco at [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman's Wharf]], headed by [[George Daly (Music Industry)|George Daly]], a producer and artist for [[Monument Records]] (who inked a distribution deal with Columbia at the time) and a former bandmate of [[Nils Lofgren]] and [[Roy Buchanan]]. The recording studio operated under CBS until 1978.<ref>{{cite book |title=If These Halls Could Talk: A Historical Tour Through San Francisco Recording Studios |url=https://archive.org/details/ifthesehallscoul00heat |url-access=registration |last=Johnson |first=Heather |publisher=Thomson Course Technology |year=2006 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ifthesehallscoul00heat/page/n104 90]\u201394 |isbn=1-59863-141-1}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early 1970s, Columbia began recording in a four-channel process called [[quadraphonic]], using the \"SQ\" (Stereo Quadraphonic) standard that used an electronic encoding process that could be decoded by special amplifiers and then played through four speakers, with each speaker placed in the corner of a room. Remarkably, RCA countered with another quadraphonic process that required a special cartridge to play the \"discrete\" recordings for four-channel playback. Both Columbia and RCA's quadraphonic records could be played on conventional stereo equipment. Although the Columbia process required less equipment and was quite effective, many were confused by the competing systems and sales of both Columbia's matrix recordings and RCA's discrete recordings were disappointing. A few other companies also issued some matrix recordings for a few years. Quadraphonic recording was used by both classical artists, including [[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Pierre Boulez]], and popular artists such as [[Electric Light Orchestra]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Ray Conniff]], [[Carlos Santana]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[The Clash]] and [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]]. Columbia even released a soundtrack album of the movie version of ''[[Funny Girl (film)|Funny Girl]]'' in quadraphonic. Many of these recordings were later remastered and released in Dolby surround sound on CD.\n\n====Yetnikoff becomes president====\nIn 1975, Walter Yetnikoff was promoted to become President of Columbia Records, and his vacated position as President of CBS Records International was filled by Dick Asher. At this point, according to music historian Frederic Dannen, the  shy and introverted Yetnikoff began to transform his personality, becoming (in Asher's words) \"wild, menacing, crude, and above all, very loud\". In Dannen's view, Yetnikoff was probably over-compensating for his naturally sensitive and generous personality, and that he had little hope of being recognised as a \"record man\" (someone with a musical ear and an intuitive understanding of current trends and artists' intentions) because he was tone-deaf, so he instead determined to become a \"colourful character\".<ref>Dannen, ''op cit'', p.19</ref> Yetnikoff soon became notorious for his violent temper and regular tantrums: \"He shattered glassware, spewed a mixture of Yiddish and barnyard epithets, and had people physically ejected from the CBS building.\"<ref>Dannen, ''op cit'', p.21</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Columbia Records of Canada was renamed CBS Records Canada Ltd.<ref name=ce /> The Columbia label continued to be used by CBS Canada, but the CBS label was introduced for [[French language|French-language]] recordings. On May 5, 1979, Columbia Masterworks began [[digital recording]] in a recording session of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Petrouchka]]'' by the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], conducted by [[Zubin Mehta]], in New York (using [[3M]]'s 32-channel multitrack digital recorder).\n\n====Dick Asher vs \"The Network\"====\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2017}}\nCBS Records had a popular roster of musicians. It distributed [[Philadelphia International Records]], [[Blue Sky Records]], the [[Isley Brothers]]' [[T-Neck Records]] and [[Monument Records]] (from 1971 to 1976). But the music industry was in financial decline. Total sales fell by 11%, the biggest drop since World War II. In 1979 CBS had a pre-tax income of $51 million and sales of over $1 billion. The label laid off hundreds of employees.\n\nTo deal with the crisis, CEO [[John Backe]] promoted [[Dick Asher]] from Vice President of Business Affairs to Deputy President. Charged with cutting costs and restoring profits, Asher was reportedly reluctant to take on the role. He was worried that Yetnikoff would resent his promotion. But Backe had confidence in Asher's experience. In 1972 Asher had turned the British division of CBS from loss to profit. Backe considered him to be honest and trustworthy, and he appealed to Asher's loyalty to the company. Employees at CBS thought Asher was a bore and an interloper. He cut back on expenses and on perks like limousines and restaurants. His relationship with Yetnikoff deteriorated.\n\nAsher became increasingly concerned about the huge and rapidly growing cost of hiring independent agents, who were paid to promote new singles to radio station program directors. \"Indies\" had been used by record labels for many years to promote new releases, but as he methodically delved into CBS Records' expenses, Asher was dismayed to discover that hiring these independent promoters was now costing CBS alone as much as $10 million per year. When Asher took over CBS' UK division in 1972, a freelance promoter might only charge $100 per week, but by 1979 the top American independent promoters had organized themselves into a loose collective known as \"The Network\", and their fees were now running into the tens millions of dollars per year, Music historian [[Frederic Dannen]] estimates that by 1980 the major labels were paying anywhere from to $100,000 to $300,000 ''per song'' to the \"Network\" promoters, and that it was costing the industry as whole as much as $80 million annually.\n\nDuring this period, Columbia scored a Top 40 hit with the [[Pink Floyd]] single \"[[Another Brick In The Wall]]\", and its parent album ''[[The Wall]]'' would spend four months at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' LP chart in early 1980, but few in the industry knew that Dick Asher was in fact using the single as a covert experiment to test the extent of the pernicious influence of The Network - by ''not'' paying them to promote the new Pink Floyd single. The results were immediate and deeply troubling - not one of the major radio stations in Los Angeles would program the record, despite the fact that the group was in town, performing the first seven concerts on their elaborate [[The Wall Tour (1980\u201381)|The Wall Tour]] at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] to rave reviews and sold-out crowds. Asher was already worried about the growing power of The Network, and the fact it operated entirely outside the control of the label, but he was profoundly dismayed to realize that \"The Network\" was in effect a huge [[extortion]] racket, and that the operation could well be linked to organized crime - a concern vehemently dismissed by Yetnikoff, who resolutely defended the \"indies\" and declared them to be \"mensches\". But Dick Asher now knew that The Network's real power lay in their ability to ''prevent'' records from being picked up by radio, and as an experienced media lawyer and a loyal CBS employee, he was also acutely aware that this could become a new [[payola]] scandal which had the potential to engulf the entire CBS corporation, and that the Federal Communications Commission could even revoke CBS' all-important broadcast licenses if the corporation was found to be involved in any illegality.<ref>Dannen, Frederic, ''Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside The Music Business'', Vintage Books, 1991 ({{ISBN|0099813106}}), pp. 4-27</ref>\n\n===The 1980s and sale to Sony===\n\nThe structure of US Columbia remained the same until 1980, when it spun off the classical/Broadway unit, Columbia Masterworks Records, into a separate imprint, CBS Masterworks Records.\n\nIn 1988, the CBS Records Group, including the Columbia Records unit, was acquired by [[Sony]], which re-christened the parent division [[Sony Music Entertainment]] in 1991. As Sony only had a temporary license on the CBS Records name, it then acquired the rights to the Columbia trademarks ([[Columbia Graphophone]]) outside the U.S., Canada, Spain (trademark owned by [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]) and Japan (Nippon Columbia) from [[EMI]], which generally had not been used by them since the early 1970s.

For much of the 1990s, Columbia released its albums without a logo, just the \"COLUMBIA\" word mark in the [[Bodoni]] Classic Bold typeface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://columbiarecords.com/  |title=Columbia Records Online - USA |date=February 8, 1999 |accessdate=December 31, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/19990208003842/http://columbiarecords.com/ |archivedate = February 8, 1999}}</ref>  Columbia experimented with bringing back the \"Notes and Mic\" logo but without the CBS mark on the microphone.

[[Mike Smith (A&R man)|Mike Smith]] is the Managing Director of Columbia Label Group, Ian Dutt is Marketing Director and Alison Donald is Director of A&R.\n\n===Aware Records===\n\nIn 1997, Columbia made an affiliation with unsigned artist promotion label '''[[Aware Records]]''' to distribute Aware's artists' music.  Through this venture, Columbia has found highly successful artists.  In 2002, Columbia and Aware accepted the option to continue this relationship.\n\n===Columbia Nashville===\n\nIn 2007, Columbia formed '''Columbia Nashville''', which is part of [[Sony Music Nashville]]. This gave Columbia Nashville complete autonomy and managerial separation from Columbia in New York City. Columbia had given its [[country music]] department semi-autonomy for many years and through the 1950s, had a 20,000 series catalog for country music singles while the rest of Columbia's output of singles had a 30,000, then 40,000 series catalog number.\n\n==Recording studios==\n; [[Woolworth Building]] Studio\nIn 1913, Columbia moved into the [[Woolworth Building]] in New York City<ref>Hoffmann, Frank, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xV6tghvO0oMC&printsec=frontcover ''Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound''], New York & London : Routledge, 1993 & 2005, Volume 1.

It was used by several denominations over the next seventy years, then briefly became a radio studio in the late 1940s before being leased by CBS in 1952 and converted into a state-of-the-art recording studio. The 30th Street Studio had unique sonic characteristics, thanks to its soaring one-hundred-foot vaulted ceiling, exposed timber beams, plaster walls and unvarnished wooden floor. When Columbia took over the property, then head of A&R [[Mitch Miller]] (a musician himself) recognised its singular acoustic properties and declared that the hall was to be left \"untouched by human hands\". He posted detailed standing orders to all staff to control the maintenance and cleaning of the space, even down to the changing of light bulbs, ordering that the curtains and other fittings were never to be touched, that no painting was allowed, and especially that the wooden floor could only be swept or vacuumed, and was never under any circumstances to be mopped with water, for fear that this might alter the room's resonant and reflective properties.<ref>Milner, Greg, ''Perfecting Sound Forever: The Story of recorded Music'', Granta Books, London, 2009 ({{ISBN|978-1-84708-140-7}}), p. 149</ref> CBS never took up the option to buy the building outright and it gave up its lease and closed the studio in 1982.
