During [[World War I]], she served as Chief Medical Officer of two units of the [[Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service]]. She cared for the wounded in Serbia, France, and the [[Macedonian front|Thessaloniki Front]].

As a young girl, she entered the father's office and watched him examine the patients or treat wounds; she also went with him to visit patients on remote farms. In addition, her decision to dedicate her life to medicine was probably influenced by her uncles who were successful doctors: James led the missionary hospital in India, and Alex was a professor of anatomy at the University of Glasgow.\n\nMacPhail and her siblings' were initially home schooled by private teachers. Once they were old enough they attended the distant elementary school in [[Coatbridge]], going on to study at Hillhead Academy in [[Glasgow]]. All four children successfully completing their studies at the Academy, and later at the [[University of Glasgow]].\n[[File:\u0414\u0440 \u041a\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043d \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0444\u0435\u0458\u043b \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442.jpg|thumb|Graduation, 1905]]\nAt that time in Scotland, it was unusual for women to study at all, and especially medicine. Of the well-educated womeny from reputable families, they expected only to lead the household well and deal with art. Probably for this reason, her father was against his MacPhail's desire to study medicine. However, she had already demonstrated decisive determination and persistence, and he could not stand in the way of her decision. Her parents understood the importance of education, and on 26 April 1906 she enrolled to study medicine at the [[University of Glasgow]]. She was an excellent student, ane received numerous awards for her studies. She graduated on 12 October 1911 with an [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MB ChB]] from [[University of Glasgow Medical School]].{{sfn|Haines|Stevens|2001|p=192}}<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\">{{cite web |title=Surgeon Katherine S Macphail |url=https://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/ww1-biography/?id=4499 |publisher=University of Glasgow |accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nMacPhail began her medical career at the [[Glasgow Royal Infirmary]] in Glasgow, and she was also an assistant doctor at her father's clinic.\n\n==World War I==\n===Scotland, 1914===\nWhen [[World War I]] broke out, MacPhail decided to volunteer for active service in the [[British Army]] and sent a letter to the Ministry of War requesting to do so. The answer was fast, declining her request and explaining that the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] did not accept women. She turned to the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]], and received a similar response, as it too did not accept female doctors. She contacted [[Elsie Inglis|Dr Elsie Inglis]], who was recruiting women doctors and other medical staff for a women's volunteer medical units. Dr Inglis offered her hospital team to the British Ministry of War, but was rejected by the sentence: \"My dear lady, go home and sit still.\" Dr Inglis then sent letters to the embassies of France, Belgium, Russia and Serbia, who accepted this offer immediately and with gratitude. \n{{Quote box\n | quote  =\"We knew we were being sent out under the auspices of the Suffrage Societies, and each was afraid that every other was a strong supporter, but were much relieved to find that almost none of us was what might be called 'strong', and that Serbia was the common bond, not suffrage.\"<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />\n | source =\n | width  =25%\n | align  =right\n}}\nFrom then, she began active work for the [[Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service]] which affiliated itself with the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|suffrage movement]]. As the units for France and Belgium had already been filled, MacPhail was in a dilemma whether to go to Serbia, which was little known in the United Kingdom at that time. MacPhail later said: \"I really hardly knew where Serbia was, but from what I read, I knew it was very difficult for them.\" MacPhail accepted the offer and joined as the youngest in a group of 30 women who comprised the staff of the first unit of the Scottish Women's Hospital in Serbia. Her sister Isabel accompanied her to function as an [[orderly]].<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />\n\n===Serbia, 1915===\nIn mid-December 1914, MacPhail's group boarded a transport boat in Southampton. On the way to [[Malta]],{{sfn|Dositey Obradovich Circle|2009|p=116}} most members of the unit spent time learning Serbian. Immediately after Christmas, they boarded the ship \"Nile\", which sailed to [[Piraeus]]. They arrived in [[Thessaloniki]] on 1 January 1915, and the next day boarded a train for [[Kragujevac]], which was the headquarters of the Serbian army and military medical team. Though she was a junior doctor, she felt her skills were not being used appropriately.{{sfn|Sharp|Stibbe|2011|p=410}}<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />\n\nIn the year 1915, an epidemic of [[typhoid fever]] emerged among the Serbian army. In June 1915, when the epidemic was in decline, MacPhail became seriously ill with a severe form of the infection. Her hearing was damaged long-lasting high temperatures, and she lost her hair, so covered wore a hat or a scarf for a long time. When she was healed, on the insistence of [[Ernest Troubridge|Admiral Ernest Troubridge]], she left Serbia and returned to Scotland in order to recover completely. She reached Scotland in September 1915.\n\n===France, 1916===\nAs soon as she had recovered sufficiently, MacPhail contacted the Serbian Support Fund in [[London]] and began a campaign to help the organization. She traveled all over Scotland, attended charity meetings and held lectures about her experiences in Serbia, appealing for help for the country.\n\nAs she was unable to return to Serbia, which at the time was behind enemy lines, in January 1916, she joined the charity \"Friends\", which worked in France. She worked at Shalona in Marni, in the [[Champagne (wine region)|Champagne region]], northeast of [[Paris]]. In April 1916, she was offered a job in [[Corsica]], and in May 1916, arrived in [[Bastia]] to work at a hospital. A few days after her arrival she went to [[Ajaccio]], visiting a Scottish Women's Hospital. There, she met with several acquaintances she knew from Serbia, and they told her what was happening to their old unit. Finding that there were opportunities to return to Serbia, she interrupted her stay in Corsica, in order to try to organize the accommodation of Serbian orphans in the \"Friends\" home in the High Savai. Unfortunately, this failed. \"Friends\" took over a hotel in Samoan, about {{convert|20|km}} from the Swiss border, and turned it into a refugee camp. At the end of September 1916, MacPhail took over the duties of a doctor in this home. During her stay in France, Dr. Sondermayer, chief of the Sanitary Department of the Serbian Army, offered her a place in a hospital and MacPhail, immediately accepted the offer.{{sfn|American National Red Cross|1916|p=418}}\n\n===Serbia, 1917===\n[[File:\u041d\u0430 \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0443\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0444\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0443 1917. \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435 .jpg|thumb|left|MacPhail (sitting in the car) with colleagues, 1917.]]\n[[File:\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0443\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0444\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0443.jpg|thumb|Dancing the kolo with an Allied and a Serbian officer, amidst one of the regiments on the Thessaloniki front, ca. 1917\u201318.]]\nIn the early spring of 1917, MacPhail was on the [[Macedonian front|Thessaloniki front]]. In Thessaloniki, MacPhail located her younger sister, Isabel, who arrived there earlier with the Scottish Women's Hospital. Dr Sondermayer offered MacPhail and Isabel an opportunity to work in a newly formed large hospital, which France provided to the Serbian army, named the Serbian Hospital of Crown Prince [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]].\n\nA few days later, they received an invitation from the head of the Serbian Relielf Fund in [[Thessaloniki]] to come to their hospital in Sorovi\u0107 (today the Greek town of [[Amyntaio]], near the Greek-Macedonian border) to help care for the injured civilian population during the bombing of [[Bitola#World War I|Bitola]] and the surrounding area. MacPhail and Isabel as well as two other nurses and a cook were sent to the village of Brod, on the south-eastern side of the Bitola area. Isabel soon left Brod and returned to Thessaloniki to work in the Serbian hospital of Crown Prince Alexander, while MacPhail remained behind. At the end of the year, she traveled to Thessaloniki, returning to Brod with a serious illness. She was sure that it was a disease that was caused by long-term poor nutrition, and later it was identified as [[pellagra]], then a little-known disease caused by a diet insufficient in vitamins.\n\nAt the end of 1917, the hospital of the Serbian Support Fund was moved from Sorovi\u0107 to [[Germijan]] near Brod, where MacPhail's outpatient clinic was closed to this village. At the same time, she approached her deadline to report to her post at the Serbian Hospital of Crown Prince Alexander in Thessaloniki. MacPhail was firmly convinced that her medical help was far more needed in the villages, so she managed to persuade Dr Sondermayer to let her remain in Bitola. At that time, MacPhail was visited by her friend, Dr Edward W. Ryan, whom she showed the poor living conditions in the nearby villages. Seeing this, Ryan immediately began collecting aid through the [[American Red Cross]], and managed to obtain a mobile outpatient unit, which was supplied with drugs and food supplies so that MacPhail could expand her work to improving the nutrition of vulnerable children.\n\nDuring the winter of 1917/18, MacPhail was invited to a celebration where she first saw and met Crown Prince Alexander. In the Macedonian mountains, conditions were harsh and cold, but MacPhail with her mobile outpatient unit visited the surrounding villages regularly and did her job. In the meantime, her family and friends in Scotland collected warm clothes and footwear which Katherine shared with impoverished women and children.\n\n===Scotland, 1918===\nIn the summer of 1918, MacPahil returned to Scotland for a short time to assist her father, Dr Donald MacPhail, who was working alone attending to patients who had contracted [[Spanish flu]]. When he contracted the flu, MacPhail and Isabel left,{{sfn|Miller|2018|p=233}} and the responsible parties accepted their reasons. MacPhail was distinguished by the [[Order of St. Sava]] IV class and the Medal of the Serbian Red Cross,<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" /> while Isabel received the Cross of Mercy. In August 1918, the sisters MacPhail left Thessaloniki and returned to their native Scotland.\n[[File:\u0414\u0438\u043f\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0430 .jpg|thumb|Certificate naming MacPhail as an honorary citizen of Coatbridge, 15 August 1918]]\nIn Scotland, MacPhail cared for her sick father and some of his patients. On 15 August 1918 MacPhail became an honorary citizen of Coatbridge, and at a special ceremony received the town's charter, and a gold watch.\n\nMacPhail followed news of the offensives on the Tessaloniki front and the allies breakthrough in September 1918.\n\n==Interwar period==\n=== Return to Serbia===\nAt the end of November 1918 MacPhail returned to Serbia. Clothing, footwear and other supplies to help Serbia, were collected by her family, friends and patients, were packaged and sent separately via the Red Cross. From [[London]], MacPhail traveled to [[Paris]] and [[Toulon]] where she waited to board a ship to [[Dubrovnik]]. At that time Tulon was then crowded with refugees from Serbia, soldiers and civilians trying to return home. In Toulon she met Darinka Grujic, who had been taking care of Serbian orphans and refugees in France since the beginning of the war, which she wanted to return to Serbia. After several days waiting in Toulon, she embarked for Dubrovnik,then traveled for 3 days to Sarajevo, [[Zemun]] and finally Belgrade.\n\nAfter her arrival in Belgrade MacPhail applied to the Ministry of the Interior and was granted permission to stay to carryout charity work.\n\n====First Children's Hospital in Belgrade====\nAt the beginning of 1919, she opened the first children's hospital in Belgrade. This was facilitated by Darinka Grujic securing five military barracks in Studenicka Street, near the Military Hospital, and giving one of the barracks to MacPhail to establish a children's hospital. British marines, led by Admiral Troubridge, cleaned, repaired and outfitted the barrack. A steriliser was installed along with 25 military beds, bedding, blankets and other supplies from Red Cross. Drugs and military supplies came from the American Red Cross. The Serbian Support Fund opened a charity kitchen for a nearby school, so MacPhail managed to arrange to supply this kitchen with food as well as for children at the hospital, while firewood was provided by the city government. Troubridge received many toys and Florence Harvey offered to provide a car for free. At the end of January 1919, the hospital received its first patients.\n\nDuring the first months of operation, every bed in the hospital was filled, and a large number of children attended the outpatient clinic. MacPhail performed all the medical work because there were few doctors as only about 100 had survived the war. Because of her work, MacPhail was popular in Belgrade, and was able to provide various types of assistance and donations for those who lacked financial means.\n\n====Pavilion in Top\u010dider====\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u0443 \u0422\u043e\u043f\u0447\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0459\u043e\u043d\u0443.jpg|thumb|Patients at Top\u010dider Pavilion]]\nBy spring of 1919, the hospital was already too small in particular due to an increase in the number of children with [[tuberculosis]]. MacPhail learned that there was an empty and abandoned open pavilion that was previously used for children at [[Top\u010dider]], {{convert|10|km}} from Belgrade/ The pavilion was located on a hill, at the edge of a forest, so it was ideal for a treatment consisting of fresh air and sun, which, in addition to good food and rest, was at that time the only medicine for tuberculosis. MacPhail was granted a permit from the city government to arrange necessary repairs for the building and to procure equipment. By Easter 1919 the 40 bed pavilion received its first patients. It was managed by Mary Baker and soon proved to be successful with many children recovering. As an open pavilion it was only used in the summer months. It closed in 1924.\n\n====Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital====\n[[File:Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital surgical ward.png|thumb|Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital surgical ward]]\nAs the work expanded, MacPhail realized that the existing capacities would soon be insufficient for an increasing number of patients, especially because the top of the pavilion made it unusable in the winter, so she began to think about expanding the hospital. An enlarged building in Kneza Milosa Street, near the Military Hospital, was left empty when British marines left Belgrade and MacPhail immediately started the action to get that house for her hospital. It was a large, bright, well-built and preserved building that had enough space to accommodate 50 beds, especially when MacPhail succeeded in replacing large military beds for children's beds. In addition, a small operating room for easy surgical cases was formed, while severe surgical cases were sent to the state hospital. A large department for outpatient patients was also established. This new hospital began operating in November 1919, though it officially opened in February 1921. It was no longer an improvised institution, but a real medical institution. It was officially recognized by the Government of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes as the first Children's Hospital in Serbia, called the Anglo-Serb Children's Hospital, abbreviated ASCH. It was the only children's hospital in what was now [[Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Oldfield|2001|p=149}} Shortly after the opening of this hospital, the Ministry of Health asked MacPhail to receive infants and newborns, so a special nursing department was also set up with treatment provided by the most experienced nurse. By 1921, MacPhail was hopeful to not only perfect this hospital, but to encourage the foundation of others and to train native nurses to work in them.{{sfn|The Hospital|1921|p=5}}\n\n===Dubrovnik===\n[[File:\u0415\u043d\u0438 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0444\u0435\u0458\u043b.jpg|thumb|MacPhail (left) and her colleague preparing food on the terrace \"Villa Brava\u010di\u0107\" in Dubrovnik, ca. 1920-1921]]\nAs the number of patients at Topcider had been steadily increasing, MacPhail came to the idea of finding a place on the seashore where she could accommodate children with tuberculous. She learned that there is a villa in [[Dubrovnik]] that would be ideal for this purpose. MacPhail contacted [[Zivojin Mi\u0161i\u0107]] who was then the head of the general\u0161tab and whom MacPhail knew from the Thessaloniki front. When MacPhail explained to him that this villa in Dubrovnik should serve as a health center and a children's rest home, he immediately ordered the villa to be handed over to the English-Serbian children's hospital for further use. MacPhail's sister, Isabel, who was already doing volunteer work at the Children's Hospital in Belgrade, traveled to Dubrovnik to see the building and to try and find the equipment for her. While she was in Dubrovnik, Isabel heard of an abandoned Austrian hospital near [[Zelenika]] in [[Bay of Kotor|Boka Kotorska]] and traveled there to see what it was about. To her surprise, she found a deserted but fully equipped hospital, with beds, bedding and other material, and a young Serbian officer who kept all of this with his soldiers. It was Vasa Srdi. He offered for Isabel to take everything she needed, and in addition, he immediately arranged shipping and transport of equipment to Dubrovnik. Isabel chose 60 beds together and other equipment and returned to Dubrovnik. As the building itself was well preserved, the hospital was established in February 1920.\n\n===Sremska Kamenica===\nIn the early 1930s, a report was submitted regarding the Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital stating that during the preceding two years, 115 hospital patients were hospitalized (hospitalization of some patients lasted up to 24 months), and 160 children were treated clinically, or outside the hospital. There were also 25 surgical procedures, 194 punctures and 113 X-ray imaging, and 84 immunizations with gypsum were performed. Fifty children left the hospital as successfully cured, 12 of them had improved health status during discharge, and the rest was on further treatment. The conclusion was that in spite of the small number of beds and a limited fund owned by the Anglo-Yugoslav hospital, she managed to fulfill all the tasks. The enormous costs of maintaining a hospital in Belgrade had become increasingly high year after year, and this, among other reasons, influenced MacPhail to start thinking about moving the hospital somewhere in the interior of the country, but not too far from Belgrade, which would be in open air with fresh air and sun. She even thought about buying one of the abandoned [[Fru\u0161ka Gora]] monasteries. Darinka Grujic advised her to try to find a suitable building or to build a new building in [[Sremska Kamenica]], which according to its natural conditions, was the most suitable place for this purpose. As MacPhail already had a holiday home in Sremska Kamenica, she immediately started making plans for the establishment of a new hospital.\n\nMacPhail's old friend, Eng. Vasa Srdi\u0107 had been an officer of the Serbian army in Zelenika in the early 1920s He had helped Isabel and subsequently became a great friend of the sisters MacPhail. After the war, as a graduate engineer of agronomy, he got land in [[Temerin]], where he settled and was engaged in farming and fruit growing. Being aware of MacPhail's plans, he soon learned that on the hill \u010cardak, just above Sremska Kamenica, an old and abandoned vineyard was being sold which could suit MacPhail's plans. She was thrilled with the position of the city itself and its surroundings and bought the land, which was officially conveyed to her on August 1, 1933, and immediately began preparations for the construction of the hospital. According to Ketrin's idea and with the help of an engineer of the Hygienic Institute in Belgrade, an old Russian architect made plans for a three-winged building with a central courtyard and a long terrace along the north and west wing so that children can be in the sun all day.\n\nIn the spring of 1934, the work on the new hospital was completed, all necessary equipment was ordered, and lists of patients scheduled to start treatment were compiled. The Royal Commission of the Danube Banovina approved the opening of the children's sanatorium. The building consisted of a main frontal area and two symmetrically situated wings. The main part consisted of three departments of the hospital, a patient unit, a workshop, a radiotherapy department, a pharmacy section, a space intended for patients with infectious diseases and rooms for the sterilization of instruments and appliances. Also, there was an area for the administration of the hospital, as well as a warehouse for medicines and instruments. In the wings of the buildingm there was a kitchen with a pantry and a dining room for children. On the first floor were four-room dormitories for doctors and nurses. There were also four bathrooms and toilets arranged in the wings of the building. The hospital was built in accordance with the needs of patients who anticipated a longer stay for treatment. There were terraces in front of the south and west wings. Even the courtyard was fenced and decorated like a park. The orchard and vineyard were also located within the yard.\n\nThe principle treatment of bone and joint tuberculosis at the time when antibiotics and antituberculotics did not exist consisted of increasing the general resistance of patients with hygienic and dietary regimen, fresh air therapy, heliotherapy (exposure to the sun during the day, during the winter exposure to artificial light), immobilization and various surgical procedures. Special attention was also paid to hospital hygiene. School-age children attended daily classes that corresponded to their age and curriculum, after which they would receive a certificate at the end of the school year. The hospital also organized workshops that were part of the work therapy, where children attended art classes. Once a week, the Orthodox priest would come to provide the children with religious instruction. The hospital also had a library that was equipped with a large number of children's books, which were both educational and entertaining, and there were a handful of toys.\n\nEnglish-Yugoslav Hospital for Treatment of Osteoarticular Tuberculosis<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" /> was officially opened on September 23, 1934, under the auspices of Her Majesty Queen Maria Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107. The first patients were transferred from a Belgrade hospital as early as August 1. The treatment was focused on patients suffering from tuberculosis of the bones and joints, [[Rickets|rachitis]]. The treatment consisted of fresh air, sun exposure, good food, rest, massage, immobilization with plaster and surgery if there was a need for it. The hospital received children under 14 years of age. During the year, there were up to 50 children, and over the winter, 32. The head of the hospital was MacPhail, the main surgeon was Svetislav Sojanovi\u0107, the main nurse was Agnes Hardy, and Alice Murphy was a secretary. Among the staff, there were two other nurses, one teacher and auxiliary staff. One of the main problems of the hospital was funding, because the children were mostly treated for free. The cost of the hospital was covered by many donors. Among the donors, there was also the Ministry of Social Affairs and Public Health of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Child Protection Fund, as well as various other organizations. All of this was not enough to cover the cost of the hospital, so for this reason, MacPhail had to constantly run a fundraising campaign in order to keep the hospital in operation.\n\nIn 1940, the situation in the region became serious and the sanatorium staff began to prepare with the military against an enemy attack. In February 1941, MacPhail had a plan to evacuate children from the hospital. Three weeks before the war, all children were sent from the hospital to their homes, and all the hospital equipment was packed and sheltered in the basements to be protected in the event of a bombing. The situation become very serious and the British Embassy advised all British citizens to leave the country. Not leaving in time, she and other British residents became the prisoners of the Germans before she was repatriated to Britain.<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />\n\nSoon thereafter, 120 soldiers were placed in the hospital for anti-aircraft patrols. The building was soon turned into a local hospital. The hospital staff often helped the partisan movement in the form of providing medical care and food, which was one of the reasons why the hospital was attacked. After that, the building was abandoned and destroyed. During the war years, the hospital also used hostile forces for its soldiers.\n\n==Post-WWII==\nMacPhail came to Belgrade after the liberation in 1945. When she went to visit Sremska Kamenica, she encountered a building that was without a door and windows, empty and ruined. There was no longer any medical or electrical equipment in it. In July, MacPhail began negotiations over the reopening of a hospital in Sremska Kamenica with the help of the Child Protection Fund from London. The Ministry of Public Health of the Democratic Federative Yugoslavia gave permission to start the reconstruction on August 15. With the help of staff, MacPhail managed to procure medical equipment and medical supplies as well as other necessary things to carry out the operation. From humanitarian organizations from Canada and the United Kingdom came bedding and blankets. The complete equipment from the surgery was found in a military hospital in [[Sremski Karlovci]] and was soon returned. Katherine also received 46 boxes of clothes and bedding for children from friends. The complete repair of the hospital was financed by the Government of the Autonomous Welfare of [[Vojvodina]], and the hospital was restarted on December 19, 1945.\n\nDuring the war, the number of children who suffered from tuberculosis increased. The hospital now operated with a capacity of 75 beds and was permanently filled. The working conditions were difficult at that time due to the lack of equipment and food, as the supply of the hospital was very difficult. During this period, the fruit trees and vineyards that were around the hospital were of great help. Soon, life and work at the hospital returned to normal. However, the new government slowly increased the amount of mistrust towards MacPhail and her associates. She proposed to the Ministry of Health to turn the hospital into a rehabilitation center for children with disabilities, as well as for children who became disabled due to tuberculosis or other illnesses. She also planned to build a workshop where adults with disabilities would help in the production of orthopedic aids.\n\nIn 1947, the new regime decided to nationalize all hospitals and the Anglo-Yugoslav (Anglo-Serb.) Children's Hospital was handed over to the Yugoslav authorities in the autumn of that year. After nationalization, the hospital continued to exist as a state sanatorium for bone tuberculosis.\n[[File:\u041a\u0443\u045b\u0430 \u0421\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0415\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0458\u0443\u0441.jpg|thumb|left|House at 4 Kinburn Place in [[St Andrews]] where MacPhail lived]]\nThe hospital in Sremska Kamenica became a state property and as such, was part of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery of the Medical Faculty in Belgrade, led by Professor Svetislav Stojanovic. Realizing that nothing could prevent the implementation of the communist regime, MacPhail returned to Scotland in 1949, settling in [[St Andrews]].<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />\n\nOn 22 September 1954, to mark the 20th anniversary of the hospital's establishment, MacPhail visited the hospital in Sremska Kamenica and was warmly greeted warmly:\u2014 \"The hospital looked like before, fresh, exposed to the sun and surrounded by rich vineyards. The children attended school classes, freshly-prepared meal awaited the children every day thanks to the staff from the kitchen.\" A memorial plaque was placed in the entrance hall with the inscription that she was its founder. This memorial plaque was a great sign of gratitude for her contribution during the war. Apart from MacPhail, the ceremony were attended by Alice Marfi and Flora Sands.\n\nMacPhail died in St Andrews, 11 September 1974.\n\n==Honors and legacy==\n[[File:RS058-15.jpg|thumb|Postage stamp issued by Serbian Mail, 2015]]\nDuring the World War I, MacPhail was distinguished by the [[Order of St. Sava|Order of St Sava]] of the Fourth and Fifth degrees, and due to the humanitarian activities that followed the war, she received the Order of the Third Degree. Great Britain awarded her one of her greatest awards, the [[Order of the British Empire]]. When it was 1954, for the last time, she came to Serbia to visit her hospital in Sremska Kamenica on the occasion of  twenty years since its founding, MacPhail became an honorary citizen of Sremska Kamenica and the lifelong president of the Karlovac Red Cross. In the courtyard of the hospital, two memorial plaques were placed in her honor, and on June 15, 1988, a monument in her honor was also erected. In December 2015, the Serbian Mail issued commemorative stamps in her honor in partnership with the British Embassy in Belgrade.<ref name=\"bl.uk2016\" />\n\nHer biography, ''Ever yours sincerely: the life and work of Dr Katherine S.

As a young girl, she entered the father's office and watched him examine the patients or treat wounds; she also went with him to visit patients on remote farms. In addition, her decision to dedicate her life to medicine was probably influenced by her uncles who were successful doctors: James led the missionary hospital in India, and Alex was a professor of anatomy at the University of Glasgow.\n\nMacPhail and her siblings' were initially home schooled by private teachers. Once they were old enough they attended the distant elementary school in [[Coatbridge]], going on to study at Hillhead Academy in [[Glasgow]]. All four children successfully completing their studies at the Academy, and later at the [[University of Glasgow]].\n[[File:\u0414\u0440 \u041a\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043d \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0444\u0435\u0458\u043b \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442.jpg|thumb|Graduation, 1905]]\nAt that time in Scotland, it was unusual for women to study at all, and especially medicine. Of the well-educated womeny from reputable families, they expected only to lead the household well and deal with art. Probably for this reason, her father was against his MacPhail's desire to study medicine. However, she had already demonstrated decisive determination and persistence, and he could not stand in the way of her decision. Her parents understood the importance of education, and on 26 April 1906 she enrolled to study medicine at the [[University of Glasgow]]. She was an excellent student, ane received numerous awards for her studies. She graduated on 12 October 1911 with an [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MB ChB]] from [[University of Glasgow Medical School]].{{sfn|Haines|Stevens|2001|p=192}}<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\">{{cite web |title=Surgeon Katherine S Macphail |url=https://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/ww1-biography/?id=4499 |publisher=University of Glasgow |accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nMacPhail began her medical career at the [[Glasgow Royal Infirmary]] in Glasgow, and she was also an assistant doctor at her father's clinic.\n\n==World War I==\n===Scotland, 1914===\nWhen [[World War I]] broke out, MacPhail decided to volunteer for active service in the [[British Army]] and sent a letter to the Ministry of War requesting to do so. The answer was fast, declining her request and explaining that the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] did not accept women. She turned to the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]], and received a similar response, as it too did not accept female doctors. She contacted [[Elsie Inglis|Dr Elsie Inglis]], who was recruiting women doctors and other medical staff for a women's volunteer medical units. Dr Inglis offered her hospital team to the British Ministry of War, but was rejected by the sentence: \"My dear lady, go home and sit still.\" Dr Inglis then sent letters to the embassies of France, Belgium, Russia and Serbia, who accepted this offer immediately and with gratitude. \n{{Quote box\n | quote  =\"We knew we were being sent out under the auspices of the Suffrage Societies, and each was afraid that every other was a strong supporter, but were much relieved to find that almost none of us was what might be called 'strong', and that Serbia was the common bond, not suffrage.\"<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />\n | source =\n | width  =25%\n | align  =right\n}}\nFrom then, she began active work for the [[Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service]] which affiliated itself with the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|suffrage movement]]. As the units for France and Belgium had already been filled, MacPhail was in a dilemma whether to go to Serbia, which was little known in the United Kingdom at that time. MacPhail later said: \"I really hardly knew where Serbia was, but from what I read, I knew it was very difficult for them.\" MacPhail accepted the offer and joined as the youngest in a group of 30 women who comprised the staff of the first unit of the Scottish Women's Hospital in Serbia. Her sister Isabel accompanied her to function as an [[orderly]].<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />\n\n===Serbia, 1915===\nIn mid-December 1914, MacPhail's group boarded a transport boat in Southampton. On the way to [[Malta]],{{sfn|Dositey Obradovich Circle|2009|p=116}} most members of the unit spent time learning Serbian. Immediately after Christmas, they boarded the ship \"Nile\", which sailed to [[Piraeus]]. They arrived in [[Thessaloniki]] on 1 January 1915, and the next day boarded a train for [[Kragujevac]], which was the headquarters of the Serbian army and military medical team. Though she was a junior doctor, she felt her skills were not being used appropriately.{{sfn|Sharp|Stibbe|2011|p=410}}<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />\n\nIn the year 1915, an epidemic of [[typhoid fever]] emerged among the Serbian army. In June 1915, when the epidemic was in decline, MacPhail became seriously ill with a severe form of the infection. Her hearing was damaged long-lasting high temperatures, and she lost her hair, so covered wore a hat or a scarf for a long time. When she was healed, on the insistence of [[Ernest Troubridge|Admiral Ernest Troubridge]], she left Serbia and returned to Scotland in order to recover completely. She reached Scotland in September 1915.\n\n===France, 1916===\nAs soon as she had recovered sufficiently, MacPhail contacted the Serbian Support Fund in [[London]] and began a campaign to help the organization. She traveled all over Scotland, attended charity meetings and held lectures about her experiences in Serbia, appealing for help for the country.\n\nAs she was unable to return to Serbia, which at the time was behind enemy lines, in January 1916, she joined the charity \"Friends\", which worked in France. She worked at Shalona in Marni, in the [[Champagne (wine region)|Champagne region]], northeast of [[Paris]]. In April 1916, she was offered a job in [[Corsica]], and in May 1916, arrived in [[Bastia]] to work at a hospital. A few days after her arrival she went to [[Ajaccio]], visiting a Scottish Women's Hospital. There, she met with several acquaintances she knew from Serbia, and they told her what was happening to their old unit. Finding that there were opportunities to return to Serbia, she interrupted her stay in Corsica, in order to try to organize the accommodation of Serbian orphans in the \"Friends\" home in the High Savai. Unfortunately, this failed. \"Friends\" took over a hotel in Samoan, about {{convert|20|km}} from the Swiss border, and turned it into a refugee camp. At the end of September 1916, MacPhail took over the duties of a doctor in this home. During her stay in France, Dr. Sondermayer, chief of the Sanitary Department of the Serbian Army, offered her a place in a hospital and MacPhail, immediately accepted the offer.{{sfn|American National Red Cross|1916|p=418}}\n\n===Serbia, 1917===\n[[File:\u041d\u0430 \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0443\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0444\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0443 1917. \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435 .jpg|thumb|left|MacPhail (sitting in the car) with colleagues, 1917.]]\n[[File:\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0443\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0444\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0443.jpg|thumb|Dancing the kolo with an Allied and a Serbian officer, amidst one of the regiments on the Thessaloniki front, ca. 1917\u201318.]]\nIn the early spring of 1917, MacPhail was on the [[Macedonian front|Thessaloniki front]]. In Thessaloniki, MacPhail located her younger sister, Isabel, who arrived there earlier with the Scottish Women's Hospital. Dr Sondermayer offered MacPhail and Isabel an opportunity to work in a newly formed large hospital, which France provided to the Serbian army, named the Serbian Hospital of Crown Prince [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]].\n\nA few days later, they received an invitation from the head of the Serbian Relielf Fund in [[Thessaloniki]] to come to their hospital in Sorovi\u0107 (today the Greek town of [[Amyntaio]], near the Greek-Macedonian border) to help care for the injured civilian population during the bombing of [[Bitola#World War I|Bitola]] and the surrounding area. MacPhail and Isabel as well as two other nurses and a cook were sent to the village of Brod, on the south-eastern side of the Bitola area. Isabel soon left Brod and returned to Thessaloniki to work in the Serbian hospital of Crown Prince Alexander, while MacPhail remained behind. At the end of the year, she traveled to Thessaloniki, returning to Brod with a serious illness. She was sure that it was a disease that was caused by long-term poor nutrition, and later it was identified as [[pellagra]], then a little-known disease caused by a diet insufficient in vitamins.\n\nAt the end of 1917, the hospital of the Serbian Support Fund was moved from Sorovi\u0107 to [[Germijan]] near Brod, where MacPhail's outpatient clinic was closed to this village. At the same time, she approached her deadline to report to her post at the Serbian Hospital of Crown Prince Alexander in Thessaloniki. MacPhail was firmly convinced that her medical help was far more needed in the villages, so she managed to persuade Dr Sondermayer to let her remain in Bitola. At that time, MacPhail was visited by her friend, Dr Edward W. Ryan, whom she showed the poor living conditions in the nearby villages. Seeing this, Ryan immediately began collecting aid through the [[American Red Cross]], and managed to obtain a mobile outpatient unit, which was supplied with drugs and food supplies so that MacPhail could expand her work to improving the nutrition of vulnerable children.\n\nDuring the winter of 1917/18, MacPhail was invited to a celebration where she first saw and met Crown Prince Alexander. In the Macedonian mountains, conditions were harsh and cold, but MacPhail with her mobile outpatient unit visited the surrounding villages regularly and did her job. In the meantime, her family and friends in Scotland collected warm clothes and footwear which Katherine shared with impoverished women and children.\n\n===Scotland, 1918===\nIn the summer of 1918, MacPahil returned to Scotland for a short time to assist her father, Dr Donald MacPhail, who was working alone attending to patients who had contracted [[Spanish flu]]. When he contracted the flu, MacPhail and Isabel left,{{sfn|Miller|2018|p=233}} and the responsible parties accepted their reasons. MacPhail was distinguished by the [[Order of St. Sava]] IV class and the Medal of the Serbian Red Cross,<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" /> while Isabel received the Cross of Mercy. In August 1918, the sisters MacPhail left Thessaloniki and returned to their native Scotland.\n[[File:\u0414\u0438\u043f\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0430 .jpg|thumb|Certificate naming MacPhail as an honorary citizen of Coatbridge, 15 August 1918]]\nIn Scotland, MacPhail cared for her sick father and some of his patients. On 15 August 1918 MacPhail became an honorary citizen of Coatbridge, and at a special ceremony received the town's charter, and a gold watch.\n\nMacPhail followed news of the offensives on the Tessaloniki front and the allies breakthrough in September 1918.\n\n==Interwar period==\n=== Return to Serbia===\nAt the end of November 1918 MacPhail returned to Serbia. Clothing, footwear and other supplies to help Serbia, were collected by her family, friends and patients, were packaged and sent separately via the Red Cross. From [[London]], MacPhail traveled to [[Paris]] and [[Toulon]] where she waited to board a ship to [[Dubrovnik]]. At that time Tulon was then crowded with refugees from Serbia, soldiers and civilians trying to return home. In Toulon she met Darinka Grujic, who had been taking care of Serbian orphans and refugees in France since the beginning of the war, which she wanted to return to Serbia. After several days waiting in Toulon, she embarked for Dubrovnik,then traveled for 3 days to Sarajevo, [[Zemun]] and finally Belgrade.\n\nAfter her arrival in Belgrade MacPhail applied to the Ministry of the Interior and was granted permission to stay to carryout charity work.\n\n====First Children's Hospital in Belgrade====\nAt the beginning of 1919, she opened the first children's hospital in Belgrade. This was facilitated by Darinka Grujic securing five military barracks in Studenicka Street, near the Military Hospital, and giving one of the barracks to MacPhail to establish a children's hospital. British marines, led by Admiral Troubridge, cleaned, repaired and outfitted the barrack. A steriliser was installed along with 25 military beds, bedding, blankets and other supplies from Red Cross. Drugs and military supplies came from the American Red Cross. The Serbian Support Fund opened a charity kitchen for a nearby school, so MacPhail managed to arrange to supply this kitchen with food as well as for children at the hospital, while firewood was provided by the city government. Troubridge received many toys and Florence Harvey offered to provide a car for free. At the end of January 1919, the hospital received its first patients.\n\nDuring the first months of operation, every bed in the hospital was filled, and a large number of children attended the outpatient clinic. MacPhail performed all the medical work because there were few doctors as only about 100 had survived the war. Because of her work, MacPhail was popular in Belgrade, and was able to provide various types of assistance and donations for those who lacked financial means.\n\n====Pavilion in Top\u010dider====\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u0443 \u0422\u043e\u043f\u0447\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0459\u043e\u043d\u0443.jpg|thumb|Patients at Top\u010dider Pavilion]]\nBy spring of 1919, the hospital was already too small in particular due to an increase in the number of children with [[tuberculosis]]. MacPhail learned that there was an empty and abandoned open pavilion that was previously used for children at [[Top\u010dider]], {{convert|10|km}} from Belgrade/ The pavilion was located on a hill, at the edge of a forest, so it was ideal for a treatment consisting of fresh air and sun, which, in addition to good food and rest, was at that time the only medicine for tuberculosis. MacPhail was granted a permit from the city government to arrange necessary repairs for the building and to procure equipment. By Easter 1919 the 40 bed pavilion received its first patients. It was managed by Mary Baker and soon proved to be successful with many children recovering. As an open pavilion it was only used in the summer months. It closed in 1924.\n\n====Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital====\n[[File:Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital surgical ward.png|thumb|Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital surgical ward]]\nAs the work expanded, MacPhail realized that the existing capacities would soon be insufficient for an increasing number of patients, especially because the top of the pavilion made it unusable in the winter, so she began to think about expanding the hospital. An enlarged building in Kneza Milosa Street, near the Military Hospital, was left empty when British marines left Belgrade and MacPhail immediately started the action to get that house for her hospital. It was a large, bright, well-built and preserved building that had enough space to accommodate 50 beds, especially when MacPhail succeeded in replacing large military beds for children's beds. In addition, a small operating room for easy surgical cases was formed, while severe surgical cases were sent to the state hospital. A large department for outpatient patients was also established. This new hospital began operating in November 1919, though it officially opened in February 1921. It was no longer an improvised institution, but a real medical institution. It was officially recognized by the Government of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes as the first Children's Hospital in Serbia, called the Anglo-Serb Children's Hospital, abbreviated ASCH. It was the only children's hospital in what was now [[Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Oldfield|2001|p=149}} Shortly after the opening of this hospital, the Ministry of Health asked MacPhail to receive infants and newborns, so a special nursing department was also set up with treatment provided by the most experienced nurse. By 1921, MacPhail was hopeful to not only perfect this hospital, but to encourage the foundation of others and to train native nurses to work in them.{{sfn|The Hospital|1921|p=5}}\n\n===Dubrovnik===\n[[File:\u0415\u043d\u0438 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0444\u0435\u0458\u043b.jpg|thumb|MacPhail (left) and her colleague preparing food on the terrace \"Villa Brava\u010di\u0107\" in Dubrovnik, ca. 1920-1921]]\nAs the number of patients at Topcider had been steadily increasing, MacPhail came to the idea of finding a place on the seashore where she could accommodate children with tuberculous. She learned that there is a villa in [[Dubrovnik]] that would be ideal for this purpose. MacPhail contacted [[Zivojin Mi\u0161i\u0107]] who was then the head of the general\u0161tab and whom MacPhail knew from the Thessaloniki front. When MacPhail explained to him that this villa in Dubrovnik should serve as a health center and a children's rest home, he immediately ordered the villa to be handed over to the English-Serbian children's hospital for further use. MacPhail's sister, Isabel, who was already doing volunteer work at the Children's Hospital in Belgrade, traveled to Dubrovnik to see the building and to try and find the equipment for her. While she was in Dubrovnik, Isabel heard of an abandoned Austrian hospital near [[Zelenika]] in [[Bay of Kotor|Boka Kotorska]] and traveled there to see what it was about. To her surprise, she found a deserted but fully equipped hospital, with beds, bedding and other material, and a young Serbian officer who kept all of this with his soldiers. It was Vasa Srdi. He offered for Isabel to take everything she needed, and in addition, he immediately arranged shipping and transport of equipment to Dubrovnik. Isabel chose 60 beds together and other equipment and returned to Dubrovnik. As the building itself was well preserved, the hospital was established in February 1920.\n\n===Sremska Kamenica===\nIn the early 1930s, a report was submitted regarding the Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital stating that during the preceding two years, 115 hospital patients were hospitalized (hospitalization of some patients lasted up to 24 months), and 160 children were treated clinically, or outside the hospital. There were also 25 surgical procedures, 194 punctures and 113 X-ray imaging, and 84 immunizations with gypsum were performed. Fifty children left the hospital as successfully cured, 12 of them had improved health status during discharge, and the rest was on further treatment. The conclusion was that in spite of the small number of beds and a limited fund owned by the Anglo-Yugoslav hospital, she managed to fulfill all the tasks. The enormous costs of maintaining a hospital in Belgrade had become increasingly high year after year, and this, among other reasons, influenced MacPhail to start thinking about moving the hospital somewhere in the interior of the country, but not too far from Belgrade, which would be in open air with fresh air and sun. She even thought about buying one of the abandoned [[Fru\u0161ka Gora]] monasteries. Darinka Grujic advised her to try to find a suitable building or to build a new building in [[Sremska Kamenica]], which according to its natural conditions, was the most suitable place for this purpose. As MacPhail already had a holiday home in Sremska Kamenica, she immediately started making plans for the establishment of a new hospital.\n\nMacPhail's old friend, Eng. Vasa Srdi\u0107 had been an officer of the Serbian army in Zelenika in the early 1920s He had helped Isabel and subsequently became a great friend of the sisters MacPhail. After the war, as a graduate engineer of agronomy, he got land in [[Temerin]], where he settled and was engaged in farming and fruit growing. Being aware of MacPhail's plans, he soon learned that on the hill \u010cardak, just above Sremska Kamenica, an old and abandoned vineyard was being sold which could suit MacPhail's plans. She was thrilled with the position of the city itself and its surroundings and bought the land, which was officially conveyed to her on August 1, 1933, and immediately began preparations for the construction of the hospital. According to Ketrin's idea and with the help of an engineer of the Hygienic Institute in Belgrade, an old Russian architect made plans for a three-winged building with a central courtyard and a long terrace along the north and west wing so that children can be in the sun all day.\n\nIn the spring of 1934, the work on the new hospital was completed, all necessary equipment was ordered, and lists of patients scheduled to start treatment were compiled. The Royal Commission of the Danube Banovina approved the opening of the children's sanatorium. The building consisted of a main frontal area and two symmetrically situated wings. The main part consisted of three departments of the hospital, a patient unit, a workshop, a radiotherapy department, a pharmacy section, a space intended for patients with infectious diseases and rooms for the sterilization of instruments and appliances. Also, there was an area for the administration of the hospital, as well as a warehouse for medicines and instruments. In the wings of the buildingm there was a kitchen with a pantry and a dining room for children. On the first floor were four-room dormitories for doctors and nurses. There were also four bathrooms and toilets arranged in the wings of the building. The hospital was built in accordance with the needs of patients who anticipated a longer stay for treatment. There were terraces in front of the south and west wings. Even the courtyard was fenced and decorated like a park. The orchard and vineyard were also located within the yard.\n\nThe principle treatment of bone and joint tuberculosis at the time when antibiotics and antituberculotics did not exist consisted of increasing the general resistance of patients with hygienic and dietary regimen, fresh air therapy, heliotherapy (exposure to the sun during the day, during the winter exposure to artificial light), immobilization and various surgical procedures. Special attention was also paid to hospital hygiene. School-age children attended daily classes that corresponded to their age and curriculum, after which they would receive a certificate at the end of the school year. The hospital also organized workshops that were part of the work therapy, where children attended art classes. Once a week, the Orthodox priest would come to provide the children with religious instruction. The hospital also had a library that was equipped with a large number of children's books, which were both educational and entertaining, and there were a handful of toys.\n\nEnglish-Yugoslav Hospital for Treatment of Osteoarticular Tuberculosis<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" /> was officially opened on September 23, 1934, under the auspices of Her Majesty Queen Maria Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107. The first patients were transferred from a Belgrade hospital as early as August 1. The treatment was focused on patients suffering from tuberculosis of the bones and joints, [[Rickets|rachitis]]. The treatment consisted of fresh air, sun exposure, good food, rest, massage, immobilization with plaster and surgery if there was a need for it. The hospital received children under 14 years of age. During the year, there were up to 50 children, and over the winter, 32. The head of the hospital was MacPhail, the main surgeon was Svetislav Sojanovi\u0107, the main nurse was Agnes Hardy, and Alice Murphy was a secretary. Among the staff, there were two other nurses, one teacher and auxiliary staff. One of the main problems of the hospital was funding, because the children were mostly treated for free. The cost of the hospital was covered by many donors. Among the donors, there was also the Ministry of Social Affairs and Public Health of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Child Protection Fund, as well as various other organizations. All of this was not enough to cover the cost of the hospital, so for this reason, MacPhail had to constantly run a fundraising campaign in order to keep the hospital in operation.\n\nIn 1940, the situation in the region became serious and the sanatorium staff began to prepare with the military against an enemy attack. In February 1941, MacPhail had a plan to evacuate children from the hospital. Three weeks before the war, all children were sent from the hospital to their homes, and all the hospital equipment was packed and sheltered in the basements to be protected in the event of a bombing. The situation become very serious and the British Embassy advised all British citizens to leave the country. Not leaving in time, she and other British residents became the prisoners of the Germans before she was repatriated to Britain.<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />\n\nSoon thereafter, 120 soldiers were placed in the hospital for anti-aircraft patrols. The building was soon turned into a local hospital. The hospital staff often helped the partisan movement in the form of providing medical care and food, which was one of the reasons why the hospital was attacked. After that, the building was abandoned and destroyed. During the war years, the hospital also used hostile forces for its soldiers.\n\n==Post-WWII==\nMacPhail came to Belgrade after the liberation in 1945. When she went to visit Sremska Kamenica, she encountered a building that was without a door and windows, empty and ruined. There was no longer any medical or electrical equipment in it. In July, MacPhail began negotiations over the reopening of a hospital in Sremska Kamenica with the help of the Child Protection Fund from London. The Ministry of Public Health of the Democratic Federative Yugoslavia gave permission to start the reconstruction on August 15. With the help of staff, MacPhail managed to procure medical equipment and medical supplies as well as other necessary things to carry out the operation. From humanitarian organizations from Canada and the United Kingdom came bedding and blankets. The complete equipment from the surgery was found in a military hospital in [[Sremski Karlovci]] and was soon returned. Katherine also received 46 boxes of clothes and bedding for children from friends. The complete repair of the hospital was financed by the Government of the Autonomous Welfare of [[Vojvodina]], and the hospital was restarted on December 19, 1945.\n\nDuring the war, the number of children who suffered from tuberculosis increased. The hospital now operated with a capacity of 75 beds and was permanently filled. The working conditions were difficult at that time due to the lack of equipment and food, as the supply of the hospital was very difficult. During this period, the fruit trees and vineyards that were around the hospital were of great help. Soon, life and work at the hospital returned to normal. However, the new government slowly increased the amount of mistrust towards MacPhail and her associates. She proposed to the Ministry of Health to turn the hospital into a rehabilitation center for children with disabilities, as well as for children who became disabled due to tuberculosis or other illnesses. She also planned to build a workshop where adults with disabilities would help in the production of orthopedic aids.\n\nIn 1947, the new regime decided to nationalize all hospitals and the Anglo-Yugoslav (Anglo-Serb.) Children's Hospital was handed over to the Yugoslav authorities in the autumn of that year. After nationalization, the hospital continued to exist as a state sanatorium for bone tuberculosis.\n[[File:\u041a\u0443\u045b\u0430 \u0421\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0415\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0458\u0443\u0441.jpg|thumb|left|House at 4 Kinburn Place in [[St Andrews]] where MacPhail lived]]\nThe hospital in Sremska Kamenica became a state property and as such, was part of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery of the Medical Faculty in Belgrade, led by Professor Svetislav Stojanovic. Realizing that nothing could prevent the implementation of the communist regime, MacPhail returned to Scotland in 1949, settling in [[St Andrews]].<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />\n\nOn 22 September 1954, to mark the 20th anniversary of the hospital's establishment, MacPhail visited the hospital in Sremska Kamenica and was warmly greeted warmly:\u2014 \"The hospital looked like before, fresh, exposed to the sun and surrounded by rich vineyards. The children attended school classes, freshly-prepared meal awaited the children every day thanks to the staff from the kitchen.\" A memorial plaque was placed in the entrance hall with the inscription that she was its founder. This memorial plaque was a great sign of gratitude for her contribution during the war. Apart from MacPhail, the ceremony were attended by Alice Marfi and Flora Sands.\n\nMacPhail died in St Andrews, 11 September 1974.\n\n==Honors and legacy==\n[[File:RS058-15.jpg|thumb|Postage stamp issued by Serbian Mail, 2015]]\nDuring the World War I, MacPhail was distinguished by the [[Order of St. Sava|Order of St Sava]] of the Fourth and Fifth degrees, and due to the humanitarian activities that followed the war, she received the Order of the Third Degree. Great Britain awarded her one of her greatest awards, the [[Order of the British Empire]]. When it was 1954, for the last time, she came to Serbia to visit her hospital in Sremska Kamenica on the occasion of  twenty years since its founding, MacPhail became an honorary citizen of Sremska Kamenica and the lifelong president of the Karlovac Red Cross. In the courtyard of the hospital, two memorial plaques were placed in her honor, and on June 15, 1988, a monument in her honor was also erected. In December 2015, the Serbian Mail issued commemorative stamps in her honor in partnership with the British Embassy in Belgrade.<ref name=\"bl.uk2016\" />\n\nHer biography, ''Ever yours sincerely: the life and work of Dr Katherine S.

{"title_page": "Australian residential architectural styles", "text_new": "{{for|non-residential Australian architectural styles|Australian non-residential architectural styles}}\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2018}}\n[[File:Queenslander home, Australia.jpg|thumb|320px|Home in the [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] style]]\n\n'''Australian residential architectural styles''' have evolved significantly over time, from the early days of structures made from relatively cheap and imported [[corrugated iron]] (which can still be seen in the roofing of historic homes) to more sophisticated styles borrowed from other countries, such as the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian style]] from the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian style]] from North America and Europe and the [[Californian bungalow]] from the [[United States]]. A common feature of the Australian home is the use of [[fence|fencing]] in front gardens, also common in both the UK and the US.\n\n[[Climate of Australia|Climate]] has also influenced housing styles, with [[balconies]] and [[veranda]] spaces being more prevalent in subtropical [[Queensland]] due to the mild, generally warm winters experienced in the state. For many years, Australian homes were built with little understanding of the [[Climate of Australia|Australian climate]] and were widely dependent on European styles that were unsympathetic to Australian landscapes. In recent times, modern Australian residential architecture has reflected the climatic conditions of the country, with adaptations such as double and triple [[Insulated glazing|glazing]] on windows, coordination considerations, use of east and west shade, sufficient [[Building insulation|insulation]], strongly considered to provide comfort to the dweller.\n\nAnother aspect of Australian suburbia is that the suburbs tend to have a combination of both [[upper middle class]] and [[middle class]] housing in the same neighbourhood. In [[Melbourne]], for instance, one early observer noted that \"a poor house stands side by side with a good house.\"<ref name=dav>Davison, Graeme.  \"The Past & Future of the Australian Suburb.\"  Australian Planner (Dec. 1994): 63\u201369.</ref> This is somewhat less common today, with home renovations, [[gentrification]] and the [[teardown (real estate)|teardown]] (\"knock down, rebuild\") method becoming more and more common in affluent suburbs, giving a broader distinction between wealthy and lower class areas.

Sydney was a tent settlement. Building anything more substantial was made unnecessarily difficult by the poor quality of spades and axes that had been provided and the shortage of nails.\n\nThe convicts adapted simple country techniques commonly used for animal shelters and the locally available materials to create huts with [[wattle-and-daub]] walls. So useful were the local [[acacia]] trees for weaving shelters that they were given the name ''Wattle''. Some pipe clay was obtained from the coves around [[Port Jackson]]. Bricks were fired in wood fires and were therefore soft. Lime for cement was obtained by burning oyster shells.\n\nThe first imported roofing material was [[corrugated iron]] sheeting. Roofs of this type were to become part of the Australian vernacular. For many years imported roofing was in very short supply. Two local roofing materials were available- there were extensive reed beds near the Cook's river for thatching. There was also bark which could be peeled off a number of the indigenous trees in large sheets. Methods of heating and flattening the bark were used by the Aboriginal people and these were quickly assimilated by the convict builders.\n\nThe two most significant trees, both of which grew in the Sydney area, were the Melaleuca and the Iron Bark. The Melaleuca bark, having the texture of paper, could be peeled off the tree in layers up to 2&nbsp;cm thick, a metre long and perhaps half a metre wide without serious damage to the tree. Although not particularly durable as exterior roofing, the material provided excellent insulation and was used for ceilings and lining the walls.\n\nThe resilient bark from the Iron-bark tree was adapted as a major building material everywhere that such trees grew. It was widely used as a roofing material, was weatherproof, insulating and could last for thirty years. [[Slab Hut|Houses of axe-hewn slabs]] with Iron-bark roofs continued to be built in rural Australia until WWII.\n\nAs better tools became available the Colonial builders became adept at working the extremely hard and durable timber of the native hardwood forests. The majority of houses were built of split logs rather than sawn timber. The technique employed for the construction of a wall was to chisel out a deep groove in a straight log, preferably of the local termite-resistant Cyprus pine which became the foundation. Split logs that had been adzed flat at the ends were then stood in the groove and another groove log was placed on top and slotted into place in a circular corner post. The gaps between the split logs were either packed with clay and animal hair or had narrow strips of metal cut from kerosene tins tacked over them. The interior could be plastered with clay, lined with paperbark or papered with newspaper, wrapping paper or calico. Cards, photographs, news clippings and commemorative items were often stuck directly onto the walls.\n\nThe technique of making durable hardwood roofing shingles was also developed. Where these shingles have been applied to brick houses, they have sometimes survived to the 21st century, covered by subsequent corrugated iron roofs.\n\nIn the earliest houses windows were usually small, and multi-paned with cylinder glass. When the cost of glass put it beyond reach of the home-owner, blinds of oiled calico were tacked across window openings in the winter months.\n\n'''Types of buildings'''\n\nThe simplest houses were of a single room, which, if the bread-winner prospered, became the kitchen to a more substantial residence, or conversely, became the living room with a lean-to kitchen added. Houses that grew piecemeal were generally asymmetrical, with the door leading into the original room.\n\nHouses that were planned were generally symmetrical, and very simple, usually containing 2 to 4 rooms around a central hallway. The kitchen was frequently detached and entered from a rear verandah or covered breezeway where pantry or [[scullery (room)|scullery]] might also be located. Fireplaces projected outwards from the walls of the house. Except in the case of some small inner-city Georgian row houses built of brick, houses generally had a verandah added to them, often on three sides.\n\nOne class of people who maintained the tradition of wattle and daub, with a bark roof was the [[Squatting#Squatting in Australia|squatters]] who did not have title to their land, and potentially had to move on every two years.\n\nVery few 19th-century houses of wattle and daub or split timber have survived. A small number of split-timber cottages which later became kitchens may be seen adjacent to more substantial homes, generally painted to match the house and barely recognizable.\n\nMost buildings erected in the first 50 years of Australian settlement were simple and plain. Convict huts, marine barracks, government stores and houses for officials were simple rectangular prisms covered with hipped or gabled roofs often with verandahs supported on wooden columns in the Classical manner. They were influenced in particular by the regulation British military buildings in India and other tropical locations.\n\nAt the time of the first settlement, [[Georgian architecture]] was the architectural vernacular in Britain. Craftsmen, including carpenters and plasterers were trained in the classic proportions associated with the [[Palladian architecture|Palladian style]] fashionable across Europe. Palladian ideals reveal themselves in some of the few larger homes of the Regency period such as \u201cElizabeth Bay House\u201d. [[neoclassical architecture|Neoclassism]] incorporating not only [[Greeks|Greek]] but also sometimes [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Motif (art)|motifs]], beginning in Europe about 1760, also influenced Australian architectural style.  \u201cFernhill\u201d at Mulgoa with its wide colonnaded verandah shows the influence of Neoclassicism.\nAs the Australian economy developed and settlements became more established, more sophisticated buildings emerged.\n\n===Old Colonial Georgian Style===\n<gallery>\nFile:Elizabeth Farm-1.jpg|[[Elizabeth Farm|Elizabeth Farm cottage]], [[Parramatta|Parramatta, New South Wales]]; completed in 1793; one of the oldest surviving residences in Australia\nFile:Harper's Mansion front.jpg|Harper's Hill, [[Berrima, New South Wales]]\nFile:Harrisford, 182 George Street Parramatta, New South Wales.jpg|Harrisford House, [[Parramatta|Parramatta, New South Wales]]; completed 1820s\nFile:Brislington parramatta.jpg|[[Brislington, Parramatta]]; completed 1821\nFile:Oatlands Tasmania (31995607310).jpg|Oatlands Coach House, [[Oatlands, Tasmania]]\nFile:EscholParkNSWEPhouse.jpg|Eschol Park House; [[New South Wales]]\nFile:(1)Experiment Farm Cottage 119.jpg|[[Experiment Farm Cottage]], [[Harris Park, New South Wales]]; completed 1795\nFile:Roseneath Cottage, Parramatta.jpg|Roseneath Cottage, [[Parramatta|Parramatta, New South Wales]]; completed 1837\nFile:AUS NSW Richmond Bowmans Cottage.jpg|Bowmans Cottage, [[Richmond, New South Wales]]; completed 1815\nFile:Kent Street, Millers Point, Sydney, NSW Houses (7889945778).jpg|Terraces, [[Millers Point, New South Wales]]\nFile:1772 - Englefield (5056381b2).jpg|Englefield; [[Maitland, New South Wales]]\nFile:Old Government House - Parramatta Park, Parramatta, NSW (7822329132).jpg|[[Old Government House, Parramatta|Old Government House, Parramatta, New South Wales]]; completed between 1799 and 1820\n</gallery>\n\n===Old Colonial Regency Style===\n<gallery>\nImage:PanshangerTasmania1948.jpg|''Panshanger'', near [[Longford, Tasmania]]\nImage:(1)Rockwall_in_Potts_Point.jpg|Rockwall House, designed by [[John Verge]], in [[Potts Point, New South Wales]]\nFile:ElizabethBayHouse4.JPG|[[Elizabeth Bay House]], Elizabeth Bay, New South Wales, also designed by John Verge\nFile:Clarendon House Tasmania - front entrance.JPG|Clarendon House, [[Evandale, Tasmania]]; completed in 1838<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationaltrust.org.au/places/clarendon/ |title=Clarendon |work=Explore: Places: Tasmania |publisher=[[National Trust of Australia]] |date=2020 |access-date=22 April 2020 }}</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n===Old Colonial Grecian Style===\n\n====Old Colonial Gothic Picturesque====\n{{main|Jacobethan}}\n<gallery>\nImage:1_Conservatorium_a.JPG|[[Conservatorium of Music, Sydney]], designed by [[Francis Greenway]]\nImage:1_Lindesay1.jpg|[[Lindesay, Darling Point]], New South Wales\n</gallery>\n\n== Victorian Period c. 1840 \u2013 c. 1890 ==\n\n*'''[[Gothic Revival]]'''\n'''1840\u20131880'''\n\n[[File:S\u00eddney-Australia11.JPG|thumb|right|Government House was the most sophisticated example of Gothic Revival architecture in the First Fleet colony.]]\nDuring the Victorian era, the [[British Empire]], including Australia, was yet heavily [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], and thus subject to the influence of the [[Oxford movement|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge Movement]]s, which favored the use of [[Gothic Revival architecture]]. Thus, while a local [[magnate]] may have built his home in a classical style, he would potentially fund a church in the Gothic style. Thus, during the 19th century, when Australia was expanding rapidly, two forms of architecture were very evident: Gothic and the Classical styles. Originally Gothic was for God, and the Classical for the man. Later a new \"self-made\" Australian began to emerge, unhindered by a classical British education dictating classical gentlemanly interests. This \"new\" [[self-made man]] (like his contemporaries in Britain) would often choose Gothic as the design for his home.\n\nThe great cathedrals of the [[Middle Ages]] during the Gothic period of [[ecclesiastical architecture]] formed the inspiration for this particular architectural style; not only in residential buildings, but in many commercial structures, churches and cathedrals built during this time. St. Paul's and St. Patrick's Cathedrals in [[Melbourne]] are excellent examples of the Gothic Revival period, often referred to as Victorian Gothic. Characteristics were: steeply pitched roofs often made of slate, narrow doors and windows resolving in a Gothic pointed arch at their height (known as [[lancet window]]s), diamond pane glazing to windows imitating a stained glass affect, and intricate parapets, often of a religious nature, with a cross. In non-terrace houses, the drawing room was often pulled forward, adding a bay window to the front of the dwelling.\n\n[[File:Singapore Cottage, Collingwood.jpg|thumb|right|Prefabricated Victorian workers cottages were among the simple residences to appear in the slums of major cities in the 1850s.  Rare examples like this one in [[Collingwood, Victoria]] still remain today.]]\nThe [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] style in Australia can be divided into 3 periods: Early, Mid and Late. The period in its entirety stretches from 1837 to 1901 and was named after the then Queen, [[Queen Victoria]]. Early styles featured symmetrical layouts and fa\u00e7ades, a centrally located front door and a hipped roof of corrugated iron, leading to a veranda on the fa\u00e7ade. During the 1850s cast-iron lacework came to Australia, where it made its way on to Mid and Late Victorian Homes with much the same floor plan as the Colonial Style, a central hallway with a standard 4 rooms. [[Weatherboard]]s were often used, although larger homes used red brick and blue stone. In the Mid Victorian Style, decoration began to gain popularity. The bullnosed veranda roof was introduced, sidelights were added either side of the front door, and [[terrace house|terraced houses]] were springing up everywhere, containing parapets and detailed dividing walls between the property boundaries. Late Victorian Style homes had perhaps the most decorative features in all of the known architectural styles to date, which is often referred to as Boom Style. Towards the end of the Victorian era, timber fretwork was being used more and more, which led into the Edwardian/Federation Styles.\n\n=== Queenslander style ===\n{{main|Queenslander (architecture)}}\nThe Queenslander style house is characterized by an all timber painted exterior, a timber stud frame, and a floor raised on piles for air flow in hot climate. They have wide verandahs (often the length of the house and enclosed by shutters, and roofs are gabled and corrugated iron. The street facing view is often symmetrical. The NSW Queenslander is often smaller than the original classic Queenslander and is less decorative probably due to limited supply of delicate timber detail and trades-people to build them. It is sometimes combined with the Ranch style house.\n\nFrom the 1840s, a specific style of building emerged in [[Queensland]]. The [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] style of houses are identifiable by large verandahs and large double doors which open onto these verandahs, stilts rising the house above ground level (particularly in older houses), metal roofs typically of corrugated design and the houses are always constructed of mostly wood.\n<gallery>\nFile:Queenslander1.JPG|Federation-style Queenslander\nFile:Queenslander2.JPG|Inter-war Queenslander\nFile:Queenslander.jpg|Victorian era Queenslander\nFile:Queenslander House Brisbane1.jpg|A typical 'Queenslander' style house in [[Brisbane]]\nFile:Kilcoy Old Queenslander-01+ (374769341).jpg|An old Queenslander in [[Kilcoy]]\n</gallery>\n\n*'''Early, Mid and Late Victorian'''\n'''1845\u20131900'''\nThe styles during this period were: Georgian, Regency, Egyptian, Academic Classical, Free Classical, Filligree, Mannerist, Second Empire, Italianate, Romanesque, Academic Gothic, Free Gothic, Tudor, Rustic Gothic and Carpenter Gothic. Of these fifteen styles, the following seven were normally used for residential architecture:\n\n===Georgian Revival===\n{{main|Georgian architecture}}\nA typical Victorian Georgian house of the 19th century was simple, elegant and formal in style.

From the mid-19th century in particular, as people became more affluent, they built more elaborate homes, and one of the favoured elaborations was the filigree, or screen, of [[cast iron]] or [[wrought iron]]. This developed to the point where it has become one of the major features of Australian architecture. Many homes with this feature are also considered [[Italianate architecture]], the filigree element being the wrought iron balcony.\n<gallery>\nFile:Holcombe Terrace drummond street carlton.jpg|''Holcombe Terrace''.

Their influence was long-lasting and eventually led to the Italianate architectural style of the 19th century. The style featured asymmetry and, usually, a tower of varying size. In Australia, the addition of the verandah, sometimes arcaded but later in Filigree (wrought iron), gave a regional flavour to the style.\n<gallery>\nGovernmentHouseMelbourne1 gobeirne.jpg|[[Government House, Melbourne]], Victoria;  completed in 1876\nEynesbury House, Adelaide-1.jpg|[[Eynesbury Senior College|''Eynesbury House'']], Kingswood, South Australia; completed in 1881<ref>{{cite web |author=Iwanicki, Iris; Register Historian |url=https://data.environment.sa.gov.au/Content/Publications/11526_Research.pdf |title=Eynesbury House |work=Register of State Heritage Items: Item Evaluation Sheet |publisher=Environment South Australia |date=8 June 1982 |access-date=22 April 2020 }}</ref>\nKenilworth1.JPG|''Kenilworth'', [[Annandale, New South Wales|Annandale]], New South Wales\nHeritage Kamesburgh Gardens in Brighton.jpg|''Kamesburgh'', North Road, {{VICcity|Brighton}}, Victoria\nItalianate home, Lang Road, Centennial Park, Sydney - Wiki0123.jpg|Italianate home, [[Centennial Park, New South Wales|Centennial Park]], New South Wales\nCroydon Shubra Hall PLC.JPG|Shruba Hall, {{NSWcity|Croydon}}, New South Wales\nBishopscourt east melbourne.jpg|''Bishopscourt'', {{VICcity|East Melbourne}}, Victoria;  completed in 1853\nRippon Lea.jpg|''Rippon Lea'', {{VICcity|Elsternwick}}, Victoria\n1 Toxteth Park.jpg|''[[Toxteth Park, Glebe|Toxteth Park]]'', Glebe, New South Wales, completed in 1829<ref>{{cite NSW HD|2427721|Toxteth Heritage Conservation Area|fn=C34|date=14 December 2012|accessdate=11 October 2019}}</ref>\nJesmond House.jpg|''Jesmond House'', {{NSWcity|The Hill}}, {{NSWcity|Newcastle}}, New South Wales\n(1)Italianate home Dutruc Street Randwick-1.jpg|''Earlswood'', [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick]], New South Wales\nEpworth repatriation mansion richmond victoria.jpg|''Epworth'', {{VICcity|Richmond}}, Victoria\nMyrnong Hall Acland Street St Kilda.jpg|''Myrnong Hall'', Acland Street, {{VICcity|St Kilda}}, Victoria\nWerribeepark.jpg|''[[Werribee Park]]'', Werribee, Victoria; completed in 1877<ref>{{cite VHD|1207|Werribee Park|hr=1613|ho=2}}</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n===Free Gothic===\n{{main|Gothic Revival architecture}}\nThe Gothic style gained favour from the early days of Queen Victoria's reign. Free Gothic became a popular choice for architects and their clients because it was not concerned with historical correctness and therefore gave them greater freedom in their designs. The style was much in vogue for religious buildings but was sometimes used in residential architecture as well.\n<gallery>\nFile:The Abbey j street.jpg|[[The Abbey, Annandale]], New South Wales.<ref>The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/35</ref>\nFile:AshfieldNSWAmbleside.jpg|Ashfield Castle, {{NSWcity|Ashfield}}, New South Wales, is heritage-listed<ref>{{cite NSW SHR|1020628|Ashfield Castle}}</ref>\nFile:Cloncorrick.JPG|Cloncorrick, [[Darling Point, New South Wales]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Tudor===\n{{main|Jacobethan}}\nThe Tudor style grew out of a nostalgia for older English concepts, particularly focused on the days of Queen Elizabeth I and Henry VIII. Its role in Australia began when the English architect Edward Blore designed Government House in Sydney in 1834. The style spread all over Australia and also influenced later styles like [[Federation Queen Anne]] and Inter-War Old English.\n<gallery>\nImage:Swifts.jpg|Swifts, Darling Point, New South Wales.

For the rich, particularly in the wealthier parts of the larger metropolitan areas, the style evoked images of French aristocracy. Although rare, examples can be found in the bigger cities. Distinctive features include towers, quoining, mansard and slate roofs, square domes dormer windows, iron cresting and rich classical details. In the Australian setting, domestic interpretations of the style often combined filigree elements such as cast iron verandahs.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Labassa.jpg|Labassa.

The style draws on elements of the Victorian era and the earlier [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne style]] of the early 18th century. The Edwardian style coincided with the [[Federation of Australia]]. Thus, the Federation style was, broadly speaking, the Australian version of the Edwardian, but differed from the Edwardian in the use of Australian motifs, like [[kangaroo]]s, the rising sun (of Federation), and [[emu]]s, Australian flora and geometric designs. Some of the most recognisable Federation/Edwardian features include red brick exteriors with embellished wood detail known as [[fretwork]]. Cream painted decorative timber features, tall chimneys were all common. Stained glass windows towards the front of the home became increasingly popular during this period. Internally, Victorian-era features were still evident, including plaster ceiling roses and cornices and timber skirting and architraves. Federation style depicted a [[Tudorbethan architecture|Tudor]] type look, especially on [[gable]]s, and Edwardian gave a simpler cottage look. Terracotta tiles or galvanised iron are generally used for roofing, which is designed with a steep pitch. The gable ends and roof eaves often feature ornate timber brackets, and timber detailing and fretwork are a common inclusion on verandahs.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.domain.com.au/advice/edwardian-architecture-in-australia/ |title=Edwardian architecture in Australia |author=Thompson, Jacqui |work=domain.com.au |publisher= |date= |access-date=29 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome{{who|date=September 2017}} consider that this style was the Federation version of the Queen Anne style. Other styles during this period were Federation Academic Classical, Federation Free Classical, Federation Filligree, Federation Anglo-Dutch, Federation Romanesque, Federation Gothic, Federation Carpenter Gothic, Federation Warehouse, Federation Free Style, [[Federation Arts and Crafts]] and [[Federation Bungalow]]. The names all indicated very similar styles with features so minute separating them. Out of the twelve Federation styles, however, only the following four were normally used{{according to whom|date=September 2017}} in residential architecture:\n\n===Federation Queen Anne===\n{{main|Queen Anne Style architecture}}\n<gallery>\nLandmark edwardian home on canterbury road middle park.jpg|Edwardian home in [[Albert Park, Victoria]]\n(1)Caerleon.jpg|[[Caerleon, Bellevue Hill|''Caerleon'']], [[Bellevue Hill, New South Wales]], the first Queen Anne home in Australia\nBurwood Appian Way 3.JPG|House in [[Appian Way, Burwood|Appian Way]], [[Burwood, New South Wales]]\n'Olevanus' 6 Appian Way.jpg|''Olevanus'' in [[Burwood, New South Wales]]\n7 Thomas Street Coogee NSW.jpg|Residence in [[Coogee, New South Wales]]\n(1) The Annery1.jpg|''The Annery'', [[Darling Point, New South Wales]]\nQueens Bess.jpg|Queen Bess Row in [[East Melbourne, Victoria|East Melbourne]], the largest Queen Anne-styled terrace in Melbourne\nEdwardian style house in Heidelberg, Victoria.jpg|Edwardian house, [[Heidelberg, Victoria]]\nQueen Anne style house in Ivanhoe, Victoria.jpg|A Queen Anne residence in [[Ivanhoe, Victoria]]\nPenshurst Church 2.JPG|''West Maling'', [[Penshurst, New South Wales]]\nFederation style mansion in domain street south yarra.jpg|Federation mansion in [[South Yarra, Victoria]]\nEdwardian terraces in park street south yarra.jpg|Federation terraces in Park Street, [[South Yarra, Victoria]]\nIngleholme, Turramurra, Sydney.jpg|''Ingleholme'', [[Turramurra|Turramurra, Sydney]]\n(1)Strathmore Wentworth Falls.jpg|''Strathmore'', [[Wentworth Falls, New South Wales]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Federation Arts and Crafts===\n{{main|Arts and Crafts architecture}}\nThe Arts and Crafts style came out of a movement to get away from mass-production and rediscover the human touch and the hand-made. The architectural style was characterised by rough-cast walls, shingles, faceted bay windows, stone bases, tall chimneys, high-pitched roofs and overhanging eaves. It was widely used in Australia during the Federation period.\n<gallery>\nImage:15 Arnold Street, Killara, New South Wales (2010-12-04).jpg|Home, Arnold Street, {{NSWcity|Killara}}\nImage:17 Waimea Road, Lindfield, New South Wales (2011-04-28).jpg|Waimea Road, {{NSWcity|Lindfield}}\nImage:SydneyBuilding0124.jpg|Home, Burwood Road, {{NSWcity|Burwood}}\nImage:SydneyBuilding0125.jpg|''St Ellero'', Appian Way, {{NSWcity|Burwood}}\nImage:SydneyBuilding0126.jpg|''Erica'', Appian Way, {{NSWcity|Burwood}}\nImage:ArtsAndCraftsHome.JPG|''Devon'', Martin Road, {{NSWcity|Centennial Park}}\nFile:(1) Hastings1.jpg|[[Hastings (Neutral Bay)|''Hastings'']], {{NSWcity|Neutral Bay}}\n</gallery>\n\n===Federation Bungalow===\n{{main|Bungalow}}\nThe bungalow style was usually a single-storey house with a prominent veranda, especially with the roof covering the veranda. It is seen as a transition phase between the Federation period and the California bungalow.\n<gallery>\nImage:SydneyBuilding0127.jpg|Casa Tasso, Appian Way, Burwood, New South Wales\nImage:SydneyBuilding0128.jpg|Ostia, Appian Way, Burwood, New South Wales\nImage:SydneyBuilding0129.jpg|Home, Appian Way, Burwood, New South Wales\nImage:SydneyBuilding0130.jpg|Home, Appian Way, Burwood, New South Wales\nImage:Bungalow667.JPG|Bungalow, Shaftsbury Road, Burwood, New South Wales\nImage:SydneyBuilding0159.jpg|Arundel, Harrow Road, [[Bexley, New South Wales]]\nImage:RangersCottage.JPG|Ranger's cottage, [[Centennial Park, New South Wales]], designed by government architect [[Walter Liberty Vernon]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Federation Filigree===\nThe filigree style was characterised by the creation of a screen as a prominent style at the front of the house. In the Victorian period, the screen was made of wrought iron, but in the Federation period it was made of wooden fretwork, which could be quite elaborate. It was widely used in Queensland as a way of providing shade and circulation of air for a home.\n<gallery>\nImage:QueenslandBuilding0013.jpg|Home, Rockhampton, Queensland\nImage:QueenslandBuilding0015.jpg|Building, Rockhampton, Queensland\nImage:QueenslandBuilding0017.jpg|Home, Rockhampton, Queensland\nImage:High Street, Millers Point, Sydney, NSW Federation home 0007.jpg|Homes, [[Millers Point, New South Wales]]\nImage:Timber terraces in madden street albert park.jpg|Timber fretwork terraces.  Madden Street, [[Albert Park, Victoria]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Inter-War Period c. 1915 \u2013 c. 1940==\nStyles which existed during the 1915-40 period include Edwardian, Georgian Revival, Academic Classical, Free Classical, Bungalow, Mediterranean, Spanish Mission, Art-Deco, Skyscraper Gothic, Romanesque, Gothic and Old English.\n\n===Californian Bungalow===\n{{main|Californian Bungalow}}\n'''1915\u20131940'''\nThis style can almost instantly be recognised by the columns holding up a front veranda area. The name is almost self-explanatory: bungalow, a rugged type of home. This led to the belief that picket fences looked appropriate at the front fence, although originally they were not used. Darker colours were originally used but, as the years went by, new brighter paint served as a welcoming change to open up the spaces and brighten up the homes. Stone, brick and timber, earthy materials were used. A gable roof faced either the front or side always.\n<gallery>\nImage:Californian Bungalow style house in Preston, Victoria.jpg|Californian Bungalow, [[Preston, Victoria]]\nImage:Belmont flats st kilda.jpg|Belmont Flats.

A staircase almost always dominated the front yard leading to the verandah.\n\n===Spanish Mission===\n{{main|Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture}}\n'''1925\u20131939'''\n\nDistinctly recognised by twisted pylons to a porch area covering the front door, usually windows grouped in threes to the side of the front door area on simpler homes. The style was influenced by the American Spanish inhabitant influenced American Architectural styles. Walls were brick in accordance with council regulations at the time, with white or cream yellowish cream [[stucco]] finish and Spanish terra cotta tiles.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Spanish Mission style house in Heidelberg, Victoria.jpg|Spanish Mission home in [[Heidelberg, Victoria]]\nImage:Belvedere flats St Kilda.jpg|Belvedere Flats.

It had a certain appeal for what was still a predominantly Anglo-Saxon population at the time.\n<gallery>\nImage:SydneyBuilding0150.jpg|Home, Bexley Road, Bexley, New South Wales\nImage:OldEnglish.JPG|Home, Robertson Road, Centennial Park, New South Wales\nImage:SydneyBuilding0180.jpg|Deanbury, Billyard Avenue, Wahroonga, New South Wales\nImage:Bonnington.JPG|Bonnington, Victoria Road, Bellevue Hill, New South Wales\nFile:Tudor Revival house, Adelaide (03).jpg|Unley Park, South Australia\n</gallery>\n\n===Early Moderne===\n{{see also|Streamline Moderne}}\n'''1930\u20131940'''\nA very modern looking style at the time, inspired by a German movement known as [[Bauhaus]], representing functional and clinical architecture. Red or cream brick walls and concrete was also first seen. Steel-framed casement sashes, with larger panes of glass and [[terra cotta]] tiled roofs with a moderate pitch. The only featured part of the house included matching decorative front fences, and a featured roof affect.\n\nThe Streamline Moderne style was a late branch of the [[Art Deco]] style. The style emphasized curving forms, long horizontal lines, and sometimes nautical elements, such as railings and porthole windows. This style was adopted into suburban architecture, most notably in the Waterfall style.\n<gallery>\nImage:BurnhamBeeches1947.jpg|[[Burnham Beeches (Australia)|Burnham Beeches]] mansion in the Dandenong Ranges outside Melbourne, completed 1933 in the [[Streamline Moderne]] style.  The architect was [[Harry Norris]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Post-War Period c. 1940 \u2013 1960 ==\n\n=== Austere ===\n{{see also|Austerity}}\n[[File:SAHT semi-detached cottages.JPG|thumb|[[South Australian Housing Trust]] late 1940s semi-detached cottages, showing little exterior modification of the original design]]\nThe Austere style reflected the lack of availability of building materials and labour in the years following World War II.\n\n===Waterfall (Art Deco) 1940 \u2013 1950===\nFashionable modern houses of the thirties in the [[Streamline Moderne]] style were sometimes described as being like ocean liners, with walls, windows and balconies all sweeping around corners. By the 1940s these details were entrenched into suburban designs. The 'Waterfall' or 'Waterfall Front' style came to be known as such from the use of descending curves in chimneys, fence pillars and other vertical elements. [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]], the Australian architect and writer, noted that three was 'the key to decorative smartness'; three steps usually being used for the waterfall effect and featured parallel lines were often in threes.\n\nDefining features of houses from this period are curved corner windows, including Venetian blinds, some rare examples of which are curved. With a slightly steeper pitched roof than the Early Modern Style, this style was generally of brick veneer cream brick but also could have dark brown glazed feature brickwork incorporated into the external walls, and under windowsills. Chimneys were either stepped or plain, and together with the round windows perhaps gave meaning to the \"Waterfall\" name.\n\nEcclesiastical, International, Melbourne Regional, Brisbane Regional and American Colonial were also styles which existed in the period 1940\u20131960.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Waterfall (Art Deco) style house in Eaglemont, Victoria.jpg|The Waterfall style and Art Deco combined, [[Heidelberg, Victoria]]\nFile:204 Monaro Crescent Red Hill ACT.jpg|House in [[Red Hill, Australian Capital Territory]], designed by [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]]. Typical of the post-war Melbourne regional style: long unbroken roof line, wide eaves, extensive windows.\n</gallery>\n\n===International style===\n{{main|International style (architecture)}}\nThe [[Rose Seidler House]] built by [[Harry Seidler]] for his parents between 1948 and 1950 in Sydney incorporated Modernist features of open planning, a minimal colour scheme, and labour saving devices that were new to Australia at the time. The house won the [[Sir John Sulman Medal]] in 1951 and is today preserved as a museum as a very influential house.<ref name=nswshr-261>{{cite NSW SHR|5045033|Rose Seidler House|hr=00261|fn=S90/05313; S96/00465 [S170]|accessdate=1 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[World War II|second World War]], architects in Australia were influenced by the development of the International style of architecture. Some regional variations developed. In Melbourne, [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]] and [[Roy Grounds]] articulated a Melbourne interpretation of the modern style. Boyd's book ''Victorian Modern'' (1947) traced the history of architecture in the state of Victoria and described a style of architecture that he hoped would be a response to local surroundings as well as the popular international style. In particular he nominated the work of Roy Grounds and in some outer suburban bush houses of the 1930s as being the early stages of such a style. Grounds and Boyd later worked in partnership.\n\nThe houses were typically narrow, linear, and single storey with a low pitched gable roof. They had exposed rafters and wide eaves. Walls were generally bagged or painted brick and windows were large areas of glass with regularly spaced timber mullions.<ref>{{cite web | author=Martin Miles | year=2006 | url=http://www.canberrahouse.com.au/pwmelbourne.html | title=The post-war Melbourne regional style | work=Modernist residential architecture in Canberra | publisher=canberrahouse.com | accessdate=2006-02-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060225055330/http://canberrahouse.com.au/pwmelbourne.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-02-25}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:RoseSeidlerHouseSulmanPrize.jpg|[[Rose Seidler House]] in the northern Sydney suburb of [[Wahroonga, New South Wales]]\n</gallery>\n\n===L-Shape 1945 \u2013 1955===\nThis style represented a change in the overall floor plan, the plan resembling a large \"L\" Shape. Usually with gabled ends to the L, with [[terra cotta]] tiles still being used, as [[concrete]] tiles didn't appear until the late 1960s. Timber or steel framed windows were used, and front-facing fences resembled the house, much the same as had been seen since the Early Modern Period.\n\n=== Dutch Colonial ===\n<gallery>\nFile:1967 Adelaide Dutch Colonial House.jpg|[[Dutch Colonial Revival architecture|Dutch Colonial]] home in [[Adelaide]] (1950s).\nFile:Dutch_Colonial_Revival_house_in_Adelaide.jpg|Dutch Colonial house in [[Mitcham, South Australia]].\n</gallery>\n\n===Timber and fibro fisherman's cottage===\n\nThe original fisherman's cottage was built in many coastal towns between the 1930s and 1950s. It was originally a simple timber framed structure of one or two rooms and a verandah which was clad with asbestos sheeting. The floors were generally raised on piles. The verandah sometimes had handsome wooden balustrade that was sometimes enclosed to make an additional room or sleep-out. Timber detail around windows and gables were often painted- cheery red being one of the most popular traditional colours.\n\nThe original cottages, being relatively cheap to purchase, are now popular for renovation. Construction is easy and owner-building is common. The older buildings require insulation in the ceiling and walls. Timber and fiber cement sheeting now replaces the original asbestos and often the interior is completed gutted to create a modern open plan style of living. Timber strap-work can be used and windows frames painted for effect.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:RenovatedFishermansCottage.jpg|Renovated fisherman's cottage.\n</gallery>\n\n===Triple front (cream brick) 1950 \u2013 1960s===\nDistinctly recognisable by their front-facing walls have 3 and sometimes even 4 front-facing walls. This led to the front entrance sometimes brought round to the side within one of the alcoves created by the multiple fronts. Roofs were medium pitched and hipped with [[concrete]] tiles being used towards the end of the style in the late 60s. Front fences had a [[castellated]] top and feature piers raised above the top of the rest of the brick fence. Decorative [[iron]] was used very minimally, in gates to driveways, and balustrades to entrances.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Triple Front (With 4 Fronts) style house in Heidelberg, Victoria.jpg|Triple Front (With 4 Fronts), [[Heidelberg, Victoria]].\n</gallery>\n\n==Late twentieth century 1960 \u2013 2000==\nStyles of the late 20th century have largely been derived from the current world architectural trends, or have been imitative of previous Australian styles. These styles include Stripped Classical, Ecclesiastical, International, Organic, Sydney Regional, Perth Regional, Adelaide Regional, Tropical, Brutalist, Structural, Late Modern, Post Modern, Australian Nostalgic and Immigrants' Nostalgic. In the 1980s and 1990s most parts of Australia had a building boom which strained building supplies, so many buildings from this era are characterised by cheap and low quality materials.\n\nA good cross section of Australian residential architectural styles from this period, although not necessarily falling into one of the categories above, follows. Almost all of the houses shown in this section were built after 1960 and photographed just North of Sydney on the Central Coast of NSW.\n\nEach of these styles has a different emphasis to practicality (physical needs, layout, and views), land and environmental considerations (structural requirements for foundations, design for weather protection) and aesthetic considerations (planar, volumetric, and sculptural form, emotional and spiritual qualities.) All of these requirements and qualities should be considered when designing a house.\n\n=== Painted and rendered triple fronted brick veneer ===\n\nThis style of house has a brick facade (exterior) with timber frames supporting interior walls, usually of gyprock. Roofs are always hipped or gabled and tiled. As mentioned previously in this article, this style, without the painted and rendered brick facade, dominated suburban architecture in the 1950s \u2013 1960s. In its basic form it is a bland and unimaginative style which has been propagated by developers.\n\nDue to its familiar and cheap construction, it still is the dominant style in housing estates and many consider the style the scourge of Australian domestic architecture. The basic style has been made more interesting by rendering and painting, adding more angles, variations in roofing, porticos, verandahs, and [[bay window]]s. Large homes, two-story homes of this style have often been described as \"[[McMansion]]s\".\n\n<gallery>\nFile:PaintedMacMansion.jpg|Painted McMansion style\n</gallery>\n\n===Regional gabled cottage===\n\nThis popular style has emerged from the triple fronted brick veneer. While the house footprint and floor plan may be quite similar, the gabled cottage has a very different feel. In this style the distinctive gabled roof is a dominant design element, and a practical means of providing shade and entertaining space. Constructions can be entirely of brick (often painted), entirely timber, or a combination of brick on the lower part of the house and timber on the upper. Some houses of brick construction have featured verandahs and porticos. Roofs are usually galvanized iron and windows metal framed.\n\nWhile it is well suited to sloping blocks, this style can also be built on a slab. The use of timber cladding greatly reduces weight and construction costs\n\n<gallery>\nFile:TimberGabledRegional.jpg|Timber regional gabled style architecture\n</gallery>\n\n===Ranch\u2013style===\nThe [[ranch-style house|ranch-style]] became popular in the nineties. With conception in the [[United States]], it originated in suburban Adelaide and subsequently became popular in regional and coastal New South Wales. The floor plan is simple and footprint (of at least the street facing section) is often rectangular. Walls are usually brick, or brick and timber, and windows are often colonial style floor-to-ceiling. Roofs usually tiled with extended eaves. The garage was often integrated into the house. Some ranch style houses were boomerang shaped, others were L shaped for corner allotments.\n\nRanch style houses can be readily combined with the Murcutt/Drew style (timber and galvanized iron). These smaller ranch style houses often have balconies the width of the house.\n\n===Murcutt/Drew steel and corrugated iron house===\n\nA number of styles have emerged from the influence of architects Phillip Drew and [[Glenn Murcutt]]. The geometric play of angles is often a signature, likewise the (sometimes exposed) steel framing and corrugated iron cladding which is available in a variety of colours. Fiber cement and timber cladding is often used with the iron to create a sympathetic blend of textures.\n\nBeing of light weight construction, the steel and corrugated iron approach is relatively cheap and suitable for both flat and steeply inclined land. Interior cladding is most often gyprock but can be timber or even plywood. Butterfly roofs can also be employed quite successfully in this design. This style of house is suited for steel framed pole houses on steep slopes.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:MurcuttDrewStyle.jpg|Murcutt Drew style architecture.\n</gallery>\n\n===Pavilion style===\n\nThe Pavilion style house is characterized by a simple rectangular, box shaped volumetric style, open plan interior with glass replacing much of the wall space. Windows are often also steel framed. The transparency of the walls makes it well suited for blocks with privacy and/or views. Open patios are an integral part of living area, and like the rooms, they are orientated according to the aspect. Roofs are often low pitched roof and skillion.\n\nThe style was a favorite of architect Harry Seidler who favoured walls of rendered brick however it is also well suited to a steel, fiber cement, and corrugated iron treatment. This approach often requires the thinness of steel framing to create the desired look.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:11-13 Elvina Street, Dover Heights, New South Wales (2011-01-12).jpg|Cement rendered pavilion style architecture\n</gallery>\n\n===Federation revival===\nDuring the early-1990s, many of the design elements that characterised the Federation architecture of old were popularised in mainstream architecture. This Federation revival form is also known as \"mock Federation\" or \"faux Federation\". The style was widespread within the realm of residential housing (especially in new development suburbs) and for apartment buildings; however, smaller shopping centres and other public buildings also made use of the revival style that retained widespread popularity until the early 2000s. Suburbs of Sydney that developed in the 1990s\u2014such as [[Cherrybrook, New South Wales|Cherrybrook]], [[Wetherill Park]], [[Green Valley, New South Wales|Green Valley]], [[Cecil Hills]], [[Edensor Park]], [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]], and [[Menai, New South Wales|Menai]]\u2014are notable in the sense that large tracts of these developments contain almost exclusively Federation revival homes.\n\nThe construction of Federation revival architecture varied little from that of other basic styles, with the Federation elements merely forming the facade and decorating elements of the building. For example, the typical brick and roof tile construction, hexagonal [[turret]]s, ornate [[gable]] work, [[finial]]s, prominent [[verandah]], steep pitched roofs, and faceted [[bay window]]s served to parallel the traditional Federation architecture.\n<gallery>\nFile:(1)Field Place house.jpg|Federation revival home in [[Wahroonga, New South Wales|Wahroonga, Sydney]]\nFile:34 Dudley Avenue, Roseville, New South Wales (2011-07-17).jpg|Federation revival home in [[Roseville, New South Wales|Roseville, Sydney]]\nFile:Apartments, 8-10 Russell Avenue, Lindfield, New South Wales (2011-07-17).jpg|Federation revival apartments in [[Lindfield, New South Wales|Lindfield, Sydney]]\nFile:Apartments, Kingsway, Miranda, New South Wales (2010-07-25) 02.jpg|Federation revival apartments in [[Miranda, New South Wales|Miranda, Sydney]] (c. 1995)\nFile:(1)house_Kingsford_Sydney-3.jpg|Federation revival house in [[Kingsford, New South Wales|Kingsford, Sydney]]\nFile:(1)Federation Revival house Kensington.jpg|Federation revival house in [[Kensington, New South Wales|Kensington]], Sydney\nFile:(1)Federation Revival house Gordon Street Blacktown.jpg|A house in [[Blacktown]], [[Greater Western Sydney]]\nFile:(1)house High Street Glenbrook.jpg|[[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]], Blue Mountains\nFile:(1)Federation Revival house Frederick Street.jpg|[[Hornsby, New South Wales|Hornsby]], Sydney\n</gallery>\n\n==Contemporary styles==\nContemporary styles from 2000 onwards include post modernism, modernism and pop architecture.\n<gallery>\nFile:Pamela anderson house st kilda.jpg|\"Newman House\" in [[St Kilda, Victoria]]; completed 2000.

A common feature of the Australian home is the use of [[fence|fencing]] in front gardens, also common in both the UK and the US.\n\n[[Climate of Australia|Climate]] has also influenced housing styles, with [[balconies]] and [[veranda]] spaces being more prevalent in subtropical [[Queensland]] due to the mild, generally warm winters experienced in the state. For many years, Australian homes were built with little understanding of the [[Climate of Australia|Australian climate]] and were widely dependent on European styles that were unsympathetic to Australian landscapes. In recent times, modern Australian residential architecture has reflected the climatic conditions of the country, with adaptations such as double and triple [[Insulated glazing|glazing]] on windows, coordination considerations, use of east and west shade, sufficient [[Building insulation|insulation]], strongly considered to provide comfort to the dweller.\n\nAnother aspect of Australian suburbia is that the suburbs tend to have a combination of both [[upper middle class]] and [[middle class]] housing in the same neighbourhood. In [[Melbourne]], for instance, one early observer noted that \"a poor house stands side by side with a good house.\"<ref name=dav>Davison, Graeme.  \"The Past & Future of the Australian Suburb.\"  Australian Planner (Dec. 1994): 63\u201369.</ref> This is somewhat less common today, with home renovations, [[gentrification]] and the [[teardown (real estate)|teardown]] (\"knock down, rebuild\") method becoming more and more common in affluent suburbs, giving a broader distinction between wealthy and lower class areas. However, the teardown technique has led to home buyers purchasing land or older homes in poorer metropolitan areas and building extravagant homes on the land, which look out of place and excessive, failing to match with the remaining houses in the street.<ref name=\"dav\" />\n\n==Variation of styles==\n\nBecause architectural styles have varied in Australia over the years (from villas to bungalows and brick renders), there is a slight inconsistency in the architectural flow of the suburban streets, with one writer noting that Australian housing styles tend to comingle and coexist awkwardly.<ref name=\"Troy 2000\">{{cite book|last=Troy|first=Patrick|title=A History of European Housing in Australia|isbn=9780521777339|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2000}}</ref> This is less common in the United States of America and England, because most of the homes had been long established well into the 19th century and reflect a similar style in both regions. Home planners and architects in Australia have suggested adapting similar styles of new homes with the surrounding established homes to create a sense of uniformity.\n\n{{Quote|text=\"In Australia, the artificial background of life is all highs and lows.

Sydney was a tent settlement. Building anything more substantial was made unnecessarily difficult by the poor quality of spades and axes that had been provided and the shortage of nails.\n\nThe convicts adapted simple country techniques commonly used for animal shelters and the locally available materials to create huts with [[wattle-and-daub]] walls. So useful were the local [[acacia]] trees for weaving shelters that they were given the name ''Wattle''. Some pipe clay was obtained from the coves around [[Port Jackson]]. Bricks were fired in wood fires and were therefore soft. Lime for cement was obtained by burning oyster shells.\n\nThe first imported roofing material was [[corrugated iron]] sheeting. Roofs of this type were to become part of the Australian vernacular. For many years imported roofing was in very short supply. Two local roofing materials were available- there were extensive reed beds near the Cook's river for thatching. There was also bark which could be peeled off a number of the indigenous trees in large sheets. Methods of heating and flattening the bark were used by the Aboriginal people and these were quickly assimilated by the convict builders.\n\nThe two most significant trees, both of which grew in the Sydney area, were the Melaleuca and the Iron Bark. The Melaleuca bark, having the texture of paper, could be peeled off the tree in layers up to 2&nbsp;cm thick, a metre long and perhaps half a metre wide without serious damage to the tree. Although not particularly durable as exterior roofing, the material provided excellent insulation and was used for ceilings and lining the walls.\n\nThe resilient bark from the Iron-bark tree was adapted as a major building material everywhere that such trees grew. It was widely used as a roofing material, was weatherproof, insulating and could last for thirty years. [[Slab Hut|Houses of axe-hewn slabs]] with Iron-bark roofs continued to be built in rural Australia until WWII.\n\nAs better tools became available the Colonial builders became adept at working the extremely hard and durable timber of the native hardwood forests. The majority of houses were built of split logs rather than sawn timber. The technique employed for the construction of a wall was to chisel out a deep groove in a straight log, preferably of the local termite-resistant Cyprus pine which became the foundation. Split logs that had been adzed flat at the ends were then stood in the groove and another groove log was placed on top and slotted into place in a circular corner post. The gaps between the split logs were either packed with clay and animal hair or had narrow strips of metal cut from kerosene tins tacked over them. The interior could be plastered with clay, lined with paperbark or papered with newspaper, wrapping paper or calico. Cards, photographs, news clippings and commemorative items were often stuck directly onto the walls.\n\nThe technique of making durable hardwood roofing shingles was also developed. Where these shingles have been applied to brick houses, they have sometimes survived to the 21st century, covered by subsequent corrugated iron roofs.\n\nIn the earliest houses windows were usually small, and multi-paned with cylinder glass. When the cost of glass put it beyond reach of the home-owner, blinds of oiled calico were tacked across window openings in the winter months.\n\n'''Types of buildings'''\n\nThe simplest houses were of a single room, which, if the bread-winner prospered, became the kitchen to a more substantial residence, or conversely, became the living room with a lean-to kitchen added. Houses that grew piecemeal were generally asymmetrical, with the door leading into the original room.\n\nHouses that were planned were generally symmetrical, and very simple, usually containing 2 to 4 rooms around a central hallway. The kitchen was frequently detached and entered from a rear verandah or covered breezeway where pantry or [[scullery (room)|scullery]] might also be located. Fireplaces projected outwards from the walls of the house. Except in the case of some small inner-city Georgian row houses built of brick, houses generally had a verandah added to them, often on three sides.\n\nOne class of people who maintained the tradition of wattle and daub, with a bark roof was the [[Squatting#Squatting in Australia|squatters]] who did not have title to their land, and potentially had to move on every two years.\n\nVery few 19th-century houses of wattle and daub or split timber have survived. A small number of split-timber cottages which later became kitchens may be seen adjacent to more substantial homes, generally painted to match the house and barely recognizable.\n\nMost buildings erected in the first 50 years of Australian settlement were simple and plain. Convict huts, marine barracks, government stores and houses for officials were simple rectangular prisms covered with hipped or gabled roofs often with verandahs supported on wooden columns in the Classical manner. They were influenced in particular by the regulation British military buildings in India and other tropical locations.\n\nAt the time of the first settlement, [[Georgian architecture]] was the architectural vernacular in Britain. Craftsmen, including carpenters and plasterers were trained in the classic proportions associated with the [[Palladian architecture|Palladian style]] fashionable across Europe. Palladian ideals reveal themselves in some of the few larger homes of the Regency period such as \u201cElizabeth Bay House\u201d. [[neoclassical architecture|Neoclassism]] incorporating not only [[Greeks|Greek]] but also sometimes [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Motif (art)|motifs]], beginning in Europe about 1760, also influenced Australian architectural style.  \u201cFernhill\u201d at Mulgoa with its wide colonnaded verandah shows the influence of Neoclassicism.\nAs the Australian economy developed and settlements became more established, more sophisticated buildings emerged.\n\n===Old Colonial Georgian Style===\n<gallery>\nFile:Elizabeth Farm-1.jpg|[[Elizabeth Farm|Elizabeth Farm cottage]], [[Parramatta|Parramatta, New South Wales]]; completed in 1793; one of the oldest surviving residences in Australia\nFile:Harper's Mansion front.jpg|Harper's Hill, [[Berrima, New South Wales]]\nFile:Harrisford, 182 George Street Parramatta, New South Wales.jpg|Harrisford House, [[Parramatta|Parramatta, New South Wales]]; completed 1820s\nFile:Brislington parramatta.jpg|[[Brislington, Parramatta]]; completed 1821\nFile:Oatlands Tasmania (31995607310).jpg|Oatlands Coach House, [[Oatlands, Tasmania]]\nFile:EscholParkNSWEPhouse.jpg|Eschol Park House; [[New South Wales]]\nFile:(1)Experiment Farm Cottage 119.jpg|[[Experiment Farm Cottage]], [[Harris Park, New South Wales]]; completed 1795\nFile:Roseneath Cottage, Parramatta.jpg|Roseneath Cottage, [[Parramatta|Parramatta, New South Wales]]; completed 1837\nFile:AUS NSW Richmond Bowmans Cottage.jpg|Bowmans Cottage, [[Richmond, New South Wales]]; completed 1815\nFile:Kent Street, Millers Point, Sydney, NSW Houses (7889945778).jpg|Terraces, [[Millers Point, New South Wales]]\nFile:1772 - Englefield (5056381b2).jpg|Englefield; [[Maitland, New South Wales]]\nFile:Old Government House - Parramatta Park, Parramatta, NSW (7822329132).jpg|[[Old Government House, Parramatta|Old Government House, Parramatta, New South Wales]]; completed between 1799 and 1820\n</gallery>\n\n===Old Colonial Regency Style===\n<gallery>\nImage:PanshangerTasmania1948.jpg|Panshanger, near [[Longford, Tasmania]]\nImage:(1)Rockwall_in_Potts_Point.jpg|Rockwall House, designed by [[John Verge]], in [[Potts Point, New South Wales]]\nFile:ElizabethBayHouse4.JPG|[[Elizabeth Bay House]], Elizabeth Bay, New South Wales, also designed by John Verge\n</gallery>\n\n===Old Colonial Grecian Style===\n\n====Old Colonial Gothic Picturesque====\n{{main|Jacobethan}}\n<gallery>\nImage:1_Conservatorium_a.JPG|[[Conservatorium of Music, Sydney]], designed by [[Francis Greenway]]\nImage:1_Lindesay1.jpg|[[Lindesay, Darling Point]], New South Wales\n</gallery>\n\n== Victorian Period c. 1840 \u2013 c. 1890 ==\n\n*'''[[Gothic Revival]]'''\n'''1840\u20131880'''\n\n[[File:S\u00eddney-Australia11.JPG|thumb|right|Government House was the most sophisticated example of Gothic Revival architecture in the First Fleet colony.]]\nDuring the Victorian era, the [[British Empire]], including Australia, was yet heavily [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], and thus subject to the influence of the [[Oxford movement|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge Movement]]s, which favored the use of [[Gothic Revival architecture]]. Thus, while a local [[magnate]] may have built his home in a classical style, he would potentially fund a church in the Gothic style. Thus, during the 19th century, when Australia was expanding rapidly, two forms of architecture were very evident: Gothic and the Classical styles. Originally Gothic was for God, and the Classical for the man. Later a new \"self-made\" Australian began to emerge, unhindered by a classical British education dictating classical gentlemanly interests. This \"new\" [[self-made man]] (like his contemporaries in Britain) would often choose Gothic as the design for his home.\n\nThe great cathedrals of the [[Middle Ages]] during the Gothic period of [[ecclesiastical architecture]] formed the inspiration for this particular architectural style; not only in residential buildings, but in many commercial structures, churches and cathedrals built during this time. St. Paul's and St. Patrick's Cathedrals in [[Melbourne]] are excellent examples of the Gothic Revival period, often referred to as Victorian Gothic. Characteristics were: steeply pitched roofs often made of slate, narrow doors and windows resolving in a Gothic pointed arch at their height (known as [[lancet window]]s), diamond pane glazing to windows imitating a stained glass affect, and intricate parapets, often of a religious nature, with a cross. In non-terrace houses, the drawing room was often pulled forward, adding a bay window to the front of the dwelling.\n\n[[File:Singapore Cottage, Collingwood.jpg|thumb|right|Prefabricated Victorian workers cottages were among the simple residences to appear in the slums of major cities in the 1850s.  Rare examples like this one in [[Collingwood, Victoria]] still remain today.]]\nThe [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] style in Australia can be divided into 3 periods: Early, Mid and Late. The period in its entirety stretches from 1837 to 1901 and was named after the then Queen, [[Queen Victoria]]. Early styles featured symmetrical layouts and fa\u00e7ades, a centrally located front door and a hipped roof of corrugated iron, leading to a veranda on the fa\u00e7ade. During the 1850s cast-iron lacework came to Australia, where it made its way on to Mid and Late Victorian Homes with much the same floor plan as the Colonial Style, a central hallway with a standard 4 rooms. [[Weatherboard]]s were often used, although larger homes used red brick and blue stone. In the Mid Victorian Style, decoration began to gain popularity. The bullnosed veranda roof was introduced, sidelights were added either side of the front door, and [[terrace house|terraced houses]] were springing up everywhere, containing parapets and detailed dividing walls between the property boundaries. Late Victorian Style homes had perhaps the most decorative features in all of the known architectural styles to date, which is often referred to as Boom Style. Towards the end of the Victorian era, timber fretwork was being used more and more, which led into the Edwardian/Federation Styles.\n\n=== Queenslander style ===\n{{main|Queenslander (architecture)}}\nThe Queenslander style house is characterized by an all timber painted exterior, a timber stud frame, and a floor raised on piles for air flow in hot climate. They have wide verandahs (often the length of the house and enclosed by shutters, and roofs are gabled and corrugated iron. The street facing view is often symmetrical. The NSW Queenslander is often smaller than the original classic Queenslander and is less decorative probably due to limited supply of delicate timber detail and trades-people to build them. It is sometimes combined with the Ranch style house.\n\nFrom the 1840s, a specific style of building emerged in [[Queensland]]. The [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] style of houses are identifiable by large verandahs and large double doors which open onto these verandahs, stilts rising the house above ground level (particularly in older houses), metal roofs typically of corrugated design and the houses are always constructed of mostly wood.\n<gallery>\nFile:Queenslander1.JPG|Federation-style Queenslander\nFile:Queenslander2.JPG|Inter-war Queenslander\nFile:Queenslander.jpg|Victorian era Queenslander\nFile:Queenslander House Brisbane1.jpg|A typical 'Queenslander' style house in [[Brisbane]]\nFile:Kilcoy Old Queenslander-01+ (374769341).jpg|An old Queenslander in [[Kilcoy]]\n</gallery>\n\n*'''Early, Mid and Late Victorian'''\n'''1845\u20131900'''\nThe styles during this period were: Georgian, Regency, Egyptian, Academic Classical, Free Classical, Filligree, Mannerist, Second Empire, Italianate, Romanesque, Academic Gothic, Free Gothic, Tudor, Rustic Gothic and Carpenter Gothic. Of these fifteen styles, the following seven were normally used for residential architecture:\n\n===Georgian Revival===\n{{main|Georgian architecture}}\nA typical Victorian Georgian house of the 19th century was simple, elegant and formal in style.

From the mid-19th century in particular, as people became more affluent, they built more elaborate homes, and one of the favoured elaborations was the filigree, or screen, of [[cast iron]] or [[wrought iron]]. This developed to the point where it has become one of the major features of Australian architecture. Many homes with this feature are also considered [[Italianate architecture]], the filigree element being the wrought iron balcony.\n<gallery>\nFile:Holcombe Terrace drummond street carlton.jpg|''Holcombe Terrace''.

Their influence was long-lasting and eventually led to the Italianate architectural style of the 19th century. The style featured asymmetry and, usually, a tower of varying size. In Australia, the addition of the verandah, sometimes arcaded but later in Filigree (wrought iron), gave a regional flavour to the style.\n<gallery>\nGovernmentHouseMelbourne1 gobeirne.jpg|[[Government House, Melbourne]], Victoria;  completed in 1876\nEynesbury House, Adelaide-1.jpg|[[Eynesbury Senior College|''Eynesbury House'']], Kingswood, South Australia; completed in 1881<ref>{{cite web |author=Iwanicki, Iris; Register Historian |url=https://data.environment.sa.gov.au/Content/Publications/11526_Research.pdf |title=Eynesbury House |work=Register of State Heritage Items: Item Evaluation Sheet |publisher=Environment South Australia |date=8 June 1982 |access-date=22 April 2020 }}</ref>\nKenilworth1.JPG|''Kenilworth'', [[Annandale, New South Wales|Annandale]], New South Wales\nHeritage Kamesburgh Gardens in Brighton.jpg|''Kamesburgh'', North Road, {{VICcity|Brighton}}, Victoria\nItalianate home, Lang Road, Centennial Park, Sydney - Wiki0123.jpg|Italianate home, [[Centennial Park, New South Wales|Centennial Park]], New South Wales\nCroydon Shubra Hall PLC.JPG|Shruba Hall, {{NSWcity|Croydon}}, New South Wales\nBishopscourt east melbourne.jpg|''Bishopscourt'', {{VICcity|East Melbourne}}, Victoria;  completed in 1853\nRippon Lea.jpg|''Rippon Lea'', {{VICcity|Elsternwick}}, Victoria\n1 Toxteth Park.jpg|''[[Toxteth Park, Glebe|Toxteth Park]]'', Glebe, New South Wales, completed in 1829<ref>{{cite NSW HD|2427721|Toxteth Heritage Conservation Area|fn=C34|date=14 December 2012|accessdate=11 October 2019}}</ref>\nJesmond House.jpg|''Jesmond House'', {{NSWcity|The Hill}}, {{NSWcity|Newcastle}}, New South Wales\n(1)Italianate home Dutruc Street Randwick-1.jpg|''Earlswood'', [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick]], New South Wales\nEpworth repatriation mansion richmond victoria.jpg|''Epworth'', {{VICcity|Richmond}}, Victoria\nMyrnong Hall Acland Street St Kilda.jpg|''Myrnong Hall'', Acland Street, {{VICcity|St Kilda}}, Victoria\nWerribeepark.jpg|''[[Werribee Park]]'', Werribee, Victoria; completed in 1877<ref>{{cite VHD|1207|Werribee Park|hr=1613|ho=2}}</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n===Free Gothic===\n{{main|Gothic Revival architecture}}\nThe Gothic style gained favour from the early days of Queen Victoria's reign. Free Gothic became a popular choice for architects and their clients because it was not concerned with historical correctness and therefore gave them greater freedom in their designs. The style was much in vogue for religious buildings but was sometimes used in residential architecture as well.\n<gallery>\nFile:The Abbey j street.jpg|[[The Abbey, Annandale]], New South Wales.<ref>The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/35</ref>\nFile:AshfieldNSWAmbleside.jpg|Ashfield Castle, {{NSWcity|Ashfield}}, New South Wales, is heritage-listed<ref>{{cite NSW SHR|1020628|Ashfield Castle}}</ref>\nFile:Cloncorrick.JPG|Cloncorrick, [[Darling Point, New South Wales]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Tudor===\n{{main|Jacobethan}}\nThe Tudor style grew out of a nostalgia for older English concepts, particularly focused on the days of Queen Elizabeth I and Henry VIII. Its role in Australia began when the English architect Edward Blore designed Government House in Sydney in 1834. The style spread all over Australia and also influenced later styles like [[Federation Queen Anne]] and Inter-War Old English.\n<gallery>\nImage:Swifts.jpg|Swifts, Darling Point, New South Wales.

In Australia, this style had a great appeal to British settlers who still carried with them a hankering for things English.\n<gallery>\nFile:13 James Street Richmond.jpg|13 & 15 James Street, [[Richmond, Victoria]].

For the rich, particularly in the wealthier parts of the larger metropolitan areas, the style evoked images of French aristocracy. Although rare, examples can be found in the bigger cities. Distinctive features include towers, quoining, mansard and slate roofs, square domes dormer windows, iron cresting and rich classical details. In the Australian setting, domestic interpretations of the style often combined filigree elements such as cast iron verandahs.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Labassa.jpg|Labassa.

The style draws on elements of the Victorian era and the earlier [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne style]] of the early 18th century. The Edwardian style coincided with the [[Federation of Australia]]. Thus, the Federation style was, broadly speaking, the Australian version of the Edwardian, but differed from the Edwardian in the use of Australian motifs, like [[kangaroo]]s, the rising sun (of Federation), and [[emu]]s, Australian flora and geometric designs. Some of the most recognisable Federation/Edwardian features include red brick exteriors with embellished wood detail known as [[fretwork]]. Cream painted decorative timber features, tall chimneys were all common. Stained glass windows towards the front of the home became increasingly popular during this period. Internally, Victorian-era features were still evident, including plaster ceiling roses and cornices and timber skirting and architraves. Federation style depicted a [[Tudorbethan architecture|Tudor]] type look, especially on [[gable]]s, and Edwardian gave a simpler cottage look. Terracotta tiles or galvanised iron are generally used for roofing, which is designed with a steep pitch. The gable ends and roof eaves often feature ornate timber brackets, and timber detailing and fretwork are a common inclusion on verandahs.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.domain.com.au/advice/edwardian-architecture-in-australia/ |title=Edwardian architecture in Australia |author=Thompson, Jacqui |work=domain.com.au |publisher= |date= |access-date=29 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome{{who|date=September 2017}} consider that this style was the Federation version of the Queen Anne style. Other styles during this period were Federation Academic Classical, Federation Free Classical, Federation Filligree, Federation Anglo-Dutch, Federation Romanesque, Federation Gothic, Federation Carpenter Gothic, Federation Warehouse, Federation Free Style, [[Federation Arts and Crafts]] and [[Federation Bungalow]]. The names all indicated very similar styles with features so minute separating them. Out of the twelve Federation styles, however, only the following four were normally used{{according to whom|date=September 2017}} in residential architecture:\n\n===Federation Queen Anne===\n{{main|Queen Anne Style architecture}}\n<gallery>\nLandmark edwardian home on canterbury road middle park.jpg|Edwardian home in [[Albert Park, Victoria]]\n(1)Caerleon.jpg|[[Caerleon, Bellevue Hill|''Caerleon'']], [[Bellevue Hill, New South Wales]], the first Queen Anne home in Australia\nBurwood Appian Way 3.JPG|House in [[Appian Way, Burwood|Appian Way]], [[Burwood, New South Wales]]\n'Olevanus' 6 Appian Way.jpg|''Olevanus'' in [[Burwood, New South Wales]]\n7 Thomas Street Coogee NSW.jpg|Residence in [[Coogee, New South Wales]]\n(1) The Annery1.jpg|''The Annery'', [[Darling Point, New South Wales]]\nQueens Bess.jpg|Queen Bess Row in [[East Melbourne, Victoria|East Melbourne]], the largest Queen Anne-styled terrace in Melbourne\nEdwardian style house in Heidelberg, Victoria.jpg|Edwardian house, [[Heidelberg, Victoria]]\nQueen Anne style house in Ivanhoe, Victoria.jpg|A Queen Anne residence in [[Ivanhoe, Victoria]]\nPenshurst Church 2.JPG|''West Maling'', [[Penshurst, New South Wales]]\nFederation style mansion in domain street south yarra.jpg|Federation mansion in [[South Yarra, Victoria]]\nEdwardian terraces in park street south yarra.jpg|Federation terraces in Park Street, [[South Yarra, Victoria]]\nIngleholme, Turramurra, Sydney.jpg|''Ingleholme'', [[Turramurra|Turramurra, Sydney]]\n(1)Strathmore Wentworth Falls.jpg|''Strathmore'', [[Wentworth Falls, New South Wales]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Federation Arts and Crafts===\n{{main|Arts and Crafts architecture}}\nThe Arts and Crafts style came out of a movement to get away from mass-production and rediscover the human touch and the hand-made. The architectural style was characterised by rough-cast walls, shingles, faceted bay windows, stone bases, tall chimneys, high-pitched roofs and overhanging eaves. It was widely used in Australia during the Federation period.\n<gallery>\nImage:15 Arnold Street, Killara, New South Wales (2010-12-04).jpg|Home, Arnold Street, {{NSWcity|Killara}}\nImage:17 Waimea Road, Lindfield, New South Wales (2011-04-28).jpg|Waimea Road, {{NSWcity|Lindfield}}\nImage:SydneyBuilding0124.jpg|Home, Burwood Road, {{NSWcity|Burwood}}\nImage:SydneyBuilding0125.jpg|''St Ellero'', Appian Way, {{NSWcity|Burwood}}\nImage:SydneyBuilding0126.jpg|''Erica'', Appian Way, {{NSWcity|Burwood}}\nImage:ArtsAndCraftsHome.JPG|''Devon'', Martin Road, {{NSWcity|Centennial Park}}\nFile:(1) Hastings1.jpg|[[Hastings (Neutral Bay)|''Hastings'']], {{NSWcity|Neutral Bay}}\n</gallery>\n\n===Federation Bungalow===\n{{main|Bungalow}}\nThe bungalow style was usually a single-storey house with a prominent veranda, especially with the roof covering the veranda. It is seen as a transition phase between the Federation period and the California bungalow.\n<gallery>\nImage:SydneyBuilding0127.jpg|Casa Tasso, Appian Way, Burwood, New South Wales\nImage:SydneyBuilding0128.jpg|Ostia, Appian Way, Burwood, New South Wales\nImage:SydneyBuilding0129.jpg|Home, Appian Way, Burwood, New South Wales\nImage:SydneyBuilding0130.jpg|Home, Appian Way, Burwood, New South Wales\nImage:Bungalow667.JPG|Bungalow, Shaftsbury Road, Burwood, New South Wales\nImage:SydneyBuilding0159.jpg|Arundel, Harrow Road, [[Bexley, New South Wales]]\nImage:RangersCottage.JPG|Ranger's cottage, [[Centennial Park, New South Wales]], designed by government architect [[Walter Liberty Vernon]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Federation Filigree===\nThe filigree style was characterised by the creation of a screen as a prominent style at the front of the house. In the Victorian period, the screen was made of wrought iron, but in the Federation period it was made of wooden fretwork, which could be quite elaborate. It was widely used in Queensland as a way of providing shade and circulation of air for a home.\n<gallery>\nImage:QueenslandBuilding0013.jpg|Home, Rockhampton, Queensland\nImage:QueenslandBuilding0015.jpg|Building, Rockhampton, Queensland\nImage:QueenslandBuilding0017.jpg|Home, Rockhampton, Queensland\nImage:High Street, Millers Point, Sydney, NSW Federation home 0007.jpg|Homes, [[Millers Point, New South Wales]]\nImage:Timber terraces in madden street albert park.jpg|Timber fretwork terraces.  Madden Street, [[Albert Park, Victoria]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Inter-War Period c. 1915 \u2013 c. 1940==\nStyles which existed during the 1915-40 period include Edwardian, Georgian Revival, Academic Classical, Free Classical, Bungalow, Mediterranean, Spanish Mission, Art-Deco, Skyscraper Gothic, Romanesque, Gothic and Old English.\n\n===Californian Bungalow===\n{{main|Californian Bungalow}}\n'''1915\u20131940'''\nThis style can almost instantly be recognised by the columns holding up a front veranda area. The name is almost self-explanatory: bungalow, a rugged type of home. This led to the belief that picket fences looked appropriate at the front fence, although originally they were not used. Darker colours were originally used but, as the years went by, new brighter paint served as a welcoming change to open up the spaces and brighten up the homes. Stone, brick and timber, earthy materials were used. A gable roof faced either the front or side always.\n<gallery>\nImage:Californian Bungalow style house in Preston, Victoria.jpg|Californian Bungalow, [[Preston, Victoria]]\nImage:Belmont flats st kilda.jpg|Belmont Flats.

A staircase almost always dominated the front yard leading to the verandah.\n\n===Spanish Mission===\n{{main|Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture}}\n'''1925\u20131939'''\n\nDistinctly recognised by twisted pylons to a porch area covering the front door, usually windows grouped in threes to the side of the front door area on simpler homes. The style was influenced by the American Spanish inhabitant influenced American Architectural styles. Walls were brick in accordance with council regulations at the time, with white or cream yellowish cream [[stucco]] finish and Spanish terra cotta tiles.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Spanish Mission style house in Heidelberg, Victoria.jpg|Spanish Mission home in [[Heidelberg, Victoria]]\nImage:Belvedere flats St Kilda.jpg|Belvedere Flats.

It had a certain appeal for what was still a predominantly Anglo-Saxon population at the time.\n<gallery>\nImage:SydneyBuilding0150.jpg|Home, Bexley Road, Bexley, New South Wales\nImage:OldEnglish.JPG|Home, Robertson Road, Centennial Park, New South Wales\nImage:SydneyBuilding0180.jpg|Deanbury, Billyard Avenue, Wahroonga, New South Wales\nImage:Bonnington.JPG|Bonnington, Victoria Road, Bellevue Hill, New South Wales\nFile:Tudor Revival house, Adelaide (03).jpg|Unley Park, South Australia\n</gallery>\n\n===Early Moderne===\n{{see also|Streamline Moderne}}\n'''1930\u20131940'''\nA very modern looking style at the time, inspired by a German movement known as [[Bauhaus]], representing functional and clinical architecture. Red or cream brick walls and concrete was also first seen. Steel-framed casement sashes, with larger panes of glass and [[terra cotta]] tiled roofs with a moderate pitch. The only featured part of the house included matching decorative front fences, and a featured roof affect.\n\nThe Streamline Moderne style was a late branch of the [[Art Deco]] style. The style emphasized curving forms, long horizontal lines, and sometimes nautical elements, such as railings and porthole windows. This style was adopted into suburban architecture, most notably in the Waterfall style.\n<gallery>\nImage:BurnhamBeeches1947.jpg|[[Burnham Beeches (Australia)|Burnham Beeches]] mansion in the Dandenong Ranges outside Melbourne, completed 1933 in the [[Streamline Moderne]] style.  The architect was [[Harry Norris]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Post-War Period c. 1940 \u2013 1960 ==\n\n=== Austere ===\n{{see also|Austerity}}\n[[File:SAHT semi-detached cottages.JPG|thumb|[[South Australian Housing Trust]] late 1940s semi-detached cottages, showing little exterior modification of the original design]]\nThe Austere style reflected the lack of availability of building materials and labour in the years following World War II.\n\n===Waterfall (Art Deco) 1940 \u2013 1950===\nFashionable modern houses of the thirties in the [[Streamline Moderne]] style were sometimes described as being like ocean liners, with walls, windows and balconies all sweeping around corners. By the 1940s these details were entrenched into suburban designs. The 'Waterfall' or 'Waterfall Front' style came to be known as such from the use of descending curves in chimneys, fence pillars and other vertical elements. [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]], the Australian architect and writer, noted that three was 'the key to decorative smartness'; three steps usually being used for the waterfall effect and featured parallel lines were often in threes.\n\nDefining features of houses from this period are curved corner windows, including Venetian blinds, some rare examples of which are curved. With a slightly steeper pitched roof than the Early Modern Style, this style was generally of brick veneer cream brick but also could have dark brown glazed feature brickwork incorporated into the external walls, and under windowsills. Chimneys were either stepped or plain, and together with the round windows perhaps gave meaning to the \"Waterfall\" name.\n\nEcclesiastical, International, Melbourne Regional, Brisbane Regional and American Colonial were also styles which existed in the period 1940\u20131960.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Waterfall (Art Deco) style house in Eaglemont, Victoria.jpg|The Waterfall style and Art Deco combined, [[Heidelberg, Victoria]]\nFile:204 Monaro Crescent Red Hill ACT.jpg|House in [[Red Hill, Australian Capital Territory]], designed by [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]]. Typical of the post-war Melbourne regional style: long unbroken roof line, wide eaves, extensive windows.\n</gallery>\n\n===International style===\n{{main|International style (architecture)}}\nThe [[Rose Seidler House]] built by [[Harry Seidler]] for his parents between 1948 and 1950 in Sydney incorporated Modernist features of open planning, a minimal colour scheme, and labour saving devices that were new to Australia at the time. The house won the [[Sir John Sulman Medal]] in 1951 and is today preserved as a museum as a very influential house.<ref name=nswshr-261>{{cite NSW SHR|5045033|Rose Seidler House|hr=00261|fn=S90/05313; S96/00465 [S170]|accessdate=1 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[World War II|second World War]], architects in Australia were influenced by the development of the International style of architecture. Some regional variations developed. In Melbourne, [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]] and [[Roy Grounds]] articulated a Melbourne interpretation of the modern style. Boyd's book ''Victorian Modern'' (1947) traced the history of architecture in the state of Victoria and described a style of architecture that he hoped would be a response to local surroundings as well as the popular international style. In particular he nominated the work of Roy Grounds and in some outer suburban bush houses of the 1930s as being the early stages of such a style. Grounds and Boyd later worked in partnership.\n\nThe houses were typically narrow, linear, and single storey with a low pitched gable roof. They had exposed rafters and wide eaves. Walls were generally bagged or painted brick and windows were large areas of glass with regularly spaced timber mullions.<ref>{{cite web | author=Martin Miles | year=2006 | url=http://www.canberrahouse.com.au/pwmelbourne.html | title=The post-war Melbourne regional style | work=Modernist residential architecture in Canberra | publisher=canberrahouse.com | accessdate=2006-02-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060225055330/http://canberrahouse.com.au/pwmelbourne.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-02-25}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:RoseSeidlerHouseSulmanPrize.jpg|[[Rose Seidler House]] in the northern Sydney suburb of [[Wahroonga, New South Wales]]\n</gallery>\n\n===L-Shape 1945 \u2013 1955===\nThis style represented a change in the overall floor plan, the plan resembling a large \"L\" Shape. Usually with gabled ends to the L, with [[terra cotta]] tiles still being used, as [[concrete]] tiles didn't appear until the late 1960s. Timber or steel framed windows were used, and front-facing fences resembled the house, much the same as had been seen since the Early Modern Period.\n\n=== Dutch Colonial ===\n<gallery>\nFile:1967 Adelaide Dutch Colonial House.jpg|[[Dutch Colonial Revival architecture|Dutch Colonial]] home in [[Adelaide]] (1950s).\nFile:Dutch_Colonial_Revival_house_in_Adelaide.jpg|Dutch Colonial house in [[Mitcham, South Australia]].\n</gallery>\n\n===Timber and fibro fisherman's cottage===\n\nThe original fisherman's cottage was built in many coastal towns between the 1930s and 1950s. It was originally a simple timber framed structure of one or two rooms and a verandah which was clad with asbestos sheeting. The floors were generally raised on piles. The verandah sometimes had handsome wooden balustrade that was sometimes enclosed to make an additional room or sleep-out. Timber detail around windows and gables were often painted- cheery red being one of the most popular traditional colours.\n\nThe original cottages, being relatively cheap to purchase, are now popular for renovation. Construction is easy and owner-building is common. The older buildings require insulation in the ceiling and walls. Timber and fiber cement sheeting now replaces the original asbestos and often the interior is completed gutted to create a modern open plan style of living. Timber strap-work can be used and windows frames painted for effect.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:RenovatedFishermansCottage.jpg|Renovated fisherman's cottage.\n</gallery>\n\n===Triple front (cream brick) 1950 \u2013 1960s===\nDistinctly recognisable by their front-facing walls have 3 and sometimes even 4 front-facing walls. This led to the front entrance sometimes brought round to the side within one of the alcoves created by the multiple fronts. Roofs were medium pitched and hipped with [[concrete]] tiles being used towards the end of the style in the late 60s. Front fences had a [[castellated]] top and feature piers raised above the top of the rest of the brick fence. Decorative [[iron]] was used very minimally, in gates to driveways, and balustrades to entrances.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Triple Front (With 4 Fronts) style house in Heidelberg, Victoria.jpg|Triple Front (With 4 Fronts), [[Heidelberg, Victoria]].\n</gallery>\n\n==Late twentieth century 1960 \u2013 2000==\nStyles of the late 20th century have largely been derived from the current world architectural trends, or have been imitative of previous Australian styles. These styles include Stripped Classical, Ecclesiastical, International, Organic, Sydney Regional, Perth Regional, Adelaide Regional, Tropical, Brutalist, Structural, Late Modern, Post Modern, Australian Nostalgic and Immigrants' Nostalgic. In the 1980s and 1990s most parts of Australia had a building boom which strained building supplies, so many buildings from this era are characterised by cheap and low quality materials.\n\nA good cross section of Australian residential architectural styles from this period, although not necessarily falling into one of the categories above, follows. Almost all of the houses shown in this section were built after 1960 and photographed just North of Sydney on the Central Coast of NSW.\n\nEach of these styles has a different emphasis to practicality (physical needs, layout, and views), land and environmental considerations (structural requirements for foundations, design for weather protection) and aesthetic considerations (planar, volumetric, and sculptural form, emotional and spiritual qualities.) All of these requirements and qualities should be considered when designing a house.\n\n=== Painted and rendered triple fronted brick veneer ===\n\nThis style of house has a brick facade (exterior) with timber frames supporting interior walls, usually of gyprock. Roofs are always hipped or gabled and tiled. As mentioned previously in this article, this style, without the painted and rendered brick facade, dominated suburban architecture in the 1950s \u2013 1960s. In its basic form it is a bland and unimaginative style which has been propagated by developers.\n\nDue to its familiar and cheap construction, it still is the dominant style in housing estates and many consider the style the scourge of Australian domestic architecture. The basic style has been made more interesting by rendering and painting, adding more angles, variations in roofing, porticos, verandahs, and [[bay window]]s. Large homes, two-story homes of this style have often been described as \"[[McMansion]]s\".\n\n<gallery>\nFile:PaintedMacMansion.jpg|Painted McMansion style\n</gallery>\n\n===Regional gabled cottage===\n\nThis popular style has emerged from the triple fronted brick veneer. While the house footprint and floor plan may be quite similar, the gabled cottage has a very different feel. In this style the distinctive gabled roof is a dominant design element, and a practical means of providing shade and entertaining space. Constructions can be entirely of brick (often painted), entirely timber, or a combination of brick on the lower part of the house and timber on the upper. Some houses of brick construction have featured verandahs and porticos. Roofs are usually galvanized iron and windows metal framed.\n\nWhile it is well suited to sloping blocks, this style can also be built on a slab. The use of timber cladding greatly reduces weight and construction costs\n\n<gallery>\nFile:TimberGabledRegional.jpg|Timber regional gabled style architecture\n</gallery>\n\n===Ranch\u2013style===\nThe [[ranch-style house|ranch-style]] became popular in the nineties. With conception in the [[United States]], it originated in suburban Adelaide and subsequently became popular in regional and coastal New South Wales. The floor plan is simple and footprint (of at least the street facing section) is often rectangular. Walls are usually brick, or brick and timber, and windows are often colonial style floor-to-ceiling. Roofs usually tiled with extended eaves. The garage was often integrated into the house. Some ranch style houses were boomerang shaped, others were L shaped for corner allotments.\n\nRanch style houses can be readily combined with the Murcutt/Drew style (timber and galvanized iron). These smaller ranch style houses often have balconies the width of the house.\n\n===Murcutt/Drew steel and corrugated iron house===\n\nA number of styles have emerged from the influence of architects Phillip Drew and [[Glenn Murcutt]]. The geometric play of angles is often a signature, likewise the (sometimes exposed) steel framing and corrugated iron cladding which is available in a variety of colours. Fiber cement and timber cladding is often used with the iron to create a sympathetic blend of textures.\n\nBeing of light weight construction, the steel and corrugated iron approach is relatively cheap and suitable for both flat and steeply inclined land. Interior cladding is most often gyprock but can be timber or even plywood. Butterfly roofs can also be employed quite successfully in this design. This style of house is suited for steel framed pole houses on steep slopes.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:MurcuttDrewStyle.jpg|Murcutt Drew style architecture.\n</gallery>\n\n===Pavilion style===\n\nThe Pavilion style house is characterized by a simple rectangular, box shaped volumetric style, open plan interior with glass replacing much of the wall space. Windows are often also steel framed. The transparency of the walls makes it well suited for blocks with privacy and/or views. Open patios are an integral part of living area, and like the rooms, they are orientated according to the aspect. Roofs are often low pitched roof and skillion.\n\nThe style was a favorite of architect Harry Seidler who favoured walls of rendered brick however it is also well suited to a steel, fiber cement, and corrugated iron treatment. This approach often requires the thinness of steel framing to create the desired look.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:11-13 Elvina Street, Dover Heights, New South Wales (2011-01-12).jpg|Cement rendered pavilion style architecture\n</gallery>\n\n===Federation revival===\nDuring the early-1990s, many of the design elements that characterised the Federation architecture of old were popularised in mainstream architecture. This Federation revival form is also known as \"mock Federation\" or \"faux Federation\". The style was widespread within the realm of residential housing (especially in new development suburbs) and for apartment buildings; however, smaller shopping centres and other public buildings also made use of the revival style that retained widespread popularity until the early 2000s. Suburbs of Sydney that developed in the 1990s\u2014such as [[Cherrybrook, New South Wales|Cherrybrook]], [[Wetherill Park]], [[Green Valley, New South Wales|Green Valley]], [[Cecil Hills]], [[Edensor Park]], [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]], and [[Menai, New South Wales|Menai]]\u2014are notable in the sense that large tracts of these developments contain almost exclusively Federation revival homes.\n\nThe construction of Federation revival architecture varied little from that of other basic styles, with the Federation elements merely forming the facade and decorating elements of the building. For example, the typical brick and roof tile construction, hexagonal [[turret]]s, ornate [[gable]] work, [[finial]]s, prominent [[verandah]], steep pitched roofs, and faceted [[bay window]]s served to parallel the traditional Federation architecture.\n<gallery>\nFile:(1)Field Place house.jpg|Federation revival home in [[Wahroonga, New South Wales|Wahroonga, Sydney]]\nFile:34 Dudley Avenue, Roseville, New South Wales (2011-07-17).jpg|Federation revival home in [[Roseville, New South Wales|Roseville, Sydney]]\nFile:Apartments, 8-10 Russell Avenue, Lindfield, New South Wales (2011-07-17).jpg|Federation revival apartments in [[Lindfield, New South Wales|Lindfield, Sydney]]\nFile:Apartments, Kingsway, Miranda, New South Wales (2010-07-25) 02.jpg|Federation revival apartments in [[Miranda, New South Wales|Miranda, Sydney]] (c. 1995)\nFile:(1)house_Kingsford_Sydney-3.jpg|Federation revival house in [[Kingsford, New South Wales|Kingsford, Sydney]]\nFile:(1)Federation Revival house Kensington.jpg|Federation revival house in [[Kensington, New South Wales|Kensington]], Sydney\nFile:(1)Federation Revival house Gordon Street Blacktown.jpg|A house in [[Blacktown]], [[Greater Western Sydney]]\nFile:(1)house High Street Glenbrook.jpg|[[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]], Blue Mountains\nFile:(1)Federation Revival house Frederick Street.jpg|[[Hornsby, New South Wales|Hornsby]], Sydney\n</gallery>\n\n==Contemporary styles==\nContemporary styles from 2000 onwards include post modernism, modernism and pop architecture.\n<gallery>\nFile:Pamela anderson house st kilda.jpg|\"Newman House\" in [[St Kilda, Victoria]]; completed 2000.

They inhabit a contiguous region in the [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]] and the eastern [[Alps]], and in the modern era are geographically separated from the body of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] and [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] people by the [[Romanians]], [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], and [[Austrians]] in between. The South Slavs today include the nations of [[Bosniaks]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Croats]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], [[Serbs]] and [[Slovenes]]. They are the main population of the [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southeastern Europe]]an countries of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Serbia]] and [[Slovenia]].\n\nIn the 20th century, the country of [[Yugoslavia]] (lit. \"South Slavia\"/\"Southern Slavland\") united the regions inhabited by South Slavic nations{{spaced ndash}} with the key exception of [[Bulgaria]]{{spaced ndash}} into a single state. The concept of ''Yugoslavia'', a single state for all South Slavic peoples, emerged in the late 17th century and gained prominence through the 19th-century [[Illyrian movement]]. The [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, was proclaimed on 1 December 1918, following the unification of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] with the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe South Slavs are known in Serbian, Macedonian and Montenegrin as ''Ju\u017eni Sloveni'' ({{cyrl|\u0408\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438}}); in Bulgarian as ''Yuzhni Slavyani'' ({{cyrl|\u042e\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0438}}); in Croatian and Bosnian as ''Ju\u017eni Slaveni''; in Slovene as ''Ju\u017eni Slovani''. The Slavic root ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/jug\u044a|*jug\u044a]]'' means \"south\". The [[Slavic ethnonym]] itself was used by 6th-century writers to describe the southern group of Early Slavs (the ''[[Sclaveni]]''); West Slavs were called ''[[Vistula Veneti|Veneti]]'' and East Slavs ''[[Antes (people)|Antes]]''.{{sfn|Kmietowicz|1976}} The South Slavs are also called \"Balkan Slavs\",<ref>{{harvnb|Kmietowicz|1976}}, {{harvnb|Vlasto|1970}}</ref> although this term does not encompass the Slovenes.\n\nAnother name popular in the early modern period was \"Illyrians\", the name of a pre-Slavic Balkan people, a name first adopted by Dalmatian intellectuals in the late 15th century to refer to South Slavic lands and population.{{sfn|URI|2000|p=104}} It was then used by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Illyrian Provinces|France]], and notably adopted by the 19th-century Croatian nationalist and Pan-Slavist [[Illyrian movement]].{{sfn|Hupchick|2002|p=199}} Eventually, the idea of [[Yugoslavism]] appeared, aimed at uniting all South Slav-populated territories into a common state. From this idea emerged [[Yugoslavia]], which however did not include [[Bulgaria]].\n\n==History==\n{{Hatnote|'Slavic invasion of the Balkans' redirects here.}}\n===Early South Slavs===\n {{main article|Early Slavs|Sclaveni}}\n\nThe Proto-Slavic [[Urheimat|homeland]] is the area of Slavic settlement in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] during the first millennium AD, with its precise location debated by archaeologists, ethnographers and historians.<ref>{{harvnb|Kobyli\u0144ski|2005|pp=525\u2013526}}, {{harvnb|Barford|2001|p=37}}</ref> None of the proposed homelands reaches the [[Volga River]] in the east, over the [[Dinaric Alps]] in the southwest or the [[Balkan Mountains]] in the south, or past [[Bohemia]] in the west.<ref>{{harvnb|Kobyli\u0144ski|2005|p=526}}, {{harvnb|Barford|2001|p=332}}</ref> Traditionally, scholars put it in the marshes of Ukraine, or alternatively between the [[Bug River|Bug]] and the [[Dnieper]];{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=25}} however, according to F.

Often, the Byzantine Empire was stretched, defending its rich Asian provinces from Arabs, Persians and others. This meant that even numerically small, disorganised early Slavic raids were capable of causing much disruption, but could not capture the larger, fortified cities.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=29}} The first Slavic raid south of the Danube was recorded by Procopius, who mentions an attack of the Antes, \"who dwell close to the Sclaveni\", probably in 518.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2014|p=95}}, {{harvnb|Curta|2001|p=75}}</ref> Sclaveni are first mentioned in the context of the military policy on the Danube frontier of Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian I]] (r. 527\u2013565).{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=76}} Throughout the century, Slavs raided and plundered deep into the Balkans, from Dalmatia to Greece and Thrace, and were also at times recruited as mercenaries, fighting the [[Ostrogoths]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=78\u201386}} Justinian seems to have used the strategy of '[[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]]', and the Sclaveni and Antes are mentioned as fighting each other.{{sfn|James|2014|p=97}} The Antes are last mentioned as anti-Byzantine belligerents in 545, and the Sclaveni continued to raid the Balkans.<ref name=Byzantinoslavica-2003-78>{{cite book|title=Byzantinoslavica |volume=61\u201362 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twwrAQAAIAAJ |year=2003 |publisher=Academia|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> In 558 the [[Avar Khaganate|Avars]] arrived at the Black Sea steppe, and defeated the Antes between the Dnieper and Dniester.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=536}} The Avars subsequently allied themselves with the Sclaveni,{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=537\u2013539}} although there was an episode in which the Sclavene [[Daurentius]] (fl. 577\u2013579), the first Slavic chieftain recorded by name, dismissed Avar suzerainty and retorted that \"Others do not conquer our land, we conquer theirs [...] so it shall always be for us\", and had the Avar envoys slain.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=47, 91}} By the 580s, as the Slav communities on the Danube became larger and more organized, and as the Avars exerted their influence, raids became larger and resulted in permanent settlement. Most scholars consider the period of 581-584 as the beginning of large-scale Slavic settlement in the Balkans.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=31}} F. Curta points out that evidence of substantial Slavic presence does not appear before the 7th century and remains qualitatively different from the \"Slavic culture\" found north of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=308}} In the mid-6th century, the Byzantines re-asserted their control of the Danube frontier, thereby reducing the economic value of Slavic raiding. This growing economic isolation, combined with external threats from the Avars and Byzantines, led to political and military mobilisation. Meanwhile, the itinerant form of agriculture (lacking [[crop rotation]]) may have encouraged micro-regional mobility. Seventh-century archaeological sites show earlier hamlet collections evolving into larger communities with differentiated zones for public feasts, craftmanship, etc.{{sfn|Curta|2007|p=61}} It has been suggested that the Sclaveni were the ancestors of the Serbo-Croatian group while the Antes were that of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavs]], with much mixture in the contact zones.<ref>{{harvnb|Hupchick|2004}}, {{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=26}}</ref> The diminished pre-Slavic inhabitants, also including also Romanized native peoples,{{Cref2|a}} fled from the barbarian invasions and sought refuge inside fortified cities and islands, whilst others fled to remote mountains and forests and adopted a [[transhumant]] lifestyle.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=37}} The Romance speakers within the fortified [[Dalmatian city-states]] managed to retain their culture and language for a long time.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=35}} Meanwhile, the numerous Slavs mixed with and assimilated the descendants of the indigenous population.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=38, 41}}\n\nSubsequent information about Slavs' interaction with the Greeks and early Slavic states comes from the 10th-century ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (DAI) by Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]], the 7th-century compilations of the ''[[Miracles of Saint Demetrius]]'' (MSD) and the ''History'' by [[Theophylact Simocatta]]. DAI mentions the beginnings of the Croatian, Serbian and Bulgarian states from the early 7th to the mid-10th century. MSD and Theophylact Simocatta mention the Slavic tribes in Thessaly and Macedonia at the beginning of the 7th century. The 9th-century ''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'' (RFA) also mention Slavic tribes in contact with the [[Franks]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nBy 700 AD, Slavs had settled in most of the Central and Southeast Europe, from Austria even down to the Peloponnese of Greece, and from the Adriatic to the Black Sea, with the exception of the coastal areas and certain mountainous regions of the Greek peninsula.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=36}} The [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], who arrived in Europe in the late 550s and had a great impact in the Balkans, had from their base in the Carpathian plain, west of main Slavic settlements, asserted control over Slavic tribes with whom they besieged Roman cities. Their influence in the Balkans however diminished by the early 7th century and they were finally defeated and disappeared as a power at the turn of the 9th century by [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] and the [[Frankish Empire]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=29\u201343}} The first South Slavic polity and regional power was [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], a state formed in 681 as a union between the much numerous [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavic]] [[Sclaveni|tribes]] and the [[bulgars]] of [[Asparuh of Bulgaria|Khan Asparuh]]. The scattered Slavs in Greece, the ''Sklavinia'', were Hellenized.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=41}} Romance-speakers lived within the fortified [[Dalmatian city-states]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=35}} Traditional historiography, based on DAI, holds that the migration of [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] to the Balkans was part of a second Slavic wave, placed during Heraclius' reign.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=66}}\n \nInhabiting the territory between the Franks in the north and Byzantium in the south, the Slavs were exposed to competing influences.{{sfn|Portal|1969|p=90}} In 863 to Christianized [[Great Moravia]] were sent two Byzantine brothers monks [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], Slavs from Thessaloniki on missionary work.

In 1371, the Ottomans defeated a large Serbian army at the [[Battle of Maritsa]], and in 1389 defeated the Serbian army at the [[Battle of Kosovo]]. By now, Serbian and Bulgarian rulers became Ottoman vassals, the southern Serbian provinces and Bulgaria holding out until annexation in the 1390s. The Ottomans conquered Constantinople (1453), Greece (1453\u201360), the [[Serbian Despotate]] (1459) and [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnia]] (1463). Much of the Balkans was under Ottoman rule throughout the [[early modern period]]. Ottoman rule lasted from the 14th into the early 20th century in some territories. Ottoman society was multi-ethnic and multi-religious, and confessional groups were divided according to the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|''millet'' system]], in which Orthodox Christians (Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbs, etc.) constituted the [[Rum Millet]]. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Christians had ''[[dhimmi]]'' status, which entailed certain taxes and lesser rights. Through Islamization, communities of [[Slavic Muslims]] emerged, which survive until today in Bosnia, south Serbia, North Macedonia, and Bulgaria. \n\nIn the 16th century, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] controlled what is today Slovenia, Croatia and northern Serbia. The [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], which included smaller parts of what is today Croatia, was a crown land of the Habsburg emperor. The early modern period saw large-scale migrations of Orthodox Slavs (mainly Serbs) to the north and west. The [[Military Frontier]] was set up as the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' against Ottoman incursions. There were several rebellions against Ottoman rule, but it was not until the 18th century that parts of the Balkans, namely [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|Serbia, were liberated]] for a longer period. While [[Pan-Slavism]] has its origins in the 17th-century Slavic Catholic clergymen in the Republic of Venice and Republic of Ragusa, it crystallized only in the mid-19th century amidst rise of nationalism in the Ottoman and Habsburg empires.\n\n==Statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

These Serbo-Croatian standards are all based on the [[Shtokavian]] dialect group. Other dialect groups, which have lower intelligibility with Shtokavian, are [[Chakavian]] in [[Dalmatia]] and [[Kajkavian]] in [[Croatia proper]]. The dominance of Shtokavian across Serbo-Croatian speaking lands is due to historical westward migration during the Ottoman period. Slovene is South Slavic but has many features shared with West Slavic languages. The [[Prekmurje Slovene]] and [[Kajkavian]] are especially close, and there is no sharp delineation between them. In southeastern Serbia, dialects enter a transitional zone with Bulgarian and Macedonian, with features of both groups, and are commonly called [[Torlakian]].\n\nThe Eastern South Slavic languages are Bulgarian and Macedonian. Bulgarian has retained more archaic Slavic features in relation to the other languages. Bulgarian has two main [[yat]] splits. Slavic Macedonian was codified in Communist Yugoslavia in 1945 and was historically classified as Bulgarian. The [[Macedonian dialects]], divided into three main groups, are regarded overall as being transitional to Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian. The westernmost [[Bulgarian dialects]] (called [[Shopi]]) share features with Serbo-Croatian. Furthermore, in Greece there is a notable Slavic-speaking population [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia|in Greek Macedonia]] and [[Pomaks|western Thrace]].\n\nBalkan Slavic languages are part of a \"[[Balkan sprachbund]]\" with [[areal feature]]s shared with other non-Slavic languages in the Balkans.\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:Plos.Balkans.2.png|thumb|400px|\"Admixture plot\" of automosal SNPs in 7 major population groups, including in Balkans (middle columns).]]\nThe earliest [[Genetic analysis|genetic studies]] for population affinities were according to 'classical markers', i.e. protein and blood group polymorphisms, according to which Cavalli-Sforza's team suggested several European cluster groups: \"Germanic\", \"Scandinavian\", \"Celtic\", south-western European and eastern European. The Yugoslavs (Bulgarians were not tested) did not group into any of the above but formed a group of their own, attributed to internal heterogeneity.\n\nAccording to a 2006 Y-DNA study, most South Slavs clustered together, while western Croats and Slovenians were instead clustered with West and East Slavic populations.

South of the [[Jire\u010dek line]] were the [[Greeks]]. To the north, there were [[Illyrians]], [[Thracians]] and [[Dacians]]. They were mainly tribalistic and generally lacked awareness of any ethno-political affiliation. Over the classical ages, they were at times invaded, conquered and influenced by [[Celts]], [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]]. Roman influence, however, was initially limited to cities concentrated along the Dalmatian coast, later spreading to a few scattered cities inside the Balkan interior, particularly along the river Danube ([[Sirmium]], [[Belgrade]], [[Ni\u0161]]). Roman citizens from throughout the empire settled in these cities and in the adjacent countryside. Following the fall of Rome and numerous barbarian raids, the population in the Balkans dropped, as did commerce and general standards of living. Many people were killed or taken prisoner by invaders. This demographic decline was particularly attributed to a drop in the number of indigenous peasants living in rural areas. They were the most vulnerable to raids and were also hardest hit by the financial crises that plagued the falling empire. However, the Balkans were not desolate, and considerable numbers of indigenous people remained. Only certain areas tended to be affected by the raids (e.g. lands around major land routes, such as the Morava corridor).{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=9\u201312, 37}} In addition to the autochthons, there were remnants of previous invaders such as \"[[Huns]]\" and various [[Germanic peoples]] when the Slavs arrived. [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian tribes]] such as the [[Iazyges]] were still recorded as living in the [[Banat]] region of the Danube.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=57}} The mixing of Slavs and other peoples is evident in

The South Slavs today include the nations of [[Bosniaks]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Croats]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], [[Serbs]] and [[Slovenes]]. They are the main population of the [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southeastern Europe]]an countries of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Serbia]] and [[Slovenia]].\n\nIn the 20th century, the country of [[Yugoslavia]] (lit. \"South Slavia\"/\"Southern Slavland\") united the regions inhabited by South Slavic nations{{spaced ndash}} with the key exception of [[Bulgaria]]{{spaced ndash}} into a single state. The concept of ''Yugoslavia'', a single state for all South Slavic peoples, emerged in the late 17th century and gained prominence through the 19th-century [[Illyrian movement]]. The [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, was proclaimed on 1 December 1918, following the unification of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] with the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe South Slavs are known in Serbian, Macedonian and Montenegrin as ''Ju\u017eni Sloveni'' ({{cyrl|\u0408\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438}}); in Bulgarian as ''Yuzhni Slavyani'' ({{cyrl|\u042e\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0438}}); in Croatian and Bosnian as ''Ju\u017eni Slaveni''; in Slovene as ''Ju\u017eni Slovani''. The Slavic root ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/jug\u044a|*jug\u044a]]'' means \"south\". The [[Slavic ethnonym]] itself was used by 6th-century writers to describe the southern group of Early Slavs (the ''[[Sclaveni]]''); West Slavs were called ''[[Vistula Veneti|Veneti]]'' and East Slavs ''[[Antes (people)|Antes]]''.{{sfn|Kmietowicz|1976}} The South Slavs are also called \"Balkan Slavs\",<ref>{{harvnb|Kmietowicz|1976}}, {{harvnb|Vlasto|1970}}</ref> although this term does not encompass the Slovenes.\n\nAnother name popular in the early modern period was \"Illyrians\", the name of a pre-Slavic Balkan people, a name first adopted by Dalmatian intellectuals in the late 15th century to refer to South Slavic lands and population.{{sfn|URI|2000|p=104}} It was then used by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Illyrian Provinces|France]], and notably adopted by the 19th-century Croatian nationalist and Pan-Slavist [[Illyrian movement]].{{sfn|Hupchick|2002|p=199}} Eventually, the idea of [[Yugoslavism]] appeared, aimed at uniting all South Slav-populated territories into a common state.

Often, the Byzantine Empire was stretched, defending its rich Asian provinces from Arabs, Persians and others. This meant that even numerically small, disorganised early Slavic raids were capable of causing much disruption, but could not capture the larger, fortified cities.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=29}} The first Slavic raid south of the Danube was recorded by Procopius, who mentions an attack of the Antes, \"who dwell close to the Sclaveni\", probably in 518.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2014|p=95}}, {{harvnb|Curta|2001|p=75}}</ref> Sclaveni are first mentioned in the context of the military policy on the Danube frontier of Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian I]] (r. 527\u2013565).{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=76}} Throughout the century, Slavs raided and plundered deep into the Balkans, from Dalmatia to Greece and Thrace, and were also at times recruited as mercenaries, fighting the [[Ostrogoths]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=78\u201386}} Justinian seems to have used the strategy of '[[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]]', and the Sclaveni and Antes are mentioned as fighting each other.{{sfn|James|2014|p=97}} The Antes are last mentioned as anti-Byzantine belligerents in 545, and the Sclaveni continued to raid the Balkans.<ref name=Byzantinoslavica-2003-78>{{cite book|title=Byzantinoslavica |volume=61\u201362 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twwrAQAAIAAJ |year=2003 |publisher=Academia|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> In 558 the [[Avar Khaganate|Avars]] arrived at the Black Sea steppe, and defeated the Antes between the Dnieper and Dniester.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=536}} The Avars subsequently allied themselves with the Sclaveni,{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=537\u2013539}} although there was an episode in which the Sclavene [[Daurentius]] (fl. 577\u2013579), the first Slavic chieftain recorded by name, dismissed Avar suzerainty and retorted that \"Others do not conquer our land, we conquer theirs [...] so it shall always be for us\", and had the Avar envoys slain.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=47, 91}} By the 580s, as the Slav communities on the Danube became larger and more organized, and as the Avars exerted their influence, raids became larger and resulted in permanent settlement. Most scholars consider the period of 581-584 as the beginning of large-scale Slavic settlement in the Balkans.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=31}} F. Curta points out that evidence of substantial Slavic presence does not appear before the 7th century and remains qualitatively different from the \"Slavic culture\" found north of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=308}} In the mid-6th century, the Byzantines re-asserted their control of the Danube frontier, thereby reducing the economic value of Slavic raiding. This growing economic isolation, combined with external threats from the Avars and Byzantines, led to political and military mobilisation. Meanwhile, the itinerant form of agriculture (lacking [[crop rotation]]) may have encouraged micro-regional mobility. Seventh-century archaeological sites show earlier hamlet collections evolving into larger communities with differentiated zones for public feasts, craftmanship, etc.{{sfn|Curta|2007|p=61}} It has been suggested that the Sclaveni were the ancestors of the Serbo-Croatian group while the Antes were that of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavs]], with much mixture in the contact zones.<ref>{{harvnb|Hupchick|2004}}, {{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=26}}</ref> The diminished pre-Slavic inhabitants, also including also Romanized native peoples,{{Cref2|a}} fled from the barbarian invasions and sought refuge inside fortified cities and islands, whilst others fled to remote mountains and forests and adopted a [[transhumant]] lifestyle.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=37}} The Romance speakers within the fortified [[Dalmatian city-states]] managed to retain their culture and language for a long time.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=35}} Meanwhile, the numerous Slavs mixed with and assimilated the descendants of the indigenous population.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=38, 41}}\n\nSubsequent information about Slavs' interaction with the Greeks and early Slavic states comes from the 10th-century ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (DAI) by Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]], the 7th-century compilations of the ''[[Miracles of Saint Demetrius]]'' (MSD) and the ''History'' by [[Theophylact Simocatta]]. DAI mentions the beginnings of the Croatian, Serbian and Bulgarian states from the early 7th to the mid-10th century. MSD and Theophylact Simocatta mention the Slavic tribes in Thessaly and Macedonia at the beginning of the 7th century. The 9th-century ''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'' (RFA) also mention Slavic tribes in contact with the [[Franks]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nBy 700 AD, Slavs had settled in most of the Central and Southeast Europe, from Austria even down to the Peloponnese of Greece, and from the Adriatic to the Black Sea, with the exception of the coastal areas and certain mountainous regions of the Greek peninsula.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=36}} The [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], who arrived in Europe in the late 550s and had a great impact in the Balkans, had from their base in the Carpathian plain, west of main Slavic settlements, asserted control over Slavic tribes with whom they besieged Roman cities.

In 1371, the Ottomans defeated a large Serbian army at the [[Battle of Maritsa]], and in 1389 defeated the Serbian army at the [[Battle of Kosovo]]. By now, Serbian and Bulgarian rulers became Ottoman vassals, the southern Serbian provinces and Bulgaria holding out until annexation in the 1390s. The Ottomans conquered Constantinople (1453), Greece (1453\u201360), the [[Serbian Despotate]] (1459) and [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnia]] (1463). Much of the Balkans was under Ottoman rule throughout the [[early modern period]]. Ottoman rule lasted from the 14th into the early 20th century in some territories. Ottoman society was multi-ethnic and multi-religious, and confessional groups were divided according to the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|''millet'' system]], in which Orthodox Christians (Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbs, etc.) constituted the [[Rum Millet]]. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Christians had ''[[dhimmi]]'' status, which entailed certain taxes and lesser rights. Through Islamization, communities of [[Slavic Muslims]] emerged, which survive until today in Bosnia, south Serbia, North Macedonia, and Bulgaria. \n\nIn the 16th century, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] controlled what is today Slovenia, Croatia and northern Serbia. The [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], which included smaller parts of what is today Croatia, was a crown land of the Habsburg emperor. The early modern period saw large-scale migrations of Orthodox Slavs (mainly Serbs) to the north and west. The [[Military Frontier]] was set up as the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' against Ottoman incursions. There were several rebellions against Ottoman rule, but it was not until the 18th century that parts of the Balkans, namely [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|Serbia, were liberated]] for a longer period. While [[Pan-Slavism]] has its origins in the 17th-century Slavic Catholic clergymen in the Republic of Venice and Republic of Ragusa, it crystallized only in the mid-19th century amidst rise of nationalism in the Ottoman and Habsburg empires.\n\n==Statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

These Serbo-Croatian standards are all based on the [[Shtokavian]] dialect group. Other dialect groups, which have lower intelligibility with Shtokavian, are [[Chakavian]] in [[Dalmatia]] and [[Kajkavian]] in [[Croatia proper]]. The dominance of Shtokavian across Serbo-Croatian speaking lands is due to historical westward migration during the Ottoman period. Slovene is South Slavic but has many features shared with West Slavic languages. The [[Prekmurje Slovene]] and [[Kajkavian]] are especially close, and there is no sharp delineation between them. In southeastern Serbia, dialects enter a transitional zone with Bulgarian and Macedonian, with features of both groups, and are commonly called [[Torlakian]].\n\nThe Eastern South Slavic languages are Bulgarian and Macedonian. Bulgarian has retained more archaic Slavic features in relation to the other languages. Bulgarian has two main [[yat]] splits. Slavic Macedonian was codified in Communist Yugoslavia in 1945 and was historically classified as Bulgarian. The [[Macedonian dialects]], divided into three main groups, are regarded overall as being transitional to Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian. The westernmost [[Bulgarian dialects]] (called [[Shopi]]) share features with Serbo-Croatian. Furthermore, in Greece there is a notable Slavic-speaking population [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia|in Greek Macedonia]] and [[Pomaks|western Thrace]].\n\nBalkan Slavic languages are part of a \"[[Balkan sprachbund]]\" with [[areal feature]]s shared with other non-Slavic languages in the Balkans.\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:Plos.Balkans.2.png|thumb|400px|\"Admixture plot\" of automosal SNPs in 7 major population groups, including in Balkans (middle columns).]]\nThe earliest [[Genetic analysis|genetic studies]] for population affinities were according to 'classical markers', i.e. protein and blood group polymorphisms, according to which Cavalli-Sforza's team suggested several European cluster groups: \"Germanic\", \"Scandinavian\", \"Celtic\", south-western European and eastern European. The Yugoslavs (Bulgarians were not tested) did not group into any of the above but formed a group of their own, attributed to internal heterogeneity.\n\nAccording to a 2006 Y-DNA study, most South Slavs clustered together, while western Croats and Slovenians were instead clustered with West and East Slavic populations. Southern-Slavic populations (Serbs, Bosnians, Macedonians, and northern Croats) are\ngenetically distinct from their northern linguistic relatives.<ref name=\"R\u0119ba\u0142a ''et al.'' 2007\">{{cite journal | pmid = 17364156 | year = 2007 | last1 = Reba\u0142a | first1 = K | last2 = Mikulich | first2 = AI | last3 = Tsybovsky | first3 = IS | last4 = Siv\u00e1kov\u00e1 | first4 = D | last5 = Dzupinkov\u00e1 | first5 = Z | last6 = Szczerkowska-Dobosz | first6 = A | last7 = Szczerkowska | first7 = Z | title = Y-STR variation among Slavs: Evidence for the Slavic homeland in the middle Dnieper basin | volume = 52 | issue = 5 | pages = 406\u201314 | doi = 10.1007/s10038-007-0125-6 | journal = Journal of Human Genetics | doi-access = free }}</ref> A 2008 study concluded that except for some isolated communities, Europeans are somewhat genetically homogeneous, and individual population groups are often closely related to their immediate neighbours (irrespective of language or ethnicity).<ref>{{Citation |last=Novembre |first=J |last2=Johnson |first2=T |last3=Bryc |first3=K |title=Genes mirror geography within Europe |journal=Nature |volume=456 |issue=7218 |pages=98\u2013101 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18758442 |doi=10.1038/nature07331 |pmc=2735096|bibcode = 2008Natur.456...98N |displayauthors=1 |last4=Kutalik |last5=Boyko |first5=AR |last6=Auton |first6=A |last7=Indap |first7=A |last8=King |first8=KS |last9=Bergmann |first9=S |last10=Nelson |first10=MR |last11=Stephens |first11=M |last12=Bustamante|first12=CD}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |vauthors=Lao O, Lu TT, Nothnagel M, etal |title=Correlation between genetic and geographic structure in Europe |journal=Curr.

South of the [[Jire\u010dek line]] were the [[Greeks]]. To the north, there were [[Illyrians]], [[Thracians]] and [[Dacians]]. They were mainly tribalistic and generally lacked awareness of any ethno-political affiliation. Over the classical ages, they were at times invaded, conquered and influenced by [[Celts]], [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]]. Roman influence, however, was initially limited to cities concentrated along the Dalmatian coast, later spreading to a few scattered cities inside the Balkan interior, particularly along the river Danube ([[Sirmium]], [[Belgrade]], [[Ni\u0161]]). Roman citizens from throughout the empire settled in these cities and in the adjacent countryside. Following the fall of Rome and numerous barbarian raids, the population in the Balkans dropped, as did commerce and general standards of living. Many people were killed or taken prisoner by invaders. This demographic decline was particularly attributed to a drop in the number of indigenous peasants living in rural areas. They were the most vulnerable to raids and were also hardest hit by the financial crises that plagued the falling empire. However, the Balkans were not desolate, and considerable numbers of indigenous people remained. Only certain areas tended to be affected by the raids (e.g. lands around major land routes, such as the Morava corridor).{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=9\u201312, 37}} In addition to the autochthons, there were remnants of previous invaders such as \"[[Huns]]\" and various [[Germanic peoples]] when the Slavs arrived. [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian tribes]] such as the [[Iazyges]] were still recorded as living in the [[Banat]] region of the Danube.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=57}} The mixing of Slavs and other peoples is evident in
