The series takes place in a romanticized [[Stone Age]] setting and follows the activities of the titular family, the Flintstones, and their next-door neighbors, the Rubbles (who are also their best friends). It was originally broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 30, 1960 to April 1, 1966, and was the first animated series to hold a [[prime time#Prime time in the context of U.S. radio/TV-revenues|prime time]] slot on television.<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First Thirty-Five Years, 1946-1981 |date=1983 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-1557-5  |url=https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool/page/106/mode/2up |accessdate=14 March 2020 |pages=103\u2013108}}</ref>\n\nThe continuing popularity of ''The Flintstones'' rests heavily on its juxtaposition of modern everyday concerns in the Stone Age setting.<ref>CD liner notes: Saturday Mornings: Cartoons' Greatest Hits, 1995 MCA Records</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Flintstones, The \u2013 Season 1 Review|url= http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Flintstones-Season-1/3383|work= [[TVShowsOnDVD.com]]|accessdate= August 25, 2010|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101126142316/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Flintstones-Season-1/3383|archivedate= November 26, 2010|df= mdy-all}}</ref> ''The Flintstones'' was the most financially successful and longest-running network animated television series for three decades, until ''[[The Simpsons]]'', which debuted in late 1989, outlasted it.<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/excavating-bedrock-reminiscences-of-the-flintstones/ \"Excavating Bedrock: Reminiscences of 'The Flintstones,'\" ''Hogan's Alley'' #9, 2000]</ref> In 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked ''The Flintstones'' the second-greatest TV cartoon of all time (after ''The Simpsons'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Greatest-Cartoons-TV-Guide-Magazine-1071203.aspx|title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Greatest Cartoons of All Time|first =Rich | last= Sands|date=September 24, 2013| work= TVGuide.com}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n{{one source|section|date=October 2017}}\nThe show is set in a comical version of the [[Stone Age]] but has added features and technologies which resemble mid-20th-century suburban America. The plots deliberately resemble the [[sitcom]]s of the era, with the caveman Flintstone and Rubble families getting into minor conflicts characteristic of modern life. The show is set in the Stone Age town of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]] (pop. 2,500). In this fantasy version of the past, non-avian [[dinosaur]]s and other long-extinct animals are inaccurately portrayed to co-exist during the time of [[cavemen]], [[saber-toothed cat]]s, and [[Mammoth|woolly mammoths]].  The earliest known humans inhabited the Earth approximately 66 million years after the [[KT extinction]].\n\nAnimation historian Christopher P. Lehman considers that the series draws its humor in part from creative uses of [[anachronism]]s. The main one is the placing of a \"modern\", 20th-century society in [[prehistory]]. This society takes inspiration from the [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]] developed in the first two decades of the postwar period. This society has modern home appliances, but they work by employing animals.<ref>{{cite news|title= The Flintstones' 50th anniversary: 10 wackiest Bedrock inventions|work= Daily Telegraph |date=September 30, 2010|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8034759/The-Flintstones-50th-anniversary-10-wackiest-Bedrock-inventions.html|accessdate=October 1, 2010|location=London|first=Heidi|last=Blake}}</ref> They have automobiles, but they hardly resemble the cars of the 20th century. These cars are large wooden and rock structures and burn no fuel. They are powered by people who run while inside them.  This depiction is inconsistent, however.  On some occasions, the cars are known to have engines (with appropriate sound-effects), requiring ignition keys and gasoline.  (Fred might pull into a gas station, and say, \"Fill 'er up with [[Ethyl Corporation|Ethel]].\" Which, of course, is pumped through the trunk of a woolly mammoth marked \"ETHEL.\")  Whether the car runs by foot or by gas varies according to the needs of the story. Finally, the stone houses of this society are [[Tract housing|cookie-cutter homes]] positioned into neighborhoods typical of mid-20th-century American suburbs.<ref name=\"Lehman\">Lehman (2007), p. 25</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n\n===The Flintstones===\n*[[Fred Flintstone]] is the main character of the series. Fred is an accident-prone [[Sauropod|bronto-crane]] operator at the Slate Rock and Gravel Company and the head of the Flintstone household. He is quick to anger (usually over trivial matters), but is a very loving husband and father. He is also good at bowling and is a member of the fictional \"Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes\" (Lodge No. 26), a men-only club paralleling real-life fraternities such as the [[Loyal Order of Moose]]. His famous [[catchphrase]] is \"Yabba Dabba Doo!\"\n*[[Wilma Flintstone]] is Fred's wife and Pebbles' mother. She is more intelligent and level-headed than her husband, though she often has a habit of spending money (with Betty and her catchphrase being \"[[Charge (fanfare)|Da-da-da duh da-da]] CHARGE IT!!\"). She often is a foil to Fred's poor behavior, but is a very loyal wife to him. She is also a very jealous woman who is easily angered if there's even a hint of another woman (especially a pretty one) having anything to do with Fred.\n*[[Pebbles Flintstone]] is the Flintstones' infant daughter, who is born near the end of the third season.\n*[[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]] is the Flintstones' pet dinosaur that acts like a dog. A running gag in the series involves Fred coming home from work and Dino getting excited and knocking him down and licking his face repeatedly.\n*Baby Puss is the Flintstones' pet [[saber-toothed cat]], which is rarely seen in the actual series but is always seen throwing Fred out of the house during the end credits, causing Fred to pound repeatedly on the front door and yell \"Wilma!\", waking the whole neighborhood in the process.\n\n===The Rubbles===\n* [[Barney Rubble]] is the secondary main character and Fred's best friend and next-door neighbor. His occupation is, for the most part of the series, unknown, though later episodes depict him working in the same quarry as Fred. He shares many of Fred's interests such as bowling and golf, and is also a member of the \"Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes\". Though Fred and Barney frequently get into feuds with one another (usually due to Fred's short temper), their deep fraternal bond remains very evident.\n* [[Betty Rubble]] is Barney's wife and Wilma's best friend. Like Wilma, she, too, has a habit of spending money and also is highly jealous of other pretty women being around her husband.\n* [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble]] is the Rubbles' abnormally strong adopted son, whom they adopt during the fourth season; his name comes from the only phrase he ever speaks as a baby: \"Bamm, Bamm!\"\n* Hoppy is the Rubbles' pet hopparoo (a kangaroo-dinosaur combination creature), which they purchase at the beginning of the fifth season. When he first arrives, Dino and Fred mistake him for a giant mouse and are frightened of him, but they eventually become best friends after Hoppy gets help when they are in an accident. He babysits the kids as he takes them around in his pouch, which also serves as a shopping cart for Betty.\n\n===Other characters===\nOver 100 other characters appeared throughout the program.<ref>Romanek, Broc. [http://www.thecorporatecounsel.net/nonmember/Flintstones/ \"List of Flintstones Characters\"]. Thecorporatecounsel.net, accessed March 31, 2011</ref>\n*'''Mr. George Slate''' is Fred and Barney's hot-tempered boss at the gravel pit. Mr. Slate fires Fred on several occasions throughout the series, only to give him his job back by the end of the episode. A running gag is Slate's ever-changing first name, which was revealed to be Sylvester, Nate, Oscar, and George as the series progressed. In the episode \"The Long, Long, Long Weekend\" which originally aired on January 21, 1966, he is shown as being the founder of \"Slate Rock and Gravel Company\"; still in business two million years later, the company is operated by his descendant, \"George Slate the Eighty-Thousandth\". Note, in the early Flintstones episodes, the more recognized \"Mr. Slate\" character was known as \"Mr. Rockhead\" and was a supervisor of Fred's. Mr. Slate was a short character. During the course of the cartoon, the two men switched identities and the shorter character faded away from existence.\n*'''Arnold''' is the Flintstones' paperboy, whom Fred absolutely despises, mainly because Arnold is frequently able to best and outsmart Fred at a number of tasks and also because he often (\"unintentionally\") throws the newspaper in Fred's face. Arnold's parents are mentioned in the series, but his mother Doris, a friend of Wilma and Betty's (as evidenced in the episode \"The Little Stranger\", which originally aired on November 2, 1962), is referenced in name only, never actually appearing onscreen. Arnold's father, however, did appear in the episode \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\", which originally aired on April 27, 1962, though his name is never mentioned.\n*'''Joe Rockhead''' is a mutual friend of Fred and Barney. Usually, when Fred and Barney have some kind of falling out, Fred mentions doing something (such as going to a baseball game) with Joe. Joe was, at some point, chief of the Bedrock Volunteer Fire Department (as shown on the episode \"Arthur Quarry's Dance Class\", which originally aired on January 13, 1961). His appearance varied throughout the run of the series, but his appearance in the episode \"The Picnic\", which originally aired on December 15, 1961, was the one most commonly used.\n*[[Pearl Slaghoople]] is Wilma's hard-to-please mother, Fred's mother-in-law and Pebbles' maternal grandmother, who is constantly disapproving of Fred and his behavior. Their disastrous first meeting was recounted in the episode \"Bachelor Daze\", which originally aired on March 5, 1964. They briefly reconciled in the episode \"Mother-in-Law's Visit\", which originally aired on February 1, 1963. That is, until, she found out that she became Fred's \"nice fat pigeon\" when he suckered her out of money that he needed to buy a baby crib for Pebbles. They reconciled again at the end of the TV movie ''I Yabba Dabba Do''.\n*[[The Great Gazoo]] is an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] exiled to Earth that helps Fred and Barney, often against their will. He is actually from the future, and is quite dismayed when he realizes he has been sent back to \"the Stone Age\". He can only be seen by Fred, Barney, Pebbles, Bamm-Bamm, other small children, Dino, and Hoppy. Gazoo appeared in the final season only.\n*'''Uncle Tex Hardrock''' is Fred's maternal uncle and a member of the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texarock Rangers]]. He constantly holds Fred's future inheritance over his head.\n*'''Sam Slagheap''' is the [[Grand Poobah]] of the Water Buffalo Lodge.\n\n==Voice actors==\n\nFred Flintstone physically resembles both the first voice actor who played him, [[Alan Reed]], and [[Jackie Gleason]], whose series, ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', inspired ''The Flintstones''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/flintstones-hanna-barbera-found-shameless-rip-work-204382|title=In The Flintstones, Hanna-Barbera found a shameless rip-off that worked|newspaper=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=May 12, 2014|last=VanDerWerff|first=Emily|accessdate=October 6, 2019}}</ref> The voice of Barney Rubble was provided by voice actor Mel Blanc, though five episodes during the second season (the first, second, fifth, sixth, and ninth) employed Hanna-Barbera regular [[Daws Butler]] while Blanc was incapacitated by a near-fatal car accident. Blanc was able to return to the series much sooner than expected, by virtue of a temporary recording studio for the entire cast set up at Blanc's bedside. Blanc's portrayal of Barney had changed considerably after the accident. In the earliest episodes, Blanc had used a much higher pitch to the point of portraying Barney as a smart-aleck. After his recovery from the accident, Blanc used a deeper voice, quite similar to the voice of the [[Abominable Snowman]] he performed in other cartoons and was shown as somewhat dopier than before.\n\nReed based Fred's voice upon Gleason's ''Honeymooners'' interpretation of [[Ralph Kramden]], while Blanc, after a season of using a nasal, high-pitched voice for Barney, eventually adopted a style of voice similar to that used by [[Art Carney]] in his portrayal of [[Ed Norton (Honeymooners)|Ed Norton]]. The first time the Art Carney-like voice was used was for a few seconds in \"The Prowler\" (the third episode produced).\n\nIn a 1986 ''[[Playboy]]'' interview, Gleason said Alan Reed had done voice-overs for Gleason in his early movies and that he had considered suing Hanna-Barbera for copying ''The Honeymooners'' but decided to let it pass.<ref name=\"zehme-playboy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/jackie-gleason-1986-interview/index.html?page=2|title=Jackie Gleason \u2013 Playboy Interview \u2013 Life History|last=Zehme|first=Bill (interviewer)|date=August 1986|accessdate=July 25, 2009}}</ref> According to [[Henry Corden]], a voice actor and a friend of Gleason's, \"Jackie's lawyers told him he could probably have ''The Flintstones'' pulled right off the air. But they also told him, 'Do you want to be known as the guy who yanked Fred Flintstone off the air? The guy who took away a show so many kids love and so many parents love, too?'\"<ref>{{cite book| last = Brooks| first = Marla| title = The American family on television: A chronology of 121 shows, 1948\u20132004| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hyTuAAAAMAAJ| year = 2005| publisher = McFarland & Co.| isbn = 978-0-7864-2074-2| page = 54 }}</ref>\n\nHenry Corden's voice became Fred's after Reed's death in 1977, starting with ''[[A Flintstone Christmas]]''.<ref>\"[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/28593-Flintstone_Christmas.html A Flintstone Christmas]\".

Since 2000, [[Jeff Bergman]], [[James Arnold Taylor]], and [[Scott Innes]] (performing both Fred and Barney for [[Toshiba]] commercials) have performed the voice of Fred. Since Mel Blanc's death in 1989, Barney has been voiced by [[Jeff Bergman]], [[Frank Welker]], and [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. Various additional character voices were created by [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]], [[Allan Melvin]], [[Janet Waldo]], Daws Butler, and [[Howard Morris]], among others.\n\n===Voice cast===\n* [[Fred Flintstone]] \u2013 [[Alan Reed]] \n* [[Wilma Flintstone]]/[[Pebbles Flintstone]] \u2013 [[Jean Vander Pyl]]\n* [[Barney Rubble]] \u2013 [[Mel Blanc]]; [[Daws Butler]] (season 2; episodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9 only)\n* [[Betty Rubble]] \u2013 [[Bea Benaderet]] (seasons 1\u20134); [[Gerry Johnson]] (seasons 5\u20136)\n* [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble]]/Hoppy/Arnold \u2013 [[Don Messick]]\n* [[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]] \u2013 [[Mel Blanc]]\n* Mr. Slate \u2013 [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]\n* [[Pearl Slaghoople|Mrs. Slaghoople]] \u2013 [[Verna Felton]] and [[Janet Waldo]]\n* [[The Great Gazoo]] \u2013 [[Harvey Korman]]\n\n===Additional voice cast===\n* [[Howard Morris]]\n* [[Doug Young (actor)|Doug Young]]\n* [[Henry Corden]]\n* [[June Foray]]\n* [[Walker Edmiston]]\n* [[Ginny Tyler]] as Carhop\n* [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]] as Uncle Tex and Santa Claus\n* [[Allan Melvin]]\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of The Flintstones episodes}}\n{{:List of The Flintstones episodes}}\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Meet the Flintstones}}\nThe opening and closing credits theme during the first two seasons was called \"Rise and Shine\", a lively instrumental underscore accompanying Fred on his drive home from work.

The musical underscores were credited to [[Hoyt Curtin]] for the show's first five seasons; [[Ted Nichols]] took over in 1965 for the final season.<ref name=\"latimes\"/>  Many early episodes used the underscores composed for \"Top Cat\" and \"The Jetsons.\"   Episodes of the last two seasons used the underscore of \"Jonny Quest\" for the more adventurous stories.\n\n==History and production==\nThe idea of ''The Flintstones'' started after Hanna-Barbera produced ''[[The Huckleberry Hound Show]]'' and ''[[The Quick Draw McGraw Show]]''. Although these programs were successful, they did not have the same wide audience appeal as their previous theatrical cartoon series ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'', which entertained both children and the adults who accompanied them. However, since children did not need their parents' supervision to watch television, Hanna-Barbera's output became labeled \"kids only\". Barbera and Hanna wanted to recapture the adult audience with an animated [[situation comedy]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Flintstones, season 2 DVD documentary</ref>\n\nBarbera and Hanna experimented with hillbillies (a hillbilly theme was later incorporated into two ''Flintstones'' episodes, \"The Bedrock Hillbillies\" and \"The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes\"), [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] (Hanna-Barbera eventually created ''[[The Roman Holidays]]''), pilgrims, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] as the settings for the two families before deciding on the Stone Age. According to Barbera, they settled on that because \"you could take anything that was current, and convert it to stone-age\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Leonard Maltin interviews Joseph Barbera, 1997</ref> Under the working title ''The Flagstones'', the family originally consisted of Fred, Wilma, and their son, Fred, Jr. A brief demonstration film was also created to sell the idea of a \"modern stone-age family\" to sponsors and the network.<ref name=\"BarberaAutoBio\">{{cite book| last = Barbera| first = Joseph| title = My Life in \"Toons\": From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century| year = 1994| publisher = [[Turner Publishing]]| location = Atlanta, GA| isbn = 1-57036-042-1| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb}}</ref>{{rp|3}} Animator [[Kenneth Muse]], who worked on the ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons, also worked on the early seasons of ''The Flintstones''.\n\nThe show imitated and spoofed ''The Honeymooners'', although the early voice characterization for Barney was that of Lou Costello.<ref>Stinnett, Chuck.

In 1955, Avery directed a cartoon entitled \"[[The First Bad Man]]\" (narrated by cowboy legend [[Tex Ritter]]). The cartoon concerned the rowdy antics of a bank robber in stone-age [[Dallas]]. Many of the [[sight gag]]s from that series predated similar situations used by Hanna-Barbera in the Flintstones series by many years. Many students of American animation point to this cartoon as a progenitive seed of the Flintstones.\n\nThe concept was also predated by the [[Stone Age Cartoons]] series of 12 animated cartoons released from January 1940 to September 1940 by [[Fleischer Studios]]. These cartoons show stone-age people doing modern things with primitive means. One example is ''[[Granite Hotel]]'' including characters such as a newsboy, telephone operator, hotel clerk, and a spoof of [[Edgar Bergen]] and Charlie McCarthy.\n\nBarbera explained that selling the show to a network and sponsors was not an easy task.\n\n{{quote|text=Here we were with a brand new thing that had never been done before, an animated prime-time television show.

And no-one would even believe that you'd dare to suggest a thing like that, I mean they looked at you and they'd think you're crazy. But slowly the word got out, and I used the presentation which took almost an hour and a half. I would go to the other two boards and tell them what they did, and do all the voices and the sounds and so-on, and I'd stagger back to the hotel and I'd collapse. The phone would ring like crazy, like one time I did [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|Bristol-Myers]], the whole company was there. When I got through I'd go back to the hotel the phone would ring and say \"the president wasn't at that meeting, could you come back and do it for him.\" So I had many of those, one time I had two agencies, they'd fill the room I mean God about 40 people, and I did this whole show. I got to know where the laughs were, and where to hit it, nothing; dead, dead, dead. So one of the people at Screen Gems said \"This is the worst, those guys....\" he was so angry at them. What it was, was that there were two agencies there, and neither one was going to let the other one know they were enjoying it. But I pitched it for eight straight weeks and nobody bought it. So after sitting in New York just wearing out, you know really wearing out. Pitch, pitch, pitch, sometimes five a day. So finally on the very last day I pitched it to ABC, which was a young daring network willing to try new things, and bought the show in 15 minutes. Thank goodness, because this was the very last day and if they hadn't bought it, I would have taken everything down, put it in the archives and never pitched it again. Sometimes I wake up in a cold-sweat thinking this is how close you get to disaster.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>}}\n\nWhen the series went into production, the working title ''The Flagstones'' was changed, possibly to avoid confusion with the Flagstons, characters in the comic strip ''[[Hi and Lois]]''. After spending a brief period in development as ''The Gladstones'' (GLadstone<!-- not a typo; see the succeeding link --> being a Los Angeles [[Telephone exchange names|telephone exchange]] at the time),<ref name=\"DreamTeam\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1237649.stm|title=The cartoon dream team|date=March 21, 2001|work=BBC News|accessdate=August 13, 2008}}</ref> Hanna-Barbera settled upon ''The Flintstones'', and the idea of the Flintstones having a child from the start was discarded, with Fred and Wilma starting out as a childless couple. However, some early ''Flintstones'' merchandise, such as a 1961 [[Little Golden Books|Little Golden Book]], included \"Fred Jr.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bookstevesbookstore.blogspot.com//2011/11/flintstones-little-golden-book-1961.html|title=Homes and Offices|website=bookstevesbookstore.blogspot.com|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDespite the animation and fantasy setting, the series was initially aimed at adult audiences, which was reflected in the comedy writing, which, as noted, resembled the average primetime sitcoms of the era, with the usual family issues resolved with a laugh at the end of each episode, as well as the inclusion of a [[laugh track]]. Hanna and Barbera hired many writers from the world of live-action, including two of Jackie Gleason's writers, Herbert Finn and Sydney Zelinka, as well as relative newcomer [[Joanna Lee (actor)|Joanna Lee]] while still using traditional animation story men such as [[Warren Foster]] and [[Michael Maltese]].\n\n''The Flintstones'' premiered on September 30, 1960, at 8:30 pm Eastern time, and quickly became a hit. It was the first American animated show to depict two people of the opposite sex (Fred and Wilma; Barney and Betty) sleeping together in one bed, although Fred and Wilma are sometimes depicted as sleeping in separate beds. For comparison, the first live-action depiction of this in American TV history was in television's first-ever sitcom: 1947's ''[[Mary Kay and Johnny]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/marykay.htm |title=First TV Couple in Same Bed |publisher= |date= |accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref>\n[[File:Fred and Wilma Flintstone advertising cigarettes.jpg|thumb|Fred and Wilma advertising [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston]] cigarettes during the closing credits]]\n\nThe first two seasons were co-sponsored by [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston cigarettes]] and the characters appeared in several black-and-white television commercials for Winston<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://adage.com/article/rewind/yabba-dabba-cough-flintstones-shilled-cigarettes/240572 |title=Yabba Dabba Cough!

Originally, Hanna and Barbera intended for the Flintstone family to have a boy, the head of the marketing department convinced them to change it to a girl since \"girl dolls sell a lot better than boy dolls\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Although most ''Flintstones'' episodes were stand-alone storylines, Hanna-Barbera created a [[story arc]] surrounding the birth of [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]]. Beginning with the episode \"The Surprise\", aired midway through the third season (January 25, 1963), in which Wilma reveals her pregnancy to Fred, the arc continued through the time leading up to Pebbles' birth in the episode \"Dress Rehearsal\" (February 22, 1963), and then continued with several episodes showing Fred and Wilma adjusting to the world of parenthood. Around this time, Winston pulled out their sponsorship and [[Welch's]] (grape juice and grape jellies) became the primary sponsor, as the show's audience began to shift younger. The integrated commercials for Welch's products feature Pebbles asking for grape juice in her toddler dialect, and Fred explaining to Pebbles Welch's unique process for making the jelly, compared to the competition. Welch's also produced a line of grape jelly packaged in jars which were reusable as drinking glasses, with painted scenes featuring the Flintstones and characters from the show. In Australia, the [[Nine Network]] ran a \"Name the Flintstones' baby\" competition during the 'pregnancy' episodes\u2014few Australian viewers were expected to have a U.S. connection giving them information about past ''Flintstone'' episodes. An American won the contest and received an all-expenses-paid trip to tour Hanna-Barbera Studios.\nAnother arc occurred in the fourth season, in which the Rubbles, depressed over being unable to have children of their own (making ''The Flintstones'' the first animated series in history to address the issue of [[infertility]], though subtly), adopt Bamm-Bamm. The 100th episode made (but the 90th to air), \"Little Bamm-Bamm Rubble\" (October 3, 1963), established how Bamm-Bamm was adopted. Nine episodes were produced before it but aired afterward, which explains why Bamm-Bamm was not seen again until episode 101, \"Daddies Anonymous\" (Bamm-Bamm was in a teaser on episode 98, \"Kleptomaniac Pebbles\"). Another story arc, occurring in the final season, centered on Fred and Barney's dealings with the Great Gazoo (voiced by [[Harvey Korman]]).\n\nAfter Pebbles' birth, the tone and writing became more juvenile and ratings from the adult demographic began to decline. The last original episode was broadcast on April 1, 1966.<ref name=\"FLINSE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Hanna-Barbera_Studios/D-F/The_Flintstones/ |title=Big Cartoon Database |publisher=bcdb.com |accessdate=July 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe first three seasons of ''The Flintstones'' aired Friday nights at 8:30 Eastern time on ABC, with the first two seasons in black-and-white. Beginning with the third season in 1962, ABC televised the ''Flintstones'' in color, one of the first programs in color on that network.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC-TV To Start Color Programs|work=[[New York Times]]|date=April 1, 1962|page=84}}</ref> Season four and part of season five aired Thursdays at 7:30. The rest of the series aired Fridays at 7:30.\n\nIn the U.S., syndicated reruns of the series were offered to local stations until 1997, when [[E/I]] regulations and changing tastes in the industry led to the show's move to cable television. From the time of [[Ted Turner]]'s purchase of Hanna-Barbera in 1991, [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]], [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]], and [[Cartoon Network]] aired the program. On April 1, 2000, the program moved to [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]], where it aired until March 6, 2017 (in its last years on the channel, it had been relegated to a [[graveyard slot]]) and returned to the channel on July 30, 2018. Online, the series was made available on the [[In2TV]] service beginning in 2006, then the online version of [[Kids' WB]] until that service was discontinued in 2015. As of 2017, full episodes are only available in the U.S. on Boomerang's subscription [[Video on demand|video-on-demand]] service, with select clips made available on the official [[YouTube]] account tied to the revamped Kids' WB website. In 2019, [[MeTV]] acquired rerun rights to the series, returning the show to broadcast television for the first time in over 20 years.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/metv-grabs-the-flintstones |title = MeTV Grabs 'The Flintstones'}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe night after ''The Flintstones'' premiered, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine called it \"a pen and ink disaster\",<ref>Leonard Maltin interviews Joseph Barbera-1997</ref> and the series was among many that debuted in a \"[[Television and the Public Interest|vast wasteland]]\" of a [[1960\u201361 United States network television schedule|1960\u201361 television season]] considered one of the worst in television history up to that point.<ref>https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2012/06/vast-wasteland/</ref> As late as the 1980s, highbrow critics derided the show's limited animation and derivative plots.<ref>For example, an episode of the 1987 series ''[[Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures]]'' (\"Don't Touch That Dial!\") has [[Mighty Mouse|the title character]] mocking ''The Flintstones'', which appears in a satirical crossover with ''[[The Jetsons]]'', as stupid.</ref> Despite the mixed critical reviews at first, ''The Flintstones'' has generally been considered a television classic and was rerun continuously for five decades after its end. In 1961, ''The Flintstones'' became the first animated series to be nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series]], but lost out to ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]''.

The plots deliberately resemble the [[sitcom]]s of the era, with the caveman Flintstone and Rubble families getting into minor conflicts characteristic of modern life. The show is set in the Stone Age town of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]] (pop. 2,500). In this fantasy version of the past, non-avian [[dinosaur]]s and other long-extinct animals are inaccurately portrayed to co-exist during the time of [[cavemen]], [[saber-toothed cat]]s, and [[Mammoth|woolly mammoths]].  The earliest known humans inhabited the Earth approximately 66 million years after the [[KT extinction]].\n\nAnimation historian Christopher P. Lehman considers that the series draws its humor in part from creative uses of [[anachronism]]s. The main one is the placing of a \"modern\", 20th-century society in [[prehistory]]. This society takes inspiration from the [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]] developed in the first two decades of the postwar period. This society has modern home appliances, but they work by employing animals.<ref>{{cite news|title= The Flintstones' 50th anniversary: 10 wackiest Bedrock inventions|work= Daily Telegraph |date=September 30, 2010|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8034759/The-Flintstones-50th-anniversary-10-wackiest-Bedrock-inventions.html|accessdate=October 1, 2010|location=London|first=Heidi|last=Blake}}</ref> They have automobiles, but they hardly resemble the cars of the 20th century. These cars are large wooden and rock structures and burn no fuel. They are powered by people who run while inside them.  This depiction is inconsistent, however.  On some occasions, the cars are known to have engines (with appropriate sound-effects), requiring ignition keys and gasoline.  (Fred might pull into a gas station, and say, \"Fill 'er up with [[Ethyl Corporation|Ethel]].\" Which, of course, is pumped through the trunk of a woolly mammoth marked \"ETHEL.\")  Whether the car runs by foot or by gas varies according to the needs of the story. Finally, the stone houses of this society are [[Tract housing|cookie-cutter homes]] positioned into neighborhoods typical of mid-20th-century American suburbs.<ref name=\"Lehman\">Lehman (2007), p. 25</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n\n===The Flintstones===\n*[[Fred Flintstone]] is the main character of the series. Fred is an accident-prone [[Sauropod|bronto-crane]] operator at the Slate Rock and Gravel Company and the head of the Flintstone household. He is quick to anger (usually over trivial matters), but is a very loving husband and father. He is also good at bowling and is a member of the fictional \"Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes\" (Lodge No. 26), a men-only club paralleling real-life fraternities such as the [[Loyal Order of Moose]]. His famous [[catchphrase]] is \"Yabba Dabba Doo!\"\n*[[Wilma Flintstone]] is Fred's wife and Pebbles' mother. She is more intelligent and level-headed than her husband, though she often has a habit of spending money (with Betty and her catchphrase being \"[[Charge (fanfare)|Da-da-da duh da-da]] CHARGE IT!!\"). She often is a foil to Fred's poor behavior, but is a very loyal wife to him. She is also a very jealous woman who is easily angered if there's even a hint of another woman (especially a pretty one) having anything to do with Fred.\n*[[Pebbles Flintstone]] is the Flintstones' infant daughter, who is born near the end of the third season.\n*[[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]] is the Flintstones' pet dinosaur that acts like a dog. A running gag in the series involves Fred coming home from work and Dino getting excited and knocking him down and licking his face repeatedly.\n*Baby Puss is the Flintstones' pet [[saber-toothed cat]], which is rarely seen in the actual series but is always seen throwing Fred out of the house during the end credits, causing Fred to pound repeatedly on the front door and yell \"Wilma!\", waking the whole neighborhood in the process.\n\n===The Rubbles===\n* [[Barney Rubble]] is the secondary main character and Fred's best friend and next-door neighbor. His occupation is, for the most part of the series, unknown, though later episodes depict him working in the same quarry as Fred. He shares many of Fred's interests such as bowling and golf, and is also a member of the \"Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes\". Though Fred and Barney frequently get into feuds with one another (usually due to Fred's short temper), their deep fraternal bond remains very evident.\n* [[Betty Rubble]] is Barney's wife and Wilma's best friend. Like Wilma, she, too, has a habit of spending money and also is highly jealous of other pretty women being around her husband.\n* [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble]] is the Rubbles' abnormally strong adopted son, whom they adopt during the fourth season; his name comes from the only phrase he ever speaks as a baby: \"Bamm, Bamm!\"\n* Hoppy is the Rubbles' pet hopparoo (a kangaroo-dinosaur combination creature), which they purchase at the beginning of the fifth season. When he first arrives, Dino and Fred mistake him for a giant mouse and are frightened of him, but they eventually become best friends after Hoppy gets help when they are in an accident. He babysits the kids as he takes them around in his pouch, which also serves as a shopping cart for Betty.\n\n===Other characters===\nOver 100 other characters appeared throughout the program.<ref>Romanek, Broc. [http://www.thecorporatecounsel.net/nonmember/Flintstones/ \"List of Flintstones Characters\"]. Thecorporatecounsel.net, accessed March 31, 2011</ref>\n*'''Mr. George Slate''' is Fred and Barney's hot-tempered boss at the gravel pit. Mr. Slate fires Fred on several occasions throughout the series, only to give him his job back by the end of the episode. A running gag is Slate's ever-changing first name, which was revealed to be Sylvester, Nate, Oscar, and George as the series progressed. In the episode \"The Long, Long, Long Weekend\" which originally aired on January 21, 1966, he is shown as being the founder of \"Slate Rock and Gravel Company\"; still in business two million years later, the company is operated by his descendant, \"George Slate the Eighty-Thousandth\". Note, in the early Flintstones episodes, the more recognized \"Mr. Slate\" character was known as \"Mr. Rockhead\" and was a supervisor of Fred's. Mr. Slate was a short character. During the course of the cartoon, the two men switched identities and the shorter character faded away from existence.\n*'''Arnold''' is the Flintstones' paperboy, whom Fred absolutely despises, mainly because Arnold is frequently able to best and outsmart Fred at a number of tasks and also because he often (\"unintentionally\") throws the newspaper in Fred's face. Arnold's parents are mentioned in the series, but his mother Doris, a friend of Wilma and Betty's (as evidenced in the episode \"The Little Stranger\", which originally aired on November 2, 1962), is referenced in name only, never actually appearing onscreen. Arnold's father, however, did appear in the episode \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\", which originally aired on April 27, 1962, though his name is never mentioned.\n*'''Joe Rockhead''' is a mutual friend of Fred and Barney. Usually, when Fred and Barney have some kind of falling out, Fred mentions doing something (such as going to a baseball game) with Joe. Joe was, at some point, chief of the Bedrock Volunteer Fire Department (as shown on the episode \"Arthur Quarry's Dance Class\", which originally aired on January 13, 1961). His appearance varied throughout the run of the series, but his appearance in the episode \"The Picnic\", which originally aired on December 15, 1961, was the one most commonly used.\n*[[Pearl Slaghoople]] is Wilma's hard-to-please mother, Fred's mother-in-law and Pebbles' maternal grandmother, who is constantly disapproving of Fred and his behavior. Their disastrous first meeting was recounted in the episode \"Bachelor Daze\", which originally aired on March 5, 1964. They briefly reconciled in the episode \"Mother-in-Law's Visit\", which originally aired on February 1, 1963. That is, until, she found out that she became Fred's \"nice fat pigeon\" when he suckered her out of money that he needed to buy a baby crib for Pebbles. They reconciled again at the end of the TV movie ''I Yabba Dabba Do''.\n*[[The Great Gazoo]] is an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] exiled to Earth that helps Fred and Barney, often against their will. He is actually from the future, and is quite dismayed when he realizes he has been sent back to \"the Stone Age\". He can only be seen by Fred, Barney, Pebbles, Bamm-Bamm, other small children, Dino, and Hoppy. Gazoo appeared in the final season only.\n*'''Uncle Tex Hardrock''' is Fred's maternal uncle and a member of the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texarock Rangers]]. He constantly holds Fred's future inheritance over his head.\n*'''Sam Slagheap''' is the [[Grand Poobah]] of the Water Buffalo Lodge.\n\n==Voice actors==\n\nFred Flintstone physically resembles both the first voice actor who played him, [[Alan Reed]], and [[Jackie Gleason]], whose series, ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', inspired ''The Flintstones''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/flintstones-hanna-barbera-found-shameless-rip-work-204382|title=In The Flintstones, Hanna-Barbera found a shameless rip-off that worked|newspaper=[[The A.V.

Blanc was able to return to the series much sooner than expected, by virtue of a temporary recording studio for the entire cast set up at Blanc's bedside. Blanc's portrayal of Barney had changed considerably after the accident. In the earliest episodes, Blanc had used a much higher pitch to the point of portraying Barney as a smart-aleck. After his recovery from the accident, Blanc used a deeper voice, quite similar to the voice of the [[Abominable Snowman]] he performed in other cartoons and was shown as somewhat dopier than before.\n\nReed based Fred's voice upon Gleason's ''Honeymooners'' interpretation of [[Ralph Kramden]], while Blanc, after a season of using a nasal, high-pitched voice for Barney, eventually adopted a style of voice similar to that used by [[Art Carney]] in his portrayal of [[Ed Norton (Honeymooners)|Ed Norton]]. The first time the Art Carney-like voice was used was for a few seconds in \"The Prowler\" (the third episode produced).\n\nIn a 1986 ''[[Playboy]]'' interview, Gleason said Alan Reed had done voice-overs for Gleason in his early movies and that he had considered suing Hanna-Barbera for copying ''The Honeymooners'' but decided to let it pass.<ref name=\"zehme-playboy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/jackie-gleason-1986-interview/index.html?page=2|title=Jackie Gleason \u2013 Playboy Interview \u2013 Life History|last=Zehme|first=Bill (interviewer)|date=August 1986|accessdate=July 25, 2009}}</ref> According to [[Henry Corden]], a voice actor and a friend of Gleason's, \"Jackie's lawyers told him he could probably have ''The Flintstones'' pulled right off the air.

Although these programs were successful, they did not have the same wide audience appeal as their previous theatrical cartoon series ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'', which entertained both children and the adults who accompanied them. However, since children did not need their parents' supervision to watch television, Hanna-Barbera's output became labeled \"kids only\". Barbera and Hanna wanted to recapture the adult audience with an animated [[situation comedy]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Flintstones, season 2 DVD documentary</ref>\n\nBarbera and Hanna experimented with hillbillies (a hillbilly theme was later incorporated into two ''Flintstones'' episodes, \"The Bedrock Hillbillies\" and \"The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes\"), [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] (Hanna-Barbera eventually created ''[[The Roman Holidays]]''), pilgrims, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] as the settings for the two families before deciding on the Stone Age. According to Barbera, they settled on that because \"you could take anything that was current, and convert it to stone-age\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Leonard Maltin interviews Joseph Barbera, 1997</ref> Under the working title ''The Flagstones'', the family originally consisted of Fred, Wilma, and their son, Fred, Jr. A brief demonstration film was also created to sell the idea of a \"modern stone-age family\" to sponsors and the network.<ref name=\"BarberaAutoBio\">{{cite book| last = Barbera| first = Joseph| title = My Life in \"Toons\": From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century| year = 1994| publisher = [[Turner Publishing]]| location = Atlanta, GA| isbn = 1-57036-042-1| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb}}</ref>{{rp|3}} Animator [[Kenneth Muse]], who worked on the ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons, also worked on the early seasons of ''The Flintstones''.\n\nThe show imitated and spoofed ''The Honeymooners'', although the early voice characterization for Barney was that of Lou Costello.<ref>Stinnett, Chuck.

In 1955, Avery directed a cartoon entitled \"[[The First Bad Man]]\" (narrated by cowboy legend [[Tex Ritter]]). The cartoon concerned the rowdy antics of a bank robber in stone-age [[Dallas]]. Many of the [[sight gag]]s from that series predated similar situations used by Hanna-Barbera in the Flintstones series by many years. Many students of American animation point to this cartoon as a progenitive seed of the Flintstones.\n\nThe concept was also predated by the [[Stone Age Cartoons]] series of 12 animated cartoons released from January 1940 to September 1940 by [[Fleischer Studios]]. These cartoons show stone-age people doing modern things with primitive means. One example is ''[[Granite Hotel]]'' including characters such as a newsboy, telephone operator, hotel clerk, and a spoof of [[Edgar Bergen]] and Charlie McCarthy.\n\nBarbera explained that selling the show to a network and sponsors was not an easy task.\n\n{{quote|text=Here we were with a brand new thing that had never been done before, an animated prime-time television show. So we developed two storyboards; one was they had a helicopter of some kind and they went to the opera or whatever, and the other was Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble fighting over a swimming pool. So I go back to New York with a portfolio and two half-hour boards. And no-one would even believe that you'd dare to suggest a thing like that, I mean they looked at you and they'd think you're crazy. But slowly the word got out, and I used the presentation which took almost an hour and a half. I would go to the other two boards and tell them what they did, and do all the voices and the sounds and so-on, and I'd stagger back to the hotel and I'd collapse. The phone would ring like crazy, like one time I did [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|Bristol-Myers]], the whole company was there. When I got through I'd go back to the hotel the phone would ring and say \"the president wasn't at that meeting, could you come back and do it for him.\" So I had many of those, one time I had two agencies, they'd fill the room I mean God about 40 people, and I did this whole show. I got to know where the laughs were, and where to hit it, nothing; dead, dead, dead. So one of the people at Screen Gems said \"This is the worst, those guys....\" he was so angry at them. What it was, was that there were two agencies there, and neither one was going to let the other one know they were enjoying it. But I pitched it for eight straight weeks and nobody bought it. So after sitting in New York just wearing out, you know really wearing out. Pitch, pitch, pitch, sometimes five a day. So finally on the very last day I pitched it to ABC, which was a young daring network willing to try new things, and bought the show in 15 minutes. Thank goodness, because this was the very last day and if they hadn't bought it, I would have taken everything down, put it in the archives and never pitched it again. Sometimes I wake up in a cold-sweat thinking this is how close you get to disaster.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>}}\n\nWhen the series went into production, the working title ''The Flagstones'' was changed, possibly to avoid confusion with the Flagstons, characters in the comic strip ''[[Hi and Lois]]''.

However, some early ''Flintstones'' merchandise, such as a 1961 [[Little Golden Books|Little Golden Book]], included \"Fred Jr.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bookstevesbookstore.blogspot.com//2011/11/flintstones-little-golden-book-1961.html|title=Homes and Offices|website=bookstevesbookstore.blogspot.com|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDespite the animation and fantasy setting, the series was initially aimed at adult audiences, which was reflected in the comedy writing, which, as noted, resembled the average primetime sitcoms of the era, with the usual family issues resolved with a laugh at the end of each episode, as well as the inclusion of a [[laugh track]]. Hanna and Barbera hired many writers from the world of live-action, including two of Jackie Gleason's writers, Herbert Finn and Sydney Zelinka, as well as relative newcomer [[Joanna Lee (actor)|Joanna Lee]] while still using traditional animation story men such as [[Warren Foster]] and [[Michael Maltese]].\n\n''The Flintstones'' premiered on September 30, 1960, at 8:30 pm Eastern time, and quickly became a hit. It was the first American animated show to depict two people of the opposite sex (Fred and Wilma; Barney and Betty) sleeping together in one bed, although Fred and Wilma are sometimes depicted as sleeping in separate beds. For comparison, the first live-action depiction of this in American TV history was in television's first-ever sitcom: 1947's ''[[Mary Kay and Johnny]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/marykay.htm |title=First TV Couple in Same Bed |publisher= |date= |accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref>\n[[File:Fred and Wilma Flintstone advertising cigarettes.jpg|thumb|Fred and Wilma advertising [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston]] cigarettes during the closing credits]]\n\nThe first two seasons were co-sponsored by [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston cigarettes]] and the characters appeared in several black-and-white television commercials for Winston<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://adage.com/article/rewind/yabba-dabba-cough-flintstones-shilled-cigarettes/240572 |title=Yabba Dabba Cough!

Originally, Hanna and Barbera intended for the Flintstone family to have a boy, the head of the marketing department convinced them to change it to a girl since \"girl dolls sell a lot better than boy dolls\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Although most ''Flintstones'' episodes were stand-alone storylines, Hanna-Barbera created a [[story arc]] surrounding the birth of [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]]. Beginning with the episode \"The Surprise\", aired midway through the third season (January 25, 1963), in which Wilma reveals her pregnancy to Fred, the arc continued through the time leading up to Pebbles' birth in the episode \"Dress Rehearsal\" (February 22, 1963), and then continued with several episodes showing Fred and Wilma adjusting to the world of parenthood. Around this time, Winston pulled out their sponsorship and [[Welch's]] (grape juice and grape jellies) became the primary sponsor, as the show's audience began to shift younger. The integrated commercials for Welch's products feature Pebbles asking for grape juice in her toddler dialect, and Fred explaining to Pebbles Welch's unique process for making the jelly, compared to the competition. Welch's also produced a line of grape jelly packaged in jars which were reusable as drinking glasses, with painted scenes featuring the Flintstones and characters from the show. In Australia, the [[Nine Network]] ran a \"Name the Flintstones' baby\" competition during the 'pregnancy' episodes\u2014few Australian viewers were expected to have a U.S. connection giving them information about past ''Flintstone'' episodes. An American won the contest and received an all-expenses-paid trip to tour Hanna-Barbera Studios.\nAnother arc occurred in the fourth season, in which the Rubbles, depressed over being unable to have children of their own (making ''The Flintstones'' the first animated series in history to address the issue of [[infertility]], though subtly), adopt Bamm-Bamm. The 100th episode made (but the 90th to air), \"Little Bamm-Bamm Rubble\" (October 3, 1963), established how Bamm-Bamm was adopted. Nine episodes were produced before it but aired afterward, which explains why Bamm-Bamm was not seen again until episode 101, \"Daddies Anonymous\" (Bamm-Bamm was in a teaser on episode 98, \"Kleptomaniac Pebbles\"). Another story arc, occurring in the final season, centered on Fred and Barney's dealings with the Great Gazoo (voiced by [[Harvey Korman]]).\n\nAfter Pebbles' birth, the tone and writing became more juvenile and ratings from the adult demographic began to decline. The last original episode was broadcast on April 1, 1966.<ref name=\"FLINSE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Hanna-Barbera_Studios/D-F/The_Flintstones/ |title=Big Cartoon Database |publisher=bcdb.com |accessdate=July 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe first three seasons of ''The Flintstones'' aired Friday nights at 8:30 Eastern time on ABC, with the first two seasons in black-and-white. Beginning with the third season in 1962, ABC televised the ''Flintstones'' in color, one of the first programs in color on that network.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC-TV To Start Color Programs|work=[[New York Times]]|date=April 1, 1962|page=84}}</ref> Season four and part of season five aired Thursdays at 7:30. The rest of the series aired Fridays at 7:30.\n\nIn the U.S., syndicated reruns of the series were offered to local stations until 1997, when [[E/I]] regulations and changing tastes in the industry led to the show's move to cable television. From the time of [[Ted Turner]]'s purchase of Hanna-Barbera in 1991, [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]], [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]], and [[Cartoon Network]] aired the program. On April 1, 2000, the program moved to [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]], where it aired until March 6, 2017 (in its last years on the channel, it had been relegated to a [[graveyard slot]]) and returned to the channel on July 30, 2018.

It is part of the [[University of North Carolina|University of North Carolina system]]. UNCG, like all members of the UNC system, is a stand-alone university and awards its own degrees. UNCG is accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges]] to award baccalaureate, masters, specialist and doctoral degrees.\n\nThe university offers more than 100 undergraduate, 61 master's and 26 doctoral programs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ire.uncg.edu/pages/factbook/2009-10/PDFs/history/2009Profile.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720092825/http://ire.uncg.edu/pages/factbook/2009-10/PDFs/history/2009Profile.PDF |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The university's academic schools and programs include the College of Arts & Sciences, the Joseph M. Bryan School of Business & Economics, the School of Education, the School of Health and Human Sciences, the Joint School of Nanoscience & Nanoengineering (one of the first such schools in the nation), the [[UNCG College of Visual and Performing Arts|School of Visual and Performing Arts]], the School of Nursing, Continual Learning, Graduate School, Warren Ashby Residential College and Lloyd International Honors College. The university is also home to the [[Weatherspoon Art Museum]], which features one of the largest collections of modern American art in the country.\n\nThe university holds two classifications from the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]], as a \"[[research university]] with high research activity\" and for \"community engagement\" in curriculum, outreach and partnerships.\n\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Statenormalandindustrial.jpg|thumb|350px|right|North Carolina State Normal and Industrial School, ca. 1906.]]\n\nCredit for the founding of UNCG goes mainly to [[Charles Duncan McIver]], a crusader for the cause of women's education. McIver served the institution as its first chief executive officer with the title of President. This position has also seen various names, with the administrator being known as the Dean of Administration after 1934 and Chancellor from 1945 to present.\n\nThe school was established as a [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's college]] by legislative enactment on February 18, 1891, as the State Normal and Industrial School and opened October 5, 1892. The school provided instruction in business, domestic science, and teaching with a student body of 223 and a faculty of 15 in its first year. R. S. Pullen and R. T. Gray gave the original {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} site in Greensboro, N.C. where the first building was erected with state funds totaling $30,000. It is the first and only public university in North Carolina founded for the purpose of educating women. In 1949, it became the largest all-female institution in the United States.\n\nThe school has seen many names over the years, changing from the \"State Normal and Industrial School\" to the State Normal and Industrial College in 1896, and again in 1919 to North Carolina College for Women. In 1932, it changed to the Woman's College of the University of North Carolina, when it became one of the three charter institutions of the Consolidated University of North Carolina, and changed again to the University of North Carolina at Greensboro when men were first admitted to the school in 1963. It is remembered fondly by many graduates of the Woman's College simply as \"the W.C.\"\n\nUNCG is in the midst of expanding beyond its traditional borders onto Gate City Boulevard, a major city thoroughfare, with the construction of an 800-bed residence hall for students, and this is just the beginning of the $200 million project on Gate City Boulevard.  The new construction will be a mixed-use development, with space for retail and restaurants, along with student residence halls and a new student recreation center. The university's expansion into the West Lee Street Corridor was triggered by UNCG's strategic housing plan, which calls for the university to increase the percentage of undergraduates living in university housing from 30 percent to more than 40 percent over the next decade.\n\nIn addition to providing room for UNCG's growth, the expansion also syncs with Greensboro's revitalization plan for the Gate City Boulevard corridor, a main entry point and thoroughfare in the city. The project will also spur economic development in the area. Projections estimate the development will generate more than $590 million in new spending between 2014 and 2023, create 945 new jobs and boost local property revenues by $7.5 million. The expansion has not been without controversy, especially the $91 million athletic center. The athletic center is financed by a mandatory annual fee of $435 charged every UNCG student.<ref>\"UNCG Students, Faculty Balk at Facility Spending\" ''Carolina Journal Online'' December 5, 2013, http://www.carolinajournal.com/exclusives/display_exclusive.html?id=10675, accessed December 12, 2014</ref>\n\nA personnel scandal erupted in 2014.

Brown, Greensboro: An Architectural Record (1995)</ref> Other features include a statue of [[Minerva]], the goddess of wisdom, located to the east of Elliott University Center. Minerva has been a part of campus from the first diploma bearing her likeness in 1894 to the statue erected near the center in 2003. Minerva also inspired the university's new graphic identity program, which was launched in 2004.\n\nOther landmarks include \"Charlie,\" a statue of the university's founder [[Charles Duncan McIver]] outside Jackson Library. The white tower stacks of the Jackson Library and the Spartan water tower are recognizable structures in the Greensboro community, and the campus is also home to \"the Rawk\" and the clock tower\u2014two campus landmarks\u2014and school traditions (''See Traditions below''). A new bell tower at the corner of College Ave. and Spring Garden St. was completed in 2005.\n\nThe Fountain is another landmark on UNCG's campus and is a common meeting place for student groups. Visible from parts of the quad all the way to the Elliot University Center and from above in the Jackson Library and \"the Caf,\" the large steps and platform around the fountain are frequently home to demonstrations, performances, and fraternity/sorority functions.\n\nThe campus is in close proximity (within 1.5 hours drive) to many other universities \u2014 [[North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University]], [[Duke University|Duke]], [[Elon University|Elon]], [[High Point University]], [[NC State]], [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC-Chapel Hill]], [[UNC Charlotte]], [[Wake Forest University|Wake Forest]], and [[Winston-Salem State University]]. The university is located about halfway between [[Washington, DC]] and [[Atlanta, Georgia]].\n\n==Athletics==\n{{main|UNC Greensboro Spartans}}\n\nThe intercollegiate athletics program at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro reaches as far back as the late 1940s during the days of the WCUNC, with students participating in national golf tournaments in 1948 and the school hosting the national tournaments for women's golf (1954) and tennis (1965). During the 1980s, all Spartan teams competed in Division III (non-scholarship) and then Division II (scholarship) of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]], and all teams have competed in Division 1 since Fall 1991. Between 1982\u20131987 the Men's Soccer team won the NCAA Division III national championship title every year except for 1984. Today UNCG competes in the [[Southern Conference]], which is made up of 10 schools across five states in the Southeast.\n\nThe 18 athletic teams currently at UNCG include: Football, Baseball, Men's Basketball, Women's Basketball, Men's Cross Country, Women's Cross Country, Men's Golf, Women's Golf, Men's Soccer, Women's Soccer, Softball, Men's Indoor Track, Women's Indoor Track, Men's Tennis, Women's Tennis, Men's Track, Women's Track, Women's Volleyball.  Wrestling was dropped in the spring of 2011. Although not considered official sports teams, the Athletic Department also includes the UNCG Cheerleading Squad and the UNCG Dance Team, the Spartan Gs.\n\nUNCG's men's basketball team moved into a \"new\" home in 2009\u201310, making the [[Greensboro Coliseum]] its home court. The move was announced by UNCG chancellor Dr. Linda Brady on December 5, 2008. As a preview of things to come, UNCG hosted Davidson in its new venue two months later and drew a crowd of 11,687. On December 29, 2010 a UNCG record attendance of 22,178 watched the Spartans host the Duke Blue Devils. At full capacity, the building holds more than 23,000 fans for basketball giving UNCG the ability to have potentially one of the largest basketball arenas in the country. UNCG utilitizes a variety of configurations for its contests with a minimum capacity of 7,617. As part of the move, the Coliseum remodeled a floor into a Spartan \"home floor\" and completely renovated a massive locker room space for the team, complete with training room, meeting facilities, coaches offices and a players' lounge. The team is coached by former [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] player [[Wes Miller]], who at the time of his appointment in 2012 was the youngest head coach in Division I.\n\nFormer UNCG women's basketball coach Lynne Agee, who retired following the 2010\u20132011 season, ranks among the most successful coaches in intercollegiate women's basketball history. Currently, she is one of just 45 coaches in the history of the women's game to have engineered more than 600 victories; see [[list of college women's basketball coaches with 600 wins]]. Under Agee's guidance, UNCG reached the 20-win plateau 16 times. The Spartans also earned berths into the Division I national tournament once, the Division II tournament once and the Division III tournament seven times. With Agee at the helm, UNCG became one of only 10 teams nationally (all divisions) to reach the NCAA tournament each of the first seven years it was held (1982\u20131988). With UNCG's 1998 NCAA appearance, Agee became the first women's coach in history to take teams to the NCAA tournament in all three divisions. UNCG is now coached by [[Roxboro, North Carolina|Roxboro]], [[Person County]] native and former WNBA player [[Wendy Palmer]].\n\n===The Blue Crew===\nThe Blue Crew is a student organization dedicated to cheering on the Spartans at athletic events.\n<gallery>\nImage:Blue Crew Soccer.jpg|The Blue Crew at a soccer game\n\nImage:Blue_Crew.jpg|The Blue Crew at a basketball game\nImage:Blue_Crew_2.jpg|Blue Crew at a basketball game\nImage:Blue_Crew_3.jpg|Blue Crew\n</gallery>\n\n==Clubs and traditions==\nUNCG is home to a large number of diverse and active sports and student organizations from Greek life to a radio station, and some traditions unique to the school.\n\n===Clubs===\nIn Fall 2010, the Clubs and Organizations affiliated with UNCG included 36 Honor Societies and 20 Fraternities and Sororities. The university also has an active [[student government]] association, founded in 1910,<ref>[http://www.uncgsga.org/?page_id=2 UNCG Student Government Association, \"About Us\"]</ref> Campus Activities Board (CAB), and several foreign culture groups, a Neo-Black Society, PRIDE! (An [[LGBT]] support and acceptance group.), Queer Student Collective, The Science Fiction Fantasy Federation, and various performing arts, religious and service programs. Student media groups also produce UNCG's newspaper The Carolinian, CORADDI Fine Arts Magazine, and [[WUAG]] 103.1 Campus Radio Station. The campus also includes numerous political organizations for students, including the College Republicans, College Democrats, [[College Libertarians]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncg.edu/reg/Catalog/0607/UnivComm/organizations.html |title=UNCG 2006\u201307 UGB: The University Community |publisher=Uncg.edu |date=March 15, 2007 |accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.lp.org/campus-organizations#state-North%20Carolina Libertarian Party: Campus Organizations]</ref> and the International Socialist Organization and other activist groups including STAND, an organization focused on the situation in the Darfur region of Sudan.\n\n===Club sports===\nAll clubs are recognized student organizations through the UNCG's Office of Campus Activities & Programs.\n\nThis is a list of clubs that are members of the Club Sports Council:<ref>{{cite web|author=Club Sportscampusrec.uncg.edu/clubs/ |url=http://campusrec.uncg.edu/clubs/current/ |title=Current Clubs - UNC Greensboro Campus Recreation |publisher=Campusrec.uncg.edu |date= |accessdate=April 8, 2016}}</ref>\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Basketball]] (Women's)\n*[[Bass Fishing]]\n*[[Equestrianism|Equestrian]]\n*[[Fencing]]\n*[[American football|Football]]\n*[[Lacrosse]] (Men's)\n*[[Lacrosse]] (Women's)\n*[[Muggle Quidditch|Quidditch]]\n*[[Rugby football|Rugby]] (Men's)\n*[[Rugby football|Rugby]] (Women's)\n*[[Running]]\n*[[Soccer]] (Men's)\n*[[Soccer]] (Women's)\n*[[Softball]]\n*[[Swimming (sport)|Swimming]]\n*[[Tennis]]\n*[[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate Frisbee]] (Women's)\n*[[Volleyball]]\n {{Div col end}}\n\n===Greek life===\nUNCG is home to 19 social fraternities and sororities that each have their own traditions.

Unofficial rules govern the use of the Rawk, and students know not to use foul language and that messages must be left for at least 24 hours before being painted over. Students know when they can begin to paint over the previous message on The Rawk by the two smaller rocks in front of it; one for the date, and one for the time at which the message was painted. The Rawk was originally placed where the fountain is today, on the hill in front of the dining hall.\n\n====Clock towers====\nStudents at the university also uphold the tradition of not walking beneath the four-faced clock tower located near the Rawk. It is said that those who walk under the clock will not graduate on time, and some students believe in this almost religiously, avoiding the bricks around the clock tower as well. Only graduates and the occasional unbeliever walk through the middle of the four posts to read the plaque below the clocks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uncgspartans.com/sports/2013/10/4/209276288.aspx|title=UNCG Traditions|website=UNC Greensboro|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\nStudents are also told not to depend on the time shown on any of the clock's faces. All four faces tend to show slightly different times.\n\nA new clock and bell tower, the Nicholas A. Vacc Bell Tower, was constructed in 2005 on the site of the old University Bell, at the corner of College Avenue and Spring Garden Street. The bells ring on the hour and on every quarter of the hour in a sequence made famous by the [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]] chimes.\n\n====Other traditions====\nIt is also a tradition each year to give new students a Minerva pin and a daisy\u2014the school flower of UNCG\u2014after student convocation. The daisy was the inspiration for the original two school colors: gold and white. (Navy blue was added to the color palette in 1987 \"to provide better visual contrast to publications, merchandise and athletic uniforms.\"<ref>[http://www.uncg.edu/ure/graphic_standards/color.html The University Colors] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908053337/http://www.uncg.edu/ure/graphic_standards/color.html |date=September 8, 2006}}. Accessed September 9, 2006.</ref>) Another tradition is the ringing of the university bell to open the academic year at the start of each Fall Semester.\n\nYet another tradition is to put a wreath of daisies at the foot of the statue of Charles McIver at UNCG and on the grounds of the North Carolina state capitol on Founder's Day. This is done by the alumni of the university.\n\n== University libraries ==\nThe [[UNCG University Libraries]] system has two branches. They are:\n* the Walter Clinton Jackson Library (the main campus library); this includes the Martha Blakeney Hodges Special Collections and University Archives\n* the Harold Schiffman Music Library\nOther affiliated libraries on campus include:\n* the Teaching Resources Center and the SELF Design Studio (housed in the School of Education)\n* the Interior Architecture Library\n* the Multicultural Resource Center Library (located in the Elliot University Center)\n\n== Academic units ==\nUNCG is home to research institutes and centers including the Gateway University Research Park, Center for Applied Research, Center for Creative Writing in the Arts, Center for Drug Discovery, Institute for Community and Economic Engagement, Center for Biotechnology, Genomics & Health Research, Music Research Institute and the Southeastern Regional Vision for Education (SERVE).\n\nThe university is organized into one traditional college, one specialty college, one professional college, and seven professional schools:\n* College of Arts and Sciences\n* [[UNCG School of Music, Theatre and Dance|College of Visual and Performing Arts]]\n* Lloyd International Honors College\n* [[Joseph M. Bryan School of Business and Economics]]\n* School of Education\n* School of Health and Human Sciences\n* School of Nursing\n* School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering\n* The Graduate School\n\n===College of Arts and Sciences===\nThe College of Arts and Sciences is the largest of the eight academic units that make up the university, with almost 500 full-time faculty in 21 academic departments and seven interdepartmental programs, spanning the arts, humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and mathematics.\n\nUNCG requires all students, no matter what their major, to complete a General Education Curriculum (GEC) that includes courses in the traditional liberal arts, as well as courses that introduce them to new perspectives that have become increasingly important today. The College offers most of the university's general education courses, in addition to the hundreds of more specialized courses that make up its undergraduate majors and graduate programs.\n\nThe College of Arts and Sciences has 7,135 undergraduates enrolled {{as of|2009|lc=y}} fall semester.\n\n===Lloyd International Honors College===\nThe Lloyd International Honors College is a selective honors college at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro and provides undergraduate students in all majors an opportunity to reach a higher level of academic achievement in the same time it takes to earn a regular degree.\n\nThe College offers three Honors academic programs that allows students to enhance their general-education studies (''International Honors Program''), work in their major (''Disciplinary Honors Program''), or their entire undergraduate education while at UNCG (''Full Honors Program''). All Honors students take special Honors courses that are generally restricted to no more than 20\u201325 students and often have an interdisciplinary focus. For those who wish to complete ''International Honors'' or ''Full University Honors'', an international experience and a second language are required.\n\n=== Joseph M. Bryan School of Business and Economics ===\nThe Bryan School of Business and Economics is the largest of UNCG's seven professional schools. It was founded in 1969, and is named for [[Joseph M. Bryan]], a prominent figure in [[North Carolina]] business and philanthropy. The Bryan School is among the top 1 percent of business schools worldwide that have achieved accreditation in both business and accounting by AACSB International \u2013The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bae.uncg.edu/about-bryan/rankings-reputation-accreditation|title=Rankings, Reputation, & Accreditation - The Bryan School of Business and Economics at UNCG|date=|publisher=Bae.uncg.edu|accessdate=April 8, 2016}}</ref> The Bryan School has 73 full-time faculty as well as 3,200 undergraduates and 460 graduate students.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bryan.uncg.edu/about-bryan/rankings-reputation-accreditation/|title=Rankings, Reputation, & Accreditation \u2014 Bryan School of Business and Economics at UNCG|work=Bryan School of Business and Economics at UNCG|access-date=April 19, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> There are also more than 20,000 alumni.\n\nDr. McRae C. \"Mac\" Banks II is the fourth dean of the Joseph M.

Originally designated in 1891 as the North Carolina State Normal and Industrial School, UNCG was established as a school to train women educators, based on the assumption that if women received training they would, in turn, educate their children and ultimately improve the level of education and literacy in the state.\n\nFounding of \"the Normal\" was a long time in coming. Although providing state-supported higher education for women in North Carolina had been an occasional topic of discussion among educators, the idea did not appear to be taken seriously until after the Civil War. When the idea was first formally proposed to the state's legislators, all of whom were men, it was overwhelmingly resisted. It was not until Charles Duncan McIver reminded the General Assembly that the state's Constitution asserted \"instruction of youth would be provided at low prices and would be encouraged at one or more universities.\" McIver argued that women were part of its youth and were, therefore, rightfully entitled to an education.\n\nIn addition to the constitutional basis for establishing an institution for women, several other factors came into play. First, there was an extensive need for qualified public school teachers, a career path assumed to be especially attractive to women. Also, there was overwhelming evidence that the public school system in North Carolina was among the worst in the nation. For example, the average national expenditure per student enrolled in the public schools was $17.62, but North Carolina spent only $3.36 per student. Similarly, the average national length of the school year was 135 days, but it was only 60 days in North Carolina.\n\nIndeed, for almost a decade after the Normal was founded, the curriculum involved diplomas awarded for work that was distinctly below college level. At the time few public high schools turned out female graduates who were prepared to handle college-level work. The curriculum was gradually modified over time and the Normal School became a full-fledged College in 1897. Baccalaureate degrees followed in 1903 and graduates were awarded a \"diploma and life license\" to teach in North Carolina.\n\n=== College of Visual and Performing Arts ===\n{{Main|UNCG College of Visual and Performing Arts}}\n\n[[Image:UNCG School of Music, Theatre and Dance.jpg|thumb|left|UNCG College of Visual and Performing Arts]]\nThe UNCG College of Visual and Performing Arts is home to over 900 student majors and more than 100 distinguished faculty members. On July 1, 2010, the School of Music was combined administratively with the departments of theater and dance to create the School of Music, Theatre and Dance. In 2016, the Department of Art was transferred from the College of Arts and Sciences, thus giving way to the renaming of the unit. The offices for the new combined school remain in the current music building, with the Art Department remaining at its present location.\n\nStudent Organizations include:\n* [[Delta Chi Xi]], Alpha chapter\n* [[Mu Phi Epsilon]], Alpha-Xi chapter\n* [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]], Iota Epsilon chapter\n* [[Sigma Alpha Iota]], Kappa Gamma chapter\n* [[MENC: The National Association for Music Education|Collegiate Music Educators National Conference]]\n* [[American Choral Directors Association]]\n* [[American String Teachers Association]]\n* Graduate Music Student Association\n* Society of Composers, Incorporated, Student Chapter\n* [[Alpha Psi Omega]]\n\n=== School of Nursing ===\nThe School of Nursing was established in September 1966 under the leadership of the first dean, Eloise R. Lewis. The first class of BSN students graduated in 1970. In 1976, the MSN program was initiated. The School began the PhD program Fall 2005. The School continues to offer both undergraduate and graduate programs with over 4,000 alumni. The School also offers an outreach program in Hickory, North Carolina for RN to BSN students and a concentration in education for MSN students.\n\nThe average passage rate for the NCLEX is over 90% for prelicensure graduates and all of the graduates from the nurse anesthesia program are nationally certified. The Adult and Gerontological Nurse Practitioner program leads to eligibility for national certification.\n\nStudents have the opportunity for clinical experiences in over 400 agencies throughout the state of North Carolina. The School supports four nursing clinics for the elderly as educational sites for students. All students are advised by nursing faculty.\n\n===School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering===\nThe Joint School of Nanoscience & Nanoengineering (\"JSNN\") is a collaborative project\nbetween [[North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University]] and UNCG. The mission\nof the JSNN is to train students to conduct basic and applied research in nanotechnology.\n\nThe Joint School for Nanoscience and Nanoengineering is expected to offer Professional Master of Science and Ph.D. degrees in [[Nanoscience]] and [[Nanoengineering]]. Nanoscience and Nanoengineering training for scientists and engineers already in the workforce. \n\nPrograms of study focus on three main areas: nanobioscience, which emphasizes biological and chemical aspects of nanoscience; nanotechnology, which emphasizes engineering and ecological aspects; and environmental nanoscience, which will address ethical and environmental implications of nanoscience. These programs of study lead to Professional Masters or PhD degrees.  The biological and chemical research emphasis offered by the JSNN is the first in the nation. The only other two existing professional master's programs in nanoscience and nanoengineering are at [[Rice University]] and [[University at Albany, SUNY]], neither of which offers a biological or chemical emphasis.\n\n===The Graduate School===\nThe Graduate School at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro directs and manages the graduate programs on campus for approximately 3600 graduate students from 33 states and 34 foreign countries.\n\nSome of the activities coordinated by The Graduate School Staff:\n* Disseminate program and admission information to prospective students\n* Collect and process application materials submitted to the university\n* Coordinate the admission process with academic departments\n* Assist students with interpretation of policy, course registration and withdrawal\n* Monitor academic eligibility\n* Review theses/dissertations for formatting requirements\n* Process applications for Graduation\n* Process degree audits/degree clearances\n* Work with the Graduate Studies Committee to approve all new/revised graduate programs, curricula, and policy\n\n==Other notable academic units==\n\n===M.F.A. Writing Program===\nDuring the early years, the university had among its faculty a number of noted writers, such as [[Allen Tate]], [[Caroline Gordon]], [[John Crowe Ransom]], [[Hiram Haydn]], [[Peter Matthew Hillsman Taylor|Peter Taylor]], [[Robie Macauley]] and [[Randall Jarrell]]. They invited other distinguished writers to campus to read from their work and to meet with students; these writers included [[Robert Lowell]], [[Robert Frost]], [[Flannery O'Connor]], [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[Eudora Welty]], and [[Saul Bellow]]. In 1965, under the leadership of Robert Watson, creative writing offerings were formalized. Since that time, enrollment has grown, but the faculty has intentionally kept the program small, enabling students to have individual conferences with faculty. Notable faculty members have included [[Fred Chappell]], [[H.T. Kirby-Smith]], [[Michael Parker (novelist)|Michael Parker]], [[Craig Nova]], [[Stuart Dischell]], [[Jennifer Grotz]] and [[David Roderick]]. Notable graduates include [[Claudia Emerson]], [[Steve Almond]], [[Keith Lee Morris]], Lee Hadaway and [[Rodney Jones (poet)|Rodney Jones]].\n\n===Gateway University Research Park===\nGateway University Research Park is a 501(c)3 not-for-profit entity created to manage and operate the joint collaboration between [[North Carolina A&T State University]] and UNCG for the purposes of supporting research and economic development within the Triad. Gateway University Research Park aims to attract and retain educational, corporate and community service agencies which advance scientific and educational research in technology. The park consists of two campuses.\n\nA $400 million master plan has been developed for the two campuses of Gateway University Research Park and when fully developed, the research park is anticipated to generate an economic impact of $50 million per year in the Triad. Upon full build out of the project, it is further anticipated that companies and agencies located at the Gateway University Research Park will encompass more than 2,000 employees. The Southeast campus of the research park already houses the aforementioned School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering.\n\n== Residential colleges ==\nUNCG is home to three [[residential colleges]], as well as an arts-specific dormitory community.\n\n=== Cornelia Strong College ===\nCornelia Strong College provides a social and academic community within the context of the larger university. Strong College has a curriculum focused on sustainability. The college is a two-year program, similar to that of Ashby College. After two years at Strong College students take a fieldwork capstone course to \"graduate\" from the program. Strong College fellows are faculty members who take an active role in the development of Strong College's student members.\n\n=== Grogan College ===\n[[Grogan College|Ione Grogan College]], established in 1997, is limited to freshman and serves about 300 students per year. The college is divided into smaller learning communities, each headed by a faculty fellow. The college offers classes that meet general requirements, and ease freshman into the college experience.\n\n=== Ashby Residential College ===\nThe Warren Ashby Residential College at Mary Foust, established in 1970, is a community of freshman and sophomore students, faculty and staff who live or work in Mary Foust Hall. Also known as RC (or ARC), the college offers small classes, close student and faculty interaction and a rich community living experience.\n\nIn addition to freshmen and sophomores, those who have graduated from the program and are rising juniors or seniors may apply to be Mary Foust upperclassmen. Typically 8\u201312 or so juniors and seniors are selected each year to continue living in Mary Foust as mentors. Each upperclassman is required to complete an \"upperclassman project.\"  These projects are typically activities that support community interaction within Mary Foust.\n\nMany Mary Foust alumni continue to support and participate in Ashby Residential College. Many of the staff are alumni.\n\n=== Studio 91 ===\nStudio 91, established in 2018, is a residential community of students pursuing artistic disciplines. Also known as Cone Dormitory, Studio 91 offers seminars, activities, and unique access to arts faculty in a rich community living experience. Studio 91 contains practice rooms, dance studios, and spaces for creating visual art. Cross-disciplinary work is also encouraged.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n[[File:Paul Chelimo 2016d.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Paul Chelimo]]]]\n[[File:Emmylouharrissf2005.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Emmylou Harris]]]]\n[[File:Danny Valencia w bat.jpg|thumb|180x|[[Danny Valencia]]]]\n* [[Steve Almond]] \u2013 Author of ''Candyfreak, My Life in Heavy Metal, ''and ''The Evil B.B.

It is part of the [[University of North Carolina|University of North Carolina system]]. UNCG, like all members of the UNC system, is a stand-alone university and awards its own degrees. UNCG is accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges]] to award baccalaureate, masters, specialist and doctoral degrees.\n\nThe university offers more than 100 undergraduate, 61 master's and 26 doctoral programs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ire.uncg.edu/pages/factbook/2009-10/PDFs/history/2009Profile.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720092825/http://ire.uncg.edu/pages/factbook/2009-10/PDFs/history/2009Profile.PDF |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The university's academic schools and programs include the College of Arts & Sciences, the Joseph M. Bryan School of Business & Economics, the School of Education, the School of Health and Human Sciences, the Joint School of Nanoscience & Nanoengineering (one of the first such schools in the nation), the [[UNCG College of Visual and Performing Arts|School of Visual and Performing Arts]], the School of Nursing, Continual Learning, Graduate School, Warren Ashby Residential College and Lloyd International Honors College. The university is also home to the [[Weatherspoon Art Museum]], which features one of the largest collections of modern American art in the country.\n\nThe university holds two classifications from the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]], as a \"[[research university]] with high research activity\" and for \"community engagement\" in curriculum, outreach and partnerships.\n\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Statenormalandindustrial.jpg|thumb|350px|right|North Carolina State Normal and Industrial School, ca. 1906.]]\n\nCredit for the founding of UNCG goes mainly to [[Charles Duncan McIver]], a crusader for the cause of women's education. McIver served the institution as its first chief executive officer with the title of President. This position has also seen various names, with the administrator being known as the Dean of Administration after 1934 and Chancellor from 1945 to present.\n\nThe school was established as a [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's college]] by legislative enactment on February 18, 1891, as the State Normal and Industrial School and opened October 5, 1892. The school provided instruction in business, domestic science, and teaching with a student body of 223 and a faculty of 15 in its first year. R. S. Pullen and R. T. Gray gave the original {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} site in Greensboro, N.C. where the first building was erected with state funds totaling $30,000. It is the first and only public university in North Carolina founded for the purpose of educating women. In 1949, it became the largest all-female institution in the United States.\n\nThe school has seen many names over the years, changing from the \"State Normal and Industrial School\" to the State Normal and Industrial College in 1896, and again in 1919 to North Carolina College for Women. In 1932, it changed to the Woman's College of the University of North Carolina, when it became one of the three charter institutions of the Consolidated University of North Carolina, and changed again to the University of North Carolina at Greensboro when men were first admitted to the school in 1963. It is remembered fondly by many graduates of the Woman's College simply as \"the W.C.\"\n\nUNCG is in the midst of expanding beyond its traditional borders onto Gate City Boulevard, a major city thoroughfare, with the construction of an 800-bed residence hall for students, and this is just the beginning of the $200 million project on Gate City Boulevard.  The new construction will be a mixed-use development, with space for retail and restaurants, along with student residence halls and a new student recreation center. The university's expansion into the West Lee Street Corridor was triggered by UNCG's strategic housing plan, which calls for the university to increase the percentage of undergraduates living in university housing from 30 percent to more than 40 percent over the next decade.\n\nIn addition to providing room for UNCG's growth, the expansion also syncs with Greensboro's revitalization plan for the Gate City Boulevard corridor, a main entry point and thoroughfare in the city. The project will also spur economic development in the area. Projections estimate the development will generate more than $590 million in new spending between 2014 and 2023, create 945 new jobs and boost local property revenues by $7.5 million. The expansion has not been without controversy, especially the $91 million athletic center. The athletic center is financed by a mandatory annual fee of $435 charged every UNCG student.<ref>\"UNCG Students, Faculty Balk at Facility Spending\" ''Carolina Journal Online'' December 5, 2013, http://www.carolinajournal.com/exclusives/display_exclusive.html?id=10675, accessed December 12, 2014</ref>\n\nA personnel scandal erupted in 2014.

Brown, Greensboro: An Architectural Record (1995)</ref> Other features include a statue of [[Minerva]], the goddess of wisdom, located to the east of Elliott University Center. Minerva has been a part of campus from the first diploma bearing her likeness in 1894 to the statue erected near the center in 2003. Minerva also inspired the university's new graphic identity program, which was launched in 2004.\n\nOther landmarks include \"Charlie,\" a statue of the university's founder [[Charles Duncan McIver]] outside Jackson Library. The white tower stacks of the Jackson Library and the Spartan water tower are recognizable structures in the Greensboro community, and the campus is also home to \"the Rawk\" and the clock tower\u2014two campus landmarks\u2014and school traditions (''See Traditions below''). A new bell tower at the corner of College Ave. and Spring Garden St. was completed in 2005.\n\nThe Fountain is another landmark on UNCG's campus and is a common meeting place for student groups. Visible from parts of the quad all the way to the Elliot University Center and from above in the Jackson Library and \"the Caf,\" the large steps and platform around the fountain are frequently home to demonstrations, performances, and fraternity/sorority functions.\n\nThe campus is in close proximity (within 1.5 hours drive) to many other universities \u2014 [[North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University]], [[Duke University|Duke]], [[Elon University|Elon]], [[High Point University]], [[NC State]], [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC-Chapel Hill]], [[UNC Charlotte]], [[Wake Forest University|Wake Forest]], and [[Winston-Salem State University]]. The university is located about halfway between [[Washington, DC]] and [[Atlanta, Georgia]].\n\n==Athletics==\n{{main|UNC Greensboro Spartans}}\n\nThe intercollegiate athletics program at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro reaches as far back as the late 1940s during the days of the WCUNC, with students participating in national golf tournaments in 1948 and the school hosting the national tournaments for women's golf (1954) and tennis (1965). During the 1980s, all Spartan teams competed in Division III (non-scholarship) and then Division II (scholarship) of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]], and all teams have competed in Division 1 since Fall 1991. Between 1982\u20131987 the Men's Soccer team won the NCAA Division III national championship title every year except for 1984. Today UNCG competes in the [[Southern Conference]], which is made up of 10 schools across five states in the Southeast.\n\nThe 18 athletic teams currently at UNCG include: Football, Baseball, Men's Basketball, Women's Basketball, Men's Cross Country, Women's Cross Country, Men's Golf, Women's Golf, Men's Soccer, Women's Soccer, Softball, Men's Indoor Track, Women's Indoor Track, Men's Tennis, Women's Tennis, Men's Track, Women's Track, Women's Volleyball.  Wrestling was dropped in the spring of 2011. Although not considered official sports teams, the Athletic Department also includes the UNCG Cheerleading Squad and the UNCG Dance Team, the Spartan Gs.\n\nUNCG's men's basketball team moved into a \"new\" home in 2009\u201310, making the [[Greensboro Coliseum]] its home court. The move was announced by UNCG chancellor Dr. Linda Brady on December 5, 2008. As a preview of things to come, UNCG hosted Davidson in its new venue two months later and drew a crowd of 11,687. On December 29, 2010 a UNCG record attendance of 22,178 watched the Spartans host the Duke Blue Devils. At full capacity, the building holds more than 23,000 fans for basketball giving UNCG the ability to have potentially one of the largest basketball arenas in the country. UNCG utilitizes a variety of configurations for its contests with a minimum capacity of 7,617. As part of the move, the Coliseum remodeled a floor into a Spartan \"home floor\" and completely renovated a massive locker room space for the team, complete with training room, meeting facilities, coaches offices and a players' lounge. The team is coached by former [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] player [[Wes Miller]], who at the time of his appointment in 2012 was the youngest head coach in Division I.\n\nFormer UNCG women's basketball coach Lynne Agee, who retired following the 2010\u20132011 season, ranks among the most successful coaches in intercollegiate women's basketball history. Currently, she is one of just 45 coaches in the history of the women's game to have engineered more than 600 victories; see [[list of college women's basketball coaches with 600 wins]]. Under Agee's guidance, UNCG reached the 20-win plateau 16 times. The Spartans also earned berths into the Division I national tournament once, the Division II tournament once and the Division III tournament seven times. With Agee at the helm, UNCG became one of only 10 teams nationally (all divisions) to reach the NCAA tournament each of the first seven years it was held (1982\u20131988). With UNCG's 1998 NCAA appearance, Agee became the first women's coach in history to take teams to the NCAA tournament in all three divisions. UNCG is now coached by [[Roxboro, North Carolina|Roxboro]], [[Person County]] native and former WNBA player [[Wendy Palmer]].\n\n===The Blue Crew===\nThe Blue Crew is a student organization dedicated to cheering on the Spartans at athletic events.\n<gallery>\nImage:Blue Crew Soccer.jpg|The Blue Crew at a soccer game\n\nImage:Blue_Crew.jpg|The Blue Crew at a basketball game\nImage:Blue_Crew_2.jpg|Blue Crew at a basketball game\nImage:Blue_Crew_3.jpg|Blue Crew\n</gallery>\n\n==Clubs and traditions==\nUNCG is home to a large number of diverse and active sports and student organizations from Greek life to a radio station, and some traditions unique to the school.\n\n===Clubs===\nIn Fall 2010, the Clubs and Organizations affiliated with UNCG included 36 Honor Societies and 20 Fraternities and Sororities. The university also has an active [[student government]] association, founded in 1910,<ref>[http://www.uncgsga.org/?page_id=2 UNCG Student Government Association, \"About Us\"]</ref> Campus Activities Board (CAB), and several foreign culture groups, a Neo-Black Society, PRIDE!

Unofficial rules govern the use of the Rawk, and students know not to use foul language and that messages must be left for at least 24 hours before being painted over. Students know when they can begin to paint over the previous message on The Rawk by the two smaller rocks in front of it; one for the date, and one for the time at which the message was painted. The Rawk was originally placed where the fountain is today, on the hill in front of the dining hall.\n\n====Clock towers====\nStudents at the university also uphold the tradition of not walking beneath the four-faced clock tower located near the Rawk. It is said that those who walk under the clock will not graduate on time, and some students believe in this almost religiously, avoiding the bricks around the clock tower as well. Only graduates and the occasional unbeliever walk through the middle of the four posts to read the plaque below the clocks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uncgspartans.com/sports/2013/10/4/209276288.aspx|title=UNCG Traditions|website=UNC Greensboro|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\nStudents are also told not to depend on the time shown on any of the clock's faces. All four faces tend to show slightly different times.\n\nA new clock and bell tower, the Nicholas A. Vacc Bell Tower, was constructed in 2005 on the site of the old University Bell, at the corner of College Avenue and Spring Garden Street. The bells ring on the hour and on every quarter of the hour in a sequence made famous by the [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]] chimes.\n\n====Other traditions====\nIt is also a tradition each year to give new students a Minerva pin and a daisy\u2014the school flower of UNCG\u2014after student convocation. The daisy was the inspiration for the original two school colors: gold and white. (Navy blue was added to the color palette in 1987 \"to provide better visual contrast to publications, merchandise and athletic uniforms.\"<ref>[http://www.uncg.edu/ure/graphic_standards/color.html The University Colors] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908053337/http://www.uncg.edu/ure/graphic_standards/color.html |date=September 8, 2006}}. Accessed September 9, 2006.</ref>) Another tradition is the ringing of the university bell to open the academic year at the start of each Fall Semester.\n\nYet another tradition is to put a wreath of daisies at the foot of the statue of Charles McIver at UNCG and on the grounds of the North Carolina state capitol on Founder's Day. This is done by the alumni of the university.\n\n== University libraries ==\nThe [[UNCG University Libraries]] system has two branches. They are:\n* the Walter Clinton Jackson Library (the main campus library); this includes the Martha Blakeney Hodges Special Collections and University Archives\n* the Harold Schiffman Music Library\nOther affiliated libraries on campus include:\n* the Teaching Resources Center and the SELF Design Studio (housed in the School of Education)\n* the Interior Architecture Library\n* the Multicultural Resource Center Library (located in the Elliot University Center)\n\n== Academic units ==\nUNCG is home to research institutes and centers including the Gateway University Research Park, Center for Applied Research, Center for Creative Writing in the Arts, Center for Drug Discovery, Institute for Community and Economic Engagement, Center for Biotechnology, Genomics & Health Research, Music Research Institute and the Southeastern Regional Vision for Education (SERVE).\n\nThe university is organized into one traditional college, one specialty college, one professional college, and seven professional schools:\n* College of Arts and Sciences\n* [[UNCG School of Music, Theatre and Dance|College of Visual and Performing Arts]]\n* Lloyd International Honors College\n* [[Joseph M. Bryan School of Business and Economics]]\n* School of Education\n* School of Health and Human Sciences\n* School of Nursing\n* School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering\n* The Graduate School\n\n===College of Arts and Sciences===\nThe College of Arts and Sciences is the largest of the eight academic units that make up the university, with almost 500 full-time faculty in 21 academic departments and seven interdepartmental programs, spanning the arts, humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and mathematics.\n\nUNCG requires all students, no matter what their major, to complete a General Education Curriculum (GEC) that includes courses in the traditional liberal arts, as well as courses that introduce them to new perspectives that have become increasingly important today. The College offers most of the university's general education courses, in addition to the hundreds of more specialized courses that make up its undergraduate majors and graduate programs.\n\nThe College of Arts and Sciences has 7,135 undergraduates enrolled {{as of|2009|lc=y}} fall semester.\n\n===Lloyd International Honors College===\nThe Lloyd International Honors College is a selective honors college at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro and provides undergraduate students in all majors an opportunity to reach a higher level of academic achievement in the same time it takes to earn a regular degree.\n\nThe College offers three Honors academic programs that allows students to enhance their general-education studies (''International Honors Program''), work in their major (''Disciplinary Honors Program''), or their entire undergraduate education while at UNCG (''Full Honors Program''). All Honors students take special Honors courses that are generally restricted to no more than 20\u201325 students and often have an interdisciplinary focus. For those who wish to complete ''International Honors'' or ''Full University Honors'', an international experience and a second language are required.\n\n=== Joseph M. Bryan School of Business and Economics ===\nThe Bryan School of Business and Economics is the largest of UNCG's seven professional schools. It was founded in 1969, and is named for [[Joseph M. Bryan]], a prominent figure in [[North Carolina]] business and philanthropy. The Bryan School is among the top 1 percent of business schools worldwide that have achieved accreditation in both business and accounting by AACSB International \u2013The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bae.uncg.edu/about-bryan/rankings-reputation-accreditation|title=Rankings, Reputation, & Accreditation - The Bryan School of Business and Economics at UNCG|date=|publisher=Bae.uncg.edu|accessdate=April 8, 2016}}</ref> The Bryan School has 73 full-time faculty as well as 3,200 undergraduates and 460 graduate students.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bryan.uncg.edu/about-bryan/rankings-reputation-accreditation/|title=Rankings, Reputation, & Accreditation \u2014 Bryan School of Business and Economics at UNCG|work=Bryan School of Business and Economics at UNCG|access-date=April 19, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> There are also more than 20,000 alumni.\n\nDr. McRae C. \"Mac\" Banks II is the fourth dean of the Joseph M.

Originally designated in 1891 as the North Carolina State Normal and Industrial School, UNCG was established as a school to train women educators, based on the assumption that if women received training they would, in turn, educate their children and ultimately improve the level of education and literacy in the state.\n\nFounding of \"the Normal\" was a long time in coming. Although providing state-supported higher education for women in North Carolina had been an occasional topic of discussion among educators, the idea did not appear to be taken seriously until after the Civil War. When the idea was first formally proposed to the state's legislators, all of whom were men, it was overwhelmingly resisted. It was not until Charles Duncan McIver reminded the General Assembly that the state's Constitution asserted \"instruction of youth would be provided at low prices and would be encouraged at one or more universities.\" McIver argued that women were part of its youth and were, therefore, rightfully entitled to an education.\n\nIn addition to the constitutional basis for establishing an institution for women, several other factors came into play. First, there was an extensive need for qualified public school teachers, a career path assumed to be especially attractive to women. Also, there was overwhelming evidence that the public school system in North Carolina was among the worst in the nation. For example, the average national expenditure per student enrolled in the public schools was $17.62, but North Carolina spent only $3.36 per student. Similarly, the average national length of the school year was 135 days, but it was only 60 days in North Carolina.\n\nIndeed, for almost a decade after the Normal was founded, the curriculum involved diplomas awarded for work that was distinctly below college level. At the time few public high schools turned out female graduates who were prepared to handle college-level work. The curriculum was gradually modified over time and the Normal School became a full-fledged College in 1897. Baccalaureate degrees followed in 1903 and graduates were awarded a \"diploma and life license\" to teach in North Carolina.\n\n=== College of Visual and Performing Arts ===\n{{Main|UNCG College of Visual and Performing Arts}}\n\n[[Image:UNCG School of Music, Theatre and Dance.jpg|thumb|left|UNCG College of Visual and Performing Arts]]\nThe UNCG College of Visual and Performing Arts is home to over 900 student majors and more than 100 distinguished faculty members. On July 1, 2010, the School of Music was combined administratively with the departments of theater and dance to create the School of Music, Theatre and Dance. In 2016, the Department of Art was transferred from the College of Arts and Sciences, thus giving way to the renaming of the unit. The offices for the new combined school remain in the current music building, with the Art Department remaining at its present location.\n\nStudent Organizations include:\n* [[Delta Chi Xi]], Alpha chapter\n* [[Mu Phi Epsilon]], Alpha-Xi chapter\n* [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]], Iota Epsilon chapter\n* [[Sigma Alpha Iota]], Kappa Gamma chapter\n* [[MENC: The National Association for Music Education|Collegiate Music Educators National Conference]]\n* [[American Choral Directors Association]]\n* [[American String Teachers Association]]\n* Graduate Music Student Association\n* Society of Composers, Incorporated, Student Chapter\n* [[Alpha Psi Omega]]\n\n=== School of Nursing ===\nThe School of Nursing was established in September 1966 under the leadership of the first dean, Eloise R. Lewis. The first class of BSN students graduated in 1970. In 1976, the MSN program was initiated. The School began the PhD program Fall 2005. The School continues to offer both undergraduate and graduate programs with over 4,000 alumni. The School also offers an outreach program in Hickory, North Carolina for RN to BSN students and a concentration in education for MSN students.\n\nThe average passage rate for the NCLEX is over 90% for prelicensure graduates and all of the graduates from the nurse anesthesia program are nationally certified. The Adult and Gerontological Nurse Practitioner program leads to eligibility for national certification.\n\nStudents have the opportunity for clinical experiences in over 400 agencies throughout the state of North Carolina. The School supports four nursing clinics for the elderly as educational sites for students. All students are advised by nursing faculty.\n\n===School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering===\nThe Joint School of Nanoscience & Nanoengineering (\"JSNN\") is a collaborative project\nbetween [[North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University]] and UNCG. The mission\nof the JSNN is to train students to conduct basic and applied research in nanotechnology.\n\nThe Joint School for Nanoscience and Nanoengineering is expected to offer Professional Master of Science and Ph.D. degrees in [[Nanoscience]] and [[Nanoengineering]]. Nanoscience and Nanoengineering training for scientists and engineers already in the workforce. \n\nPrograms of study focus on three main areas: nanobioscience, which emphasizes biological and chemical aspects of nanoscience; nanotechnology, which emphasizes engineering and ecological aspects; and environmental nanoscience, which will address ethical and environmental implications of nanoscience. These programs of study lead to Professional Masters or PhD degrees.  The biological and chemical research emphasis offered by the JSNN is the first in the nation. The only other two existing professional master's programs in nanoscience and nanoengineering are at [[Rice University]] and [[University at Albany, SUNY]], neither of which offers a biological or chemical emphasis.\n\n===The Graduate School===\nThe Graduate School at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro directs and manages the graduate programs on campus for approximately 3600 graduate students from 33 states and 34 foreign countries.\n\nSome of the activities coordinated by The Graduate School Staff:\n* Disseminate program and admission information to prospective students\n* Collect and process application materials submitted to the university\n* Coordinate the admission process with academic departments\n* Assist students with interpretation of policy, course registration and withdrawal\n* Monitor academic eligibility\n* Review theses/dissertations for formatting requirements\n* Process applications for Graduation\n* Process degree audits/degree clearances\n* Work with the Graduate Studies Committee to approve all new/revised graduate programs, curricula, and policy\n\n==Other notable academic units==\n\n===M.F.A. Writing Program===\nDuring the early years, the university had among its faculty a number of noted writers, such as [[Allen Tate]], [[Caroline Gordon]], [[John Crowe Ransom]], [[Hiram Haydn]], [[Peter Matthew Hillsman Taylor|Peter Taylor]], [[Robie Macauley]] and [[Randall Jarrell]]. They invited other distinguished writers to campus to read from their work and to meet with students; these writers included [[Robert Lowell]], [[Robert Frost]], [[Flannery O'Connor]], [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[Eudora Welty]], and [[Saul Bellow]]. In 1965, under the leadership of Robert Watson, creative writing offerings were formalized. Since that time, enrollment has grown, but the faculty has intentionally kept the program small, enabling students to have individual conferences with faculty. Notable faculty members have included [[Fred Chappell]], [[H.T. Kirby-Smith]], [[Michael Parker (novelist)|Michael Parker]], [[Craig Nova]], [[Stuart Dischell]], [[Jennifer Grotz]] and [[David Roderick]]. Notable graduates include [[Claudia Emerson]], [[Steve Almond]], [[Keith Lee Morris]], Lee Hadaway and [[Rodney Jones (poet)|Rodney Jones]].\n\n===Gateway University Research Park===\nGateway University Research Park is a 501(c)3 not-for-profit entity created to manage and operate the joint collaboration between [[North Carolina A&T State University]] and UNCG for the purposes of supporting research and economic development within the Triad. Gateway University Research Park aims to attract and retain educational, corporate and community service agencies which advance scientific and educational research in technology. The park consists of two campuses.\n\nA $400 million master plan has been developed for the two campuses of Gateway University Research Park and when fully developed, the research park is anticipated to generate an economic impact of $50 million per year in the Triad. Upon full build out of the project, it is further anticipated that companies and agencies located at the Gateway University Research Park will encompass more than 2,000 employees. The Southeast campus of the research park already houses the aforementioned School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering.\n\n== Residential colleges ==\nUNCG is home to three [[residential colleges]], as well as an arts-specific dormitory community.\n\n=== Cornelia Strong College ===\n[[Cornelia Strong College]] provides a social and academic community within the context of the larger university. Strong College has a curriculum focused on sustainability. The college is a two-year program, similar to that of Ashby College. After two years at Strong College students take a fieldwork capstone course to \"graduate\" from the program. Strong College fellows are faculty members who take an active role in the development of Strong College's student members.\n\n=== Grogan College ===\n[[Grogan College|Ione Grogan College]], established in 1997, is limited to freshman and serves about 300 students per year. The college is divided into smaller learning communities, each headed by a faculty fellow. The college offers classes that meet general requirements, and ease freshman into the college experience.\n\n=== Ashby Residential College ===\nThe Warren Ashby Residential College at Mary Foust, established in 1970, is a community of freshman and sophomore students, faculty and staff who live or work in Mary Foust Hall. Also known as RC (or ARC), the college offers small classes, close student and faculty interaction and a rich community living experience.\n\nIn addition to freshmen and sophomores, those who have graduated from the program and are rising juniors or seniors may apply to be Mary Foust upperclassmen. Typically 8\u201312 or so juniors and seniors are selected each year to continue living in Mary Foust as mentors. Each upperclassman is required to complete an \"upperclassman project.\"  These projects are typically activities that support community interaction within Mary Foust.\n\nMany Mary Foust alumni continue to support and participate in Ashby Residential College. Many of the staff are alumni.\n\n=== Studio 91 ===\nStudio 91, established in 2018, is a residential community of students pursuing artistic disciplines. Also known as Cone Dormitory, Studio 91 offers seminars, activities, and unique access to arts faculty in a rich community living experience. Studio 91 contains practice rooms, dance studios, and spaces for creating visual art. Cross-disciplinary work is also encouraged.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n[[File:Paul Chelimo 2016d.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Paul Chelimo]]]]\n[[File:Emmylouharrissf2005.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Emmylou Harris]]]]\n[[File:Danny Valencia w bat.jpg|thumb|180x|[[Danny Valencia]]]]\n* [[Steve Almond]] \u2013 Author of ''Candyfreak, My Life in Heavy Metal, ''and ''The Evil B.B.
