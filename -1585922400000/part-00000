Fry|Fry]], [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]], and [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] hand their resignations to [[Professor Hubert Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] after narrowly escaping another delivery with their lives, but reconsider when he announces that the Planet Express team will take a cruise on the [[maiden voyage]] of the largest space [[cruise ship]] ever built: the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']]. As they board they are stopped by [[Zapp Brannigan]], the ship's honorary captain. Attempting to avoid Brannigan's advances, Leela claims she is [[Engagement|engaged]] to Fry. Bender meets the robot, Countess de la Roca. Brannigan deviates from the ship's course, opting to fly through a swarm of [[comet]]s. [[Amy Wong|Amy]] unexpectedly runs into [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Leo and Inez Wong|her parents]] who attempt to set Amy up with a date. To redirect her parents' attention, Amy claims Fry is her [[boyfriend]], making Leela jealous.\n\nBender meets the Countess again and pretends to be rich. At first, he is only after her money, but he soon realizes he loves her. She learns Bender is a broke felon when he attempts to steal drinks from the bar. She tells him that she is not interested in his wealth; she loves him for his personality. [[Hermes Conrad|Hermes]] is urged to participate in a [[limbo (dance)|limbo]] competition, but declines, as he was still recovering from guilt over an incident that occurred at the 2980 [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] where a child trying to emulate him fatally broke his spine. Brannigan declares Leela the winner of the competition, despite her not being a contestant. She and Fry are invited to dinner at the captain's table. At dinner, both Brannigan and Amy's parents are present; they demand that Fry kiss his date. Before the fake relationships are exposed, [[Kif Kroker|Kif]] calls Brannigan to the bridge; the new course has endangered the ship.\n\nBrannigan attempts to correct the problem by piloting the ship too close to a [[black hole]]. Realizing the danger he has put them in, Brannigan promotes Kif to Captain before fleeing the ship. Outside, Fry and Leela nearly kiss before they are interrupted by the ship breaking in half. Bender heads off to save the Countess while the rest of the crew head for the escape pods. An airlock door closes, blocking the crew's escape. [[Doctor John D. Zoidberg|Zoidberg]] holds it open a few inches, but the door release is on the other side. Hermes resurrects his old limbo skills to squeeze under the door. Arriving at the escape pods, they meet Amy's parents, who have found Amy a new boyfriend: \"Captain\" Kif. After waiting as long as they can for Bender, the crew launches the escape pod. Bender leaps from the ''Titanic'', Countess in tow. He grabs the escape pod, but they are overweight. The Countess sacrifices herself so the others may escape, upsetting Bender. Entering the pod, a heartbroken Bender says he will have her diamond bracelet to remind him of her. Fry assures him that she is alive in another reality, Farnsworth agrees on the possibility, only for the professor to tell Zoidberg that black holes are entirely fatal. Bender then immediately asks Hermes what it's worth, who then examines it and tells Bender that it is not real, causing Bender to break down and cry.\n\n==Production==\nThis episodes features the beginning of the relationship between Kif Kroker and Amy Wong.
