The creek was a camp for [[First Nations]] for centuries. The name of the creek comes from the [[Cree]], who called the South Saskatchewan River {{lang|cr|Kisisk\u00e2ciwan,}} meaning \"it flows swiftly\". [[North American fur trade|Fur traders]] found the creek on their westward treks in the 1800s, and called it \"rivi\u00e8re au Courant\" (lit: \"river of the current\"). Henri Julien, an artist travelling with the [[North-West Mounted Police]] expedition in 1874, referred to it as \"Du Courant\", and Commissioner [[George Arthur French|George French]] used \"Strong Current Creek\" in his diary. While it took another decade before being officially recorded, the area has always been known as \"Swift Current\".<ref>[https://tourismswiftcurrent.ca/ Tourism Swift Current]</ref>\n\nThe settlement of Swift Current was established in 1883, after the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] surveyed a railway line as far as Swift Current Creek. In 1882, initial [[Land grading|grading]] and track preparation commenced, with the first settlers arriving in the spring of 1883. During the early part of its settlement, the economy was based almost exclusively on serving the new railway buildings and employees. There was also a significant ranching operation known as the \"76\" ranches. It included 10 ranches raising [[sheep]] and [[cattle]] and stretched from Swift Current to [[Calgary]]. The ranch located at Swift Current dealt with sheep. At one point there were upwards of 20,000 sheep grazing on the present day Kinetic Grounds. The head shepherd was John Oman, originally from Scotland. He donated land to build Oman School in 1913.<ref>McGowan, Don C. ''The Green and Growing Years: Swift Current, 1907-1914''. Victoria: Cactus Publications, 1982.</ref> Other early industries included gathering [[bison]] bones for use in fertilizer manufacturing, the making of bone china and sugar refining. [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] residents also ran a successful [[Red River ox cart]] \"freighting\" business along the [[Swift Current-Battleford Trail]] to [[Battleford]] until the late 1880s. During the [[North-West Rebellion|Riel Rebellion]] of 1885, Swift Current became a major military base and troop mustering area due to its proximity to Battleford but this was only for a short time. On February 4, 1904, the [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] became a village and then a town on March 15, 1907, when a [[census]] indicated a population of 550. Swift Current became incorporated as a city on January 15, 1914, with Frank E. West being the mayor at the time.\n\nThe [[Swift Current Airport]] was taken over by the city of Swift Current from [[Transport Canada]] in 1996. Airport services were then contracted out. There have been recent (2005\u20132006) plans to expand and revitalize the airport alongside the rural municipalities surrounding Swift Current.\n\nSwift Current is sometimes known as \"Speedy Creek\", \"Swift\", or \"Swifty\".\n\nSwift Current's official slogan is \"Where Life Makes Sense\".\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:Lyric Theatre Swift Current.JPG|thumb|left|Lyric Theatre in downtown Swift Current]]\nSwift Current is home to Saskatchewan's oldest operating theatre: the [[Lyric Theatre (Swift Current)|Lyric Theatre]], built in 1912 at a cost of $50,000 is the \"crown jewel\" of Swift Current's historical downtown buildings, with instantly recognizable advertisements painted on the north and south sides of the building dating back to the early 1920s. The building has served many functions over the years: at first it housed glamorous [[vaudeville]] performances by traveling companies, was later converted into a movie theatre and, in the mid-1980s, a bar and nightclub. A volunteer non-profit group (Southwest Cultural Development Group) purchased the facility in 2005 and is raising money for its preservation while staging cultural events, such as a mock [[Chautauqua]] annually in July, since 2008, open mic nights throughout the year, and administering rentals of the building. The current musician in residence is Al Hudec.\n\nSwift Current is home to Casey\u2019s Dining Room, the best buffet in Saskatchewan. They have incredible food at a good price and the service is second to none.\n\nSwift Current's tallest commercial building is the EI Wood Building, located downtown.\n\nThe longest running business in Swift Current is the Imperial Hotel, also known as \"The Big Eye\" due to the large eye painted on the side. It was built in 1903 and was used as evidence that Swift Current should be granted village status. The owner, R.H. Corbett of Medicine Hat, needed the designation to obtain a liquor licence.<ref>McGowan, Don C. ''Grassland Settlers: The Swift Current Region During the Era of the Ranching Frontier.''

The creek was a camp for [[First Nations]] for centuries. The name of the creek comes from the [[Cree]], who called the South Saskatchewan River {{lang|cr|Kisisk\u00e2ciwan,}} meaning \"it flows swiftly\". [[North American fur trade|Fur traders]] found the creek on their westward treks in the 1800s, and called it \"rivi\u00e8re au Courant\" (lit: \"river of the current\"). Henri Julien, an artist travelling with the [[North-West Mounted Police]] expedition in 1874, referred to it as \"Du Courant\", and Commissioner [[George Arthur French|George French]] used \"Strong Current Creek\" in his diary. While it took another decade before being officially recorded, the area has always been known as \"Swift Current\".<ref>[https://tourismswiftcurrent.ca/ Tourism Swift Current]</ref>\n\nThe settlement of Swift Current was established in 1883, after the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] surveyed a railway line as far as Swift Current Creek. In 1882, initial [[Land grading|grading]] and track preparation commenced, with the first settlers arriving in the spring of 1883. During the early part of its settlement, the economy was based almost exclusively on serving the new railway buildings and employees. There was also a significant ranching operation known as the \"76\" ranches. It included 10 ranches raising [[sheep]] and [[cattle]] and stretched from Swift Current to [[Calgary]]. The ranch located at Swift Current dealt with sheep. At one point there were upwards of 20,000 sheep grazing on the present day Kinetic Grounds. The head shepherd was John Oman, originally from Scotland. He donated land to build Oman School in 1913.<ref>McGowan, Don C. ''The Green and Growing Years: Swift Current, 1907-1914''. Victoria: Cactus Publications, 1982.</ref> Other early industries included gathering [[bison]] bones for use in fertilizer manufacturing, the making of bone china and sugar refining. [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] residents also ran a successful [[Red River ox cart]] \"freighting\" business along the [[Swift Current-Battleford Trail]] to [[Battleford]] until the late 1880s. During the [[North-West Rebellion|Riel Rebellion]] of 1885, Swift Current became a major military base and troop mustering area due to its proximity to Battleford but this was only for a short time. On February 4, 1904, the [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] became a village and then a town on March 15, 1907, when a [[census]] indicated a population of 550. Swift Current became incorporated as a city on January 15, 1914, with Frank E. West being the mayor at the time.\n\nThe [[Swift Current Airport]] was taken over by the city of Swift Current from [[Transport Canada]] in 1996. Airport services were then contracted out. There have been recent (2005\u20132006) plans to expand and revitalize the airport alongside the rural municipalities surrounding Swift Current.\n\nSwift Current is sometimes known as \"Speedy Creek\", \"Swift\", or \"Swifty\".\n\nSwift Current's official slogan is \"Where Life Makes Sense\".\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:Lyric Theatre Swift Current.JPG|thumb|left|Lyric Theatre in downtown Swift Current]]\nSwift Current is home to Saskatchewan's oldest operating theatre: the [[Lyric Theatre (Swift Current)|Lyric Theatre]], built in 1912 at a cost of $50,000 is the \"crown jewel\" of Swift Current's historical downtown buildings, with instantly recognizable advertisements painted on the north and south sides of the building dating back to the early 1920s. The building has served many functions over the years: at first it housed glamorous [[vaudeville]] performances by traveling companies, was later converted into a movie theatre and, in the mid-1980s, a bar and nightclub. A volunteer non-profit group (Southwest Cultural Development Group) purchased the facility in 2005 and is raising money for its preservation while staging cultural events, such as a mock [[Chautauqua]] annually in July, since 2008, open mic nights throughout the year, and administering rentals of the building. The current musician in residence is Al Hudec.\n\nSwift Current's tallest commercial building is the EI Wood Building, located downtown.\n\nThe longest running business in Swift Current is the Imperial Hotel, also known as \"The Big Eye\" due to the large eye painted on the side.

Tommy, feigns ambivalence about the mission's end but when left alone in the kitchen he loses his normally cool demeanor and breaks down into uncontrollable sobbing over the team's pending departure. The party culminates with a performance of \"Fly Me to the Moon\" by an [[Elvis Costello]].\n\nIn the ending moments of the series, the family sits in the Rambler and the same spot where they first appeared, and discuss all the things they're going to miss on Earth, which prompts Mary to panic and decide that she can't go with them.  Dick escorts her out of the Rambler and agrees to perform a memory-wiping technique on her, one that erases her memories of him but leaves the feelings associated with their love still in her mind. Harry leaves his coat behind for Mary to lay on until she regains consciousness.\n\nThe family sits in the Rambler, and Sally begins to cry.  Tommy and Harry begin to sing their mission song.  Sally and Dick join in, and as the song reaches its crescendo, the four of them beam away.\n\n===Alternate ending===\nA [[cliffhanger]] was filmed to leave open the possibility for the series to return.

It was 139 episodes, laughing all the way. I must say the feeling is melancholy; we really did love it all the way up to the end.

The party culminates with a performance of \"Fly Me to the Moon\" by an [[Elvis Costello]].\n\nIn the ending moments of the series, the family sits in the Rambler and the same spot where they first appeared, and discuss all the things they're going to miss on Earth, which prompts Mary to panic and decide that she can't go with them.  Dick escorts her out of the Rambler and agrees to perform a memory-wiping technique on her, one that erases her memories of him but leaves the feelings associated with their love still in her mind. Harry leaves his coat behind for Mary to lay on until she regains consciousness.\n\nThe family sits in the Rambler, and Sally begins to cry.  Tommy and Harry begin to sing their mission song.  Sally and Dick join in, and as the song reaches its crescendo, the four of them beam away.\n\n===Alternate ending===\nA [[cliffhanger]] was filmed to leave open the possibility for the series to return.

Suddenly, a naked Dick appears in the passenger seat and tells Mary \"I couldn't leave without you\", although Mary has no memory of him. Upon realizing this Dick screams \"Alien abduction! Alien abduction!\" and then beams himself and Mary aboard the mother-ship.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[John Lithgow]] as [[Dick Solomon]]\n*[[French Stewart]] as [[Harry Solomon]]\n*[[Kristen Johnston]] as [[Sally Solomon]]\n*[[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as [[Tommy Solomon (3rd Rock from the Sun)|Tommy Solomon]]\n*[[Simbi Khali]] as [[List of 3rd Rock from the Sun characters#Nina Campbell|Nina Campbell]]\n*[[Elmarie Wendel]] as [[Mamie Dubcek]]\n*[[Wayne Knight]] as [[Don Orville]]\n*[[Jane Curtin]] as [[Dr. Mary Albright]]\n\n===Recurring cast===\n*[[Ian Lithgow]] as Leon\n*[[David DeLuise]] as Bug Polland\n*[[Chris Hogan]] as Aubrey Pitman\n*[[Danielle Nicolet]] as Caryn\n*[[Ileen Getz]] as Dr. [[Judith Draper]]\n*Ron West as Dr. [[Vincent Strudwick (3rd Rock from the Sun)|Vincent Strudwick]]\n\n==Production==\nBefore the episode aired, John Lithgow told the press, \"We end it in a blaze of glory.

Finding himself ethically opposed to bioengineering, he began to travel and research the politics of food, and work as an artist in London, Ontario.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1979, he worked as a brakeman and conductor on the Norfolk and Western (Wabash) Railway, and was a member of the United Transportation Union. In 1973 he began to travel frequently in Mexico, Central & South America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. In March 1980, he attended the World Conference of Indigenous Peoples, in Ollantaytambo, Peru, as an official artist/observer.\n\nFrom 1975 through 1981, Ron was a member of the Forest City Artists' Association, and was manager of the [[Forest City Gallery]] in 1980\u201381. In 1983 he co-founded the Embassy Cultural House and served on the board until 1990. Co-organized the M\u00e9rida/London exchange (1980/81), as well as the Havana/London exchange (1988). In 1989 he was an artist/observer of the 3rd [[Havana Biennial]].\n\nIn 2000 he was awarded the Canada Council Studio in Paris.\n\nIn 2010 he was appointed Adjunct Research Professor in the Visual Arts Department, [[University of Western Ontario|Western University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vac.ca/ronbenner.html|title=Ron Benner - Trans/mission: Barley-Corn-Maize|website=Visual Arts Centre of Clarington|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHis mixed media photographic installations are in the collections of the [[National Gallery of Canada]], the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]], [[Hart House (University of Toronto)|Hart House]] (The University of Toronto), [[Museum London]] (London, Ontario), McIntosh Gallery (The University of Western Ontario), The Canada Council Art Bank and the [[Casa de las Am\u00e9ricas|Casa de Las Americas]] (Havana, Cuba).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cacnart.com/ron-benner|title=Ron Benner|website=cacnart|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\n== Selected solo exhibitions ==\n\n* 2019 \u00a0''Trans/mission: Barley \u2013 Corn \u2013 Maize'', Visual Arts Centre of Clarington, Bowmanville, ON, a year-long site-specific installation responding to the architecture and history of the former barley mill, curator Sandy Saad<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vac.ca/ronbenner.html|title=Ron Benner - Trans/mission: Barley-Corn-Maize|website=Visual Arts Centre of Clarington|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n* 2017-  ''Trans/mission: Native to the Americas,'' permanent photographic/garden installation, sunken garden of the Wilfrid Laurier Library, organized by the Robert Langen Art Gallery, Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, ON<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://library.wlu.ca/events/exhibition-transend-meeting-room|title=Exhibition: Transend: Meeting Room|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n* 2017 \u00a0''Transend: Meeting Room'', Robert Langen Art Gallery, [[Wilfrid Laurier University]], Waterloo, ON, curator Suzanne Luke<ref name=\":2\" />\n* 2016/17 ''Trans/mission: 101,'' photographic/garden installation, [https://kwag.ca/ Kitchener-Waterloo Art Gallery], Kitchener, ON, curator Crystal Mowry presented in concert with CAFKA 16 (Contemporary Art Forum Kitchener Area)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kwag.ca/content/ron-benner-transmission-101|title=Ron Benner // Trans/mission: 101|last=smitchell|date=2017-05-17|website=kwag.ca|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n* 2015\u00a0''Ron Benner: 3 Questions'', McIntosh Gallery, Western University, London, ON, curator Julian Haladyn<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mcintoshgallery.ca/exhibitions/past/2015.html|title=2015|website=mcintoshgallery.ca|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n* 2015  ''All That Has Value'', 3 guerrilla garden installations, in collaboration with CUPE, London, ON\n* 2015 \u00a0''In Digestion'', [[Museum London]], London, ON<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://museumlondon.ca/exhibitions/in-digestion|title=Exhibitions - Museum London|website=museumlondon.ca|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n* 2013\u00a0 ''Insubstantial Equivalence'', photographic/garden installation, curator Peter Dykhuis, on the university campus in partnership with the agricultural faculty and the Dalhousie Art Gallery, Halifax, NS<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dal.ca/news/2013/10/03/food-for-thought.html|title=Food for thought|website=Dalhousie News|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n* 2012-15 \u00a0''Cuitlacoche \u2013 Your\u00a0 Disease Our Delicacy'',\u00a0 photographic/garden installation, curator Su Ying\u00a0 Lee, Hart House and Justina M.

Pulis had a 17-year career as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] where he played for [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]], [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]], [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]] and [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]]. He also had a short spell in [[Hong Kong]] with [[Happy Valley AA|Happy Valley]].\n\nPulis took his first steps into management at Bournemouth, where he was a player/coach and then [[Harry Redknapp]]'s assistant.<ref name='vital'/> He then took control when Redknapp left the club.<ref name='vital'/> He then went on to [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] before leaving in 1999 after a dispute with chairman [[Paul Scally]]. Pulis then had unsuccessful spells at [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] before being appointed manager of [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in 2002. He guided Stoke through a tough 2002\u201303 season avoiding relegation to the Second Division on the final day of the season. He spent two more seasons with Stoke before being sacked by Stoke's Icelandic board for \"failing to exploit the foreign market\". He spent the 2005\u201306 season at [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] before returning to Stoke along with [[Peter Coates]]. After narrowly missing out on a play-off spot in the 2006\u201307 season he guided Stoke to the [[Premier League]] in the 2007\u201308 season by finishing runners-up in the Championship.\n\nWith Stoke amongst the favourites for relegation upon their return to the top flight after a 23-year absence, Stoke went on to comfortably survive and finished in 12th position. Pulis made history during the 2010\u201311 season as he guided Stoke to their first [[FA Cup Final]] after beating [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] 5\u20130 in the semi-final. The ''Potters'', however, lost the final 1\u20130 to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], but had the consolation of qualifying for European football. In the [[UEFA Europa League]], Stoke lost 2\u20130 on aggregate in the round of 32 to Spanish giants [[Valencia CF|Valencia]]. The [[2012\u201313 Stoke City F.C. season|2012\u201313 season]] saw Stoke make little progress and Pulis left the club by mutual consent on 21 May 2013.\n\nPulis returned to management on 23 November 2013 joining [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on a two-and-a-half-year contract. He guided Palace away from relegation, to their highest Premier League finish of 11th in [[2013\u201314 Crystal Palace F.C. season|2013\u201314]], which earned him the [[Premier League Manager of the Season]] award. He left the club, however, shortly before the start of the subsequent season. He joined [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in January 2015, a post he held until November 2017. Pulis achieved a top half finish with West Brom in the 2016\u201317 season, finishing 10th, but the club made a poor start to the following season, culminating in his sacking. On Boxing Day 2017, Pulis was appointed manager of [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], a post he held until May 2019.\n\n==Playing career==\nPulis began his career at [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] where he joined their school of football excellence in [[Eastville, Bristol|Eastville]] from [[Newport YMCA A.F.C.|Newport YMCA]]. Pulis cites his time at Eastville as an excellent grounding with his Rovers team mate and friend [[Ian Holloway]] also making it in football management. \"We learned our trade at a football club with really, really good people who had old fashioned values,\" I truly believe that it's because of the way we were brought up back then that we have managed to go on and achieve what we have done in the game. \"The basic principles were drilled into us, both on and off the pitch.

Pulis had a 17-year career as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] where he played for [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]], [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]], [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]] and [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]]. He also had a short spell in [[Hong Kong]] with [[Happy Valley AA|Happy Valley]].\n\nPulis took his first steps into management at Bournemouth, where he was a player/coach and then [[Harry Redknapp]]'s assistant.<ref name='vital'/> He then took control when Redknapp left the club.<ref name='vital'/> He then went on to [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] before leaving in 1999 after a dispute with chairman [[Paul Scally]]. Pulis then had unsuccessful spells at [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] before being appointed manager of [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in 2002. He guided Stoke through a tough 2002\u201303 season avoiding relegation to the Second Division on the final day of the season. He spent two more seasons with Stoke before being sacked by Stoke's Icelandic board for \"failing to exploit the foreign market\". He spent the 2005\u201306 season at [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] before returning to Stoke along with [[Peter Coates]]. After narrowly missing out on a play-off spot in the 2006\u201307 season he guided Stoke to the [[Premier League]] in the 2007\u201308 season by finishing runners-up in the Championship.\n\nWith Stoke amongst the favourites for relegation upon their return to the top flight after a 23-year absence, Stoke went on to comfortably survive and finished in 12th position. Pulis made history during the 2010\u201311 season as he guided Stoke to their first [[FA Cup Final]] after beating [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] 5\u20130 in the semi-final. The ''Potters'', however, lost the final 1\u20130 to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], but had the consolation of qualifying for European football. In the [[UEFA Europa League]], Stoke lost 2\u20130 on aggregate in the round of 32 to Spanish giants [[Valencia CF|Valencia]]. The [[2012\u201313 Stoke City F.C. season|2012\u201313 season]] saw Stoke make little progress and Pulis left the club by mutual consent on 21 May 2013.\n\nPulis returned to management on 23 November 2013 joining [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on a two-and-a-half-year contract. He guided Palace away from relegation, to their highest Premier League finish of 11th in [[2013\u201314 Crystal Palace F.C. season|2013\u201314]], which earned him the [[Premier League Manager of the Season]] award. He left the club, however, shortly before the start of the subsequent season. He joined [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in January 2015, a post he held until November 2017. Pulis achieved a top half finish with West Brom in the 2016\u201317 season, finishing 10th, but the club made a poor start to the following season, culminating in his sacking. On Boxing Day 2017, Pulis was appointed manager of [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], a post he held until May 2019.\n\n==Playing career==\nPulis began his career at [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] where he joined their school of football excellence in [[Eastville, Bristol|Eastville]] from [[Newport YMCA A.F.C.|Newport YMCA]]. Pulis cites his time at Eastville as an excellent grounding with his Rovers team mate and friend [[Ian Holloway]] also making it in football management. \"We learned our trade at a football club with really, really good people who had old fashioned values,\" I truly believe that it's because of the way we were brought up back then that we have managed to go on and achieve what we have done in the game. \"The basic principles were drilled into us, both on and off the pitch.

He returned to Rovers the following year and made a further 45 league appearances before moving to his home town club [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] in 1984.

Pulis spent two seasons [[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393]] and [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]] at Bournemouth, both seasons saw the ''Cherries'' finish in 17th position before moving on.<ref name=\"vital\"/>\n\n===Gillingham===\nPulis then joined [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] in the summer of 1995,<ref name=\"vital\"/> whom he managed for a further four seasons, turning a team that had struggled at the very bottom of the Football League into a promotion winning one in his first season, and laying the foundations for the club's eventual elevation to the First Division for the first time in their history.

There would still be some at-large seats under this format. The primary argument for this has been that City Councilors live in only four of the city's wards. An initiative to change the composition failed to pass the City Council twice. In 2007 Mayor Charles V. Ryan and City Councilor Jose Tosado proposed a home-rule amendment that would expand the council to thirteen members adding four seats to the existing nine member at large system, but allocated between eight ward and five at large seats. This home-rule petition was adopted by the City Council 8\u20131, and was later passed by the State Senate and House and signed by the Governor. On election day, November 6, 2007, city residents voted overwhelmingly in favor of changing the City Council and School Committee.

The city's School Committee {{When|date=October 2009}} passed a new neighborhood school program to improve schools and reduce the growing busing costs associated with the current plan. The plan faces stiff opposition from parents and minority groups who claim that the schools are still unequal. The city is required under a 1970s court order to balance schools racially, which had necessitated busing. However, since then, the city and the school's population has shifted and many of the neighborhoods are more [[Racial integration|integrated]], calling into question the need for busing at all. Though the plan is likely to be challenged in court, the state [[Board of Education]] decided it did not have authority to review it, sidestepping the volatile issue while effectively condoning it.

WWLP also operated WRLP (UHF 32), a UHF station licensed to [[Greenfield, Massachusetts|Greenfield]], whose transmitter was in [[Winchester, New Hampshire]], as well as W69AQ (UHF 69), a low power station that transmitted from the WWLP tower on Provin Mountain. WWLP remains the only full-power station in the market with an analog television signal on the air.\n* '''[[WGGB]], UHF 40 (Digital 40).''' WGGB is the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and primary [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], secondary [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate for the area. WGGB is owned and operated by the [[Meredith Corporation]] and its studios are on Liberty Street near the Chicopee line. WGGB (originally WHYN) signed on on April 1, 1953, on Channel 55. In 1958, WHYN switched to UHF 40. Guy Gannett Broadcasting bought the station in 1979 and changed its call sign to the current WGGB-TV effective at the start of the following year. In 2008, WGGB launched a secondary service called \"Fox 6\", named after its channel position on the local [[Comcast]] cable TV lineup. FOX6 also appears on WGGB's [[Digital Television|DTV]] sub-channel 40.2. WGGB's analog television signal signed off permanently in late November 2008, due to a transmitter failure. WGGB and WSHM-LD broadcast local news under the branding \"Western Mass News\", and maintain a relationship with the ''[[Springfield Republican]]''.\n* '''[[WSHM-LD]], VHF 3.5 (Digital 21).''' WSHM-LD is Springfield's [[CBS]] affiliate operated by Hartford's [[WFSB]]. WSHM is owned and operated by the Meredith Corporation and shares studios with WGGB on Liberty Street near the Chicopee line. WSHM-LD and WGGB broadcast local news under the branding \"Western Mass News\", and maintain a relationship with the ''[[Springfield Republican]]''. WSHM-LD was formerly W67DF, a translator of [[Trinity Broadcasting Network|TBN]], before being sold to Meredith. WSHM-LD is referred to as \"CBS 3\", denoting its cable channel assignment within the market and to encourage long-time viewers of WFSB to stay with WSHM-LD.\n* '''[[WGBY]], UHF 57 (Digital 58 until April 18, 2009, Digital 22 thereafter).''' WGBY is the [[PBS]] member station for the area. WGBY's studios are in downtown Springfield, near Interstate 91 and the [[Conrail]] train lines. WGBY signed on in 1963. WGBY is owned by the Boston-based [[WGBH Educational Foundation]]. WGBY signed off their analog signal permanently in November 2008, to allow for the replacement of [[transmitting antenna|transmission antennas]].\n\n====Cable operators====\n\nSpringfield proper is serviced exclusively by [[Comcast]] cable.

The current [[charter|city charter]], in effect since 1959, uses a \"strong mayor\" government with most power concentrated in the [[mayor of Springfield, Massachusetts|mayor]], as in Boston and elsewhere. The mayor representing the city's executive branch presents the budget, appoints commissioners and department heads, and in general runs the city. The mayor is former City Councilor [[Domenic Sarno]], elected November 6, 2007, by a margin of 52.54% to 47.18% against incumbent Charles Ryan. He took office in January 2008. In November 2009 and 2011, Sarno won reelection, albeit\u2014in the latter case\u2014with just 22% of eligible Springfield voters voting.<ref name=\"valleyadvocate\">{{cite news |last=Turner |first=Maureen |date=8 December 2011 |title=News\u2014Where Were They on Election Day?

There would still be some at-large seats under this format. The primary argument for this has been that City Councilors live in only four of the city's wards. An initiative to change the composition failed to pass the City Council twice. In 2007 Mayor Charles V. Ryan and City Councilor Jose Tosado proposed a home-rule amendment that would expand the council to thirteen members adding four seats to the existing nine member at large system, but allocated between eight ward and five at large seats. This home-rule petition was adopted by the City Council 8\u20131, and was later passed by the State Senate and House and signed by the Governor. On election day, November 6, 2007, city residents voted overwhelmingly in favor of changing the City Council and School Committee. The ballot initiative that established a new council with five at-large seats and eight ward seats passed 3\u20131. On November 3, 2009, Springfield held its first ward elections in 50 years.\n\n===Crime===\n\nIn 2010, Springfield ranked 35th in the United States' City Crime Rankings\u2014its second-lowest ranking in recent years, (in 2009, it ranked 51st).

There are also two charter secondary schools in the City of Springfield: SABIS International, which ranks among the top 5% of high schools nationally in academic quality, and the Hampden Charter School of Science. The city's School Committee {{When|date=October 2009}} passed a new neighborhood school program to improve schools and reduce the growing busing costs associated with the current plan. The plan faces stiff opposition from parents and minority groups who claim that the schools are still unequal. The city is required under a 1970s court order to balance schools racially, which had necessitated busing. However, since then, the city and the school's population has shifted and many of the neighborhoods are more [[Racial integration|integrated]], calling into question the need for busing at all. Though the plan is likely to be challenged in court, the state [[Board of Education]] decided it did not have authority to review it, sidestepping the volatile issue while effectively condoning it. In June 2015, [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] [[Charlie Baker]] announced $3.2 million in grants to three underperforming middle schools in Springfield.<ref>{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Michelle|title=State awards $4.48 million to school turnaround efforts in Springfield, Worcester|website=[[The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)|MassLive.com]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|url=https://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/06/state_awards_over_four_million.html|date=June 8, 2015|accessdate=June 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Private schools====\n\nThe [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Springfield in Massachusetts|Roman Catholic Diocese of Springfield]] operated five Catholic elementary schools in the city, all of which were consolidated into a single entity, St. Michael's Academy, in the autumn of 2009.<ref>[http://www.masslive.com/metrowest/republican/index.ssf?/base/news-17/1232787365176350.xml&coll=1 Catholic grade schools remade], ''The Republican'', January 24, 2009</ref> The non-denominational [[Pioneer Valley Christian School]] is located in the suburban [[Sixteen Acres, Springfield, Massachusetts|Sixteen Acres]] neighborhood, educating K\u201312.
