A few years later, a cousin of Arjun's friend, named Kishore ([[Vennela Kishore]]) becomes mentally disturbed and feels possessed by a spirit in his body. For treatment Arjun takes Kishore to [[Kerala]]. While Kishore is being treated, Arjun is attracted to a girl named Amala ([[Hebah Patel]]), who reminded him about Ayesha in terms of attitude. After finishing Kishore's treatment, Arjun is once again left heartbroken as Amala leaves the place without even informing him. Arjun goes after Amala to her village, Vijayawada, and gets shocked by knowing that Amala met with an accident four years back and the girl whom he met in Kerala is not Amala. Back in Hyderabad, Arjun meets the girl who posed to be Amala and finds that her actual name is Nithya and gets to know that in the past Nithya was possessed by a spirit whose name was Amala and for treatment Nithya went to Kerala. Gradually, Nithya and Arjun grow closer. But at that time Amala's spirit enters another girl's body whose name is Parvati ([[Nandita Swetha]]) and comes to Arjun's house. Arjun, although tensed, maintains a normal behaviour with Amala. Gradually Arjun's close behavior with Nithya makes Amala (Parvati) furious and emotional as she becomes possessive about Arjun. At that point, Amala reveals the truth that she is none other than Ayesha ([[Avika Gor]]) (actual name is Amala but Arjun thought as Ayesha)- the same girl to whom Arjun was supposed to get married, but unfortunately on the day of marriage, she meets with an accident and dies on the spot. She says that she saved the girl named Parvathi when she was attempting a suicide because she was supposed to marry her uncle whom she doesn't like. After hearing all this Arjun feels guilty and sad that he couldn't identify her and he tries to stop her but Amala does not pay heed to any of his pleas. Amala feels that Arjun no longer loves her and leaves Parvathi's body. After gaining consciousness, Parvathi is unable to recognize Arjun and at this point of time Parvathi's uncle ([[Raja Ravindra]]) comes there and beats up Arjun. When he is about to kill Arjun, Amala once again enters Parvathi's body and saves Arjun. While in the hospital, Amala gets to know from Nithya that Arjun is still in love with her and that's why he said no to Nithya's love proposal, but at this time Kishore with the help of Swamiji, who cured him in Kerala makes Amala's soul leave Parvathi body and captures it.Swami consoles Arjun that it's against God's will for a soul to live on earth after death.A few months later Arjun meets Nithya on road and he finds that some of her behaviour resembles that of Amala(it is shown in the credits that's the bottle in which Amala was captured is now broken implying that it was in fact Amala in Nithya's body again) and ends up proposing her for marriage and Parvati returns home but her uncle says to marry the guy of her choice and runs away because of her behaviour in Arjun's house.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Nikhil Siddharth]] as Arjun  \n*[[Hebah Patel]] as Nithya / Amala (voice dubbed by Lipsika)\n*[[Nandita Swetha]] as Parvathi /Amala (voice dubbed by Kranthi)\n*[[Avika Gor]] as Amala/Ayesha (Kamala in Hindi version) (voice dubbed by Mahathi)\n*[[Vennela Kishore]] as Kishore\n*[[Annapoorna (actress)|Annapoorna]] as Nithya's grandmother\n*[[Sathya (Telugu actor)|Sathya]] as Satya, Arjun's friend \n*Sudharshan as Arjun's friend \n*Josh Ravi as Arjun's friend\n*[[Viva Harsha]] as Arjun's friend \n*[[Tanikella Bharani]] as Amala's father\n*[[Raja Ravindra]] as Parvathi's uncle\n*[[Pruthviraj Balireddy|Prudhviraj]] as Dr. Akash\n*[[Praveen (actor)|Praveen]] as Ghanta Ram\n*[[Fish Venkat]]\n*Swamiji (voice dubbed by [[R.C.M.

The most important tenet is that young children need to develop a relationship with at least one primary caregiver for normal social and emotional development. The theory was formulated by psychiatrist and psychoanalyst [[John Bowlby]].<ref name=\"Cassidy\">{{cite encyclopedia |year=1999 |title=The Nature of a Child's Ties |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York | veditors = Cassidy J, Shaver PR |pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookofattach0000unse/page/3 3\u201320] |isbn=1572300876 | vauthors = Cassidy J |url=https://archive.org/details/handbookofattach0000unse/page/3 }}</ref>\n\nWithin attachment theory, infant behaviour associated with attachment is primarily the seeking of [[Wikt:proximity|proximity]] to an attachment figure in stressful situations. Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in [[social interaction]]s with them, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some months during the period from about six months to two years of age. During the latter part of this period, children begin to use attachment figures (familiar people) as a secure base to explore from and return to. Parental responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment; these, in turn, lead to internal working models which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts and expectations in later relationships.<ref name=\"Bretherton/Mul\">{{cite encyclopedia |year=1999 |title=Internal Working Models in Attachment Relationships: A Construct Revisited |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment:Theory, Research and Clinical Applications |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York | veditors = Cassidy J, Shaver PR |pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookofattach0000unse/page/89 89\u2013114] |isbn=1572300876 |author=Bretherton I, Munholland KA |url=https://archive.org/details/handbookofattach0000unse/page/89 }}</ref> Separation anxiety or grief following the loss of an attachment figure is considered to be a normal and adaptive response for an attached infant.

In the early days of the theory, academic psychologists criticized Bowlby, and the psychoanalytic community ostracised him for his departure from psychoanalytical tenets;<ref name=\"Rutter 95\" /> however, attachment theory has since become the dominant approach to understanding early social development, and has given rise to a great surge of [[empirical research]] into the formation of children's close relationships.<ref name=\"Schaffer\" /> Later criticisms of attachment theory relate to temperament, the complexity of social relationships, and the limitations of discrete patterns for classifications. Attachment theory has been significantly modified as a result of empirical research, but the concepts have become generally accepted.<ref name=\"Rutter 95\" /> Attachment theory has formed the basis of new therapies and informed existing ones, and its concepts have been used in the formulation of social and childcare policies to support the early attachment relationships of children.<ref name=\"BZL\" />\n\n==Attachment==\n[[Image:Mozambique024.jpg|thumb|alt=A young mother smiles up at the camera. On her back is her baby gazing at the camera with an expression of lively interest.|right|Although it is usual for the mother to be the primary attachment figure, infants will form attachments to any carer who is sensitive and responsive in social interactions with them.]]\n\nWithin attachment theory, ''attachment'' means an [[Affectional bond|affectional bond]] or tie between an individual and an attachment figure (usually a caregiver). Such bonds may be reciprocal between two adults, but between a child and a caregiver these bonds are based on the child's need for safety, security and protection, paramount in infancy and childhood. The theory proposes that children attach to carers instinctively,<ref name=\"BrethQuote\">{{cite news|author=Bretherton I|title=The Origins of Attachment Theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth|year=1992|quote=[Bowlby] begins by noting that organisms at different levels of the phylogenetic scale regulate instinctive behavior in distinct ways, ranging from primitive reflex-like \"fixed action patterns\" to complex plan hierarchies with subgoals and strong learning components. In the most complex organisms, instinctive behaviors may be \"goal-corrected\" with continual on-course adjustments (such as a bird of prey adjusting its flight to the movements of the prey). The concept of cybernetically controlled behavioral systems organized as plan hierarchies (Miller, Galanter, and Pribram, 1960) thus came to replace Freud's concept of drive and instinct. Such systems regulate behaviors in ways that need not be rigidly innate, but \u2013 depending on the organism \u2013 can adapt in greater or lesser degrees to changes in environmental circumstances, provided that these do not deviate too much from the organism's environment of evolutionary adaptedness. Such flexible organisms pay a price, however, because adaptable behavioral systems can more easily be subverted from their optimal path of development. For humans, Bowlby speculates, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness probably resembles that of present-day hunter-gatherer societies.}}</ref> for the purpose of survival and, ultimately, genetic replication.<ref name=pg15/> The biological aim is survival and the psychological aim is security.<ref name=\"Schaffer\"/> Attachment theory is not an exhaustive description of human relationships, nor is it synonymous with love and affection, although these may indicate that bonds exist. In child-to-adult relationships, the child's tie is called the \"attachment\" and the caregiver's reciprocal equivalent is referred to as the \"care-giving bond\".<ref name=pg15>[[#PriorGlaser06|Prior and Glaser]] p. 15.</ref>\n\nInfants will form attachments to any consistent caregiver who is sensitive and responsive in social interactions with them. The quality of the social engagement is more influential than the amount of time spent. The biological mother is the usual principal attachment figure, but the role can be taken by anyone who consistently behaves in a \"mothering\" way over a period of time. Within attachment theory, this means a set of behaviours that involves engaging in lively social interaction with the infant and responding readily to signals and approaches.<ref>Bowlby (1969) p. 365.</ref> Nothing in the theory suggests that fathers are not equally likely to become principal attachment figures if they provide most of the child care and related social interaction.<ref>[[#Holmes93|Holmes]] p. 69.</ref>\n\nSome infants direct attachment behaviour (proximity seeking) towards more than one attachment figure almost as soon as they start to show discrimination between caregivers; most come to do so during their second year. These figures are arranged hierarchically, with the principal attachment figure at the top.<ref>Bowlby (1969) 2nd ed. pp. 304\u201305.</ref> The set-goal of the attachment behavioural system is to maintain a bond with an accessible and available attachment figure.<ref name=kobmad>{{cite encyclopedia|author= Kobak R, Madsen S|year=2008|title= Disruption in Attachment Bonds|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| veditors = Cassidy J, Shaver PR | publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=23\u201347|isbn=9781593858742}}</ref> \"Alarm\" is the term used for activation of the attachment behavioural system caused by fear of danger. \"Anxiety\" is the anticipation or fear of being cut off from the attachment figure.

By age three or four, physical separation is no longer such a threat to the child's bond with the attachment figure.

During the first phase (the first eight weeks), infants smile, babble, and cry to attract the attention of potential caregivers. Although infants of this age learn to discriminate between caregivers, these behaviours are directed at anyone in the vicinity.\n\nDuring the second phase (two to six months), the infant discriminates between familiar and unfamiliar adults, becoming more responsive toward the caregiver; following and clinging are added to the range of behaviours. The infant's behaviour toward the caregiver becomes organized on a goal-directed basis to achieve the conditions that make it feel secure.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=19}}\n\nBy the end of the first year, the infant is able to display a range of attachment behaviours designed to maintain proximity. These manifest as protesting the caregiver's departure, greeting the caregiver's return, clinging when frightened, and following when able.{{sfn|Karen|1998|pp=90\u201392}}\n\nWith the development of locomotion, the infant begins to use the caregiver or caregivers as a \"safe base\" from which to explore.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=19}}<ref>{{cite book |title=Disorders of childhood : development and psychopathology | first1 = Robin Hornik | last1 = Parritz | first2 = Michael F | last2 = Troy | name-list-format = vanc |date=2017-05-24 |isbn=9781337098113 |edition=Third |location=Boston, MA |oclc=960031712}}</ref>{{Rp|71}} Infant exploration is greater when the caregiver is present because the infant's attachment system is relaxed and it is free to explore.

The long-term evolution of these species has involved selection for social behaviors that make individual or group survival more likely. The commonly observed attachment behaviour of toddlers staying near familiar people would have had safety advantages in the environment of early adaptation, and has similar advantages today. Bowlby saw the environment of early adaptation as similar to current [[hunter-gatherer]] societies.{{sfn|Bowlby|1971|p=300}} There is a survival advantage in the capacity to sense possibly dangerous conditions such as unfamiliarity, being alone, or rapid approach. According to Bowlby, proximity-seeking to the attachment figure in the face of threat is the \"set-goal\" of the attachment behavioural system.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nBowlby's original account of a [[Critical period|sensitivity period]] during which attachments can form of between six months and two to three years has been modified by later researchers. These researchers have shown there is indeed a sensitive period during which attachments will form if possible, but the time frame is broader and the effect less fixed and irreversible than first proposed.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nWith further research, authors discussing attachment theory have come to appreciate social development is affected by later as well as earlier relationships. Early steps in attachment take place most easily if the infant has one caregiver, or the occasional care of a small number of other people. According to Bowlby, almost from the beginning, many children have more than one figure toward whom they direct attachment behaviour.

The extent of exploration and of distress are affected, however, by the child's temperamental make-up and by situational factors as well as by attachment status. A child's attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver's sensitivity to their needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond to their child's needs will create securely attached children. Such children are certain that their parents will be responsive to their needs and communications.<ref>[[Daniel Schacter|Schacter, D.L.]] et al. (2009). Psychology, Second Edition. New York: Worth Publishers. pp.441</ref>\n\nIn the traditional Ainsworth et al. (1978) coding of the Strange Situation, secure infants are denoted as \"Group B\" infants and they are further subclassified as B1, B2, B3, and B4.<ref name=\"Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M.

B1's have been referred to as \"secure-reserved\", B2's as \"secure-inhibited\", B3's as \"secure-balanced\", and B4's as \"secure-reactive\". However, in academic publications the classification of infants (if subgroups are denoted) is typically simply \"B1\" or \"B2\", although more theoretical and review-oriented papers surrounding attachment theory may use the above terminology. Secure attachment is the most common type of attachment relationship seen throughout societies. {{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nSecurely attached children are best able to explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base (their caregiver) to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child in how to cope with the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment can be seen as the most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.<ref name=\"Aronoff, J. 2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Aronoff J |year=2012 |title=Parental Nurturance in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample: Theory, Coding, and Scores |journal=Cross-Cultural Research |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=315\u2013347 |doi=10.1177/1069397112450851}}</ref>\n\n===Anxious-ambivalent attachment===\nAnxious-ambivalent attachment is also misnamed as \"resistant attachment\".<ref name=\"Ainsworth,1978a\">{{cite book |title=Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation |vauthors=Ainsworth MD, Blehar M, Waters E, Wall S |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=1978 |isbn=978-0-89859-461-4 |location=Hillsdale NJ}}</ref> In general, a child with an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present.

They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or turn away from the caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorized that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants was in fact a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ainsworth MD, Bell SM | title = Attachment, exploration, and separation: illustrated by the behavior of one-year-olds in a strange situation | journal = Child Development | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 49\u201367 | date = March 1970 | pmid = 5490680 | doi = 10.2307/1127388 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8272bd76f36d195023f245735e23e6b5c8b19afd | jstor = 1127388 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sroufe A, Waters E |year=1977 |title=Attachment as an Organizational Construct |journal=Child Development |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=1184\u20131199 |citeseerx=10.1.1.598.3872 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1977.tb03922.x}}</ref>\n\nInfants are depicted as anxious-avoidant when there is:<blockquote>...&nbsp;conspicuous avoidance of the mother in the reunion episodes which is likely to consist of ignoring her altogether, although there may be some pointed looking away, turning away, or moving away&nbsp;...

Firstly, avoidant behaviour allows the infant to maintain a conditional proximity with the caregiver: close enough to maintain protection, but distant enough to avoid rebuff. Secondly, the cognitive processes organising avoidant behaviour could help direct attention away from the unfulfilled desire for closeness with the caregiver\u2014avoiding a situation in which the child is overwhelmed with emotion (\"disorganized distress\"), and therefore unable to maintain control of themselves and achieve even conditional proximity.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Main M | date = 1977 | chapter = Analysis of a peculiar form of reunion behaviour seen in some day-care children. | veditors = Webb R | title = Social Development in Childhood | pages = 33\u201378 | location = Baltimore | publisher = Johns Hopkins }}</ref>\n\n==={{Anchor|disorganized attachment}}Disorganized/disoriented attachment===\nAinsworth herself was the first to find difficulties in fitting all infant behaviour into the three classifications used in her Baltimore study.

If the behaviour of the infant does not appear to the observer to be coordinated in a smooth way across episodes to achieve either proximity or some relative proximity with the caregiver, then it is considered 'disorganized' as it indicates a disruption or flooding of the attachment system (e.g. by fear). Infant behaviours in the Strange Situation Protocol coded as disorganized/disoriented include overt displays of fear; contradictory behaviours or affects occurring simultaneously or sequentially; stereotypic, asymmetric, misdirected or jerky movements; or freezing and apparent dissociation. Lyons-Ruth has urged, however, that it should be more widely \"recognized that 52% of disorganized infants continue to approach the caregiver, seek comfort, and cease their distress without clear ambivalent or avoidant behavior\".<ref>Karlen Lyons-Ruth, Jean-Francois Bureau, M.

Perhaps responding to such concerns, George and Solomon have divided among indices of disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) in the Strange Situation, treating some of the behaviours as a 'strategy of desperation' and others as evidence that the attachment system has been flooded (e.g. by fear, or anger).<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Solomon J, George C | date = 1999 | chapter = The place of disorganization in attachment theory. | veditors = Solomon J, George C | title = Attachment Disorganization | pages = 27 | location = NY | publisher = Guilford }}</ref> \n\nCrittenden also argues that some behaviour classified as Disorganized/disoriented can be regarded as more 'emergency' versions of the avoidant and/or ambivalent/resistant strategies, and function to maintain the protective availability of the caregiver to some degree.

A Japanese study in 1986 (Takahashi) studied 60 Japanese mother-infant pairs and compared them with Ainsworth's distributional pattern. Although the ranges for securely attached and insecurely attached had no significant differences in proportions, the Japanese insecure group consisted of only resistant children, with no children categorized as avoidant.  This may be because the Japanese child rearing philosophy stressed close mother infant bonds more so than in Western cultures.  In Northern Germany, Grossmann et al. (Grossmann, Huber, & Wartner, 1981; Grossmann, Spangler, Suess, & Unzner, 1985) replicated the Ainsworth Strange Situation with 46 mother infant pairs and found a different distribution of attachment classifications with a high number of avoidant infants: 52% avoidant, 34% secure, and 13% resistant (Grossmann et al., 1985).  Another study in Israel found there was a high frequency of an ambivalent pattern, which according to Grossman et al.

An example is the \"stem story\", in which a child is given the beginning of a story that raises attachment issues and asked to complete it.

This internal working model is related to the individual's state of mind which develops with respect to attachment generally and explores how attachment functions in relationship dynamics based on childhood and adolescent experience. The organization of an internal working model is generally seen as leading to more stable attachments in those who develop such a model, rather than those who rely more on the individual's state of mind alone in forming new attachments.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nAge, cognitive growth, and continued social experience advance the development and complexity of the internal working model.

As children move into the school years at about six years old, most develop a goal-corrected partnership with parents, in which each partner is willing to compromise in order to maintain a gratifying relationship.<ref name=\"Waters\" /> By middle childhood, the goal of the attachment behavioural system has changed from proximity to the attachment figure to availability. Generally, a child is content with longer separations, provided contact\u2014or the possibility of physically reuniting, if needed\u2014is available. Attachment behaviours such as clinging and following decline and self-reliance increases. By middle childhood (ages 7\u201311), there may be a shift toward mutual [[coregulation]] of secure-base contact in which caregiver and child negotiate methods of maintaining communication and supervision as the child moves toward a greater degree of independence.<ref name=\"Waters\" />\n\nThe attachment system used by adolescents is seen as a \"safety regulating system\" whose main function is to promote physical and psychological safety. There are 2 different events that can trigger the attachment system. Those triggers include, the presence of a potential danger or stress, internal and external, and a threat of accessibility and/or availability of an attachment figure. The ultimate goal of the attachment system is security, so during a time of danger or inaccessibility the behavioral system accepts felt security in the context of the availability of protection. By adolescence we are able to find security through a variety of things, such as food, exercise, and social media.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Kerns | first1 = Kathryn A. | first2 = Rhonda A. | last2 = Richardson | name-list-format = vanc | title = Attachment in Middle Childhood. | publisher = Guilford Press | date = 2005 }}</ref> Felt security can be achieved through a number of ways, and often without the physical presence of the attachment figure. Higher levels of maturity allows adolescent teens to more capably interact with their environment on their own because the environment is perceived as less threatening. Adolescents teens will also see an increase in cognitive, emotional and behavioral maturity that dictates whether or not teens are less likely to experience conditions that activate their need for an attachment figure. For example, when teenagers get sick and stay home from school, surely they want their parents to be home so they can take care of them, but they are also able to stay home by themselves without experiencing serious amounts of distress.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = McElhaney KB, Allen JP, Stephenson JC, Hare AL | chapter = Attachment and Autonomy During Adolescence | veditors = Lerner RM, Steinberg L | title = Part II: Domains of Individual Development in Adolescence | series = Handbook of Adolescent Psychology | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | date = 30 October 2009 | doi = 10.1002/9780470479193.adlpsy001012 | isbn = 978-0-470-47919-3 }}</ref>\n\nHere are the attachment style differences during adolescence:<ref name=\":8\">{{cite journal |last=Freeman |first=Harry |last2=Brown |first2=B.

Adult secure attachment comes from an individual's early connection with their caregiver(s), genes and their romantic experiences.<ref name=\"levine\">{{cite book| vauthors = Levine A, Heller R |year=2011 |title=Attached: The new science of adult attachment and how it can help you find and keep love |location=New York, NY |publisher= Penguin Group}}</ref>\n\nWithin romantic relationships, a securely attached adult will appear in the following ways: excellent conflict resolution, mentally flexible, effective communicators, avoidance of manipulation, comfortable with closeness without fearfulness of being enmeshed, quickly forgiving, viewing sex and emotional intimacy as one, believing they can positively impact their relationship, and caring for their partner how they want to be cared for. In summation, they are great partners who treat their spouses very well, as they are not afraid to give positively and ask for their needs to be met. Securely attached adults believe that there are \u201cmany potential partners that would be responsive to their needs\u201d, and if they come across an individual who is not meeting their needs, they will typically lose interest very quickly. In a study comparing secure-secure and secure-various attachment style relationships, there was no fluctuation in positive relational functioning. However, in any combination of two partners with attachment styles outside of secure, the relationships showed high levels of negative relationship functioning. This research indicates that it only takes one securely attached partner within a romantic relationship to maintain healthy, emotional relationship functioning.<ref name=\"levine\"/>\n\n'''Anxious-preoccupied''' adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent. They tend to be less trusting, have less positive views about themselves and their partners, and may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, worry and impulsiveness in their relationships. The anxiety that adults feel prevents the establishment of satisfactory defense exclusion. Thus, it is possible that individuals that have been anxiously attached to their attachment figure or figures have not been able to develop sufficient defenses against separation anxiety. Because of their lack of preparation these individuals will then overreact to the anticipation of separation or the actual separation from their attachment figure. The anxiety comes from an individual's intense and/or unstable relationship that leave the anxious or preoccupied individual relatively defenseless.<ref name=\"Sperling, Michael B. 1994\">{{cite book | last1 = Sperling | first1 = Michael B. | first2 = William H. | last2 = Berman | name-list-format = vanc | title = Attachment in Adults: Clinical and Developmental Perspectives | publisher = Guilford Press | date = 1994 }}</ref> Adults with this attachment style tend to look way too far into things, whether that's a text message or a face-to-face conversation.

They view themselves as self-sufficient, invulnerable to attachment feelings and not needing close relationships. They tend to suppress their feelings, dealing with conflict by distancing themselves from partners of whom they often have a poor opinion. Adults lack the interest of forming close relationships and maintaining emotional closeness with the people around them. They have a great amount of distrust in others but at the same time possess a positive model of self, they would prefer to invest in their own ego skills. Because of their distrust they cannot be convinced that other people have the ability to deliver emotional support. They try to create high levels of self-esteem by investing disproportionately in their abilities or accomplishments. These adults maintain their positive views of self, based on their personal achievements and competence rather than searching for and feeling acceptance from others. These adults will explicitly reject or minimize the importance of emotional attachment and passively avoid relationships when they feel as though they are becoming too close. They strive for self-reliance and independence. When it comes to the opinions of others about themselves, they are very indifferent and are relatively hesitant to positive feedback from their peers. Dismissive avoidance can also be explained as the result of defensive deactivation of the attachment system to avoid potential rejection, or genuine disregard for interpersonal closeness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Carvallo | first1 = Mauricio | last2 = Gabriel | first2 = Shira | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2006 | title = No Man Is an Island: The Need to Belong and Dismissing Avoidant Attachment Style | url = | journal = PsycEXTRA Dataset | volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1037/e511092014-160 }}</ref>\n\n'''Fearful-avoidant''' adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, both desiring and feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness.

The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies.

By contrast, adolescence-limited offenders do not have disrupted family bonds and are described as having healthy pre-delinquent development.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Life-course perspectives ===\nThe life-course perspective argues that individuals are not automatically assigned to a category in a dual taxonomy. Instead, there are within-individual changes in criminality, due to human agency.

This perception of low support from partner has been identified as a strong predictor of male violence. &nbsp;Other predictors have been named as perceived deficiency in maternal love in childhood, low self-esteem.<ref name=\":7\" /> It has also been found that individuals with a dismissive attachment style, often seen in an antisocial/narcissistic-narcissistic subtype of offender, tend to be emotionally abusive as well as violent.

Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in [[social interaction]]s with them, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some months during the period from about six months to two years of age. During the latter part of this period, children begin to use attachment figures (familiar people) as a secure base to explore from and return to.

Such bonds may be reciprocal between two adults, but between a child and a caregiver these bonds are based on the child's need for safety, security and protection, paramount in infancy and childhood. The theory proposes that children attach to carers instinctively,<ref name=\"BrethQuote\">{{cite news|author=Bretherton I|title=The Origins of Attachment Theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth|year=1992|quote=[Bowlby] begins by noting that organisms at different levels of the phylogenetic scale regulate instinctive behavior in distinct ways, ranging from primitive reflex-like \"fixed action patterns\" to complex plan hierarchies with subgoals and strong learning components. In the most complex organisms, instinctive behaviors may be \"goal-corrected\" with continual on-course adjustments (such as a bird of prey adjusting its flight to the movements of the prey). The concept of cybernetically controlled behavioral systems organized as plan hierarchies (Miller, Galanter, and Pribram, 1960) thus came to replace Freud's concept of drive and instinct. Such systems regulate behaviors in ways that need not be rigidly innate, but \u2013 depending on the organism \u2013 can adapt in greater or lesser degrees to changes in environmental circumstances, provided that these do not deviate too much from the organism's environment of evolutionary adaptedness. Such flexible organisms pay a price, however, because adaptable behavioral systems can more easily be subverted from their optimal path of development. For humans, Bowlby speculates, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness probably resembles that of present-day hunter-gatherer societies.}}</ref> for the purpose of survival and, ultimately, genetic replication.<ref name=pg15/> The biological aim is survival and the psychological aim is security.<ref name=\"Schaffer\"/> Attachment theory is not an exhaustive description of human relationships, nor is it synonymous with love and affection, although these may indicate that bonds exist. In child-to-adult relationships, the child's tie is called the \"attachment\" and the caregiver's reciprocal equivalent is referred to as the \"care-giving bond\".<ref name=pg15>[[#PriorGlaser06|Prior and Glaser]] p. 15.</ref>\n\nInfants will form attachments to any consistent caregiver who is sensitive and responsive in social interactions with them. The quality of the social engagement is more influential than the amount of time spent. The biological mother is the usual principal attachment figure, but the role can be taken by anyone who consistently behaves in a \"mothering\" way over a period of time. Within attachment theory, this means a set of behaviours that involves engaging in lively social interaction with the infant and responding readily to signals and approaches.<ref>Bowlby (1969) p. 365.</ref> Nothing in the theory suggests that fathers are not equally likely to become principal attachment figures if they provide most of the child care and related social interaction.<ref>[[#Holmes93|Holmes]] p. 69.</ref>\n\nSome infants direct attachment behaviour (proximity seeking) towards more than one attachment figure almost as soon as they start to show discrimination between caregivers; most come to do so during their second year.

During the first phase (the first eight weeks), infants smile, babble, and cry to attract the attention of potential caregivers. Although infants of this age learn to discriminate between caregivers, these behaviours are directed at anyone in the vicinity.\n\nDuring the second phase (two to six months), the infant discriminates between familiar and unfamiliar adults, becoming more responsive toward the caregiver; following and clinging are added to the range of behaviours. The infant's behaviour toward the caregiver becomes organized on a goal-directed basis to achieve the conditions that make it feel secure.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=19}}\n\nBy the end of the first year, the infant is able to display a range of attachment behaviours designed to maintain proximity. These manifest as protesting the caregiver's departure, greeting the caregiver's return, clinging when frightened, and following when able.{{sfn|Karen|1998|pp=90\u201392}}\n\nWith the development of locomotion, the infant begins to use the caregiver or caregivers as a \"safe base\" from which to explore.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=19}}<ref>{{cite book |title=Disorders of childhood : development and psychopathology | first1 = Robin Hornik | last1 = Parritz | first2 = Michael F | last2 = Troy | name-list-format = vanc |date=2017-05-24 |isbn=9781337098113 |edition=Third |location=Boston, MA |oclc=960031712}}</ref>{{Rp|71}} Infant exploration is greater when the caregiver is present because the infant's attachment system is relaxed and it is free to explore.

The long-term evolution of these species has involved selection for social behaviors that make individual or group survival more likely. The commonly observed attachment behaviour of toddlers staying near familiar people would have had safety advantages in the environment of early adaptation, and has similar advantages today. Bowlby saw the environment of early adaptation as similar to current [[hunter-gatherer]] societies.{{sfn|Bowlby|1971|p=300}} There is a survival advantage in the capacity to sense possibly dangerous conditions such as unfamiliarity, being alone, or rapid approach. According to Bowlby, proximity-seeking to the attachment figure in the face of threat is the \"set-goal\" of the attachment behavioural system.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nBowlby's original account of a [[Critical period|sensitivity period]] during which attachments can form of between six months and two to three years has been modified by later researchers. These researchers have shown there is indeed a sensitive period during which attachments will form if possible, but the time frame is broader and the effect less fixed and irreversible than first proposed.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nWith further research, authors discussing attachment theory have come to appreciate social development is affected by later as well as earlier relationships. Early steps in attachment take place most easily if the infant has one caregiver, or the occasional care of a small number of other people. According to Bowlby, almost from the beginning, many children have more than one figure toward whom they direct attachment behaviour. These figures are not treated alike; there is a strong bias for a child to direct attachment behaviour mainly toward one particular person. Bowlby used the term \"monotropy\" to describe this bias.{{sfn|Bowlby|1982|p=309}} Researchers and theorists have abandoned this concept insofar as it may be taken to mean the relationship with the special figure differs ''qualitatively'' from that of other figures.

When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child in how to cope with the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment can be seen as the most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.<ref name=\"Aronoff, J. 2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Aronoff J |year=2012 |title=Parental Nurturance in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample: Theory, Coding, and Scores |journal=Cross-Cultural Research |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=315\u2013347 |doi=10.1177/1069397112450851}}</ref>\n\n===Anxious-ambivalent attachment===\nAnxious-ambivalent attachment is also misnamed as \"resistant attachment\".<ref name=\"Ainsworth,1978a\">{{cite book |title=Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation |vauthors=Ainsworth MD, Blehar M, Waters E, Wall S |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=1978 |isbn=978-0-89859-461-4 |location=Hillsdale NJ}}</ref> In general, a child with an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present.

The infant will not explore very much regardless of who is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or turn away from the caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorized that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants was in fact a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ainsworth MD, Bell SM | title = Attachment, exploration, and separation: illustrated by the behavior of one-year-olds in a strange situation | journal = Child Development | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 49\u201367 | date = March 1970 | pmid = 5490680 | doi = 10.2307/1127388 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8272bd76f36d195023f245735e23e6b5c8b19afd | jstor = 1127388 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sroufe A, Waters E |year=1977 |title=Attachment as an Organizational Construct |journal=Child Development |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=1184\u20131199 |citeseerx=10.1.1.598.3872 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1977.tb03922.x}}</ref>\n\nInfants are depicted as anxious-avoidant when there is:<blockquote>...&nbsp;conspicuous avoidance of the mother in the reunion episodes which is likely to consist of ignoring her altogether, although there may be some pointed looking away, turning away, or moving away&nbsp;...

The infant's needs were frequently not met and the infant had come to believe that communication of emotional needs had no influence on the caregiver.\n\nAinsworth's student [[Mary Main]] theorized that avoidant behaviour in the Strange Situation Procedure should be regarded as \"a conditional strategy, which paradoxically permits whatever proximity is possible under conditions of maternal rejection\" by de-emphasising attachment needs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Main M |year=1979 |title=The \"ultimate\" causation of some infant attachment phenomena |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=640\u2013643 |doi=10.1017/s0140525x00064992}}</ref>\n\nMain proposed that avoidance has two functions for an infant whose caregiver is consistently unresponsive to their needs. Firstly, avoidant behaviour allows the infant to maintain a conditional proximity with the caregiver: close enough to maintain protection, but distant enough to avoid rebuff. Secondly, the cognitive processes organising avoidant behaviour could help direct attention away from the unfulfilled desire for closeness with the caregiver\u2014avoiding a situation in which the child is overwhelmed with emotion (\"disorganized distress\"), and therefore unable to maintain control of themselves and achieve even conditional proximity.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Main M | date = 1977 | chapter = Analysis of a peculiar form of reunion behaviour seen in some day-care children. | veditors = Webb R | title = Social Development in Childhood | pages = 33\u201378 | location = Baltimore | publisher = Johns Hopkins }}</ref>\n\n==={{Anchor|disorganized attachment}}Disorganized/disoriented attachment===\nAinsworth herself was the first to find difficulties in fitting all infant behaviour into the three classifications used in her Baltimore study.

Crittenden, for example, noted that one abused infant in her doctoral sample was classed as secure (B) by her undergraduate coders because her strange situation behavior was \"without either avoidance or ambivalence, she did show stress-related stereotypic headcocking throughout the strange situation. This pervasive behavior, however, was the only clue to the extent of her stress\".<ref>{{cite thesis | vauthors = Crittenden PM | title = Mother and Infant Patterns of Attachment | degree = Ph.D. | publisher = University of Virginia | date = May 1983 | page = 73 }}</ref> \n\nBeginning in 1983, Crittenden offered A/C and other new organized classifications (see below).

If the behaviour of the infant does not appear to the observer to be coordinated in a smooth way across episodes to achieve either proximity or some relative proximity with the caregiver, then it is considered 'disorganized' as it indicates a disruption or flooding of the attachment system (e.g. by fear). Infant behaviours in the Strange Situation Protocol coded as disorganized/disoriented include overt displays of fear; contradictory behaviours or affects occurring simultaneously or sequentially; stereotypic, asymmetric, misdirected or jerky movements; or freezing and apparent dissociation. Lyons-Ruth has urged, however, that it should be more widely \"recognized that 52% of disorganized infants continue to approach the caregiver, seek comfort, and cease their distress without clear ambivalent or avoidant behavior\".<ref>Karlen Lyons-Ruth, Jean-Francois Bureau, M.

Perhaps responding to such concerns, George and Solomon have divided among indices of disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) in the Strange Situation, treating some of the behaviours as a 'strategy of desperation' and others as evidence that the attachment system has been flooded (e.g. by fear, or anger).<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Solomon J, George C | date = 1999 | chapter = The place of disorganization in attachment theory. | veditors = Solomon J, George C | title = Attachment Disorganization | pages = 27 | location = NY | publisher = Guilford }}</ref> \n\nCrittenden also argues that some behaviour classified as Disorganized/disoriented can be regarded as more 'emergency' versions of the avoidant and/or ambivalent/resistant strategies, and function to maintain the protective availability of the caregiver to some degree.

A Japanese study in 1986 (Takahashi) studied 60 Japanese mother-infant pairs and compared them with Ainsworth's distributional pattern. Although the ranges for securely attached and insecurely attached had no significant differences in proportions, the Japanese insecure group consisted of only resistant children, with no children categorized as avoidant.  This may be because the Japanese child rearing philosophy stressed close mother infant bonds more so than in Western cultures.  In Northern Germany, Grossmann et al. (Grossmann, Huber, & Wartner, 1981; Grossmann, Spangler, Suess, & Unzner, 1985) replicated the Ainsworth Strange Situation with 46 mother infant pairs and found a different distribution of attachment classifications with a high number of avoidant infants: 52% avoidant, 34% secure, and 13% resistant (Grossmann et al., 1985).  Another study in Israel found there was a high frequency of an ambivalent pattern, which according to Grossman et al. (1985) could be attributed to a greater parental push toward children's independence.\n\n=== Later patterns and the dynamic-maturational model ===\nTechniques have been developed to allow verbal ascertainment of the child's state of mind with respect to attachment. An example is the \"stem story\", in which a child is given the beginning of a story that raises attachment issues and asked to complete it. For older children, adolescents and adults, semi-structured interviews are used in which the manner of relaying content may be as significant as the content itself.<ref name=\"Schaffer\">{{cite book |title=Introducing Child Psychology | vauthors = Schaffer R |publisher=Blackwell |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-631-21628-5 |location=Oxford |pages=83\u2013121}}</ref> However, there are no substantially validated measures of attachment for middle childhood or early adolescence (approximately 7 to 13 years of age).<ref name=\"AACAP-2005\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Boris NW, Zeanah CH | title = Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with reactive attachment disorder of infancy and early childhood | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 44 | issue = 11 | pages = 1206\u201319 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16239871 | doi = 10.1097/01.chi.0000177056.41655.ce | url = http://www.aacap.org/galleries/PracticeParameters/rad.pdf | url-status = dead | access-date = September 13, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090824051123/http://www.aacap.org/galleries/PracticeParameters/rad.pdf | others = Work Group on Quality Issues | archive-date = August 24, 2009 }}</ref>\nSome studies of older children have identified further attachment classifications. Main and Cassidy observed that disorganized behavior in infancy can develop into a child using caregiving-controlling or punitive behaviour in order to manage a helpless or dangerously unpredictable caregiver.

Causal or other sequentially ordered knowledge about the potential for safety or danger. In childhood this would include knowledge regarding the behaviours that indicate an attachment figure's availability as a secure haven. If knowledge regarding the behaviours that indicate an attachment figure's availability as a secure haven is subject to segregation, then the infant can try to keep the attention of their caregiver through clingy or aggressive behaviour, or alternating combinations of the two. Such behaviour may increase the availability of an attachment figure who otherwise displays inconsistent or misleading responses to the infant's attachment behaviours, suggesting the unreliability of protection and safety.<ref name=\"landa2013\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Landa S, Duschinsky R |title=Crittenden's dynamic\u2013maturational model of attachment and adaptation |url= https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4301a7340c94fcdfdaba930baf9488269eb88a07 |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=326\u2013338 |year=2013 |doi=10.1037/a0032102 }}</ref>\n\nCrittenden proposes that both kinds of information can be split off from consciousness or behavioural expression as a 'strategy' to maintain the availability of an attachment figure (See section above on Disorganized/disoriented attachment for distinction of \"Types\"): \"Type A strategies were hypothesized to be based on reducing perception of threat to reduce the disposition to respond.

Experiencing more reliable and predictable information about the availability of their attachment figure, the toddler then no longer needs to use coercive behaviours with the goal of maintaining their caregiver's availability and can develop a secure attachment to their caregiver since they trust that their needs and communications will be heeded.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Significance of patterns===\nResearch based on data from longitudinal studies, such as the [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care]] and the Minnesota Study of Risk and Adaption from Birth to Adulthood, and from cross-sectional studies, consistently shows associations between early attachment classifications and peer relationships as to both quantity and quality.

Insecure attachment and early psychosocial stress indicate the presence of environmental risk (for example poverty, mental illness, instability, minority status, violence). Environmental risk can cause insecure attachment, while also favouring the development of strategies for earlier reproduction. Different reproductive strategies have different adaptive values for males and females: Insecure males tend to adopt avoidant strategies, whereas insecure females tend to adopt anxious/ambivalent strategies, unless they are in a very high risk environment.

This internal working model is related to the individual's state of mind which develops with respect to attachment generally and explores how attachment functions in relationship dynamics based on childhood and adolescent experience. The organization of an internal working model is generally seen as leading to more stable attachments in those who develop such a model, rather than those who rely more on the individual's state of mind alone in forming new attachments.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nAge, cognitive growth, and continued social experience advance the development and complexity of the internal working model. Attachment-related behaviours lose some characteristics typical of the infant-toddler period and take on age-related tendencies. The preschool period involves the use of negotiation and bargaining.<ref name=\"Waters\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Waters E, Kondo-Ikemura K, Posada G, Richters J |year=1991 |title=Learning to love: Mechanisms and milestones |journal=Minnesota Symposia on Child Psychology |location=Hillsdale, NJ |publisher=Erlbaum |volume=23 |issue=Self\u2013Processes and Development |veditors=Gunnar M, Sroufe T}}</ref> For example, four-year-olds are not distressed by separation if they and their caregiver have already negotiated a shared plan for the separation and reunion.<ref name=\"marbrit\">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title=Normative Development: The Ontogeny of Attachment |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York and London |pages=269\u201394 |isbn=978-1-59385-874-2 |vauthors=Marvin RS, Britner PA |veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR}}</ref>\n\nIdeally, these social skills become incorporated into the internal working model to be used with other children and later with adult peers. As children move into the school years at about six years old, most develop a goal-corrected partnership with parents, in which each partner is willing to compromise in order to maintain a gratifying relationship.<ref name=\"Waters\" /> By middle childhood, the goal of the attachment behavioural system has changed from proximity to the attachment figure to availability. Generally, a child is content with longer separations, provided contact\u2014or the possibility of physically reuniting, if needed\u2014is available. Attachment behaviours such as clinging and following decline and self-reliance increases. By middle childhood (ages 7\u201311), there may be a shift toward mutual [[coregulation]] of secure-base contact in which caregiver and child negotiate methods of maintaining communication and supervision as the child moves toward a greater degree of independence.<ref name=\"Waters\" />\n\nThe attachment system used by adolescents is seen as a \"safety regulating system\" whose main function is to promote physical and psychological safety. There are 2 different events that can trigger the attachment system. Those triggers include, the presence of a potential danger or stress, internal and external, and a threat of accessibility and/or availability of an attachment figure. The ultimate goal of the attachment system is security, so during a time of danger or inaccessibility the behavioral system accepts felt security in the context of the availability of protection. By adolescence we are able to find security through a variety of things, such as food, exercise, and social media.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Kerns | first1 = Kathryn A. | first2 = Rhonda A. | last2 = Richardson | name-list-format = vanc | title = Attachment in Middle Childhood. | publisher = Guilford Press | date = 2005 }}</ref> Felt security can be achieved through a number of ways, and often without the physical presence of the attachment figure. Higher levels of maturity allows adolescent teens to more capably interact with their environment on their own because the environment is perceived as less threatening. Adolescents teens will also see an increase in cognitive, emotional and behavioral maturity that dictates whether or not teens are less likely to experience conditions that activate their need for an attachment figure. For example, when teenagers get sick and stay home from school, surely they want their parents to be home so they can take care of them, but they are also able to stay home by themselves without experiencing serious amounts of distress.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = McElhaney KB, Allen JP, Stephenson JC, Hare AL | chapter = Attachment and Autonomy During Adolescence | veditors = Lerner RM, Steinberg L | title = Part II: Domains of Individual Development in Adolescence | series = Handbook of Adolescent Psychology | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | date = 30 October 2009 | doi = 10.1002/9780470479193.adlpsy001012 | isbn = 978-0-470-47919-3 }}</ref>\n\nHere are the attachment style differences during adolescence:<ref name=\":8\">{{cite journal |last=Freeman |first=Harry |last2=Brown |first2=B.

These roughly correspond to infant classifications: secure, insecure-ambivalent, insecure-avoidant and disorganized/disoriented.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n'''Securely attached''' adults have been \u201clinked to a high need for achievement and a low fear of failure (Elliot & Reis, 2003)\u201d. They will positively approach a task with the goal of mastering it and have an appetite for exploration in achievement settings (Elliot & Reis, 2003). Research shows that securely attached adults have a \u201clow level of personal distress and high levels of concern for others\u201d.<ref name=\"ams\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ahmad S, Mohammad H, Shafique Z |date=2018 |title=The impact of attachment styles on helping behavior in adults |journal=Journal of Social Sciences and Humanity Studies |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=24\u201329}}</ref> Due to their high rates of self-efficacy, securely attached adults typically do not hesitate to remove a person having a negative impact from problematic situations they are facing.<ref name=\"ams\"/> This calm response is representative of the securely attached adult's emotionally regulated response to threats that many studies have supported in the face of diverse situations. Adult secure attachment comes from an individual's early connection with their caregiver(s), genes and their romantic experiences.<ref name=\"levine\">{{cite book| vauthors = Levine A, Heller R |year=2011 |title=Attached: The new science of adult attachment and how it can help you find and keep love |location=New York, NY |publisher= Penguin Group}}</ref>\n\nWithin romantic relationships, a securely attached adult will appear in the following ways: excellent conflict resolution, mentally flexible, effective communicators, avoidance of manipulation, comfortable with closeness without fearfulness of being enmeshed, quickly forgiving, viewing sex and emotional intimacy as one, believing they can positively impact their relationship, and caring for their partner how they want to be cared for. In summation, they are great partners who treat their spouses very well, as they are not afraid to give positively and ask for their needs to be met. Securely attached adults believe that there are \u201cmany potential partners that would be responsive to their needs\u201d, and if they come across an individual who is not meeting their needs, they will typically lose interest very quickly. In a study comparing secure-secure and secure-various attachment style relationships, there was no fluctuation in positive relational functioning. However, in any combination of two partners with attachment styles outside of secure, the relationships showed high levels of negative relationship functioning. This research indicates that it only takes one securely attached partner within a romantic relationship to maintain healthy, emotional relationship functioning.<ref name=\"levine\"/>\n\n'''Anxious-preoccupied''' adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent. They tend to be less trusting, have less positive views about themselves and their partners, and may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, worry and impulsiveness in their relationships. The anxiety that adults feel prevents the establishment of satisfactory defense exclusion. Thus, it is possible that individuals that have been anxiously attached to their attachment figure or figures have not been able to develop sufficient defenses against separation anxiety. Because of their lack of preparation these individuals will then overreact to the anticipation of separation or the actual separation from their attachment figure. The anxiety comes from an individual's intense and/or unstable relationship that leave the anxious or preoccupied individual relatively defenseless.<ref name=\"Sperling, Michael B. 1994\">{{cite book | last1 = Sperling | first1 = Michael B. | first2 = William H. | last2 = Berman | name-list-format = vanc | title = Attachment in Adults: Clinical and Developmental Perspectives | publisher = Guilford Press | date = 1994 }}</ref> Adults with this attachment style tend to look way too far into things, whether that's a text message or a face-to-face conversation.

They view themselves as self-sufficient, invulnerable to attachment feelings and not needing close relationships. They tend to suppress their feelings, dealing with conflict by distancing themselves from partners of whom they often have a poor opinion. Adults lack the interest of forming close relationships and maintaining emotional closeness with the people around them. They have a great amount of distrust in others but at the same time possess a positive model of self, they would prefer to invest in their own ego skills. Because of their distrust they cannot be convinced that other people have the ability to deliver emotional support. They try to create high levels of self-esteem by investing disproportionately in their abilities or accomplishments. These adults maintain their positive views of self, based on their personal achievements and competence rather than searching for and feeling acceptance from others. These adults will explicitly reject or minimize the importance of emotional attachment and passively avoid relationships when they feel as though they are becoming too close. They strive for self-reliance and independence. When it comes to the opinions of others about themselves, they are very indifferent and are relatively hesitant to positive feedback from their peers. Dismissive avoidance can also be explained as the result of defensive deactivation of the attachment system to avoid potential rejection, or genuine disregard for interpersonal closeness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Carvallo | first1 = Mauricio | last2 = Gabriel | first2 = Shira | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2006 | title = No Man Is an Island: The Need to Belong and Dismissing Avoidant Attachment Style | url = | journal = PsycEXTRA Dataset | volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1037/e511092014-160 }}</ref>\n\n'''Fearful-avoidant''' adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, both desiring and feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness.

In contrast, insecure individuals would create attachment situations with more complications.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> For example, If the caregiver is accepting of these proximity-seeking behaviors and grants access, the infant develops a secure organization; if the caregiver consistently denies the infant access, an avoidant organization develops; and if the caregiver inconsistently grants access, an ambivalent organization develops.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Main M, Kaplan N, Cassidy J |year=1985 |title=Security in Infancy, Childhood, and Adulthood: A Move to the Level of Representation |journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development |volume=50 |issue=1/2 |pages=66\u2013104 |doi=10.2307/3333827 |jstor=3333827}}</ref> In retrospect, internal working models are constant with and reflect the primary relationship with our caregivers.

The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies.

It has been used in an attempt to identify causal mechanisms in criminal behaviour \u2013 with uses ranging from [[offender profiling]], better understanding types of offence and the pursuit of preventative policy. It has been found that disturbances early on in child-caregiver relationships are a risk factor in criminality. Attachment theory in this context has been described as \"perhaps the most influential of contemporary psychoanalytically oriented theories of crime\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Psychology and Crime: An Introduction to Criminological Psychology |last=Hollin |first=Clive R. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |location=USA & Canada |pages=62}}</ref>\n\n=== History ===\nIn the 1870s, [[Cesare Lombroso]]'s \"born criminal\" theory, which posited that criminality was innate and inherited, had dominated thinking in criminology.

In applying psychoanalysis to [[pedagogy]] he argued that abnormal child development, stemming from relationship difficulties, underlies many instances of delinquency. He believed that within insecure child-parent relationships, socialisation may go awry, causing an arrest in the child's development allowing latent delinquency to become dominant.<ref>{{cite book |title=Wayward Youth |last=Aichhorn |first=August | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=The Viking Press |year=1935 |location=the University of Michigan}}</ref>\n\nThe intersection of crime and attachment theory was further researched by John Bowlby. In his first published work, ''Forty-four Juvenile Thieves'', he studied a sample of 88 children (44 juvenile thieves and 44 non-delinquent controls) to investigate the home life experiences of these two groups. It was identified that child-mother separation was a causative factor in delinquent character formation, particularly in the development of an \"affectionless character\" often seen in the persistent offender. 17 of the juvenile thieves had been separated from their mothers for longer than six months during their first five years, and only 2 children from the control group had such a separation. He also found that 14 of the thieves were \"affectionless characters\" distinguishing them from others by their lack of affection, no emotional ties, no real friendships, and having \"no roots in their relationships\".<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal |last=Bowlby |first=John | name-list-format = vanc |date=Jan 1, 1944 |title=Forty-four Juvenile Thieves: their Characters and Home-Life |journal=International Journal of Psycho-Analysis |volume=25}}</ref> He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>They have a remarkably distinctive early history\u2014prolonged separations from their mothers or foster-mothers\u2014the conclusion forces itself upon one that we have here not only a distinct clinical syndrome, that of the Affectionless thief, but also an unusually clear example of the distorting influence of a bad early environment upon the development of personality.<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>\n\nThese 'affectionless' delinquents were children who, in the first 12 months of life, either had formed a bond with their mother which had subsequently been disrupted, or failed to form a bond at all. 14 of the 17 affectionless delinquents had experienced multiple moves between caregivers. Amongst the control group, there were no affectionless characters. He also noted that delinquents of an 'Affectionless Character' were far more likely to steal in a persistent and serious way than are delinquents of other types.\n\n=== Age distribution of crime ===\nThe relationship between age and crime is one of the most replicated findings in criminology.

Developmental perspectives place importance on the role of childhood experiences, and argue that this can determine criminal patterns later on i.e. individuals who have disrupted childhood attachments, amongst other factors, will have criminal careers that continue long into adulthood.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Moffitt TE, Caspi A | title = Childhood predictors differentiate life-course persistent and adolescence-limited antisocial pathways among males and females | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 355\u201375 | date = 2001 | pmid = 11393651 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579401002097 }}</ref> Life-course perspectives do not entirely deny the importance of childhood experiences, but argue that developmental theory is too deterministic in nature. Instead they argue that because humans have agency, every stage of the life course matters.

Life-course persistent offenders start with disrupted attachment relationships in their childhood, which drives a disordered personality and long term antisocial behaviours and criminal careers. By contrast, adolescence-limited offenders do not have disrupted family bonds and are described as having healthy pre-delinquent development.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Life-course perspectives ===\nThe life-course perspective argues that individuals are not automatically assigned to a category in a dual taxonomy. Instead, there are within-individual changes in criminality, due to human agency.

This perception of low support from partner has been identified as a strong predictor of male violence. &nbsp;Other predictors have been named as perceived deficiency in maternal love in childhood, low self-esteem.<ref name=\":7\" /> It has also been found that individuals with a dismissive attachment style, often seen in an antisocial/narcissistic-narcissistic subtype of offender, tend to be emotionally abusive as well as violent.

However, our current education system is more concerned with sex education rather than healthy relationship tactics and skills needed to parent in a sensitive, responsive manner.  If researchers and educators could work together and develop future-parent curriculum for the high school and university levels, It would benefit society as a whole. With the dynamic nature of social and economic environments,  many families struggle balancing work and family responsibilities.

The name \"service-tree\" for ''[[Sorbus domestica]]'' is derived from that name by [[folk etymology]].\nThe Latin name ''sorbus'' is from a root for \"red, reddish-brown\" ([[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''*sor-/*ser-''); English ''sorb'' is attested from the 1520s in the sense \"fruit of the service tree\", adopted via French ''sorbe'' from Latin ''sorbum'' \"service-berry\".\n''Sorbus domestica'' is also known as \"whitty pear\", the adjective whitty meaning \"[[pinnate]]\". The name \"mountain-ash\" for ''Sorbus domestica'' is due to a superficial similarity of the rowan leaves to those of the [[Fraxinus|ash]], not to be confused with ''[[Fraxinus ornus]]'', a true ash that is also known as \"mountain ash\".<ref>\"The similarities in the physical characteristics of all three types of tree [viz., ''Fraxinus excelsior'', ''Fraxinus ornus'', and ''Sorbus aucuparia''] are pervasive enough that they are confused not only in folk terminology, but also in botanical nomenclature\".

It is from a [[North Germanic]] source, derived from Old Norse ''reynir'' (c.f.

The name \"service-tree\" for ''[[Sorbus domestica]]'' is derived from that name by [[folk etymology]].\nThe Latin name ''sorbus'' is from a root for \"red, reddish-brown\" ([[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''*sor-/*ser-''); English ''sorb'' is attested from the 1520s in the sense \"fruit of the service tree\", adopted via French ''sorbe'' from Latin ''sorbum'' \"service-berry\".\n''Sorbus domestica'' is also known as \"whitty pear\", the adjective whitty meaning \"[[pinnate]]\". The name \"mountain-ash\" for ''Sorbus domestica'' is due to a superficial similarity of the rowan leaves to those of the [[Fraxinus|ash]], not to be confused with ''[[Fraxinus ornus]]'', a true ash that is also known as \"mountain ash\".<ref>\"The similarities in the physical characteristics of all three types of tree [viz., ''Fraxinus excelsior'', ''Fraxinus ornus'', and ''Sorbus aucuparia''] are pervasive enough that they are confused not only in folk terminology, but also in botanical nomenclature\".

Norwegian ''rogn'', Danish ''r\u00f8n'', Swedish ''r\u00f6nn''), ultimately from the [[Common Germanic|Germanic]] verb ''[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/raudaz|*raud]][[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/-in\u014dn\u0105|-inan]]'' \"to redden\", in reference to the berries (as is the Latin name ''sorbus''). \nVarious dialectal variants of ''rowan'' are found in English, including ''ran'', ''roan'', ''rodan'', ''royan'', ''royne'', ''round'', and ''rune''.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe [[Old English]] name of the rowan is ''cwic-be\u00e1m'', which survives in the name quickbeam (also quicken, quicken-tree, and variants). This name by the 19th century was reinterpreted as connected to the word [[witch (word)|witch]], from a dialectal variant ''wick'' for quick and names such as wicken-tree, wich-tree, wicky, and wiggan-tree, giving rise to names such as witch-hazel<ref>\"Witch-hazel\" is much more commonly associated with ''[[Hamamelis]]''.</ref> and witch-tree.<ref>Abram Smythe Palmer, ''Folk-etymology: a Dictionary of Verbal Corruptions Or Words Perverted in Form Or Meaning, by False Derivation Or Mistaken Analogy'' (1882), [https://books.google.com/books?id=fXrlvr_kPXwC&pg=PA443 443f].</ref>\n\nThe [[Old Irish]] name is ''cairtheand'', reflected in Modern Irish ''caorthann''. The \"arboreal\" ''[[Br\u00edatharogam]]'' in the ''[[Book of Ballymote]]'' associates the rowan with the letter ''[[Luis (letter)|luis]]'', with the gloss \"delightful to the eye (''li sula'') is ''luis'', i.e. rowan (''caertheand''), owing to the beauty of its berries\".

Another feature is the dominant [[Glyceria maxima|reed sweet-grass]], which only occurs in the Tywi Valley and coastal flats. The lake is fringed by reeds, sedges and grasses such as reed sweet-grass, [[Carex vesicaria|bladder-sedge]] and [[Sparganium erectum|branched bur-reed]], and [[Nuphar lutea|yellow water lilies]] float on the surface of the water in the summer. Other plants around the margin include [[Persicaria hydropiper|water pepper]], [[Sparganium natans|small bur-reed]], [[Sparganium emersum|European bur-reed]], [[Rorippa islandica|northern marsh yellowcress]] and [[Bidens tripartita|trifid bur-marigold]]. There are also fronds of [[Ophioglossum vulgatum|adders-tongue fern]] on the bank of the lake. Various deciduous trees grow round the lake, and a large island develops at the western end during the winter.<ref name=CCW/>\n\nThe lake contains [[tench]], [[European perch]], [[common roach]], [[northern pike]], [[eel]]s, [[common minnow]]s and [[three-spined stickleback]]s, and may have once been stocked for coarse fishing purposes. Birds breeding here include [[kingfisher]], [[white-throated dipper]], [[mallard]], [[Eurasian coot]], [[common moorhen]] and [[mute swan]], and other birds, including the [[little grebe]] visit in winter.<ref name=CCW/> The moth ''[[Donacaula forficella]]'' was recorded from Bishop's Pond, a first record for inland Carmarthenshire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carmarthenshiremoths.co.uk/2015/06/bishops-pond.html |title=Bishop's Pond |author= |date=26 June 2015 |work= |publisher=Carmarthenshire Moth and Butterfly Group |accessdate=19 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Carmarthen & Dinefwr]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{coords|51.8654|-4.2601|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Carmarthen & Dinefwr]]\n", "name_user": "Yoninah", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishops_Pond"}

Lemelle, 137-50. London</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Fanta heimspiel 09 02.jpg|thumb|Die Fantastischen Vier at their \"Heimspiel\" (\"Home Match\") gig in 2009.]]\n[[Image:Die Fantastischen 4.jpg|thumb|Thomas D, Smudo and And.Ypsilon at the [[Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung|IAA]] interviewed by [[Janin Reinhardt]].]]\n\nIn the middle of the 1980s, Rieke and Schmidt formed the ''Terminal Team'', D\u00fcrr and Beck joined in 1989. Under the new name ''Die Fantastischen Vier'' (literally: \"The Fantastic Four\"), they made German hip hop, or ''Deutschen [[Sprechgesang]]'' ''(German spoken-song)'' as they called it, popular in Germany. Although there were German hip-hop artists prior to them (such as [[Advanced Chemistry]] from [[Heidelberg]]) it was Die Fantastischen Vier who registered the first chart hit with their 1992 single \"Die da?!\" from the album ''[[4 Gewinnt]]'', hitting #2 in [[Germany]] and #1 in [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]].\n\nAfter traveling to [[Los Angeles]] in the late 1980s, the group realized the lack of connection between the struggles of \"the poor Blacks in the United States and middle-class Whites in Germany,\"<ref name=autogenerated1 /> and made a conscious effort to move away from the typical and clich\u00e9 American gangster rap. The group never got involved with [[United States|US-American]] [[gangsta rap]] clich\u00e9s, reacting with tongue-in-cheek humor to verbal attacks of alleged German gangsta rappers. In the albums following ''4 Gewinnt'', the band matured and progressed to a more serious and philosophic style.\n\nThe band was extremely successful in the 1990s, when they released their hit single Die Da?! (Her?! The One Over There?!) in 1992. It was arguably the first German hip hop hit and also the breakthrough for Fanta 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxytunes.com/artist/die_fantastischen_vier|title=Yahoo|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the group's works, Thomas D, Hausmarke and Ypsilon also produced successful [[solo album]]s and the four had their own weekly show ''Die 4. Dimension'', named after their [[Die 4. Dimension|third album]], which aired on the German [[Pay television|pay TV]] channel [[Premiere (pay television network)|Premiere]] in 1993/1994.\n\nAt the 1996 [[Popkomm]] in [[Cologne]], Die Fantastischen Vier announced the establishment of their label, [[Four Music]]. Headquarters were in [[Stuttgart]], but were later moved to [[Kreuzberg|Berlin-Kreuzberg]].\n\nThree years later, the group's 7th album ''[[4:99]]'' was released on their own label, with 4 singles from the album following. After the #2 hit \"MfG\", three singles were released at the same time, a first in German music business. Each one can be associated with one of the rappers: \"Le Smou\" (''The Smou''; Smudo), \"Michi Beck in Hell\" (Michi Beck) and \"Buenos Dias Messias\" (''Good day, [[Messiah]]''; Thomas D).\n\nIn late September 2004, Die Fantastischen Vier released the album ''[[Viel]]'', the following tour being their most successful and best-attended to date.\n\nIn 2005, Fanta 4's first [[greatest hits]] album was published. It includes all singles, as well as several other songs and rare footage from the band's early days, when they were still called \"Terminal Team\" and rapped in English.\n[[File:Michael beck 1.jpg|thumb|Michael Beck (2010)]]\nOn 7 April 2007, the number-one album ''[[Fornika]]'' was released, preceded by the single \"Ernten was wir s\u00e4en\" ''(Reap what we sow)''.\n\nTheir song \"Ernten was wir s\u00e4en\" was released as a download for ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'' in December 2007 and was recently covered by [[Oomph!]].\n\nThey are also the German voices of the Penguins (Michael Beck as Skipper, Thomas D. as Kowalski, Andreas Rieke as Rico and Michael Bernd Schmidt as Private) in the ''Madagascar'' film series.\n\nIn 2010, ''[[F\u00fcr Dich Immer Noch Fanta Sie]]'' peaked again at number one of the German charts.\n\nThe 2014 release of the album ''[[Rekord (album)|Rekord]]'' marked the 25th anniversary of the band. It also topped the charts in Germany.\n\nIn 2018, the single \"[[Zusammen (song)|Zusammen]]\", featuring [[Clueso]], from the album ''[[Captain Fantastic (album)|Captain Fantastic]]'' was chosen as the official song for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] by German public broadcaster [[Das Erste]].\n\n== Discography ==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Title\n! colspan=\"3\"| Chart positions\n|-\n!

London</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Fanta heimspiel 09 02.jpg|thumb|Die Fantastischen Vier at their \"Heimspiel\" (\"Home Match\") gig in 2009.]]\n[[Image:Die Fantastischen 4.jpg|thumb|Thomas D, Smudo and And.Ypsilon at the [[Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung|IAA]] interviewed by [[Janin Reinhardt]].]]\n\nIn the middle of the 1980s, Rieke and Schmidt formed the ''Terminal Team'', D\u00fcrr and Beck joined in 1989. Under the new name ''Die Fantastischen Vier'' (literally: \"The Fantastic Four\"), they made German hip hop, or ''Deutschen [[Sprechgesang]]'' ''(German spoken-song)'' as they called it, popular in Germany. Although there were German hip-hop artists prior to them (such as [[Advanced Chemistry]] from [[Heidelberg]]) it was Die Fantastischen Vier who registered the first chart hit with their 1992 single \"Die da?!\" from the album ''[[4 Gewinnt]]'', hitting #2 in [[Germany]] and #1 in [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]].\n\nAfter traveling to [[Los Angeles]] in the late 1980s, the group realized the lack of connection between the struggles of \"the poor Blacks in the United States and middle-class Whites in Germany,\"<ref name=autogenerated1 /> and made a conscious effort to move away from the typical and clich\u00e9 American gangster rap. The group never got involved with [[United States|US-American]] [[gangsta rap]] clich\u00e9s, reacting with tongue-in-cheek humor to verbal attacks of alleged German gangsta rappers. In the albums following ''4 Gewinnt'', the band matured and progressed to a more serious and philosophic style.\n\nThe band was extremely successful in the 1990s, when they released their hit single Die Da?! (Her?! The One Over There?!) in 1992. It was arguably the first German hip hop hit and also the breakthrough for Fanta 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxytunes.com/artist/die_fantastischen_vier|title=Yahoo|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the group's works, Thomas D, Hausmarke and Ypsilon also produced successful [[solo album]]s and the four had their own weekly show ''Die 4. Dimension'', named after their [[Die 4. Dimension|third album]], which aired on the German [[Pay television|pay TV]] channel [[Premiere (pay television network)|Premiere]] in 1993/1994.\n\nAt the 1996 [[Popkomm]] in [[Cologne]], Die Fantastischen Vier announced the establishment of their label, [[Four Music]]. Headquarters were in [[Stuttgart]], but were later moved to [[Kreuzberg|Berlin-Kreuzberg]].\n\nThree years later, the group's 7th album ''[[4:99]]'' was released on their own label, with 4 singles from the album following. After the #2 hit \"MfG\", three singles were released at the same time, a first in German music business. Each one can be associated with one of the rappers: \"Le Smou\" (''The Smou''; Smudo), \"Michi Beck in Hell\" (Michi Beck) and \"Buenos Dias Messias\" (''Good day, [[Messiah]]''; Thomas D).\n\nIn late September 2004, Die Fantastischen Vier released the album ''[[Viel]]'', the following tour being their most successful and best-attended to date.\n\nIn 2005, Fanta 4's first [[greatest hits]] album was published. It includes all singles, as well as several other songs and rare footage from the band's early days, when they were still called \"Terminal Team\" and rapped in English.\n[[File:Michael beck 1.jpg|thumb|Michael Beck (2010)]]\nOn 7 April 2007, the number-one album ''[[Fornika]]'' was released, preceded by the single \"Ernten was wir s\u00e4en\" ''(Reap what we sow)''.\n\nTheir song \"Ernten was wir s\u00e4en\" was released as a download for ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'' in December 2007 and was recently covered by [[Oomph!]].\n\nThey are also the German voices of the Penguins (Michael Beck as Skipper, Thomas D. as Kowalski, Andreas Rieke as Rico and Michael Bernd Schmidt as Private) in the ''Madagascar'' film series.\n\nIn 2010, ''[[F\u00fcr Dich Immer Noch Fanta Sie]]'' peaked again at number one of the German charts.\n\nThe 2014 release of the album ''[[Rekord (album)|Rekord]]'' marked the 25th anniversary of the band. It also topped the charts in Germany.\n\nIn 2018, the single \"[[Zusammen (song)|Zusammen]]\", featuring [[Clueso]], from the album ''[[Captain Fantastic (album)|Captain Fantastic]]'' was chosen as the official song for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] by German public broadcaster [[Das Erste]].\n\n== Discography ==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Title\n! colspan=\"3\"| Chart positions\n|-\n!

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|5.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District. It was re-branded to its current name upon the opening of Tilikum Crossing bridge in 2015.<ref name=\"PS-Loop\">{{cite web|title=Portland Streetcar Loop Service |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |publisher=[[Portland Streetcar]] |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806004043/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |archivedate=August 6, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|5.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line''').
