It was best known for decades as the location of [[St. Brendan's Hospital (Grangegorman)|St Brendan's Hospital]], which was the main psychiatric hospital serving the greater Dublin region. The area is currently the subject of a major redevelopment plan under the aegis of the [[Grangegorman Development Agency]], including the new [[Technological University Dublin]] campus.\n\nGrangegorman is also a [[civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] in the historical [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] of Dublin City and [[Coolock (barony)|Coolock]].<ref>[http://www.logainm.ie/2977.aspx Placenames Database of Ireland] - Grangegorman civil parish</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Grangegorman, as with other [[placenames]] containing the name \"gorman\" in the [[Leinster]] region, probably indicates that at one time this territory was held by the [[U\u00ed Bairrche]], an [[Irish clans|Irish clan]] based in Leinster.

A major historic feature was the Bradogue River, now culverted but still cutting right through the area on its way to the [[River Liffey]].\n\n===Modern suburb of Grangegorman===\nGrangegorman is located in the [[Dublin 7]] [[Dublin postal districts|postal district]], north of the [[River Liffey]] and about 1&nbsp;km from [[Dublin]] city centre, and its boundaries run, approximately, along Brunswick Street North, Prussia Street and Manor Street, the [[R101 road (Ireland)|North Circular Road]] and Phibsborough Road and Constitution Hill. Grangegorman is surrounded to the south east by [[Smithfield, Dublin|Smithfield]] to the west by [[Stoneybatter]], north by [[Cabra, Dublin|Cabra]], to the north and east by [[Phibsborough]] / [[Broadstone, Dublin|Broadstone]].\n\nThe geographical definition of the north Dublin [[District Electoral Division|electoral division]] known as Arran Quay B, encompasses Grangegorman. The 2006 [[Census#Ireland|Census]] gives the population of Arran Quay B as 3,692.

As shown, the original quadrangular building of the Richmond District Lunatic Asylum (1815) was built beside the new premises of the North Dublin Union. The Richmond Asylum also purchased land and constructed buildings on the western side of Grangegorman Lane. A tunnel running underground across Grangegorman Lane connected the east and west half of the Richmond's facilities. The original section on the eastern half became known as the \"lower house\" which that on the western side became known as the \"upper house\" or \"male house\". Not shown are the Hardwicke Fever Hospital (1803) or the Whitworth Chronic Hospital (1814) and its Dispensary (1820). These medical buildings were situated on Brunswick Street North or off Morning Star Avenue. This avenue is shown on the map although it is not named. It is the avenue leading northward from Brunswick Street North towards the North Dublin Union. The House of Industry (1773) became the North Dublin Union following the passage of the Irish Poor Law (1838).</ref>]]\n\nIn the fourteenth-century Dublin was a small walled city with perhaps 10,000 inhabitants. At this time Grangegorman functioned as one of three home farms, the others being [[Glasnevin]] and Clonken or Clonkene (now known as [[Deansgrange]]), which served to meet the expenditure of the [[Prior]] of the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[Priory]] at The Church of the Holy Trinity. The [[Canon (priest)|Canons]] of this priory served The Church of the Holy Trinity, which was the State Church until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the sixteenth-century when it was re-established as [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mac Giolla Phadraig|first=Brian|year=1938|title=14th century life in a Dublin Monastery|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=1|issue=3|pages=69, 72}}</ref> The farm buildings at Grangegorman consisted of one large hall with some rooms attached and an enclosed farmyard around which there stood a barn, a malthouse, a workshop and a haggard (a farm enclosure for stacking grain or hay, etc.).

The lease of Grangegorman dated 1485 refers to its lands as \"the Orchard\". With the dissolution of the monasteries, [[King Henry VIII]] on 10 May 1541 by [[letters patent]] authorised the transformation of the Prior and Canons of Christ Church to a [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] and [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]]. The lease granted that same year refers to \"the Great Orchard\" and in 1542 to \"an orchard belonging to the Dean situate beyond the town of Oxmantown Green\". In 1560 the lease simply referred to '''\"the Dean's Orchard\"'''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=King Moylan|first=Thomas|year=1945|title=The district of Grangegorman (Part III)|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=7|issue=3|page=103}}</ref>\n\nThe possession of the Manor of Grangegorman passed into the hands of Rt. Hon. Francis Agard after the formation of Dean and Chapter for the management of Christ Church Cathedral. Following Agard's death in 1577, this possession passed to the control of his son-in-law, [[Henry Harington (d. 1613)|Sir Henry Harrington]]. In the period after the [[Restoration (Ireland)|Restoration]], the residential expanse of Grangegorman consisted of forty houses. The Manor House at this time was held by Sir [[John Stanley (died 1674)|Thomas Stanley]]. It is assumed that the domicile to which the now defunct Stanley Street once led was the manorial house.<ref>{{cite book |author=Old Dublin Society |year=1945 |title=Dublin Historical Record |volume=7\u20139 |publisher=The Old Dublin Society|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JoUMAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Sir%2BThomas%2BStanley,+one%22&dq=%22Sir%2BThomas%2BStanley,+one%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IdecUvuEHYWS7Aal-IFI&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg 67]}}</ref> This site is currently occupied by the Stanhope Street Convent of the [[Religious Sisters of Charity|Irish Sisters of Charity]].

In 1704 Dublin's first [[House of Industry]] was established on St. James's Street south of the River Liffey, on the site currently occupied by [[St. James's Hospital]]. However, from 1729 this institution was converted into the rather notorious [[Foundling hospital#Ireland|Dublin Foundling Hospital]]. In 1771\u201372 a philanthropic body called \"The Corporation for the Relief of the Poor\" was instituted following the passage of permissive legislation and this entity was responsible for the opening in 1773 of Dublin's second House of Industry<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tutty|first=M.J.|year=1961|title=Dublin's oldest charity|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=16|issue=3|page=73}}</ref> which was situated at the site of the derelict malthouse on Channel Row on what is now North Brunswick Street.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Joseph|year=1992|title=Grangegorman: Psychiatric Care in Dublin since 1815|location=Dublin|page=5}}</ref> Channel Row at this time was considered to form part of the locality of Glassmanogue to which also belonged the area known as Broadstone. The establishment of this institution was to be the single most important factor in shaping the urban character of Grangegorman as a site increasingly predominated by the presence of a range of institutions meeting nineteenth-century expectations of philanthropy, care and social control.<ref>The minutes of the Corporation's first meeting on Monday 3 August 1772 describes its purpose as a body in the following terms: 'The Corporation instituted for the relief of the Poor and for punishing Vagabonds and Sturdy Beggars in the County of the City of Dublin'. Quoted in, {{cite journal|last=Moylan|first=Thomas King|year=1938|title=Vagabonds and Sturdy Beggars|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=1|issue=2|page=45}}</ref>\n\nThe decision to site the House of Industry in this part of the city no doubt reflected the fact that the local population in Grangegorman and the surrounding districts of the north west of Dublin were and are overwhelming proletarian in nature. Indeed, this reflects a long-standing east-west divide in the city, which continues into the present day. In the parishes of St. Paul's and St. Michan's, resting either side of Smithfield in the north west, between 76 per cent and 79 per cent of the population were considered working class in 1797. Conversely, in the parishes of St. Thomas and St. George in the north east of the city the percentage of the population which was working class was 45 per cent and 31 per cent respectively.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=Tommy|year=1944|title=Whitelaw's 1798 Census of Dublin|journal=History Ireland|volume=2|issue=3|page=14}}</ref> A degree of elite distaste toward the behaviour of working class populations is revealed in the visitation report of an episcopalian archbishop to the region of Grangegorman-Glassmanogue in 1727 when he described the local population, who lacked a church at this point, as lewd and unruly.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Canon E.J.|year=1940|title=St. Michan's Parish in the eighteenth century|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=3|issue=1|page=3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1787 the Governors of the House of Industry considered the need for new accommodation to provide facilities for some two thousand inmates. The old malt house was in a ruinous condition and by the 1790s was deemed in danger of collapse. In September 1791 work began on the New House of Industry at a plot adjoining and to the north of the original building. The site of this building, now demolished, was located at the end of Morning Star Avenue. In 1798 the Governors of the House of Industry petitioned the [[Irish House of Commons]] to build a proper infirmary. Work on this, the Hardwicke Fever Hospital, began in 1803. To cope with the increasing number of children in the workhouse, the Bedford Asylum for Industrious Children, named after the then Lord Lieutenant and the [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]] and designed by the noted architect, [[Francis Johnston (architect)|Francis Johnston]] to accommodate one thousand children, was constructed in 1806 on a site on North Brunswick Street. To care for the 'ruptured poor', the [[Richmond Surgical Hospital]] was opened in 1810. The building used for this hospital had been a convent constructed in 1688 by the [[Benedictine Nuns]] in Channel Row, opposite Red Cow Lane. Subsequently, it passed into the possession of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican Nuns]] who largely rebuilt the structure. The hospital was subsequently rebuilt in 1900 in distinctive red-brick. This building still stands and from 1996 to 2013 functioned as the Dublin Metropolitan Court before being purchased by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, which after extensive renovations reopened the building on 20th April 2018 (117 years to the day since the building was originally opened) as an education and events centre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.therichmond.ie/history|title=History|website=The Richmond Education and Event Centre|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> In 1814 the [[Whitworth Hospital]] for chronic patients was built on a site just to the south of the new House of Industry.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moylan|first=Thomas King|year=1938|title=Vagabonds and sturdy beggars|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=1|issue=2|pages=66\u20139}}</ref> On 24 April 1820, the Talbot dispensary was opened and attached to the Richmond Surgical Hospital to afford relief to those among the sick poor who were not considered suitable for hospital accommodation and were resident in the north west district of Dublin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thom|first=Alexander|authorlink=Alexander Thom (almanac editor)|year=1852|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=518NAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA715|title=Thom's Directory of Ireland|location=Dublin|page=715}}</ref>\n\n===Richmond General Penitentiary===\n[[File:Richmond Penitentiary Architectural Drawing Francis Johnson 1811.jpg|thumb|right|Architectural drawing of the Richmond General Penitentiary by Francis Johnston (1811)]]\n{{Main|Richmond General Penitentiary}}\n\nIn 1810, the Governors of the House Industry were instructed by the Lord Lieutenant to purchase land for the construction of a penitentiary.

Therefore, the governors of the House of Industry petitioned the British parliament for funds to construct additional buildings to meet this demand. The government agreed to fund the construction of an asylum and at the cost of \u00a32,000 lands adjoining and to the east of the site of the House of Industry were purchased and an architect, Francis Johnston, was appointed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Joseph|title=Grangegorman: Psychiatric Care in Dublin since 1815|location=Dublin|year=1992|pages=20\u20131}} {{cite book|last=O'Shea|first=Brian |last2=Falvey |first2=Jane|chapter=A history of the Richmond Asylum (St. Brendan's Hospital), Dublin|editor=Hugh Freeman |editor2=German E.

Thereafter it was renamed the Richmond District Lunatic Asylum and its catchment area was defined as the city and county of Dublin, the counties of [[County Wicklow|Wicklow]], [[County Louth|Louth]], [[County Meath|Meath]], and the town of [[Drogheda]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Joseph|title=Grangegorman: Psychiatric Care in Dublin since 1815|location=Dublin|year=1992|pages=24, 46}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[St. Brendan's Hospital (Grangegorman)]]\n* [[Richmond General Penitentiary]]\n* [[Grangegorman Development Agency]]\n* [[Grangegorman killings]]\n* [[Grangegorman Military Cemetery]] which is located beside the [[Phoenix Park]]\n* [[List of subdivisions of County Dublin]]\n* [[Charles Monck, 1st Viscount Monck]] whose ancestors were from Grangegorman.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*[http://www.cso.ie/ Central Statistics Office], [http://www.cso.ie/census/census_1971_results/Volume1/A%20C%201%201971%20V1.pdf ''Census of Population of Ireland 1971 Volume I: Population of District Electoral Divisions, Towns and Larger Units of Area''] (Dublin, July 1972).\n*[http://www.cso.ie/ Central Statistics Office], [http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Amended%20census2006_%20Volume%201%20Pop%20Classified%20by%20Area.pdf ''Census 2006 Volume I: Population Defined by Area''] (Dublin, 2007).\n*Cromwell, Thomas, [http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/thomas-cromwell/excursions-through-ireland-comprising-topographical-and-historical-delineations-ala/page-4-excursions-through-ireland-comprising-topographical-and-historical-delineations-ala.shtml ''Excursions through Ireland'']\n*McGregor, John James, [https://archive.org/details/newpictureofdubl00mcgr <!-- quote=grange. --> ''New Picture of Dublin''](Dublin, 1821).\n\n{{Dublin residential areas}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://dublin1798.com/dublin09b.htm Map of Grangegorman region 1798]\n* [http://www.grangegorman.ie/ Grangegorman Community Museum]\n* [http://www.grangegormandevelopmentagency.ie/ Grangegorman Development Agency]\n* [http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2005/a2105.pdf Grangegorman Development Agency Act]\n* [http://www.ditsu.ie/grangegorman Video of planned development of DIT Campus on Grangegorman site] (Flash Video software or a web browser supporting H.264/MPEG-4 AVC is necessary to see the content).\n* [http://www.nwicn.ie/ North West Inner City Network]\n* [http://grangegorman.org/ Grangegorman Community Forum]\n* [http://fiveprime.org/hivemind/Tags/dit,grangegorman Contemporary photographs of St. Brendan's Mental Hospital, Grangegorman from Flickr Hive Mind]\n* [http://www.stbrendansgaa.org/?sec=static/history History of St. Brendan's Hospital, Grangegorman: St. Brendan's G.A.A.

It was best known for decades as the location of [[St. Brendan's Hospital (Grangegorman)|St Brendan's Hospital]], which was the main psychiatric hospital serving the greater Dublin region. The area is currently the subject of a major redevelopment plan under the aegis of the [[Grangegorman Development Agency]], including the new [[Technological University Dublin]] campus.\n\nGrangegorman is also a [[civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] in the historical [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] of Dublin City and [[Coolock (barony)|Coolock]].<ref>[http://www.logainm.ie/2977.aspx Placenames Database of Ireland] - Grangegorman civil parish</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Grangegorman, as with other [[placenames]] containing the name \"gorman\" in the [[Leinster]] region, probably indicates that at one time this territory was held by the [[U\u00ed Bairrche]], an [[Irish clans|Irish clan]] based in Leinster.

A major historic feature was the Bradogue River, now culverted but still cutting right through the area on its way to the [[River Liffey]].\n\n===Modern suburb of Grangegorman===\nGrangegorman is located in the [[Dublin 7]] [[Dublin postal districts|postal district]], north of the [[River Liffey]] and about 1&nbsp;km from [[Dublin]] city centre, and its boundaries run, approximately, along Brunswick Street North, Prussia Street and Manor Street, the [[R101 road (Ireland)|North Circular Road]] and Phibsborough Road and Constitution Hill. Grangegorman is surrounded to the south east by [[Smithfield, Dublin|Smithfield]] to the west by [[Stoneybatter]], north by [[Cabra, Dublin|Cabra]], to the north and east by [[Phibsborough]] / [[Broadstone, Dublin|Broadstone]].\n\nThe geographical definition of the north Dublin [[District Electoral Division|electoral division]] known as Arran Quay B, encompasses Grangegorman. The 2006 [[Census#Ireland|Census]] gives the population of Arran Quay B as 3,692.

As shown, the original quadrangular building of the Richmond District Lunatic Asylum (1815) was built beside the new premises of the North Dublin Union. The Richmond Asylum also purchased land and constructed buildings on the western side of Grangegorman Lane. A tunnel running underground across Grangegorman Lane connected the east and west half of the Richmond's facilities. The original section on the eastern half became known as the \"lower house\" which that on the western side became known as the \"upper house\" or \"male house\". Not shown are the Hardwicke Fever Hospital (1803) or the Whitworth Chronic Hospital (1814) and its Dispensary (1820). These medical buildings were situated on Brunswick Street North or off Morning Star Avenue. This avenue is shown on the map although it is not named. It is the avenue leading northward from Brunswick Street North towards the North Dublin Union. The House of Industry (1773) became the North Dublin Union following the passage of the Irish Poor Law (1838).</ref>]]\n\nIn the fourteenth-century Dublin was a small walled city with perhaps 10,000 inhabitants. At this time Grangegorman functioned as one of three home farms, the others being [[Glasnevin]] and Clonken or Clonkene (now known as [[Deansgrange]]), which served to meet the expenditure of the [[Prior]] of the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[Priory]] at The Church of the Holy Trinity. The [[Canon (priest)|Canons]] of this priory served The Church of the Holy Trinity, which was the State Church until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the sixteenth-century when it was re-established as [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mac Giolla Phadraig|first=Brian|year=1938|title=14th century life in a Dublin Monastery|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=1|issue=3|pages=69, 72}}</ref> The farm buildings at Grangegorman consisted of one large hall with some rooms attached and an enclosed farmyard around which there stood a barn, a malthouse, a workshop and a haggard (a farm enclosure for stacking grain or hay, etc.).

The lease of Grangegorman dated 1485 refers to its lands as \"the Orchard\". With the dissolution of the monasteries, [[King Henry VIII]] on 10 May 1541 by [[letters patent]] authorised the transformation of the Prior and Canons of Christ Church to a [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] and [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]]. The lease granted that same year refers to \"the Great Orchard\" and in 1542 to \"an orchard belonging to the Dean situate beyond the town of Oxmantown Green\". In 1560 the lease simply referred to '''\"the Dean's Orchard\"'''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=King Moylan|first=Thomas|year=1945|title=The district of Grangegorman (Part III)|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=7|issue=3|page=103}}</ref>\n\nThe possession of the Manor of Grangegorman passed into the hands of Rt. Hon. Francis Agard after the formation of Dean and Chapter for the management of Christ Church Cathedral. Following Agard's death in 1577, this possession passed to the control of his son-in-law, [[Henry Harington (d. 1613)|Sir Henry Harrington]]. In the period after the [[Restoration (Ireland)|Restoration]], the residential expanse of Grangegorman consisted of forty houses. The Manor House at this time was held by Sir [[John Stanley (died 1674)|Thomas Stanley]]. It is assumed that the domicile to which the now defunct Stanley Street once led was the manorial house.<ref>{{cite book |author=Old Dublin Society |year=1945 |title=Dublin Historical Record |volume=7\u20139 |publisher=The Old Dublin Society|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JoUMAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Sir%2BThomas%2BStanley,+one%22&dq=%22Sir%2BThomas%2BStanley,+one%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IdecUvuEHYWS7Aal-IFI&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg 67]}}</ref> This site is currently occupied by the Stanhope Street Convent of the [[Religious Sisters of Charity|Irish Sisters of Charity]].

In 1704 Dublin's first [[House of Industry]] was established on St. James's Street south of the River Liffey, on the site currently occupied by [[St. James's Hospital]]. However, from 1729 this institution was converted into the rather notorious [[Foundling hospital#Ireland|Dublin Foundling Hospital]]. In 1771\u201372 a philanthropic body called \"The Corporation for the Relief of the Poor\" was instituted following the passage of permissive legislation and this entity was responsible for the opening in 1773 of Dublin's second House of Industry<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tutty|first=M.J.|year=1961|title=Dublin's oldest charity|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=16|issue=3|page=73}}</ref> which was situated at the site of the derelict malthouse on Channel Row on what is now North Brunswick Street.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Joseph|year=1992|title=Grangegorman: Psychiatric Care in Dublin since 1815|location=Dublin|page=5}}</ref> Channel Row at this time was considered to form part of the locality of Glassmanogue to which also belonged the area known as Broadstone. The establishment of this institution was to be the single most important factor in shaping the urban character of Grangegorman as a site increasingly predominated by the presence of a range of institutions meeting nineteenth-century expectations of philanthropy, care and social control.<ref>The minutes of the Corporation's first meeting on Monday 3 August 1772 describes its purpose as a body in the following terms: 'The Corporation instituted for the relief of the Poor and for punishing Vagabonds and Sturdy Beggars in the County of the City of Dublin'. Quoted in, {{cite journal|last=Moylan|first=Thomas King|year=1938|title=Vagabonds and Sturdy Beggars|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=1|issue=2|page=45}}</ref>\n\nThe decision to site the House of Industry in this part of the city no doubt reflected the fact that the local population in Grangegorman and the surrounding districts of the north west of Dublin were and are overwhelming proletarian in nature. Indeed, this reflects a long-standing east-west divide in the city, which continues into the present day. In the parishes of St. Paul's and St. Michan's, resting either side of Smithfield in the north west, between 76 per cent and 79 per cent of the population were considered working class in 1797. Conversely, in the parishes of St. Thomas and St. George in the north east of the city the percentage of the population which was working class was 45 per cent and 31 per cent respectively.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=Tommy|year=1944|title=Whitelaw's 1798 Census of Dublin|journal=History Ireland|volume=2|issue=3|page=14}}</ref> A degree of elite distaste toward the behaviour of working class populations is revealed in the visitation report of an episcopalian archbishop to the region of Grangegorman-Glassmanogue in 1727 when he described the local population, who lacked a church at this point, as lewd and unruly.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Canon E.J.|year=1940|title=St. Michan's Parish in the eighteenth century|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=3|issue=1|page=3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1787 the Governors of the House of Industry considered the need for new accommodation to provide facilities for some two thousand inmates. The old malt house was in a ruinous condition and by the 1790s was deemed in danger of collapse. In September 1791 work began on the New House of Industry at a plot adjoining and to the north of the original building. The site of this building, now demolished, was located at the end of Morning Star Avenue. In 1798 the Governors of the House of Industry petitioned the [[Irish House of Commons]] to build a proper infirmary. Work on this, the Hardwicke Fever Hospital, began in 1803. To cope with the increasing number of children in the workhouse, the Bedford Asylum for Industrious Children, named after the then Lord Lieutenant and the [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]] and designed by the noted architect, [[Francis Johnston (architect)|Francis Johnston]] to accommodate one thousand children, was constructed in 1806 on a site on North Brunswick Street. To care for the 'ruptured poor', the [[Richmond Surgical Hospital]] was opened in 1810. The building used for this hospital had been a convent constructed in 1688 by the [[Benedictine Nuns]] in Channel Row, opposite Red Cow Lane. Subsequently, it passed into the possession of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican Nuns]] who largely rebuilt the structure. The hospital was subsequently rebuilt in 1900 in distinctive red-brick. This building still stands and from 1996 to 2013 functioned as the Dublin Metropolitan Court before being purchased by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, which after extensive renovations reopened the building on 20th April 2018 (117 years to the day since the building was originally opened) as an education and events centre<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.therichmond.ie/history|title=History|website=The Richmond Education and Event Centre|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>.

Therefore, the governors of the House of Industry petitioned the British parliament for funds to construct additional buildings to meet this demand. The government agreed to fund the construction of an asylum and at the cost of \u00a32,000 lands adjoining and to the east of the site of the House of Industry were purchased and an architect, Francis Johnston, was appointed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Joseph|title=Grangegorman: Psychiatric Care in Dublin since 1815|location=Dublin|year=1992|pages=20\u20131}} {{cite book|last=O'Shea|first=Brian |last2=Falvey |first2=Jane|chapter=A history of the Richmond Asylum (St. Brendan's Hospital), Dublin|editor=Hugh Freeman |editor2=German E.

One frequently studied alternative is the case where the learner can ask membership queries as in the exact query learning model or minimally adequate teacher model introduced by Angluin.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Dana Angluin |title=Learning Regular Sets from Queries and Counter-Examples |journal=[[Information and Control]] |year=1987 |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=87\u2013106 |url=http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/chitti/thesis/references/learningRegSetsFromQueriesAndCounterExamples.pdf |doi=10.1016/0890-5401(87)90052-6 |citeseerx=10.1.1.187.9414 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232143/http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/chitti/thesis/references/learningRegSetsFromQueriesAndCounterExamples.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-02 }}</ref>\n\n==Methodologies==\nThere is a wide variety of methods for grammatical inference.  Two of the classic sources are {{Harvtxt|Fu|1977}} and {{Harvtxt|Fu|1982}}. {{Harvtxt|Duda|Hart|Stork|2001}} also devote a brief section to the problem, and cite a number of references.  The basic trial-and-error method they present is discussed below. For approaches to infer subclasses of [[regular languages]] in particular, see ''[[Induction of regular languages]]''. A more recent textbook is de la Higuera (2010),<ref name = \"Grammatical Inference\"/> which covers the theory of grammatical inference of regular languages and finite state automata. D'Ulizia, Ferri and Grifoni<ref>D\u2019Ulizia, A., Ferri, F., Grifoni, P. (2011) \"[https://www.academia.edu/download/41900378/A_survey_of_grammatical_inference_method20160202-5760-79hwcu.pdf A Survey of Grammatical Inference Methods for Natural Language Learning]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\", ''Artificial Intelligence Review'', Vol. 36, No. 1, pp. 1\u201327.</ref> provide a survey that explores grammatical inference methods for natural languages.\n\n===Grammatical inference by trial-and-error===\nThe method proposed in Section 8.7 of {{Harvtxt|Duda|Hart|Stork|2001}} suggests successively guessing grammar rules (productions) and testing them against positive and negative observations.  The rule set is expanded so as to be able to generate each positive example, but if a given rule set also generates a negative example, it must be discarded.  This particular approach can be characterized as \"hypothesis testing\" and bears some similarity to Mitchel's [[version space]] algorithm. The {{Harvtxt|Duda|Hart|Stork|2001}} text provide a simple example which nicely illustrates the process, but the feasibility of such an unguided trial-and-error approach for more substantial problems is dubious.\n\n=== Grammatical inference by genetic algorithms ===\nGrammatical induction using [[evolutionary algorithm]]s is the process of evolving a representation of the grammar of a target language through some evolutionary process. [[Formal grammar]]s can easily be represented as [[tree (data structure)|tree structures]] of production rules that can be subjected to evolutionary operators. [[Algorithm]]s of this sort stem from the [[genetic programming]] paradigm pioneered by [[John Koza]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Other early work on simple formal languages used the binary string representation of genetic algorithms, but the inherently hierarchical structure of grammars couched in the [[Extended Backus\u2013Naur form|EBNF]] language made trees a more flexible approach.\n\nKoza represented [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] programs as trees. He was able to find analogues to the genetic operators within the standard set of tree operators. For example, swapping sub-trees is equivalent to the corresponding process of genetic crossover, where sub-strings of a genetic code are transplanted into an individual of the next generation. Fitness is measured by scoring the output from the [[grammatical function|functions]] of the Lisp code. Similar analogues between the tree structured lisp representation and the representation of grammars as trees, made the application of genetic programming techniques possible for grammar induction.\n\nIn the case of grammar induction, the transplantation of sub-trees corresponds to the swapping of production rules that enable the parsing of phrases from some language. The fitness operator for the grammar is based upon some measure of how well it performed in parsing some group of sentences from the target language. In a tree representation of a grammar, a [[terminal symbol]] of a production rule corresponds to a leaf node of the tree. Its parent nodes corresponds to a non-terminal symbol (e.g. a [[noun phrase]] or a [[verb phrase]]) in the rule set. Ultimately, the root node might correspond to a sentence non-terminal.\n\n===Grammatical inference by greedy algorithms===\nLike all [[greedy algorithm]]s, greedy grammar inference algorithms make, in iterative manner, decisions that seem to be the best at that stage.\nThe decisions made usually deal with things like the creation of new rules, the removal of existing rules, the choice of a rule to be applied or the merging of some existing rules.\nBecause there are several ways to define 'the stage' and 'the best', there are also several greedy grammar inference algorithms.\n\nThese [[context-free grammar]] generating algorithms make the decision after every read symbol:\n* [[LZW|Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm]] creates a context-free grammar in a deterministic way such that it is necessary to store only the start rule of the generated grammar.\n* [[Sequitur algorithm|Sequitur]] and its modifications.\n\nThese context-free grammar generating algorithms first read the whole given symbol-sequence and then start to make decisions:\n* [[Byte pair encoding]] and its optimizations.\n\n===Distributional learning===\nA more recent approach is based on distributional learning. Algorithms using these approaches have been applied to learning [[context-free grammars]] and [[mildly context-sensitive language]]s and have been proven to be correct and efficient for large subclasses of these grammars.<ref>Clark and Eyraud (2007) ''Journal of Machine Learning Research''; Ryo Yoshinaka (2011) ''Theoretical Computer Science''</ref>\n\n===Learning of [[Pattern language (formal languages)|pattern languages]]===\n\nAngluin defines a ''pattern'' to be \"a string of constant symbols from \u03a3 and '''variable symbols''' from a disjoint set\".\nThe language of such a pattern is the set of all its nonempty ground instances  i.e. all strings resulting from consistent replacement of its variable symbols by nonempty strings of constant symbols.<ref group=note>The language of a pattern with at least two occurrences of the same variable is not regular due to the [[Pumping lemma for regular languages|pumping lemma]].</ref>\nA pattern is called '''descriptive''' for a finite input set of strings if its language is minimal (with respect to set inclusion) among all pattern languages subsuming the input set.\n\nAngluin gives a polynomial algorithm to compute, for a given input string set, all descriptive patterns in one variable ''x''.<ref group=note>''x'' may occur several times, but no other variable ''y'' may occur</ref>\nTo this end, she builds an automaton representing all possibly relevant patterns; using sophisticated arguments about word lengths, which rely on ''x'' being the only variable, the state count can be drastically reduced.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Dana Angluin| title=Finding Patterns Common to a Set of Strings| journal=Journal of Computer and System Sciences| year=1980| volume=21| pages=46\u201362| doi=10.1016/0022-0000(80)90041-0}}</ref>\n\nErlebach et al. give a more efficient version of Angluin's pattern learning algorithm, as well as a parallelized version.<ref>{{cite book|author1=T.

(2011) \"[https://www.academia.edu/download/41900378/A_survey_of_grammatical_inference_method20160202-5760-79hwcu.pdf A Survey of Grammatical Inference Methods for Natural Language Learning]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\", ''Artificial Intelligence Review'', Vol. 36, No. 1, pp. 1\u201327.</ref> provide a survey that explores grammatical inference methods for natural languages.\n\n===Grammatical inference by trial-and-error===\nThe method proposed in Section 8.7 of {{Harvtxt|Duda|Hart|Stork|2001}} suggests successively guessing grammar rules (productions) and testing them against positive and negative observations.  The rule set is expanded so as to be able to generate each positive example, but if a given rule set also generates a negative example, it must be discarded.  This particular approach can be characterized as \"hypothesis testing\" and bears some similarity to Mitchel's [[version space]] algorithm. The {{Harvtxt|Duda|Hart|Stork|2001}} text provide a simple example which nicely illustrates the process, but the feasibility of such an unguided trial-and-error approach for more substantial problems is dubious.\n\n=== Grammatical inference by genetic algorithms ===\nGrammatical induction using [[evolutionary algorithm]]s is the process of evolving a representation of the grammar of a target language through some evolutionary process. [[Formal grammar]]s can easily be represented as [[tree (data structure)|tree structures]] of production rules that can be subjected to evolutionary operators. [[Algorithm]]s of this sort stem from the [[genetic programming]] paradigm pioneered by [[John Koza]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Other early work on simple formal languages used the binary string representation of genetic algorithms, but the inherently hierarchical structure of grammars couched in the [[Extended Backus\u2013Naur form|EBNF]] language made trees a more flexible approach.\n\nKoza represented [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] programs as trees. He was able to find analogues to the genetic operators within the standard set of tree operators. For example, swapping sub-trees is equivalent to the corresponding process of genetic crossover, where sub-strings of a genetic code are transplanted into an individual of the next generation. Fitness is measured by scoring the output from the [[grammatical function|functions]] of the Lisp code. Similar analogues between the tree structured lisp representation and the representation of grammars as trees, made the application of genetic programming techniques possible for grammar induction.\n\nIn the case of grammar induction, the transplantation of sub-trees corresponds to the swapping of production rules that enable the parsing of phrases from some language. The fitness operator for the grammar is based upon some measure of how well it performed in parsing some group of sentences from the target language. In a tree representation of a grammar, a [[terminal symbol]] of a production rule corresponds to a leaf node of the tree. Its parent nodes corresponds to a non-terminal symbol (e.g. a [[noun phrase]] or a [[verb phrase]]) in the rule set. Ultimately, the root node might correspond to a sentence non-terminal.\n\n===Grammatical inference by greedy algorithms===\nLike all [[greedy algorithm]]s, greedy grammar inference algorithms make, in iterative manner, decisions that seem to be the best at that stage.\nThe decisions made usually deal with things like the creation of new rules, the removal of existing rules, the choice of a rule to be applied or the merging of some existing rules.\nBecause there are several ways to define 'the stage' and 'the best', there are also several greedy grammar inference algorithms.\n\nThese [[context-free grammar]] generating algorithms make the decision after every read symbol:\n* [[LZW|Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm]] creates a context-free grammar in a deterministic way such that it is necessary to store only the start rule of the generated grammar.\n* [[Sequitur algorithm|Sequitur]] and its modifications.\n\nThese context-free grammar generating algorithms first read the whole given symbol-sequence and then start to make decisions:\n* [[Byte pair encoding]] and its optimizations.\n\n===Distributional learning===\nA more recent approach is based on distributional learning. Algorithms using these approaches have been applied to learning [[context-free grammars]] and [[mildly context-sensitive language]]s and have been proven to be correct and efficient for large subclasses of these grammars.<ref>Clark and Eyraud (2007) ''Journal of Machine Learning Research''; Ryo Yoshinaka (2011) ''Theoretical Computer Science''</ref>\n\n===Learning of [[Pattern language (formal languages)|pattern languages]]===\n\nAngluin defines a ''pattern'' to be \"a string of constant symbols from \u03a3 and '''variable symbols''' from a disjoint set\".\nThe language of such a pattern is the set of all its nonempty ground instances  i.e. all strings resulting from consistent replacement of its variable symbols by nonempty strings of constant symbols.<ref group=note>The language of a pattern with at least two occurrences of the same variable is not regular due to the [[Pumping lemma for regular languages|pumping lemma]].</ref>\nA pattern is called '''descriptive''' for a finite input set of strings if its language is minimal (with respect to set inclusion) among all pattern languages subsuming the input set.\n\nAngluin gives a polynomial algorithm to compute, for a given input string set, all descriptive patterns in one variable ''x''.<ref group=note>''x'' may occur several times, but no other variable ''y'' may occur</ref>\nTo this end, she builds an automaton representing all possibly relevant patterns; using sophisticated arguments about word lengths, which rely on ''x'' being the only variable, the state count can be drastically reduced.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Dana Angluin| title=Finding Patterns Common to a Set of Strings| journal=Journal of Computer and System Sciences| year=1980| volume=21| pages=46\u201362| doi=10.1016/0022-0000(80)90041-0}}</ref>\n\nErlebach et al. give a more efficient version of Angluin's pattern learning algorithm, as well as a parallelized version.<ref>{{cite book|author1=T.

It differs from other approaches to [[artificial intelligence]] in that it does not begin by prescribing algorithms and machinery to recognize and classify patterns; rather, it prescribes a vocabulary to articulate and recast the pattern concepts in precise language.\n\nIn addition to the new algebraic vocabulary, its statistical approach was novel in its aim to:\n* Identify the [[Latent variable|hidden variables]] of a data set using real world data rather than artificial stimuli, which was commonplace at the time.\n* Formulate prior distributions for hidden variables and models for the observed variables that form the vertices of a Gibbs-like graph.\n* Study the randomness and variability of these graphs.\n* Create the basic classes of stochastic models applied by listing the deformations of the patterns.\n* Synthesize (sample) from the models, not just analyze signals with it.\nBroad in its mathematical coverage, pattern theory spans algebra and statistics, as well as local topological and global entropic properties.\n\n== Applications ==\nThe principle of grammar induction has been applied to other aspects of [[natural language processing]], and has been applied (among many other problems) to [[semantic parsing]],<ref name=\"Kwiatkowski\">Kwiatkowski, Tom, et al. \"[http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~lsz/papers/kzgs-emnlp2011.pdf Lexical generalization in CCG grammar induction for semantic parsing].\" Proceedings of the conference on empirical methods in natural language processing.

The response to risks typically depends on their perceived gravity, and involves controlling, avoiding, accepting or transferring them to a third party, whereas organizations routinely manage a wide range of risks (e.g. technological risks, commercial/financial risks, information security risks etc.).\n* [[Compliance (regulation)|Compliance]] means conforming with stated requirements. At an organizational level, it is achieved through management processes which identify the applicable requirements (defined for example in laws, regulations, contracts, strategies and policies), assess the state of compliance, assess the risks and potential costs of non-compliance against the projected expenses to achieve compliance, and hence prioritize, fund and initiate any corrective actions deemed necessary.\n\n=== GRC market segmentation ===\nA GRC program can be instituted to focus on any individual area within the enterprise, or a fully integrated GRC is able to work across all areas of the enterprise, using a single framework.\n\nA fully integrated GRC uses a single core set of control material, mapped to all of the primary governance factors being monitored.

With a large number of vendors entering this market recently, determining the best product for a given business problem can be challenging.  Given that the analysts don\u2019t fully agree on the market segmentation, vendor positioning can increase the confusion.\n\nDue to the dynamic nature of this market, any vendor analysis is often out of date relatively soon after its publication.\n\nBroadly, the vendor market can be considered to exist in 3 segments:\n\n*Integrated GRC solutions (multi-governance interest, enterprise wide)\n*Domain specific GRC solutions (single governance interest, enterprise wide)\n*Point solutions to GRC (relate to enterprise wide governance or enterprise wide risk or enterprise wide compliance but not in combination.)\n\nIntegrated GRC solutions attempt to unify the management of these areas, rather than treat them as separate entities.  An integrated solution is able to administer one central library of compliance controls, but manage, monitor and present them against every governance factor.  For example, in a domain specific approach, three or more findings could be generated against a single broken activity.  The integrated solution recognizes this as one break relating to the mapped governance factors.\n\nDomain specific GRC vendors understand the cyclical connection between governance, risk and compliance within a particular area of governance.  For example, within financial processing&nbsp;\u2014 that a risk will either relate to the absence of a control (need to update governance) and/or the lack of adherence to (or poor quality of) an existing control.  An initial goal of splitting out GRC into a separate market has left some vendors confused about the lack of movement.  It is thought that a lack of deep education within a domain on the audit side, coupled with a mistrust of audit in general causes a rift in a corporate environment.  However, there are vendors in the marketplace that, while remaining domain-specific, have begun marketing their product to end users and departments that, while either tangential or overlapping, have expanded to include the internal corporate internal audit (CIA) and external audit teams (tier 1 big four AND tier two and below), information security and operations/production as the target audience.  This approach provides a more 'open book' approach into the process.  If the production team will be audited by CIA using an application that production also has access to, is thought to reduce risk more quickly as the end goal is not to be 'compliant' but to be 'secure,' or as secure as possible.\n\nPoint solutions to GRC are marked by their focus on addressing only one of its areas.  In some cases of limited requirements, these solutions can serve a viable purpose.  However, because they tend to have been designed to solve domain specific problems in great depth, they generally do not take a unified approach and are not tolerant of integrated governance requirements.  [[Information system]]s will address these matters better if the requirements for GRC management are incorporated at the design stage, as part of a coherent framework.<ref>{{citation|author=Bonazzi, R., Hussami, L. & Pigneur, Y. |year=2009 |chapter-url=http://people.hec.unil.ch/ypigneur/files/2010/01/complianceManagement.pdf |chapter=Compliance Management is Becoming a Major Issue in IS Design |title=Information Systems: People, Organizations, Institutions, and Technologies |publisher=Springer |pages=391\u2013398 |doi=10.1007/978-3-7908-2148-2 |editor1-last=D'atri |editor1-first=Alessandro |editor2-last=Sacc\u00e0 |editor2-first=Domenico |accessdate=2013-04-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312075228/http://people.hec.unil.ch/ypigneur/files/2010/01/complianceManagement.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-12 |isbn=978-3-7908-2147-5 }}</ref>\n\n=== GRC data warehousing and business intelligence ===\nGRC vendors with an integrated data framework are now able to offer custom built GRC data warehouse and business intelligence solutions.  This allows high value data from any number of existing GRC applications to be collated and analysed.\n\nThe aggregation of GRC data using this approach adds significant benefit in the early identification of risk and business process (and business control) improvement.\n\nFurther benefits to this approach include (i) it allows existing, specialist and high value applications to continue without impact (ii) organizations can manage an easier transition into an integrated GRC approach because the initial change is only adding to the reporting layer and (iii) it provides a real-time ability to compare and contrast data value across systems that previously had no common data scheme.'\n\n== GRC research ==\nA publication review carried out in 2009 {{Citation needed|reason=\"A study is cited without referencing that study\"|date=March 2017}} found that there was hardly any scientific research on GRC. The authors went on to derive the first GRC short-definition from an extensive literature review. Subsequently, the definition was validated in a survey among GRC professionals. \"GRC is an integrated, holistic approach to organisation-wide GRC ensuring that an organisation acts ethically correct and in accordance with its risk appetite, internal policies and external regulations through the alignment of strategy, processes, technology and people, thereby improving efficiency and effectiveness.\" The authors then translated the definition into a frame of reference for GRC research.\n\nEach of the core disciplines \u2013 Governance, Risk Management and Compliance \u2013 consists of the four basic ''components'': strategy, processes, technology and people.\nThe organisation's [[risk appetite]], its internal policies and external regulations constitute the ''rules'' of GRC. The disciplines, their components and rules are now to be merged in an integrated, holistic and organisation-wide (the three main ''characteristics'' of GRC) manner&nbsp;\u2013 aligned with the (business) operations that are managed and supported through GRC. In applying this approach, organisations long to achieve the ''objectives'': ethically correct behaviour, and improved efficiency and effectiveness of any of the elements involved.<ref>{{citation |author=Racz, N., Weippl, E. & Seufert, A. |title=A frame of reference for research of integrated GRC |year=2010 |editor1=Bart De Decker |editor2=Ingrid Schaum\u00fcller-Bichl |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer |pages=106\u2013117 |isbn=978-3-642-13240-7 |volume=Communications and Multimedia Security, 11th IFIP TC 6/TC 11 International Conference, CMS 2010 Proceedings}}</ref>\n<!-- commenting out this section because another page for this is created at List of GRC Softwares\n== List of leading GRC Softwares ==\n\n* [http://www.bwise.com/ BWise]  \n* [https://www-01.ibm.com/software/in/analytics/openpages/ IBM OpenPages]  \n* [http://www.metricstream.com/ MetricStream AMR]\n* [https://risk.thomsonreuters.com/en/products.html Thomson Reuters]\n* [https://www.v-comply.com/ V-Comply]\n* [http://www.sas.com/en_in/software/risk-management/enterprise-grc.html sas]\n* [https://www.compli.com/ Compli]\n* [https://www.saiglobal.com/ SAI Global]\n-->\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Conformity assessment]]\n* [[ISO 19600]]\n* [[Records management]]\n* [[Regulatory compliance]]\n* [[List of GRC Software]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Business software]]\n[[Category:Enterprise modelling]]\n", "text_old": "{{Governance}}\n'''Governance, risk management and compliance''' ('''GRC''') is the term covering an organization's approach across these three practices: [[Governance]], [[risk management]], and [[regulatory compliance|compliance]].<ref>{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3aUyqPxYw10C |title=Governance, Risk, and Compliance Handbook |author=Anthony Tarantino |isbn=978-0-470-09589-8 |date=2008-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{citation |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Vi35vE6c1IC&pg=PA9 |title=SAP GRC For Dummies |author1=Denise Vu Broady |author2=Holly A.

This allows high value data from any number of existing GRC applications to be collated and analysed.\n\nThe aggregation of GRC data using this approach adds significant benefit in the early identification of risk and business process (and business control) improvement.\n\nFurther benefits to this approach include (i) it allows existing, specialist and high value applications to continue without impact (ii) organizations can manage an easier transition into an integrated GRC approach because the initial change is only adding to the reporting layer and (iii) it provides a real-time ability to compare and contrast data value across systems that previously had no common data scheme.'\n\n== GRC research ==\nA publication review carried out in 2009 {{Citation needed|reason=\"A study is cited without referencing that study\"|date=March 2017}} found that there was hardly any scientific research on GRC. The authors went on to derive the first GRC short-definition from an extensive literature review. Subsequently, the definition was validated in a survey among GRC professionals. \"GRC is an integrated, holistic approach to organisation-wide GRC ensuring that an organisation acts ethically correct and in accordance with its risk appetite, internal policies and external regulations through the alignment of strategy, processes, technology and people, thereby improving efficiency and effectiveness.\" The authors then translated the definition into a frame of reference for GRC research.\n\nEach of the core disciplines \u2013 Governance, Risk Management and Compliance \u2013 consists of the four basic ''components'': strategy, processes, technology and people.\nThe organisation's [[risk appetite]], its internal policies and external regulations constitute the ''rules'' of GRC. The disciplines, their components and rules are now to be merged in an integrated, holistic and organisation-wide (the three main ''characteristics'' of GRC) manner&nbsp;\u2013 aligned with the (business) operations that are managed and supported through GRC. In applying this approach, organisations long to achieve the ''objectives'': ethically correct behaviour, and improved efficiency and effectiveness of any of the elements involved.<ref>{{citation |author=Racz, N., Weippl, E. & Seufert, A. |title=A frame of reference for research of integrated GRC |year=2010 |editor1=Bart De Decker |editor2=Ingrid Schaum\u00fcller-Bichl |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer |pages=106\u2013117 |isbn=978-3-642-13240-7 |volume=Communications and Multimedia Security, 11th IFIP TC 6/TC 11 International Conference, CMS 2010 Proceedings}}</ref>\n<!-- commenting out this section because another page for this is created at List of GRC Softwares\n== List of leading GRC Softwares ==\n\n* [http://www.bwise.com/ BWise]  \n* [https://www-01.ibm.com/software/in/analytics/openpages/ IBM OpenPages]  \n* [http://www.metricstream.com/ MetricStream AMR]\n* [https://risk.thomsonreuters.com/en/products.html Thomson Reuters]\n* [https://www.v-comply.com/ V-Comply]\n* [http://www.sas.com/en_in/software/risk-management/enterprise-grc.html sas]\n* [https://www.compli.com/ Compli]\n* [https://www.saiglobal.com/ SAI Global]\n-->\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Conformity assessment]]\n* [[ISO 19600]]\n* [[Records management]]\n* [[Regulatory compliance]]\n* [[List of GRC Software]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Business software]]\n[[Category:Enterprise modelling]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance,_risk_management,_and_compliance"}
