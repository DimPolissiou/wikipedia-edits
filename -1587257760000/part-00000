Because of its potential for the 'devastation of enemy lands and the destruction of industrial and populous centres on a vast scale', he recommended a new air service be formed that would be on a level with the [[British Army|Army]] and [[Royal Navy]].  The new air service was to receive direction from a new ministry and on 29 November 1917 the [[Air Force (Constitution) Act 1917|Air Force Bill]] received [[Royal Assent]] and the Air Ministry was formed just over a month later on 2 January 1918.

Retrieved on 19 January 2007.</ref>\n\n==History \u2013 from 1918==\n\n===1918\u20131921===\nIn 1919 the RAF and the Air Ministry came under immense political and inter service pressure for their very existence, particularly in a climate of significantly reduced military expenditure. The battle was kickstarted by the resignation in December 1918 of [[William Weir, 1st Viscount Weir|William Weir]] the [[President of the Air Council]] (the governing body of the Royal Air Force), who wished to return to his commercial activities.<ref>John Sweetman 1984: \"Crucial Months for Survival: The Royal Air Force 1918\u201319\", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol. 19 No.3 (July 1984) p.529</ref>\n\nThis led the Prime Minister, [[Lloyd George]], to create a [[Secretary of State for Air]], but not as a Cabinet position, and on 9 January 1919 offered Winston Churchill the two posts of [[Secretary of State for War]], which was a Cabinet position, and Secretary of State for Air both of which he accepted.\n\nThis combination under one person by was criticised in both the press and Parliament. However, Churchill re-iterated that the continued \"integrity, the unity, the independence of the Royal Air Force will be sedulously and carefully maintained\". During 1919 it was also decided that civil aviation was to be brought into the Air Ministry rather than being dealt with by either the [[Board of Trade]] or the Foreign Office.<ref>John Sweetman 1984: \"Crucial Months for Survival: The Royal Air Force 1918\u201319\", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol. 19 No.3 (July 1984) p.531</ref>\n\nThe Army and the [[War Office]] had largely agreed to the continued existence of the RAF due, in part, to the enthusiasm for the air service by the Army's political leader Winston Churchill. However, one of the main difficulties for the RAF and Air Ministry in 1919 was the opposition by the [[Royal Navy]] to losing their own air service and subsequent lobbying that personnel for naval air purposes afloat be naval officers and ratings \u2013 this would have led to a recreation of the now disbanded [[Royal Naval Air Service]]. This negotiation led to the creation of [[RAF Coastal Area]] the predecessor of [[RAF Coastal Command]] to deal with its relationship with the Navy. Throughout 1919 there were discussions between [[Sir Hugh Trenchard]] [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]] and Sir [[Rosslyn Wemyss]] [[First Sea Lord]] as to the nature of the relationship between the Air Force and Air Ministry and the Navy and the Admiralty.<ref>John Sweetman 1984: \"Crucial Months for Survival: The Royal Air Force 1918\u201319\", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol. 19 No.3 (July 1984) pp.531\u201333</ref>\n\nIn 1919 the Air Ministry formally took control of supply, design and inspection of all aircraft (aeroplanes and airships) from the Ministry of Munitions. This helped put the existence of Air Ministry on a firmer footing.<ref>John Sweetman 1984: \"Crucial Months for Survival: The Royal Air Force 1918\u201319\", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol. 19 No.3 (July 1984) p.538</ref>\n\nThroughout 1919 Churchill persistently supported an independent air force. He presented the White Paper, largely written by [[Sir Hugh Trenchard]], on the future of the RAF on 12 December 1919. It was this White Paper that was to be the effective charter for the RAF and Air Ministry in subsequent years.\n\n===1921\u20131927===\nIn February 1921 [[Lloyd George]] appointed Churchill to the [[Colonial Office]] and appointed his Chief Whip, [[Frederick Guest]] as Secretary of State for Air on 1 April. During his eighteen months in office he played \"a minor part in the desperate struggle to maintain the air force's institutional independence in the face of hostile attacks from the War Office and the Admiralty\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</ref> More importantly in the long term he was also responsible for the appointment of [[Sir Sefton Brancker]] to develop civil aviation.\n\nWith the fall of Lloyd George [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]] became the Secretary of State for Air in October 1922 under [[Bonar Law]]. On Law's death [[Stanley Baldwin]] became Prime Minister and gave the position Cabinet status in May 1923,<ref>David Butler and Gareth Butler 1986: British Political Facts 1900\u20131983 Sixth Edition {{ISBN|0-333-39949-8}} pp.12\u201315</ref> and Hoare remained in the post until January 1924, when a Labour government took power. [[Lord Thomson]] was made Secretary of State for Air. A supporter of airships, Thomson was responsible for the [[Imperial Airship Scheme]], which involved the construction of R101 at the Royal Airship Works at Cardington.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nAfter the fall of the MacDonald government in November 1924 Hoare returned to the Air Ministry. He was interested in developing air links to the Empire and Dominion countries, particularly India and South Africa. He negotiated a subsidy from the Treasury for [[Imperial Airways]] to start a service from Cairo to India. Hoare, with his wife Lady Maud, flew on the inaugural 13-day flight to Delhi, leaving Croydon on 26 December 1926 and arriving on 8 January 1927. The air route to Cape Town, after much negotiation, was finalised in 1929, before he left office, but only commenced in 1932.<ref>Cross J.A. (1977) ''Sir Samuel Hoare: A Political Biography''. London: Jonathan Cape {{ISBN|0-224-01350-5}} p.101</ref>\n\n===1927\u20131929===\nHis time at the Air Ministry was marked by several important developments that were to confirm the status of the Royal Air Force as a separate entity, play a part in the growth of civil aviation and to develop the awareness of the public about aviation.\n\nAn early priority for [[Sir Hugh Trenchard]], [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]] 1919\u20131930, was to establish the officer cadet training college at Cranwell as a permanent establishment. It was Hoare's job to negotiate with the Treasury for the necessary funds. After much resistance Hoare managed to include a provision for permanent buildings in his estimates for 1929. The foundation stone of the [[Royal Air Force College Cranwell]] was laid in 1929 and formally opened in 1934.<ref>Cross J.A. (1977) ''Sir Samuel Hoare: A Political Biography''. London: Jonathan Cape {{ISBN|0-224-01350-5}} pp.99\u2013100</ref>\n\nTrenchard had conceived the idea of a university air officer training corps, a sort of Territorial Army for the R.A.F. Hoare and particularly his well connected Parliamentary Private Secretary the academic Sir Geoffrey Butler, then created [[University Air Squadrons]], at Cambridge University then at Oxford University in October 1925, without, however the militarism of the Officer Training Corps and in close collaboration with scientific and engineering work of the Universities.<ref>Cross J.A. (1977) ''Sir Samuel Hoare: A Political Biography''. London: Jonathan Cape {{ISBN|0-224-01350-5}} p.99</ref>\n\nThe Air Ministry was also responsible for civil aviation. Early on Hoare set up the Civil Air Transport Subsidies Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir Hubert Hambling to look at the system of subsidies to competing air lines. They reported in February 1923, favouring a single commercial company to run Britain's air routes. In March 1924 [[Imperial Airways]] was created from a merger of the four largest airlines.<ref>Cross J.A. (1977) ''Sir Samuel Hoare: A Political Biography''. London: Jonathan Cape {{ISBN|0-224-01350-5}} p100</ref>\n\nThe third aspect of Hoare's time at the Air Ministry (after the R.A.F. and civil airlines) was to make public opinion sympathetic to air power and air travel. His much publicised flight to India in 1926-7 was part of this. He also realised the importance of the [[Schneider Trophy]] and was instrumental in making sure that the R.A.F was involved. Britain's winning entries in 1927, 1929 and 1931 were flown by R.A.F. pilots and the teams partially subsidised by the Air Ministry.<ref>Cross J.A. (1977) ''Sir Samuel Hoare: A Political Biography''. London: Jonathan Cape {{ISBN|0-224-01350-5}} pp.104\u2013105</ref>\n\n==Activities==\n\n===Aircraft production===\nThe Air Ministry issued specifications for aircraft that British aircraft companies would supply prototypes to. These were then assessed, if ordered the Ministry assigned the aircraft name. (see [[List of Air Ministry specifications]]).\n\nThe ordering procedure used I.T.P. (Intention to Proceed) contract papers; these specified a maximum fixed price, which could (after investigation) be less. But when [[Lord Nuffield]] got the I.T.P.  contract papers for a Wolseley radial aero engine, which would have required re-orientation of their offices with an army of chartered accountants, he decided to deal only with the War Office and the Admiralty, not the Air Ministry. So the aero engine project was abandoned in 1936, see [[Airspeed Ltd#Wolseley engine|Airspeed]].  [[Nevil Shute Norway]] wrote that the loss of such a technically advanced engine was a great loss to Britain as well as Airspeed, and blamed the over-cautious high civil servants of the Air Ministry. When he had asked Lord Nuffield to retain the engine, Nuffield said: ''I tell you, Norway ... I sent that I.T.P. thing back to them, and I told them they could put it where the monkey put the nuts!''<ref>''Slide Rule'' by [[Nevil Shute]] (1954, William Heinemann, London) page 235</ref>\n\nIn later years the actual production of aircraft was the responsibility of the [[Ministry of Aircraft Production]] (1940\u201346), the [[Ministry of Supply]] (1946\u201359), the [[Ministry of Aviation]] (1959\u201367) and finally the [[Ministry of Technology]] (1967\u201370).\n\n{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}\n\n===Weather forecasting===\nThe Air Ministry was responsible for [[weather forecasting]] over the UK, from 1919 it being the government department responsible for the [[Met Office|Meteorological Office]].\n\nAs a result of the need for weather information for aviation, the Meteorological Office located many of its observation and data collection points on [[Royal Air Force station|RAF station]]s.\n\n===World War II technology===\nIn the 1930s, the Air Ministry commissioned a scientific study of propagating electromagnetic energy which concluded that a [[death ray]] was impractical but detection of aircraft appeared feasible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doramusic.com/Radar.htm |title=Radar |accessdate=6 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710144447/http://www.doramusic.com/Radar.htm |archivedate=10 July 2011 }}</ref> [[Robert Watson-Watt]] demonstrated a working prototype and patented the device in 1935 (British Patent GB593017).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radar-france.fr/brevet%20radar1934.htm |title=Copy of Patents for the invention of radar |publisher=radar-france.fr |language=fr |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116093441/http://www.radar-france.fr/brevet%20radar1934.htm |archivedate=16 January 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.patent.gov.uk/media/pressrelease/2001/1009.htm British man first to patent radar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719224405/http://www.patent.gov.uk/media/pressrelease/2001/1009.htm |date=19 July 2006 }} official site of the ''Patent Office''</ref><ref>{{patent|GB|593017|''Improvements in or relating to wireless systems''}}</ref> The device served as the base for the [[Chain Home]] network of radars to defend Great Britain.\n\nBy April 1944, the ministry's [[RAF Intelligence|air Intelligence]] branch had succeeded in its intelligence efforts regarding \"[[Battle of the Beams|the beams]], [[Operation Biting|the Bruneval Raid]], [[Gibraltar (disambiguation)|the Gibraltar barrage]], [[History of radar|radar]], [[Chaff (countermeasure)|Window]], [[Norwegian heavy water sabotage|heavy water]], and the [[Night fighter#Germany|German nightfighters]]\" ([[R.V.

Because of its potential for the 'devastation of enemy lands and the destruction of industrial and populous centres on a vast scale', he recommended a new air service be formed that would be on a level with the [[British Army|Army]] and [[Royal Navy]].  The new air service was to receive direction from a new ministry and on 29 November 1917 the [[Air Force (Constitution) Act 1917|Air Force Bill]] received [[Royal Assent]] and the Air Ministry was formed just over a month later on 2 January 1918.  [[Harold Sidney Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]] was appointed the first [[Secretary of State for Air|Air Minister]].  On 3 January, the [[Air Council]] was constituted as follows:<ref>{{cite book |last=Joubert de la Fert\u00e9 |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Joubert de la Fert\u00e9 |title=The Third Service |year=1955 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |page=61}}</ref>\n\n*[[Harold Sidney Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]], [[Secretary of State for Air|Air Minister]] and President\n*Lieutenant-General [[David Henderson (British Army officer)|Sir David Henderson]], Additional Member and Vice-President\n*Major-General [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard|Sir Hugh Trenchard]], [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]]\n*Major-General (formerly Rear-Admiral) [[Mark Kerr (Royal Navy officer)|Mark Kerr]], [[Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]]\n*Major-General (formerly Commodore) [[Godfrey Paine]], [[Air Member for Personnel|Master General of Personnel]]\n*Major-General [[Sefton Brancker]], Controller-General of Equipment\n*[[William Weir, 1st Viscount Weir|Sir William Weir]], Director-General of Aircraft Production in the [[Ministry of Munitions]]\n*Sir John Hunter, Administrator of Works and Buildings\n*Major [[John Baird, 1st Viscount Stonehaven|J L Baird]] [[Under-Secretary of State for Air|Permanent Under-Secretary]]\n\nThe Air Ministry initially met in the [[Hotel Cecil (London)|Hotel Cecil]] on [[Strand, London|the Strand]].

Retrieved on 19 January 2007.</ref>\n\n==History \u2013 from 1918==\n\n===1918\u20131921===\nIn 1919 the [[RAF]] and the Air Ministry came under immense political and inter service pressure for their very existence, particularly in a climate of significantly reduced military expenditure. The battle was kickstarted by the resignation in December 1918 of [[William Weir, 1st Viscount Weir|William Weir]] the [[President of the Air Council]] (the governing body of the Royal Air Force), who wished to return to his commercial activities.<ref>John Sweetman 1984: \"Crucial Months for Survival: The Royal Air Force 1918\u201319\", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol. 19 No.3 (July 1984) p.529</ref>\n\nThis led the Prime Minister, [[Lloyd George]], to create a [[Secretary of State for Air]], but not as a Cabinet position, and on 9 January 1919 offered Winston Churchill the two posts of [[Secretary of State for War]], which was a Cabinet position, and [[Secretary of State for Air]] both of which he accepted.\n\nThis combination under one person by was criticised in both the press and Parliament. However, Churchill re-iterated that the continued \"integrity, the unity, the independence of the Royal Air Force will be sedulously and carefully maintained\". During 1919 it was also decided that civil aviation was to be brought into the Air Ministry rather than being dealt with by either the [[Board of Trade]] or the Foreign Office.<ref>John Sweetman 1984: \"Crucial Months for Survival: The Royal Air Force 1918\u201319\", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol. 19 No.3 (July 1984) p.531</ref>\n\nThe Army and the [[War Office]] had largely agreed to the continued existence of the [[RAF]] due, in part, to the enthusiasm for the air service by the Army's political leader [[Winston Churchill]]. However, one of the main difficulties for the RAF and Air Ministry in 1919 was the opposition by the [[Royal Navy]] to losing their own air service and subsequent lobbying that personnel for naval air purposes afloat be naval officers and ratings \u2013 this would have led to a recreation of the now disbanded [[Royal Naval Air Service]]. This negotiation led to the creation of [[RAF Coastal Area]] the predecessor of [[RAF Coastal Command]] to deal with its relationship with the Navy. Throughout 1919 there were discussions between [[Sir Hugh Trenchard]] [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]] and Sir [[Rosslyn Wemyss]] [[First Sea Lord]] as to the nature of the relationship between the Air Force and Air Ministry and the Navy and the Admiralty.<ref>John Sweetman 1984: \"Crucial Months for Survival: The Royal Air Force 1918\u201319\", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol. 19 No.3 (July 1984) pp.531\u201333</ref>\n\nIn 1919 the Air Ministry formally took control of supply, design and inspection of all aircraft (aeroplanes and airships) from the Ministry of Munitions. This helped put the existence of Air Ministry on a firmer footing.<ref>John Sweetman 1984: \"Crucial Months for Survival: The Royal Air Force 1918\u201319\", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol. 19 No.3 (July 1984) p.538</ref>\n\nThroughout 1919 Churchill persistently supported an independent air force. He presented the White Paper, largely written by [[Sir Hugh Trenchard]], on the future of the [[RAF]] on 12 December 1919. It was this White Paper that was to be the effective charter for the [[RAF]] and Air Ministry in subsequent years.\n\n===1921\u20131927===\nIn February 1921 [[Lloyd George]] appointed Churchill to the [[Colonial Office]] and appointed his Chief Whip, [[Frederick Guest]] as Secretary of State for Air on 1 April. During his eighteen months in office he played \"a minor part in the desperate struggle to maintain the air force's institutional independence in the face of hostile attacks from the War Office and the Admiralty\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</ref> More importantly in the long term he was also responsible for the appointment of [[Sir Sefton Brancker]] to develop civil aviation.\n\nWith the fall of Lloyd George [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]] became the Secretary of State for Air in October 1922 under [[Bonar Law]]. On Law's death [[Stanley Baldwin]] became Prime Minister and gave the position Cabinet status in May 1923,<ref>David Butler and Gareth Butler 1986: British Political Facts 1900\u20131983 Sixth Edition {{ISBN|0-333-39949-8}} pp.12\u201315</ref> and Hoare remained in the post until January 1924, when a Labour government took power. [[Lord Thomson]] was made Secretary of State for Air. A supporter of airships, Thomson was responsible for the [[Imperial Airship Scheme]], which involved the construction of R101 at the Royal Airship Works at Cardington.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nAfter the fall of the MacDonald government in November 1924 Hoare returned to the Air Ministry. He was interested in developing air links to the Empire and Dominion countries, particularly India and South Africa. He negotiated a subsidy from the Treasury for [[Imperial Airways]] to start a service from Cairo to India. Hoare, with his wife Lady Maud, flew on the inaugural 13-day flight to Delhi, leaving Croydon on 26 December 1926 and arriving on 8 January 1927. The air route to Cape Town, after much negotiation, was finalised in 1929, before he left office, but only commenced in 1932.<ref>Cross J.A. (1977) ''Sir Samuel Hoare: A Political Biography''. London: Jonathan Cape {{ISBN|0-224-01350-5}} p.101</ref>\n\n===1927\u20131929===\nHis time at the Air Ministry was marked by several important developments that were to confirm the status of the Royal Air Force as a separate entity, play a part in the growth of civil aviation and to develop the awareness of the public about aviation.\n\nAn early priority for [[Sir Hugh Trenchard]], [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]] 1919\u20131930, was to establish the officer cadet training college at Cranwell as a permanent establishment. It was Hoare's job to negotiate with the Treasury for the necessary funds. After much resistance Hoare managed to include a provision for permanent buildings in his estimates for 1929. The foundation stone of the [[Royal Air Force College Cranwell]] was laid in 1929 and formally opened in 1934.<ref>Cross J.A. (1977) ''Sir Samuel Hoare: A Political Biography''. London: Jonathan Cape {{ISBN|0-224-01350-5}} pp.99\u2013100</ref>\n\nTrenchard had conceived the idea of a university air officer training corps, a sort of Territorial Army for the R.A.F. Hoare and particularly his well connected Parliamentary Private Secretary the academic Sir Geoffrey Butler, then created [[University Air Squadrons]], at Cambridge University then at Oxford University in October 1925, without, however the militarism of the Officer Training Corps and in close collaboration with scientific and engineering work of the Universities.<ref>Cross J.A. (1977) ''Sir Samuel Hoare: A Political Biography''. London: Jonathan Cape {{ISBN|0-224-01350-5}} p.99</ref>\n\nThe Air Ministry was also responsible for civil aviation. Early on Hoare set up the Civil Air Transport Subsidies Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir Hubert Hambling to look at the system of subsidies to competing air lines. They reported in February 1923, favouring a single commercial company to run Britain's air routes. In March 1924 [[Imperial Airways]] was created from a merger of the four largest airlines.<ref>Cross J.A. (1977) ''Sir Samuel Hoare: A Political Biography''. London: Jonathan Cape {{ISBN|0-224-01350-5}} p100</ref>\n\nThe third aspect of Hoare's time at the Air Ministry (after the R.A.F. and civil airlines) was to make public opinion sympathetic to air power and air travel. His much publicised flight to India in 1926-7 was part of this. He also realised the importance of the [[Schneider Trophy]] and was instrumental in making sure that the R.A.F was involved. Britain's winning entries in 1927, 1929 and 1931 were flown by R.A.F. pilots and the teams partially subsidised by the Air Ministry.<ref>Cross J.A. (1977) ''Sir Samuel Hoare: A Political Biography''. London: Jonathan Cape {{ISBN|0-224-01350-5}} pp.104\u2013105</ref>\n\n==Activities==\n\n===Aircraft production===\nThe Air Ministry issued specifications for aircraft that British aircraft companies would supply prototypes to. These were then assessed, if ordered the Ministry assigned the aircraft name. (see [[List of Air Ministry specifications]]).\n\nThe ordering procedure used I.T.P. (Intention to Proceed) contract papers; these specified a maximum fixed price, which could (after investigation) be less. But when [[Lord Nuffield]] got the I.T.P.  contract papers for a Wolseley radial aero engine, which would have required re-orientation of their offices with an army of chartered accountants, he decided to deal only with the War Office and the Admiralty, not the Air Ministry. So the aero engine project was abandoned in 1936, see [[Airspeed Ltd#Wolseley engine|Airspeed]].  [[Nevil Shute Norway]] wrote that the loss of such a technically advanced engine was a great loss to Britain as well as Airspeed, and blamed the over-cautious high civil servants of the Air Ministry. When he had asked Lord Nuffield to retain the engine, Nuffield said: ''I tell you, Norway ... I sent that I.T.P. thing back to them, and I told them they could put it where the monkey put the nuts!''<ref>''Slide Rule'' by [[Nevil Shute]] (1954, William Heinemann, London) page 235</ref>\n\nIn later years the actual production of aircraft was the responsibility of the [[Ministry of Aircraft Production]] (1940\u201346), the [[Ministry of Supply]] (1946\u201359), the [[Ministry of Aviation]] (1959\u201367) and finally the [[Ministry of Technology]] (1967\u201370).\n\n{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}\n\n===Weather forecasting===\nThe Air Ministry was responsible for [[weather forecasting]] over the UK, from 1919 it being the government department responsible for the [[Met Office|Meteorological Office]].\n\nAs a result of the need for weather information for aviation, the Meteorological Office located many of its observation and data collection points on [[Royal Air Force station|RAF station]]s.\n\n===World War II technology===\nIn the 1930s, the Air Ministry commissioned a scientific study of propagating electromagnetic energy which concluded that a [[death ray]] was impractical but detection of aircraft appeared feasible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doramusic.com/Radar.htm |title=Radar |accessdate=6 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710144447/http://www.doramusic.com/Radar.htm |archivedate=10 July 2011 }}</ref> [[Robert Watson-Watt]] demonstrated a working prototype and patented the device in 1935 (British Patent GB593017).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radar-france.fr/brevet%20radar1934.htm |title=Copy of Patents for the invention of radar |publisher=radar-france.fr |language=fr |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116093441/http://www.radar-france.fr/brevet%20radar1934.htm |archivedate=16 January 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.patent.gov.uk/media/pressrelease/2001/1009.htm British man first to patent radar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719224405/http://www.patent.gov.uk/media/pressrelease/2001/1009.htm |date=19 July 2006 }} official site of the ''Patent Office''</ref><ref>{{patent|GB|593017|''Improvements in or relating to wireless systems''}}</ref> The device served as the base for the [[Chain Home]] network of radars to defend Great Britain.\n\nBy April 1944, the ministry's [[RAF Intelligence|air Intelligence]] branch had succeeded in its intelligence efforts regarding \"[[Battle of the Beams|the beams]], [[Operation Biting|the Bruneval Raid]], [[Gibraltar (disambiguation)|the Gibraltar barrage]], [[History of radar|radar]], [[Chaff (countermeasure)|Window]], [[Norwegian heavy water sabotage|heavy water]], and the [[Night fighter#Germany|German nightfighters]]\" ([[R.V.
