As with most interstates that end in a five, it is a major cross-country, north-south route, connecting the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the [[Great Lakes]]. Its southern terminus is located at an [[Interchange (road)|interchange]] with [[Interstate 10 in Alabama|I-10]] in [[Mobile, Alabama]], and its northern terminus is at an interchange with [[Indiana Toll Road|I-90]], [[U.S. Route 12 in Indiana|U.S. Route&nbsp;12]] (US&nbsp;12), and [[U.S. Route 20 in Indiana|U.S. Route 20]] (the [[Dunes Highway]]) in [[Gary, Indiana]], just southeast of [[Chicago]].\n\nI-65 connects several major metropolitan areas in the Midwest and Southern United States. It connects the four largest cities in Alabama: [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], and [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]]. It also serves as one of the main north\u2013south routes through [[Nashville, Tennessee]]; [[Louisville, Kentucky]] and [[Indianapolis]], Indiana; each a major metropolitan area in its respective state.\n\n== Route description ==\n{{lengths table|length_ref=<ref name=fhwa />}}\n|-\n| [[Interstate 65 in Alabama|AL]]\n| 367.00\n| 590.63\n|-\n| [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|TN]]\n| 121.71\n| 195.87\n|-\n| [[Interstate 65 in Kentucky|KY]]\n| 137.32\n| 221.00\n|-\n| [[Interstate 65 in Indiana|IN]]\n| 261.27\n| 420.47\n|-\n| '''Total'''\n| 887.30\n| 1427.97\n|}\n\n=== Alabama ===\n{{Main|Interstate 65 in Alabama}}\n[[File:I20I59Birmingham.JPG|left|thumb|Approaching an exit for I-65 in downtown Birmingham]]\n\nIn the state of Alabama, I-65 passes through or near four of the state's major metropolitan areas: [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], and [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]]. I-65 begins its path northward in Mobile at its junction with [[Interstate 10|I-10]]. From I-10, I-65 runs west of downtown Mobile and through the northern suburbs of the city before turning northeasterly towards Montgomery. In Montgomery, I-65 connects with the southern terminus of [[Interstate 85|I-85]]. In Birmingham, I-65 has an [[highway interchange|interchange]] with [[Interstate 20|I-20]]/[[Interstate 59|I-59]]. North of downtown, [[Interstate 22|I-22]] branches off I-65 towards [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. From Birmingham, I-65 continues north, crossing the [[Tennessee River]] near [[Decatur, Alabama|Decatur]]. A few miles north of the river, it interchanges with [[Interstate 565|I-565]], a short [[spur route]] which provides access to Huntsville. It then continues northwards out of the Tennessee Valley to the state of [[Tennessee]], towards [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].\n\n=== Tennessee ===\n{{Main|Interstate 65 in Tennessee}}\n\n[[File:I-65 Southbound in Nashville.JPG|right|thumb|Interstate 65 southbound in [[Nashville]].]]\n\nI-65 enters Tennessee from the south near the town of [[Ardmore, Tennessee|Ardmore]] and passes through mostly rural territory for {{convert|65|mi|km}}. It then passes [[Lewisburg, Tennessee|Lewisburg]]. Then it passes close to [[Columbia, Tennessee|Columbia]] and crosses [[Saturn Parkway]], which brings travelers to the town of [[Spring Hill, Tennessee|Spring Hill]]. I-65 then continues on to reach [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|I-840]] and progresses until it intersects [[Tennessee State Route 96|SR&nbsp;96]] at [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]]. Then the highway goes through [[Brentwood, Tennessee|Brentwood]], [[Nashville]], [[Madison, Tennessee|Madison]], [[Goodlettsville, Tennessee|Goodlettsville]], [[White House, Tennessee|White House]], and then close to [[Portland, Tennessee|Portland]], it crosses into the state of [[Kentucky]] at milepost 120.5.\n\n=== Kentucky ===\n{{Main|Interstate 65 in Kentucky}}\n\n[[File:I-65 in Kentucky.jpg|left|thumb|Interstate 65 northbound at the former [[William H. Natcher Parkway]] (now [[Interstate 165 (Kentucky)|Interstate 165]]) in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]], 2007.]]\n\nI-65 enters the state {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} south of [[Franklin, Kentucky|Franklin]]. Throughout its length, it passes near [[Mammoth Cave National Park]], [[Bernheim Forest]], the [[National Corvette Museum]] and the [[Fort Knox Military Reservation]].\n\nThe first major intersection in the state is with [[Interstate 165 (Kentucky)|I-165]] at [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]]. I-65 has intersections with three of the [[List of Parkways and named roads in Kentucky|parkways]] in the state. The first major junction is with the [[Cumberland Parkway]] near Rocky Hill. At [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky|Elizabethtown]], it has two more parkway interchanges with the [[Wendell H. Ford Western Kentucky Parkway]] and the [[Martha Layne Collins Bluegrass Parkway]]. I-65 also has interchanges with [[Interstate 265|I-265]], [[Interstate 264 (Kentucky)|I-264]], [[Interstate 64|I-64]], and [[Interstate 71|I-71]].\n\nThe widest stretch of Interstate 65 in its entirety is in Louisville at [[Kentucky Route 1065]] (KY&nbsp;1065, Outer Loop), where the main line is 14 lanes wide. The highway crosses the [[Ohio River]] into Indiana on a toll bridge.  The southbound side is called the [[John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge]] (southbound) and the northbound side is called the [[Abraham Lincoln Bridge]]. The latter bridge opened in October 2016 as part of the [[Ohio River Bridges Project]]. Prior to the project, the John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge (completed in 1963) carried traffic in both directions. The project also included reconstruction of the [[Kennedy Interchange|I-65/I-64/I-71 convergence interchange]] just south of the Kennedy Bridge, plus renovating the older span to carry six lanes of southbound traffic. Additionally, a second six-lane cable-stayed bridge {{convert|12|mi|km}} upstream on the Ohio, the [[Lewis and Clark Bridge (Ohio River)|Lewis and Clark Bridge]], was built as part of the project, opening in December 2016 to complete the I-265 loop around Louisville.\n\nAt one time, the sixty-five-mile stretch of I-65 from Louisville to Elizabethtown was a toll road, called the [[Kentucky Turnpike]]. The bonds that financed the road have been paid off, and tolls are no longer collected. All signs of the former turnpike have been removed.  \n\nOn November 15, 2006, the stretch of I-65 from Bowling Green to Louisville was renamed the [[Abraham Lincoln]] Memorial Expressway.\n\nOn February 12, 2007, a bill passed the [[Kentucky Senate]] to rename I-65 in [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson County]] the [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]] Expressway.<ref>{{cite news |work= The Courier-Journal |location= Louisville, KY |date=February 13, 2007 |last=Gerth |first=Joseph |title=Senate OKs renaming I-65 for King}}</ref> Signs were posted July 25, 2007.<ref>{{cite news |work= The Courier-Journal |location= Louisville, KY |date= July 25, 2007 |last= Shafer |first= Sheldon S. |title= Mayor, Democrats back I-65 King plan |url= http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20070125/NEWS01/701250404/Mayor-Democrats-back-I-65-King-plan |accessdate=July 30, 2007}}</ref>\n\nOn July 15, 2007, Kentucky highway officials raised the speed limits on most Interstate and State Parkway highways to {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h}}. Prior to that, Kentucky was the only state along I-65 that had a maximum speed limit of {{convert|65|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\n=== Indiana ===\n{{Main|Interstate 65 in Indiana}}\n\n[[File:I-65 in Indianapolis.jpg|thumb|right|Interstate 65 just outside [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]]]\n\nI-65 enters Indiana at [[Jeffersonville, Indiana|Jeffersonville]] and [[Clarksville, Indiana|Clarksville]]. Miles 0\u20139 were rebuilt, widened and realigned from north of Sellersburg to the Ohio River during 2008\u201310, giving great traffic relief to the fast-growing Indiana suburbs of Louisville. Over 300,000 of the 1.5 million persons in Louisville's CMSA live in its Indiana counties.\n\nA section of I-65 in [[downtown Indianapolis, Indiana|downtown Indianapolis]] runs concurrent with [[Interstate 70|I-70]]. The junctions are often referred to as the \"North Split\" and the \"South Split\", forming a section of Interstate locally known as the \"Inner Loop\" or \"The Spaghetti Bowl\" due to the visual complexity of the intersecting ramps and overpasses.\n\nIn mid-March 2007, a {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=on}} section of I-70 from the North Split to [[Interstate 465|I-465]] east of downtown was restricted to automobiles only for the \"Super 70\" project, a massive rebuild and expansion of that freeway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/dot/div/projects/i70/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029041051/http://www.in.gov/dot/div/projects/i70/index.html|title=Super 70|archivedate=October 29, 2007|work=in.gov}}</ref> Trucks over {{convert|13|ST}} were forced to divert through I-65 if coming from the north and use the circular I-465 to the south to reconnect to I-70 eastbound. Westbound traffic from I-70 was required to loop north or south along I-465 to get to I-65 or I-70. The Super 70 project was completed in November 2007.\n\nIn the middle of 2003, the portion of I-65 that runs concurrently with I-70 was closed to all traffic due to the \"HyperFix\" project. During that time, a new concrete surface was installed and the overpasses were upgraded.\n\nIn 1999, the {{convert|25|mi|km|adj=on}} segment of I-65 between the two I-465 interchanges was renamed the [[Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds|Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds Highway]].\n\nNorth of [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]] near [[Brookston, Indiana|Brookston]], the road passes through the [[Meadow Lake Wind Farm]] for several miles, with the turbines and standards spaced out in order to avoid a collapse onto the highway. The [[Fowler Ridge Wind Farm]] is also visible on both sides of the highway.\n\nFrom its crossing into [[Lake County, Indiana|Lake County]], [[Indiana]], over the Kankakee River to its northern terminus, the highway is known as the [[Kazimierz Pu\u0142aski|Casimir Pulaski]] Memorial Highway.\n\nPrior to 2004, the northern terminus of Interstate 65 was only {{convert|1/8|mi|km}} north of [[Interstate 90|I-90]] (Indiana Toll Road). Traffic going from I-90 to I-65 had to stop at a traffic signal to make a left turn. Traffic from I-65 to I-90 bypassed the traffic signal via an isolated right-turn lane. In 2004, the interchange was fully grade-separated, so it is now one interchange involving I-65, I-90, US&nbsp;12, and US&nbsp;20, thereby eliminating a [[Interstate Gaps#Connection gaps|connection gap]] in the [[Interstate Highway system]].\n\n==Junction list==\n;Alabama\n: {{jct|country=USA|I|10}} in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]]\n: {{jct|country=USA|US|90}} in Mobile\n: {{jct|country=USA|US|98}} in Mobile\n: {{jct|country=USA|US|45}} in [[Prichard, Alabama|Prichard]]\n: {{jct|state=AL|I|165}} in Prichard\n: {{jct|country=USA|US|43}} north-northeast of [[Satsuma, Alabama|Satsuma]]\n: {{jct|country=USA|US|84}} west-southwest of [[Evergreen, Conecuh County, Alabama|Evergreen]]\n: {{jct|country=USA|US|31}} on the [[Hope Hull, Alabama|Hope Hull]]\u2013[[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] line\n: {{jct|country=USA|US|80}} in Montgomery.

As with most interstates that end in a five, it is a major cross-country, north-south route, connecting the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the [[Great Lakes]]. Its southern terminus is located at an [[Interchange (road)|interchange]] with [[Interstate 10 in Alabama|I-10]] in [[Mobile, Alabama]], and its northern terminus is at an interchange with [[Indiana Toll Road|I-90]], [[U.S. Route 12 in Indiana|U.S. Route&nbsp;12]] (US&nbsp;12), and [[U.S. Route 20 in Indiana|U.S. Route 20]] (the [[Dunes Highway]]) in [[Gary, Indiana]], just southeast of [[Chicago]].\n\nI-65 connects several major metropolitan areas in the Midwest and Southern United States. It connects the four largest cities in Alabama: [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], and [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]]. It also serves as one of the main north\u2013south routes through [[Nashville, Tennessee]]; [[Louisville, Kentucky]] and [[Indianapolis]], Indiana; each a major metropolitan area in its respective state.\n\n== Route description ==\n{{lengths table|length_ref=<ref name=fhwa />}}\n|-\n| [[Interstate 65 in Alabama|AL]]\n| 367.00\n| 590.63\n|-\n| [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|TN]]\n| 121.71\n| 195.87\n|-\n| [[Interstate 65 in Kentucky|KY]]\n| 137.32\n| 221.00\n|-\n| [[Interstate 65 in Indiana|IN]]\n| 261.27\n| 420.47\n|-\n| '''Total'''\n| 887.30\n| 1427.97\n|}\n\n=== Alabama ===\n{{Main|Interstate 65 in Alabama}}\n[[File:I20I59Birmingham.JPG|left|thumb|Approaching an exit for I-65 in downtown Birmingham]]\n\nIn the state of Alabama, I-65 passes through or near four of the state's major metropolitan areas: [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], and [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]]. I-65 begins its path northward in Mobile at its junction with [[Interstate 10|I-10]]. From I-10, I-65 runs west of downtown Mobile and through the northern suburbs of the city before turning northeasterly towards Montgomery. In Montgomery, I-65 connects with the southern terminus of [[Interstate 85|I-85]]. In Birmingham, I-65 has an [[highway interchange|interchange]] with [[Interstate 20|I-20]]/[[Interstate 59|I-59]]. North of downtown, [[Interstate 22|I-22]] branches off I-65 towards [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. From Birmingham, I-65 continues north, crossing the [[Tennessee River]] near [[Decatur, Alabama|Decatur]]. A few miles north of the river, it interchanges with [[Interstate 565|I-565]], a short [[spur route]] which provides access to Huntsville. It then continues northwards out of the Tennessee Valley to the state of [[Tennessee]], towards [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].\n\n=== Tennessee ===\n{{Main|Interstate 65 in Tennessee}}\n\n[[File:I-65 Southbound in Nashville.JPG|right|thumb|Interstate 65 southbound in [[Nashville]].]]\n\nI-65 enters Tennessee from the south near the town of [[Ardmore, Tennessee|Ardmore]] and passes through mostly rural territory for {{convert|65|mi|km}}. It then passes [[Lewisburg, Tennessee|Lewisburg]]. Then it passes close to [[Columbia, Tennessee|Columbia]] and crosses [[Saturn Parkway]], which brings travelers to the town of [[Spring Hill, Tennessee|Spring Hill]]. I-65 then continues on to reach [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|I-840]] and progresses until it intersects [[Tennessee State Route 96|SR&nbsp;96]] at [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]]. Then the highway goes through [[Brentwood, Tennessee|Brentwood]], [[Nashville]], [[Madison, Tennessee|Madison]], [[Goodlettsville, Tennessee|Goodlettsville]], [[White House, Tennessee|White House]], and then close to [[Portland, Tennessee|Portland]], it crosses into the state of [[Kentucky]] at milepost 120.5.\n\n=== Kentucky ===\n{{Main|Interstate 65 in Kentucky}}\n\n[[File:I-65 in Kentucky.jpg|left|thumb|Interstate 65 northbound at the former [[William H. Natcher Parkway]] (now [[Interstate 165 (Kentucky)|Interstate 165]]) in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]], 2007.]]\n\nI-65 enters the state {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} south of [[Franklin, Kentucky|Franklin]]. Throughout its length, it passes near [[Mammoth Cave National Park]], [[Bernheim Forest]], the [[National Corvette Museum]] and the [[Fort Knox Military Reservation]].\n\nThe first major intersection in the state is with [[Interstate 165 (Kentucky)|I-165]] at [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]]. I-65 has intersections with three of the [[List of Parkways and named roads in Kentucky|parkways]] in the state. The first major junction is with the [[Cumberland Parkway]] near Rocky Hill. At [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky|Elizabethtown]], it has two more parkway interchanges with the [[Wendell H. Ford Western Kentucky Parkway]] and the [[Martha Layne Collins Bluegrass Parkway]]. I-65 also has interchanges with [[Interstate 265|I-265]], [[Interstate 264 (Kentucky)|I-264]], [[Interstate 64|I-64]], and [[Interstate 71|I-71]].\n\nThe widest stretch of Interstate 65 in its entirety is in Louisville at [[Kentucky Route 1065]] (KY&nbsp;1065, Outer Loop), where the main line is 14 lanes wide. The highway crosses the [[Ohio River]] into Indiana on a toll bridge.  The southbound side is called the [[John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge]] (southbound) and the northbound side is called the [[Abraham Lincoln Bridge]]. The latter bridge opened in October 2016 as part of the [[Ohio River Bridges Project]]. Prior to the project, the John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge (completed in 1963) carried traffic in both directions. The project also included reconstruction of the [[Kennedy Interchange|I-65/I-64/I-71 convergence interchange]] just south of the Kennedy Bridge, plus renovating the older span to carry six lanes of southbound traffic. Additionally, a second six-lane cable-stayed bridge {{convert|12|mi|km}} upstream on the Ohio, the [[Lewis and Clark Bridge (Ohio River)|Lewis and Clark Bridge]], was built as part of the project, opening in December 2016 to complete the I-265 loop around Louisville.\n\nAt one time, the sixty-five-mile stretch of I-65 from Louisville to Elizabethtown was a toll road, called the [[Kentucky Turnpike]]. The bonds that financed the road have been paid off, and tolls are no longer collected. All signs of the former turnpike have been removed.  \n\nOn November 15, 2006, the stretch of I-65 from Bowling Green to Louisville was renamed the [[Abraham Lincoln]] Memorial Expressway.\n\nOn February 12, 2007, a bill passed the [[Kentucky Senate]] to rename I-65 in [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson County]] the [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]] Expressway.<ref>{{cite news |work= The Courier-Journal |location= Louisville, KY |date=February 13, 2007 |last=Gerth |first=Joseph |title=Senate OKs renaming I-65 for King}}</ref> Signs were posted July 25, 2007.<ref>{{cite news |work= The Courier-Journal |location= Louisville, KY |date= July 25, 2007 |last= Shafer |first= Sheldon S. |title= Mayor, Democrats back I-65 King plan |url= http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20070125/NEWS01/701250404/Mayor-Democrats-back-I-65-King-plan |accessdate=July 30, 2007}}</ref>\n\nOn July 15, 2007, Kentucky highway officials raised the speed limits on most Interstate and State Parkway highways to {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h}}. Prior to that, Kentucky was the only state along I-65 that had a maximum speed limit of {{convert|65|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\n=== Indiana ===\n{{Main|Interstate 65 in Indiana}}\n\n[[File:I-65 in Indianapolis.jpg|thumb|right|Interstate 65 just outside [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]]]\n\nI-65 enters Indiana at [[Jeffersonville, Indiana|Jeffersonville]] and [[Clarksville, Indiana|Clarksville]]. Miles 0\u20139 were rebuilt, widened and realigned from north of Sellersburg to the Ohio River during 2008\u201310, giving great traffic relief to the fast-growing Indiana suburbs of Louisville. Over 300,000 of the 1.5 million persons in Louisville's CMSA live in its Indiana counties.\n\nA section of I-65 in [[downtown Indianapolis, Indiana|downtown Indianapolis]] runs concurrent with [[Interstate 70|I-70]]. The junctions are often referred to as the \"North Split\" and the \"South Split\", forming a section of Interstate locally known as the \"Inner Loop\" or \"The Spaghetti Bowl\" due to the visual complexity of the intersecting ramps and overpasses.\n\nIn mid-March 2007, a {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=on}} section of I-70 from the North Split to [[Interstate 465|I-465]] east of downtown was restricted to automobiles only for the \"Super 70\" project, a massive rebuild and expansion of that freeway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/dot/div/projects/i70/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029041051/http://www.in.gov/dot/div/projects/i70/index.html|title=Super 70|archivedate=October 29, 2007|work=in.gov}}</ref> Trucks over {{convert|13|ST}} were forced to divert through I-65 if coming from the north and use the circular I-465 to the south to reconnect to I-70 eastbound. Westbound traffic from I-70 was required to loop north or south along I-465 to get to I-65 or I-70. The Super 70 project was completed in November 2007.\n\nIn the middle of 2003, the portion of I-65 that runs concurrently with I-70 was closed to all traffic due to the \"HyperFix\" project. During that time, a new concrete surface was installed and the overpasses were upgraded.\n\nIn 1999, the {{convert|25|mi|km|adj=on}} segment of I-65 between the two I-465 interchanges was renamed the [[Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds|Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds Highway]].\n\nNorth of [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]] near [[Brookston, Indiana|Brookston]], the road passes through the [[Meadow Lake Wind Farm]] for several miles, with the turbines and standards spaced out in order to avoid a collapse onto the highway. The [[Fowler Ridge Wind Farm]] is also visible on both sides of the highway.\n\nFrom its crossing into [[Lake County, Indiana|Lake County]], [[Indiana]], over the Kankakee River to its northern terminus, the highway is known as the [[Kazimierz Pu\u0142aski|Casimir Pulaski]] Memorial Highway.\n\nPrior to 2004, the northern terminus of Interstate 65 was only {{convert|1/8|mi|km}} north of [[Interstate 90|I-90]] (Indiana Toll Road). Traffic going from I-90 to I-65 had to stop at a traffic signal to make a left turn. Traffic from I-65 to I-90 bypassed the traffic signal via an isolated right-turn lane. In 2004, the interchange was fully grade-separated, so it is now one interchange involving I-65, I-90, US&nbsp;12, and US&nbsp;20, thereby eliminating a [[Interstate Gaps#Connection gaps|connection gap]] in the [[Interstate Highway system]].\n\n==Junction list==\n;Alabama\n: {{jct|country=USA|I|10}} in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]]\n: {{jct|country=USA|US|90}} in Mobile\n: {{jct|country=USA|US|98}} in Mobile\n: {{jct|country=USA|US|45}} in [[Prichard, Alabama|Prichard]]\n: {{jct|state=AL|I|165}} in Prichard\n: {{jct|country=USA|US|43}} north-northeast of [[Satsuma, Alabama|Satsuma]]\n: {{jct|country=USA|US|84}} west-southwest of [[Evergreen, Conecuh County, Alabama|Evergreen]]\n: {{jct|country=USA|US|31}} on the [[Hope Hull, Alabama|Hope Hull]]\u2013[[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] line\n: {{jct|country=USA|US|80}} in Montgomery.

It was produced by [[Rich Costey]] and released on 8 July 2016. Ellipsis entered the UK charts at number one, making it Biffy Clyro's second number one album (after 2013's ''[[Opposites (album)|Opposites]]'').\n\n== Background ==\nConfirmation that the band was working on a new record came in early 2014, with frontman [[Simon Neil]] telling Radio X in an interview that they had written \"about 14 songs so far\", stating that the album was projected for possible release by the end of 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/biffy-clyro/77055 |title=Biffy Clyro reveal new album plans |work=[[NME]] |accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref> He also commented saying that the band was due to take a break from public involvement to bring themselves away from the spotlight following touring in support of their 2013 album, ''[[Opposites (album)|Opposites]]''.\n\nThe band took 2015 as a \"year off\" from public appearances, as they did not want fans to tire of seeing them,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/biffy-clyro/81450|title=Biffy Clyro call 2015 their 'year off' |work=NME |accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref> although they did play a one off show as the headline act in [[Edinburgh's Hogmanay]] Concert in the Gardens, where they debuted a new song \"On a Bang\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/on-a-bang-the-first-taste-of-biffy-clyros-next-album-is-an-uncompromising-direct-and-immediate-examp|title='On A Bang' - The First Taste Of Biffy Clyro's Next Album \u2013 Is An Uncompromising, Direct And Immediate Example Of The Trio At Their Heaviest |work=NME |accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref> The band recorded the majority of the album in [[Burbank, California]] following drummer [[Ben Johnston (Scottish musician)|Ben Johnston]]'s claims that they would visit somewhere \"exotic\" to record it as a change of pace from their home country of Scotland. The band took a similar approach in 2012 while working on the previous record, travelling to [[West Los Angeles|West Los Angeles, California]] to record the majority of the album.\n\nIn January 2016, the band discussed the album with ''[[NME]]'', calling it the \"best record we've made\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/biffy-clyro/90943 |title=Biffy Clyro talk new album: 'It's the best record we've made, it's pint-in-the-face rock' |work=NME |accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref> and revealing [[John Waters]] and hip-hop artist [[A$AP Rocky]] as influences of the sound of the new music.\n\nIn the days leading up to 21 March 2016, the band's official [[YouTube]] channel released snippets from the album's first single, \"[[Wolves of Winter]]\", announcing the date of the single's release. On 21 March, the videos were removed, and replaced by a 1:30 long preview of the song announcing the name and release date of the album.<ref>{{Citation|author=Biffy Clyro |title=Biffy Clyro - Wolves Of Winter (Preview) |date=21 March 2016 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPNjcKwhExI |via=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref> The song was first played in full on 21 March during [[Zane Lowe]]'s Hottest Record on [[Beats 1]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/biffy-clyro/92438 |title=Biffy Clyro announce new album 'Ellipsis' - hear new song 'Wolves Of Winter' |work=NME |accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref> and again later during [[Annie Mac]]'s World's Hottest Record on [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]].

It was produced by [[Rich Costey]] and released on 8 July 2016. Ellipsis entered the UK charts at number one, making it Biffy Clyro's second number one album (after 2013's ''[[Opposites (album)|Opposites]]'').\n\n== Background ==\nConfirmation that the band was working on a new record came in early 2014, with frontman [[Simon Neil]] telling Radio X in an interview that they had written \"about 14 songs so far\", stating that the album was projected for possible release by the end of 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/biffy-clyro/77055 |title=Biffy Clyro reveal new album plans |work=[[NME]] |accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref> He also commented saying that the band was due to take a break from public involvement to bring themselves away from the spotlight following touring in support of their 2013 album, ''[[Opposites (album)|Opposites]]''.\n\nThe band took 2015 as a \"year off\" from public appearances, as they did not want fans to tire of seeing them,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/biffy-clyro/81450|title=Biffy Clyro call 2015 their 'year off' |work=NME |accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref> although they did play a one off show as the headline act in [[Edinburgh's Hogmanay]] Concert in the Gardens, where they debuted a new song \"On a Bang\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/on-a-bang-the-first-taste-of-biffy-clyros-next-album-is-an-uncompromising-direct-and-immediate-examp|title='On A Bang' - The First Taste Of Biffy Clyro's Next Album \u2013 Is An Uncompromising, Direct And Immediate Example Of The Trio At Their Heaviest |work=NME |accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref> The band recorded the majority of the album in [[Burbank, California]] following drummer [[Ben Johnston (Scottish musician)|Ben Johnston]]'s claims that they would visit somewhere \"exotic\" to record it as a change of pace from their home country of Scotland. The band took a similar approach in 2012 while working on the previous record, travelling to [[West Los Angeles|West Los Angeles, California]] to record the majority of the album.\n\nIn January 2016, the band discussed the album with ''[[NME]]'', calling it the \"best record we've made\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/biffy-clyro/90943 |title=Biffy Clyro talk new album: 'It's the best record we've made, it's pint-in-the-face rock' |work=NME |accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref> and revealing [[John Waters]] and hip-hop artist [[A$AP Rocky]] as influences of the sound of the new music.\n\nIn the days leading up to 21 March 2016, the band's official [[YouTube]] channel released snippets from the album's first single, \"[[Wolves of Winter]]\", announcing the date of the single's release. On 21 March, the videos were removed, and replaced by a 1:30 long preview of the song announcing the name and release date of the album.<ref>{{Citation|author=Biffy Clyro |title=Biffy Clyro - Wolves Of Winter (Preview) |date=21 March 2016 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPNjcKwhExI |via=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref> The song was first played in full on 21 March during [[Zane Lowe]]'s Hottest Record on [[Beats 1]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/biffy-clyro/92438 |title=Biffy Clyro announce new album 'Ellipsis' - hear new song 'Wolves Of Winter' |work=NME |accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref> and again later during [[Annie Mac]]'s World's Hottest Record on [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]].
