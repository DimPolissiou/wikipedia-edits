[[Applications of virtual reality]] can include entertainment (i.e. [[video game]]s) and educational purposes (i.e. medical or military training). Other, distinct types of VR style technology include [[augmented reality]] and [[mixed reality]].\n\nCurrently standard virtual reality systems use either [[virtual reality headset]]s or multi-projected environments to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a [[head-mounted display]] with a small screen in front of the eyes, but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens. Virtual reality typically incorporates [[Auditory feedback|auditory]] and [[video feedback]], but may also allow other types of sensory and force feedback through [[haptic technology]].\n\n==Etymology==\n\"[[Virtual (philosophy)|Virtual]]\" has had the meaning of \"being something in essence or effect, though not actually or in fact\" since the mid-1400s.<ref name=\"etymonline.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=virtual|title=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref> The term \"virtual\" has been used in the computer sense of \"not [[Reality|physically existing]] but made to appear by [[software]]\" since 1959.<ref name=\"etymonline.com\" />\n\nIn 1938, French avant-garde playwright [[Antonin Artaud]] described the illusory nature of characters and objects in the [[theatre]] as [[:fr:R\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle|\"la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle\"]] in a collection of essays, ''Le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre et son double''. The English translation of this book, published in 1958 as ''[[The Theater and its Double]]'',<ref name=\"Artaud 1958\">[[Antonin Artaud]], ''The Theatre and its Double'' Trans. Mary Caroline Richards. (New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1958).</ref> is the earliest published use of the term \"virtual reality\". The term \"[[artificial reality]]\", coined by [[Myron W. Krueger|Myron Krueger]], has been in use since the 1970s. The term \"virtual reality\" was first used in a science fiction context in ''The Judas Mandala'', a 1982 novel by [[Damien Broderick]].\n\n==Forms and methods==\n{{Further|Immersion (virtual reality)|Reality\u2013virtuality continuum}}\n\nOne method by which virtual reality can be realized is [[simulation]]-based virtual reality. Driving simulators, for example, give the driver on board the impression of actually driving an actual vehicle by predicting vehicular motion caused by driver input and feeding back corresponding visual, motion and audio cues to the driver.\n\nWith [[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatar image]]-based virtual reality, people can join the virtual environment in the form of real video as well as an avatar. One can participate in the [[3D computer graphics|3D]] distributed virtual environment as form of either a conventional avatar or a real video. A user can select own type of participation based on the system capability.\n\nIn projector-based virtual reality, modeling of the real environment plays a vital role in various virtual reality applications, such as robot navigation, construction modeling, and airplane simulation. Image-based virtual reality systems have been gaining popularity in [[computer graphics]] and [[computer vision]] communities. In generating realistic models, it is essential to accurately register acquired 3D data; usually, a camera is used for modeling small [[Object (image processing)|objects]] at a short distance.\n\nDesktop-based virtual reality involves displaying a 3D [[virtual world]] on a regular [[Visual display unit|desktop display]] without use of any specialized [[positional tracking]] equipment. Many modern [[First-person (gaming)|first-person]] video games can be used as an example, using various triggers, responsive characters, and other such interactive devices to make the user feel as though they are in a virtual world. A common criticism of this form of immersion is that there is no sense of [[peripheral vision]], limiting the user's ability to know what is happening around them.\n\n[[File:Engineers train in virtual environment to prepare for real missions 150616-Z-YF431-084.jpg|thumb|A [[Missouri National Guard]]sman looks into a VR training [[head-mounted display]] at [[Fort Leonard Wood]] in 2015]]\n\nA [[head-mounted display]] (HMD) more fully immerses the user in a virtual world. A [[virtual reality headset]] typically includes two small high resolution [[OLED]] or [[LCD]] monitors which provide separate images for each eye for [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] graphics rendering a 3D virtual world, a [[3D audio effect|binaural audio]] system, positional and rotational real-time [[Motion capture|head tracking]] for six degrees of movement. Options include [[Motion controller|motion controls]] with [[Haptic technology|haptic feedback]] for physically interacting within the virtual world in an intuitive way with little to no abstraction and an [[omnidirectional treadmill]] for more freedom of physical movement allowing the user to perform locomotive motion in any direction.\n\n[[Augmented reality]] (AR) is a type of virtual reality technology that blends what the user sees in their real surroundings with digital content generated by computer software. The additional software-generated images with the virtual scene typically enhance how the real surroundings look in some way. AR systems layer virtual information over a camera [[live feed]] into a headset or [[smartglasses]] or through a [[mobile device]] giving the user the ability to view three-dimensional images.\n\n[[Mixed reality]] (MR) is the merging of the real world and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time.\n\nA [[cyberspace]] is a networked virtual reality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/cyberspace|title=the definition of cyberspace}}</ref>\n\n[[Simulated reality]] is a hypothetical virtual reality as truly immersive as the [[Real life|actual reality]], enabling an advanced [[lifelike experience]] or even [[Virternity|virtual eternity]]. It is most likely to be produced using a [[brain\u2013computer interface]] and [[quantum computer|quantum computing]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:View-Master with Reel.jpg|thumb|[[View-Master]], a stereoscopic visual simulator, was introduced in 1939|alt=]]\n\nThe exact origins of virtual reality are disputed, partly because of how difficult it has been to formulate a definition for the concept of an alternative existence.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.theverge.com/a/virtual-reality/intro | title=Seeing is Believing: The State of Virtual Reality | author=Matthew Schnipper | publisher= The Verge | access-date= 7 March 2017}}</ref> The development of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in Renaissance Europe created convincing depictions of spaces that did not exist, in what has been referred to as the \"multiplying of artificial worlds\".<ref name=\"Baltru\u0161aitis 1977\">{{cite book |last1=Baltru\u0161aitis |first1=Jurgis |last2=Strachan |first2=W.J. |title=Anamorphic art |date=1977 |publisher=Harry N.

Antonin Artaud took the view that illusion was not distinct from reality, advocating that spectators at a play should suspend disbelief and regard the drama on stage as reality.<ref name=\"Artaud 1958\" /> The first references to the more modern concept of virtual reality came from [[science fiction]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[Morton Heilig]] wrote in the 1950s of an \"Experience Theatre\" that could encompass all the senses in an effective manner, thus drawing the viewer into the onscreen activity. He built a prototype of his vision dubbed the [[Sensorama]] in 1962, along with five short films to be displayed in it while engaging multiple senses (sight, sound, smell, and touch). Predating digital computing, the Sensorama was a [[Machine|mechanical device]]. Heilig also developed what he referred to as the \"Telesphere Mask\" (patented in 1960). The patent application described the device as \"a telescopic television apparatus for individual use...The spectator is given a complete sensation of reality, i.e. moving three dimensional images which may be in colour, with 100% peripheral vision, binaural sound, scents and air breezes.\"<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/forgotten-genius-the-man-who-made-a-working-vr-machine-in-1957-1318253/2 | title=Forgotten genius: the man who made a working VR machine in 1957 | author=Holly Brockwell | date=3 April 2016 | publisher=Tech Radar | access-date=7 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, [[Ivan Sutherland]], with the help of his students including [[Bob Sproull]], created what was widely considered to be the first head-mounted display system for use in immersive simulation applications. It was primitive both in terms of [[user interface]] and visual realism, and the HMD to be worn by the user was so heavy that it had to be suspended from the ceiling. The graphics comprising the virtual environment were simple [[wire-frame model]] rooms. The formidable appearance of the device inspired its name, [[The Sword of Damocles (virtual reality)|The Sword of Damocles]].\n\n==== 1970\u20131990 ====\nThe virtual reality industry mainly provided VR devices for medical, flight simulation, automobile industry design, and military training purposes from 1970 to 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.History.html|title=National Center for Supercomputing Applications: History|publisher=The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821054144/http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.History.html|archivedate=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nDavid Em became the first artist to produce navigable virtual worlds at [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) from 1977 to 1984.<ref name=\"Creative Computing March 1982\">{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Ted|title=Report on Siggraph '81|journal=Creative Computing|date=March 1982}}</ref> The [[Aspen Movie Map]], a crude [[virtual tour]] in which users could wander the streets of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] in one of the three modes (summer, winter, and [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]]), was created at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1978.\n\n[[File:Virtual Reality Headset Prototype.jpg|thumb|[[Ames Research Center|NASA Ames]]'s 1985 VIEW headset]]\n\nIn 1979, [[Eric Howlett]] developed the Large Expanse, Extra Perspective (LEEP) optical system. The combined system created a stereoscopic image with a field of view wide enough to create a convincing sense of space. The users of the system have been impressed by the sensation of depth ([[field of view]]) in the scene and the corresponding realism. The original LEEP system was redesigned for NASA's [[Ames Research Center]] in 1985 for their first virtual reality installation, the VIEW (Virtual Interactive Environment Workstation) by [[Scott Fisher (technologist)|Scott Fisher]].

Lanier had founded the company [[VPL Research]] in 1985. VPL Research has developed several VR devices like the [[DataGlove]], the EyePhone, and the AudioSphere. VPL licensed the DataGlove technology to [[Mattel]], which used it to make the [[Power Glove]], an early affordable VR device.\n\n[[Atari]] founded a research lab for virtual reality in 1982, but the lab was closed after two years due to the Atari Shock ([[North American video game crash of 1983]]).

[[Applications of virtual reality]] can include entertainment (i.e. [[video game]]s) and educational purposes (i.e. medical or military training). Other, distinct types of VR style technology include [[augmented reality]] and [[mixed reality]].\n\nCurrently standard virtual reality systems use either [[virtual reality headset]]s or multi-projected environments to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a [[head-mounted display]] with a small screen in front of the eyes, but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens. Virtual reality typically incorporates [[Auditory feedback|auditory]] and [[video feedback]], but may also allow other types of sensory and force feedback through [[haptic technology]].\n\n==Etymology==\n\"[[Virtual (philosophy)|Virtual]]\" has had the meaning of \"being something in essence or effect, though not actually or in fact\" since the mid-1400s.<ref name=\"etymonline.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=virtual|title=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref> The term \"virtual\" has been used in the computer sense of \"not [[Reality|physically existing]] but made to appear by [[software]]\" since 1959.<ref name=\"etymonline.com\" />\n\nIn 1938, French avant-garde playwright [[Antonin Artaud]] described the illusory nature of characters and objects in the [[theatre]] as [[:fr:R\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle|\"la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle\"]] in a collection of essays, ''Le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre et son double''. The English translation of this book, published in 1958 as ''[[The Theater and its Double]]'',<ref name=\"Artaud 1958\">[[Antonin Artaud]], ''The Theatre and its Double'' Trans. Mary Caroline Richards. (New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1958).</ref> is the earliest published use of the term \"virtual reality\". The term \"[[artificial reality]]\", coined by [[Myron W. Krueger|Myron Krueger]], has been in use since the 1970s. The term \"virtual reality\" was first used in a science fiction context in ''The Judas Mandala'', a 1982 novel by [[Damien Broderick]].\n\n==Forms and methods==\n{{Further|Immersion (virtual reality)|Reality\u2013virtuality continuum}}\n\nOne method by which virtual reality can be realized is [[simulation]]-based virtual reality. Driving simulators, for example, give the driver on board the impression of actually driving an actual vehicle by predicting vehicular motion caused by driver input and feeding back corresponding visual, motion and audio cues to the driver.\n\nWith [[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatar image]]-based virtual reality, people can join the virtual environment in the form of real video as well as an avatar. One can participate in the [[3D computer graphics|3D]] distributed virtual environment as form of either a conventional avatar or a real video. A user can select own type of participation based on the system capability.\n\nIn projector-based virtual reality, modeling of the real environment plays a vital role in various virtual reality applications, such as robot navigation, construction modeling, and airplane simulation. Image-based virtual reality systems have been gaining popularity in [[computer graphics]] and [[computer vision]] communities. In generating realistic models, it is essential to accurately register acquired 3D data; usually, a camera is used for modeling small [[Object (image processing)|objects]] at a short distance.\n\nDesktop-based virtual reality involves displaying a 3D [[virtual world]] on a regular [[Visual display unit|desktop display]] without use of any specialized [[positional tracking]] equipment. Many modern [[First-person (gaming)|first-person]] video games can be used as an example, using various triggers, responsive characters, and other such interactive devices to make the user feel as though they are in a virtual world. A common criticism of this form of immersion is that there is no sense of [[peripheral vision]], limiting the user's ability to know what is happening around them.\n\n[[File:Engineers train in virtual environment to prepare for real missions 150616-Z-YF431-084.jpg|thumb|A [[Missouri National Guard]]sman looks into a VR training [[head-mounted display]] at [[Fort Leonard Wood]] in 2015]]\n\nA [[head-mounted display]] (HMD) more fully immerses the user in a virtual world. A [[virtual reality headset]] typically includes two small high resolution [[OLED]] or [[LCD]] monitors which provide separate images for each eye for [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] graphics rendering a 3D virtual world, a [[3D audio effect|binaural audio]] system, positional and rotational real-time [[Motion capture|head tracking]] for six degrees of movement. Options include [[Motion controller|motion controls]] with [[Haptic technology|haptic feedback]] for physically interacting within the virtual world in an intuitive way with little to no abstraction and an [[omnidirectional treadmill]] for more freedom of physical movement allowing the user to perform locomotive motion in any direction.\n\n[[Augmented reality]] (AR) is a type of virtual reality technology that blends what the user sees in their real surroundings with digital content generated by computer software. The additional software-generated images with the virtual scene typically enhance how the real surroundings look in some way. AR systems layer virtual information over a camera [[live feed]] into a headset or [[smartglasses]] or through a [[mobile device]] giving the user the ability to view three-dimensional images.\n\n[[Mixed reality]] (MR) is the merging of the real world and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time.\n\nA [[cyberspace]] is a networked virtual reality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/cyberspace|title=the definition of cyberspace}}</ref>\n\n[[Simulated reality]] is a hypothetical virtual reality as truly immersive as the [[Real life|actual reality]], enabling an advanced [[lifelike experience]] or even [[Virternity|virtual eternity]]. It is most likely to be produced using a [[brain\u2013computer interface]] and [[quantum computer|quantum computing]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:View-Master with Reel.jpg|thumb|[[View-Master]], a stereoscopic visual simulator, was introduced in 1939|alt=]]\n\nThe exact origins of virtual reality are disputed, partly because of how difficult it has been to formulate a definition for the concept of an alternative existence.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.theverge.com/a/virtual-reality/intro | title=Seeing is Believing: The State of Virtual Reality | author=Matthew Schnipper | publisher= The Verge | access-date= 7 March 2017}}</ref> The development of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in Renaissance Europe created convincing depictions of spaces that did not exist, in what has been referred to as the \"multiplying of artificial worlds\".<ref name=\"Baltru\u0161aitis 1977\">{{cite book |last1=Baltru\u0161aitis |first1=Jurgis |last2=Strachan |first2=W.J. |title=Anamorphic art |date=1977 |publisher=Harry N.

Antonin Artaud took the view that illusion was not distinct from reality, advocating that spectators at a play should suspend disbelief and regard the drama on stage as reality.<ref name=\"Artaud 1958\" /> The first references to the more modern concept of virtual reality came from [[science fiction]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[Morton Heilig]] wrote in the 1950s of an \"Experience Theatre\" that could encompass all the senses in an effective manner, thus drawing the viewer into the onscreen activity. He built a prototype of his vision dubbed the [[Sensorama]] in 1962, along with five short films to be displayed in it while engaging multiple senses (sight, sound, smell, and touch). Predating digital computing, the Sensorama was a [[Machine|mechanical device]]. Heilig also developed what he referred to as the \"Telesphere Mask\" (patented in 1960). The patent application described the device as \"a telescopic television apparatus for individual use...The spectator is given a complete sensation of reality, i.e. moving three dimensional images which may be in colour, with 100% peripheral vision, binaural sound, scents and air breezes.\"<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/forgotten-genius-the-man-who-made-a-working-vr-machine-in-1957-1318253/2 | title=Forgotten genius: the man who made a working VR machine in 1957 | author=Holly Brockwell | date=3 April 2016 | publisher=Tech Radar | access-date=7 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, [[Ivan Sutherland]], with the help of his students including [[Bob Sproull]], created what was widely considered to be the first head-mounted display system for use in immersive simulation applications. It was primitive both in terms of [[user interface]] and visual realism, and the HMD to be worn by the user was so heavy that it had to be suspended from the ceiling. The graphics comprising the virtual environment were simple [[wire-frame model]] rooms. The formidable appearance of the device inspired its name, [[The Sword of Damocles (virtual reality)|The Sword of Damocles]].\n\n==== 1970\u20131990 ====\nThe virtual reality industry mainly provided VR devices for medical, flight simulation, automobile industry design, and military training purposes from 1970 to 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.History.html|title=National Center for Supercomputing Applications: History|publisher=The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821054144/http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.History.html|archivedate=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nDavid Em became the first artist to produce navigable virtual worlds at [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) from 1977 to 1984.<ref name=\"Creative Computing March 1982\">{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Ted|title=Report on Siggraph '81|journal=Creative Computing|date=March 1982}}</ref> The [[Aspen Movie Map]], a crude [[virtual tour]] in which users could wander the streets of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] in one of the three modes (summer, winter, and [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]]), was created at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1978.\n\n[[File:Virtual Reality Headset Prototype.jpg|thumb|[[Ames Research Center|NASA Ames]]'s 1985 VIEW headset]]\n\nIn 1979, [[Eric Howlett]] developed the Large Expanse, Extra Perspective (LEEP) optical system. The combined system created a stereoscopic image with a field of view wide enough to create a convincing sense of space. The users of the system have been impressed by the sensation of depth ([[field of view]]) in the scene and the corresponding realism. The original LEEP system was redesigned for NASA's [[Ames Research Center]] in 1985 for their first virtual reality installation, the VIEW (Virtual Interactive Environment Workstation) by [[Scott Fisher (technologist)|Scott Fisher]]. The LEEP system provides the basis for most of the modern virtual reality headsets.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Wayne|title=\"Virtual Reality and Artificial Environments\", A Critical History of Computer Graphics and Animation|date=December 2005|chapter=Section 17}}</ref>\n\n[[File:VPL DataSuit 1.jpg|upright|thumb|left|A [[VPL Research]] DataSuit, a full-body outfit with sensors for measuring the movement of arms, legs, and trunk.

Lanier had founded the company [[VPL Research]] in 1985. VPL Research has developed several VR devices like the [[DataGlove]], the EyePhone, and the AudioSphere.

This gold was, in the vast majority, re-exported - mainly to customers who took delivery in international waters off [[India]]. The import of gold to India had been banned and so the trade was characterised as smuggling, although Dubai's merchants were quick to point out that they were making legal deliveries of gold and that it was up to the customer where they took it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Gold smuggling boosts Dubai economy|last=Thomas|first=Anthony|date=3 March 1969|work=The Times|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, more gold was shipped from London to Dubai than almost anywhere else in the world (Only France and Switzerland took more), at 4 million ounces. Dubai also took delivery of over $15 million-worth of watches and over 5 million ounces of silver. The 1967 price of gold was $35 an ounce but its market price in India was $68 an ounce - a healthy markup. Estimates at the time put the volume of gold imports from Dubai to India at something like 75% of the total market.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Trucial States|last=Donald.|first=Hawley|date=1970|publisher=Allen & Unwin|isbn=978-0049530058|location=London|pages=204|oclc=152680}}</ref>\n\n===Oil era===\n[[File:Dubai Water Canal Business Bay.jpg|thumb|View of [[Business Bay]]]]\nAfter years of exploration following large finds in neighbouring [[Abu Dhabi]], oil was eventually discovered in territorial waters off Dubai in 1966, albeit in far smaller quantities. The first field was named 'Fateh' or 'good fortune'. This led to an acceleration of Sheikh Rashid's infrastructure development plans and a construction boom that brought a massive influx of foreign workers, mainly Asians and Middle easterners.

Oil revenue, flowing from 1969 onwards supported a period of growth with Sheikh Rashid embarking on a policy of building infrastructure and a diversified trading economy before the emirate's limited reserves were depleted. Oil accounted for 24% of GDP in 1990, but had reduced to 7% of GDP by 2004.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nCritically, one of the first major projects Sheikh Rashid embarked upon when oil revenue started to flow was the construction of [[Port Rashid]], a deep water free port constructed by British company [[Halcrow Group|Halcrow]]. Originally intended to be a four-berth port, it was extended to sixteen berths as construction was ongoing. The project was an outstanding success, with shipping queuing to access the new facilities. The port was inaugurated on 5 October 1972, although its berths were each pressed into use as soon as they had been built. Port Rashid was to be further expanded in 1975 to add a further 35 berths before the larger port of Jebel Ali was constructed.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nPort Rashid was the first of a swath of projects designed to create a modern trading infrastructure, including roads, bridges, schools and hospitals.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Father of Dubai|last = Wilson|first = Graeme|publisher = Media Prima|year = 1999|isbn = 9789948856450|location = UAE|page = 151}}</ref>\n\n===Reaching the UAE's Act of Union===\n[[File:Adi with the three rulers of Dubai.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adi Bitar]] in a meeting with Sheiks [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum|Rashid Al Maktoum]], [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Mohammad Al Maktoum]] and [[Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Maktoum Al Maktoum]] in Dubai, 1968]]\nDubai and the other '[[Trucial States]]' had long been a British [[protectorate]] where the British government took care of foreign policy and defence, as well as arbitrating between the rulers of the Eastern Gulf, the result of a treaty signed in 1892, the 'Exclusive Agreement'.

The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light (in fact, this field can be identified ''as'' light) and interacts with charges and currents. Its [[electromagnetic field tensor|quantum counterpart]] is one of the four [[fundamental force]]s of nature (the others are [[gravitation]], [[weak interaction]] and [[strong interaction]].)\n\nThe field can be viewed as the combination of an [[electric field]] and a [[magnetic field]]. The electric field is produced by stationary charges, and the magnetic field by moving charges (currents); these two are often described as the sources of the field. The way in which charges and currents interact with the electromagnetic field is described by [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Lorentz force law]].<ref>Purcell. p5-11;p61;p277-296</ref> The force created by the electric field is much stronger than the force created by the magnetic field.<ref>Purcell, p235: We then calculate the electric field due to a charge moving with constant velocity; it does not equal the spherically symmetric Coulomb field.</ref>\n\nFrom a [[Classical physics|classical]] perspective in the [[history of electromagnetism]], the electromagnetic field can be regarded as a smooth, continuous [[field (physics)|field]], propagated in a wavelike manner. By contrast, from the perspective of [[quantum field theory]], this field is seen as quantized; meaning that the free quantum field (i.e. non-interacting field) can be expressed as the Fourier sum of [[creation and annihilation operators]] in energy-momentum space while the effects of the interacting quantum field may be analyzed in [[perturbation theory]] via the [[S-matrix]] with the aid of a whole host of mathematical technologies such as the [[Dyson series]], [[Wick's theorem]], [[Correlation function (quantum field theory)|correlation functions]], [[time-evolution operator]]s, [[Feynman diagrams]] etc. Note that the quantized field is still spatially continuous; its ''energy states'' however are discrete (the field's energy states must not be confused with its ''energy values'', which are continuous; the quantum field's [[creation operators]] create multiple ''discrete'' states of energy called [[photons]].)\n\n==Structure==\nThe electromagnetic field may be viewed in two distinct ways: a continuous structure or a discrete structure.\n\n===Continuous structure===\nClassically, electric and magnetic fields are thought of as being produced by smooth motions of charged objects. For example, oscillating charges produce variations in electric and magnetic fields that may be viewed in a 'smooth', continuous, wavelike fashion. In this case, energy is viewed as being transferred continuously through the electromagnetic field between any two locations. For instance, the metal atoms in a [[radio]] [[transmitter]] appear to transfer energy continuously. This view is useful to a certain extent (radiation of low frequency), but problems are found at high frequencies (see [[ultraviolet catastrophe]]).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Electrodynamics|last=Griffiths|first=David J.|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1999|isbn=0-13-805326-X|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458|pages=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontoel00grif_0/page/364 364]|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoel00grif_0/page/364}}</ref>\n\n===Discrete structure===\nThe electromagnetic field may be thought of in a more 'coarse' way. Experiments reveal that in some circumstances electromagnetic energy transfer is better described as being carried in the form of packets called [[quantum|quanta]] (in this case, [[photon]]s) with a fixed [[frequency]]. Planck's relation links the [[photon energy]] ''E'' of a photon to its frequency f through the equation:<ref>{{cite book|author=Spencer, James N.|display-authors=etal|title=Chemistry: Structure and Dynamics|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2010|isbn=9780470587119|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FRfcVwFr17IC&pg=PA78}}</ref>\n\n:<math>E= \\, h f</math>\n\nwhere ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]], and ''f'' is the frequency of the photon . Although modern quantum optics tells us that there also is a semi-classical explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]]\u2014the emission of electrons from metallic surfaces subjected to [[electromagnetic radiation]]\u2014the photon was historically (although not strictly necessarily) used to explain certain observations. It is found that increasing the intensity of the incident radiation (so long as one remains in the linear regime) increases only the number of electrons ejected, and has almost no effect on the energy distribution of their ejection. Only the frequency of the radiation is relevant to the energy of the ejected electrons.\n\nThis [[quantum]] picture of the electromagnetic field (which treats it as analogous to [[harmonic oscillators]]) has proven very successful, giving rise to [[quantum electrodynamics]], a [[quantum field theory]] describing the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with charged matter. It also gives rise to [[quantum optics]], which is different from quantum electrodynamics in that the matter itself is modelled using [[quantum mechanics]] rather than quantum field theory.\n\n==Dynamics==\nIn the past, [[Electrical charge|electrically charged]] objects were thought to produce two different, unrelated types of field associated with their charge property. An [[electric field]] is produced when the charge is stationary with respect to an observer measuring the properties of the charge, and a [[magnetic field]] as well as an electric field is produced when the charge moves, creating an electric current with respect to this observer. Over time, it was realized that the electric and magnetic fields are better thought of as two parts of a greater whole\u2014the electromagnetic field. Until 1820, when the Danish physicist [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted|H. C. \u00d8rsted]] showed the effect of electric current on a compass needle, electricity and magnetism had been viewed as unrelated phenomena.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stauffer |first1=Robert C. |title=Speculation and experiment in the background of Oersted's discovery of electromagnetism |journal=Isis |date=1957 |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=33\u201350 |jstor=226900 |doi=10.1086/348537}}</ref> In 1831, [[Michael Faraday]] made the seminal observation that time-varying magnetic fields could induce electric currents and then, in 1864, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] published his famous paper ''[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]''.<ref>Maxwell 1864 5, page 499; also [[David J. Griffiths]] (1999), Introduction to electrodynamics, third Edition, ed. Prentice Hall, pp. 559-562\"(as quoted in Gabriela, 2009)</ref>\n\nOnce this electromagnetic field has been produced from a given charge distribution, other charged or magnetised objects in this field may experience a force. If these other charges and currents are comparable in size to the sources producing the above electromagnetic field, then a new net electromagnetic field will be produced. Thus, the electromagnetic field may be viewed as a dynamic entity that causes other charges and currents to move, and which is also affected by them. These interactions are described by [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Lorentz Force Law|Lorentz force law]]. This discussion ignores the [[radiation reaction force]].\n\n==Feedback loop==\nThe behavior of the electromagnetic field can be divided into four different parts of a loop:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Electrodynamics|last=Griffith|first=David J.|publisher=Prentice|year=1999|isbn=0-13-805326-X|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, 07458|pages=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontoel00grif_0/page/321 321, Chapter 7.3, Maxwell's Equations]|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoel00grif_0/page/321}}</ref>\n*the electric and magnetic fields are generated by moving electric charges,\n*the electric and magnetic fields interact with each other,\n*the electric and magnetic fields produce forces on electric charges,\n*the electric charges move in space.\n\nA common misunderstanding is that (a) the quanta of the fields act in the same manner as (b) the charged particles, such as electrons, that generate the fields. In our everyday world, electrons travel slowly through conductors with a [[drift velocity]] of a fraction of a centimeter (or inch) per second and through a [[vacuum tube]] at speeds of around 1 thousand km/s,<ref name=\"Hoag 2009\">{{cite web |last1=Hoag |first1=JB |title=Velocity of Electrons in a Vacuum Tube |url=http://www.vias.org/basicradio/basic_radio_02_03.html |website=Basic Radio |accessdate=22 June 2019 |date=2009}}</ref> but fields propagate at the [[speed of light]], approximately 300 thousand kilometers (or 186 thousand miles) a second. The speed ratio between charged particles in a conductor and field quanta is on the order of one to a million. [[Maxwell's equations]] relate (a) the presence and movement of charged particles with (b) the generation of fields. Those fields can then affect the force on, and can then move other slowly moving charged particles. Charged particles can move at relativistic speeds nearing field propagation speeds, but, as [[Einstein]] showed{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}, this requires enormous field energies, which are not present in our everyday experiences with electricity, magnetism, matter, and time and space.\n\nThe feedback loop can be summarized in a list, including phenomena belonging to each part of the loop:{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n*charged particles generate electric and magnetic fields\n*the fields interact with each other\n**changing electric field acts like a current, generating 'vortex' of magnetic field\n**[[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday induction]]: changing magnetic field induces (negative) vortex of electric field\n**[[Lenz's law]]: negative feedback loop between electric and magnetic fields\n*fields act upon particles\n**Lorentz force: force due to electromagnetic field\n***electric force: same direction as electric field\n***magnetic force: perpendicular both to magnetic field and to velocity of charge\n*particles move\n**current is movement of particles\n*particles generate more electric and magnetic fields; cycle repeats\n\n==Mathematical description==\n{{main|Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field}}\nThere are different mathematical ways of representing the electromagnetic field. The first one views the electric and magnetic fields as three-dimensional [[vector field]]s. These vector fields each have a value defined at every point of space and time and are thus often regarded as functions of the space and time coordinates. As such, they are often written as '''E'''(x, y, z, t) ([[electric field]]) and '''B'''(x, y, z, t) ([[magnetic field]]).\n\nIf only the electric field ('''E''') is non-zero, and is constant in time, the field is said to be an [[electrostatic field]]. Similarly, if only the magnetic field ('''B''') is non-zero and is constant in time, the field is said to be a [[magnetostatic field]]. However, if either the electric or magnetic field has a time-dependence, then both fields must be considered together as a coupled electromagnetic field using [[Maxwell's equations]].<ref>Electromagnetic Fields (2nd Edition), Roald K. Wangsness, Wiley, 1986. {{ISBN|0-471-81186-6}} (intermediate level textbook)</ref>\n\nWith the advent of [[special relativity]], physical laws became susceptible to the formalism of [[tensor]]s. Maxwell's equations can be written in tensor form, generally viewed by physicists as a more elegant means of expressing physical laws.\n\nThe behaviour of electric and magnetic fields, whether in cases of electrostatics, magnetostatics, or [[electrodynamics]] (electromagnetic fields), is governed by Maxwell's equations. In the vector field formalism, these are:\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon_0}</math> ([[Gauss's law]])\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0</math> ([[Gauss's law for magnetism]])\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac {\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}</math> ([[Faraday's law of induction#The Maxwell-Faraday equation|Faraday's law]])\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J} + \\mu_0\\varepsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}</math> ([[Amp\u00e8re's circuital law#Extending the original law: the Maxwell\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation|Maxwell\u2013Amp\u00e8re law]])\n\nwhere <math>\\rho</math> is the charge density, which can (and often does) depend on time and position, <math>\\epsilon_0</math> is the [[permittivity]] of free space, <math>\\mu_0</math> is the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] of free space, and '''J''' is the current density vector, also a function of time and position. The units used above are the standard SI units. Inside a linear material, Maxwell's equations change by switching the permeability and permittivity of free space with the permeability and permittivity of the linear material in question. Inside other materials which possess more complex responses to electromagnetic fields, these terms are often represented by complex numbers, or tensors.\n\nThe [[Lorentz force law]] governs the interaction of the electromagnetic field with charged matter.\n\nWhen a field travels across to different media, the properties of the field change according to the various boundary conditions. These equations are derived from Maxwell's equations.\nThe tangential components of the electric and magnetic fields as they relate on the boundary of two media are as follows:<ref>Schaum's outline of theory and problems of electromagnetics(2nd Edition), Joseph A.

Faraday's Law may be stated roughly as 'a changing magnetic field creates an electric field'. This is the principle behind the [[electric generator]].\n\nAmpere's Law roughly states that 'a changing electric field creates a magnetic field'. Thus, this law can be applied to generate a magnetic field and run an [[electric motor]].\n\n===Behavior of the fields in the absence of charges or currents===\n[[Maxwell's equations]] take the form of an [[electromagnetic wave]] in a volume of space not containing charges or currents ([[free space]]) \u2013 that is, where <math>\\rho</math> and '''J''' are zero. Under these conditions, the electric and magnetic fields satisfy the [[electromagnetic wave equation]]:<ref>Field and Wave Electromagnetics (2nd Edition), David K.

The word 'force' is sometimes replaced by 'interaction' because modern [[particle physics]] models electromagnetism as an exchange of particles known as [[gauge boson]]s.\n\n===Electromagnetic and gravitational fields===\nSources of electromagnetic fields consist of two types of [[Charge (physics)|charge]] \u2013 positive and negative. This contrasts with the sources of the gravitational field, which are masses. Masses are sometimes described as ''gravitational charges'', the important feature of them being that there are only positive masses and no [[negative mass]]es. Further, gravity differs from electromagnetism in that positive masses attract other positive masses whereas same charges in electromagnetism repel each other.\n\nThe relative [[field strength|strengths]] and ranges of the four interactions and other information are tabulated below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However the general case of a static EM field with both electric and magnetic components present, is the case that appears to most observers. Observers who see only an electric or magnetic field component of a static EM field, have the other (electric or magnetic) component suppressed, due to the special case of the immobile state of the charges that produce the EM field in that case. In such cases the other component becomes manifest in other observer frames.\n\nA consequence of this, is that any case that seems to consist of a \"pure\" static electric or magnetic field, can be converted to an EM field, with both E and M components present, by simply moving the observer into a [[frame of reference]] which is moving with regard to the frame in which only the \u201cpure\u201d electric or magnetic field appears. That is, a pure static electric field will show the familiar magnetic field associated with a current, in any [[frame of reference]] where the charge moves. Likewise, any new motion of a charge in a region that seemed previously to contain only a magnetic field, will show that the space now contains an electric field as well, which will be found to produces an additional Lorentz force upon the moving charge.\n\nThus, [[electrostatics]], as well as [[magnetism]] and [[magnetostatics]], are now seen as studies of the static EM field when a particular frame has been selected to suppress the other type of field, and since an EM field with both electric and magnetic will appear in any other frame, these \"simpler\" effects are merely the observer's. The \"applications\" of all such non-time varying (static) fields are discussed in the main articles linked in this section.\n\n===Time-varying EM fields in Maxwell\u2019s equations===\n{{main|near and far field|near field optics|virtual particle|dielectric heating|Electromagnetic induction}}\nAn EM field that varies in time has two \u201ccauses\u201d in Maxwell's equations. One is charges and currents (so-called \u201csources\u201d), and the other cause for an E or M field is a change in the other type of field (this last cause also appears in \u201cfree space\u201d very far from currents and charges).\n\nAn electromagnetic field very far from currents and charges (sources) is called [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EMR) since it radiates from the charges and currents in the source, and has no \"feedback\" effect on them, and is also not affected directly by them in the present time (rather, it is indirectly produced by a sequences of changes in fields radiating out from them in the past). EMR consists of the radiations in the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], including [[radio wave]]s, [[microwave]], [[infrared]], [[visible light]], [[ultraviolet light]], [[X-rays]], and [[gamma ray]]s. The many commercial applications of these radiations are discussed in the named and linked articles.\n\nA notable application of visible light is that this type of energy from the Sun powers all life on Earth that either makes or uses oxygen.\n\nA changing electromagnetic field which is physically close to currents and charges (see [[near and far field]] for a definition of \u201cclose\u201d) will have a [[dipole]] characteristic that is dominated by either a changing [[electric dipole]], or a changing [[magnetic dipole]]. This type of dipole field near sources is called an electromagnetic ''near-field''.\n\nChanging ''electric'' dipole fields, as such, are used commercially as near-fields mainly as a source of [[dielectric heating]]. Otherwise, they appear parasitically around conductors which absorb EMR, and around antennas which have the purpose of generating EMR at greater distances.\n\nChanging ''magnetic'' dipole fields (i.e., magnetic near-fields) are used commercially for many types of [[Electromagnetic induction|magnetic induction]] devices. These include motors and electrical transformers at low frequencies, and devices such as [[metal detector]]s and [[MRI]] scanner coils at higher frequencies. Sometimes these high-frequency magnetic fields change at radio frequencies without being far-field waves and thus radio waves; see [[RFID]] tags.\nSee also [[near-field communication]].\nFurther uses of near-field EM effects commercially, may be found in the article on [[virtual photon]]s, since at the quantum level, these fields are represented by these particles. Far-field effects (EMR) in the quantum picture of radiation, are represented by ordinary [[photon]]s.\n\n=== Other ===\n* Electromagnetic field can be used to record data on static electricity.\n* Old televisions can be traced with Electromagnetic fields.\n\n==Health and safety==\nThe potential effects of electromagnetic fields on human health vary widely depending on the frequency and intensity of the fields.\n\nThe potential health effects of the very low frequency EMFs surrounding power lines and electrical devices are the subject of on-going research and a significant amount of public debate. The US [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) and other US government agencies do not consider EMFs a proven health hazard. NIOSH has issued some cautionary advisories but stresses that the data are currently too limited to draw good conclusions.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/96-129/ |title=NIOSH Fact Sheet: EMFs in the Workplace |accessdate=31 August 2015|publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|date=1996}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, radiation from other parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], such as [[ultraviolet]] light and [[gamma ray]]s, are known to cause significant harm in some circumstances.

The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light (in fact, this field can be identified ''as'' light) and interacts with charges and currents. Its [[electromagnetic field tensor|quantum counterpart]] is one of the four [[fundamental force]]s of nature (the others are [[gravitation]], [[weak interaction]] and [[strong interaction]].)\n\nThe field can be viewed as the combination of an [[electric field]] and a [[magnetic field]]. The electric field is produced by stationary charges, and the magnetic field by moving charges (currents); these two are often described as the sources of the field. The way in which charges and currents interact with the electromagnetic field is described by [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Lorentz force law]].<ref>Purcell. p5-11;p61;p277-296</ref> The force created by the electric field is much stronger than the  force created by the magnetic field.<ref>Purcell, p235: We then calculate the electric field due to a charge moving with constant velocity; it does not equal the spherically symmetric Coulomb field.</ref>\n\nFrom a [[Classical physics|classical]] perspective in the [[history of electromagnetism]], the electromagnetic field can be regarded as a smooth, continuous [[field (physics)|field]], propagated in a wavelike manner. By contrast, from the perspective of [[quantum field theory]], this field is seen as quantized; meaning that the free quantum field (i.e. non-interacting field) can be expressed as the Fourier sum of [[creation and annihilation operators]] in energy-momentum space while the effects of the interacting quantum field may be  analyzed in [[perturbation theory]] via the [[S-matrix]] with the aid of a whole host of mathematical technologies such as the [[Dyson series]], [[Wick's theorem]], [[Correlation function (quantum field theory)|correlation functions]], [[Time-evolution operator|time-evolution operators]], [[Feynman diagrams]] etc. Note that the quantized field is still spatially continuous; its ''energy states'' however are discrete (the field's energy states must not be confused with its ''energy values'', which are continuous; the quantum field's [[creation operators]] create multiple ''discrete'' states of energy called [[photons]].)\n\n==Structure==\nThe electromagnetic field may be viewed in two distinct ways: a continuous structure or a discrete structure.\n\n===Continuous structure===\nClassically, electric and magnetic fields are thought of as being produced by smooth motions of charged objects. For example, oscillating charges produce variations in electric and magnetic fields that may be viewed in a 'smooth', continuous, wavelike fashion. In this case, energy is viewed as being transferred continuously through the electromagnetic field between any two locations. For instance, the metal atoms in a [[radio]] [[transmitter]] appear to transfer energy continuously. This view is useful to a certain extent (radiation of low frequency), but problems are found at high frequencies (see [[ultraviolet catastrophe]]).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Electrodynamics|last=Griffiths|first=David J.|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1999|isbn=0-13-805326-X|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458|pages=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontoel00grif_0/page/364 364]|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoel00grif_0/page/364}}</ref>\n\n===Discrete structure===\nThe electromagnetic field may be thought of in a more 'coarse' way. Experiments reveal that in some circumstances electromagnetic energy transfer is better described as being carried in the form of packets called [[quantum|quanta]] (in this case, [[photon]]s) with a fixed [[frequency]]. Planck's relation links the [[photon energy]] ''E'' of a photon to its frequency f through the equation:<ref>{{cite book|author=Spencer, James N.|display-authors=etal|title=Chemistry: Structure and Dynamics|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2010|isbn=9780470587119|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FRfcVwFr17IC&pg=PA78}}</ref>\n\n:<math>E= \\, h f</math>\n\nwhere ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]], and ''f'' is the frequency of the photon . Although modern quantum optics tells us that there also is a semi-classical explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]]\u2014the emission of electrons from metallic surfaces subjected to [[electromagnetic radiation]]\u2014the photon was historically (although not strictly necessarily) used to explain certain observations. It is found that increasing the intensity of the incident radiation (so long as one remains in the linear regime) increases only the number of electrons ejected, and has almost no effect on the energy distribution of their ejection. Only the frequency of the radiation is relevant to the energy of the ejected electrons.\n\nThis [[quantum]] picture of the electromagnetic field (which treats it as analogous to [[harmonic oscillators]]) has proven very successful, giving rise to [[quantum electrodynamics]], a [[quantum field theory]] describing the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with charged matter. It also gives rise to [[quantum optics]], which is different from quantum electrodynamics in that the matter itself is modelled using [[quantum mechanics]] rather than quantum field theory.\n\n==Dynamics==\nIn the past, [[Electrical charge|electrically charged]] objects were thought to produce two different, unrelated types of field associated with their charge property. An [[electric field]] is produced when the charge is stationary with respect to an observer measuring the properties of the charge, and a [[magnetic field]] as well as an electric field is produced when the charge moves, creating an electric current with respect to this observer. Over time, it was realized that the electric and magnetic fields are better thought of as two parts of a greater whole \u2014 the electromagnetic field. Until 1820, when the Danish physicist [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted|H. C. \u00d8rsted]] showed the effect of electric current on a compass needle, electricity and magnetism had been viewed as unrelated phenomena.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stauffer |first1=Robert C. |title=Speculation and experiment in the background of Oersted's discovery of electromagnetism |journal=Isis |date=1957 |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=33\u201350 |jstor=226900 |doi=10.1086/348537}}</ref> In 1831, [[Michael Faraday]] made the seminal observation that time-varying magnetic fields could induce electric currents and then, in 1864, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] published his famous paper ''[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]''.<ref>Maxwell 1864 5, page 499; also [[David J. Griffiths]] (1999), Introduction to electrodynamics, third Edition, ed. Prentice Hall, pp. 559-562\"(as quoted in Gabriela, 2009)</ref>\n\nOnce this electromagnetic field has been produced from a given charge distribution, other charged or magnetised objects in this field may experience a force. If these other charges and currents are comparable in size to the sources producing the above electromagnetic field, then a new net electromagnetic field will be produced. Thus, the electromagnetic field may be viewed as a dynamic entity that causes other charges and currents to move, and which is also affected by them. These interactions are described by [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Lorentz Force Law|Lorentz force law]]. This discussion ignores the [[radiation reaction force]].\n\n==Feedback loop==\nThe behavior of the electromagnetic field can be divided into four different parts of a loop:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Electrodynamics|last=Griffith|first=David J.|publisher=Prentice|year=1999|isbn=0-13-805326-X|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, 07458|pages=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontoel00grif_0/page/321 321, Chapter 7.3, Maxwell's Equations]|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoel00grif_0/page/321}}</ref>\n\n*the electric and magnetic fields are generated by moving electric charges,\n*the electric and magnetic fields interact with each other,\n*the electric and magnetic fields produce forces on electric charges,\n*the electric charges move in space.\n\nA common misunderstanding is that (a) the quanta of the fields act in the same manner as (b) the charged particles, such as electrons, that generate the fields. In our everyday world, electrons travel slowly through conductors with a [[drift velocity]] of a fraction of a centimeter (or inch) per second and through a [[vacuum tube]] at speeds of around 1 thousand km/s,<ref name=\"Hoag 2009\">{{cite web |last1=Hoag |first1=JB |title=Velocity of Electrons in a Vacuum Tube |url=http://www.vias.org/basicradio/basic_radio_02_03.html |website=Basic Radio |accessdate=22 June 2019 |date=2009}}</ref> but fields propagate at the [[speed of light]], approximately 300 thousand kilometers (or 186 thousand miles) a second. The speed ratio between charged particles in a conductor and field quanta is on the order of one to a million. [[Maxwell's equations]] relate (a) the presence and movement of charged particles with (b) the generation of fields. Those fields can then affect the force on, and can then move other slowly moving charged particles. Charged particles can move at relativistic speeds nearing field propagation speeds, but, as [[Einstein]] showed{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}, this requires enormous field energies, which are not present in our everyday experiences with electricity, magnetism, matter, and time and space.\n\nThe feedback loop can be summarized in a list, including phenomena belonging to each part of the loop:{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n*charged particles generate electric and magnetic fields\n*the fields interact with each other\n**changing electric field acts like a current, generating 'vortex' of magnetic field\n**[[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday induction]]: changing magnetic field induces (negative) vortex of electric field\n**[[Lenz's law]]: negative feedback loop between electric and magnetic fields\n*fields act upon particles\n**Lorentz force: force due to electromagnetic field\n***electric force: same direction as electric field\n***magnetic force: perpendicular both to magnetic field and to velocity of charge\n*particles move\n**current is movement of particles\n*particles generate more electric and magnetic fields; cycle repeats\n\n==Mathematical description==\n{{main|Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field}}\nThere are different mathematical ways of representing the electromagnetic field. The first one views the electric and magnetic fields as three-dimensional [[vector field]]s. These vector fields each have a value defined at every point of space and time and are thus often regarded as functions of the space and time coordinates. As such, they are often written as '''E'''(x, y, z, t) ([[electric field]]) and '''B'''(x, y, z, t) ([[magnetic field]]).\n\nIf only the electric field ('''E''') is non-zero, and is constant in time, the field is said to be an [[electrostatic field]]. Similarly, if only the magnetic field ('''B''') is non-zero and is constant in time, the field is said to be a [[magnetostatic field]]. However, if either the electric or magnetic field has a time-dependence, then both fields must be considered together as a coupled electromagnetic field using [[Maxwell's equations]].<ref>Electromagnetic Fields (2nd Edition), Roald K.

Maxwell's equations can be written in tensor form, generally viewed by physicists as a more elegant means of expressing physical laws.\n\nThe behaviour of electric and magnetic fields, whether in cases of electrostatics, magnetostatics, or [[electrodynamics]] (electromagnetic fields), is governed by Maxwell's equations. In the vector field formalism, these are:\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon_0}</math> ([[Gauss's law]])\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0</math> ([[Gauss's law for magnetism]])\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac {\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}</math> ([[Faraday's law of induction#The Maxwell-Faraday equation|Faraday's law]])\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J} + \\mu_0\\varepsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}</math> ([[Amp\u00e8re's circuital law#Extending the original law: the Maxwell\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation|Maxwell\u2013Amp\u00e8re law]])\n\nwhere <math>\\rho</math> is the charge density, which can (and often does) depend on time and position, <math>\\epsilon_0</math> is the [[permittivity]] of free space, <math>\\mu_0</math> is the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] of free space, and '''J''' is the current density vector, also a function of time and position. The units used above are the standard SI units. Inside a linear material, Maxwell's equations change by switching the permeability and permittivity of free space with the permeability and permittivity of the linear material in question. Inside other materials which possess more complex responses to electromagnetic fields, these terms are often represented by complex numbers, or tensors.\n\nThe [[Lorentz force law]] governs the interaction of the electromagnetic field with charged matter.\n\nWhen a field travels across to different media, the properties of the field change according to the various boundary conditions. These equations are derived from Maxwell's equations.\nThe tangential components of the electric and magnetic fields as they relate on the boundary of two media are as follows:<ref>Schaum's outline of theory and problems of electromagnetics(2nd Edition), Joseph A.

Faraday's Law may be stated roughly as 'a changing magnetic field creates an electric field'. This is the principle behind the [[electric generator]].\n\nAmpere's Law roughly states that 'a changing electric field creates a magnetic field'. Thus, this law can be applied to generate a magnetic field and run an [[electric motor]].\n\n===Behavior of the fields in the absence of charges or currents===\n[[Maxwell's equations]] take the form of an [[electromagnetic wave]] in a volume of space not containing charges or currents ([[free space]]) \u2013 that is, where <math>\\rho</math> and '''J''' are zero.

The word 'force' is sometimes replaced by 'interaction' because modern [[particle physics]] models electromagnetism as an exchange of particles known as [[gauge boson]]s.\n\n===Electromagnetic and gravitational fields===\nSources of electromagnetic fields consist of two types of [[Charge (physics)|charge]] \u2013 positive and negative. This contrasts with the sources of the gravitational field, which are masses. Masses are sometimes described as ''gravitational charges'', the important feature of them being that there are only positive masses and no [[negative mass]]es. Further, gravity differs from electromagnetism in that positive masses attract other positive masses whereas same charges in electromagnetism repel each other.\n\nThe relative [[field strength|strengths]] and ranges of the four interactions and other information are tabulated below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However the general case of a static EM field with both electric and magnetic components present, is the case that appears to most observers. Observers who see only an electric or magnetic field component of a static EM field, have the other (electric or magnetic) component suppressed, due to the special case of the immobile state of the charges that produce the EM field in that case. In such cases the other component becomes manifest in other observer frames.\n\nA consequence of this, is that any case that seems to consist of a \"pure\" static electric or magnetic field, can be converted to an EM field, with both E and M components present, by simply moving the observer into a [[frame of reference]] which is moving with regard to the frame in which only the \u201cpure\u201d electric or magnetic field appears. That is, a pure static electric field will show the familiar magnetic field associated with a current, in any [[frame of reference]] where the charge moves. Likewise, any new motion of a charge in a region that seemed previously to contain only a magnetic field, will show that the space now contains an electric field as well, which will be found to produces an additional Lorentz force upon the moving charge.\n\nThus, [[electrostatics]], as well as [[magnetism]] and [[magnetostatics]], are now seen as studies of the static EM field when a particular frame has been selected to suppress the other type of field, and since an EM field with both electric and magnetic will appear in any other frame, these \"simpler\" effects are merely the observer's. The \"applications\" of all such non-time varying (static) fields are discussed in the main articles linked in this section.\n\n===Time-varying EM fields in Maxwell\u2019s equations===\n{{main|near and far field|near field optics|virtual particle|dielectric heating|Electromagnetic induction}}\nAn EM field that varies in time has two \u201ccauses\u201d in Maxwell\u2019s equations. One is charges and currents (so-called \u201csources\u201d), and the other cause for an E or M field is a change in the other type of field (this last cause also appears in \u201cfree space\u201d very far from currents and charges).\n\nAn electromagnetic field very far from currents and charges (sources) is called [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EMR) since it radiates from the charges and currents in the source, and has no \"feedback\" effect on them, and is also not affected directly by them in the present time (rather, it is indirectly produced by a sequences of changes in fields radiating out from them in the past). EMR consists of the radiations in the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], including [[radio wave]]s, [[microwave]], [[infrared]], [[visible light]], [[ultraviolet light]], [[X-rays]], and [[gamma ray]]s. The many commercial applications of these radiations are discussed in the named and linked articles.\n\nA notable application of visible light is that this type of energy from the Sun powers all life on Earth that either makes or uses oxygen.\n\nA changing electromagnetic field which is physically close to currents and charges (see [[near and far field]] for a definition of \u201cclose\u201d) will have a [[dipole]] characteristic that is dominated by either a changing [[electric dipole]], or a changing [[magnetic dipole]]. This type of dipole field near sources is called an electromagnetic ''near-field''.\n\nChanging ''electric'' dipole fields, as such, are used commercially as near-fields mainly as a source of [[dielectric heating]]. Otherwise, they appear parasitically around conductors which absorb EMR, and around antennas which have the purpose of generating EMR at greater distances.\n\nChanging ''magnetic'' dipole fields (i.e., magnetic near-fields) are used commercially for many types of [[Electromagnetic induction|magnetic induction]] devices. These include motors and electrical transformers at low frequencies, and devices such as [[metal detector]]s and [[MRI]] scanner coils at higher frequencies. Sometimes these high-frequency magnetic fields change at radio frequencies without being far-field waves and thus radio waves; see [[RFID]] tags.\nSee also [[near-field communication]].\nFurther uses of near-field EM effects commercially, may be found in the article on [[virtual photon]]s, since at the quantum level, these fields are represented by these particles. Far-field effects (EMR) in the quantum picture of radiation, are represented by ordinary [[photon]]s.\n\n=== Other ===\n\n* Electromagnetic field can be used to record data on static electricity.\n\n* Old televisions can be traced with Electromagnetic fields.\n\n==Health and safety==\nThe potential effects of electromagnetic fields on human health vary widely depending on the frequency and intensity of the fields.\n\nThe potential health effects of the very low frequency EMFs surrounding power lines and electrical devices are the subject of on-going research and a significant amount of public debate. The US [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) and other US government agencies do not consider EMFs a proven health hazard. NIOSH has issued some cautionary advisories but stresses that the data are currently too limited to draw good conclusions.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/96-129/ |title=NIOSH Fact Sheet: EMFs in the Workplace |accessdate=31 August 2015|publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|date=1996}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, radiation from other parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], such as [[ultraviolet]] light and [[gamma ray|gamma rays]], are known to cause significant harm in some circumstances.

His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most recognisable Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success.

His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again.

The 14 oil paintings and other works in the exhibition reflected Dal\u00ed's increasing interest in atomic physics. Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''. The proportions of the latter work were worked out in collaboration with a mathematician.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 440-42</ref>\n\nIn early 1948 Dal\u00ed's ''50 Secrets of Magic Craftsmanship'' was published.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was charged with assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting.

Other designs Dal\u00ed made for her include a shoe-shaped hat, and a pink belt with lips for a buckle. He was also involved in creating textile designs and perfume bottles.

The Comte de Grandsailles and Solange de Cl\u00e9da pursue a love affair, but interwar political turmoil and other vicissitudes drive them apart. It is variously set in [[Paris]], rural France, [[Casablanca]] in North Africa and [[Palm Springs]] in the United States. Secondary characters include aging widow Barbara Rogers, her bisexual daughter Veronica, Veronica's sometime female lover Betka, and Baba, a disfigured US fighter pilot.<ref>Salvador Dal\u00ed: ''Hidden faces'': London: Owen: 1973</ref> The novel was written in New York, and translated by [[Haakon Chevalier]].\n\nHis other literary works include ''[[The Secret Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed]]'' (1942), ''Diary of a Genius'' (1966), and ''Oui: The Paranoid-Critical Revolution'' (1971). Dal\u00ed also published poetry, essays, art criticism and a technical manual on art.\n\n=== Graphic arts ===\nThe artist worked extensively in the [[graphic arts]], producing many etchings and [[lithograph]]s. While his early work in printmaking is equal in quality to his important paintings, as he grew older he would sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself. In addition, a large number of fakes were produced in the 1980s and 1990s, thus further confusing the Dal\u00ed print market.<ref name=\"Forde_170\">Forde, Kevin (2011).

In 1931 he became involved in the [[Workers and Peasants' Bloc|Wokers' and Peasants' Front]], delivering lectures at meetings and contributing to their party journal.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 287-89</ref> However, as political divisions within the Surrealist group grew, Dal\u00ed soon developed a more apolitical stance, refusing to publicly denounce fascism. In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dal\u00ed narrowly avoided being expelled from the group.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dal\u00ed avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dal\u00ed praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist group.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dal\u00ed's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dal\u00ed was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''[[The First Days of Spring]]'' (1929), ''[[The Great Masturbator]]'' (1929) and ''[[The Lugubrious Game]]'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career. In 1941 the Director of Exhibitions and Publications at MoMA wrote: \"The fame of Salvador Dal\u00ed has been an issue of particular controversy for more than a decade...Dal\u00ed's conduct may have been undignified, but the greater part of his art is a matter of dead earnest.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 413-14</ref> When Dal\u00ed was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts|French Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1979 one of his fellow academicians stated that he hoped Dal\u00ed would now abandon his \"clowneries\".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 569</ref>\n\nIn 1936, at the premiere screening of [[Joseph Cornell]]'s film ''[[Rose Hobart (film)|Rose Hobart]]'' at Julien Levy's gallery in New York City, Dal\u00ed knocked over the projector in a rage and is said to have shouted:  \"He stole it [the film] from my subconscious!

His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most recognisable Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behaviour sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again. The following summer, Dal\u00ed and Gala rented a small fisherman's cabin in a nearby bay at [[Port Lligat]].

The 14 oil paintings and other works in the exhibition reflected Dal\u00ed's increasing interest in atomic physics. Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''. The proportions of the latter work were worked out in collaboration with a mathematician.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 440-42</ref>\n\nIn early 1948 Dal\u00ed's ''50 Secrets of Magic Craftsmanship'' was published.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was charged with assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting.

Halsman produced the ''Dal\u00ed Atomica'' series (1948)&nbsp;\u2013  inspired by Dal\u00ed's painting ''Leda Atomica''&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2013  which in one photograph depicts \"a painter's easel, three cats, a bucket of water, and Dal\u00ed himself floating in the air\".<ref name=designws />\n\n=== Architecture ===\n[[File:Dali museum.jpg|thumb|[[Dal\u00ed Theatre and Museum]] in [[Figueres]] also holds the crypt where Dal\u00ed is buried]]\nDal\u00ed's architectural achievements include his [[Port Lligat]] house near [[Cadaqu\u00e9s]], as well as his [[Dal\u00ed Theatre and Museum|Theatre and Museum]] in [[Figueres]].

The Comte de Grandsailles and Solange de Cl\u00e9da pursue a love affair, but interwar political turmoil and other vicissitudes drive them apart. It is variously set in [[Paris]], rural France, [[Casablanca]] in North Africa and [[Palm Springs]] in the United States. Secondary characters include aging widow Barbara Rogers, her bisexual daughter Veronica, Veronica's sometime female lover Betka, and Baba, a disfigured US fighter pilot.<ref>Salvador Dal\u00ed: ''Hidden faces'': London: Owen: 1973</ref> The novel was written in New York, and translated by [[Haakon Chevalier]].\n\nHis other literary works include ''[[The Secret Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed]]'' (1942), ''Diary of a Genius'' (1966), and ''Oui: The Paranoid-Critical Revolution'' (1971). Dal\u00ed also published poetry, essays, art criticism and a technical manual on art.\n\n=== Graphic arts ===\nThe artist worked extensively in the [[graphic arts]], producing many etchings and [[lithograph]]s. While his early work in printmaking is equal in quality to his important paintings, as he grew older he would sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself. In addition, a large number of fakes were produced in the 1980s and 1990s, thus further confusing the Dal\u00ed print market.<ref name=\"Forde_170\">Forde, Kevin (2011).

In 1931 he became involved in the [[Workers and Peasants' Bloc|Wokers' and Peasants' Front]], delivering lectures at meetings and contributing to their party journal.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 287-89</ref> However, as political divisions within the Surrealist group grew, Dal\u00ed soon developed a more apolitical stance, refusing to publicly denounce fascism. In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dal\u00ed narrowly avoided being expelled from the group.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dal\u00ed avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dal\u00ed praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist group.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dal\u00ed's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dal\u00ed was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959.

Dal\u00ed's painting ''[[Tuna Fishing (painting)|Tuna Fishing (Homage to Meissonier)]]'' (1967) was inspired by his reading of Chardin.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 525</ref>\n\n=== Sexuality ===\nDal\u00ed's sexuality had a profound influence on his work. He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''[[The First Days of Spring]]'' (1929), ''[[The Great Masturbator]]'' (1929) and ''[[The Lugubrious Game]]'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career. In 1941 the Director of Exhibitions and Publications at MoMA wrote: \"The fame of Salvador Dal\u00ed has been an issue of particular controversy for more than a decade...Dal\u00ed's conduct may have been undignified, but the greater part of his art is a matter of dead earnest.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 413-14</ref> When Dal\u00ed was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts|French Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1979 one of his fellow academicians stated that he hoped Dal\u00ed would now abandon his \"clowneries\".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 569</ref>\n\nIn 1936, at the premiere screening of [[Joseph Cornell]]'s film ''[[Rose Hobart (film)|Rose Hobart]]'' at Julien Levy's gallery in New York City, Dal\u00ed knocked over the projector in a rage and is said to have shouted:  \"He stole it [the film] from my subconscious!
