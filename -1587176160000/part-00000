{"title_page": "Article One of the United States Constitution", "text_new": "{{short description|Portion of the US Constitution regarding Congress}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2017}}\n{{wikisource|Constitution of the United States of America#Article I|Article 1\n of the United States Constitution}}\n{{US Constitution article series}}\n'''Article One of the United States Constitution''' establishes the [[Legislature|legislative branch]] of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], the [[United States Congress]]. Under Article One, Congress is a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature consisting of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Article One grants Congress various [[Enumerated powers (United States)|enumerated powers]] and the ability to pass laws \"[[Necessary and Proper Clause|necessary and proper]]\" to carry out those powers. Article One also establishes the procedures for passing a bill and places various limits on the powers of Congress and the [[U.S. state|states]].\n\nArticle One's [[Vesting Clauses|Vesting Clause]] grants all federal legislative power to Congress and establishes that Congress consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate. In combination with the Vesting Clauses of Article Two and Article Three, the Vesting Clause of Article One establishes the [[separation of powers]] among the three branches of the federal government. Section 2 of Article One addresses the House of Representatives, establishing that members of the House are elected every two years, with congressional seats apportioned to the states on the basis of population. Section 2 includes various rules for the House of Representatives, including a provision stating that individuals qualified to vote in elections for the largest chamber of their state's legislature have the right to vote in elections for the House of Representatives. Section 3 addresses the Senate, establishing that the Senate consists of two senators from each state, with each senator serving a six-year term. Section 3 originally required that the state legislatures elect the members of the Senate, but the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]], ratified in 1913, provides for the direct election of senators. Section 3 lays out various other rules for the Senate, including a provision that establishes the [[Vice President of the United States]] as the president of the Senate.\n\nSection 4 of Article One grants the states the power to regulate the congressional election process but establishes that Congress can alter those regulations or make its own regulations. Section 4 also requires Congress to assemble at least once per year. Section 5 lays out various rules for both houses of Congress and grants the House of Representatives and the Senate the power to judge their own elections, determine the qualifications of their own members, and punish or expel their own members. Section 6 establishes the compensation, privileges, and restrictions of those holding congressional office. Section 7 lays out the procedures for passing a bill, requiring both houses of Congress to pass a bill for it to become law, subject to the [[List of United States presidential vetoes|veto power]] of the [[President of the United States]]. Under Section 7, the president can veto a bill, but Congress can override the president's veto with a two-thirds vote of both chambers.\n\nSection 8 lays out the powers of Congress. It includes several enumerated powers, including the power to [[Taxing and Spending Clause|lay and collect taxes and tariffs]] for the \"general welfare\" of the United States, the power to borrow money, the power to [[Commerce Clause|regulate interstate and international commerce]], the power to set [[United States nationality law|naturalization laws]], the power to coin and regulate money, the power to establish [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal courts]] inferior to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], the power to raise and support military forces, and the power to [[Declaration of war by the United States|declare war]]. Section 8 also provides Congress the power to establish a [[Washington, D.C.|federal district]] to serve as the national capital and gives Congress the exclusive power to administer that district. In addition to various enumerated powers, Section 8 grants Congress the power to make laws necessary and proper to carry out its enumerated powers and other powers vested in it. Section 9 places various limits on the power of Congress, banning [[Bill of attainder|bills of attainder]] and other practices. Section 10 places limits on the states, prohibiting them from entering into alliances with foreign powers, [[Contract Clause|impairing contracts]], [[Import-Export Clause|taxing imports or exports]] above the minimum level necessary for inspection, keeping armies, or engaging in war without the consent of Congress.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 1}}Section 1: Legislative power vested in Congress==\n{{main|Vesting Clauses}}\n[[File:C-SPAN 112th Congress Roll Call.jpg|thumb|upright=1.65|Opening of the [[112th United States Congress|112th Congress]] in the House of Representatives chamber, January 5, 2011]]\n{{quote|All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.}}\n\nSection 1 is a [[Vesting Clauses|vesting clause]] that bestows federal [[Legislation|legislative]] power exclusively to Congress. Similar clauses are found in Articles [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|II]] and [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|III]]. The former confers [[Executive (government)|executive]] power upon the President alone, and the latter grants [[Judiciary|judicial]] power solely to the federal judiciary.

The Constitution declares that the Congress may exercise only those legislative powers \"herein granted\" within Article I (as later limited by the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]]).<ref>See ''[[United States v. Lopez]]'', 514 U.S. 549, 592 (1995) (\"[Certain] comments of Hamilton and others about federal power reflected the well-known truth that the new Government would have only the limited and enumerated powers found in the Constitution....

Experience has taught that mere requests for such information often are unavailing, and also that information which is volunteered is not always accurate or complete; so some means of compulsion are essential to obtain what is needed. All this was true before and when the Constitution was framed and adopted. In that period the power of inquiry, with enforcing process, was regarded and employed as a necessary and appropriate attribute of the power to legislate-indeed, was treated as inhering in it. Thus there is ample warrant for thinking... that the constitutional provisions which commit the legislative function to the two houses are intended to include this attribute to the end that the function may be effectively exercised.\").</ref> Since the power to investigate is an aspect of Congress's power to legislate, it is as broad as Congress's powers to legislate.<ref name=\"investigate\">See ''[[Watkins v.

It comprehends probes into departments of the Federal Government to expose corruption, inefficiency or waste.\"); ''Barenblatt'', 360 U.S. at 111 (\"The scope of the power of inquiry... is as penetrating and far-reaching as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the Constitution.\").</ref> However, it is also ''limited'' to inquiries that are \"in aid of the legislative function;\"<ref>''[[Kilbourn v.

As a practical matter, the limitation of Congress's ability to investigate only for a proper purpose (\"in aid of\" its legislative powers) functions as a limit on Congress's ability to investigate the private affairs of individual citizens; matters that simply demand action by another branch of government, without implicating an issue of public policy necessitating legislation by Congress, must be left to those branches due to the doctrine of separation of powers.<ref>See ''McGrain'', 273 U.S. at 170 (\"[N]either house of Congress possesses a \u2018general power of making inquiry into the private affairs of the citizen\u2019;... the power actually possessed is limited to inquiries relating to matters of which the particular house \u2018has jurisdiction\u2019 and in respect of which it rightfully may take other action; [and] if the inquiry relates to \u2018a matter wherein relief or redress could be had only by a judicial proceeding\u2019 it is not within the range of this power, but must be left to the courts, conformably to the constitutional separation of governmental powers....\" (quoting ''Kilbourne'', 103 U.S. at 193)); see also ''Sinclair v.

Since Representatives are to be \"chosen... by the People,\" State Governors are not allowed to appoint temporary replacements when vacancies occur in a state's delegation to the House of Representatives; instead, the Governor of the state is required by [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 2, Clause 4: Vacancies|clause 4]] to issue a [[writ of election]] calling a special election to fill the vacancy.\n\nAt the time of its creation, the Constitution did not explicitly give citizens an inherent right to vote.<ref>''[[Minor v.

Since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], several constitutional amendments have been enacted that have curbed the states' broad powers to set voter qualification standards.  Though never enforced, clause 2 of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Apportionment of representation in House of Representatives|Fourteenth Amendment]] provides that \"when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\" The [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] prohibits the denial of the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude.  The [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] prohibits the denial of the right to vote based on sex.

To facilitate this, the Constitution mandates that a [[United States Census|census]] be conducted every ten years to determine the population of each state and of the nation as a whole and establishes a rule for who shall be counted or excluded from the count. As the new form of government would become operational prior to the completion of a national census, the Constitution also provides for a temporary apportionment of seats.\n\nOriginally, the population of each state and of the nation as a whole was ascertained by adding to the whole number of free Persons, three-fifths the number of all other Persons (i.e. [[slave]]s), but excluding non-taxed [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. This Constitutional rule, known as the [[three-fifths compromise]], was a compromise between Southern and Northern states in which three-fifths of the population of slaves would be counted for [[enumeration]] purposes and for the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives and of taxes among the states. It was, according to [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Joseph Story]] (writing in [[Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States|1833]]), a \"matter of compromise and concession, confessedly unequal in its operation, but a necessary sacrifice to that spirit of conciliation, which was indispensable to the union of states having a great diversity of interests, and physical condition, and political institutions\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2:\u00a7\u00a7 630\u201335, 641\u201347, 673\u201380|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_2_3s22.html|website=The Founder's Constitution|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|ref=Volume 2, Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3, Document 22|page=\u00a7677|year=2000}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the completion of each census, Congress is empowered to use the aggregate population in all the states (according to the prevailing Constitutional rule for determining population) to determine the relative population of each state to the population of the whole, and, based on its calculations, to establish the appropriate size of the House<ref name=prigg>Cf.

Even so, the constraint placed upon Congress's taxation power remained, as the restriction was reiterated in Article 1 Section 9 Clause 4. The amount of [[direct taxes]] that could be collected by the federal government from the people in any State would still be tied directly to that state's share of the national population.\n\nDue to this restriction, application of the [[income tax]] to income derived from real estate and specifically income in the form of dividends from personal property ownership such as stock shares was found to be unconstitutional because it was not apportioned among the states;<ref>''[[Pollock v.

To permit the levying of such an income tax, Congress proposed and the states ratified the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]], which removed the restriction by specifically providing that Congress could levy a tax on income \"from whatever source derived\" without it being apportioned among the States or otherwise based on a State's share of the national population.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 2, Clause 4}}Clause 4: Vacancies===\n{{quote|When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such Vacancies.}}\n\nSection two, Clause four, provides that when vacancies occur in the House of Representatives, it is not the job of the House of Representatives to arrange for a replacement, but the job of the State whose vacant seat is up for refilling. Moreover, the State Governor may not appoint a temporary replacement, but must instead arrange for a special election to fill the vacancy.

Although the Supreme Court has not had an occasion to interpret this specific provision, the Court has suggested that the grant to the House of the \"''sole''\" power of impeachment makes the House the exclusive interpreter of what constitutes an impeachable offense.<ref>Cf.

Also, notably, [[Impeachment process against Richard Nixon|impeachment proceedings]] compelled the resignation of President [[Richard Nixon]].\n\nThe Constitution does not specify how impeachment proceedings are to be initiated. Until the early 20th century, a House member could rise and propose an impeachment, which would then be assigned to a committee for investigation upon a formal resolution vote of the judicial committee. Presently, it is the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]] that initiates the process and then, after investigating the allegations, prepares recommendations for the whole House's consideration. If the House votes to adopt an impeachment resolution, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee recommends a slate of \"managers,\" whom the House subsequently approves by resolution.  These Representatives subsequently become the prosecution team in the impeachment trial in the Senate (see Section 3, Clause 6 below).<ref name=Presser />\n\n=={{anchor|Section 3}}Section 3: Senate==\n\n==={{anchor|Section 3, Clause 1}}Clause 1: Composition; Election of Senators===\n[[File:Standard oil octopus loc color.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Gilded Age]] monopolies could no longer control the U.S. Senate (left) by corrupting state legislatures (right).]]\n{{quote|The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof, for six Years; and each Senator shall have one Vote.}}\n\nThe first Clause of Section Three provides that each state is entitled to have two Senators, who would be elected by its [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] (now by the people of each state), serve for staggered six-year terms, and have one vote each.

It ends by temporarily [[Entrenched clause#United States|shielding]] three Article I clauses from being amended. This clause is among them. (The others are first and fourth clauses in Section 9.) Article Five provides that \"no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.\" Thus, no individual state may have its individual representation in the Senate adjusted without its consent. That is to say, an amendment that changed this clause to provide that all states would get only one Senator (or three Senators, or any other number) could become valid as part of the Constitution if ratified by three-fourths of the states; however, one that provided for some basis of representation other than strict numerical equality (for example, population, wealth, or land area), would require the unanimous consent of all the states.\n\nDenying the states their intended role as joint partners in the federal government by abolishing their [[Equal footing|equality]] in the Senate would, according to [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Salmon P. Chase]] (in ''[[Texas v. White]]''), destroy the grounding of the Union. This Article V provision has been employed by those opposed to contemplated constitutional amendments that would grant the [[District of Columbia]] full representation in the Congress without also granting it statehood. Their argument is that an amendment that would allow a non-state district to have two Senators would deprive the states of their equal suffrage in the Senate and would therefore require unanimous ratification by all the states.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rossum|first1=Ralph Rossum|title=Essays on Article V: Prohibition on Amendment: Equal Suffrage in the Senate|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/5/essays/131/prohibition-on-amendment-equal-suffrage-in-the-senate|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref> Those in favor of the amendment have argued that the States are merely entitled to equal suffrage amongst one another, and that granting the federal district Senate representation does not violate that right.

This was done in May 1789 [[Sortition|by lot]]. It was also decided that each state's Senators would be assigned to two different classes. Those Senators grouped in the first class had their term expire after only two years; those Senators in the second class had their term expire after only four years, instead of six. After this, all Senators from those States have been elected to six-year terms, and as new States have joined the Union, their Senate seats have been assigned to two of the three classes, maintaining each grouping as nearly equal in size as possible. In this way, election is staggered; approximately one-third of the Senate is up for re-election every two years, but the entire body is never up for re-election in the same year (as contrasted with the House, where its entire membership is up for re-election every 2 years).\n\nAs originally established, Senators were elected by the Legislature of the State they represented in the Senate. If a senator died, resigned, or was expelled, the legislature of the state would appoint a replacement to serve out the remainder of the senator's term. If the State Legislature was not in session, its Governor could appoint a temporary replacement to serve until the legislature could elect a permanent replacement. This was superseded by the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]], which provided for the Popular Election of Senators, instead of their appointment by the State Legislature. In a nod to the less populist nature of the Senate, the Amendment tracks the vacancy procedures for the House of Representatives in requiring that the Governor call a special election to fill the vacancy, but (unlike in the House) it vests in the State Legislature the authority to allow the Governor to appoint a temporary replacement until the special election is held. Note, however, that under the original Constitution, the Governors of the states were expressly allowed by the Constitution to make temporary appointments. The current system, under the Seventeenth Amendment, allows Governors to appoint a replacement only if their state legislature has previously decided to allow the Governor to do so; otherwise, the seat must remain vacant until the special election is held to fill the seat, as in the case of a vacancy in the House.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 3, Clause 3}}Clause 3: Qualifications of Senators===\n{{quote|No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.}}\n\nA Senator must be at least 30 years of age, must have been a citizen of the United States for at least nine years before being elected, and must reside in the State they will represent at the time of the election.

The Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to mean that the Senate has exclusive and unreviewable authority to determine what constitutes an adequate impeachment trial.<ref>See ''Nixon'', 506 U.S. at 230\u201331, 233\u201336 (holding that the Senate's sole power to try impeachments made its judgment conclusive as to what constituted an adequate impeachment trial) (\"We think that the word 'sole' is of considerable significance. Indeed, the word 'sole' appears only one other time in the Constitution-with respect to the House of Representatives' \"''sole'' Power of Impeachment.\" The commonsense meaning of the word 'sole' is that the Senate alone shall have authority to determine whether an individual should be acquitted or convicted.

Rehnquist|Chief Justice William Rehnquist]] presiding]]\n\nThe constitution's framers vested the Senate with this power for several reasons. First, they believed Senators would be better educated, more virtuous, and more high-minded than Members of the House of Representatives and thus uniquely able to decide responsibly the most difficult of political questions. Second, they believed that the Senate, being a numerous body, would be well suited to handle the procedural demands of an impeachment trial, in which it, unlike judges and the judiciary system, would \"never be tied down by such strict rules, either in the delineation of the offense by the prosecutor, or in the construction of it by judges, as in the common cases serve to limit the discretion of courts in favor of personal security.\" (Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist No. 65).<ref name=Gerhardt>{{cite web|last1=Gerhardt|first1=Michael J.|title=Essay on Trial of Impeachment|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/17/trial-of-impeachment|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=November 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThere are three Constitutionally mandated requirements for impeachment trials.  The provision that Senators must sit on oath or affirmation was designed to impress upon them the extreme seriousness of the occasion.  The stipulation that the [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] is to preside over presidential impeachment trials underscores the solemnity of the occasion and aims to avoid the conflict of interest of a Vice President's presiding over the proceeding for the removal of the one official standing between them and the presidency. The latter consideration was regarded to be quite important in the eighteenth century - political parties had not yet formed when the Constitution was adopted, and with the original method of electing the President and Vice President it was presumed that the two people elected to those offices would frequently be political rivals. The specification that a two-thirds super-majority vote of those Senators present in order to convict was also thought necessary to facilitate serious deliberation and to make removal possible only through a consensus that cuts across factional divisions.<ref name=Gerhardt/>\n\n==={{anchor|Section 3, Clause 7}}Clause 7: Judgment in cases of impeachment; Punishment on conviction===\n{{quote|Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.}}\n\nIf any officer is convicted on impeachment, he or she is immediately removed from office, and may be barred from holding any public office in the future.

First, it makes clear the division of responsibility with respect to the conduct of the election of federal Senators and Representatives. That responsibility lies primarily with the states and secondarily with Congress. Second, the clause lodges the power to regulate elections in the respective legislative branches of the states and the federal government, not with the executive or judicial.<ref name=APessay>{{cite web|last1=Peacock|first1=Anthony|title=Essays on Article I: Election Regulations|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/19/election-regulations|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref><ref>See ''[[Foster v.

'[T]he regulations made by Congress are paramount to those made by the State legislature; and if they conflict therewith, the latter, so far as the conflict extends, ceases to be operative.' The Clause gives Congress 'comprehensive' authority to regulate the details of elections, including the power to impose 'the numerous requirements as to procedure and safeguards which experience shows are necessary in order to enforce the fundamental right involved.' Congressional authority extends not only to general elections, but also to any 'primary election which involves a necessary step in the choice of candidates for election as representatives in Congress.')

As for regulating the \"manner\" of elections, the Supreme Court has interpreted this to mean \"matters like notices, registration, supervision of voting, protection of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and canvassers, and making and publication of election returns.\"<ref>''[[Cook v.

Congress has, however, required the States to conform to certain practices when drawing districts. States are currently required to use a single-member district scheme, whereby the State is divided into as many election districts for Representatives in the House of Representatives as the size of its representation in that body (that is to say, Representatives cannot be elected at-large from the whole State unless the State has only one Representative in the House, nor can districts elect more than 1 Representative).<ref>{{USC|2|2c}} (2006).</ref> The Supreme Court has interpreted \"by the Legislature thereof\" to include voters using the [[Direct democracy|initiative process]], in those states whose constitutions provide it, to create an independent [[redistricting commission]].<ref>''See [[Arizona State Legislature v.

The act required the two houses of each legislature to meet in joint session on a specified day and to meet every day thereafter until a Senator was selected. The first comprehensive federal statute dealing with elections was adopted in 1870 as a means of enforcing the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment\u2019s]] guarantee against racial discrimination in granting suffrage rights. Under the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]], and subsequent laws, false registration, bribery, voting without legal right, making false returns of votes cast, interference in any manner with officers of election, and the neglect by any such officer of any duty required by state or federal law were made federal offenses. Provision was made for the appointment by federal judges of persons to attend at places of registration and at elections with authority to challenge any person proposing to register or vote unlawfully, to witness the counting of votes, and to identify by their signatures the registration of voters and election tally sheets.<ref name=USC-A&I/>\n\nBeginning with the [[Tillman Act of 1907]], Congress has imposed a growing number of restrictions on [[Campaign finance reform in the United States|elections and campaign financing]]. The most significant piece of legislation has been the 1971 [[Federal Election Campaign Act]]. It was this legislation that was at issue in the Supreme Court's seminal decision, ''[[Buckley v. Valeo]]'' (1976), which, in the face of a First Amendment challenge, set the ground rules for campaign finance legislation, generally disallowing restrictions on expenditures by candidates, but permitting restrictions on contributions by individuals and corporations.<ref name=APessay/>\n\nIn addition to statutory constraints, Congress and the States have altered the electoral process through amending the Constitution (first in the above mentioned Fifteenth Amendment). The Seventeenth Amendment altered the manner of conducting the elections of Senators; establishing that they are to be elected by the people of the states. Also, the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] prohibits any U.S. citizen from being denied the [[suffrage|right to vote]] on the basis of sex; the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fourth Amendment]] prohibits both Congress and the states from conditioning the right to vote in federal elections on payment of a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] or other types of tax; and the [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-sixth Amendment]] prohibits the states and the federal government from using age as a reason for denying the right to vote to U.S. citizens who are at least eighteen years old.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 4, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Sessions of Congress===\n{{quote|The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.}}\n\nClause 2 fixes an annual date upon which Congress must meet. By doing so, the Constitution empowers Congress to meet, whether or not the President called it into session. [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Calling Congress into extraordinary session; adjourning Congress|Article II, Section 3]] does grant the president limited authority to convene and adjourn both Houses (or either of them) and mandates that it will meet at least once in a year to enact legislation on behalf of the people. Some delegates to the 1787 constitutional convention believed yearly meetings were not necessary, for there would not be enough legislative business for Congress to deal with annually. [[Nathaniel Gorham]] of [[Massachusetts]] argued that the time should be fixed to prevent disputes from arising within the legislature, and to allow the states to adjust their elections to correspond with the fixed date. A fixed date also corresponded to the tradition in the states of having annual meetings. Finally, Gorham concluded that the legislative branch should be required to meet at least once a year to act as a check upon the executive department.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Forte|first1=David F.|title=Essays on Article I: Meetings of Congress Clause|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/20/meetings-of-congress-clause|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref>\n\nAlthough this clause provides that the annual meeting was to be on the first Monday in December, the government established by the 1787 Constitution did not begin operations until March 4, 1789. As the [[1st United States Congress|1st Congress]] held its initial meeting on March 4, that became the date on which new representatives and senators took office in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web|title=March 4: A forgotten huge day in American history|url=http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2013/03/march-4-a-forgotten-huge-day-in-american-politics/|publisher=[[National Constitution Center]]|location=Philadelphia|date=March 4, 2013}}</ref> Therefore, every other year, although a new Congress was elected in November, it did not come into office until the following March, with a \"[[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]]\" session convening in the interim. This practice was altered in 1933 following ratification of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]], which states (in Section 2) that, \"The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall begin at noon on the third day of January, unless they shall by law appoint a different day\". This change virtually eliminated the necessity of there being a lame duck session of Congress.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 5}}Section 5: Procedure==\n<!-- [[United States v.

In practice, the quorum requirement is all but ignored. A quorum is assumed to be present unless a [[quorum call]], requested by a member, proves otherwise. Rarely do members ask for quorum calls to demonstrate the absence of a quorum; more often, they use the quorum call as a delaying tactic.\n\nSometimes, unqualified individuals have been admitted to Congress. For instance, the Senate once admitted [[John Eaton (politician)|John Henry Eaton]], a twenty-eight-year-old, in 1818 (the admission was inadvertent, as Eaton's birth date was unclear at the time). In 1934, a twenty-nine-year-old, [[Rush D. Holt Sr.|Rush Holt]], was elected to the Senate; he agreed to wait six months, until his thirtieth birthday, to take the oath. The Senate ruled in that case that the age requirement applied as of the date of the taking of the oath, not the date of election.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 5, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Rules===\n{{quote|Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a member.}}\nEach House can determine its own Rules (assuming a quorum is present), and may punish any of its members.

Members attending, going to or returning from either House are privileged from arrest, except for [[treason]], [[felony]] or [[breach of the peace]]. One may not sue a Senator or Representative for slander occurring during Congressional debate, nor may speech by a member of Congress during a Congressional session be the basis for criminal prosecution. The latter was affirmed when [[Mike Gravel]] published over 4,000 pages of the ''[[Pentagon Papers]]'' in the ''[[Congressional Record]]'', which might have otherwise been a criminal offense. This clause has also been interpreted in ''[[Gravel v. United States]]'', 408 U.S. 606 (1972) to provide protection to aides and staff of sitting members of Congress, so long as their activities relate to legislative matters.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 6, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Independence from the executive===\n{{Main|Ineligibility Clause}}\n{{See also|Saxbe fix}}\n{{quote|No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.}}\nSenators and Representatives may not simultaneously serve in Congress and hold a position in the executive branch. This restriction is meant to protect legislative independence by preventing the president from using [[patronage]] to buy votes in Congress.<ref name=\"Calabresi\" /> It is a major difference from the political system in the British Parliament, where cabinet ministers are required to be members of parliament.\n\nFurthermore, Senators and Representatives cannot resign to take newly created or higher-paying political positions; rather, they must wait until the conclusion of the term for which they were elected. If Congress increases the salary of a particular officer, it may later reduce that salary to permit an individual to resign from Congress and take that position (known as the [[Saxbe fix]]). The effects of the clause were discussed in 1937, when Senator [[Hugo Black]] was appointed an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court]] with some time left in his Senate term. Just prior to the appointment, Congress had increased the pension available to Justices retiring at the age of seventy. It was therefore suggested by some that the office's emolument had been increased during Black's Senatorial term, and that therefore Black could not take office as a Justice. The response, however, was that Black was fifty-one years old, and would not receive the increased pension until at least 19 years later, long after his Senate term had expired.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 7}}Section 7: Bills==\n\n==={{anchor|Section 7, Clause 1}}Clause 1: Bills of revenue===\n{{main|Origination Clause|l1=Bills of Revenue}}\n{{quote|All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.}}\nThis establishes the method for making [[Act of Congress|Acts of Congress]] that involve taxation.

The clause was part of the [[Connecticut Compromise|Great Compromise]] between small and large states; the large states were unhappy with the lopsided power of small states in the Senate, and so the clause theoretically offsets the unrepresentative nature of the Senate, and compensates the large states for allowing equal voting rights to Senators from small states.<ref>Jensen, Erik and Monaghan, Henry.

If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law.

If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.}}\nThis clause is known as the [[Presentment Clause]]. Before a bill becomes law, it must be presented to the President, who has ten days (excluding Sundays) to act upon it. If the President signs the bill, it becomes law. If he disapproves of the bill, he must return it to the House in which it originated together with his objections. This procedure has become known as the [[veto]], although that particular word does not appear in the text of Article One. The bill does not then become law unless both Houses, by two-thirds votes, override the veto. If the President neither signs nor returns the bill within the ten-day limit, the bill becomes law, unless the Congress has adjourned in the meantime, thereby preventing the President from returning the bill to the House in which it originated. In the latter case, the President, by taking no action on the bill towards the end of a session, exercises a \"[[pocket veto]]\", which Congress may not override. In the former case, where the President allows a bill to become law unsigned, there is no common name for the practice, but recent scholarship has termed it a \"default enactment.\"<ref>See Ross Wilson, A Third Way: The Presidential Non-Signing Statement, http://ssrn.com/abstract=1593862</ref>\n\nWhat exactly constitutes an adjournment for the purposes of the pocket veto has been unclear. In the ''[[Pocket Veto Case]]'' (1929), the Supreme Court held that \"the determinative question in reference to an 'adjournment' is not whether it is a final adjournment of Congress or an interim adjournment, such as an adjournment of the first session, but whether it is one that 'prevents' the President from returning the bill to the House in which it originated within the time allowed.\" Since neither House of Congress was in session, the President could not return the bill to one of them, thereby permitting the use of the pocket veto. In ''[[Wright v. United States]]'' (1938), however, the Court ruled that adjournments of one House only did not constitute an adjournment of Congress required for a pocket veto. In such cases, the Secretary or Clerk of the House in question was ruled competent to receive the bill.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 7, Clause 3}}Clause 3: Presidential veto===\n{{quote|Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.}}\n\nIn 1996, Congress passed the [[Line Item Veto Act of 1996|Line Item Veto Act]], which permitted the President, at the time of the signing of the bill, to rescind certain expenditures. The Congress could disapprove the cancellation and reinstate the funds. The President could veto the disapproval, but the Congress, by a two-thirds vote in each House, could override the veto. In the case ''[[Clinton v. City of New York]]'', the Supreme Court found the Line Item Veto Act unconstitutional because it violated the Presentment clause. First, the procedure delegated legislative powers to the President, thereby violating the nondelegation doctrine. Second, the procedure violated the terms of Section Seven, which state, \"if he approve [the bill] he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it.\" Thus, the President may sign the bill, veto it, or do nothing, but he may not amend the bill and then sign it.\n\nEvery bill, order, resolution, or vote that must be passed by both Houses, except on a question of adjournment, must be presented to the President before becoming law. However, to propose a constitutional amendment, two-thirds of both Houses may submit it to the states for the ratification, without any consideration by the President, as prescribed in [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]].\n\nSome Presidents have made very extensive use of the veto, while others have not used it at all. [[Grover Cleveland]], for instance, vetoed over four hundred bills during his first term in office; Congress overrode only two of those vetoes. Meanwhile, seven Presidents have never used the veto power. There have been 2,560 vetoes, including [[pocket veto]]es.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/Legislation/Vetoes/BushGW.htm |title=U.S. Senate: Reference Home &gt; Statistics &amp; Lists &gt; Vetoes by President George W.

Most notably, Clauses 1 (the General Welfare or Taxing and Spending clause), 3 (the Commerce clause), and 18 (The Necessary and Proper clause) have been deemed to grant expansive powers to Congress. These three clauses have been interpreted so broadly that the federal government of the United States exercises many powers that are not expressly delegated to it by the states under the Constitution. Some point to the various social programs of the American [[welfare state#United States|welfare state]] as a prime example, and not all agree with this broad interpretation. [[James Madison]], who wrote much of the Constitution, asserted that Congress could not exercise powers unless they were expressly granted in the Constitution.  While he was President of the United States, Madison [[veto]]ed the Federal Public Works Bill of 1817, calling it unconstitutional, since in his view the federal government did not have the authority to [[Internal improvements|build infrastructure]].<ref>{{cite web|title=James Madison - Veto of federal public works bill of March 3, 1817|url=http://www.constitution.org/jm/18170303_veto.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105014440/http://www.constitution.org/jm/18170303_veto.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 5, 2018|accessdate= November 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://edsitement.neh.gov/sites/edsitement.neh.gov/files/worksheets/VetoMsg.pdf |title=Excerpt from James Madison\u2019s Veto Message: March 3, 1817 |access-date=March 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430011150/https://edsitement.neh.gov/sites/edsitement.neh.gov/files/worksheets/VetoMsg.pdf |archive-date=April 30, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/presvetoes17891988.pdf Presidential Vetoes, 1789\u20131988, p. 34]</ref>\n\n===Clause 1: the General Welfare Clause===\nThis clause is also referred to as the Spending Clause and the Taxing and Spending Clause.<ref>{{cite web|title= |url=https://constitutionallawreporter.com/taxing-and-spending-clause/|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> It states that Congress may lay and collect taxes for the \"common defense\" or \"general welfare\" of the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court has not often defined \"general welfare,\" leaving the [[political question]] to Congress. In ''[[United States v. Butler]]'' (1936), the Court for the first time construed the clause. The dispute centered on a tax collected from processors of agricultural products such as meat; the funds raised by the tax were not paid into the general funds of the treasury, but were rather specially earmarked for farmers. The Court struck down the tax, ruling that the general welfare language in the Taxing and Spending Clause related only to \"matters of national, as distinguished from local, welfare\". Congress continues to make expansive use of the [[Taxing and Spending Clause]]; for instance, the [[social security]] program is authorized under the Taxing and Spending Clause.\n\n===Clause 2: Borrowing Power===\nCongress has the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States. In 1871, when deciding ''[[Knox v. Lee]],'' the Court ruled that this clause permitted Congress to emit bills and make them legal tender in satisfaction of debts. Whenever Congress borrows money, it is obligated to repay the sum as stipulated in the original agreement. However, such agreements are only \"binding on the conscience of the sovereign\", as the doctrine of [[sovereign immunity]] prevents a creditor from suing in court if the government reneges on its commitment.<ref>See ''e.g.'' Perry v. United States, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3388791031923623137 294 U.S. 330 (1935).]</ref>\n\n===Clause 3: Commerce Clause===\n[[File:John Marshall by Henry Inman, 1832.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] established a broad interpretation of the Commerce Clause.]]\n{{Main|Commerce Clause}}\n{{quote|The Congress shall have Power [...] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;}}\nThe Supreme Court has seldom restrained the use of the ''[[commerce clause]]'' for widely varying purposes. The first important decision related to the commerce clause was ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'', decided by a unanimous Court in 1824. The case involved conflicting federal and state laws: [[Thomas Gibbons (politician)|Thomas Gibbons]] had a federal permit to navigate steamboats in the [[Hudson River]], while the other, [[Aaron Ogden]], had a monopoly to do the same granted by the state of New York. Ogden contended that \"commerce\" included only buying and selling of goods and not their transportation. Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] rejected this notion. Marshall suggested that \"commerce\" included navigation of goods, and that it \"must have been contemplated\" by the Framers. Marshall added that Congress's power over commerce \"is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution\".\n\nThe expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause was restrained during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' attitude dominated the Court. In ''[[United States v. E. C. Knight Company]]'' (1895), the Supreme Court limited the newly enacted [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], which had sought to break up the monopolies dominating the nation's economy. The Court ruled that Congress could not regulate the manufacture of goods, even if they were later shipped to other states. Chief Justice Melville Fuller wrote, \"commerce succeeds to manufacture, and is not a part of it.\"\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court sometimes ruled [[New Deal]] programs unconstitutional because they stretched the meaning of the commerce clause. In ''[[Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States]],'' (1935) the Court unanimously struck down industrial codes regulating the slaughter of poultry, declaring that Congress could not regulate commerce relating to the poultry, which had \"come to a permanent rest within the State.\" As Chief Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]] put it, \"so far as the poultry here in question is concerned, the flow of interstate commerce has ceased.\" Judicial rulings against attempted use of Congress's Commerce Clause powers continued during the 1930s.\n\nIn 1937, the Supreme Court began moving away from its laissez-faire attitude concerning Congressional legislation and the Commerce Clause, when it ruled in ''[[National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Company]]'', that the [[National Labor Relations Act]] of 1935 (commonly known as the Wagner Act) was constitutional. The legislation under scrutiny prevented employers from engaging in \"[[unfair labor practice]]s\" such as firing workers for joining [[labor union|unions]]. In sustaining this act, the Court signaled its return to the philosophy espoused by John Marshall, that Congress could pass laws regulating actions that even indirectly influenced interstate commerce.\n\nThis new attitude became firmly set into place in 1942. In ''[[Wickard v. Filburn]]'', the Court ruled that production quotas under the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938]] were constitutionally applied to agricultural production (in this instance, home-grown wheat for private consumption) that was consumed purely intrastate, because its effect upon interstate commerce placed it within the power of Congress to regulate under the Commerce Clause. This decision marked the beginning of the Court's total deference to Congress' claims of Commerce Clause powers, which lasted into the 1990s.\n\n''[[United States v. Lopez]]'' (1995) was the first decision in six decades to invalidate a federal statute on the grounds that it exceeded the power of the Congress under the Commerce Clause. The Court held that while Congress had broad lawmaking authority under the Commerce Clause, the power was limited, and did not extend so far from \"commerce\" as to authorize the regulation of the carrying of [[handgun]]s, especially when there was no evidence that carrying them affected the economy on a massive scale. In a later case, ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'' (2000), the justices ruled that Congress could not make such laws even when there was evidence of aggregate effect.\n\nIn contrast to these rulings, the Supreme Court also continues to follow the precedent set by ''Wickard v. Filburn''. In ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' it ruled that the Commerce Clause granted Congress the authority to criminalize the production and use of home-grown [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] even where states approve its use for [[medical cannabis|medicinal purposes]]. The court held that, as with the agricultural production in the earlier case, home-grown cannabis is a legitimate subject of federal regulation because it competes with marijuana that moves in interstate commerce.\n\n===Clause 18: Implied Powers of Congress===\n====Other powers of Congress====\n[[File:USS Bon Homme Richard (CVA-31) underway in the Gulf of Tonkin on 2 November 1964.jpg|thumb| alt=Aircraft carrier at sea.|Congress authorizes defense spending such as the purchase of the [[USS Bon Homme Richard (CV-31)|USS ''Bon Homme Richard'']].]]\n\nCongress may establish uniform laws relating to [[naturalization]] and [[bankruptcy]]. It may also coin money, regulate the value of American or foreign currency and punish counterfeiters. Congress may fix the standards of weights and measures. Furthermore, Congress may establish [[Postal Clause|post offices and post roads]] (the roads, however, need not be exclusively for the conveyance of mail). Congress may promote the progress of science and useful arts by granting [[United States copyright law|copyrights]] and [[United States patent law|patents]] of limited duration. Section eight, clause eight of Article One, known as the [[Copyright Clause]], is the only instance of the word \"right\" used in the original constitution (though the word does appear in several Amendments).<ref>[[Michael Novak|Novak, Michael]] (1996). The fire of invention, the fuel of interest: On intellectual property. Washington D.C.: The American Enterprise Institute Press.</ref> Though perpetual copyrights and patents are prohibited, the Supreme Court has ruled in ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]'' (2003) that repeated extensions to the term of copyright do not constitute perpetual copyright; also note that this is the only power granted where the means to accomplish its stated purpose is specifically provided for. Courts inferior to the Supreme Court may be established by Congress.\n\nCongress has several powers related to war and the armed forces. Under the [[War Powers Clause]], only Congress may declare war, but in several cases it has, without declaring war, granted the President the authority to engage in military conflicts. Five wars have been declared in United States' history: the [[War of 1812]], the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. Some historians argue that the legal doctrines and legislation passed during the operations against [[Pancho Villa]] constitute a sixth declaration of war. Congress may grant [[letter of marque|letters of marque]] and [[reprisal]]. Congress may establish and support the armed forces, but no appropriation made for the support of the army may be used for more than two years. This provision was inserted because the Framers feared the establishment of a standing army, beyond civilian control, during peacetime. Congress may regulate or call forth the state militias, but the states retain the authority to appoint officers and train personnel. Congress also has exclusive power to make rules and regulations governing the land and naval forces. Although the executive branch and the Pentagon have asserted an ever-increasing measure of involvement in this process, the U.S. Supreme Court has often reaffirmed Congress's exclusive hold on this power (e.g. Burns v. Wilson, 346 U.S. 137 (1953)). Congress used this power twice soon after World War II with the enactment of two statutes: the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] to improve the quality and fairness of courts martial and military justice, and the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]] which among other rights had allowed military service persons to sue for damages until the U.S. Supreme Court repealed that section of the statute in a divisive series of cases, known collectively as the [[Feres v. United States|Feres Doctrine]].\n\nCongress has the exclusive right to legislate \"in all cases whatsoever\" for the nation's capital, the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. Congress chooses to devolve some of such authority to the elected [[Mayor of Washington, D.C.|mayor]] and [[Council of the District of Columbia|council]] of District of Columbia. Nevertheless, Congress remains free to enact any legislation for the District so long as constitutionally permissible, to overturn any legislation by the city government, and technically to revoke the city government at any time. Congress may also exercise such jurisdiction over land purchased from the states for the erection of forts and other buildings.\n\n====Necessary and Proper====\n{{Main|Necessary and Proper Clause}}\n{{quote|The Congress shall have Power [...] To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.}}\nFinally, Congress has the power to do whatever is \"necessary and proper\" to carry out its enumerated powers and, crucially, all others vested in it. This has been interpreted to authorize criminal prosecution of those whose actions have a \"substantial effect\" on interstate commerce in ''Wickard v. Filburn''; however, [[Thomas Jefferson]], in the [[Kentucky Resolutions]], supported by [[James Madison]], maintained that a penal power could not be inferred from a power to regulate, and that the only penal powers were for [[treason]], [[counterfeiting]], [[piracy]] and [[felony]] on the [[high seas]], and offenses against the [[law of nations]].\n\nThe necessary and proper clause has been interpreted extremely broadly, thereby giving Congress wide latitude in legislation. The first landmark case involving the clause was ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'' (1819), which involved the establishment of a [[Second Bank of the United States|national bank]]. [[Alexander Hamilton]], in advocating the creation of the bank, argued that there was \"a more or less direct\" relationship between the bank and \"the powers of collecting taxes, borrowing money, regulating trade between the states, and raising and maintaining fleets and navies\". [[Thomas Jefferson]] countered that Congress's powers \"can all be carried into execution without a national bank. A bank therefore is not necessary, and consequently not authorized by this phrase\". Chief Justice John Marshall agreed with the former interpretation. Marshall wrote that a Constitution listing ''all'' of Congress's powers \"would partake of a prolixity of a legal code and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind\". Since the Constitution could not possibly enumerate the \"minor ingredients\" of the powers of Congress, Marshall \"deduced\" that Congress had the authority to establish a bank from the \"great outlines\" of the general welfare, commerce and other clauses. Under this doctrine of the necessary and proper clause, Congress has sweepingly broad powers (known as [[implied powers]]) not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution. However, the Congress cannot enact laws solely on the implied powers, any action must be necessary and proper in the execution of the enumerated powers.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 9}}Section 9: Limits on Congress==\n\nThe ninth section of Article One places limits on Congress' powers:\n\n{{quote|The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a Tax or duty may be imposed on such Importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each Person.\n\nThe Privilege of the Writ of ''[[wiktionary:habeas corpus|Habeas Corpus]]'' shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\n\nNo [[Bill of attainder]] or ex post facto Law shall be passed.\n\nNo [[Poll tax|Capitation]], or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.\n\nNo Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.\n\nNo Preference shall be given by any Regulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of another: nor shall Vessels bound to, or from, one State, be obliged to enter, clear, or pay Duties in another.\n\nNo Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.\n\nNo Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, [[wiktionary:emolument#Noun|Emolument]], Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.}}\n\n===Clause 1: Slave trade===\n[[File:Africa and the American Flag.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|U.S. brig ''[[USS Perry (1843)|Perry]]'' confronting the slave ship ''Martha'' off [[Ambriz]] on June 6, 1850]]\nThe first clause in this section prevents Congress from passing any law that would restrict the [[slave trade|importation of slaves]] into the United States prior to 1808.  Congress could however, levy a ''[[per capita]]'' duty of up to ten [[Spanish dollar|Spanish milled dollars]] for each slave imported into the country.  This clause was further [[entrenched clause#United States|entrenched]] into the Constitution by [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]], where it is explicitly shielded from constitutional amendment prior to 1808.  On March 2, 1807, Congress approved legislation [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|prohibiting the importation of slaves]] into the United States, which went into effect January 1, 1808, the first day of the prohibition permitted by the Constitution.\n\n===Clauses 2 and 3: Civil and legal protections===\nA writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' is a legal action against unlawful detainment that commands a law enforcement agency or other body that has a person in custody to have a court inquire into the legality of the detention. The court may order the person released if the reason for detention is deemed insufficient or unjustifiable. The Constitution further provides that the privilege of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' may not be suspended \"unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it\". In ''[[Ex parte Milligan]]'' (1866), the Supreme Court ruled that the suspension of ''habeas corpus'' in a time of war was lawful, but military tribunals did not apply to citizens in states that had upheld the authority of the Constitution and where civilian courts were still operating.\n\nA [[bill of attainder]] is a law by which a person is immediately convicted without trial. An ''[[ex post facto]]'' law is a law which applies retroactively, punishing someone for an act that was only made criminal after it was done. The ''ex post facto'' clause does not apply to civil matters.<ref>[[Calder v. Bull]], 3 U.S. 386, 399-400 (1798).</ref>\n\n===Clauses 4-7: Apportionment of direct taxes===\nSection Nine reiterates the provision from [[#Clause 3: Apportionment of Representatives and taxes|Section Two, Clause 3]] that [[direct taxes]] must be apportioned by state populations.  This clause was also explicitly shielded from constitutional amendment prior to 1808 by [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]].  In 1913, the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|16th Amendment]] exempted all [[income taxes]] from this clause. This overcame the ruling in ''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.]]'' that the income tax could only be applied to regular income and could not be applied to dividends and capital gains. Furthermore, no tax may be imposed on exports from any state. Congress may not, by revenue or commerce legislation, give preference to ports of one state over those of another; neither may it require ships from one state to pay duties in another. All funds belonging to the Treasury may not be withdrawn except according to law. Modern practice is that Congress annually passes a number of [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriations bill]]s authorizing the expenditure of public money. The Constitution requires that a regular statement of such expenditures be published.\n\n===Clause 8: Titles of nobility===\n{{main|Title of Nobility Clause}}\nThe [[Title of Nobility Clause]] prohibits Congress from granting any [[nobility|title of nobility]]. In addition, it specifies that no civil officer may accept, without the consent of Congress, any gift, payment, office or title from a foreign ruler or state.  Emoluments were a profound concern of [[Founding Fathers of the United States|the Founders]].<ref name=impeachable-offenses>{{cite magazine|last1=Feldman|first1=Noah|authorlink1=Noah Feldman|last2=Weisberg|first2=Jacob|authorlink2=Jacob Weisberg|title=What Are Impeachable Offenses?|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/09/28/donald-trump-impeachable-offenses|magazine=The New York Review of Books|date=September 28, 2017|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref> However, a U.S. citizen may receive foreign office before or after their period of public service.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 10}}Section 10: Limits on the States==\n\n==={{anchor|Section 10, Clause 1}}Clause 1: Contract Clause===\n{{main|Contract Clause}}\n\n{{quote|No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit [[Bills of Credit]]; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.}}\nStates may not exercise certain powers reserved for the federal government: they may not enter into treaties, alliances or confederations, grant letters of marque or reprisal, coin money or issue [[bills of credit]] (such as currency). Furthermore, no state may make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts, which expressly forbids any state government (but not the federal government<ref>[http://supreme.justia.com/us/110/421/case.html ''Juilliard v. Greenman''], 110 U.S. 421, 446 (1884).</ref>) from \"making a tender\" (i.e., authorizing something that may be offered in payment<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tender%5B5%5D Definition of '''tender''' as noun, in Merriam-Webster].

Federal Reserve Bank''<ref>262 U.S. 649, 659 (1923). See also ''[[Gwin v. Breedlove]],'' 43 U.S. (2 How.) 29, 38 (1844); and ''[[Griffin v. Thompson]],'' 43 U.S. (2 How.) 244 (1844).</ref>). Much of this clause is devoted to preventing the States from using or creating any currency other than that created by Congress. In ''[[The Federalist Papers|Federalist no. 44]]'', Madison explains that \"it may be observed that the same reasons which shew the necessity of denying to the States the power of regulating coin, prove with equal force that they ought not to be at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin. Had every State a right to regulate the value of its coin, there might be as many different currencies as States; and thus the intercourse among them would be impeded\".<ref>[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_10_1s5.html Madison, James ''Federalist Papers No. 44'']</ref> Moreover, the states may not pass bills of attainder, enact ''ex post facto'' laws, impair the obligation of contracts, or grant titles of nobility.\n\nThe [[Contract Clause]] was the subject of much contentious litigation in the 19th century. It was first interpreted by the Supreme Court in 1810, when ''[[Fletcher v. Peck]]'' was decided. The case involved the [[Yazoo land scandal]], in which the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] legislature authorized the sale of land to speculators at low prices. The bribery involved in the passage of the authorizing legislation was so blatant that a Georgia mob attempted to lynch the corrupt members of the legislature<!--which was basically all of them-->. Following elections, the legislature passed a law that rescinded the contracts granted by the corrupt legislators. The validity of the annulment of the sale was questioned in the Supreme Court. In writing for a unanimous court, Chief Justice John Marshall asked, \"What is a contract?\" His answer was: \"a compact between two or more parties\". Marshall argued that the sale of land by the Georgia legislature, though fraught with corruption, was a valid \"contract\". He added that the state had no right to annul the purchase of the land, since doing so would impair the obligations of contract.\n\nThe definition of a contract propounded by Chief Justice Marshall was not as simple as it may seem. In 1819, the Court considered whether a corporate charter could be construed as a contract. The case of ''[[Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward]]'' involved [[Dartmouth College]], which had been established under a Royal Charter granted by King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. The Charter created a board of twelve trustees for the governance of the College. In 1815, however, [[New Hampshire]] passed a law increasing the board's membership to twenty-one with the aim that public control could be exercised over the College. The Court, including Marshall, ruled that New Hampshire could not amend the charter, which was ruled to be a contract since it conferred \"vested rights\" on the trustees.\n\nThe Marshall Court determined another dispute in ''[[Sturges v. Crowninshield]]''. The case involved a debt that was contracted in early 1811. Later in that year, the state of New York passed a bankruptcy law, under which the debt was later discharged. The Supreme Court ruled that a retroactively applied state bankruptcy law impaired the obligation to pay the debt, and therefore violated the Constitution. In ''[[Ogden v. Saunders]]'' (1827), however, the court decided that state bankruptcy laws ''could'' apply to debts contracted after the passage of the law. State legislation on the issue of bankruptcy and debtor relief has not been much of an issue since the adoption of a comprehensive [[Bankruptcy in the United States|federal bankruptcy law]] in 1898.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 10, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Import-Export Clause===\n{{main|Import-Export Clause}}\n{{quote|No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing it's{{sic}}<!-- Please do not remove the apostrophe in \"it's\".

States may not, without the consent of Congress, tax imports or exports except for the fulfillment of state inspection laws (which may be revised by Congress). The net revenue of the tax is paid not to the state, but to the federal Treasury.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 10, Clause 3}}Clause 3: Compact Clause===\n{{quote|No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.}}\n\nUnder the Compact Clause, states may not, without the consent of Congress, keep troops or armies during times of peace. They may not enter into alliances nor compacts with foreign states, nor engage in war unless invaded. States may, however, organize and arm a militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress. (Article I, Section 8, enumerated powers of Congress.) The [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], whose members are also members of the [[Militia (United States)|militia of the United States]] as defined by {{UnitedStatesCode|10|311}}, fulfill this function, as do persons serving in [[State Defense Forces|State Militias]] with federal oversight under {{UnitedStatesCode|32|109}}.\n\nThe idea of allowing Congress to have say over agreements between states traces back to the numerous controversies that arose between various colonies. Eventually compromises would be created between the two colonies and these compromises would be submitted to [[the Crown]] for approval. After the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[Articles of Confederation]] allowed states to appeal to Congress to settle disputes between the states over boundaries or \"any cause whatever\". The Articles of Confederation also required Congressional approval for \"any treaty or alliance\" in which a state was one of the parties.\n\nThere have been a number of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] cases concerning what constitutes valid congressional consent to an [[interstate compact]].  In ''[[Virginia v. Tennessee]]'', {{ussc|148|503|1893}}, the Court found that some agreements among states stand even when lacking the explicit consent of Congress. (One example the court gave was a state moving some goods from a distant state to itself, it would not require Congressional approval to contract with another state to use its canals for transport.) According to the Court, the Compact Clause requires congressional consent only if the agreement among the states is \"directed to the formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the States, which may encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States\".<ref>{{cite book |title=American Constitutional Law|last=Tribe |first=Laurence | authorlink=Laurence Tribe |year=2000 |publisher=West Publishing Company |isbn=1-56662-714-1 |pages=649\u201351}}</ref> The congressional consent issue is at the center of the current debate over the constitutionality of the not yet [[Coming into force|effective]] [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]] entered into by fifteen states plus the [[District of Columbia]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brody|first1=Michael|title=Circumventing the Electoral College: Why the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact Survives Constitutional Scrutiny Under the Compact Clause|journal=Legislation and Policy Brief|date=February 17, 2013|volume=5|issue=1|pages=40ff|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1043&context=lpb|accessdate=September 11, 2014|publisher=Washington College of Law Journals & Law Reviews at Digital Commons @ American University Washington College of Law}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Peter H.

Under Article One, Congress is a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature consisting of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Article One grants Congress various [[Enumerated powers (United States)|enumerated powers]] and the ability to pass laws \"[[Necessary and Proper Clause|necessary and proper]]\" to carry out those powers. Article One also establishes the procedures for passing a bill and places various limits on the powers of Congress and the [[U.S. state|states]].\n\nArticle One's [[Vesting Clauses|Vesting Clause]] grants all federal legislative power to Congress and establishes that Congress consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate. In combination with the Vesting Clauses of Article Two and Article Three, the Vesting Clause of Article One establishes the [[separation of powers]] among the three branches of the federal government. Section 2 of Article One addresses the House of Representatives, establishing that members of the House are elected every two years, with congressional seats apportioned to the states on the basis of population. Section 2 includes various rules for the House of Representatives, including a provision stating that individuals qualified to vote in elections for the largest chamber of their state's legislature have the right to vote in elections for the House of Representatives. Section 3 addresses the Senate, establishing that the Senate consists of two senators from each state, with each senator serving a six-year term. Section 3 originally required that the state legislatures elect the members of the Senate, but the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]], ratified in 1913, provides for the direct election of senators. Section 3 lays out various other rules for the Senate, including a provision that establishes the [[Vice President of the United States]] as the president of the Senate.\n\nSection 4 of Article One grants the states the power to regulate the congressional election process but establishes that Congress can alter those regulations or make its own regulations. Section 4 also requires Congress to assemble at least once per year. Section 5 lays out various rules for both houses of Congress and grants the House of Representatives and the Senate the power to judge their own elections, determine the qualifications of their own members, and punish or expel their own members. Section 6 establishes the compensation, privileges, and restrictions of those holding congressional office. Section 7 lays out the procedures for passing a bill, requiring both houses of Congress to pass a bill for it to become law, subject to the [[List of United States presidential vetoes|veto power]] of the [[President of the United States]]. Under Section 7, the president can veto a bill, but Congress can override the president's veto with a two-thirds vote of both chambers.\n\nSection 8 lays out the powers of Congress. It includes several enumerated powers, including the power to [[Taxing and Spending Clause|lay and collect taxes and tariffs]] for the \"general welfare\" of the United States, the power to borrow money, the power to [[Commerce Clause|regulate interstate and international commerce]], the power to set [[United States nationality law|naturalization laws]], the power to coin and regulate money, the power to establish [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal courts]] inferior to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], the power to raise and support military forces, and the power to [[Declaration of war by the United States|declare war]]. Section 8 also provides Congress the power to establish a [[Washington, D.C.|federal district]] to serve as the national capital and gives Congress the exclusive power to administer that district. In addition to various enumerated powers, Section 8 grants Congress the power to make laws necessary and proper to carry out its enumerated powers and other powers vested in it. Section 9 places various limits on the power of Congress, banning [[Bill of attainder|bills of attainder]] and other practices. Section 10 places limits on the states, prohibiting them from entering into alliances with foreign powers, [[Contract Clause|impairing contracts]], [[Import-Export Clause|taxing imports or exports]] above the minimum level necessary for inspection, keeping armies, or engaging in war without the consent of Congress.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 1}}Section 1: Legislative power vested in Congress==\n{{main|Vesting Clauses}}\n[[File:C-SPAN 112th Congress Roll Call.jpg|thumb|upright=1.65|Opening of the [[112th United States Congress|112th Congress]] in the House of Representatives chamber, January 5, 2011]]\n{{quote|All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.}}\n\nSection 1 is a [[Vesting Clauses|vesting clause]] that bestows federal [[Legislation|legislative]] power exclusively to Congress.

To facilitate this, the Constitution mandates that a [[United States Census|census]] be conducted every ten years to determine the population of each state and of the nation as a whole and establishes a rule for who shall be counted or excluded from the count. As the new form of government would become operational prior to the completion of a national census, the Constitution also provides for a temporary apportionment of seats.\n\nOriginally, the population of each state and of the nation as a whole was ascertained by adding to the whole number of free Persons, three-fifths the number of all other Persons (i.e. [[slave]]s), but excluding non-taxed [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. This Constitutional rule, known as the [[three-fifths compromise]], was a compromise between Southern and Northern states in which three-fifths of the population of slaves would be counted for [[enumeration]] purposes and for the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives and of taxes among the states. It was, according to [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Joseph Story]] (writing in [[Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States|1833]]), a \"matter of compromise and concession, confessedly unequal in its operation, but a necessary sacrifice to that spirit of conciliation, which was indispensable to the union of states having a great diversity of interests, and physical condition, and political institutions\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2:\u00a7\u00a7 630\u201335, 641\u201347, 673\u201380|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_2_3s22.html|website=The Founder's Constitution|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|ref=Volume 2, Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3, Document 22|page=\u00a7677|year=2000}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the completion of each census, Congress is empowered to use the aggregate population in all the states (according to the prevailing Constitutional rule for determining population) to determine the relative population of each state to the population of the whole, and, based on its calculations, to establish the appropriate size of the House<ref name=prigg>Cf.

To permit the levying of such an income tax, Congress proposed and the states ratified the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]], which removed the restriction by specifically providing that Congress could levy a tax on income \"from whatever source derived\" without it being apportioned among the States or otherwise based on a State's share of the national population.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 2, Clause 4}}Clause 4: Vacancies===\n{{quote|When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such Vacancies.}}\n\nSection two, Clause four, provides that when vacancies occur in the House of Representatives, it is not the job of the House of Representatives to arrange for a replacement, but the job of the State whose vacant seat is up for refilling. Moreover, the State Governor may not appoint a temporary replacement, but must instead arrange for a special election to fill the vacancy.

Also, notably, [[Impeachment process against Richard Nixon|impeachment proceedings]] compelled the resignation of President [[Richard Nixon]].\n\nThe Constitution does not specify how impeachment proceedings are to be initiated. Until the early 20th century, a House member could rise and propose an impeachment, which would then be assigned to a committee for investigation upon a formal resolution vote of the judicial committee. Presently, it is the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]] that initiates the process and then, after investigating the allegations, prepares recommendations for the whole House's consideration. If the House votes to adopt an impeachment resolution, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee recommends a slate of \"managers,\" whom the House subsequently approves by resolution.  These Representatives subsequently become the prosecution team in the impeachment trial in the Senate (see Section 3, Clause 6 below).<ref name=Presser />\n\n=={{anchor|Section 3}}Section 3: Senate==\n\n==={{anchor|Section 3, Clause 1}}Clause 1: Composition; Election of Senators===\n[[File:Standard oil octopus loc color.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Gilded Age]] monopolies could no longer control the U.S. Senate (left) by corrupting state legislatures (right).]]\n{{quote|The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof, for six Years; and each Senator shall have one Vote.}}\n\nThe first Clause of Section Three provides that each state is entitled to have two Senators, who would be elected by its [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] (now by the people of each state), serve for staggered six-year terms, and have one vote each.

It ends by temporarily [[Entrenched clause#United States|shielding]] three Article I clauses from being amended. This clause is among them. (The others are first and fourth clauses in Section 9.) Article Five provides that \"no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.\" Thus, no individual state may have its individual representation in the Senate adjusted without its consent. That is to say, an amendment that changed this clause to provide that all states would get only one Senator (or three Senators, or any other number) could become valid as part of the Constitution if ratified by three-fourths of the states; however, one that provided for some basis of representation other than strict numerical equality (for example, population, wealth, or land area), would require the unanimous consent of all the states.\n\nDenying the states their intended role as joint partners in the federal government by abolishing their [[Equal footing|equality]] in the Senate would, according to [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Salmon P. Chase]] (in ''[[Texas v. White]]''), destroy the grounding of the Union. This Article V provision has been employed by those opposed to contemplated constitutional amendments that would grant the [[District of Columbia]] full representation in the Congress without also granting it statehood. Their argument is that an amendment that would allow a non-state district to have two Senators would deprive the states of their equal suffrage in the Senate and would therefore require unanimous ratification by all the states.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rossum|first1=Ralph Rossum|title=Essays on Article V: Prohibition on Amendment: Equal Suffrage in the Senate|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/5/essays/131/prohibition-on-amendment-equal-suffrage-in-the-senate|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref> Those in favor of the amendment have argued that the States are merely entitled to equal suffrage amongst one another, and that granting the federal district Senate representation does not violate that right.

This was done in May 1789 [[Sortition|by lot]]. It was also decided that each state's Senators would be assigned to two different classes. Those Senators grouped in the first class had their term expire after only two years; those Senators in the second class had their term expire after only four years, instead of six. After this, all Senators from those States have been elected to six-year terms, and as new States have joined the Union, their Senate seats have been assigned to two of the three classes, maintaining each grouping as nearly equal in size as possible. In this way, election is staggered; approximately one-third of the Senate is up for re-election every two years, but the entire body is never up for re-election in the same year (as contrasted with the House, where its entire membership is up for re-election every 2 years).\n\nAs originally established, Senators were elected by the Legislature of the State they represented in the Senate. If a senator died, resigned, or was expelled, the legislature of the state would appoint a replacement to serve out the remainder of the senator's term. If the State Legislature was not in session, its Governor could appoint a temporary replacement to serve until the legislature could elect a permanent replacement. This was superseded by the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]], which provided for the Popular Election of Senators, instead of their appointment by the State Legislature. In a nod to the less populist nature of the Senate, the Amendment tracks the vacancy procedures for the House of Representatives in requiring that the Governor call a special election to fill the vacancy, but (unlike in the House) it vests in the State Legislature the authority to allow the Governor to appoint a temporary replacement until the special election is held. Note, however, that under the original Constitution, the Governors of the states were expressly allowed by the Constitution to make temporary appointments. The current system, under the Seventeenth Amendment, allows Governors to appoint a replacement only if their state legislature has previously decided to allow the Governor to do so; otherwise, the seat must remain vacant until the special election is held to fill the seat, as in the case of a vacancy in the House.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 3, Clause 3}}Clause 3: Qualifications of Senators===\n{{quote|No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.}}\n\nA Senator must be at least 30 years of age, must have been a citizen of the United States for at least nine years before being elected, and must reside in the State they will represent at the time of the election.

The Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to mean that the Senate has exclusive and unreviewable authority to determine what constitutes an adequate impeachment trial.<ref>See ''Nixon'', 506 U.S. at 230\u201331, 233\u201336 (holding that the Senate's sole power to try impeachments made its judgment conclusive as to what constituted an adequate impeachment trial) (\"We think that the word 'sole' is of considerable significance. Indeed, the word 'sole' appears only one other time in the Constitution-with respect to the House of Representatives' \"''sole'' Power of Impeachment.\" The commonsense meaning of the word 'sole' is that the Senate alone shall have authority to determine whether an individual should be acquitted or convicted.

Rehnquist|Chief Justice William Rehnquist]] presiding]]\n\nThe constitution's framers vested the Senate with this power for several reasons. First, they believed Senators would be better educated, more virtuous, and more high-minded than Members of the House of Representatives and thus uniquely able to decide responsibly the most difficult of political questions. Second, they believed that the Senate, being a numerous body, would be well suited to handle the procedural demands of an impeachment trial, in which it, unlike judges and the judiciary system, would \"never be tied down by such strict rules, either in the delineation of the offense by the prosecutor, or in the construction of it by judges, as in the common cases serve to limit the discretion of courts in favor of personal security.\" (Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist No. 65).<ref name=Gerhardt>{{cite web|last1=Gerhardt|first1=Michael J.|title=Essay on Trial of Impeachment|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/17/trial-of-impeachment|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=November 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThere are three Constitutionally mandated requirements for impeachment trials.  The provision that Senators must sit on oath or affirmation was designed to impress upon them the extreme seriousness of the occasion.  The stipulation that the [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] is to preside over presidential impeachment trials underscores the solemnity of the occasion and aims to avoid the conflict of interest of a Vice President's presiding over the proceeding for the removal of the one official standing between them and the presidency. The latter consideration was regarded to be quite important in the eighteenth century - political parties had not yet formed when the Constitution was adopted, and with the original method of electing the President and Vice President it was presumed that the two people elected to those offices would frequently be political rivals. The specification that a two-thirds super-majority vote of those Senators present in order to convict was also thought necessary to facilitate serious deliberation and to make removal possible only through a consensus that cuts across factional divisions.<ref name=Gerhardt/>\n\n==={{anchor|Section 3, Clause 7}}Clause 7: Judgment in cases of impeachment; Punishment on conviction===\n{{quote|Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.}}\n\nIf any officer is convicted on impeachment, he or she is immediately removed from office, and may be barred from holding any public office in the future.

First, it makes clear the division of responsibility with respect to the conduct of the election of federal Senators and Representatives. That responsibility lies primarily with the states and secondarily with Congress. Second, the clause lodges the power to regulate elections in the respective legislative branches of the states and the federal government, not with the executive or judicial.<ref name=APessay>{{cite web|last1=Peacock|first1=Anthony|title=Essays on Article I: Election Regulations|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/19/election-regulations|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref><ref>See ''[[Foster v.

'[T]he regulations made by Congress are paramount to those made by the State legislature; and if they conflict therewith, the latter, so far as the conflict extends, ceases to be operative.' The Clause gives Congress 'comprehensive' authority to regulate the details of elections, including the power to impose 'the numerous requirements as to procedure and safeguards which experience shows are necessary in order to enforce the fundamental right involved.' Congressional authority extends not only to general elections, but also to any 'primary election which involves a necessary step in the choice of candidates for election as representatives in Congress.')

As for regulating the \"manner\" of elections, the Supreme Court has interpreted this to mean \"matters like notices, registration, supervision of voting, protection of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and canvassers, and making and publication of election returns.\"<ref>''[[Cook v.

Congress has, however, required the States to conform to certain practices when drawing districts. States are currently required to use a single-member district scheme, whereby the State is divided into as many election districts for Representatives in the House of Representatives as the size of its representation in that body (that is to say, Representatives cannot be elected at-large from the whole State unless the State has only one Representative in the House, nor can districts elect more than 1 Representative).<ref>{{USC|2|2c}} (2006).</ref> The Supreme Court has interpreted \"by the Legislature thereof\" to include voters using the [[Direct democracy|initiative process]], in those states whose constitutions provide it, to create an independent [[redistricting commission]].<ref>''See [[Arizona State Legislature v.

The act required the two houses of each legislature to meet in joint session on a specified day and to meet every day thereafter until a Senator was selected. The first comprehensive federal statute dealing with elections was adopted in 1870 as a means of enforcing the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment\u2019s]] guarantee against racial discrimination in granting suffrage rights. Under the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]], and subsequent laws, false registration, bribery, voting without legal right, making false returns of votes cast, interference in any manner with officers of election, and the neglect by any such officer of any duty required by state or federal law were made federal offenses. Provision was made for the appointment by federal judges of persons to attend at places of registration and at elections with authority to challenge any person proposing to register or vote unlawfully, to witness the counting of votes, and to identify by their signatures the registration of voters and election tally sheets.<ref name=USC-A&I/>\n\nBeginning with the [[Tillman Act of 1907]], Congress has imposed a growing number of restrictions on [[Campaign finance reform in the United States|elections and campaign financing]]. The most significant piece of legislation has been the 1971 [[Federal Election Campaign Act]]. It was this legislation that was at issue in the Supreme Court's seminal decision, ''[[Buckley v.

The Seventeenth Amendment altered the manner of conducting the elections of Senators; establishing that they are to be elected by the people of the states. Also, the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] prohibits any U.S. citizen from being denied the [[suffrage|right to vote]] on the basis of sex; the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fourth Amendment]] prohibits both Congress and the states from conditioning the right to vote in federal elections on payment of a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] or other types of tax; and the [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-sixth Amendment]] prohibits the states and the federal government from using age as a reason for denying the right to vote to U.S. citizens who are at least eighteen years old.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 4, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Sessions of Congress===\n{{quote|The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.}}\n\nClause 2 fixes an annual date upon which Congress must meet. By doing so, the Constitution empowers Congress to meet, whether or not the President called it into session. [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Calling Congress into extraordinary session; adjourning Congress|Article II, Section 3]] does grant the president limited authority to convene and adjourn both Houses (or either of them) and mandates that it will meet at least once in a year to enact legislation on behalf of the people. Some delegates to the 1787 constitutional convention believed yearly meetings were not necessary, for there would not be enough legislative business for Congress to deal with annually. [[Nathaniel Gorham]] of [[Massachusetts]] argued that the time should be fixed to prevent disputes from arising within the legislature, and to allow the states to adjust their elections to correspond with the fixed date. A fixed date also corresponded to the tradition in the states of having annual meetings. Finally, Gorham concluded that the legislative branch should be required to meet at least once a year to act as a check upon the executive department.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Forte|first1=David F.|title=Essays on Article I: Meetings of Congress Clause|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/20/meetings-of-congress-clause|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref>\n\nAlthough this clause provides that the annual meeting was to be on the first Monday in December, the government established by the 1787 Constitution did not begin operations until March 4, 1789. As the [[1st United States Congress|1st Congress]] held its initial meeting on March 4, that became the date on which new representatives and senators took office in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web|title=March 4: A forgotten huge day in American history|url=http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2013/03/march-4-a-forgotten-huge-day-in-american-politics/|publisher=[[National Constitution Center]]|location=Philadelphia|date=March 4, 2013}}</ref> Therefore, every other year, although a new Congress was elected in November, it did not come into office until the following March, with a \"[[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]]\" session convening in the interim. This practice was altered in 1933 following ratification of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]], which states (in Section 2) that, \"The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall begin at noon on the third day of January, unless they shall by law appoint a different day\". This change virtually eliminated the necessity of there being a lame duck session of Congress.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 5}}Section 5: Procedure==\n<!-- [[United States v.

In practice, the quorum requirement is all but ignored. A quorum is assumed to be present unless a [[quorum call]], requested by a member, proves otherwise. Rarely do members ask for quorum calls to demonstrate the absence of a quorum; more often, they use the quorum call as a delaying tactic.\n\nSometimes, unqualified individuals have been admitted to Congress. For instance, the Senate once admitted [[John Eaton (politician)|John Henry Eaton]], a twenty-eight-year-old, in 1818 (the admission was inadvertent, as Eaton's birth date was unclear at the time). In 1934, a twenty-nine-year-old, [[Rush D. Holt Sr.|Rush Holt]], was elected to the Senate; he agreed to wait six months, until his thirtieth birthday, to take the oath. The Senate ruled in that case that the age requirement applied as of the date of the taking of the oath, not the date of election.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 5, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Rules===\n{{quote|Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a member.}}\nEach House can determine its own Rules (assuming a quorum is present), and may punish any of its members.

Members attending, going to or returning from either House are privileged from arrest, except for [[treason]], [[felony]] or [[breach of the peace]]. One may not sue a Senator or Representative for slander occurring during Congressional debate, nor may speech by a member of Congress during a Congressional session be the basis for criminal prosecution. The latter was affirmed when [[Mike Gravel]] published over 4,000 pages of the ''[[Pentagon Papers]]'' in the ''[[Congressional Record]]'', which might have otherwise been a criminal offense. This clause has also been interpreted in ''[[Gravel v. United States]]'', 408 U.S. 606 (1972) to provide protection to aides and staff of sitting members of Congress, so long as their activities relate to legislative matters.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 6, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Independence from the executive===\n{{Main|Ineligibility Clause}}\n{{See also|Saxbe fix}}\n{{quote|No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.}}\nSenators and Representatives may not simultaneously serve in Congress and hold a position in the executive branch. This restriction is meant to protect legislative independence by preventing the president from using [[patronage]] to buy votes in Congress.<ref name=\"Calabresi\" /> It is a major difference from the political system in the British Parliament, where cabinet ministers are required to be members of parliament.\n\nFurthermore, Senators and Representatives cannot resign to take newly created or higher-paying political positions; rather, they must wait until the conclusion of the term for which they were elected. If Congress increases the salary of a particular officer, it may later reduce that salary to permit an individual to resign from Congress and take that position (known as the [[Saxbe fix]]). The effects of the clause were discussed in 1937, when Senator [[Hugo Black]] was appointed an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court]] with some time left in his Senate term. Just prior to the appointment, Congress had increased the pension available to Justices retiring at the age of seventy. It was therefore suggested by some that the office's emolument had been increased during Black's Senatorial term, and that therefore Black could not take office as a Justice. The response, however, was that Black was fifty-one years old, and would not receive the increased pension until at least 19 years later, long after his Senate term had expired.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 7}}Section 7: Bills==\n\n==={{anchor|Section 7, Clause 1}}Clause 1: Bills of revenue===\n{{main|Origination Clause|l1=Bills of Revenue}}\n{{quote|All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.}}\nThis establishes the method for making [[Act of Congress|Acts of Congress]] that involve taxation.

The clause was part of the [[Connecticut Compromise|Great Compromise]] between small and large states; the large states were unhappy with the lopsided power of small states in the Senate, and so the clause theoretically offsets the unrepresentative nature of the Senate, and compensates the large states for allowing equal voting rights to Senators from small states.<ref>Jensen, Erik and Monaghan, Henry.

If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.}}\nThis clause is known as the [[Presentment Clause]]. Before a bill becomes law, it must be presented to the President, who has ten days (excluding Sundays) to act upon it. If the President signs the bill, it becomes law. If he disapproves of the bill, he must return it to the House in which it originated together with his objections. This procedure has become known as the [[veto]], although that particular word does not appear in the text of Article One. The bill does not then become law unless both Houses, by two-thirds votes, override the veto. If the President neither signs nor returns the bill within the ten-day limit, the bill becomes law, unless the Congress has adjourned in the meantime, thereby preventing the President from returning the bill to the House in which it originated. In the latter case, the President, by taking no action on the bill towards the end of a session, exercises a \"[[pocket veto]]\", which Congress may not override. In the former case, where the President allows a bill to become law unsigned, there is no common name for the practice, but recent scholarship has termed it a \"default enactment.\"<ref>See Ross Wilson, A Third Way: The Presidential Non-Signing Statement, http://ssrn.com/abstract=1593862</ref>\n\nWhat exactly constitutes an adjournment for the purposes of the pocket veto has been unclear. In the ''[[Pocket Veto Case]]'' (1929), the Supreme Court held that \"the determinative question in reference to an 'adjournment' is not whether it is a final adjournment of Congress or an interim adjournment, such as an adjournment of the first session, but whether it is one that 'prevents' the President from returning the bill to the House in which it originated within the time allowed.\" Since neither House of Congress was in session, the President could not return the bill to one of them, thereby permitting the use of the pocket veto. In ''[[Wright v. United States]]'' (1938), however, the Court ruled that adjournments of one House only did not constitute an adjournment of Congress required for a pocket veto. In such cases, the Secretary or Clerk of the House in question was ruled competent to receive the bill.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 7, Clause 3}}Clause 3: Presidential veto===\n{{quote|Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.}}\n\nIn 1996, Congress passed the [[Line Item Veto Act of 1996|Line Item Veto Act]], which permitted the President, at the time of the signing of the bill, to rescind certain expenditures. The Congress could disapprove the cancellation and reinstate the funds. The President could veto the disapproval, but the Congress, by a two-thirds vote in each House, could override the veto. In the case ''[[Clinton v. City of New York]]'', the Supreme Court found the Line Item Veto Act unconstitutional because it violated the Presentment clause. First, the procedure delegated legislative powers to the President, thereby violating the nondelegation doctrine. Second, the procedure violated the terms of Section Seven, which state, \"if he approve [the bill] he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it.\" Thus, the President may sign the bill, veto it, or do nothing, but he may not amend the bill and then sign it.\n\nEvery bill, order, resolution, or vote that must be passed by both Houses, except on a question of adjournment, must be presented to the President before becoming law. However, to propose a constitutional amendment, two-thirds of both Houses may submit it to the states for the ratification, without any consideration by the President, as prescribed in [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]].\n\nSome Presidents have made very extensive use of the veto, while others have not used it at all. [[Grover Cleveland]], for instance, vetoed over four hundred bills during his first term in office; Congress overrode only two of those vetoes. Meanwhile, seven Presidents have never used the veto power. There have been 2,560 vetoes, including [[pocket veto]]es.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/Legislation/Vetoes/BushGW.htm |title=U.S. Senate: Reference Home &gt; Statistics &amp; Lists &gt; Vetoes by President George W.

Most notably, Clauses 1 (the General Welfare or Taxing and Spending clause), 3 (the Commerce clause), and 18 (The Necessary and Proper clause) have been deemed to grant expansive powers to Congress. These three clauses have been interpreted so broadly that the federal government of the United States exercises many powers that are not expressly delegated to it by the states under the Constitution. Some point to the various social programs of the American [[welfare state#United States|welfare state]] as a prime example, and not all agree with this broad interpretation. [[James Madison]], who wrote much of the Constitution, asserted that Congress could not exercise powers unless they were expressly granted in the Constitution.  While he was President of the United States, Madison [[veto]]ed the Federal Public Works Bill of 1817, calling it unconstitutional, since in his view the federal government did not have the authority to [[Internal improvements|build infrastructure]].<ref>{{cite web|title=James Madison - Veto of federal public works bill of March 3, 1817|url=http://www.constitution.org/jm/18170303_veto.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105014440/http://www.constitution.org/jm/18170303_veto.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 5, 2018|accessdate= November 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://edsitement.neh.gov/sites/edsitement.neh.gov/files/worksheets/VetoMsg.pdf |title=Excerpt from James Madison\u2019s Veto Message: March 3, 1817 |access-date=March 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430011150/https://edsitement.neh.gov/sites/edsitement.neh.gov/files/worksheets/VetoMsg.pdf |archive-date=April 30, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/presvetoes17891988.pdf Presidential Vetoes, 1789\u20131988, p. 34]</ref>\n\n===Clause 1: the General Welfare Clause===\nThis clause is also referred to as the Spending Clause and the Taxing and Spending Clause.<ref>{{cite web|title= |url=https://constitutionallawreporter.com/taxing-and-spending-clause/|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> It states that Congress may lay and collect taxes for the \"common defense\" or \"general welfare\" of the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court has not often defined \"general welfare,\" leaving the [[political question]] to Congress. In ''[[United States v. Butler]]'' (1936), the Court for the first time construed the clause. The dispute centered on a tax collected from processors of agricultural products such as meat; the funds raised by the tax were not paid into the general funds of the treasury, but were rather specially earmarked for farmers. The Court struck down the tax, ruling that the general welfare language in the Taxing and Spending Clause related only to \"matters of national, as distinguished from local, welfare\". Congress continues to make expansive use of the [[Taxing and Spending Clause]]; for instance, the [[social security]] program is authorized under the Taxing and Spending Clause.\n\n===Clause 2: Borrowing Power===\nCongress has the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States. In 1871, when deciding ''[[Knox v. Lee]],'' the Court ruled that this clause permitted Congress to emit bills and make them legal tender in satisfaction of debts. Whenever Congress borrows money, it is obligated to repay the sum as stipulated in the original agreement. However, such agreements are only \"binding on the conscience of the sovereign\", as the doctrine of [[sovereign immunity]] prevents a creditor from suing in court if the government reneges on its commitment.<ref>See ''e.g.'' Perry v. United States, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3388791031923623137 294 U.S. 330 (1935).]</ref>\n\n===Clause 3: Commerce Clause===\n[[File:John Marshall by Henry Inman, 1832.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] established a broad interpretation of the Commerce Clause.]]\n{{Main|Commerce Clause}}\n{{quote|The Congress shall have Power [...] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;}}\nThe Supreme Court has seldom restrained the use of the ''[[commerce clause]]'' for widely varying purposes. The first important decision related to the commerce clause was ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'', decided by a unanimous Court in 1824. The case involved conflicting federal and state laws: [[Thomas Gibbons (politician)|Thomas Gibbons]] had a federal permit to navigate steamboats in the [[Hudson River]], while the other, [[Aaron Ogden]], had a monopoly to do the same granted by the state of New York. Ogden contended that \"commerce\" included only buying and selling of goods and not their transportation. Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] rejected this notion. Marshall suggested that \"commerce\" included navigation of goods, and that it \"must have been contemplated\" by the Framers. Marshall added that Congress's power over commerce \"is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution\".\n\nThe expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause was restrained during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' attitude dominated the Court. In ''[[United States v. E. C. Knight Company]]'' (1895), the Supreme Court limited the newly enacted [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], which had sought to break up the monopolies dominating the nation's economy. The Court ruled that Congress could not regulate the manufacture of goods, even if they were later shipped to other states. Chief Justice Melville Fuller wrote, \"commerce succeeds to manufacture, and is not a part of it.\"\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court sometimes ruled [[New Deal]] programs unconstitutional because they stretched the meaning of the commerce clause. In ''[[Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States]],'' (1935) the Court unanimously struck down industrial codes regulating the slaughter of poultry, declaring that Congress could not regulate commerce relating to the poultry, which had \"come to a permanent rest within the State.\" As Chief Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]] put it, \"so far as the poultry here in question is concerned, the flow of interstate commerce has ceased.\" Judicial rulings against attempted use of Congress's Commerce Clause powers continued during the 1930s.\n\nIn 1937, the Supreme Court began moving away from its laissez-faire attitude concerning Congressional legislation and the Commerce Clause, when it ruled in ''[[National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Company]]'', that the [[National Labor Relations Act]] of 1935 (commonly known as the Wagner Act) was constitutional. The legislation under scrutiny prevented employers from engaging in \"[[unfair labor practice]]s\" such as firing workers for joining [[labor union|unions]]. In sustaining this act, the Court signaled its return to the philosophy espoused by John Marshall, that Congress could pass laws regulating actions that even indirectly influenced interstate commerce.\n\nThis new attitude became firmly set into place in 1942. In ''[[Wickard v. Filburn]]'', the Court ruled that production quotas under the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938]] were constitutionally applied to agricultural production (in this instance, home-grown wheat for private consumption) that was consumed purely intrastate, because its effect upon interstate commerce placed it within the power of Congress to regulate under the Commerce Clause. This decision marked the beginning of the Court's total deference to Congress' claims of Commerce Clause powers, which lasted into the 1990s.\n\n''[[United States v. Lopez]]'' (1995) was the first decision in six decades to invalidate a federal statute on the grounds that it exceeded the power of the Congress under the Commerce Clause. The Court held that while Congress had broad lawmaking authority under the Commerce Clause, the power was limited, and did not extend so far from \"commerce\" as to authorize the regulation of the carrying of [[handgun]]s, especially when there was no evidence that carrying them affected the economy on a massive scale. In a later case, ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'' (2000), the justices ruled that Congress could not make such laws even when there was evidence of aggregate effect.\n\nIn contrast to these rulings, the Supreme Court also continues to follow the precedent set by ''Wickard v. Filburn''. In ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' it ruled that the Commerce Clause granted Congress the authority to criminalize the production and use of home-grown [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] even where states approve its use for [[medical cannabis|medicinal purposes]]. The court held that, as with the agricultural production in the earlier case, home-grown cannabis is a legitimate subject of federal regulation because it competes with marijuana that moves in interstate commerce.\n\n===Clause 18: Implied Powers of Congress===\n====Other powers of Congress====\n[[File:USS Bon Homme Richard (CVA-31) underway in the Gulf of Tonkin on 2 November 1964.jpg|thumb| alt=Aircraft carrier at sea.|Congress authorizes defense spending such as the purchase of the [[USS Bon Homme Richard (CV-31)|USS ''Bon Homme Richard'']].]]\n\nCongress may establish uniform laws relating to [[naturalization]] and [[bankruptcy]]. It may also coin money, regulate the value of American or foreign currency and punish counterfeiters. Congress may fix the standards of weights and measures. Furthermore, Congress may establish [[Postal Clause|post offices and post roads]] (the roads, however, need not be exclusively for the conveyance of mail). Congress may promote the progress of science and useful arts by granting [[United States copyright law|copyrights]] and [[United States patent law|patents]] of limited duration. Section eight, clause eight of Article One, known as the [[Copyright Clause]], is the only instance of the word \"right\" used in the original constitution (though the word does appear in several Amendments).<ref>[[Michael Novak|Novak, Michael]] (1996). The fire of invention, the fuel of interest: On intellectual property. Washington D.C.: The American Enterprise Institute Press.</ref> Though perpetual copyrights and patents are prohibited, the Supreme Court has ruled in ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]'' (2003) that repeated extensions to the term of copyright do not constitute perpetual copyright; also note that this is the only power granted where the means to accomplish its stated purpose is specifically provided for. Courts inferior to the Supreme Court may be established by Congress.\n\nCongress has several powers related to war and the armed forces. Under the [[War Powers Clause]], only Congress may declare war, but in several cases it has, without declaring war, granted the President the authority to engage in military conflicts. Five wars have been declared in United States' history: the [[War of 1812]], the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. Some historians argue that the legal doctrines and legislation passed during the operations against [[Pancho Villa]] constitute a sixth declaration of war. Congress may grant [[letter of marque|letters of marque]] and [[reprisal]]. Congress may establish and support the armed forces, but no appropriation made for the support of the army may be used for more than two years. This provision was inserted because the Framers feared the establishment of a standing army, beyond civilian control, during peacetime. Congress may regulate or call forth the state militias, but the states retain the authority to appoint officers and train personnel. Congress also has exclusive power to make rules and regulations governing the land and naval forces. Although the executive branch and the Pentagon have asserted an ever-increasing measure of involvement in this process, the U.S. Supreme Court has often reaffirmed Congress's exclusive hold on this power (e.g. Burns v. Wilson, 346 U.S. 137 (1953)). Congress used this power twice soon after World War II with the enactment of two statutes: the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] to improve the quality and fairness of courts martial and military justice, and the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]] which among other rights had allowed military service persons to sue for damages until the U.S. Supreme Court repealed that section of the statute in a divisive series of cases, known collectively as the [[Feres v. United States|Feres Doctrine]].\n\nCongress has the exclusive right to legislate \"in all cases whatsoever\" for the nation's capital, the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. Congress chooses to devolve some of such authority to the elected [[Mayor of Washington, D.C.|mayor]] and [[Council of the District of Columbia|council]] of District of Columbia. Nevertheless, Congress remains free to enact any legislation for the District so long as constitutionally permissible, to overturn any legislation by the city government, and technically to revoke the city government at any time. Congress may also exercise such jurisdiction over land purchased from the states for the erection of forts and other buildings.\n\n====Necessary and Proper====\n{{Main|Necessary and Proper Clause}}\n{{quote|The Congress shall have Power [...] To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.}}\nFinally, Congress has the power to do whatever is \"necessary and proper\" to carry out its enumerated powers and, crucially, all others vested in it. This has been interpreted to authorize criminal prosecution of those whose actions have a \"substantial effect\" on interstate commerce in ''Wickard v. Filburn''; however, [[Thomas Jefferson]], in the [[Kentucky Resolutions]], supported by [[James Madison]], maintained that a penal power could not be inferred from a power to regulate, and that the only penal powers were for [[treason]], [[counterfeiting]], [[piracy]] and [[felony]] on the [[high seas]], and offenses against the [[law of nations]].\n\nThe necessary and proper clause has been interpreted extremely broadly, thereby giving Congress wide latitude in legislation. The first landmark case involving the clause was ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'' (1819), which involved the establishment of a [[Second Bank of the United States|national bank]]. [[Alexander Hamilton]], in advocating the creation of the bank, argued that there was \"a more or less direct\" relationship between the bank and \"the powers of collecting taxes, borrowing money, regulating trade between the states, and raising and maintaining fleets and navies\". [[Thomas Jefferson]] countered that Congress's powers \"can all be carried into execution without a national bank. A bank therefore is not necessary, and consequently not authorized by this phrase\". Chief Justice John Marshall agreed with the former interpretation. Marshall wrote that a Constitution listing ''all'' of Congress's powers \"would partake of a prolixity of a legal code and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind\". Since the Constitution could not possibly enumerate the \"minor ingredients\" of the powers of Congress, Marshall \"deduced\" that Congress had the authority to establish a bank from the \"great outlines\" of the general welfare, commerce and other clauses. Under this doctrine of the necessary and proper clause, Congress has sweepingly broad powers (known as [[implied powers]]) not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution. However, the Congress cannot enact laws solely on the implied powers, any action must be necessary and proper in the execution of the enumerated powers.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 9}}Section 9: Limits on Congress==\n\nThe ninth section of Article One places limits on Congress' powers:\n\n{{quote|The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a Tax or duty may be imposed on such Importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each Person.\n\nThe Privilege of the Writ of ''[[wiktionary:habeas corpus|Habeas Corpus]]'' shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\n\nNo [[Bill of attainder]] or ex post facto Law shall be passed.\n\nNo [[Poll tax|Capitation]], or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.\n\nNo Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.\n\nNo Preference shall be given by any Regulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of another: nor shall Vessels bound to, or from, one State, be obliged to enter, clear, or pay Duties in another.\n\nNo Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.\n\nNo Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, [[wiktionary:emolument#Noun|Emolument]], Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.}}\n\n===Clause 1: Slave trade===\n[[File:Africa and the American Flag.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|U.S. brig ''[[USS Perry (1843)|Perry]]'' confronting the slave ship ''Martha'' off [[Ambriz]] on June 6, 1850]]\nThe first clause in this section prevents Congress from passing any law that would restrict the [[slave trade|importation of slaves]] into the United States prior to 1808.  Congress could however, levy a ''[[per capita]]'' duty of up to ten [[Spanish dollar|Spanish milled dollars]] for each slave imported into the country.  This clause was further [[entrenched clause#United States|entrenched]] into the Constitution by [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]], where it is explicitly shielded from constitutional amendment prior to 1808.  On March 2, 1807, Congress approved legislation [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|prohibiting the importation of slaves]] into the United States, which went into effect January 1, 1808, the first day of the prohibition permitted by the Constitution.\n\n===Clauses 2 and 3: Civil and legal protections===\nA writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' is a legal action against unlawful detainment that commands a law enforcement agency or other body that has a person in custody to have a court inquire into the legality of the detention. The court may order the person released if the reason for detention is deemed insufficient or unjustifiable. The Constitution further provides that the privilege of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' may not be suspended \"unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it\". In ''[[Ex parte Milligan]]'' (1866), the Supreme Court ruled that the suspension of ''habeas corpus'' in a time of war was lawful, but military tribunals did not apply to citizens in states that had upheld the authority of the Constitution and where civilian courts were still operating.\n\nA [[bill of attainder]] is a law by which a person is immediately convicted without trial. An ''[[ex post facto]]'' law is a law which applies retroactively, punishing someone for an act that was only made criminal after it was done. The ''ex post facto'' clause does not apply to civil matters.<ref>[[Calder v. Bull]], 3 U.S. 386, 399-400 (1798).</ref>\n\n===Clauses 4-7: Apportionment of direct taxes===\nSection Nine reiterates the provision from [[#Clause 3: Apportionment of Representatives and taxes|Section Two, Clause 3]] that [[direct taxes]] must be apportioned by state populations.  This clause was also explicitly shielded from constitutional amendment prior to 1808 by [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]].  In 1913, the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|16th Amendment]] exempted all [[income taxes]] from this clause. This overcame the ruling in ''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.]]'' that the income tax could only be applied to regular income and could not be applied to dividends and capital gains. Furthermore, no tax may be imposed on exports from any state. Congress may not, by revenue or commerce legislation, give preference to ports of one state over those of another; neither may it require ships from one state to pay duties in another. All funds belonging to the Treasury may not be withdrawn except according to law. Modern practice is that Congress annually passes a number of [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriations bill]]s authorizing the expenditure of public money. The Constitution requires that a regular statement of such expenditures be published.\n\n===Clause 8: Titles of nobility===\n{{main|Title of Nobility Clause}}\nThe [[Title of Nobility Clause]] prohibits Congress from granting any [[nobility|title of nobility]]. In addition, it specifies that no civil officer may accept, without the consent of Congress, any gift, payment, office or title from a foreign ruler or state.  Emoluments were a profound concern of [[Founding Fathers of the United States|the Founders]].<ref name=impeachable-offenses>{{cite magazine|last1=Feldman|first1=Noah|authorlink1=Noah Feldman|last2=Weisberg|first2=Jacob|authorlink2=Jacob Weisberg|title=What Are Impeachable Offenses?|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/09/28/donald-trump-impeachable-offenses|magazine=The New York Review of Books|date=September 28, 2017|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref> However, a U.S. citizen may receive foreign office before or after their period of public service.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 10}}Section 10: Limits on the States==\n\n==={{anchor|Section 10, Clause 1}}Clause 1: Contracts Clause===\n{{further|Contract Clause|Bills of Credit}}\n{{quote|No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.}}\nStates may not exercise certain powers reserved for the federal government: they may not enter into treaties, alliances or confederations, grant letters of marque or reprisal, coin money or issue [[bills of credit]] (such as currency). Furthermore, no state may make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts, which expressly forbids any state government (but not the federal government<ref>[http://supreme.justia.com/us/110/421/case.html ''Juilliard v. Greenman''], 110 U.S. 421, 446 (1884).</ref>) from \"making a tender\" (i.e., authorizing something that may be offered in payment<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tender%5B5%5D Definition of '''tender''' as noun, in Merriam-Webster]. Retrieved January 23, 2011.</ref>) of any type or form of [[money]] to meet any financial obligation,<ref>''\"Any\"'' financial obligation would ''de facto'' include financial obligations owed either ''by'' or ''to'' the state; see [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/any?show=0&t=1295805841 definition of ''\"any\"'' as noun (5), in Merriam-Webster]</ref> unless that form of money is coins made of gold or silver (or a medium of exchange backed by and redeemable in gold or silver coins, as noted in ''Farmers & Merchants Bank v. Federal Reserve Bank''<ref>262 U.S. 649, 659 (1923). See also ''[[Gwin v. Breedlove]],'' 43 U.S. (2 How.) 29, 38 (1844); and ''[[Griffin v. Thompson]],'' 43 U.S. (2 How.) 244 (1844).</ref>). Much of this clause is devoted to preventing the States from using or creating any currency other than that created by Congress. In ''[[The Federalist Papers|Federalist no. 44]]'', Madison explains that \"it may be observed that the same reasons which shew the necessity of denying to the States the power of regulating coin, prove with equal force that they ought not to be at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin. Had every State a right to regulate the value of its coin, there might be as many different currencies as States; and thus the intercourse among them would be impeded\".<ref>[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_10_1s5.html Madison, James ''Federalist Papers No. 44'']</ref> Moreover, the states may not pass bills of attainder, enact ''ex post facto'' laws, impair the obligation of contracts, or grant titles of nobility.\n\nThe [[Contract Clause]] was the subject of much contentious litigation in the 19th century. It was first interpreted by the Supreme Court in 1810, when ''[[Fletcher v. Peck]]'' was decided. The case involved the [[Yazoo land scandal]], in which the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] legislature authorized the sale of land to speculators at low prices. The bribery involved in the passage of the authorizing legislation was so blatant that a Georgia mob attempted to lynch the corrupt members of the legislature<!--which was basically all of them-->. Following elections, the legislature passed a law that rescinded the contracts granted by the corrupt legislators. The validity of the annulment of the sale was questioned in the Supreme Court. In writing for a unanimous court, Chief Justice John Marshall asked, \"What is a contract?\" His answer was: \"a compact between two or more parties\". Marshall argued that the sale of land by the Georgia legislature, though fraught with corruption, was a valid \"contract\". He added that the state had no right to annul the purchase of the land, since doing so would impair the obligations of contract.\n\nThe definition of a contract propounded by Chief Justice Marshall was not as simple as it may seem. In 1819, the Court considered whether a corporate charter could be construed as a contract. The case of ''[[Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward]]'' involved [[Dartmouth College]], which had been established under a Royal Charter granted by King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. The Charter created a board of twelve trustees for the governance of the College. In 1815, however, [[New Hampshire]] passed a law increasing the board's membership to twenty-one with the aim that public control could be exercised over the College. The Court, including Marshall, ruled that New Hampshire could not amend the charter, which was ruled to be a contract since it conferred \"vested rights\" on the trustees.\n\nThe Marshall Court determined another dispute in ''[[Sturges v. Crowninshield]]''. The case involved a debt that was contracted in early 1811. Later in that year, the state of New York passed a bankruptcy law, under which the debt was later discharged. The Supreme Court ruled that a retroactively applied state bankruptcy law impaired the obligation to pay the debt, and therefore violated the Constitution. In ''[[Ogden v. Saunders]]'' (1827), however, the court decided that state bankruptcy laws ''could'' apply to debts contracted after the passage of the law. State legislation on the issue of bankruptcy and debtor relief has not been much of an issue since the adoption of a comprehensive [[Bankruptcy in the United States|federal bankruptcy law]] in 1898.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 10, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Import-Export Clause===\n{{main|Import-Export Clause}}\n{{quote|No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing it's{{sic}}<!-- Please do not remove the apostrophe in \"it's\". That is how it is spelled in the original document. --> inspection Laws: and the net Produce of all Duties and Imposts, laid by any State on Imports or Exports, shall be for the Use of the Treasury of the United States; and all such Laws shall be subject to the Revision and Controul{{sic}} of the Congress.}}\nStill more powers are prohibited of the states. States may not, without the consent of Congress, tax imports or exports except for the fulfillment of state inspection laws (which may be revised by Congress). The net revenue of the tax is paid not to the state, but to the federal Treasury.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 10, Clause 3}}Clause 3: Compact Clause===\n{{quote|No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.}}\n\nUnder the Compact Clause, states may not, without the consent of Congress, keep troops or armies during times of peace. They may not enter into alliances nor compacts with foreign states, nor engage in war unless invaded. States may, however, organize and arm a militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress. (Article I, Section 8, enumerated powers of Congress.) The [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], whose members are also members of the [[Militia (United States)|militia of the United States]] as defined by {{UnitedStatesCode|10|311}}, fulfill this function, as do persons serving in [[State Defense Forces|State Militias]] with federal oversight under {{UnitedStatesCode|32|109}}.\n\nThe idea of allowing Congress to have say over agreements between states traces back to the numerous controversies that arose between various colonies. Eventually compromises would be created between the two colonies and these compromises would be submitted to [[the Crown]] for approval. After the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[Articles of Confederation]] allowed states to appeal to Congress to settle disputes between the states over boundaries or \"any cause whatever\". The Articles of Confederation also required Congressional approval for \"any treaty or alliance\" in which a state was one of the parties.\n\nThere have been a number of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] cases concerning what constitutes valid congressional consent to an [[interstate compact]].  In ''[[Virginia v. Tennessee]]'', {{ussc|148|503|1893}}, the Court found that some agreements among states stand even when lacking the explicit consent of Congress. (One example the court gave was a state moving some goods from a distant state to itself, it would not require Congressional approval to contract with another state to use its canals for transport.) According to the Court, the Compact Clause requires congressional consent only if the agreement among the states is \"directed to the formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the States, which may encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States\".<ref>{{cite book |title=American Constitutional Law|last=Tribe |first=Laurence | authorlink=Laurence Tribe |year=2000 |publisher=West Publishing Company |isbn=1-56662-714-1 |pages=649\u201351}}</ref> The congressional consent issue is at the center of the current debate over the constitutionality of the not yet [[Coming into force|effective]] [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]] entered into by fifteen states plus the [[District of Columbia]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brody|first1=Michael|title=Circumventing the Electoral College: Why the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact Survives Constitutional Scrutiny Under the Compact Clause|journal=Legislation and Policy Brief|date=February 17, 2013|volume=5|issue=1|pages=40ff|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1043&context=lpb|accessdate=September 11, 2014|publisher=Washington College of Law Journals & Law Reviews at Digital Commons @ American University Washington College of Law}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Peter H.

In the 1960s, international business courses were introduced and soon became an important focus of the school's curriculum. The New York University, Graduate School of Business Administration, C.J. Devine Institute of Finance (1959\u20131966) published many key Finance and Investment bulletins related to International finance. The school awarded its first Doctor of Commercial Sciences degree in 1970.\n<!--a series of publications followed...

Stern (B.S., 1957; M.B.A., 1959) allowed the school to consolidate its graduate and undergraduate facilities at NYU's Washington Square campus. The school was renamed Leonard N. Stern School of Business. In 1992, Stern's new $68 million state-of-the-art facility, now known as Kaufman Management Center, was inaugurated.\n\nIn 1998, a $10 million gift from [[Henry Kaufman]] (PhD 1958) supported a major expansion and upgrading of Stern's facilities. The new and renovated space is used almost exclusively to improve the quality of student life. Prominent investment banker and Home Depot investor [[Kenneth Langone]] (MBA 1960) donated $10 million to Stern in 1999. The Langone MBA for Working Professionals was renamed in his honor. Celebrating its 100th birthday in the year 2000, Stern launched a $100 million centennial campaign, the school's most ambitious fundraising effort to date. The campaign doubled the school's endowment, the number of named professorships, and the level of student financial aid.\n\n[[Peter Blair Henry]] became dean of the school in January 2010.<ref name=ft20100221>{{cite news|last=Murray|first=Sarah|title=The bigger picture|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/703f0e20-1d74-11df-a893-00144feab49a.html#axzz2E8r07iXd|accessdate=December 4, 2012|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=February 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the {{convert|84500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} renovation of the three Stern School of Business buildings, known as the Stern Concourse Project, was completed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Light, transparency and brand connect Stern students, faculty and New York City|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&upload_id=13465|publisher=World Architecture News.com|accessdate=December 24, 2012|date=February 24, 2010}}</ref>  This project was fully funded by donors, alumni and corporate partners.<ref>{{cite web|title=Concourse Project|url=http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/concourse/index.html|publisher=New York University|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\nNYU Stern Westchester offers its Langone MBA for Working Professionals in [[Purchase, New York]], at [[State University of New York at Purchase|SUNY Purchase]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.nyu.edu/programs-admissions/part-time-mba-westchester/index.htm |title=NYU Stern &#124; Part-time MBA Westchester &#124; Home |publisher=Stern.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-05}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n{{Infobox business school rankings\n| QSglobal = 19\n| BI = 16\n| Economist = 19\n| FT = 19\n| BWg = 17\n| Forbes = 18\n| USNWRg = 10\n| Vault = 9\n| USNWRu = 5\n}}\n\nAs of 2009, 2,305 students are enrolled in Stern's undergraduate program and 2,969 are enrolled in its [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) program.

He put together the album by the request of his mother, who enjoyed religious music. Jackson considered this album a \"side project\" and nothing too official, but it was ultimately treated as such. More than 1.8 million units were eventually sold.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nJust a few months later, Jackson released his next album, ''[[Like Red on a Rose]]''. Originally intended to be a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] album, ''Like Red on a Rose'' had a different producer and sound. [[Keith Stegall]], was notably absent from this album and instead, [[Alison Krauss]] took over the producing reins. Unlike Jackson's previous albums, the album abandoned Jackson's typical neotraditional country style and instead, went for a [[soft rock]]/[[adult contemporary]] sound. This move proved controversial for his fans, who accused him of abandoning his signature style in order to go for a more commercial pop route. Although critically acclaimed, the album was considered a commercial disappointment for the singer. For his next album, he went back to his country roots. ''[[Good Time (album)|Good Time]]'' was released on March 4, 2008. The album's first single, \"[[Small Town Southern Man]]\", was released to radio on November 19, 2007. \"[[Country Boy (Alan Jackson song)|Country Boy]]\", \"[[Good Time (Alan Jackson song)|Good Time]]\", \"[[Sissy's Song]]\" and \"[[I Still Like Bologna]]\", were also released as singles. \"[[Sissy's Song]]\" is dedicated to a longtime friend of the Jackson family (Leslie \"Sissy\" Fitzgerald) who worked in their house every day. Fitzgerald was killed in a motorcycle accident in mid-2007.\n\n===2010s===\nHis sixteenth studio album,  ''[[Freight Train (album)|Freight Train]]'', was released on March 30, 2010. The first single was \"[[It's Just That Way]]\", which debuted at No.&nbsp;50 in January 2010. \"[[Hard Hat and a Hammer]]\" is the album's second single, released in May 2010. On November 23, 2010, Jackson released another greatest hits package, entitled ''[[34 Number Ones]]'', which features a cover of the [[Johnny Cash]] hit \"[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]\", as well as the duet with [[Zac Brown Band]], \"[[As She's Walking Away]]\".

He put together the album by the request of his mother, who enjoyed religious music. Jackson considered this album a \"side project\" and nothing too official, but it was ultimately treated as such. More than 1.8 million units were eventually sold.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nJust a few months later, Jackson released his next album, ''[[Like Red on a Rose]]''. Originally intended to be a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] album, ''Like Red on a Rose'' had a different producer and sound. [[Keith Stegall]], was notably absent from this album and instead, [[Alison Krauss]] took over the producing reins. Unlike Jackson's previous albums, the album abandoned Jackson's typical neotraditional country style and instead, went for a [[soft rock]]/[[adult contemporary]] sound. This move proved controversial for his fans, who accused him of abandoning his signature style in order to go for a more commercial pop route. Although critically acclaimed, the album was considered a commercial disappointment for the singer. For his next album, he went back to his country roots. ''[[Good Time (album)|Good Time]]'' was released on March 4, 2008. The album's first single, \"[[Small Town Southern Man]]\", was released to radio on November 19, 2007. \"[[Country Boy (Alan Jackson song)|Country Boy]]\", \"[[Good Time (Alan Jackson song)|Good Time]]\", \"[[Sissy's Song]]\" and \"[[I Still Like Bologna]]\", were also released as singles. \"[[Sissy's Song]]\" is dedicated to a longtime friend of the Jackson family (Leslie \"Sissy\" Fitzgerald) who worked in their house every day.

On November 23, 2010, Jackson released another greatest hits package, entitled ''[[34 Number Ones]]'', which features a cover of the [[Johnny Cash]] hit \"[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]\", as well as the duet with [[Zac Brown Band]], \"[[As She's Walking Away]]\".

It was released as a single in June 1971, reaching the top 10 in the UK, while the full eight-and-a-half-minute version appears as the final track on the band's 1971 album ''[[Who's Next]]'', released that August.\n\nTownshend wrote the song as a closing number of the [[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]] project, and the lyrics criticise revolution and power. To symbolise the spiritual connection he had found in music via the works of [[Meher Baba]] and [[Inayat Khan]], he programmed a mixture of human traits into a [[synthesizer]] and used it as the main backing instrument throughout the song. The Who tried recording the song in New York in March 1971, but re-recorded a superior take at [[Stargroves]] the next month using the synthesizer from Townshend's original demo. Ultimately, Lifehouse as a project was abandoned in favour of ''Who's Next'', a straightforward album, where it also became the closing track. It has been performed as a staple of the band's setlist since 1971, often as the set closer, and was the last song drummer [[Keith Moon]] played live with the band.\n\nAs well as a hit, the song has achieved critical praise, appearing as one of ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]. It has been covered by several artists, such as [[Van Halen]] who took their version to No.&nbsp;1 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Album Rock Tracks]] chart. It has been used for several TV shows and films, and in some political campaigns.\n\n==Background==\nThe song was originally intended for a [[rock opera]] Townshend had been working on, [[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]], which was a multi-media exercise based on his followings of the Indian religious [[avatar]] [[Meher Baba]], showing how spiritual enlightenment could be obtained via a combination of band and audience.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=273}} The song was written for the end of the opera, after the main character, Bobby, is killed and the \"universal chord\" is sounded. The main characters disappear, leaving behind the government and army, who are left to bully each other.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=371}} Townshend described the song as one \"that screams defiance at those who feel any cause is better than no cause\".{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=157}} He later said that the song was not strictly anti-revolution despite the lyric \"We'll be fighting in the streets\", but stressed that revolution could be unpredictable, adding, \"Don't expect to see what you expect to see. Expect nothing and you might gain everything.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.petetownshend.co.uk/diary/display.cfm?id=285&zone=diary |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205225327/http://www.petetownshend.co.uk/diary/display.cfm?id=285&zone=diary |title=Pete's Diaries \u2013 Won't Get Judged Again |publisher=petetownshend.co.uk |date=27 May 2006 |archivedate=5 December 2006 |accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref> Bassist [[John Entwistle]] later said that the song showed Townshend \"saying things that really mattered to him, and saying them for the first time.\"<ref name=\"thompson\">{{cite book|title=1000 Songs that Rock Your World: From Rock Classics to one-Hit Wonders, the Music That Lights Your Fire|first=Dave|last=Thompson|publisher=Krause Publications|year=2011|p=22|isbn=978-1-4402-1899-6}}</ref>\n\nTownshend had been reading [[Universal Sufism]] founder [[Inayat Khan]]'s ''The Mysticism of Sound and Music'', which referred to spiritual harmony and the universal chord, which would restore harmony to humanity when sounded. Townshend realised that the newly emerging [[synthesizer]]s would allow him to communicate these ideas to a mass audience.{{sfn|Unterberger|2011|p=27}} He had met the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]] which gave him ideas for capturing human personality within music. Townshend interviewed several people with [[general practitioner]]-style questions, and captured their heartbeat, brainwaves and astrological charts, converting the result into a series of audio pulses. For the demo of \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", he linked a [[Lowrey organ]] into an [[EMS VCS 3]] filter that played back the pulse-coded modulations from his experiments.{{sfn|Unterberger|2011|p=27}} He subsequently upgraded to an [[ARP 2500]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=250}} The synthesizer did not play any sounds directly as it was [[monophonic]]; instead it modified the block chords on the organ as an input signal.{{sfn|Unterberger|2011|p=28}} The demo, recorded at a slower tempo than the version by the Who, was completed by Townshend overdubbing drums, bass, electric guitar, vocals and handclaps.{{sfn|Unterberger|2011|p=51}}\n\n==Recording==\n{{Listen|filename=Won't Get Fooled Again.ogg|title=Brief sample from the song \"Won't Get Fooled Again\"|description=The closing section of \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", featuring synthesised organ, Moon's drumming, Townshend's [[power chord]] and Daltrey's scream}}\nThe Who's first attempt to record the song was at the [[Record Plant]] on W 44 Street, [[New York City]], on 16 March 1971. Manager [[Kit Lambert]] had recommended the studio to the group, which led to his producer credit, though the ''de facto'' work was done by [[Felix Pappalardi]]. This take featured Pappalardi's [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]] band mate, [[Leslie West]], on lead guitar.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=279}}\n\nLambert proved to be unable to mix the track, and a fresh attempt at recording was made at the start of April at [[Mick Jagger]]'s house, [[Stargroves]], using the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=280}} [[Glyn Johns]] was invited to help with production, and he decided to re-use the synthesized organ track from Townshend's original demo, as the re-recording of the part in New York was felt to be inferior to the original. [[Keith Moon]] had to carefully synchronise his drum playing with the synthesizer, while Townshend and Entwistle played electric guitar and bass.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=152}}\nTownshend played a 1959 [[Gretsch 6120|Gretsch 6120 Chet Atkins]] hollow body guitar fed through an Edwards volume pedal to a [[Fender Bandmaster]] amp, all of which he had been given by [[Joe Walsh]] while in New York. This combination became his main electric guitar recording setup for subsequent albums.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/myth-busters-townshend-415.aspx|title=Myth Busters: Pete Townshend's Recording Secrets|first=Dave|last=Hunter|publisher=Gibson|date=15 April 2009|accessdate=29 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006081848/http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/myth-busters-townshend-415.aspx|archive-date=6 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Although intended as a demo recording, the end result sounded so good to the band and Johns, they decided to use it as the final take.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=152}} Overdubs, including an [[acoustic guitar]] part played by Townshend, were recorded at [[Olympic Studios]] at the end of April.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=280}}{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=152}} The track was mixed at [[Island Studios]] by Johns on 28 May.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=280}} After ''Lifehouse'' was abandoned as a project, Johns felt \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", along with other songs, were so good that they could simply be released as a standalone single album, which became ''Who's Next''.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=382}}\n\n==Release==\n\"Won't Get Fooled Again\" was first released in the UK as a single A-side on 25 June 1971, edited down to 3:35. It replaced \"[[Behind Blue Eyes]]\", which the group felt didn't fit the Who's established musical style, as the choice of single. It was released in July in the US. The B-side, \"I Don't Even Know Myself\" was recorded at [[Eel Pie Studios]] in 1970 for a planned EP that was never released. The single reached No.&nbsp;9 in the UK charts and No.&nbsp;15 in the US. Initial publicity material showed an abandoned cover of ''Who's Next'' featuring Moon dressed in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] and brandishing a [[whip]]. {{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=284}}\n\nThe full-length version of the song appeared as the closing track of ''Who's Next'', released in August in the US and 27 August in the UK, where it topped the album charts.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=288}} \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" drew strong praise from critics, who were impressed that a synthesizer had managed to be integrated so successfully within a rock song.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=389}} Who author [[Dave Marsh]] described singer [[Roger Daltrey]]'s scream near the end of the track as \"the greatest scream of a career filled with screams\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=388}} In 2011, the song was ranked number 134 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/the-who-wont-get-fooled-again-20110526|title=The Who, 'Won't Get Fooled Again'|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref> As of March 2018 it was certified Silver for 200,000 sold copies in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bpi.co.uk/brit-certified/|title=BRIT Certified|publisher=BPI|accessdate=15 April 2018}} - Type \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" into the search box to verify the award</ref>\n\n==Live performances==\nThe Who first performed the song live at the opening date of a series of ''Lifehouse'' related concerts in the [[Young Vic]] theatre, London on 14 February 1971.

It was the last track Moon played live in front of a paying audience on 21 October 1976{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=479}} and the last song he ever played with the Who at [[Shepperton Studios]] on 25 May 1978, which was captured on the documentary film ''[[The Kids Are Alright (film)|The Kids Are Alright]]''.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=499}} The song was part of the Who's set at [[Live Aid]] in 1985, [[Live 8]] in 2005, [[T4 on the Beach]] in 2008 and [[Capital (radio network)|Capital FM]]'s [[Summertime Ball]] concert in 2009, 2010 and 2015 and the radio station's [[Jingle Bell Ball]] concerts in 2009 and 2015.<ref>{{cite book|title=Music in American Life: An Encyclopedia of the Songs, Styles, Stars, and Stories that Shaped our Culture [4 volumes]: An Encyclopedia of the Songs, Styles, Stars, and Stories That Shaped Our Culture|first=Jacqueline|last=Edmondson|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2013|p=280|isbn=978-0-313-39348-8}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2001, The Who performed the song at [[The Concert for New York City]] to help raise funds for the families of firemen and police officers killed during the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]].

It was released as a single in June 1971, reaching the top 10 in the UK, while the full eight-and-a-half-minute version appears as the final track on the band's 1971 album ''[[Who's Next]]'', released that August.\n\nTownshend wrote the song as a closing number of the [[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]] project, and the lyrics criticise revolution and power. To symbolise the spiritual connection he had found in music via the works of [[Meher Baba]] and [[Inayat Khan]], he programmed a mixture of human traits into a [[synthesizer]] and used it as the main backing instrument throughout the song. The Who tried recording the song in New York in March 1971, but re-recorded a superior take at [[Stargroves]] the next month using the synthesizer from Townshend's original demo. Ultimately, Lifehouse as a project was abandoned in favour of ''Who's Next'', a straightforward album, where it also became the closing track. It has been performed as a staple of the band's setlist since 1971, often as the set closer, and was the last song drummer [[Keith Moon]] played live with the band.\n\nAs well as a hit, the song has achieved critical praise, appearing as one of ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]. It has been covered by several artists, such as [[Van Halen]] who took their version to No.&nbsp;1 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Album Rock Tracks]] chart. It has been used for several TV shows and films, and in some political campaigns.\n\n==Background==\nThe song was originally intended for a [[rock opera]] Townshend had been working on, [[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]], which was a multi-media exercise based on his followings of the Indian religious [[avatar]] [[Meher Baba]], showing how spiritual enlightenment could be obtained via a combination of band and audience.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=273}} The song was written for the end of the opera, after the main character, Bobby, is killed and the \"universal chord\" is sounded. The main characters disappear, leaving behind the government and army, who are left to bully each other.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=371}} Townshend described the song as one \"that screams defiance at those who feel any cause is better than no cause\".{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=157}} He later said that the song was not strictly anti-revolution despite the lyric \"We'll be fighting in the streets\", but stressed that revolution could be unpredictable, adding, \"Don't expect to see what you expect to see. Expect nothing and you might gain everything.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.petetownshend.co.uk/diary/display.cfm?id=285&zone=diary |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205225327/http://www.petetownshend.co.uk/diary/display.cfm?id=285&zone=diary |title=Pete's Diaries \u2013 Won't Get Judged Again |publisher=petetownshend.co.uk |date=27 May 2006 |archivedate=5 December 2006 |accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref> Bassist [[John Entwistle]] later said that the song showed Townshend \"saying things that really mattered to him, and saying them for the first time.\"<ref name=\"thompson\">{{cite book|title=1000 Songs that Rock Your World: From Rock Classics to one-Hit Wonders, the Music That Lights Your Fire|first=Dave|last=Thompson|publisher=Krause Publications|year=2011|p=22|isbn=978-1-4402-1899-6}}</ref>\n\nTownshend had been reading [[Universal Sufism]] founder [[Inayat Khan]]'s ''The Mysticism of Sound and Music'', which referred to spiritual harmony and the universal chord, which would restore harmony to humanity when sounded. Townshend realised that the newly emerging [[synthesizer]]s would allow him to communicate these ideas to a mass audience.{{sfn|Unterberger|2011|p=27}} He had met the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]] which gave him ideas for capturing human personality within music. Townshend interviewed several people with [[general practitioner]]-style questions, and captured their heartbeat, brainwaves and astrological charts, converting the result into a series of audio pulses. For the demo of \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", he linked a [[Lowrey organ]] into an [[EMS VCS 3]] filter that played back the pulse-coded modulations from his experiments.{{sfn|Unterberger|2011|p=27}} He subsequently upgraded to an [[ARP 2500]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=250}} The synthesizer did not play any sounds directly as it was [[monophonic]]; instead it modified the block chords on the organ as an input signal.{{sfn|Unterberger|2011|p=28}} The demo, recorded at a slower tempo than the version by the Who, was completed by Townshend overdubbing drums, bass, electric guitar, vocals and handclaps.{{sfn|Unterberger|2011|p=51}}\n\n==Recording==\n{{Listen|filename=Won't Get Fooled Again.ogg|title=Brief sample from the song \"Won't Get Fooled Again\"|description=The closing section of \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", featuring synthesised organ, Moon's drumming, Townshend's [[power chord]] and Daltrey's scream}}\nThe Who's first attempt to record the song was at the [[Record Plant]] on W 44 Street, [[New York City]], on 16 March 1971. Manager [[Kit Lambert]] had recommended the studio to the group, which led to his producer credit, though the ''de facto'' work was done by [[Felix Pappalardi]]. This take featured Pappalardi's [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]] band mate, [[Leslie West]], on lead guitar.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=279}}\n\nLambert proved to be unable to mix the track, and a fresh attempt at recording was made at the start of April at [[Mick Jagger]]'s house, [[Stargroves]], using the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=280}} [[Glyn Johns]] was invited to help with production, and he decided to re-use the synthesized organ track from Townshend's original demo, as the re-recording of the part in New York was felt to be inferior to the original. [[Keith Moon]] had to carefully synchronise his drum playing with the synthesizer, while Townshend and Entwistle played electric guitar and bass.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=152}}\nTownshend played a 1959 [[Gretsch 6120|Gretsch 6120 Chet Atkins]] hollow body guitar fed through an Edwards volume pedal to a [[Fender Bandmaster]] amp, all of which he had been given by [[Joe Walsh]] while in New York. This combination became his main electric guitar recording setup for subsequent albums.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/myth-busters-townshend-415.aspx|title=Myth Busters: Pete Townshend's Recording Secrets|first=Dave|last=Hunter|publisher=Gibson|date=15 April 2009|accessdate=29 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006081848/http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/myth-busters-townshend-415.aspx|archive-date=6 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Although intended as a demo recording, the end result sounded so good to the band and Johns, they decided to use it as the final take.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=152}} Overdubs, including an [[acoustic guitar]] part played by Townshend, were recorded at [[Olympic Studios]] at the end of April.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=280}}{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=152}} The track was mixed at [[Island Studios]] by Johns on 28 May.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=280}} After ''Lifehouse'' was abandoned as a project, Johns felt \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", along with other songs, were so good that they could simply be released as a standalone single album, which became ''Who's Next''.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=382}}\n\n==Release==\n\"Won't Get Fooled Again\" was first released in the UK as a single A-side on 25 June 1971, edited down to 3:35.

The B-side, \"I Don't Even Know Myself\" was recorded at [[Eel Pie Studios]] in 1970 for a planned EP that was never released. The single reached No.&nbsp;9 in the UK charts and No.&nbsp;15 in the US.

It was the last track Moon played live in front of a paying audience on 21 October 1976{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=479}} and the last song he ever played with the Who at [[Shepperton Studios]] on 25 May 1978, which was captured on the documentary film ''[[The Kids Are Alright (film)|The Kids Are Alright]]''.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=499}} The song was part of the Who's set at [[Live Aid]] in 1985, [[Live 8]] in 2005, [[T4 on the Beach]] in 2008 and [[Capital (radio network)|Capital FM]]'s [[Summertime Ball]] concert in 2009, 2010 and 2015 and the radio station's [[Jingle Bell Ball]] concerts in 2009 and 2015.<ref>{{cite book|title=Music in American Life: An Encyclopedia of the Songs, Styles, Stars, and Stories that Shaped our Culture [4 volumes]: An Encyclopedia of the Songs, Styles, Stars, and Stories That Shaped Our Culture|first=Jacqueline|last=Edmondson|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2013|p=280|isbn=978-0-313-39348-8}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2001, The Who performed the song at [[The Concert for New York City]] to help raise funds for the families of firemen and police officers killed during the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]].
