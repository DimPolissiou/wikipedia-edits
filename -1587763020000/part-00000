By the beginning of the 20th century, Han Chinese had become the dominant ethnic group of the region. In 1932, the area was incorporated into [[Manchukuo]], a [[puppet state]] set up by [[Japan]].

In the 1950s, Jilin was expanded to its present borders. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], Jilin was expanded again to include a part of [[Inner Mongolia]], giving it a border with the independent state of [[Mongolia]], though this was later reversed.\n\nIn recent times Jilin has, with the rest of [[heavy industry]]-based [[Northeast China]], been facing economic difficulties with [[privatization]].

By the beginning of the 20th century, Han Chinese had become the dominant ethnic group of the region. In 1932, the area was incorporated into [[Manchukuo]], a [[puppet state]] set up by [[Japan]].

In the 1950s, Jilin was expanded to its present borders. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], Jilin was expanded again to include a part of [[Inner Mongolia]], giving it a border with the independent state of [[Mongolia]], though this was later reversed.\n\nIn recent times Jilin has, with the rest of [[heavy industry]]-based [[Northeast China]], been facing economic difficulties with [[privatization]].

{"title_page": "Male privilege", "text_new": "{{Feminism sidebar}}\n\n'''Male privilege''' is the system of advantages or rights that are available to [[men]] solely on the basis of their [[sex]]. A man's access to these benefits may vary depending on how closely they match their society's [[hegemonic masculinity|ideal masculine norm]].\n\n[[Feminist]] scholarship in the area of [[women's studies]] during the 1970s produced the earliest academic studies of privilege. These studies began by examining barriers to [[Social equity|equity]] between the sexes. In later decades, researchers began to focus on the [[intersectionality]] and overlapping nature of privileges relating to sex, [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[social class]], [[sexual orientation]], and other forms of social classification.\n\n== Overview ==\n\nSpecial privileges and status are granted to males in [[patriarchal]] societies.<ref name=\"Phillips & Phillips\">{{cite book |last1=Phillips |first1=Debby A. |last2=Phillips |first2=John R. |editor1-first=Jodi |editor1-last=O'Brien |title=Encyclopedia of Gender and Society: Volume 2 |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, Calif. |isbn= 978-1-4129-0916-7 |pages= 683\u2013685 |chapter=Privilege, Male |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=_nyHS4WyUKEC&pg=PT735}}</ref><ref name=\"Keith\">{{cite book |last1=Keith |first1=Thomas |title=Masculinities in Contemporary American Culture: An Intersectional Approach to the Complexities and Challenges of Male Identity |date=2017 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-31-759534-2 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_niDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT29 |chapter=Patriarchy, Male Privilege, and the Consequences of Living in a Patriarchal Society |language=en}}</ref> These are societies defined by male supremacy, in which males hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, [[social privilege]] and control of property. With systemic subordination of women, males gain economic, political, social, educational, and practical advantages that are more or less unavailable to women.{{refn|name=Keith}} The long-standing and unquestioned nature of such patriarchal systems, reinforced over generations, tends to make privilege invisible to holders; it can lead males who benefit from such privilege to ascribe their special status to their owned individual merits and achievements, rather than to unearned advantages.{{refn|name=Phillips & Phillips}}\n\nIn the field of [[sociology]], male privilege is seen as embedded in the structure of social institutions, as when men are often assigned authority over women in the workforce, and benefit from women's traditional caretaking role.<ref name=\"Rohlinger\">{{cite book |last=Rohlinger |first=Deana A. |editor1-last=Ritzer |editor1-first=G. |editor2-last=Ryan |editor2-first=J.M. |title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Sociology |date=2010 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=9781444392647 |pages=473\u2013474 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz4wU64f_JYC&q=%22male+privilege%22 |chapter=Privilege}}</ref> Privileges can be classified as either ''positive'' or ''negative'', depending on how they affect the rest of society.{{refn|name=Phillips & Phillips}} Women's studies scholar [[Peggy McIntosh]] writes: {{quote|We might at least start by distinguishing between positive advantages that we can work to spread, to the point where they are not advantages at all but simply part of the normal civic and social fabric, and negative types of advantage that unless rejected will always reinforce our present hierarchies.<ref name=\"McIntosh\">{{cite web |last1=McIntosh |first1=Peggy |title=White Privilege and Male Privilege: A Personal Account of Coming to See Correspondences Through Work in Women's Studies |url=http://www.ehcounseling.com/materials/WHITE_PRIVILEGE_MALE_04-02-2003.pdf |publisher=Wellesley College, Center for Research on Women |location=Wellesley, MA |date=1988 |id=Working Paper 189}}</ref>}}\n\nPositive advantages include having such things as adequate nutrition, shelter, and health care, whereas negative advantages accompanying male privilege include such things as the expectation that a man will have a better chance than a comparably qualified woman of being hired for a job, as well as being paid more than a woman for the same job.{{refn|name=Phillips & Phillips}}\n\n==Scope==\nThe term \"male privilege\" does not apply to a solitary occurrence of the use of power, but rather describes one of many systemic power structures that are interdependent and interlinked throughout societies and cultures.<ref name=\"Narayan\">{{cite book|last=Narayan|first=Uma|title=Dislocating Cultures: Identities, Traditions, and Third-World Feminism.|year=1997|publisher=London: Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-91419-2}}</ref>\n\nPrivilege is not shared equally by all males. Those who most closely match an ideal masculine norm benefit the most from privilege.{{refn|name=Phillips & Phillips}}{{refn|name=Coston & Kimmel}} In Western patriarchal societies this ideal has been described as being \"white, heterosexual, stoic, wealthy, strong, tough, competitive, and autonomous\".{{refn|name=Phillips & Phillips}} [[Men's studies]] scholars refer to this ideal masculine norm as ''[[hegemonic masculinity]]''. While essentially all males benefit from privilege to some degree, those who visibly differ from the norm may not benefit fully in certain situations, especially in the company of other men that more closely match it.{{refn|name=Phillips & Phillips}}\n\nMen who have experienced [[bullying]] and [[domestic violence]] in youth, in particular, may not accept that they are beneficiaries of privilege. Such forms of coercive violence are linked to the idea of ''toxic masculinity'', a specific model of manhood that creates hierarchies of dominance in which some are favored and others are harmed.{{refn|name=Keith}}\n\nThe invisibility of male privilege can be seen for instance in discussions of the [[gender pay gap in the United States]]; the gap is usually referred to by stating women's earnings as a percentage of men's. However, using women's pay as the baseline highlights the dividend that males receive as greater earnings (32% in 2005).{{refn|name=Phillips & Phillips}} In [[commerce]], male dominance in the ownership and control of [[financial capital]] and other forms of wealth has produced disproportionate male influence over the [[working class]]es and the hiring and firing of employees. In addition, a disproportionate burden is placed upon women in employment when they are expected to be solely responsible for [[child care]]; they may be more likely to be fired or be denied advancement in their profession, thus putting them at an economic disadvantage relative to men.{{refn|name=Keith}}\n\n==Scholarship==\n\nThe earliest academic studies of privilege appeared with [[feminist]] scholars' work in the area of [[women's studies]] during the 1970s. Such scholarship began by examining barriers to [[Social equity|equity]] between the sexes. In later decades, researchers began to focus on the [[intersectionality]] and overlapping nature of privileges relating to sex, [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[social class]], [[sexual orientation]], and other forms of social classification.{{refn|name=Phillips & Phillips}}\n\n[[Peggy McIntosh]], one of the first feminist scholars to examine male privilege,  wrote about both male privilege and [[white privilege]], using the metaphor of the \"invisible knapsack\" to describe a set of advantages borne, often unaware and unacknowledged, by members of privileged groups.{{refn|name=Phillips & Phillips}} According to McIntosh, privilege is not a result of a concerted effort to oppress those of the opposite gender; however, the inherent benefits that men gain from the systemic bias put women at an innate disadvantage. The benefits of this unspoken privilege may be described as special provisions, tools, relationships, or various other opportunities. According to McIntosh, this privilege may actually negatively affect men's development as human beings, and few question that the existing structure of advantages may be challenged or changed.{{refn|name=McIntosh}}\n\nEfforts to examine the role of privilege in students' lives has become a regular feature of university education in North America.{{refn|name=Phillips & Phillips}}<ref name=\"Coston & Kimmel\">{{cite journal |last1=Coston |first1=Bethany M. |last2=Kimmel |first2=Michael |year=2012 |title=Seeing Privilege Where It Isn't: Marginalized Masculinities and the Intersectionality of Privilege |journal=Journal of Social Issues |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=97\u2013111 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.2011.01738.x |issn=1540-4560}}</ref> By drawing attention to the presence of privilege (including male, white, and other forms) in the lives of students, educators have sought to foster insights that can help students contribute to [[social justice]].{{refn|name=Phillips & Phillips}} Such efforts include McIntosh's \"invisible knapsack\" model of privilege and the \"Male Privilege Checklist\".{{refn|name=Coston & Kimmel}}\n\n==Gender neutrality in English==\n\nFYI: All of this is complete and utter bullcrap, written by several raging feminists.

Those who most closely match an ideal masculine norm benefit the most from privilege.{{refn|name=Phillips & Phillips}}{{refn|name=Coston & Kimmel}} In Western patriarchal societies this ideal has been described as being \"white, heterosexual, stoic, wealthy, strong, tough, competitive, and autonomous\".{{refn|name=Phillips & Phillips}} [[Men's studies]] scholars refer to this ideal masculine norm as ''[[hegemonic masculinity]]''. While essentially all males benefit from privilege to some degree, those who visibly differ from the norm may not benefit fully in certain situations, especially in the company of other men that more closely match it.{{refn|name=Phillips & Phillips}}\n\nMen who have experienced [[bullying]] and [[domestic violence]] in youth, in particular, may not accept that they are beneficiaries of privilege. Such forms of coercive violence are linked to the idea of ''toxic masculinity'', a specific model of manhood that creates hierarchies of dominance in which some are favored and others are harmed.{{refn|name=Keith}}\n\nThe invisibility of male privilege can be seen for instance in discussions of the [[gender pay gap in the United States]]; the gap is usually referred to by stating women's earnings as a percentage of men's. However, using women's pay as the baseline highlights the dividend that males receive as greater earnings (32% in 2005).{{refn|name=Phillips & Phillips}} In [[commerce]], male dominance in the ownership and control of [[financial capital]] and other forms of wealth has produced disproportionate male influence over the [[working class]]es and the hiring and firing of employees. In addition, a disproportionate burden is placed upon women in employment when they are expected to be solely responsible for [[child care]]; they may be more likely to be fired or be denied advancement in their profession, thus putting them at an economic disadvantage relative to men.{{refn|name=Keith}}\n\n==Scholarship==\n\nThe earliest academic studies of privilege appeared with [[feminist]] scholars' work in the area of [[women's studies]] during the 1970s. Such scholarship began by examining barriers to [[Social equity|equity]] between the sexes. In later decades, researchers began to focus on the [[intersectionality]] and overlapping nature of privileges relating to sex, [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[social class]], [[sexual orientation]], and other forms of social classification.{{refn|name=Phillips & Phillips}}\n\n[[Peggy McIntosh]], one of the first feminist scholars to examine male privilege,  wrote about both male privilege and [[white privilege]], using the metaphor of the \"invisible knapsack\" to describe a set of advantages borne, often unaware and unacknowledged, by members of privileged groups.{{refn|name=Phillips & Phillips}} According to McIntosh, privilege is not a result of a concerted effort to oppress those of the opposite gender; however, the inherent benefits that men gain from the systemic bias put women at an innate disadvantage. The benefits of this unspoken privilege may be described as special provisions, tools, relationships, or various other opportunities. According to McIntosh, this privilege may actually negatively affect men's development as human beings, and few question that the existing structure of advantages may be challenged or changed.{{refn|name=McIntosh}}\n\nEfforts to examine the role of privilege in students' lives has become a regular feature of university education in North America.{{refn|name=Phillips & Phillips}}<ref name=\"Coston & Kimmel\">{{cite journal |last1=Coston |first1=Bethany M. |last2=Kimmel |first2=Michael |year=2012 |title=Seeing Privilege Where It Isn't: Marginalized Masculinities and the Intersectionality of Privilege |journal=Journal of Social Issues |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=97\u2013111 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.2011.01738.x |issn=1540-4560}}</ref> By drawing attention to the presence of privilege (including male, white, and other forms) in the lives of students, educators have sought to foster insights that can help students contribute to [[social justice]].{{refn|name=Phillips & Phillips}} Such efforts include McIntosh's \"invisible knapsack\" model of privilege and the \"Male Privilege Checklist\".{{refn|name=Coston & Kimmel}}\n\n==Gender neutrality in English==\n{{Off topic|date=November 2018|reason=How is this related to the academic concept of privilege?}}\n{{Further|Gender neutrality in English | Gender-neutrality in languages with grammatical gender | Gender-neutrality in languages without grammatical gender}}\n\nSome linguistic conventions have privileged men and the male perspective and suggested that maleness is the [[male as norm|societal norm]].<ref name=wildman>{{Cite book |title= Privilege revealed: how invisible preference undermines America  |last= Wildman |first= S.
