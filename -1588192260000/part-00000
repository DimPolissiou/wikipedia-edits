The terms '''emergences''' or '''[[spine (botany)|prickles]]''' refer to outgrowths that involve more than the epidermis. This distinction is not always easily applied (see [[Wait-a-minute tree]]). Also, there are ''nontrichomatous'' epidermal cells that protrude from the surface.{{such as|date=April 2018}}\n\nA common type of trichome is a '''hair'''. Plant hairs may be [[Unicellular organism|unicellular]] or [[Multicellular organism|multicellular]], branched or unbranched. Multicellular hairs may have one or several layers of cells. Branched hairs can be ''dendritic'' (tree-like) as in [[kangaroo paw]] (''[[Anigozanthos]]''), ''tufted'', or ''stellate'' (star-shaped), as in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''.\n\nAnother common type of trichome is the '''scale''' or '''peltate hair''', that has a plate or shield-shaped cluster of cells attached directly to the surface or borne on a stalk of some kind. Common examples are the leaf scales of [[Bromeliaceae|bromeliads]] such as the [[pineapple]], ''[[Rhododendron]]'' and sea buckthorn (''[[Hippophae rhamnoides]]'').\n\nAny of the various types of hairs may be '''{{vanchor|glandular}}''', producing some kind of secretion, such as the essential oils produced by [[Mentha|mint]]s and many other members of the family [[Lamiaceae]].\n\nMany terms are used to describe the surface appearance of plant organs, such as [[plant stem|stems]] and [[leaf|leaves]], referring to the presence, form and appearance of trichomes. Examples include:\n* '''glabrous''', '''glabrate''' &ndash; lacking hairs or trichomes; surface smooth\n* '''hirsute''' &ndash; coarsely hairy\n* '''hispid''' &ndash; having bristly hairs\n* '''articulate''' &ndash; simple pluricellular-uniseriate hairs\n* '''downy''' &ndash; having an almost wool-like covering of long hairs\n* '''pilose''' &ndash; pubescent with long, straight, soft, spreading or erect hairs\n* '''puberulent''' &ndash; minutely pubescent; having fine, short, usually erect, hairs\n* '''pubescent''' &ndash; bearing hairs or trichomes of any type\n* '''strigillose''' &ndash; minutely strigose\n* '''strigose''' &ndash; having straight hairs all pointing in more or less the same direction as along a margin or midrib\n* '''tomentellous''' &ndash; minutely tomentose\n* '''tomentose''' &ndash; covered with dense, matted, woolly hairs\n* '''villosulous''' &ndash; minutely villous\n* '''villous''' &ndash; having long, soft hairs, often curved, but not matted\n\nThe size, form, density and location of hairs on plants are extremely variable in their presence across [[species]] and even within a species on different plant organs. Several basic functions or advantages of having surface hairs can be listed. It is likely that in many cases, hairs interfere with the feeding of at least some small [[herbivore]]s and, depending upon [[stiffness]] and [[irritability]] to the [[palate]], large herbivores as well. Hairs on plants growing in areas subject to [[frost]] keep the frost away from the living surface cells. In windy locations, hairs break up the flow of air across the plant surface, reducing [[transpiration]]. Dense coatings of hairs reflect [[sunlight]], protecting the more delicate tissues underneath in hot, dry, open habitats. In addition, in locations where much of the available moisture comes from [[fog drip]], hairs appear to enhance this process by increasing the surface area on which water droplets can accumulate.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Glandular trichomes ===\nGlandular trichomes have been vastly studied, even though they are only found on about 30% of plants. Their function is to secrete metabolites for the plant.

These trichomes also contains acetylated, which can absorb UV-B and non-acetylated flavonoids, which absorb the longer wavelength of UV-A.<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\n==== Polyphenols ====\nNon-glandular trichomes in the genus ''Cistus'' were found to contain presences of ellagitannins, glycosides, and kaempferol derivatives.<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\nThe ellagitannins serve a main purpose of adapting in times of nutrient-limiting stress.<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\n==== Flavonoids ====\nIn non-glandular trichomes, the only role of flavonoids is to block out the shortest wavelengths to protect the plant, which differs from glandular trichomes.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Trichome and root hair development ==\nBoth trichomes and [[root hair]]s, the [[rhizoid]]s of many [[vascular plant]]s, are lateral outgrowths of a single cell of the epidermal layer. Root hairs form from '''trichoblasts''', the hair-forming cells on the epidermis of a plant [[root]]. Root hairs vary between 5 and 17 micrometres in diameter, and 80 to 1,500 micrometres in length (Dittmar, cited in Esau, 1965). Root hairs can survive for two to three weeks and then die off. At the same time new root hairs are continually being formed at the top of the root. This way, the root hair coverage stays the same. It is therefore understandable that repotting must be done with care, because the root hairs are being pulled off for the most part. This is why planting out may cause plants to wilt.\n\nThe genetic control of patterning of trichomes and roots hairs shares similar control mechanisms. Both processes involve a core of related [[Transcription factors, general|transcription factors]] that control the initiation and development of the epidermal outgrowth. Activation of genes that encode specific protein transcription factors (named GLABRA1 (GL1), GLABRA3 (GL3) and TRANSPARENT [[Seed#Seed coat|TESTA]] GLABRA1 (TTG1)) are the major regulators of cell fate to produce trichomes or root hairs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schellmann|first=S.|last2=Schnittger|first2=A.|last3=Kirik|first3=V.|last4=Wada|first4=T.|last5=Okada|first5=K.|last6=Beermann|first6=A.|last7=Thumfahrt|first7=J.|last8=J\u00fcrgens|first8=G.|last9=H\u00fclskamp|first9=M.|date=2002-10-01|title=TRIPTYCHON and CAPRICE mediate lateral inhibition during trichome and root hair patterning in Arabidopsis|url=http://embojnl.embopress.org/content/21/19/5036|journal=The EMBO Journal|language=en|volume=21|issue=19|pages=5036\u20135046|doi=10.1093/emboj/cdf524|issn=0261-4189|pmid=12356720|pmc=129046}}</ref> When these genes are activated in a leaf epidermal cell, the formation of a trichrome is initiated within that cell.

The terms '''emergences''' or '''[[spine (botany)|prickles]]''' refer to outgrowths that involve more than the epidermis. This distinction is not always easily applied (see [[Wait-a-minute tree]]). Also, there are ''nontrichomatous'' epidermal cells that protrude from the surface.{{such as|date=April 2018}}\n\nA common type of trichome is a '''hair'''. Plant hairs may be [[Unicellular organism|unicellular]] or [[Multicellular organism|multicellular]], branched or unbranched. Multicellular hairs may have one or several layers of cells. Branched hairs can be ''dendritic'' (tree-like) as in [[kangaroo paw]] (''[[Anigozanthos]]''), ''tufted'', or ''stellate'' (star-shaped), as in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''.\n\nAnother common type of trichome is the '''scale''' or '''peltate hair''', that has a plate or shield-shaped cluster of cells attached directly to the surface or borne on a stalk of some kind. Common examples are the leaf scales of [[Bromeliaceae|bromeliads]] such as the [[pineapple]], ''[[Rhododendron]]'' and sea buckthorn (''[[Hippophae rhamnoides]]'').\n\nAny of the various types of hairs may be '''{{vanchor|glandular}}''', producing some kind of secretion, such as the essential oils produced by [[Mentha|mint]]s and many other members of the family [[Lamiaceae]].\n\nMany terms are used to describe the surface appearance of plant organs, such as [[plant stem|stems]] and [[leaf|leaves]], referring to the presence, form and appearance of trichomes. Examples include:\n* '''glabrous''', '''glabrate''' &ndash; lacking hairs or trichomes; surface smooth\n* '''hirsute''' &ndash; coarsely hairy\n* '''hispid''' &ndash; having bristly hairs\n* '''articulate''' &ndash; simple pluricellular-uniseriate hairs\n* '''downy''' &ndash; having an almost wool-like covering of long hairs\n* '''pilose''' &ndash; pubescent with long, straight, soft, spreading or erect hairs\n* '''puberulent''' &ndash; minutely pubescent; having fine, short, usually erect, hairs\n* '''pubescent''' &ndash; bearing hairs or trichomes of any type\n* '''strigillose''' &ndash; minutely strigose\n* '''strigose''' &ndash; having straight hairs all pointing in more or less the same direction as along a margin or midrib\n* '''tomentellous''' &ndash; minutely tomentose\n* '''tomentose''' &ndash; covered with dense, matted, woolly hairs\n* '''villosulous''' &ndash; minutely villous\n* '''villous''' &ndash; having long, soft hairs, often curved, but not matted\n\nThe size, form, density and location of hairs on plants are extremely variable in their presence across [[species]] and even within a species on different plant organs. Several basic functions or advantages of having surface hairs can be listed. It is likely that in many cases, hairs interfere with the feeding of at least some small [[herbivore]]s and, depending upon [[stiffness]] and [[irritability]] to the [[palate]], large herbivores as well. Hairs on plants growing in areas subject to [[frost]] keep the frost away from the living surface cells. In windy locations, hairs break up the flow of air across the plant surface, reducing [[transpiration]]. Dense coatings of hairs reflect [[sunlight]], protecting the more delicate tissues underneath in hot, dry, open habitats. In addition, in locations where much of the available moisture comes from [[fog drip]], hairs appear to enhance this process by increasing the surface area on which water droplets can accumulate.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Glandular trichomes ===\nGlandular trichomes have been vastly studied, even though they are only found on about 30% of plants.

These trichomes also contains acetylated, which can absorb UV-B and non-acetylated flavonoids, which absorb the longer wavelength of UV-A.<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\n==== Polyphenols ====\nNon-glandular trichomes in the genus ''Cistus'' were found to contain presences of ellagitannins, glycosides, and kaempferol derivatives.<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\nThe ellagitannins serve a main purpose of adapting in times of nutrient-limiting stress.<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\n==== Flavonoids ====\nIn non-glandular trichomes, the only role of flavonoids is to block out the shortest wavelengths to protect the plant, which differs from glandular trichomes.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Trichome and root hair development ==\nBoth trichomes and [[root hair]]s, the [[rhizoid]]s of many [[vascular plant]]s, are lateral outgrowths of a single cell of the epidermal layer. Root hairs form from '''trichoblasts''', the hair-forming cells on the epidermis of a plant [[root]]. Root hairs vary between 5 and 17 micrometres in diameter, and 80 to 1,500 micrometres in length (Dittmar, cited in Esau, 1965). Root hairs can survive for two to three weeks and then die off. At the same time new root hairs are continually being formed at the top of the root. This way, the root hair coverage stays the same. It is therefore understandable that repotting must be done with care, because the root hairs are being pulled off for the most part. This is why planting out may cause plants to wilt.\n\nThe genetic control of patterning of trichomes and roots hairs shares similar control mechanisms. Both processes involve a core of related [[Transcription factors, general|transcription factors]] that control the initiation and development of the epidermal outgrowth. Activation of genes that encode specific protein transcription factors (named GLABRA1 (GL1), GLABRA3 (GL3) and TRANSPARENT [[Seed#Seed coat|TESTA]] GLABRA1 (TTG1)) are the major regulators of cell fate to produce trichomes or root hairs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schellmann|first=S.|last2=Schnittger|first2=A.|last3=Kirik|first3=V.|last4=Wada|first4=T.|last5=Okada|first5=K.|last6=Beermann|first6=A.|last7=Thumfahrt|first7=J.|last8=J\u00fcrgens|first8=G.|last9=H\u00fclskamp|first9=M.|date=2002-10-01|title=TRIPTYCHON and CAPRICE mediate lateral inhibition during trichome and root hair patterning in Arabidopsis|url=http://embojnl.embopress.org/content/21/19/5036|journal=The EMBO Journal|language=en|volume=21|issue=19|pages=5036\u20135046|doi=10.1093/emboj/cdf524|issn=0261-4189|pmid=12356720|pmc=129046}}</ref> When these genes are activated in a leaf epidermal cell, the formation of a trichrome is initiated within that cell.

This sensation has been attributed as a defense mechanism against large animals and small invertebrates, and plays a role in defense supplementation via secretion of metabolites. Studies suggest that this sensation involves a rapid release of toxin (such as histamine) upon contact and penetration via the globular tips of said trichomes.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fu | first1 = H.

Military records cite this development as a precautionary measure to protect citizens and the Navajo from each other. However, the Spanish/Mexican-Navajo pattern of raids and expeditions continued. Over 400 New Mexican militia conducted a campaign against the Navajo, against the wishes of the Territorial Governor, in 1860\u201361. They killed Navajo warriors, captured women and children for slaves, and destroyed crops and dwellings. The Navajo call this period ''Naahondzood'', \"the fearing time.\"\n\nIn 1861, Brigadier-General [[James Henry Carleton|James H. Carleton]], Commander of the Federal District of New Mexico, initiated a series of military actions against the Navajo and Apache. Colonel [[Kit Carson]]  was at the new [[Fort Wingate]] with Army troops and volunteer New Mexico militia.  Carleton ordered Carson to kill [[Mescalero]] Apache men and destroy any Mescalero property he could find. Carleton believed these harsh tactics would bring any Indian Tribe under control. The Mescalero surrendered and were sent to the new reservation called [[Bosque Redondo]].\n\nIn the summer of 1863, Carleton ordered Carson to use the same tactics on the Navajo. Carson and his force swept through Navajo land, killing Navajo and destroying crops and dwellings, fouling wells, and capturing livestock. Facing starvation and death, Navajo groups came in to [[Fort Defiance, Arizona|Fort Defiance]] for relief. On July 20, 1863, the first of many groups departed to join the Mescalero at Bosque Redondo.

The internment at Bosque Redondo was disastrous for the Navajo, as the government failed to provide an adequate supply of water, wood, provisions, and livestock for the 4,000\u20135,000 people. Large-scale crop failure and disease were also endemic during this time, as were raids by other tribes and civilians. Some Navajo froze during the winter because they could make only poor shelters from the few materials and resources they were given. This period is known among the Navajo as \"The Fearing Time\".<ref>George Bornstein, \"The Fearing Time: Telling the tales of Indian slavery in American history\", ''Times Literary Supplement'', 20 October 2017 p. 29 (review of Andr\u00e9s Res\u00e9ndez, ''The Other Slavery: The Uncovered Story of Indian Enslavement in America'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, {{ISBN|9780547640983}}).</ref> In addition, a small group of [[Mescalero|Mescalero Apache]], longtime enemies of the Navajos had been relocated to the area.

Between 1873 and 1895, the military employed Navajo as [[Navajo Scouts|\"Indian Scouts\"]] at Fort Wingate to assist their regular units.<ref>Marei Bouknight and others, ''Guide to Records in the Military Archives Division Pertaining to Indian-White Relations,'' GSA National Archives, 1972</ref> During this period, Chief [[Manuelito]] founded the [[Navajo Tribal Police]]. It operated between 1872 and 1875 as an anti-raid task force working to maintain the peaceful terms of the 1868 Navajo treaty.\n\nBy treaty, the Navajo were allowed to leave the reservation for trade, with permission from the military or local [[Indian agent]]. Eventually, the arrangement led to a gradual end in Navajo raids, as the tribe was able to increase the size of their livestock herds and cultivated crops. In addition, the tribe gained an increase in the size of the Navajo reservation from 3.5 million acres ({{convert|14,000|km\u00b2|mi2|abbr=on}}) to the 16 million acres ({{convert|65,000|km\u00b2|mi2|abbr=on}}) as it stands today. But economic conflicts with non-Navajos continued for many years as civilians and companies exploited resources assigned to the Navajo. The US government made leases for livestock grazing, took land for railroad development, and permitted mining on Navajo land without consultation with the tribe.\n\nIn 1883, [[Lieutenant|Lt.]] Parker, accompanied by 10 enlisted men and two scouts, went up the San Juan River to separate the Navajo and citizens who had encroached on Navajo land.<ref>Ford, \"September 30, 1887 Letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona</ref> In the same year, Lt.

Two Navajo men and all three whites died as a result, but a woman and a child survived. Capt. Kerr (with two Navajo scouts) examined the ground and then met with several hundred Navajo at Houcks Tank. Rancher Bennett, whose horse was allegedly stolen, told Kerr that his horses were stolen by the three whites to catch a horse thief.<ref>Kerr, \"February 18, 1887 letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona.</ref> In the same year, Lt.

Scott ejected them.<ref>Scott,\" June 22, 1887 letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona</ref>\n\nIn 1890, a local rancher refused to pay the Navajo a fine of livestock. The Navajo tried to collect it, and whites in southern Colorado and Utah claimed that 9,000 of the Navajo were on a warpath. A small military detachment out of Fort Wingate restored white citizens to order.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn 1913, an Indian agent ordered a Navajo and his three wives to come in, and then arrested them for having a plural marriage. A small group of Navajo used force to free the women and retreated to [[Beautiful Mountain]] with 30 or 40 sympathizers. They refused to surrender to the agent, and local law enforcement and military refused the agent's request for an armed engagement.

European Americans taught the classes under an English-only curriculum and punished any student caught speaking Navajo.<ref name=\"Lawrence Erlbaum Associates\"/> The children were under militaristic discipline, run by the ''Sil\u00e1o''.{{Clarify|reason=Silao is a Navajo word for Police Officer.

This report discussed Indian boarding schools as being inadequate in terms of diet, medical services, dormitory overcrowding, undereducated teachers, restrictive discipline, and manual labor by the students to keep the school running.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCarty|first1=T.L.|last2=Bia|first2=Fred|title=A Place to be Navajo: Rough Rock and the Struggle for Self-Determination in Indigenous Schooling|date=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-3760-4|page=48}}</ref>\n\nThis report was the precursor to education reforms initiated under President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], under which two new schools were built on the Navajo reservation. But Rough Rock Day School was run in the same militaristic style as Fort Defiance and did not implement the educational reforms. The Evangelical Missionary School was opened next to Rough Rock Day School. Navajo accounts of this school portray it as having a family-like atmosphere with home-cooked meals, new or gently used clothing, humane treatment, and a Navajo-based curriculum. Educators found the Evangelical Missionary School curriculum to be much more beneficial for the Navajo children.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCarty|first1=T.L.|last2=Bia|first2=Fred|title=A Place to be Navajo: Rough Rock and the Struggle for Self-Determination in Indigenous Schooling|date=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-3760-4|pages=50\u20131}}</ref>\n\n[[File:\"Navajo Woman and Infant, Canyon de Chelle, Arizona.\" (Canyon de Chelly National Monument), 1933 - 1942 - NARA - 519947.jpg|thumb|left|''Untitled''.

Worried about large herds in the arid climate, at a time when the Dust Bowl was endangering the Great Plains, the government decided that the land of the Navajo Nation could support only a fixed number of sheep, goats, cattle, and horses. The Federal government believed that land erosion was worsening in the area and the only solution was to reduce the number of livestock.\n\nIn 1933, [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]] was appointed commissioner of the BIA. In many ways, he worked to reform government relations with the Native American tribes, but the reduction program was devastating for the Navajo, for whom their livestock was so important. The government set land capacity in terms of \"sheep units\".  In 1930 the Navajo grazed 1,100,000 mature sheep units.<ref name=\"Reduction\">{{cite book | author=Compiled | editor=Roessel, Ruth |title=Navajo Livestock Reduction: A National Disgrace | location=Tsaile, Arizona | publisher=Navajo Community College Press | year=1974 | isbn=0-912586-18-4}}</ref> These sheep provided half the cash income for the individual Navajo.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Iverson|title=\"For Our Navajo People\": Din\u00e9 Letters, Speeches & Petitions, 1900-1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dU2_8WAkD4EC&pg=PA250|year=2002|publisher=U of New Mexico Press|page=250|isbn=9780826327185}}</ref>\n\nCollier's solution was to first launch a voluntary reduction program, which was made mandatory two years later in 1935. The government paid for part of the value of each animal, but it did nothing to compensate for the loss of future yearly income for so many Navajo.

Many Navajo men volunteered for military service in keeping with their warrior culture, and they served in integrated units. The War Department in 1940 rejected a proposal by the BIA that segregated units be created for the Indians. The Navajo gained firsthand experience with how they could assimilate into the modern world, and many did not return to the overcrowded reservation, which had few jobs.<ref>Alison R.

From then into the early 21st century, the U.S. allowed mining without sufficient environmental protection for workers, waterways, and land. The Navajo have claimed high rates of death and illness from lung disease and cancer resulting from environmental contamination. Since the 1970s, legislation has helped to regulate the industry and reduce the toll, but the government has not yet offered holistic and comprehensive compensation.<ref>Judy Pasternak, ''Yellow Dirt- An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed,'' Free Press, New York, 2010.</ref>\n\n===U.S. Marine Corps Involvement===\nThe Navajo Code Talkers played a significant role in the history of [[USMC]] history. Using their own language they utilized a military code; for example, the Navajo word \"turtle\" represented a tank. In 1942, Marine staff officers composed several combat simulations and the Navajo translated it and transmitted in their dialect to another Navajo on the other line. This Navajo then translated it back in english faster than any other cryptographic facilities, which demonstrated their efficacy. As a result, General Vogel recommended their recruitment into the USMC code talker program. \n\nEach Navajo went through basic bootcamp at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego|Marine Corps Recruit Depot]], San Diego before being assigned to Field Signal Battalion training at [[Camp Pendleton]]. Once the code talkers completed training in the States, they were sent to the Pacific for assignment to the Marine combat divisions. With that said, there was never a crack in the Navajo language, it was never deciphered. It is known that many more Navajos volunteered to become code talkers than could be accepted; however, an undetermined number of other Navajos served as Marines in the war, but not as code talkers. \n\nThese achievements of the Navajo Code Talkers have resulted in an honorable chapter in USMC history. Their patriotism and honor inevitably earned them the respect of all Americans.<ref> Marine Corps.

The clan system is [[exogamy|exogamous]]: people can only marry (and date) partners outside their own clans, which for this purpose include the clans of their four grandparents. Some Navajo favor their\nchildren to marry into their father\u2019s clan. While clans are associated with a geographical area, the area is not for the exclusive use of any one clan. Members of a clan may live hundreds of miles apart but still have a clan bond.<ref name=\"Longwalk\">{{cite book | author=Compiled | editor=Roessel, Ruth | title=Navajo Stories of the Long Walk Period | location=Tsaile, Arizona | publisher=Navajo Community College Press | year=1973 | isbn=0-912586-16-8 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/navajostoriesofl0000unse }}</ref>{{rp|xix-xxi}}\n\nHistorically, the structure of the Navajo society is largely a [[matrilineal]] system, in which the family of the women owned livestock, dwellings, planting areas and livestock grazing areas. Once married, a Navajo man would follow a [[matrilocal]] residence and live with his bride in her dwelling and near her mother's family. Daughters (or, if necessary, other female relatives) were traditionally the ones who received the generational property inheritance. In cases of marital separation, women would maintain the property and children.  Children are \"born to\" and belong to the mother's clan, and are \"born for\" the father's clan. The mother's eldest brother has a strong role in her children's lives. As adults, men represent their mother's clan in tribal politics.<ref name=\"TheNavajo\" /> <!--Note: matrilocal is not the equivalent as matriarchal-->\n\nNeither sex can live without the other in the Navajo culture. Men and women are seen as contemporary equals as both a male and female are needed to reproduce. Although women may carry a bigger burden, fertility is so highly valued that males are expected to provide economic resources (known as [[bride wealth]]). Corn is a symbol of fertility in Navajo culture as they eat white corn in the wedding ceremonies. It is considered to be immoral and/or stealing if one does not provide for the other in that premarital or marital relationship. <ref> Lauren Del Carlo, ''Between the Sacred Mountains: A Cultural History of the Dineh,'' Essai, Volume 5: Article 15, 2007.</ref>\n===Ethnobotany===\nSee [[Navajo ethnobotany]].\n\n===Traditional dwellings===\n[[File:Navajo hogan.jpg|thumb|left|A Navajo hogan (with a woodshed)]]\nA [[hogan]], the traditional Navajo home, is built as a shelter for either a man or for a woman. Male hogans are square or conical with a distinct rectangular entrance, while a female hogan is an eight-sided house.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Both are made of logs and covered in mud, with the door always facing east to welcome the sun each morning. Navajos also have several types of hogans for lodging and ceremonial use. Ceremonies, such as healing ceremonies or the [[Blessing Way|''kinaald\u00e1'']], take place inside a hogan.<ref>Iverson, Nez, and Deer, 23</ref> According to Kehoe, this style of housing is distinctive to the Navajos. She writes, \"even today, a solidly constructed, log-walled Hogan is preferred by many Navajo families.\" Most Navajo members today live in apartments and houses in urban areas.<ref name=k>Kehoe, 133</ref>\n\nThose who practice the Navajo religion regard the hogan as sacred. The religious song \"[[The Blessingway]]\" (''{{spell-nv|h\u00f3zh\u01eb\u0301\u01eb\u0301j\u00ed}}'') describes the first hogan as being built by Coyote with help from Beavers to be a house for First Man, First Woman, and Talking God. The Beaver People gave Coyote logs and instructions on how to build the first hogan. Navajos made their hogans in the traditional fashion until the 1900s, when they started to make them in hexagonal and octagonal shapes. Hogans continue to be used as dwellings, especially by older Navajos, although they tend to be made with modern construction materials and techniques.

The Second, or Blue World, was inhabited by a few of the mammals Earth People know today as well as the Swallow Chief, or T\u00e1shch\u00f3zhii. The First World beings had offended him and were asked to leave. From there, they headed south and arrived in the Third World, or Yellow World. The four sacred mountains were found here, but due to a great flood, First Woman, First Man, and the Holy People were forced to find another world to live in. This time, when they arrived, they stayed in the Fourth World.

[[Atsidi Sani]] (c. 1830\u2013c. 1918) is considered to be the first Navajo silversmith. He learned silversmithing from a Mexican man called ''Nakai Tsosi'' (\"Thin Mexican\") around 1878 and began teaching other Navajos how to work with silver.<ref>Adair 4</ref> By 1880, Navajo silversmiths were creating [[handmade jewelry]] including bracelets, tobacco flasks, [[necklace]]s and [[bracer]]s. Later, they added silver [[earrings]], [[buckles]], [[Bolo tie|bolos]], hair ornaments, pins and squash blossom necklaces for tribal use, and to sell to tourists as a way to supplement their income.<ref>Adair 135</ref>\n\nThe Navajos' hallmark jewelry piece called the \"squash blossom\" necklace first appeared in the 1880s. The term \"squash blossom\" was apparently attached to the name of the Navajo necklace at an early date, although its bud-shaped beads are thought to derive from Spanish-Mexican [[pomegranate]] designs.<ref>Adair 44</ref> The Navajo silversmiths also borrowed the \"naja\" (''najahe'' in Navajo)<ref>Adair, 9</ref> symbol to shape the silver pendant that hangs from the \"squash blossom\" necklace.\n\n[[Turquoise]] has been part of jewelry for centuries, but Navajo artists did not use inlay techniques to insert turquoise into silver designs until the late 19th century.\n\n===Weaving===\n{{Main|Navajo weaving}}\n[[File:Navajo sheep & weaver.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Navajo weaver with sheep]]\n[[File:Navajo Germantown Rug 2008.008.001.jpg|180px|thumb|Navajo Germantown Eye Dazzler Rug, [[Science History Institute]] ]]\n[[File:Probably Bayeta-style Blanket with Terrace and Stepped Design, 1870-1880, 50.67.54.jpg|thumbnail|''Probably Bayeta-style Blanket with Terrace and Stepped Design'', 1870\u20131880, 50.67.54, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nNavajos came to the southwest with their own weaving traditions; however, they learned to weave cotton on upright looms from Pueblo peoples. The first Spaniards to visit the region wrote about seeing Navajo blankets. By the 18th century the Navajos had begun to import Bayeta red yarn to supplement local black, grey, and white wool, as well as wool dyed with [[indigo dye|indigo]]. Using an upright loom, the Navajos made extremely fine utilitarian blankets that were collected by [[Ute tribe|Ute]] and [[Plains Indians]]. These Chief's Blankets, so called because only chiefs or very wealthy individuals could afford them, were characterized by horizontal stripes and minimal patterning in red. First Phase Chief's Blankets have only horizontal stripes, Second Phase feature red rectangular designs, and Third Phase feature red diamonds and partial diamond patterns.\n\nThe completion of the railroads dramatically changed Navajo weaving. Cheap blankets were imported, so Navajo weavers shifted their focus to weaving rugs for an increasingly non-Native audience. Rail service also brought in Germantown wool from [[Philadelphia]], commercially dyed wool which greatly expanded the weavers' color palettes.\n\nSome early European-American settlers moved in and set up trading posts, often buying [[Navajo rug]]s by the pound and selling them back east by the bale. The traders encouraged the locals to weave blankets and [[Navajo Rug|rugs]] into distinct styles. These included \"Two Gray Hills\" (predominantly black and white, with traditional patterns); ''Teec Nos Pos'' (colorful, with very extensive patterns); \"Ganado\" (founded by [[Don Lorenzo Hubbell]]<ref>[http://www.wmonline.com/attract/pforest/hubbell.htm \"Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site\"] ''White Mountains Online.''

On November 21, 1846, following an invitation from a small party of American soldiers under the command of Captain John Reid, who journeyed deep into Navajo country and contacted him, [[Narbona]] and other Navajo negotiated [[Bear Springs Treaty|a treaty of peace]] with Colonel [[Alexander William Doniphan|Alexander Doniphan]] at Bear Springs, Ojo del Oso (later the site of [[Fort Wingate]]).

Calhoun, an Indian agent\u2014led a force of 400 soldiers into Navajo country, penetrating [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument|Canyon de Chelly]]. He signed a treaty with two Navajo leaders: Mariano Martinez as Head Chief and Chapitone as Second Chief. The treaty acknowledged the transfer of jurisdiction from the United Mexican States to the United States. The treaty allowed forts and trading posts to be built on Navajo land. The United States, on its part, promised \"such donations [and] such other liberal and humane measures, as [it] may deem meet and proper.\"<ref>{{USStat|9|974}}</ref> While en route to this treaty signing, Narbona, a prominent Navajo peace leader, was killed, resulting in hostility between the treaty parties.<ref>[[James H.

Military records cite this development as a precautionary measure to protect citizens and the Navajo from each other. However, the Spanish/Mexican-Navajo pattern of raids and expeditions continued. Over 400 New Mexican militia conducted a campaign against the Navajo, against the wishes of the Territorial Governor, in 1860\u201361. They killed Navajo warriors, captured women and children for slaves, and destroyed crops and dwellings. The Navajo call this period ''Naahondzood'', \"the fearing time.\"\n\nIn 1861, Brigadier-General [[James Henry Carleton|James H. Carleton]], Commander of the Federal District of New Mexico, initiated a series of military actions against the Navajo and Apache. Colonel [[Kit Carson]]  was at the new [[Fort Wingate]] with Army troops and volunteer New Mexico militia.  Carleton ordered Carson to kill [[Mescalero]] Apache men and destroy any Mescalero property he could find. Carleton believed these harsh tactics would bring any Indian Tribe under control. The Mescalero surrendered and were sent to the new reservation called [[Bosque Redondo]].\n\nIn the summer of 1863, Carleton ordered Carson to use the same tactics on the Navajo. Carson and his force swept through Navajo land, killing Navajo and destroying crops and dwellings, fouling wells, and capturing livestock. Facing starvation and death, Navajo groups came in to [[Fort Defiance, Arizona|Fort Defiance]] for relief. On July 20, 1863, the first of many groups departed to join the Mescalero at Bosque Redondo.

The internment at Bosque Redondo was disastrous for the Navajo, as the government failed to provide an adequate supply of water, wood, provisions, and livestock for the 4,000\u20135,000 people. Large-scale crop failure and disease were also endemic during this time, as were raids by other tribes and civilians. Some Navajo froze during the winter because they could make only poor shelters from the few materials and resources they were given. This period is known among the Navajo as \"The Fearing Time\".<ref>George Bornstein, \"The Fearing Time: Telling the tales of Indian slavery in American history\", ''Times Literary Supplement'', 20 October 2017 p. 29 (review of Andr\u00e9s Res\u00e9ndez, ''The Other Slavery: The Uncovered Story of Indian Enslavement in America'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, {{ISBN|9780547640983}}).</ref> In addition, a small group of [[Mescalero|Mescalero Apache]], longtime enemies of the Navajos had been relocated to the area. Conflicts resulted.\n\nIn 1868, the [[Treaty of Bosque Redondo]] was negotiated between Navajo leaders and the federal government allowing the surviving Navajo to return to a [[Native American reservation|reservation]] on a portion of their former homeland.\n\n===Reservation era===\n\n[[File:Navajo woman & child.jpg|thumb|200px|Navajo woman and child, ''circa'' 1880\u20131910]]\nThe United States military continued to maintain forts on the Navajo reservation in the years following the Long Walk. Between 1873 and 1895, the military employed Navajo as [[Navajo Scouts|\"Indian Scouts\"]] at Fort Wingate to assist their regular units.<ref>Marei Bouknight and others, ''Guide to Records in the Military Archives Division Pertaining to Indian-White Relations,'' GSA National Archives, 1972</ref> During this period, Chief [[Manuelito]] founded the [[Navajo Tribal Police]]. It operated between 1872 and 1875 as an anti-raid task force working to maintain the peaceful terms of the 1868 Navajo treaty.\n\nBy treaty, the Navajo were allowed to leave the reservation for trade, with permission from the military or local [[Indian agent]]. Eventually, the arrangement led to a gradual end in Navajo raids, as the tribe was able to increase the size of their livestock herds and cultivated crops. In addition, the tribe gained an increase in the size of the Navajo reservation from 3.5 million acres ({{convert|14,000|km\u00b2|mi2|abbr=on}}) to the 16 million acres ({{convert|65,000|km\u00b2|mi2|abbr=on}}) as it stands today. But economic conflicts with non-Navajos continued for many years as civilians and companies exploited resources assigned to the Navajo. The US government made leases for livestock grazing, took land for railroad development, and permitted mining on Navajo land without consultation with the tribe.\n\nIn 1883, [[Lieutenant|Lt.]] Parker, accompanied by 10 enlisted men and two scouts, went up the San Juan River to separate the Navajo and citizens who had encroached on Navajo land.<ref>Ford, \"September 30, 1887 Letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona</ref> In the same year, Lt. Lockett, with the aid of 42 enlisted soldiers, was joined by Lt. Holomon at [[Navajo Springs, Arizona|Navajo Springs]]. Evidently, citizens of the surnames Houck and/or Owens had murdered a Navajo chief's son, and 100 armed Navajo warriors were looking for them.\n\nIn 1887, citizens Palmer, Lockhart, and King fabricated a charge of horse stealing and randomly attacked a dwelling on the reservation. Two Navajo men and all three whites died as a result, but a woman and a child survived. Capt. Kerr (with two Navajo scouts) examined the ground and then met with several hundred Navajo at Houcks Tank. Rancher Bennett, whose horse was allegedly stolen, told Kerr that his horses were stolen by the three whites to catch a horse thief.<ref>Kerr, \"February 18, 1887 letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona.</ref> In the same year, Lt. Scott went to the San Juan River] with two scouts and 21 enlisted men. The Navajos believed Lt. Scott was there to drive off the whites who had settled on the reservation and had fenced off the river from the Navajo. Scott found evidence of many non-Navajo ranches. Only three were active, and the owners wanted payment for their improvements before leaving. Scott ejected them.<ref>Scott,\" June 22, 1887 letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona</ref>\n\nIn 1890, a local rancher refused to pay the Navajo a fine of livestock. The Navajo tried to collect it, and whites in southern Colorado and Utah claimed that 9,000 of the Navajo were on a warpath. A small military detachment out of Fort Wingate restored white citizens to order.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn 1913, an Indian agent ordered a Navajo and his three wives to come in, and then arrested them for having a plural marriage. A small group of Navajo used force to free the women and retreated to [[Beautiful Mountain]] with 30 or 40 sympathizers. They refused to surrender to the agent, and local law enforcement and military refused the agent's request for an armed engagement. General Scott arrived, and with the help of [[Henry Chee Dodge]], a leader among the Navajo, defused the situation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Boarding schools and education===\n{{main|American Indian boarding schools}}\nDuring the time on the reservation, the Navajo tribe was forced to assimilate to white society. Navajo children were sent to boarding schools within the reservation and off the reservation. The first [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) school opened at [[Fort Defiance, Arizona|Fort Defiance]] in 1870<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ftdefiance.navajochapters.org/|website=FORT DEFIANCE CHAPTER|accessdate=31 May 2017|title=Fort Defiance Chapter}}</ref> and led the way for eight others to be established.<ref name=\"Lawrence Erlbaum Associates\">{{cite book|last1=McCarty|first1=T.L.|last2=Bia|first2=Fred|title=A Place to be Navajo: Rough Rock and the Struggle for Self-Determination in Indigenous Schooling|date=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-3760-4|page=42}}</ref> Many older Navajo were against this education and would hide their children to keep them from being taken.\n\nOnce the children arrived at the boarding school, their lives changed dramatically. European Americans taught the classes under an English-only curriculum and punished any student caught speaking Navajo.<ref name=\"Lawrence Erlbaum Associates\"/> The children were under militaristic discipline, run by the ''Sil\u00e1o''.{{Clarify|reason=Silao is a Navajo word for Police Officer.

This report discussed Indian boarding schools as being inadequate in terms of diet, medical services, dormitory overcrowding, undereducated teachers, restrictive discipline, and manual labor by the students to keep the school running.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCarty|first1=T.L.|last2=Bia|first2=Fred|title=A Place to be Navajo: Rough Rock and the Struggle for Self-Determination in Indigenous Schooling|date=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-3760-4|page=48}}</ref>\n\nThis report was the precursor to education reforms initiated under President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], under which two new schools were built on the Navajo reservation. But Rough Rock Day School was run in the same militaristic style as Fort Defiance and did not implement the educational reforms. The Evangelical Missionary School was opened next to Rough Rock Day School. Navajo accounts of this school portray it as having a family-like atmosphere with home-cooked meals, new or gently used clothing, humane treatment, and a Navajo-based curriculum. Educators found the Evangelical Missionary School curriculum to be much more beneficial for the Navajo children.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCarty|first1=T.L.|last2=Bia|first2=Fred|title=A Place to be Navajo: Rough Rock and the Struggle for Self-Determination in Indigenous Schooling|date=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-3760-4|pages=50\u20131}}</ref>\n\n[[File:\"Navajo Woman and Infant, Canyon de Chelle, Arizona.\" (Canyon de Chelly National Monument), 1933 - 1942 - NARA - 519947.jpg|thumb|left|''Untitled''.

It is a repository for sound recordings, manuscripts, paintings, and sandpainting tapestries of the Navajos. It also featured exhibits to express the beauty, dignity, and logic of Navajo religion. When Klah met Cabot in 1921, he had witnessed decades of efforts by the US government and  missionaries to assimilate the Navajos into mainstream society. The museum was founded to preserve the religion and traditions of the Navajo, which Klah was sure would otherwise soon be lost forever.\n\n===Livestock Reduction 1930s\u20131950s===\n{{see also|Navajo Livestock Reduction}}\nThe [[Navajo Livestock Reduction]] was imposed upon the Navajo Nation by the federal government starting in the 1933, during the [[Great Depression]].<ref>Peter Iverson, ''Dine: A History of the Navajos,'' 2002, University of New Mexico Press, Chapter 5, \"our People Cried\": 1923\u20131941.</ref> Under various forms it continued into the 1950s. Worried about large herds in the arid climate, at a time when the Dust Bowl was endangering the Great Plains, the government decided that the land of the Navajo Nation could support only a fixed number of sheep, goats, cattle, and horses. The Federal government believed that land erosion was worsening in the area and the only solution was to reduce the number of livestock.\n\nIn 1933, [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]] was appointed commissioner of the BIA. In many ways, he worked to reform government relations with the Native American tribes, but the reduction program was devastating for the Navajo, for whom their livestock was so important. The government set land capacity in terms of \"sheep units\".  In 1930 the Navajo grazed 1,100,000 mature sheep units.<ref name=\"Reduction\">{{cite book | author=Compiled | editor=Roessel, Ruth |title=Navajo Livestock Reduction: A National Disgrace | location=Tsaile, Arizona | publisher=Navajo Community College Press | year=1974 | isbn=0-912586-18-4}}</ref> These sheep provided half the cash income for the individual Navajo.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Iverson|title=\"For Our Navajo People\": Din\u00e9 Letters, Speeches & Petitions, 1900-1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dU2_8WAkD4EC&pg=PA250|year=2002|publisher=U of New Mexico Press|page=250|isbn=9780826327185}}</ref>\n\nCollier's solution was to first launch a voluntary reduction program, which was made mandatory two years later in 1935. The government paid for part of the value of each animal, but it did nothing to compensate for the loss of future yearly income for so many Navajo. In the [[matrilineal]] and matrilocal world of the Navajo, women were especially hurt, as many lost their only source of income with the reduction of livestock herds.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 25443605|title = Gendered Injustice: Navajo Livestock Reduction in the New Deal Era|journal = Western Historical Quarterly|volume = 38|issue = 4|pages = 437\u2013455|last1 = Weisiger|first1 = Marsha|year = 2007|doi = 10.2307/25443605|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5612987e5b94ff46d5b9ffaaad5f556be04bc308}}</ref>\n\nThe Navajo did not understand why their centuries-old practices of raising livestock should change.<ref name=\"Reduction\" /> They were united in opposition but they were unable to stop it.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard White, ch 13: \"The Navajos become Dependent\"|title=The Roots of Dependency: Subsistence, Environment, and Social Change Among the Choctaws, Pawnees, and Navajos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_be-2k1oScC&pg=PA300|year=1988|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|pages=300ff|isbn=0803297246}}</ref> Historian Brian Dippie notes that the [[Indian Rights Association]] denounced Collier as a 'dictator' and accused him of a \"near reign of terror\" on the Navajo reservation.

Many Navajo men volunteered for military service in keeping with their warrior culture, and they served in integrated units. The War Department in 1940 rejected a proposal by the BIA that segregated units be created for the Indians. The Navajo gained firsthand experience with how they could assimilate into the modern world, and many did not return to the overcrowded reservation, which had few jobs.<ref>Alison R. Bernstein, ''American Indians and World War II: Toward a New Era in Indian Affairs,'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1999) pp 40, 67, 132, 152</ref>\n\nFour hundred [[Navajo code talkers]] played a famous role during World War II by relaying radio messages using their own language. The Japanese were unable to understand or decode it.<ref>Bernstein, ''American Indians and World War II'' pp 46\u201349</ref>\n\nIn the 1940s, large quantities of uranium were discovered in Navajo land. From then into the early 21st century, the U.S. allowed mining without sufficient environmental protection for workers, waterways, and land. The Navajo have claimed high rates of death and illness from lung disease and cancer resulting from environmental contamination. Since the 1970s, legislation has helped to regulate the industry and reduce the toll, but the government has not yet offered holistic and comprehensive compensation.<ref>Judy Pasternak, ''Yellow Dirt- An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed,'' Free Press, New York, 2010.</ref>\n\n===U.S. Marine Corps Involvement===\nThe Navajo Code Talkers played a significant role in the history of [[USMC]] history. Using their own language they utilized a military code; for example, the Navajo word \"turtle\" represented a tank. In 1942, Marine staff officers composed several combat simulations and the Navajo translated it and transmitted in their dialect to another Navajo on the other line. This Navajo then translated it back in english faster than any other cryptographic facilities, which demonstrated their efficacy. As a result, General Vogel recommended their recruitment into the USMC code talker program. \n\nEach Navajo went through basic bootcamp at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego|Marine Corps Recruit Depot]], San Diego before being assigned to Field Signal Battalion training at [[Camp Pendleton]]. Once the code talkers completed training in the States, they were sent to the Pacific for assignment to the Marine combat divisions. With that said, there was never a crack in the Navajo language, it was never deciphered. It is known that many more Navajos volunteered to become code talkers than could be accepted; however, an undetermined number of other Navajos served as Marines in the war, but not as code talkers. \n\nThese achievements of the Navajo Code Talkers have resulted in an honorable chapter in USMC history. Their patriotism and honor inevitably earned them the respect of all Americans.<ref> Marine Corps.

Their extended kinship groups had seasonal dwelling areas to accommodate livestock, agriculture, and gathering practices. As part of their traditional economy, Navajo groups may have formed trading or raiding parties, traveling relatively long distances.\n\nThere is a system of [[clans]] which defines relationships between individuals and families. The clan system is [[exogamy|exogamous]]: people can only marry (and date) partners outside their own clans, which for this purpose include the clans of their four grandparents. Some Navajo favor their\nchildren to marry into their father\u2019s clan. While clans are associated with a geographical area, the area is not for the exclusive use of any one clan. Members of a clan may live hundreds of miles apart but still have a clan bond.<ref name=\"Longwalk\">{{cite book | author=Compiled | editor=Roessel, Ruth | title=Navajo Stories of the Long Walk Period | location=Tsaile, Arizona | publisher=Navajo Community College Press | year=1973 | isbn=0-912586-16-8 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/navajostoriesofl0000unse }}</ref>{{rp|xix-xxi}}\n\nHistorically, the structure of the Navajo society is largely a [[matrilineal]] system, in which the family of the women owned livestock, dwellings, planting areas and livestock grazing areas. Once married, a Navajo man would follow a [[matrilocal]] residence and live with his bride in her dwelling and near her mother's family. Daughters (or, if necessary, other female relatives) were traditionally the ones who received the generational property inheritance. In cases of marital separation, women would maintain the property and children.  Children are \"born to\" and belong to the mother's clan, and are \"born for\" the father's clan. The mother's eldest brother has a strong role in her children's lives. As adults, men represent their mother's clan in tribal politics.<ref name=\"TheNavajo\" /> <!--Note: matrilocal is not the equivalent as matriarchal-->\n\nNeither sex can live without the other in the Navajo culture. Men and women are seen as contemporary equals as both a male and female are needed to reproduce. Although women may carry a bigger burden, fertility is so highly valued that males are expected to provide economic resources (known as [[bride wealth]]). Corn is a symbol of fertility in Navajo culture as they eat white corn in the wedding ceremonies. It is considered to be immoral and/or stealing if one does not provide for the other in that premarital or marital relationship. <ref> Lauren Del Carlo, ''Between the Sacred Mountains: A Cultural History of the Dineh,'' Essai, Volume 5: Article 15, 2007.</ref>\n===Ethnobotany===\nSee [[Navajo ethnobotany]].\n\n===Traditional dwellings===\n[[File:Navajo hogan.jpg|thumb|left|A Navajo hogan (with a woodshed)]]\nA [[hogan]], the traditional Navajo home, is built as a shelter for either a man or for a woman. Male hogans are square or conical with a distinct rectangular entrance, while a female hogan is an eight-sided house.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Both are made of logs and covered in mud, with the door always facing east to welcome the sun each morning. Navajos also have several types of hogans for lodging and ceremonial use. Ceremonies, such as healing ceremonies or the [[Blessing Way|''kinaald\u00e1'']], take place inside a hogan.<ref>Iverson, Nez, and Deer, 23</ref> According to Kehoe, this style of housing is distinctive to the Navajos. She writes, \"even today, a solidly constructed, log-walled Hogan is preferred by many Navajo families.\" Most Navajo members today live in apartments and houses in urban areas.<ref name=k>Kehoe, 133</ref>\n\nThose who practice the Navajo religion regard the hogan as sacred. The religious song \"[[The Blessingway]]\" (''{{spell-nv|h\u00f3zh\u01eb\u0301\u01eb\u0301j\u00ed}}'') describes the first hogan as being built by Coyote with help from Beavers to be a house for First Man, First Woman, and Talking God. The Beaver People gave Coyote logs and instructions on how to build the first hogan. Navajos made their hogans in the traditional fashion until the 1900s, when they started to make them in hexagonal and octagonal shapes. Hogans continue to be used as dwellings, especially by older Navajos, although they tend to be made with modern construction materials and techniques.

The First World beings had offended him and were asked to leave. From there, they headed south and arrived in the Third World, or Yellow World. The four sacred mountains were found here, but due to a great flood, First Woman, First Man, and the Holy People were forced to find another world to live in.

[[Atsidi Sani]] (c. 1830\u2013c. 1918) is considered to be the first Navajo silversmith. He learned silversmithing from a Mexican man called ''Nakai Tsosi'' (\"Thin Mexican\") around 1878 and began teaching other Navajos how to work with silver.<ref>Adair 4</ref> By 1880, Navajo silversmiths were creating [[handmade jewelry]] including bracelets, tobacco flasks, [[necklace]]s and [[bracer]]s. Later, they added silver [[earrings]], [[buckles]], [[Bolo tie|bolos]], hair ornaments, pins and squash blossom necklaces for tribal use, and to sell to tourists as a way to supplement their income.<ref>Adair 135</ref>\n\nThe Navajos' hallmark jewelry piece called the \"squash blossom\" necklace first appeared in the 1880s. The term \"squash blossom\" was apparently attached to the name of the Navajo necklace at an early date, although its bud-shaped beads are thought to derive from Spanish-Mexican [[pomegranate]] designs.<ref>Adair 44</ref> The Navajo silversmiths also borrowed the \"naja\" (''najahe'' in Navajo)<ref>Adair, 9</ref> symbol to shape the silver pendant that hangs from the \"squash blossom\" necklace.\n\n[[Turquoise]] has been part of jewelry for centuries, but Navajo artists did not use inlay techniques to insert turquoise into silver designs until the late 19th century.\n\n===Weaving===\n{{Main|Navajo weaving}}\n[[File:Navajo sheep & weaver.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Navajo weaver with sheep]]\n[[File:Navajo Germantown Rug 2008.008.001.jpg|180px|thumb|Navajo Germantown Eye Dazzler Rug, [[Science History Institute]] ]]\n[[File:Probably Bayeta-style Blanket with Terrace and Stepped Design, 1870-1880, 50.67.54.jpg|thumbnail|''Probably Bayeta-style Blanket with Terrace and Stepped Design'', 1870\u20131880, 50.67.54, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nNavajos came to the southwest with their own weaving traditions; however, they learned to weave cotton on upright looms from Pueblo peoples. The first Spaniards to visit the region wrote about seeing Navajo blankets. By the 18th century the Navajos had begun to import Bayeta red yarn to supplement local black, grey, and white wool, as well as wool dyed with [[indigo dye|indigo]]. Using an upright loom, the Navajos made extremely fine utilitarian blankets that were collected by [[Ute tribe|Ute]] and [[Plains Indians]]. These Chief's Blankets, so called because only chiefs or very wealthy individuals could afford them, were characterized by horizontal stripes and minimal patterning in red. First Phase Chief's Blankets have only horizontal stripes, Second Phase feature red rectangular designs, and Third Phase feature red diamonds and partial diamond patterns.\n\nThe completion of the railroads dramatically changed Navajo weaving. Cheap blankets were imported, so Navajo weavers shifted their focus to weaving rugs for an increasingly non-Native audience. Rail service also brought in Germantown wool from [[Philadelphia]], commercially dyed wool which greatly expanded the weavers' color palettes.\n\nSome early European-American settlers moved in and set up trading posts, often buying [[Navajo rug]]s by the pound and selling them back east by the bale. The traders encouraged the locals to weave blankets and [[Navajo Rug|rugs]] into distinct styles. These included \"Two Gray Hills\" (predominantly black and white, with traditional patterns); ''Teec Nos Pos'' (colorful, with very extensive patterns); \"Ganado\" (founded by [[Don Lorenzo Hubbell]]<ref>[http://www.wmonline.com/attract/pforest/hubbell.htm \"Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site\"] ''White Mountains Online.'' (retrieved 28 Nov 2010)</ref>), red-dominated patterns with black and white; \"Crystal\" (founded by J. B. Moore); oriental and [[Persian rug|Persian]] styles (almost always with [[natural dye]]s); \"Wide Ruins\", \"Chinlee\", banded geometric patterns; \"Klagetoh\", diamond-type patterns; \"Red Mesa\" and bold diamond patterns.<ref>Denver Art Museum. [http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/6aa/6aa75.htm \"Blanket Statements\"], ''Traditional Fine Arts Organization.'' (retrieved 28 Nov 2010)</ref> Many of these patterns exhibit a fourfold symmetry, which is thought to embody traditional ideas about harmony or ''[[h\u00f3zh\u01eb\u0301]]''.\n\n==In the media==\nIn 2000 the documentary ''[[The Return of Navajo Boy]]'' was shown at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It was written in response to an earlier film, ''[[The Navajo Boy]]'' which was somewhat exploitative of those Navajos involved. ''The Return of Navajo Boy'' allowed the Navajos to be more involved in the depictions of themselves.<ref name=navajoboy.com>{{cite web|title=Synopsis |work=navajoboy.com |url=http://www.navajoboy.com/press.htm |accessdate=2009-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208005920/http://www.navajoboy.com/press.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the final episode of the third season of the FX reality TV show ''[[30 Days (TV series)|30 Days]]'', the show's producer [[Morgan Spurlock]] spends thirty days living with a Navajo family on their reservation in New Mexico.
