Wilson (Lanham, Maryland: Rowman & Littlefield, 2017): 697-98.</ref> Because of the usage of traditional building methods and local builders, vernacular buildings are considered part of a regional culture.\n\nVernacular architecture can be contrasted against elite or [[polite architecture]] which is characterized by stylistic elements of design intentionally incorporated for aesthetic purposes which go beyond a building's functional requirements. This article also covers the term '''traditional architecture''', which exists somewhere between the two extremes yet still is based upon authentic themes.<ref>Holm, 2006</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term [[wikt:vernacular|vernacular]] means \"domestic, native, indigenous\"; from ''verna'', meaning \"native slave\" or \"home-born slave\". The word probably derives from an older [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] word.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=vernacular|title=Vernacular|publisher=online etymology dictionary|accessdate=2007-12-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/wotd/wotd.pl?word=vernacular|publisher=yourdictionary.com|title=Vernacular(noun)|accessdate=2007-12-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020608/windows/roots.htm|title=Fiddling with words, again!|date=June 8, 2002|publisher=Tribune India|accessdate=2007-12-24}}</ref>\n\nThe term is borrowed from [[linguistics]], where [[vernacular]] refers to language use particular to a time, place or group.<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/vernacular Dictionary.com definition]</ref><ref>[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=88049&dict=CALD Cambridge advanced learner's dictionary definition]</ref><ref>[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/vernacular Merriam\u2013Webster definition]</ref>\n\n==Definitions==\nVernacular architecture is described as a built environment that is based upon local needs; defined by the availability of particular materials indigenous to its particular region; and reflects local traditions and cultural practices. Traditionally, the study of vernacular architecture did not examine formally schooled [[architect]]s, but instead that of the design skills and tradition of local builders, who were rarely given any attribution for the work. More recently, vernacular architecture has been examined by designers and the building industry in an effort to be more energy conscious with contemporary design and construction\u2014part of a broader interest in [[sustainable design]].\n\nThe terms [[vernacular]], [[Folk culture|folk]], [[traditional]], common, ordinary, and [[wikt:popular|popular]] architecture are sometimes used interchangeably. However, Allen Noble wrote a lengthy discussion of these terms in ''Traditional Buildings: A Global Survey of Structural Forms and Cultural Functions'' where he presents scholarly opinions that folk building or ''folk architecture'' is built by \"persons not professionally trained in building arts\"; where ''vernacular architecture'' is still ''of the common people'' but may be built by trained professionals such as through an [[apprenticeship]], but still using local, traditional designs and materials. ''Traditional architecture'' is architecture is passed down from person to person, generation to generation, particularly orally, but at any level of society, not just by common people. Noble discourages use of the term ''primitive architecture'' as having a negative connotation.<ref>Noble, Allen George.

The function of the building would be the dominant factor, aesthetic considerations, though present to some small degree, being quite minimal. Local materials would be used as a matter of course, other materials being chosen and imported quite exceptionally.{{sfnp|Brunskill|1971|pages=27\u201328}}</blockquote>\n\nVernacular architecture is not to be confused with so-called \"traditional\" architecture, though there are links between the two. Traditional architecture also includes buildings which bear elements of [[polite design]]: [[temples]] and [[palaces]], for example, which normally would not be included under the rubric of \"vernacular.\" In architectural terms, 'the vernacular' can be contrasted with '[[the polite]]', which is characterised by stylistic elements of design intentionally incorporated by a professional [[architect]] for aesthetic purposes which go beyond a building's functional requirements.{{sfnp|William|2010|page=241}} Between the extremes of the wholly vernacular and the completely polite, examples occur which have some vernacular and some polite content,{{sfnp|Brunskill|1971|page=28}} often making the differences between the vernacular and the polite a matter of degree.\n\n[[File:TraditionalArchitectureTurzaLaRioja.jpg|thumb|Dwelling of [[half-timbered]] construction on stone foundation, [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], Spain]]\nThe ''Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World'' defines vernacular architecture as:\n<blockquote>...comprising the dwellings and all other buildings of the people. Related to their environmental contexts and available resources they are customarily owner- or community-built, utilizing traditional technologies. All forms of vernacular architecture are built to meet specific needs, accommodating the values, economies and ways of life of the cultures that produce them.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World'', volume 1, page not cited</ref></blockquote>\n\nVernacular architecture is a broad, [[grassroots]] concept which encompasses fields of architectural study including aboriginal, indigenous, ancestral, rural, and ethnic architecture<ref>https://nattydecor.com/what-is-vernacular-architecture/, {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507021335/http://ethnoarchitecture.org/ |date=2013-05-07 }} accessed 5/2/2013</ref> and is contrasted with the more intellectual architecture called polite, formal, or academic architecture just as [[folk art]] is contrasted with [[fine art]].\n<!--Better to keep this concise and include in country specific sections as article is expanded. In Japan, for example, not all pre-modern architecture is \"vernacular,\" which would usually refer only to rural buildings and [[structures]]. In the [[US]], vernacular architecture might refer to a so-called craftsman [[bungalow]], fashionable in the nineteenth century, even though the bungalow as an architectural form did not originate in the US. \"Vernacular\" might even refer to a building like the 1848 Duncan House in [[Cooksville]], [[Wisconsin]]. -->\n\nWilliam,{{sfnp|William|2010|page=241}} after Brunskill, regards the 'Vernacular Zone' as being a range of buildings between two thresholds: the Vernacular and the Polite.{{sfnp|Brunskill|1971|pages=25\u201329}}  These were below the Polite Threshold, but also had to be above the Vernacular Threshold. Buildings cruder than this did not survive, and so were not recorded. This was due to both their unimportance and the lack of attention paid to them, also to the insubstantial nature of their poor materials. A survey in the 1940s by Sir Cyril Fox and Lord Raglan examined 450 'old' cottages in Monmouthshire expected to date them to the medieval period. However careful study dated them to the late eighteenth century or later: 'cottages'{{efn-lr|i.e. the homes of married labourers, rather than servants}} earlier than this had simply not survived.{{sfnp|William|2010|page=241}}{{sfnp|Fox|Raglan|1954|page=210}}\n\n==Vernacular and the architect==\nArchitecture designed by professional architects is usually not considered to be vernacular. Indeed, it can be argued that the very process of consciously designing a building makes it not vernacular. [[Paul Oliver]], in his book ''Dwellings'', states: \"...it is contended that 'popular architecture' designed by professional architects or commercial builders for popular use, does not come within the compass of the vernacular\".<ref name=\"Oliver2003\" >{{cite book\n  |last1=Oliver |first1=Paul |authorlink1=Paul Oliver\n  |title=Dwellings \n  |year=2003 \n  |publisher=Phaidon Press |location=London\n  |isbn=0-7148-4202-8\n  |page=15\n}}</ref>{{rp|15}} Oliver also offers the following simple definition of vernacular architecture: \"the architecture of the people, and by the people, but not for the people.\"<ref name=\"Oliver2003\"/>{{rp|14}}\n\n[[Frank Lloyd Wright]] described vernacular architecture as \"Folk building growing in response to actual needs, fitted into environment by people who knew no better than to fit them with native feeling\".<ref name=\"Oliver2003\"/>{{rp|9}} suggesting that it is a primitive form of design, lacking intelligent thought, but he also stated that it was \"for us better worth study than all the highly self-conscious academic attempts at the beautiful throughout Europe\".\n\n[[File:Velika planina 031.JPG|thumbnail|right|A post-World War II dwelling at the [[Big Pasture Plateau]], [[Slovenia]], designed by the architect [[Vlasto Kopa\u010d]] and based on the vernacular architecture of this mountainous area.]]\n\nSince at least the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], many modern architects have studied vernacular buildings and claimed to draw inspiration from them, including aspects of the vernacular in their designs. In 1946, the [[Egypt]]ian architect [[Hassan Fathy]] was appointed to design the town of [[New Gourna]] near [[Luxor]]. Having studied traditional [[Nubian people|Nubian]] settlements and technologies, he incorporated the traditional mud brick vaults of the Nubian settlements in his designs. The experiment failed, due to a variety of social and economic reasons, but is the first recorded attempt by an architect to address the social and environmental requirements of building users by adopting the methods and forms of the vernacular.<ref name=\"Oliver2003\"/>{{rp|11}}\n\nIn 1964 the exhibition ''Architecture Without Architects'' was put on at the [[Museum of Modern Art, New York]] by [[Bernard Rudofsky]]. Accompanied by a book of the same title, including black-and-white photography of vernacular buildings around the world, the exhibition was extremely popular. It was Rudofsky who first made use of the term vernacular in an architectural context, and brought the concept into the eye of the public and of mainstream architecture: \"For want of a generic label we shall call it vernacular, anonymous, spontaneous, indigenous, rural, as the case may be.\"<ref name=Rudofsky>Rudofsky, ''Architecture Without Architects'', page 58</ref>  However, the range of studies about vernacular architecture since the book's publication suggests that Rudofsky's characterization was limiting and problematic; indeed, quite often vernacular architecture is ''not'' anonymous and designed in very intentional ways that are learned through generations of practice and based upon the availability of particular materials and profoundly affected by climate (and, thus, not \"spontaneous.\")\n\nSince the emergence of the term in the 1970s, vernacular considerations have played an increasing part in architectural designs, although individual architects had widely varying opinions of the merits of the vernacular.\n\nSri Lankan architect [[Geoffrey Bawa]] is considered the pioneer of regional modernism in [[South Asia]]. Along with him, modern proponents of the use of the vernacular in architectural design include [[Charles Correa]], a well known Indian architect; [[Muzharul Islam]] and [[Bashirul Haq]], internationally known [[List of Bangladeshi architects|Bangladeshi architects]]; [[Balkrishna Doshi]], another Indian, who established the Vastu-Shilpa Foundation in [[Ahmedabad]] to research the vernacular architecture of the region; and [[Sheila Sri Prakash]] who has used rural Indian architecture as an inspiration for innovations in environmental and socio-economically sustainable design and planning. The Dutch architect [[Aldo van Eyck]] was also a proponent of vernacular architecture.<ref name=\"Oliver2003\"/>{{rp|13}} Architects whose work exemplifies the modern take on vernacular architecture would be [[Samuel Mockbee]], [[Christopher Alexander]] and [[Paolo Soleri]].\n\nOliver claims that:\n<blockquote>As yet there is no clearly defined and specialized discipline for the study of dwellings or the larger compass of vernacular architecture. If such a discipline were to emerge it would probably be one that combines some of the elements of both architecture and anthropology with aspects of history and geography<ref name=\"Oliver2003\"/>{{clarify|date=September 2013}}</blockquote>\n\nArchitects have developed a renewed interest in vernacular architecture as a model for sustainable design.<ref>Forster, W., Heal, A. and Paradise, C.,  \"The Vernacular as a Model for Sustainable Design\" Chapter 14 in: W. Weber, S. Yannas, ''Lessons from Vernacular Architecture'', Routledge, 2013</ref>\n\n==Influences on the vernacular==\n[[File:Brgule 001.jpg|thumb|House in [[Brgule]], Serbia]]\nVernacular architecture is influenced by a great range of different aspects of human behaviour and environment, leading to differing building forms for almost every different context; even neighbouring villages may have subtly different approaches to the construction and use of their dwellings, even if they at first appear the same. Despite these variations, every building is subject to the same laws of physics, and hence will demonstrate significant similarities in [[structural engineering|structural forms]].\n\n===Climate===\nOne of the most significant influences on vernacular architecture is the macro climate of the area in which the building is constructed. Buildings in cold climates invariably have high thermal mass or significant amounts of insulation. They are usually sealed in order to prevent heat loss, and openings such as windows tend to be small or non-existent. Buildings in warm climates, by contrast, tend to be constructed of lighter materials and to allow significant cross-ventilation through openings in the fabric of the building.\n\n[[File:M\u00fazeum kysuckej dediny-1.jpg|thumb|left|A [[log cabin]] in the region of [[Kysuce]] ([[Slovakia]]) - an example of vernacular architecture in relatively cold mountain climate using local materials ([[wood]]).]]\nBuildings for a continental climate must be able to cope with significant variations in temperature, and may even be altered by their occupants according to the seasons. In hot arid and semi-arid regions, vernacular structures typically include a number of distinctive elements to provide for ventilation and temperature control. Across the middle-east, these elements included such design features as courtyard gardens with water features, screen walls, reflected light, ''[[mashrabiya]]'' (the distinctive [[oriel window]] with timber lattice-work) and ''bad girs'' ([[Windcatcher|wind-catchers]]).<ref name=archinform>{{archINFORM|arch|10796}}</ref> \n[[File:Queenslander home, Australia.jpg|thumb|Queenslander, Australia]]\nBuildings take different forms depending on precipitation levels in the region \u2013 leading to dwellings on stilts in many regions with frequent flooding or rainy monsoon seasons. For example, the [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] is an elevated weatherboard house with a sloped, tin roof that evolved in the early 19th-century as a solution to the annual flooding caused by monsoonal rain in Australia's northern states.<ref name=\"LinOsb\">{{cite web|last1=Osborne|first1=Lindy|title=Sublime design: the Queenslander|url=http://www.architectureanddesign.com.au/features/comment/sublime-design-the-queenslander|website=Architecture & Design|accessdate=24 February 2018}}</ref> Flat roofs are rare in areas with high levels of precipitation. Similarly, areas with high winds will lead to specialised buildings able to cope with them, and buildings tend to present minimal surface area to prevailing winds and are often situated low on the landscape to minimise potential storm damage.\n\nClimatic influences on vernacular architecture are substantial and can be extremely complex. Mediterranean vernacular, and that of much of the Middle East, often includes a courtyard with a fountain or pond; air cooled by water mist and evaporation is drawn through the building by the natural ventilation set up by the building form. Similarly, Northern African vernacular often has very high thermal mass and small windows to keep the occupants cool, and in many cases also includes chimneys, not for fires but to draw air through the internal spaces. Such specializations are not designed, but learned by trial and error over generations of building construction, often existing long before the scientific theories which explain why they work. Vernacular Architecture is also used for the purposes of local citizens.\n\n===Culture===\nThe way of life of building occupants, and the way they use their shelters, is of great influence on building forms. The size of family units, who shares which spaces, how food is prepared and eaten, how people interact and many other cultural considerations will affect the layout and size of dwellings.\n\nFor example, the family units of several East African ethnic communities live in family compounds, surrounded by marked boundaries, in which separate single-roomed dwellings are built to house different members of the family. In polygamous communities there may be separate dwellings for different wives, and more again for sons who are too old to share space with the women of the family. Social interaction within the family is governed by, and privacy is provided by, the separation between the structures in which family members live. By contrast, in Western Europe, such separation is accomplished inside one dwelling, by dividing the building into separate rooms.\n\nCulture also has a great influence on the appearance of vernacular buildings, as occupants often decorate buildings in accordance with local customs and beliefs.\n\n====Nomadic dwellings====\n[[File:cempa stilthouses.jpg|thumb|Stilt houses in Cempa, located in the [[Lingga Islands]] of Indonesia.]]\n[[File:Yurt-construction-2.JPG|thumb|A [[Yurt]] or ger, a circular dwelling from [[Mongolia]], during erection]]\n[[File:igloo.jpg|thumb|An unfinished [[Igloo]], an [[Inuit]] winter dwelling]]\nThere are many cultures around the world which include some aspect of nomadic life, and they have all developed vernacular solutions for the need for shelter. These all include appropriate responses to climate and customs of their inhabitants, including practicalities of simple construction such as [[Hut (dwelling)|huts]], and if necessary, transport such as [[tent]]s.\n\nThe [[Inuit]] people have a number of different forms of shelter appropriate to different seasons and geographical locations, including the [[igloo]] (for winter) and the [[tupiq]] (for summer). The [[Sami people|Sami]] of Northern Europe, who live in climates similar to those experienced by the Inuit, have developed different shelters appropriate to their culture<ref name=\"Oliver2003\"/>{{rp|25}} including the [[lavvu]] and [[goahti]]. The development of different solutions in similar circumstances because of cultural influences is typical of vernacular architecture.\n\nMany nomadic people use materials common in the local environment to construct temporary dwellings, such as the Punan of Sarawak who use palm fronds, or the Ituri Pygmies who use saplings and mongongo leaves to construct domed huts. Other cultures reuse materials, transporting them with them as they move. Examples of this are the tribes of Mongolia, who carry their [[yurt|gers]] (yurts) with them, or the black desert tents of the Qashgai in [[Iran]].<ref name=\"Oliver2003\"/>{{rp|29}} Notable in each case is the significant impact of the availability of materials and the availability of pack animals or other forms of transport on the ultimate form of the shelters.\n\nAll the shelters are adapted to suit the local climate. The Mongolian gers (yurts), for example, are versatile enough to be cool in hot continental summers and warm in the sub-zero temperaturs of Mongolian winters, and include a close-able ventilation hole at the centre and a chimney for a stove. A ger is typically not often relocated, and is therefore sturdy and secure, including wooden front door and several layers of coverings. A traditional [[Berbers|Berber]] tent, by contrast, might be relocated daily, and is much lighter and quicker to erect and dismantle \u2013 and because of the climate it is used in, does not need to provide the same degree of protection from the elements.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Tuareg 1907.jpg|Tuareg tent during Colonial exhibition in 1907.\nImage:Nez-perce-couple-teepee-1900.jpg|A [[tipi]] of the [[Nez Perce tribe]], [[circa]] 1900.\nImage:Algerian_nomads.jpg|Arab Beduin tent from North Africa. Similar tents are also used by Arabs in the Middle East as well as by Persian and Tibetan nomads.\nFile:BerberTentZagora.jpg|A Berber tent near Zagora, Morocco\nFile:F\u00e4bod i Oviksfj\u00e4llen.JPG|In [[transhumance]] (the seasonal movement of people with their livestock to pasture) the herders stay in huts or tents.\nFile:Iraqi mudhif interior.jpg|Interior of a mudhif; a reed dwelling used by Iraqi people of the marshlands\n</gallery>\n\n====Permanent dwellings====\n[[File:Lesotho Slide Show (294).JPG|thumb|A Southern African rondavel (or banda)]]\n\nThe type of structure and materials used for a dwelling vary depending on how permanent it is. Frequently moved nomadic structures will be lightweight and simple, more permanent ones will be less so. When people settle somewhere permanently, the architecture of their dwellings will change to reflect that.\n\nMaterials used will become heavier, more solid and more durable. They may also become more complicated and more expensive, as the capital and labour required to construct them is a one-time cost. Permanent dwellings often offer a greater degree of protection and shelter from the elements. In some cases however, where dwellings are subjected to severe weather conditions such as frequent flooding or high winds, buildings may be deliberately \"designed\" to fail and be replaced, rather than requiring the uneconomical or even impossible structures needed to withstand them. The collapse of a relatively flimsy, lightweight structure is also less likely to cause serious injury than a heavy structure.\n\nOver time, dwellings' architecture may come to reflect a very specific geographical locale.\n\n===Environment, construction elements and materials===\nThe local environment and the construction materials it can provide, govern many aspects of vernacular architecture. Areas rich in trees will develop a wooden vernacular, while areas without much wood may use mud or stone. In early California [[Cupressaceae|redwood]] water towers supporting redwood tanks and enclosed by redwood siding [[Tankhouse|(tankhouses)]] were part of a self-contained wind-powered domestic water system. In the Far East it is common to use bamboo, as it is both plentiful and versatile. Vernacular, almost by definition, is sustainable, and will not exhaust the local resources. If it is not sustainable, it is not suitable for its local context, and cannot be vernacular.\n\nConstruction elements and materials frequently found in vernacular buildings include:\n* [[Adobe]] - a type of mud brick, often covered with white-wash, commonly used in Spain and Spanish colonies\n* [[Windcatcher|Bad girs]] -a type of chimney used to provide natural ventilation, commonly found in Iran, Iraq and other parts of the Middle-East\n* [[Cob (material)|Cob]] - a type of plaster made from subsoil with the addition of fibrous material to give added strength\n* [[Mashrabiya]] - (also known as shanashol in Iraq) - a type of oriel window with timber lattice-work, designed to allow ventilation, commonly found in Iraq and Egypt in upper-class homes\n* [[Mudbrick|Mud brick]]s - loam or sand mixed with water and vegetable matter such as straw\n* [[Rammed earth]] often used in foundations\n* [[Thatching|Thatch]] - dry vegetation used as roofing material\n* [[Wychert]] - a blend of white earth and clay\n\n==Literature==\nFollowing the eclipse by [[International Modernism]] of turn-of-the 20th century vernacular-inspired British and American [[Arts and Crafts]] buildings and European [[National Romanticism]], an early work in the renewed defense of vernacular was [[Bernard Rudofsky]]'s 1964 book ''[[Architecture Without Architects|Architecture Without Architects: a short introduction to non-pedigreed architecture]]'', based on his [[MoMA]] exhibition.  The book was a reminder of the legitimacy and \"hard-won knowledge\" inherent in vernacular buildings, from [[Wieliczka|Polish salt-caves]] to gigantic [[Syria]]n water wheels to [[Morocco|Moroccan]] desert fortresses, and was considered [[iconoclastic]] at the time.  Rudofsky was, however, very much a [[Romanticism|Romantic]] who viewed native populations in a historical bubble of contentment.  Rudofsky's book was also based largely on [[photographs]] and not on on-site study.\n\nA more nuanced work is the ''[[Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World]]'' edited in 1997 by [[Paul Oliver]] of the Oxford Institute for [[Sustainable Development]]. Oliver argues that vernacular architecture, given the insights it gives into issues of environmental adaptation, will be necessary in the future to \"ensure sustainability in both cultural and economic terms beyond the short term.\" [[Christopher Alexander]], in his book ''[[A Pattern Language]]'', attempted to identify adaptive features of traditional architecture that apply across cultures. [[Howard Davis (architect)|Howard Davis]]'s book ''[[The Culture of Building]]'' details the culture that enabled several vernacular traditions.\n\nSome extend the term vernacular to include any architecture outside the [[academic]] mainstream. The term \"commercial vernacular\", popularized in the late 1960s by the publication of [[Robert Venturi]]'s \"Learning from Las Vegas\", refers to 20th-century American [[suburban]] tract and commercial architecture. There is also the concept of an \"industrial vernacular\" with its emphasis on the [[aesthetics]] of [[Workshop|shops]], [[automobile repair shop|garages]] and [[factories]]. Some have linked vernacular with \"off-the-shelf\" aesthetics. In any respect, those who study these types of vernaculars hold that the low-end characteristics of this aesthetic define a useful and fundamental approach to architectural design.\n\nAmong those who study vernacular architecture are those who are interested in the question of everyday life and those lean toward questions of [[sociology]]. In this, many were influenced by ''[[The Practice of Everyday Life]]'' (1984) by [[Michel de Certeau]].\n\n==Humanitarian response==\n[[File:Sutyagin house 1.JPG|thumb|\"[[Sutyagin House]]\", a wooden single-family house \u2013 declared illegal by the city of [[Arkhangelsk]] because of the fire hazard]]\nAn appreciation of vernacular architecture is increasingly seen as vital in the immediate response to [[disasters]] and the following construction of [[transitional shelter]] if it is needed. The work [https://web.archive.org/web/20071008030543/http://www.sheltercentre.org/shelterlibrary/publications/112.htm Transitional Settlement: Displaced Populations], produced by [http://www.sheltercentre.org/ Shelter Centre] covers the use of vernacular in [[humanitarian]] response and argues its importance.\n\nThe value of housing displaced people in shelters which are in some way familiar is seen to provide reassurance and comfort following often very traumatic times. As the needs change from saving lives to providing medium to long term shelter the construction of locally appropriate and accepted housing can be very important.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6202363.stm \"NGOs criticise tsunami shelters\"] ''BBC News'' \u2013 22 December 2006</ref>\n\n==Legal aspects==\nAs many jurisdictions introduce tougher [[building code]]s and [[zoning]] regulations, \"folk architects\" sometimes find themselves in conflict with the local authorities.\n\nA case that made news in Russia was that of an [[Arkhangelsk]] entrepreneur Nikolay P.

Vernacular architecture represents the majority of buildings and settlements created in pre-industrial societies and includes a very wide range of buildings, building traditions, and methods of construction.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R.

Wilson (Lanham, Maryland: Rowman & Littlefield, 2017): 697-98.</ref> Because of the usage of traditional building methods and local builders, vernacular buildings are considered part of a regional culture.\n\nVernacular architecture can be contrasted against elite or [[polite architecture]] which is characterized by stylistic elements of design intentionally incorporated for aesthetic purposes which go beyond a building's functional requirements. This article also covers the term '''traditional architecture''', which exists somewhere between the two extremes yet still is based upon authentic themes.<ref>Holm, 2006</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term [[wikt:vernacular|vernacular]] means \"domestic, native, indigenous\"; from ''verna'', meaning \"native slave\" or \"home-born slave\". The word probably derives from an older [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] word.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=vernacular|title=Vernacular|publisher=online etymology dictionary|accessdate=2007-12-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/wotd/wotd.pl?word=vernacular|publisher=yourdictionary.com|title=Vernacular(noun)|accessdate=2007-12-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020608/windows/roots.htm|title=Fiddling with words, again!|date=June 8, 2002|publisher=Tribune India|accessdate=2007-12-24}}</ref>\n\nThe term is borrowed from [[linguistics]], where [[vernacular]] refers to language use particular to a time, place or group.<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/vernacular Dictionary.com definition]</ref><ref>[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=88049&dict=CALD Cambridge advanced learner's dictionary definition]</ref><ref>[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/vernacular Merriam\u2013Webster definition]</ref>\n\n==Definitions==\nVernacular architecture is described as a built environment that is based upon local needs; defined by the availability of particular materials indigenous to its particular region; and reflects local traditions and cultural practices. Traditionally, the study of vernacular architecture did not examine formally schooled [[architect]]s, but instead that of the design skills and tradition of local builders, who were rarely given any attribution for the work. More recently, vernacular architecture has been examined by designers and the building industry in an effort to be more energy conscious with contemporary design and construction\u2014part of a broader interest in [[sustainable design]].\n\nThe terms [[vernacular]], [[Folk culture|folk]], [[traditional]], common, ordinary, and [[wikt:popular|popular]] architecture are sometimes used interchangeably. However, Allen Noble wrote a lengthy discussion of these terms in ''Traditional Buildings: A Global Survey of Structural Forms and Cultural Functions'' where he presents scholarly opinions that folk building or ''folk architecture'' is built by \"persons not professionally trained in building arts\"; where ''vernacular architecture'' is still ''of the common people'' but may be built by trained professionals such as through an [[apprenticeship]], but still using local, traditional designs and materials. ''Traditional architecture'' is architecture is passed down from person to person, generation to generation, particularly orally, but at any level of society, not just by common people. Noble discourages use of the term ''primitive architecture'' as having a negative connotation.<ref>Noble, Allen George. ''Traditional buildings: a global survey of structural forms and cultural functions''. London: I. B. Tauris, 2007. 1-17.

The function of the building would be the dominant factor, aesthetic considerations, though present to some small degree, being quite minimal. Local materials would be used as a matter of course, other materials being chosen and imported quite exceptionally.{{sfnp|Brunskill|1971|pages=27\u201328}}</blockquote>\n\nVernacular architecture is not to be confused with so-called \"traditional\" architecture, though there are links between the two. Traditional architecture also includes buildings which bear elements of [[polite design]]: [[temples]] and [[palaces]], for example, which normally would not be included under the rubric of \"vernacular.\" In architectural terms, 'the vernacular' can be contrasted with '[[the polite]]', which is characterised by stylistic elements of design intentionally incorporated by a professional [[architect]] for aesthetic purposes which go beyond a building's functional requirements.{{sfnp|William|2010|page=241}} Between the extremes of the wholly vernacular and the completely polite, examples occur which have some vernacular and some polite content,{{sfnp|Brunskill|1971|page=28}} often making the differences between the vernacular and the polite a matter of degree.\n\n[[File:TraditionalArchitectureTurzaLaRioja.jpg|thumb|Dwelling of [[half-timbered]] construction on stone foundation, [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], Spain]]\nThe ''Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World'' defines vernacular architecture as:\n<blockquote>...comprising the dwellings and all other buildings of the people. Related to their environmental contexts and available resources they are customarily owner- or community-built, utilizing traditional technologies. All forms of vernacular architecture are built to meet specific needs, accommodating the values, economies and ways of life of the cultures that produce them.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World'', volume 1, page not cited</ref></blockquote>\n\nVernacular architecture is a broad, [[grassroots]] concept which encompasses fields of architectural study including aboriginal, indigenous, ancestral, rural, and ethnic architecture<ref>http://www.vernaculararchitecture.com/{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, a site which is part of http://www.ethnoarchitecture.org/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507021335/http://ethnoarchitecture.org/ |date=2013-05-07 }} accessed 5/2/2013</ref> and is contrasted with the more intellectual architecture called polite, formal, or academic architecture just as [[folk art]] is contrasted with [[fine art]].\n<!--Better to keep this concise and include in country specific sections as article is expanded. In Japan, for example, not all pre-modern architecture is \"vernacular,\" which would usually refer only to rural buildings and [[structures]]. In the [[US]], vernacular architecture might refer to a so-called craftsman [[bungalow]], fashionable in the nineteenth century, even though the bungalow as an architectural form did not originate in the US. \"Vernacular\" might even refer to a building like the 1848 Duncan House in [[Cooksville]], [[Wisconsin]]. -->\n\nWilliam,{{sfnp|William|2010|page=241}} after Brunskill, regards the 'Vernacular Zone' as being a range of buildings between two thresholds: the Vernacular and the Polite.{{sfnp|Brunskill|1971|pages=25\u201329}}  These were below the Polite Threshold, but also had to be above the Vernacular Threshold. Buildings cruder than this did not survive, and so were not recorded. This was due to both their unimportance and the lack of attention paid to them, also to the insubstantial nature of their poor materials. A survey in the 1940s by Sir Cyril Fox and Lord Raglan examined 450 'old' cottages in Monmouthshire expected to date them to the medieval period. However careful study dated them to the late eighteenth century or later: 'cottages'{{efn-lr|i.e. the homes of married labourers, rather than servants}} earlier than this had simply not survived.{{sfnp|William|2010|page=241}}{{sfnp|Fox|Raglan|1954|page=210}}\n\n==Vernacular and the architect==\nArchitecture designed by professional architects is usually not considered to be vernacular. Indeed, it can be argued that the very process of consciously designing a building makes it not vernacular. [[Paul Oliver]], in his book ''Dwellings'', states: \"...it is contended that 'popular architecture' designed by professional architects or commercial builders for popular use, does not come within the compass of the vernacular\".<ref name=\"Oliver2003\" >{{cite book\n  |last1=Oliver |first1=Paul |authorlink1=Paul Oliver\n  |title=Dwellings \n  |year=2003 \n  |publisher=Phaidon Press |location=London\n  |isbn=0-7148-4202-8\n  |page=15\n}}</ref>{{rp|15}} Oliver also offers the following simple definition of vernacular architecture: \"the architecture of the people, and by the people, but not for the people.\"<ref name=\"Oliver2003\"/>{{rp|14}}\n\n[[Frank Lloyd Wright]] described vernacular architecture as \"Folk building growing in response to actual needs, fitted into environment by people who knew no better than to fit them with native feeling\".<ref name=\"Oliver2003\"/>{{rp|9}} suggesting that it is a primitive form of design, lacking intelligent thought, but he also stated that it was \"for us better worth study than all the highly self-conscious academic attempts at the beautiful throughout Europe\".\n\n[[File:Velika planina 031.JPG|thumbnail|right|A post-World War II dwelling at the [[Big Pasture Plateau]], [[Slovenia]], designed by the architect [[Vlasto Kopa\u010d]] and based on the vernacular architecture of this mountainous area.]]\n\nSince at least the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], many modern architects have studied vernacular buildings and claimed to draw inspiration from them, including aspects of the vernacular in their designs. In 1946, the [[Egypt]]ian architect [[Hassan Fathy]] was appointed to design the town of [[New Gourna]] near [[Luxor]]. Having studied traditional [[Nubian people|Nubian]] settlements and technologies, he incorporated the traditional mud brick vaults of the Nubian settlements in his designs. The experiment failed, due to a variety of social and economic reasons, but is the first recorded attempt by an architect to address the social and environmental requirements of building users by adopting the methods and forms of the vernacular.<ref name=\"Oliver2003\"/>{{rp|11}}\n\nIn 1964 the exhibition ''Architecture Without Architects'' was put on at the [[Museum of Modern Art, New York]] by [[Bernard Rudofsky]]. Accompanied by a book of the same title, including black-and-white photography of vernacular buildings around the world, the exhibition was extremely popular. It was Rudofsky who first made use of the term vernacular in an architectural context, and brought the concept into the eye of the public and of mainstream architecture: \"For want of a generic label we shall call it vernacular, anonymous, spontaneous, indigenous, rural, as the case may be.\"<ref name=Rudofsky>Rudofsky, ''Architecture Without Architects'', page 58</ref>  However, the range of studies about vernacular architecture since the book's publication suggests that Rudofsky's characterization was limiting and problematic; indeed, quite often vernacular architecture is ''not'' anonymous and designed in very intentional ways that are learned through generations of practice and based upon the availability of particular materials and profoundly affected by climate (and, thus, not \"spontaneous.\")\n\nSince the emergence of the term in the 1970s, vernacular considerations have played an increasing part in architectural designs, although individual architects had widely varying opinions of the merits of the vernacular.\n\nSri Lankan architect [[Geoffrey Bawa]] is considered the pioneer of regional modernism in [[South Asia]]. Along with him, modern proponents of the use of the vernacular in architectural design include [[Charles Correa]], a well known Indian architect; [[Muzharul Islam]] and [[Bashirul Haq]], internationally known [[List of Bangladeshi architects|Bangladeshi architects]]; [[Balkrishna Doshi]], another Indian, who established the Vastu-Shilpa Foundation in [[Ahmedabad]] to research the vernacular architecture of the region; and [[Sheila Sri Prakash]] who has used rural Indian architecture as an inspiration for innovations in environmental and socio-economically sustainable design and planning. The Dutch architect [[Aldo van Eyck]] was also a proponent of vernacular architecture.<ref name=\"Oliver2003\"/>{{rp|13}} Architects whose work exemplifies the modern take on vernacular architecture would be [[Samuel Mockbee]], [[Christopher Alexander]] and [[Paolo Soleri]].\n\nOliver claims that:\n<blockquote>As yet there is no clearly defined and specialized discipline for the study of dwellings or the larger compass of vernacular architecture. If such a discipline were to emerge it would probably be one that combines some of the elements of both architecture and anthropology with aspects of history and geography<ref name=\"Oliver2003\"/>{{clarify|date=September 2013}}</blockquote>\n\nArchitects have developed a renewed interest in vernacular architecture as a model for sustainable design.<ref>Forster, W., Heal, A. and Paradise, C.,  \"The Vernacular as a Model for Sustainable Design\" Chapter 14 in: W. Weber, S. Yannas, ''Lessons from Vernacular Architecture'', Routledge, 2013</ref>\n\n==Influences on the vernacular==\n[[File:Brgule 001.jpg|thumb|House in [[Brgule]], Serbia]]\nVernacular architecture is influenced by a great range of different aspects of human behaviour and environment, leading to differing building forms for almost every different context; even neighbouring villages may have subtly different approaches to the construction and use of their dwellings, even if they at first appear the same. Despite these variations, every building is subject to the same laws of physics, and hence will demonstrate significant similarities in [[structural engineering|structural forms]].\n\n===Climate===\nOne of the most significant influences on vernacular architecture is the macro climate of the area in which the building is constructed. Buildings in cold climates invariably have high thermal mass or significant amounts of insulation. They are usually sealed in order to prevent heat loss, and openings such as windows tend to be small or non-existent. Buildings in warm climates, by contrast, tend to be constructed of lighter materials and to allow significant cross-ventilation through openings in the fabric of the building.\n\n[[File:M\u00fazeum kysuckej dediny-1.jpg|thumb|left|A [[log cabin]] in the region of [[Kysuce]] ([[Slovakia]]) - an example of vernacular architecture in relatively cold mountain climate using local materials ([[wood]]).]]\nBuildings for a continental climate must be able to cope with significant variations in temperature, and may even be altered by their occupants according to the seasons. In hot arid and semi-arid regions, vernacular structures typically include a number of distinctive elements to provide for ventilation and temperature control. Across the middle-east, these elements included such design features as courtyard gardens with water features, screen walls, reflected light, ''[[mashrabiya]]'' (the distinctive [[oriel window]] with timber lattice-work) and ''bad girs'' ([[Windcatcher|wind-catchers]]).<ref name=archinform>{{archINFORM|arch|10796}}</ref> \n[[File:Queenslander home, Australia.jpg|thumb|Queenslander, Australia]]\nBuildings take different forms depending on precipitation levels in the region \u2013 leading to dwellings on stilts in many regions with frequent flooding or rainy monsoon seasons. For example, the [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] is an elevated weatherboard house with a sloped, tin roof that evolved in the early 19th-century as a solution to the annual flooding caused by monsoonal rain in Australia's northern states.<ref name=\"LinOsb\">{{cite web|last1=Osborne|first1=Lindy|title=Sublime design: the Queenslander|url=http://www.architectureanddesign.com.au/features/comment/sublime-design-the-queenslander|website=Architecture & Design|accessdate=24 February 2018}}</ref> Flat roofs are rare in areas with high levels of precipitation. Similarly, areas with high winds will lead to specialised buildings able to cope with them, and buildings tend to present minimal surface area to prevailing winds and are often situated low on the landscape to minimise potential storm damage.\n\nClimatic influences on vernacular architecture are substantial and can be extremely complex. Mediterranean vernacular, and that of much of the Middle East, often includes a courtyard with a fountain or pond; air cooled by water mist and evaporation is drawn through the building by the natural ventilation set up by the building form. Similarly, Northern African vernacular often has very high thermal mass and small windows to keep the occupants cool, and in many cases also includes chimneys, not for fires but to draw air through the internal spaces. Such specializations are not designed, but learned by trial and error over generations of building construction, often existing long before the scientific theories which explain why they work. Vernacular Architecture is also used for the purposes of local citizens.\n\n===Culture===\nThe way of life of building occupants, and the way they use their shelters, is of great influence on building forms. The size of family units, who shares which spaces, how food is prepared and eaten, how people interact and many other cultural considerations will affect the layout and size of dwellings.\n\nFor example, the family units of several East African ethnic communities live in family compounds, surrounded by marked boundaries, in which separate single-roomed dwellings are built to house different members of the family. In polygamous communities there may be separate dwellings for different wives, and more again for sons who are too old to share space with the women of the family. Social interaction within the family is governed by, and privacy is provided by, the separation between the structures in which family members live. By contrast, in Western Europe, such separation is accomplished inside one dwelling, by dividing the building into separate rooms.\n\nCulture also has a great influence on the appearance of vernacular buildings, as occupants often decorate buildings in accordance with local customs and beliefs.\n\n====Nomadic dwellings====\n[[File:cempa stilthouses.jpg|thumb|Stilt houses in Cempa, located in the [[Lingga Islands]] of Indonesia.]]\n[[File:Yurt-construction-2.JPG|thumb|A [[Yurt]] or ger, a circular dwelling from [[Mongolia]], during erection]]\n[[File:igloo.jpg|thumb|An unfinished [[Igloo]], an [[Inuit]] winter dwelling]]\nThere are many cultures around the world which include some aspect of nomadic life, and they have all developed vernacular solutions for the need for shelter. These all include appropriate responses to climate and customs of their inhabitants, including practicalities of simple construction such as [[Hut (dwelling)|huts]], and if necessary, transport such as [[tent]]s.\n\nThe [[Inuit]] people have a number of different forms of shelter appropriate to different seasons and geographical locations, including the [[igloo]] (for winter) and the [[tupiq]] (for summer). The [[Sami people|Sami]] of Northern Europe, who live in climates similar to those experienced by the Inuit, have developed different shelters appropriate to their culture<ref name=\"Oliver2003\"/>{{rp|25}} including the [[lavvu]] and [[goahti]]. The development of different solutions in similar circumstances because of cultural influences is typical of vernacular architecture.\n\nMany nomadic people use materials common in the local environment to construct temporary dwellings, such as the Punan of Sarawak who use palm fronds, or the Ituri Pygmies who use saplings and mongongo leaves to construct domed huts. Other cultures reuse materials, transporting them with them as they move. Examples of this are the tribes of Mongolia, who carry their [[yurt|gers]] (yurts) with them, or the black desert tents of the Qashgai in [[Iran]].<ref name=\"Oliver2003\"/>{{rp|29}} Notable in each case is the significant impact of the availability of materials and the availability of pack animals or other forms of transport on the ultimate form of the shelters.\n\nAll the shelters are adapted to suit the local climate. The Mongolian gers (yurts), for example, are versatile enough to be cool in hot continental summers and warm in the sub-zero temperaturs of Mongolian winters, and include a close-able ventilation hole at the centre and a chimney for a stove. A ger is typically not often relocated, and is therefore sturdy and secure, including wooden front door and several layers of coverings. A traditional [[Berbers|Berber]] tent, by contrast, might be relocated daily, and is much lighter and quicker to erect and dismantle \u2013 and because of the climate it is used in, does not need to provide the same degree of protection from the elements.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Tuareg 1907.jpg|Tuareg tent during Colonial exhibition in 1907.\nImage:Nez-perce-couple-teepee-1900.jpg|A [[tipi]] of the [[Nez Perce tribe]], [[circa]] 1900.\nImage:Algerian_nomads.jpg|Arab Beduin tent from North Africa. Similar tents are also used by Arabs in the Middle East as well as by Persian and Tibetan nomads.\nFile:BerberTentZagora.jpg|A Berber tent near Zagora, Morocco\nFile:F\u00e4bod i Oviksfj\u00e4llen.JPG|In [[transhumance]] (the seasonal movement of people with their livestock to pasture) the herders stay in huts or tents.\nFile:Iraqi mudhif interior.jpg|Interior of a mudhif; a reed dwelling used by Iraqi people of the marshlands\n</gallery>\n\n====Permanent dwellings====\n[[File:Lesotho Slide Show (294).JPG|thumb|A Southern African rondavel (or banda)]]\n\nThe type of structure and materials used for a dwelling vary depending on how permanent it is. Frequently moved nomadic structures will be lightweight and simple, more permanent ones will be less so. When people settle somewhere permanently, the architecture of their dwellings will change to reflect that.\n\nMaterials used will become heavier, more solid and more durable. They may also become more complicated and more expensive, as the capital and labour required to construct them is a one-time cost. Permanent dwellings often offer a greater degree of protection and shelter from the elements. In some cases however, where dwellings are subjected to severe weather conditions such as frequent flooding or high winds, buildings may be deliberately \"designed\" to fail and be replaced, rather than requiring the uneconomical or even impossible structures needed to withstand them. The collapse of a relatively flimsy, lightweight structure is also less likely to cause serious injury than a heavy structure.\n\nOver time, dwellings' architecture may come to reflect a very specific geographical locale.\n\n===Environment, construction elements and materials===\nThe local environment and the construction materials it can provide, govern many aspects of vernacular architecture. Areas rich in trees will develop a wooden vernacular, while areas without much wood may use mud or stone. In early California [[Cupressaceae|redwood]] water towers supporting redwood tanks and enclosed by redwood siding [[Tankhouse|(tankhouses)]] were part of a self-contained wind-powered domestic water system. In the Far East it is common to use bamboo, as it is both plentiful and versatile. Vernacular, almost by definition, is sustainable, and will not exhaust the local resources. If it is not sustainable, it is not suitable for its local context, and cannot be vernacular.\n\nConstruction elements and materials frequently found in vernacular buildings include:\n* [[Adobe]] - a type of mud brick, often covered with white-wash, commonly used in Spain and Spanish colonies\n* [[Windcatcher|Bad girs]] -a type of chimney used to provide natural ventilation, commonly found in Iran, Iraq and other parts of the Middle-East\n* [[Cob (material)|Cob]] - a type of plaster made from subsoil with the addition of fibrous material to give added strength\n* [[Mashrabiya]] - (also known as shanashol in Iraq) - a type of oriel window with timber lattice-work, designed to allow ventilation, commonly found in Iraq and Egypt in upper-class homes\n* [[Mudbrick|Mud brick]]s - loam or sand mixed with water and vegetable matter such as straw\n* [[Rammed earth]] often used in foundations\n* [[Thatching|Thatch]] - dry vegetation used as roofing material\n* [[Wychert]] - a blend of white earth and clay\n\n==Literature==\nFollowing the eclipse by [[International Modernism]] of turn-of-the 20th century vernacular-inspired British and American [[Arts and Crafts]] buildings and European [[National Romanticism]], an early work in the renewed defense of vernacular was [[Bernard Rudofsky]]'s 1964 book ''[[Architecture Without Architects|Architecture Without Architects: a short introduction to non-pedigreed architecture]]'', based on his [[MoMA]] exhibition.  The book was a reminder of the legitimacy and \"hard-won knowledge\" inherent in vernacular buildings, from [[Wieliczka|Polish salt-caves]] to gigantic [[Syria]]n water wheels to [[Morocco|Moroccan]] desert fortresses, and was considered [[iconoclastic]] at the time.  Rudofsky was, however, very much a [[Romanticism|Romantic]] who viewed native populations in a historical bubble of contentment.  Rudofsky's book was also based largely on [[photographs]] and not on on-site study.\n\nA more nuanced work is the ''[[Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World]]'' edited in 1997 by [[Paul Oliver]] of the Oxford Institute for [[Sustainable Development]]. Oliver argues that vernacular architecture, given the insights it gives into issues of environmental adaptation, will be necessary in the future to \"ensure sustainability in both cultural and economic terms beyond the short term.\" [[Christopher Alexander]], in his book ''[[A Pattern Language]]'', attempted to identify adaptive features of traditional architecture that apply across cultures. [[Howard Davis (architect)|Howard Davis]]'s book ''[[The Culture of Building]]'' details the culture that enabled several vernacular traditions.\n\nSome extend the term vernacular to include any architecture outside the [[academic]] mainstream. The term \"commercial vernacular\", popularized in the late 1960s by the publication of [[Robert Venturi]]'s \"Learning from Las Vegas\", refers to 20th-century American [[suburban]] tract and commercial architecture. There is also the concept of an \"industrial vernacular\" with its emphasis on the [[aesthetics]] of [[Workshop|shops]], [[automobile repair shop|garages]] and [[factories]]. Some have linked vernacular with \"off-the-shelf\" aesthetics. In any respect, those who study these types of vernaculars hold that the low-end characteristics of this aesthetic define a useful and fundamental approach to architectural design.\n\nAmong those who study vernacular architecture are those who are interested in the question of everyday life and those lean toward questions of [[sociology]]. In this, many were influenced by ''[[The Practice of Everyday Life]]'' (1984) by [[Michel de Certeau]].\n\n==Humanitarian response==\n[[File:Sutyagin house 1.JPG|thumb|\"[[Sutyagin House]]\", a wooden single-family house \u2013 declared illegal by the city of [[Arkhangelsk]] because of the fire hazard]]\nAn appreciation of vernacular architecture is increasingly seen as vital in the immediate response to [[disasters]] and the following construction of [[transitional shelter]] if it is needed. The work [https://web.archive.org/web/20071008030543/http://www.sheltercentre.org/shelterlibrary/publications/112.htm Transitional Settlement: Displaced Populations], produced by [http://www.sheltercentre.org/ Shelter Centre] covers the use of vernacular in [[humanitarian]] response and argues its importance.\n\nThe value of housing displaced people in shelters which are in some way familiar is seen to provide reassurance and comfort following often very traumatic times. As the needs change from saving lives to providing medium to long term shelter the construction of locally appropriate and accepted housing can be very important.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6202363.stm \"NGOs criticise tsunami shelters\"] ''BBC News'' \u2013 22 December 2006</ref>\n\n==Legal aspects==\nAs many jurisdictions introduce tougher [[building code]]s and [[zoning]] regulations, \"folk architects\" sometimes find themselves in conflict with the local authorities.\n\nA case that made news in Russia was that of an [[Arkhangelsk]] entrepreneur Nikolay P.

It stated that the playing ranks had been severely depleted over the past season as over 600 players had joined the ranks of the military to fight in the first world war. There were 42 teams in total to compete across six grades (7 in the senior grade, 5 in second grade, 9 in third grade, 7 in the fourth grade, 8 in the fifth grade, and 6 in the sixth grade). Fourteen clubs were affiliated to the Auckland Rugby League with over 800 players in total. The Mangere, Remuera, and [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] clubs withdrew from the competition due to so many of their players going to war.\n\nSignificantly they secured the option of the Chinamen's gardens just off Stanley Street and this was to later be turned into [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Rugby League/Past Season Reviewed\n| page =8\n| work = New Zealand Herald |volume=LIV |issue=16526\n| date = 1917-04-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19170430.2.71.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-14}}</ref>\n\nIt was suggested that the newly-formed Garrison Artillery Club enter a first grade team however as there were already 6 teams competing there was a fear that it would weaken the existing teams.

It stated that the playing ranks had been severely depleted over the past season as over 600 players had joined the ranks of the military to fight in the first world war. There were 42 teams in total to compete across six grades (7 in the senior grade, 5 in second grade, 9 in third grade, 7 in the fourth grade, 8 in the fifth grade, and 6 in the sixth grade). Fourteen clubs were affiliated to the Auckland Rugby League with over 800 players in total. The Mangere, Remuera, and [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] clubs withdrew from the competition due to so many of their players going to war.\n\nSignificantly they secured the option of the Chinamen's gardens just off Stanley Street and this was to later be turned into [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Rugby League/Past Season Reviewed\n| page =8\n| work = New Zealand Herald |volume=LIV |issue=16526\n| date = 1917-04-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19170430.2.71.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-14}}</ref>\n\nIt was suggested that the newly-formed Garrison Artillery Club enter a first grade team however as there were already 6 teams competing there was a fear that it would weaken the existing teams.

Eliot's paternal grandfather, [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], had moved to [[St. Louis]], Missouri,<ref name=EB/><ref>Bush, Ronald, ''T. S. Eliot: The Modernist in History'' (New York, 1991), p. 72.</ref> to establish a Unitarian Christian church there. His father, [[Henry Ware Eliot]] (1843\u20131919), was a successful businessman, president and treasurer of the Hydraulic-Press Brick Company in St Louis. His mother, [[Charlotte Champe Stearns]] (1843\u20131929), wrote poetry and was a social worker, a new profession in the early 20th century. Eliot was the last of six surviving children. Known to family and friends as Tom, he was the namesake of his maternal grandfather, Thomas Stearns.\n\nEliot's childhood infatuation with literature can be ascribed to several factors. First, he had to overcome physical limitations as a child. Struggling from a congenital double [[inguinal hernia]], he could not participate in many physical activities and thus was prevented from socialising with his peers. As he was often isolated, his love for literature developed. Once he learned to read, the young boy immediately became obsessed with books, favouring tales of savage life, the Wild West, or [[Mark Twain]]'s thrill-seeking [[Tom Sawyer]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S. Eliot: A Short Biography|year=2009|publisher=Haus Publishing|location=London|page=9}}</ref> In his memoir of Eliot, his friend Robert Sencourt comments that the young Eliot \"would often curl up in the window-seat behind an enormous book, setting the drug of dreams against the pain of living.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Sencourt|first=Robert|title=T.S. Eliot, A Memoir|year=1971|publisher=Garnstone Limited|location=London|page=18}}</ref> Secondly, Eliot credited his hometown with fuelling his literary vision: \"It is self-evident that St. Louis affected me more deeply than any other environment has ever done. I feel that there is something in having passed one's childhood beside the [[Mississippi River|big river]], which is incommunicable to those people who have not. I consider myself fortunate to have been born here, rather than in Boston, or New York, or London.\"<ref>Letter to Marquis Childs quoted in ''St. Louis Post Dispatch'' (15 October 1930) and in the address \"American Literature and the American Language\" delivered at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] (9 June 1953), published in Washington University Studies, ''New Series: Literature and Language'', no. 23 (St. Louis: Washington University Press, 1953), p. 6.</ref>\n\nFrom 1898 to 1905, Eliot attended [[Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School|Smith Academy]], the boys college preparatory division of [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]], where his studies included Latin, Ancient Greek, French, and German. He began to write poetry when he was fourteen under the influence of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]]'s translation of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]].''

He first visited [[Marburg]], Germany, where he planned to take a summer programme, but when the [[First World War]] broke out he went to Oxford instead. At the time so many American students attended Merton that the [[Junior Common Room]] proposed a motion \"that this society abhors the [[Americanization]] of Oxford\". It was defeated by two votes after Eliot reminded the students how much they owed American culture.<ref name=SeymourJones1>Seymour-Jones, Carole.

Oxford is very pretty, but I don't like to be dead.\"<ref name=SeymourJones1/> Escaping Oxford, Eliot spent much of his time in London. This city had a monumental and life-altering effect on Eliot for several reasons, the most significant of which was his introduction to the influential American literary figure [[Ezra Pound]]. A connection through Aiken resulted in an arranged meeting and on 22 September 1914, Eliot paid a visit to Pound's flat. Pound instantly deemed Eliot \"worth watching\" and was crucial to Eliot's beginning career as a poet, as he is credited with promoting Eliot through social events and literary gatherings. Thus, according to biographer John Worthen, during his time in England Eliot \"was seeing as little of Oxford as possible\". He was instead spending long periods of time in London, in the company of Ezra Pound and \"some of the modern artists whom the war has so far spared... It was Pound who helped most, introducing him everywhere.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S.

In a letter addressed to Ezra Pound, she covers an extensive list of her symptoms, which included a habitually high temperature, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[insomnia]], [[migraine]]s, and [[colitis]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Letters of T.S.

The couple formally separated in 1933 and in 1938 Vivienne's brother, Maurice, had her committed to a mental hospital, against her will, where she remained until her death of heart disease in 1947. \n\nTheir relationship became the subject of a 1984 play ''[[Tom & Viv (play)|Tom & Viv]]'', which in 1994 was adapted as a film of [[Tom & Viv|the same name]].\n\nIn a private paper written in his sixties, Eliot confessed: \"I came to persuade myself that I was in love with Vivienne simply because I wanted to burn my boats and commit myself to staying in England. And she persuaded herself (also under the influence of [Ezra] Pound) that she would save the poet by keeping him in England. To her, the marriage brought no happiness. To me, it brought the state of mind out of which came ''The Waste Land''.\"<ref>Eliot, T. S. ''The Letters of T. S. Eliot, Volume 1, 1898\u20131922.''

He was aware of this even early in his career. He wrote to J.H. Woods, one of his former Harvard professors, \"My reputation in London is built upon one small volume of verse, and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in a year. The only thing that matters is that these should be perfect in their kind, so that each should be an event.\"<ref>Eliot, T. S. \"Letter to J. H. Woods, April 21, 1919.\" ''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', vol. I. Valerie Eliot (ed.), New York: Harcourt Brace, 1988, p. 285.</ref>\n\nTypically, Eliot first published his poems individually in periodicals or in small books or pamphlets and then collected them in books. His first collection was ''Prufrock and Other Observations'' (1917). In 1920, he published more poems in ''Ara Vos Prec'' (London) and ''Poems: 1920'' (New York). These had the same poems (in a different order) except that \"Ode\" in the British edition was replaced with \"Hysteria\" in the American edition. In 1925, he collected ''The Waste Land'' and the poems in ''Prufrock'' and ''Poems'' into one volume and added ''The Hollow Men'' to form ''Poems: 1909\u20131925''. From then on, he updated this work as ''Collected Poems''. Exceptions are ''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats'' (1939), a collection of light verse; ''Poems Written in Early Youth'', posthumously published in 1967 and consisting mainly of poems published between 1907 and 1910 in ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]'', and ''Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909\u20131917'', material Eliot never intended to have published, which appeared posthumously in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.com/~raparker/exploring/tseliot/works/poems/eliot-harvard-poems.html |title=T.

That I'm sure of. ... It wouldn't be what it is, and I imagine it wouldn't be so good; putting it as modestly as I can, it wouldn't be what it is if I'd been born in England, and it wouldn't be what it is if I'd stayed in America.

Before the poem's publication as a book in December 1922, Eliot distanced himself from its vision of despair. On 15 November 1922, he wrote to [[Richard Aldington]], saying, \"As for ''The Waste Land'', that is a thing of the past so far as I am concerned and I am now feeling toward a new form and style.\"<ref>''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', Vol.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;596.</ref> The poem is often read as a representation of the disillusionment of the post-war generation. Dismissing this view, Eliot commented in 1931, \"When I wrote a poem called ''The Waste Land'', some of the more approving critics said that I had expressed \u2018the disillusion of a generation\u2019, which is nonsense. I may have expressed for them their own illusion of being disillusioned, but that did not form part of my intention\"<ref>''The Poems of T.S. Eliot, Volume 1: Collected & Uncollected Poems''. Edited by Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue, Faber & Faber, 2015, p. 576</ref>\n\nThe poem is known for its obscure nature\u2014its slippage between satire and prophecy; its abrupt changes of speaker, location, and time. This structural complexity is one of the reasons why the poem has become a touchstone of [[Modernist poetry in English|modern literature]], a poetic counterpart to a novel published in the same year, [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.<ref>MacCabe, Colin. ''T. S. Eliot''. Tavistock: Northcote House, 2006.</ref>\n\nAmong its best-known phrases are \"April is the cruellest month\", \"I will show you fear in a handful of dust\" and ''\"[[Shanti Mantra|Shantih shantih shantih]]\"''. The Sanskrit ''[[mantra]]'' ends the poem.\n\n===''The Hollow Men''===\n{{Main|The Hollow Men|The Hollow Men in popular culture}}\n''The Hollow Men'' appeared in 1925.

Published in 1930, it deals with the struggle that ensues when one who has lacked faith acquires it. Sometimes referred to as Eliot's \"conversion poem\", it is richly but ambiguously allusive, and deals with the aspiration to move from spiritual barrenness to hope for human [[salvation]]. Eliot's style of writing in ''Ash-Wednesday'' showed a marked shift from the poetry he had written prior to his 1927 conversion, and his post-conversion style continued in a similar vein. His style became less ironic, and the poems were no longer populated by multiple characters in dialogue. Eliot's subject matter also became more focused on his spiritual concerns and his Christian faith.<ref>Raine, Craig. ''T. S.

[[Edwin Muir]] maintained that it is one of the most moving poems Eliot wrote, and perhaps the \"most perfect\", though it was not well received by everyone. The poem's groundwork of orthodox Christianity discomfited many of the more secular ''[[Intellectual|literati]]''.<ref name=EB/><ref name=Untermeyer>[[Louis Untermeyer|Untermeyer, Louis]].

This first edition had an illustration of the author on the cover. In 1954, the composer [[Alan Rawsthorne]] set six of the poems for speaker and orchestra in a work titled ''Practical Cats''. After Eliot's death, the book was adapted as the basis of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], first produced in London's West End in 1981 and opening on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/an-introduction-to-old-possums-book-of-practical-cats|title=An introduction to Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats|website=The British Library|access-date=27 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===''Four Quartets''===\n{{Main|Four Quartets}}\nEliot regarded ''Four Quartets'' as his masterpiece, and it is the work that led to his being awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref name=EB/> It consists of four long poems, each first published separately: ''[[Burnt Norton]]'' (1936), ''[[East Coker (poem)|East Coker]]'' (1940), ''[[The Dry Salvages]]'' (1941) and ''[[Little Gidding (poem)|Little Gidding]]'' (1942). Each has five sections. Although they resist easy characterisation, each poem includes meditations on the nature of time in some important respect\u2014[[theological]], historical, physical\u2014and its relation to the human condition. Each poem is associated with one of the four [[classical elements]], respectively: air, earth, water, and fire.\n\n''Burnt Norton'' is a meditative poem that begins with the narrator trying to focus on the present moment while walking through a garden, focusing on images and sounds like the bird, the roses, clouds, and an empty pool. The narrator's meditation leads him/her to reach \"the still point\" in which he doesn't try to get anywhere or to experience place and/or time, instead experiencing \"a grace of sense\". In the final section, the narrator contemplates the arts (\"Words\" and \"music\") as they relate to time. The narrator focuses particularly on the poet's art of manipulating \"Words [which] strain, / Crack and sometimes break, under the burden [of time], under the tension, slip, slide, perish, decay with imprecision, [and] will not stay in place, / Will not stay still.\" By comparison, the narrator concludes that \"Love is itself unmoving, / Only the cause and end of movement, / Timeless, and undesiring.\"\n\n''East Coker'' continues the examination of time and meaning, focusing in a famous passage on the nature of language and poetry. Out of darkness, Eliot offers a solution: \"I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope.\"\n\n''The Dry Salvages'' treats the element of water, via images of river and sea. It strives to contain opposites: \"The past and future / Are conquered, and reconciled.\"\n\n''Little Gidding'' (the element of fire) is the most anthologised of the Quartets. Eliot's experiences as an air raid warden in [[the Blitz]] power the poem, and he imagines meeting [[Dante]] during the German bombing. The beginning of the Quartets (\"Houses / Are removed, destroyed\") had become a violent everyday experience; this creates an animation, where for the first time he talks of Love as the driving force behind all experience. From this background, the Quartets end with an affirmation of [[Julian of Norwich]]: \"All shall be well and / All manner of thing<!-- NOT \"things\" - Collected Poems, p.209 --> shall be well.\"\n\nThe ''Four Quartets'' cannot be understood without reference to Christian thought, traditions, and history. Eliot draws upon the theology, art, symbolism and language of such figures as Dante, and mystics [[St. John of the Cross]] and [[Julian of Norwich]]. The \"deeper communion\" sought in ''East Coker'', the \"hints and whispers of children, the sickness that must grow worse to find healing\", and the exploration which inevitably leads us home all point to the pilgrim's path along the road of [[sanctification]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Plays==\n{{Main|Sweeney Agonistes|Murder in the Cathedral|The Rock (play)|The Family Reunion|The Cocktail Party|The Confidential Clerk|The Elder Statesman}}\nWith the important exception of ''Four Quartets'', Eliot directed much of his creative energies after ''Ash Wednesday'' to writing plays in verse, mostly comedies or plays with redemptive endings. He was long a critic and admirer of [[Elizabethan]] and [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] verse drama; witness his allusions to [[John Webster|Webster]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Thomas Kyd]] in ''The Waste Land''. In a 1933 lecture he said \"Every poet would like, I fancy, to be able to think that he had some direct social utility . . . . He would like to be something of a popular entertainer and be able to think his own thoughts behind a tragic or a comic mask. He would like to convey the pleasures of poetry, not only to a larger audience but to larger groups of people collectively; and the theatre is the best place in which to do it.\"<ref name=\"upuc\">Eliot, T. S. ''The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism'', Harvard University Press, 1933 (penultimate paragraph).</ref>\n\nAfter ''The Waste Land'' (1922), he wrote that he was \"now feeling toward a new form and style\". One project he had in mind was writing a play in verse, using some of the rhythms of early [[jazz]]. The play featured \"Sweeney\", a character who had appeared in a number of his poems. Although Eliot did not finish the play, he did publish two scenes from the piece. These scenes, titled ''Fragment of a Prologue'' (1926) and ''Fragment of an Agon'' (1927), were published together in 1932 as ''[[Sweeney Agonistes]]''. Although Eliot noted that this was not intended to be a one-act play, it is sometimes performed as one.<ref name=Gallup/>\n\nA pageant play by Eliot called ''The Rock'' was performed in 1934 for the benefit of churches in the [[Diocese of London]]. Much of it was a collaborative effort; Eliot accepted credit only for the authorship of one scene and the choruses.<ref name=Gallup/> [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]], the [[Bishop of Chichester]], had been instrumental in connecting Eliot with producer [[E. Martin Browne]] for the production of ''The Rock'', and later commissioned Eliot to write another play for the [[Canterbury Festival]] in 1935. This one, ''Murder in the Cathedral'', concerning the death of the martyr, [[Thomas Becket]], was more under Eliot's control. Eliot biographer [[Peter Ackroyd]] comments that \"for [Eliot], ''Murder in the Cathedral'' and succeeding verse plays offered a double advantage; it allowed him to practice poetry but it also offered a convenient home for his religious sensibility.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/> After this, he worked on more \"commercial\" plays for more general audiences: ''The Family Reunion'' (1939), ''The Cocktail Party'' (1949), ''The Confidential Clerk'', (1953) and ''The Elder Statesman'' (1958) (the latter three were produced by [[Henry Sherek]] and directed by [[E. Martin Browne]]<ref name=\"Darlington\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36063|title=Henry Sherek|last=Darlington|first=W.

The Broadway production in New York of ''The Cocktail Party'' received the 1950 [[Tony Award]] for Best Play. Eliot wrote ''The Cocktail Party'' while he was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].<ref>[https://www.ias.edu/files/pdfs/publications/letter-2007-spring.pdf T. S. Eliot at the Institute for Advanced Study], ''The Institute Letter'', Spring 2007, p. 6.</ref><ref>[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/teliot01 Eliot, Thomas Stearns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119203650/https://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/teliot01 |date=19 January 2015 }} IAS profile.</ref>\n\nRegarding his method of playwriting, Eliot explained, \"If I set out to write a play, I start by an act of choice. I settle upon a particular emotional situation, out of which characters and a plot will emerge. And then lines of poetry may come into being: not from the original impulse but from a secondary stimulation of the unconscious mind.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/>\n\n==Literary criticism==\nEliot also made significant contributions to the field of [[literary criticism]], strongly influencing the school of [[New Criticism]]. He was somewhat self-deprecating and minimising of his work and once said his criticism was merely a \"by-product\" of his \"private poetry-workshop\" But the critic [[William Empson]] once said, \"I do not know for certain how much of my own mind [Eliot] invented, let alone how much of it is a reaction against him or indeed a consequence of misreading him. He is a very penetrating influence, perhaps not unlike the east wind.\"<ref>quoted in Roger Kimball, \"A Craving for Reality\", ''The New Criterion'' Vol. 18, 1999.</ref>\n\nIn his critical essay \"[[Tradition and the Individual Talent]]\", Eliot argues that art must be understood not in a vacuum, but in the context of previous pieces of art. \"In a peculiar sense [an artist or poet] ... must inevitably be judged by the standards of the past.\"<ref name=bartleby1>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw4.html |title=Tradition and the Individual Talent|author= Eliot, T. S. |work=The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1930 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This essay was an important influence over the New Criticism by introducing the idea that the value of a work of art must be viewed in the context of the artist's previous works, a \"simultaneous order\" of works (i.e., \"tradition\"). Eliot himself employed this concept on many of his works, especially on his long-poem ''The Waste Land''.<ref>[http://www.leidykla.vu.lt/fileadmin/Literatura/51_3/98-108.pdf Dirk Weidmann: ''And I Tiresias have foresuffered all...'']. In: ''LITERATURA'' 51 (3), 2009, pp. 98\u2013108.</ref>\n\nAlso important to New Criticism was the idea\u2014as articulated in Eliot's essay \"[[Hamlet and His Problems]]\"\u2014of an \"[[objective correlative]]\", which posits a connection among the words of the text and events, states of mind, and experiences.<ref name=Hamlet>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw9.html |title=Hamlet and His Problems|author= Eliot, T. S. |work= The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1921 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This notion concedes that a poem means what it says, but suggests that there can be a non-subjective judgment based on different readers' different\u2014but perhaps corollary\u2014interpretations of a work.\n\nMore generally, New Critics took a cue from Eliot in regard to his \"'classical' ideals and his religious thought; his attention to the poetry and drama of the early seventeenth century; his deprecation of the Romantics, especially [[Shelley]]; his proposition that good poems constitute 'not a turning loose of emotion but an escape from emotion'; and his insistence that 'poets... at present must be difficult'.\"<ref>Burt, Steven and Lewin, Jennifer. \"Poetry and the New Criticism\". ''A Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry'', Neil Roberts, ed. Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishers, 2001. p. 154</ref>\n\nEliot's essays were a major factor in the revival of interest in the [[metaphysical poets]]. Eliot particularly praised the metaphysical poets' ability to show experience as both psychological and sensual, while at the same time infusing this portrayal with\u2014in Eliot's view\u2014wit and uniqueness. Eliot's essay \"The Metaphysical Poets\", along with giving new significance and attention to metaphysical poetry, introduced his now well-known definition of \"unified sensibility\", which is considered by some to mean the same thing as the term \"metaphysical\".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_modern_literature/v027/27.1baker.html |title=Project MUSE |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |accessdate=3 August 2009|doi=10.1353/jml.2004.0051 }}</ref><ref>A. E. Malloch, \"The Unified Sensibility and Metaphysical Poetry\", ''College English'', Vol. 15, No. 2 (Nov. 1953), pp. 95\u2013101</ref>\n\nHis 1922 poem ''The Waste Land''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html |author=Eliot, T. S. |title=The Waste Land|publisher=Bartleby.com |year= 1922|accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> also can be better understood in light of his work as a critic. He had argued that a poet must write \"programmatic criticism\", that is, a poet should write to advance his own interests rather than to advance \"historical scholarship\". Viewed from Eliot's critical lens, ''The Waste Land'' likely shows his personal despair about [[World War I]] rather than an objective historical understanding of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-2088/TS-Eliot |title=T. S. Eliot :: The Waste Land And Criticism |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date=4 January 1965 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nLate in his career, Eliot focused much of his creative energy on writing for the theatre; some of his earlier critical writing, in essays such as \"Poetry and Drama\",<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/poetryanddrama029231mbp|title=Poetry And Drama|first=T.

Alfred Prufrock\", \"Portrait of a Lady\", \"La Figlia Che Piange\", \"Preludes\", and \"Rhapsody on a Windy Night\" had \"[an] effect [that] was both unique and compelling, and their assurance staggered [Eliot's] contemporaries who were privileged to read them in manuscript. [Conrad] Aiken, for example, marveled at 'how sharp and complete and [[sui generis]] the whole thing was, from the outset. The wholeness is there, from the very beginning.'\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\" />\n\nThe initial critical response to Eliot's ''The Waste Land'' was mixed. Bush notes that the piece was at first correctly perceived as a work of jazz-like syncopation\u2014and, like 1920s [[jazz]], essentially iconoclastic.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/> Some critics, like [[Edmund Wilson]], [[Conrad Aiken]], and [[Gilbert Seldes]] thought it was the best poetry being written in the English language while others thought it was esoteric and wilfully difficult. Edmund Wilson, being one of the critics who praised Eliot, called him \"one of our only authentic poets\".<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\">Wilson, Edmund, \"The Poetry of Drouth\". ''The Dial'' 73. December 1922. 611\u201316.</ref> Wilson also pointed out some of Eliot's weaknesses as a poet. In regard to ''The Waste Land'', Wilson admits its flaws (\"its lack of structural unity\"), but concluded, \"I doubt whether there is a single other poem of equal length by a contemporary American which displays so high and so varied a mastery of English verse.\"<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\"/>\n\nCharles Powell was negative in his criticism of Eliot, calling his poems incomprehensible.<ref>Powell, Charles, \"So Much Waste Paper\". ''Manchester Guardian'', 31 October 1923.</ref> And the writers of ''Time'' magazine were similarly baffled by a challenging poem like ''The Waste Land''.<ref>''Time'', 3 March 1923, 12.</ref> [[John Crowe Ransom]] wrote negative criticisms of Eliot's work but also had positive things to say. For instance, though Ransom negatively criticised ''The Waste Land'' for its \"extreme disconnection\", Ransom was not completely condemnatory of Eliot's work and admitted that Eliot was a talented poet.<ref>Ransom, John Crowe. \"Waste Lands\". ''New York Evening Post Literary Review'', 14 July 1923, pp. 825\u201326.</ref>\n\nAddressing some of the common criticisms directed against ''The Waste Land'' at the time, Gilbert Seldes stated, \"It seems at first sight remarkably disconnected and confused... [however] a closer view of the poem does more than illuminate the difficulties; it reveals the hidden form of the work, [and] indicates how each thing falls into place.\"<ref>Seldes, Gilbert. \"T. S. Eliot\". ''Nation'', 6 December 1922. 614\u2013616.</ref>\n\nEliot's reputation as a poet, as well as his influence in the academy, peaked following the publication of ''The Four Quartets''. In an essay on Eliot published in 1989, the writer [[Cynthia Ozick]] refers to this peak of influence (from the 1940s through the early 1960s) as \"the Age of Eliot\" when Eliot \"seemed pure zenith, a colossus, nothing less than a permanent luminary, fixed in the firmament like the sun and the moon\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Cynthia |last=Ozick| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1989/11/20/t-s-eliot-at-101|title=T.S. ELIOT AT 101|work=The New Yorker|date=20 November 1989|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> But during this post-war period, others, like Ronald Bush, observed that this time also marked the beginning of the decline in Eliot's literary influence: <blockquote>As Eliot's conservative religious and political convictions began to seem less congenial in the postwar world, other readers reacted with suspicion to his assertions of authority, obvious in ''Four Quartets'' and implicit in the earlier poetry. The result, fueled by intermittent rediscovery of Eliot's occasional anti-Semitic rhetoric, has been a progressive downward revision of his once towering reputation.<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/></blockquote> Bush also notes that Eliot's reputation \"slipped\" significantly further after his death. He writes, \"Sometimes regarded as too academic ([[William Carlos Williams]]'s view), Eliot was also frequently criticized for a deadening [[neoclassicism]] (as he himself\u2014perhaps just as unfairly\u2014had criticized [[John Milton|Milton]]). However, the multifarious tributes from practicing poets of many schools published during his centenary in 1988 was a strong indication of the intimidating continued presence of his poetic voice.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/>\n\nAlthough Eliot's poetry is not as influential as it once was, notable literary scholars, like [[Harold Bloom]]<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''The Western Canon: Books and Schools of the Ages''. NY: Riverhead, 1995.</ref> and [[Stephen Greenblatt]],<ref name=Norton>Stephen Greenblatt, et al. (eds), ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Volume 2''. \"T.S. Eliot\". New York, NY: W.W. Norton & Co.: NY, NY, 2000.</ref> still acknowledge that Eliot's poetry is central to the literary English canon. For instance, the editors of ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'' write, \"There is no disagreement on [Eliot's] importance as one of the great renovators of the English poetry dialect, whose influence on a whole generation of poets, critics, and intellectuals generally was enormous. [However] his range as a poet [was] limited, and his interest in the great middle ground of human experience (as distinct from the extremes of saint and sinner) [was] deficient.\" Despite this criticism, these scholars also acknowledge \"[Eliot's] poetic cunning, his fine craftsmanship, his original accent, his historical and representative importance as ''the'' poet of the modern [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]]-[[Metaphysical poets|Metaphysical]] tradition\".<ref name=Norton />\n\n===Anti-Semitism===\nThe depiction of Jews in some of Eliot's poems has led several critics to accuse him of [[anti-Semitism]]. This case has been presented most forcefully in a study by [[Anthony Julius]]: ''T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form'' (1996).<ref>[[John Gross|Gross, John]].

Nevertheless, he concluded, \"Ultimately, as both Raine and, to do him justice, Julius insist, however much Eliot may have been compromised as a person, as we all are in our several ways, his greatness as a poet remains.\"<ref name = \"Dean\"/> In another review of Raine's 2006 book, the literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]] also questioned the validity of Raine's defence of Eliot's character flaws as well as the entire basis for Raine's book, writing, \"Why do critics feel a need to defend the authors they write on, like doting parents deaf to all criticism of their obnoxious children? Eliot's well-earned reputation [as a poet] is established beyond all doubt, and making him out to be as unflawed as the [[Gabriel|Archangel Gabriel]] does him no favours.\"<ref>Eagleton, Terry.

Eliot's paternal grandfather, [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], had moved to [[St. Louis]], Missouri,<ref name=EB/><ref>Bush, Ronald, ''T. S. Eliot: The Modernist in History'' (New York, 1991), p. 72.</ref> to establish a Unitarian Christian church there. His father, [[Henry Ware Eliot]] (1843\u20131919), was a successful businessman, president and treasurer of the Hydraulic-Press Brick Company in St Louis. His mother, [[Charlotte Champe Stearns]] (1843\u20131929), wrote poetry and was a social worker, a new profession in the early 20th century. Eliot was the last of six surviving children. Known to family and friends as Tom, he was the namesake of his maternal grandfather, Thomas Stearns.\n\nEliot's childhood infatuation with literature can be ascribed to several factors. First, he had to overcome physical limitations as a child. Struggling from a congenital double [[inguinal hernia]], he could not participate in many physical activities and thus was prevented from socialising with his peers. As he was often isolated, his love for literature developed. Once he learned to read, the young boy immediately became obsessed with books, favouring tales of savage life, the Wild West, or [[Mark Twain]]'s thrill-seeking [[Tom Sawyer]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S. Eliot: A Short Biography|year=2009|publisher=Haus Publishing|location=London|page=9}}</ref> In his memoir of Eliot, his friend Robert Sencourt comments that the young Eliot \"would often curl up in the window-seat behind an enormous book, setting the drug of dreams against the pain of living.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Sencourt|first=Robert|title=T.S. Eliot, A Memoir|year=1971|publisher=Garnstone Limited|location=London|page=18}}</ref> Secondly, Eliot credited his hometown with fuelling his literary vision: \"It is self-evident that St. Louis affected me more deeply than any other environment has ever done. I feel that there is something in having passed one's childhood beside the [[Mississippi River|big river]], which is incommunicable to those people who have not. I consider myself fortunate to have been born here, rather than in Boston, or New York, or London.\"<ref>Letter to Marquis Childs quoted in ''St. Louis Post Dispatch'' (15 October 1930) and in the address \"American Literature and the American Language\" delivered at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] (9 June 1953), published in Washington University Studies, ''New Series: Literature and Language'', no. 23 (St. Louis: Washington University Press, 1953), p. 6.</ref>\n\nFrom 1898 to 1905, Eliot attended [[Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School|Smith Academy]], the boys college preparatory division of [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]], where his studies included Latin, Ancient Greek, French, and German. He began to write poetry when he was fourteen under the influence of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]]'s translation of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]].''

He first visited [[Marburg]], Germany, where he planned to take a summer programme, but when the [[First World War]] broke out he went to Oxford instead. At the time so many American students attended Merton that the [[Junior Common Room]] proposed a motion \"that this society abhors the [[Americanization]] of Oxford\". It was defeated by two votes after Eliot reminded the students how much they owed American culture.<ref name=SeymourJones1>Seymour-Jones, Carole.

Oxford is very pretty, but I don't like to be dead.\"<ref name=SeymourJones1/> Escaping Oxford, Eliot spent much of his time in London. This city had a monumental and life-altering effect on Eliot for several reasons, the most significant of which was his introduction to the influential American literary figure [[Ezra Pound]]. A connection through Aiken resulted in an arranged meeting and on 22 September 1914, Eliot paid a visit to Pound's flat. Pound instantly deemed Eliot \"worth watching\" and was crucial to Eliot's beginning career as a poet, as he is credited with promoting Eliot through social events and literary gatherings. Thus, according to biographer John Worthen, during his time in England Eliot \"was seeing as little of Oxford as possible\". He was instead spending long periods of time in London, in the company of Ezra Pound and \"some of the modern artists whom the war has so far spared... It was Pound who helped most, introducing him everywhere.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S.

Knopf Publishing Group, 2001, p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe marriage was markedly unhappy, in part because of Vivienne's health problems.

Eliot: Volume 1, 1898\u20131922|year=1988|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London|page=533}}</ref> This, coupled with apparent mental instability, meant that she was often sent away by Eliot and her doctors for extended periods of time in the hope of improving her health, and as time went on, he became increasingly detached from her. The couple formally separated in 1933 and in 1938 Vivienne's brother, Maurice, had her committed to a mental hospital, against her will, where she remained until her death of heart disease in 1947. \n\nTheir relationship became the subject of a 1984 play ''[[Tom & Viv (play)|Tom & Viv]]'', which in 1994 was adapted as a film of [[Tom & Viv|the same name]].\n\nIn a private paper written in his sixties, Eliot confessed: \"I came to persuade myself that I was in love with Vivienne simply because I wanted to burn my boats and commit myself to staying in England. And she persuaded herself (also under the influence of [Ezra] Pound) that she would save the poet by keeping him in England. To her, the marriage brought no happiness.

When Harvard offered him the [[Charles Eliot Norton professorship]] for the 1932\u20131933 academic year, he accepted and left Vivienne in England. Upon his return, he arranged for a formal separation from her, avoiding all but one meeting with her between his leaving for America in 1932 and her death in 1947. Vivienne was committed to the Northumberland House mental hospital, [[Stoke Newington]], in 1938, and remained there until she died.

He was aware of this even early in his career. He wrote to J.H. Woods, one of his former Harvard professors, \"My reputation in London is built upon one small volume of verse, and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in a year. The only thing that matters is that these should be perfect in their kind, so that each should be an event.\"<ref>Eliot, T. S. \"Letter to J. H. Woods, April 21, 1919.\" ''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', vol. I. Valerie Eliot (ed.), New York: Harcourt Brace, 1988, p. 285.</ref>\n\nTypically, Eliot first published his poems individually in periodicals or in small books or pamphlets and then collected them in books. His first collection was ''Prufrock and Other Observations'' (1917). In 1920, he published more poems in ''Ara Vos Prec'' (London) and ''Poems: 1920'' (New York). These had the same poems (in a different order) except that \"Ode\" in the British edition was replaced with \"Hysteria\" in the American edition. In 1925, he collected ''The Waste Land'' and the poems in ''Prufrock'' and ''Poems'' into one volume and added ''The Hollow Men'' to form ''Poems: 1909\u20131925''. From then on, he updated this work as ''Collected Poems''. Exceptions are ''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats'' (1939), a collection of light verse; ''Poems Written in Early Youth'', posthumously published in 1967 and consisting mainly of poems published between 1907 and 1910 in ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]'', and ''Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909\u20131917'', material Eliot never intended to have published, which appeared posthumously in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.com/~raparker/exploring/tseliot/works/poems/eliot-harvard-poems.html |title=T.

That I'm sure of. ... It wouldn't be what it is, and I imagine it wouldn't be so good; putting it as modestly as I can, it wouldn't be what it is if I'd been born in England, and it wouldn't be what it is if I'd stayed in America. It's a combination of things.

He himself wrote in his 1940 essay on W.B. Yeats: \"The kind of poetry that I needed to teach me the use of my own voice did not exist in English at all; it was only to be found in French.\" (\"Yeats\", ''On Poetry and Poets'', 1948).\n\n===''The Love Song of J.

Before the poem's publication as a book in December 1922, Eliot distanced himself from its vision of despair. On 15 November 1922, he wrote to [[Richard Aldington]], saying, \"As for ''The Waste Land'', that is a thing of the past so far as I am concerned and I am now feeling toward a new form and style.\"<ref>''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', Vol.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;596.</ref> The poem is often read as a representation of the disillusionment of the post-war generation. Dismissing this view, Eliot commented in 1931, \"When I wrote a poem called ''The Waste Land'', some of the more approving critics said that I had expressed \u2018the disillusion of a generation\u2019, which is nonsense. I may have expressed for them their own illusion of being disillusioned, but that did not form part of my intention\"<ref>''The Poems of T.S. Eliot, Volume 1: Collected & Uncollected Poems''. Edited by Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue, Faber & Faber, 2015, p. 576</ref>\n\nThe poem is known for its obscure nature\u2014its slippage between satire and prophecy; its abrupt changes of speaker, location, and time. This structural complexity is one of the reasons why the poem has become a touchstone of [[Modernist poetry in English|modern literature]], a poetic counterpart to a novel published in the same year, [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.<ref>MacCabe, Colin. ''T. S. Eliot''. Tavistock: Northcote House, 2006.</ref>\n\nAmong its best-known phrases are \"April is the cruellest month\", \"I will show you fear in a handful of dust\" and ''\"[[Shanti Mantra|Shantih shantih shantih]]\"''. The Sanskrit ''[[mantra]]'' ends the poem.\n\n===''The Hollow Men''===\n{{Main|The Hollow Men|The Hollow Men in popular culture}}\n''The Hollow Men'' appeared in 1925.

Published in 1930, it deals with the struggle that ensues when one who has lacked faith acquires it. Sometimes referred to as Eliot's \"conversion poem\", it is richly but ambiguously allusive, and deals with the aspiration to move from spiritual barrenness to hope for human [[salvation]]. Eliot's style of writing in ''Ash-Wednesday'' showed a marked shift from the poetry he had written prior to his 1927 conversion, and his post-conversion style continued in a similar vein. His style became less ironic, and the poems were no longer populated by multiple characters in dialogue. Eliot's subject matter also became more focused on his spiritual concerns and his Christian faith.<ref>Raine, Craig. ''T. S. Eliot'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006)</ref>\n\nMany critics were particularly enthusiastic about ''Ash-Wednesday''. [[Edwin Muir]] maintained that it is one of the most moving poems Eliot wrote, and perhaps the \"most perfect\", though it was not well received by everyone. The poem's groundwork of orthodox Christianity discomfited many of the more secular ''[[Intellectual|literati]]''.<ref name=EB/><ref name=Untermeyer>[[Louis Untermeyer|Untermeyer, Louis]].

This first edition had an illustration of the author on the cover. In 1954, the composer [[Alan Rawsthorne]] set six of the poems for speaker and orchestra in a work titled ''Practical Cats''. After Eliot's death, the book was adapted as the basis of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], first produced in London's West End in 1981 and opening on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/an-introduction-to-old-possums-book-of-practical-cats|title=An introduction to Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats|website=The British Library|access-date=27 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===''Four Quartets''===\n{{Main|Four Quartets}}\nEliot regarded ''Four Quartets'' as his masterpiece, and it is the work that led to his being awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref name=EB/> It consists of four long poems, each first published separately: ''[[Burnt Norton]]'' (1936), ''[[East Coker (poem)|East Coker]]'' (1940), ''[[The Dry Salvages]]'' (1941) and ''[[Little Gidding (poem)|Little Gidding]]'' (1942). Each has five sections. Although they resist easy characterisation, each poem includes meditations on the nature of time in some important respect\u2014[[theological]], historical, physical\u2014and its relation to the human condition. Each poem is associated with one of the four [[classical elements]], respectively: air, earth, water, and fire.\n\n''Burnt Norton'' is a meditative poem that begins with the narrator trying to focus on the present moment while walking through a garden, focusing on images and sounds like the bird, the roses, clouds, and an empty pool. The narrator's meditation leads him/her to reach \"the still point\" in which he doesn't try to get anywhere or to experience place and/or time, instead experiencing \"a grace of sense\". In the final section, the narrator contemplates the arts (\"Words\" and \"music\") as they relate to time. The narrator focuses particularly on the poet's art of manipulating \"Words [which] strain, / Crack and sometimes break, under the burden [of time], under the tension, slip, slide, perish, decay with imprecision, [and] will not stay in place, / Will not stay still.\" By comparison, the narrator concludes that \"Love is itself unmoving, / Only the cause and end of movement, / Timeless, and undesiring.\"\n\n''East Coker'' continues the examination of time and meaning, focusing in a famous passage on the nature of language and poetry. Out of darkness, Eliot offers a solution: \"I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope.\"\n\n''The Dry Salvages'' treats the element of water, via images of river and sea. It strives to contain opposites: \"The past and future / Are conquered, and reconciled.\"\n\n''Little Gidding'' (the element of fire) is the most anthologised of the Quartets. Eliot's experiences as an air raid warden in [[the Blitz]] power the poem, and he imagines meeting [[Dante]] during the German bombing. The beginning of the Quartets (\"Houses / Are removed, destroyed\") had become a violent everyday experience; this creates an animation, where for the first time he talks of Love as the driving force behind all experience. From this background, the Quartets end with an affirmation of [[Julian of Norwich]]: \"All shall be well and / All manner of thing<!-- NOT \"things\" - Collected Poems, p.209 --> shall be well.\"\n\nThe ''Four Quartets'' cannot be understood without reference to Christian thought, traditions, and history. Eliot draws upon the theology, art, symbolism and language of such figures as Dante, and mystics [[St. John of the Cross]] and [[Julian of Norwich]]. The \"deeper communion\" sought in ''East Coker'', the \"hints and whispers of children, the sickness that must grow worse to find healing\", and the exploration which inevitably leads us home all point to the pilgrim's path along the road of [[sanctification]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Plays==\n{{Main|Sweeney Agonistes|Murder in the Cathedral|The Rock (play)|The Family Reunion|The Cocktail Party|The Confidential Clerk|The Elder Statesman}}\nWith the important exception of ''Four Quartets'', Eliot directed much of his creative energies after ''Ash Wednesday'' to writing plays in verse, mostly comedies or plays with redemptive endings. He was long a critic and admirer of [[Elizabethan]] and [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] verse drama; witness his allusions to [[John Webster|Webster]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Thomas Kyd]] in ''The Waste Land''. In a 1933 lecture he said \"Every poet would like, I fancy, to be able to think that he had some direct social utility . . . . He would like to be something of a popular entertainer and be able to think his own thoughts behind a tragic or a comic mask. He would like to convey the pleasures of poetry, not only to a larger audience but to larger groups of people collectively; and the theatre is the best place in which to do it.\"<ref name=\"upuc\">Eliot, T. S. ''The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism'', Harvard University Press, 1933 (penultimate paragraph).</ref>\n\nAfter ''The Waste Land'' (1922), he wrote that he was \"now feeling toward a new form and style\". One project he had in mind was writing a play in verse, using some of the rhythms of early [[jazz]]. The play featured \"Sweeney\", a character who had appeared in a number of his poems. Although Eliot did not finish the play, he did publish two scenes from the piece. These scenes, titled ''Fragment of a Prologue'' (1926) and ''Fragment of an Agon'' (1927), were published together in 1932 as ''[[Sweeney Agonistes]]''. Although Eliot noted that this was not intended to be a one-act play, it is sometimes performed as one.<ref name=Gallup/>\n\nA pageant play by Eliot called ''The Rock'' was performed in 1934 for the benefit of churches in the [[Diocese of London]]. Much of it was a collaborative effort; Eliot accepted credit only for the authorship of one scene and the choruses.<ref name=Gallup/> [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]], the [[Bishop of Chichester]], had been instrumental in connecting Eliot with producer [[E. Martin Browne]] for the production of ''The Rock'', and later commissioned Eliot to write another play for the [[Canterbury Festival]] in 1935. This one, ''Murder in the Cathedral'', concerning the death of the martyr, [[Thomas Becket]], was more under Eliot's control. Eliot biographer [[Peter Ackroyd]] comments that \"for [Eliot], ''Murder in the Cathedral'' and succeeding verse plays offered a double advantage; it allowed him to practice poetry but it also offered a convenient home for his religious sensibility.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/> After this, he worked on more \"commercial\" plays for more general audiences: ''The Family Reunion'' (1939), ''The Cocktail Party'' (1949), ''The Confidential Clerk'', (1953) and ''The Elder Statesman'' (1958) (the latter three were produced by [[Henry Sherek]] and directed by [[E. Martin Browne]]<ref name=\"Darlington\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36063|title=Henry Sherek|last=Darlington|first=W.

The Broadway production in New York of ''The Cocktail Party'' received the 1950 [[Tony Award]] for Best Play. Eliot wrote ''The Cocktail Party'' while he was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].<ref>[https://www.ias.edu/files/pdfs/publications/letter-2007-spring.pdf T. S. Eliot at the Institute for Advanced Study], ''The Institute Letter'', Spring 2007, p. 6.</ref><ref>[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/teliot01 Eliot, Thomas Stearns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119203650/https://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/teliot01 |date=19 January 2015 }} IAS profile.</ref>\n\nRegarding his method of playwriting, Eliot explained, \"If I set out to write a play, I start by an act of choice. I settle upon a particular emotional situation, out of which characters and a plot will emerge. And then lines of poetry may come into being: not from the original impulse but from a secondary stimulation of the unconscious mind.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/>\n\n==Literary criticism==\nEliot also made significant contributions to the field of [[literary criticism]], strongly influencing the school of [[New Criticism]]. He was somewhat self-deprecating and minimising of his work and once said his criticism was merely a \"by-product\" of his \"private poetry-workshop\" But the critic [[William Empson]] once said, \"I do not know for certain how much of my own mind [Eliot] invented, let alone how much of it is a reaction against him or indeed a consequence of misreading him. He is a very penetrating influence, perhaps not unlike the east wind.\"<ref>quoted in Roger Kimball, \"A Craving for Reality\", ''The New Criterion'' Vol. 18, 1999.</ref>\n\nIn his critical essay \"[[Tradition and the Individual Talent]]\", Eliot argues that art must be understood not in a vacuum, but in the context of previous pieces of art. \"In a peculiar sense [an artist or poet] ... must inevitably be judged by the standards of the past.\"<ref name=bartleby1>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw4.html |title=Tradition and the Individual Talent|author= Eliot, T. S. |work=The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1930 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This essay was an important influence over the New Criticism by introducing the idea that the value of a work of art must be viewed in the context of the artist's previous works, a \"simultaneous order\" of works (i.e., \"tradition\"). Eliot himself employed this concept on many of his works, especially on his long-poem ''The Waste Land''.<ref>[http://www.leidykla.vu.lt/fileadmin/Literatura/51_3/98-108.pdf Dirk Weidmann: ''And I Tiresias have foresuffered all...'']. In: ''LITERATURA'' 51 (3), 2009, pp. 98\u2013108.</ref>\n\nAlso important to New Criticism was the idea\u2014as articulated in Eliot's essay \"[[Hamlet and His Problems]]\"\u2014of an \"[[objective correlative]]\", which posits a connection among the words of the text and events, states of mind, and experiences.<ref name=Hamlet>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw9.html |title=Hamlet and His Problems|author= Eliot, T. S. |work= The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1921 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This notion concedes that a poem means what it says, but suggests that there can be a non-subjective judgment based on different readers' different\u2014but perhaps corollary\u2014interpretations of a work.\n\nMore generally, New Critics took a cue from Eliot in regard to his \"'classical' ideals and his religious thought; his attention to the poetry and drama of the early seventeenth century; his deprecation of the Romantics, especially [[Shelley]]; his proposition that good poems constitute 'not a turning loose of emotion but an escape from emotion'; and his insistence that 'poets... at present must be difficult'.\"<ref>Burt, Steven and Lewin, Jennifer. \"Poetry and the New Criticism\". ''A Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry'', Neil Roberts, ed. Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishers, 2001. p. 154</ref>\n\nEliot's essays were a major factor in the revival of interest in the [[metaphysical poets]]. Eliot particularly praised the metaphysical poets' ability to show experience as both psychological and sensual, while at the same time infusing this portrayal with\u2014in Eliot's view\u2014wit and uniqueness. Eliot's essay \"The Metaphysical Poets\", along with giving new significance and attention to metaphysical poetry, introduced his now well-known definition of \"unified sensibility\", which is considered by some to mean the same thing as the term \"metaphysical\".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_modern_literature/v027/27.1baker.html |title=Project MUSE |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |accessdate=3 August 2009|doi=10.1353/jml.2004.0051 }}</ref><ref>A.

S. |title=The Waste Land|publisher=Bartleby.com |year= 1922|accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> also can be better understood in light of his work as a critic. He had argued that a poet must write \"programmatic criticism\", that is, a poet should write to advance his own interests rather than to advance \"historical scholarship\". Viewed from Eliot's critical lens, ''The Waste Land'' likely shows his personal despair about [[World War I]] rather than an objective historical understanding of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-2088/TS-Eliot |title=T. S. Eliot :: The Waste Land And Criticism |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date=4 January 1965 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nLate in his career, Eliot focused much of his creative energy on writing for the theatre; some of his earlier critical writing, in essays such as \"Poetry and Drama\",<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/poetryanddrama029231mbp|title=Poetry And Drama|first=T.

S. |year= 1921|work= The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism|publisher=bartleby.com|accessdate=26 January 2017}}</ref> focused on the aesthetics of writing drama in verse.\n\n==Critical reception==\n\n===Responses to his poetry===\nThe writer Ronald Bush notes that Eliot's early poems like \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\", \"Portrait of a Lady\", \"La Figlia Che Piange\", \"Preludes\", and \"Rhapsody on a Windy Night\" had \"[an] effect [that] was both unique and compelling, and their assurance staggered [Eliot's] contemporaries who were privileged to read them in manuscript. [Conrad] Aiken, for example, marveled at 'how sharp and complete and [[sui generis]] the whole thing was, from the outset. The wholeness is there, from the very beginning.'\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\" />\n\nThe initial critical response to Eliot's ''The Waste Land'' was mixed. Bush notes that the piece was at first correctly perceived as a work of jazz-like syncopation\u2014and, like 1920s [[jazz]], essentially iconoclastic.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/> Some critics, like [[Edmund Wilson]], [[Conrad Aiken]], and [[Gilbert Seldes]] thought it was the best poetry being written in the English language while others thought it was esoteric and wilfully difficult. Edmund Wilson, being one of the critics who praised Eliot, called him \"one of our only authentic poets\".<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\">Wilson, Edmund, \"The Poetry of Drouth\". ''The Dial'' 73. December 1922. 611\u201316.</ref> Wilson also pointed out some of Eliot's weaknesses as a poet. In regard to ''The Waste Land'', Wilson admits its flaws (\"its lack of structural unity\"), but concluded, \"I doubt whether there is a single other poem of equal length by a contemporary American which displays so high and so varied a mastery of English verse.\"<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\"/>\n\nCharles Powell was negative in his criticism of Eliot, calling his poems incomprehensible.<ref>Powell, Charles, \"So Much Waste Paper\". ''Manchester Guardian'', 31 October 1923.</ref> And the writers of ''Time'' magazine were similarly baffled by a challenging poem like ''The Waste Land''.<ref>''Time'', 3 March 1923, 12.</ref> [[John Crowe Ransom]] wrote negative criticisms of Eliot's work but also had positive things to say. For instance, though Ransom negatively criticised ''The Waste Land'' for its \"extreme disconnection\", Ransom was not completely condemnatory of Eliot's work and admitted that Eliot was a talented poet.<ref>Ransom, John Crowe. \"Waste Lands\". ''New York Evening Post Literary Review'', 14 July 1923, pp. 825\u201326.</ref>\n\nAddressing some of the common criticisms directed against ''The Waste Land'' at the time, Gilbert Seldes stated, \"It seems at first sight remarkably disconnected and confused... [however] a closer view of the poem does more than illuminate the difficulties; it reveals the hidden form of the work, [and] indicates how each thing falls into place.\"<ref>Seldes, Gilbert. \"T. S. Eliot\". ''Nation'', 6 December 1922. 614\u2013616.</ref>\n\nEliot's reputation as a poet, as well as his influence in the academy, peaked following the publication of ''The Four Quartets''. In an essay on Eliot published in 1989, the writer [[Cynthia Ozick]] refers to this peak of influence (from the 1940s through the early 1960s) as \"the Age of Eliot\" when Eliot \"seemed pure zenith, a colossus, nothing less than a permanent luminary, fixed in the firmament like the sun and the moon\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Cynthia |last=Ozick| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1989/11/20/t-s-eliot-at-101|title=T.S. ELIOT AT 101|work=The New Yorker|date=20 November 1989|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> But during this post-war period, others, like Ronald Bush, observed that this time also marked the beginning of the decline in Eliot's literary influence: <blockquote>As Eliot's conservative religious and political convictions began to seem less congenial in the postwar world, other readers reacted with suspicion to his assertions of authority, obvious in ''Four Quartets'' and implicit in the earlier poetry. The result, fueled by intermittent rediscovery of Eliot's occasional anti-Semitic rhetoric, has been a progressive downward revision of his once towering reputation.<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/></blockquote> Bush also notes that Eliot's reputation \"slipped\" significantly further after his death. He writes, \"Sometimes regarded as too academic ([[William Carlos Williams]]'s view), Eliot was also frequently criticized for a deadening [[neoclassicism]] (as he himself\u2014perhaps just as unfairly\u2014had criticized [[John Milton|Milton]]). However, the multifarious tributes from practicing poets of many schools published during his centenary in 1988 was a strong indication of the intimidating continued presence of his poetic voice.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/>\n\nAlthough Eliot's poetry is not as influential as it once was, notable literary scholars, like [[Harold Bloom]]<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''The Western Canon: Books and Schools of the Ages''. NY: Riverhead, 1995.</ref> and [[Stephen Greenblatt]],<ref name=Norton>Stephen Greenblatt, et al. (eds), ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Volume 2''. \"T.S. Eliot\". New York, NY: W.W. Norton & Co.: NY, NY, 2000.</ref> still acknowledge that Eliot's poetry is central to the literary English canon. For instance, the editors of ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'' write, \"There is no disagreement on [Eliot's] importance as one of the great renovators of the English poetry dialect, whose influence on a whole generation of poets, critics, and intellectuals generally was enormous. [However] his range as a poet [was] limited, and his interest in the great middle ground of human experience (as distinct from the extremes of saint and sinner) [was] deficient.\" Despite this criticism, these scholars also acknowledge \"[Eliot's] poetic cunning, his fine craftsmanship, his original accent, his historical and representative importance as ''the'' poet of the modern [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]]-[[Metaphysical poets|Metaphysical]] tradition\".<ref name=Norton />\n\n===Anti-Semitism===\nThe depiction of Jews in some of Eliot's poems has led several critics to accuse him of [[anti-Semitism]]. This case has been presented most forcefully in a study by [[Anthony Julius]]: ''T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form'' (1996).<ref>[[John Gross|Gross, John]].

S. Eliot'' (2001) and ''T. S. Eliot'' (2006), sought to defend Eliot from the charge of anti-Semitism. Reviewing the 2006 book, Paul Dean stated that he was not convinced by Raine's argument. Nevertheless, he concluded, \"Ultimately, as both Raine and, to do him justice, Julius insist, however much Eliot may have been compromised as a person, as we all are in our several ways, his greatness as a poet remains.\"<ref name = \"Dean\"/> In another review of Raine's 2006 book, the literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]] also questioned the validity of Raine's defence of Eliot's character flaws as well as the entire basis for Raine's book, writing, \"Why do critics feel a need to defend the authors they write on, like doting parents deaf to all criticism of their obnoxious children? Eliot's well-earned reputation [as a poet] is established beyond all doubt, and making him out to be as unflawed as the [[Gabriel|Archangel Gabriel]] does him no favours.\"<ref>Eagleton, Terry.

His work, in particular ''[[The Waste Land]]'', ''[[The Hollow Men]]'', and ''[[Ash Wednesday (poem)|Ash Wednesday]]'' strongly influenced the poetry of two of the most significant post-[[World War II|War]] [[Irish language]] poets, [[Se\u00e1n \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in]]{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} and [[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 D\u00edre\u00e1in]]. \u00d3 D\u00edre\u00e1in was influenced by Eliot to 'rubbish' modern life and sex: ''\u00c1r R\u00e9 Dhear\u00f3il'' ('Our Wretched Era') and Part 3 of ''The Waste Land'' both present a bleak and passionless portrait of twentieth-century relationships.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Sewell|first1=Frank|editor1-last=Campbell|editor1-first=Matthew|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/cambridge-companion-contemporary-irish-poetry/oclc/1113796272|title=The Cambridge Companion to Contemporary Irish Poetry|date=2003|chapter=9.
