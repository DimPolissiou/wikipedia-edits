It is toxic to [[animal]]s that use [[hemoglobin]] as an oxygen carrier (both [[invertebrate]] and [[vertebrate]]) when encountered in concentrations above about 35 [[parts-per-million|ppm]], although it is also produced in normal animal metabolism in low quantities, and is thought to have some normal biological functions. In the atmosphere, it is spatially variable and short lived, having a role in the formation of [[ground-level ozone]].\n \nCarbon monoxide consists of one [[carbon]] atom and one [[oxygen]] atom, connected by a [[triple bond]] that consists of a net two pi bonds and one sigma bond. It is the simplest [[oxocarbon]] and is [[isoelectronic]] with other triply-bonded diatomic molecules having ten valence electrons, including the [[cyanide]] anion, the [[nitrosonium]] cation and molecular [[nitrogen]]. In [[coordination complex]]es the carbon monoxide [[ligand]] is called [[metal carbonyl|carbonyl]].\n\n==History==\n[[Aristotle]] (384\u2013322 BC) first recorded that burning coals produced toxic fumes. An ancient method of execution was to shut the criminal in a bathing room with smoldering coals. What was not known was the mechanism of death. Greek physician [[Galen]] (129\u2013199 AD) speculated that there was a change in the composition of the air that caused harm when inhaled.<ref>Penney, David G.

This process produces a certain amount of carboxyhemoglobin in normal persons, even if they do not breathe any carbon monoxide.\n\nFollowing the first report that carbon monoxide is a normal neurotransmitter in 1993,<ref name = verma/><ref name=\"nytimes.com\" /> as well as one of three gases that naturally modulate inflammatory responses in the body (the other two being [[nitric oxide]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]]), carbon monoxide has received a great deal of clinical attention as a biological regulator. In many tissues, all three gases are known to act as [[anti-inflammatories]], [[vasodilators]], and encouragers of [[neovascular]] growth.<ref name=\"Li2009\" /> However, the issues are complex, as neovascular growth is not always beneficial, since it plays a role in tumor growth, and also the damage from ''wet'' [[macular degeneration]], a disease for which smoking (a major source of carbon monoxide in the blood, several times more than natural production) increases the risk from 4 to 6 times.\n\nThere is a theory that, in some nerve cell [[synapse]]s, when [[long-term memories]] are being laid down, the receiving cell makes carbon monoxide, which back-transmits to the transmitting cell, telling it to transmit more readily in future. Some such nerve cells have been shown to contain [[guanylate cyclase]], an [[enzyme]] that is activated by carbon monoxide.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\" />\n\nStudies involving carbon monoxide have been conducted in many laboratories throughout the world for its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. These properties have potential to be used to prevent the development of a series of pathological conditions including ischemia reperfusion injury, transplant rejection, atherosclerosis, severe sepsis, severe malaria, or autoimmunity. Clinical tests involving humans have been performed, however the results have not yet been released.<ref name=\"clinical-trial\">{{Cite news|title=Poison gas may carry a medical benefit|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/10/16/poison_gas_may_carry_a_medical_benefit/?page=full|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=October 16, 2009|accessdate=October 16, 2009 | first=Carolyn Y. | last=Johnson}}</ref>\n\n===Metallurgy===\n\nCarbon monoxide is a strong reductive agent, and whilst not known, it has been used in [[pyrometallurgy]] to reduce [[metal]]s from [[ore]]s since ancient times. Carbon monoxide strips oxygen off metal oxides, reducing them to pure metal in high temperatures, forming [[carbon dioxide]] in the process. Carbon monoxide is not usually supplied as is, in gaseous phase, in the reactor, but rather it is formed in high temperature in presence of oxygen-carrying ore, carboniferous agent such as coke and high temperature. The [[blast furnace]] process is a typical example of a process of reduction of metal from ore with carbon monoxide.\n\n===Lasers===\n\nCarbon monoxide has also been used as a [[active laser medium|lasing medium]] in high-powered infrared [[laser]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ionin | first1 = A. | last2 = Kinyaevskiy | first2 = I. | last3 = Klimachev | first3 = Y. | last4 = Kotkov | first4 = A. | last5 = Kozlov | first5 = A. | title = Novel mode-locked carbon monoxide laser system achieves high accuracy | doi = 10.1117/2.1201112.004016 | journal = SPIE Newsroom | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fdf0ae25a331cd06255b421c5167ac467c885f89 }}</ref>\n\n===Niche uses===\n\nCarbon monoxide has been proposed for use as a fuel on Mars.

It is toxic to [[animal]]s that use [[hemoglobin]] as an oxygen carrier (both [[invertebrate]] and [[vertebrate]]) when encountered in concentrations above about 35 [[parts-per-million|ppm]], although it is also produced in normal animal metabolism in low quantities, and is thought to have some normal biological functions. In the atmosphere, it is spatially variable and short lived, having a role in the formation of [[ground-level ozone]].\n \nCarbon monoxide consists of one [[carbon]] atom and one [[oxygen]] atom, connected by a [[triple bond]] that consists of a net two pi bonds and one sigma bond. It is the simplest [[oxocarbon]] and is [[isoelectronic]] with other triply-bonded diatomic molecules having ten valence electrons, including the [[cyanide]] anion, the [[nitrosonium]] cation and molecular [[nitrogen]]. In [[coordination complex]]es the carbon monoxide [[ligand]] is called [[metal carbonyl|carbonyl]].\n\n==History==\n[[Aristotle]] (384\u2013322 BC) first recorded that burning coals produced toxic fumes. An ancient method of execution was to shut the criminal in a bathing room with smoldering coals. What was not known was the mechanism of death.

This process produces a certain amount of carboxyhemoglobin in normal persons, even if they do not breathe any carbon monoxide.\n\nFollowing the first report that carbon monoxide is a normal neurotransmitter in 1993,<ref name = verma/><ref name=\"nytimes.com\" /> as well as one of three gases that naturally modulate inflammatory responses in the body (the other two being [[nitric oxide]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]]), carbon monoxide has received a great deal of clinical attention as a biological regulator. In many tissues, all three gases are known to act as [[anti-inflammatories]], [[vasodilators]], and encouragers of [[neovascular]] growth.<ref name=\"Li2009\" /> However, the issues are complex, as neovascular growth is not always beneficial, since it plays a role in tumor growth, and also the damage from ''wet'' [[macular degeneration]], a disease for which smoking (a major source of carbon monoxide in the blood, several times more than natural production) increases the risk from 4 to 6 times.\n\nThere is a theory that, in some nerve cell [[synapse]]s, when [[long-term memories]] are being laid down, the receiving cell makes carbon monoxide, which back-transmits to the transmitting cell, telling it to transmit more readily in future. Some such nerve cells have been shown to contain [[guanylate cyclase]], an [[enzyme]] that is activated by carbon monoxide.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\" />\n\nStudies involving carbon monoxide have been conducted in many laboratories throughout the world for its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties.
