He died of \"Saint Vitus Dance\" (today called [[Sydenham's chorea]]). A nearby street in [[Baltimore County]] bears the name of Bonaparte Avenue.\n\nAfter Bonaparte's death, the house was later owned by bootleggers Peter and Michael Kelly. After they left, it was destroyed in a fire caused by faulty wiring on January 20, 1933. The site was replaced by a poured concrete mansion, but a large carriage house, dating back to 1896, is still on the estate.<ref name=BCPL />\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn September 1, 1875, Bonaparte married the former Ellen Channing Day (1852\u20131924), daughter of attorney Thomas Mills Day and Anna Jones Dunn.

While they are recording, the firehouse receives a call about an old woman, Mrs. Izquierdo, who is trapped in her apartment and screaming. \u00c1ngela and Pablo accompany two of the firefighters, \u00c1lex and Manu, to the apartment building, where two police officers are waiting. As they approach, the old woman becomes aggressive and attacks one of the officers, biting his neck. As they carry the injured officer downstairs, they find the building residents gathered in the lobby. The police and military have sealed off the building and trapped them inside.\n\nAs people begin to panic, \u00c1lex, who remained upstairs with the old woman, is thrown over the staircase railings and critically injured. Mrs. Izquierdo then kills a girl, and the remaining officer, Sergio, is forced to shoot her. \u00c1ngela and Pablo begin interviewing the residents. One of the interviewees is a sick little girl named Jennifer. Her mother Mari Carmen claims she has [[tonsillitis]], and says her dog, Max, is at the vet because he is sick as well. A health inspector in a [[hazmat suit]] arrives and attempts to treat the injured until they suddenly become preternaturally aggressive. After the injured are locked in the building's textile warehouse, the health inspector explains that they are infected with a virus similar to [[rabies]], and that the disease was traced back to a dog in the apartment building, and \u00c1ngela realizes it must be Max. When the residents confront Mari Carmen, Jennifer turns, vomits blood at her mother's face and flees upstairs. Sergio handcuffs Mari Carmen to the stairs and proceeds upstairs with Manu and Pablo. They find Jennifer but she bites Sergio, who tells the others to leave him. Manu and Pablo find the remaining residents running upstairs as the infected in the warehouse have broken down the door. Gradually, the rest of the apartment's residents are bitten and infected.\n\n\u00c1ngela, Pablo and Manu, the three survivors, find a key that will allow them to escape from the building via a large drain in the basement that is connected to the sewers. Manu is bitten outside the apartment of the key's location, forcing \u00c1ngela and Pablo to take refuge in the [[Penthouse apartment|penthouse]]. They discover a tape recorder which explains that the penthouse owner, an agent of [[Holy See|the Vatican]], was charged with the task of isolating an enzyme carried by a young [[Portugal|Portuguese]] girl named [[Tristana Medeiros]], whose symptoms suggest a [[demonic possession]]. As the agent attempted to treat Medeiros, the enzyme mutated and became contagious. The agent then sealed Tristana in the house to die of starvation. An infected boy within the attic damages the light on Pablo's camera, requiring Pablo to activate the camera's night vision. A now-ghoulish Tristana emerges and searches the penthouse for food. \u00c1ngela and Pablo try to escape, but Pablo is killed by Tristana and drops the camera. \u00c1ngela then picks it up and looks through the screen. Seeing Tristana eating Pablo, she panics, trips and drops the camera. The camera continues to record as \u00c1ngela is dragged into the darkness screaming.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Manuela Velasco]] as [[\u00c1ngela Vidal]]\n*Pablo Rosso as Pablo\n*Ferr\u00e1n Terraza as Manu\n*David Vert as \u00c1lex\n*Jorge-Yaman Serrano as Sergio\n*Vicente Gil as Older Policemen\n*Carlos Vicente as Guillem Marim\u00f3n\n*Carlos Lasarte as C\u00e9sar\n*Mar\u00eda Lanau as Mari Carmen\n*Claudia Silva as Jennifer\n*Martha Carbonell as Mrs. Izquierdo\n*Akemi Goto as Japanese Woman\n*Chen Min Kao as Chinese Man\n*Mar\u00eda Teresa Ortega as Grandmother\n*Manuel Bronchud as Grandfather\n*[[Javier Botet]] as [[Tristana Medeiros]]\n*Ben Temple as Doctor\n*Ana Velasquez as Colombian Girl\n*Daniel Trinh as Chinese Children\n*Marita Borrego as Operadoras Cuartel Bomberos\n*Jana Prats - Operadoras Cuartel Bomberos (as Ana Prats)\n*V\u00edctor Massagu\u00e9 as Child in Attic\n*Javier Coromina as Voice of Pablo\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nBalaguer\u00f3 and Plaza had previously directed the 2002 documentary ''OT: la pel\u00edcula''.<ref>{{cite web|title=OT: la pel\u00edcula|url=http://www.filmaffinity.com/es/film787489.html|work=Filmaffinity|publisher=Filmaffinity - Movieaffinity|accessdate=22 June 2013|language=Spanish|date=2002\u20132013}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\nThe film premiered in August 2007 at the [[64th Venice International Film Festival]], out of competition, in the opening and closing films sessions.<ref>{{cite news|title=Venice Film Festival - the films|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3674749/Venice-Film-Festival-the-films.html|accessdate=22 June 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=12 July 2007}}</ref> It was also shown in October 2007 at the [[Sitges Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|title=REC by Paco Plaza and Jaume Balaguer\u00f3: encouraging presentation in Sitges|url=http://sitgesfilmfestival.com/eng/noticies/?id=1002765|work=Sitges Film Festival|publisher=Edifici Sitges Reference|accessdate=22 August 2012|author=Sitges Film Festival|date=5 October 2007}}</ref> and the M\u00e1laga International Week of Fantastic Cinema in November 2007, before going on general release in Spain later that month.\n\nThe film was also shown in February 2008 at the [[Glasgow Film Festival]] and the co-directors participated in a corresponding interview in which they revealed their influences during the creation of the cinema work: \"Our main reference was TV; was not other films, or a tradition of previous features.

While they are recording, the firehouse receives a call about an old woman, Mrs. Izquierdo, who is trapped in her apartment and screaming. \u00c1ngela and Pablo accompany two of the firefighters, \u00c1lex and Manu, to the apartment building, where two police officers are waiting. As they approach, the old woman becomes aggressive and attacks one of the officers, biting his neck. As they carry the injured officer downstairs, they find the building residents gathered in the lobby. The police and military have sealed off the building and trapped them inside.\n\nAs people begin to panic, \u00c1lex, who remained upstairs with the old woman, is thrown over the staircase railings and critically injured. Mrs. Izquierdo then kills a girl, and the remaining officer, Sergio, is forced to shoot her. \u00c1ngela and Pablo begin interviewing the residents. One of the interviewees is a sick little girl named Jennifer. Her mother Mari Carmen claims she has [[tonsillitis]], and says her dog, Max, is at the vet because he is sick as well. A health inspector in a [[hazmat suit]] arrives and attempts to treat the injured until they suddenly become preternaturally aggressive. After the injured are locked in the building's textile warehouse, the health inspector explains that they are infected with a virus similar to [[rabies]], and that the disease was traced back to a dog in the apartment building, and \u00c1ngela realizes it must be Max. When the residents confront Mari Carmen, Jennifer turns, vomits blood at her mother's face and flees upstairs. Sergio handcuffs Mari Carmen to the stairs and proceeds upstairs with Manu and Pablo. They find Jennifer but she bites Sergio, who tells the others to leave him. Manu and Pablo find the remaining residents running upstairs as the infected in the warehouse have broken down the door. Gradually, the rest of the apartment's residents are bitten and infected.\n\n\u00c1ngela, Pablo and Manu, the three survivors, find a key that will allow them to escape from the building via a large drain in the basement that is connected to the sewers. Manu is bitten outside the apartment of the key's location, forcing \u00c1ngela and Pablo to take refuge in the [[Penthouse apartment|penthouse]]. They discover a tape recorder which explains that the penthouse owner, an agent of [[Holy See|the Vatican]], was charged with the task of isolating an enzyme carried by a young [[Portugal|Portuguese]] girl named [[Tristana Medeiros]], whose symptoms suggest a [[demonic possession]]. As the agent attempted to treat Medeiros, the enzyme mutated and became contagious. The agent then sealed Tristana in the house to die of starvation. An infected boy within the attic damages the light on Pablo's camera, requiring Pablo to activate the camera's night vision. A now-ghoulish Tristana emerges and searches the penthouse for food. \u00c1ngela and Pablo try to escape, but Pablo is killed by Tristana and drops the camera. \u00c1ngela then picks it up and looks through the screen. Seeing Tristana eating Pablo, she panics, trips and drops the camera. The camera continues to record as \u00c1ngela is dragged into the darkness screaming.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Manuela Velasco]] as [[\u00c1ngela Vidal]]\n*Pablo Rosso as Pablo\n*Ferr\u00e1n Terraza as Manu\n*David Vert as \u00c1lex\n*Jorge-Yaman Serrano as Sergio\n*Vicente Gil as Older Policemen\n*Carlos Vicente as Guillem Marim\u00f3n\n*Carlos Lasarte as C\u00e9sar\n*Mar\u00eda Lanau as Mari Carmen\n*Claudia Silva as Jennifer\n*Martha Carbonell as Mrs. Izquierdo\n*Akemi Goto as Japanese Woman\n*Chen Min Kao as Chinese Man\n*Mar\u00eda Teresa Ortega as Grandmother\n*Manuel Bronchud as Grandfather\n*[[Javier Botet]] as [[Tristana Medeiros]]\n*Ben Temple as Doctor\n*Ana Velasquez as Colombian Girl\n*Daniel Trinh as Chinese Children\n*Marita Borrego as Operadoras Cuartel Bomberos\n*Jana Prats - Operadoras Cuartel Bomberos (as Ana Prats)\n*V\u00edctor Massagu\u00e9 as Child in Attic\n*Javier Coromina as Voice of Pablo\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nBalaguer\u00f3 and Plaza had previously directed the 2002 documentary ''OT: la pel\u00edcula''.<ref>{{cite web|title=OT: la pel\u00edcula|url=http://www.filmaffinity.com/es/film787489.html|work=Filmaffinity|publisher=Filmaffinity - Movieaffinity|accessdate=22 June 2013|language=Spanish|date=2002\u20132013}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\nThe film premiered in August 2007 at the [[64th Venice International Film Festival]], out of competition, in the opening and closing films sessions.<ref>{{cite news|title=Venice Film Festival - the films|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3674749/Venice-Film-Festival-the-films.html|accessdate=22 June 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=12 July 2007}}</ref> It was also shown in October 2007 at the [[Sitges Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|title=REC by Paco Plaza and Jaume Balaguer\u00f3: encouraging presentation in Sitges|url=http://sitgesfilmfestival.com/eng/noticies/?id=1002765|work=Sitges Film Festival|publisher=Edifici Sitges Reference|accessdate=22 August 2012|author=Sitges Film Festival|date=5 October 2007}}</ref> and the M\u00e1laga International Week of Fantastic Cinema in November 2007, before going on general release in Spain later that month.\n\nThe film was also shown in February 2008 at the [[Glasgow Film Festival]] and the co-directors participated in a corresponding interview in which they revealed their influences during the creation of the cinema work: \"Our main reference was TV; was not other films, or a tradition of previous features.
