It was also used to refer to all Ottoman possessions in the Balkans.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:William Faden. European Dominions of the Ottomans or Turkey in Europe. 1795.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Rumelia in 1795]]\n\n''[[R\u00fbm]]'' means \"Roman\" or \"Greek\", and ''Rumelia'' ({{lang-ota|\u0631\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u064a\u0644\u0649}}, ''R\u016bm-\u0117li''; [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Rumeli'') means \"Land of the Romans\" in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. It refers to the lands conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the Balkan peninsula, which formerly belonged to the [[Byzantine Empire]], known by its contemporaries as the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Roman Empire]] (the German historian [[Hieronymus Wolf]] coined the [[neologism]] \"Byzantine Empire\" in 1557, more than a century after the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, in his work ''Corpus Histori\u00e6 Byzantin\u00e6''.)<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9064407/Rumelia Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica \u2013 Rumelia] at Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.com</ref> Although the term ''Byzantine Empire'' is used by modern historians, the empire's citizens and emperors called themselves ''Romans'' and embraced a Roman identity. Various languages in the Balkans have long used the descriptor \"Roman\" to refer to the lands of the former Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire. Indeed, today the term survives in the region as {{lang-bs|Rumelija}}, {{lang-el|\u03a1\u03c9\u03bc\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03b1}}, ''Romyl\u00eda'', or \u03a1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b7, ''Ro\u00fameli''; {{lang-sq|Rumelia}}; [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] and {{lang-sr|\u0420\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0458\u0430}}, ''Rumelija'' and {{lang-bg|\u0420\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043b\u0438\u044f}}, ''Rumeliya''. The old Latin documents in [[Genoa]] use the term ''Romania'', the common name for the Byzantine Empire during the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nOriginally, the [[Seljuks]] used the name \"Land of the [[R\u00fbm]]\" (Romans) to define [[Anatolia]], which the armies of the [[Seljuk Empire]] gradually conquered from the former Eastern Roman Empire after the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071. The Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate was called the [[Sultanate of Rum]] by its contemporaries, meaning the \"Sultanate of the Roman Empire\" or \"Roman Sultanate\", which mostly covered central Anatolia until the [[Battle of K\u00f6se Da\u011f]] in 1243. Afterwards, it was replaced by the [[Anatolian beyliks]], among which the Ottoman Beylik rose to prominence in the 14th and 15th centuries and eventually became the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nHowever, following the [[rise of the Ottoman Empire|expansion of the Ottoman Empire]] into [[Anatolia]] and the [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]] in the second half of the 14th century and after the [[fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]) in 1453 by [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]], the term ''Rumeli'' (\"Land of the Romans\") came to apply exclusively to the Balkan region of the Ottoman Empire. The region remained primarily populated by [[Christians]]; though gradually, the [[Albanians]], [[Bosniaks]]{{Citation needed|reason=Changed frequently. Possible vandalism.|date=April 2020}} and [[Pomaks]], among others, converted to Islam.\n\nIt must be noted that the region greatly contributed to the expansion and administration of the Ottoman Empire.

European Dominions of the Ottomans or Turkey in Europe. 1795.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Rumelia in 1795]]\n\n''[[R\u00fbm]]'' means \"Roman\" or \"Greek\", and ''Rumelia'' ({{lang-ota|\u0631\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u064a\u0644\u0649}}, ''R\u016bm-\u0117li''; [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Rumeli'') means \"Land of the Romans\" in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. It refers to the lands conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the Balkan peninsula, which formerly belonged to the [[Byzantine Empire]], known by its contemporaries as the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Roman Empire]] (the German historian [[Hieronymus Wolf]] coined the [[neologism]] \"Byzantine Empire\" in 1557, more than a century after the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, in his work ''Corpus Histori\u00e6 Byzantin\u00e6''.)<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9064407/Rumelia Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica \u2013 Rumelia] at Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.com</ref> Although the term ''Byzantine Empire'' is used by modern historians, the empire's citizens and emperors called themselves ''Romans'' and embraced a Roman identity. Various languages in the Balkans have long used the descriptor \"Roman\" to refer to the lands of the former Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire. Indeed, today the term survives in the region as {{lang-bs|Rumelija}}, {{lang-el|\u03a1\u03c9\u03bc\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03b1}}, ''Romyl\u00eda'', or \u03a1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b7, ''Ro\u00fameli''; {{lang-sq|Rumelia}}; [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] and {{lang-sr|\u0420\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0458\u0430}}, ''Rumelija'' and {{lang-bg|\u0420\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043b\u0438\u044f}}, ''Rumeliya''. The old Latin documents in [[Genoa]] use the term ''Romania'', the common name for the Byzantine Empire during the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nOriginally, the [[Seljuks]] used the name \"Land of the [[R\u00fbm]]\" (Romans) to define [[Anatolia]], which the armies of the [[Seljuk Empire]] gradually conquered from the former Eastern Roman Empire after the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071. The Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate was called the [[Sultanate of Rum]] by its contemporaries, meaning the \"Sultanate of the Roman Empire\" or \"Roman Sultanate\", which mostly covered central Anatolia until the [[Battle of K\u00f6se Da\u011f]] in 1243. Afterwards, it was replaced by the [[Anatolian beyliks]], among which the Ottoman Beylik rose to prominence in the 14th and 15th centuries and eventually became the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nHowever, following the [[rise of the Ottoman Empire|expansion of the Ottoman Empire]] into [[Anatolia]] and the [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]] in the second half of the 14th century and after the [[fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]) in 1453 by [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]], the term ''Rumeli'' (\"Land of the Romans\") came to apply exclusively to the Balkan region of the Ottoman Empire. The region remained primarily populated by [[Christians]]; though gradually, the [[Albanians]], [[Bosniaks]] and [[Pomaks]], among others, converted to Islam.\n\nIt must be noted that the region greatly contributed to the expansion and administration of the Ottoman Empire.

The station originally consisted of a hut and an adjacent level crossing. A more substantial two-storey building was later constructed.<ref>Twells, H.N. (1997).

A new station was constructed 150 yards further south and separated from the roadway on the bridge by iron palisading. There was a large covered cab-stand, which offered access to the booking hall, 65&nbsp;ft wide, 27&nbsp;ft deep and 35&nbsp;ft high in early English style, partly timbered. The stairs provided access to the island platform on which were built waiting rooms for ladies and gentlemen, and a first-class refreshment and dining room and a third-class refreshment room. A [[WHSmith|WH Smith]] newsagent stall was also located on the platform. The platforms were covered with a glass canopy and extended close to one quarter of a mile in length. The station was designed by the company architect [[John Holloway Sanders]] and erected by Messrs Cox of Leicester. The bridge was constructed under the supervision of the company engineer, Mr. Campion.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The new Midland Railway Station at Burton-on-Trent |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000327/18830430/060/0004 |newspaper=Derby Daily Telegraph |location=British Newspaper Archive |date=30 April 1883 |access-date=6 July 2016 }}</ref> The new station re-opened in 1883.\n\nUntil the 1960s the station also served as the terminus for a number of secondary routes, such as the [[South Staffordshire line]] to {{rws|Lichfield City}}, the [[Leicester\u2013Burton upon Trent line]] to {{rws|Leicester}} via {{stnlnk|Coalville Town}} and to {{rws|Tutbury and Hatton}}.

At road level there is a taxi rank, shop and the entrance to the station, which contains the ticket office. In order to reach the two platforms (Platform One is for Derby, Nottingham, London and the North, Platform Two is for Tamworth, Birmingham and the South), passengers descend a broad staircase. A lift is also available.\n\nOnly a single building now stands at platform level (Burton is an island station, where the tracks run around a single platform), and this building incorporates a waiting room, toilets and a despatcher's office. Timetable information is available from destination boards and real-time customer information screens with automated train announcements. There is a ramp for step-free access between the two platforms.\n\nThe station has the [[PlusBus]] scheme where train and bus tickets can be bought together at a saving.\n\n===Motive power depot===\nAs a centre for [[beer]] [[brewing]], Burton generated a great deal of freight traffic. Burton itself was criss-crossed by the lines of the brewery companies' private lines, with a plethora of [[level crossing]]s. In 1870 a new [[locomotive shed]] was built to the south of the station. This consisted of a [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] built round a {{convert|42|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Railway turntable|turntable]]. In 1892 another roundhouse was added, with a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} turntable. In 1923 these were replaced by {{convert|57|ft|m|adj=on}} and {{convert|55|ft|m|adj=on}} turntables respectively. Originally coded \"2\" by the [[Midland Railway]], it became 17B in 1935.\n\nBy 1948 the depot had 111 locomotives allocated to it. With the arrival of [[diesel locomotive]]s, {{citation needed|date=March 2013}} a reorganisation of motive power districts in the London Midland Region took place in September 1963.<ref name=Walford13>{{cite book |last=Walford |first=John |title=A Detailed History of British Railways Standard Steam Locomotives|volume=Five: The End of an Era |year=2012 |publisher=[[Railway Correspondence and Travel Society|RCTS]] |location=Maidenhead |isbn=978-0-901115-97-3 |page=13 |ref=harv }}</ref> Under this, the former Nottingham (16), Derby (17) and Toton (18) divisions were amalgamated, with Toton as the main shed for the division; this was coded 16A,<ref name=Walford13 /> and Burton-on-Trent became 16F.<ref name=Walford18>{{harvnb|Walford|2012|p=18}}</ref> Steam traction was removed from this depot in September 1966,<ref name=Walford18 /> and it closed in to steam in 1968 but carried on for diesel locomotive fueling and stabling.\n\n==Services==\nThe station lies on the [[Cross Country Route]], between [[Derby railway station|Derby]] and [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham]].\n\nThe station's operator is [[East Midlands Railway]], but no East Midlands Railway trains call there. All services are provided by [[CrossCountry]], with trains between [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff Central]], Birmingham, and [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham]], as well as longer-distance services to destinations such as [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol Temple Meads]], {{rws|Plymouth}}, [[Leeds railway station|Leeds]], [[Newcastle railway station|Newcastle]] and [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh Waverley]].  The Nottingham - Birmingham services call every half hour each way (alternate trains continue to Cardiff), with two-hourly calls by the Edinburgh - Leeds - Plymouth trains.<ref>GB National Rail Timetable May 2018 edition, Tables 51 & 57 (Network Rail)</ref>\n\n==Future==\nIt has been proposed in the past that the line between Burton and [[Leicester railway station|Leicester]], known as the [[Ivanhoe Line]], be reopened for passenger use.<ref>[http://www.leics.gov.uk/ivanhoe_line_stage2.pdf Leicestershire County Council - Ivanhoe Line Stage II Scheme Re-Appraisal]''Leicestershire County Council'' Report April 2009; Retrieved 2014-01-23</ref>  Services had originally been withdrawn in 1964 due to the [[Beeching Axe]], though the line is still open for freight traffic.

At road level there is a taxi rank, shop and the entrance to the station, which contains the ticket office. In order to reach the two platforms (Platform One is for Derby, Nottingham, London and the North, Platform Two is for Tamworth, Birmingham and the South), passengers descend a broad staircase. A lift is also available.\n\nOnly a single building now stands at platform level (Burton is an island station, where the tracks run around a single platform), and this building incorporates a waiting room, toilets and a despatcher's office. Timetable information is available from destination boards and real-time customer information screens with automated train announcements. There is a ramp for step-free access between the two platforms.\n\nThe station has the [[PlusBus]] scheme where train and bus tickets can be bought together at a saving.\n\n===Motive power depot===\nAs a centre for [[beer]] [[brewing]], Burton generated a great deal of freight traffic. Burton itself was criss-crossed by the lines of the brewery companies' private lines, with a plethora of [[level crossing]]s. In 1870 a new [[locomotive shed]] was built to the south of the station. This consisted of a [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] built round a {{convert|42|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Railway turntable|turntable]]. In 1892 another roundhouse was added, with a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} turntable. In 1923 these were replaced by {{convert|57|ft|m|adj=on}} and {{convert|55|ft|m|adj=on}} turntables respectively. Originally coded \"2\" by the [[Midland Railway]], it became 17B in 1935.\n\nBy 1948 the depot had 111 locomotives allocated to it. With the arrival of [[diesel locomotive]]s, {{citation needed|date=March 2013}} a reorganisation of motive power districts in the London Midland Region took place in September 1963.<ref name=Walford13>{{cite book |last=Walford |first=John |title=A Detailed History of British Railways Standard Steam Locomotives|volume=Five: The End of an Era |year=2012 |publisher=[[Railway Correspondence and Travel Society|RCTS]] |location=Maidenhead |isbn=978-0-901115-97-3 |page=13 |ref=harv }}</ref> Under this, the former Nottingham (16), Derby (17) and Toton (18) divisions were amalgamated, with Toton as the main shed for the division; this was coded 16A,<ref name=Walford13 /> and Burton-on-Trent became 16F.<ref name=Walford18>{{harvnb|Walford|2012|p=18}}</ref> Steam traction was removed from this depot in September 1966,<ref name=Walford18 /> and it closed in to steam in 1968 but carried on for diesel locomotive fueling and stabling.\n\n==Services==\nThe station lies on the [[Cross Country Route]], between [[Derby railway station|Derby]] and [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham]].\n\nThe station's operator is [[East Midlands Railway]], but no East Midlands Railway trains call there.

''Bhagavat'', the Lord, in the person of [[Krishna]], [[Vasudeva]], [[Vishnu]] or [[Bhagavan]].{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=123-124}} The term ''bhagavata'' may have denoted a general religious tradition or

the tradition of Narayana-worship.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=121}} The term ''p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101tra'' means \"five nights,\" from ''pa\u00f1ca'', \"five,\"and ''r\u0101tra'', \"nights,\"{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2007|p=321-322}}{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=121}} and may be derived from the \"five night sacrifice\" as described in the ''Satapatha Brahmana'', which narrates how Purusa-Narayana intends to become the highest being by performing a sacrifice which lasts five nights.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=121}}\n\nThe ''Narayaniya'' section of the Mahabharata describes the ideas of the ''P\u0101\u00f1car\u0101tras''.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=121}} Characteristic is the description of the manifestation of the Absolute through a series of manifestations, from the ''vyuha'' manifestations of

Srivaishnavas have remodelled Pancharatra homas like Sudarshana homa, etc. to include Vedic Suktas like Rudram in them, thus giving them a Vedic outlook.\n\nSri Vaishnavism developed in Tamil Nadu in the 10th century.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=135-136}} It incorporated two different traditions, namely the tantric Pancaratra tradition and the puranic Vishnu worship of northern India with their abstract Vedantic theology, and the southern bhakti tradition of the Alvars of Tamil Nadu with their personal devotion.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=135-136}}<ref name=\"Bartley2013p1\"/> The tradition was founded by [[Nathamuni]] (10th century), who along with [[Yamunacharya]], combined the two traditions and gave the tradition legitimacy by drawing on the Alvars.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=136}} Its most influential leader was [[Ramanuja]] (1017-1137), who developed the [[Visistadvaita]] (\"qualified non-dualism\") philosophy.{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=133, 136}} Ramanuja challenged the then dominant [[Advaita Vedanta]] interpretation of the Upanishads and Vedas, by formulating the Vishishtadvaita philosophy foundations for Sri Vaishnavism from Vedanta.<ref name=\"Bartley2013p1\">{{cite book|author=C.

Its philosophical basis is primarily that of the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and [[Bhagavata Purana]].\n\nThe focus of Gaudiya Vaishnavism is the devotional worship (''[[bhakti]]'') of [[Radha]] and [[Krishna]], and their many divine [[incarnations]] as the supreme forms of [[God]], ''[[Svayam Bhagavan]]''. Most popularly, this worship takes the form of singing Radha and Krishna's [[holy]] names, such as \"[[Hari|Hare]]\", \"Krishna\" and \"[[Rama (disambiguation)|Rama]]\", most commonly in the form of the [[Hare Krishna (mantra)]], also known as [[kirtan]]. It sees the many forms of Vishnu or Krishna as expansions or incarnations of the one Supreme God, ''[[adipurusha]]''.\n\nAfter its decline in the 18-19th century, it was revived in the beginning of the 20th century due to the efforts of [[Bhaktivinoda Thakur]]. His son Srila [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura]] founded sixty-four Gaudiya Matha monasteries in India, Burma and Europe.<ref>Edwin Bryant, Maria Ekstrand, The Hare Krishna Movement: The Postcharismatic Fate of a Religious Transplant (2004) - 448 pages\nPage 130</ref> Thakura's disciple [[Srila Prabhupada]] went to the west and spread Gaudiya Vaishnavism by the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON).\n\n====Varkari-tradition and Vithoba-worship====\n{{Main|Vithoba|Varkari}}\n\nThe Varkari-tradition is a non-[[Brahmanism|Brahamanical]]<ref>Zelliot (1988) p. xviii \"Varkari cult is rural and non-Brahman in character\"</ref><ref>Sand (1990) p. 34 \"the more or less anti-ritualistic and anti-brahmanical attitudes of Varkari sampradaya.\"</ref> tradition which worships [[Vithoba]], also known as Vitthal, who is regarded as a form of Vishnu or Krishna. Vithoba is often depicted as a dark young boy, standing arms akimbo on a brick, sometimes accompanied by his main consort [[Rukmini|Rakhumai]]. The Varkari-tradition is geographically associated with the Indian states of [[Maharashtra]] and northern [[Karnataka]].\n\nThe Varkari movement includes a duty-based approach towards life, emphasizing moral behavior and strict avoidance of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[tobacco]], the adoption of a strict [[lacto vegetarianism|lacto-vegetarian]] diet and fasting on ''[[Ekadashi]]'' day (twice a month), self-restraint (''[[brahmacharya]]'') during [[student]] life, equality and humanity for all rejecting discrimination based on the [[caste system in India|caste system]] or wealth, the reading of [[Hindu texts]], the recitation of the ''[[Haripath]]'' every day and the regular practice of ''[[bhajan]]'' and ''[[kirtan]]''. The most important festivals of Vithoba are held on the eleventh (''ekadashi'') day of the lunar months\" [[Shayani Ekadashi]] in the month of [[Ashadha]], and [[Prabodhini Ekadashi]] in the month of [[Kartik (month)|Kartik]].\n\nThe Varkari poet-saints are known for their devotional lyrics, the [[abhang]], dedicated to Vithoba and composed in [[Marathi language|Marathi]]. Other devotional literature includes the Kannada hymns of the Haridasa, and Marathi versions of the generic [[aarti]] songs associated with rituals of offering light to the deity. Notable saints and [[guru]]s of the Varkaris include [[J\u00f1\u0101ne\u015bvar]], [[Namdev]], [[Chokhamela]], [[Eknath]], and [[Tukaram]], all of whom are accorded the title of [[Sant (religion)|Sant]].\n\nThough the origins of both his cult and his main temple are debated, there is clear evidence that they already existed by the 13th century.

''Bhagavat'', the Lord, in the person of [[Krishna]], [[Vasudeva]], [[Vishnu]] or [[Bhagavan]].{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=123-124}} The term ''bhagavata'' may have denoted a general religious tradition or

the tradition of Narayana-worship.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=121}} The term ''p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101tra'' means \"five nights,\" from ''pa\u00f1ca'', \"five,\"and ''r\u0101tra'', \"nights,\"{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2007|p=321-322}}{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=121}} and may be derived from the \"five night sacrifice\" as described in the ''Satapatha Brahmana'', which narrates how Purusa-Narayana intends to become the highest being by performing a sacrifice which lasts five nights.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=121}}\n\nThe ''Narayaniya'' section of the Mahabharata describes the ideas of the ''P\u0101\u00f1car\u0101tras''.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=121}} Characteristic is the description of the manifestation of the Absolute through a series of manifestations, from the ''vyuha'' manifestations of

Srivaishnavas have remodelled Pancharatra homas like Sudarshana homa, etc. to include Vedic Suktas like Rudram in them, thus giving them a Vedic outlook.\n\nSri Vaishnavism developed in Tamil Nadu in the 10th century.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=135-136}} It incorporated two different traditions, namely the tantric Pancaratra tradition and the puranic Vishnu worship of northern India with their abstract Vedantic theology, and the southern bhakti tradition of the Alvars of Tamil Nadu with their personal devotion.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=135-136}}<ref name=\"Bartley2013p1\"/> The tradition was founded by [[Nathamuni]] (10th century), who along with [[Yamunacharya]], combined the two traditions and gave the tradition legitimacy by drawing on the Alvars.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=136}} Its most influential leader was [[Ramanuja]] (1017-1137), who developed the [[Visistadvaita]] (\"qualified non-dualism\") philosophy.{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=133, 136}} Ramanuja challenged the then dominant [[Advaita Vedanta]] interpretation of the Upanishads and Vedas, by formulating the Vishishtadvaita philosophy foundations for Sri Vaishnavism from Vedanta.<ref name=\"Bartley2013p1\">{{cite book|author=C.

Its philosophical basis is primarily that of the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and [[Bhagavata Purana]].\n\nThe focus of Gaudiya Vaishnavism is the devotional worship (''[[bhakti]]'') of [[Radha]] and [[Krishna]], and their many divine [[incarnations]] as the supreme forms of [[God]], ''[[Svayam Bhagavan]]''. Most popularly, this worship takes the form of singing Radha and Krishna's [[holy]] names, such as \"[[Hari|Hare]]\", \"Krishna\" and \"[[Rama (disambiguation)|Rama]]\", most commonly in the form of the [[Hare Krishna (mantra)]], also known as [[kirtan]]. It sees the many forms of Vishnu or Krishna as expansions or incarnations of the one Supreme God, ''[[adipurusha]]''.\n\nAfter its decline in the 18-19th century, it was revived in the beginning of the 20th century due to the efforts of [[Bhaktivinoda Thakur]]. His son Srila [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura]] founded sixty-four Gaudiya Matha monasteries in India, Burma and Europe.<ref>Edwin Bryant, Maria Ekstrand, The Hare Krishna Movement: The Postcharismatic Fate of a Religious Transplant (2004) - 448 pages\nPage 130</ref> Thakura's disciple [[Srila Prabhupada]] went to the west and spread Gaudiya Vaishnavism by the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON).\n\n====Varkari-tradition and Vithoba-worship====\n{{Main|Vithoba|Varkari}}\n\nThe Varkari-tradition is a non-[[Brahmanism|Brahamanical]]<ref>Zelliot (1988) p. xviii \"Varkari cult is rural and non-Brahman in character\"</ref><ref>Sand (1990) p. 34 \"the more or less anti-ritualistic and anti-brahmanical attitudes of Varkari sampradaya.\"</ref> tradition which worships [[Vithoba]], also known as Vitthal, who is regarded as a form of Vishnu or Krishna. Vithoba is often depicted as a dark young boy, standing arms akimbo on a brick, sometimes accompanied by his main consort [[Rukmini|Rakhumai]]. The Varkari-tradition is geographically associated with the Indian states of [[Maharashtra]] and northern [[Karnataka]].\n\nThe Varkari movement includes a duty-based approach towards life, emphasizing moral behavior and strict avoidance of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[tobacco]], the adoption of a strict [[lacto vegetarianism|lacto-vegetarian]] diet and fasting on ''[[Ekadashi]]'' day (twice a month), self-restraint (''[[brahmacharya]]'') during [[student]] life, equality and humanity for all rejecting discrimination based on the [[caste system in India|caste system]] or wealth, the reading of [[Hindu texts]], the recitation of the ''[[Haripath]]'' every day and the regular practice of ''[[bhajan]]'' and ''[[kirtan]]''. The most important festivals of Vithoba are held on the eleventh (''ekadashi'') day of the lunar months\" [[Shayani Ekadashi]] in the month of [[Ashadha]], and [[Prabodhini Ekadashi]] in the month of [[Kartik (month)|Kartik]].\n\nThe Varkari poet-saints are known for their devotional lyrics, the [[abhang]], dedicated to Vithoba and composed in [[Marathi language|Marathi]]. Other devotional literature includes the Kannada hymns of the Haridasa, and Marathi versions of the generic [[aarti]] songs associated with rituals of offering light to the deity. Notable saints and [[guru]]s of the Varkaris include [[J\u00f1\u0101ne\u015bvar]], [[Namdev]], [[Chokhamela]], [[Eknath]], and [[Tukaram]], all of whom are accorded the title of [[Sant (religion)|Sant]].\n\nThough the origins of both his cult and his main temple are debated, there is clear evidence that they already existed by the 13th century.

The BBC channel had closed after a year and a half when the Saudi government attempted to suppress information, including a graphic report on executions and prominent dissident views.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allied-media.com/aljazeera/jazeera_history.html |title=AL JAZEERA TV: The History of the Controversial Middle East News Station Arabic News Satellite Channel History of the Controversial Station |publisher=Allied-media |accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe [[List of emirs of Qatar|Emir of Qatar]], [[Sheikh]] [[Hamad bin Khalifa]], provided a loan of [[Qatari riyal|QAR]] 500 million ([[US$]]137&nbsp;million) to sustain Al Jazeera through its first five years, as Hugh Miles detailed in his book ''Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel That Is Challenging the West''. Shares were held by private investors as well as the [[Qatar]] government.\n\n[[File:Al jazeera arabic.jpg|thumb|Al Jazeera Arabic Building]]\nAl Jazeera's first day on the air was 1 November 1996. It offered 6 hours of programming per day; this increased to 12 hours of programming by the end of 1997. It was broadcast to the immediate neighborhood as a terrestrial signal, and on cable. Al Jazeera is also available through satellites (which was also free to users in the Arab world), although Qatar, and many other Arab countries barred private individuals from having satellite dishes until 2001.\n\nAt the time of the Al Jazeera Media Network launch [[Arabsat]] was the only satellite broadcasting to the Middle East, and for the first year could only offer Al Jazeera a weak [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] transponder that needed a large satellite dish for reception. A more powerful [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] transponder became available as a peace-offering after its user, [[Canal France International]], accidentally beamed 30 minutes of pornography into ultraconservative Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201141941/www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&n=france-seeks-to-soothe-arab-anger-over-porn-film-1997-07-23|title=France seeks to soothe Arab anger over porn film|date=|newspaper=Hurriyet|accessdate=17 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAl Jazeera was not the first such broadcaster in the Middle East; a number had appeared since the Arabsat satellite, a Saudi Arabia-based venture of 21 Arab governments, took orbit in 1985. The unfolding of [[Operation Desert Storm]] on [[CNN International]] underscored the power of live television in current events. While other local broadcasters in the region would assiduously avoid material embarrassing to their home governments (Qatar had its own official TV station as well), Al Jazeera was pitched as an impartial news source and platform for discussing issues relating to the Arab world.\n\nIn presenting \"The opinion and the other opinion\" (the station's motto), it did not take long for Al Jazeera to shock local viewers by presenting Israelis speaking [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] on Arab television for the first time.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Lively and far-ranging talk shows, particularly a popular, confrontational one called ''The Opposite Direction'', were a constant source of controversy regarding issues of morality and religion. This prompted a torrent of criticism from the conservative voices among the region's press. It also led to official complaints and censures from neighboring governments. Some jammed Al Jazeera's terrestrial broadcast or expelled its correspondents. In 1999, the Algerian government reportedly cut power to several major cities in order to censor one broadcast. There were also commercial repercussions: Saudi Arabia reportedly pressured advertisers to avoid the channel, to great effect.\n\nAl Jazeera was the only international news network to have correspondents in Iraq during the [[Operation Desert Fox]] bombing campaign in 1998. In a precursor of a pattern to follow, its exclusive video clips were highly prized by [[Western culture|Western]] media.\n\n===Around the clock===\n1 January 1999 was Al Jazeera's first day of 24-hour broadcasting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/11/2008410115625813175.html |title=A decade of growth |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=1 November 2006 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> Employment had more than tripled in one year to 500 employees. The agency had bureaux at a dozen sites as far away as EU and Russia. Its annual budget was estimated at about $25&nbsp;million at the time.\n\nHowever controversial, Al Jazeera was rapidly becoming one of the most influential news agencies in the whole region. Eager for news beyond the official versions of events, Arabs became dedicated viewers. A 2000 estimate pegged nightly viewership at 35 million, ranking Al Jazeera first in the Arab world, over the Saudi Arabia-sponsored [[Middle East Broadcasting Centre]] (MBC) and London's [[Arab News Network]] (ANN). There were about 70 satellite or terrestrial channels being broadcast to the Middle East, most of them in Arabic. Al Jazeera launched a free Arabic-language web site in January 2001. In addition, the TV feed was soon available in the United Kingdom for the first time via [[British Sky Broadcasting]].\n\n===War in Afghanistan===\nAl Jazeera came to the attention of many in the West during the hunt for [[Osama bin Laden]] and the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan after the [[11 September attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]] on the United States. It aired videos it received from Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, deeming new footage of the world's most wanted fugitives to be newsworthy.

Prior to the arrival of Al Jazeera, many Middle Eastern citizens were unable to watch TV channels other than state-controlled national TV stations. Al Jazeera introduced a level of [[freedom of speech]] on TV that was previously unheard of in many of these countries. Al Jazeera presented controversial views regarding the governments of many Arab states on the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar; it also presented controversial views about Syria's relationship with Lebanon, and the Egyptian judiciary. Critics accused Al Jazeera Media Network of sensationalism in order to increase its audience share. Al Jazeera's broadcasts have sometimes resulted in drastic action: for example, when, on 27 January 1999, critics of the Algerian government appeared on the channel's live program ''El-Itidjah el-Mouakass'' (\"The Opposite Direction\"), the Algerian government cut the electricity supply to large parts of the capital Algiers (and allegedly also to large parts of the country) to prevent the program from being seen.<ref name=\"boot\">{{cite web |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |title=Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel that is Challenging the We |accessdate=25 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115033945/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |archivedate=15 January 2008}} TV programme feat.

However, it was not until late 2001 that Al Jazeera achieved worldwide recognition, when it broadcast video statements by [[al-Qaeda]] leaders.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2460705.stm |title=Al Jazeera and Bin Laden |newspaper=BBC News |date=14 November 2002 |accessdate=12 April 2012 |first=Kathryn |last=Westcott}}</ref>\n\nSome observers have argued that Al Jazeera Media Network has formidable authority as an opinion-maker. Noah Bonsey and Jeb Koogler, for example, writing in the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', argue that the way in which the station covers any future Israeli-Palestinian peace deal could well determine whether or not that deal is actually accepted by the Palestinian public.<ref>[http://www.cjr.org/campaign_desk/does_the_path_to_middle_east_p.php CJR.org], Does the Path to Middle East Peace Stop in Doha?</ref>\n\n<blockquote><p>The channel's tremendous popularity has also, for better or worse, made it a shaper of public opinion. Its coverage often determines what becomes a story and what does not, as well as how Arab viewers think about issues. Whether in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, or Syria, the stories highlighted and the criticisms aired by guests on Al Jazeera's news programs have often significantly affected the course of events in the region.</p>\n\n<p>In Palestine, the station's influence is particularly strong. Recent polling indicates that in the West Bank and Gaza, Al Jazeera is the primary news source for an astounding 53.4 percent of Palestinian viewers. The second and third most watched channels, Palestine TV and Al Arabiya, poll a distant 12.8 percent and 10 percent, respectively. The result of Al Jazeera's market dominance is that it has itself become a mover and shaker in Palestinian politics, helping to craft public perceptions and influence the debate. This has obvious implications for the peace process: how Al Jazeera covers the deliberations and the outcome of any negotiated agreement with Israel will fundamentally shape how it is viewed\u2014and, more importantly, whether it is accepted\u2014by the Palestinian public.</p></blockquote>\n\nAl Jazeera's broad availability in the Arab world \"operat[ing] with less constraint than almost any other Arab outlet, and remain[ing] the most popular channel in the region\", has been perceived as playing a part in the [[Arab Spring]], including the [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisian]] and [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian revolutions]].

The BBC channel had closed after a year and a half when the Saudi government attempted to suppress information, including a graphic report on executions and prominent dissident views.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allied-media.com/aljazeera/jazeera_history.html |title=AL JAZEERA TV: The History of the Controversial Middle East News Station Arabic News Satellite Channel History of the Controversial Station |publisher=Allied-media |accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe [[List of emirs of Qatar|Emir of Qatar]], [[Sheikh]] [[Hamad bin Khalifa]], provided a loan of [[Qatari riyal|QAR]] 500 million ([[US$]]137&nbsp;million) to sustain Al Jazeera through its first five years, as Hugh Miles detailed in his book ''Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel That Is Challenging the West''. Shares were held by private investors as well as the [[Qatar]] government.\n\n[[File:Al jazeera arabic.jpg|thumb|Al Jazeera Arabic Building]]\nAl Jazeera's first day on the air was 1 November 1996. It offered 6 hours of programming per day; this increased to 12 hours of programming by the end of 1997. It was broadcast to the immediate neighborhood as a terrestrial signal, and on cable. Al Jazeera is also available through satellites (which was also free to users in the Arab world), although Qatar, and many other Arab countries barred private individuals from having satellite dishes until 2001.\n\nAt the time of the Al Jazeera Media Network launch [[Arabsat]] was the only satellite broadcasting to the Middle East, and for the first year could only offer Al Jazeera a weak [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] transponder that needed a large satellite dish for reception. A more powerful [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] transponder became available as a peace-offering after its user, [[Canal France International]], accidentally beamed 30 minutes of pornography into ultraconservative Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201141941/www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&n=france-seeks-to-soothe-arab-anger-over-porn-film-1997-07-23|title=France seeks to soothe Arab anger over porn film|date=|newspaper=Hurriyet|accessdate=17 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAl Jazeera was not the first such broadcaster in the Middle East; a number had appeared since the Arabsat satellite, a Saudi Arabia-based venture of 21 Arab governments, took orbit in 1985. The unfolding of [[Operation Desert Storm]] on [[CNN International]] underscored the power of live television in current events. While other local broadcasters in the region would assiduously avoid material embarrassing to their home governments (Qatar had its own official TV station as well), Al Jazeera was pitched as an impartial news source and platform for discussing issues relating to the Arab world.\n\nIn presenting \"The opinion and the other opinion\" (the station's motto), it did not take long for Al Jazeera to shock local viewers by presenting Israelis speaking [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] on Arab television for the first time.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Lively and far-ranging talk shows, particularly a popular, confrontational one called ''The Opposite Direction'', were a constant source of controversy regarding issues of morality and religion. This prompted a torrent of criticism from the conservative voices among the region's press. It also led to official complaints and censures from neighboring governments. Some jammed Al Jazeera's terrestrial broadcast or expelled its correspondents. In 1999, the Algerian government reportedly cut power to several major cities in order to censor one broadcast. There were also commercial repercussions: Saudi Arabia reportedly pressured advertisers to avoid the channel, to great effect.\n\nAl Jazeera was the only international news network to have correspondents in Iraq during the [[Operation Desert Fox]] bombing campaign in 1998. In a precursor of a pattern to follow, its exclusive video clips were highly prized by [[Western culture|Western]] media.\n\n===Around the clock===\n1 January 1999 was Al Jazeera's first day of 24-hour broadcasting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/11/2008410115625813175.html |title=A decade of growth |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=1 November 2006 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> Employment had more than tripled in one year to 500 employees. The agency had bureaux at a dozen sites as far away as EU and Russia. Its annual budget was estimated at about $25&nbsp;million at the time.\n\nHowever controversial, Al Jazeera was rapidly becoming one of the most influential news agencies in the whole region. Eager for news beyond the official versions of events, Arabs became dedicated viewers. A 2000 estimate pegged nightly viewership at 35 million, ranking Al Jazeera first in the Arab world, over the Saudi Arabia-sponsored [[Middle East Broadcasting Centre]] (MBC) and London's [[Arab News Network]] (ANN). There were about 70 satellite or terrestrial channels being broadcast to the Middle East, most of them in Arabic. Al Jazeera launched a free Arabic-language web site in January 2001. In addition, the TV feed was soon available in the United Kingdom for the first time via [[British Sky Broadcasting]].\n\n===War in Afghanistan===\nAl Jazeera came to the attention of many in the West during the hunt for [[Osama bin Laden]] and the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan after the [[11 September attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]] on the United States. It aired videos it received from Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, deeming new footage of the world's most wanted fugitives to be newsworthy. Some criticized the network for giving a voice to terrorists.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joel Campagna |url=http://cpj.org/reports/2001/10/aljazeera-oct01.php |title=Between Two Worlds |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |date=October 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Jennifer Bryson |url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/10/30/202458.shtml |title=Analysis: Is Rumsfeld's Criticism of Al-Jazeera Justified? |publisher=Newsmax |date=30 October 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127185534/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/10/30/202458.shtml |archivedate=27 January 2013}}</ref> Al Jazeera's Washington, D.C., bureau chief, Hafez al-Mirazi, compared the situation to that of the [[Unabomber]]'s messages in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joe Eskenazi |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/20801/al-jazeera-not-all-bin-laden-all-the-time-d-c-bureau-chief-says/ |title=Al-Jazeera not 'all bin Laden, all the time,' D.C. bureau chief says |publisher=Jweekly |date=17 October 2003 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> The network said it had been given the tapes because it had a large Arab audience.<ref>{{cite news |author=Fouad Ajami |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/18/magazine/18ALJAZEERA.html?pagewanted=all |title=What the Muslim World Is Watching |newspaper=The New York Times |date=18 November 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany other TV networks were eager to acquire the same footage.

It also took in fees for sharing its news feed with other networks. It had an estimated 45 million viewers around the world.

Prior to the arrival of Al Jazeera, many Middle Eastern citizens were unable to watch TV channels other than state-controlled national TV stations. Al Jazeera introduced a level of [[freedom of speech]] on TV that was previously unheard of in many of these countries. Al Jazeera presented controversial views regarding the governments of many Arab states on the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar; it also presented controversial views about Syria's relationship with Lebanon, and the Egyptian judiciary. Critics accused Al Jazeera Media Network of sensationalism in order to increase its audience share. Al Jazeera's broadcasts have sometimes resulted in drastic action: for example, when, on 27 January 1999, critics of the Algerian government appeared on the channel's live program ''El-Itidjah el-Mouakass'' (\"The Opposite Direction\"), the Algerian government cut the electricity supply to large parts of the capital Algiers (and allegedly also to large parts of the country) to prevent the program from being seen.<ref name=\"boot\">{{cite web |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |title=Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel that is Challenging the We |accessdate=25 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115033945/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |archivedate=15 January 2008}} TV programme feat.

However, it was not until late 2001 that Al Jazeera achieved worldwide recognition, when it broadcast video statements by [[al-Qaeda]] leaders.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2460705.stm |title=Al Jazeera and Bin Laden |newspaper=BBC News |date=14 November 2002 |accessdate=12 April 2012 |first=Kathryn |last=Westcott}}</ref>\n\nSome observers have argued that Al Jazeera Media Network has formidable authority as an opinion-maker. Noah Bonsey and Jeb Koogler, for example, writing in the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', argue that the way in which the station covers any future Israeli-Palestinian peace deal could well determine whether or not that deal is actually accepted by the Palestinian public.<ref>[http://www.cjr.org/campaign_desk/does_the_path_to_middle_east_p.php CJR.org], Does the Path to Middle East Peace Stop in Doha?</ref>\n\n<blockquote><p>The channel's tremendous popularity has also, for better or worse, made it a shaper of public opinion. Its coverage often determines what becomes a story and what does not, as well as how Arab viewers think about issues. Whether in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, or Syria, the stories highlighted and the criticisms aired by guests on Al Jazeera's news programs have often significantly affected the course of events in the region.</p>\n\n<p>In Palestine, the station's influence is particularly strong. Recent polling indicates that in the West Bank and Gaza, Al Jazeera is the primary news source for an astounding 53.4 percent of Palestinian viewers. The second and third most watched channels, Palestine TV and Al Arabiya, poll a distant 12.8 percent and 10 percent, respectively. The result of Al Jazeera's market dominance is that it has itself become a mover and shaker in Palestinian politics, helping to craft public perceptions and influence the debate. This has obvious implications for the peace process: how Al Jazeera covers the deliberations and the outcome of any negotiated agreement with Israel will fundamentally shape how it is viewed\u2014and, more importantly, whether it is accepted\u2014by the Palestinian public.</p></blockquote>\n\nAl Jazeera's broad availability in the Arab world \"operat[ing] with less constraint than almost any other Arab outlet, and remain[ing] the most popular channel in the region\", has been perceived as playing a part in the [[Arab Spring]], including the [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisian]] and [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian revolutions]].
