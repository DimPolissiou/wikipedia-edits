It was written during his brief acquaintance with the [[Fluxus]] movement.\n\nThe piece requires ten \"performers\", each one responsible for ten of the hundred metronomes. The metronomes are set up on the performance platform, and they are then all wound to their maximum extent and set to different speeds. Once they are all fully wound, there is a silence of two to six minutes, at the discretion of the conductor; then, at the conductor's signal, all of the metronomes are started as simultaneously as possible. The performers then leave the stage. As the metronomes wind down one after another and stop, periodicity becomes noticeable in the sound, and individual metronomes can be more clearly distinguished. The piece typically ends with just one metronome ticking alone for a few beats, followed by silence, and then the performers return to the stage {{harv|Ligeti|1962}}.\n\nThe controversy over the first performance was sufficient to cause [[Television in the Netherlands|Dutch Television]] to cancel a planned broadcast recorded two days earlier at an official reception at [[Hilversum]]'s City Hall on 13 September 1963 ({{harvnb|Ligeti|1997|loc=7, 11}}; {{harvnb|Morrison|2012}}). \"Instead, they showed a soccer game\" {{harv|Ligeti|1997|loc=12}}.

Sincere, Jr. |publisher=The American Civil Defense Association |journal=Journal of Civil Defense |date=October 1984 |page=17}}</ref> However, the onset of [[World War III]] is in the background and not fully elaborated. The story follows a group of American high school students who resist the occupation with [[guerrilla warfare]], naming themselves \"[[Wolverine]]s\", after their high school mascot.\n\n==Plot==\nThe United States has become strategically isolated after [[NATO]] is completely disbanded. At the same time, the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Warsaw Pact]] allies aggressively expand their sphere of influence. In addition, the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian]] wheat harvest fails while a socialist ''[[coup d'etat]]'' occurs in Mexico.\n\nOn a September morning, in the small town of [[Calumet, Colorado|Calumet]], [[Colorado]], a local high school teacher pauses when he sees Soviet paratroopers landing in a nearby field. The paratroopers open fire when the teacher walks outside to question them. Pandemonium follows, as students flee amid heavy gunfire. Jed Eckert, who had dropped his brother Matt off at the high school, ragging him about a recent loss of a football game, returns to the high school and picks up Matt and several of their friends, narrowly escaping all that is going on.  In downtown Calumet, [[Cuban Army|Cuban]] and [[Soviet Army|Soviet troops]] are trying to impose order after a hasty occupation. Cuban Colonel Bella instructs the [[KGB]] to go to a local sporting goods store and obtain the records of the store's gun sales on the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms|ATF]]'s [[Form 4473]], which lists citizens who have purchased firearms.\n\nBrothers Jed and Matt Eckert, along with their friends Robert Morris, Danny, Daryl Bates, and Arturo \"Aardvark\" Mondragon, flee into the wilderness after hastily equipping themselves at the sporting goods store owned by Robert's father. While on the way to the mountains they run into a Soviet roadblock, but are saved by an attacking [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[UH-1]] helicopter gunship. After several weeks in the forest, they sneak back into town, where Jed and Matt learn that their father is being held in a [[re-education]] camp. They visit the site and speak to him through the fence, and learn that their mother is already dead; Mr. Eckert, reminding his sons of how he had purposely raised them in a strenuous manner, orders his sons to avenge his inevitable death and that of his wife.\n\nThe kids visit the Masons and learn that they are behind enemy lines in \"occupied America\". Robert's father is revealed to have been executed because of the missing inventory from his store. The Masons charge Jed and Matt with taking care of their two granddaughters, Toni and Erica. After killing Soviet soldiers in the woods, the youths begin an armed resistance against the occupation forces, calling themselves \"Wolverines\" after their high school mascot. The occupation forces initially try reprisal tactics, executing groups of civilians following every Wolverine attack. During one of these mass executions, the fathers of Jed, Matt, and Aardvark are killed. Daryl's father, Mayor Bates, tries to soften the blow against Calumet and save the lives of the captured citizens by appeasing the occupation authorities, effectively becoming a collaborator, but with little success. Despite the reprisal tactics, the occupation forces get nowhere.\n\nThe Wolverines find a downed American fighter pilot, Lt. Col. Andrew Tanner ([[Powers Boothe]]), who informs them of the current state of the war: several American cities, including Washington, D.C., were destroyed by nuclear strikes; the [[Strategic Air Command]] was crippled by Cuban saboteurs, and paratroopers were dropped from fake commercial airliners to seize key positions in preparation for subsequent assaults via Mexico and [[Alaska]]. Most of the Southern United States and North Western Canada has been taken over by the Soviets, but American counterattacks have halted Soviet advances along the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Mississippi River]] and the lines have stabilized. The only remaining U.S. allies, the United Kingdom and the [[People's Republic of China]], are militarily crippled. Concerned about [[nuclear fallout]], both sides refrain from the further use of nuclear weapons.\n\nTanner assists the Wolverines in organizing raids against the Soviets. Their actions draw the attention of a Soviet General, who orders reprisals against the civilian population. The Wolverines' actions, and the reprisals against civilians eventually leads to the high command of both sides of war to know the name \"Wolverines\", and the Soviet generals publicly stating that the area \"may not be pacified for much longer\". Soon after, in a visit to the front line, Tanner and Aardvark are killed in the crossfire of a tank battle. Daryl is caught by the Soviets after being turned in by his collaborating father. Using threats of torture, KGB officers force Daryl to swallow a [[tracking device]], then release him to rejoin the guerrillas. A ''[[Spetsnaz]]'' unit is sent into the mountains carrying portable [[radio triangulation]] equipment, but are ambushed by the Wolverines. The group traces the source of the radio triangulation signal to Daryl, who confesses and pleads for mercy. He is executed, along with a Spetsnaz operative by an increasingly hardened Robert when the others cannot find the heart to kill their friend. \n\nThe remaining [[Wolverine]]s are ambushed by [[Mi-24]] helicopter gunships, and Toni and Robert are killed, Robert while successfully but suicidally attacking a gunship. Jed and Matt go to attack the Soviet headquarters in Calumet, to distract the troops while Danny and Erica escape. The plan works, but both Jed and Matt are mortally wounded. Colonel Bella comes across the brothers, but sensing the already too-great loss of the war, the colonel is unable to bring himself to kill them, and so he motions them on. The brothers reach a bench in the park where they spent time as kids, holding each other as they die. Meanwhile, Danny and Erica trek through the Rocky Mountain Wilderness where they reach the frontier of Free America.\n\nIn the closing scene, a plaque is seen with Partisan Rock in the background. The rock is fenced off and an American flag flies nearby. The plaque reads:\n\n{{quote|... In the early days of World War III, guerrillas \u2013 mostly children \u2013 placed the names of their lost upon this rock. They fought here alone and gave up their lives, so \"that this nation shall not perish from the earth.\"}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Patrick Swayze]] as Jed Eckert\n* [[C.

It was set in the near future as a combined force of Russians and Cubans launched an invasion of the Southwestern US. Ten children take to the hills when their small town is captured and they turn into a skilled and lethal guerrilla band.<ref>Bart p 109\u2013110</ref>\n\nProducer [[Barry Beckerman]] read the script, and, in the words of Peter Bart, \"thought it had the potential to become a tough, taut, \"art\" picture  made on a modest budget that could possibly break out to find a wider audience.\"<ref name=\"Bart p 110\">Bart p 110</ref> He got his father Sidney Beckerman to help him pay a $5,000 option. Reynolds wanted to direct but the Beckermans wanted someone more established. [[Walter Hill]] briefly considered the script before turning it down. So too did other directors.<ref name=\"Bart p 110\"/>\n\nThe Beckermans pitched the project to [[David Begelman]] when he was at MGM and were turned down. They tried again at that studio when it was being run by [[Frank Yablans]]. Senior vice-president for production [[Peter Bart]], who remembers it as a \"sharply written anti-war movie ... a sort of ''[[Lord of the Flies]]''\",<ref name=\"bart\">{{cite news|title=First Look: Famous Firings a Tough Ax to Follow|last=Bart|first= Peter|newspaper=Variety|date=September 28, 2009|page=2}}</ref>  took the project to the head of the studio, [[Frank Yablans]].\n\nThe script's chances of being filmed increased when Kevin Reynolds became mentored by [[Steven Spielberg]] who helped him make ''[[Fandango (1985 film)|Fandango]]''.<ref name=\"Bart p 110\"/> MGM bought the script.\n\n===John Milius===\nBart recalls that things changed when \"the chieftains at MGM got a better idea. Instead of making a poignant little antiwar movie, why not make a teen ''Rambo'' and turn the project over to John Milius, a genial and rotund filmmaker who loved war movies and also loved war? The idea was especially popular with a member of the MGM board of directors, [[Alexander Haig|General Alexander Haig]], the former Nixon chief of staff, who yearned to supervise the film personally and develop a movie career.\"<ref name=\"bart\"/>\n\nBart says most of MGM's executives, except for Yablans, were opposed to Milius directing. Bart claims he made a last minute attempt to get Reynolds to direct the film and went to see Spielberg. However, by this stage ''Fandango'' was in rough cut, and Bart sensed that Spielberg was disappointed in the film and would not speak up for Reynolds.<ref>Bart p 111</ref>\n\nMilius was signed to direct at a fee of $1.25 million, plus a gun of his choice.<ref>Bart p 112</ref>\n\nMilius set about rewriting the script. He and Haig devised a backstory in which the circumstances of the invasion would take place; this was reportedly based on Hitler's proposed plans to invade the USA.<ref>Bart p 112\u2013113</ref> Haig took Milius under his wing, bringing him to the [[Hudson Institute]], the conservative think tank founded by [[Herman Kahn]], to develop a plausible scenario. Milius saw the story as a Third World liberation struggle in reverse; Haig introduced Nicaragua and suggested that, with the collapse of NATO, a left-wing Mexican regime would participate in the Soviet invasion, effectively splitting the U.S. in half.<ref>{{cite news | last=Hoberman | first=J. | title=The North Koreans Are Coming! | newspaper=Film Comment | edition=48.6 | date=November 2012 | pages=52\u201354, 56}}</ref> Bart says, \"Even Milius was taken aback by Haig's approach to the project. 'This is going to end up as a jingoistic, flag-waving movie,' Milius fretted. As a result, the budget of this once $6&nbsp;million movie almost tripled.\"<ref name=\"bart\"/>\n\nOther changes included a shift in focus from conflict within the group to conflict between the teens and their oppressors, and the acceleration of the ages of some of the characters from early teens to high school age and beyond.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shaw |first=Tony |date=2007 |title=Hollywood's Cold War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QzIkDQAAQBAJ |location= |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=270 |isbn=9780748630738}}</ref> There was also the addition of a sequence where some children visit a camp to find their parents have been brainwashed.<ref>Bart p 113</ref>\n\nMilius later said, \"I see this as an anti-war movie in the sense that if both sides could see this, maybe it wouldn't have to happen. I think it would be good for Americans to see what a war would be like. The film isn't even that violent \u2013 the war shows none of the horrors that could happen in World War III. In fact, everything that happened in the movie happened in World War Two.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nBart says Yablans pushed through filming faster than Milius wanted because MGM needed a movie over the summer. Milius wanted more time to plan, including devising futuristic weaponry and to not shoot over winter, but had to accede.<ref>Bart p 114</ref>\n\nThe Pentagon withdrew its cooperation from the film.<ref>Bart p 133</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nMilius wanted [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] to play the US pilot but Frank Yablans overruled him. Powers Boothe was selected instead.<ref>Bart p 135</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe movie was filmed in and around the city of [[Las Vegas, New Mexico]]. Many of the buildings and structures which appear in the film, including a historic [[Fred Harvey Company]] hotel adjacent to the train depot, the train yard, and a building near downtown, which was repainted with the name of \"Calumet, Colorado\", are still there today. An old [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]] grocery store was converted to a sound stage and used for several scenes in the movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fast-rewind.com/locations_reddawn.htm |title=Red Dawn Movie Filming Locations |work=The 80s Movies Rewind |publisher=Fast-rewind.com |accessdate=August 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBefore starting work on the movie, the cast underwent an intensive eight-week military training course. During that time, production crews designed and built special combat vehicles in [[Newhall, California]]. ''[[Soldier of Fortune (magazine)|Soldier of Fortune]]'' reported that the movie's [[T-72]] tank was such a precise replica that \"while it was being carted around Los Angeles, two [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[intelligence officer]]s followed it to the studio and wanted to know where it had come from\".\n\nPowers Boothe later claimed, \"Milius cut out the emotional life of its characters. Originally, my character was anti-war, as well as a rightist. I was supposed to be the voice of reason in that movie. But certain cuts negated my character.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=ACTOR FINDS SUCCESS IN THE WILDS|last=Baltake|first=Joe|newspaper= Philadelphia Daily News|date=July 18, 1985|page= 51}}</ref>\n\nLea Thompson says the original cut featured a love scene between her and Powers Boothe but it \"was cut out after some previews because of the age difference.

Sincere, Jr. |publisher=The American Civil Defense Association |journal=Journal of Civil Defense |date=October 1984 |page=17}}</ref> However, the onset of [[World War III]] is in the background and not fully elaborated. The story follows a group of American high school students who resist the occupation with [[guerrilla warfare]], naming themselves \"[[Wolverine]]s\", after their high school mascot.\n\n==Plot==\nThe United States has become strategically isolated after [[NATO]] is completely disbanded. At the same time, the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Warsaw Pact]] allies aggressively expand their sphere of influence. In addition, the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian]] wheat harvest fails while a socialist ''[[coup d'etat]]'' occurs in Mexico.\n\nOn a September morning, in the small town of [[Calumet, Colorado|Calumet]], [[Colorado]], a local high school teacher pauses when he sees Soviet paratroopers landing in a nearby field. The paratroopers open fire when the teacher walks outside to question them. Pandemonium follows, as students flee amid heavy gunfire. Jed Eckert, who had dropped his brother Matt off at the high school, ragging him about a recent loss of a football game, returns to the high school and picks up Matt and several of their friends, narrowly escaping all that is going on.  In downtown Calumet, [[Cuban Army|Cuban]] and [[Soviet Army|Soviet troops]] are trying to impose order after a hasty occupation. Cuban Colonel Bella instructs the [[KGB]] to go to a local sporting goods store and obtain the records of the store's gun sales on the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms|ATF]]'s [[Form 4473]], which lists citizens who have purchased firearms.\n\nBrothers Jed and Matt Eckert, along with their friends Robert Morris, Danny, Daryl Bates, and Arturo \"Aardvark\" Mondragon, flee into the wilderness after hastily equipping themselves at the sporting goods store owned by Robert's father. While on the way to the mountains they run into a Soviet roadblock, but are saved by an attacking [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[UH-1]] helicopter gunship. After several weeks in the forest, they sneak back into town, where Jed and Matt learn that their father is being held in a [[re-education]] camp. They visit the site and speak to him through the fence, and learn that their mother is already dead; Mr. Eckert, reminding his sons of how he had purposely raised them in a strenuous manner, orders his sons to avenge his inevitable death and that of his wife.\n\nThe kids visit the Masons and learn that they are behind enemy lines in \"occupied America\". Robert's father is revealed to have been executed because of the missing inventory from his store. The Masons charge Jed and Matt with taking care of their two granddaughters, Toni and Erica. After killing Soviet soldiers in the woods, the youths begin an armed resistance against the occupation forces, calling themselves \"Wolverines\" after their high school mascot. The occupation forces initially try reprisal tactics, executing groups of civilians following every Wolverine attack. During one of these mass executions, the fathers of Jed, Matt, and Aardvark are killed. Daryl's father, Mayor Bates, tries to soften the blow against Calumet and save the lives of the captured citizens by appeasing the occupation authorities, effectively becoming a collaborator, but with little success. Despite the reprisal tactics, the occupation forces get nowhere.\n\nThe Wolverines find a downed American fighter pilot, Lt. Col. Andrew Tanner ([[Powers Boothe]]), who informs them of the current state of the war: several American cities, including Washington, D.C., were destroyed by nuclear strikes; the [[Strategic Air Command]] was crippled by Cuban saboteurs, and paratroopers were dropped from fake commercial airliners to seize key positions in preparation for subsequent assaults via Mexico and [[Alaska]]. Most of the Southern United States and North Western Canada has been taken over by the Soviets, but American counterattacks have halted Soviet advances along the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Mississippi River]] and the lines have stabilized. The only remaining U.S. allies, the United Kingdom and the [[People's Republic of China]], are militarily crippled. Concerned about [[nuclear fallout]], both sides refrain from the further use of nuclear weapons.\n\nTanner assists the Wolverines in organizing raids against the Soviets. Their actions draw the attention of a Soviet General, who orders reprisals against the civilian population. The Wolverines' actions, and the reprisals against civilians eventually leads to the high command of both sides of war to know the name \"Wolverines\", and the Soviet generals publicly stating that the area \"may not be pacified for much longer\". Soon after, in a visit to the front line, Tanner and Aardvark are killed in the crossfire of a tank battle. Daryl is caught by the Soviets after being turned in by his collaborating father. Using threats of torture, KGB officers force Daryl to swallow a [[tracking device]], then release him to rejoin the guerrillas. A ''[[Spetsnaz]]'' unit is sent into the mountains carrying portable [[radio triangulation]] equipment, but are ambushed by the Wolverines. The group traces the source of the radio triangulation signal to Daryl, who confesses and pleads for mercy. He is executed, along with a Spetsnaz operative by an increasingly hardened Robert when the others cannot find the heart to kill their friend. \n\nThe remaining [[Wolverine]]s are ambushed by [[Mi-24]] helicopter gunships, and Toni and Robert are killed, Robert while successfully but suicidally attacking a gunship. Jed and Matt go to attack the Soviet headquarters in Calumet, to distract the troops while Danny and Erica escape. The plan works, but both Jed and Matt are mortally wounded. Colonel Bella comes across the brothers, but sensing the already too-great loss of the war, the colonel is unable to bring himself to kill them, and so he motions them on. The brothers reach a bench in the park where they spent time as kids, holding each other as they die. Meanwhile, Danny and Erica trek through the Rocky Mountain Wilderness where they reach the frontier of Free America.\n\nIn the closing scene, a plaque is seen with Partisan Rock in the background. The rock is fenced off and an American flag flies nearby. The plaque reads:\n\n{{quote|... In the early days of World War III, guerrillas \u2013 mostly children \u2013 placed the names of their lost upon this rock. They fought here alone and gave up their lives, so \"that this nation shall not perish from the earth.\"}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Patrick Swayze]] as Jed Eckert\n* [[C.

Ten children take to the hills when their small town is captured and they turn into a skilled and lethal guerrilla band.<ref>Bart p 109\u2013110</ref>\n\nProducer [[Barry Beckerman]] read the script, and, in the words of Peter Bart, \"thought it had the potential to become a tough, taut, \"art\" picture  made on a modest budget that could possibly break out to find a wider audience.\"<ref name=\"Bart p 110\">Bart p 110</ref> He got his father Sidney Beckerman to help him pay a $5,000 option. Reynolds wanted to direct but the Beckermans wanted someone more established. [[Walter Hill]] briefly considered the script before turning it down. So too did other directors.<ref name=\"Bart p 110\"/>\n\nThe Beckermans pitched the project to [[David Begelman]] when he was at MGM and were turned down. They tried again at that studio when it was being run by [[Frank Yablans]].

Instead of making a poignant little antiwar movie, why not make a teen ''Rambo'' and turn the project over to John Milius, a genial and rotund filmmaker who loved war movies and also loved war? The idea was especially popular with a member of the MGM board of directors, [[Alexander Haig|General Alexander Haig]], the former Nixon chief of staff, who yearned to supervise the film personally and develop a movie career.\"<ref name=\"bart\"/>\n\nBart says most of MGM's executives, except for Yablans, were opposed to Milius directing. Bart claims he made a last minute attempt to get Reynolds to direct the film and went to see Spielberg. However, by this stage ''Fandango'' was in rough cut, and Bart sensed that Spielberg was disappointed in the film and would not speak up for Reynolds.<ref>Bart p 111</ref>\n\nMilius was signed to direct at a fee of $1.25 million, plus a gun of his choice.<ref>Bart p 112</ref>\n\nMilius set about rewriting the script. He and Haig devised a backstory in which the circumstances of the invasion would take place; this was reportedly based on Hitler's proposed plans to invade the USA.<ref>Bart p 112\u2013113</ref> Haig took Milius under his wing, bringing him to the [[Hudson Institute]], the conservative think tank founded by [[Herman Kahn]], to develop a plausible scenario. Milius saw the story as a Third World liberation struggle in reverse; Haig introduced Nicaragua and suggested that, with the collapse of NATO, a left-wing Mexican regime would participate in the Soviet invasion, effectively splitting the U.S. in half.<ref>{{cite news | last=Hoberman | first=J. | title=The North Koreans Are Coming! | newspaper=Film Comment | edition=48.6 | date=November 2012 | pages=52\u201354, 56}}</ref> Bart says, \"Even Milius was taken aback by Haig's approach to the project.
