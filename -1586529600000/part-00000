Admissions decisions are announced in April. The school provides participants with housing, food, and studio space, and the campus offers a library, media lab, and sculpture shop, among other amenities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.resartis.org/en/residencies/list_of_residencies/?id_content=5402|title=List of Residencies {{!}} ResArtis|website=www.resartis.org|access-date=2017-01-19}}</ref> The tuition for the program is $6,000, however aid is available, ensuring that everyone accepted into the program can attend, regardless of financial need.\n\nWhile on campus, the participants interact with five or six resident faculty artists for the duration of the program, as well as five to seven visiting faculty artists, both of whom are selected by Skowhegan\u2019s Board of Governors. Participants are not allowed to bring family or friends with them to Skowhegan, nor are visitors allowed on campus. Lectures by faculty artists, which are generally held on Fridays, are open to the public.\n\n==History==\nDuring [[World War II]], New England portrait painter Willard C. Cummings was stationed in Alaska in the [[United States Army Art Program#History|War Art Unit]]. There, he shared his idea for an educational model \u201cwhere young artists could study with leading artists of the time\u201d with [[Sidney Simon]], a sculptor also in the Unit.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Willard W. Cummings: the Artist|last=Gourley|first=Hugh J.|publisher=Colby College Museum of Art|year=1990|isbn=|location=Waterville|pages=Introduction|quote=|via=}}</ref> Upon returning from the war in 1946, with the help of Simon, [[Henry Varnum Poor (designer)|Henry Varnum Poor]], already an established presence in American Art, and [[Charles Cutler (sculptor)|Charles Cutler]], a New England stone sculptor, Cummings turned his family farm into a functional alternative school run by artists for artists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://commonstreetarts.com/event/skowhegan-at-70/#_ftn2|title=Skowhegan at 70!  {{!}}  Common Street Arts|website=commonstreetarts.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-19}}</ref>\n\nAs the name indicates, Skowhegan was originally focused on the traditional art forms of painting and sculpture, but gradually, the program began accepting artists of all practices, even being the alleged site of the first contemporary [[Land art|Land Art]] piece in 1968 by [[Douglas Leichter]] and [[Richard Saba]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Wholes|last=Glueck|first=Grace|date=October 15, 1967|work=The New York Times|access-date=|via=}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, while the school originally offered classes such as [[life drawing]] or [[En plein air|plein air painting]], it eventually forwent traditional forms of instruction save for weekly faculty lectures, and all classes on campus are now self-directed by participants. [[Fresco]] instruction, however, has always been a part of the program. Today, Skowhegan is one of the few institutions in the [[United States]] that teaches this technique. Since 2010, [[N. Sean Glover]] has been the fresco instructor.\n\nSince 1952, Skowhegan has recorded the lectures given on campus by resident and visiting faculty artists. They now comprise an archive of over 700 lectures and are accessible to artists and researchers in select repositories including The [[Colby College Museum of Art]], The [[Archives of American Art]], The [[Art Institute of Chicago]], The [[Getty Research Institute]], and The [[Museum of Modern Art]]<ref>{{Cite web\n  |title=Skowhegan Lecture Archive\n  |url=https://www.moma.org/learn/resources/archives/EAD/Skowheganf\n  |website=[[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]]\n}}</ref>\n\n==Notable alumni==\n''See also Category list of [[:Category:Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture alumni|Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture alumni]].''\n\nSkowhegan alumni have included a number of well-known artists, including:\n\n*[[Ellen Altfest]] '02\n*[[Nicole Awai]]\n*[[Margaret Day Blake]]<ref name=\"Smithsonian\">{{cite web |title=Margaret Day Blake scrapbook |url=https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/surveys/chicago/art-institute-chicago-institutional-archives/margaret-day-blake |website=Smithsonian Archives of American Art |accessdate=26 June 2018}}</ref> \n*[[Lee Bontecou]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141222194124/http://www.skowheganart.org/index.php?value=Bontecou&theForm=2&page=alumni \"Bontecou, Lee\"], Skowhegan Art, Retrieved 22 December 2014.</ref> \n*[[Brian Bress]] <ref>[https://www.skowheganart.org/skowheganbox2/ \"Bress, Brian\"], Skowhegan Art, Retrieved 13 July 2017.</ref> \n*[[Sarah Cain]] '06 <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skowheganart.org/index.php?page=alumni |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213194413/http://www.skowheganart.org/index.php?page=alumni |archivedate=2015-02-13 }}</ref> \n*[[Dan Corson]] \n*[[Erika Cosby]]<ref name=Driskell1>{{cite book|last1=Driskell|first1=David C.|title=The Other Side of Color: African American Art in the Collection of Camille O. and William H.

Admissions decisions are announced in April. The school provides participants with housing, food, and studio space, and the campus offers a library, media lab, and sculpture shop, among other amenities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.resartis.org/en/residencies/list_of_residencies/?id_content=5402|title=List of Residencies {{!}} ResArtis|website=www.resartis.org|access-date=2017-01-19}}</ref> The tuition for the program is $6,000, however aid is available, ensuring that everyone accepted into the program can attend, regardless of financial need.\n\nWhile on campus, the participants interact with five or six resident faculty artists for the duration of the program, as well as five to seven visiting faculty artists, both of whom are selected by Skowhegan\u2019s Board of Governors. Participants are not allowed to bring family or friends with them to Skowhegan, nor are visitors allowed on campus. Lectures by faculty artists, which are generally held on Fridays, are open to the public.\n\n==History==\nDuring [[World War II]], New England portrait painter Willard C. Cummings was stationed in Alaska in the [[United States Army Art Program#History|War Art Unit]]. There, he shared his idea for an educational model \u201cwhere young artists could study with leading artists of the time\u201d with [[Sidney Simon]], a sculptor also in the Unit.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Willard W.

[[Fresco]] instruction, however, has always been a part of the program. Today, Skowhegan is one of the few institutions in the [[United States]] that teaches this technique. Since 2010, [[N. Sean Glover]] has been the fresco instructor.\n\nSince 1952, Skowhegan has recorded the lectures given on campus by resident and visiting faculty artists. They now comprise an archive of over 700 lectures and are accessible to artists and researchers in select repositories including The [[Colby College Museum of Art]], The [[Archives of American Art]], The [[Art Institute of Chicago]], The [[Getty Research Institute]], and The [[Museum of Modern Art]]<ref>{{Cite web\n  |title=Skowhegan Lecture Archive\n  |url=https://www.moma.org/learn/resources/archives/EAD/Skowheganf\n  |website=[[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]]\n}}</ref>\n\n==Notable alumni==\n''See also Category list of [[:Category:Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture alumni|Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture alumni]].''\n\nSkowhegan alumni have included a number of well-known artists, including:\n\n*[[Ellen Altfest]] '02\n*[[Nicole Awai]]\n*[[Margaret Day Blake]]<ref name=\"Smithsonian\">{{cite web |title=Margaret Day Blake scrapbook |url=https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/surveys/chicago/art-institute-chicago-institutional-archives/margaret-day-blake |website=Smithsonian Archives of American Art |accessdate=26 June 2018}}</ref> \n*[[Lee Bontecou]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141222194124/http://www.skowheganart.org/index.php?value=Bontecou&theForm=2&page=alumni \"Bontecou, Lee\"], Skowhegan Art, Retrieved 22 December 2014.</ref> \n*[[Brian Bress]] <ref>[https://www.skowheganart.org/skowheganbox2/ \"Bress, Brian\"], Skowhegan Art, Retrieved 13 July 2017.</ref> \n*[[Sarah Cain]] '06 <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skowheganart.org/index.php?page=alumni |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213194413/http://www.skowheganart.org/index.php?page=alumni |archivedate=2015-02-13 }}</ref> \n*[[Dan Corson]] \n*[[Erika Cosby]]<ref name=Driskell1>{{cite book|last1=Driskell|first1=David C.|title=The Other Side of Color: African American Art in the Collection of Camille O. and William H.

At Liverpool, Keegan won three [[Football League First Division|First Division]] titles, the [[UEFA Cup]] twice, the [[FA Cup]] and the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. He also gained his first England cap in 1972, and moved to West German club Hamburger SV in the summer of 1977. At Hamburg, he was named [[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer of the Year]] in 1978 and 1979, won the [[Bundesliga]] title in 1978\u201379, and reached the European Cup final in 1980. Keegan moved to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] that summer, and spent two seasons at the club before a transfer to Newcastle United in the English [[Football League Division Two|second division]] in 1982. He helped Newcastle to promotion in his second season, and retired from football in 1984, having been capped 63&nbsp;times for England, scoring 21&nbsp;goals.\n\nHe moved into management at Newcastle in 1992, winning promotion as First Division champions. Newcastle then finished second in the [[Premier League]] in 1995\u201396, after leading for most of the season. After a spell at Fulham, he took charge of the England team in February 1999, but resigned in October 2000, following a 1\u20130 loss against Germany in qualification for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group 9|2002 FIFA World Cup]]. He then became manager of Manchester City in 2001 and spent four years at the club before resigning in 2005. He had been out of football for almost three years when he returned to Newcastle United for a second spell as manager in January 2008.

Despite being one of two players kept on for an extra six-week period, the club did not offer Keegan a contract, though they did offer apprenticeship terms to the right-back [[Brian Joy]] who also went onto have a 15-year career in football.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 492\u2013513}} Keegan also had a trial with his local football club Doncaster Rovers. The trial was arranged by his father but when Keegan arrived for a trial he found out he had been given the wrong information and the trial was earlier in the day and at a different place.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 486}}\n\nKeegan was in to sports, such as cross country running, rugby, football, and even captaining his schools poor cricket team.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 508\u2013509}} He also boxed at his local boxing club run by the former British Heavyweight champion boxer [[Bruce Woodcock (boxer)|Bruce Woodcock]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1345}} At age 15 Keegan, with two friends, ran a 50-mile run from [[Nottingham]] to [[Doncaster]]. After completing this run Keegan claimed he would never hit a psychological brick wall again with regards to running. In his autobiography Keegan claimed this run prepared him physically and psychologically for any running he had to do in any future pre-season training or football matches.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 636\u2013650}} Keegan, distracted by sport, would leave school with [['O'Level]]s in History and Art.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 511}}\n\nAt the age of 15 Keegan started work at [[Pegler Yorkshire|Pegler Brass Works]] as an office clerk; though Keegan admitted he was more of a tea boy and a messenger than an office clerk.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 512}} Whilst working at Pegler, Keegan continued playing Saturday afternoon football for his local youth club Enfield House and playing Sunday morning football for the Lonsdale Hotel.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 518}} It was whilst he was at Pegler that a colleague of Keegan, named Harry Holland, asked Keegan if he fancied a go at playing for the Peglers Works reserves on a Saturday morning; down beaten Keegan accepted the offer to play for the reserve team.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 521}} His chance at professional football did not come at Pegler Works reserves, but came when he was playing Sunday morning league football. When Keegan was playing for the Lonsdale Hotel in a match against Woodfield Social in 1966, Keegan was marked by an older player, in his mid 30s, called Bob Nellis. After playing against Keegan, Nellis became impressed by the ability of Keegan. Nellis had some contacts at Scunthorpe United, and in turn offered Keegan a trial at [[Football League Fourth Division|fourth division]] [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] \u2013 one of just two professional sides in the division. This trial would lead to the Scunthorpe manager [[Ron Ashman]] giving Keegan his first contract in professional football.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 530\u2013543}}<ref name=\"bbcsport\"/>{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53\u201382}}\n\n==Playing career==\n===Scunthorpe United (1966\u20131971)===\nScunthorpe United could not afford a set of football nets and trained on a rugby pitch at [[Quibell Park Stadium|Quibell Park]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 582}} They also, risking injury, had five-a-side training sessions on the Old Showground concrete car park.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 586}} Still though, at Scunthorpe Keegan would take his training very seriously. Twice a week, after training, Keegan would train with a teammate named Derek Hemstead and they would train by doing weighted [[farmers walk]]s up and down the cantilever stand at the [[Old Showground]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 657}} A trait Keegan had was his running ability. In running drills at Scunthorpe Keegan liked trying to finish first and Keegan was told by Jack Brownsword that one thing he has going for him is that he is a one hundred percenter and he should never lose that.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 652}} Though this will to be first in his running drills would later irritate senior pro's such as Liverpool's [[Tommy Smith (footballer, born 1945)|Tommy Smith]]{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 650}} and Shankly would later advise Keegan that he did not have to win all his runs.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 649}}\n\nScunthorpe, a club with little money, did not have a full-time driver to drive them to away games and Keegan, with other the other younger players, such as Nigel Jackson, would take turns in driving the minibus to and from away games.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 578}} Young Keegan, fellow driver Nigel Jackson and fellow young professionals Jimmy Coyne, Alan Olbison and Steve Hibbotson, once borrowed coach [[Jack Brownsword]]'s stop watch and had timed rallies around the Old Showground with the clubs vintage tractor.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 609}} On Keegan's turn the tractor crashed and the tractor's axle went through the engine.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 609}} The crash was very expensive to fix and the five were given a rollicking by manager Ron Ashman.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 609}} This experience gave Keegan awareness of his responsibility as a representative of Scunthorpe United.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 609}} Keegan made his debut against [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] at the age of 17, making 29 league starts in his first season.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 660}} He became a regular in the first team by the [[1969\u201370 in English football|1969\u201370 season]], playing all 46 league games for the club.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 661}} This season saw the team reach the fifth-round of the [[FA Cup]], beating [[Football League First Division]] side [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] along the way. Keegan then missed only one game in his last season.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 661}} Earning a pittance, meant Keegan each summer had to find summer jobs; and each summer he would do jobs such as plate-laying at the [[Scunthorpe Steelworks|Appleby Frodingham Steelworks]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 600}}\n\n{{external media | float = right | width = 300px | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/embed/S_KSWseOaaE?start=32&end=127 Keegan interviewed in 1969-70]}} Keegan played regularly in a [[playmaker|creative]] [[right midfield]] role for the Scunthorpe United first team despite his age \u2013 he scored 18 goals in 124 games for the club. After his first season he started attracting interest from higher division clubs. In one rare television interview of Keegan at Scunthorpe in 1969\u201370, Keegan tried to play down the interest, stating: \"I'm getting first-team football here. Should think if I went First Division, I'd struggle a bit.\"{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 665}} Not long after this interview, Keegan, noting other players had moved on to a higher level, began to feel impatient about moving on and Keegan even considered packing the game in and getting a full-time job if he did not get a move to a higher level.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 667\u2013672}} Higher division clubs such as Preston, Birmingham City, Notts County, Millwall and Arsenal all showed interest but nothing came of it.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 677}}\n\n===Liverpool (1971\u20131977)===\nIn 1971, he attracted the attention of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]'s head scout [[Geoff Twentyman]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2009/08/07/liverpool-fc-super-scout-geoff-twentyman-s-secret-diary-revealed-100252-24338468/|title=Liverpool FC super-scout Geoff Twentyman's secret diary revealed| first= Tony |last = Barret| date = 7 August 2009|accessdate=29 April 2011|newspaper=Liverpool Echo}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Secret Diary of a Liverpool Scout| first=Simon |last=Hughes| date = 6 August 2009|publisher=Trinity Mirror Sport Media}}</ref> whose opinion was held in high regard by manager [[Bill Shankly]].

The [[1973 UEFA Cup Final]] first leg at Anfield was abandoned due to a downpour after 27 minutes and rescheduled to be played again the next day.

Liverpool, however, progressed to the FA Cup final. Their campaign in the competition had started with a tie against the club which had rejected Keegan, Doncaster Rovers, and it was Keegan who scored both Liverpool goals in a 2\u20132 draw. Liverpool won the replay and Keegan scored twice more on the way to [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], including a lob-volley over the head of England colleague [[Peter Shilton]] in the semi-final against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] at [[Villa Park]].\n\nIn the [[1974 FA Cup Final|1974 final]], Liverpool played Newcastle United.

Leeds had decided to niggle at Liverpool, and in particular Keegan, in the match. In one instance [[Johnny Giles]] punched the unsuspecting Keegan and was reprieved after Keegan asked the referee to be lenient.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Giles, after escaping a red card, then later lunged two-footed at Keegan.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Upon Keegan's outraged reaction [[Billy Bremner]] challenged Keegan.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Keegan then exploded and punched Bremner.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Bremner punched back.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} They were sent off, the first time anyone had been sent off in a Charity Shield match.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Both players removed their shirts in protest, with Keegan visibly shaken by the decision. Inside the Liverpool dressing room, Bremner approached Keegan to apologise and was met by the fury of Keegan's father who had come down to check on his son.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} They both received lengthy bans.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} The fight was shown that night on [[BBC]] television and both were fined \u00a3500, with Keegan being suspended for three games and Bremner eight.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53\u201382}}  Despite this, Keegan, Bremner and Giles remained good friends outside of football.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}}\n\nThe next year saw Keegan scoring goals and representing his club and country, but [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375]] was a trophyless season for Liverpool and England failed to qualify for the [[UEFA Euro 1976|European Championships]]. There were numerous honours for Keegan over the next two years, however, as Liverpool again won the League championship and UEFA Cup in [[1975\u201376 in English football|1975\u201376]]. Keegan scored in both legs of the UEFA Cup final against [[Club Brugge KV|FC Bruges]], having only scored once previously during Liverpool's run in the competition.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53\u201382}}\n\nIn [[1976\u201377 Liverpool F.C. season|1976\u201377]], Keegan helped Liverpool get close to an unprecedented \"[[treble (association football)|treble]]\" of League championship, FA Cup and [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], although midway through the season he announced his intention to leave in the summer to play abroad. Nevertheless, Keegan was irrepressible as Liverpool clinched the title and reached the finals of both Cup competitions. Keegan's last appearance in a Liverpool shirt on home soil saw Liverpool lose the FA Cup final to bitter rivals [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], ending the possibility of the treble.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53\u201382}} The European Cup final in [[Rome]] against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach was four days later. Keegan did not score, but he did make a late run which led to a foul inside the penalty area by [[Berti Vogts]]. This led to a penalty which was successfully converted by [[Phil Neal]], sealing a 3\u20131 win. In this season, on the 4 December 1976, Keegan's father, who had been suffering from cancer, died at the age of 71.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 352}}\n\nAfter 323 appearances and exactly 100 goals, Keegan left Liverpool. He had been made offers from clubs across Europe, and chose to join [[Hamburger SV]] in the West German [[Bundesliga]] for \u00a3500,000. Liverpool replaced him with [[Kenny Dalglish]].{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53\u201382}} Of his time in Liverpool, Keegan later said, \"The only thing I fear is missing an open goal in front of the [[Spion Kop (stadia)|Kop]].

He explained how he missed British cereals that he could not find in the supermarkets in Germany. The Hamburg fans then flooded him with parcels of his favourite cereal with lists of the suppliers.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1321-1324}} There were language difficulties early on. In one instance in the summer, Keegan went into a hardware shop intending to buy a fuse and he eventually left the shop after buying Christmas lights.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1314}}\n\nHe scored in pre-season friendlies against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and former club Liverpool, but the club suffered defeat in the [[European Super Cup]] against the [[Merseyside]]rs.

Having negotiated a maximum transfer fee of \u00a3500,000 in his contract the year before and agreeing to a move in February, Keegan left Hamburg for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in the summer of 1980.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=173\u2013191}}\n\n===Southampton (1980\u20131982)===\nOn 11 February 1980, [[Lawrie McMenemy]] called a press conference at the Potters Heron hotel, [[Ampfield]] to announce that the European Footballer of the Year would be joining Southampton in the forthcoming summer.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1559-1573}} The news caused surprise throughout the world of football and around the city of [[Southampton]], as Southampton were a relatively small club.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1559-1573}} The club were beginning to become established in the top division, but this signing showed how persuasive their manager could be, especially when Keegan captained England in the [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980 European Championships]] in Italy.\n\nKeegan had a clause inserted into his contract when he joined Hamburg in 1977, giving Liverpool the option to buy him back.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1562}} Liverpool, however, opted not to exercise this clause when he returned to England three years later. As late as November 2011, Keegan has stated, \"I was with Lawrie [McMenemy] at a charity event the other day, and he said he phoned up Peter Robinson because he wanted me, but Liverpool had a clause. Peter said, 'No, we won't be signing him, definitely, we don't need him.'\" It was, therefore, Southampton boss Lawrie McMenemy who snapped him up for \u00a3420,000, and Keegan made his Southampton debut at [[Lansdowne Road]] in a pre-season friendly against [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] on 23 July 1980.\n\nKeegan's two seasons at [[The Dell (Southampton)|The Dell]] saw him as part of a flamboyant team also containing [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]], [[Phil Boyer]], [[Mick Channon]] and [[Charlie George]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1557-1559}} In [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]] Saints scored 76 goals, finishing in sixth place, then their highest league finish.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1619}}\n\nIn the following season, Keegan was able to produce some of his best form and at the beginning of April 1982 Southampton sat at the top of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] table,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1619}} but a run of only three wins from the end of February meant a seventh-place finish,<ref>{{cite book | first1=Duncan |last1=Holley |first2=Gary |last2=Chalk | title=In That Number \u2013 A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |page=167| isbn= }}</ref> 21 points off 1st place.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1619}} Despite this, Keegan was voted the [[PFA Player of the Year]] and awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for services to Association Football.

Keegan who had stated that he would never enter football management, did carry out occasional work as a football pundit for British television.\n\n==International career==\nKeegan made his [[England national football team|England]] debut on 15 November 1972 in a 1\u20130 World Cup qualifying win over [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. Keegan appeared in only the two matches against Wales during this campaign as England failed to qualify for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]].<ref name=ES>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandstats.com/playerreport.php?pid=557|title=Kevin Keegan|accessdate=30 July 2008|publisher=englandstats.com}}</ref>\n\nHe scored his first international goal in his third appearance, also against Wales, on 11 May 1974. He was given the captaincy by manager [[Don Revie]] in 1976 after [[Gerry Francis]] fell victim to a long term injury. He went on to captain England 31 times, retaining the captain's armband until his international retirement after the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]].\n\nKeegan captained England at the [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980 Euros]]. England failed to progress from the group stage after finishing third in their group behind Italy and Belgium.\n\nHe managed only one World Cup appearance though, after England failed to qualify for both the [[1974 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 5|1974]] and [[1978 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 2|1978]] tournaments. He finally reached a [[1982 FIFA World Cup|World Cup in 1982]] when England got to the finals in Spain. He was named in the squad for the tournament, but was suffering from a chronic back injury and was unfit to play in all of England's group games. In a last, desperate effort to play in a World Cup (he knew that he would not be around for the 1986 competition) he secretly hired a car and drove from Spain to a [[medical specialist|specialist]] he knew in Germany for intensive treatment. He recovered sufficiently to appear as a substitute for the last 26 minutes of England's final second-round game against hosts [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. During this time he missed a point-blank header which would have broken the deadlock, in a game England needed to win to progress to the semi-finals. England drew the game 0\u20130 and were eliminated from the competition.\n\nFollowing the successful start to the [[1982\u201383 in English football|1982\u201383 season]] with Newcastle United, there was much controversy when newly appointed England manager [[Bobby Robson]] did not select Keegan for his first squad,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TvFtlOSX_g | title = Match of the 80s \u2013 Season 82\u201383 (Part 1 of 4) | publisher = YouTube | date = 13 July 2007 | accessdate =27 August 2011}}</ref> a decision Keegan learned of from the media rather than Robson himself. Keegan publicly expressed his displeasure at not being given the courtesy of a phone call from Robson, and never played for his country again. He had won a total of 63 [[cap (sport)|caps]] and scored 21 goals.\n\n==Managerial career==\n===Newcastle United===\nOn 5 February 1992, almost eight years after his final game as a player, Keegan returned to football as manager of Newcastle United. They had been relegated from the [[Football League First Division|top flight]] in 1989 and narrowly missed out on promotion in 1990 after losing in the playoffs to arch-rivals [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], but in 1991 they had failed to make the playoffs and at several stages in [[1991\u201392 in English football|1991\u201392]], they had temporarily occupied bottom place in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. Following the dismissal of previous manager [[Ossie Ardiles]], Keegan was appointed to prevent Newcastle from being relegated to the [[Football League Third Division|third tier]] of [[Football in England|English football]] for the first time. Keegan joined a club that still had participants from the old board room battles that had been going on at the club for decades.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} It has been argued the internal struggles from the former regime had held the club back.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} After three or more years trying, John Hall had recently won the board room from the old regime.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} Though John Hall was not yet confirmed as the chairman he had accrued enough power to make the key decisions.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} The board members belonging to the former regime were only told by John Hall, one hour before Keegan\u2019s first press conference that Kevin Keegan would be the manager.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} Keegan had only watched two live matches in seven years. One was the European Cup final in 1991 and the other being a Newcastle United 0-0 draw against Blackburn; as such, calls were made that suggested Keegan was unprepared and inexperienced.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2323-2341}} \n\nWhen Keegan turned up to Benwell for his first training session as manager, he noted the training ground was in a mess. Keegan was surprised at the timely neglect of the training ground facilities.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} The training ground was in the process of being sold, despite this, Keegan paid for the clean up of the training ground with his own money,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} with the cleaning work being done in one weekend.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} Keegan felt this clean up work was an important move and an indirect statement to the players that conveyed to the players that their professionalism, from now on, had to be high.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} Assessing the squad, Keegan opined that the squad was not good enough to reach the level he and McDermott once played at.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2380-2400}} In five-a-sides he and Terry Mcdermott, both in their 40s, with their lack of conditioning, believed they were two of the stand out players.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2380-2400}} Keegan noted the club had an impressive crop of youth players. This crop included: [[Lee Clark (footballer)|Lee Clark]], [[Steve Watson]], [[Steve Howey (footballer)|Steve Howey]], [[Alan Thompson (footballer, born 1973)|Alan Thompson]] and [[Robbie Elliott]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2380-2400}} These young players would form a core of players involved in Keegan's Newcastle squads from 1992 to 1997.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2380-2400}} Prior to his first game, Keegan made his first tough call with his squad of players when he dropped the midfielder Lee Clark.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2400-2405}} Though he liked Clark's spirit, Keegan believed he was at risk of being sent off.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2400-2405}} Keegan's first game, against Bristol City, ended in 3-0 victory in front of a capacity crowd.\n\nKeegan's managerial guidance in the 1991\u201392 season helped secure survival, which meant Newcastle United would play in the new Division One for the [[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393 season]]. Chairman [[John Hall (businessman)|John Hall]] also promised Keegan millions of pounds to spend on new players after Keegan almost walked out on the club after a match, in the 1991\u201392 season, at home to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] which was played on the 14 March 1992.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Turnbull|first1=Simon|title=Welcome to the North-east...

Newcastle began the season with 11 successive wins and led the league virtually all season, and the club record signing of [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] striker [[Andy Cole]] in February further strengthened their side; Cole netted 12 goals in his first 12 games for the club. The addition of [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]'s [[Rob Lee]] bolstered the midfield in the autumn.\n\nNewcastle were promoted to the Premier League as Division One champions.\n\nTop scorer [[David Kelly (association footballer)|David Kelly]] and influential midfielder [[Gavin Peacock]] were both sold during the close season, and Keegan brought striker [[Peter Beardsley]] back to Newcastle from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], six years after he had been sold by Newcastle to Liverpool.\n\n[[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]] was an enormous success for Newcastle as they finished third in the Premier League and qualified for the UEFA Cup, bringing European football to the club for the first time since the 1970s. Andy Cole was the Premier League's top scorer with 34 goals from 40 games, and managed a club record total of 41 goals in all competitions.\n\nKeegan then strengthened his side by signing [[Switzerland national football team|Swiss]] [[FIFA World Cup 1994|World Cup]] defender [[Marc Hottiger]] and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium's]] defensive midfielder [[Philippe Albert]], while [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]'s quick winger [[Ruel Fox]] had arrived on transfer deadline day in March 1994.\n\nNewcastle won their first six games of the [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395 season]] to top the league and they appeared capable of winning their first league title since 1927. But the shock departure of Andy Cole to Manchester United in January weakened their attack, and finished the season sixth place in the final table; not enough for even another UEFA Cup campaign. In the meantime, autumn signing [[Paul Kitson]] partnered Beardsley in attack.\n\nKeegan made several important additions to the Newcastle side in the summer of 1995: [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] goalkeeper [[Shaka Hislop]], [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]'s French winger [[David Ginola]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] striker [[Les Ferdinand]] and [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] defender [[Warren Barton]]. Ferdinand was Newcastle's biggest signing at \u00a36 million, while the \u00a34 million paid for Barton was the highest fee paid for a defender in English football at the time.\n\nNewcastle excelled in the first half of the [[1995\u201396 in English football|1995\u201396 season]], going ten points ahead on 23 December 1995 and holding a 12-point lead from early in January to 4 February. After a 2\u20130 defeat at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on 21 February, the lead was cut to nine points. A 1\u20130 defeat at the hands of fellow title challengers Manchester United cut the gap to a single point on 4 March, and within two weeks Newcastle's lead was overhauled and they were unable to recover it. Newcastle's [[Liverpool F.C. 4\u20133 Newcastle United F.C. (1996)|4\u20133 defeat]] to Liverpool on 3 April is widely considered<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1300229/Premier-League-games-Ten-greatest.html|title=Ten of the greatest: Premier League games}}</ref> to be one of the classic Premier League games.

The tribunal ruled in favour of Keegan, agreeing that Newcastle had [[constructive dismissal|constructively dismissed]] him by insisting on the signing of midfielder [[Ignacio Mar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez|Nacho Gonz\u00e1lez]] on loan (which was against his wishes) to replace [[James Milner]] following his move to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and a bid for Bayern Munich's [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]] being rejected.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/incredible-story-newcastle-trying-sign-12813690|title = The incredible story of Newcastle trying to sign Schweinsteiger on the cheap \u2013 and Keegan quitting|first=Mark | last=Douglas |work=Evening Chronicle|date=29 March 2017|accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe ruling<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nufc.com/2009-10html/2009-10-02kk-vs-nufc.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128060800/http://www.nufc.com/2009-10html/2009-10-02kk-vs-nufc.html| archivedate=28 November 2010| title=KK v NUFC \u2013 the verdict|publisher=nufc.com|date=2 October 2009|accessdate=10 August 2014}}</ref> was based around seven issues. The panel declared that Keegan had been misled to believe he had the final decision on player transfers, and was never explicitly told in writing, his contract, or word of mouth that he did not or that his role would see him essentially report to others. Given the generally understood role of a Premiership manager, the panel agreed he could reasonably expect that this was not a factor. The club's signing of Gonz\u00e1lez meant that they had violated his employment contract, which amounted to constructive dismissal. While Gonz\u00e1lez was the main issue in the panel final decision, the club's alleged mistreatment of Keegan, claiming they were in a position to sack him should he have not agreed to the terms they offered him, as well as his decision to remain at the club until the 4 September instead of resigning on 1 September, allowing the club to reach a compromise, led to the panel ruling in Keegan's favour. Keegan was awarded \u00a32&nbsp;million (plus interest accrued) according to severance clauses in his contract, which the club never paid him after his departure. Claims for more were turned down on the basis that the standard contract severance clauses covered constructive dismissal, but he stated afterwards that the purpose of his claim had been to restore his reputation, and was delighted with the outcome, allowing him to move forward.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/8286967.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Keegan wins \u00a32m Newcastle damages | date=2 October 2009 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn pursuit of winning the tribunal, the club admitted to misleading the media and their fans. Several key senior staff, including Dennis Wise and [[Derek Llambias]], had publicly claimed that Keegan had \"the final word\"; they claimed to the tribunal that this was not in fact the case and that their claims were just \"PR\". It was then revealed that Director of Football Dennis Wise asked Keegan to sign Gonz\u00e1lez by watching him \"on [[YouTube]]\". On 21 October, a subsequent meeting of the same panel found that the club should pay all legal and associated costs incurred by Keegan as a result of the tribunal. They reached this conclusion based on their view that the club's \"defence on the primary liability issue was, in our view, wholly without merit\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_5642081,00.html | work=Sky Sports | title=Magpies must pay Keegan costs | date = 21 October 2009 | accessdate =3 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nKeegan stated after the hearing he still wants to manage in the top flight of football, and would consider returning to his position at the club, but feels the fans may be exhausted from his last tenure and would prefer him not to.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_5608630,00.html | work=Sky Sports | title=Keegan wants to manage again | date = 5 October 2009 | accessdate =3 March 2012 | first = Richard | last = Bailey}}</ref> In June 2013, Keegan stated he would only consider a return should owner Mike Ashley leave the club.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/kevin-keegan-labels-return-to-newcastle-as-an-absolute-living-nightmare-8648184.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Kevin Keegan labels return to Newcastle as 'an absolute living nightmare' | date=6 June 2013}}</ref> Keegan has continued to criticise Ashley, accusing him of a lack of respect for the fans.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/newcastle-united-news-kevin-keegan-3492049 | work=Daily Mirror | title=Kevin Keegan slams Newcastle owner Mike Ashley for showing 'a total lack of respect' to supporters | date = 3 May 2014 | accessdate =16 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2009, nearly a year after his departure from Newcastle, Keegan resurfaced after being confirmed as the lead pundit on [[ESPN (UK)|ESPN]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/aug/24/espn-premiership-kevin-keegan | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=ESPN signs Kevin Keegan to front its Premier League coverage | first=Mark | last=Sweney | date=24 August 2009 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> During the course of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], Keegan featured as a pundit for [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] broadcasts.

At Liverpool, Keegan won three [[Football League First Division|First Division]] titles, the [[UEFA Cup]] twice, the [[FA Cup]] and the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. He also gained his first England cap in 1972, and moved to West German club Hamburger SV in the summer of 1977. At Hamburg, he was named [[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer of the Year]] in 1978 and 1979, won the [[Bundesliga]] title in 1978\u201379, and reached the European Cup final in 1980. Keegan moved to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] that summer, and spent two seasons at the club before a transfer to Newcastle United in the English [[Football League Division Two|second division]] in 1982. He helped Newcastle to promotion in his second season, and retired from football in 1984, having been capped 63&nbsp;times for England, scoring 21&nbsp;goals.\n\nHe moved into management at Newcastle in 1992, winning promotion as First Division champions. Newcastle then finished second in the [[Premier League]] in 1995\u201396, after leading for most of the season. After a spell at Fulham, he took charge of the England team in February 1999, but resigned in October 2000, following a 1\u20130 loss against Germany in qualification for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group 9|2002 FIFA World Cup]]. He then became manager of Manchester City in 2001 and spent four years at the club before resigning in 2005. He had been out of football for almost three years when he returned to Newcastle United for a second spell as manager in January 2008.

Despite being one of two players kept on for an extra six-week period, the club did not offer Keegan a contract, though they did offer apprenticeship terms to the right-back [[Brian Joy]] who also went onto have a 15-year career in football.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 492\u2013513}} Keegan also had a trial with his local football club Doncaster Rovers. The trial was arranged by his father but when Keegan arrived for a trial he found out he had been given the wrong information and the trial was earlier in the day and at a different place.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 486}}\n\nKeegan was in to sports, such as cross country running, rugby, football, and even captaining his schools poor cricket team.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 508\u2013509}} He also boxed at his local boxing club run by the former British Heavyweight champion boxer [[Bruce Woodcock (boxer)|Bruce Woodcock]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1345}} At age 15 Keegan, with two friends, ran a 50-mile run from [[Nottingham]] to [[Doncaster]].

In his autobiography Keegan claimed this run prepared him physically and psychologically for any running he had to do in any future pre-season training or football matches.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 636\u2013650}} Keegan, distracted by sport, would leave school with [['O'Level]]s in History and Art.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 511}}\n\nAt the age of 15 Keegan started work at [[Pegler Yorkshire|Pegler Brass Works]] as an office clerk; though Keegan admitted he was more of a tea boy and a messenger than an office clerk.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 512}} Whilst working at Pegler, Keegan continued playing Saturday afternoon football for his local youth club Enfield House and playing Sunday morning football for the Lonsdale Hotel.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 518}} It was whilst he was at Pegler that a colleague of Keegan, named Harry Holland, asked Keegan if he fancied a go at playing for the Peglers Works reserves on a Saturday morning; down beaten Keegan accepted the offer to play for the reserve team.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 521}} His chance at professional football did not come at Pegler Works reserves, but came when he was playing Sunday morning league football. When Keegan was playing for the Lonsdale Hotel in a match against Woodfield Social in 1966, Keegan was marked by an older player, in his mid 30s, called Bob Nellis. After playing against Keegan, Nellis became impressed by the ability of Keegan. Nellis had some contacts at Scunthorpe United, and in turn offered Keegan a trial at [[Football League Fourth Division|fourth division]] [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] \u2013 one of just two professional sides in the division.

Twice a week, after training, Keegan would train with a teammate named Derek Hemstead and they would train by doing weighted [[farmers walk]]s up and down the cantilever stand at the [[Old Showground]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 657}} A trait Keegan had was his running ability. In running drills at Scunthorpe Keegan liked trying to finish first and Keegan was told by Jack Brownsword that one thing he has going for him is that he is a one hundred percenter and he should never lose that.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 652}} Though this will to be first in his running drills would later irritate senior pro's such as Liverpool's [[Tommy Smith (footballer, born 1945)|Tommy Smith]]{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 650}} and Shankly would later advise Keegan that he did not have to win all his runs.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 649}}\n\nScunthorpe, a club with little money, did not have a full-time driver to drive them to away games and Keegan, with other the other younger players, such as Nigel Jackson, would take turns in driving the minibus to and from away games.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 578}} Young Keegan, fellow driver Nigel Jackson and fellow young professionals Jimmy Coyne, Alan Olbison and Steve Hibbotson, once borrowed coach [[Jack Brownsword]]'s stop watch and had timed rallies around the Old Showground with the clubs vintage tractor.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 609}} On Keegan's turn the tractor crashed and the tractor's axle went through the engine.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 609}} The crash was very expensive to fix and the five were given a rollicking by manager Ron Ashman.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 609}} This experience gave Keegan awareness of his responsibility as a representative of Scunthorpe United.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 609}} Keegan made his debut against [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] at the age of 17, making 29 league starts in his first season.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 660}} He became a regular in the first team by the [[1969\u201370 in English football|1969\u201370 season]], playing all 46 league games for the club.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 661}} This season saw the team reach the fifth-round of the [[FA Cup]], beating [[Football League First Division]] side [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] along the way.

After his first season he started attracting interest from higher division clubs. In one rare television interview of Keegan at Scunthorpe in 1969\u201370, Keegan tried to play down the interest, stating: \"I'm getting first-team football here. Should think if I went First Division, I'd struggle a bit.\"{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 665}} Not long after this interview, Keegan, noting other players had moved on to a higher level, began to feel impatient about moving on and Keegan even considered packing the game in and getting a full-time job if he did not get a move to a higher level.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 667\u2013672}} Higher division clubs such as Preston, Birmingham City, Notts County, Millwall and Arsenal all showed interest but nothing came of it.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 677}}\n\n===Liverpool (1971\u20131977)===\nIn 1971, he attracted the attention of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]'s head scout [[Geoff Twentyman]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2009/08/07/liverpool-fc-super-scout-geoff-twentyman-s-secret-diary-revealed-100252-24338468/|title=Liverpool FC super-scout Geoff Twentyman's secret diary revealed| first= Tony |last = Barret| date = 7 August 2009|accessdate=29 April 2011|newspaper=Liverpool Echo}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Secret Diary of a Liverpool Scout| first=Simon |last=Hughes| date = 6 August 2009|publisher=Trinity Mirror Sport Media}}</ref> whose opinion was held in high regard by manager [[Bill Shankly]].

Their campaign in the competition had started with a tie against the club which had rejected Keegan, Doncaster Rovers, and it was Keegan who scored both Liverpool goals in a 2\u20132 draw.

Leeds had decided to niggle at Liverpool, and in particular Keegan, in the match. In one instance [[Johnny Giles]] punched the unsuspecting Keegan and was reprieved after Keegan asked the referee to be lenient.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Giles, after escaping a red card, then later lunged two-footed at Keegan.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Upon Keegan's outraged reaction [[Billy Bremner]] challenged Keegan.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Keegan then exploded and punched Bremner.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Bremner punched back.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} They were sent off, the first time anyone had been sent off in a Charity Shield match.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Both players removed their shirts in protest, with Keegan visibly shaken by the decision. Inside the Liverpool dressing room, Bremner approached Keegan to apologise and was met by the fury of Keegan's father who had come down to check on his son.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} They both received lengthy bans.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} The fight was shown that night on [[BBC]] television and both were fined \u00a3500, with Keegan being suspended for three games and Bremner eight.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53\u201382}}  Despite this, Keegan, Bremner and Giles remained good friends outside of football.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}}\n\nThe next year saw Keegan scoring goals and representing his club and country, but [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375]] was a trophyless season for Liverpool and England failed to qualify for the [[UEFA Euro 1976|European Championships]]. There were numerous honours for Keegan over the next two years, however, as Liverpool again won the League championship and UEFA Cup in [[1975\u201376 in English football|1975\u201376]]. Keegan scored in both legs of the UEFA Cup final against [[Club Brugge KV|FC Bruges]], having only scored once previously during Liverpool's run in the competition.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53\u201382}}\n\nIn [[1976\u201377 Liverpool F.C. season|1976\u201377]], Keegan helped Liverpool get close to an unprecedented \"[[treble (association football)|treble]]\" of League championship, FA Cup and [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], although midway through the season he announced his intention to leave in the summer to play abroad. Nevertheless, Keegan was irrepressible as Liverpool clinched the title and reached the finals of both Cup competitions. Keegan's last appearance in a Liverpool shirt on home soil saw Liverpool lose the FA Cup final to bitter rivals [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], ending the possibility of the treble.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53\u201382}} The European Cup final in [[Rome]] against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach was four days later. Keegan did not score, but he did make a late run which led to a foul inside the penalty area by [[Berti Vogts]]. This led to a penalty which was successfully converted by [[Phil Neal]], sealing a 3\u20131 win. In this season, on the 4 December 1976, Keegan's father, who had been suffering from cancer, died at the age of 71.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 352}}\n\nAfter 323 appearances and exactly 100 goals, Keegan left Liverpool. He had been made offers from clubs across Europe, and chose to join [[Hamburger SV]] in the West German [[Bundesliga]] for \u00a3500,000. Liverpool replaced him with [[Kenny Dalglish]].{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53\u201382}} Of his time in Liverpool, Keegan later said, \"The only thing I fear is missing an open goal in front of the [[Spion Kop (stadia)|Kop]].

In training he would not receive the ball after he made a run.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1248-1253}} Rules also stated that no club was allowed more than two foreign players, and unknowingly to Keegan he had also upset some of his new teammates as his move had indirectly moved out the three times European Cup winner [[Horst Blankenburg]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1260}} Blankenburg was a very popular member of the squad.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1260}} There was also a belief and a resentment amongst the players that the previous coach, who the players liked and did not think needed replacing, was replaced by Krohn, to accommodate Keegan.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1263-1267}} It was not until Keegan had moved out of temporary accommodation and moved to a bungalow in the little village of [[Itzstedt]] that Keegan began to feel he could make inroads and make a go of football and life in Germany.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1278}}\n\nIn one early interview Keegan mentioned how he was settling in. He explained how he missed British cereals that he could not find in the supermarkets in Germany. The Hamburg fans then flooded him with parcels of his favourite cereal with lists of the suppliers.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1321-1324}} There were language difficulties early on. In one instance in the summer, Keegan went into a hardware shop intending to buy a fuse and he eventually left the shop after buying Christmas lights.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1314}}\n\nHe scored in pre-season friendlies against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and former club Liverpool, but the club suffered defeat in the [[European Super Cup]] against the [[Merseyside]]rs. Keegan's time in Hamburg got off to a bad start. Keegan's first league match was against Duisburg and Hamburg lost 5-2. Rudi Gutendorf, the manager some believe was appointed for Keegan, would last until October.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1299-1305}}\n\nKeegan was sent off in a mid-season friendly against [[VfB L\u00fcbeck]] after knocking out an opposition player with a punch.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=147\u2013172}} In the winter break of his first season, and being isolated by the clique in the dressing room, frustrated Keegan played a friendly against lower league club L\u00fcbeck.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1332-1368}} A player in the match decided to target Keegan.

Although the club finished tenth in the league in [[1977\u201378 Bundesliga|1977\u201378]], Keegan's 12 goals helped him pick up a personal honour, the ''[[France Football]]'' [[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer of the Year]] award for 1978.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=147\u2013172}}<ref name=FF>{{cite web|url=http://www.francefootball.fr/ballon-d-or/Ballon_Or_2011/palmares.php|title=Ballon d'or|accessdate=10 August 2014|publisher=France Football|language=French|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812204919/http://www.francefootball.fr/ballon-d-or/Ballon_Or_2011/palmares.php|archivedate=12 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHamburg appointed [[Branko Zebec]], a Yugoslav as a new coach.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1381}} Zebec was a man who was known to work players to the max.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1381}} Zebec's squad did a lot of running and Keegan claimed he had never been worked as hard in his life.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1386}} The [[1978\u201379 Bundesliga|1978\u201379 season]] saw a vast improvement on the club's 1978 finish.

In February in the 1979-80 season, Keegan announced he was leaving after his contract was up. One of the reasons for leaving was Zebec's training regime. Keegan had a lot of respect for Zebec,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1522}} though Keegan also reasoned that Zebec's extreme fitness regime philosophy was flawed for the modern-day footballer.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1522-1527}} Keegan even told Zebec that his training regime would burn himself out as a footballer and that he believed he would be finished from playing by 30 if he continued.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1522-1527}} Zebec, in turn responded to Keegan's critique and explained to Keegan it was the same for all the players.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1522-1527}} Keegan then implied to Zebec that players have different roles and not all players run the same distances on match days; he pointed out to Zebec that because of his role and his effort, on match days not many players in the squad ran as much as himself.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1522-1527}} At Hamburg Keegan even doodled with a pen and paper what he thought of the training regime.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1522}} Keegan, as the metaphorical prisoner, drew a cartoon picture of Zebec in sunglasses, with he and his teammates doing press-ups, and then scribed Roman numerals conveying Keegan was counting down to his freedom. These drawings were left in his training ground locker. The drawings and Keegan's personal locker are now held in the Hamburg museum under the title 'HSV Legenden'{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1522}}\n\nHamburg's [[1979\u201380 European Cup|European campaign of 1979\u201380]] saw Keegan score two goals to help Hamburg past [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]], Soviet champions who had beaten Liverpool to reach the latter stages.

Having negotiated a maximum transfer fee of \u00a3500,000 in his contract the year before and agreeing to a move in February, Keegan left Hamburg for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in the summer of 1980.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=173\u2013191}}\n\n===Southampton (1980\u20131982)===\nOn 11 February 1980, [[Lawrie McMenemy]] called a press conference at the Potters Heron hotel, [[Ampfield]] to announce that the European Footballer of the Year would be joining Southampton in the forthcoming summer.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1559-1573}} The news caused surprise throughout the world of football and around the city of [[Southampton]], as Southampton were a relatively small club.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1559-1573}} The club were beginning to become established in the top division, but this signing showed how persuasive their manager could be, especially when Keegan captained England in the [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980 European Championships]] in Italy.\n\nKeegan had a clause inserted into his contract when he joined Hamburg in 1977, giving Liverpool the option to buy him back.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1562}} Liverpool, however, opted not to exercise this clause when he returned to England three years later. As late as November 2011, Keegan has stated, \"I was with Lawrie [McMenemy] at a charity event the other day, and he said he phoned up Peter Robinson because he wanted me, but Liverpool had a clause. Peter said, 'No, we won't be signing him, definitely, we don't need him.'\" It was, therefore, Southampton boss Lawrie McMenemy who snapped him up for \u00a3420,000, and Keegan made his Southampton debut at [[Lansdowne Road]] in a pre-season friendly against [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] on 23 July 1980.\n\nKeegan's two seasons at [[The Dell (Southampton)|The Dell]] saw him as part of a flamboyant team also containing [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]], [[Phil Boyer]], [[Mick Channon]] and [[Charlie George]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1557-1559}} In [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]] Saints scored 76 goals, finishing in sixth place, then their highest league finish.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1619}}\n\nIn the following season, Keegan was able to produce some of his best form and at the beginning of April 1982 Southampton sat at the top of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] table,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1619}} but a run of only three wins from the end of February meant a seventh-place finish,<ref>{{cite book | first1=Duncan |last1=Holley |first2=Gary |last2=Chalk | title=In That Number \u2013 A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |page=167| isbn= }}</ref> 21 points off 1st place.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1619}} Despite this, Keegan was voted the [[PFA Player of the Year]] and awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for services to Association Football.

Keegan, along with Terry McDermott, Jeff Clark and David McCreery, now had a senior status.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2042-2046}} As a senior pro, his manager, Arthur Cox, who would later join many of Keegan's coaching teams when Keegan would later become a manager, had a different relationship to Keegan than with other players.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2042-2046}} Cox would ask Keegan his opinion on players.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2042-2046}}\n\nTo Keegan, Cox was a task master,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2036}} with a good sense of humour.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2036}} Cox would condition the players like commandos by having Keegan and his teammates running up and down the hills in Gateshead.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2047-2051}}\n\nIn his first season Newcastle finished fifth.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2042}} and Keegan maintained that after a faltering season, this position was a flattering league position.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2042}} Keegan, finished this season with 21 goals in 37 appearances and won North East Player of the Year.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2045}}\n\nIn September 1983, Keegan answered a phone call at 1:00 am from Arthur Cox.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2076-2093}} In the phone call Cox explained to Keegan, sharply, he had signed a player called [[Peter Beardsley]] from [[Vancouver Whitecaps]] and explained to Keegan that he'd like him; after giving Keegan the message, Cox immediately put the phone down...{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2076-2093}} A few days later Keegan met Beardsley at Benwell.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2076-2093}} Keegan and his teammates, at first sight, thought Beardsley was just a lad who had won the competition to train with the first team.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2076-2093}} It was only when they seen him in action that they knew he had something about him. At Beardsley's first training session Keegan could not believe his eyes at what a talent he was witnessing.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2076-2093}} Keegan once stated about Beardsley, \"At Scunthorpe I always thought [[Terry Heath]] had the wow factor, because of his skill on the ball, and when I moved to Liverpool I had never seen anyone with [[Peter Thompson (footballer, born 1942)|Peter Thompson]]'s ability. By the time I started playing for Newcastle, however, I had played against Cruyff, [[Maradona]] and [[Pel\u00e9]], and yet I have never had my mind blown as I did on the first day I saw Peter Beardsley.\"{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2076-2093}}\n\nKeegan announced his retirement prior to the end of the [[1983\u201384 in English football|1983\u201384 season]], on the 14 February 1984 - his 33rd birthday.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2137}} Keegan felt his career was finished after a cup game, a month prior, away at Liverpool.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2112-2134}} In this match Keegan was put through on goal from a through ball. This through ball had caught all the defenders flat-footed, left the defenders out of the equation, and left Keegan one on one with the keeper Bruce Grobbelaar.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2112-2134}} Keegan thought this was his moment to put Newcastle 1-0 up in front of the thousands of Newcastle fans behind the goal.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2112-2134}} Keegan who had been in a one on one with the goal keeper many times in training, and in football matches, felt, with his pace, with his experience in this position, it was second nature to finish the move.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2112-2134}} Keegan though was intercepted by the recovering [[Mark Lawrenson]]. As Keegan was moving towards goal with his pace, Lawrenson caught up to Keegan and stole the ball off him from the side. At this precise moment, it occurred to Keegan he had now lost his yard of pace.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2112-2134}} At the end of the game a frustrated Keegan, whilst clapping off the fans, had decided this would be his last season as a footballer.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2112-2134}}\n\nKeegan felt if he had have extended his career at Newcastle in the first division he would have had to adjust his game and move from the attacking role he had built his footballing identity on over the last 15 years of his career.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2137-2142}} Keegan did not want to extend his career by moving back into midfield in the first division with Newcastle.

Keegan who had stated that he would never enter football management, did carry out occasional work as a football pundit for British television.\n\n==International career==\nKeegan made his [[England national football team|England]] debut on 15 November 1972 in a 1\u20130 World Cup qualifying win over [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. Keegan appeared in only the two matches against Wales during this campaign as England failed to qualify for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]].<ref name=ES>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandstats.com/playerreport.php?pid=557|title=Kevin Keegan|accessdate=30 July 2008|publisher=englandstats.com}}</ref>\n\nHe scored his first international goal in his third appearance, also against Wales, on 11 May 1974. He was given the captaincy by manager [[Don Revie]] in 1976 after [[Gerry Francis]] fell victim to a long term injury. He went on to captain England 31 times, retaining the captain's armband until his international retirement after the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]].\n\nKeegan captained England at the [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980 Euros]]. England failed to progress from the group stage after finishing third in their group behind Italy and Belgium.\n\nHe managed only one World Cup appearance though, after England failed to qualify for both the [[1974 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 5|1974]] and [[1978 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 2|1978]] tournaments. He finally reached a [[1982 FIFA World Cup|World Cup in 1982]] when England got to the finals in Spain. He was named in the squad for the tournament, but was suffering from a chronic back injury and was unfit to play in all of England's group games. In a last, desperate effort to play in a World Cup (he knew that he would not be around for the 1986 competition) he secretly hired a car and drove from Spain to a [[medical specialist|specialist]] he knew in Germany for intensive treatment. He recovered sufficiently to appear as a substitute for the last 26 minutes of England's final second-round game against hosts [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. During this time he missed a point-blank header which would have broken the deadlock, in a game England needed to win to progress to the semi-finals. England drew the game 0\u20130 and were eliminated from the competition.\n\nFollowing the successful start to the [[1982\u201383 in English football|1982\u201383 season]] with Newcastle United, there was much controversy when newly appointed England manager [[Bobby Robson]] did not select Keegan for his first squad,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TvFtlOSX_g | title = Match of the 80s \u2013 Season 82\u201383 (Part 1 of 4) | publisher = YouTube | date = 13 July 2007 | accessdate =27 August 2011}}</ref> a decision Keegan learned of from the media rather than Robson himself. Keegan publicly expressed his displeasure at not being given the courtesy of a phone call from Robson, and never played for his country again. He had won a total of 63 [[cap (sport)|caps]] and scored 21 goals.\n\n==Managerial career==\n===Newcastle United===\nOn 5 February 1992, almost eight years after his final game as a player, Keegan returned to football as manager of Newcastle United. They had been relegated from the [[Football League First Division|top flight]] in 1989 and narrowly missed out on promotion in 1990 after losing in the playoffs to arch-rivals [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], but in 1991 they had failed to make the playoffs and at several stages in [[1991\u201392 in English football|1991\u201392]], they had temporarily occupied bottom place in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. Following the dismissal of previous manager [[Ossie Ardiles]], Keegan was appointed to prevent Newcastle from being relegated to the [[Football League Third Division|third tier]] of [[Football in England|English football]] for the first time. Keegan joined a club that still had participants from the old board room battles that had been going on at the club for decades.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} It has been argued the internal struggles from the former regime had held the club back.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} After three or more years trying, John Hall had recently won the board room from the old regime.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} Though John Hall was not yet confirmed as the chairman he had accrued enough power to make the key decisions.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} The board members belonging to the former regime were only told by John Hall, one hour before Keegan\u2019s first press conference that Kevin Keegan would be the manager.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} Keegan had only watched two live matches in seven years. One was the European Cup final in 1991 and the other being a Newcastle United 0-0 draw against Blackburn; as such, calls were made that suggested Keegan was unprepared and inexperienced.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2323-2341}} \n\nWhen Keegan turned up to Benwell for his first training session as manager, he noted the training ground was in a mess. Keegan was surprised at the timely neglect of the training ground facilities.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} The training ground was in the process of being sold, despite this, Keegan paid for the clean up of the training ground with of his own money,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} with the cleaning work being done in one weekend.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} Keegan felt this clean up work was an important move and an indirect statement to the players that conveyed to the players that their professionalism, from now on, had to be high.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} Assessing the squad, Keegan opined that the squad was not good enough to reach the level he and McDermott once played at.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2380-2400}} In five-a-sides he and Terry Mcdermott, both in their 40s, with their lack of conditioning, believed they were two of the stand out players.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2380-2400}} Keegan noted the club had an impressive crop of youth players. This crop included: [[Lee Clark (footballer)|Lee Clark]], [[Steve Watson]], [[Steve Howey (footballer)|Steve Howey]], [[Alan Thompson (footballer, born 1973)|Alan Thompson]] and [[Robbie Elliott]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2380-2400}} These young players would form a core of players involved in Keegan's Newcastle squads from 1992 to 1997.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2380-2400}} Prior to his first game, Keegan made his first tough call with his squad of players when he dropped the midfielder Lee Clark.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2400-2405}} Though he liked Clark's spirit, Keegan believed he was at risk of being sent off.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2400-2405}} Keegan's first game, against Bristol City, ended in 3-0 victory in front of a capacity crowd.\n\nKeegan's managerial guidance in the 1991\u201392 season helped secure survival, which meant Newcastle United would play in the new Division One for the [[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393 season]]. Chairman [[John Hall (businessman)|John Hall]] also promised Keegan millions of pounds to spend on new players after Keegan almost walked out on the club after a match, in the 1991\u201392 season, at home to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] which was played on the 14 March 1992.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Turnbull|first1=Simon|title=Welcome to the North-east...

Newcastle began the season with 11 successive wins and led the league virtually all season, and the club record signing of [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] striker [[Andy Cole]] in February further strengthened their side; Cole netted 12 goals in his first 12 games for the club. The addition of [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]'s [[Rob Lee]] bolstered the midfield in the autumn.\n\nNewcastle were promoted to the Premier League as Division One champions.\n\nTop scorer [[David Kelly (association footballer)|David Kelly]] and influential midfielder [[Gavin Peacock]] were both sold during the close season, and Keegan brought striker [[Peter Beardsley]] back to Newcastle from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], six years after he had been sold by Newcastle to Liverpool.\n\n[[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]] was an enormous success for Newcastle as they finished third in the Premier League and qualified for the UEFA Cup, bringing European football to the club for the first time since the 1970s. Andy Cole was the Premier League's top scorer with 34 goals from 40 games, and managed a club record total of 41 goals in all competitions.\n\nKeegan then strengthened his side by signing [[Switzerland national football team|Swiss]] [[FIFA World Cup 1994|World Cup]] defender [[Marc Hottiger]] and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium's]] defensive midfielder [[Philippe Albert]], while [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]'s quick winger [[Ruel Fox]] had arrived on transfer deadline day in March 1994.\n\nNewcastle won their first six games of the [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395 season]] to top the league and they appeared capable of winning their first league title since 1927. But the shock departure of Andy Cole to Manchester United in January weakened their attack, and finished the season sixth place in the final table; not enough for even another UEFA Cup campaign. In the meantime, autumn signing [[Paul Kitson]] partnered Beardsley in attack.\n\nKeegan made several important additions to the Newcastle side in the summer of 1995: [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] goalkeeper [[Shaka Hislop]], [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]'s French winger [[David Ginola]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] striker [[Les Ferdinand]] and [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] defender [[Warren Barton]]. Ferdinand was Newcastle's biggest signing at \u00a36 million, while the \u00a34 million paid for Barton was the highest fee paid for a defender in English football at the time.\n\nNewcastle excelled in the first half of the [[1995\u201396 in English football|1995\u201396 season]], going ten points ahead on 23 December 1995 and holding a 12-point lead from early in January to 4 February. After a 2\u20130 defeat at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on 21 February, the lead was cut to nine points. A 1\u20130 defeat at the hands of fellow title challengers Manchester United cut the gap to a single point on 4 March, and within two weeks Newcastle's lead was overhauled and they were unable to recover it. Newcastle's [[Liverpool F.C. 4\u20133 Newcastle United F.C. (1996)|4\u20133 defeat]] to Liverpool on 3 April is widely considered<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1300229/Premier-League-games-Ten-greatest.html|title=Ten of the greatest: Premier League games}}</ref> to be one of the classic Premier League games. With two games remaining Newcastle and Manchester United both had 76 points. Newcastle only got one point in a 1\u20131 drawn match against Nottingham Forest on 2 May, and with a 1\u20131 draw for Newcastle against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on the final day of the season on 5 May, the title was won by United, whose 3\u20130 triumph at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] would have won them the title regardless of Newcastle's result against Tottenham. Keegan stated in 2018 that if Newcastle United had won the title in that season, the squad, which included players such as [[Les Ferdinand]], [[Darren Peacock]], [[David Ginola]], [[Peter Beardsley]], [[Faustino Asprilla]] and [[Rob Lee]] would have stayed together, may have built up a momentum, and won more trophies.<ref name=etainers042018>{{cite web | url = https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/we-could-won-couple-more-14476551 | title = 'We could have won a couple more titles' \u2013 Kevin Keegan discusses Newcastle's Entertainers | last = McCormick | first = Sean | date = 2 April 2018 | work = Chronicle | location = Newcastle-upon-Tyne| access-date = 2 April 2018 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the race for the 1995\u201396 title, Keegan directed remarks at the Manchester United manager, [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]], during a post-match interview live on [[Sky Sports]].

A club statement following his resignation read:\n\n<blockquote>Newcastle United Football Club today announce the resignation of manager Kevin Keegan. Kevin informed the board of his wish to resign at the end of the season, having decided he no longer wishes to continue in football management at this stage in his life. Following lengthy discussions of which the board attempted to persuade Kevin to change his mind, both parties eventually agreed that the best route forward was for the club to, reluctantly, accept his resignation with immediate effect.</blockquote>\n\nKeegan left the club with a short statement reading:<blockquote>It was my decision and my decision alone to resign. I feel I have taken the club as far as I can, and that it would be in the best interests of all concerned if I resigned now.

The tribunal ruled in favour of Keegan, agreeing that Newcastle had [[constructive dismissal|constructively dismissed]] him by insisting on the signing of midfielder [[Ignacio Mar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez|Nacho Gonz\u00e1lez]] on loan (which was against his wishes) to replace [[James Milner]] following his move to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and a bid for Bayern Munich's [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]] being rejected.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/incredible-story-newcastle-trying-sign-12813690|title = The incredible story of Newcastle trying to sign Schweinsteiger on the cheap \u2013 and Keegan quitting|first=Mark | last=Douglas |work=Evening Chronicle|date=29 March 2017|accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe ruling<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nufc.com/2009-10html/2009-10-02kk-vs-nufc.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128060800/http://www.nufc.com/2009-10html/2009-10-02kk-vs-nufc.html| archivedate=28 November 2010| title=KK v NUFC \u2013 the verdict|publisher=nufc.com|date=2 October 2009|accessdate=10 August 2014}}</ref> was based around seven issues. The panel declared that Keegan had been misled to believe he had the final decision on player transfers, and was never explicitly told in writing, his contract, or word of mouth that he did not or that his role would see him essentially report to others. Given the generally understood role of a Premiership manager, the panel agreed he could reasonably expect that this was not a factor. The club's signing of Gonz\u00e1lez meant that they had violated his employment contract, which amounted to constructive dismissal. While Gonz\u00e1lez was the main issue in the panel final decision, the club's alleged mistreatment of Keegan, claiming they were in a position to sack him should he have not agreed to the terms they offered him, as well as his decision to remain at the club until the 4 September instead of resigning on 1 September, allowing the club to reach a compromise, led to the panel ruling in Keegan's favour. Keegan was awarded \u00a32&nbsp;million (plus interest accrued) according to severance clauses in his contract, which the club never paid him after his departure. Claims for more were turned down on the basis that the standard contract severance clauses covered constructive dismissal, but he stated afterwards that the purpose of his claim had been to restore his reputation, and was delighted with the outcome, allowing him to move forward.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/8286967.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Keegan wins \u00a32m Newcastle damages | date=2 October 2009 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn pursuit of winning the tribunal, the club admitted to misleading the media and their fans. Several key senior staff, including Dennis Wise and [[Derek Llambias]], had publicly claimed that Keegan had \"the final word\"; they claimed to the tribunal that this was not in fact the case and that their claims were just \"PR\". It was then revealed that Director of Football Dennis Wise asked Keegan to sign Gonz\u00e1lez by watching him \"on [[YouTube]]\". On 21 October, a subsequent meeting of the same panel found that the club should pay all legal and associated costs incurred by Keegan as a result of the tribunal. They reached this conclusion based on their view that the club's \"defence on the primary liability issue was, in our view, wholly without merit\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_5642081,00.html | work=Sky Sports | title=Magpies must pay Keegan costs | date = 21 October 2009 | accessdate =3 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nKeegan stated after the hearing he still wants to manage in the top flight of football, and would consider returning to his position at the club, but feels the fans may be exhausted from his last tenure and would prefer him not to.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_5608630,00.html | work=Sky Sports | title=Keegan wants to manage again | date = 5 October 2009 | accessdate =3 March 2012 | first = Richard | last = Bailey}}</ref> In June 2013, Keegan stated he would only consider a return should owner Mike Ashley leave the club.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/kevin-keegan-labels-return-to-newcastle-as-an-absolute-living-nightmare-8648184.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Kevin Keegan labels return to Newcastle as 'an absolute living nightmare' | date=6 June 2013}}</ref> Keegan has continued to criticise Ashley, accusing him of a lack of respect for the fans.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/newcastle-united-news-kevin-keegan-3492049 | work=Daily Mirror | title=Kevin Keegan slams Newcastle owner Mike Ashley for showing 'a total lack of respect' to supporters | date = 3 May 2014 | accessdate =16 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2009, nearly a year after his departure from Newcastle, Keegan resurfaced after being confirmed as the lead pundit on [[ESPN (UK)|ESPN]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/aug/24/espn-premiership-kevin-keegan | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=ESPN signs Kevin Keegan to front its Premier League coverage | first=Mark | last=Sweney | date=24 August 2009 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> During the course of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], Keegan featured as a pundit for [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] broadcasts.

Rather than delegitimizing these spaces, Danger\u2019s work presents itself in an integrative and communitarian fashion which expands existing spaces, such as those encapsulated in BDSM, or through 2-Spirit Drum Groups, to include marginalized voices in a more authentic fashion. Danger notes that people who don\u2019t conform to typical gender roles can become isolated from their communities, and that \u201cthey have a hard time getting employment, they have a hard time finding housing\u201d amongst other difficulties.

As Danger grew up Catholic, this project explores what women \u201cshould be\u201d doing, and redefines what that looks like: redefining the term \u201cbad girl.\u201d In an interview with The Manitoban, Danger explained \u201cIt made me realize, heck yes, I would love to be a bad girl if it meant I could rise above what society expected of me and what I needed to accomplish.\u201d\n\n==== Sisters (2015) ====\nDanger\u2019s work ''Sisters'' is a photography series depicting themselves and their sister, Michelle, which was taken over two years.<ref name=\":0\" /> Sisters was the first project in which Danger became subject in their own work.

In opening this dialogue, Danger deconstructs tropes of BDSM being limited to non-Indigenous peoples, and, instead, promotes the ability for BDSM to promote the beauty of Indigenous-Queer peoples.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Flagella |first1=Genevieve |title=A Fine Pointed Belonging |url=http://www.modernfuel.org/files/Essay_A%20Fine%20Pointed%20Belonging_March%2013.pdf |website=Modern Fuel}}</ref> This work negotiates the line of power and objectification, while relying on an inherent consent model in BDSM which promotes the positive sexual agency of engaging parties.They explore BDSM and kink specifically through leather and beaded works, \u201cas a space for healing colonial trauma\u201d.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=Http://www.modernfuel.org/files/Essay_A%20Fine%20Pointed%20Belonging_March%2013.pdf|title=A Fine Pointed Belonging|last=Flavelle|first=Gabrielle|date=2019|website=Modern Fuel|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 13, 2020}}</ref> Danger has produced a series of [[Bondage hood|masks]] that resemble BDSM gear but are beaded in a traditional Indigenous style.<ref name=\":3\" /> The practice of beading the masks takes up to 100 hours and was inspired by Danger\u2019s mother who made cultural art as well.<ref name=\":3\" /> The masks represent a form of comfort and a connection to their Indigenous culture and traditions. The masks are also a means of disguising identity and grappling with the existence of agency and consent within a colonial environment.<ref name=\":3\" />\n=== Intersectionalism ===\n\n\tDayna Danger\u2019s work specifically focuses on an element of cultural restoration and expansion of culturally safe spaces by integrating and welcoming in Indigenous-Queer peoples. Such work views the integration of Queer peoples as overcoming a colonially imposed barrier which has limited the acceptance of Indigenous-Queer peoples into certain protocol. In addition to facilitating spaces which are safe to specifically Indigenous-Queer peoples, this work promotes a revitalization and healing of the community by overcoming colonially imposed norms and values which have otherwise ostracized the people Danger advocates and works on behalf of. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Deer |first1=Jessica |title=Montreal gallery strings beadwork from past to now in new exhibition |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/montreal-la-guilde-gallery-beadwork-1.5138228 |website=CBC Indigenous |accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> Danger\u2019s work in beaded fetish masks specifically speaks to this intersectional approach, with Danger commenting that \u201cthere is something so beautiful [about] wearing something that is completely covered in beads on your face\u201d and that \u201cthis is a continuation of how we communicate symbols that are important to us. For me, beadwork speaks to that. It\u2019s a  basic read of what is truly resistance. Before glass beads, we still figured out ways to embellish what we wore. Glass beads just intuitively took that on and made it a part of how we represent ourselves.\u201d <ref>{{cite web |last1=Deer |first1=Jessica |title=Montreal gallery strings beadwork from past to now in new exhibition  Social Sharing |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/montreal-la-guilde-gallery-beadwork-1.5138228 |website=CBC Indigenous}}</ref>\n=== Expanding \"Traditionalism\" and Deconstructing Heteronormativity within Indigenous Communities ===\n\nDanger highlights a reclamation of space for 2SLGBTQQ+ people within traditional spaces which could be constricted due to the colonial implantation of heternormativity and homophobia. Rather than delegitimizing these spaces, Danger\u2019s work presents itself in an integrative and communitarian fashion which expands existing spaces, such as those encapsulated in BDSM, or through 2-Spirit Drum Groups, to include marginalized voices in a more authentic fashion. Danger notes that people who don\u2019t conform to typical gender roles can become isolated from their communities, and that \u201cthey have a hard time getting employment, they have a hard time finding housing\u201d amongst other difficulties. Danger further explains that losing that sense of place \u201cwhere we migrate away from our land, our territories and away from out teachings\u201d puts non-binary people at risk.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Page |first1=Julia |title=Indigenous literature breaks down taboos at Gasp\u00e9 high school |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/indigenous-literature-breaks-down-taboos-at-gasp\u00e9-high-school-1.5067569 |website=CBC Montreal |accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n== Exhibits ==\n\n=== Various exhibits ===\n\n* Urban Shaman, Winnipeg, MB<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Warren G Flowers Art Gallery, Montreal<ref name=\":1\" />\n* dc3 Projects, Edmonton<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Roundhouse Cafe, Vancouver<ref name=\":1\" />\n* New Mexico Museum of Art, Sant'''<span lang=\"EN-CA\"></span>'''a Fe<ref name=\":1\" />\n* ''Disrupt Archives''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lacentrale.org/en/programmation/disrupt-archive-dayna-danger-and-cecilia-kavara-verran/|title=\"Disrupt Archive: Dayna Danger and Cecilia Kavara Verran,\" Programming|last=|first=|date=2016|website=La Centrale Galerie Powerhouse|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====\"Nos Territoires/ Indian Land\u201d====\n'''\u201c'''Nos Territoires / Indian Land\u201d was exhibited September 15, 2018 in Montreal, Quebec, and included several performance pieces by Indigenous artists.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Martel, Richard and Guy Sioui Durand|first=|date=2019|title=Nos Territoires / Indian Land [soir\u00e9e autochtone]|url=|journal=Inter|volume=no. 133|pages=62\u201364|via=}}</ref> Danger wore one of their masks and performed a purification ceremony with traditional herbs.<ref name=\":6\" /> The performance blurred \u201cthe boundaries between performance and ritual art\u201d.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== Sisters ====\n\u201cSisters\u201d was exhibited May 8 to July 4, 2015 at Artspace in Peterborough, Ontario.<ref name=\":0\" /> It exhibited Danger\u2019s \u201cSisters\u201d photography series during their first solo exhibit.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Big\u2019Uns ====\n\u201cBig \u2019Uns\u201d was exhibited June 9 to July 22, 2017 at Latitude 53 in Edmonton, Alberta.<ref name=\":5\" /> It was the second solo exhibit, featuring Danger\u2019s Big \u2019Uns photography series.

According to V.A. Smith,<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Early History of India|last=Smith|first=Vincent|publisher=Atlantic Publishers|year=1970|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Ashoka actually became a Buddhist monk for a short span of his life.

Bhandarkar <ref>{{Cite book|title=Asoka|last=Bhandarkar|first=Devadatta|publisher=Asian Educational Services|year=1925|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> claims that Ashoka was a Buddhist and his policy of dhamma was actually original Buddhism as preached by the Budhha. Radha Kumud Mookerji also formulates that as far as the personal religion of Ashoka is concerned, it may be taken as Buddhism.\n\n== Historical background ==\n[[File:Maurya Dynasty in 265 BCE.jpg|thumb|right|[[Maurya Empire]] at the age of Ashoka. The empire stretched from Afghanistan to Bangladesh/[[Assam]] and from Central Asia (Afghanistan) to [[South India]].]]\n\n=== Socio-economic conditions ===\n\nThe Mauryan period saw a change in the economic structure of the society. The use of iron resulted in surplus production, and the economy changed from being a simple, [[rural economy]] to a pattern of economy in which urban centres became important. It has been generally argued{{by whom|date=November 2013}} that the use of the Northern Black Polished Ware pottery is an indicator of material prosperity in the period. The use of [[Punch (combat)|Punch]]-marked silver coins and some other varieties of coins, the conscious intervention of the State to safeguard trade routes and the rise of urban centers point to a structural change in the economy, requiring adjustments in the society. The commercial classes had come to the forefront of society. The emergence of [[urban culture]] demanded a flexible social organization. The incorporation of tribes and peoples from the outlying areas into the social fabric also presented a problem.<ref name=\"google747\">{{cite book|title=Dharma: Its Early History in Law, Religion, and Narrative South Asia Research|publisher=Oxford University Press|year= 2011|isbn=9780195394238|page=747|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SVVnUdGJEaIC&pg|first=Alf|last= Hiltebeitel|authorlink=Alf Hiltebeitel|accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"google189\">{{cite book|title=Mauryan India Volume 4 of People's history of India|year=2005|publisher=Tulika|isbn=9788185229935|page=189|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjBJAAAACAAJ&dq|first1=Irfan|last1= Habib|first2= Vivekanand|last2= Jha|edition=2|accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe response of the Brahmanical social order, which was based on the four-fold varna division, was to make the [[Caste|caste system]] more rigid and deny a higher status to the commercial class. The rigidity of the Brahmanical class system sharpened the divisions within the society. The lower orders turned to various [[heterodox]] sects and this created social tensions. It was this situation which emperor Ashoka inherited when he ascended the Mauryan throne.<ref name=\"google189\"/>\n\n=== Religious conditions ===\n\nThe Brahmanical hold over society, assiduously built through the later [[Vedic]] period, was coming under increasing attack. The privileges of the priests, the rigidity of the caste system and the elaborate rituals were being questioned. The lower orders among the four sects began to favour new sects. The vaishyas, who were technically included in the higher social category, were treated as inferior to both [[Brahmans]] and [[Kshatriya]]. The opposition of the commercial class to Brahmanism was to give a fillip to the other sects of the society.<ref name=\"google747\"/><ref name=\"google189\"/> [[Buddhism]] began as schismatic [[Social movement|movement]] from the more [[Orthodox Hinduism|orthodox]] outlook of Brahmanism. Its basic tenet was an emphasis on misery and advocacy of the middle path. It was a set of ethical principles. Buddhism opposed the dominance of the Brahmans and the concept of sacrifices and rituals. It thus appealed to lower social orders and to emerging social classes. The human approach to relations in society preached by Buddhism further attracted different sections to itself.<ref name=\"google189\"/><ref name=\"Our pasts-1\">{{cite book|title=Our pasts-1|publisher=N.C.E.R.T|isbn=8174504931|page=80|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/14121431/NCERT-Book-Our-Pasts-1-Class-VI|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414214807/https://www.scribd.com/doc/14121431/NCERT-Book-Our-Pasts-1-Class-VI|archivedate=14 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=What was Ashoka's Dhamma|url=http://www.ncert.nic.in/NCERTS/l/fess108.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=NCERT|accessdate=1 September 2013|page=6|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930232533/http://www.ncert.nic.in/NCERTS/l/fess108.pdf|archivedate=30 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"books.google\">{{cite book|title=The Pearson Indian History Manual for the UPSC Civil Services Preliminary Examination|publisher=DORLING KINDERSLEY (RS)|isbn=9788131717530|pages=A125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wsiXwh_tIGkC&dq|last=Singh|edition=Second}}</ref>\n\n=== Polity ===\n\nThe [[Mahajanapada]] of sixth century B.C. marked the beginning of the [[Nation state|state]] system in many parts of India. Only a small section of society came to have a monopoly of power, which they exercised over the rest of the society. There were ''gana-samghas'' in which the rulers were a group of hereditary [[Kshatriya]] or members of a clan. By the time Ashoka ascended the throne, the state system had grown very elaborate.<ref name=\"google747\"/><ref name=\"google189\"/> It was characterized by:\n\n*The political supremacy of one region ([[Magadha]]) over a vast territory which comprised many previous kingdoms, ''gana-samghas'', and areas where no organised states had previously existed;\n*Existence within this vast territory of geographical regions, cultural areas, and of different faiths, beliefs and practices;\n*Monopoly of force by a ruling class of which the emperor was the supreme head.\n*Appropriation of a very substantial quantity of surpluses from agriculture, commerce and other sources.\n\nThe complexity of the state system demanded an imaginative policy from the emperor which required minimal use of force in such a large empire having diverse forms of economy and religions. It could not have been controlled by an army alone. A more feasible alternative was the propagation of a policy that would work at an ideological level and reach out to all sections of the society. The policy of ''Dharma'' was such an endeavour.<ref name=\"google189\"/><ref name=\"Our pasts-1\"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Man and His Destiny: The Release of the Human Mind : a Study of Citta in Relation to Dhamma in Some Ancient Indian Texts|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=9789004078789|pages=124\u2013125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hCUVAAAAIAAJ&pg|first=Jan T. |last=Ergardt|year=1986}}</ref>\n\n== Distribution of inscriptions ==\n{{main|Edicts of Ashoka}}\n[[File:EdictsOfAshoka.jpg|thumb|Distribution of the Edicts of Ashoka<ref>Reference: \"India: The Ancient Past\" p.113, Burjor Avari, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-35615-6}}</ref>]]\n\nAshoka expounded his policy of ''Dhamma'' through his edicts.<ref>{{cite book|title=General Studies History 4 Upsc|year=2005|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9780070604476|page=A-47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yWfeU9eQd5YC&pg=SL1-PA46&dq|last=Reddy|accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref> By engraving his views about ''Dhamma'' on these edicts, Ashoka tried to directly communicate with his subjects.<ref name=\"google44\">{{cite book|title=Social Science|publisher=VK Publications|isbn=9788179732144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xKEQxEtNR-AC&pg|first=Avnindra Kumar |last=Verma|pages=44\u201345|accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref> These inscriptions were written in different years of his life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Explain principles of Dhamma in the light of edicts and causes of its failure.

These edicts are proclamations to the public at large. They explain the idea of Dhamma. One must make a distinction between Ashoka's policy of Dhamma which stressed social responsibility and Ashoka's own commitment as a Buddhist. There has been a tendency in the past among historians to study the policy of Dhamma and Ashoka as Buddhist in the same context without making any distinction. An examination of the inscriptions suggests that Ashoka declared his personal association with a Buddhist order and on the other he tried to teach, through the policy of Dhamma, the importance of social responsibility and tolerance amongst different members of the society.<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education India, 2009|isbn=9788131711200|pages=326, 327|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&dq|author=Upinder Singh}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Mauryas Revisited|year=1987|publisher=Centre for Studies in Social Sciences|isbn=9788170740216|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=Qg0hUubUB9HjrAfuyYCYDA&id|author=Romila Thapar|accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Dhamma causes ==\n\nThe policy of Dhamma was an earnest attempt at solving some of problems and tensions faced by a complex society.<ref>{{cite book|title=Spreading the Dhamma: Writing, Orality, And Textual Transmission in Buddhist Northern Thailand|year=2006|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=9780824830243|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RXDJTgKlf3MC&pg|author=Daniel M.

Dhamma was not given any formal definition or structure.

A hundred and fifty thousand people were deported, a hundred thousand were killed and many times that number perished. Afterwards, now that Kalinga was annexed, the Beloved of the Gods very earnestly practised \"Dhamma\", desired \"Dhamma\". On conquering Kalinga the Beloved of the Gods felt remorse, for, when an independent country is conquered the slaughter, death, and deportation of people in extremely grievous to the Beloved of the Gods, and weighs heavily on his mind. What is even more deplorable to the Beloved to the Gods is that those who dwell there, whether Brahmans, Sarmanas, or those of other sects, or householders who show obedience to their superiors, obedience to their mother and father, obedience to their teachers and behave well and devotedly to their friends, acquiescence, colleagues, relatives, slaves and servants\u2014all suffer violence, murder and separation from their loved ones. Even those who are fortunate to have escaped, and whose love is undiminished (by the ''brutalizing'' effect of war), suffer from the misfortunes of their friends, acquaintances colleagues and relatives. This participation of all men in suffering weighs heavily on the mind of Beloved of the Gods. Except among the Greeks, there is no land where religious orders of Brahmans and Sarmanas are not to be found, and there is no land anywhere where men do not support one sect or another. Today, if a hundredth or thousandth part of those people who were killed or died or were deported when Kalinga was annexed were to suffer similarly, it would weighs heavily on the mind of the Beloved of the Gods.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Edicts of Ashoka|year=1978|publisher=University of Chicago Press, 1978|isbn=9780226586113|pages=1\u201368|author=A\u015boka (King of Magadha)|edition=illustrated, reprint|editor=N.

This kind of thinking is based on some Buddhist chronicles. It is believed{{by whom|date=November 2013}} that the Kalinga war was a dramatic turning point where out of remorse for the death and destruction of war, Ashoka decided to become Buddhist.

It was not anti-Brahmanical because respect for the Brahmans and Sarmanas is an integral part of his Dhamma. His emphasis on non-violence did not blind him to the needs of the state. He warned the forest tribes that although he hates to use coercion, he may be required to resort to force if they continued to create trouble. By the time Ashoka stopped war, the entire Indian sub-continent was under his control. In the south he was on friendly terms with the [[Cholas]] and [[Pandyas]]. Sri Lanka was an admiring ally. Thus, Ashoka's decline of war came when his empire had reached its natural boundaries. The plea for tolerance was a wise course of action in an ethnically diverse, religiously varied, and class divided society. Ashoka's empire was a conglomerate of diverse groups; farmers, pastoral nomads and hunter-gatherers, there were Greeks, Kambojas, and Bhojas and hundreds of groups with different traditions. In this situation a plea for tolerance was needed. Ashoka tried to transcend the parochial cultural traditions with a board set of ethical principles.<ref name=\"Preface 4\">{{cite book|title=A History of India|year=1990|publisher=Penguin UK, 1990|isbn=9780141949765|page=384|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Y02AiEu1kcC&dq|author=Romila Thapar}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300|year=2004|publisher=University of California Press, 2004|isbn=9780520242258|pages=200\u2013204|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5irrXX0apQC&dq|author=Romila Thapar|edition=illustrated, reprint}}</ref>\n\nAshoka's \"Dhamma\" could not survive him; as such it was a failure.

The empire stretched from Afghanistan to Bangladesh/[[Assam]] and from Central Asia (Afghanistan) to [[South India]].]]\n\n=== Socio-economic conditions ===\n\nThe Mauryan period saw a change in the economic structure of the society. The use of iron resulted in surplus production, and the economy changed from being a simple, [[rural economy]] to a pattern of economy in which urban centres became important. It has been generally argued{{by whom|date=November 2013}} that the use of the Northern Black Polished Ware pottery is an indicator of material prosperity in the period. The use of [[Punch (combat)|Punch]]-marked silver coins and some other varieties of coins, the conscious intervention of the State to safeguard trade routes and the rise of urban centers point to a structural change in the economy, requiring adjustments in the society. The commercial classes had come to the forefront of society. The emergence of [[urban culture]] demanded a flexible social organization. The incorporation of tribes and peoples from the outlying areas into the social fabric also presented a problem.<ref name=\"google747\">{{cite book|title=Dharma: Its Early History in Law, Religion, and Narrative South Asia Research|publisher=Oxford University Press|year= 2011|isbn=9780195394238|page=747|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SVVnUdGJEaIC&pg|first=Alf|last= Hiltebeitel|authorlink=Alf Hiltebeitel|accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"google189\">{{cite book|title=Mauryan India Volume 4 of People's history of India|year=2005|publisher=Tulika|isbn=9788185229935|page=189|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjBJAAAACAAJ&dq|first1=Irfan|last1= Habib|first2= Vivekanand|last2= Jha|edition=2|accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe response of the Brahmanical social order, which was based on the four-fold varna division, was to make the [[Caste|caste system]] more rigid and deny a higher status to the commercial class. The rigidity of the Brahmanical class system sharpened the divisions within the society. The lower orders turned to various [[heterodox]] sects and this created social tensions. It was this situation which emperor Ashoka inherited when he ascended the Mauryan throne.<ref name=\"google189\"/>\n\n=== Religious conditions ===\n\nThe Brahmanical hold over society, assiduously built through the later [[Vedic]] period, was coming under increasing attack. The privileges of the priests, the rigidity of the caste system and the elaborate rituals were being questioned. The lower orders among the four sects began to favour new sects. The vaishyas, who were technically included in the higher social category, were treated as inferior to both [[Brahmans]] and [[Kshatriya]]. The opposition of the commercial class to Brahmanism was to give a fillip to the other sects of the society.<ref name=\"google747\"/><ref name=\"google189\"/> [[Buddhism]] began as schismatic [[Social movement|movement]] from the more [[Orthodox Hinduism|orthodox]] outlook of Brahmanism. Its basic tenet was an emphasis on misery and advocacy of the middle path. It was a set of ethical principles. Buddhism opposed the dominance of the Brahmans and the concept of sacrifices and rituals. It thus appealed to lower social orders and to emerging social classes. The human approach to relations in society preached by Buddhism further attracted different sections to itself.<ref name=\"google189\"/><ref name=\"Our pasts-1\">{{cite book|title=Our pasts-1|publisher=N.C.E.R.T|isbn=8174504931|page=80|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/14121431/NCERT-Book-Our-Pasts-1-Class-VI|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414214807/https://www.scribd.com/doc/14121431/NCERT-Book-Our-Pasts-1-Class-VI|archivedate=14 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=What was Ashoka's Dhamma|url=http://www.ncert.nic.in/NCERTS/l/fess108.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=NCERT|accessdate=1 September 2013|page=6|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930232533/http://www.ncert.nic.in/NCERTS/l/fess108.pdf|archivedate=30 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"books.google\">{{cite book|title=The Pearson Indian History Manual for the UPSC Civil Services Preliminary Examination|publisher=DORLING KINDERSLEY (RS)|isbn=9788131717530|pages=A125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wsiXwh_tIGkC&dq|last=Singh|edition=Second}}</ref>\n\n=== Polity ===\n\nThe [[Mahajanapada]] of sixth century B.C. marked the beginning of the [[Nation state|state]] system in many parts of India. Only a small section of society came to have a monopoly of power, which they exercised over the rest of the society. There were ''gana-samghas'' in which the rulers were a group of hereditary [[Kshatriya]] or members of a clan. By the time Ashoka ascended the throne, the state system had grown very elaborate.<ref name=\"google747\"/><ref name=\"google189\"/> It was characterized by:\n\n*The political supremacy of one region ([[Magadha]]) over a vast territory which comprised many previous kingdoms, ''gana-samghas'', and areas where no organised states had previously existed;\n*Existence within this vast territory of geographical regions, cultural areas, and of different faiths, beliefs and practices;\n*Monopoly of force by a ruling class of which the emperor was the supreme head.\n*Appropriation of a very substantial quantity of surpluses from agriculture, commerce and other sources.\n\nThe complexity of the state system demanded an imaginative policy from the emperor which required minimal use of force in such a large empire having diverse forms of economy and religions. It could not have been controlled by an army alone. A more feasible alternative was the propagation of a policy that would work at an ideological level and reach out to all sections of the society.

These edicts are proclamations to the public at large. They explain the idea of Dhamma. One must make a distinction between Ashoka's policy of Dhamma which stressed social responsibility and Ashoka's own commitment as a Buddhist. There has been a tendency in the past among historians to study the policy of Dhamma and Ashoka as Buddhist in the same context without making any distinction. An examination of the inscriptions suggests that Ashoka declared his personal association with a Buddhist order and on the other he tried to teach, through the policy of Dhamma, the importance of social responsibility and tolerance amongst different members of the society.<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education India, 2009|isbn=9788131711200|pages=326, 327|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&dq|author=Upinder Singh}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Mauryas Revisited|year=1987|publisher=Centre for Studies in Social Sciences|isbn=9788170740216|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=Qg0hUubUB9HjrAfuyYCYDA&id|author=Romila Thapar|accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Dhamma causes ==\n\nThe policy of Dhamma was an earnest attempt at solving some of problems and tensions faced by a complex society.<ref>{{cite book|title=Spreading the Dhamma: Writing, Orality, And Textual Transmission in Buddhist Northern Thailand|year=2006|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=9780824830243|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RXDJTgKlf3MC&pg|author=Daniel M.

A hundred and fifty thousand people were deported, a hundred thousand were killed and many times that number perished. Afterwards, now that Kalinga was annexed, the Beloved of the Gods very earnestly practised \"Dhamma\", desired \"Dhamma\". On conquering Kalinga the Beloved of the Gods felt remorse, for, when an independent country is conquered the slaughter, death, and deportation of people in extremely grievous to the Beloved of the Gods, and weighs heavily on his mind. What is even more deplorable to the Beloved to the Gods is that those who dwell there, whether Brahmans, Sarmanas, or those of other sects, or householders who show obedience to their superiors, obedience to their mother and father, obedience to their teachers and behave well and devotedly to their friends, acquiescence, colleagues, relatives, slaves and servants\u2014all suffer violence, murder and separation from their loved ones. Even those who are fortunate to have escaped, and whose love is undiminished (by the ''brutalizing'' effect of war), suffer from the misfortunes of their friends, acquaintances colleagues and relatives. This participation of all men in suffering weighs heavily on the mind of Beloved of the Gods. Except among the Greeks, there is no land where religious orders of Brahmans and Sarmanas are not to be found, and there is no land anywhere where men do not support one sect or another. Today, if a hundredth or thousandth part of those people who were killed or died or were deported when Kalinga was annexed were to suffer similarly, it would weighs heavily on the mind of the Beloved of the Gods.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Edicts of Ashoka|year=1978|publisher=University of Chicago Press, 1978|isbn=9780226586113|pages=1\u201368|author=A\u015boka (King of Magadha)|edition=illustrated, reprint|editor=N.

Since he wanted to conquer the world through love and faith, he sent many missions to propagate Dhamma. Such missions were sent to far off places like Egypt, Greece and Sri Lanka. The propagation of Dhamma included many measures of people's welfare. Centers of the treatment of men and beasts founded inside and outside of empire. Shady groves, wells, orchards and rest houses were laid out. This kind of charity work was a radically different attitude from the king of the Arthashastra, who would not incur any expenses unless they brought more revenues in return.<ref>{{cite book|title=Indian History|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9780071329231|page=A-185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X4j7Nf_MU24C&pg|accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nAshoka also prohibited useless sacrifices and certain forms of gatherings which led to waste, indiscipline and superstition.<ref name=\"google1989\"/> To implement these policies he recruited a new cadre of officers called Dhammamahamattas.

Many convicts{{mdash}}who were kept in fetters after their sentence had expired{{mdash}}were to be released. Those sentenced to death were to given grace for three days. Ashoka also started Dhamma yatras. He and his high officials were to tour the country propagating Dhamma and establishing direct contact with his subjects.

It has also been suggested{{by whom|date=November 2013}} that it was the original Buddhist thought that was being preached by Ashoka as Dhamma and later on certain theological additions were made to Buddhism. This kind of thinking is based on some Buddhist chronicles. It is believed{{by whom|date=November 2013}} that the Kalinga war was a dramatic turning point where out of remorse for the death and destruction of war, Ashoka decided to become Buddhist. The Buddhist records credit him with the propagation of Buddhism in India and abroad.

It was not anti-Brahmanical because respect for the Brahmans and Sarmanas is an integral part of his Dhamma. His emphasis on non-violence did not blind him to the needs of the state. He warned the forest tribes that although he hates to use coercion, he may be required to resort to force if they continued to create trouble. By the time Ashoka stopped war, the entire Indian sub-continent was under his control. In the south he was on friendly terms with the [[Cholas]] and [[Pandyas]]. Sri Lanka was an admiring ally. Thus, Ashoka's decline of war came when his empire had reached its natural boundaries. The plea for tolerance was a wise course of action in an ethnically diverse, religiously varied, and class divided society. Ashoka's empire was a conglomerate of diverse groups; farmers, pastoral nomads and hunter-gatherers, there were Greeks, Kambojas, and Bhojas and hundreds of groups with different traditions. In this situation a plea for tolerance was needed. Ashoka tried to transcend the parochial cultural traditions with a board set of ethical principles.<ref name=\"Preface 4\">{{cite book|title=A History of India|year=1990|publisher=Penguin UK, 1990|isbn=9780141949765|page=384|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Y02AiEu1kcC&dq|author=Romila Thapar}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300|year=2004|publisher=University of California Press, 2004|isbn=9780520242258|pages=200\u2013204|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5irrXX0apQC&dq|author=Romila Thapar|edition=illustrated, reprint}}</ref>\n\nAshoka's \"Dhamma\" could not survive him; as such it was a failure.

[[Let's Play]] videos and comedic formatted shows. Kjellberg's channel was the [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|most-subscribed channel on YouTube]] for more than five years from 2013 to 2019.\n\nAfter registering his eponymous YouTube channel in 2010, Kjellberg primarily posted Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year.

Due to this popularity, his coverage of [[indie game]]s has created an [[Oprah effect]], boosting sales for titles he plays.

Released under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), it is [[free software]].\n\nBack In Time uses [[rsync]] as backend and has the characteristic feature of using [[hard link]]s for files which are identical in snapshots at different times, thus using disk space just once for files that remained unchanged. It is possible to use several backup profiles, e.g. for backups on different hard disks and also to create schedules. [[Symbolic link]]s can be backed up, both absolute and relative ones, but hard links cannot be treated as such due to the used backup method. Back In Time also supports encryption of backups and backup over [[SSH]].\n\nAdvantages of the hard link method are that it is easy to look at snapshots of the system at different times and also easy to remove old snapshots compared to incremental backup methods which save difference information between consecutive backup times. However, a drawback of Back In Time is that it does not allow for compression, and requires file systems that support hard links on the backup location.\n\n== User interface ==\nThere is a graphical interface written in [[Qt (software)|Qt]].\n\n==See also==\n*The standard backup tool of [[Mac OS X]], [[Time Machine (OS X)|Time Machine]], works on the same principles.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[http://www.ubuntugeek.com/back-in-time-a-simple-backup-tool-for-ubuntu.html Back In Time \u2013 A Simple backup tool for ubuntu]\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://github.com/bit-team/backintime Back In Time code hosting]\n\n[[Category:Free backup software]]\n[[Category:Backup software for Linux]]\n[[Category:Software that uses Qt]]\n[[Category:Linux-only software]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox software\n| name                   = \n| title                  = Back In Time\n| logo                   = <!-- Image name is enough -->\n| logo caption           = \n| logo_size              = \n| logo_alt               = \n| screenshot             = <!-- Image name is enough -->\n| caption                = \n| screenshot_size        = \n| screenshot_alt         = \n| collapsible            = \n| author                 = Oprea Dan, Bart de Koning, Richard Bailey, Germar Reitze, Taylor Raack\n| developer              = \n| released               = {{Start date and age|2008|df=yes}}\n| discontinued           = \n| latest release version = 1.2.1\n| latest release date    = {{Start date and age|2019|08|25|df=yes}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Releases |url=https://github.com/bit-team/backintime/releases |website=Github |accessdate=3 September 2019}}</ref>\n| latest preview version =\n| latest preview date    = <!-- {{Start date and age|2017|03|06|df=yes}} -->\n| programming language   = [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Qt (software)|Qt]] (GUI)\n| operating system       = [[Linux]]\n| platform               = \n| size                   = \n| language               = English, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish\n| language count         = 12+\n| language footnote      = <ref>{{cite web |title=Translations for Back In Time |url=https://translations.launchpad.net/backintime/trunk/+pots/back-in-time |website=translations.launchpad.net |accessdate=3 September 2019}}</ref>\n| genre                  = [[Backup software]]\n| license                = [[GPL#Version_2|GPLv2]]\n| website                = {{URL|https://github.com/bit-team/backintime}}\n}}\n'''Back In Time''' is a backup application for [[Linux]].
