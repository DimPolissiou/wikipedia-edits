It was built from scratch in the late 1930s, in the forests surrounding the village of P\u0142awo. The city was designed to be a settlement for workers of [[Huta Stalowa Wola]] (known in 1938-39 as ''Zak\u0142ady Poludniowe'' or ''Southern Works''), a plant built as part of the [[Central Industrial Region (Poland)|Central Industrial Region]]. Stalowa Wola is home to the sports club [[Stal Stalowa Wola]].\n[[File:Stalowa Wola, ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 \u015bw.

On January 1, 2010, the area of the town was {{convert|82|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} and 60% of Stalowa Wola was covered by pine forests, remnants of the once enormous [[Sandomierz Forest]]. The name of the town (Stalowa Wola can be translated into English as \u201csteel will\u201d) comes from words of General [[Tadeusz Kasprzycki]], [[Minister of Military Affairs of Poland]], who stated in the late 1930s that the [[Central Industrial Area]] symbolizes the ''steel will of the Polish nation to modernize itself''.\n\n==History==\nThe area of today's Stalowa Wola belongs to historic Polish province of [[Lesser Poland]]. In the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]], it was located in south-eastern corner of the [[Sandomierz Voivodeship]], near the border with [[Red Ruthenia]]. The city of Stalowa Wola was built on the site where the village of P\u0142awo once stood, between the ancient towns of [[Nisko]] and [[Rozwad\u00f3w]]. The first mentions of P\u0142awo come from the first half of the 15th century. At the nearby village of Przysz\u00f3w, there was a hunting lodge of King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Jagie\u0142\u0142o]], built before 1358. In the late 15th century, P\u0142awo was a royal village. In 1656, the area of P\u0142awo was the site of a battle between Polish and Swedish armies. Here, in the confluence of the San and [[Vistula]], Swedish troops of King [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|Charles Gustav]] were surrounded by [[Stefan Czarniecki]] (see [[Deluge (history)|Swedish invasion of Poland]]).\n\nUntil the [[Partitions of Poland]], P\u0142awo belonged to [[Sandomierz Voivodeship]]. From 1772 to 1918, it was part of the Austrian province of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and remained an insignificant, privately owned village. In early 1937, the government of the [[Second Polish Republic]] accepted the project of the [[Central Industrial Area]], which included construction of a [[Huta Stalowa Wola|brand new steel mill]], together with a settlement for the workers. Before the outbreak of [[World War II]], some departments of the mill were operational and several blocks of flats were built. Construction of the ''Southern Works'', as the mill was then called, was started in dense pine forests around P\u0142awo in March 1937. Among other things, the plant manufactured artillery cannons.\n\nDuring World War II, Stalowa Wola was one of the centres of the [[Home Army]]. The settlement was captured by the [[Red Army]] in August 1944, and on April 1, 1945, Stalowa Wola received its town charter. In 1948, the mill was renamed as ''Huta Stalowa Wola'' and in 1953, a separate urban county of Stalowa Wola was created. In 1973, the town of Rozwad\u00f3w was annexed, followed in 1977 by the village of Charzewice. At its peak in the 1970s, the mill employed 35,000 people, with branches scattered across southern Poland, from [[Radomsko]] to [[Strzy\u017c\u00f3w]]. Apart from the mill, Stalowa Wola has a large power plant, opened Spring 1939. In 1988, the city was one of the centres of workers' protests (see [[1988 Polish strikes]]). Currently, Stalowa Wola is the third city of the province, with population of 115,000.\n\n== Jews in Rozwad\u00f3w (a district of Stalowa Wola) ==\nThe [[Rozwad\u00f3w]] suburb of Stalowa Wola was a thriving [[Jew]]ish [[shtetl]] prior to [[World War II]] and was closely associated with [[Tarnobrzeg]] and other nearby shtetls including [[Ulan\u00f3w]], [[Mielec]], [[Tarnobrzeg|Dzik\u00f3w]] etc. These communities, infused with vitality before 1939, were utterly destroyed during [[the Holocaust]] after having been affected by World War I only some 20 years earlier. [[Jew]]s in Rozwad\u00f3w were a religiously observant community, i.e. traditional or [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] in practice. The leading [[rabbi]] of Rozwad\u00f3w, similar to other rabbis of the region, followed [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]] practice and was of the Horowitz family. In New York, a Rozwadower Rebbe established a small synagogue on the [[upper West Side]], which continued for many decades after the war. There is a link to a [[Bereavement in Judaism|yizkor]] book about Rozwad\u00f3w which gives further notes on the Jewish life there. The Rozwad\u00f3w [[synagogue]] was, until [[World War II]], located on Attorney Street in the [[Lower East Side|lower east side of NYC]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], [[Eugene Lazowski|Dr. Eugene Lazowski]], a military doctor of the [[Polish Underground State|Polish underground]] [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]], [[Armia Krajowa]], created a fake epidemic of dangerous [[infectious disease]], [[Typhus|Epidemic Typhus]] in the town of [[Rozwad\u00f3w]] (now a district of Stalowa Wola) and the surrounding villages and towns. He saved an estimated 8,000 [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] from certain death in [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Internment|concentration camp]]s during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], performing his services in utmost secrecy under the threat of capital punishment.<ref>{{in lang|pl}} Andrzej Pity\u00f1ski, Museum of Stalowa Wola, [http://www.muzeum.stalowawola.pl/amerykanska_wspolpraca/wspolpraca/lazowski.htm Short biography of Eugeniusz \u0141azowski] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111195534/http://www.muzeum.stalowawola.pl/amerykanska_wspolpraca/wspolpraca/lazowski.htm |date=2007-11-11 }}</ref><ref>[http://stjoenj.net/lazowski/lazowski.html He duped Nazis, saved thousands]</ref><ref>[http://holocaustforgotten.com/eugene.htm Fake Epidemic Saves a Village from Nazis]</ref><ref>[http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2004/07/05/prsb0705.htm 2 doctors used typhus to save thousands in wartime]</ref><ref>Paula Davenport, Media & Communication Resources, [[Southern Illinois University]], [http://www.siu.edu/~perspect/01_fall/documentary.html Life Preserver] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070605085937/http://www.siu.edu/~perspect/01_fall/documentary.html |date=2007-06-05 }}</ref><ref>Yad Vashem, The Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority, [http://www1.yadvashem.org/righteous_new/statistics.html Righteous Among the Nations \u2013 per Country & Ethnic Origin January 1, 2009.

This was to be a group of factories built in an area in the middle of the country, away from the borders with [[Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. It was designed to provide a reasonably secure location for the production of armaments and [[high tech]]nology goods.<ref name=\"Stalowa\"/> The main employer is still HSW S.A.

It was built from scratch in the late 1930s, in the forests surrounding the village of P\u0142awo. The city was designed to be a settlement for workers of [[Huta Stalowa Wola]] (known in 1938-39 as ''Zak\u0142ady Poludniowe'' or ''Southern Works''), a plant built as part of the [[Central Industrial Region (Poland)|Central Industrial Region]]. Stalowa Wola is home to the sports club [[Stal Stalowa Wola]].\n[[File:Stalowa Wola, ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 \u015bw.

On January 1, 2010, the area of the town was {{convert|82|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} and 60% of Stalowa Wola was covered by pine forests, remnants of the once enormous [[Sandomierz Forest]]. The name of the town (Stalowa Wola can be translated into English as \u201csteel will\u201d) comes from words of General [[Tadeusz Kasprzycki]], [[Minister of Military Affairs of Poland]], who stated in the late 1930s that the [[Central Industrial Area]] symbolizes the ''steel will of the Polish nation to modernize itself''.\n\n==History==\nThe area of today's Stalowa Wola belongs to historic Polish province of [[Lesser Poland]]. In the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]], it was located in south-eastern corner of the [[Sandomierz Voivodeship]], near the border with [[Red Ruthenia]]. The city of Stalowa Wola was built on the site where the village of P\u0142awo once stood, between the ancient towns of [[Nisko]] and [[Rozwad\u00f3w]]. The first mentions of P\u0142awo come from the first half of the 15th century. At the nearby village of Przysz\u00f3w, there was a hunting lodge of King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Jagie\u0142\u0142o]], built before 1358. In the late 15th century, P\u0142awo was a royal village. In 1656, the area of P\u0142awo was the site of a battle between Polish and Swedish armies. Here, in the confluence of the San and [[Vistula]], Swedish troops of King [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|Charles Gustav]] were surrounded by [[Stefan Czarniecki]] (see [[Deluge (history)|Swedish invasion of Poland]]).\n\nUntil the [[Partitions of Poland]], P\u0142awo belonged to [[Sandomierz Voivodeship]]. From 1772 to 1918, it was part of the Austrian province of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and remained an insignificant, privately owned village. In early 1937, the government of the [[Second Polish Republic]] accepted the project of the [[Central Industrial Area]], which included construction of a [[Huta Stalowa Wola|brand new steel mill]], together with a settlement for the workers. Before the outbreak of [[World War II]], some departments of the mill were operational and several blocks of flats were built. Construction of the ''Southern Works'', as the mill was then called, was started in dense pine forests around P\u0142awo in March 1937. Among other things, the plant manufactured artillery cannons.\n\nDuring World War II, Stalowa Wola was one of the centres of the [[Home Army]]. The settlement was captured by the [[Red Army]] in August 1944, and on April 1, 1945, Stalowa Wola received its town charter. In 1948, the mill was renamed as ''Huta Stalowa Wola'' and in 1953, a separate urban county of Stalowa Wola was created. In 1973, the town of Rozwad\u00f3w was annexed, followed in 1977 by the village of Charzewice. At its peak in the 1970s, the mill employed 35,000 people, with branches scattered across southern Poland, from [[Radomsko]] to [[Strzy\u017c\u00f3w]]. Apart from the mill, Stalowa Wola has a large power plant, opened Spring 1939. In 1988, the city was one of the centres of workers' protests (see [[1988 Polish strikes]]). Currently, Stalowa Wola is the third city of the province, with population of 115,000.\n\n== Jews in Rozwad\u00f3w (a district of Stalowa Wola) ==\nThe [[Rozwad\u00f3w]] suburb of Stalowa Wola was a thriving [[Jew]]ish [[shtetl]] prior to [[World War II]] and was closely associated with [[Tarnobrzeg]] and other nearby shtetls including [[Ulan\u00f3w]], [[Mielec]], [[Tarnobrzeg|Dzik\u00f3w]] etc. These communities, infused with vitality before 1939, were utterly destroyed during [[the Holocaust]] after having been affected by World War I only some 20 years earlier. [[Jew]]s in Rozwad\u00f3w were a religiously observant community, i.e. traditional or [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] in practice. The leading [[rabbi]] of Rozwad\u00f3w, similar to other rabbis of the region, followed [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]] practice and was of the Horowitz family. In New York, a Rozwadower Rebbe established a small synagogue on the [[upper West Side]], which continued for many decades after the war. There is a link to a [[Bereavement in Judaism|yizkor]] book about Rozwad\u00f3w which gives further notes on the Jewish life there. The Rozwad\u00f3w [[synagogue]] was, until [[World War II]], located on Attorney Street in the [[Lower East Side|lower east side of NYC]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], [[Eugene Lazowski|Dr. Eugene Lazowski]], a military doctor of the [[Polish Underground State|Polish underground]] [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]], [[Armia Krajowa]], created a fake epidemic of dangerous [[infectious disease]], [[Typhus|Epidemic Typhus]] in the town of [[Rozwad\u00f3w]] (now a district of Stalowa Wola) and the surrounding villages and towns. He saved an estimated 8,000 [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] from certain death in [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Internment|concentration camp]]s during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], performing his services in utmost secrecy under the threat of capital punishment.<ref>{{in lang|pl}} Andrzej Pity\u00f1ski, Museum of Stalowa Wola, [http://www.muzeum.stalowawola.pl/amerykanska_wspolpraca/wspolpraca/lazowski.htm Short biography of Eugeniusz \u0141azowski] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111195534/http://www.muzeum.stalowawola.pl/amerykanska_wspolpraca/wspolpraca/lazowski.htm |date=2007-11-11 }}</ref><ref>[http://stjoenj.net/lazowski/lazowski.html He duped Nazis, saved thousands]</ref><ref>[http://holocaustforgotten.com/eugene.htm Fake Epidemic Saves a Village from Nazis]</ref><ref>[http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2004/07/05/prsb0705.htm 2 doctors used typhus to save thousands in wartime]</ref><ref>Paula Davenport, Media & Communication Resources, [[Southern Illinois University]], [http://www.siu.edu/~perspect/01_fall/documentary.html Life Preserver] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070605085937/http://www.siu.edu/~perspect/01_fall/documentary.html |date=2007-06-05 }}</ref><ref>Yad Vashem, The Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority, [http://www1.yadvashem.org/righteous_new/statistics.html Righteous Among the Nations \u2013 per Country & Ethnic Origin January 1, 2009.

This was to be a group of factories built in an area in the middle of the country, away from the borders with [[Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]].

Pickerill made major contributions to several fields of dentistry and medicine both in New Zealand and overseas.\n\n==Early life==\nPickerill, known to his family as Percy was born in [[Hereford]], Herefordshire, England, on 3 August 1879, the oldest child of Thomas Pickerill and Mary Ann Gurney.<ref name=\"DNZB Pickerill\">{{DNZB|title=Henry Percy Pickerill|first= R. Harvey|last= Brown|id=3p25|accessdate=23 April 2017}}</ref> His father was at the time a commercial clerk and was later the managing director of the Lugwardine Tile Works which made porcelain tiles. \nPickerill attended Chandos School, the private Collegiate School of Hereford and then Hereford County College.<ref>Meikle, p. 32.</ref> Upon completing his secondary education he enrolled at the [[University of Birmingham]] in 1900 with the intention of studying dentistry and medicine. He was awarded a LDSRCS (licentiate in dental surgery of the Royal College of Surgeons of England) in 1903 and a BDS in 1904. The University of Birmingham was the first university in Great Britain to offer a BDS degree and Pickerill became the first graduate from this programme. Taking advantage of the dental and medical degrees sharing common courses, Pickerill was able to graduate with a MBChB in 1905.\n\nUpon graduating Pickerill worked in a dental practice in Hereford and as a clinical demonstrator in the dental department of the General Hospital in Birmingham. In 1906 he was appointed a lecturer in dental pathology and histology at the University of Birmingham. In 1906 he married Mabel Knott.\nIn 1906 after seeing an advertisement he applied for and was appointed at the age of 28 to the position of first director of the [[University of Otago Faculty of Dentistry|Dental School]] at the University of Otago. His submitted CV included a claim that he had attended the University of Oxford. However, there is no record of him having attended the university.<ref name=\"Meikle34\">Meikle, p. 34.</ref>\n\n==Immigration to New Zealand==\nEntry to the dental profession in New Zealand was restricted to those who had completed a degree or certificate of proficiency in dental surgery. In response, the dental school of the University of Otago was established on 1 July 1907 with a temporary director assisted by 12 honorary dental surgeons. \nPickerill reached Dunedin and took up his position in September 1907 on a salary of \u00a3500 a year.<ref name=\"Meikle34\"/> The first three students started in early 1908 followed by another three in May of the same year. Since its opening the school had no shortage of patients. However the school finances were plagued by a shortage of students and thus income, which was not resolved until a campaign led by acting Dean O.V. Davies led to bursaries covering fees and living costs for dental students that was established in 1917.\n\n==Service in World War 1==\nIn June 1915 Pickerill received a commission as a territorial captain with the [[New Zealand Medical Corps]]. He was transferred to the newly established [[New Zealand Dental Corps]] (NZDC) in November 1915. In 1916 Pickerill took leave from his position at the University of Otago to serve overseas with the NZDC, departing New Zealand with the 20th Reinforcements NZEF on the troopship ''Athenic''.<ref>Meikle, p. 92.</ref> Arriving in England in March 1917 he was posted to the [[No. 2 New Zealand General Hospital (Walton-on-Thames)|No 2 New Zealand General Hospital]] (Mount Felix Hospital)<ref>Gibb, John \"[https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/pioneering-otago-surgeon-remembered Pioneering Otago surgeon remembered],\" ''Otago Daily Times''. 14 March 2019.

The unit was transferred to the newly opened [[Queen Mary's Hospital, Sidcup|Queen's Hospital]] at Sidcup, in 1918. Pickerill was soon operating as a maxillofacial surgeon, gaining a reputation in the fields of facial reconstruction and plastic surgery despite no formal training or qualification in this field.<ref>Meikle, p. 94.</ref>\n\nThe end of the war led to Pickerill, the unit, and the remaining 59 patients departing in March 1919 on the ''SS Tainui'' to New Zealand, where they established themselves in the Facial and Jaw Department at [[Dunedin Hospital]]. In June 1919 Pickerill was recognised for his service by being promoted to lieutenant-colonel and appointed an OBE. Pickerill continued overseeing the long-term care of the unit's patients until December 1921 when, after the closing of the unit, he returned full-time to his position at the Dental School.<ref>Meikle, p. 105.</ref>\n\n==Return to New Zealand==\nResuming his position as dean of the Dental School in 1919, Pickerill found that as the result of the work of O.V. Davies the number of students had increased and dentistry as a university discipline was well established. The existing building was now too small, Pickerill had to overcome a proposal by Auckland interests establish a rival dental school in that city.  However he was able to convince the government that the dental school needed to be close to the country's only medical school. Approval for the construction of a new building was given in April 1924, and it opened in June 1926. \nPickerill strongly opposed the proposal by [[Thomas Anderson Hunter]] to establish a child dental health service which would be staffed by school dental nurses who were to receive just 18 months' training. His efforts failed to prevent the establishment of the New Zealand School Dental Service in 1921.\n\n==Move to Sydney==\nPickerill resigned from the University of Otago in 1927 to move to Sydney, where he specialised in plastic surgery. In 1933 he took up a post at the [[Royal North Shore Hospital]] in Sydney as senior plastic surgeon.\n\n== Later career ==\nOn his return to New Zealand he and his wife [[Cecily Pickerill]] settled in Wellington opening Bassam Hospital in [[Lower Hutt]] in 1940; the hospital treated children with [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|cleft palates]] and other conditions needing plastic surgery. He was also a Senior Plastic Surgeon at [[Wellington Hospital, New Zealand|Wellington Hospital]] and, with Cecily, established plastic surgery for the Auckland Hospital Board. He retired in 1945.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1956|title=Henry Percy Pickerill|url=|journal=New Zealand Medical Journal|volume=55|pages=413\u2013414, 514|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nHenry Pickerill died at Pinehaven, Upper Hutt, New Zealand on 10 August 1956. His ashes were taken to England by his wife and daughter and scattered from a bridge over the [[River Wye]] at [[Holme Lacy]] near Hereford.\n\n==Honours==\nPickerill was made an OBE in 1919, and a CBE in 1923.\n\n==Personal life==\nHe married Mabel Louise Knott on 19 June 1906 at Birmingham. They had three sons and one daughter.\nAfter divorcing Mabel Pickerill, he married [[Cecily Pickerill|Cecily Mary Wise Clarkson]] who was 27 years his junior, at Sydney on 17 December 1934. They had one daughter, Margaret. Cecily was also a surgeon. She was made a Dame of the British Empire (DBE) in 1977 and died in July 1988.\n\n== Publications ==\nPickerill, H P.

It was an independent princely state  from 1443 to 1775 and a princely estate under the British rule from 1776 to 1947. It had three capitals under different rulers, Nandapur, [[Rayagada]] and the most prominent being [[Jeypore]]. {{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|}}\nThe kingdom of Jeypore (Kalinga) was the largest among all other princely states and estates in [[Madras Presidency]] covering an area of {{cvt|31,079|sqkm}} in the year 1880 and {{cvt|36,259|sqkm}} in 1925.{{sfn|Royal Collection Trust UK|1880|}} Surprisingly, despite being the largest kingdom they were never conferred upon the status of a princely state because they lost their crucial feudatories of [[Bobbili]], [[Vizianagaram estate|Vizianagaram]], [[Kalahandi State|Kalahandi]], [[Salur]], [[Srungavarapukota]], [[Nayagarh|Nowagarh]], [[Khariar]] and [[Gajapathinagaram]], as they clinched independence from Jeypore and were later recognised as princely estates under the British Rule. The last ruler of the kingdom was King Vikram Dev IV as the estate was dissolved in 1947 and merged into the [[Dominion of India|Union of India]].{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=58}}\n     \n[[File:Jeypore Palace.jpg|thumb|Jeypore Palace]]\n\n==Early History==\n\nThe last king of Silavansa dynasty, Pratap Ganga Raj was succeeded by Vinayak Dev (1443-1476) a prince of the [[Solar Dynasty|Suryavansh]] dynasty of [[Kashmir]] married to the king's only daughter. He is known as the originator of the Suryavansh 'Sankara' dynasty who later went on to become one of the most dominant kingdoms of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] at some point in the history of the region but also had a gradual fall when they were succumbed by the rising power and alliance of their feudatories in the later era of some weak rulers.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=7}} Essentially, the advent of the British proved to be the turning point as they did not only cause a striking defeat to the kingdom but also destroyed the ages old stalwart bastion that was considered one of the prime reasons of their dominance.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=97}} The British Empire later recognized them as a zamindari which was the same status granted to their former feudatories. However, this did not disrupt the fact that Jeypore Maharajahs were the most prosperous in the region of Kalinga and according to one such account because of their militaristic dominance and alliances they acquired big sized diamonds imported from the famous [[Kollur mine|Kollur]] mines of [[Golconda]].{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=57}}These were the same mines that produced the famous [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond that now rests in the [[Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|crown]] of Queen [[Elizabeth II]] of [[England]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nVinayak's reign, however saw a constant conflict with the weakening Ganga dynasty until the last [[Eastern Ganga Dynasty|Ganga]] king Bhanu Deo IV was assassinated by his minister Kapliendra who usurped the throne and married his daughter to Vijaychandrakhya the only son of Vinayak and the first sovereign ruler, who expanded his domain to [[Reddipalli]] and [[Guntur]] after defeating the [[Reddy]] kings. {{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nVijaychandrakhya (1476-1510) being a sovereign ruler amassed a formidable army to expand his kingdom to the coastal and rich agricultural land of [[Vizianagaram|Vijaynagar]] and [[Visakhapatnam]]. However, his ambitions were humbled by the ruling [[Saluva dynasty|Saluva]] dynasty of Vijayanagar who stopped his advance to the kingdom and forced him to return after a month long venture of seizing the fort. Nevertheless, Vijayachandrakhya later went on to expand his kingdom in [[Odisha]]. He was succeeded by his son Bhairava Dev (1510-1527) in 1510 who ascended the throne in the era of the great Emperor [[Krishnadevaraya|Krishnadeva Raya]] of [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. Significantly, the army of Vijayanagara empire under [[Tuluva dynasty]] attacked the fort of [[Kondapalli Fort|Kondapalli]] which was heroically defended by Bhairava along with other Oriya chiefs.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=7}}\n\nVishwanath (1527-1571) famously known as 'Kalingadhipati' Maharajah Vishwanath Dev Gajapati, son of Bhairava succeeded his father in 1527. He served as a commander in the kingdom's army and successfully garnered a skilled set of soldiers. The fifth report on the affairs of the company describe him as the last prince to have united under his scepter all the ancient domains of the kings of Kalinga and restored them from the confines of [[Bengal]] to those of [[Telangana]] in south, which contained in his fold innumerable feudatories that paid homage to his royal seat.<ref name=\"The Fifth Annual Report\">{{cite book |last1=Presidency |first1=Madras |title=The Fifth Annual Report from the Select Committee on the Affairs of the East India Company |date=1866 |publisher=Graves, Cookson & Co. |location=United Scottish Press, London |page=141,217 |edition=First |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hnb2a8&view=1up&seq=5 |accessdate=17 September 2019}}</ref> He founded the city of [[Rayagada]] as the new capital of his kingdom and built a fort along the river [[Nagavali River|Nagavali]] and the famous temple of Maa [[Majhighariani Temple|Majhighariani]]. Furthermore, he conquered the southern parts of [[West Bengal]], [[Jharkhand]] and parts of [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]]. He successfully formed an imperial administration in and outside the radius of Kalinga and claimed the title of 'Gajapati' which was symbolically used by the powerful dynasty of the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapatis]] before its end in 1541. A peace treaty was signed between the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty|Qutub Shahis]] of Golconda marking river [[Godavari river|Godavari]] as the boundary between the two kingdoms.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=19}}\n\n[[File:Royal elephants of the Jeypore Kingdom of Kalinga.jpg|thumb|Royal elephants of the Jeypore Kingdom of Kalinga]]\nThe kingdom went into a turmoil after the death of Vishwanath Gajapati as his successors failed endeavors of usurping the throne invited old adversaries like the Sultanate of Golconda who neglected the peace treaty and forced the next three kings in line to become their tributaries.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=30}} The era of Balarama, Yesovanta and Krishna Raj lasted for a combined period of 77 years consequently internal feuds and family rivalries weakened the kingdom to such extent that the next king in line, Veer Vikrama Dev (1637-1669) had to shift his kingdom from Nandapur to Jeypore.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=46}}{{sfn|Vadivelu|1903|p=70}} His rule lasted for 32 years and was majorly concerned in formulating the new capital and transforming it into an acropolis which can successfully withstand any unprecedented onslaught in the hostile region of Kalinga. One of his finest ventures was the royal education combined with the study of arts and rigorous military-combat skills that were given to his grandsons Vishwambhar, Krishna, Hari and Balarama and which gracefully served its purpose of making Jeypore a formidable kingdom. In the point of cultural significance, It was during Veer Vikrama's era that the [[Gupteswar Cave]] was discovered in the forests of Ramgiri and is an infamous Hindu shrine in the region. The next king in line was Krishna Dev who ascended the throne in 1669, he is known for granting [[Kumili]] and Gundredu in the modern taluq of [[Vizianagaram|Vijaynagar]] to the family of Pushapati Sitarama Chandra Raj and the following zamindaris were created - [[Bobbili]], Devapalli, Rekapalli, Narava Mutha, Kottaki and [[Salur]].{{sfn|Vadivelu|1903|p=70}}{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=50}}\n\nIn 1672, Viswambhar Dev (1672-1676) was crowned and although his reign lasted for merely three years, his great military achievements and administrative skills qualified him as a magnanimous ruler, the first to formulate a distinguished feudal system that included within it the significant feudatories of [[Vizianagaram|Vijaynagar]], [[Bobbili]] and [[Kalahandi State|Kalahandi]]. He created nineteen more zamindaris with Peddapalli, Ramabhadrapuram and Kalahandi being the significant ones.{{sfn|Vadivelu|1903|p=70}} He also fought with the Dutch navigators and traders that attempted to confiscate land in the port of Visakhapatanam and was named as 'Sumber Deo' (a mispronounced form of his name). An odia inscription in a temple of Lakshmi-Narasimha revealed that  Maharajah Vishwambhar Dev defeated the Nawab of Chicacole in 1673 and forced him by a treaty to pay revenue of two agriculturally rich villages of Gajapathinagaram to the temple of his deity.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=54}} His efforts contributed to the royal treasury as he was successful in importing diamonds from the mines of Golconda an enemy state he was lest afraid of during his short reign. Following his death, Malakimardhan Krishna inherited the throne of the paramount kingdom of Kalinga.\n\nMalakimardhan Krishna (1676-1681) famous for triumphing over the combined forces of Golconda sultanate and the [[French East India Company]] was a shrewd military genius. Evidently, the French-Golconda alliance planned a full-fledged attack on the kingdom of Jeypore following the death of the former king Viswambhar. However, the courageous new king lead his army to the combat zone which was a mountainous area in the middle of Jeypore and Rayagada. The adroitness in [[guerrilla warfare]] of the Jeypore army was well rehearsed in those areas and they were able to subdue the enemies. The General of the Golconda army, Malik-Muhammad was killed by King Malakimardhan in a duel battle of swords and as a result the name 'Malakimardhana' or 'the destroyer of Malik' was given to the warrior king. A total of fourteen French canons were captured by the army of Jeypore that added more prowess to the kingdom. The confederacy of [[Malkangiri]], previously known as 'Malakimardhangiri' was established by Malakimardhan Krishna along with a fort known as 'Malakimardhangarh'.  In 1681, he died without a male issue and the responsibility of the kingdom passed to his young brother Hari Dev.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=59}}\n\n==Later History==\n\n===Advent of British===\n\n[[File:L-R Viscount George J Goschen, HH Maharajah Ram Chandra Deo, Lady Viscount.jpg|thumb|L-R Viscount George J Goschen, HH Maharajah Ram Chandra Deo, Viscountess Goschen]]\n\nIn 1775, Vikram Dev I assembled a force in Rayagada valley against the rising British forces of the [[East India Company]] who were accompanied by the army of [[Vizianagaram estate|Vizianagaram]], the former feudatory of Jeypore. Captain Richard Matthews was commanding the [[Northern Circars]] and he quoted, ''I took possession of the fort in 11th March, it is a square of about one thousand yards. The wall 20 feet high, the bastions very good, the rampart tolerable and a ditch 20 feet wide and as much deep. I have ordered it to be destroyed.'' However, he was pardoned by the British and the kingdom was granted back to him.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=97}}\n\n[[File:India1760 1905.jpg|thumb|Map of Maratha Empire and Jeypur Kingdom's exclusion]]\nThis Vikram Dev also provided assistance to one Raja Dariar of [[Bastar State|Bastar]] who fled from his kingdom and took shelter in the fort of Jeypore after his brother occupied the throne. The kingdom's army was dispatched to Bastar accompanied by both kings Dariar and Vikram. Nevertheless, Ajgar Singh who was the brother saw a crushing defeat and King Dariar was reinstalled in the throne who then granted two parganas to Vikram Dev for the military aid.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=99}} He also valiantly defended his territory and the capital city from the well-known army of the [[Maratha Empire]] in the region and drove out French from Malkangiri.{{sfn|Vadivelu|1903|p=72}}\n\nThe prosperity of the kingdom suffered due to the intruding and diabolical doctrines of the British East India company and there was a difference of opinion between the kings and the company just like all other kingdoms of India. However, the differences lessened when Vikram Dev II (1825-1860) succeeded his father Ramchandra Dev II (1779-1825) mainly because the company lost control aftermath the infamous [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Revolt of 1857]] and all princely kingdoms of India went into the direct control of the British crown. However, the next king in line, Ramchandra Dev III (1860-1875) established a cordial affiliation with the British officials by voluntarily resigning the administration of civil and criminal justice in favour of the British government and also by aiding them in quelling the well known [[Rampa rebellion of 1879|Rampa rebellion]] in Godavari district. He received a medal of honor from King [[Edward VII]] who was then the Prince of Wales. In 1875, the king died leaving his minor son as the successor of the kingdom.{{sfn|Vadivelu|1903|p=73}}\n[[File:HH MAHARAJAH SIR SRI SRI VIKRAM DEV III K.C.I.E.jpg|thumb|HH MAHARAJAH SIR SRI SRI VIKRAM DEV III K.C.I.E]]Vikram Dev III (1889-1920) also known as 'His Highness Maharajah Sir Sri Sri Vikram Dev KCIE' was only fourteen year old when his father died and had to wait for his responsibilities until he turned twenty-eight years of age.

He was honoured by the [[Order of the Indian Empire|Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire]] as the Knight Commander (KCIE) and dignified  with the hereditary style of \u2018[[Highness|His Highness]]\u2019 conferred on him and his successors.

The integration of these groups into Aryan society was accomplished by marriage with high-caste women or by conversion to acquire the benefits of the kshatriya status sanctified by the Brahmans. \n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 =  Chronicles of the Solar dynasty of Jeypore-Kalinga.jpg\n| width1 = 145\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 =  (II) Chronicles of the Solar dynasty of Jeypore-Kalinga.jpg\n| width2 = 145\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Chronicles of the Solar dynasty of Jeypore-Kalinga were recorded in the book of 'Jayapurasuryavanshavali'. Left: [[English language|English]], Right: [[Sanskrit]]\n}}\n\n===Suryavansh of Kalinga===\nVinayak Dev, the first king in the lineage of Jeypore was the younger son of Raja Kumbhiraj of Kashmir. The royal ring or Raja Mudra of Vinayak affirmed that he was a Suryavanshi prince of ancient [[Aryan]] race that dwelt in Kashmir and practiced an orthodox [[Vedas|Vedic]] lifestyle. Apparently, [[Surya]] was regarded as both a principal deity and the forefather of the dynasty nevertheless the famous [[Martand Sun Temple]] of Kashmir was prevalent among the kashmiri denizens. Other things included education in the four Vedas and an obligation to follow a strict moral code of conduct based on the principles of Dharma. Essentially, the family had been ruling as an independent kingdom and also as a vessel state under the [[Karkota Empire]].\nVinayak, disgruntled by the fact that he could never be a king went on a pilgrimage to the holy city of [[Kashi|Varanasi]] secretly abandoning his father's kingdom. According to the royal chronicles, he was an ardent devotee of [[Shiva]] and was hugely inspired by [[Kashmir Shaivism]]. Due to the complexity of life he decided to relinquish his royal identity and life the rest of his life as an ascetic. During his stay in Kashi he resided in the temple of Lord Vishweshwar and one night he had a dream of god encouraging him to go to [[Kalinga]] where he will find his new kingdom. Consequently, he traveled to the densely forested mountainous region of Kalinga and stopped to rest in Nandapur a small feudatory of the Gajapati [[Kapilendra Deva]] and was ruled by the king of Silavansh dynasty. The king of Nandapur married his only daughter Lilavati to the suryavanshi prince who henceforth named his branch of dynasty as 'Shankar Vansh' or 'Sankara Dynasty'. Interestingly, Shankar is another name of Lord Shiva and naming his dynasty after him can be believed as an act of devotion to the god who guided the young agitated prince to his destiny.\n\n===Religion===\n[[Hinduism]] was the main religion of the kingdom and the royal deity Goddess [[Kanaka Durga]] is considered the protector and godmother of the royal family and the people of Jeypore. The royal temple or kula mandir dedicated to the goddess is located within the precincts of Moti Mahal palace along with the temple of Sri Madan Mohan Mahaprabhu which is dedicated to Lord [[Krishna]]. Furthermore, a temple dedicated to Lord Rama also known as Sri Raghunath Mahaprabhu is located in front of the palace main gate. As stated earlier, [[Rama]] is revered as a god and also a magnanimous ancestral figure in the royal family and keeping this in mind when the 23rd Maharajah Vikram Dev III laid the construction of his new palace he also decided to erect two giant gates, one for the palace and other for the temple. Some kings were [[Shavism|Shaivites]] and they worshipped in the caves of [[Gupteswara]]. \nIn a cultural or religious aspect there were three traditions that were always prevalent in the kingdom - [[Shavism]], [[Vaishnavism]] and [[Shaktism]]. Evidently, the beginning of the dynasty was influenced by [[Shavism]] and even [[Vaishnavism]] got huge popularity under Maharajah Vishwambhara Dev II who encouraged Vaisnavic culture and the cult of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] in his state.\n\n==Genealogy of kings==\n\nThe following people ruled the Kingdom of Jeypore:<ref name=\"Henige2004\">{{cite book|author=David P.

It was an independent princely state  from 1443 to 1775 and a princely estate under the British rule from 1776 to 1947. It had three capitals under different rulers, Nandapur, [[Rayagada]] and the most prominent being [[Jeypore]]. {{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|}}\nThe kingdom of Jeypore (Kalinga) was the largest among all other princely states and estates in [[Madras Presidency]] covering an area of {{cvt|31,079|sqkm}} in the year 1880 and {{cvt|36,259|sqkm}} in 1925.{{sfn|Royal Collection Trust UK|1880|}} Surprisingly, despite being the largest kingdom they were never conferred upon the status of a princely state because they lost their crucial feudatories of [[Bobbili]], [[Vizianagaram estate|Vizianagaram]], [[Kalahandi State|Kalahandi]], [[Salur]], [[Srungavarapukota]], [[Nayagarh|Nowagarh]], [[Khariar]] and [[Gajapathinagaram]], as they clinched independence from Jeypore and were later recognised as princely estates under the British Rule. The last ruler of the kingdom was King Vikram Dev IV as the estate was dissolved in 1947 and merged into the [[Dominion of India|Union of India]].{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=58}}\n     \n[[File:Jeypore Palace.jpg|thumb|Jeypore Palace]]\n\n==Early History==\n\nThe last king of Silavansa dynasty, Pratap Ganga Raj was succeeded by Vinayak Dev (1443-1476) a prince of the [[Solar Dynasty|Suryavansh]] dynasty of [[Kashmir]] married to the king's only daughter. He is known as the originator of the Suryavansh 'Sankara' dynasty who later went on to become one of the most dominant kingdoms of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] at some point in the history of the region but also had a gradual fall when they were succumbed by the rising power and alliance of their feudatories in the later era of some weak rulers.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=7}} Essentially, the advent of the British proved to be the turning point as they did not only cause a striking defeat to the kingdom but also destroyed the ages old stalwart bastion that was considered one of the prime reasons of their dominance.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=97}} The British Empire later recognized them as a zamindari which was the same status granted to their former feudatories. However, this did not disrupt the fact that Jeypore Maharajahs were the most prosperous in the region of Kalinga and according to one such account because of their militaristic dominance and alliances they acquired big sized diamonds imported from the famous [[Kollur mine|Kollur]] mines of [[Golconda]].{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=57}}These were the same mines that produced the famous [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond that now rests in the [[Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|crown]] of Queen [[Elizabeth II]] of [[England]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nVinayak's reign, however saw a constant conflict with the weakening Ganga dynasty until the last [[Eastern Ganga Dynasty|Ganga]] king Bhanu Deo IV was assassinated by his minister Kapliendra who usurped the throne and married his daughter to Vijaychandrakhya the only son of Vinayak and the first sovereign ruler, who expanded his domain to [[Reddipalli]] and [[Guntur]] after defeating the [[Reddy]] kings. {{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nVijaychandrakhya (1476-1510) being a sovereign ruler amassed a formidable army to expand his kingdom to the coastal and rich agricultural land of [[Vizianagaram|Vijaynagar]] and [[Visakhapatnam]]. However, his ambitions were humbled by the ruling [[Saluva dynasty|Saluva]] dynasty of Vijayanagar who stopped his advance to the kingdom and forced him to return after a month long venture of seizing the fort. Nevertheless, Vijayachandrakhya later went on to expand his kingdom in [[Odisha]]. He was succeeded by his son Bhairava Dev (1510-1527) in 1510 who ascended the throne in the era of the great Emperor [[Krishnadevaraya|Krishnadeva Raya]] of [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. Significantly, the army of Vijayanagara empire under [[Tuluva dynasty]] attacked the fort of [[Kondapalli Fort|Kondapalli]] which was heroically defended by Bhairava along with other Oriya chiefs.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=7}}\n\nVishwanath (1527-1571) famously known as 'Kalingadhipati' Maharajah Vishwanath Dev Gajapati, son of Bhairava succeeded his father in 1527. He served as a commander in the kingdom's army and successfully garnered a skilled set of soldiers. The fifth report on the affairs of the company describe him as the last prince to have united under his scepter all the ancient domains of the kings of Kalinga and restored them from the confines of [[Bengal]] to those of [[Telangana]] in south, which contained in his fold innumerable feudatories that paid homage to his royal seat.<ref name=\"The Fifth Annual Report\">{{cite book |last1=Presidency |first1=Madras |title=The Fifth Annual Report from the Select Committee on the Affairs of the East India Company |date=1866 |publisher=Graves, Cookson & Co. |location=United Scottish Press, London |page=141,217 |edition=First |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hnb2a8&view=1up&seq=5 |accessdate=17 September 2019}}</ref> He founded the city of [[Rayagada]] as the new capital of his kingdom and built a fort along the river [[Nagavali River|Nagavali]] and the famous temple of Maa [[Majhighariani Temple|Majhighariani]]. Furthermore, he conquered the southern parts of [[West Bengal]], [[Jharkhand]] and parts of [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]]. He successfully formed an imperial administration in and outside the radius of Kalinga and claimed the title of 'Gajapati' which was symbolically used by the powerful dynasty of the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapatis]] before its end in 1541. A peace treaty was signed between the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty|Qutub Shahis]] of Golconda marking river [[Godavari river|Godavari]] as the boundary between the two kingdoms.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=19}}\n\n[[File:Royal elephants of the Jeypore Kingdom of Kalinga.jpg|thumb|Royal elephants of the Jeypore Kingdom of Kalinga]]\nThe kingdom went into a turmoil after the death of Vishwanath Gajapati as his successors failed endeavors of usurping the throne invited old adversaries like the Sultanate of Golconda who neglected the peace treaty and forced the next three kings in line to become their tributaries.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=30}} The era of Balarama, Yesovanta and Krishna Raj lasted for a combined period of 77 years consequently internal feuds and family rivalries weakened the kingdom to such extent that the next king in line, Veer Vikrama Dev (1637-1669) had to shift his kingdom from Nandapur to Jeypore.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=46}}{{sfn|Vadivelu|1903|p=70}} His rule lasted for 32 years and was majorly concerned in formulating the new capital and transforming it into an acropolis which can successfully withstand any unprecedented onslaught in the hostile region of Kalinga. One of his finest ventures was the royal education combined with the study of arts and rigorous military-combat skills that were given to his grandsons Vishwambhar, Krishna, Hari and Balarama and which gracefully served its purpose of making Jeypore a formidable kingdom. In the point of cultural significance, It was during Veer Vikrama's era that the [[Gupteswar Cave]] was discovered in the forests of Ramgiri and is an infamous Hindu shrine in the region. The next king in line was Krishna Dev who ascended the throne in 1669, he is known for granting [[Kumili]] and Gundredu in the modern taluq of [[Vizianagaram|Vijaynagar]] to the family of Pushapati Sitarama Chandra Raj and the following zamindaris were created - [[Bobbili]], Devapalli, Rekapalli, Narava Mutha, Kottaki and [[Salur]].{{sfn|Vadivelu|1903|p=70}}{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=50}}\n\nIn 1672, Viswambhar Dev (1672-1676) was crowned and although his reign lasted for merely three years, his great military achievements and administrative skills qualified him as a magnanimous ruler, the first to formulate a distinguished feudal system that included within it the significant feudatories of [[Vizianagaram|Vijaynagar]], [[Bobbili]] and [[Kalahandi State|Kalahandi]]. He created nineteen more zamindaris with Peddapalli, Ramabhadrapuram and Kalahandi being the significant ones.{{sfn|Vadivelu|1903|p=70}} He also fought with the Dutch navigators and traders that attempted to confiscate land in the port of Visakhapatanam and was named as 'Sumber Deo' (a mispronounced form of his name). An odia inscription in a temple of Lakshmi-Narasimha revealed that  Maharajah Vishwambhar Dev defeated the Nawab of Chicacole in 1673 and forced him by a treaty to pay revenue of two agriculturally rich villages of Gajapathinagaram to the temple of his deity.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=54}} His efforts contributed to the royal treasury as he was successful in importing diamonds from the mines of Golconda an enemy state he was lest afraid of during his short reign. Following his death, Malakimardhan Krishna inherited the throne of the paramount kingdom of Kalinga.\n\nMalakimardhan Krishna (1676-1681) famous for triumphing over the combined forces of Golconda sultanate and the [[French East India Company]] was a shrewd military genius. Evidently, the French-Golconda alliance planned a full-fledged attack on the kingdom of Jeypore following the death of the former king Viswambhar. However, the courageous new king lead his army to the combat zone which was a mountainous area in the middle of Jeypore and Rayagada. The adroitness in [[guerrilla warfare]] of the Jeypore army was well rehearsed in those areas and they were able to subdue the enemies. The General of the Golconda army, Malik-Muhammad was killed by King Malakimardhan in a duel battle of swords and as a result the name 'Malakimardhana' or 'the destroyer of Malik' was given to the warrior king. A total of fourteen French canons were captured by the army of Jeypore that added more prowess to the kingdom. The confederacy of [[Malkangiri]], previously known as 'Malakimardhangiri' was established by Malakimardhan Krishna along with a fort known as 'Malakimardhangarh'.  In 1681, he died without a male issue and the responsibility of the kingdom passed to his young brother Hari Dev.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=59}}\n\n==Later History==\n\n===Advent of British===\n\n[[File:L-R Viscount George J Goschen, HH Maharajah Ram Chandra Deo, Lady Viscount.jpg|thumb|L-R Viscount George J Goschen, HH Maharajah Ram Chandra Deo, Viscountess Goschen]]\n\nIn 1775, Vikram Dev I assembled a force in Rayagada valley against the rising British forces of the [[East India Company]] who were accompanied by the army of [[Vizianagaram estate|Vizianagaram]], the former feudatory of Jeypore. Captain Richard Matthews was commanding the [[Northern Circars]] and he quoted, ''I took possession of the fort in 11th March, it is a square of about one thousand yards. The wall 20 feet high, the bastions very good, the rampart tolerable and a ditch 20 feet wide and as much deep. I have ordered it to be destroyed.'' However, he was pardoned by the British and the kingdom was granted back to him.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=97}}\n\n[[File:India1760 1905.jpg|thumb|Map of Maratha Empire and Jeypur Kingdom's exclusion]]\nThis Vikram Dev also provided assistance to one Raja Dariar of [[Bastar State|Bastar]] who fled from his kingdom and took shelter in the fort of Jeypore after his brother occupied the throne. The kingdom's army was dispatched to Bastar accompanied by both kings Dariar and Vikram. Nevertheless, Ajgar Singh who was the brother saw a crushing defeat and King Dariar was reinstalled in the throne who then granted two parganas to Vikram Dev for the military aid.{{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=99}} He also valiantly defended his territory and the capital city from the well-known army of the [[Maratha Empire]] in the region and drove out French from Malkangiri.{{sfn|Vadivelu|1903|p=72}}\n\nThe prosperity of the kingdom suffered due to the intruding and diabolical doctrines of the British East India company and there was a difference of opinion between the kings and the company just like all other kingdoms of India. However, the differences lessened when Vikram Dev II (1825-1860) succeeded his father Ramchandra Dev II (1779-1825) mainly because the company lost control aftermath the infamous [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Revolt of 1857]] and all princely kingdoms of India went into the direct control of the British crown. However, the next king in line, Ramchandra Dev III (1860-1875) established a cordial affiliation with the British officials by voluntarily resigning the administration of civil and criminal justice in favour of the British government and also by aiding them in quelling the well known [[Rampa rebellion of 1879|Rampa rebellion]] in Godavari district. He received a medal of honor from King [[Edward VII]] who was then the Prince of Wales.

The Hindu god [[Surya|Surya]] or Vivasvan is considered the primogenitor of the Suryavanshis. The dynasty remains a legacy of some great personalities like [[Harishchandra]] the wise king, [[Vishwamitra]] the king who gave away his kinship and later became a Brahmarishi, [[Rama]] the benevolent avatar of Lord [[Vishnu]], [[Bhagirath|Bhagiratha]] the king who brought river [[Ganges]] down to Earth; and also great kings and emperors like [[Ikshavaku]], [[Mandhatri]], [[Dilip]], [[Raghu]], [[Aja]], [[Dasharatha]] and [[Sagara]]. Due to the dynasty being millenniums old, there are various theories that indicate the migration of Suryavanshi princes to different parts of India and necessarily the world. However, the original members of the solar dynasty are only those families that are considered an offspring of the Aryan race excluding the likes of [[Rajput|Rajputs]] or [[Jat|Jats]] who are the descendants of [[Scythians|Scythian]] tribes who migrated into India after the fall of the [[Gupta dynasty|Gupta Empire]] and therefore cannot be considered as Aryans. The integration of these groups into Aryan society was accomplished by marriage with high-caste women or by conversion to acquire the benefits of the kshatriya status sanctified by the Brahmans. \n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 =  Chronicles of the Solar dynasty of Jeypore-Kalinga.jpg\n| width1 = 145\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 =  (II) Chronicles of the Solar dynasty of Jeypore-Kalinga.jpg\n| width2 = 145\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Chronicles of the Solar dynasty of Jeypore-Kalinga were recorded in the book of 'Jayapurasuryavanshavali'. Left: [[English]], Right: [[Sanskrit]]\n}}\n\n===Suryavansh of Kalinga===\nVinayak Dev, the first king in the lineage of Jeypore was the younger son of Raja Kumbhiraj of Kashmir. The royal ring or Raja Mudra of Vinayak affirmed that he was a Suryavanshi prince of ancient [[Aryan]] race that dwelt in Kashmir and practiced an orthodox [[Vedas|Vedic]] lifestyle. Apparently, [[Surya]] was regarded as both a principal deity and the forefather of the dynasty nevertheless the famous [[Martand Sun Temple]] of Kashmir was prevalent among the kashmiri denizens. Other things included education in the four Vedas and an obligation to follow a strict moral code of conduct based on the principles of Dharma. Essentially, the family had been ruling as an independent kingdom and also as a vessel state under the [[Karkota Empire]].\nVinayak, disgruntled by the fact that he could never be a king went on a pilgrimage to the holy city of [[Kashi|Varanasi]] secretly abandoning his father's kingdom. According to the royal chronicles, he was an ardent devotee of [[Shiva]] and was hugely inspired by [[Kashmir Shaivism]]. Due to the complexity of life he decided to relinquish his royal identity and life the rest of his life as an ascetic. During his stay in Kashi he resided in the temple of Lord Vishweshwar and one night he had a dream of god encouraging him to go to [[Kalinga]] where he will find his new kingdom. Consequently, he traveled to the densely forested mountainous region of Kalinga and stopped to rest in Nandapur a small feudatory of the Gajapati [[Kapilendra Deva]] and was ruled by the king of Silavansh dynasty. The king of Nandapur married his only daughter Lilavati to the suryavanshi prince who henceforth named his branch of dynasty as 'Shankar Vansh' or 'Sankara Dynasty'. Interestingly, Shankar is another name of Lord Shiva and naming his dynasty after him can be believed as an act of devotion to the god who guided the young agitated prince to his destiny.\n\n===Religion===\n[[Hinduism]] was the main religion of the kingdom and the royal deity Goddess [[Kanaka Durga]] is considered the protector and godmother of the royal family and the people of Jeypore. The royal temple or kula mandir dedicated to the goddess is located within the precincts of Moti Mahal palace along with the temple of Sri Madan Mohan Mahaprabhu which is dedicated to Lord [[Krishna]]. Furthermore, a temple dedicated to Lord Rama also known as Sri Raghunath Mahaprabhu is located in front of the palace main gate. As stated earlier, [[Rama]] is revered as a god and also a magnanimous ancestral figure in the royal family and keeping this in mind when the 23rd Maharajah Vikram Dev III laid the construction of his new palace he also decided to erect two giant gates, one for the palace and other for the temple. Some kings were [[Shavism|Shaivites]] and they worshipped in the caves of [[Gupteswara]]. \nIn a cultural or religious aspect there were three traditions that were always prevalent in the kingdom - [[Shavism]], [[Vaishnavism]] and [[Shaktism]]. Evidently, the beginning of the dynasty was influenced by [[Shavism]] and even [[Vaishnavism]] got huge popularity under Maharajah Vishwambhara Dev II who encouraged Vaisnavic culture and the cult of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] in his state.\n\n==Genealogy of kings==\n\nThe following people ruled the Kingdom of Jeypore:<ref name=\"Henige2004\">{{cite book|author=David P.
