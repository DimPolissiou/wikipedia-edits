The 18th century saw male philosophers attracted to issues of human rights, and men such as the [[Marquis de Condorcet]] championed women's education. Liberals, such as the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] [[Jeremy Bentham]], demanded equal rights for women in every sense, as people increasingly came to believe that women were treated unfairly under the law.<ref name=Campos_Boralevi>{{cite book | last = Campos Boralevi | first = Lea | title = Bentham and the oppressed | publisher = Walter De Gruyter Inc. | location = Berlin New York | year = 1984 | isbn = 9783110099744 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, there was also an awareness of women's struggle. The British legal historian, Sir [[Henry Maine]], criticized the inevitability of patriarchy in his ''Ancient Law'' (1861).<ref name=\"Maine\">{{cite book | last = Sumner Maine | first = Henry | title = Ancient law | publisher = J.M.

Although his efforts focused on the problems of married women, it was an acknowledgment that marriage for Victorian women was predicated upon a sacrifice of liberty, rights, and property. His involvement in the women's movement stemmed from his long-standing friendship with [[Harriet Taylor]], whom he eventually married.\n\nIn 1840, women were refused the right to participate at the [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]] in London. Supporters of the women attending argued that it was hypocritical to forbid women and men from sitting together at this convention to end slavery; they cited similar segregationist arguments in the United States that were used to separate whites and blacks. When women were still denied to join in the proceedings, abolitionists [[William Lloyd Garrison]], [[Charles Lenox Remond]], [[Nathaniel Peabody Rogers]], and [[Henry Stanton]], all elected to sit silently with the women.<ref name=\"Kimmel2\">{{citation | author-last = Kimmel | author-first = Michael S. | author-link = Michael Kimmel | contribution = Introduction | editor-last = Kimmel | editor-first = Michael S. | editor-link = Michael Kimmel | title = Against the tide: pro-feminist men in the United States, 1776-1990: a documentary history | pages = 1&ndash;51 | publisher = Beacon Press | location = Boston, Massachusetts | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780807067604 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref>\n\nOne argument against female participation, both at the World Anti-Slavery Convention, and commonly in the nineteenth century, was the suggestion that women were ill-constituted to assume male responsibilities. Abolitionist [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]] argued against this, stating: <blockquote>\nI do not see how any woman can avoid a thrill of indignation when she first opens her eyes to the fact that it is really contempt, not reverence, that has so long kept her sex from an equal share of legal, political, and educational rights...[a woman needs equal rights] not because she is man's better half, but because she is his other half. She needs them, not as an angel, but as a fraction of humanity.<ref name=\"Kimmel2\"/></blockquote>\n\nAmerican [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Michael Kimmel]] categorized American male responses to feminism at the turn of the twentieth century into three categories: pro-feminist, [[masculinist]], and [[Antifeminism|antifeminist]].<ref>[[Michael Messner|Messner, Michael]] (1997), \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=nG8MGcopgWQC&pg=PA9 Men and masculinities]\", in {{cite book | editor-last = Messner | editor-first = Michael | editor-link = Michael Messner | title = Politics of masculinities: men in movements | page = [https://archive.org/details/politicsofmascul00mess/page/9 9] | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | location = Thousand Oaks, California | isbn = 9780803955776 | date = 1997-03-20 | url = https://archive.org/details/politicsofmascul00mess/page/9 }}</ref><ref name=\"Chafetz2006\">Pelak, Cynthia Fabrizio; Taylor, Verta; Whittier, Nancy (2006), \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzEhEdWViPoC&pg=PA168 Gender movements]\", in {{cite book | editor-last = Saltzman Chafetz | editor-first = Janet | title = Handbook of the sociology of gender |page=168 | publisher = Springer | location = New York | isbn = 9780387362182 | date = 2006-11-22 }}</ref> Pro-feminist men, believing that changes would also benefit men, generally welcomed women's increased participation in the public sphere, and changes in the division of labour in the home;<ref name=\"Chafetz2006\"/>  in contrast anti-feminists opposed [[women's suffrage]] and participation in public life, supporting a traditional patriarchal family model.<ref name=\"Chafetz2006\"/> Finally, the [[masculinist]] movement was characterized by men's groups, and developed as an indirect reaction to the perceived femininization of manhood.<ref name=\"Chafetz2006\"/>\n\n==Men's liberation movement==\n{{further|Men's liberation}}\nThe men's liberation movement began in the early 1970s as consciousness-raising groups to help men free themselves from the limits of sex roles. Proponents of men's liberation argued that male bonding is a mechanism to conform men's identities to a single sense of masculinity, which reinforces patriarchy.  In lieu of such bonding, the men's liberation movement called for open acknowledgment of the costs of masculinity: men's entrapment in their fixed role as the breadwinner of the nuclear family and the taboo against men expressing emotions.  Most significantly, this movement intended to make it acceptable for men to be open about their emotions while maintaining their masculinity.\n\nThe link between the biological male sex and the social construction of masculinity was seen by some scholars<ref name=Mirsky1>Mirsky, Seth (1996), \"[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OUgTCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA27 Three arguments for the elimination of masculinity]\", in {{cite book | editor-last = Krondorfer | editor-first = Bj\u00f6rn | title = Men's bodies, men's gods: male identities in a (post- ) Christian culture | pages = 27&ndash;39 | publisher = New York University Press | location = New York | isbn = 9780814746691 | year = 1996 }}</ref> as a limitation on men's collaboration with the feminist movement.  This sharply contrasted with sex role theory which viewed gender as something determined by biological differences between the sexes.

This argument was also echoed in religious circles with the [[Muscular Christianity]] movement.\n\nA uniting principle was the belief that men's problems were awarded less attention than women's and that any previous oppression of women had turned, or was about to turn, into oppression of men. Men's rights activists cite men's economic burden of the traditionally male breadwinner role, men's shorter average life expectancy, and inequalities favoring women in divorce issues, custody laws, and abortion rights<ref name=Messner2>{{cite book | last = Messner | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Messner | title = Taking the field: women, men, and sports | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | location = Minneapolis | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780816634491 }}</ref> as evidence of men's suffering.\n\nThe campaign has generally had the most success achieving legal reform in family law, particularly regarding child custody. Activists argue that the American judicial system discriminates against fathers in child custody hearings since mothers are typically viewed as the main caregivers. They claim that the economic burden of the breadwinner role has made it more difficult for men to take part in child rearing, and that court decisions rarely account for this obstacle.<ref name=\"Messner2\"/>\n\nSome organizations, such as the [[National Coalition of Free Men]] (NCFM), have made efforts to examine how sex discrimination affects men. For instance, this group argues that custody rights in favor of women discriminate against men because they are based on the belief that women are naturally more nurturing and better caregivers than men.

One example of this is that some African American men have been unable to carry over the fundamental principles and lessons of the struggle for civil rights into a meaningful contribution to the struggle to end sexist oppression. However, at a more primary level, the bonds formed in the civil rights movement established valuable solidarity among African American women and men.<ref>{{cite book | last = hooks | first = bell | author-link = bell hooks | title = Feminist theory: from margin to center | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2015 | origyear = 1984 | isbn = 9781138821668 | title-link = Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center }}</ref> This is an approach that may be transferable and equally useful to the feminist movement.

Other female feminists argue that men cannot be feminists simply because they are not women, cannot understand women's issues, and are collectively members of the class of oppressors against women.  They assert that men are granted inherent privileges that prevent them from fundamentally identifying with feminist struggles and thus make it impossible for them to identify with feminists.<ref name=\"Funk1\">{{cite journal | last = Ervin Funk | first = Russ | title = The power of naming: men in feminism | journal = Feminista!

This idea asserts that until men share equal responsibility for struggling to end sexism against women, the feminist movement will reflect the very sexist contradiction it wishes to eradicate.<ref name=\"hooks1984\"/>  The term \"profeminist\" occupies the middle ground in this semantic debate, because it offers a degree of closeness to feminism without using the term itself. Also, the prefix \"pro\" characterizes the term as more proactive and positive.

The 18th century saw male philosophers attracted to issues of human rights, and men such as the [[Marquis de Condorcet]] championed women's education.

Although his efforts focused on the problems of married women, it was an acknowledgment that marriage for Victorian women was predicated upon a sacrifice of liberty, rights, and property. His involvement in the women's movement stemmed from his long-standing friendship with [[Harriet Taylor]], whom he eventually married.\n\nIn 1840, women were refused the right to participate at the [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]] in London. Supporters of the women attending argued that it was hypocritical to forbid women and men from sitting together at this convention to end slavery; they cited similar segregationist arguments in the United States that were used to separate whites and blacks. When women were still denied to join in the proceedings, abolitionists [[William Lloyd Garrison]], [[Charles Lenox Remond]], [[Nathaniel Peabody Rogers]], and [[Henry Stanton]], all elected to sit silently with the women.<ref name=\"Kimmel2\">{{citation | author-last = Kimmel | author-first = Michael S. | author-link = Michael Kimmel | contribution = Introduction | editor-last = Kimmel | editor-first = Michael S. | editor-link = Michael Kimmel | title = Against the tide: pro-feminist men in the United States, 1776-1990: a documentary history | pages = 1&ndash;51 | publisher = Beacon Press | location = Boston, Massachusetts | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780807067604 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref>\n\nOne argument against female participation, both at the World Anti-Slavery Convention, and commonly in the nineteenth century, was the suggestion that women were ill-constituted to assume male responsibilities. Abolitionist [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]] argued against this, stating: <blockquote>\nI do not see how any woman can avoid a thrill of indignation when she first opens her eyes to the fact that it is really contempt, not reverence, that has so long kept her sex from an equal share of legal, political, and educational rights...[a woman needs equal rights] not because she is man's better half, but because she is his other half.

Proponents of men's liberation argued that male bonding is a mechanism to conform men's identities to a single sense of masculinity, which reinforces patriarchy.  In lieu of such bonding, the men's liberation movement called for open acknowledgment of the costs of masculinity: men's entrapment in their fixed role as the breadwinner of the nuclear family and the taboo against men expressing emotions.  Most significantly, this movement intended to make it acceptable for men to be open about their emotions while maintaining their masculinity.\n\nThe link between the biological male sex and the social construction of masculinity was seen by some scholars<ref name=Mirsky1>Mirsky, Seth (1996), \"[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OUgTCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA27 Three arguments for the elimination of masculinity]\", in {{cite book | editor-last = Krondorfer | editor-first = Bj\u00f6rn | title = Men's bodies, men's gods: male identities in a (post- ) Christian culture | pages = 27&ndash;39 | publisher = New York University Press | location = New York | isbn = 9780814746691 | year = 1996 }}</ref> as a limitation on men's collaboration with the feminist movement.  This sharply contrasted with sex role theory which viewed gender as something determined by biological differences between the sexes.

For instance, this group argues that custody rights in favor of women discriminate against men because they are based on the belief that women are naturally more nurturing and better caregivers than men. Thus, groups such as NCFM promote awareness, resources, support, and openings for discussion for these issues.<ref name=\"Messner2\"/>\n\n==Male feminism and pro-feminism==\n{{Further information|Pro-feminism}}\nAs feminist writer [[Shira Tarrant]] has argued, a number of men have engaged with and contributed to feminist movements throughout history.<ref name=Tarrant>{{cite book | last = Tarrant | first = Shira | author-link = Shira Tarrant | title = Men and feminism | publisher = Seal Press | location = Berkeley, California | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781580052580 }}</ref>  Today, academics like [[Michael Flood]], [[Michael Messner]], and [[Michael Kimmel]] are involved with [[men's studies]] and [[pro-feminism]].<ref name=\"Kimmel2\"/><ref name=\"Messner2\"/><ref>\n''Further citations'':\n* [[Michael Flood|Flood, Michael]] (2004), \"[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SsqfOrhd1u0C&pg=PA261 Backlash: Angry men's movements]\", in {{cite book | editor-last = Rossi | editor-first = Stacey Ellen | title = The battle and backlash rage on: why feminism cannot be obsolete | pages = 261&ndash;278 | publisher = Xlibris Corporation | location = New York, N.Y. | isbn = 9781413459340 }}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}\n* [[Michael Kimmel|Kimmel, Michael S.]] (2013) [1998], \"[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vc_WAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT27 Who's afraid of men doing feminism?]\", in {{cite book | editor-last = Digby | editor-first = Tom | title = Men doing feminism | pages = 57&ndash;68 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | isbn = 9781135772154 | date = 2013-10-28 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Messner | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Messner | title = Power at play: sports and the problem of masculinity | url = https://archive.org/details/poweratplaysport0000mess | url-access = registration | publisher = Beacon Press | location = Boston | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780807041055 }}</ref>\n\nThere is debate within feminism over whether or not men can be feminists.

One example of this is that some African American men have been unable to carry over the fundamental principles and lessons of the struggle for civil rights into a meaningful contribution to the struggle to end sexist oppression. However, at a more primary level, the bonds formed in the civil rights movement established valuable solidarity among African American women and men.<ref>{{cite book | last = hooks | first = bell | author-link = bell hooks | title = Feminist theory: from margin to center | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2015 | origyear = 1984 | isbn = 9781138821668 | title-link = Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center }}</ref> This is an approach that may be transferable and equally useful to the feminist movement.

As such is one of the few locations where the star memorials are \"doubled up\" rather than being placed linearly, in order for more stars to be accommodated in front of the center.\n\nIn February 2005, the Academy Awards statuettes were put on display for public viewing at Hollywood & Highland before the ceremony on March 5.  Visitors could have a picture taken outside with a giant prop Oscar that was to be used on the red carpet and in the exhibit could learn about the history of the Academy Awards, see the statuettes that were to be presented, and even get their picture taken holding an actual Oscar statuette. It became extremely popular, so the Academy decided to continue it.  The exhibit opened on February 9, 2006 and closed February 24, when the Oscars were removed and paraded down the red carpet into the Dolby Theatre.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://hollywoodandhighland.com/ Hollywood & Highland]\n* [http://www.loewshotels.com/en/Hollywood-Hotel/ Loews Hollywood Hotel]\n* [http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/el_capitan/ El Capitan Theatre]\n* [http://www.chinesetheatres.com/ Grauman's Chinese Theatre]\n* [http://www.cimgroup.com/ CIM Group]\n\n{{Greater Hollywood}}\n{{Shopping malls in California}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hollywood & Highland Center}}\n[[Category:Landmarks in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Shopping malls in Central Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Shopping malls established in 2001]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Hollywood]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Hollywood Boulevard]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox shopping mall\n| name              = Hollywood & Highland Center\n| image             = HollywoodHighland 04.jpg\n| image_width       = 200px\n| caption           = The center's entrance\n| location          = [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California]], United States\n| coordinates       = {{coord|34|06|08.5|N|118|20|22|W|type:landmark_region:US-CA|display=inline,title}}\n| address           = 6801 Hollywood Boulevard\n| opening_date      = November 9, 2001\n| closing_date      = \n| developer         = [[The Hahn Company]]\n| manager           = \n| owner             = DJM and Gaw Capitol\n| architect         = Ehrenkrantz Eckstut & Kuhn Architects\n| number_of_stores  = 60\n| number_of_anchors = 1 ([[Dolby Theatre]])\n| floor_area        = {{convert|640000|sqft|m2}}\n| parking           = On-street, [[multi-storey car park|parking garage]]\n| floors            = 5 (retail)\n| publictransit     = {{LACMTA link logo}} {{LACMTA icon strip|Red}} [[Hollywood/Highland (Los Angeles Metro station)|Hollywood/Highland]]\n| website           = {{url|hollywoodandhighland.com}}\n| footnotes         = \n}}\nThe '''Hollywood & Highland Center''' is a shopping mall and entertainment complex at [[Hollywood Boulevard]] and [[Highland Avenue (Los Angeles)|Highland Avenue]] in the [[Hollywood]] district in Los Angeles.

Despite objections of some residents and neighbors, in 2002 this agreement was amended and extended for an additional 20 years.  L.A. City Councilman [[Eric Garcetti]], who then represented the Hollywood-area district and was elected mayor in 2013, supported extending this special permit.<ref>{{cite news | author=McGreevy, Patrick | title=City Extends Hollywood-Highland Pact | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/sep/21/local/me-mall21 | work=Los Angeles Times | date=September 21, 2002 | accessdate=2008-12-18}}</ref>\n\nThe design of the center has been criticized.  In 2007, ''Curbed L.A.'', an online magazine, named Hollywood and Highland the \"winner\" of their Ugliest Building in Los Angeles contest.  In selecting Hollywood & Highland, they cited its aesthetics, pedestrian unfriendliness (including the lack of storefronts on the side facing Highland Ave.), confusing circulation, and \"mish-mash of architectural styles\".<ref>{{cite news | author=jwilliams | title=Here It Is...

The [[TV Guide]] Hollywood Center (formerly owned by CIM Group)<ref>{{cite news | url=https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/top-lists/shoppers-guide-to-hollywood-highland/ | title=Shopper\u2019s Guide To Hollywood & Highland | work=[[KCBS-TV]] | date=January 18, 2016}}</ref> across the street reconstructed the ground floor and has attracted new tenants such as [[American Apparel]], [[Baja Fresh]], [[Hooters]], and [[Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf]]. Other notable retail stores that have a presence on the Boulevard include clothier [[H&M]] and the Spanish retail chain [[Zara (clothing)|Zara]].<ref>[http://www.hollywoodandhighland.com/press_releases_info.php?release=17 Hollywood & Highland Center \u2013 Press Releases]</ref> In addition, several blocks further east on [[Vine Street]], a [[W Hotel]] opened incorporating the existing Hollywood/Vine Metro Red Line station.\n\nThe sidewalk in front of Hollywood and Highland is considered a coveted location for recent additions to the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. As such is one of the few locations where the star memorials are \"doubled up\" rather than being placed linearly, in order for more stars to be accommodated in front of the center.\n\nIn February 2005, the Academy Awards statuettes were put on display for public viewing at Hollywood and Highland before the ceremony on March 5.  Visitors could have a picture taken outside with a giant prop Oscar that was to be used on the red carpet and in the exhibit could learn about the history of the Academy Awards, see the statuettes that were to be presented, and even get their picture taken holding an actual Oscar statuette. It became extremely popular, so the Academy decided to continue it.  The exhibit opened on February 9, 2006 and closed February 24, when the Oscars were removed and paraded down the red carpet into the Dolby Theatre.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://hollywoodandhighland.com/ Hollywood and Highland]\n* [http://www.loewshotels.com/en/Hollywood-Hotel/ Loews Hollywood Hotel]\n* [http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/el_capitan/ El Capitan Theatre]\n* [http://www.chinesetheatres.com/ Grauman's Chinese Theatre]\n* [http://www.cimgroup.com/ CIM Group]\n\n{{Greater Hollywood}}\n{{Shopping malls in California}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hollywood And Highland Center}}\n[[Category:Landmarks in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Shopping malls in Central Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Shopping malls established in 2001]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Hollywood]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Hollywood Boulevard]]\n", "name_user": "Don Williams", "label": "safe", "comment": "Clean-up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_and_Highland_Center"}
