Donovan''''' is a Canadian [[drama film|drama]] film, co-written, co-produced, and directed by [[Xavier Dolan]] in his [[English language|English]]-language debut. It stars [[Kit Harington]], [[Jacob Tremblay]], [[Natalie Portman]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Kathy Bates]], [[Thandie Newton]], [[Ben Schnetzer]], and [[Jared Keeso]]. The film deals with themes of [[celebrity]], [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid media]] in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], mother-son relationships, and [[homosexuality]].\n\nIt is presented as three different sequences of scenes interspersed during the film: a series set in 2017 showing a young actor who reminisces about the written correspondence he shared as a child with an American TV star who died since then, and two other series set in the mid-2000s depicting the lives of both characters at the time of the correspondence. \n\n''The Death & Life of John F. Donovan'' had its world premiere at the [[2018 Toronto International Film Festival]], making it Dolan's first film to premiere at the festival. The film was critically panned, with many critics labeling it as \"bland\" and \"pretentious.\"<ref name=\"rottentomatoes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_death_and_life_of_john_f_donovan/|title=The Death and Life of John F.

The book collects letters he received from John F. Donovan, an actor with whom he corresponded with as a child, and who died from a [[drug overdose]]. \n\nIn a flashback to the mid-2000s, Turner is a [[child actor]] who is bullied by his [[Homophobia|homophobic]] schoolmates. He idolizes Donovan, who plays the lead character in the teen drama series ''Hellsome High''. The tabloid press frequently speculates that Donovan is gay and [[closeted]]; when gossip regarding Donovan soliciting male prostitutes makes headlines, his correspondence with Turner is made public, sparking malicious speculation about the nature of Turner and Donovan's relationship. Donovan writes his final letter to Turner, and dies shortly after. \n\nIn the present, Turner says he does not know whether or not Donovan's death was related to the scandal. Newhouse muses that she initially dismissed Turner's book as \"[[First World problem|mishaps from the First World]],\" but has reconsidered based on their meeting.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kit Harington]] as John F.

Donovan''''' is a Canadian [[drama film|drama]] film, co-written, co-produced, and directed by [[Xavier Dolan]] in his [[English language|English]]-language debut. It stars [[Kit Harington]], [[Jacob Tremblay]], [[Natalie Portman]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Kathy Bates]], [[Thandie Newton]], [[Ben Schnetzer]], and [[Jared Keeso]]. The film deals with themes of [[celebrity]], [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid media]] in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], mother-son relationships, and [[homosexuality]].\n\nIt is presented as three different sequences of scenes interspersed during the film: a series set in 2017 showing a young actor who reminisces about the written correspondence he shared as a child with an American TV star who died since then, and two other series set in the mid-2000s depicting the lives of both characters at the time of the correspondence. \n\n''The Death & Life of John F. Donovan'' had its world premiere at the [[2018 Toronto International Film Festival]], making it Dolan's first film to premiere at the festival. The film was critically panned, with many critics labeling it as \"bland\" and \"pretentious.\"<ref name=\"rottentomatoes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_death_and_life_of_john_f_donovan/|title=The Death and Life of John F.

The book collects letters he received from John F. Donovan, an actor with whom he corresponded with as a child, and who died from a [[drug overdose]]. \n\nIn a flashback to the mid-2000s, Turner is a [[child actor]] who is bullied by his [[Homophobia|homophobic]] schoolmates. He idolizes Donovan, who plays the lead character in the teen drama series ''Hellsome High''. The tabloid press frequently speculates that Donovan is gay and [[closeted]]; when gossip regarding Donovan soliciting male prostitutes makes headlines, his correspondence with Turner is made public, sparking malicious speculation about the nature of Turner and Donovan's relationship. Donovan writes his final letter to Turner, and dies shortly after. \n\nIn the present, Turner says he does not know whether or not Donovan's death was related to the scandal. Newhouse muses that she initially dismissed Turner's book as \"[[First World problem|mishaps from the First World]],\" but has reconsidered based on their meeting.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kit Harington]] as John F.

Dark Centuries), she became an important figure of the Galician [[Spanish Romance literature|Romantic]] movement, known today as the ''Rexurdimento'' (\"Renaissance\"), along with [[Manuel Curros Enr\u00edquez]] and [[Eduardo Pondal]]. Her poetry is marked by ''[[saudade]]'', an almost ineffable combination of nostalgia, longing and melancholy.\n\nShe married [[Manuel Murgu\u00eda]], a member of the important literary group known as the [[Real Academia Galega|Royal Galician Academy]], [[historian]], [[journalist]] and editor of Rosal\u00eda's books. The couple had seven children: Alexandra (1859\u20131937), Aura (1868\u20131942), twins Gala (1871\u20131964) and Ovidio (1871\u20131900), Amara (1873\u20131921), Adriano (1875\u20131876) and Valentina (stillborn, 1877). Only two of Rosal\u00eda's children married, Aura in 1897 and Gala in 1922; neither they nor their siblings left any children, and thus, today there are no living descendants of Rosal\u00eda de Castro and her husband. Their son Ovidio was a promising painter, his career cut short by early death.\n\nRosal\u00eda published her first collection of poetry in Galician, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Cantares gallegos|gl}}'' (\"Galician Songs\"), on 17 May 1863. This date, 17 May, is now known as the ''[[D\u00eda das Letras Galegas]]'' (\"Galician Literature Day\"), and commemorates Rosal\u00eda's achievement by dedicating, every year, this special day to a different writer, who must also write in the Galician language, since 1963. [[D\u00eda das Letras Galegas]] is an official holiday in the Autonomous Community of Galicia.\n\nRelative poverty and sadness marked Rosal\u00eda's life, in spite of this, she had a strong sense of commitment to the poor and to the defenseless. She was a strong opponent of authoritative abuse or [[abuse of authority]] and an ardent defender of women's rights. Rosal\u00eda suffered from uterine cancer and died in Padr\u00f3n, province of A Coru\u00f1a, Spain, on 15 July 1885.\n\nShe is buried in the ''Pante\u00f3n de Galegos Ilustres'', a pantheon (mausoleum) in the [[Convent of San Domingos de Bonaval]] in Santiago de Compostela, Spain.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Rosalia de Castro Padr\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|Statue of Rosal\u00eda de Castro at [[Padr\u00f3n]].]]\n\nRosal\u00eda de Castro is today one of the unquestionable poets laureate of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].  Highly educated, expected to speak and write in Spanish and Galician she took the bold, unconventional step of writing her early poems in the Galician language.  Her defiance earned her the contempt and spite of many that deemed Galician as a Spanish dialect fit \"only for the illiterate and the churlish\". However, Rosal\u00eda's defiant gesture won her the love and admiration of the common folk, who spoke Galician at home or on a daily basis.

Today, it is possible to find schools and universities named after the writer in the Spanish Autonomous Region of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] as well as other parts of [[Spain]]. [[Russia]], [[Venezuela]] ([[Teatro Rosal\u00eda de Castro]]) and [[Uruguay]] also have places that bear the name of this distinguished poet. Furthermore, there are numerous parks, plazas and streets, cultural associations, prizes granted to people that are intimately linked with the Galician and Spanish languages, libraries, folk groups, choirs, and even a wine with the name ''R\u00edas Baixas.'' There is also a plane from the airline [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]], as well as an aircraft belonging to the [[Maritime Safety and Rescue Society]] (''Salvamento Mar\u00edtimo),'' have been given the name of Rosal\u00eda de Castro. Moreover, there are a multitude of monuments, commemorative plaques and sculptures dedicated to her in many parts of the world.\n\nOn 23 October 1979, the last of the [[Banknotes of the Spanish peseta|500 peseta bills]] was printed, being that in 1987, this bill was to be substituted by a [[Spanish peseta|coin]] of the same value. The bill had the portrait of Rosal\u00eda de Castro displayed on the obverse side, created by Pablo Sampedro Moledo:  on the reverse side were the House/Museum of Rosal\u00eda located in Padr\u00f3n and a few handwritten verses from Rosal\u00eda de Castro's work ''Follas Novas.'' With the printing of this bill, Rosal\u00eda de Castro became, excepting [[Isabella I of Castile]], the only non-allegorical female to be placed on the obverse side of a Spanish bill.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bde.es/webbde/es/billemone/peseta/peseta.pdf|title=Breve historia de la Peseta (Ic\u00f3nografia)|publisher=Real Casa de la Moneda|access-date=3 December 2016|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412180143/http://www.bde.es/webbde/es/billemone/peseta/peseta.pdf|archivedate=12 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bde.es/bde/en/areas/billemone/Publico_general/Billetes_y_moned/|title=Banco de Espa\u00f1a \u2013 Banknotes and coins \u2013 General public \u2013 Peseta banknotes and coins|website=www.bde.es|access-date=2016-12-03}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Rosal\u00eda e familia por Juan Palmeiro e fillos, A Matanza. 1883-4.jpg|thumb|225px|1884 (J.

Dark Centuries), she became an important figure of the Galician [[Spanish Romance literature|Romantic]] movement, known today as the ''Rexurdimento'' (\"Renaissance\"), along with [[Manuel Curros Enr\u00edquez]] and [[Eduardo Pondal]]. Her poetry is marked by ''[[saudade]]'', an almost ineffable combination of nostalgia, longing and melancholy.\n\nShe married [[Manuel Murgu\u00eda]], a member of the important literary group known as the [[Real Academia Galega|Royal Galician Academy]], [[historian]], [[journalist]] and editor of Rosal\u00eda's books. The couple had seven children: Alexandra (1859\u20131937), Aura (1868\u20131942), twins Gala (1871\u20131964) and Ovidio (1871\u20131900), Amara (1873\u20131921), Adriano (1875\u20131876) and Valentina (stillborn, 1877). Only two of Rosal\u00eda's children married, Aura in 1897 and Gala in 1922; neither they nor their siblings left any children, and thus, today there are no living descendants of Rosal\u00eda de Castro and her husband. Their son Ovidio was a promising painter, his career cut short by early death.\n\nRosal\u00eda published her first collection of poetry in Galician, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Cantares gallegos|gl}}'' (\"Galician Songs\"), on 17 May 1863. This date, 17 May, is now known as the ''[[D\u00eda das Letras Galegas]]'' (\"Galician Literature Day\"), and commemorates Rosal\u00eda's achievement by dedicating, every year, this special day to a different writer, who must also write in the Galician language, since 1963. [[D\u00eda das Letras Galegas]] is an official holiday in the Autonomous Community of Galicia.\n\nRelative poverty and sadness marked Rosal\u00eda's life, in spite of this, she had a strong sense of commitment to the poor and to the defenseless. She was a strong opponent of authoritative abuse or [[abuse of authority]] and an ardent defender of women's rights. Rosal\u00eda suffered from uterine cancer and died in Padr\u00f3n, province of A Coru\u00f1a, Spain, on 15 July 1885.\n\nShe is buried in the ''Pante\u00f3n de Galegos Ilustres'', a pantheon (mausoleum) in the [[Convent of San Domingos de Bonaval]] in Santiago de Compostela, Spain.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Rosalia de Castro Padr\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|Statue of Rosal\u00eda de Castro at [[Padr\u00f3n]].]]\n\nRosal\u00eda de Castro is today one of the unquestionable poets laureate of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].  Highly educated, expected to speak and write in Spanish and Galician she took the bold, unconventional step of writing her early poems in the Galician language.  Her defiance earned her the contempt and spite of many that deemed Galician as a Spanish dialect fit \"only for the illiterate and the churlish\". However, Rosal\u00eda's defiant gesture won her the love and admiration of the common folk, who spoke Galician at home or on a daily basis.

Today, it is possible to find schools and universities named after the writer in the Spanish Autonomous Region of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] as well as other parts of [[Spain]]. [[Russia]], [[Venezuela]] ([[Teatro Rosal\u00eda de Castro]]) and [[Uruguay]] also have places that bear the name of this distinguished poet. Furthermore, there are numerous parks, plazas and streets, cultural associations, prizes granted to people that are intimately linked with the Galician and Spanish languages, libraries, folk groups, choirs, and even a wine with the name ''R\u00edas Baixas.'' There is also a plane from the airline [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]], as well as an aircraft belonging to the [[Maritime Safety and Rescue Society]] (''Salvamento Mar\u00edtimo),'' have been given the name of Rosal\u00eda de Castro. Moreover, there are a multitude of monuments, commemorative plaques and sculptures dedicated to her in many parts of the world.\n\nOn 23 October 1979, the last of the [[Banknotes of the Spanish peseta|500 peseta bills]] was printed, being that in 1987, this bill was to be substituted by a [[Spanish peseta|coin]] of the same value. The bill had the portrait of Rosal\u00eda de Castro displayed on the obverse side, created by Pablo Sampedro Moledo:  on the reverse side were the House/Museum of Rosal\u00eda located in Padr\u00f3n and a few handwritten verses from Rosal\u00eda de Castro's work ''Follas Novas.'' With the printing of this bill, Rosal\u00eda de Castro became, excepting [[Isabella I of Castile]], the only non-allegorical female to be placed on the obverse side of a Spanish bill.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bde.es/webbde/es/billemone/peseta/peseta.pdf|title=Breve historia de la Peseta (Ic\u00f3nografia)|publisher=Real Casa de la Moneda|access-date=3 December 2016|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412180143/http://www.bde.es/webbde/es/billemone/peseta/peseta.pdf|archivedate=12 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bde.es/bde/en/areas/billemone/Publico_general/Billetes_y_moned/|title=Banco de Espa\u00f1a \u2013 Banknotes and coins \u2013 General public \u2013 Peseta banknotes and coins|website=www.bde.es|access-date=2016-12-03}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Rosal\u00eda e familia por Juan Palmeiro e fillos, A Matanza. 1883-4.jpg|thumb|225px|1884 (J.
