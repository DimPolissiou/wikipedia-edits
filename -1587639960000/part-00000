For a time he edited ''The National Watchman,'' an abolitionist newspaper. He was appointed a professor of [[rhetoric]] and [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek]] at [[New-York Central College]], and lectured widely on abolition, equality, and integration. Meeting and falling in love with a white student, Mary King, the couple eventually married in 1853, but decided to immediately leave the United States because of the violent prejudice against their relationship. While for a time he continued to live and lecture in both England and Ireland, and wrote an autobiographical account including of his marriage, which sold well, he and his family eventually fell into obscurity and near-poverty.<ref name=Welbourne>{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2006 |title=Allan William G|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African American History, 1619-1895 : from the colonial period to the age of Frederick Douglass |publisher=Oxford University Press |last=Welbourne |first=Penny Anne| editor-last=Finkleman |volume=1 |pages=49\u201350 |isbn=0195167775 |oclc=62430770}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nAllen was born free around 1820 in [[Urbana, Virginia]],<ref name=Blackett/>{{rp|1}} to a free mixed-race mother and a white father, both of whom died early in Allen's life.

The school was closed down due as part of the reaction to [[Nat Turner's slave rebellion]] of 1831.

He took a Scriptural view of the origin of the [[Aethiopia|Ethiopian]]s, Egyptians, and other races of ancient Africa, arguing that they were descended from the four sons of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]]; and showed from classic authority the high civilisation to which they had attained when Greece was yet barbarous, and before Rome arose. [[Herodotus]] had spoken of the Ethiopians as remarkable for their stature, longevity, and physical beauty; and although in the eyes of the white man they were not remarkable for the latter quality at present, the influence of adverse circumstances and of centuries of oppression should be taken into account. There was scarcely a race, he showed, on the face of the earth, which had not declined in intellectual power and physical beauty under the same influences, and in the medi\u00e6val ages, when Englishmen were sold as slaves, they were described by their purchasers, the Irishmen and Romans, as ugly and stupid. The lecturer then dwelt more particularly upon the leading characteristics of the African race, their religious tendency, and the predominance of the moral over the intellectual in their character\u2014the affeetionateness of their disposition, their love of humour, &c. He gave many weighty hits at Anglo-Saxon civilisation, which told well with the audience, who appeared very much delighted. He was listened to with deep attention, and loudly applauded.<ref>{{cite news\n|newspaper=[[Liverpool Mercury]] ([[Liverpool, England]])\n|date=August 26, 1857\n|title=The African Race.

He took a Scriptural view of the origin of the [[Aethiopia|Ethiopian]]s, Egyptians, and other races of ancient Africa, arguing that they were descended from the four sons of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]]; and showed from classic authority the high civilisation to which they had attained when Greece was yet barbarous, and before Rome arose. [[Herodotus]] had spoken of the Ethiopians as remarkable for their stature, longevity, and physical beauty; and although in the eyes of the white man they were not remarkable for the latter quality at present, the influence of adverse circumstances and of centuries of oppression should be taken into account. There was scarcely a race, he showed, on the face of the earth, which had not declined in intellectual power and physical beauty under the same influences, and in the medi\u00e6val ages, when Englishmen were sold as slaves, they were described by their purchasers, the Irishmen and Romans, as ugly and stupid. The lecturer then dwelt more particularly upon the leading characteristics of the African race, their religious tendency, and the predominance of the moral over the intellectual in their character\u2014the affeetionateness of their disposition, their love of humour, &c. He gave many weighty hits at Anglo-Saxon civilisation, which told well with the audience, who appeared very much delighted. He was listened to with deep attention, and loudly applauded.<ref>{{cite news\n|newspaper=[[Liverpool Mercury]] ([[Liverpool, England]])\n|date=August 26, 1857\n|title=The African Race.

His professional career began as a teenager in the late 1950s, playing a variety of instruments including guitar, [[harmonica]], keyboards and saxophone for various [[Irish showband]]s, covering the popular hits of that time. Van Morrison rose to prominence in the mid-1960s as the [[lead vocalist|lead singer]] of the Northern Irish [[R&B]] band, [[Them (band)|Them]], with whom he recorded the [[garage band]] classic \"[[Gloria (Them song)|Gloria]]\". His solo career began in 1967, under the pop-hit oriented guidance of [[Bert Berns]] with the release of the hit single \"[[Brown Eyed Girl]]\". After Berns's death, [[Warner Bros.

This theme has become one of the predominant qualities of his work.<ref name=\"CollisPage 149\">Collis (1996), page 149.</ref>\n\nHis lyrics show an influence of the visionary poets [[William Blake]] and [[W.

The words may often be prosaic, and so can hardly be poetry.\"<ref name=\"CollisPage12\">Collis (1996), page 10.</ref>\n\nMorrison has described his songwriting method by remarking that: \"I write from a different place.

This theme has become one of the predominant qualities of his work.<ref name=\"CollisPage 149\">Collis (1996), page 149.</ref>\n\nHis lyrics show an influence of the visionary poets [[William Blake]] and [[W.

The words may often be prosaic, and so can hardly be poetry.\"<ref name=\"CollisPage12\">Collis (1996), page 10.</ref>\n\nMorrison has described his songwriting method by remarking that: \"I write from a different place.

After General [[George Washington]]'s [[George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River|crossing of the Delaware River]] north of Trenton the previous night, Washington led the main body of the [[Continental Army]] against [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]] auxiliaries garrisoned at Trenton. After a brief battle, almost two-thirds of the Hessian force was captured, with negligible losses to the Americans. The battle significantly boosted the Continental Army's waning morale, and inspired re-enlistments. \n\nThe Continental Army had previously [[New York and New Jersey campaign|suffered several defeats]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] and had been forced to retreat through New Jersey to [[Pennsylvania]]. Morale in the army was low; to end the year on a positive note, George Washington\u2014Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army\u2014devised a plan to cross the [[Delaware River]] on the night of December&nbsp;25\u201326 and surround the Hessians' garrison.\n\nBecause the river was icy and the weather severe, the crossing proved dangerous. Two detachments were unable to cross the river, leaving Washington with only 2,400 men under his command in the assault, 3,000 fewer than planned. The army marched {{convert|9|mi|km|1}} south to Trenton. The Hessians had lowered their guard, thinking they were safe from the Americans' army, and had no long-distance outposts or patrols. Washington's forces caught them off guard, and after a short but fierce resistance, most of the Hessians surrendered and were captured, with just over a third escaping across [[Assunpink Creek]].\n\nDespite the battle's small numbers, the U.S. victory inspired rebels in [[Thirteen Colonies|the colonies]].  With the success of the ongoing revolution in doubt a week earlier, the army had seemed on the verge of collapse. The dramatic victory inspired soldiers to serve longer and attracted new recruits to the ranks.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|New York and New Jersey campaign}}\n\nIn early December 1776, American morale was very low.<ref name=\"bh55\" /> The Americans had been [[Battle of Long Island|ousted from New York]] by the British and their Hessian auxiliaries, and the Continental Army was forced to retreat across New Jersey. Ninety percent of the Continental Army soldiers who had served at Long Island were gone.<ref name=\"Savas84\" /> Men had deserted, feeling that the cause for independence was lost.  Washington, Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, expressed some doubts, writing to his cousin in Virginia, \"I think the game is pretty near up.\"<ref name=\"ketch235\"/>\n\nAt the time a small town in New Jersey, Trenton, was occupied by four regiments of Hessian soldiers (numbering about 1,400 men) commanded by Colonel [[Johann Rall]].  Washington's force comprised 2,400 men, with infantry divisions commanded by Major Generals [[Nathanael Greene]] and [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]], and artillery under the direction of Brigadier General [[Henry Knox]].<ref>Stanhope p. 129</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Intelligence ===\n\nGeorge Washington had stationed a spy named [[John Honeyman]], posing as a [[Tory]], in Trenton.  Honeyman had served with Major General [[James Wolfe]] in Quebec at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] on September 13, 1759, and had no trouble establishing his credentials as a Tory.  Honeyman was a butcher and bartender, who traded with the British and Hessians.  This enabled him to gather intelligence and to convince the Hessians that the Continental Army was in such a low state of morale that they would not attack Trenton.  Shortly before Christmas, he arranged to be captured by the Continental Army, who had orders to bring him to Washington unharmed.  After being questioned by Washington, he was imprisoned in a hut to be tried as a Tory in the morning, but a small fire broke out nearby, enabling him to \"escape\".<ref>{{Citation | last=Van Dyke | first=John | title=An Unwritten Account of a Spy of Washington | journal=Our Home | year=1873}}</ref>\n\n===U.S. plan ===\n[[File:Battle-of-Trenton.jpg|thumb|250px|The U.S. plan of attack under Washington]]\nThe U.S. plan relied on launching coordinated attacks from three directions. General [[John Cadwalader (general)|John Cadwalader]] would launch a diversionary attack against the British garrison at [[Bordentown, New Jersey]], to block off reinforcements from the south. General [[James Ewing (Pennsylvania)|James Ewing]] would take 700 militia across the river at Trenton Ferry, seize the bridge over the Assunpink Creek and prevent enemy troops from escaping. The main assault force of 2,400 men would cross the river {{cvt|9|mi}} north of Trenton and split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, to launch a pre-dawn attack.<ref name=\"bh56\">Brooks p. 56</ref> Sullivan would attack the town from the south, and Greene from the north.<ref name=\"Savas84\">Savas p. 84</ref> Depending on the success of the operation, the Americans would possibly follow up with separate attacks on [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] and [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]].<ref name=\"bh55\">Brooks p. 55</ref>\n\nDuring the week before the battle, U.S. advance parties began to ambush enemy cavalry patrols, capturing dispatch riders and attacking Hessian pickets.  The Hessian commander, to emphasize the danger to his men, sent 100 infantry and an artillery detachment to deliver a letter to the British commander at Princeton.<ref name=\"bh55\"/> Washington ordered Ewing and his Pennsylvania militia to try to gain information on Hessian movements and technology.<ref name=\"Fischer195\">Fischer p. 195</ref> Ewing instead made three successful raids across the river. On December 17 and 18, 1776, they attacked an outpost of [[j\u00e4ger (military)|j\u00e4ger]]s and on the 21st, they set fire to several houses.<ref name=\"Fischer195\"/>  Washington put constant watches on all possible crossings near the Continental Army encampment on the Delaware, as he believed [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] would launch an attack from the north on Philadelphia if the river froze over.<ref>Ketchum p. 242</ref>\n\nOn December 20, 1776, some 2,000 troops led by General Sullivan arrived in Washington's camp.<ref name=\"Savas83\">Savas p. 83</ref> They had been under the command of [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]] and had been moving slowly through northern New Jersey when Lee was captured.  That same day, an additional 800 troops arrived from [[Fort Ticonderoga]] under the command of [[Horatio Gates]].<ref name=\"Savas83\"/>\n\n=== Hessian moves ===\n[[File:Battle-trenton-sketch-rochambeau.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Hessian Sketch of the Battle of Trenton]]\nOn December 14, 1776, the Hessians arrived in Trenton to establish their winter quarters.<ref>Fischer p. 188</ref>  At the time, Trenton was a small town with about 99 houses and two main streets, King (now Warren) Street and Queen (now Broad) Street.<ref>Ketchum p. 233</ref> [[Carl von Donop]], Rall's superior, had marched south to [[Mount Holly, New Jersey|Mount Holly]] on December 22 to deal with the resistance in New Jersey, and had [[Battle of Iron Works Hill|clashed]] with some New Jersey militia there on December 23.<ref>Rosenfeld p. 177</ref>\n\nDonop, who despised Rall, was reluctant to give command of Trenton to him.<ref name=\"Ketchum229\">Ketchum p. 229</ref> Rall was known to be loud and unacquainted with the English language,<ref name=\"Ketchum229\" /> but he was also a 36-year soldier with a great deal of battle experience. His request for reinforcements had been turned down by British commander General [[James Grant (British Army officer)|James Grant]], who disdained the American rebels and thought them poor soldiers.  Despite Rall's experience, the Hessians at Trenton did not admire their commander.<ref name=\"Lengel183\">Lengel p. 183</ref> They believed that he was too nice and not ruthless enough to be successful.<ref name=\"Lengel183\"/> His officers complained, \"His love of life was too great, a thought came to him, then another, so he could not settle on a firm decision&nbsp;...\"<ref name=\"Lengel185\">Lengel p. 185</ref> Rall avoided hard work and had little concern for his troops' comfort.<ref name=\"Lengel185\"/>\n\nTrenton lacked city walls or fortifications, which was typical of U.S. settlements.<ref name=\"fish189\">Fischer p. 189</ref>  Some Hessian officers advised Rall to fortify the town, and two of his engineers advised that a [[redoubt]] be constructed at the upper end of town and fortifications be built along the river.<ref name=\"fish189\" /> The engineers went so far as to draw up plans, but Rall disagreed with them.<ref name=\"fish189\" /> When Rall was again urged to fortify the town, he replied, \"Let them come&nbsp;... We will go at them with the bayonet.\"<ref name=\"fish189\" />\n\nAs Christmas approached, [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] came to Trenton to report the Americans were planning action.<ref name=\"ketch235\">Ketchum p. 235</ref> U.S. deserters told the Hessians that rations were being prepared for an advance across the river. Rall publicly dismissed such talk as nonsense, but privately in letters to his superiors, he said he was worried about an imminent attack.<ref name=\"ketch235\" /> He wrote to Donop that he was \"liable to be attacked at any moment\". Rall said that Trenton was \"indefensible\" and asked that British troops establish a garrison in Maidenhead (now [[Lawrenceville, New Jersey|Lawrenceville]]).  Close to Trenton, this would help defend the roads from Americans. His request was denied.<ref>Fischer p. 197</ref> As the Americans disrupted Hessian supply lines, the officers started to share Rall's fears. One wrote, \"We have not slept one night in peace since we came to this place.\"<ref name=\"ketch236\">Ketchum p. 236</ref> On December 22, 1776, a spy reported to Grant that Washington had called a council of war; Grant told Rall to \"be on your guard\".<ref>Fischer p. 203</ref>\n\nThe main Hessian force of 1,500 men was divided into three regiments: Knyphausen, Lossberg and Rall. That night, they did not send out any patrols because of the severe weather.<ref>Wood p. 65</ref>\n\n=== Crossing and march ===\n{{main|George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River}}\n[[File:1819 Passage OfThe Delaware byThomasSully MFABoston.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|''[[The Passage of the Delaware]]'', by [[Thomas Sully]], 1819 ([[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]]]\nBefore Washington and his troops left, [[Benjamin Rush]] came to cheer up the general. While he was there, he saw a note Washington had written, saying, \"Victory or Death\".<ref name=\"ketch236\" /> Those words would be the password for the surprise attack.<ref>McCullough p. 273</ref> Each soldier carried 60 rounds of ammunition, and three days of rations.<ref>McCullough p. 274</ref>  When the army arrived at the shores of the Delaware, they were already behind schedule, and clouds began to form above them.<ref name=\"fish212\">Fischer p. 212</ref> It began to rain.  As the air's temperature dropped, the rain changed to sleet, and then to snow.<ref name=\"fish212\" />  The Americans began to cross the river, with John Glover in command.  The men went across in [[Durham boat]]s, while the horses and artillery went across on large ferries.<ref name=\"Ferling p.176\">Ferling p. 176</ref> The [[14th Continental Regiment]] of Glover manned the boats.  During the crossing, several men fell overboard, including Colonel [[John Haslet]].  Haslet was quickly pulled out of the water.  No one died during the crossing, and all the artillery pieces made it over in good condition.<ref>Fischer p. 219</ref>\n\nTwo small detachments of infantry of about 40 men each were ordered ahead of main columns.<ref name=\"fish221\">Fischer p. 221</ref> They set roadblocks ahead of the main army and were to take prisoner whoever came into or left the town.<ref name=\"fish221\"/> One of the groups was sent north of Trenton, and the other was sent to block River Road, which ran along the Delaware River to Trenton.<ref>Fischer p. 222</ref>\n\n[[Image:Washingtons Crossing Park Cannon.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=Photo shows an 18th-century cannon, probably a 3-pounder, with an old stone building and the Delaware River in the background.|Cannon at Washington's Crossing Historic Park]]\nThe terrible weather conditions delayed the landings in New Jersey until 3:00&nbsp;am; the plan was that they were supposed to be completed by 12:00&nbsp;am.  Washington realized it would be impossible to launch a pre-dawn attack. Another setback occurred for the Americans, as generals Cadwalader and Ewing were unable to join the attack because of the weather conditions.<ref name=\"bh56\" />\n\nAt 4:00&nbsp;am, the soldiers began to march towards Trenton.<ref>Fischer p. 223</ref> Along the way, several civilians joined as volunteers and led as guides (such as [[John Mott (captain)|John Mott]]) because of their knowledge of the terrain.<ref>Fischer p. 225</ref> After marching {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} through winding roads into the wind, they reached Bear Tavern, where they turned right.<ref name=\"fish26\">Fischer p. 226</ref> The ground was slippery, but it was level, making it easier for the horses and artillery.  They began to make better time.<ref name=\"fish26\" /> They soon reached [[Jacobs Creek (New Jersey)|Jacobs Creek]], where, with difficulty, the Americans made it across.<ref>Fischer p. 227</ref> The two groups stayed together until they reached Birmingham, where they split apart.<ref name=\"Savas84\"/> Soon after, they reached the house of Benjamin Moore, where the family offered food and drink to Washington.<ref name=\"fish28\">Fischer p. 228</ref> At this point, the first signs of daylight began to appear.<ref name=\"fish28\" /> Many of the troops did not have boots, so they were forced to wear rags around their feet. Some of the men's feet bled, turning the snow to a dark red.

Led by [[Adam Stephen]], they had not known about the plan to attack Trenton and had attacked a Hessian outpost.<ref name=\"fish32\">Fischer p. 232</ref>  Washington feared the Hessians would have been put on guard, and shouted at Stephen, \"You sir! You Sir, may have ruined all my plans by having them put on their guard.\"<ref name=\"fish32\" /> Despite this, Washington ordered the advance continue to Trenton. In the event, Rall thought the first raid was the attack which Grant had warned him about, and that there would be no further action that day.<ref>McCullough p. 279</ref>\n\n== Battle ==\n{{see also|Order of battle of the Battle of Trenton}}\n\n===U.S. attack===\n[[File:Battle of Trenton.Dean.USMA.edu.history.gif|thumb|right|300px|The Battle of Trenton, December 26, 1776]]\nAt 8 am, the outpost was set up by the Hessians at a cooper shop on Pennington Road about one mile northwest of Trenton.  Washington led the assault, riding in front of his soldiers.<ref name=\"fish235\">Fischer p. 235</ref> As the Hessian commander of the outpost, Lieutenant Andreas Wiederholdt, left the shop, an American fired at him but missed.<ref name=\"fish235\" />  Wiederholdt immediately shouted, ''\"Der Feind!\"'' (The Enemy!) and other Hessians came out.<ref name=\"fish237\">Fischer p. 237</ref> The Americans fired three volleys, and the Hessians returned one of their own.<ref name=\"fish235\" />  Washington ordered [[Edward Hand]]'s Pennsylvania Riflemen and a battalion of German-speaking infantry to block the road that led to Princeton.  They attacked the Hessian outpost there.<ref name=\"fish237\" /> Wiederholdt soon realized that this was more than a raiding party; seeing other Hessians retreating from the outpost, he led his men to do the same.<ref>Andreas Wiederholdt (edited by M.D. Learned and C. Grosse): ''Tagebuch des Capt. Wiederholdt Vom 7 Oktober bis 7 December 1780''; The MacMillan Co, New York, ~1862; reprinted by the University of Michigan Library, 17 August 2015</ref>  Both Hessian detachments made organized retreats, firing as they fell back.<ref name=\"fish237\" />  On the high ground at the north end of Trenton, they were joined by a duty company from the Lossberg Regiment.<ref name=\"fish237\" />  They engaged the Americans, retreating slowly, keeping up continuous fire and using houses for cover.<ref>Ketchum p. 255</ref>  Once in Trenton, they gained covering fire from other Hessian guard companies on the outskirts of the town. Another guard company nearer to the Delaware River rushed east to their aid, leaving open the River Road into Trenton.  Washington ordered the escape route to Princeton be cut off, sending infantry in battle formation to block it, while artillery formed at the head of King and Queen streets.<ref>Ketchum p. 256</ref>\n\nLeading the southern U.S. column, General Sullivan entered Trenton by the abandoned River Road and blocked the only crossing over the Assunpink Creek to cut off the Hessian escape.<ref name=\"wood68\">Wood p. 68</ref> Sullivan briefly held up his advance to make sure Greene's division had time to drive the Hessians from their outposts in the north.<ref name=\"wood68\" />  Soon after, they continued their advance, attacking the Hermitage, home of [[Philemon Dickinson]], where 50 j\u00e4gers under the command of Lieutenant von Grothausen were stationed.<ref name=\"wood68\" /> Lieutenant von Grothausen brought 12 of his j\u00e4gers into action against the advanced guard but had only advanced a few hundred yards when he saw a column of Americans advancing to the Hermitage.<ref name=\"wood68\" />  Pulling back to the Hessian barracks, he was joined by the rest of the j\u00e4gers.  After the exchange of one volley, they turned and ran, some trying to swim across the creek, while others escaped over the bridge, which had not yet been cut off.  The 20 British [[Dragoon|dragoons]] also fled.<ref name=\"wood68\" /> As Greene and Sullivan's columns pushed into the town, Washington moved to high ground north of King and Queens streets to see the action and direct his troops.<ref>McCullough p. 280</ref>  By this time, U.S. artillery from the other side of the Delaware River had come into action, devastating the Hessian positions.<ref>Fischer p. 239</ref>\n\nWith the sounding of the alarm, the three Hessian regiments began to prepare for battle.<ref name=\"fish240\">Fischer p. 240</ref>  The Rall regiment formed on lower King Street along with the Lossberg regiment, while the Knyphausen regiment formed at the lower end of Queen Street.<ref name=\"fish240\" />  Lieutenant Piel, Rall's brigade adjutant, woke his commander, who found that the rebels had taken the \"V\" of the main streets of the town.  This is where the engineers had recommended building a redoubt.  Rall ordered his regiment to form up at the lower end of King Street, the Lossberg regiment to prepare for an advance up Queen Street, and the Knyphausen regiment to stand by as a reserve for Rall's advance up King Street.<ref name=\"wood68\" />\n\nThe U.S. cannon stationed at the head of the two main streets soon came into action.  In reply, Rall directed his regiment, supported by a few companies of the Lossberg regiment, to clear the guns.<ref name=\"wood70\">Wood p. 70</ref>  The Hessians formed ranks and began to advance up the street, but their formations were quickly broken by the U.S. guns and fire from Mercer's men who had taken houses on the left side of the street.<ref name=\"wood70\" />  Breaking ranks, the Hessians fled.  Rall ordered two three-pound cannon into action.  After getting off six rounds each, within just a few minutes, half of the Hessians manning their guns were killed by the U.S. cannon.<ref name=\"wood70\" />  After the men fled to cover behind houses and fences, their cannons were taken by the Americans.<ref name=\"wood71\">Wood p. 71</ref>  Following capture of the cannon, men under the command of [[George Weedon]] advanced down King Street.<ref name=\"wood68\" />\n\nOn Queen Street, all Hessian attempts to advance up the street were repulsed by guns under the command of Thomas Forrest.  After firing four rounds each, two more Hessian guns were silenced.  One of Forrest's howitzers was put out of action with a broken axle.<ref name=\"wood68\" />  The Knyphausen regiment became separated from the Lossberg and the Rall regiments. The Lossberg and the Rall regiments fell back to a field outside of town, taking heavy losses from [[grapeshot]] and musket fire. In the southern part of the town, Americans under command of Sullivan began to overwhelm the Hessians.  [[John Stark]] led a bayonet charge at the Knyphausen regiment, whose resistance broke because their weapons would not fire.  Sullivan led a column of men to block off escape of troops across the creek.<ref name=\"wood71\" />\n\n===Hessian resistance collapses===\nThe Hessians in the field attempted to reorganize and make one last attempt to retake the town so they could make a breakout.<ref name=\"Wood p.72\">Wood p. 72</ref> Rall decided to attack the U.S. flank on the heights north of the town.<ref name=\"fish246\">Fischer p. 246</ref> Rall yelled \"Forward! Advance! Advance!\", and the Hessians began to move, with the brigade's band playing fifes, bugles and drums to help the Hessians' spirit.<ref name=\"fish246\" /><ref>Ketchum p. 262</ref>\n\nWashington, still on high ground, saw the Hessians approaching the U.S. flank. He moved his troops to assume battle formation against the enemy.<ref name=\"fish246\" />  The two Hessian regiments began marching toward King Street but were caught in U.S. fire that came at them from three directions.<ref name=\"fish246\" /> Some Americans had taken up defensive positions inside houses, reducing their exposure.  Some civilians joined the fight against the Hessians.<ref name=\"fish249\">Fischer p. 249</ref>  Despite this, they continued to push, recapturing their cannon.  At the head of King Street, Knox saw the Hessians had retaken the cannon and ordered his troops to take them.  Six men ran and, after a brief struggle, seized the cannon, turning them on the Hessians.<ref name=\"fish247\">Fischer p. 247</ref>  With most of the Hessians unable to fire their guns, the attack stalled. The Hessians' formations broke, and they began to scatter.<ref name=\"fish249\" /> Rall was mortally wounded.<ref>Fischer p. 248</ref> Washington led his troops down from high ground while yelling, \"March on, my brave fellows, after me!\"<ref name=\"fish249\" />  Most of the Hessians retreated into an orchard, with the Americans in close pursuit.  Quickly surrounded,<ref name=\"fish251\">Fischer p. 251</ref> the Hessians were offered terms of surrender, to which they agreed.\n\nAlthough ordered to join Rall, the remains of the Knyphausen regiment mistakenly marched in the opposite direction.<ref name=\"fish251\" /> They tried to escape across the bridge but found it had been taken. The Americans quickly swept in, defeating a Hessian attempt to break through their lines.  Surrounded by Sullivan's men, the regiment surrendered, just minutes after the rest of the brigade.<ref name=\"wood74\">Wood p. 74</ref>\n\n===Casualties and capture===\n[[File:Henry-revolutionary-war.jpg|thumb|The engraving ''George Washington at the Battle of Trenton'' by the Illman Brothers in 1870]]\nThe Hessian forces lost 22 killed in action, 83 wounded, and 896 captured{{ndash}}including the wounded.<ref>Fischer p. 254</ref> The Americans suffered only two deaths during the march and five wounded from battle, including a near-fatal shoulder wound to future president [[James Monroe]].

In 1777 they were moved to Virginia.<ref>Fischer p. 379</ref>  Rall was mortally wounded and died later that night at his headquarters.<ref name=Fischer255/>  All four Hessian colonels in Trenton were killed in the battle. The Lossberg regiment was effectively removed from the British forces. Parts of the Knyphausen regiment escaped to the south, but Sullivan captured some 200 additional men, along with the regiment's cannon and supplies. They also captured approximately 1,000 arms and much-needed ammunition.<ref>Mitchell p. 43</ref> The Americans also captured their entire store of provisions\u2014tons of flour, dried and salted meats, ale and other liquors, as well as shoes, boots, clothing and bedding\u2014things that were as much needed by the ragtag Continental forces as weapons and horses.\n\nAmong those captured by the Patriots was [[Christian Strenge]], later to become a schoolmaster and [[fraktur (folk art)|fraktur]] artist in Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"selftaughtgenius\">{{Cite web|url=http://selftaughtgenius.org/reads/johann-christian-strenge|title=Johann Christian Strenge \u2013 Self-Taught Genius|first=|last=Brooklyn United|website=selftaughtgenius.org|accessdate=Apr 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Hessian drinking===\nAn officer in Washington's staff wrote before the battle, \"They make a great deal of Christmas in Germany, and no doubt the Hessians will drink a great deal of beer and have a dance to-night.

However, historian [[David Hackett Fischer]] quotes Patriot John Greenwood, who fought in the battle and supervised Hessians afterward, who wrote, \"I am certain not a drop of liquor was drunk during the whole night, nor, as I could see, even a piece of bread eaten.\"<ref>Fischer p. 426</ref> Military historian [[Edward G. Lengel]] wrote, \"The Germans were dazed and tired but there is no truth to the legend claiming that they were helplessly drunk.\"<ref>Lengel p. 186</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter the Hessians' surrender, Washington is reported to have shaken the hand of a young officer and said, \"This is a glorious day for our country.\"<ref>Ferling p. 178</ref>  On December 28, General Washington interviewed Lieutenant (later Colonel) Andreas Wiederhold, who detailed the failures of Rall's preparation.<ref>Andreas Wiederholdt (edited by M.D. Learned and C.

The Patriot victory gave the [[Continental Congress]] new confidence, as it proved colonial forces could defeat regulars. It also increased re-enlistments in the Continental Army forces. By defeating a European army, the colonials reduced the fear which the Hessians had caused earlier that year after the fighting in New York.<ref name=\"Wood p.72\"/>  Howe was stunned that the Patriots so easily surprised and overwhelmed the Hessian garrison.<ref name=\"wood74\" />  Colonial support for the rebellion was further buoyed significantly at this time by writings of [[Thomas Paine]] and additional successful actions by the New Jersey Militia.<ref>Fischer p. 143</ref>\n\nTwo notable U.S. officers were wounded: [[William Washington]], cousin of General Washington, and Lieutenant [[James Monroe]], the future [[President of the United States]].

After General [[George Washington]]'s [[George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River|crossing of the Delaware River]] north of Trenton the previous night, Washington led the main body of the [[Continental Army]] against [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]] auxiliaries garrisoned at Trenton. After a brief battle, almost two-thirds of the Hessian force was captured, with negligible losses to the Americans. The battle significantly boosted the Continental Army's waning morale, and inspired re-enlistments. \n\nThe Continental Army had previously [[New York and New Jersey campaign|suffered several defeats]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] and had been forced to retreat through New Jersey to [[Pennsylvania]]. Morale in the army was low; to end the year on a positive note, George Washington\u2014Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army\u2014devised a plan to cross the [[Delaware River]] on the night of December&nbsp;25\u201326 and surround the Hessians' garrison.\n\nBecause the river was icy and the weather severe, the crossing proved dangerous. Two detachments were unable to cross the river, leaving Washington with only 2,400 men under his command in the assault, 3,000 fewer than planned. The army marched {{convert|9|mi|km|1}} south to Trenton. The Hessians had lowered their guard, thinking they were safe from the Americans' army, and had no long-distance outposts or patrols. Washington's forces caught them off guard, and after a short but fierce resistance, most of the Hessians surrendered and were captured, with just over a third escaping across [[Assunpink Creek]].\n\nDespite the battle's small numbers, the U.S. victory inspired rebels in [[Thirteen Colonies|the colonies]].  With the success of the ongoing revolution in doubt a week earlier, the army had seemed on the verge of collapse. The dramatic victory inspired soldiers to serve longer and attracted new recruits to the ranks.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|New York and New Jersey campaign}}\n\nIn early December 1776, American morale was very low.<ref name=\"bh55\" /> The Americans had been [[Battle of Long Island|ousted from New York]] by the British and their Hessian auxiliaries, and the Continental Army was forced to retreat across New Jersey. Ninety percent of the Continental Army soldiers who had served at Long Island were gone.<ref name=\"Savas84\" /> Men had deserted, feeling that the cause for independence was lost.  Washington, Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, expressed some doubts, writing to his cousin in Virginia, \"I think the game is pretty near up.\"<ref name=\"ketch235\"/>\n\nAt the time a small town in New Jersey, Trenton, was occupied by four regiments of Hessian soldiers (numbering about 1,400 men) commanded by Colonel [[Johann Rall]].  Washington's force comprised 2,400 men, with infantry divisions commanded by Major Generals [[Nathanael Greene]] and [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]], and artillery under the direction of Brigadier General [[Henry Knox]].<ref>Stanhope p. 129</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Intelligence ===\n\nGeorge Washington had stationed a spy named [[John Honeyman]], posing as a [[Tory]], in Trenton.  Honeyman had served with Major General [[James Wolfe]] in Quebec at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] on September 13, 1759, and had no trouble establishing his credentials as a Tory.  Honeyman was a butcher and bartender, who traded with the British and Hessians.  This enabled him to gather intelligence and to convince the Hessians that the Continental Army was in such a low state of morale that they would not attack Trenton.  Shortly before Christmas, he arranged to be captured by the Continental Army, who had orders to bring him to Washington unharmed.  After being questioned by Washington, he was imprisoned in a hut to be tried as a Tory in the morning, but a small fire broke out nearby, enabling him to \"escape\".<ref>{{Citation | last=Van Dyke | first=John | title=An Unwritten Account of a Spy of Washington | journal=Our Home | year=1873}}</ref>\n\n===U.S. plan ===\n[[File:Battle-of-Trenton.jpg|thumb|250px|The U.S. plan of attack under Washington]]\nThe U.S. plan relied on launching coordinated attacks from three directions. General [[John Cadwalader (general)|John Cadwalader]] would launch a diversionary attack against the British garrison at [[Bordentown, New Jersey]], to block off reinforcements from the south. General [[James Ewing (Pennsylvania)|James Ewing]] would take 700 militia across the river at Trenton Ferry, seize the bridge over the Assunpink Creek and prevent enemy troops from escaping. The main assault force of 2,400 men would cross the river {{cvt|9|mi}} north of Trenton and split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, to launch a pre-dawn attack.<ref name=\"bh56\">Brooks p. 56</ref> Sullivan would attack the town from the south, and Greene from the north.<ref name=\"Savas84\">Savas p. 84</ref> Depending on the success of the operation, the Americans would possibly follow up with separate attacks on [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] and [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]].<ref name=\"bh55\">Brooks p. 55</ref>\n\nDuring the week before the battle, U.S. advance parties began to ambush enemy cavalry patrols, capturing dispatch riders and attacking Hessian pickets.  The Hessian commander, to emphasize the danger to his men, sent 100 infantry and an artillery detachment to deliver a letter to the British commander at Princeton.<ref name=\"bh55\"/> Washington ordered Ewing and his Pennsylvania militia to try to gain information on Hessian movements and technology.<ref name=\"Fischer195\">Fischer p. 195</ref> Ewing instead made three successful raids across the river. On December 17 and 18, 1776, they attacked an outpost of [[j\u00e4ger (military)|j\u00e4ger]]s and on the 21st, they set fire to several houses.<ref name=\"Fischer195\"/>  Washington put constant watches on all possible crossings near the Continental Army encampment on the Delaware, as he believed [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] would launch an attack from the north on Philadelphia if the river froze over.<ref>Ketchum p. 242</ref>\n\nOn December 20, 1776, some 2,000 troops led by General Sullivan arrived in Washington's camp.<ref name=\"Savas83\">Savas p. 83</ref> They had been under the command of [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]] and had been moving slowly through northern New Jersey when Lee was captured.  That same day, an additional 800 troops arrived from [[Fort Ticonderoga]] under the command of [[Horatio Gates]].<ref name=\"Savas83\"/>\n\n=== Hessian moves ===\n[[File:Battle-trenton-sketch-rochambeau.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Hessian Sketch of the Battle of Trenton]]\nOn December 14, 1776, the Hessians arrived in Trenton to establish their winter quarters.<ref>Fischer p. 188</ref>  At the time, Trenton was a small town with about 100 houses and two main streets, King (now Warren) Street and Queen (now Broad) Street.<ref>Ketchum p. 233</ref> [[Carl von Donop]], Rall's superior, had marched south to [[Mount Holly, New Jersey|Mount Holly]] on December 22 to deal with the resistance in New Jersey, and had [[Battle of Iron Works Hill|clashed]] with some New Jersey militia there on December 23.<ref>Rosenfeld p. 177</ref>\n\nDonop, who despised Rall, was reluctant to give command of Trenton to him.<ref name=\"Ketchum229\">Ketchum p. 229</ref> Rall was known to be loud and unacquainted with the English language,<ref name=\"Ketchum229\" /> but he was also a 36-year soldier with a great deal of battle experience. His request for reinforcements had been turned down by British commander General [[James Grant (British Army officer)|James Grant]], who disdained the American rebels and thought them poor soldiers.  Despite Rall's experience, the Hessians at Trenton did not admire their commander.<ref name=\"Lengel183\">Lengel p. 183</ref> They believed that he was too nice and not ruthless enough to be successful.<ref name=\"Lengel183\"/> His officers complained, \"His love of life was too great, a thought came to him, then another, so he could not settle on a firm decision&nbsp;...\"<ref name=\"Lengel185\">Lengel p. 185</ref> Rall avoided hard work and had little concern for his troops' comfort.<ref name=\"Lengel185\"/>\n\nTrenton lacked city walls or fortifications, which was typical of U.S. settlements.<ref name=\"fish189\">Fischer p. 189</ref>  Some Hessian officers advised Rall to fortify the town, and two of his engineers advised that a [[redoubt]] be constructed at the upper end of town and fortifications be built along the river.<ref name=\"fish189\" /> The engineers went so far as to draw up plans, but Rall disagreed with them.<ref name=\"fish189\" /> When Rall was again urged to fortify the town, he replied, \"Let them come&nbsp;... We will go at them with the bayonet.\"<ref name=\"fish189\" />\n\nAs Christmas approached, [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] came to Trenton to report the Americans were planning action.<ref name=\"ketch235\">Ketchum p. 235</ref> U.S. deserters told the Hessians that rations were being prepared for an advance across the river. Rall publicly dismissed such talk as nonsense, but privately in letters to his superiors, he said he was worried about an imminent attack.<ref name=\"ketch235\" /> He wrote to Donop that he was \"liable to be attacked at any moment\". Rall said that Trenton was \"indefensible\" and asked that British troops establish a garrison in Maidenhead (now [[Lawrenceville, New Jersey|Lawrenceville]]).  Close to Trenton, this would help defend the roads from Americans. His request was denied.<ref>Fischer p. 197</ref> As the Americans disrupted Hessian supply lines, the officers started to share Rall's fears. One wrote, \"We have not slept one night in peace since we came to this place.\"<ref name=\"ketch236\">Ketchum p. 236</ref> On December 22, 1776, a spy reported to Grant that Washington had called a council of war; Grant told Rall to \"be on your guard\".<ref>Fischer p. 203</ref>\n\nThe main Hessian force of 1,500 men was divided into three regiments: Knyphausen, Lossberg and Rall. That night, they did not send out any patrols because of the severe weather.<ref>Wood p. 65</ref>\n\n=== Crossing and march ===\n{{main|George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River}}\n[[File:1819 Passage OfThe Delaware byThomasSully MFABoston.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|''[[The Passage of the Delaware]]'', by [[Thomas Sully]], 1819 ([[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]]]\nBefore Washington and his troops left, [[Benjamin Rush]] came to cheer up the general. While he was there, he saw a note Washington had written, saying, \"Victory or Death\".<ref name=\"ketch236\" /> Those words would be the password for the surprise attack.<ref>McCullough p. 273</ref> Each soldier carried 60 rounds of ammunition, and three days of rations.<ref>McCullough p. 274</ref>  When the army arrived at the shores of the Delaware, they were already behind schedule, and clouds began to form above them.<ref name=\"fish212\">Fischer p. 212</ref> It began to rain.  As the air's temperature dropped, the rain changed to sleet, and then to snow.<ref name=\"fish212\" />  The Americans began to cross the river, with John Glover in command.  The men went across in [[Durham boat]]s, while the horses and artillery went across on large ferries.<ref name=\"Ferling p.176\">Ferling p. 176</ref> The [[14th Continental Regiment]] of Glover manned the boats.  During the crossing, several men fell overboard, including Colonel [[John Haslet]].  Haslet was quickly pulled out of the water.  No one died during the crossing, and all the artillery pieces made it over in good condition.<ref>Fischer p. 219</ref>\n\nTwo small detachments of infantry of about 40 men each were ordered ahead of main columns.<ref name=\"fish221\">Fischer p. 221</ref> They set roadblocks ahead of the main army and were to take prisoner whoever came into or left the town.<ref name=\"fish221\"/> One of the groups was sent north of Trenton, and the other was sent to block River Road, which ran along the Delaware River to Trenton.<ref>Fischer p. 222</ref>\n\n[[Image:Washingtons Crossing Park Cannon.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=Photo shows an 18th-century cannon, probably a 3-pounder, with an old stone building and the Delaware River in the background.|Cannon at Washington's Crossing Historic Park]]\nThe terrible weather conditions delayed the landings in New Jersey until 3:00&nbsp;am; the plan was that they were supposed to be completed by 12:00&nbsp;am.  Washington realized it would be impossible to launch a pre-dawn attack. Another setback occurred for the Americans, as generals Cadwalader and Ewing were unable to join the attack because of the weather conditions.<ref name=\"bh56\" />\n\nAt 4:00&nbsp;am, the soldiers began to march towards Trenton.<ref>Fischer p. 223</ref> Along the way, several civilians joined as volunteers and led as guides (such as [[John Mott (captain)|John Mott]]) because of their knowledge of the terrain.<ref>Fischer p. 225</ref> After marching {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} through winding roads into the wind, they reached Bear Tavern, where they turned right.<ref name=\"fish26\">Fischer p. 226</ref> The ground was slippery, but it was level, making it easier for the horses and artillery.  They began to make better time.<ref name=\"fish26\" /> They soon reached [[Jacobs Creek (New Jersey)|Jacobs Creek]], where, with difficulty, the Americans made it across.<ref>Fischer p. 227</ref> The two groups stayed together until they reached Birmingham, where they split apart.<ref name=\"Savas84\"/> Soon after, they reached the house of Benjamin Moore, where the family offered food and drink to Washington.<ref name=\"fish28\">Fischer p. 228</ref> At this point, the first signs of daylight began to appear.<ref name=\"fish28\" /> Many of the troops did not have boots, so they were forced to wear rags around their feet. Some of the men's feet bled, turning the snow to a dark red. Two men died on the march.<ref>Scheer p. 215</ref>\n\nAs they marched, Washington rode up and down the line, encouraging the men to continue.<ref name=\"Ferling p.176\" /> General Sullivan sent a courier to tell Washington that the weather was wetting his men's gunpowder. Washington responded, \"Tell General Sullivan to use the bayonet. I am resolved to take Trenton.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bergencountyhistory.org/Pages/crossingatdtrenton.html|title=The Crossing And Battle At Trenton \u2013 1776 |accessdate=August 14, 2008 |publisher=Bergen County Historical Society |author=Kevin Wright}}</ref>\n\nAbout {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} outside the town, the main columns reunited with the advance parties.<ref>Fischer p.231</ref>  They were startled by the sudden appearance of 50 armed men, but they were American.  Led by [[Adam Stephen]], they had not known about the plan to attack Trenton and had attacked a Hessian outpost.<ref name=\"fish32\">Fischer p. 232</ref>  Washington feared the Hessians would have been put on guard, and shouted at Stephen, \"You sir! You Sir, may have ruined all my plans by having them put on their guard.\"<ref name=\"fish32\" /> Despite this, Washington ordered the advance continue to Trenton. In the event, Rall thought the first raid was the attack which Grant had warned him about, and that there would be no further action that day.<ref>McCullough p. 279</ref>\n\n== Battle ==\n{{see also|Order of battle of the Battle of Trenton}}\n\n===U.S. attack===\n[[File:Battle of Trenton.Dean.USMA.edu.history.gif|thumb|right|300px|The Battle of Trenton, December 26, 1776]]\nAt 8 am, the outpost was set up by the Hessians at a cooper shop on Pennington Road about one mile northwest of Trenton.  Washington led the assault, riding in front of his soldiers.<ref name=\"fish235\">Fischer p. 235</ref> As the Hessian commander of the outpost, Lieutenant Andreas Wiederholdt, left the shop, an American fired at him but missed.<ref name=\"fish235\" />  Wiederholdt immediately shouted, ''\"Der Feind!\"'' (The Enemy!) and other Hessians came out.<ref name=\"fish237\">Fischer p. 237</ref> The Americans fired three volleys, and the Hessians returned one of their own.<ref name=\"fish235\" />  Washington ordered [[Edward Hand]]'s Pennsylvania Riflemen and a battalion of German-speaking infantry to block the road that led to Princeton.  They attacked the Hessian outpost there.<ref name=\"fish237\" /> Wiederholdt soon realized that this was more than a raiding party; seeing other Hessians retreating from the outpost, he led his men to do the same.<ref>Andreas Wiederholdt (edited by M.D. Learned and C. Grosse): ''Tagebuch des Capt. Wiederholdt Vom 7 Oktober bis 7 December 1780''; The MacMillan Co, New York, ~1862; reprinted by the University of Michigan Library, 17 August 2015</ref>  Both Hessian detachments made organized retreats, firing as they fell back.<ref name=\"fish237\" />  On the high ground at the north end of Trenton, they were joined by a duty company from the Lossberg Regiment.<ref name=\"fish237\" />  They engaged the Americans, retreating slowly, keeping up continuous fire and using houses for cover.<ref>Ketchum p. 255</ref>  Once in Trenton, they gained covering fire from other Hessian guard companies on the outskirts of the town. Another guard company nearer to the Delaware River rushed east to their aid, leaving open the River Road into Trenton.  Washington ordered the escape route to Princeton be cut off, sending infantry in battle formation to block it, while artillery formed at the head of King and Queen streets.<ref>Ketchum p. 256</ref>\n\nLeading the southern U.S. column, General Sullivan entered Trenton by the abandoned River Road and blocked the only crossing over the Assunpink Creek to cut off the Hessian escape.<ref name=\"wood68\">Wood p. 68</ref> Sullivan briefly held up his advance to make sure Greene's division had time to drive the Hessians from their outposts in the north.<ref name=\"wood68\" />  Soon after, they continued their advance, attacking the Hermitage, home of [[Philemon Dickinson]], where 50 j\u00e4gers under the command of Lieutenant von Grothausen were stationed.<ref name=\"wood68\" /> Lieutenant von Grothausen brought 12 of his j\u00e4gers into action against the advanced guard but had only advanced a few hundred yards when he saw a column of Americans advancing to the Hermitage.<ref name=\"wood68\" />  Pulling back to the Hessian barracks, he was joined by the rest of the j\u00e4gers.  After the exchange of one volley, they turned and ran, some trying to swim across the creek, while others escaped over the bridge, which had not yet been cut off.  The 20 British [[Dragoon|dragoons]] also fled.<ref name=\"wood68\" /> As Greene and Sullivan's columns pushed into the town, Washington moved to high ground north of King and Queens streets to see the action and direct his troops.<ref>McCullough p. 280</ref>  By this time, U.S. artillery from the other side of the Delaware River had come into action, devastating the Hessian positions.<ref>Fischer p. 239</ref>\n\nWith the sounding of the alarm, the three Hessian regiments began to prepare for battle.<ref name=\"fish240\">Fischer p. 240</ref>  The Rall regiment formed on lower King Street along with the Lossberg regiment, while the Knyphausen regiment formed at the lower end of Queen Street.<ref name=\"fish240\" />  Lieutenant Piel, Rall's brigade adjutant, woke his commander, who found that the rebels had taken the \"V\" of the main streets of the town.  This is where the engineers had recommended building a redoubt.  Rall ordered his regiment to form up at the lower end of King Street, the Lossberg regiment to prepare for an advance up Queen Street, and the Knyphausen regiment to stand by as a reserve for Rall's advance up King Street.<ref name=\"wood68\" />\n\nThe U.S. cannon stationed at the head of the two main streets soon came into action.  In reply, Rall directed his regiment, supported by a few companies of the Lossberg regiment, to clear the guns.<ref name=\"wood70\">Wood p. 70</ref>  The Hessians formed ranks and began to advance up the street, but their formations were quickly broken by the U.S. guns and fire from Mercer's men who had taken houses on the left side of the street.<ref name=\"wood70\" />  Breaking ranks, the Hessians fled.  Rall ordered two three-pound cannon into action.  After getting off six rounds each, within just a few minutes, half of the Hessians manning their guns were killed by the U.S. cannon.<ref name=\"wood70\" />  After the men fled to cover behind houses and fences, their cannons were taken by the Americans.<ref name=\"wood71\">Wood p. 71</ref>  Following capture of the cannon, men under the command of [[George Weedon]] advanced down King Street.<ref name=\"wood68\" />\n\nOn Queen Street, all Hessian attempts to advance up the street were repulsed by guns under the command of Thomas Forrest.  After firing four rounds each, two more Hessian guns were silenced.  One of Forrest's howitzers was put out of action with a broken axle.<ref name=\"wood68\" />  The Knyphausen regiment became separated from the Lossberg and the Rall regiments. The Lossberg and the Rall regiments fell back to a field outside of town, taking heavy losses from [[grapeshot]] and musket fire. In the southern part of the town, Americans under command of Sullivan began to overwhelm the Hessians.  [[John Stark]] led a bayonet charge at the Knyphausen regiment, whose resistance broke because their weapons would not fire.  Sullivan led a column of men to block off escape of troops across the creek.<ref name=\"wood71\" />\n\n===Hessian resistance collapses===\nThe Hessians in the field attempted to reorganize and make one last attempt to retake the town so they could make a breakout.<ref name=\"Wood p.72\">Wood p. 72</ref> Rall decided to attack the U.S. flank on the heights north of the town.<ref name=\"fish246\">Fischer p. 246</ref> Rall yelled \"Forward! Advance! Advance!\", and the Hessians began to move, with the brigade's band playing fifes, bugles and drums to help the Hessians' spirit.<ref name=\"fish246\" /><ref>Ketchum p. 262</ref>\n\nWashington, still on high ground, saw the Hessians approaching the U.S. flank. He moved his troops to assume battle formation against the enemy.<ref name=\"fish246\" />  The two Hessian regiments began marching toward King Street but were caught in U.S. fire that came at them from three directions.<ref name=\"fish246\" /> Some Americans had taken up defensive positions inside houses, reducing their exposure.  Some civilians joined the fight against the Hessians.<ref name=\"fish249\">Fischer p. 249</ref>  Despite this, they continued to push, recapturing their cannon.  At the head of King Street, Knox saw the Hessians had retaken the cannon and ordered his troops to take them.  Six men ran and, after a brief struggle, seized the cannon, turning them on the Hessians.<ref name=\"fish247\">Fischer p. 247</ref>  With most of the Hessians unable to fire their guns, the attack stalled. The Hessians' formations broke, and they began to scatter.<ref name=\"fish249\" /> Rall was mortally wounded.<ref>Fischer p. 248</ref> Washington led his troops down from high ground while yelling, \"March on, my brave fellows, after me!\"<ref name=\"fish249\" />  Most of the Hessians retreated into an orchard, with the Americans in close pursuit.  Quickly surrounded,<ref name=\"fish251\">Fischer p. 251</ref> the Hessians were offered terms of surrender, to which they agreed.\n\nAlthough ordered to join Rall, the remains of the Knyphausen regiment mistakenly marched in the opposite direction.<ref name=\"fish251\" /> They tried to escape across the bridge but found it had been taken. The Americans quickly swept in, defeating a Hessian attempt to break through their lines.  Surrounded by Sullivan's men, the regiment surrendered, just minutes after the rest of the brigade.<ref name=\"wood74\">Wood p. 74</ref>\n\n===Casualties and capture===\n[[File:Henry-revolutionary-war.jpg|thumb|The engraving ''George Washington at the Battle of Trenton'' by the Illman Brothers in 1870]]\nThe Hessian forces lost 22 killed in action, 83 wounded, and 896 captured{{ndash}}including the wounded.<ref>Fischer p. 254</ref> The Americans suffered only two deaths during the march and five wounded from battle, including a near-fatal shoulder wound to future president [[James Monroe]].

In 1777 they were moved to Virginia.<ref>Fischer p. 379</ref>  Rall was mortally wounded and died later that night at his headquarters.<ref name=Fischer255/>  All four Hessian colonels in Trenton were killed in the battle. The Lossberg regiment was effectively removed from the British forces. Parts of the Knyphausen regiment escaped to the south, but Sullivan captured some 200 additional men, along with the regiment's cannon and supplies. They also captured approximately 1,000 arms and much-needed ammunition.<ref>Mitchell p. 43</ref> The Americans also captured their entire store of provisions\u2014tons of flour, dried and salted meats, ale and other liquors, as well as shoes, boots, clothing and bedding\u2014things that were as much needed by the ragtag Continental forces as weapons and horses.\n\nAmong those captured by the Patriots was [[Christian Strenge]], later to become a schoolmaster and [[fraktur (folk art)|fraktur]] artist in Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"selftaughtgenius\">{{Cite web|url=http://selftaughtgenius.org/reads/johann-christian-strenge|title=Johann Christian Strenge \u2013 Self-Taught Genius|first=|last=Brooklyn United|website=selftaughtgenius.org|accessdate=Apr 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Hessian drinking===\nAn officer in Washington's staff wrote before the battle, \"They make a great deal of Christmas in Germany, and no doubt the Hessians will drink a great deal of beer and have a dance to-night.

However, historian [[David Hackett Fischer]] quotes Patriot John Greenwood, who fought in the battle and supervised Hessians afterward, who wrote, \"I am certain not a drop of liquor was drunk during the whole night, nor, as I could see, even a piece of bread eaten.\"<ref>Fischer p. 426</ref> Military historian [[Edward G. Lengel]] wrote, \"The Germans were dazed and tired but there is no truth to the legend claiming that they were helplessly drunk.\"<ref>Lengel p. 186</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter the Hessians' surrender, Washington is reported to have shaken the hand of a young officer and said, \"This is a glorious day for our country.\"<ref>Ferling p. 178</ref>  On December 28, General Washington interviewed Lieutenant (later Colonel) Andreas Wiederhold, who detailed the failures of Rall's preparation.<ref>Andreas Wiederholdt (edited by M.D. Learned and C.

The Patriot victory gave the [[Continental Congress]] new confidence, as it proved colonial forces could defeat regulars. It also increased re-enlistments in the Continental Army forces.

He was actively involved in the management and engineering support of the D&KR{{Sfnp|Murray|1982|p=22}} and the later [[Dalkey Atmospheric Railway]] throughout their construction and for their operational life until 1856.  A life member of the [[Royal Irish Academy]] he is also known for invention of a patented spring-loaded [[Buffer (rail transport)|rail buffer]].\n\n==Biography==\nThere appears to be little or no immediately available information on Bergin's formative years.  It may be speculated his date of birth is perhaps of the order of the year 1800 but could be ten or more years either side.  There are possibilities he learned his civil engineering on canals in Ireland or Railways in England, and may have been recommended to the D&KR by Vignoles or some other source, but this is speculation.  A indicator which points to him regarding himself as a Dubliner is a reference to \"...our river, the [[River Liffey|Liffey]]\" is in an address to the Microscopical Society of  Dublin in the early 1840s.{{Sfnp|Cooper|1842|p=69}}\n\n===Dublin and Kingstown Railway===\nBergin was appointed D&KR company Clerk{{efn|The equivalent today of Company Secretary}} when [[James Pim|James Pim Junior]] was appointed as D&KR treasurer{{efn|Effectively General Manager}} in May 1832.  Pim Junior and Bergin were to form an effective management team to the end of the D&KR's operational life and were noted as working well together.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|pp=21\u201322}}  Bergin also functioned as the company's chief engineer and appears to have worked well with the D&KR's chief consulting engineer [[Charles Blacker Vignoles]].{{Sfnp|Vignoles|1889|p=331}}\n\nAlthough only mentioned as ''Chief clerk'' and not by name the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] (L&MR) facilitated a visit by Bergin in June 1833 to examine how that company kept its books.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1980|p=229}}\n\nBergin was briefly given additional responsibilities and entitled as the company's mechanical engineer in 1935 however it was realised this actually required an independent individual.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=97}}  1935 also saw Bergin involved with the purchase of the Dodds designed locomotive ''star''.  One might question if Bergin was swayed by Vignoles association with Dodds, and also why ''Swiftsure'' was not purchased from the L&MR.  In the event ''star'' proved to be bad business back in Ireland with bad workmanship causing Bergin to threaten not to pay for it until remedied.  {{harv|Murray|1981|p=184}} picks up of Bergin's exasperated demand for a pair of wheel's to be obtained from Forrester's \"or some other Lancashire house\" as notable due to the underlying rivalry between Lancashire and Yorkshire.{{efn|Star was designed by Dodds, a Yorkshireman, but was built in Birmingham}}.\n\nBergin married Martha McAllister in 1835.{{Sfnp|Digges La Touche|1900|p=657}}\n\nBergin was a proponent of the Atmospheric Railway System and technically supported Pim Junior as evidenced by a detailed technical rebuff in 1843 to a report by Smith and Barlow.{{Sfnp|Bergin|1843}}{{Sfnp|Saunders|1843}}\n\nIncentivised by the 1844 designs of the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) of England through their instrument of the [[Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway|Waterford, Wexford, Wicklow & Dublin Railway]] (3WS) to extend the railway from Dublin southwards to Bray and beyond the D&KR directors backed an alternate scheme spearheaded by James Pim and Bergin to widen the Dalkey Atmospheric to a standard railway and to extend south to Bray with the formation of the Kingstown and Bray Railway Company (K&BR) to accomplish the task.  Attempts to negotiate get an enabling bill through parliament for such a small scheme in a period when a vast number of railway schemes were being presented against the opposition of the GWR seriously affected the health of Pim.  Bergin eventually took Pims place in negotiations with the GWR over the Bray extension and with Pim unwell undertook a trip to the GWR headquarters in Paddington and negotiated the agreement that would eventually lead to the D&KR eventually being forced to give up its operating rights in the 1850s, albeit for an appropriate compensation for equipment and suitable annual rental to the D&KR.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|pp=62\u201366}}\n\n===Design bias===\nThere are some indications Bergin may have had a preference for the outside horizontal-cylinder double framed locomotive supplied by Forrester's.  Short wheelbase {{Whyte|2-2-0}} locomotives were very susceptible to having a yawing motion increasing with speed with consequent stresses on track and locomotive with risk of derailment.  The use of unbalanced wheels made matters worse, and more so by the use of outside cylinders at the front of the locomotive.  Use of a trailing axle could somewhat alleviate the issue, as could balanced driving wheels.  But it should be observed the vertical cylinders of the D&KR's Sharp locomotives gave a worse track hammer blow effect.\n* The D&KR's consultant Rastrick produced a specification somewhat based around the Sharp's [[Experiment (locomotive)|''Experiment'']] locomotive.  On seeing ''Experiment'' in operation on the L&MR, where it was not viewed favourably, Bergin voiced misgivings of aspects of the particulars of the design including vibrations and coke consumption.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=173}}\n* There are indications Vignoles, Bergins friend, was more won over by Dodds design with outside horizontal cylinders, and Bergin may have been too.\n* George Forrester at some point cautioned against the insider-cylinder design of Bury due to the difficulty of manufacturing reliable crank axles.\n* Forrester had not produced locomotives prior to the D&KR build, and with the relative ease of Liverpool Dublin communications there is likelihood the design was developed collaboratively between Forresters, Bergin and Vignoles.\n* When speed testing the Forrester engine ''Vauxhall'' which only achieved 36 mph due to 'bad coke'.  Despite ''Vauxhall'' being relatively new there would have been a propensity to yaw severely at speed and it is ''possible'' excessive yawing was the true reason speed was not higher.  The Sharp's engine ''Hibernia'' achieved 60 mph light engine.{{Sfnp|Vignoles|1889|p=185}}{{Failed verification|date=March 2020}}\n* With days of the locomotive [[Dodds Horsley Star (locomotive)|''Star'']] arriving at the D&KR in September 1835, Bergin was furious the at the dangerous state of repair of the small wheels and demanded replacements from Forrester \"or some other Lancashire house\".{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=184}}{{efn|{{harv|Murray|1981|p=184}} Notes this as possibly a tactless insult invoking traditional Yorkshire versus Lancashire rivalry, however Horsley Ironworks was at [[Tipton]] and design Dodds  was from County Durham.}}\n* Bergin withheld payments on the three Sharps locomotives for a year for excessive maintenance demands.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=182}}\n* The locomotives built by the D&KR's own [[Grand Canal Street railway works|Grand Canal Street works]] were a development of the Forrester design.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=187}}\n\n===Other interests===\nBergin seems to have had other interests outside the railways, perhaps particularly as indicated by his membership of the [[Royal Irish Academy]] (RIA) to which he was elected on 30 November 1836.{{Sfnp|RIA|1864|p=303}}  Bergin is noted having authored or contributed to the RIA's proceedings with papers: \"On an Aurora\", \"On Talbotized Photogenic Paper\", \"On Preservation of Rusted Antiquities\" and \"On illuminatation of Objects in a microscope.{{Sfnp|RIA|1864|p=303}}\n\nHe was President of the [[Microscopical Society of Ireland#Earlier Societies|Microscopical Society of Dublin]].{{Sfnp|Cooper|1842|p=158}}.  \n\nBergin also seemed interested in objects he came across in his travels, presenting some stones to the RIA that appear to have come from altars{{Sfnp|RIA|1850|p=273}} and on 14 September 1846 whilst near Craigha Moira in Connemara alighted from his outside car and noted and picked some unusual heather known as [[Erica ciliaris]] normally only found in the British Isles in South West England.{{Sfnp|Society|1981|pp=55\u201356}}\n\n====Nicholas Chain Bridge====\nBergin had a minor interest in the [[Nicholas Chain Bridge]], the {{Convert|776|m|ft}} bridge over the [[Dnieper]] in [[Kiev]] being the largest in Europe at the time of its completion in 1855.  Vignoles visited Bergin in November 1846 to check his calculations for the bridge were correct.  Bergin checked the calculations and suggested Vignolas sent them to E. Whiteford, \"a mathematician of hig repute\" at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], for verification.  Vignolas, wishing to make absolutely sure there were no errors, spent a three day visit with Bergin meeting [[Thomas Romney Robinson]] at the [[Armagh Observatory]].{{Sfnp|Vignoles|1889|p=331}}\n\n===Retirement===\nBergin retired when the operation of the D&KR was taken over by the [[Dublin and Wicklow Railway]] in 1856, having remained loyal to the D&KR despite offers from other railways.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=97}}  He died in December 1862.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=97}}  He had built up a significant library of work that was auctioned in 1863.\n\n====Surviving artifacts====\nTwo significant personal possessions of Bergin's have survived into perhaps slightly unexpected collections.  A [[microscope]] was purchased by the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] for \u00a3140 in 1863 and remains in their heritage collection, and a French [[aneroid barometer]] has found its way to the [[Western Australian Museum]].{{Sfnp|Mollan|1995|loc=4252 RCS002 & Ex0563}}{{efn|As of 2020 the current reference for the Dublin microscope is RCSI/M/6}}\n\n==Inventions==\n\n===Buffer invention===\n[[File:Dublin Penny Journal 1835-12-26 Dublin &amp; Kingstown Railway Second Class Carriage by E. Heyden.png|thumb|Illustration of the \"Bergin Buffer\" on D&KR carriage with a cutaway version showing the spring buffer at either end of the vehicle.]]\nThe [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] (L&MR), which had successfully operated since 1830, facilitated the testing of locomotives and viewing of operations by other railways, sometimes taking on improvements from such demonstrations. themselves.  For the D&KR it permitted the testing of their locomotives and even a trial of the track construction technique the D&KR was to use.  The L&MR had a problem with the connections to its rail carriages experiencing severe jolting on starting and stopping, and also a tendency to snake when moving along.  The L&MR's carriages originally did not have buffers in the first two years of operation.  An initial early form of connecting buffers was introduced on the L&MR, which was on the two buffer arrangement.  Bergin's central buffer appear to improve this greatly with great strength being achieved with its longitudinal central arrangement even being tested on the L&MR to withstand a locomotive to carriage collision at 15mph without damage.  The device also allowed to L&MR's carriages to be constructed with less weight, however at least some called the device over-complicated.{{cn|date=March 2020}}  The L&MR investigated the Bergin Buffer in 1835,{{Sfnp|Thomas|1980|p=174}}  but the L&MR seem to have then improved their buffers with at least source indicating one improvement was derived from the Bergin device, and the L&MR twin buffer arrangement was the one that spread.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n{{harv|Snell|1921|pp=40\u201341}} Claims the utility of the spring buffer was first recognised on the D&KR, though Snell also claims Bergin's device was unreliable in practice due to its complexity.\nWith the take over of the D&KR and conversion to {{Track gauge|irish gauge}} {{Circa}}1856 rolling stock had the Bergin buffer removed and replaced by a then standard twin buffer arrangement.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=193}}\n\n==={{Anchor|A-velocipede}}Rope driven row-boat patent===\nBergin together with [[James Pim]] put forward a patent for a rope driven \"Row-boat\" in 1837; a man-powered rail [[handcar]].{{Sfnp|Velocipedes|2016|pp=1\u20132}}{{efn|It is pragmattically probable at least one was built and tried on the D&KR however functionally similar and possibly better crank and polling based cars may have existed by this point.}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite report |last= Bergin |first= Thomas F. | date = 1843\n     | title= The Atmospheric Railway: Observations on the Report of Lieut.

He was actively involved in the management and engineering support of the D&KR{{Sfnp|Murray|1982|p=22}} and the later [[Dalkey Atmospheric Railway]] throughout their construction and for their operational life until 1856.  A life member of the [[Royal Irish Academy]] he is also known for invention of a patented spring-loaded [[Buffer (rail transport)|rail buffer]].\n\n==Biography==\nThere appears to be little or no immediately available information on Bergin's formative years.  It may be speculated his date of birth is perhaps of the order of the year 1800 but could be ten or more years either side.  There are possibilities he learned his civil engineering on canals in Ireland or Railways in England, and may have been recommended to the D&KR by Vignoles or some other source, but this is speculation.  A indicator which points to him regarding himself as a Dubliner is a reference to \"...our river, the [[River Liffey|Liffey]]\" is in an address to the Microscopical Society of  Dublin in the early 1840s.{{Sfnp|Cooper|1842|p=69}}\n\n===Dublin and Kingstown Railway===\nBergin was appointed D&KR company Clerk{{efn|The equivalent today of Company Secretary}} when [[James Pim|James Pim Junior]] was appointed as D&KR treasurer{{efn|Effectively General Manager}} in May 1832.  Pim Junior and Bergin were to form an effective management team to the end of the D&KR's operational life and were noted as working well together.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|pp=21\u201322}}  Bergin also functioned as the company's chief engineer and appears to have worked well with the D&KR's chief consulting engineer [[Charles Blacker Vignoles]].{{Sfnp|Vignoles|1889|p=331}}\n\nAlthough only mentioned as ''Chief clerk'' and not by name the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] (L&MR) facilitated a visit by Bergin in June 1833 to examine how that company kept its books.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1980|p=229}}\n\nBergin was briefly given additional responsibilities and entitled as the company's mechanical engineer in 1935 however it was realised this actually required an independent individual.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=97}}  1935 also saw Bergin involved with the purchase of the Dodds designed locomotive ''star''.  One might question if Bergin was swayed by Vignoles association with Dodds, and also why ''Swiftsure'' was not purchased from the L&MR.  In the event ''star'' proved to be bad business back in Ireland with bad workmanship causing Bergin to threaten not to pay for it until remedied.  {{harv|Murray|1981|p=184}} picks up of Bergin's exasperated demand for a pair of wheel's to be obtained from Forrester's \"or some other Lancashire house\" as notable due to the underlying rivalry between Lancashire and Yorkshire.{{efn|Star was designed by Dodds, a Yorkshireman, but was built in Birmingham}}.\n\nBergin married Martha McAllister in 1835.{{Sfnp|Digges La Touche|1900|p=657}}\n\nBergin was a proponent of the Atmospheric Railway System and technically supported Pim Junior as evidenced by a detailed technical rebuff in 1843 to a report by Smith and Barlow.{{Sfnp|Bergin|1843}}{{Sfnp|Saunders|1843}}\n\nIncentivised by the 1844 designs of the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) of England through their instrument of the [[Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway|Waterford, Wexford, Wicklow & Dublin Railway]] (3WS) to extend the railway from Dublin southwards to Bray and beyond the D&KR directors backed an alternate scheme spearheaded by James Pim and Bergin to widen the Dalkey Atmospheric to a standard railway and to extend south to Bray with the formation of the Kingstown and Bray Railway Company (K&BR) to accomplish the task.  Attempts to negotiate get an enabling bill through parliament for such a small scheme in a period when a vast number of railway schemes were being presented against the opposition of the GWR seriously affected the health of Pim.  Bergin eventually took Pims place in negotiations with the GWR over the Bray extension and with Pim unwell undertook a trip to the GWR headquarters in Paddington and negotiated the agreement that would eventually lead to the D&KR eventually being forced to give up its operating rights in the 1850s, albeit for an appropriate compensation for equipment and suitable annual rental to the D&KR.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|pp=62\u201366}}\n\n===Design bias===\nThere are some indications Bergin may have had a preference for the outside horizontal-cylinder double framed locomotive supplied by Forrester's.  Short wheelbase {{Whyte|2-2-0}} locomotives were very susceptible to having a yawing motion increasing with speed with consequent stresses on track and locomotive with risk of derailment.  The use of unbalanced wheels made matters worse, and more so by the use of outside cylinders at the front of the locomotive.  Use of a trailing axle could somewhat alleviate the issue, as could balanced driving wheels.  But it should be observed the vertical cylinders of the D&KR's Sharp locomotives gave a worse track hammer blow effect.\n* The D&KR's consultant Rastrick produced a specification somewhat based around the Sharp's [[Experiment (locomotive)|''Experiment'']] locomotive.  On seeing ''Experiment'' in operation on the L&MR, where it was not viewed favourably, Bergin voiced misgivings of aspects of the particulars of the design including vibrations and coke consumption.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=173}}\n* There are indications Vignoles, Bergins friend, was more won over by Dodds design with outside horizontal cylinders, and Bergin may have been too.\n* George Forrester at some point cautioned against the insider-cylinder design of Bury due to the difficulty of manufacturing reliable crank axles.\n* Forrester had not produced locomotives prior to the D&KR build, and with the relative ease of Liverpool Dublin communications there is likelihood the design was developed collaboratively between Forresters, Bergin and Vignoles.\n* When speed testing the Forrester engine ''Vauxhall'' which only achieved 36 mph due to 'bad coke'.  Despite ''Vauxhall'' being relatively new there would have been a propensity to yaw severely at speed and it is ''possible'' excessive yawing was the true reason speed was not higher.  The Sharp's engine ''Hibernia'' achieved 60 mph light engine.{{Sfnp|Vignoles|1889|p=185}}{{Failed verification|date=March 2020}}\n* With days of the locomotive [[Dodds Horsley Star (locomotive)|''Star'']] arriving at the D&KR in September 1835, Bergin was furious the at the dangerous state of repair of the small wheels and demanded replacements from Forrester \"or some other Lancashire house\".{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=184}}{{efn|{{harv|Murray|1981|p=184}} Notes this as possibly a tactless insult invoking traditional Yorkshire versus Lancashire rivalry, however Horsley Ironworks was at [[Tipton]] and design Dodds  was from County Durham.}}\n* Bergin withheld payments on the three Sharps locomotives for a year for excessive maintenance demands.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=182}}\n* The locomotives built by the D&KR's own [[Grand Canal Street railway works|Grand Canal Street works]] were a development of the Forrester design.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=187}}\n\n===Other interests===\nBergin seems to have had other interests outside the railways, perhaps particularly as indicated by his membership of the [[Royal Irish Academy]] (RIA) to which he was elected on 30 November 1836.{{Sfnp|RIA|1864|p=303}}  Bergin is noted having authored or contributed to the RIA's proceedings with papers: \"On an Aurora\", \"On Talbotized Photogenic Paper\", \"On Preservation of Rusted Antiquities\" and \"On illuminatation of Objects in a microscope.{{Sfnp|RIA|1864|p=303}}\n\nHe was President of the [[Microscopical Society of Ireland#Earlier Societies|Microscopical Society of Dublin]].{{Sfnp|Cooper|1842|p=158}}.  \n\nBergin also seemed interested in objects he came across in his travels, presenting some stones to the RIA that appear to have come from altars{{Sfnp|RIA|1850|p=273}} and on 14 September 1846 whilst near Craigha Moira in Connemara alighted from his outside car and noted and picked some unusual heather known as [[Erica ciliaris]] normally only found in the British Isles in South West England.{{Sfnp|Society|1981|pp=55\u201356}}\n\n====Nicholas Chain Bridge====\nBergin had a minor interest in the [[Nicholas Chain Bridge]], the {{Convert|776|m|ft}} bridge over the [[Dnieper]] in [[Kiev]] being the largest in Europe at the time of its completion in 1855.  Vignoles visited Bergin in November 1846 to check his calculations for the bridge were correct.  Bergin checked the calculations and suggested Vignolas sent them to E. Whiteford, \"a mathematician of hig repute\" at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], for verification.  Vignolas, wishing to make absolutely sure there were no errors, spent a three day visit with Bergin meeting [[Thomas Romney Robinson]] at the [[Armagh Observatory]].{{Sfnp|Vignoles|1889|p=331}}\n\n===Retirement===\nBergin retired when the operation of the D&KR was taken over by the [[Dublin and Wicklow Railway]] in 1856, having remained loyal to the D&KR despite offers from other railways.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=97}}  He died in December 1862.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=97}}  He had built up a significant library of work that was auctioned in 1863.\n\n====Surviving artifacts====\nTwo significant personal possessions of Bergin's have survived into perhaps slightly unexpected collections.  A [[microscope]] was purchased by the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] for \u00a3140 in 1863 and remains in their heritage collection, and a French [[aneroid barometer]] has found its way to the [[Western Australian Museum]].{{Sfnp|Mollan|1995|loc=4252 RCS002 & Ex0563}}{{efn|As of 2020 the current reference for the Dublin microscope is RCSI/M/6}}\n\n==Inventions==\n\n===Buffer invention===\n[[File:Dublin Penny Journal 1835-12-26 Dublin &amp; Kingstown Railway Second Class Carriage by E. Heyden.png|thumb|Illustration of the \"Bergin Buffer\" on D&KR carriage with a cutaway version showing the spring buffer at either end of the vehicle.]]\nThe [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] (L&MR), which had successfully operated since 1830, facilitated the testing of locomotives and viewing of operations by other railways, sometimes taking on improvements from such demonstrations. themselves.  For the D&KR it permitted the testing of their locomotives and even a trial of the track construction technique the D&KR was to use.  The L&MR had a problem with the connections to its rail carriages experiencing severe jolting on starting and stopping, and also a tendency to snake when moving along.  The L&MR's carriages originally did not have buffers in the first two years of operation.  An initial early form of connecting buffers was introduced on the L&MR, which was on the two buffer arrangement.  Bergin's central buffer appear to improve this greatly with great strength being achieved with its longitudinal central arrangement even being tested on the L&MR to withstand a locomotive to carriage collision at 15mph without damage.  The device also allowed to L&MR's carriages to be constructed with less weight, however at least some called the device over-complicated.{{cn|date=March 2020}}  The L&MR investigated the Bergin Buffer in 1835,{{Sfnp|Thomas|1980|p=174}}  but the L&MR seem to have then improved their buffers with at least source indicating one improvement was derived from the Bergin device, and the L&MR twin buffer arrangement was the one that spread.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n{{harv|Snell|1921|pp=40\u201341}} Claims the utility of the spring buffer was first recognised on the D&KR, though Snell also claims Bergin's device was unreliable in practice due to its complexity.\nWith the take over of the D&KR and conversion to {{Track gauge|irish gauge}} {{Circa}}1856 rolling stock had the Bergin buffer removed and replaced by a then standard twin buffer arrangement.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=193}}\n\n==={{Anchor|A-velocipede}}Rope driven row-boat patent===\nBergin together with [[James Pim]] put forward a patent for a rope driven \"Row-boat\" in 1837; a man-powered rail [[handcar]].{{Sfnp|Velocipedes|2016|pp=1\u20132}}{{efn|It is pragmattically probable at least one was built and tried on the D&KR however functionally similar and possibly better crank and polling based cars may have existed by this point.}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=}}\n== Sources ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last= Cooper |first= Daniel | date = 1842 | title=The Microscopic Miscellany; being selections from the Microscopic Journal\n     | url=https://archive.org/details/microscopicmisce00cooprich | location=London |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book|last=Donaghy|first=Thomas J|date=1972|title=Liverpool & Manchester Railway operations, 1831-1845\n     |oclc=637059|isbn=9780715357057|publisher=David and Charles|location=Newton Abbot, Devon|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Grierson|first=Thomas B|date=1887|title=The enlargement of Westland Row Terminus Part I\n     |journal=Transactions of the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland|volume=18|url=https://digitalcollections.tcd.ie/home/index.php?DRIS_ID=ICEI-018_001|access-date=23 July 2019\n     |publisher=Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723153025/https://digitalcollections.tcd.ie/home/index.php?DRIS_ID=ICEI-022_001|archive-date=23 July 2019|df=dmy-all|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Digges La Touche|first=J.
