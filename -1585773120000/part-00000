During the 12th century a charter was granted allowing a market, and the building of [[St. Mary's Church, Watford|St Mary's Church]] began. The town grew partly due to travellers going to [[Berkhamsted Castle]] and the royal palace at [[Kings Langley]]. A [[mansion]] was built at [[Cassiobury House|Cassiobury]] in the 16th century. This was partly rebuilt in the 17th century and another [[country house]] was built at [[The Grove, Watford|The Grove]].\n\nThe [[Grand Junction Canal]] in 1798 and the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] in 1837 resulted in Watford's rapid growth, with paper-making mills such as [[John Dickinson Stationery|John Dickinson]] at Croxley, influencing the development of printing in the town. Two brewers, [[Benskins]] and [[Sedgwicks Brewery|Sedgwicks]], amalgamated and flourished in the town until their closure in the late 20th century. [[Hertfordshire County Council]] designates Watford to be a major sub-regional centre. Several head offices  are based in Watford. Both the 2006 [[World Golf Championship]] and the [[2013 Bilderberg Conference]] took place at [[The Grove, Watford|The Grove]].<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/02/week-ahead-bilderberg-2013-watford|title=The week ahead: Bilderberg 2013 comes to&nbsp;... the Grove hotel, Watford|author=Charlie Skelton|work=the Guardian}}</ref>\n\nWatford became an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] under the [[Local Government Act 1894]] and a [[municipal borough]] by grant of a charter in 1922. The borough, which had 90,301 inhabitants at the time of the 2011 census, is separated from [[Greater London]] to the south by the parish of [[Watford Rural]] in the [[Three Rivers (district)|Three Rivers District]]. [[Watford Borough Council]] is the [[local authority]] with the [[Mayor of Watford]] as its head; one of only 18 [[directly elected mayors in England and Wales]]. Watford elects one [[Member of parliament|MP]] for the [[Watford (UK Parliament constituency)|Watford constituency]]. Prior to the establishment of this constituency in 1885, the area was part of the three-seat constituency of [[Hertfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Hertfordshire]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:St Mary's Church, Watford.jpg|thumb|[[St. Mary's Church, Watford|St Mary's Church, Watford]]]]\n[[File:Essex Chapel, Saint Mary's Watford.jpg|thumb|The Essex Chapel in Saint Mary's Church]]\nThere is evidence of some limited prehistoric occupation around the Watford area, with a few Celtic and Roman finds, though there is no evidence of a settlement until much later.<ref name=forsyth>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fY-Yoru2dTQC&pg=PA276 |title=A County of Small Towns: The Development of Hertfordshire's Urban Landscape|editor=T.

In the 12th century the Abbey was granted a charter allowing it to hold a market here and the building of St Mary's Church began. The settlement's location helped it to grow, since as well as trade along this north-south through route it possessed good communications into the vale of [[St Albans]] to the east and into the Chiltern Hills along the valley of the [[River Chess]] to the west. The town grew modestly, assisted by travellers passing through to [[Berkhamsted Castle]] and the royal palace at [[Kings Langley]]. A big house was built at [[Cassiobury House|Cassiobury]] in the 16th century. This was partly rebuilt in the 17th century and another substantial house was built nearby at [[The Grove, Watford|The Grove]].

The [[Industrial Revolution]] brought the [[Grand Junction Canal]] (now [[Grand Union Canal]]) from 1798 and the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] from 1837, both located here for the same reasons the road had followed centuries before, seeking an easy gradient over the Chiltern Hills. The land-owning interests permitted the canal to follow closely by the river Gade, but the prospect of smoke-emitting [[steam train]]s drove them to ensure the railway gave a wide berth to the Cassiobury and Grove estates. Consequently, although the road and canal follow the easier valley route, the railway company was forced to build an expensive tunnel under [[Leavesden, Hertfordshire|Leavesden]] to the north of the town.\n[[File:Watford, The old railway station house - geograph.org.uk - 981561.jpg|thumb|left|St Albans Road railway station  (1837)]]\n[[Watford railway station (1837-1858)|Watford's original railway station]] opened in 1837 on the west side of St Albans Road, a small, single-storey red-brick building.

district|borough]] in [[Hertfordshire]], England, {{convert|15|mi}} northwest of [[central London]].\n\nThe town developed on the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|River Colne]] on land belonging to [[St Albans Abbey]] until the 16th century. During the 12th century a charter was granted allowing a market, and the building of [[St. Mary's Church, Watford|St Mary's Church]] began. The town grew partly due to travellers going to [[Berkhamsted Castle]] and the royal palace at [[Kings Langley]]. A [[mansion]] was built at [[Cassiobury House|Cassiobury]] in the 16th century. This was partly rebuilt in the 17th century and another [[country house]] was built at [[The Grove, Watford|The Grove]].\n\nThe [[Grand Junction Canal]] in 1798 and the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] in 1837 resulted in Watford's rapid growth, with paper-making mills such as [[John Dickinson Stationery|John Dickinson]] at Croxley, influencing the development of printing in the town. Two brewers, [[Benskins]] and [[Sedgwicks Brewery|Sedgwicks]], amalgamated and flourished in the town until their closure in the late 20th century. [[Hertfordshire County Council]] designates Watford to be a major sub-regional centre. Several head offices  are based in Watford. Both the 2006 [[World Golf Championship]] and the [[2013 Bilderberg Conference]] took place at [[The Grove, Watford|The Grove]].<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/02/week-ahead-bilderberg-2013-watford|title=The week ahead: Bilderberg 2013 comes to&nbsp;... the Grove hotel, Watford|author=Charlie Skelton|work=the Guardian}}</ref>\n\nWatford became an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] under the [[Local Government Act 1894]] and a [[municipal borough]] by grant of a charter in 1922. The borough, which had 90,301 inhabitants at the time of the 2011 census, is separated from [[Greater London]] to the south by the parish of [[Watford Rural]] in the [[Three Rivers (district)|Three Rivers District]]. [[Watford Borough Council]] is the [[local authority]] with the [[Mayor of Watford]] as its head; one of only 18 [[directly elected mayors in England and Wales]]. Watford elects one [[Member of parliament|MP]] for the [[Watford (UK Parliament constituency)|Watford constituency]].

It is not mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, when this area was part of St Albans' Abbey's manor of cashio. In the 12th century the Abbey was granted a charter allowing it to hold a market here and the building of St Mary's Church began. The settlement's location helped it to grow, since as well as trade along this north-south through route it possessed good communications into the vale of [[St Albans]] to the east and into the Chiltern Hills along the valley of the [[River Chess]] to the west. The town grew modestly, assisted by travellers passing through to [[Berkhamsted Castle]] and the royal palace at [[Kings Langley]]. A big house was built at [[Cassiobury House|Cassiobury]] in the 16th century. This was partly rebuilt in the 17th century and another substantial house was built nearby at [[The Grove, Watford|The Grove]]. The houses were expanded and developed throughout the following centuries.

The [[Industrial Revolution]] brought the [[Grand Junction Canal]] (now [[Grand Union Canal]]) from 1798 and the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] from 1837, both located here for the same reasons the road had followed centuries before, seeking an easy gradient over the Chiltern Hills. The land-owning interests permitted the canal to follow closely by the river Gade, but the prospect of smoke-emitting [[steam train]]s drove them to ensure the railway gave a wide berth to the Cassiobury and Grove estates. Consequently, although the road and canal follow the easier valley route, the railway company was forced to build an expensive tunnel under [[Leavesden, Hertfordshire|Leavesden]] to the north of the town.\n[[File:Watford, The old railway station house - geograph.org.uk - 981561.jpg|thumb|left|St Albans Road railway station  (1837)]]\n[[Watford railway station (1837-1858)|Watford's original railway station]] opened in 1837 on the west side of St Albans Road, a small, single-storey red-brick building.

The Grand Union Canal, allowed coal to be brought into the district and paved the way for industrial development. The Watford Gas and Coke Company was formed in 1834 and gas works built. The canal allowed paper-making mills to be sited at Croxley. The [[John Dickinson Stationery|John Dickinson and Co.]] mill beside the canal manufactured the Croxley brand of fine quality paper.

Film noir directors tried to fulfill specific constructions of gender roles in this aesthetically driven cinema style, creating very specific false archetypes for women within the ongoing history of film noir.<ref>Hirsch, Foster. The Dark Side of the Screen: Film Noir. New York, NY: Da Capo, 1983. Print. 147</ref> According to Andrew Spicer in \u201cFilm Noir,\u201d the articulation of the patriarchy in film noir is understood as one of the style's most consistent features, no matter the decade of the film.<ref>Spicer, Andrew. Film Noir. Harlow, England: Longman, 2002. Print.84</ref>\n\n==Women's roles==\nThe roles that women play in film noir are the stylistic innovations of the heteronormative patriarchy, which are set up to be harmless supplements for the narrative. However, upon further investigation, these roles directly translate to the dark reality of the re-oppressed female post-[[World War II]] when women were expected to re-insert themselves back into the home after finding independence through the workforce.<ref>Silver, Alain, and James Ursini. Film Noir Reader. New York: Limelight Editions, 1996. Print. 129</ref> The narrative of film noir and the ever-present domestic space during the 1940s and 1950s is an obvious thematic representation of woman as other, in which the \u201cattack on the dominant social values [in film noir is] normally expressed through the representation of the family.\u201d<ref>Harvey, Sylvia. Woman\u2019s Place: The Absent Family of Film Noir. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012. Print. 36</ref> \n\nSylvia Harvey observes that the absence of the family in film noir indicates that a \u201cwoman\u2019s place in the home determines her position in society, but also serves as a reflection of oppressive social relationships.\u201d <ref>Harvey, Sylvia. Woman\u2019s Place: The Absent Family of Film Noir. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012. Print. 36</ref> This control over the domestic space that women carried when they entered the workforce during World War II was quick to be taken away when social order was attempted to restore itself after the war. Within the uneasy aesthetic of this film style, the harsh light and ominous visual cues of danger approaches the domestic space as a highly disturbed and broken social order, displacing viewers into recognizing the tension in the home and the women's role in generating that narrative.<ref>Harvey, Sylvia. Woman\u2019s Place: The Absent Family of Film Noir. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012.

Film Noir and the Cinema of Paranoia. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers UP, 2009. Print. 38</ref> \n\nWomen that are represented in film noir are no strangers to the danger that lies beyond the veil of fiction. There is a disruption in the domestic space by the rebelling female moulds of film noir, to which the male protagonists do not take to the success of the over the top narcissist and empowered female character lightly, similar to the reality of the unhappiness of the patriarchal order losing its grip on women.\n\n==Patriarchal order==\n\nThe patriarchal order of film noir escalates to a point that in some films, such as ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944), the child becomes oppressed. The family home in ''Double Indemnity'' \u201cis the place where three people who hate each other spend endlessly boring evenings together. The husband does not merely not notice his wife, he ignores her sexually\u201d.<ref>Harvey, Sylvia. Woman\u2019s Place: The Absent Family of Film Noir. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012. Print. 42</ref> As revenge against his attitude towards her, [[Phyllis Dietrichson]] (played by Barbara Stanwyck) plots to murder her dull, oppressive husband with the facilitation of an insurance salesman. The two of them are then forced into an endless cycle of \u201cdesire, death, and retribution\u201d as a repercussion of the acts that they have committed. \n\nAt an attempt to deceive the woman and restore order, the insurance man (Walter Neff, played by Fred MacMurray) soon finds out that the femme fatale has beat him at the game of domestic restoration when she attempts to murder him.

While there is an attempt to balance the role of the loving and sensitive mother while acting as the sole income for the home, there is an obvious resentment that her eldest daughter Veda has for Mildred. On the surface, it is understood that the disgust towards her mother is because of the source of her income, through labour, however it is later revealed that her resentment for Mildred, the protagonist, is because the lack of a phallus. \n\nThe audience comes to understand this when it is laid out that Mildred's business partner and platonic lover, Monty, is taking advantage of Mildred's funds and supplying Veda with all of her needs, to which Veda obliges happily, opposing her mothers same gestures.<ref>Cook, Pam.

Mildred Pierce relies heavily on visual cues in the attempt to illustrate a straightforward narrative for the audience, which can be seen through the apparel, such as Mildred's dominating shoulder pads and pantsuits as an attempt to combat against the male figure and its default of symbolizing power. Like in any cinema of the early evolution of film, there are specific roles for actors to accommodate in the narrative of the film. \n\nOne specific example of a stock female character in film noir is the alluring and treacherous [[femme fatale]] and \"Spider Woman\". The direct translation from French for the term femme fatale is \u201cfatal woman,\u201d which is embedded in classic film noirs, such as Rita Hayworth in ''[[Gilda]]'' (1946), Barbara Stanwyck in ''Double Indemnity'' (1944), and Lara Turner in ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (1946). These examples of deadly women commit crimes inside and outside the narrative of the films. As a consistent narrative trait in film noir, there are flashbacks embedded in the storyline, so as to signal towards the presence of a larger story outside of the feature film, an association with reality.\n\nAs Karen Hollinger describes in \u201cFilm Noir, Voice-Over and the Femme Fatale,\u201d women in film noir are subjected to the psychoanalytic perspective of the male, which forces a consistent attempt to try and interpret the meaning of femaleness, from the point of view of the phallus, which is deemed a problematic perspective, since it speaks for a silenced demographic by popular culture and media.<ref>Hollinger, Karen.

Film Noir. Harlow, England: Longman, 2002. Print.84</ref>\n\n==Women's roles==\nThe roles that women play in film noir are the stylistic innovations of the heteronormative patriarchy, which are set up to be harmless supplements for the narrative. However, upon further investigation, these roles directly translate to the dark reality of the re-oppressed female post-[[World War II]] when women were expected to re-insert themselves back into the home after finding independence through the workforce.<ref>Silver, Alain, and James Ursini. Film Noir Reader. New York: Limelight Editions, 1996. Print. 129</ref> The narrative of film noir and the ever-present domestic space during the 1940s and 1950s is an obvious thematic representation of woman as other, in which the \u201cattack on the dominant social values [in film noir is] normally expressed through the representation of the family.\u201d<ref>Harvey, Sylvia. Woman\u2019s Place: The Absent Family of Film Noir. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012. Print. 36</ref> \n\nSylvia Harvey observes that the absence of the family in film noir indicates that a \u201cwoman\u2019s place in the home determines her position in society, but also serves as a reflection of oppressive social relationships.\u201d <ref>Harvey, Sylvia. Woman\u2019s Place: The Absent Family of Film Noir. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012. Print. 36</ref> This control over the domestic space that women carried when they entered the workforce during World War II was quick to be taken away when social order was attempted to restore itself after the war. Within the uneasy aesthetic of this film style, the harsh light and ominous visual cues of danger approaches the domestic space as a highly disturbed and broken social order, displacing viewers into recognizing the tension in the home and the women's role in generating that narrative.<ref>Harvey, Sylvia. Woman\u2019s Place: The Absent Family of Film Noir. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012.

Film Noir and the Cinema of Paranoia. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers UP, 2009. Print. 38</ref> \n\nWomen that are represented in film noir are no strangers to the danger that lies beyond the veil of fiction. There is a disruption in the domestic space by the rebelling female moulds of film noir, to which the male protagonists do not take to the success of the over the top narcissist and empowered female character lightly, similar to the reality of the unhappiness of the patriarchal order losing its grip on women.\n\n==Patriarchal order==\n\nThe patriarchal order of film noir escalates to a point that in some films, such as ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944), the child becomes oppressed. The family home in ''Double Indemnity'' \u201cis the place where three people who hate each other spend endlessly boring evenings together. The husband does not merely not notice his wife, he ignores her sexually\u201d.<ref>Harvey, Sylvia. Woman\u2019s Place: The Absent Family of Film Noir. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed. Women in Film Noir. London: BFI, 2012. Print. 42</ref> As revenge against his attitude towards her, [[Phyllis Dietrichson]] (played by Barbara Stanwyck) plots to murder her dull, oppressive husband with the facilitation of an insurance salesman. The two of them are then forced into an endless cycle of \u201cdesire, death, and retribution\u201d as a repercussion of the acts that they have committed. \n\nAt an attempt to deceive the woman and restore order, the insurance man (Walter Neff, played by Fred MacMurray) soon finds out that the femme fatale has beat him at the game of domestic restoration when she attempts to murder him. Once he is killed, Phyllis is led to live in peace as a black widow, a true spider woman, a femme fatale.<ref>Harvey, Sylvia. Woman\u2019s Place: The Absent Family of Film Noir. Kaplan, E. Ann. Ed.

Sworn into the Senate in 1989, he served as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] until 2001, when he left the party to become an [[Independent politician|independent]] and began caucusing with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. Jeffords retired from the Senate in 2007. Prior to serving in the Senate, he served as the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|VT|AL}} from 1975 to 1989.\n\nThe son of [[Olin M. Jeffords]], who served as Chief Justice of the [[Vermont Supreme Court]], James Jeffords was born in [[Rutland (city), Vermont|Rutland, Vermont]].  He graduated from [[Yale University]], served for three years in the [[United States Navy]], and then attended [[Harvard Law School]], from which he received his degree in 1962.  Jeffords practiced law in southern Vermont and became a resident of [[Shrewsbury, Vermont|Shrewsbury]], where he was active in local politics and government as a Republican, including serving as chairman of the town's Republican committee.  He served one term in the [[Vermont Senate]] (1967-1969), and two as [[Attorney General of Vermont]] (1969-1973).  He lost the 1972 Republican primary for [[Governor of Vermont]], but won the election for Vermont's lone seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1974.  He served in the House from 1975 to 1989; in 1988 he was the successful Republican nominee for the [[United States Senate]] seat held by the retiring [[Robert Stafford]].\n\nJeffords served in the Senate from 1989 until 2007, winning reelection in 1994 and 2000.  In 2001, he made national headlines when he left the Republican Party to become an independent, and began to caucus with the Senate's [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].  His switch changed control of the Senate from Republican to Democratic, the first time a switch had ever changed party control.  During his Senate career, Jeffords served as chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Public Works]] and [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions|Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions]] Committees.\n\nIn 2005, Jeffords announced that he would not run for reelection in 2006, and would retire at the end of his term.  He was succeeded by [[Bernie Sanders]].  Jeffords retired to Shrewsbury in 2007.  After the death of his wife, he moved to the Washington, DC area to live closer to his children.  He died in 2014 from complications associated with Alzheimer's disease, and was buried in Shrewsbury.\n\n==Background==\nJeffords was born in [[Rutland (city), Vermont|Rutland, Vermont]], the son of Marion (n\u00e9e Hausman) and [[Olin M.

During 1962 and 1963 he was a law clerk for [[Ernest W. Gibson Jr.]], Judge of the [[United States District Court for the District of Vermont]], afterwards practicing law in Rutland.\n\nA longtime resident of [[Shrewsbury, Vermont|Shrewsbury]], Jeffords became active in politics and government in the 1960s as Shrewsbury's Grand Juror, Town Agent and Zoning Administrator, in addition to serving as chairman of the town's Republican committee. He also served as [[Rutland County, Vermont|Rutland County]]'s chairman of the Board of Property Tax Appeals.<ref>Marquis Who's Who, [https://books.google.com/books?id=N2AaAQAAIAAJ&q=jeffords+shrewsbury+grand+juror&dq=jeffords+shrewsbury+grand+juror&hl=en&sa=X&ei=n_oMU-m-IKW80AHcv4HYBQ&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBA Who's Who in Government], Volume 3, 1977, page 300</ref>\n\nJeffords married Elizabeth \"Liz\" Daley twice, first in 1961, which ended with a June 1978 divorce.

He followed that success in 1968 with a victory in the race for [[Attorney General of Vermont]]. He was a [[Electoral College (United States)|Presidential Elector]] for Vermont [[1972 United States presidential election|in 1972]], and voted for reelection of the [[Richard M.

Jeffords was a member of the [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|Agriculture]] and [[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|Education and Labor]] Committees, and rose through seniority to become the ranking [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] on Education and Labor.  Jeffords was the only Republican to vote against the [[Ronald Reagan]] tax cuts of 1981, and was a supporter of both abortion rights and expanded protections for the rights of gays and lesbians.  In addition, he was recognized as a moderate-to-liberal Republican because of his pro-environment positions and his support for the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\n===U.S. Senator===\nIn [[United States Senate election in Vermont, 1988|1988]], Jeffords was elected to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], and was reelected in [[1994 United States Senate election in Vermont|1994]] and [[2000 United States Senate election in Vermont|2000]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=J000072|title=JEFFORDS, James Merrill, (1934 \u2013 )|publisher= Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|accessdate= October 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nJeffords long favored expanded access to health care, and supported the plan offered by [[Bill Clinton]] in the early 1990s.  In February 1998, after [[David Satcher]] was confirmed by the Senate for [[Surgeon General of the United States|U.S. Surgeon General]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/02/10/satcher/|title=Satcher Confirmed As Surgeon General|date=February 10, 1998|publisher=CNN}}</ref> President Clinton issued a statement thanking Jeffords and several other senators \"for their strong support for this extremely qualified nominee.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PPP-1998-book1/html/PPP-1998-book1-doc-pg202.htm|title=Statement on Senate Confirmation of David Satcher as Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health|first=Bill|last=Clinton|authorlink=Bill Clinton|publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office|date=February 10, 1998}}</ref>\n\nHe was one of only five Republican senators who voted to acquit Clinton after Clinton was impeached by the U.S. House in 1999.  In October 1999, Jeffords was one of four Republicans to vote in favor of the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]]. The treaty was designed to ban underground nuclear testing and was the first major international security pact to be defeated in the Senate since the [[Treaty of Versailles]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/14/world/defeat-treaty-overview-senate-kills-test-ban-treaty-crushing-loss-for-clinton.html|title=DEFEAT OF A TREATY: THE OVERVIEW; SENATE KILLS TEST BAN TREATY IN CRUSHING LOSS FOR CLINTON; EVOKES VERSAILLES PACT DEFEAT|first=Eric|last=Schmitt|date=October 14, 1999|publisher=New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/oct99/senate14.htm|title=Senate Rejects Test Ban Treaty|date=October 14, 1999|first=Helen|last=Dewar|publisher=Washington Post}}</ref>\n\nJeffords' work in [[United States Congress|Congress]] focused on legislation involving [[education]], job training and individuals with [[disability|disabilities]]. In his later years in the [[United States Senate|Senate]], his emphasis shifted somewhat, as he pushed through Congress several important pieces of [[natural environment|environmental]] legislations. He was, together with [[Paul Simon (politician)|Paul Simon]], credited by Canadian Lieutenant-General [[Rom\u00e9o Dallaire]], Force Commander of the [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda]] (UNAMIR) from 1993 to 1994, for actively lobbying the US administration into mounting a humanitarian mission to [[Rwanda]] during the [[Rwandan genocide]]. According to Dallaire's book, ''[[Shake Hands with the Devil (book)|Shake Hands with the Devil]]'', he \"owe(s) a great debt of gratitude\" to both senators.\n\nJeffords was one of the founders of the Congressional Solar Coalition and the Congressional Arts Caucus. Jeffords was frequently recognized for his performance as a legislator, receiving ''[[Parenting (magazine)|Parenting]]'' magazine's \"Legislator of the Year\" award in 1999, and the [[Sierra Club]]'s highest commendation in 2002.\n\nDuring part of his tenure in the Senate, Jeffords sat at the [[Candy Desk]].\n{{gallery\n|File:State Senator Jeffords.jpg\n |Jeffords during his tenure as a state senator\n|File:JimJeffords.png\n |Jeffords in 1975, as a freshman congressman\n|File:Christopher Dodd and Jim Jeffords speaking at the Pentagon, May 2000.jpg\n |Jeffords (right) with fellow US senator [[Chris Dodd]] at the Pentagon, speaking on defense issues, May 2000.\n}}\n\n==Departure from the GOP==\nOn May 24, 2001, Jeffords [[party switching|left the Republican Party]], with which he had always been affiliated, and announced his new status as an independent. Jeffords discussed this decision during his announcement that he was leaving the Republican Party. \"I will make this change and will caucus with the Democrats for organizational purposes once the conference report on the tax bill is sent to the president. I gave my word to the president that I would not intercept or try to intervene in the signing of that bill.\" Jeffords' opposition to the policies of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W.

Following the election, Democrats sought out a Republican to defect from the Republican caucus, which would give Democrats control of the chamber. Democratic whip [[Harry Reid]] courted Jeffords, [[Lincoln Chafee]], and [[John McCain]] as potential party-switchers. After being promised the chairmanship of the [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Environment and Public Works Committee]] to offset his loss of a committee chairmanship under Republican control, Jeffords decided to change parties, and gave up the chairmanship of the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions|Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee]], which he had held since 1997. Jeffords' switch gave Democrats [[United States Presidents and control of Congress|control]] of a chamber of Congress for the first time since the [[United States elections, 1994|1994 elections]], and Jeffords is the only senator in history to tip the balance of power in the Senate by switching parties.<ref name=Arc/> However, the effects were not long-lasting: 18 months later, after Republican [[Jim Talent]] won a [[United States Senate special election in Missouri, 2002|special election to the Senate]] from Missouri, the Senate switched back to GOP hands.\n\nJeffords agreed to vote with the Democrats on all procedural matters except with permission of the [[whip (politics)|whip]], in exchange for the committee seats that would have been available to Jeffords had he been a Democrat during his entire Senate tenure. He was free to vote as he pleased on policy matters, but more often than not voted with the Democrats.\n\nJeffords's party switch made him only the second [[List of United States Senators from Vermont|Senator from Vermont]] to caucus with the Democrats. The seat that Jeffords occupied had been held by a [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] from 1857, when [[Solomon Foot]] joined the new party, until Jeffords became an Independent in 2001.\n\n==Senate record==\nEven before switching parties, Jeffords's voting record was moderate-to-liberal, which was typical of Republicans affiliated with Vermont's [[George Aiken|Aiken]]-[[Ernest W. Gibson, Jr.|Gibson]] wing. (The Aiken-Gibson wing of the Vermont Republican Party were those party activists and office holders identified with progressive policies.  The party's conservatives comprised a pro-business wing, which was led by the [[List of United States political families (P)#The Proctors|Proctor]], [[List of United States political families (F)#The Fairbanks|Fairbanks]], and [[List of United States political families (S)#The Smiths of Vermont|Smith]] families.  In addition to Aiken and Gibson, other members of their wing of the party in the 1950s and 1960s included Jeffords and [[Robert Stafford]].  Members of the party's conservative wing included [[Harold J. Arthur]], [[Lee E. Emerson]], and [[Winston L. Prouty]].)\n\nBy the time of his switch, no Republican Senator had a lower lifetime score from the [[American Conservative Union]]. In 1981, Jeffords was the only Republican member of the House to vote against a bill reducing the top [[tax rate]] from 70 per cent to 50 per cent&nbsp;\u2014 a hallmark of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s legacy. During his time in the Senate, he voted for the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act|Brady Bill]], the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]], an end to the [[Don't ask, don't tell|ban on gays serving in the military]], and against permanent normal trade relations with China and barring [[affirmative action]] at the federal level. Jeffords was also vocal in his opposition to the nomination of [[Clarence Thomas]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] by President [[George H. W. Bush]]. He was one of only two Republicans to vote against confirming Clarence Thomas. In 1993, he was the only prominent Republican to support President Clinton's unsuccessful attempt to [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|establish a national healthcare plan]]. Jeffords's voting record and positions on environmental issues put further distance between himself and his Republican Party colleagues.\n\nJeffords consistently voted against the ban on [[Intact dilation and extraction|partial-birth abortion]], and also against a harsher line on [[Cuba]]. In 1995, Jeffords was one of two Republican Senators, the other being [[Bill Frist]] of [[Tennessee]], to vote in favor of confirming Dr. [[Henry Foster (doctor)|Henry Foster]] as [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]];<ref>{{cite news |last=Cimons |first=Marlene |date=May 4, 1995 |title=GOP Senator Pledges Support for Foster: James Jeffords' decision assures surgeon general nominee at least a tie vote on panel.

In 1995 he was one of only 16 Senators to vote against the [[Communications Decency Act]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] later struck it down as unconstitutional. Jeffords highly advocated LGBT rights in the workplace. He sponsored The Employee Non Discrimination Act of 1995 (104th Congress), 1997 (105th Congress), and 1999 (106th Congress). Jeffords' non-discrimination bills did not include \"gender identity.\" He was in the minority of Republicans to oppose the [[Flag Desecration Amendment]]. On guns his record was mixed, despite voting for the Brady Bill and the [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban]], he voted with gun control opponents against background checks at gun shows in 1999 and he voted with the majority of [[United States Congress|Congress]] for the [[Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act]]. He took a more moderate line on the death penalty. On many economic issues Jeffords was roughly in line with the majority of the Republican Party, before and after his switch: he mostly supported free-trade agreements, voted for making enforcement of consumer protection laws more difficult by moving many class-action lawsuits into federal courts, tighter bankruptcy rules and a [[balanced budget amendment]]. Even after becoming an independent, he did vote with Republicans on many major pieces of legislation. For example, Jeffords did vote against the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act, a bill supported strongly by Republican [[John McCain]] and many moderate Republicans like [[Olympia Snowe]], [[Arlen Specter]] and [[Mike DeWine]]. Two years later he voted for the prescription drug bill, derided by many [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] as a give away to drug companies and opposed by many [[Conservatism|conservative]] Republicans who opposed further federal spending, but ultimately strongly supported by President [[George W. Bush]], and the vast majority of the Republican Party.\n\nOn October 11, 2002, Jeffords was one of 23 senators to vote against authorizing the [[Iraq Resolution|use of military force in Iraq]]. Shortly after that, he was one of only nine senators to vote against the bill establishing the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]. On November 11, 2003 Jeffords was one of only four senators to vote against the [[Syria Accountability Act|Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act]], a bill that received strong support from politicians from across the aisle.\n\n==Retirement and death==\nIn April 2005, the 70-year-old Jeffords announced his decision not to run for re-election in 2006 citing health issues.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/james-m-jeffords-vermont-republican-who-became-independent-dies-at-80/2014/08/18/b28edd80-26ea-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html|title=James M.

Sworn into the Senate in 1989, he served as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] until 2001, when he left the party to become an [[Independent politician|independent]] and began caucusing with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. Jeffords retired from the Senate in 2007. Prior to serving in the Senate, he served as the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|VT|AL}} from 1975 to 1989.\n\nThe son of [[Olin M. Jeffords]], who served as Chief Justice of the [[Vermont Supreme Court]], James Jeffords was born in [[Rutland (city), Vermont|Rutland, Vermont]].  He graduated from [[Yale University]], served for three years in the [[United States Navy]], and then attended [[Harvard Law School]], from which he received his degree in 1962.  Jeffords practiced law in southern Vermont and became a resident of [[Shrewsbury, Vermont|Shrewsbury]], where he was active in local politics and government as a Republican, including serving as chairman of the town's Republican committee.  He served one term in the [[Vermont Senate]] (1967-1969), and two as [[Attorney General of Vermont]] (1969-1973).  He lost the 1972 Republican primary for [[Governor of Vermont]], but won the election for Vermont's lone seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1974.  He served in the House from 1975 to 1989; in 1988 he was the successful Republican nominee for the [[United States Senate]] seat held by the retiring [[Robert Stafford]].\n\nJeffords served in the Senate from 1989 until 2007, winning reelection in 1994 and 2000.  In 2001, he made national headlines when he left the Republican Party to become an independent, and began to caucus with the Senate's [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].  His switch changed control of the Senate from Republican to Democratic, the first time a switch had ever changed party control.  During his Senate career, Jeffords served as chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Public Works]] and [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions|Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions]] Committees.\n\nIn 2005, Jeffords announced that he would not run for reelection in 2006, and would retire at the end of his term.  He was succeeded by [[Bernie Sanders]].  Jeffords retired to Shrewsbury in 2007.  After the death of his wife, he moved to the Washington, DC area to live closer to his children.  He died in 2014 from complications associated with Alzheimer's disease, and was buried in Shrewsbury.\n\n==Background==\nJeffords was born in [[Rutland (city), Vermont|Rutland, Vermont]], the son of Marion (n\u00e9e Hausman) and [[Olin M.

During 1962 and 1963 he was a law clerk for [[Ernest W. Gibson Jr.]], Judge of the [[United States District Court for the District of Vermont]], afterwards practicing law in Rutland.\n\nA longtime resident of [[Shrewsbury, Vermont|Shrewsbury]], Jeffords became active in politics and government in the 1960s as Shrewsbury's Grand Juror, Town Agent and Zoning Administrator, in addition to serving as chairman of the town's Republican committee. He also served as [[Rutland County, Vermont|Rutland County]]'s chairman of the Board of Property Tax Appeals.<ref>Marquis Who's Who, [https://books.google.com/books?id=N2AaAQAAIAAJ&q=jeffords+shrewsbury+grand+juror&dq=jeffords+shrewsbury+grand+juror&hl=en&sa=X&ei=n_oMU-m-IKW80AHcv4HYBQ&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBA Who's Who in Government], Volume 3, 1977, page 300</ref>\n\nJeffords married Elizabeth \"Liz\" Daley twice, first in 1961, which ended with a June 1978 divorce. On August 26, 1986, they married again. Liz Jeffords died on the morning of April 13, 2007, after a long struggle with ovarian cancer. Jeffords and his wife had two children, Leonard and Laura, both of whom live and work in the [[Washington, D.C.]], area. After his wife's death, Jeffords resided in Washington, D.C., a move he made in order to live near his son and daughter.<ref>James M.

He followed that success in 1968 with a victory in the race for [[Attorney General of Vermont]]. He was a [[Electoral College (United States)|Presidential Elector]] for Vermont [[1972 United States presidential election|in 1972]], and voted for reelection of the [[Richard M.

Jeffords was a member of the [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|Agriculture]] and [[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|Education and Labor]] Committees, and rose through seniority to become the ranking [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] on Education and Labor.  Jeffords was the only Republican to vote against the [[Ronald Reagan]] tax cuts of 1981, and was a supporter of both abortion rights and expanded protections for the rights of gays and lesbians.  In addition, he was recognized as a moderate-to-liberal Republican because of his pro-environment positions and his support for the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\n===U.S. Senator===\nIn [[United States Senate election in Vermont, 1988|1988]], Jeffords was elected to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], and was reelected in [[1994 United States Senate election in Vermont|1994]] and [[2000 United States Senate election in Vermont|2000]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=J000072|title=JEFFORDS, James Merrill, (1934 \u2013 )|publisher= Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|accessdate= October 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nJeffords long favored expanded access to health care, and supported the plan offered by [[Bill Clinton]] in the early 1990s.  In February 1998, after [[David Satcher]] was confirmed by the Senate for [[Surgeon General of the United States|U.S. Surgeon General]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/02/10/satcher/|title=Satcher Confirmed As Surgeon General|date=February 10, 1998|publisher=CNN}}</ref> President Clinton issued a statement thanking Jeffords and several other senators \"for their strong support for this extremely qualified nominee.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PPP-1998-book1/html/PPP-1998-book1-doc-pg202.htm|title=Statement on Senate Confirmation of David Satcher as Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health|first=Bill|last=Clinton|authorlink=Bill Clinton|publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office|date=February 10, 1998}}</ref>\n\nHe was one of only five Republican senators who voted to acquit Clinton after Clinton was impeached by the U.S. House in 1999.  In October 1999, Jeffords was one of four Republicans to vote in favor of the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]]. The treaty was designed to ban underground nuclear testing and was the first major international security pact to be defeated in the Senate since the [[Treaty of Versailles]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/14/world/defeat-treaty-overview-senate-kills-test-ban-treaty-crushing-loss-for-clinton.html|title=DEFEAT OF A TREATY: THE OVERVIEW; SENATE KILLS TEST BAN TREATY IN CRUSHING LOSS FOR CLINTON; EVOKES VERSAILLES PACT DEFEAT|first=Eric|last=Schmitt|date=October 14, 1999|publisher=New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/oct99/senate14.htm|title=Senate Rejects Test Ban Treaty|date=October 14, 1999|first=Helen|last=Dewar|publisher=Washington Post}}</ref>\n\nJeffords' work in [[United States Congress|Congress]] focused on legislation involving [[education]], job training and individuals with [[disability|disabilities]]. In his later years in the [[United States Senate|Senate]], his emphasis shifted somewhat, as he pushed through Congress several important pieces of [[natural environment|environmental]] legislations. He was, together with [[Paul Simon (politician)|Paul Simon]], credited by Canadian Lieutenant-General [[Rom\u00e9o Dallaire]], Force Commander of the [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda]] (UNAMIR) from 1993 to 1994, for actively lobbying the US administration into mounting a humanitarian mission to [[Rwanda]] during the [[Rwandan genocide]]. According to Dallaire's book, ''[[Shake Hands with the Devil (book)|Shake Hands with the Devil]]'', he \"owe(s) a great debt of gratitude\" to both senators.\n\nJeffords was one of the founders of the Congressional Solar Coalition and the Congressional Arts Caucus. Jeffords was frequently recognized for his performance as a legislator, receiving ''[[Parenting (magazine)|Parenting]]'' magazine's \"Legislator of the Year\" award in 1999, and the [[Sierra Club]]'s highest commendation in 2002.\n\nDuring part of his tenure in the Senate, Jeffords sat at the [[Candy Desk]].\n{{gallery\n|File:State Senator Jeffords.jpg\n |Jeffords during his tenure as a state senator\n|File:JimJeffords.png\n |Jeffords in 1975, as a freshman congressman\n|File:Christopher Dodd and Jim Jeffords speaking at the Pentagon, May 2000.jpg\n |Jeffords (right) with fellow US senator [[Chris Dodd]] at the Pentagon, speaking on defense issues, May 2000.\n}}\n\n==Departure from the GOP==\nOn May 24, 2001, Jeffords [[party switching|left the Republican Party]], with which he had always been affiliated, and announced his new status as an independent. Jeffords discussed this decision during his announcement that he was leaving the Republican Party. \"I will make this change and will caucus with the Democrats for organizational purposes once the conference report on the tax bill is sent to the president. I gave my word to the president that I would not intercept or try to intervene in the signing of that bill.\" Jeffords' opposition to the policies of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W.

Given the changing nature of the national party, it has become a struggle for our leaders to deal with me and for me to deal with them.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Jeffords Leaves Republican Party|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20010524/aponline101750_000.htm|accessdate=September 17, 2014|publisher=Washington Post|date=May 24, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Senate elections, 2000|2000 Senate elections]] had left the Senate with a 50\u201350 split in partisan control, forcing Democrats and Republicans to negotiate an unusual power-sharing arrangement (although Republican [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] could [[List of tie-breaking votes cast by Vice Presidents of the United States|break tie votes]]). Following the election, Democrats sought out a Republican to defect from the Republican caucus, which would give Democrats control of the chamber. Democratic whip [[Harry Reid]] courted Jeffords, [[Lincoln Chafee]], and [[John McCain]] as potential party-switchers. After being promised the chairmanship of the [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Environment and Public Works Committee]] to offset his loss of a committee chairmanship under Republican control, Jeffords decided to change parties, and gave up the chairmanship of the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions|Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee]], which he had held since 1997. Jeffords' switch gave Democrats [[United States Presidents and control of Congress|control]] of a chamber of Congress for the first time since the [[United States elections, 1994|1994 elections]], and Jeffords is the only senator in history to tip the balance of power in the Senate by switching parties.<ref name=Arc/> However, the effects were not long-lasting: 18 months later, after Republican [[Jim Talent]] won a [[United States Senate special election in Missouri, 2002|special election to the Senate]] from Missouri, the Senate switched back to GOP hands.\n\nJeffords agreed to vote with the Democrats on all procedural matters except with permission of the [[whip (politics)|whip]], in exchange for the committee seats that would have been available to Jeffords had he been a Democrat during his entire Senate tenure. He was free to vote as he pleased on policy matters, but more often than not voted with the Democrats.\n\nJeffords's party switch made him only the second [[List of United States Senators from Vermont|Senator from Vermont]] to caucus with the Democrats. The seat that Jeffords occupied had been held by a [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] from 1857, when [[Solomon Foot]] joined the new party, until Jeffords became an Independent in 2001.\n\n==Senate record==\nEven before switching parties, Jeffords's voting record was moderate-to-liberal, which was typical of Republicans affiliated with Vermont's [[George Aiken|Aiken]]-[[Ernest W. Gibson, Jr.|Gibson]] wing. (The Aiken-Gibson wing of the Vermont Republican Party were those party activists and office holders identified with progressive policies.  The party's conservatives comprised a pro-business wing, which was led by the [[List of United States political families (P)#The Proctors|Proctor]], [[List of United States political families (F)#The Fairbanks|Fairbanks]], and [[List of United States political families (S)#The Smiths of Vermont|Smith]] families.  In addition to Aiken and Gibson, other members of their wing of the party in the 1950s and 1960s included Jeffords and [[Robert Stafford]].  Members of the party's conservative wing included [[Harold J. Arthur]], [[Lee E. Emerson]], and [[Winston L. Prouty]].)\n\nBy the time of his switch, no Republican Senator had a lower lifetime score from the [[American Conservative Union]]. In 1981, Jeffords was the only Republican member of the House to vote against a bill reducing the top [[tax rate]] from 70 per cent to 50 per cent&nbsp;\u2014 a hallmark of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s legacy. During his time in the Senate, he voted for the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act|Brady Bill]], the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]], an end to the [[Don't ask, don't tell|ban on gays serving in the military]], and against permanent normal trade relations with China and barring [[affirmative action]] at the federal level. Jeffords was also vocal in his opposition to the nomination of [[Clarence Thomas]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] by President [[George H. W. Bush]]. He was one of only two Republicans to vote against confirming Clarence Thomas. In 1993, he was the only prominent Republican to support President Clinton's unsuccessful attempt to [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|establish a national healthcare plan]]. Jeffords's voting record and positions on environmental issues put further distance between himself and his Republican Party colleagues.\n\nJeffords consistently voted against the ban on [[Intact dilation and extraction|partial-birth abortion]], and also against a harsher line on [[Cuba]]. In 1995, Jeffords was one of two Republican Senators, the other being [[Bill Frist]] of [[Tennessee]], to vote in favor of confirming Dr. [[Henry Foster (doctor)|Henry Foster]] as [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]];<ref>{{cite news |last=Cimons |first=Marlene |date=May 4, 1995 |title=GOP Senator Pledges Support for Foster: James Jeffords' decision assures surgeon general nominee at least a tie vote on panel.

In 1995 he was one of only 16 Senators to vote against the [[Communications Decency Act]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] later struck it down as unconstitutional. Jeffords highly advocated LGBT rights in the workplace. He sponsored The Employee Non Discrimination Act of 1995 (104th Congress), 1997 (105th Congress), and 1999 (106th Congress). Jeffords' non-discrimination bills did not include \"gender identity.\" He was in the minority of Republicans to oppose the [[Flag Desecration Amendment]]. On guns his record was mixed, despite voting for the Brady Bill and the [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban]], he voted with gun control opponents against background checks at gun shows in 1999 and he voted with the majority of [[United States Congress|Congress]] for the [[Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act]]. He took a more moderate line on the death penalty. On many economic issues Jeffords was roughly in line with the majority of the Republican Party, before and after his switch: he mostly supported free-trade agreements, voted for making enforcement of consumer protection laws more difficult by moving many class-action lawsuits into federal courts, tighter bankruptcy rules and a [[balanced budget amendment]]. Even after becoming an independent, he did vote with Republicans on many major pieces of legislation. For example, Jeffords did vote against the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act, a bill supported strongly by Republican [[John McCain]] and many moderate Republicans like [[Olympia Snowe]], [[Arlen Specter]] and [[Mike DeWine]]. Two years later he voted for the prescription drug bill, derided by many [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] as a give away to drug companies and opposed by many [[Conservatism|conservative]] Republicans who opposed further federal spending, but ultimately strongly supported by President [[George W.

He is {{height|m=2.13}}, and plays the [[Center (basketball)|center]] position. Mili\u010di\u0107 played in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) from 2003 to 2013. He is the [[List of oldest and youngest National Basketball Association players|fourth youngest player]] and the youngest foreign player to have played in the NBA, and is the youngest player to have played in an NBA Finals game.\n\nMili\u010di\u0107 was selected by the [[Detroit Pistons]] as the second overall pick in the [[2003 NBA draft]]; he was chosen after number one pick [[LeBron James]] and ahead of other future NBA stars like [[Carmelo Anthony]], [[Chris Bosh]] and [[Dwyane Wade]]. Despite being selected with a high draft pick, Mili\u010di\u0107 failed to play at the level expected of him in the NBA and is widely regarded as a draft bust. While he won an NBA championship with the Pistons in 2004, Mili\u010di\u0107 never received significant playing time during his two-and-one-half seasons with the team and was traded to the [[Orlando Magic]] in 2006. Following stints with the Magic, the [[Memphis Grizzlies]], and the [[New York Knicks]], Mili\u010di\u0107 was traded to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] in 2010 and signed a four-year contract with the team that summer. After being released by Minnesota in 2012, he played one regular-season game for the [[Boston Celtics]] later that year before being released. Mili\u010di\u0107 announced his retirement from the NBA in June 2013; he retired with career averages of 6.0 points and 4.2 rebounds per game.\n\nIn international play, Mili\u010di\u0107 has played for the [[Serbia national basketball team|Serbian national basketball team]].\n\n==Early life==\nMili\u010di\u0107's parents are Milorad and Zora.

{{IPA-sh|\u02c8darko \u02c8milit\u0361\u0283it\u0361\u0255|sr}}; born June 20, 1985) is a Serbian professional [[basketball]] player for [[KK I Came To Play|I Came To Play]]. He is {{height|m=2.13}}, and plays the [[Center (basketball)|center]] position. Mili\u010di\u0107 played in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) from 2003 to 2013. He is the [[List of oldest and youngest National Basketball Association players|fourth youngest player]] and the youngest foreign player to have played in the NBA, and is the youngest player to have played in an NBA Finals game.\n\nMili\u010di\u0107 was selected by the [[Detroit Pistons]] as the second overall pick in the [[2003 NBA draft]]; he was chosen after number one pick [[LeBron James]] and ahead of other future NBA stars like [[Carmelo Anthony]], [[Chris Bosh]] and [[Dwyane Wade]]. Despite being selected with a high draft pick, Mili\u010di\u0107 failed to play at the level expected of him in the NBA and is widely regarded as a draft bust. While he won an NBA championship with the Pistons in 2004, Mili\u010di\u0107 never received significant playing time during his two-and-one-half seasons with the team and was traded to the [[Orlando Magic]] in 2006. Following stints with the Magic, the [[Memphis Grizzlies]], and the [[New York Knicks]], Mili\u010di\u0107 was traded to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] in 2010 and signed a four-year contract with the team that summer. After being released by Minnesota in 2012, he played one regular-season game for the [[Boston Celtics]] later that year before being released. Mili\u010di\u0107 announced his retirement from the NBA in June 2013; he retired with career averages of 6.0 points and 4.2 rebounds per game.\n\nIn international play, Mili\u010di\u0107 has played for the [[Serbia national basketball team|Serbian national basketball team]].\n\n==Early life==\nMili\u010di\u0107's parents are Milorad and Zora. During the [[Yugoslav Wars]], when Mili\u010di\u0107 was not yet 10, he heard a news report in which his father was named as one of several Serbian soldiers killed in action; however, a few minutes later, the newscaster indicated some of the soldiers, including his father, had been incorrectly included as killed. His father ultimately survived the wars.<ref name=Borden>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/20211833/nba-bust-darko-milicic-finds-success-back-home-serbia |title=Finding Darko |first=Sam |last=Borden |publisher=ESPN.com |date=August 2, 2017 |accessdate=August 2, 2017}}</ref> His parents' families hail from Janj near [[\u0160ipovo]] in Bosanska Krajina.<ref name=telegraf88873>{{cite news|title=Mili\u010di\u0107 - srpski vitez opevan u osmercu (VIDEO)|url=http://www.telegraf.rs/sport/88873-milicic-srpski-vitez-opevan-u-osmercu-video|accessdate=16 July 2015|work=Telegraf.rs|date=25 February 2012|language=sr}}</ref> His sister Tijana is a volleyball player.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/2003-03-31-darko-focus_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Serbian teen lost in King James' shadow | first1=David | last1=DuPree | date=April 2, 2003 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of 14, Mili\u010di\u0107 started playing basketball with the Serbian team [[KK Hemofarm|Hemofarm's]] junior team.<ref name=\"auto3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/vault/2003/03/03/338924/darko-milicic-this-17-year-old-7-footer-may-be-the-nbas-no-2-draft-pick|title=Darko Milicic This 17-year-old 7-footer may be the NBA's No. 2 draft pick|first=Ian|last=Thomsen|website=Sports Illustrated|date=March 3, 2003}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/nba/story?id=1586626|title=Hemofarm Vrsac says it has Piston through 2009|date=July 28, 2003|website=ESPN.com}}</ref> He was later called up from the junior team before being drafted by the NBA's Detroit Pistons in 2003.<ref name=\"auto3\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pistonpowered.com/2010/09/13/myth-detroit-pistons-picking-darko-milicic-over-carmelo-anthony-with-the-no-2-pick-in-the-2003-nba-draft-was-an-avoidable-blunder/|title=Myth: Detroit Pistons picking Darko Milicic over Carmelo Anthony with the No. 2 pick in the 2003 NBA Draft was an avoidable blunder|last=Feldman|first=Dan|date=September 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==NBA career==\n===Detroit Pistons (2003\u20132006)===\nThe Detroit Pistons chose Mili\u010di\u0107 with the second overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft.<ref name=\"auto1\" /> Unlike most teams with high draft choices, the Pistons were a good team that had made the Eastern Conference Finals [[2002\u201303 NBA season|the season before they drafted Mili\u010di\u0107]].

These were considered the most widespread and most likely to be adopted by speakers from other regions.<ref name=\"prores\" /> The initial idea to select this region as a base was first proposed in [[Krste Petkov Misirkov]]'s works as he believed the Macedonian language should abstract on those dialects that are distinct from neighbouring Slavic languages, such as Bulgarian and Serbian.<ref>Dedai\u0107, Mirjana N. et al. ''South Slavic Discourse Particles''; John Benjamins Publishing (2010) p. 13</ref> Likewise, this view does not take into account the fact that a Macedonian [[koin\u00e9 language]] was already in existence.<ref name=\"Comrie251\">{{Harvnb|Comrie|Corbett|2002|p=251}}</ref>\n\nBased on a large group of features, Macedonian dialects can be divided into Eastern, Western and Northern groups (the boundary geographically runs approximately from [[Skopje]] and [[Skopska Crna Gora]] along the rivers [[Vardar]] and Crna).<ref name=\"u103\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=103}}</ref> There are numerous [[isogloss]]es between these dialectal variations, with structural differences in phonetics, prosody (accentuation), morphology and syntax.<ref name=\"u103\" /> \n\nVariations in consonants occur between the two groups, with most Western regions losing the /x/ and the /v/ in intervocalic position (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430'' (head): /\u0261lava/  = /\u0261la/: ''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438'' (heads): /\u0261lavi/ = /\u0261laj/) while Eastern dialects preserve it. Stress in the Western dialects is generally fixed and falls on the antepenultimate syllable while Eastern dialects have non-fixed stress systems that can fall on any syllable of the word,<ref name=\"usikova110\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=111}}</ref> that is also reminiscent of Bulgarian dialects. Additionally, Eastern dialects are distinguishable by their fast tonality, [[elision]] of sounds and the suffixes for definiteness. The Northern dialectal group is close to South Serbian and [[Torlakian dialects]] and is characterized by 46\u201347 phonetic and grammatical isoglosses.<ref name=\"u104\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=104}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, a more detailed classification can be based on the modern reflexes of the [[Proto-Slavic]] reduced vowels ([[yer]]s), vocalic sonorants, and the back nasal *\u01eb. That classification distinguishes between the following 6 groups:<ref>{{Harvnb|Comrie|Corbett|2002|p=247}}</ref>\n\nWestern Dialects:\n* '''Ohrid-Prespa Group''': [[Ohrid dialect]], [[Struga dialect]], [[Vev\u010dani-Rado\u017eda dialect]], [[Upper Prespa dialect]] and [[Lower Prespa dialect]].\n* '''Debar Group''': [[Debar dialect]], [[Reka dialect]], [[Drimkol-Golo Brdo dialect]], [[Gali\u010dnik dialect]], [[Skopska Crna Gora dialect]] and [[Na\u0161inski|Gora dialect]]\n* '''Polog Group''': [[Upper Polog dialect]], [[Lower Polog dialect]], [[Prilep-Bitola dialect]], [[Ki\u010devo-Pore\u010de dialect]] and [[Skopje-Veles dialect]]\n* '''Kostur-Kor\u010da Group''': [[Kor\u010da dialect]], [[Kostur dialect]] and [[Nestram-Kostenar dialect]]\n\nEastern Dialects:\n* '''Northern Group''': [[Kumanovo dialect]], [[Kratovo dialect]], [[Kriva Palanka dialect]] and [[Ov\u010de Pole dialect]]\n* '''Eastern Group''': [[\u0160tip - Ko\u010dani dialect]], [[Strumica dialect]], [[Tikve\u0161-Mariovo dialect]], [[Male\u0161evo-Pirin dialect]],  [[Solun-Voden dialect]] and [[Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop dialect]].\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Listen\n| type          = speech\n| header        = \n| filename      = Prilep-Bitola dialect speech - Bitola.ogg\n| title         = Bitola dialect\n| description   = Spoken Macedonian in a folk story as spoken in the dialect of [[Bitola]]\n| filename2     = Prilep-Bitola dialect speech - Topol\u010dani.ogg\n| title2        = Prilep dialect\n| description2  = Spoken Macedonian in a folk story as spoken in the dialect of [[Prilep]]\n\n}}\n{{main|Macedonian phonology}}\nThe [[phonology|phonological]] system of Standard Macedonian is based on the [[Prilep-Bitola dialect]].

The individual letters of [[acronyms]] are pronounced with the schwa in the same way: {{angbr|[[Macedonian Orthodox Church|\u041c\u041f\u0426]]}} ({{IPA|[m\u0259.p\u0259.t\u0361s\u0259]}}).

[[Vowel length]] is not phonemic. Vowels in stressed open syllables in disyllablic words with stress on the penultimate can be realized as long, e.g. {{angbr|\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0441}} {{IPA-mk|\u02c8v\u025b\u02d0l\u025bs||Mk-Veles.ogg}} '[[Veles (city)|Veles]]'.

In other words, two vowels appearing next to each other can also be pronounced twice separately (e.g. ''\u043f\u043e\u043e\u0434\u0438'' - to walk).<ref name=\"usikova111\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=111}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n|+ Vowels<ref name=\"Friedman 2001 10\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Lunt|1952|pp=10\u201311}}</ref>\n!\n!

The dental nasal ({{IPA|/n/}}) and dental lateral ({{IPA|/\u026b/}}) are also syllabic in certain foreign words; e.g. {{angbr|\u045a\u0443\u0442\u043d}} {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0272utn\u0329]}} '[[Newton (unit)|newton]]', {{angbr|\u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0442\u043b}} {{IPA|[p\u0254p\u0254ka\u02c8t\u025bp\u025bt\u026b\u0329]}} '[[Popocat\u00e9petl]]', etc. The [[labiodental nasal]] {{IPA|[\u0271]}} occurs as an allophone of {{IPA|/m/}} before {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} (e.g. {{angbr|\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0432\u0430\u0458}} {{IPA|[\u02c8tra\u0271vaj]}} '[[tram]]'). The [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[\u014b]}} similarly occur as an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} before {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} (e.g. {{angbr|\u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438}} {{IPA|[\u02c8a\u014b\u0261liski]}} 'English'). The latter realization is avoided by some speakers who strive for a clear, formal pronunciation.\n\n===Stress===\nThe [[Stress (linguistics)|word stress]] in Macedonian is {{linktext|antepenultimate}} and dynamic (expiratory). This means that it falls on the third from last [[syllable]] in words with three or more syllables, and on the first or only syllable in other words. This is sometimes disregarded when the word has entered the language more recently or from a foreign source.<ref name=\"usikova109\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=109-110}}</ref> To note which syllable of the word should be accented, Macedonian uses an apostrophe over its vowels. [[Disyllabic]] words are stressed on the second-to-last syllable: ''\u0434\u00e9\u0442\u0435'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8d\u025bt\u025b]}}: child), ''\u043c\u00e1\u0458\u043a\u0430'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8majka]}}): mother) and ''\u0442\u00e1\u0442\u043a\u043e'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8tatk\u0254]}}: father). [[Trisyllabic]] and [[polysyllabic]] words are stressed on the third-to-last syllable: ''\u043f\u043b\u00e1\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0430'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8p\u026banina]}}: mountain) ''\u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u045d\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430'' ({{IPA|[p\u026ba\u02c8ninata]}}: the mountain) ''\u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d\u00e1\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435'' ({{IPA|[p\u026bani\u02c8narit\u025b]}}: the mountaineers).<ref name=\"usikova109\" /> There are several exceptions to the rule and they include: [[Participle|verbal adverbs]] (i.e. words suffixed with ''-\u045c\u0438''): e.g. ''\u0432\u0438\u043a\u00e1\u0458\u045c\u0438'' ({{IPA|[vi\u02c8kajci]}}: shouting), ''\u043e\u0434\u00e9\u0458\u045c\u0438'' ({{IPA|[\u0254\u02c8d\u025bjci]}}: walking); adverbs of time: ''\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u00e1\u0432\u0430'' ({{IPA|[godi\u02c8nava]}}: this year), ''\u043b\u0435\u0442\u00f3\u0432\u043e'' ({{IPA|[le\u02c8tovo]}}: this summer); foreign [[loanword]]s: e.g. ''\u043a\u043b\u0438\u0448\u00e9'' ({{IPA|[kli\u02c8\u0283\u025b]}}:clich\u00e9), ''\u0433\u0435\u043d\u00e9\u0437\u0430'' ({{IPA|[\u0261\u025b\u02c8n\u025bza]}} genesis), ''\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u00fd\u0440\u0430'' ({{IPA|[lit\u025bra\u02c8tura]}}: literature), ''\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u00e1\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440'' ({{IPA|[al\u025bk\u02c8sandar]}}, [[Alexander]]).\n\nLinking occurs when two or more words are pronounced with only stress and is a common feature of the Macedonian language. This linguistic phenomenon is called ''\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0442'' and is denoted with a (\u035c ) sign. Several words are taken as a single unit and thus follow the rules of the stress falling on the antepenultimate syllable. The rule applies when using [[clitics]] (either enclitics or proclitics) such as the negating particle ''\u043d\u0435'' with verbs (''\u0442\u043e\u0458 \u043d\u00e9  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435'', he did not come) and with short pronoun forms or the future particle ''\u045c\u0435'' are used in-between (''\u043d\u0435  \u035c  \u043c\u0443  \u035c  \u0458\u00e1  \u035c  \u0434\u0430\u0434\u0435'', did not give it to him; ''\u043d\u0435  \u035c  \u045c\u00e9  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435'', he will not come).<ref name=\"matura\" /> Other uses include the [[imperative form]] accompanied by short pronoun forms (''\u0434\u00e1\u0458  \u035c  \u043c\u0438'': give me), the expression of possessives (''\u043c\u00e1\u0458\u043a\u0430  \u035c  \u043c\u0438''), prepositions followed by a noun (''\u0437\u00e1\u0434  \u035c  \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430''), question words followed by verbs (''\u043a\u043e\u0433\u00e1  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435''), some compound nouns (''\u0441\u0443\u0432\u00f3  \u035c  \u0433\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0458\u0435'' - raisins, ''\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043b\u00f3  \u035c  \u043c\u043b\u0435\u043a\u043e'' - yoghurt) and others.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Macedonian grammar}}\n\nMacedonian grammar is markedly [[Analytic language|analytic]] in comparison with other Slavic languages, having lost the common Slavic case system. The Macedonian language shows some special and, in some cases, unique characteristics due to its central position in the Balkans. Literary Macedonian is the only South Slavic literary language that has three forms of the definite article, based on the degree of proximity to the speaker, and a perfect tense formed by means of an [[auxiliary verb]] \"to have\", followed by a [[past tense|past]] [[participle]] in the [[Neuter gender|neuter]], also known as the [[verbal adjective]].\n\n===Nouns===\nMacedonian [[noun]]s (''\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438'') belong to one of three [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and are [[Inflection|inflected]] for [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular and plural), and marginally for [[grammatical case|case]]. The gender opposition is not distinctively marked in the plural.<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=40}}</ref> Masculine nouns usually end in a consonant or a vowel (''-a'', ''-o''  or ''-e'') and neuter nouns end in a vowel (''-o'' or ''-e''). Virtually all feminine nouns end in the same consonant, ''-a''.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe [[vocative]] of nouns is the only remaining case in the Macedonian language and is used to address a person directly. The vocative case always ends with a vowel, which can be either an -\u0443 (''\u0458\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0443'': hero vocative) or an -e (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435'': man vocative) to the root of masculine nouns. For feminine nouns, the most common final vowel ending in the vocative is -o (''\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043e'', sweetheart vocative; ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e'', wife vocative). The final suffix -e can be used in the following cases: three or polysyllabic words with the ending ''-\u0438\u0446\u0430'' (''\u043c\u0430\u0458\u0447\u0438\u0446\u0435'', mother vocative), female given names that end with ''-\u043a\u0430'': ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430'' becomes ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0435'' and ''-\u0458\u0430'': ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430'' becomes ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0435'' or ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u043e''. There is no vocative case in neuter nouns. The role of the vocative is only facultative and there is a general tendency of vocative loss in the language since its use is considered impolite and dialectal.<ref name=\"periods23\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|page=23}}</ref> The vocative can also be expressed by changing the tone.<ref name=\"matura\">{{cite book|last=Bogdanoska|first=Biljana|year=2008|title=\u0417\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a \u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430|trans-title=Macedonian language and literature for students|language=mk|publisher=Bomat Grafiks|location=[[Skopje]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Minova Gjurkova|first=Liljana|title=\u0421\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a|trans-title=Syntax of the standard Macedonian language|language=mk|year=1994}}</ref>\n\nThere are three different types of plural: regular, counted and [[collective noun|collective]]. The first plural type is most common and used to indicate regular plurality of nouns: ''\u043c\u0430\u0436 - \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'' (a man - men), ''\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0430 - \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0438'' (a table - table), ''\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e - \u0441\u0435\u043b\u0430'' (a village - villages). There are various suffixes that are used and they differ per noun gender. Counted plural is used when a number or a [[quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]] precedes the noun; suffixes to express this type of plurality do not correspond with the regular plurality suffixes: ''\u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430'' (two pencils), ''\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430'' (three leaves), ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430'' (several hours). The collective plural is used for nouns that can be viewed as a single unit: ''\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0458\u0435'' (a pile of leaves), ''\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0458\u0435'' (a unit of hills).

As with other Slavic languages, there is no [[indefinite article]] in Macedonian. The [[definite article]] in Macedonian is postpositive, i.e. it is added as a suffix to nouns. An individual feature of the Macedonian language is the use of three [[definite article]]s, inflected for gender and related to the position of the object, which can be unspecified, proximate or distal.\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0432, -\u0432\u0430, -\u0432\u043e, -\u0432\u0435'' are used for objects located close to the speaker (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a'''\u043e\u0432''''': - this person here)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u043d, -\u043d\u0430, -\u043d\u043e, -\u043d\u0435'' are used for objects located further away from the speaker that can still be perceived (''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430''''': - that woman there)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0442, -\u0442\u0430, -\u0442\u043e, -\u0442\u0435'' are most commonly used as general indicators of definiteness regardless of the referred object's position (''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''': the child). Additionally, these suffixes can be used to indicate objects referred to by the speaker that are in the proximity of the listener, e.g. ''\u0434\u0430\u0458 \u043c\u0438 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u043e \u0435 \u0434\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435'' - give me the book next to you.<ref name=\"opsta\" />\n\n[[Proper nouns]] are per definition definite and are not usually used together with an article, although exceptions exist in the spoken and literary language such as ''\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0447\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' to demonstrate feelings of [[endearment]] to a person.\n\n===Pronouns===\nThree types of pronouns can be distinguished in Macedonian: [[personal pronouns|personal]] (''\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0438''), [[relative pronouns|relative]] (''\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e-\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438'') and [[demonstrative pronouns|demonstrative]] (''\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0438''). Case relations are marked in pronouns.\n\nPersonal pronouns in Macedonian appear in three genders and both in singular and plural. They can also appear either as [[accusative|direct]] or [[dative|indirect object]] in long or short forms. Depending on whether a definite direct or indirect object is used, a [[clitic pronoun]] will refer to the object with the verb: ''\u0408\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0443 \u0458\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"I did not give the book to the boy\").<ref name=\"periods437\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|Garry|2001|page=437}}</ref> The direct object is a remnant of the accusative case and the indirect of the dative. Reflexive pronouns also have forms for both direct and indirect objects: ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0435'', ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0438''. Examples of personal pronouns are shown below:\n*Personal pronoun: '''''\u0408\u0430\u0441''' \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043c \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430''.

(\"He told me to come\")\n\nRelative pronouns can refer to a person (''\u043a\u043e\u0458, \u043a\u043e\u0458\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0435'' - who), objects (''\u0448\u0442\u043e'' - which) or serve as indicators of possession (''\u0447\u0438\u0458, \u0447\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u0447\u0438\u0435'' - whose) in the function of a question or a relative word. These pronouns are inflected for gender and number and other word forms can be derived from them (''\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0458'' - nobody, ''\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0442\u043e'' - something, ''\u0441\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0458'' - everybody's). There are three groups of demonstrative pronouns that can indicate proximate (''\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0458'' - this one (mas.)), distal (''\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0430'' - the one there (fem.)) and unspecific (''\u0442\u043e\u0430'' - that one (neut.)) objects.

Macedonian verbs are conventionally divided into three main conjugations according to the [[thematic vowel]] used in the [[citation form]] (i.e. {{Smallcaps|{{lc:[[Grammatical person|3p]]-[[Present tense|pres]]-[[Grammatical number|sg]]}}}}).<ref name=\"opsta\">{{Harvnb|Bojkovska|2008|page=?}}</ref> These groups are: ''a''-group, ''e''-group and ''\u0438''-group. Furthermore, the ''\u0438''-subgroup is divided into three more subgroups: \u0430-, \u0435- and \u0438-subgroups. The verb ''\u0441\u0443\u043c'' (to be) is the only exception to the rule as it ends with a consonant. \n\nThe perfect tense can be formed using both to be (''\u0441\u0443\u043c'') and to have (''\u0438\u043c\u0430''). The first form conjugates the verb to be per person and uses a past active participle: ''\u0441\u0443\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'' (\"I have seen a lot of things\"). The latter form makes use of a clitic that agrees in number and gender with the object of the sentence and the passive participle of the verb in its uninflected form (''\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0430\u043c \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0444\u0438\u043b\u043c\u043e\u0442'', \"I have seen that movie\").<ref name=\"u107\" /><ref name=\"periods33\" /> Another past form, the aorist is used to describe actions that have finished at a given moment in the past: ''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0432'' (\"I walked\"), ''\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0430'' (\"they jumped\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nFuture forms of verbs are conjugated using the particle ''\u045c\u0435'' followed by the verb conjugated in the present tense, ''\u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will go). To express negation in the future, the construction can either be formed by adding the negation particle at the beginning ''\u043d\u0435 \u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will not go) or using the construction ''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430'' (''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'') with no difference in meaning. Another tense is the future-in-the-past tense which is formed using the clitic ''\u045c\u0435'' and a past tense of the verb conjugated for person, ''\u0442\u0430\u0430 \u045c\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0435'' (\"she would have left\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Aspect, transitiveness, mood====\nSimilar to other Slavic languages, Macedonian verbs have a [[grammatical aspect]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434'') that is a [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|typical feature of Slavic languages]]. Per this category, verbs can be divided into [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] (''\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') and [[perfective aspect|perfective]] (''\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') indicating actions whose time duration is unknown or occur repetitively or those that show an action that is finished in one moment. The former group of verbs can be subdivided into verbs which take place without interruption (e.g. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0435 \u0446\u0435\u043b \u0434\u0435\u043d'', \"He sleeps all day long) or those that signify repeated actions (e.g. ''\u0408\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u0434\u0435'', \"He was looking for the book but he could not find it\"). Perfective verbs are usually formed by adding prefixes to the stem of the verb, depending on which, they can express actions that took place in one moment (''\u0447\u0443\u043a\u043d\u0430'', \"knocked\"), actions that have just begun (''\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0430'', \"start to sing\"), actions that have ended (''\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430'', \"read\") or partial actions that last for short periods of time (''\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'', \"worked\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe contrast between transitive and intransitive verbs can be expressed analytically or syntactically and virtually all verbs denoting actions performed by living beings can become transitive if a short personal pronoun is added: ''\u0422\u043ej \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430'' (\"He laid down\") vs. ''\u0422\u043ej \u0433\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"He laid the child down\"). Additionally, verbs which are expressed with the reflexive pronoun ''\u0441\u0435'' can become transitive by using any of the contracted pronoun forms for the direct object: ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u0441\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - He is laughing, vs. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u043c\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - \"He is making me laugh\"). Some verbs such as sleep or die do not traditionally have the property of being transitive.<ref name=\"u117/>\n\nMacedonian verbs have three [[grammatical moods]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d''): [[indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[conditional mood|conditional]]. The imperative mood can express both a wish or an order to finish a certain action. The imperative only has forms for the second person and is formed using the suffixes ''-\u0458'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458''; sing) or ''-\u0438'' (''\u043e\u0434\u0438'', walk) for singular and ''-\u0458\u0442\u0435'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458\u0442\u0435'', sing) or ''-\u0435\u0442\u0435'' for plural (''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', walk). The first and third subject forms in singular and plural express indirect orders and are conjugated using ''\u0434\u0430'' or ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430'' and the verb in present tense (''\u0434\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e'', may we live long). In addition to its primary functions, the imperative is used to indicate actions in the past, eternal truths as is the case in sayings and a condition. The Macedonian conditional is conjugated in the same way for all three persons using the particle ''\u0431\u0438'' and the verbal l-form,  ''\u0431\u0438 \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b'' (I/you/he would read).<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n===Syntax and prepositions===\nMacedonian syntax has a [[subject-verb-object]] (SVO) [[word order]] which is nevertheless flexible and can be [[tropicalization|tropicalized]].<ref name=\"gramatika\" /> For instance, the sentence ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d'' (Marija loves Ivan) can become of the [[object\u2013verb\u2013subject]] (OVS) form as well, ''\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430''.<ref name=\"u116\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=116}}</ref> Tropicalization can also be achieved using a combination of word order and intonation; as an example all of the following sentences give a different point of emphasis:\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the subject)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on both the subject and the verb)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the verb and the object)<ref name=\"Friedman50\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=50}}</ref>\n\nMacedonian is a [[null-subject language]] which means that the subject pronoun can be omitted, for instance ''\u0428\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0448 (\u0442\u0438)?''

In the fourteenth century, the Ottoman Turks invaded and conquered most of the Balkans, incorporating Macedonia into the [[Ottoman Empire]].

During this time, Yugoslav Macedonia became known as [[Vardar Banovina]] (Vardar province) and the language of public life, education and the church was Serbo-Croatian.

The Macedonian language was proclaimed the official language of the Republic of Macedonia at the First Session of the Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia, held on 2 August 1944. The first official Macedonian grammar was developed by Krume Kepeski. One of the most important contributors in the standardisation of the Macedonian literary language was [[Bla\u017ee Koneski]]. The first document written in the literary standard Macedonian language is the first issue of the ''[[Nova Makedonija]]'' newspaper in 1944. ''Makedonska Iskra'' (Macedonian Spark) was the first Macedonian newspaper published in Australia, from 1946 to 1957. Its articles were not in standard Macedonian but in local [[Slavic dialects of Greece]]. A monthly with national distribution, it commenced in Perth and later moved to Melbourne and Sydney.

These were considered the most widespread and most likely to be adopted by speakers from other regions.<ref name=\"prores\" /> The initial idea to select this region as a base was first proposed in [[Krste Petkov Misirkov]]'s works as he believed the Macedonian language should abstract on those dialects that are distinct from neighbouring Slavic languages, such as Bulgarian and Serbian.<ref>Dedai\u0107, Mirjana N. et al. ''South Slavic Discourse Particles''; John Benjamins Publishing (2010) p. 13</ref> Likewise, this view does not take into account the fact that a Macedonian [[koin\u00e9 language]] was already in existence.<ref name=\"Comrie251\">{{Harvnb|Comrie|Corbett|2002|p=251}}</ref>\n\nBased on a large group of features, Macedonian dialects can be divided into Eastern, Western and Northern groups (the boundary geographically runs approximately from [[Skopje]] and [[Skopska Crna Gora]] along the rivers [[Vardar]] and Crna).<ref name=\"u103\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=103}}</ref> There are numerous [[isogloss]]es between these dialectal variations, with structural differences in phonetics, prosody (accentuation), morphology and syntax.<ref name=\"u103\" /> \n\nVariations in consonants occur between the two groups, with most Western regions losing the /x/ and the /v/ in intervocalic position (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430'' (head): /\u0261lava/  = /\u0261la/: ''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438'' (heads): /\u0261lavi/ = /\u0261laj/) while Eastern dialects preserve it. Stress in the Western dialects is generally fixed and falls on the antepenultimate syllable while Eastern dialects have non-fixed stress systems that can fall on any syllable of the word,<ref name=\"usikova110\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=111}}</ref> that is also reminiscent of Bulgarian dialects. Additionally, Eastern dialects are distinguishable by their fast tonality, [[elision]] of sounds and the suffixes for definiteness. The Northern dialectal group is close to South Serbian and [[Torlakian dialects]] and is characterized by 46\u201347 phonetic and grammatical isoglosses.<ref name=\"u104\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=104}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, a more detailed classification can be based on the modern reflexes of the [[Proto-Slavic]] reduced vowels ([[yer]]s), vocalic sonorants, and the back nasal *\u01eb. That classification distinguishes between the following 6 groups:<ref>{{Harvnb|Comrie|Corbett|2002|p=247}}</ref>\n\nWestern Dialects:\n* '''Ohrid-Prespa Group''': [[Ohrid dialect]], [[Struga dialect]], [[Vev\u010dani-Rado\u017eda dialect]], [[Upper Prespa dialect]] and [[Lower Prespa dialect]].\n* '''Debar Group''': [[Debar dialect]], [[Reka dialect]], [[Drimkol-Golo Brdo dialect]], [[Gali\u010dnik dialect]], [[Skopska Crna Gora dialect]] and [[Na\u0161inski|Gora dialect]]\n* '''Polog Group''': [[Upper Polog dialect]], [[Lower Polog dialect]], [[Prilep-Bitola dialect]], [[Ki\u010devo-Pore\u010de dialect]] and [[Skopje-Veles dialect]]\n* '''Kostur-Kor\u010da Group''': [[Kor\u010da dialect]], [[Kostur dialect]] and [[Nestram-Kostenar dialect]]\n\nEastern Dialects:\n* '''Northern Group''': [[Kumanovo dialect]], [[Kratovo dialect]], [[Kriva Palanka dialect]] and [[Ov\u010de Pole dialect]]\n* '''Eastern Group''': [[\u0160tip - Ko\u010dani dialect]], [[Strumica dialect]], [[Tikve\u0161-Mariovo dialect]], [[Male\u0161evo-Pirin dialect]],  [[Solun-Voden dialect]] and [[Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop dialect]].\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Listen\n| type          = speech\n| header        = \n| filename      = Prilep-Bitola dialect speech - Bitola.ogg\n| title         = Bitola dialect\n| description   = Spoken Macedonian in a folk story as spoken in the dialect of [[Bitola]]\n| filename2     = Prilep-Bitola dialect speech - Topol\u010dani.ogg\n| title2        = Prilep dialect\n| description2  = Spoken Macedonian in a folk story as spoken in the dialect of [[Prilep]]\n\n}}\n{{main|Macedonian phonology}}\nThe [[phonology|phonological]] system of Standard Macedonian is based on the [[Prilep-Bitola dialect]].

For the pronunciation of the middle vowels /''\u0435''/ and /''\u043e''/ by native Macedonian speakers, various vowel sounds can be produced ranging from [\u025b] to [\u1eb9] and from [o] to [\u1ecd]. Unstressed vowels are not [[vowel reduction|reduced]], although they are pronounced more weakly and shortly than stressed ones, especially if they are found in a stressed syllable.{{sfn|Friedman|1998|p=252}}<ref name=\"gramatika\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001}}</ref> The five vowels and the letter /''\u0440''/ which acts as a [[semivowel]] when found between two consonants (e.g. ''\u0446\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0430'', \"church\"), can be syllable-forming.<ref name=\"usikova111\" /> \n\nThe [[schwa]] is phonemic in many dialects (varying in closeness to {{IPAblink|\u028c}} or {{IPAblink|\u0268}}) but its use in the standard language is marginal.<ref name=\"Friedman 2001 10\"/> When writing a dialectal word and keeping the schwa for aesthetic effect, an [[apostrophe]] is used; for example, {{angbr|\u043a\u2019\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0442}}, {{angbr|\u0441\u2019\u043d\u0446\u0435}}, etc. When spelling words letter-by-letters, each consonant is followed by the schwa sound. The individual letters of [[acronyms]] are pronounced with the schwa in the same way: {{angbr|[[Macedonian Orthodox Church|\u041c\u041f\u0426]]}} ({{IPA|[m\u0259.p\u0259.t\u0361s\u0259]}}). The lexicalized acronyms {{angbr|[[USSR|\u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420]]}} ({{IPA|[\u025bs.\u025bs.\u025bs.\u025br]}}) and {{angbr|\u041c\u0422}} ({{IPA|[\u025bm.t\u025b]}}) (a brand of cigarettes), are among the few exceptions. [[Vowel length]] is not phonemic. Vowels in stressed open syllables in disyllablic words with stress on the penultimate can be realized as long, e.g. {{angbr|\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0441}} {{IPA-mk|\u02c8v\u025b\u02d0l\u025bs||Mk-Veles.ogg}} '[[Veles (city)|Veles]]'. The sequence {{IPA|/aa/}} is often realized phonetically as {{IPA|[a\u02d0]}}; e.g. {{angbr|\u0441\u0430\u0430\u0442}} {{IPA|/saat/}} {{IPA|[sa\u02d0t]}} '''colloq.'' hour', {{angbr|\u0437\u043c\u0438\u0438}} - snakes. In other words, two vowels appearing next to each other can also be pronounced twice separately (e.g. ''\u043f\u043e\u043e\u0434\u0438'' - to walk).<ref name=\"usikova111\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=111}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n|+ Vowels<ref name=\"Friedman 2001 10\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Lunt|1952|pp=10\u201311}}</ref>\n!\n!

The dental nasal ({{IPA|/n/}}) and dental lateral ({{IPA|/\u026b/}}) are also syllabic in certain foreign words; e.g. {{angbr|\u045a\u0443\u0442\u043d}} {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0272utn\u0329]}} '[[Newton (unit)|newton]]', {{angbr|\u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0442\u043b}} {{IPA|[p\u0254p\u0254ka\u02c8t\u025bp\u025bt\u026b\u0329]}} '[[Popocat\u00e9petl]]', etc. The [[labiodental nasal]] {{IPA|[\u0271]}} occurs as an allophone of {{IPA|/m/}} before {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} (e.g. {{angbr|\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0432\u0430\u0458}} {{IPA|[\u02c8tra\u0271vaj]}} '[[tram]]'). The [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[\u014b]}} similarly occur as an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} before {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} (e.g. {{angbr|\u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438}} {{IPA|[\u02c8a\u014b\u0261liski]}} 'English'). The latter realization is avoided by some speakers who strive for a clear, formal pronunciation.\n\n===Stress===\nThe [[Stress (linguistics)|word stress]] in Macedonian is {{linktext|antepenultimate}} and dynamic (expiratory).

The Macedonian language shows some special and, in some cases, unique characteristics due to its central position in the Balkans. Literary Macedonian is the only South Slavic literary language that has three forms of the definite article, based on the degree of proximity to the speaker, and a perfect tense formed by means of an [[auxiliary verb]] \"to have\", followed by a [[past tense|past]] [[participle]] in the [[Neuter gender|neuter]], also known as the [[verbal adjective]].\n\n===Nouns===\nMacedonian [[noun]]s (''\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438'') belong to one of three [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and are [[Inflection|inflected]] for [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular and plural), and marginally for [[grammatical case|case]]. The gender opposition is not distinctively marked in the plural.<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=40}}</ref> Masculine nouns usually end in a consonant or a vowel (''-a'', ''-o''  or ''-e'') and neuter nouns end in a vowel (''-o'' or ''-e''). Virtually all feminine nouns end in the same consonant, ''-a''.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe [[vocative]] of nouns is the only remaining case in the Macedonian language and is used to address a person directly. The vocative case always ends with a vowel, which can be either an -\u0443 (''\u0458\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0443'': hero vocative) or an -e (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435'': man vocative) to the root of masculine nouns. For feminine nouns, the most common final vowel ending in the vocative is -o (''\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043e'', sweetheart vocative; ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e'', wife vocative). The final suffix -e can be used in the following cases: three or polysyllabic words with the ending ''-\u0438\u0446\u0430'' (''\u043c\u0430\u0458\u0447\u0438\u0446\u0435'', mother vocative), female given names that end with ''-\u043a\u0430'': ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430'' becomes ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0435'' and ''-\u0458\u0430'': ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430'' becomes ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0435'' or ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u043e''. There is no vocative case in neuter nouns. The role of the vocative is only facultative and there is a general tendency of vocative loss in the language since its use is considered impolite and dialectal.<ref name=\"periods23\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|page=23}}</ref> The vocative can also be expressed by changing the tone.<ref name=\"matura\">{{cite book|last=Bogdanoska|first=Biljana|year=2008|title=\u0417\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a \u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430|trans-title=Macedonian language and literature for students|language=mk|publisher=Bomat Grafiks|location=[[Skopje]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Minova Gjurkova|first=Liljana|title=\u0421\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a|trans-title=Syntax of the standard Macedonian language|language=mk|year=1994}}</ref>\n\nThere are three different types of plural: regular, counted and [[collective noun|collective]]. The first plural type is most common and used to indicate regular plurality of nouns: ''\u043c\u0430\u0436 - \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'' (a man - men), ''\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0430 - \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0438'' (a table - table), ''\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e - \u0441\u0435\u043b\u0430'' (a village - villages). There are various suffixes that are used and they differ per noun gender. Counted plural is used when a number or a [[quantifier]] precedes the noun; suffixes to express this type of plurality do not correspond with the regular plurality suffixes: ''\u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430'' (two pencils), ''\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430'' (three leaves), ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430'' (several hours). The collective plural is used for nouns that can be viewed as a single unit: ''\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0458\u0435'' (a pile of leaves), ''\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0458\u0435'' (a unit of hills). Irregular plural forms also exist in the language: ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435 - \u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'' (child - children).<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Definiteness====\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n|+The definite articles\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" |\n!colspan=\"3\" | Singular\n!colspan=\"3\" | Plural\n|-\n!Masculine\n!Feminine\n!Neuter\n!Masculine\n!Feminine\n!Neuter\n|-\n!Unspecified\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u0442''''' \n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u0442\u0430''''' \n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' \n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u0442\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u0442\u0435''''' \n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u0442\u0430'''''\n|-\n!Proximate\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u0432'''''\n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u0432\u0430'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0432o'''''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u0432\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u0432\u0435'''''\n|  ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u0432\u0430'''''\n|-\n!Distal\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u043d'''''\n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u043do'''''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u043d\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u043d\u0435'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u043d\u0430'''''\n|}\n\nA characteristic feature of the nominal system is the indication of [[definiteness]]. As with other Slavic languages, there is no [[indefinite article]] in Macedonian. The [[definite article]] in Macedonian is postpositive, i.e. it is added as a suffix to nouns. An individual feature of the Macedonian language is the use of three [[definite article]]s, inflected for gender and related to the position of the object, which can be unspecified, proximate or distal.\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0432, -\u0432\u0430, -\u0432\u043e, -\u0432\u0435'' are used for objects located close to the speaker (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a'''\u043e\u0432''''': - this person here)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u043d, -\u043d\u0430, -\u043d\u043e, -\u043d\u0435'' are used for objects located further away from the speaker that can still be perceived (''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430''''': - that woman there)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0442, -\u0442\u0430, -\u0442\u043e, -\u0442\u0435'' are most commonly used as general indicators of definiteness regardless of the referred object's position (''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''': the child). Additionally, these suffixes can be used to indicate objects referred to by the speaker that are in the proximity of the listener, e.g. ''\u0434\u0430\u0458 \u043c\u0438 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u043e \u0435 \u0434\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435'' - give me the book next to you.<ref name=\"opsta\" />\n\n[[Proper nouns]] are per definition definite and are not usually used together with an article, although exceptions exist in the spoken and literary language such as ''\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0447\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' to demonstrate feelings of [[endearment]] to a person.\n\n===Pronouns===\nThree types of pronouns can be distinguished in Macedonian: [[personal pronouns|personal]] (''\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0438''), [[relative pronouns|relative]] (''\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e-\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438'') and [[demonstrative pronouns|demonstrative]] (''\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0438''). Case relations are marked in pronouns.\n\nPersonal pronouns in Macedonian appear in three genders and both in singular and plural. They can also appear either as [[accusative|direct]] or [[dative|indirect object]] in long or short forms. Depending on whether a definite direct or indirect object is used, a [[clitic pronoun]] will refer to the object with the verb: ''\u0408\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0443 \u0458\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"I did not give the book to the boy\").<ref name=\"periods437\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|Garry|2001|page=437}}</ref> The direct object is a remnant of the accusative case and the indirect of the dative. Reflexive pronouns also have forms for both direct and indirect objects: ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0435'', ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0438''.

(\"He told me to come\")\n\nRelative pronouns can refer to a person (''\u043a\u043e\u0458, \u043a\u043e\u0458\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0435'' - who), objects (''\u0448\u0442\u043e'' - which) or serve as indicators of possession (''\u0447\u0438\u0458, \u0447\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u0447\u0438\u0435'' - whose) in the function of a question or a relative word.

Macedonian verbs are conventionally divided into three main conjugations according to the [[thematic vowel]] used in the [[citation form]] (i.e. {{Smallcaps|{{lc:[[Grammatical person|3p]]-[[Present tense|pres]]-[[Grammatical number|sg]]}}}}).<ref name=\"opsta\">{{Harvnb|Bojkovska|2008|page=?}}</ref> These groups are: ''a''-group, ''e''-group and ''\u0438''-group. Furthermore, the ''\u0438''-subgroup is divided into three more subgroups: \u0430-, \u0435- and \u0438-subgroups. The verb ''\u0441\u0443\u043c'' (to be) is the only exception to the rule as it ends with a consonant. \n\nThe perfect tense can be formed using both to be (''\u0441\u0443\u043c'') and to have (''\u0438\u043c\u0430''). The first form conjugates the verb to be per person and uses a past active participle: ''\u0441\u0443\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'' (\"I have seen a lot of things\"). The latter form makes use of a clitic that agrees in number and gender with the object of the sentence and the passive participle of the verb in its uninflected form (''\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0430\u043c \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0444\u0438\u043b\u043c\u043e\u0442'', \"I have seen that movie\").<ref name=\"u107\" /><ref name=\"periods33\" /> Another past form, the aorist is used to describe actions that have finished at a given moment in the past: ''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0432'' (\"I walked\"), ''\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0430'' (\"they jumped\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nFuture forms of verbs are conjugated using the particle ''\u045c\u0435'' followed by the verb conjugated in the present tense, ''\u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will go). To express negation in the future, the construction can either be formed by adding the negation particle at the beginning ''\u043d\u0435 \u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will not go) or using the construction ''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430'' (''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'') with no difference in meaning. Another tense is the future-in-the-past tense which is formed using the clitic ''\u045c\u0435'' and a past tense of the verb conjugated for person, ''\u0442\u0430\u0430 \u045c\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0435'' (\"she would have left\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Aspect, transitiveness, mood====\nSimilar to other Slavic languages, Macedonian verbs have a [[grammatical aspect]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434'') that is a [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|typical feature of Slavic languages]]. Per this category, verbs can be divided into [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] (''\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') and [[perfective aspect|perfective]] (''\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') indicating actions whose time duration is unknown or occur repetitively or those that show an action that is finished in one moment. The former group of verbs can be subdivided into verbs which take place without interruption (e.g. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0435 \u0446\u0435\u043b \u0434\u0435\u043d'', \"He sleeps all day long) or those that signify repeated actions (e.g. ''\u0408\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u0434\u0435'', \"He was looking for the book but he could not find it\"). Perfective verbs are usually formed by adding prefixes to the stem of the verb, depending on which, they can express actions that took place in one moment (''\u0447\u0443\u043a\u043d\u0430'', \"knocked\"), actions that have just begun (''\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0430'', \"start to sing\"), actions that have ended (''\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430'', \"read\") or partial actions that last for short periods of time (''\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'', \"worked\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe contrast between transitive and intransitive verbs can be expressed analytically or syntactically and virtually all verbs denoting actions performed by living beings can become transitive if a short personal pronoun is added: ''\u0422\u043ej \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430'' (\"He laid down\") vs. ''\u0422\u043ej \u0433\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"He laid the child down\"). Additionally, verbs which are expressed with the reflexive pronoun ''\u0441\u0435'' can become transitive by using any of the contracted pronoun forms for the direct object: ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u0441\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - He is laughing, vs. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u043c\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - \"He is making me laugh\"). Some verbs such as sleep or die do not traditionally have the property of being transitive.<ref name=\"u117/>\n\nMacedonian verbs have three [[grammatical moods]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d''): [[indicative]], [[imperative]] and [[conditional]]. The imperative mood can express both a wish or an order to finish a certain action. The imperative only has forms for the second person and is formed using the suffixes ''-\u0458'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458''; sing) or ''-\u0438'' (''\u043e\u0434\u0438'', walk) for singular and ''-\u0458\u0442\u0435'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458\u0442\u0435'', sing) or ''-\u0435\u0442\u0435'' for plural (''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', walk). The first and third subject forms in singular and plural express indirect orders and are conjugated using ''\u0434\u0430'' or ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430'' and the verb in present tense (''\u0434\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e'', may we live long).

Although the written language, now called [[Church Slavonic]], remained static as a result of Turkish domination, the spoken dialects moved further apart.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe earliest lexicographic evidence of the Macedonian dialects, described as Bulgarian,<ref>[http://www.slav.uni-sofia.bg/lilijournal/index.php/bg/issues/contents-spring2010/articles-spring2010/170-ilieval-2010 Littera et Lingua] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112190002/http://www.slav.uni-sofia.bg/lilijournal/index.php/bg/issues/contents-spring2010/articles-spring2010/170-ilieval-2010 |date=2013-11-12 }}, {{ISSN|1312-6172}}, \u041f\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442 2010, \u041b\u0438\u043b\u0438\u044f \u0418\u043b\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0435\u0437\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437 XVI \u0438 XVII \u0432\u0435\u043a.</ref> can be found in a lexicon from the 16th century written in the Greek alphabet.<ref>[http://www.mn.mk/docs/Makedonski-Leksikon-XVI-vek.pdf 'Un Lexique Macedonien Du XVIe Siecle'], Giannelli, Ciro.

His work articulated for the first time a distinct pair of two groups of [[Bulgarian dialects]]: Eastern and Western (spoken in today Western Bulgaria and North Macedonia).

Misirkov was born in a village [[Pella (modern)|Postol]] in Ottoman Macedonia. Although literature had been written in the Slavic dialects of Macedonia before, arguably the most important book published in relation to the Macedonian language was Misirkov's ''On Macedonian Matters'', published in 1903. In that book, he argued for creation of a standard literary Macedonian language from the central dialects of Macedonia that would use a [[phonemic orthography]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nAfter the first two Balkan wars, the region of Macedonia was split between Greece, Bulgaria, and Serbia (later [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], Yugoslavia). Serbia occupied the area that is currently North Macedonia incorporating it into the Kingdom as \"Southern Serbia\". During this time, Yugoslav Macedonia became known as [[Vardar Banovina]] (Vardar province) and the language of public life, education and the church was Serbo-Croatian. In the other two parts of Macedonia the respective national languages, Greek and Bulgarian, were made official. In Bulgarian (Pirin) Macedonia, the local dialects continued to be described as dialects of Bulgarian.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nDuring the [[second World War]], most of Yugoslav Macedonia was occupied by the Bulgarian army, who was allied with the Axis. The standard Bulgarian language was reintroduced in schools and [[liturgies]].

The Macedonian language was proclaimed the official language of the Republic of Macedonia at the First Session of the Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia, held on 2 August 1944. The first official Macedonian grammar was developed by Krume Kepeski. One of the most important contributors in the standardisation of the Macedonian literary language was [[Bla\u017ee Koneski]]. The first document written in the literary standard Macedonian language is the first issue of the ''[[Nova Makedonija]]'' newspaper in 1944. ''Makedonska Iskra'' (Macedonian Spark) was the first Macedonian newspaper published in Australia, from 1946 to 1957. Its articles were not in standard Macedonian but in local [[Slavic dialects of Greece]]. A monthly with national distribution, it commenced in Perth and later moved to Melbourne and Sydney. After the [[Tito-Stalin split]] in 1948, under the auspices of some Macedonian intellectuals in [[Bucharest]], anti-Yugoslav,  ''non-[[serbianisation|serbianised]]'' alphabet, grammar, and primer were created.<ref>Keith Brown, Macedonia's Child-grandfathers: The Transnational Politics of Memory, Exile, and Return, 1948-1998; Henry M.

{"title_page": "Mixture model", "text_new": "{{distinguish|mixed model}}\n{{See also|Mixture distribution}}\nIn [[statistics]], a '''mixture model''' is a [[probabilistic model]] for representing the presence of [[subpopulation]]s within an overall population, without requiring that an observed data set should identify the sub-population to which an individual observation belongs. Formally a mixture model corresponds to the [[mixture distribution]] that represents the [[probability distribution]] of observations in the overall population. However, while problems associated with \"mixture distributions\" relate to deriving the properties of the overall population from those of the sub-populations, \"mixture models\" are used to make [[statistical inference]]s about the properties of the sub-populations given only observations on the pooled population, without sub-population identity information.\n\nSome ways of implementing mixture models involve steps that attribute postulated sub-population-identities to individual observations (or weights towards such sub-populations), in which case these can be regarded as types of [[unsupervised learning]] or [[cluster analysis|clustering]] procedures. However, not all inference procedures involve such steps.\n\nMixture models should not be confused with models for [[compositional data]], i.e., data whose components are constrained to sum to a constant value (1, 100%, etc.). However, compositional models can be thought of as mixture models, where members of the population are sampled at random. Conversely, mixture models can be thought of as compositional models, where the [[measure (mathematics)|total size]] reading population has been normalized to 1.\n\n==Structure==\n\n===General mixture model===\nA typical finite-dimensional mixture model is a [[hierarchical Bayes model|hierarchical model]] consisting of the following components:\n\n*''N'' random variables that are observed, each distributed according to a mixture of ''K'' components, with the components belonging to the same [[parametric family]] of distributions (e.g., all [[normal distribution|normal]], all [[Zipf's law|Zipfian]], etc.) but with different parameters\n*''N'' random [[latent variable]]s specifying the identity of the mixture component of each observation, each distributed according to a ''K''-dimensional [[categorical distribution]]\n*A set of ''K'' mixture weights, which are probabilities that sum to 1.\n*A set of ''K'' parameters, each specifying the parameter of the corresponding mixture component.  In many cases, each \"parameter\" is actually a set of parameters.  For example, if the mixture components are [[Gaussian distribution]]s, there will be a [[mean]] and [[variance]] for each component. If the mixture components are [[categorical distribution]]s (e.g., when each observation is a token from a finite alphabet of size ''V''), there will be a vector of ''V'' probabilities summing to 1.\n\nIn addition, in a [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian setting]], the mixture weights and parameters will themselves be random variables, and [[prior distribution]]s will be placed over the variables.  In such a case, the weights are typically viewed as a ''K''-dimensional random vector drawn from a [[Dirichlet distribution]] (the [[conjugate prior]] of the categorical distribution), and the parameters will be distributed according to their respective conjugate priors.\n\nMathematically, a basic parametric mixture model can be described as follows:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{lcl}\nK &=& \\text{number of mixture components} \\\\\nN &=& \\text{number of observations} \\\\\n\\theta_{i=1 \\dots K} &=& \\text{parameter of distribution of observation associated with component } i \\\\\n\\phi_{i=1 \\dots K} &=& \\text{mixture weight, i.e., prior probability of a particular component } i \\\\\n\\boldsymbol\\phi &=& K\\text{-dimensional vector composed of all the individual } \\phi_{1 \\dots K} \\text{; must sum to 1} \\\\\nz_{i=1 \\dots N} &=& \\text{component of observation } i \\\\\nx_{i=1 \\dots N} &=& \\text{observation } i \\\\\nF(x|\\theta) &=& \\text{probability distribution of an observation, parametrized on } \\theta \\\\\nz_{i=1 \\dots N} &\\sim& \\operatorname{Categorical}(\\boldsymbol\\phi) \\\\\nx_{i=1 \\dots N}|z_{i=1 \\dots N} &\\sim& F(\\theta_{z_i})\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nIn a Bayesian setting, all parameters are associated with random variables, as follows:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{lcl}\nK,N &=& \\text{as above} \\\\\n\\theta_{i=1 \\dots K}, \\phi_{i=1 \\dots K}, \\boldsymbol\\phi &=& \\text{as above} \\\\\nz_{i=1 \\dots N}, x_{i=1 \\dots N}, F(x|\\theta) &=& \\text{as above} \\\\\n\\alpha &=& \\text{shared hyperparameter for component parameters} \\\\\n\\beta &=& \\text{shared hyperparameter for mixture weights} \\\\\nH(\\theta|\\alpha) &=& \\text{prior probability distribution of component parameters, parametrized on } \\alpha \\\\\n\\theta_{i=1 \\dots K} &\\sim& H(\\theta|\\alpha) \\\\\n\\boldsymbol\\phi &\\sim& \\operatorname{Symmetric-Dirichlet}_K(\\beta) \\\\\nz_{i=1 \\dots N}|\\boldsymbol\\phi &\\sim& \\operatorname{Categorical}(\\boldsymbol\\phi) \\\\\nx_{i=1 \\dots N}|z_{i=1 \\dots N},\\theta_{i=1 \\dots K} &\\sim& F(\\theta_{z_i})\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nThis characterization uses ''F'' and ''H'' to describe arbitrary distributions over observations and parameters, respectively.  Typically ''H'' will be the [[conjugate prior]] of ''F''.  The two most common choices of ''F'' are [[Gaussian distribution|Gaussian]] aka \"[[normal distribution|normal]]\" (for real-valued observations) and [[categorical distribution|categorical]] (for discrete observations).  Other common possibilities for the distribution of the mixture components are:\n*[[Binomial distribution]], for the number of \"positive occurrences\" (e.g., successes, yes votes, etc.) given a fixed number of total occurrences\n*[[Multinomial distribution]], similar to the binomial distribution, but for counts of multi-way occurrences (e.g., yes/no/maybe in a survey)\n*[[Negative binomial distribution]], for binomial-type observations but where the quantity of interest is the number of failures before a given number of successes occurs\n*[[Poisson distribution]], for the number of occurrences of an event in a given period of time, for an event that is characterized by a fixed rate of occurrence\n*[[Exponential distribution]], for the time before the next event occurs, for an event that is characterized by a fixed rate of occurrence\n*[[Log-normal distribution]], for positive real numbers that are assumed to grow exponentially, such as incomes or prices\n*[[Multivariate normal distribution]] (aka [[multivariate Gaussian distribution]]), for vectors of correlated outcomes that are individually Gaussian-distributed\n*[[Multivariate Student's-t distribution]] (aka [[multivariate t-distribution]]), for vectors of heavy-tailed correlated outcomes<ref>Sotirios P.

In a multivariate distribution (i.e. one modelling a vector <math>\\boldsymbol{x}</math> with ''N'' random variables) one may model a vector of parameters (such as several observations of a signal or patches within an image) using a Gaussian mixture model prior distribution on the vector of estimates given by\n:<math>\np(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\sum_{i=1}^K\\phi_i \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu_i,\\Sigma_i})\n</math>\nwhere the ''i<sup>th</sup>'' vector component is characterized by normal distributions with weights <math>\\phi_i</math>, means <math>\\boldsymbol{\\mu_i}</math> and covariance matrices <math>\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma_i}</math>.  To incorporate this prior into a Bayesian estimation, the prior is multiplied with the known distribution <math>p(\\boldsymbol{x | \\theta})</math> of the data <math>\\boldsymbol{x}</math> conditioned on the parameters <math>\\boldsymbol{\\theta}</math> to be estimated.  With this formulation, the [[Posterior probability|posterior distribution]] <math>p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta | x})</math> is ''also'' a Gaussian mixture model of the form \n:<math>\np(\\boldsymbol{\\theta | x}) = \\sum_{i=1}^K\\tilde{\\phi_i} \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\tilde{\\mu_i},\\tilde{\\Sigma_i}})\n</math>\nwith new parameters <math>\\tilde{\\phi_i}, \\boldsymbol{\\tilde{\\mu_i}}</math> and <math>\\boldsymbol{\\tilde{\\Sigma_i}}</math> that are updated using the [[Expectation-maximization algorithm|EM algorithm]].\n<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|last=Yu |first=Guoshen\n|title=Solving Inverse Problems with Piecewise Linear Estimators: From Gaussian Mixture Models to Structured Sparsity\n|journal=IEEE Transactions on Image Processing\n|volume=21 | date=2012|pages=2481\u20132499 |issue=5 |doi=10.1109/tip.2011.2176743\n|pmid=22180506\n|bibcode = 2012ITIP...21.2481G |arxiv=1006.3056}}\n</ref> Although EM-based parameter updates are well-established, providing the initial estimates for these parameters is currently an area of active research.  Note that this formulation yields a closed-form solution to the complete posterior distribution.  Estimations of the random variable <math>\\boldsymbol{\\theta}</math> may be obtained via one of several estimators, such as the mean or maximum of the posterior distribution.\n\nSuch distributions are useful for assuming patch-wise shapes of images and clusters, for example.  In the case of image representation, each Gaussian may be tilted, expanded, and warped according to the covariance matrices <math>\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma_i}</math>.  One Gaussian distribution of the set is fit to each patch (usually of size 8x8 pixels) in the image.  Notably, any distribution of points around a cluster (see [[K-means clustering|''k''-means]]) may be accurately given enough Gaussian components, but scarcely over ''K''=20 components are needed to accurately model a given image distribution or cluster of data.\n\n====Categorical mixture model====\n[[File:nonbayesian-categorical-mixture.svg|right|250px|thumb|Non-Bayesian categorical mixture model using [[plate notation]].

A mixture model<ref>Dinov, ID. \"[http://repositories.cdlib.org/socr/EM_MM/ Expectation Maximization and Mixture Modeling Tutorial]\". ''[http://repositories.cdlib.org/escholarship California Digital Library]'', Statistics Online Computational Resource, Paper EM_MM, http://repositories.cdlib.org/socr/EM_MM, December 9, 2008</ref> for return data seems reasonable. Sometimes the model used is a [[jump-diffusion model]], or as a mixture of two normal distributions. See [[Financial economics#Challenges and criticism]] for further context.\n\n===House prices===\nAssume that we observe the prices of ''N'' different houses.  Different types of houses in different neighborhoods will have vastly different prices, but the price of a particular type of house in a particular neighborhood (e.g., three-bedroom house in moderately upscale neighborhood) will tend to cluster fairly closely around the mean.  One possible model of such prices would be to assume that the prices are accurately described by a mixture model with ''K'' different components, each distributed as a [[normal distribution]] with unknown mean and variance, with each component specifying a particular combination of house type/neighborhood.  Fitting this model to observed prices, e.g., using the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]], would tend to cluster the prices according to house type/neighborhood and reveal the spread of prices in each type/neighborhood. (Note that for values such as prices or incomes that are guaranteed to be positive and which tend to grow [[exponential growth|exponentially]], a [[log-normal distribution]] might actually be a better model than a normal distribution.)\n\n===Topics in a document===\nAssume that a document is composed of ''N'' different words from a total vocabulary of size ''V'', where each word corresponds to one of ''K'' possible topics.  The distribution of such words could be modelled as a mixture of ''K'' different ''V''-dimensional [[categorical distribution]]s.  A model of this sort is commonly termed a [[topic model]].  Note that [[expectation maximization]] applied to such a model will typically fail to produce realistic results, due (among other things) to the [[overfitting|excessive number of parameters]].  Some sorts of additional assumptions are typically necessary to get good results.  Typically two sorts of additional components are added to the model:\n#A [[prior distribution]] is placed over the parameters describing the topic distributions, using a [[Dirichlet distribution]] with a [[concentration parameter]] that is set significantly below 1, so as to encourage sparse distributions (where only a small number of words have significantly non-zero probabilities).\n#Some sort of additional constraint is placed over the topic identities of words, to take advantage of natural clustering.\n:*For example, a [[Markov chain]] could be placed on the topic identities (i.e., the latent variables specifying the mixture component of each observation), corresponding to the fact that nearby words belong to similar topics. (This results in a [[hidden Markov model]], specifically one where a [[prior distribution]] is placed over state transitions that favors transitions that stay in the same state.)\n:*Another possibility is the [[latent Dirichlet allocation]] model, which divides up the words into ''D'' different documents and assumes that in each document only a small number of topics occur with any frequency.\n\n===Handwriting recognition===\nThe following example is based on an example in [[Christopher M. Bishop]], ''Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Bishop | first = Christopher | title = Pattern recognition and machine learning | publisher = Springer | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-387-31073-2 }}</ref>\n\nImagine that we are given an ''N''\u00d7''N'' black-and-white image that is known to be a scan of a hand-written digit between 0 and 9, but we don't know which digit is written.  We can create a mixture model with <math>K=10</math> different components, where each component is a vector of size <math>N^2</math> of [[Bernoulli distribution]]s (one per pixel).  Such a model can be trained with the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]] on an unlabeled set of hand-written digits, and will effectively cluster the images according to the digit being written.  The same model could then be used to recognize the digit of another image simply by holding the parameters constant, computing the probability of the new image for each possible digit (a trivial calculation), and returning the digit that generated the highest probability.\n\n===Assessing projectile accuracy (a.k.a. circular error probable, CEP)===\nMixture models apply in the problem of directing multiple projectiles at a target (as in air, land, or sea defense applications), where the physical and/or statistical characteristics of the projectiles differ within the multiple projectiles. An example might be shots from multiple munitions types or shots from multiple locations directed at one target. The combination of projectile types may be characterized as a Gaussian mixture model.<ref>Spall, J. C. and Maryak, J. L. (1992). \"A feasible Bayesian estimator of quantiles for projectile accuracy from non-i.i.d. data.\" ''Journal of the American Statistical Association'', vol. 87 (419), pp. 676\u2013681. {{JSTOR|2290205}}</ref> Further, a well-known measure of accuracy for a group of projectiles is the [[circular error probable]] (CEP), which is the number ''R'' such that, on average, half of the group of projectiles falls within the circle of radius ''R'' about the target point. The mixture model can be used to determine (or estimate) the value ''R''. The mixture model properly captures the different types of projectiles.\n\n===Direct and indirect applications===\nThe financial example above is one direct application of the mixture model, a situation in which we assume an underlying mechanism so that each observation belongs to one of some number of different sources or categories. This underlying mechanism may or may not, however, be observable. In this form of mixture, each of the sources is described by a component probability density function, and its mixture weight is the probability that an observation comes from this component.\n\nIn an indirect application of the mixture model we do not assume such a mechanism. The mixture model is simply used for its mathematical flexibilities. For example, a mixture of two [[normal distribution]]s with different means may result in a density with two [[Mode (statistics)|modes]], which is not modeled by standard parametric distributions. Another example is given by the possibility of mixture distributions to model fatter tails than the basic Gaussian ones, so as to be a candidate for modeling more extreme events. When combined with [[dynamical consistency]], this approach has been applied to [[financial derivatives]] valuation in presence of the [[volatility smile]] in the context of [[local volatility]] models. This defines our application.\n\n===Predictive Maintenance===\nThe mixture model-based clustering is also predominantly used in identifying the state of the machine in [[predictive maintenance]]. Density plots are used to analyze the density of high dimensional features. If multi-model densities are observed, then it is assumed that a finite set of densities are formed by a finite set of normal mixtures. A multivariate Gaussian mixture model is used to cluster the feature data into k number of groups where k represents each state of the machine. The machine state can be a normal state, power off state, or faulty state.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322900854|title=Fault Class Prediction in Unsupervised Learning using Model-Based Clustering Approach|last=Amruthnath|first=Nagdev|last2=Gupta|first2=Tarun|date=2018-02-02|doi=10.13140/rg.2.2.22085.14563|publisher=Unpublished}}</ref> Each formed cluster can be diagnosed using techniques such as spectral analysis.

In fuzzy or soft segmentation, any pattern can have certain \"ownership\" over any single pixel. If the patterns are Gaussian, fuzzy segmentation naturally results in Gaussian mixtures. Combined with other analytic or geometric tools (e.g., phase transitions over diffusive boundaries), such spatially regularized mixture models could lead to more realistic and computationally efficient segmentation methods.<ref>\n{{cite journal \n| last = Shen | first = Jianhong (Jackie) \n| title = A stochastic-variational model for soft Mumford-Shah segmentation\n| date = 2006 \n| volume=2006\n| pages=2\u201316\n| journal=International Journal of Biomedical Imaging\n| doi=10.1155/IJBI/2006/92329\n| pmid = 23165059 \n| pmc = 2324060 \n| bibcode = 2006IJBI.200649515H \n}}</ref>\n\n===Point set registration===\nProbabilistic mixture models such as [[Gaussian mixture model]]s (GMM) are used to resolve [[point set registration]] problems in image processing and computer vision fields.

Estimation procedures may not be well-defined and asymptotic theory may not hold if a model is not identifiable.\n\n=== Example ===\nLet ''J'' be the class of all binomial distributions with {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2}}. Then a mixture of two members of ''J'' would have\n\n:<math>p_0=\\pi(1-\\theta_1)^2+(1-\\pi)(1-\\theta_2)^2</math>\n:<math>p_1=2\\pi\\theta_1(1-\\theta_1)+2(1-\\pi)\\theta_2(1-\\theta_2)</math>\n\nand {{nowrap|''p''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} 1 \u2212 ''p''<sub>0</sub> \u2212 ''p''<sub>1</sub>}}. Clearly, given ''p''<sub>0</sub> and ''p''<sub>1</sub>, it is not possible to determine the above mixture model uniquely, as there are three parameters (''\u03c0'', ''\u03b8''<sub>1</sub>, ''\u03b8''<sub>2</sub>) to be determined.\n\n=== Definition ===\nConsider a mixture of parametric distributions of the same class. Let\n\n:<math>J=\\{f(\\cdot ; \\theta):\\theta\\in\\Omega\\}</math>\n\nbe the class of all component distributions. Then the [[convex hull]] ''K'' of ''J'' defines the class of all finite mixture of distributions in ''J'':\n\n:<math>K=\\left\\{p(\\cdot):p(\\cdot)=\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i f_i(\\cdot ; \\theta_i), a_i>0, \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i=1, f_i(\\cdot ; \\theta_i)\\in J\\ \\forall i,n\\right\\}</math>\n\n''K'' is said to be identifiable if all its members are unique, that is, given two members ''p'' and {{nowrap|''p\u2032''}} in ''K'', being mixtures of ''k'' distributions and {{nowrap|''k\u2032''}} distributions respectively in ''J'', we have {{nowrap|''p {{=}} p\u2032''}} if and only if, first of all, {{nowrap|''k {{=}} k\u2032''}} and secondly we can reorder the summations such that {{nowrap|''a<sub>i</sub> {{=}} a<sub>i</sub>''\u2032}} and {{nowrap|''\u0192<sub>i</sub> {{=}} \u0192<sub>i</sub>''\u2032}} for all ''i''.\n\n== Parameter estimation and system identification ==\n\nParametric mixture models are often used when we know the distribution ''Y'' and we can sample from ''X'', but we would like to determine the ''a<sub>i</sub>'' and ''\u03b8<sub>i</sub>'' values.  Such situations can arise in studies in which we sample from a population that is composed of several distinct subpopulations.\n\nIt is common to think of probability mixture modeling as a missing data problem.  One way to understand this is to assume that the data points under consideration have \"membership\" in one of the distributions we are using to model the data.  When we start, this membership is unknown, or missing.  The job of estimation is to devise appropriate parameters for the model functions we choose, with the connection to the data points being represented as their membership in the individual model distributions.\n\nA variety of approaches to the problem of mixture decomposition have been proposed, many of which focus on maximum likelihood methods such as [[expectation maximization]] (EM) or maximum ''a posteriori'' estimation (MAP).  Generally these methods consider separately the questions of system identification and parameter estimation; methods to determine the number and functional form of components within a mixture are distinguished from methods to estimate the corresponding parameter values.  Some notable departures are the graphical methods as outlined in Tarter and Lock<ref name=tart>{{citation \n|title=Model Free Curve Estimation\n|first=Michael E. |last=Tarter\n|date=1993\n|publisher=Chapman and Hall\n}}</ref> and more recently [[minimum message length]] (MML) techniques such as Figueiredo and Jain<ref name=Jain>{{cite journal |first1=M.A.T. |last1=Figueiredo |first2=A.K. |last2=Jain |title=Unsupervised Learning of Finite Mixture Models |journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=381\u2013396 |date=March 2002 |doi=10.1109/34.990138 |citeseerx=10.1.1.362.9811 }}</ref> and to some extent the moment matching pattern analysis routines suggested by McWilliam and Loh (2009).<ref name=mcwilli>\n{{citation \n|title=Incorporating Multidimensional Tail-Dependencies in the Valuation of Credit Derivatives (Working Paper)\n| first1 = N. | last1 = McWilliam | first2 = K. | last2 = Loh\n|date = 2008\n}} [http://www.misys.com/cds-portlets/digitalAssets/4/2797_CDsAndTailDep_forPublication_final1.pdf]</ref>\n\n=== Expectation maximization (EM) === <!-- Linked from [[Expectation-maximization algorithm]] -->\n\n[[Expectation-maximization algorithm|Expectation maximization]] (EM) is seemingly the most popular technique used to determine the parameters of a mixture with an ''a priori'' given number of components. This is a particular way of implementing [[maximum likelihood]] estimation for this problem. EM is of particular appeal for finite normal mixtures where closed-form expressions are possible such as in the following iterative algorithm by Dempster ''et al.''

The parameters are then updated such that the new component weights correspond to the average conditional probability and each component mean and covariance is the component specific weighted average of the mean and covariance of the entire sample.\n\nDempster<ref name=\"dempster1977\"/> also showed that each successive EM iteration will not decrease the likelihood, a property not shared by other gradient based maximization techniques.  Moreover, EM naturally embeds within it constraints on the probability vector, and for sufficiently large sample sizes positive definiteness of the covariance iterates.  This is a key advantage since explicitly constrained methods incur extra computational costs to check and maintain appropriate values. Theoretically EM is a first-order algorithm and as such converges slowly to a fixed-point solution. Redner and Walker (1984){{full citation needed|date=November 2012}} make this point arguing in favour of superlinear and second order Newton and quasi-Newton methods and reporting slow convergence in EM on the basis of their empirical tests.  They do concede that convergence in likelihood was rapid even if convergence in the parameter values themselves was not.  The relative merits of EM and other algorithms vis-\u00e0-vis convergence have been discussed in other literature.<ref name=XuJordam>{{cite journal |first1=L. |last1=Xu |first2=M.I. |last2=Jordan |title=On Convergence Properties of the EM Algorithm for Gaussian Mixtures |journal=Neural Computation |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=129\u2013151 |date=January 1996 |doi=10.1162/neco.1996.8.1.129 |hdl=10338.dmlcz/135225 }}</ref>\n\nOther common objections to the use of EM are that it has a propensity to spuriously identify local maxima, as well as displaying sensitivity to initial values.<ref name=\"McLachlan_2\"/><ref name=\"botev2004global\">{{Cite book |author1=Botev, Z.I. |author2=Kroese, D.P. |authorlink2=Dirk Kroese|title=Global likelihood optimization via the cross-entropy method with an application to mixture models\n|journal=[[Proceedings of the 2004 Winter Simulation Conference]] |volume= 1 |pages=517 |year=2004 |doi=10.1109/WSC.2004.1371358|isbn=978-0-7803-8786-7 |citeseerx=10.1.1.331.2319 }}</ref> One may address these problems by evaluating EM at several initial points in the parameter space but this is computationally costly and other approaches, such as the annealing EM method of Udea and Nakano (1998) (in which the initial components are essentially forced to overlap, providing a less heterogeneous basis for initial guesses), may be preferable.\n\nFigueiredo and Jain<ref name=\"Jain\" /> note that convergence to 'meaningless' parameter values obtained at the boundary (where regularity conditions breakdown, e.g., Ghosh and Sen (1985)) is frequently observed when the number of model components exceeds the optimal/true one.  On this basis they suggest a unified approach to estimation and identification in which the initial ''n'' is chosen to greatly exceed the expected optimal value.  Their optimization routine is constructed via a minimum message length (MML) criterion that effectively eliminates a candidate component if there is insufficient information to support it. In this way it is possible to systematize reductions in ''n'' and consider estimation and identification jointly.\n\nThe [[Expectation-maximization algorithm]] can be used to compute the parameters of a parametric mixture model distribution (the ''a<sub>i</sub>'' and ''\u03b8<sub>i</sub>'').  It is an [[iterative algorithm]] with two steps: an ''expectation step'' and a ''maximization step''. [http://wiki.stat.ucla.edu/socr/index.php/SOCR_EduMaterials_Activities_2D_PointSegmentation_EM_Mixture Practical examples of EM and Mixture Modeling] are included in the [[SOCR]] demonstrations.\n\n==== The expectation step ====\nWith initial guesses for the parameters of our mixture model, \"partial membership\" of each data point in each constituent distribution is computed by calculating [[expectation value]]s for the membership variables of each data point.  That is, for each data point ''x<sub>j</sub>'' and distribution ''Y<sub>i</sub>'', the membership value ''y''<sub>''i'', ''j''</sub> is:\n\n:<math> y_{i,j} = \\frac{a_i f_Y(x_j;\\theta_i)}{f_{X}(x_j)}.</math>\n\n==== The maximization step ====\nWith expectation values in hand for group membership, [[plug-in estimates]] are recomputed for the distribution parameters.\n\nThe mixing coefficients ''a<sub>i</sub>'' are the [[arithmetic mean|mean]]s of the membership values over the ''N'' data points.\n\n:<math> a_i = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^N y_{i,j}</math>\n\nThe component model parameters ''\u03b8<sub>i</sub>'' are also calculated by expectation maximization using data points ''x<sub>j</sub>'' that have been weighted using the membership values.  For example, if ''\u03b8'' is a mean ''\u03bc''\n\n:<math> \\mu_{i} = \\frac{\\sum_{j} y_{i,j}x_{j}}{\\sum_{j} y_{i,j}}.</math>\n\nWith new estimates for ''a<sub>i</sub>'' and the ''\u03b8<sub>i</sub>'''s, the expectation step is repeated to recompute new membership values.  The entire procedure is repeated until model parameters converge.\n\n=== Markov chain Monte Carlo ===\nAs an alternative to the EM algorithm, the mixture model parameters can be deduced using [[posterior sampling]] as indicated by [[Bayes' theorem]].  This is still regarded as an incomplete data problem whereby membership of data points is the missing data.  A two-step iterative procedure known as [[Gibbs sampling]] can be used.\n\nThe previous example of a mixture of two [[Gaussian distribution]]s can demonstrate how the method works.  As before, initial guesses of the parameters for the mixture model are made.  Instead of computing partial memberships for each elemental distribution, a membership value for each data point is drawn from a [[Bernoulli distribution]] (that is, it will be assigned to either the first or the second Gaussian).  The Bernoulli parameter ''\u03b8'' is determined for each data point on the basis of one of the constituent distributions.{{Vague|What does this mean?|date=March 2008}}  Draws from the distribution generate membership associations for each data point.  Plug-in estimators can then be used as in the M step of EM to generate a new set of mixture model parameters, and the binomial draw step repeated.\n\n=== Moment matching ===\nThe [[Method of moments (statistics)|method of moment matching]] is one of the oldest techniques for determining the mixture parameters dating back to Karl Pearson's seminal work of 1894.\nIn this approach the parameters of the mixture are determined such that the composite distribution has moments matching some given value.  In many instances extraction of solutions to the moment equations may present non-trivial algebraic or computational problems.  Moreover, numerical analysis by Day<ref name=day>{{Cite journal | last1 = Day | first1 = N. E. | title = Estimating the Components of a Mixture of Normal Distributions | journal = Biometrika | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 463\u2013474 | doi = 10.2307/2334652 | jstor = 2334652| year = 1969 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> has indicated that such methods may be inefficient compared to EM. Nonetheless there has been renewed interest in this method, e.g., Craigmile and Titterington (1998) and Wang.<ref name=wang>{{citation \n|title=Generating daily changes in market variables using a multivariate mixture of normal distributions\n|first = J. | last = Wang\n|date = 2001\n|journal = Proceedings of the 33rd Winter Conference on Simulation |pages   =283\u2013289\n}}</ref>\n\nMcWilliam and Loh (2009) consider the characterisation of a hyper-cuboid normal mixture [[copula (statistics)|copula]] in large dimensional systems for which EM would be computationally prohibitive.  Here a pattern analysis routine is used to generate multivariate tail-dependencies consistent with a set of univariate and (in some sense) bivariate moments.  The performance of this method is then evaluated using equity log-return data with [[Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov]] test statistics suggesting a good descriptive fit.\n\n===Spectral method===\nSome problems in mixture model estimation can be solved using [[spectral method]]s.\nIn particular it becomes useful if data points ''x<sub>i</sub>'' are points in high-dimensional [[real coordinate space|real space]], and the hidden distributions are known to be [[Logarithmically concave function|log-concave]] (such as [[Gaussian distribution]] or [[Exponential distribution]]).\n\nSpectral methods of learning mixture models are based on the use of [[Singular Value Decomposition]] of a matrix which contains data points.\nThe idea is to consider the top ''k'' singular vectors, where ''k'' is the number of distributions to be learned. The projection\nof each data point to a [[linear subspace]] spanned by those vectors groups points originating from the same distribution\nvery close together, while points from different distributions stay far apart.\n\nOne distinctive feature of the spectral method is that it allows us to [[Mathematical proof|prove]] that if\ndistributions satisfy certain separation condition (e.g., not too close), then the estimated mixture will be very close to the true one with high probability.\n\n=== Graphical Methods ===\n\nTarter and Lock<ref name=\"tart\" /> describe a graphical approach to mixture identification in which a kernel function is applied to an empirical frequency plot so to reduce intra-component variance.  In this way one may more readily identify components having differing means.  While this ''\u03bb''-method does not require prior knowledge of the number or functional form of the components its success does rely on the choice of the kernel parameters which to some extent implicitly embeds assumptions about the component structure.\n\n=== Other methods ===\n\nSome of them can even probably learn mixtures of [[heavy-tailed distribution]]s including those with\ninfinite [[variance]] (see [[#Recent Papers|links to papers]] below).\nIn this setting, EM based methods would not work, since the Expectation step would diverge due to presence of\n[[outlier]]s.\n\n=== A simulation ===\nTo simulate a sample of size ''N'' that is from a mixture of distributions ''F''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''i''=1 to ''n'', with probabilities ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> (sum=&nbsp;''p''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1):\n# Generate ''N'' random numbers from a [[categorical distribution]] of size ''n'' and probabilities ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> for ''i''=&nbsp;1=&nbsp;to&nbsp;''n''.  These tell you which of the ''F''<sub>''i''</sub> each of the ''N'' values will come from.  Denote by ''m<sub>i</sub>'' the quantity of random numbers assigned to the ''i''<sup>th</sup> category.\n# For each ''i'', generate ''m<sub>i</sub>'' random numbers from the ''F''<sub>''i''</sub> distribution.\n\n== Extensions ==\nIn a [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian setting]], additional levels can be added to the [[graphical model]] defining the mixture model.  For example, in the common [[latent Dirichlet allocation]] [[topic model]], the observations are sets of words drawn from ''D'' different documents and the ''K'' mixture components represent topics that are shared across documents.  Each document has a different set of mixture weights, which specify the topics prevalent in that document.  All sets of mixture weights share common [[hyperparameter]]s.\n\nA very common extension is to connect the [[latent variable]]s defining the mixture component identities into a [[Markov chain]], instead of assuming that they are [[independent identically distributed]] random variables.  The resulting model is termed a [[hidden Markov model]] and is one of the most common sequential hierarchical models.  Numerous extensions of hidden Markov models have been developed; see the resulting article for more information.\n\n== History ==\nMixture distributions and the problem of mixture decomposition, that is the identification of its constituent components and the parameters thereof, has been cited in the literature as far back as 1846 (Quetelet in McLachlan, <ref name=McLachlan_2>{{citation \n|title=Finite Mixture Models\n|first=G.J. |last=McLachlan\n|publisher=Wiley\n|date=2000\n}}</ref> 2000) although common reference is made to the work of [[Karl Pearson]] (1894)<ref name=Amendola2015>{{Cite journal |last=Am\u00e9ndola |first=Carlos |display-authors=etal |arxiv=1510.04654 |year=2015 |title=Moment varieties of Gaussian mixtures|doi=10.18409/jas.v7i1.42 |volume=7 |journal=Journal of Algebraic Statistics|bibcode=2015arXiv151004654A }}</ref> as the first author to explicitly address the decomposition problem in characterising non-normal attributes of forehead to body length ratios in female shore crab populations.  The motivation for this work was provided by the zoologist [[Walter Frank Raphael Weldon]] who had speculated in 1893 (in Tarter and Lock<ref name=\"tart\" />) that asymmetry in the histogram of these ratios could signal evolutionary divergence. Pearson's approach was to fit a univariate mixture of two normals to the data by choosing the five parameters of the mixture such that the empirical moments matched that of the model.\n\nWhile his work was successful in identifying two potentially distinct sub-populations and in demonstrating the flexibility of mixtures as a moment matching tool, the formulation required the solution of a 9th degree (nonic) polynomial which at the time posed a significant computational challenge.\n\nSubsequent works focused on addressing these problems, but it was not until the advent of the modern computer and the popularisation of [[Maximum Likelihood]] (MLE) parameterisation techniques that research really took off.<ref name=McLachlan_1>{{citation \n|title=Mixture Models: inference and applications to clustering\n|journal=Statistics: Textbooks and Monographs |first1=G.J. |last1=McLachlan |first2=K.E. |last2=Basford\n|date=1988\n|bibcode=1988mmia.book.....M }}</ref> Since that time there has been a vast body of research on the subject spanning areas such as [[Fishery|fisheries research]], [[agriculture]], [[botany]], [[economics]], [[medicine]], [[genetics]], [[psychology]], [[palaeontology]], [[electrophoresis]], [[finance]], [[geology]] and [[zoology]].<ref name=titter_1>{{harvnb|Titterington|Smith|Makov|1985}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n=== Mixture ===\n* [[Mixture density]]\n* [[Mixture (probability)]]\n* [[Flexible Mixture Model (FMM)]]\n\n=== Hierarchical models ===\n* [[Graphical model]]\n* [[Hierarchical Bayes model]]\n\n=== Outlier detection ===\n* [[RANSAC]]\n\n{{More footnotes|date=November 2010}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n=== Books on mixture models ===\n*{{cite book |last1=Everitt |first1=B.S. |last2=Hand |first2=D.J. |title=Finite mixture distributions |publisher=Chapman & Hall |date=1981 |isbn=978-0-412-22420-1 }}\n*{{cite book | last = Lindsay | first = B.

Formally a mixture model corresponds to the [[mixture distribution]] that represents the [[probability distribution]] of observations in the overall population. However, while problems associated with \"mixture distributions\" relate to deriving the properties of the overall population from those of the sub-populations, \"mixture models\" are used to make [[statistical inference]]s about the properties of the sub-populations given only observations on the pooled population, without sub-population identity information.\n\nSome ways of implementing mixture models involve steps that attribute postulated sub-population-identities to individual observations (or weights towards such sub-populations), in which case these can be regarded as types of [[unsupervised learning]] or [[cluster analysis|clustering]] procedures. However, not all inference procedures involve such steps.\n\nMixture models should not be confused with models for [[compositional data]], i.e., data whose components are constrained to sum to a constant value (1, 100%, etc.). However, compositional models can be thought of as mixture models, where members of the population are sampled at random. Conversely, mixture models can be thought of as compositional models, where the [[measure (mathematics)|total size]] reading population has been normalized to 1.\n\n==Structure==\n\n===General mixture model===\nA typical finite-dimensional mixture model is a [[hierarchical Bayes model|hierarchical model]] consisting of the following components:\n\n*''N'' random variables that are observed, each distributed according to a mixture of ''K'' components, with the components belonging to the same [[parametric family]] of distributions (e.g., all [[normal distribution|normal]], all [[Zipf's law|Zipfian]], etc.) but with different parameters\n*''N'' random [[latent variable]]s specifying the identity of the mixture component of each observation, each distributed according to a ''K''-dimensional [[categorical distribution]]\n*A set of ''K'' mixture weights, which are probabilities that sum to 1.\n*A set of ''K'' parameters, each specifying the parameter of the corresponding mixture component.  In many cases, each \"parameter\" is actually a set of parameters.  For example, if the mixture components are [[Gaussian distribution]]s, there will be a [[mean]] and [[variance]] for each component. If the mixture components are [[categorical distribution]]s (e.g., when each observation is a token from a finite alphabet of size ''V''), there will be a vector of ''V'' probabilities summing to 1.\n\nIn addition, in a [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian setting]], the mixture weights and parameters will themselves be random variables, and [[prior distribution]]s will be placed over the variables.  In such a case, the weights are typically viewed as a ''K''-dimensional random vector drawn from a [[Dirichlet distribution]] (the [[conjugate prior]] of the categorical distribution), and the parameters will be distributed according to their respective conjugate priors.\n\nMathematically, a basic parametric mixture model can be described as follows:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{lcl}\nK &=& \\text{number of mixture components} \\\\\nN &=& \\text{number of observations} \\\\\n\\theta_{i=1 \\dots K} &=& \\text{parameter of distribution of observation associated with component } i \\\\\n\\phi_{i=1 \\dots K} &=& \\text{mixture weight, i.e., prior probability of a particular component } i \\\\\n\\boldsymbol\\phi &=& K\\text{-dimensional vector composed of all the individual } \\phi_{1 \\dots K} \\text{; must sum to 1} \\\\\nz_{i=1 \\dots N} &=& \\text{component of observation } i \\\\\nx_{i=1 \\dots N} &=& \\text{observation } i \\\\\nF(x|\\theta) &=& \\text{probability distribution of an observation, parametrized on } \\theta \\\\\nz_{i=1 \\dots N} &\\sim& \\operatorname{Categorical}(\\boldsymbol\\phi) \\\\\nx_{i=1 \\dots N}|z_{i=1 \\dots N} &\\sim& F(\\theta_{z_i})\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nIn a Bayesian setting, all parameters are associated with random variables, as follows:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{lcl}\nK,N &=& \\text{as above} \\\\\n\\theta_{i=1 \\dots K}, \\phi_{i=1 \\dots K}, \\boldsymbol\\phi &=& \\text{as above} \\\\\nz_{i=1 \\dots N}, x_{i=1 \\dots N}, F(x|\\theta) &=& \\text{as above} \\\\\n\\alpha &=& \\text{shared hyperparameter for component parameters} \\\\\n\\beta &=& \\text{shared hyperparameter for mixture weights} \\\\\nH(\\theta|\\alpha) &=& \\text{prior probability distribution of component parameters, parametrized on } \\alpha \\\\\n\\theta_{i=1 \\dots K} &\\sim& H(\\theta|\\alpha) \\\\\n\\boldsymbol\\phi &\\sim& \\operatorname{Symmetric-Dirichlet}_K(\\beta) \\\\\nz_{i=1 \\dots N}|\\boldsymbol\\phi &\\sim& \\operatorname{Categorical}(\\boldsymbol\\phi) \\\\\nx_{i=1 \\dots N}|z_{i=1 \\dots N},\\theta_{i=1 \\dots K} &\\sim& F(\\theta_{z_i})\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nThis characterization uses ''F'' and ''H'' to describe arbitrary distributions over observations and parameters, respectively.  Typically ''H'' will be the [[conjugate prior]] of ''F''.  The two most common choices of ''F'' are [[Gaussian distribution|Gaussian]] aka \"[[normal distribution|normal]]\" (for real-valued observations) and [[categorical distribution|categorical]] (for discrete observations).  Other common possibilities for the distribution of the mixture components are:\n*[[Binomial distribution]], for the number of \"positive occurrences\" (e.g., successes, yes votes, etc.) given a fixed number of total occurrences\n*[[Multinomial distribution]], similar to the binomial distribution, but for counts of multi-way occurrences (e.g., yes/no/maybe in a survey)\n*[[Negative binomial distribution]], for binomial-type observations but where the quantity of interest is the number of failures before a given number of successes occurs\n*[[Poisson distribution]], for the number of occurrences of an event in a given period of time, for an event that is characterized by a fixed rate of occurrence\n*[[Exponential distribution]], for the time before the next event occurs, for an event that is characterized by a fixed rate of occurrence\n*[[Log-normal distribution]], for positive real numbers that are assumed to grow exponentially, such as incomes or prices\n*[[Multivariate normal distribution]] (aka [[multivariate Gaussian distribution]]), for vectors of correlated outcomes that are individually Gaussian-distributed\n*[[Multivariate Student's-t distribution]] (aka [[multivariate t-distribution]]), for vectors of heavy-tailed correlated outcomes<ref>Sotirios P.

In a multivariate distribution (i.e. one modelling a vector <math>\\boldsymbol{x}</math> with ''N'' random variables) one may model a vector of parameters (such as several observations of a signal or patches within an image) using a Gaussian mixture model prior distribution on the vector of estimates given by\n:<math>\np(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\sum_{i=1}^K\\phi_i \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu_i,\\Sigma_i})\n</math>\nwhere the ''i<sup>th</sup>'' vector component is characterized by normal distributions with weights <math>\\phi_i</math>, means <math>\\boldsymbol{\\mu_i}</math> and covariance matrices <math>\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma_i}</math>.  To incorporate this prior into a Bayesian estimation, the prior is multiplied with the known distribution <math>p(\\boldsymbol{x | \\theta})</math> of the data <math>\\boldsymbol{x}</math> conditioned on the parameters <math>\\boldsymbol{\\theta}</math> to be estimated.  With this formulation, the [[Posterior probability|posterior distribution]] <math>p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta | x})</math> is ''also'' a Gaussian mixture model of the form \n:<math>\np(\\boldsymbol{\\theta | x}) = \\sum_{i=1}^K\\tilde{\\phi_i} \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\tilde{\\mu_i},\\tilde{\\Sigma_i}})\n</math>\nwith new parameters <math>\\tilde{\\phi_i}, \\boldsymbol{\\tilde{\\mu_i}}</math> and <math>\\boldsymbol{\\tilde{\\Sigma_i}}</math> that are updated using the [[Expectation-maximization algorithm|EM algorithm]].\n<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|last=Yu |first=Guoshen\n|title=Solving Inverse Problems with Piecewise Linear Estimators: From Gaussian Mixture Models to Structured Sparsity\n|journal=IEEE Transactions on Image Processing\n|volume=21 | date=2012|pages=2481\u20132499 |issue=5 |doi=10.1109/tip.2011.2176743\n|pmid=22180506\n|bibcode = 2012ITIP...21.2481G |arxiv=1006.3056}}\n</ref> Although EM-based parameter updates are well-established, providing the initial estimates for these parameters is currently an area of active research.  Note that this formulation yields a closed-form solution to the complete posterior distribution.  Estimations of the random variable <math>\\boldsymbol{\\theta}</math> may be obtained via one of several estimators, such as the mean or maximum of the posterior distribution.\n\nSuch distributions are useful for assuming patch-wise shapes of images and clusters, for example.  In the case of image representation, each Gaussian may be tilted, expanded, and warped according to the covariance matrices <math>\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma_i}</math>.  One Gaussian distribution of the set is fit to each patch (usually of size 8x8 pixels) in the image.  Notably, any distribution of points around a cluster (see [[K-means clustering|''k''-means]]) may be accurately given enough Gaussian components, but scarcely over ''K''=20 components are needed to accurately model a given image distribution or cluster of data.\n\n====Categorical mixture model====\n[[File:nonbayesian-categorical-mixture.svg|right|250px|thumb|Non-Bayesian categorical mixture model using [[plate notation]].

A mixture model<ref>Dinov, ID. \"[http://repositories.cdlib.org/socr/EM_MM/ Expectation Maximization and Mixture Modeling Tutorial]\". ''[http://repositories.cdlib.org/escholarship California Digital Library]'', Statistics Online Computational Resource, Paper EM_MM, http://repositories.cdlib.org/socr/EM_MM, December 9, 2008</ref> for return data seems reasonable. Sometimes the model used is a [[jump-diffusion model]], or as a mixture of two normal distributions. See [[Financial economics#Challenges and criticism]] for further context.\n\n===House prices===\nAssume that we observe the prices of ''N'' different houses.  Different types of houses in different neighborhoods will have vastly different prices, but the price of a particular type of house in a particular neighborhood (e.g., three-bedroom house in moderately upscale neighborhood) will tend to cluster fairly closely around the mean.  One possible model of such prices would be to assume that the prices are accurately described by a mixture model with ''K'' different components, each distributed as a [[normal distribution]] with unknown mean and variance, with each component specifying a particular combination of house type/neighborhood.  Fitting this model to observed prices, e.g., using the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]], would tend to cluster the prices according to house type/neighborhood and reveal the spread of prices in each type/neighborhood. (Note that for values such as prices or incomes that are guaranteed to be positive and which tend to grow [[exponential growth|exponentially]], a [[log-normal distribution]] might actually be a better model than a normal distribution.)\n\n===Topics in a document===\nAssume that a document is composed of ''N'' different words from a total vocabulary of size ''V'', where each word corresponds to one of ''K'' possible topics.  The distribution of such words could be modelled as a mixture of ''K'' different ''V''-dimensional [[categorical distribution]]s.  A model of this sort is commonly termed a [[topic model]].  Note that [[expectation maximization]] applied to such a model will typically fail to produce realistic results, due (among other things) to the [[overfitting|excessive number of parameters]].  Some sorts of additional assumptions are typically necessary to get good results.  Typically two sorts of additional components are added to the model:\n#A [[prior distribution]] is placed over the parameters describing the topic distributions, using a [[Dirichlet distribution]] with a [[concentration parameter]] that is set significantly below 1, so as to encourage sparse distributions (where only a small number of words have significantly non-zero probabilities).\n#Some sort of additional constraint is placed over the topic identities of words, to take advantage of natural clustering.\n:*For example, a [[Markov chain]] could be placed on the topic identities (i.e., the latent variables specifying the mixture component of each observation), corresponding to the fact that nearby words belong to similar topics. (This results in a [[hidden Markov model]], specifically one where a [[prior distribution]] is placed over state transitions that favors transitions that stay in the same state.)\n:*Another possibility is the [[latent Dirichlet allocation]] model, which divides up the words into ''D'' different documents and assumes that in each document only a small number of topics occur with any frequency.\n\n===Handwriting recognition===\nThe following example is based on an example in [[Christopher M. Bishop]], ''Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Bishop | first = Christopher | title = Pattern recognition and machine learning | publisher = Springer | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-387-31073-2 }}</ref>\n\nImagine that we are given an ''N''\u00d7''N'' black-and-white image that is known to be a scan of a hand-written digit between 0 and 9, but we don't know which digit is written.  We can create a mixture model with <math>K=10</math> different components, where each component is a vector of size <math>N^2</math> of [[Bernoulli distribution]]s (one per pixel).  Such a model can be trained with the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]] on an unlabeled set of hand-written digits, and will effectively cluster the images according to the digit being written.  The same model could then be used to recognize the digit of another image simply by holding the parameters constant, computing the probability of the new image for each possible digit (a trivial calculation), and returning the digit that generated the highest probability.\n\n===Assessing projectile accuracy (a.k.a. circular error probable, CEP)===\nMixture models apply in the problem of directing multiple projectiles at a target (as in air, land, or sea defense applications), where the physical and/or statistical characteristics of the projectiles differ within the multiple projectiles. An example might be shots from multiple munitions types or shots from multiple locations directed at one target. The combination of projectile types may be characterized as a Gaussian mixture model.<ref>Spall, J. C. and Maryak, J. L. (1992). \"A feasible Bayesian estimator of quantiles for projectile accuracy from non-i.i.d. data.\" ''Journal of the American Statistical Association'', vol. 87 (419), pp. 676\u2013681. {{JSTOR|2290205}}</ref> Further, a well-known measure of accuracy for a group of projectiles is the [[circular error probable]] (CEP), which is the number ''R'' such that, on average, half of the group of projectiles falls within the circle of radius ''R'' about the target point. The mixture model can be used to determine (or estimate) the value ''R''. The mixture model properly captures the different types of projectiles.\n\n===Direct and indirect applications===\nThe financial example above is one direct application of the mixture model, a situation in which we assume an underlying mechanism so that each observation belongs to one of some number of different sources or categories. This underlying mechanism may or may not, however, be observable. In this form of mixture, each of the sources is described by a component probability density function, and its mixture weight is the probability that an observation comes from this component.\n\nIn an indirect application of the mixture model we do not assume such a mechanism. The mixture model is simply used for its mathematical flexibilities. For example, a mixture of two [[normal distribution]]s with different means may result in a density with two [[Mode (statistics)|modes]], which is not modeled by standard parametric distributions. Another example is given by the possibility of mixture distributions to model fatter tails than the basic Gaussian ones, so as to be a candidate for modeling more extreme events. When combined with [[dynamical consistency]], this approach has been applied to [[financial derivatives]] valuation in presence of the [[volatility smile]] in the context of [[local volatility]] models. This defines our application.\n\n===Predictive Maintenance===\nThe mixture model-based clustering is also predominantly used in identifying the state of the machine in [[predictive maintenance]]. Density plots are used to analyze the density of high dimensional features. If multi-model densities are observed, then it is assumed that a finite set of densities are formed by a finite set of normal mixtures. A multivariate Gaussian mixture model is used to cluster the feature data into k number of groups where k represents each state of the machine. The machine state can be a normal state, power off state, or faulty state.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322900854|title=Fault Class Prediction in Unsupervised Learning using Model-Based Clustering Approach|last=Amruthnath|first=Nagdev|last2=Gupta|first2=Tarun|date=2018-02-02|doi=10.13140/rg.2.2.22085.14563|publisher=Unpublished}}</ref> Each formed cluster can be diagnosed using techniques such as spectral analysis.

In fuzzy or soft segmentation, any pattern can have certain \"ownership\" over any single pixel. If the patterns are Gaussian, fuzzy segmentation naturally results in Gaussian mixtures. Combined with other analytic or geometric tools (e.g., phase transitions over diffusive boundaries), such spatially regularized mixture models could lead to more realistic and computationally efficient segmentation methods.<ref>\n{{cite journal \n| last = Shen | first = Jianhong (Jackie) \n| title = A stochastic-variational model for soft Mumford-Shah segmentation\n| date = 2006 \n| volume=2006\n| pages=2\u201316\n| journal=International Journal of Biomedical Imaging\n| doi=10.1155/IJBI/2006/92329\n| pmid = 23165059 \n| pmc = 2324060 \n| bibcode = 2006IJBI.200649515H \n}}</ref>\n\n===Point set registration===\nProbabilistic mixture models such as [[Gaussian mixture model]]s (GMM) are used to resolve [[point set registration]] problems in image processing and computer vision fields.

Then the [[convex hull]] ''K'' of ''J'' defines the class of all finite mixture of distributions in ''J'':\n\n:<math>K=\\left\\{p(\\cdot):p(\\cdot)=\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i f_i(\\cdot ; \\theta_i), a_i>0, \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i=1, f_i(\\cdot ; \\theta_i)\\in J\\ \\forall i,n\\right\\}</math>\n\n''K'' is said to be identifiable if all its members are unique, that is, given two members ''p'' and {{nowrap|''p\u2032''}} in ''K'', being mixtures of ''k'' distributions and {{nowrap|''k\u2032''}} distributions respectively in ''J'', we have {{nowrap|''p {{=}} p\u2032''}} if and only if, first of all, {{nowrap|''k {{=}} k\u2032''}} and secondly we can reorder the summations such that {{nowrap|''a<sub>i</sub> {{=}} a<sub>i</sub>''\u2032}} and {{nowrap|''\u0192<sub>i</sub> {{=}} \u0192<sub>i</sub>''\u2032}} for all ''i''.\n\n== Parameter estimation and system identification ==\n\nParametric mixture models are often used when we know the distribution ''Y'' and we can sample from ''X'', but we would like to determine the ''a<sub>i</sub>'' and ''\u03b8<sub>i</sub>'' values.  Such situations can arise in studies in which we sample from a population that is composed of several distinct subpopulations.\n\nIt is common to think of probability mixture modeling as a missing data problem.  One way to understand this is to assume that the data points under consideration have \"membership\" in one of the distributions we are using to model the data.  When we start, this membership is unknown, or missing.  The job of estimation is to devise appropriate parameters for the model functions we choose, with the connection to the data points being represented as their membership in the individual model distributions.\n\nA variety of approaches to the problem of mixture decomposition have been proposed, many of which focus on maximum likelihood methods such as [[expectation maximization]] (EM) or maximum ''a posteriori'' estimation (MAP).  Generally these methods consider separately the questions of system identification and parameter estimation; methods to determine the number and functional form of components within a mixture are distinguished from methods to estimate the corresponding parameter values.  Some notable departures are the graphical methods as outlined in Tarter and Lock<ref name=tart>{{citation \n|title=Model Free Curve Estimation\n|first=Michael E. |last=Tarter\n|date=1993\n|publisher=Chapman and Hall\n}}</ref> and more recently [[minimum message length]] (MML) techniques such as Figueiredo and Jain<ref name=Jain>{{cite journal |first1=M.A.T. |last1=Figueiredo |first2=A.K. |last2=Jain |title=Unsupervised Learning of Finite Mixture Models |journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=381\u2013396 |date=March 2002 |doi=10.1109/34.990138 |citeseerx=10.1.1.362.9811 }}</ref> and to some extent the moment matching pattern analysis routines suggested by McWilliam and Loh (2009).<ref name=mcwilli>\n{{citation \n|title=Incorporating Multidimensional Tail-Dependencies in the Valuation of Credit Derivatives (Working Paper)\n| first1 = N. | last1 = McWilliam | first2 = K. | last2 = Loh\n|date = 2008\n}} [http://www.misys.com/cds-portlets/digitalAssets/4/2797_CDsAndTailDep_forPublication_final1.pdf]</ref>\n\n=== Expectation maximization (EM) === <!-- Linked from [[Expectation-maximization algorithm]] -->\n\n[[Expectation-maximization algorithm|Expectation maximization]] (EM) is seemingly the most popular technique used to determine the parameters of a mixture with an ''a priori'' given number of components. This is a particular way of implementing [[maximum likelihood]] estimation for this problem. EM is of particular appeal for finite normal mixtures where closed-form expressions are possible such as in the following iterative algorithm by Dempster ''et al.'' (1977)<ref name=dempster1977>{{cite journal |first1=A.P. |last1=Dempster |first2=N.M. |last2=Laird |first3=D.B. |last3=Rubin |title=Maximum Likelihood from Incomplete Data via the EM Algorithm |journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201338 | date = 1977 |jstor=2984875 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.163.7580 }}\n</ref>\n\n:<math> w_s^{(j+1)} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{t =1}^N h_s^{(j)}(t) </math>\n:<math> \\mu_s^{(j+1)}  =  \\frac{\\sum_{t =1}^N h_s^{(j)}(t) x^{(t)}}{\\sum_{t =1}^N h_s^{(j)}(t)} </math>\n:<math> \\Sigma_s^{(j+1)}  =  \\frac{\\sum_{t =1}^N h_s^{(j)}(t) [x^{(t)}-\\mu_s^{(j+1)}][x^{(t)}-\\mu_s^{(j+1)}]^{\\top}}{\\sum_{t =1}^N h_s^{(j)}(t)} </math>\nwith the posterior probabilities\n:<math> h_s^{(j)}(t) = \\frac{w_s^{(j)} p_s(x^{(t)}; \\mu_s^{(j)},\\Sigma_s^{(j)}) }{ \\sum_{i = 1}^n w_i^{(j)} p_i(x^{(t)}; \\mu_i^{(j)}, \\Sigma_i^{(j)})}. </math>\n\nThus on the basis of the current estimate for the parameters, the [[conditional probability]] for a given observation ''x''<sup>(''t'')</sup> being generated from state ''s'' is determined for each {{nowrap|''t'' {{=}} 1, \u2026, ''N''}} ; ''N'' being the sample size.  The parameters are then updated such that the new component weights correspond to the average conditional probability and each component mean and covariance is the component specific weighted average of the mean and covariance of the entire sample.\n\nDempster<ref name=\"dempster1977\"/> also showed that each successive EM iteration will not decrease the likelihood, a property not shared by other gradient based maximization techniques.  Moreover, EM naturally embeds within it constraints on the probability vector, and for sufficiently large sample sizes positive definiteness of the covariance iterates.  This is a key advantage since explicitly constrained methods incur extra computational costs to check and maintain appropriate values. Theoretically EM is a first-order algorithm and as such converges slowly to a fixed-point solution. Redner and Walker (1984){{full citation needed|date=November 2012}} make this point arguing in favour of superlinear and second order Newton and quasi-Newton methods and reporting slow convergence in EM on the basis of their empirical tests.  They do concede that convergence in likelihood was rapid even if convergence in the parameter values themselves was not.  The relative merits of EM and other algorithms vis-\u00e0-vis convergence have been discussed in other literature.<ref name=XuJordam>{{cite journal |first1=L. |last1=Xu |first2=M.I. |last2=Jordan |title=On Convergence Properties of the EM Algorithm for Gaussian Mixtures |journal=Neural Computation |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=129\u2013151 |date=January 1996 |doi=10.1162/neco.1996.8.1.129 |hdl=10338.dmlcz/135225 }}</ref>\n\nOther common objections to the use of EM are that it has a propensity to spuriously identify local maxima, as well as displaying sensitivity to initial values.<ref name=\"McLachlan_2\"/><ref name=\"botev2004global\">{{Cite book |author1=Botev, Z.I. |author2=Kroese, D.P. |authorlink2=Dirk Kroese|title=Global likelihood optimization via the cross-entropy method with an application to mixture models\n|journal=[[Proceedings of the 2004 Winter Simulation Conference]] |volume= 1 |pages=517 |year=2004 |doi=10.1109/WSC.2004.1371358|isbn=978-0-7803-8786-7 |citeseerx=10.1.1.331.2319 }}</ref> One may address these problems by evaluating EM at several initial points in the parameter space but this is computationally costly and other approaches, such as the annealing EM method of Udea and Nakano (1998) (in which the initial components are essentially forced to overlap, providing a less heterogeneous basis for initial guesses), may be preferable.\n\nFigueiredo and Jain<ref name=\"Jain\" /> note that convergence to 'meaningless' parameter values obtained at the boundary (where regularity conditions breakdown, e.g., Ghosh and Sen (1985)) is frequently observed when the number of model components exceeds the optimal/true one.  On this basis they suggest a unified approach to estimation and identification in which the initial ''n'' is chosen to greatly exceed the expected optimal value.  Their optimization routine is constructed via a minimum message length (MML) criterion that effectively eliminates a candidate component if there is insufficient information to support it. In this way it is possible to systematize reductions in ''n'' and consider estimation and identification jointly.\n\nThe [[Expectation-maximization algorithm]] can be used to compute the parameters of a parametric mixture model distribution (the ''a<sub>i</sub>'' and ''\u03b8<sub>i</sub>'').  It is an [[iterative algorithm]] with two steps: an ''expectation step'' and a ''maximization step''. [http://wiki.stat.ucla.edu/socr/index.php/SOCR_EduMaterials_Activities_2D_PointSegmentation_EM_Mixture Practical examples of EM and Mixture Modeling] are included in the [[SOCR]] demonstrations.\n\n==== The expectation step ====\nWith initial guesses for the parameters of our mixture model, \"partial membership\" of each data point in each constituent distribution is computed by calculating [[expectation value]]s for the membership variables of each data point.  That is, for each data point ''x<sub>j</sub>'' and distribution ''Y<sub>i</sub>'', the membership value ''y''<sub>''i'', ''j''</sub> is:\n\n:<math> y_{i,j} = \\frac{a_i f_Y(x_j;\\theta_i)}{f_{X}(x_j)}.</math>\n\n==== The maximization step ====\nWith expectation values in hand for group membership, [[plug-in estimates]] are recomputed for the distribution parameters.\n\nThe mixing coefficients ''a<sub>i</sub>'' are the [[arithmetic mean|mean]]s of the membership values over the ''N'' data points.\n\n:<math> a_i = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^N y_{i,j}</math>\n\nThe component model parameters ''\u03b8<sub>i</sub>'' are also calculated by expectation maximization using data points ''x<sub>j</sub>'' that have been weighted using the membership values.  For example, if ''\u03b8'' is a mean ''\u03bc''\n\n:<math> \\mu_{i} = \\frac{\\sum_{j} y_{i,j}x_{j}}{\\sum_{j} y_{i,j}}.</math>\n\nWith new estimates for ''a<sub>i</sub>'' and the ''\u03b8<sub>i</sub>'''s, the expectation step is repeated to recompute new membership values.  The entire procedure is repeated until model parameters converge.\n\n=== Markov chain Monte Carlo ===\nAs an alternative to the EM algorithm, the mixture model parameters can be deduced using [[posterior sampling]] as indicated by [[Bayes' theorem]].  This is still regarded as an incomplete data problem whereby membership of data points is the missing data.  A two-step iterative procedure known as [[Gibbs sampling]] can be used.\n\nThe previous example of a mixture of two [[Gaussian distribution]]s can demonstrate how the method works.  As before, initial guesses of the parameters for the mixture model are made.  Instead of computing partial memberships for each elemental distribution, a membership value for each data point is drawn from a [[Bernoulli distribution]] (that is, it will be assigned to either the first or the second Gaussian).  The Bernoulli parameter ''\u03b8'' is determined for each data point on the basis of one of the constituent distributions.{{Vague|What does this mean?|date=March 2008}}  Draws from the distribution generate membership associations for each data point.  Plug-in estimators can then be used as in the M step of EM to generate a new set of mixture model parameters, and the binomial draw step repeated.\n\n=== Moment matching ===\nThe [[Method of moments (statistics)|method of moment matching]] is one of the oldest techniques for determining the mixture parameters dating back to Karl Pearson's seminal work of 1894.\nIn this approach the parameters of the mixture are determined such that the composite distribution has moments matching some given value.  In many instances extraction of solutions to the moment equations may present non-trivial algebraic or computational problems.  Moreover, numerical analysis by Day<ref name=day>{{Cite journal | last1 = Day | first1 = N. E. | title = Estimating the Components of a Mixture of Normal Distributions | journal = Biometrika | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 463\u2013474 | doi = 10.2307/2334652 | jstor = 2334652| year = 1969 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> has indicated that such methods may be inefficient compared to EM. Nonetheless there has been renewed interest in this method, e.g., Craigmile and Titterington (1998) and Wang.<ref name=wang>{{citation \n|title=Generating daily changes in market variables using a multivariate mixture of normal distributions\n|first = J. | last = Wang\n|date = 2001\n|journal = Proceedings of the 33rd Winter Conference on Simulation |pages   =283\u2013289\n}}</ref>\n\nMcWilliam and Loh (2009) consider the characterisation of a hyper-cuboid normal mixture [[copula (statistics)|copula]] in large dimensional systems for which EM would be computationally prohibitive.  Here a pattern analysis routine is used to generate multivariate tail-dependencies consistent with a set of univariate and (in some sense) bivariate moments.  The performance of this method is then evaluated using equity log-return data with [[Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov]] test statistics suggesting a good descriptive fit.\n\n===Spectral method===\nSome problems in mixture model estimation can be solved using [[spectral method]]s.\nIn particular it becomes useful if data points ''x<sub>i</sub>'' are points in high-dimensional [[real coordinate space|real space]], and the hidden distributions are known to be [[Logarithmically concave function|log-concave]] (such as [[Gaussian distribution]] or [[Exponential distribution]]).\n\nSpectral methods of learning mixture models are based on the use of [[Singular Value Decomposition]] of a matrix which contains data points.\nThe idea is to consider the top ''k'' singular vectors, where ''k'' is the number of distributions to be learned. The projection\nof each data point to a [[linear subspace]] spanned by those vectors groups points originating from the same distribution\nvery close together, while points from different distributions stay far apart.\n\nOne distinctive feature of the spectral method is that it allows us to [[Mathematical proof|prove]] that if\ndistributions satisfy certain separation condition (e.g., not too close), then the estimated mixture will be very close to the true one with high probability.\n\n=== Graphical Methods ===\n\nTarter and Lock<ref name=\"tart\" /> describe a graphical approach to mixture identification in which a kernel function is applied to an empirical frequency plot so to reduce intra-component variance.  In this way one may more readily identify components having differing means.  While this ''\u03bb''-method does not require prior knowledge of the number or functional form of the components its success does rely on the choice of the kernel parameters which to some extent implicitly embeds assumptions about the component structure.\n\n=== Other methods ===\n\nSome of them can even probably learn mixtures of [[heavy-tailed distribution]]s including those with\ninfinite [[variance]] (see [[#Recent Papers|links to papers]] below).\nIn this setting, EM based methods would not work, since the Expectation step would diverge due to presence of\n[[outlier]]s.\n\n=== A simulation ===\nTo simulate a sample of size ''N'' that is from a mixture of distributions ''F''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''i''=1 to ''n'', with probabilities ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> (sum=&nbsp;''p''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1):\n# Generate ''N'' random numbers from a [[categorical distribution]] of size ''n'' and probabilities ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> for ''i''=&nbsp;1=&nbsp;to&nbsp;''n''.  These tell you which of the ''F''<sub>''i''</sub> each of the ''N'' values will come from.  Denote by ''m<sub>i</sub>'' the quantity of random numbers assigned to the ''i''<sup>th</sup> category.\n# For each ''i'', generate ''m<sub>i</sub>'' random numbers from the ''F''<sub>''i''</sub> distribution.\n\n== Extensions ==\nIn a [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian setting]], additional levels can be added to the [[graphical model]] defining the mixture model.  For example, in the common [[latent Dirichlet allocation]] [[topic model]], the observations are sets of words drawn from ''D'' different documents and the ''K'' mixture components represent topics that are shared across documents.  Each document has a different set of mixture weights, which specify the topics prevalent in that document.  All sets of mixture weights share common [[hyperparameter]]s.\n\nA very common extension is to connect the [[latent variable]]s defining the mixture component identities into a [[Markov chain]], instead of assuming that they are [[independent identically distributed]] random variables.  The resulting model is termed a [[hidden Markov model]] and is one of the most common sequential hierarchical models.  Numerous extensions of hidden Markov models have been developed; see the resulting article for more information.\n\n== History ==\nMixture distributions and the problem of mixture decomposition, that is the identification of its constituent components and the parameters thereof, has been cited in the literature as far back as 1846 (Quetelet in McLachlan, <ref name=McLachlan_2>{{citation \n|title=Finite Mixture Models\n|first=G.J. |last=McLachlan\n|publisher=Wiley\n|date=2000\n}}</ref> 2000) although common reference is made to the work of [[Karl Pearson]] (1894)<ref name=Amendola2015>{{Cite journal |last=Am\u00e9ndola |first=Carlos |display-authors=etal |arxiv=1510.04654 |year=2015 |title=Moment varieties of Gaussian mixtures|doi=10.18409/jas.v7i1.42 |volume=7 |journal=Journal of Algebraic Statistics|bibcode=2015arXiv151004654A }}</ref> as the first author to explicitly address the decomposition problem in characterising non-normal attributes of forehead to body length ratios in female shore crab populations.  The motivation for this work was provided by the zoologist [[Walter Frank Raphael Weldon]] who had speculated in 1893 (in Tarter and Lock<ref name=\"tart\" />) that asymmetry in the histogram of these ratios could signal evolutionary divergence. Pearson's approach was to fit a univariate mixture of two normals to the data by choosing the five parameters of the mixture such that the empirical moments matched that of the model.\n\nWhile his work was successful in identifying two potentially distinct sub-populations and in demonstrating the flexibility of mixtures as a moment matching tool, the formulation required the solution of a 9th degree (nonic) polynomial which at the time posed a significant computational challenge.\n\nSubsequent works focused on addressing these problems, but it was not until the advent of the modern computer and the popularisation of [[Maximum Likelihood]] (MLE) parameterisation techniques that research really took off.<ref name=McLachlan_1>{{citation \n|title=Mixture Models: inference and applications to clustering\n|journal=Statistics: Textbooks and Monographs |first1=G.J. |last1=McLachlan |first2=K.E. |last2=Basford\n|date=1988\n|bibcode=1988mmia.book.....M }}</ref> Since that time there has been a vast body of research on the subject spanning areas such as [[Fishery|fisheries research]], [[agriculture]], [[botany]], [[economics]], [[medicine]], [[genetics]], [[psychology]], [[palaeontology]], [[electrophoresis]], [[finance]], [[geology]] and [[zoology]].<ref name=titter_1>{{harvnb|Titterington|Smith|Makov|1985}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n=== Mixture ===\n* [[Mixture density]]\n* [[Mixture (probability)]]\n* [[Flexible Mixture Model (FMM)]]\n\n=== Hierarchical models ===\n* [[Graphical model]]\n* [[Hierarchical Bayes model]]\n\n=== Outlier detection ===\n* [[RANSAC]]\n\n{{More footnotes|date=November 2010}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n=== Books on mixture models ===\n*{{cite book |last1=Everitt |first1=B.S. |last2=Hand |first2=D.J. |title=Finite mixture distributions |publisher=Chapman & Hall |date=1981 |isbn=978-0-412-22420-1 }}\n*{{cite book | last = Lindsay | first = B.
