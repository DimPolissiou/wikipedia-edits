The logo was officially established in 2004, but was originally proposed by a student, Sou Yoshihide, in the mid-20th century, and was used then on from 1950. There have also been alternatives designs, such as those featuring the Japanese ''KU'' or ''Q'', for Kyushu instead of \"university\".\n\nOn March 3, prior to the incorporation of national universities in April 2004, the Committee of Public Relations agreed on a new university logo and color that symbolize Kyushu University under the new structure.\n\n=== University logos ===\nThe pine needle design, which is used in the current university logo, remains in the new logo. On deciding the new logo, consideration was given as to whether it would still be highly distinctive even when electronically rendered. The introduction of the new logo, however, does not limit or eliminate the use of the previous one Fig. B.\n\nSeveral patterns of university logos (Figs. C-F) have been created for use on PR materials and merchandise. Fig. C uses the same design as Fig. A without the two Chinese characters that mean \u201cuniversity,\u201d while Fig. D illustrates a design using the capital letters of Kyushu University (KU). Fig. E symbolizes the letter \u201cq\u201d for \u201cQ-shu\u201d University. Fig. F is the logo originally printed on the university diploma. These logos are also registered and used as trademarks of Kyushu University.\n\n=== Logo color ===\nDark red colors have been used for the logo of Kyushu University. The committee chose wine red as the new university logo color given that it is similar to the previous one and does not spoil the established image of Kyushu University's logo color. Since the visual effects of color can vary according to usage, a variation of the wine color within an allowable range can be used as the logo color. To allow broader variations, the use of sub-colors was also approved.\n\n== Global 30 Project ==\nOn July 3, 2009, Kyushu University was chosen as one of thirteen venues for the \u201cGlobal 30 (G30) Project\u201d, planned and funded by Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). The major aim of the project is to further promote the globalization of Japanese higher education by assisting a select number of universities through the prioritized allocation of grants. The recipient schools are expected, among other things, to build and improve a system whereby overseas students may study and engage in research with minimal cultural and linguistic barriers. This more focused approach to budget allocation is also expected to help realize the government's public commitment to accommodate more than 300,000 international students on Japanese campuses by 2020.<ref name=\":0\">http://www.isc.kyushu-u.ac.jp/intlweb/data/pdf/gaiyou.pdf</ref>\n\nIn February 2010, the University opened an all-purpose office in Cairo, Egypt, bringing the number of its overseas offices to 13 . Although the Cairo Office is managed by Kyushu University, all other Japanese colleges and universities can have access to its services and facilities when trying to recruit students or promote academic projects in Egypt.\n\nBy implementing these measures, Kyushu University is expecting to raise the number of its international students to 3,900 within a decade, a 300% increase over the current number. By the time the five-year grant terminates, the University will also have laid the foundation for a new interdisciplinary department (tentatively called the \u201cInternational School of Arts and Sciences\u201d), which is expected to launch by 2020.\n\n=== Liberal arts subjects and basic sciences ===\nFor the first year and a half, students in the international undergraduate programs study various liberal arts subjects and basic sciences. This segment of the programs aims not only to equip students with in-depth liberal arts knowledge and to help them deepen their understanding of various disciplines, but also to broaden their range of interests, and to enable them to continue learning independently.\n\n== Short-term programs ==\n*Japan in Today's World \"JTW\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Kyushu University \"Japan in Today's World\" Program|url = http://www.isc.kyushu-u.ac.jp/jtw/|website = www.isc.kyushu-u.ac.jp|access-date = 2016-02-22}}</ref>\n*ASEAN in Today's World (AsTW)<ref>{{Cite web|title = ASEAN International Education Programme|url = http://www.isc.kyushu-u.ac.jp/astw/|website = www.isc.kyushu-u.ac.jp|access-date = 2016-02-22}}</ref>\n\n== International Cooperation<ref name=\":0\"/> ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== MJIIT (Malaysia-Japan International Institute of Technology) ===\nThe governments of Japan and Malaysia have jointly established a university in Malaysia which follows the Japanese style of education in engineering. It opened in September 2011. From the time the concept of this project was initiated, Kyushu University has played a core role and now, as the leading university of mechanical precision engineering subcommittee of a school specializing in precision mechanical engineering, it hopes to take an active role in the promotion of this project.\n\n=== AUN/SEED-NET ===\n(ASEAN University Network/ Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network) The AUN/SEED-Net was established in 2003 to full the following; to strengthen the main ASEAN universities education and research abilities, to strengthen the network between the universities of all the countries involved, including Japan, as well as, continuing to produce scientists needed in the economic and social areas of ASEAN nations. By accepting International Students and dispatching teachers, Kyushu University endeavors to train teachers of universities in ASEAN nations.\n\n=== BOP by ICT ===\nIncome generation project for farmers at the BOP by ICT Kyushu University uses the funding from JICA to support Bangladeshi farming villages by creating business centers where ICT is used to provide farmers with the necessary information for farming. These centers are available anytime the farmer would like to visit. They are information hubs, where useful information regarding farmers produce and sales are being distributed by the use of ICT, amongst farmers in the hope that this will improve their income and reduce poverty.\n\n== University libraries ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Ito Library Retriever.jpg|thumb|Automated storage and retrieval system installed at the Ito Library]]\n* Central Library (Hakozaki Campus)\n* Medical Library (Medical Campus)\n* Design Library (Ohashi Campus)\n* Chikushi Library (Chikushi Campus)\n* Ito Library (Ito Campus)\n* Humanities and Social Sciences Library (Hakozaki Campus)\n* Manuscript Library (Hakozaki Campus)\n\n=== Number of holdings ===\n({{As of|2011|04|01}})\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!CJK\n!Western\n!Total\n|-\n|Books (Volumes)\n|2,283,821\n|1,773,967\n|4,057,788\n|-\n|Serials (Titles)\n|53,536\n|40,385\n|93,921\n|}\n\n==Undergraduate schools==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n{{wide image|West Zone Panorama.jpg|1049px|alt=|West Zone panoramic shot with Open Learning Plaza}}\n* School of Interdisciplinary Science & Innovation \n* School of Letters\n* School of Education\n* School of Law\n* School of Economics\n* School of Sciences\n* School of Medicine\n* School of Dentistry\n* School of Pharmaceutical Sciences\n* School of Engineering\n* School of Design\n* School of Agriculture\n* The 21st Century Program\n\n== Graduate schools and faculties ==\nKyushu University has instituted a Graduate School/Graduate Faculty system - the first attempt of this kind at a Japanese university - as part of the overall reorganization of undergraduate and graduate education at the university in 2000. In separating the former Graduate School into the Graduate School (the education body) and the Graduate Faculty (the research body to which faculty members belong), the University is seeking to revitalize relationships between the Graduate Faculty and the Graduate School, and the Graduate Faculty and Undergraduate School. These changes should promote a more dynamic functioning of the Graduate Faculty in its relation to the Graduate School and the Undergraduate School. (Refer to chart  below.)<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nUnder the Graduate School/Faculty system, all faculty members have been transferred from members of the Undergraduate Faculty to members of the Graduate Faculty. In addition, the educational body (Graduate School) and research body (Graduate Faculty) have become independent administrative entities. This new, more responsive administrative mechanism will enable Graduate Faculty members to participate more flexibly in the education of both the Undergraduate and Graduate School bodies. In implementing a more dynamic configuration of the education bodies (Undergraduate and Graduate Schools) and research body (Graduate Faculty), the university can more readily accommodate changes and shifts to pedagogic and research foci that may occur in the future.\n\n{| style=\"width:70%;\"\n|-\n|'''Graduate Schools'''\n|'''Graduate Faculties'''\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n* [http://www2.lit.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/ Graduate School of Humanities] \n* [http://www.scs.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/  Graduate School of Social and Cultural Studies]\n* [http://www.hues.kyushu-u.ac.jp/english/ Graduate School of Human-Environment Studies]\n* [http://www.law.kyushu-u.ac.jp/programsinenglish/  International Graduate Programs in Law] \n# [http://www.law.kyushu-u.ac.jp/programsinenglish/lld  Doctoral Program in Law (LL.D.)] \n# [http://www.law.kyushu-u.ac.jp/programsinenglish/iebl  International Economic & Business Law (IEBL) Program (LL.M.)] \n# [http://www.law.kyushu-u.ac.jp/programsinenglish/ylp  Young Leaders\u2019 Program (YLP) in Law (LL.M.)] \n# [http://www.law.kyushu-u.ac.jp/programsinenglish/bip  Bilingual Program (BIP) in Law (LL.M.)] \n# [http://www.law.kyushu-u.ac.jp/programsinenglish/ddp  Double Degree LL.M.

The 21st century will be the time of \u201csoft materials\u201d, including polymers, colloids, gels, vesicles, emulsions, films, surfactants, micelles, suspensions and liquid crystals. They are essential to produce various electrical & optical devices, and biodevices etc. The soft materials are increasingly indispensable in our daily lives. Since surfaces and interfaces of soft materials\u201c( soft interfaces\u201d) play an important role in various technological applications and bio-interfaces, precise control of soft interfaces would greatly promote the innovation of future science and technology. In this project, we are focusing on the understanding of fundamental science of soft interfaces formed in nature and extract the molecular and structure design principles. The following three groups are organized in order to pursue this project: 1) Precise molecular design of soft interfaces based on precise synthetic chemistry, 2) Hierarchical structural control and fabrication of soft interfaces through understanding natural systems, and 3) Development of in situ and dynamical characterization methods of soft interfaces.\n\n==Academic rankings==\n{{Infobox Japanese university ranking\n| TSU_N = 8\n| Kawai_N = 7\n| TR_N = 6\n| WE_N = 53\n| NikkeiBP_G = \n| NikkeiBP_H = \n| NikkeiBP_K = \n| NikkeiBP_C = \n| NikkeiBP_KOY = 1\n| GBUDU_N = SA\n| LINE_1 = 0\n| QS_A = 18\n| ARWU_A = 19-26\n| LINE_2 = 0\n| QS_W = 126\n| THE_W = 401-500\n| ARWU_W = 151-200\n| TR_W = \n| ENSMP_W = 38\n}}\n{{Infobox Japanese university ranking (By Subject)\n| SOC_1 = 0\n| LAW_1 = 0\n| ASAHI_L = \n| BE_N = 15\n| BE_PR = 17\n| ECON_1 = \n| RE_N = \n| RE_W = \n| BUS_1 = 0\n| ED_N = 18\n| ED_W = 616\n| CPA_N = \n| LINE_1 = 0\n| NSTR_1 = 0\n| ENG_1 = 0\n| NENG_N = 11\n| MAT_1 = 0\n| TR_N1 = 6\n| TR_W1 = 49\n| PHY_1 = \n| TR_N2 = \n| TR_W2 = \n| CHE_1 = 0\n| TR_N3 = 6\n| TR_W3 = 41\n| BIO_1 = 0\n| TR_N4 = 4\n| TR_W4 = 95\n| MATH_1 = \n| ARWU_N1 = \n| ARWU_W1 = \n| COM_1 = \n| ARWU_N2 = \n| ARWU_W2 = \n| ARC_1 = \n| ARC_N = \n| LINE_2 = 0\n| LIFE_1 = 0\n| IMM_1 = 0\n| TR_N5 = 4\n| TR_W5 = 68\n| PHT_1 = 0\n| TR_N6 = 4\n| TR_W6 = 76\n| LINE_3 = 0\n| NOTE_1 = T.

The logo was officially established in 2004, but was originally proposed by a student, Sou Yoshihide, in the mid-20th century, and was used then on from 1950. There have also been alternatives designs, such as those featuring the Japanese ''KU'' or ''Q'', for Kyushu instead of \"university\".\n\nOn March 3, prior to the incorporation of national universities in April 2004, the Committee of Public Relations agreed on a new university logo and color that symbolize Kyushu University under the new structure.\n\n=== University logos ===\nThe pine needle design, which is used in the current university logo, remains in the new logo. On deciding the new logo, consideration was given as to whether it would still be highly distinctive even when electronically rendered. The introduction of the new logo, however, does not limit or eliminate the use of the previous one Fig. B.\n\nSeveral patterns of university logos (Figs. C-F) have been created for use on PR materials and merchandise. Fig. C uses the same design as Fig. A without the two Chinese characters that mean \u201cuniversity,\u201d while Fig. D illustrates a design using the capital letters of Kyushu University (KU). Fig. E symbolizes the letter \u201cq\u201d for \u201cQ-shu\u201d University. Fig. F is the logo originally printed on the university diploma. These logos are also registered and used as trademarks of Kyushu University.\n\n=== Logo color ===\nDark red colors have been used for the logo of Kyushu University. The committee chose wine red as the new university logo color given that it is similar to the previous one and does not spoil the established image of Kyushu University's logo color. Since the visual effects of color can vary according to usage, a variation of the wine color within an allowable range can be used as the logo color. To allow broader variations, the use of sub-colors was also approved.\n\n== Global 30 Project ==\nOn July 3, 2009, Kyushu University was chosen as one of thirteen venues for the \u201cGlobal 30 (G30) Project\u201d, planned and funded by Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). The major aim of the project is to further promote the globalization of Japanese higher education by assisting a select number of universities through the prioritized allocation of grants. The recipient schools are expected, among other things, to build and improve a system whereby overseas students may study and engage in research with minimal cultural and linguistic barriers. This more focused approach to budget allocation is also expected to help realize the government's public commitment to accommodate more than 300,000 international students on Japanese campuses by 2020.<ref name=\":0\">http://www.isc.kyushu-u.ac.jp/intlweb/data/pdf/gaiyou.pdf</ref>\n\nIn February 2010, the University opened an all-purpose office in Cairo, Egypt, bringing the number of its overseas offices to 13 . Although the Cairo Office is managed by Kyushu University, all other Japanese colleges and universities can have access to its services and facilities when trying to recruit students or promote academic projects in Egypt.\n\nBy implementing these measures, Kyushu University is expecting to raise the number of its international students to 3,900 within a decade, a 300% increase over the current number. By the time the five-year grant terminates, the University will also have laid the foundation for a new interdisciplinary department (tentatively called the \u201cInternational School of Arts and Sciences\u201d), which is expected to launch by 2020.\n\n=== Liberal arts subjects and basic sciences ===\nFor the first year and a half, students in the international undergraduate programs study various liberal arts subjects and basic sciences. This segment of the programs aims not only to equip students with in-depth liberal arts knowledge and to help them deepen their understanding of various disciplines, but also to broaden their range of interests, and to enable them to continue learning independently.\n\n== Short-term programs ==\n*Japan in Today's World \"JTW\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Kyushu University \"Japan in Today's World\" Program|url = http://www.isc.kyushu-u.ac.jp/jtw/|website = www.isc.kyushu-u.ac.jp|access-date = 2016-02-22}}</ref>\n*ASEAN in Today's World (AsTW)<ref>{{Cite web|title = ASEAN International Education Programme|url = http://www.isc.kyushu-u.ac.jp/astw/|website = www.isc.kyushu-u.ac.jp|access-date = 2016-02-22}}</ref>\n\n== International Cooperation<ref name=\":0\"/> ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n=== MJIIT (Malaysia-Japan International Institute of Technology) ===\nThe governments of Japan and Malaysia have jointly established a university in Malaysia which follows the Japanese style of education in engineering. It opened in September 2011. From the time the concept of this project was initiated, Kyushu University has played a core role and now, as the leading university of mechanical precision engineering subcommittee of a school specializing in precision mechanical engineering, it hopes to take an active role in the promotion of this project.\n\n=== AUN/SEED-NET ===\n(ASEAN University Network/ Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network) The AUN/SEED-Net was established in 2003 to full the following; to strengthen the main ASEAN universities education and research abilities, to strengthen the network between the universities of all the countries involved, including Japan, as well as, continuing to produce scientists needed in the economic and social areas of ASEAN nations. By accepting International Students and dispatching teachers, Kyushu University endeavors to train teachers of universities in ASEAN nations.\n\n=== BOP by ICT ===\nIncome generation project for farmers at the BOP by ICT Kyushu University uses the funding from JICA to support Bangladeshi farming villages by creating business centers where ICT is used to provide farmers with the necessary information for farming. These centers are available anytime the farmer would like to visit. They are information hubs, where useful information regarding farmers produce and sales are being distributed by the use of ICT, amongst farmers in the hope that this will improve their income and reduce poverty.\n\n== University libraries ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Ito Library Retriever.jpg|thumb|Automated storage and retrieval system installed at the Ito Library]]\n* Central Library (Hakozaki Campus)\n* Medical Library (Medical Campus)\n* Design Library (Ohashi Campus)\n* Chikushi Library (Chikushi Campus)\n* Ito Library (Ito Campus)\n* Humanities and Social Sciences Library (Hakozaki Campus)\n* Manuscript Library (Hakozaki Campus)\n\n=== Number of holdings ===\n({{As of|2011|04|01}})\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!CJK\n!Western\n!Total\n|-\n|Books (Volumes)\n|2,283,821\n|1,773,967\n|4,057,788\n|-\n|Serials (Titles)\n|53,536\n|40,385\n|93,921\n|}\n\n==Undergraduate schools==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n{{wide image|West Zone Panorama.jpg|1049px|alt=|West Zone panoramic shot with Open Learning Plaza}}\n* School of Interdisciplinary Science & Innovation \n* School of Letters\n* School of Education\n* School of Law\n* School of Economics\n* School of Sciences\n* School of Medicine\n* School of Dentistry\n* School of Pharmaceutical Sciences\n* School of Engineering\n* School of Design\n* School of Agriculture\n* The 21st Century Program\n\n== Graduate schools and faculties ==\nKyushu University has instituted a Graduate School/Graduate Faculty system - the first attempt of this kind at a Japanese university - as part of the overall reorganization of undergraduate and graduate education at the university in 2000. In separating the former Graduate School into the Graduate School (the education body) and the Graduate Faculty (the research body to which faculty members belong), the University is seeking to revitalize relationships between the Graduate Faculty and the Graduate School, and the Graduate Faculty and Undergraduate School. These changes should promote a more dynamic functioning of the Graduate Faculty in its relation to the Graduate School and the Undergraduate School. (Refer to chart  below.)<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nUnder the Graduate School/Faculty system, all faculty members have been transferred from members of the Undergraduate Faculty to members of the Graduate Faculty. In addition, the educational body (Graduate School) and research body (Graduate Faculty) have become independent administrative entities. This new, more responsive administrative mechanism will enable Graduate Faculty members to participate more flexibly in the education of both the Undergraduate and Graduate School bodies. In implementing a more dynamic configuration of the education bodies (Undergraduate and Graduate Schools) and research body (Graduate Faculty), the university can more readily accommodate changes and shifts to pedagogic and research foci that may occur in the future.\n\n{| style=\"width:70%;\"\n|-\n|'''Graduate Schools'''\n|'''Graduate Faculties'''\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n* [http://www2.lit.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/ Graduate School of Humanities] \n* [http://www.scs.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/  Graduate School of Social and Cultural Studies]\n* [http://www.hues.kyushu-u.ac.jp/english/ Graduate School of Human-Environment Studies]\n* [http://www.law.kyushu-u.ac.jp/programsinenglish/  International Graduate Programs in Law] \n# [http://www.law.kyushu-u.ac.jp/programsinenglish/lld  Doctoral Program in Law (LL.D.)] \n# [http://www.law.kyushu-u.ac.jp/programsinenglish/iebl  International Economic & Business Law (IEBL) Program (LL.M.)] \n# [http://www.law.kyushu-u.ac.jp/programsinenglish/ylp  Young Leaders\u2019 Program (YLP) in Law (LL.M.)] \n# [http://www.law.kyushu-u.ac.jp/programsinenglish/bip  Bilingual Program (BIP) in Law (LL.M.)] \n# [http://www.law.kyushu-u.ac.jp/programsinenglish/ddp  Double Degree LL.M.

The 21st century will be the time of \u201csoft materials\u201d, including polymers, colloids, gels, vesicles, emulsions, films, surfactants, micelles, suspensions and liquid crystals. They are essential to produce various electrical & optical devices, and biodevices etc. The soft materials are increasingly indispensable in our daily lives. Since surfaces and interfaces of soft materials\u201c( soft interfaces\u201d) play an important role in various technological applications and bio-interfaces, precise control of soft interfaces would greatly promote the innovation of future science and technology. In this project, we are focusing on the understanding of fundamental science of soft interfaces formed in nature and extract the molecular and structure design principles. The following three groups are organized in order to pursue this project: 1) Precise molecular design of soft interfaces based on precise synthetic chemistry, 2) Hierarchical structural control and fabrication of soft interfaces through understanding natural systems, and 3) Development of in situ and dynamical characterization methods of soft interfaces.\n\n==Academic rankings==\n{{Infobox Japanese university ranking\n| TSU_N = 8\n| Kawai_N = 7\n| TR_N = 6\n| WE_N = 53\n| NikkeiBP_G = \n| NikkeiBP_H = \n| NikkeiBP_K = \n| NikkeiBP_C = \n| NikkeiBP_KOY = 1\n| GBUDU_N = SA\n| LINE_1 = 0\n| QS_A = 18\n| ARWU_A = 19-26\n| LINE_2 = 0\n| QS_W = 126\n| THE_W = 401-500\n| ARWU_W = 151-200\n| TR_W = \n| ENSMP_W = 38\n}}\n{{Infobox Japanese university ranking (By Subject)\n| SOC_1 = 0\n| LAW_1 = 0\n| ASAHI_L = \n| BE_N = 15\n| BE_PR = 17\n| ECON_1 = \n| RE_N = \n| RE_W = \n| BUS_1 = 0\n| ED_N = 18\n| ED_W = 616\n| CPA_N = \n| LINE_1 = 0\n| NSTR_1 = 0\n| ENG_1 = 0\n| NENG_N = 11\n| MAT_1 = 0\n| TR_N1 = 6\n| TR_W1 = 49\n| PHY_1 = \n| TR_N2 = \n| TR_W2 = \n| CHE_1 = 0\n| TR_N3 = 6\n| TR_W3 = 41\n| BIO_1 = 0\n| TR_N4 = 4\n| TR_W4 = 95\n| MATH_1 = \n| ARWU_N1 = \n| ARWU_W1 = \n| COM_1 = \n| ARWU_N2 = \n| ARWU_W2 = \n| ARC_1 = \n| ARC_N = \n| LINE_2 = 0\n| LIFE_1 = 0\n| IMM_1 = 0\n| TR_N5 = 4\n| TR_W5 = 68\n| PHT_1 = 0\n| TR_N6 = 4\n| TR_W6 = 76\n| LINE_3 = 0\n| NOTE_1 = T.

Even after the 1866 reforms, the scale of abuse and conditions of near slavery did not get any better \u2013 if anything they deteriorated. In the early 1870s increased media exposure of the trade led to a public outcry, and the British, as well as the [[Qing government]], put pressure on the Portuguese authorities to bring the trade at Macau to an end; this was ultimately achieved in 1874.<ref name=\"whkmla\" /> By that time, a total of up to half a million Chinese workers had been exported.<ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/?id=H7dBmBsd-XgC |title = The Coolie Trade: The Traffic in Chinese Laborers to Latin America 1847\u20131874 |last = Meagher |first = Arnold J. |year=2008 |publisher = Arnold J. |accessdate = 7 February 2013 |isbn = 9781436309431 }}</ref>\n\nThe term ''coolie'' was also applied to Chinese workers recruited for contracts on cacao plantations in [[German Samoa]].

In 1908, a Chinese commissioner, Lin Shu Fen, reported on the cruel treatment of coolie workers on German plantations in the western Samoan Islands. The trade began largely after the establishment of colonial German Samoa in 1900 and lasted until the arrival of New Zealand forces in 1914.

By 1830, over 3,000 labourers had been transported. After this trade was discovered, the French successfully negotiated with the British in 1860 for permission to transport over 6,000 workers annually, on condition that the trade would be suspended if abuses were discovered to be taking place.<ref name=CoolieLabor18/><ref>{{cite web|title=St. Lucia's Indian Arrival Day|year=2009|publisher=Caribbean Repeating Islands|url=http://repeatingislands.com/2009/05/07/st-lucia\u2019s-indian-arrival-day/}}</ref>\n\nThe British began to transport Indians to [[Mauritius]] in the [[Indian Ocean islands|Indian Ocean]], starting in 1829. [[Slavery]] had been abolished, with the planters receiving two million pounds sterling in compensation for the loss of their slaves. The planters turned to bringing in a large number of [[Indentured servant|indentured labourers]] from India to work in the sugar cane fields. Between 1834 and 1921, around half a million indentured labourers were present on the island. They worked on sugar estates, factories, in transport and on construction sites.<ref name=SouthAsianLabourers4>{{cite web |title=Indian indentured labourers |publisher=The National Archives, Government of the United Kingdom |year=2010 |url = http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/records/research-guides/indian-indentured-labour.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1837, the [[East India Company|Raj]] issued a set of regulations for the trade. The rules provided for each labourer to be personally authorised for transportation by an officer designated by the Government, limited the length of service to five years subject to voluntary renewal, made the contractor responsible for returning the worker after the contract elapsed and required the vessels to conform to basic [[Occupational safety and health|health standards]].<ref name=\"whkmla\" />\n\n[[File:Newly arrived coolies in Trinidad.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Newly arrived Indian coolies in [[Trinidad]].]]\n\nDespite this, conditions on the ships were often extremely crowded, with rampant disease and [[malnutrition]]. Coolies were also not informed about the length of the trip or about the island that they would be going to.<ref name=\":1\" /> The workers were paid a pittance for their labour, and were expected to work in often awful and harsh conditions. Although there were no large scale scandals involving coolie abuse in British colonies, workers often ended up being forced to work, and manipulated in such a way that they became dependent on the plantation owners so that in practice they remained there long after their contracts expired; possibly as little as 10% of the coolies actually returned to their original country of origin. Colonial legislation was also passed to severely limit their freedoms; in Mauritius a compulsory [[Internal passport|pass system]] was instituted to enable their movements to be easily tracked. Conditions were much worse in the French colonies of [[R\u00e9union|Reunion]] and [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]], where workers were 'systematically overworked' and abnormally high [[mortality rate]]s were recorded for those working in the mines.<ref name=\"whkmla\" /> Generally, Indian coolies were noted to have higher mortality rates as a whole, and were less likely to be able to return home.<ref name=\":0\" /> Companies would often promise good food, durable clothing, adequate housing, safe passage, and schools. However, these promises were rarely kept, leading to the higher mortality rate and image of Indian coolies being \"dirty\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe voyage itself was often a highly dangerous venture, especially for coolie women. Though some ships had made attempts to prevent assault, rape, and general mistreatment in sailor contracts, these crimes were still common. Even with punishments in place, on ship and land, men who assaulted women and children were rarely punished, leaving women in an even more vulnerable position.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coolie Woman: The Odyssey of Indenture|last=Bahadur|first=Gaiutra|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=51\u201356}}</ref>\n\nHowever, there were also attempts by the British authorities to regulate and mitigate the worst abuses. Workers were regularly checked up on by [[health inspector]]s, and they were vetted before transportation to ensure that they were suitably healthy and fit to be able to endure the rigours of labour. Children under the age of 15 were not allowed to be transported from their parents under any circumstances.<ref name=\"whkmla\" />\n\nThe first campaign against the 'coolie' trade in England likened the system of [[indentured labour]] to the slavery of the past. The campaign against coolie emigration was led by [[Joseph Sturge]], with the Society of Friends. Petitions from Sturge, the Society of Friends, various other humanitarian groups, and from citizens of entire cities were routinely sent to the Colonial Offices.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Erickson |first=Edgar |date=June 1934 |title=The Introduction of East Indian Coolies into the British West Indies |url= |journal=The Journal of Modern History |volume=6 |issue=2 |page = 132  |doi=10.1086/236112}}</ref> In response to this pressure, the labour export was temporarily stopped in 1839 by the authorities when the scale of the abuses became known, but it was soon renewed due to its growing economic importance. A more rigorous regulatory framework was put into place and [[Fine (penalty)|severe penalties]] were imposed for infractions in 1842. In that year, almost 35,000 people were shipped to Mauritius.<ref name=\"whkmla\" />\n\nIn 1844, the trade was expanded to the colonies in the [[West Indies]], including [[Jamaica]], [[Trinidad]] and [[Demerara]], where the Asian population was soon a major component of the island demographic.\n\n[[File:H09620.jpg|thumb|right|Members of the [[Chinese Labour Corps]] carry out riveting work at the Central Workshops of the [[Royal Tank Regiment]].]]\n\nStarting in 1879, many Indians were transported to [[Fiji]] to work on the [[sugar cane]] plantations. Many of them [[Indians in Fiji|chose to stay]] after their term of indenture elapsed and today they number about 40% of the total population. Indian workers were also imported into the Dutch colony of [[Suriname]] after the Dutch [[Anglo-Dutch Treaties of 1870\u201371|signed a treaty with the United Kingdom on the recruitment of contract workers]] in 1870. In Mauritius, the Indian population are now demographically dominant, with [[Indian festivals]] being celebrated as [[Culture of Mauritius#Public holidays and festivals|national holidays]].<ref name=\"whkmla\" />\n\nThis system prevailed until the early twentieth century. Increasing focus on the brutalities and abuses of the trade by the [[sensationalist]] media of the time, incited public outrage and lead to the official ending of the coolie trade in 1916 by the British government.

With women as a severe minority, their morality was questioned and the actions of men as a result of having so few women was blamed on the women. Between 1858 and 1859, laws were put into place stating that the ratio of men to women could not exceed 2:1, whereas before it was 3:1. However, there continued to be a severe shortage of women. This gave women a new sense of power when it came to choosing a partner. With a shortage of women, it became the responsibility of the male suitor to provide a hefty dowry to a woman's father, regardless of what caste she came from.<ref name=\":2\">Patricia Mohammd, \"Gender Negotiations Among Indians in Trinidad, 917-1947,\" in ''The Caribbean History Reader'', ed. Nicola Foote (New York: Routledge, 2013), 192-194.</ref> Unfortunately, this also put women in a very vulnerable position, especially when alone. Rape was a common occurrence, and there were accounts of women being bound and gagged in their own home by men. Between 1872 and 1900, it was reported that 87 women were murdered with 65 of those being married women who were accused of being unfaithful.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe scarcity of Indian women in the Caribbean may not have been completely due to the women's inability to perform work required of them. Many coolie women saw the chance to leave for the Caribbean as a way to escape abusive husbands, to hide pregnancy, to escape shame, or to simply find a better life. The 1883 Indian Immigration Act aimed to stop women from escaping their abusive husbands, which in turn made it much more difficult for women to emigrate. This in part due to an agent generally needing to travel to the woman's village in order to verify who she was.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coolie Woman: The Odyssey of Indenture|last=Bahadur|first=Gaiutra|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=26\u201328}}</ref>\n\nChinese women were scarce in every place where Chinese indentured laborers were brought, the migration was dominated by Chinese men.<ref>{{cite book|page=69|year=2010|accessdate=17 May 2014|publisher=BRILL|volume=|author=Isabelle Lausent-Herrera|editor1=Walton Look Lai|editor2=Chee Beng Tan|quote=|location=|title=The Chinese in Latin America and the Caribbean|series=Brill ebook titles|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xrGShVU6VrgC&pg=PA69&dq=walton+look+lie+carribean+chinese+indian+women#v=onepage&q=walton%20look%20lie%20carribean%20chinese%20indian%20women&f=false|isbn=978-9004182134}}</ref> Up to the 1940s men made up the vast majority of the Costa Rican Chinese community.<ref>{{cite book|page=116|year=2010|accessdate=17 May 2014|publisher=BRILL|volume=|author=Isabelle Lausent-Herrera|editor1=Walton Look Lai|editor2=Chee Beng Tan|quote=|location=|title=The Chinese in Latin America and the Caribbean|series=Brill ebook titles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xrGShVU6VrgC&pg=PA116#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=978-9004182134}}</ref> Males made up the majority of the original Chinese community in Mexico and they married Mexican women.<ref>{{cite book|page=68|year=2010|accessdate=17 May 2014|publisher=BRILL|volume=|author=Isabelle Lausent-Herrera|editor1=Walton Look Lai|editor2=Chee Beng Tan|quote=|location=|title=The Chinese in Latin America and the Caribbean|series=Brill ebook titles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xrGShVU6VrgC&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=978-9004182134}}</ref> One stark difference between Indian and Chinese coolies was the treatment of women, despite both groups having a severe shortage.

The employers in the [[British West Indies]] declined these conditions, bringing the trade there to an end. Until the trade was finally abolished in 1875, over 150,000 coolies had been sold to Cuba alone, the majority having been shipped from Macau. These labourers endured conditions far worse than those experienced by their Indian counterparts. Even after the 1866 reforms, the scale of abuse and conditions of near slavery did not get any better \u2013 if anything they deteriorated. In the early 1870s increased media exposure of the trade led to a public outcry, and the British, as well as the [[Qing government]], put pressure on the Portuguese authorities to bring the trade at Macau to an end; this was ultimately achieved in 1874.<ref name=\"whkmla\" /> By that time, a total of up to half a million Chinese workers had been exported.<ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/?id=H7dBmBsd-XgC |title = The Coolie Trade: The Traffic in Chinese Laborers to Latin America 1847\u20131874 |last = Meagher |first = Arnold J. |year=2008 |publisher = Arnold J. |accessdate = 7 February 2013 |isbn = 9781436309431 }}</ref>\n\nThe term ''coolie'' was also applied to Chinese workers recruited for contracts on cacao plantations in [[German Samoa]]. German planters went to great lengths to secure access to their \"coolie\" labour supply from China. In 1908, a Chinese commissioner, Lin Shu Fen, reported on the cruel treatment of coolie workers on German plantations in the western Samoan Islands. The trade began largely after the establishment of colonial German Samoa in 1900 and lasted until the arrival of New Zealand forces in 1914. More than 2000 Chinese \"coolies\" were present in the islands in 1914 and most were eventually repatriated by the New Zealand administration.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Indian coolies===\n{{see also | Girmityas | Indian diaspora | Colonial India }}\n\n[[File:Fete des travailleurs indiens.jpg|thumb|[[Hindu]] festival for the indentured Indian workers, on the French colony [[R\u00e9union]].]]\n[[File:East Indian Coolies in Trinidad - Project Gutenberg eText 16035.jpg|thumb|Indentured [[Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian]] \"coolies\" singing and dancing on an estate in [[Trinidad and Tobago]].]]\n\nBy the 1820s, many Indians were voluntarily enlisting to go abroad for work, in the hopes of a better life.

By 1830, over 3,000 labourers had been transported. After this trade was discovered, the French successfully negotiated with the British in 1860 for permission to transport over 6,000 workers annually, on condition that the trade would be suspended if abuses were discovered to be taking place.<ref name=CoolieLabor18/><ref>{{cite web|title=St. Lucia's Indian Arrival Day|year=2009|publisher=Caribbean Repeating Islands|url=http://repeatingislands.com/2009/05/07/st-lucia\u2019s-indian-arrival-day/}}</ref>\n\nThe British began to transport Indians to [[Mauritius]] in the [[Indian Ocean islands|Indian Ocean]], starting in 1829. [[Slavery]] had been abolished, with the planters receiving two million pounds sterling in compensation for the loss of their slaves. The planters turned to bringing in a large number of [[Indentured servant|indentured labourers]] from India to work in the sugar cane fields. Between 1834 and 1921, around half a million indentured labourers were present on the island. They worked on sugar estates, factories, in transport and on construction sites.<ref name=SouthAsianLabourers4>{{cite web |title=Indian indentured labourers |publisher=The National Archives, Government of the United Kingdom |year=2010 |url = http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/records/research-guides/indian-indentured-labour.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1837, the [[East India Company|Raj]] issued a set of regulations for the trade. The rules provided for each labourer to be personally authorised for transportation by an officer designated by the Government, limited the length of service to five years subject to voluntary renewal, made the contractor responsible for returning the worker after the contract elapsed and required the vessels to conform to basic [[Occupational safety and health|health standards]].<ref name=\"whkmla\" />\n\n[[File:Newly arrived coolies in Trinidad.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Newly arrived Indian coolies in [[Trinidad]].]]\n\nDespite this, conditions on the ships were often extremely crowded, with rampant disease and [[malnutrition]]. Coolies were also not informed about the length of the trip or about the island that they would be going to.<ref name=\":1\" /> The workers were paid a pittance for their labour, and were expected to work in often awful and harsh conditions. Although there were no large scale scandals involving coolie abuse in British colonies, workers often ended up being forced to work, and manipulated in such a way that they became dependent on the plantation owners so that in practice they remained there long after their contracts expired; possibly as little as 10% of the coolies actually returned to their original country of origin. Colonial legislation was also passed to severely limit their freedoms; in Mauritius a compulsory [[Internal passport|pass system]] was instituted to enable their movements to be easily tracked. Conditions were much worse in the French colonies of [[R\u00e9union|Reunion]] and [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]], where workers were 'systematically overworked' and abnormally high [[mortality rate]]s were recorded for those working in the mines.<ref name=\"whkmla\" /> Generally, Indian coolies were noted to have higher mortality rates as a whole, and were less likely to be able to return home.<ref name=\":0\" /> Companies would often promise good food, durable clothing, adequate housing, safe passage, and schools. However, these promises were rarely kept, leading to the higher mortality rate and image of Indian coolies being \"dirty\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe voyage itself was often a highly dangerous venture, especially for coolie women. Though some ships had made attempts to prevent assault, rape, and general mistreatment in sailor contracts, these crimes were still common. Even with punishments in place, on ship and land, men who assaulted women and children were rarely punished, leaving women in an even more vulnerable position.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coolie Woman: The Odyssey of Indenture|last=Bahadur|first=Gaiutra|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=51\u201356}}</ref>\n\nHowever, there were also attempts by the British authorities to regulate and mitigate the worst abuses. Workers were regularly checked up on by [[health inspector]]s, and they were vetted before transportation to ensure that they were suitably healthy and fit to be able to endure the rigours of labour. Children under the age of 15 were not allowed to be transported from their parents under any circumstances.<ref name=\"whkmla\" />\n\nThe first campaign against the 'coolie' trade in England likened the system of [[indentured labour]] to the slavery of the past. The campaign against coolie emigration was led by [[Joseph Sturge]], with the Society of Friends. Petitions from Sturge, the Society of Friends, various other humanitarian groups, and from citizens of entire cities were routinely sent to the Colonial Offices.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Erickson |first=Edgar |date=June 1934 |title=The Introduction of East Indian Coolies into the British West Indies |url= |journal=The Journal of Modern History |volume=6 |issue=2 |page = 132  |doi=10.1086/236112}}</ref> In response to this pressure, the labour export was temporarily stopped in 1839 by the authorities when the scale of the abuses became known, but it was soon renewed due to its growing economic importance. A more rigorous regulatory framework was put into place and [[Fine (penalty)|severe penalties]] were imposed for infractions in 1842. In that year, almost 35,000 people were shipped to Mauritius.<ref name=\"whkmla\" />\n\nIn 1844, the trade was expanded to the colonies in the [[West Indies]], including [[Jamaica]], [[Trinidad]] and [[Demerara]], where the Asian population was soon a major component of the island demographic.\n\n[[File:H09620.jpg|thumb|right|Members of the [[Chinese Labour Corps]] carry out riveting work at the Central Workshops of the [[Royal Tank Regiment]].]]\n\nStarting in 1879, many Indians were transported to [[Fiji]] to work on the [[sugar cane]] plantations. Many of them [[Indians in Fiji|chose to stay]] after their term of indenture elapsed and today they number about 40% of the total population. Indian workers were also imported into the Dutch colony of [[Suriname]] after the Dutch [[Anglo-Dutch Treaties of 1870\u201371|signed a treaty with the United Kingdom on the recruitment of contract workers]] in 1870. In Mauritius, the Indian population are now demographically dominant, with [[Indian festivals]] being celebrated as [[Culture of Mauritius#Public holidays and festivals|national holidays]].<ref name=\"whkmla\" />\n\nThis system prevailed until the early twentieth century. Increasing focus on the brutalities and abuses of the trade by the [[sensationalist]] media of the time, incited public outrage and lead to the official ending of the coolie trade in 1916 by the British government.

With women as a severe minority, their morality was questioned and the actions of men as a result of having so few women was blamed on the women. Between 1858 and 1859, laws were put into place stating that the ratio of men to women could not exceed 2:1, whereas before it was 3:1. However, there continued to be a severe shortage of women. This gave women a new sense of power when it came to choosing a partner. With a shortage of women, it became the responsibility of the male suitor to provide a hefty dowry to a woman's father, regardless of what caste she came from.<ref name=\":2\">Patricia Mohammd, \"Gender Negotiations Among Indians in Trinidad, 917-1947,\" in ''The Caribbean History Reader'', ed.

Rape was a common occurrence, and there were accounts of women being bound and gagged in their own home by men.

Many coolie women saw the chance to leave for the Caribbean as a way to escape abusive husbands, to hide pregnancy, to escape shame, or to simply find a better life. The 1883 Indian Immigration Act aimed to stop women from escaping their abusive husbands, which in turn made it much more difficult for women to emigrate.

2018 the H-Net Editors worked with the Home Office programmers to launch a new way for users to browse the H-Net Commons to find content of interest outside the networks to which they have subscribed. A hub allows scholars to be linked directly to a piece of content that is related to the topic but perhaps part of a network outside that scholar's field. A hub does not host its own content or discussions, but aggregates related content from across all of H-Net and provides a window into the particular network where the topic is being discussed. As of April 2020, the following hubs are offered for all to view and to which users can subscribe in order to get notifications via email of new content:\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/digital-humanities-hub Digital Humanities Hub]\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/gender-hub Gender Hub]\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/race-and-ethnicity-hub Race and Ethnicity Hub]\n\n===H-Net Crossroads===\nCrossroads networks serve as a collaboration between Network Editors on the H-Net Commons who choose to highlight content from across the H-Net Commons as well as to commission new content on a particular subject for a Crossroads network. As of April 2020, the following Crossroads networks are offered for viewing and/or subscription:\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/oah-annual-meeting-crossroads OAH Annual Meeting Crossroads]\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/world-cup-2014 World Cup 2014]\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/world-war-i-crossroads World War I Crossroads]\n\n===H-Announce===\nH-Announce is an academic announcement service housed on the H-Net Commons. Free of charge, any user with an account can submit an announcement as long as it is not a for-profit activity or a book announcement. To see the full H-Announce guidelines, visit here: https://networks.h-net.org/node/905/pages/73385/h-announce-users-guide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/node/905/pages/73385/h-announce-users-guide|title=H-Announce: A User's Guide {{!}} Help Desk {{!}} H-Net|website=networks.h-net.org|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> These announcements are moderated by trained H-Net staff and sent out via e-mail notifications. Digests are sent to network editors daily for reposting on their networks.\n\n===H-Net Book Channel===\nThe H-Net Book Channel is a new book discovery service which sorts new academic publications by category in a searchable format. Users can browse the new titles by category on the H-Net Book Channel Home Page: https://networks.h-net.org/h-net-book-channel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/h-net-book-channel|title=H-Net Book Channel {{!}} H-Net|website=networks.h-net.org|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> Users can also submit new book announcements with the \u201cUser Submissions\u201d form. You can find this form here: https://networks.h-net.org/book-channel-submission-form <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/book-channel-submission-form|title=Submit a Book Form|website=H-Net Commons}}</ref>\n\n== H-Net Reviews ==\n'''The H-Net Reviews''' program is one of the largest archives of academic reviews online. Over 48,800 reviews of academic titles and other publications have been commissioned, copy edited, and published on the Commons. All reviews are archived and can be searched by author, publisher, title, ISBN, LC card number, reviewer name, date of review, the network that commissioned the review, and keywords. Each published review is sent out to the subscriber base via e-mail notifications through H-Review as well as on the \u201cReviews Tab\u201d on the front page of the Commons.\n\nH-Net set out to create a reviews program that reached out to a wide variety of scholars to participate in conversations that, previously, has only been available to the elites of the profession. The earliest archived review on H-Net is on H-Law and was published in 1993. However, the reviews program was not regularly published until 1995. In 2003, the [[Library of Congress]] began linking H-Net Reviews to the records in the online catalog.<ref name=\":7\"/>\n\nIn a 2005 study comparing H-Net online reviews and print reviews conducted by Eileen L. McGrath, Winifred Fordham Metz, John B. Rutledge, they concluded that there are some significant differences between the demographics of reviews. With the print publications reviewers having a trend of higher education and experience in their fields. However, H-Net reviews still hold validity in the scholarly community and make participating in the field more accessible to younger and less seasoned scholars. In this study they found that there was no major difference between the harshness of the H-Net Reviewers and that of the ''[[Journal of Southern history|Journal of Southern History]]'' (JoSH) reviewers, and that the main difference between the two was the length of review. The H-Net reviewers tended to have reviews three times the length of the print reviews from the same field.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn 2008 the H-Net Reviews program underwent a major update including features such as a new status updating system for tracking where each title is in the reviews process and a multi-layered editing program including two layers of content and copy editing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\"Peter Knupfer|first=H.-Net\" <peter@MAIL H.-NET MSU EDU>|date=2008-10-03|title=From the Executive Director: H-Net's New Reviews Management System|url=https://lists.h-net.org/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx|journal=H-announce}}</ref>\n\n== H-Net Job Guide ==\n'''The H-Net Job Guide''' is an online based job board for academic job postings in the US and abroad. Increasingly, the Job Guide serves the non-academic world of non-profits, government, and NGOs, as well as for-profit companies seeking candidates with specialized training and experience. Jobs posted to the Job Guide are distributed to H-Net's active community of researchers, teachers, and scholarly professionals already collaborating through H-Net's 180+ public networks. Revenue from the H-Net Job Guide recovers the cost of all H-Net's services to the public and supports the work of hundreds of volunteer editors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.h-net.org/jobs/home.php|title=H-Net Job Guide|website=www.h-net.org|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref>\n\nFor job seekers, all listings in the Job Guide can be browsed by category along with a few filter options. The Job Guide originated with the majority of the listings being specifically for history, however as it developed over time it began posting a greater variety of social science positions such as: humanities computing, speech, rhetoric/composition, and business. More recently, the Job Guide has begun to incorporate more positions within administration fields and other vocations outside of academia.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n== Social Media ==\nH-Net Maintains an active social media presence across several platforms and many individual networks manage social media accounts specific to their fields of study.\n\nA selection of the individual networks also maintains social media accounts, the majority of these are involved with Twitter, however, a few have created Facebook pages.\n\n'''All Social Media Accounts'''\n\n[[Facebook]]: H-Net: Humanities and Social Sciences Online, https://www.facebook.com/humanities.socialsciences.online/\n\nMain Twitter: '''@'''HNet_Humanities, https://twitter.com/HNet_Humanities \u00a0\n\nH-Net Book Channel Twitter: '''@'''HNetBookChannel, https://twitter.com/HNetBookChannel\n\nH-Net Reviews Twitter: '''@'''HNet_Reviews, https://twitter.com/HNet_Reviews\n\nH-Net Job Guide Twitter: '''@'''HNetJobGuide, https://twitter.com/HNetJobGuide\n\n[[LinkedIn]]: H-Net: Humanities and Social Sciences Online https://www.linkedin.com/company/h-net-humanities-&-social-sciences-on-line\n\nAll H-Net social media accounts: https://networks.h-net.org/node/513/pages/132236/h-net-social-media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/node/513/pages/132236/h-net-social-media|title=H-Net Social Media {{!}} H-Net {{!}} H-Net|website=networks.h-net.org|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref>\n\n== H-Net 25 ==\nFounded in 1993, H-Net celebrated its 25th anniversary as an organization in 2018. This included a collection of campaigns across the website and social media all housed on the newly created H-Net 25 Crossroads network. Visit the crossroads here: <nowiki>https://networks.h-net.org/hnet25</nowiki>.<ref name=\":5\" /> On social media the hashtags used to organize content were #ThankYouHNet and #HNet25.\n\nFeatured on the crossroads is a timeline of the networks in the order they were founded, as well as an archival discussion logs project called \u201cMining the Logs,\u201d showcasing some of the more dynamic conversations from the original H-Net lists.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* Andrew McMichael, \"The Historian, the Internet, and the Web: A Reassessment,\" ''Perspectives: The Newsletter of the American Historical Association'', 36: 2 (Feb. 1998). https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/february-1998/the-historian-the-internet-and-the-web-a-reassessment\n*Brennan, Elaine. \u201cHistory Net Lists\u201d.

He was assisted by Wendy Plotkin (a graduate student at the University of Illinois) and James Mott (a PhD of the University of Illinois). H-Net began in the form of a [[LISTSERV]], users could subscribe to groups or \u201clists\u201d and receive notifications in their in-boxes. This platform connected scholars through their in-boxes and made use of the new uses of e-mail. \u00a0\n\nThe earliest lists included: H-Urban, H-Women, H-Holocaust, H-CivWar, H-Law, H-LatAm, H-South, H-Rural, H-Amstdy, H-Ethnic, H-Albion, H-Teach, H-Judaic, H-OIEAHC (later renamed H-Early-America), H-Film, H-Rhetor, H-Labor, and H-Pol.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/hnet25|title=H-Net 25th Anniversary Crossroads {{!}} H-Net|website=networks.h-net.org|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> The largest list at the time was HOLOCAUS (later renamed H-Holocaust), with 290 subscribers.\n\nIn 1994, H-Net created its first formal governance structure and elected an executive committee with Richard Jensen as the first Executive Director.

2018 the H-Net Editors worked with the Home Office programmers to launch a new way for users to browse the H-Net Commons to find content of interest outside the networks to which they have subscribed. A hub allows scholars to be linked directly to a piece of content that is related to the topic but perhaps part of a network outside that scholar's field. A hub does not host its own content or discussions, but aggregates related content from across all of H-Net and provides a window into the particular network where the topic is being discussed. As of April 2020, the following hubs are offered for all to view and to which users can subscribe in order to get notifications via email of new content:\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/digital-humanities-hub Digital Humanities Hub]\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/gender-hub Gender Hub]\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/race-and-ethnicity-hub Race and Ethnicity Hub]\n\n===H-Net Crossroads==\nCrossroads networks serve as a collaboration between Network Editors on the H-Net Commons who choose to highlight content from across the H-Net Commons as well as to commission new content on a particular subject for a Crossroads network. As of April 2020, the following Crossroads networks are offered for viewing and/or subscription:\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/oah-annual-meeting-crossroads OAH Annual Meeting Crossroads]\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/world-cup-2014 World Cup 2014]\n* [https://networks.h-net.org/world-war-i-crossroads World War I Crossroads]\n\n===H-Announce===\nH-Announce is an academic announcement service housed on the H-Net Commons. Free of charge, any user with an account can submit an announcement as long as it is not a for-profit activity or a book announcement. To see the full H-Announce guidelines, visit here: https://networks.h-net.org/node/905/pages/73385/h-announce-users-guide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/node/905/pages/73385/h-announce-users-guide|title=H-Announce: A User's Guide {{!}} Help Desk {{!}} H-Net|website=networks.h-net.org|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> These announcements are moderated by trained H-Net staff and sent out via e-mail notifications. Digests are sent to network editors daily for reposting on their networks.\n\n===H-Net Book Channel===\nThe H-Net Book Channel is a new book discovery service which sorts new academic publications by category in a searchable format. Users can browse the new titles by category on the H-Net Book Channel Home Page: https://networks.h-net.org/h-net-book-channel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/h-net-book-channel|title=H-Net Book Channel {{!}} H-Net|website=networks.h-net.org|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> Users can also submit new book announcements with the \u201cUser Submissions\u201d form. You can find this form here: https://networks.h-net.org/book-channel-submission-form <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/book-channel-submission-form|title=Submit a Book Form|website=H-Net Commons}}</ref>\n\n== H-Net Reviews ==\n'''The H-Net Reviews''' program is one of the largest archives of academic reviews online. Over 48,800 reviews of academic titles and other publications have been commissioned, copy edited, and published on the Commons. All reviews are archived and can be searched by author, publisher, title, ISBN, LC card number, reviewer name, date of review, the network that commissioned the review, and keywords. Each published review is sent out to the subscriber base via e-mail notifications through H-Review as well as on the \u201cReviews Tab\u201d on the front page of the Commons.\n\nH-Net set out to create a reviews program that reached out to a wide variety of scholars to participate in conversations that, previously, has only been available to the elites of the profession. The earliest archived review on H-Net is on H-Law and was published in 1993. However, the reviews program was not regularly published until 1995. In 2003, the [[Library of Congress]] began linking H-Net Reviews to the records in the online catalog.<ref name=\":7\"/>\n\nIn a 2005 study comparing H-Net online reviews and print reviews conducted by Eileen L. McGrath, Winifred Fordham Metz, John B. Rutledge, they concluded that there are some significant differences between the demographics of reviews. With the print publications reviewers having a trend of higher education and experience in their fields. However, H-Net reviews still hold validity in the scholarly community and make participating in the field more accessible to younger and less seasoned scholars. In this study they found that there was no major difference between the harshness of the H-Net Reviewers and that of the ''[[Journal of Southern history|Journal of Southern History]]'' (JoSH) reviewers, and that the main difference between the two was the length of review. The H-Net reviewers tended to have reviews three times the length of the print reviews from the same field.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn 2008 the H-Net Reviews program underwent a major update including features such as a new status updating system for tracking where each title is in the reviews process and a multi-layered editing program including two layers of content and copy editing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\"Peter Knupfer|first=H.-Net\" <peter@MAIL H.-NET MSU EDU>|date=2008-10-03|title=From the Executive Director: H-Net's New Reviews Management System|url=https://lists.h-net.org/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx|journal=H-announce}}</ref>\n\n== H-Net Job Guide ==\n'''The H-Net Job Guide''' is an online based job board for academic job postings in the US and abroad. Increasingly, the Job Guide serves the non-academic world of non-profits, government, and NGOs, as well as for-profit companies seeking candidates with specialized training and experience. Jobs posted to the Job Guide are distributed to H-Net's active community of researchers, teachers, and scholarly professionals already collaborating through H-Net's 180+ public networks. Revenue from the H-Net Job Guide recovers the cost of all H-Net's services to the public and supports the work of hundreds of volunteer editors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.h-net.org/jobs/home.php|title=H-Net Job Guide|website=www.h-net.org|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref>\n\nFor job seekers, all listings in the Job Guide can be browsed by category along with a few filter options. The Job Guide originated with the majority of the listings being specifically for history, however as it developed over time it began posting a greater variety of social science positions such as: humanities computing, speech, rhetoric/composition, and business. More recently, the Job Guide has begun to incorporate more positions within administration fields and other vocations outside of academia.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n== Social Media ==\nH-Net Maintains an active social media presence across several platforms and many individual networks manage social media accounts specific to their fields of study.\n\nA selection of the individual networks also maintains social media accounts, the majority of these are involved with Twitter, however, a few have created Facebook pages.\n\n'''All Social Media Accounts'''\n\n[[Facebook]]: H-Net: Humanities and Social Sciences Online, https://www.facebook.com/humanities.socialsciences.online/\n\nMain Twitter: '''@'''HNet_Humanities, https://twitter.com/HNet_Humanities \u00a0\n\nH-Net Book Channel Twitter: '''@'''HNetBookChannel, https://twitter.com/HNetBookChannel\n\nH-Net Reviews Twitter: '''@'''HNet_Reviews, https://twitter.com/HNet_Reviews\n\nH-Net Job Guide Twitter: '''@'''HNetJobGuide, https://twitter.com/HNetJobGuide\n\n[[LinkedIn]]: H-Net: Humanities and Social Sciences Online https://www.linkedin.com/company/h-net-humanities-&-social-sciences-on-line\n\nAll H-Net social media accounts: https://networks.h-net.org/node/513/pages/132236/h-net-social-media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/node/513/pages/132236/h-net-social-media|title=H-Net Social Media {{!}} H-Net {{!}} H-Net|website=networks.h-net.org|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref>\n\n== H-Net 25 ==\nFounded in 1993, H-Net celebrated its 25th anniversary as an organization in 2018.

It is coordinated by the [[Multi-State Lottery Association]] (MUSL), a [[nonprofit organization]] formed by an agreement with US lotteries. Powerball's minimum advertised jackpot is $40 million (annuity); Powerball's annuity is paid in 30 [[graduated payments|graduated installments]] or winners may choose a lump sum payment instead. One lump sum payment will be less than the total of the 30 annual payments because of the [[time value of money]] and also because one check for a much larger sum will be taxed at a greater rate than 30 checks each at a much lower sum will be taxed.\n\nDrawings for Powerball are held every Wednesday and Saturday evening at 10:59 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. Since October 7, 2015, the game has used a 5/69 (white balls) + 1/26 (Powerballs) matrix from which winning numbers are chosen, resulting in odds of 1 in 292,201,338 of winning a jackpot per play.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/01/13/how-powerball-manipulated-the-odds-to-make-a-1-5-billion-jackpot-happen |title=How Powerball manipulated the odds to create a $1.5864 billion jackpot |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 13, 2016}}</ref> Each play costs $2 or $3 with the ''Power Play'' option.

The game, and name, were changed to Powerball on April 19, 1992; its first drawing was held April 22.\n\n=== Powerball begins ===\nWhen it was launched in 1992 Powerball became the first game to use two drums. Using two drums to draw numbers from offers more manipulation by simultaneously allowing high jackpot odds, numerous prize levels and low overall odds of winning (as explained later, a ticket can win by matching only one number). The two-drum concept was suggested by Steve Caputo of the Oregon Lottery. The two-drum concept has since been used by ''The Big Game'' (now [[Mega Millions]]) in the US, [[Powerball (Australia)|Australia's Powerball]], [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|Thunderball]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Eurojackpot]] and [[EuroMillions]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThrough 2008, Powerball drawings usually were held at Screenscape Studios in [[West Des Moines, Iowa]]. The drawings' host was longtime Iowa radio personality Mike Pace, who had hosted MUSL drawings since Lotto America began in 1988. In 1996, Powerball went \"on the road\" for the first time, holding five remote drawings at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Atlanta. A few weeks later, Georgia became the only jurisdiction to leave Powerball (Maine, which joined MUSL in 1990, left when Powerball began). In August 1996, Georgia joined the then-new ''The Big Game'', then the other major U.S. lottery group. It planned to sell tickets for ''both'' games for the rest of 1996; but within days Georgia was removed from MUSL, not to return until the 2010 cross-sell expansion.\n\nOn November 2, 1997, the [[Annuity (American)|annuity]] was changed from 20 to 25 yearly payments; the cash option was added.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |title=History |publisher=Powerball |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201013549/http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |archive-date=2018-02-01 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The annuity comprises 30 graduated payments, increasing 5% annually.\n\nIn 1998, [[Florida Lottery|Florida]] was given permission by its government to participate in a multi-state game. It was set to offer Powerball; but in early 1999, new governor [[Jeb Bush]] prevented Florida from joining since he believed Powerball would hurt the existing Florida Lottery games. In 2008, Governor [[Charlie Crist]] finally allowed Florida to join MUSL, on Jan 4, 2009.\n\nOn March 7, 2001, an optional multiplier (called ''Power Play'') was added, allowing players to multiply non-jackpot winnings by up to five by paying an extra $1 per game. A wheel was introduced to select the ''Power Play'' multiplier for each drawing (the next year, the ''1x'' was removed from the ''Power Play'' wheel.)\n\n=== 2009: Florida became host to drawings ===\nWith the start of Powerball sales in Florida on January 4, 2009 (with its first drawing on January 7), the matrices changed to 5/59 + 1/39 (adding four white ball numbers and dropping three red balls). This changed the jackpot probability from 1:146 million to 1:195 million; the overall probability became 1:35.\n\nBased on statistical projections, the average jackpot win increased from $95 million to $141 million. Over 3.5 million additional prizes were expected to be won yearly due to the change in probability. The starting jackpot increased to $20 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The jackpot contribution increased from 30.3% to 32.5% of total sales. The Power Play option was modified; second prize, usually $200,000, was given an automatic 5x multiplier, making the 5+0 prize $1 million cash. The bonus second prize if the jackpot exceeded its previous record by $25 million, triggered only twice, was eliminated with the 2012 format change.\n\nThe conditions for Florida joining Powerball included a move of the live drawings from Iowa to [[Universal Studios Florida|Universal Studios]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The three hosts rotating announcing duties from Universal Studios were Tracy Wiu, Elizabeth Hart and Scott Adams (MUSL headquarters remained in Iowa, where its other draws are held). The wheel that was used to determine the Power Play multiplier was retired when the drawings moved to Florida; a [[Random number generation|random number generator]] (RNG) was used until the 2012 format change.\n\n[[Arkansas Scholarship Lottery|Arkansas]] became the 33rd MUSL member on October 31, 2009,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arkansasmatters.com/content/news/Lottery_Fulltext?cid=258812 |accessdate=2016-02-09 |df=mdy-all }}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> the last to join before the 2010 cross-sell expansion. The Ohio Lottery added Powerball on April 16, 2010, it joined [[Mega Millions]] (along with New York) years earlier, when ''The Big Game'' added ''Mega Millions'' to its name.\n\n=== 2010 cross-sell expansion ===\nIn March 2009, it was reported that [[New Jersey]], already a Mega Millions member, sought permission to join Powerball. Shortly after, discussions were revealed about allowing each US lottery to offer both games. On October 13, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |title=Mega Millions Official Home |publisher=Megamillions.com |date=October 13, 2009 |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714070121/http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> In November, MUSL signed an agreement to start streaming Powerball drawings online.<ref>[http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 \"Powerball Lottery Drawings to Be Available Live on the Internet\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101103/http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 |date=March 4, 2016 }}, TransWorldNews, November 9, 2009.

The U.S. Virgin Islands joined Mega Millions in October 2010.\n\nBefore the agreement, the only places that sold both Mega Millions and Powerball tickets were retailers straddling a border; one retailer on the [[Sharon, Pennsylvania]]/[[Masury, Ohio]] border sold both Mega Millions (via the [[Ohio Lottery]]) and Powerball ([[Pennsylvania]]) before the agreement and continued to be the only retailer to sell tickets for both lotteries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://local.post-gazette.com/penn+ohio+lottery+and+deli.9.118177023p.home.html |title=Penn Ohio Lottery & Deli in Sharon, PA 16146 |publisher=Local.post-gazette.com |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203254/http://local.post-gazette.com/penn+ohio+lottery+and+deli.9.118177023p.home.html |archivedate=October 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Illinois]] joining Powerball on the expansion date, it became the second multi-jurisdictional lottery game (after Mega Millions, which Illinois already participated in) whose drawings were carried nationally. Both games' drawings were simulcast via [[Chicago]] cable [[superstation]] [[WGN-TV]] through its national [[WGN America]] feed. WGN-TV aired Illinois Lottery drawings nationally from 1992 to 2015 after acquiring broadcast rights from Chicago's Fox [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WFLD]] in 1988, which took the rights from WGN-TV in 1987. Powerball drawings were aired on WGN-TV and WGN America on Wednesday and Saturday immediately following the station's 9:00 p.m. ([[Central Time Zone|Central Time]]) newscast with the Mega Millions drawings being aired Tue and Fri evenings after the newscast. WGN served as a default carrier of Mega Millions or Powerball where no local television station carries either multi-jurisdictional lottery's drawings.\n\nOn March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first previous Mega Millions-only member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Powerball ticket. It was worth over $211 million in annuity payments; it was sold in [[Morris Plains, New Jersey|Morris Plains]]. On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first previous MUSL member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket; that jackpot was $12 million (annuity).\n\nOn June 2, 2010, Ohio won a Powerball jackpot; it became the first lottery selling ''either'' Mega Millions ''or'' Powerball (when 2010 began) to provide a jackpot-winning ticket for its newer game. The ticket was worth a $261 million annuity; it was sold in [[Sunbury, Ohio|Sunbury]]. Ohio's second Powerball jackpot-winning ticket, sold for the June 23, 2010 drawing, was part of another first; since Montana also provided a jackpot winner for that drawing, it was the first time a jackpot was shared through lotteries which sold competing games before the cross-selling expansion, as Montana sold only Powerball before the expansion date.\n\n=== 2012 format change ===\nOn January 15, 2012, the price of each basic Powerball play doubled to $2, while PowerPlay games became $3; the minimum jackpot doubled to $40 million.<ref name=\"worldlottery\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|title=Powerball Lottery Changes for 2012|author=Lotto, Lucy|date=June 30, 2011|publisher=WorldLottery.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823062810/http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|archivedate=August 23, 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=September 4, 2013|quote=The first and biggest change to the Powerball Lottery is the introduction of the $40 million base jackpot.

In each game, players select five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and one number from 26 red Powerballs; the red ball number can be the same as one of the white balls. The drawing order of the five white balls is irrelevant; all tickets show the white ball numbers in ascending order. Players cannot use the drawn Powerball to match two of their white numbers, or vice versa. Players can select their own numbers, or have the terminal [[Pseudorandomness|pseudorandomly]] select the numbers (called \"quick pick\", \"easy pick\", etc.).\n\nIn each drawing, winning numbers are selected using two ball machines: one containing the white balls and the other containing the red Powerballs. Five white balls are drawn from the first machine and the red ball from the second machine. Games matching at least three white balls or the red Powerball win.\n\nTwo identical machines are used for each drawing, randomly selected from four sets. The model of machine used is the Halogen, manufactured by Smartplay International of [[Edgewater Park, New Jersey]]. There are eight ball sets (four of each color); one set of each color is randomly selected before a drawing. The balls are mixed by a turntable at the bottom of the machine that propels the balls around the chamber. When the machine selects a ball, the turntable slows to catch it, sends it up the shaft, and then down the rail to the display. (The Florida Lottery is considering switching to a [[random number generator]] in 2019 for its in-state drawings; it is unknown whether Powerball would be affected.) If the onsite location is unavailable, as was the case during [[Hurricane Michael]], a backup machine is located at MUSL headquarters in Iowa.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/10/10/hurricane-michael-ran-million-powerball-drawing-out-town</ref>\n\nThe double matrices and probabilities in the game's history:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Starting date\n!Pick 5 White Balls from Field of\n!Pick 1 Red Ball from Field of\n!Jackpot chance\n!''Power Play'' multiplier\n|-\n|April 22, 1992\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:54,979,154\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\u2020\n|-\n|November 5, 1997\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|49\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:80,089,127\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\u2020\n|-\n|March 7, 2001\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|49\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:80,089,127\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1x-5x\n|-\n|October 9, 2002\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|53\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:120,526,769\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|August 28, 2005\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|55\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:146,107,961\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|January 7, 2009\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|39\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:195,249,054\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|January 15, 2012\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:175,223,510\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\n|-\n|January 19, 2014\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:175,223,510\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|October 7, 2015 <ref name=\"cnbc2015\">[https://nddb.coop/ccnddb/1024 Odds are, you won't like this Powerball story]{{Retrieved | accessdate=2015-07-09}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|69\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:292,201,338\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x; 10x\u2021\n|}\n\n\u2020''Power Play'' was introduced in 2001.<br />\n\u202110\u00d7 available if jackpot is under $150 million.<ref name=LotteryWorld2015/>\n\nWhile Mega Millions and Powerball each have similar jackpot odds despite having a different double matrix (Mega Millions is 5/75&nbsp;+&nbsp;1/15), since Powerball is $2 per play, it now takes $584,402,676 (not counting Power Play side bets) on average to produce a jackpot-winning ticket.\n\n=== Power Play ===\nFor an additional $1 per game, a player may activate the Power Play option. Activating it multiplies lower-tier winnings (base prize $50,000 or less) by up to 5, or 10 when the jackpot is under $150 million. Power Play is drawn separately from the 6 numbers. The 5+0 prize is automatically doubled to $2 million if Power Play is activated.\n\nThe dilemma for players is whether to maximize the chance at the jackpot or increase lower-tier winnings. If a player selects a fixed amount of money to spend on tickets at a certain time, the player will give up one guess of the winning set of numbers every two times this player activates Power Play in respect of one of the purchased tickets.\n\nPower Play, when it began in 2001, was drawn with a special wheel. In 2006 and 2007, MUSL replaced one of the 5\u00d7 spaces on the Power Play wheel with a 10\u00d7. During each month-long promotion, MUSL guaranteed that there would be at least one drawing with a 10\u00d7 multiplier. The promotion returned in 2008; the ball landed in the 10\u00d7 space twice. After being absent in 2009, the 10\u00d7 multiplier returned in May 2010 (after the Power Play drawing was changed to RNG.) The promotion was extended for the only time, as the 10\u00d7 multiplier was not drawn until June 12, 2010. The second prize 5\u00d7 guarantee continued; the 10\u00d7 applied to all non-jackpot prizes, as in previous promotions.\n\nPower Play's success has led to similar multipliers in other games, most notably ''Megaplier'', available through all [[Mega Millions]] members except California. The 2012 Powerball changes resulted in all eight lower-tier levels having \"fixed\" Power Play prizes.<ref name=\"Changes Coming to Powerball\">{{cite web |url=http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |title=Changes Coming to Powerball... |publisher=Multi-State Lottery Association |accessdate=January 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123094841/http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |archivedate=January 23, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nOn January 19, 2014, PowerPlay was modified; it used 30 balls with the following distribution:\n*2x (15)\n*3x (9)\n*4x/5x: 3 each\n\nOn October 4, 2015, PowerPlay changed again, using 42 or 43\u2020 balls as follows:\n*2x (24)\n*3x (13)\n*4x (3)\n*5x (2)\n*10x (1)\u2020\n\n\u2020 10x available when jackpot is under $150 million.\n\n=== Prizes and odds ===\n\nPayouts as of October 7, 2015:<ref>{{cite web |title=NEW YORK STATE GAMING COMMISSION AMENDMENT OF SECTIONS 5004.9, 5007.2, 5007.13, 5007.15, 5007.16, 5009.2 and 5010.2 OF NEW YORK CODES, RULES AND REGULATIONS TITLE 9, SUBTITLE T, CHAPTER III, SUBCHAPTER A |url=http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |website=New York State Gaming Commission |publisher=New York State Gaming Commission |accessdate=2015-08-02 |page=4 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824015916/http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=3\n|-\n!Matches\n!Prize{{efn|name=cal|California's prize amounts are always parimutuel because its [[California Penal Code|state penal code]] distinguishes between a \"lottery\" which cannot be broken and a \"banked game\" whose [[Breaking the bank|bank theoretically could be broken]].

Each annuity payment is 5% higher than in the previous year to adjust for inflation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.powerball.com/powerball/pb_howtoplay.asp |title=Powerball - How To Play |publisher=Powerball.com |accessdate=January 12, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115222858/http://www.powerball.com/powerball/pb_howtoplay.asp |archive-date=January 15, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe advertised estimated jackpot represents the total payments that would be paid to jackpot winner(s) should they accept the annuity option. This estimate is based on the funds accumulated in the jackpot pool rolled over from prior drawings, expected sales for the next drawing, and market interest rates for the securities that would be used to fund the annuity.<ref name=\"powerball.com\" /> The estimated jackpot usually is 32.5% of the (non-''Power Play'') revenue of each base ($1) play, submitted by game members to accumulate into a prize pool to fund the jackpot. If the jackpot is not won in a particular drawing, the prize pool carries over to the next drawing, accumulating until there is a jackpot winner. This prize pool is the cash that is paid to a jackpot winner if they choose cash. If the winner chooses the annuity, current market rates are used to calculate the graduated payment schedule and the initial installment is paid. The remaining funds in the prize pool are invested to generate the income required to fund the remaining installments. If there are multiple jackpot winners for a drawing, the jackpot prize pool is divided equally for all such plays.\n\nMUSL and its members accept all investment risk and are contractually obligated and liable to the winner to make all scheduled payments to annuity winners. If a jackpot ticket is not claimed, the funds in the prize pool are returned to members in proportion to the amount they contributed to the prize pool. The members have different rules regulating how unclaimed funds are used.<ref name=\"powerball.com\"/>\n\nWhen the Powerball jackpot is won, the next jackpot is guaranteed to be $40 million (annuity). If a jackpot is not won, the minimum rollover is $10 million. The cash in the jackpot pool is guaranteed to be the current value of the annuity. If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations, game members must contribute additional funds to the jackpot pool to cover the shortage; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the jackpot is won in consecutive drawings.\n\nBecause of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]] and resulting drop in ticket sales plus the falling interest rates on which annuity prizes were based, Powerball administrators reduced the minimum starting jackpot to $20 million, and the minimum increase to $2 million when the previous jackpot is not won.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Leggate |first1=Jim |title=Powerball cuts jackpot amounts amid coronavirus sales drop |url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/powerball-cuts-jackpot-amounts-amid-coronavirus-sales-drop |accessdate=13 April 2020 |publisher=Fox Business |date=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Claiming prizes ===\n\nA winning ticket must be claimed in the jurisdiction in which it was purchased, regardless of residence. The minimum age to play Powerball is 18, except in Nebraska (19), and Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana and Mississippi (21).\n\nGenerally, Powerball players do not have to choose cash or annuity unless they win a jackpot (then they usually have 60 days to choose). Exceptions include [[Florida]] and [[Missouri]]; the 60-day \"[[clock]]\" starts with the drawing, so a [[Progressive jackpot|jackpot]] winner who wishes to take the cash option needs to make immediate plans to claim their prize. [[New Jersey]] and [[Texas]] require the cash/annuity choice to be made when ''playing''; in New Jersey, an annuity ticket can be changed to cash after winning, while in Texas, the choice is binding. (When the cash option was introduced in 1997, all Powerball players had to make the choice when playing. This regulation was phased out by 1999.) All Powerball prizes must be claimed within a period ranging from 90 days to a year, depending on where the ticket was bought.\n\nPowerball winnings in [[California]] are subject to [[Income tax in the United States#Federal income tax rates for individuals|Federal income tax]] only. There is no state income tax in [[Florida]], [[South Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Wyoming]], and only on interest and dividends in [[Tennessee]] and [[New Hampshire]]. Winnings from tickets purchased outside of one's home state may be subject to the income tax laws of ''both'' states (with possible credit based on the two jurisdictions.)\n\n=== Secondary prizes ===\nUnlike the jackpot pool, other prizes are the responsibility and liability of each participating lottery. All revenue for Powerball ticket sales not used for jackpots is retained by each member; none of this revenue is shared with other lotteries. Members are liable only for the payment of secondary prizes sold there.\n\nSince the secondary prizes are defined in fixed amounts (except in California), if the liability for a given prize level exceed the funds in the prize pool for that level the amount of the prize may be reduced and the prize pool be distributed on a parimutuel basis and result in a prize lower than the fixed amounts given in the prize tables.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://floridalottery.com/powerball |title=Powerball |publisher=Floridalottery.com |date=January 18, 2016 |accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref> Because the secondary prize pools are calculated independently, it is possible lower-tier prizes will differ among the game members.\n\n=== Notable wins ===\n{{Main article|Lottery jackpot records#United States}}\nBecause the quoted jackpot amount is an annuity of 30 graduated annual payments, its cash value relative to the annuity fluctuates. The actual ratio depends on projected interest rates and other factors. MUSL starts with the cash value, built from a percentage of sales, and then calculates the advertised jackpot amount from that value, based on the average costs of the three best securities bids.<ref>[http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp \"Why Has the Cash Jackpot Gone Down?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806042548/http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp |date=August 6, 2015 }} Powerball Frequently Asked Questions.</ref>\n\nOn March 27, 2019, a single ticket purchased in [[Wisconsin]] was the only winner of a $768.4 million ($477 million cash) Powerball jackpot, the third largest in U.S. lottery history.

It is coordinated by the [[Multi-State Lottery Association]] (MUSL), a [[nonprofit organization]] formed by an agreement with US lotteries. Powerball's minimum advertised jackpot is $40 million (annuity); Powerball's annuity is paid in 30 [[graduated payments|graduated installments]] or winners may choose a lump sum payment instead. One lump sum payment will be less than the total of the 30 annual payments because of the [[time value of money]] and also because one check for a much larger sum will be taxed at a greater rate than 30 checks each at a much lower sum will be taxed.\n\nDrawings for Powerball are held every Wednesday and Saturday evening at 10:59 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. Since October 7, 2015, the game has used a 5/69 (white balls) + 1/26 (Powerballs) matrix from which winning numbers are chosen, resulting in odds of 1 in 292,201,338 of winning a jackpot per play.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/01/13/how-powerball-manipulated-the-odds-to-make-a-1-5-billion-jackpot-happen |title=How Powerball manipulated the odds to create a $1.5864 billion jackpot |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 13, 2016}}</ref> Each play costs $2 or $3 with the ''Power Play'' option.

The game, and name, were changed to Powerball on April 19, 1992; its first drawing was held April 22.\n\n=== Powerball begins ===\nWhen it was launched in 1992 Powerball became the first game to use two drums. Using two drums to draw numbers from offers more manipulation by simultaneously allowing high jackpot odds, numerous prize levels and low overall odds of winning (as explained later, a ticket can win by matching only one number). The two-drum concept was suggested by Steve Caputo of the Oregon Lottery. The two-drum concept has since been used by ''The Big Game'' (now [[Mega Millions]]) in the US, [[Powerball (Australia)|Australia's Powerball]], [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|Thunderball]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Eurojackpot]] and [[EuroMillions]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThrough 2008, Powerball drawings usually were held at Screenscape Studios in [[West Des Moines, Iowa]]. The drawings' host was longtime Iowa radio personality Mike Pace, who had hosted MUSL drawings since Lotto America began in 1988. In 1996, Powerball went \"on the road\" for the first time, holding five remote drawings at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Atlanta. A few weeks later, Georgia became the only jurisdiction to leave Powerball (Maine, which joined MUSL in 1990, left when Powerball began). In August 1996, Georgia joined the then-new ''The Big Game'', then the other major U.S. lottery group. It planned to sell tickets for ''both'' games for the rest of 1996; but within days Georgia was removed from MUSL, not to return until the 2010 cross-sell expansion.\n\nOn November 2, 1997, the [[Annuity (American)|annuity]] was changed from 20 to 25 yearly payments; the cash option was added.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |title=History |publisher=Powerball |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201013549/http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |archive-date=2018-02-01 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The annuity comprises 30 graduated payments, increasing 5% annually.\n\nIn 1998, [[Florida Lottery|Florida]] was given permission by its government to participate in a multi-state game. It was set to offer Powerball; but in early 1999, new governor [[Jeb Bush]] prevented Florida from joining since he believed Powerball would hurt the existing Florida Lottery games. In 2008, Governor [[Charlie Crist]] finally allowed Florida to join MUSL, on Jan 4, 2009.\n\nOn March 7, 2001, an optional multiplier (called ''Power Play'') was added, allowing players to multiply non-jackpot winnings by up to five by paying an extra $1 per game. A wheel was introduced to select the ''Power Play'' multiplier for each drawing (the next year, the ''1x'' was removed from the ''Power Play'' wheel.)\n\n=== 2009: Florida became host to drawings ===\nWith the start of Powerball sales in Florida on January 4, 2009 (with its first drawing on January 7), the matrices changed to 5/59 + 1/39 (adding four white ball numbers and dropping three red balls). This changed the jackpot probability from 1:146 million to 1:195 million; the overall probability became 1:35.\n\nBased on statistical projections, the average jackpot win increased from $95 million to $141 million. Over 3.5 million additional prizes were expected to be won yearly due to the change in probability. The starting jackpot increased to $20 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The jackpot contribution increased from 30.3% to 32.5% of total sales. The Power Play option was modified; second prize, usually $200,000, was given an automatic 5x multiplier, making the 5+0 prize $1 million cash. The bonus second prize if the jackpot exceeded its previous record by $25 million, triggered only twice, was eliminated with the 2012 format change.\n\nThe conditions for Florida joining Powerball included a move of the live drawings from Iowa to [[Universal Studios Florida|Universal Studios]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The three hosts rotating announcing duties from Universal Studios were Tracy Wiu, Elizabeth Hart and Scott Adams (MUSL headquarters remained in Iowa, where its other draws are held). The wheel that was used to determine the Power Play multiplier was retired when the drawings moved to Florida; a [[Random number generation|random number generator]] (RNG) was used until the 2012 format change.\n\n[[Arkansas Scholarship Lottery|Arkansas]] became the 33rd MUSL member on October 31, 2009,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arkansasmatters.com/content/news/Lottery_Fulltext?cid=258812 |accessdate=2016-02-09 |df=mdy-all }}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> the last to join before the 2010 cross-sell expansion.

Shortly after, discussions were revealed about allowing each US lottery to offer both games. On October 13, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |title=Mega Millions Official Home |publisher=Megamillions.com |date=October 13, 2009 |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714070121/http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> In November, MUSL signed an agreement to start streaming Powerball drawings online.<ref>[http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 \"Powerball Lottery Drawings to Be Available Live on the Internet\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101103/http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 |date=March 4, 2016 }}, TransWorldNews, November 9, 2009.

Both games' drawings were simulcast via [[Chicago]] cable [[superstation]] [[WGN-TV]] through its national [[WGN America]] feed. WGN-TV aired Illinois Lottery drawings nationally from 1992 to 2015 after acquiring broadcast rights from Chicago's Fox [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WFLD]] in 1988, which took the rights from WGN-TV in 1987. Powerball drawings were aired on WGN-TV and WGN America on Wednesday and Saturday immediately following the station's 9:00 p.m. ([[Central Time Zone|Central Time]]) newscast with the Mega Millions drawings being aired Tue and Fri evenings after the newscast. WGN served as a default carrier of Mega Millions or Powerball where no local television station carries either multi-jurisdictional lottery's drawings.\n\nOn March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first previous Mega Millions-only member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Powerball ticket. It was worth over $211 million in annuity payments; it was sold in [[Morris Plains, New Jersey|Morris Plains]]. On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first previous MUSL member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket; that jackpot was $12 million (annuity).\n\nOn June 2, 2010, Ohio won a Powerball jackpot; it became the first lottery selling ''either'' Mega Millions ''or'' Powerball (when 2010 began) to provide a jackpot-winning ticket for its newer game. The ticket was worth a $261 million annuity; it was sold in [[Sunbury, Ohio|Sunbury]]. Ohio's second Powerball jackpot-winning ticket, sold for the June 23, 2010 drawing, was part of another first; since Montana also provided a jackpot winner for that drawing, it was the first time a jackpot was shared through lotteries which sold competing games before the cross-selling expansion, as Montana sold only Powerball before the expansion date.\n\n=== 2012 format change ===\nOn January 15, 2012, the price of each basic Powerball play doubled to $2, while PowerPlay games became $3; the minimum jackpot doubled to $40 million.<ref name=\"worldlottery\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|title=Powerball Lottery Changes for 2012|author=Lotto, Lucy|date=June 30, 2011|publisher=WorldLottery.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823062810/http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|archivedate=August 23, 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=September 4, 2013|quote=The first and biggest change to the Powerball Lottery is the introduction of the $40 million base jackpot.

This response is regarding the Corona Virus issue. <ref>{{cite web |title=POWERBALL 2020 changes |url=https://www.powerball.com/notice |website=Important Notice |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> Since there was a Powerball Jackpot winner that matched all 5 numbers 48, 54, 39, 2, 37 and the Powerball Number 5 in New Jersey on Wednesday April 8, 2020, then this game had to reset to $20 million dollars!\n\n=== Playing the game ===\n=== Basic game ===\nThe minimum Powerball bet is $2. In each game, players select five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and one number from 26 red Powerballs; the red ball number can be the same as one of the white balls. The drawing order of the five white balls is irrelevant; all tickets show the white ball numbers in ascending order. Players cannot use the drawn Powerball to match two of their white numbers, or vice versa. Players can select their own numbers, or have the terminal [[Pseudorandomness|pseudorandomly]] select the numbers (called \"quick pick\", \"easy pick\", etc.).\n\nIn each drawing, winning numbers are selected using two ball machines: one containing the white balls and the other containing the red Powerballs. Five white balls are drawn from the first machine and the red ball from the second machine. Games matching at least three white balls or the red Powerball win.\n\nTwo identical machines are used for each drawing, randomly selected from four sets. The model of machine used is the Halogen, manufactured by Smartplay International of [[Edgewater Park, New Jersey]]. There are eight ball sets (four of each color); one set of each color is randomly selected before a drawing. The balls are mixed by a turntable at the bottom of the machine that propels the balls around the chamber. When the machine selects a ball, the turntable slows to catch it, sends it up the shaft, and then down the rail to the display. (The Florida Lottery is considering switching to a [[random number generator]] in 2019 for its in-state drawings; it is unknown whether Powerball would be affected.) If the onsite location is unavailable, as was the case during [[Hurricane Michael]], a backup machine is located at MUSL headquarters in Iowa.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/10/10/hurricane-michael-ran-million-powerball-drawing-out-town</ref>\n\nThe double matrices and probabilities in the game's history:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Starting date\n!Pick 5 White Balls from Field of\n!Pick 1 Red Ball from Field of\n!Jackpot chance\n!''Power Play'' multiplier\n|-\n|April 22, 1992\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:54,979,154\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\u2020\n|-\n|November 5, 1997\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|49\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:80,089,127\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\u2020\n|-\n|March 7, 2001\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|49\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:80,089,127\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1x-5x\n|-\n|October 9, 2002\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|53\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:120,526,769\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|August 28, 2005\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|55\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:146,107,961\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|January 7, 2009\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|39\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:195,249,054\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|January 15, 2012\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:175,223,510\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\n|-\n|January 19, 2014\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:175,223,510\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|October 7, 2015 <ref name=\"cnbc2015\">[https://nddb.coop/ccnddb/1024 Odds are, you won't like this Powerball story]{{Retrieved | accessdate=2015-07-09}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|69\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:292,201,338\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x; 10x\u2021\n|}\n\n\u2020''Power Play'' was introduced in 2001.<br />\n\u202110\u00d7 available if jackpot is under $150 million.<ref name=LotteryWorld2015/>\n\nWhile Mega Millions and Powerball each have similar jackpot odds despite having a different double matrix (Mega Millions is 5/75&nbsp;+&nbsp;1/15), since Powerball is $2 per play, it now takes $584,402,676 (not counting Power Play side bets) on average to produce a jackpot-winning ticket.\n\n=== Power Play ===\nFor an additional $1 per game, a player may activate the Power Play option. Activating it multiplies lower-tier winnings (base prize $50,000 or less) by up to 5, or 10 when the jackpot is under $150 million. Power Play is drawn separately from the 6 numbers. The 5+0 prize is automatically doubled to $2 million if Power Play is activated.\n\nThe dilemma for players is whether to maximize the chance at the jackpot or increase lower-tier winnings. If a player selects a fixed amount of money to spend on tickets at a certain time, the player will give up one guess of the winning set of numbers every two times this player activates Power Play in respect of one of the purchased tickets.\n\nPower Play, when it began in 2001, was drawn with a special wheel. In 2006 and 2007, MUSL replaced one of the 5\u00d7 spaces on the Power Play wheel with a 10\u00d7. During each month-long promotion, MUSL guaranteed that there would be at least one drawing with a 10\u00d7 multiplier. The promotion returned in 2008; the ball landed in the 10\u00d7 space twice. After being absent in 2009, the 10\u00d7 multiplier returned in May 2010 (after the Power Play drawing was changed to RNG.) The promotion was extended for the only time, as the 10\u00d7 multiplier was not drawn until June 12, 2010. The second prize 5\u00d7 guarantee continued; the 10\u00d7 applied to all non-jackpot prizes, as in previous promotions.\n\nPower Play's success has led to similar multipliers in other games, most notably ''Megaplier'', available through all [[Mega Millions]] members except California. The 2012 Powerball changes resulted in all eight lower-tier levels having \"fixed\" Power Play prizes.<ref name=\"Changes Coming to Powerball\">{{cite web |url=http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |title=Changes Coming to Powerball... |publisher=Multi-State Lottery Association |accessdate=January 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123094841/http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |archivedate=January 23, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nOn January 19, 2014, PowerPlay was modified; it used 30 balls with the following distribution:\n*2x (15)\n*3x (9)\n*4x/5x: 3 each\n\nOn October 4, 2015, PowerPlay changed again, using 42 or 43\u2020 balls as follows:\n*2x (24)\n*3x (13)\n*4x (3)\n*5x (2)\n*10x (1)\u2020\n\n\u2020 10x available when jackpot is under $150 million.\n\n=== Prizes and odds ===\n\nPayouts as of October 7, 2015:<ref>{{cite web |title=NEW YORK STATE GAMING COMMISSION AMENDMENT OF SECTIONS 5004.9, 5007.2, 5007.13, 5007.15, 5007.16, 5009.2 and 5010.2 OF NEW YORK CODES, RULES AND REGULATIONS TITLE 9, SUBTITLE T, CHAPTER III, SUBCHAPTER A |url=http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |website=New York State Gaming Commission |publisher=New York State Gaming Commission |accessdate=2015-08-02 |page=4 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824015916/http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=3\n|-\n!Matches\n!Prize{{efn|name=cal|California's prize amounts are always parimutuel because its [[California Penal Code|state penal code]] distinguishes between a \"lottery\" which cannot be broken and a \"banked game\" whose [[Breaking the bank|bank theoretically could be broken]].

This estimate is based on the funds accumulated in the jackpot pool rolled over from prior drawings, expected sales for the next drawing, and market interest rates for the securities that would be used to fund the annuity.<ref name=\"powerball.com\" /> The estimated jackpot usually is 32.5% of the (non-''Power Play'') revenue of each base ($1) play, submitted by game members to accumulate into a prize pool to fund the jackpot. If the jackpot is not won in a particular drawing, the prize pool carries over to the next drawing, accumulating until there is a jackpot winner. This prize pool is the cash that is paid to a jackpot winner if they choose cash. If the winner chooses the annuity, current market rates are used to calculate the graduated payment schedule and the initial installment is paid. The remaining funds in the prize pool are invested to generate the income required to fund the remaining installments. If there are multiple jackpot winners for a drawing, the jackpot prize pool is divided equally for all such plays.\n\nMUSL and its members accept all investment risk and are contractually obligated and liable to the winner to make all scheduled payments to annuity winners. If a jackpot ticket is not claimed, the funds in the prize pool are returned to members in proportion to the amount they contributed to the prize pool. The members have different rules regulating how unclaimed funds are used.<ref name=\"powerball.com\"/>\n\nWhen the Powerball jackpot is won, the next jackpot is guaranteed to be $40 million (annuity). If a jackpot is not won, the minimum rollover is $10 million. The cash in the jackpot pool is guaranteed to be the current value of the annuity. If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations, game members must contribute additional funds to the jackpot pool to cover the shortage; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the jackpot is won in consecutive drawings.\n\nBecause of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]] and resulting drop in ticket sales plus the falling interest rates on which annuity prizes were based, Powerball administrators reduced the minimum starting jackpot to $20 million, and the minimum increase to $2 million when the previous jackpot is not won.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Leggate |first1=Jim |title=Powerball cuts jackpot amounts amid coronavirus sales drop |url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/powerball-cuts-jackpot-amounts-amid-coronavirus-sales-drop |accessdate=13 April 2020 |publisher=Fox Business |date=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Claiming prizes ===\n\nA winning ticket must be claimed in the jurisdiction in which it was purchased, regardless of residence. The minimum age to play Powerball is 18, except in Nebraska (19), and Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana and Mississippi (21).\n\nGenerally, Powerball players do not have to choose cash or annuity unless they win a jackpot (then they usually have 60 days to choose). Exceptions include [[Florida]] and [[Missouri]]; the 60-day \"[[clock]]\" starts with the drawing, so a [[Progressive jackpot|jackpot]] winner who wishes to take the cash option needs to make immediate plans to claim their prize. [[New Jersey]] and [[Texas]] require the cash/annuity choice to be made when ''playing''; in New Jersey, an annuity ticket can be changed to cash after winning, while in Texas, the choice is binding. (When the cash option was introduced in 1997, all Powerball players had to make the choice when playing. This regulation was phased out by 1999.) All Powerball prizes must be claimed within a period ranging from 90 days to a year, depending on where the ticket was bought.\n\nPowerball winnings in [[California]] are subject to [[Income tax in the United States#Federal income tax rates for individuals|Federal income tax]] only. There is no state income tax in [[Florida]], [[South Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Wyoming]], and only on interest and dividends in [[Tennessee]] and [[New Hampshire]]. Winnings from tickets purchased outside of one's home state may be subject to the income tax laws of ''both'' states (with possible credit based on the two jurisdictions.)\n\n=== Secondary prizes ===\nUnlike the jackpot pool, other prizes are the responsibility and liability of each participating lottery. All revenue for Powerball ticket sales not used for jackpots is retained by each member; none of this revenue is shared with other lotteries. Members are liable only for the payment of secondary prizes sold there.\n\nSince the secondary prizes are defined in fixed amounts (except in California), if the liability for a given prize level exceed the funds in the prize pool for that level the amount of the prize may be reduced and the prize pool be distributed on a parimutuel basis and result in a prize lower than the fixed amounts given in the prize tables.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://floridalottery.com/powerball |title=Powerball |publisher=Floridalottery.com |date=January 18, 2016 |accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref> Because the secondary prize pools are calculated independently, it is possible lower-tier prizes will differ among the game members.\n\n=== Notable wins ===\n{{Main article|Lottery jackpot records#United States}}\nBecause the quoted jackpot amount is an annuity of 30 graduated annual payments, its cash value relative to the annuity fluctuates. The actual ratio depends on projected interest rates and other factors. MUSL starts with the cash value, built from a percentage of sales, and then calculates the advertised jackpot amount from that value, based on the average costs of the three best securities bids.<ref>[http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp \"Why Has the Cash Jackpot Gone Down?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806042548/http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp |date=August 6, 2015 }} Powerball Frequently Asked Questions.</ref>\n\nOn March 27, 2019, a single ticket purchased in [[Wisconsin]] was the only winner of a $768.4 million ($477 million cash) Powerball jackpot, the third largest in U.S. lottery history.
