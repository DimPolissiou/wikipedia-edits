The magnificent bird-of-paradise is distributed amongst the hill and mid-mountain forests of [[New Guinea]] and surrounding islands. Like most members of the family [[Paradisaeidae]], the male is [[polygamous]] and performs an elaborate courtship display. A widespread and common species throughout their large range, the magnificent bird-of-paradise is evaluated as Least Concern on the [[IUCN Red List]] of Threatened Species. They are listed on Appendix II of [[CITES]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe generic name ''Cicinnurus'' means \"curled tail\" and its specific name ''magnificus'' means magnificent or splendid. The species was formerly listed in the genus ''Diphyllodes'', which means \"Double leaf-like\", referring to its \"leaf-like\" tail.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Naturalis Biodiversity Center - RMNH.AVES.141008 2 - Diphyllodes magnificus hunsteini A.B. Meyer, 1885 - Paradisaeidae - bird skin specimen.jpeg|left|thumb|Male specimen, race ''hunsteini,''  at the [[Naturalis Biodiversity Center]]. Note the iridescent scale-like feathers going down the breast shield.]]\nAs the name suggests, the Magnificent bird-of-paradise is magnificent indeed. It has one of the most complex plumage arrangements in the [[Bird-of-paradise|Paradisaeidae]] family. It reaches around 26\u201326.5&nbsp;cm in total length, though the body is around 19&nbsp;cm. The [[male]] has beautiful golden-yellow wings, which are overlapped by a sulfur-colored mantle, or [[cape]], that deflect white a whitish glow, with deep red feathers bordered by black beneath the cape that form a semi-circle over the wings; there are also scruffy brownish feathers on the sides of the cape. The head is fairly short; it is a light brown in a scalloped pattern on the top that extends to the back of the neck, and a darker reddish-brown on the face and below the chin. It has a pale grey-bluish bill, dark brown [[eye]]s and a thin, white line that extend behind the eyes. Below is an entirely different story; almost the entire underside consists of the large, [[Iridescence|iridescent]] green breast shield, which is finely decorated with [[Lime (color)|lime-green]] to [[turquoise (color)|turquoise]] scale-like feathers that run down the middle of it. The plumage under the shield is blackish-brown. When fully extended, the breast shield is edged with shiny turquoise-greenish. The tail is blackish-brown with two long, [[sickle]]-like, partially curved central tail plumes that are colored light blue. As characteristic in the ''Cicinnurus'' genus, both sexes have colorfully blue legs and feet. The [[female]] is drastically different from the extravagant male; she is light-brown above, including the tail (which lacks the long sickles). Her head is light brown, but the chin is intercepted by brown barring and creamy feathers that extend all the way to the rump. Her bill is the same color as the males', and she also has a white line extending behind the eyes.\n\nIt is [[Sympatry|sympatric]] with its [[Congener (biology)|congener]], the King Bird-of-paradise, and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] has been noted several times.  Over 20 specimens of these hybrids exist in museums, though no wild records have ever occurred. It was once even thought to be a separate species, called [[King of Holland's bird-of-paradise|King of Holland's Bird-of-paradise]] (\"''Diphyllodes gulielmitertii''\"); this hybrid is scarlet red above, of the King, with the golden mantle cape of the Magnificent, also sporting two long tail wires more resembling the king's, but being partially curved at the tip with no green spirals that the king sports.\n\n==Behavior==\nThey tend to favor tropical and subtropical montane and hill forest at altitudes of around 1500 m, though they can be found around 1780 m as well. They build their courts on rugged slopes of rocky and uneven terrain.\n\nThe birds feed mainly on [[fruit]]s, but also feed on [[Animal|animal matter]] (notably insects, reptiles and amphibians), and possibly take [[nectar]] and [[flower]]s. They mainly feed solitarily, but may also feed in mixed-species congregations.\n\nThe courtship display of the male is very unique in its family. It typically takes place on a sapling standing up from the ground. He commonly tends to his court and makes sure it stays clean and clear of fallen debris. When a female attends his court, he is usually on his display perch. Here is where he does his display; he leans backwards to point where his body is perpendicular to the sapling, raises his mantle cape, to where it appears like a yellow halo behind his head, expands and flexes his iridescent breast shield, and waggles his sickle-shaped tail on each side. Though this performance is comical, it is often observed by many females nearby, who do not take the male mating with the core audience member too lightly. When the male is about to [[Copulation (zoology)|copulate]] the core female, other females nearby will spring from their perches to attack and shoe off the female, and the male is discouraged and may have to wait a while to perform again.<ref name=hbw>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hbw.com/species/magnificent-bird-paradise-cicinnurus-magnificus|title=Magnificent Bird-of-paradise (Cicinnurus magnificus)|website=www.hbw.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-08}}</ref>\n\nTypical of most of the bird-of-paradise family, the female takes up all parental duties, including nest-building, incubation and chick-rearing. They lay one to two creamy yellow eggs, and incubation usually concludes within 19 days, and the chicks usually [[fledge]] in 18 days.<ref name=hbw/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe Magnificent bird is included in the same genus as the [[King bird-of-paradise|King]] and [[Wilson's bird-of-paradise|Wilson's]] Birds-of-paradise, though it's more closely related to the latter.

He made important contributions to the areas of [[differential calculus over commutative algebras]], the algebraic theory of differential operators, [[homological algebra]], [[differential geometry]] and [[algebraic topology]], [[mechanics]] and [[mathematical physics]], the geometrical theory of nonlinear partial differential equations and [[Secondary calculus and cohomological physics|secondary calculus]].\n\n==Biography==\n\nA.M. Vinogradov was born on February 18, 1938 in [[Novorossiysk]].  His father, Mikhail Ivanovich Vinogradov, was a hydraulics scientist, his mother, Ilza Alexandrovna Firer, was a medical doctor. Among his more distant ancestors, his great-grandfather [[Anton Smagin]], a self-taught peasant and a deputy of the State Duma of the second convocation stand out. \n\nIn 1955 A.M. Vinogradov entered the Mechanics and Mathematics Department of Moscow State University (Mech-mat), began his Ph.D. in 1960 and completed it in 1964. In 1965, he received a position at the Department of Higher Geometry and Topology of Moscow State University, where he worked until he left the Soviet Union for Italy in 1990. He obtained the next degree (doktorskaya dissertatsiya) in 1984 at the Institute of Mathematics of the Siberian Branch of the USSR Academy of Science in Novosibirsk in Russia. From 1993 to 2010, he held the position of professor in geometry at the University of Salerno in Italy. \n\n==Work==\n\nVinogradov published his first works in number theory, together with [[Boris_Delaunay|B.N. Delaunay]] and [[Dmitry_Fuchs|D.B. Fuchs]] when he was a second year undergraduate student. By the end of his undergraduate years, he was contributing to the [[Albert_Schwarz|A.S. Schwartz]] seminar, and started working on [[algebraic topology]]. His PhD thesis (under the formal supervision of V.G. Boltyansky) was devoted to homotopic properties of the embedding spaces of circles into the 2-sphere or the 3-disk. Vinogradov continued working in algebraic and [[differential topology]] \u2013 in particular, on the [[Adams spectral sequence]] \u2013 until the early seventies, and he started his own research seminar in 1967. Between the sixties and the seventies, inspired by the ideas of [[Sophus Lie]], he began to investigate the foundations of the geometric theory of partial differential equations. Having become familiar with the work of [[Donald_C._Spencer|Spencer]], Goldschmidt and [[Daniel_Quillen|Quillen]] on formal integrability, he turned his attention to the algebraic (in particular, cohomological) component of that theory.\nIn 1972, the short note in Soviet Math Doklady (publishing long texts in the Soviet Union at the time was very difficult) entitled \u201cThe logic algebra of the theory of linear differential operators\u201d [[#1|[1]]], contained what Vinogradov himself called the main functors of the differential calculus over commutative algebras.\n\nVinogradov\u2019s approach to nonlinear [[differential equations]] as geometric objects, with their general theory and applications, is developed in detail in the monographs [[#2|[2]]], [[#3|[3]]] and [[#4|[4]]], as well as in some articles [[#5|[5]]], [[#6|[6]]], [[#22|[22]]]. He united infinitely prolonged differential equations into a category [[#7|[7]]] whose objects, called [[Diffiety|diffieties]] (= differential varieties), are studied in the framework of what he called [[Secondary calculus and cohomological physics|secondary calculus]] (by analogy with secondary quantization) [[#8|[8]]], [[#9|[9]]]. One of the central parts of this theory is based on the <math>\\cal C</math>-spectral sequence (now known as the [[Diffiety#Vinogradov_sequence|Vinogradov spectral sequence]]) [[#10|[10]]], [[#11|[11]]]. The first term of this spectral sequence gives a unified cohomological approach to various notions and statements, including the [[Lagrangian_(field_theory)|Lagrangian]] formalism with constraints, [[Conservation_law|conservation laws]], cosymmetries, the [[Noether theorem]], and the Helmholtz criterion in the inverse problem of the [[calculus of variations]] (for arbitrary nonlinear differential operators). A particular case of the <math>\\cal C</math>-spectral sequence (for an \u201cempty\u201d equation, i.e., for the space of infinite jets) is the so-called [[variational bicomplex]] (see also [https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/variational+bicomplex the n-lab article]).\n\nFurthermore, Vinogradov introduced the construction of a new bracket on the graded algebra of linear transformations of a cochain complex [[#12|[12]]]. The Vinogradov bracket is skew-symmetric and satisfies the Jacobi identity modulo a coboundary. Vinogradov\u2019s construction precursed the general concept of a derived bracket on a differential Loday (or Leibniz) algebra introduced by Y. Kosmann-Schwarzbach in 1996 [[#13|[13]]]. These results were also applied to [[Poisson geometry]] [[#14|[14]]], [[#15|[15]]]. \n\nFurthermore, together with coauthors, Vinogradov was concerned with the analysis and comparison of various generalizations of Lie (super) algebras, including <math>L_\\infty</math> algebras and Filippov algebras [[#16|[16]]].\n\nThe research interests of Alexandre M. Vinogradov were also motivated by problems of contemporary physics \u2013 for example the structure of [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] [[#23|[23]]], [[#24|[24]]], the dynamics of acoustic beams [[#17|[17]]], the equations of [[magnetohydrodynamics]] (the so-called Kadomtsev-Pogutse equations appearing in the stability theory of high-temperature plasma in [[Tokamak|tokamaks]]) [[#18|[18]]] and mathematical questions in [[general relativity]] [[#19|[19]]], [[#20|[20]]], [[#21|[21]]]. Considerable attention to the mathematical understanding of the fundamental physical notion of observable is given in the book [[#4|[4]]], written by Vinogradov jointly with several participants of his seminar under the pen name of Jet Nestruev.\n\n==Contribution to the mathematical community==\n\n[[File:Alexandre_Vinogradov-lect-1.jpg|thumb|250px|Prof. A. M. Vinogradov during a lecture]] From 1967 until 1990, Vinogradov headed a research seminar at Mekhmat MSU.\nFrom 1998 to 2019, Vinogradov organized and directed the so-called [https://sites.google.com/site/levicivitainstitute/Activities/DiffietySchools Diffiety Schools] in Italy, Russia, and Poland in which were taught the ideas about [[differential calculus over commutative algebras]], the algebraic theory of differential operators, the geometrical theory of nonlinear partial differential equations, the concept of a [[diffiety]], the [[Diffiety#Vinogradov_sequence|Vinogradov (C-spectral) sequence]] and [[Secondary calculus and cohomological physics|secondary calculus]].\n\nHe also organized a series of small conferences called \u201cCurrent Geometry\u201d that took place in Italy from 2000 to 2010, as well as the large Moscow conference \u201cSecondary Calculus and Cohomological Physics\u201d (1997) [[#9|[9]]]. \nVinogradov was one of the initial organizers of the [https://www.esi.ac.at/about/people Schr\u00f6dinger International Institute] in Mathematical Physics in Vienna, as well as of the mathematical journal [https://www.journals.elsevier.com/differential-geometry-and-its-applications Differential Geometry and its Applications], remaining one of the editors to his last days. \n\nIn 1985, he created a laboratory that studied various aspects of the geometry of differential equations at the Institute of Programming Systems in Pereslavl-Zalessky and headed it until he left for Italy. \nIn 1978, he was one of the organizers and first lecturers in the so-called [[Jewish_People's_University|People's University]] for students who were not accepted to Mekhmat because they were ethnically Jewish (he ironically called this school the \u201cPeople\u2019s Friendship University\u201d).\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n# {{Citation | first1 = A.

He made important contributions to the areas of [[differential calculus over commutative algebras]], the algebraic theory of differential operators, [[homological algebra]], [[differential geometry]] and [[algebraic topology]], [[mechanics]] and [[mathematical physics]], the geometrical theory of nonlinear partial differential equations and [[Secondary calculus and cohomological physics|secondary calculus]].\n\n==Biography==\n\nA.M. Vinogradov was born on February 18, 1938 in [[Novorossiysk]].  His father, Mikhail Ivanovich Vinogradov, was a hydraulics scientist, his mother, Ilza Alexandrovna Firer, was a medical doctor. Among his more distant ancestors, his great-grandfather [[Anton Smagin]], a self-taught peasant and a deputy of the State Duma of the second convocation stand out. \n\nIn 1955 A.M. Vinogradov entered the Mechanics and Mathematics Department of Moscow State University (Mech-mat), began his Ph.D. in 1960 and completed it in 1964. In 1965, he received a position at the Department of Higher Geometry and Topology of Moscow State University, where he worked until he left the Soviet Union for Italy in 1990. He obtained the next degree (doktorskaya dissertatsiya) in 1984 at the Institute of Mathematics of the Siberian Branch of the USSR Academy of Science in Novosibirsk in Russia. From 1993 to 2010, he held the position of professor in geometry at the University of Salerno in Italy. \n\n==Work==\n\nVinogradov published his first works in number theory, together with [[Boris_Delaunay|B.N. Delaunay]] and [[Dmitry_Fuchs|D.B. Fuchs]] when he was a second year undergraduate student. By the end of his undergraduate years, he was contributing to the [[Albert_Schwarz|A.S. Schwartz]] seminar, and started working on [[algebraic topology]]. His PhD thesis (under the formal supervision of V.G. Boltyansky) was devoted to homotopic properties of the embedding spaces of circles into the 2-sphere or the 3-disk. Vinogradov continued working in algebraic and [[differential topology]] \u2013 in particular, on the [[Adams spectral sequence]] \u2013 until the early seventies, and he started his own research seminar in 1967. Between the sixties and the seventies, inspired by the ideas of [[Sophus Lie]], he began to investigate the foundations of the geometric theory of partial differential equations. Having become familiar with the work of [[Donald_C._Spencer|Spencer]], Goldschmidt and [[Daniel_Quillen|Quillen]] on formal integrability, he turned his attention to the algebraic (in particular, cohomological) component of that theory.\nIn 1972, the short note in Soviet Math Doklady (publishing long texts in the Soviet Union at the time was very difficult) entitled \u201cThe logic algebra of the theory of linear differential operators\u201d [[#1|[1]]], contained what Vinogradov himself called the main functors of the differential calculus over commutative algebras.\n\nVinogradov\u2019s approach to nonlinear [[differential equations]] as geometric objects, with their general theory and applications, is developed in detail in the monographs [[#2|[2]]], [[#3|[3]]] and [[#4|[4]]], as well as in some articles [[#5|[5]]], [[#6|[6]]], [[#22|[22]]]. He united infinitely prolonged differential equations into a category [[#7|[7]]] whose objects, called [[Diffiety|diffieties]] (= differential varieties), are studied in the framework of what he called [[Secondary calculus and cohomological physics|secondary calculus]] (by analogy with secondary quantization) [[#8|[8]]], [[#9|[9]]]. One of the central parts of this theory is based on the <math>\\cal C</math>-spectral sequence (now known as the [[Diffiety#Vinogradov_sequence|Vinogradov spectral sequence]]) [[#10|[10]]], [[#11|[11]]]. The first term of this spectral sequence gives a unified cohomological approach to various notions and statements, including the [[Lagrangian_(field_theory)|Lagrangian]] formalism with constraints, [[Conservation_law|conservation laws]], cosymmetries, the [[Noether theorem]], and the Helmholtz criterion in the inverse problem of the [[calculus of variations]] (for arbitrary nonlinear differential operators). A particular case of the <math>\\cal C</math>-spectral sequence (for an \u201cempty\u201d equation, i.e., for the space of infinite jets) is the so-called [[variational bicomplex]] (see also [https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/variational+bicomplex the n-lab article]).\n\nFurthermore, Vinogradov introduced the construction of a new bracket on the graded algebra of linear transformations of a cochain complex [[#12|[12]]]. The Vinogradov bracket is skew-symmetric and satisfies the Jacobi identity modulo a coboundary. Vinogradov\u2019s construction precursed the general concept of a derived bracket on a differential Loday (or Leibniz) algebra introduced by Y. Kosmann-Schwarzbach in 1996 [[#13|[13]]]. These results were also applied to [[Poisson geometry]] [[#14|[14]]], [[#15|[15]]]. \n\nFurthermore, together with coauthors, Vinogradov was concerned with the analysis and comparison of various generalizations of Lie (super) algebras, including <math>L_\\infty</math> algebras and Filippov algebras [[#16|[16]]].\n\nThe research interests of Alexandre M. Vinogradov were also motivated by problems of contemporary physics \u2013 for example the structure of [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] [[#23|[23]]], [[#24|[24]]], the dynamics of acoustic beams [[#17|[17]]], the equations of [[magnetohydrodynamics]] (the so-called Kadomtsev-Pogutse equations appearing in the stability theory of high-temperature plasma in [[Tokamak|tokamaks]]) [[#18|[18]]] and mathematical questions in [[general relativity]] [[#19|[19]]], [[#20|[20]]], [[#21|[21]]]. Considerable attention to the mathematical understanding of the fundamental physical notion of observable is given in the book [[#4|[4]]], written by Vinogradov jointly with several participants of his seminar under the pen name of Jet Nestruev.\n\n==Contribution to the mathematical community==\n\n[[File:Alexandre_Vinogradov-lect-1.jpg|thumb|250px|Prof. A. M. Vinogradov during a lecture]] From 1967 until 1990, Vinogradov headed a research seminar at Mekhmat MSU.\nFrom 1998 to 2019, Vinogradov organized and directed the so-called [https://sites.google.com/site/levicivitainstitute/Activities/DiffietySchools Diffiety Schools] in Italy, Russia, and Poland in which were taught the ideas about [[differential calculus over commutative algebras]], the algebraic theory of differential operators, the geometrical theory of nonlinear partial differential equations, the concept of a [[diffiety]], the [[Diffiety#Vinogradov_sequence|Vinogradov (C-spectral) sequence]] and [[Secondary calculus and cohomological physics|secondary calculus]].\n\nHe also organized a series of small conferences called \u201cCurrent Geometry\u201d that took place in Italy from 2000 to 2010, as well as the large Moscow conference \u201cSecondary Calculus and Cohomological Physics\u201d (1997) [[#9|[9]]]. \nVinogradov was one of the initial organizers of the [https://www.esi.ac.at/about/people Schr\u00f6dinger International Institute] in Mathematical Physics in Vienna, as well as of the mathematical journal [https://www.journals.elsevier.com/differential-geometry-and-its-applications Differential Geometry and its Applications], remaining one of the editors to his last days. \n\nIn 1985, he created a laboratory that studied various aspects of the geometry of differential equations at the Institute of Programming Systems in Pereslavl-Zalessky and headed it until he left for Italy. \nIn 1978, he was one of the organizers and first lecturers in the so-called [[Jewish_People's_University|People's University]] for students who were not accepted to Mekhmat because they were ethnically Jewish (he ironically called this school the \u201cPeople\u2019s Friendship University\u201d).\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n# {{Citation | first1 = A.

AOL enforcement would detect words used in AOL chat rooms to suspend the accounts of individuals involved in counterfeiting software and trading stolen accounts. The term was used because \"<><\" is the single most common tag of HTML that was found in all chat transcripts naturally, and as such could not be detected or filtered by AOL staff. The symbol <>< was replaced for any wording that referred to stolen credit cards, accounts, or illegal activity. Since the symbol looked like a fish, and due to the popularity of [[phreaking]] it was adapted as \"Phishing\". [[AOHell]], released in early 1995, was a program designed to hack AOL users by allowing the attacker to pose as an AOL staff member, and send an [[instant message]] to a potential victim, asking him to reveal his password.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://wired-vig.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,9932,00.html |last=Stutz |first=Michael |title=AOL: A Cracker's Momma! |date=January 29, 1998 |publisher=Wired News |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214053144/http://wired-vig.wired.com/news/technology/0%2C1282%2C9932%2C00.html |archivedate=December 14, 2005 }}</ref> In order to lure the victim into giving up sensitive information, the message might include imperatives such as \"verify your account\" or \"confirm billing information\".\n\nOnce the victim had revealed the password, the attacker could access and use the victim's account for fraudulent purposes. Both phishing and warezing on AOL generally required custom-written programs, such as [[AOHell]]. Phishing became so prevalent on AOL that they added a line on all instant messages stating: \"no one working at AOL will ask for your password or billing information\". A user using both an AIM account and an AOL account from an [[ISP]] simultaneously could phish AOL members with relative impunity as internet AIM accounts could be used by non-AOL internet members and could not be actioned (i.e., reported to AOL TOS department for disciplinary action).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.phishing.org/history-of-phishing|title=Phishing &#124; History of Phishing|website=www.phishing.org}}</ref>{{tone inline|date=November 2014}}.

Unlike the website-based image schemes, however, the image itself is shared only between the user and the browser, and not between the user and the website. The scheme also relies on a [[mutual authentication]] protocol, which makes it less vulnerable to attacks that affect user-only authentication schemes.\n\nStill another technique relies on a dynamic grid of images that is different for each login attempt. The user must identify the pictures that fit their pre-chosen categories (such as dogs, cars and flowers). Only after they have correctly identified the pictures that fit their categories are they allowed to enter their alphanumeric password to complete the login. Unlike the static images used on the Bank of America website, a dynamic image-based authentication method creates a one-time passcode for the login, requires active participation from the user, and is very difficult for a phishing website to correctly replicate because it would need to display a different grid of randomly generated images that includes the user's secret categories.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.confidenttechnologies.com/products/anti-phishing |title=Dynamic, Mutual Authentication Technology for Anti-Phishing |publisher=Confidenttechnologies.com |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Monitoring and takedown====\nSeveral companies offer banks and other organizations likely to suffer from phishing scams round-the-clock services to monitor, analyze and assist in shutting down phishing websites.<ref>{{cite web |title=Anti-Phishing Working Group: Vendor Solutions |work=Anti-Phishing Working Group |url=http://www.antiphishing.org/solutions.html#takedown |accessdate=July 6, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w9ZGndsq?url=http://www.antiphishing.org/solutions.html#takedown |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> Individuals can contribute by reporting phishing to both volunteer and industry groups,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.linuxworld.com.au/index.php/id;1075406575;fp;2;fpid;1. |last=McMillan |first=Robert |title=New sites let users find and report phishing |date=March 28, 2006 |publisher=LinuxWorld |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119153501/http://www.linuxworld.com.au/index.php/id;1075406575;fp;2;fpid;1. |archivedate=January 19, 2009 }}</ref> such as [[cyscon]] or [[PhishTank]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/10/phishtank.html |title=PhishTank |accessdate=December 7, 2007 |last=Schneier |first=Bruce |authorlink=Bruce Schneier |date=October 5, 2006 |work=Schneier on Security |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w9ZHYbnJ?url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/10/phishtank.html |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> Individuals can also contribute by reporting phone phishing attempts to Phone Phishing, Federal Trade Commission.<ref>{{cite web |title=Federal Trade Commission |url=http://www.ftc.gov/phonefraud |accessdate=March 6, 2009}}</ref> Phishing web pages and emails can be reported to Google.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/?hl=en|title=Report a Phishing Page|website=safebrowsing.google.com}}</ref><ref>[http://consumerscams.org/scam_safety_tips/how_to_report_phishing_scam How to report phishing scams to Google] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130414135047/http://consumerscams.org/scam_safety_tips/how_to_report_phishing_scam |date=2013-04-14 }} Consumer Scams.org</ref> The [[Internet Crime Complaint Center#External links|Internet Crime Complaint Center noticeboard]] carries phishing and [[ransomware (malware)|ransomware]] alerts.\n\n====Transaction verification and signing====\nSolutions have also emerged using the mobile phone<ref>[http://www.safesigner.com Using the smartphone to verify and sign online banking transactions], SafeSigner.</ref> (smartphone) as a second channel for verification and authorization of banking transactions.\n\n====Multi-factor authentication====\nOrganisations can implement two factor or [[multi-factor authentication]] (MFA), which requires a user to use at least 2 factors when logging in.

AOL enforcement would detect words used in AOL chat rooms to suspend the accounts of individuals involved in counterfeiting software and trading stolen accounts. The term was used because \"<><\" is the single most common tag of HTML that was found in all chat transcripts naturally, and as such could not be detected or filtered by AOL staff.

Both phishing and warezing on AOL generally required custom-written programs, such as [[AOHell]]. Phishing became so prevalent on AOL that they added a line on all instant messages stating: \"no one working at AOL will ask for your password or billing information\". A user using both an AIM account and an AOL account from an [[ISP]] simultaneously could phish AOL members with relative impunity as internet AIM accounts could be used by non-AOL internet members and could not be actioned (i.e., reported to AOL TOS department for disciplinary action).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.phishing.org/history-of-phishing|title=Phishing &#124; History of Phishing|website=www.phishing.org}}</ref>{{tone inline|date=November 2014}}.

The scheme also relies on a [[mutual authentication]] protocol, which makes it less vulnerable to attacks that affect user-only authentication schemes.\n\nStill another technique relies on a dynamic grid of images that is different for each login attempt. The user must identify the pictures that fit their pre-chosen categories (such as dogs, cars and flowers). Only after they have correctly identified the pictures that fit their categories are they allowed to enter their alphanumeric password to complete the login. Unlike the static images used on the Bank of America website, a dynamic image-based authentication method creates a one-time passcode for the login, requires active participation from the user, and is very difficult for a phishing website to correctly replicate because it would need to display a different grid of randomly generated images that includes the user's secret categories.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.confidenttechnologies.com/products/anti-phishing |title=Dynamic, Mutual Authentication Technology for Anti-Phishing |publisher=Confidenttechnologies.com |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Monitoring and takedown====\nSeveral companies offer banks and other organizations likely to suffer from phishing scams round-the-clock services to monitor, analyze and assist in shutting down phishing websites.<ref>{{cite web |title=Anti-Phishing Working Group: Vendor Solutions |work=Anti-Phishing Working Group |url=http://www.antiphishing.org/solutions.html#takedown |accessdate=July 6, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w9ZGndsq?url=http://www.antiphishing.org/solutions.html#takedown |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> Individuals can contribute by reporting phishing to both volunteer and industry groups,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.linuxworld.com.au/index.php/id;1075406575;fp;2;fpid;1. |last=McMillan |first=Robert |title=New sites let users find and report phishing |date=March 28, 2006 |publisher=LinuxWorld |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119153501/http://www.linuxworld.com.au/index.php/id;1075406575;fp;2;fpid;1. |archivedate=January 19, 2009 }}</ref> such as [[cyscon]] or [[PhishTank]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/10/phishtank.html |title=PhishTank |accessdate=December 7, 2007 |last=Schneier |first=Bruce |authorlink=Bruce Schneier |date=October 5, 2006 |work=Schneier on Security |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w9ZHYbnJ?url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/10/phishtank.html |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> Individuals can also contribute by reporting phone phishing attempts to Phone Phishing, Federal Trade Commission.<ref>{{cite web |title=Federal Trade Commission |url=http://www.ftc.gov/phonefraud |accessdate=March 6, 2009}}</ref> Phishing web pages and emails can be reported to Google.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/?hl=en|title=Report a Phishing Page|website=safebrowsing.google.com}}</ref><ref>[http://consumerscams.org/scam_safety_tips/how_to_report_phishing_scam How to report phishing scams to Google] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130414135047/http://consumerscams.org/scam_safety_tips/how_to_report_phishing_scam |date=2013-04-14 }} Consumer Scams.org</ref> The [[Internet Crime Complaint Center#External links|Internet Crime Complaint Center noticeboard]] carries phishing and [[ransomware (malware)|ransomware]] alerts.\n\n====Transaction verification and signing====\nSolutions have also emerged using the mobile phone<ref>[http://www.safesigner.com Using the smartphone to verify and sign online banking transactions], SafeSigner.</ref> (smartphone) as a second channel for verification and authorization of banking transactions.\n\n====Multi-factor authentication====\nOrganisations can implement two factor or [[multi-factor authentication]] (MFA), which requires a user to use at least 2 factors when logging in.
