In feudal Japan, honorable formal suicide ([[seppuku]]) among [[Samurai]] (Japanese warrior) was considered a justified response to failure or inevitable defeat in battle. Traditionally, seppuku involved the slashing open of one's stomach with a sword. The purpose of this was to release the Samurai's spirit upon the enemy and thus avoid dishonorable execution and probable torture at the hand of an enemy.

These pacts, which are popularly referred to as \"Internet group suicide\", are formed with the intention of all individuals meeting to die by suicide at the same time, by the same method.<ref name=\"naito\"/>\n\nWhile the concept of group suicide also has a historical presence in Japanese culture, traditional shinj\u016b differs from modern Internet group suicide because it occurred among lovers or family members rather than among strangers. Another difference is that mutual consent from those who die by historical shinj\u016b was not required. In other words, certain forms of shinj\u016b might be considered \"murder-suicide\" in Western cultures rather than suicide. An example of this type of shinj\u016b would be a mother killing her children and then killing herself.<ref name=\"ozawa-desilva2\" />\n\nAn example of historical shinj\u016b in Japanese literature can be found in [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]]'s puppet play from 1703 entitled Sonezaki Shinjuu (\"The Love Suicides at Sonezaki\"), which was later re-engineered for the kabuki theater. The inspiration for the play was an actual [[Shinj\u016b|double suicide]] which had then recently occurred between two forbidden lovers.<ref name=Keene>{{Cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/110980/Chikamatsu-Monzaemon|title=Chikamatsu Monzaemon|last=Keene|first=Donald|date= 30 April 2013|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=2014-11-24}}</ref>\n\nThese modern shinj\u016b have not received the same level of tolerance or social acceptability as an honor suicide (seppuku or hara-kiri) from the Japanese media. Internet group suicide has generally been portrayed as a thoughtless and impulsive act by the media because it seems that there is no compelling reason for why individuals enter into such pacts.

These pacts, which are popularly referred to as \"Internet group suicide\", are formed with the intention of all individuals meeting to die by suicide at the same time, by the same method.<ref name=\"naito\"/>\n\nWhile the concept of group suicide also has a historical presence in Japanese culture, traditional shinj\u016b differs from modern Internet group suicide because it occurred among lovers or family members rather than among strangers. Another difference is that mutual consent from those who die by historical shinj\u016b was not required. In other words, certain forms of shinj\u016b might be considered \"murder-suicide\" in Western cultures rather than suicide. An example of this type of shinj\u016b would be a mother killing her children and then killing herself.<ref name=\"ozawa-desilva2\" />\n\nAn example of historical shinj\u016b in Japanese literature can be found in [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]]'s puppet play from 1703 entitled Sonezaki Shinjuu (\"The Love Suicides at Sonezaki\"), which was later re-engineered for the kabuki theater. The inspiration for the play was an actual [[Shinj\u016b|double suicide]] which had then recently occurred between two forbidden lovers.<ref name=Keene>{{Cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/110980/Chikamatsu-Monzaemon|title=Chikamatsu Monzaemon|last=Keene|first=Donald|date= 30 April 2013|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=2014-11-24}}</ref>\n\nThese modern shinj\u016b have not received the same level of tolerance or social acceptability as an honor suicide (seppuku or hara-kiri) from the Japanese media. Internet group suicide has generally been portrayed as a thoughtless and impulsive act by the media because it seems that there is no compelling reason for why individuals enter into such pacts. In contrast, seppuku serves a specific function; to preserve honor rather than die at the hand of an enemy.<ref name=\"ozawa-desilva\" /> However, this perception has been challenged by research on Internet group suicide by Ozawa de-Silva, who argues that these deaths are \"characterized by severe existential suffering, a loss of the \"worth of living\" ([[ikigai]])...and a profound loneliness and lack of connection with others\".<ref name=\"ozawa-desilva\" />\n\nOverall, modern public concern about Japan's increasing suicide rate has tended to focus on suicide as a social issue rather than a public health concern. The distinction here is that Japanese culture emphasizes maladjustment into society and social factors as playing a larger role in an individual's decision to commit suicide than an individual psychopathology that is biological in nature.<ref name=\"ueno\"/> Furthermore, stigma surrounding mental health care still exists in Japan.<ref name=\"ozawa-desilva\" /> Thus, there has been more emphasis on reforming social programs that contribute to economic stability (i.e. welfare) rather than creating specific mental health services.\n\nAccording to The New Yorker, \"by tradition, a mother who killed herself but not her children was thought to be truly wicked.\"<ref>https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/06/24/last-call-3</ref>{{Better source|reason=The tertiary source does not provide other sources or data to support statement on Japanese traditions.|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Government response==\nIn 2007, the government released a nine-step plan, a \"counter-suicide [[White paper|White Paper]]\", which it hopes will curb suicide by 20% by 2017.<ref name=\"Times govt whitepaper\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article2852762.ece|title=90 suicides a day spur Japan into action|last=Lewis|first=Leo|date=12 November 2007|newspaper= The Times|accessdate=2008-09-23}}{{subscription required}}</ref> The goal of the white paper is to encourage investigation of the root causes of suicide in order to prevent it, change cultural attitudes toward suicide, and improve treatment of unsuccessful suicides.<ref name=\"Times govt whitepaper\"/> In 2009, the Japanese government committed 15.8 billion yen towards suicide prevention strategies.\n\nJapan has allotted 12.4 billion yen ($133 million) in suicide prevention assets for the 2010 fiscal year ending March 2011, with plans to fund public counseling for those with overwhelming debts and those needing treatment for depression.<ref name=APW/>\n\nAmid the overall increase in self-inflicted death for 2009, the government claims there have been encouraging signs since September.

He was a conventional [[court painter]] of portraits for three [[Holy Roman emperor]]s in Vienna and Prague, also producing religious subjects and, among other things, a series of coloured drawings of exotic animals in the imperial [[menagerie]]. He specialized in grotesque symbolical compositions of fruits, animals, landscapes, or various inanimate objects arranged into human forms.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Oxford illustrated encyclopedia|date=1985-1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Judge, Harry George., Toyne, Anthony.|isbn=0-19-869129-7|location=Oxford [England]|pages=21|oclc=11814265}}</ref> The [[still-life]] portraits were clearly partly intended as whimsical curiosities to amuse the court, but critics have speculated as the degree of serious engagement with [[Renaissance Neo-Platonism]] or other intellectual currents that they have. \n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Vertumnus \u00e5rstidernas gud m\u00e5lad av Giuseppe Arcimboldo 1591 - Skoklosters slott - 91503.tiff|thumb|''[[Vertumnus (painting)|Vertumnus]]'', a portrait depicting [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]] painted as [[Vertumnus]], the Roman god of the seasons, c. 1590\u201391.

Like his father, Giuseppe Arcimboldo started his career as a designer for stained glass and frescoes at local cathedrals when he was 21 years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.giuseppe-arcimboldo.org/biography.html |title=Giuseppe Arcimboldo Biography |publisher=Giuseppe-arcimboldo.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref> \n\nIn 1562, he became court portraitist to [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] at the [[Habsburg]] court in [[Vienna]], Austria and later, to [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] and his son [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] at the court in [[Prague]]. He was also the court decorator and costume designer. [[Augustus, Elector of Saxony]], who visited [[Vienna]] in 1570 and 1573, saw Arcimboldo's work and commissioned a copy of his ''The Four Seasons'' which incorporates his own monarchic [[symbol]]s.\n\nArcimboldo's conventional work, on traditional religious subjects, has fallen into oblivion, but his portraits of human heads made up of vegetables, plants, fruits, sea creatures and tree roots, were greatly admired by his contemporaries and remain a source of fascination today.\n\nAt a distance, his portraits looked like normal human portraits.  However, individual objects in each portrait were actually overlapped together to make various anatomical shapes of a human.  They were carefully constructed by his imagination.  The assembled objects in each portrait were not random: each was related by characterization.<ref>Maiorino, Giancarlo. ''The Portrait of Eccentricity: Arcimboldo and the Mannerist Grotesque.''  The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1991. Print.</ref>  In the portrait now represented by several copies called ''The Librarian'', Arcimboldo used objects that signified the book culture at that time, such as the curtain that created individual study rooms in a library.  The animal tails, which became the beard of the portrait, were used as dusters.  By using everyday objects, the portraits were decoration and still-life paintings at the same time.<ref name=\"Elhard, K. C 2005\">Elhard, K.

It was during this last phase of his career that he produced the composite portrait of Rudolph II (see above), as well as his self-portrait as the Four Seasons.  His Italian contemporaries honored him with poetry and manuscripts celebrating his illustrious career.\n\nWhen the [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]] army invaded [[Prague]] in 1648, during the [[Thirty Years' War]], many of Arcimboldo's paintings were taken from [[Rudolf II]]'s collection.\n\nHis works can be found in Vienna's [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] and the [[Ambras Castle|Habsburg Schloss Ambras]] in [[Innsbruck]]; the [[Louvre]] in Paris; as well as in numerous museums in Sweden. In Italy, his work is in [[Cremona]], [[Brescia]], and the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence]]. The [[Wadsworth Atheneum]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Connecticut]]; the [[Denver Art Museum]] in [[Denver, Colorado]]; the Menil Foundation in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]; the Candie Museum in [[Guernsey]] and the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]] in [[Madrid]] also own [[painting]]s by Arcimboldo.\n\nHe is known as a 16th-century [[Mannerist]].  A transitional period from 1520 to 1590, Mannerism adopted some artistic elements from the High Renaissance and influenced other elements in the Baroque period.  A Mannerist tended to show close relationships between human and nature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artsconnected.org/resource/93691/the-mannerist-style-and-the-lamentation |title=The Mannerist Style and the Lamentation |publisher=Artsconnected.org |date=2009-03-10 |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref> Arcimboldo also tried to show his appreciation of nature through his portraits.  In ''The Spring'', the human portrait was composed of only various spring flowers and plants.  From the hat to the neck, every part of the portrait, even the lips and nose, was composed of flowers, while the body was composed of plants.  On the other hand, in ''The Winter'', the human was composed mostly of roots of trees.  Some leaves from evergreen trees and the branches of other trees became hair, while a straw mat became the costume of the human portrait.\n\n==Legacy==\n\nIn 1976, the Spanish sculptor [[Miguel Berrocal]] created the original bronze sculpture interlocking in 20 elements titled ''Opus 144 ARCIMBOLDO BIG'' as a homage to the Italian painter. This work was followed by the limited-edition sculpture in 1000 copies titled ''Opus 167 OMAGGIO AD ARCIMBOLDO (HOMAGE TO ARCIMBOLDO)'' of 1976\u20131979 consisting of 30 interlocking elements.\n\nThe works of Arcimboldo, especially his multiple [[image]]s and visual puns, were rediscovered in the early 20th century by [[Surrealist]] artists such as [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]. The exhibition entitled \"The Arcimboldo Effect: Transformations of the face from the 16th to the 20th Century\u201d at the [[Palazzo Grassi]] in [[Venice]] (1987) includes numerous 'double meaning' paintings. Arcimboldo's influence can also be seen in the work of [[Shigeo Fukuda]], [[Istv\u00e1n Orosz]], [[Octavio Ocampo]], [[Vic Muniz]], and Sandro del Prete, as well as the films of [[Jan \u0160vankmajer]].<ref>[Literature:''The Arcimboldo Effect: Transformations of the face from the 16th to the 20th Century''. Abbeville Press, New York, 1st Edition (September 1987). {{ISBN|0896597695}}. {{ISBN|978-0896597693}}.]</ref>\n\nArcimboldo's works are used by some psychologists and neuroscientists to determine the presence of [[lesions]] in the hemispheres of the brain that recognize [[Global precedence|global and local]] images and objects.\n\n==Art heritage, estimates== \n===Heritage===\n\n[[File:Print, Puzzle Picture of Napoleon, 1813 (CH 18553609).jpg|thumb|A 1813 Puzzle Picture of Napoleon, in the same style like Giuseppe Arcimboldo, hand-colored etching, in the [[Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum]] (New York City)]]\n\nGiuseppe Arcimboldo did not leave written certificates on himself or his artwork. After the deaths of Arcimboldo and his patron\u2014the emperor Rudolph II\u2014the heritage of the artist was quickly forgotten, and many of his works were lost. They were not mentioned in the literature of the 17th and 18th centuries. Only in 1885 did the art critic K. Kasati publish the monograph \"Giuseppe Arcimboldi, Milan Artist\" in which the main attention was given to Arcimboldi's role as a portraitist.<ref name=\"Werner Kriegeskorte 2000 p. 30\">Werner Kriegeskorte (2000).

Taschen. p. 30. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref>\n\nWith the advent of [[surrealism]] its theorists paid attention to the formal work of Arcimboldo, and in the first half of the 20th century many articles were devoted to his heritage. Gustav Hocke [de] drew parallels between Arcimboldo, [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], and [[Max Ernst]]'s works. A volume monograph of B. Geyger and the book by F. Legrand and F.

His volume work, published in 2009, summed up the attitude of modern art critics towards Arcimboldo.

In total about 20 of his pictures remain, but many more have been lost, according to mentions of his contemporaries and documents of the era. His cycles ''Four Elements'' and ''Seasons'', which the artist repeated with little changes, are most known. Some of his paintings include ''[[The Librarian (painting)|The Librarian]]'', ''[[The Jurist (painting)|The Jurist]]'', ''The Cook'', ''Cupbearer'', and other pictures.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000).

Krigeskort, \"are absolutely unique\".<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. p. 20. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref> Attempts of interpretation begin with judgments of the cultural background and philosophy of the artist, however a consensus in this respect is not developed. B. Geyger, who for the first time raised these questions, relied mainly on judgments of contemporaries\u2014[[Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo|Lomazzo]], [[:it:Gregorio Comanini|Comanini]], and [[:it:Paolo Morigia|Morigia]], who used the terms \"scherzi, grilli, and capricci\" (respectively, \"jokes\", \"whims\", \"caprices\").{{sfn|Ferino-Pagden|2007|p=15}} Geyger's monograph is entitled: \"Comic pictures of Giuseppe Arcimboldo\". Geyger considered the works of the artist as inversion, when the ugliness seems beautiful, or, on the contrary, as the disgrace exceeding the beauty, entertaining the regal customer.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. pp. 32\u201334. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref> A similar point of view was stated by [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]], but he reduced works of the artist to the theory of language, believing that fundamentals of Arcimboldo's art philosophy is linguistic, because without creating new signs he confused them by mixing and combining elements that then played a role in the innovation of language.<ref>Roland Barthes. Arcimboldo. p. 335</ref> \n\n<blockquote>Arcimboldo speaks double language, at the same time obvious and obfuscatory; he creates \"mumbling\" and \"gibberish\", but these inventions remain quite rational. Generally, the only whim (bizarrerie) which isn't afforded by Arcimboldo \u2013 he doesn't create language absolutely unclear \u2026 his art not madly.<ref>Roland Barthes. ''Arcimboldo''. p. 338</ref></blockquote>Arcimboldo's classification as [[Mannerism|mannerist]] also belongs to the 20th century. Its justification contains in Gustav Rehn Hok's work ''The world as a Labyrinth'', published in 1957. Arcimboldo was born in the late Renaissance, and his first works were done in a traditional Renaissance manner. In Hok's opinion, during the Renaissance era the artist had to be first of all the talented handicraftsman who skillfully imitated the nature, as the idea of fine art was based on its studying. [[Mannerism]] differed from the [[Renaissance]] art in attraction to \"not naturalistic abstraction\". It was a continuation of artistic innovation in the late Middle Ages\u2014art embodying ideas. According to G. Hok, in consciousness there is concetto\u2014the concept of a picture or a picture of the concept, an intellectual prototype. Arcimboldo, making a start from concetti, painted metaphorical and fantastic pictures, extremely typical for manneristic art.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. pp. 56\u201358. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref> In ''[[On Ugliness]]'', which was published under [[Umberto Eco]]'s edition, Arcimboldo also admitted belonging to manneristic tradition for which \"...the preference for aspiration to strange, extravagant and shapeless over expressional fine\" is peculiar.<ref>''Storia della bruttezza'' (Bompiani, 2007 \u2013 English translation: ''On Ugliness'', 2007). p.169</ref>\n\nIn the work ''Arcimboldo and archimboldesk'', F. Legrand and F. Xu tried to reconstruct philosophical views of the artist. They came to a conclusion that the views represented a kind of [[Platonism|Platonic pantheism]]. The key to reconstruction of Arcimboldo's outlook seemed to them to be in the symbolism of court celebrations staged by the artist, and in his allegorical series. According to Plato's dialogues \"[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]\", an immemorial god created the Universe from chaos by a combination of four elements \u2013 fire, water, air and the earth, as defines all-encompassing unity.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). Arcimboldo. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. pp. 58\u201360. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref>\nIn T. Dakosta Kauffman's works serious interpretation of heritage of Arcimboldo in the context of culture of the 16th century is carried out consistently. Kauffman in general was skeptical about attribution of works by Arcimboldo, and recognized as undoubted originals only four pictures, those with a signature of the artist. He based the interpretation on the text of the unpublished poem by J. Fonteo \"The picture ''Seasons'' and ''Four Elements'' of the imperial artist Giuseppe Arcimboldo\". According to Fonteo, the allegorical cycles of Arcimboldo transfer ideas of greatness of the emperor. The harmony in which fruits and animals are combined into images of the human head symbolizes harmony of the empire under the good board of the Habsburgs. Images of seasons and elements are always presented in profile, but thus ''Winter'' and ''Water'', ''Spring'' and ''Air'', ''Summer'' and ''Fire'', ''Fall'' and ''Earth'' are turned to each other. In each cycle symmetry is also observed: two heads look to the right, and two \u2014 to the left. Seasons alternate in an invariable order, symbolizing both constancy of the nature and eternity of board of the Habsburgs' house. The political symbolics also hints at it: at the image of ''Air'' there are Habsburg symbols \u2014 a peacock and an eagle and ''Fire'' is decorated with a chain of the Award of the Golden Fleece, a great master of which by tradition was a head of a reigning dynasty. However it is made of flints and shod steel. Guns also point to the aggressive beginning. The Habsburg symbolics is present in the picture ''Earth'', where the lion's skin designates a heraldic sign of Bohemia. Pearls and corals similar to cervine horns in ''Water'' hint at the same. {{sfn|Ferino-Pagden|2007|p=97\u2014101}}<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese.

He was also the court decorator and costume designer. [[Augustus, Elector of Saxony]], who visited [[Vienna]] in 1570 and 1573, saw Arcimboldo's work and commissioned a copy of his ''The Four Seasons'' which incorporates his own monarchic [[symbol]]s.\n\nArcimboldo's conventional work, on traditional religious subjects, has fallen into oblivion, but his portraits of human heads made up of vegetables, plants, fruits, sea creatures and tree roots, were greatly admired by his contemporaries and remain a source of fascination today.\n\nAt a distance, his portraits looked like normal human portraits.  However, individual objects in each portrait were actually overlapped together to make various anatomical shapes of a human.  They were carefully constructed by his imagination.  The assembled objects in each portrait were not random: each was related by characterization.<ref>Maiorino, Giancarlo. ''The Portrait of Eccentricity: Arcimboldo and the Mannerist Grotesque.''

It was during this last phase of his career that he produced the composite portrait of Rudolph II (see above), as well as his self-portrait as the Four Seasons.  His Italian contemporaries honored him with poetry and manuscripts celebrating his illustrious career.\n\nWhen the [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]] army invaded [[Prague]] in 1648, during the [[Thirty Years' War]], many of Arcimboldo's paintings were taken from [[Rudolf II]]'s collection.\n\nHis works can be found in Vienna's [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] and the [[Ambras Castle|Habsburg Schloss Ambras]] in [[Innsbruck]]; the [[Louvre]] in Paris; as well as in numerous museums in Sweden. In Italy, his work is in [[Cremona]], [[Brescia]], and the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence]].

A transitional period from 1520 to 1590, Mannerism adopted some artistic elements from the High Renaissance and influenced other elements in the Baroque period.  A Mannerist tended to show close relationships between human and nature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artsconnected.org/resource/93691/the-mannerist-style-and-the-lamentation |title=The Mannerist Style and the Lamentation |publisher=Artsconnected.org |date=2009-03-10 |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref> Arcimboldo also tried to show his appreciation of nature through his portraits.  In ''The Spring'', the human portrait was composed of only various spring flowers and plants.  From the hat to the neck, every part of the portrait, even the lips and nose, was composed of flowers, while the body was composed of plants.  On the other hand, in ''The Winter'', the human was composed mostly of roots of trees.  Some leaves from evergreen trees and the branches of other trees became hair, while a straw mat became the costume of the human portrait.\n\n==Legacy==\n\nIn 1976, the Spanish sculptor [[Miguel Berrocal]] created the original bronze sculpture interlocking in 20 elements titled ''Opus 144 ARCIMBOLDO BIG'' as a homage to the Italian painter. This work was followed by the limited-edition sculpture in 1000 copies titled ''Opus 167 OMAGGIO AD ARCIMBOLDO (HOMAGE TO ARCIMBOLDO)'' of 1976\u20131979 consisting of 30 interlocking elements.\n\nThe works of Arcimboldo, especially his multiple [[image]]s and visual puns, were rediscovered in the early 20th century by [[Surrealist]] artists such as [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]. The exhibition entitled \"The Arcimboldo Effect: Transformations of the face from the 16th to the 20th Century\u201d at the [[Palazzo Grassi]] in [[Venice]] (1987) includes numerous 'double meaning' paintings. Arcimboldo's influence can also be seen in the work of [[Shigeo Fukuda]], [[Istv\u00e1n Orosz]], [[Octavio Ocampo]], [[Vic Muniz]], and Sandro del Prete, as well as the films of [[Jan \u0160vankmajer]].<ref>[Literature:''The Arcimboldo Effect: Transformations of the face from the 16th to the 20th Century''.

After the deaths of Arcimboldo and his patron\u2014the emperor Rudolph II\u2014the heritage of the artist was quickly forgotten, and many of his works were lost. They were not mentioned in the literature of the 17th and 18th centuries. Only in 1885 did the art critic K.

Gustav Hocke [de] drew parallels between Arcimboldo, [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], and [[Max Ernst]]'s works. A volume monograph of B. Geyger and the book by F. Legrand and F. Xu were published in 1954.\n\nSince 1978 T. DaCosta Kaufmann was engaged in Arcimboldo's heritage, and wrote of the artist defending his dissertation \"Variations on an imperial subject\". His volume work, published in 2009, summed up the attitude of modern art critics towards Arcimboldo. An article published in 1980 by [[Roland Barthes]] was devoted to Arcimboldo's works.<ref name=\"Werner Kriegeskorte 2000 p. 30\"/>\n\nArchimboldo's relation with surrealism was emphasized at landmark exhibitions in New York (\"Fantastic art, [[dada]], [[surrealism]]\", 1937) and in Venice (\"Arcimboldo's Effect: Evolution of the person in painting from the XVI century\", Palazzo Grassi, 1987) where Arcimboldo's allegories were presented.{{sfn|Ferino-Pagden|2007|p=15}} The largest encyclopedic exhibition of Arcimboldo's heritage, where about 150 of his works were presented, including graphics, was held in Vienna in 2008. In spite of the fact that very few works of Arcimboldo are available in the art market, their auction cost is in the range of five to 10 million dollars. Experts note that it is very modest for an artist at such a level of popularity.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/arts/design/17vogel.html?_r=0|title=Arcimboldo Work Bought in Time for Exhibition|author=Carol Vogel|work=The New York Times|date= September 16, 2010|accessdate=2014-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/16/AR2010091606901.html|title=Arcimboldo's 'Four Seasons' will join National Gallery of Art collection|author= Blake Gopnik|work=Washington Post|date=September 17, 2010|accessdate=2014-10-31}}</ref>\n\nArcimboldo's art heritage is badly identified, especially as it concerns his early works and pictures in traditional style. In total about 20 of his pictures remain, but many more have been lost, according to mentions of his contemporaries and documents of the era. His cycles ''Four Elements'' and ''Seasons'', which the artist repeated with little changes, are most known. Some of his paintings include ''[[The Librarian (painting)|The Librarian]]'', ''[[The Jurist (painting)|The Jurist]]'', ''The Cook'', ''Cupbearer'', and other pictures.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. p. 16\u201420. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref> Arcimboldo's works are stored in the state museums and private collections of Italy (including [[Uffizi]] Gallery), France ([[Louvre]]), Austria, the Czech Republic, Sweden, and in the US.\n\n===Art interpretations===\nThe main object of modern art critics interpretation are the \"curious\" paintings of Arcimboldo whose works, according to V. Krigeskort, \"are absolutely unique\".<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. p. 20. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref> Attempts of interpretation begin with judgments of the cultural background and philosophy of the artist, however a consensus in this respect is not developed. B. Geyger, who for the first time raised these questions, relied mainly on judgments of contemporaries\u2014[[Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo|Lomazzo]], [[:it:Gregorio Comanini|Comanini]], and [[:it:Paolo Morigia|Morigia]], who used the terms \"scherzi, grilli, and capricci\" (respectively, \"jokes\", \"whims\", \"caprices\").{{sfn|Ferino-Pagden|2007|p=15}} Geyger's monograph is entitled: \"Comic pictures of Giuseppe Arcimboldo\". Geyger considered the works of the artist as inversion, when the ugliness seems beautiful, or, on the contrary, as the disgrace exceeding the beauty, entertaining the regal customer.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. pp. 32\u201334. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref> A similar point of view was stated by [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]], but he reduced works of the artist to the theory of language, believing that fundamentals of Arcimboldo's art philosophy is linguistic, because without creating new signs he confused them by mixing and combining elements that then played a role in the innovation of language.<ref>Roland Barthes. Arcimboldo. p. 335</ref> \n\n<blockquote>Arcimboldo speaks double language, at the same time obvious and obfuscatory; he creates \"mumbling\" and \"gibberish\", but these inventions remain quite rational. Generally, the only whim (bizarrerie) which isn't afforded by Arcimboldo \u2013 he doesn't create language absolutely unclear \u2026 his art not madly.<ref>Roland Barthes. ''Arcimboldo''. p. 338</ref></blockquote>Arcimboldo's classification as [[Mannerism|mannerist]] also belongs to the 20th century. Its justification contains in Gustav Rehn Hok's work ''The world as a Labyrinth'', published in 1957. Arcimboldo was born in the late Renaissance, and his first works were done in a traditional Renaissance manner. In Hok's opinion, during the Renaissance era the artist had to be first of all the talented handicraftsman who skillfully imitated the nature, as the idea of fine art was based on its studying. [[Mannerism]] differed from the [[Renaissance]] art in attraction to \"not naturalistic abstraction\". It was a continuation of artistic innovation in the late Middle Ages\u2014art embodying ideas. According to G. Hok, in consciousness there is concetto\u2014the concept of a picture or a picture of the concept, an intellectual prototype. Arcimboldo, making a start from concetti, painted metaphorical and fantastic pictures, extremely typical for manneristic art.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. pp. 56\u201358. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref> In ''[[On Ugliness]]'', which was published under [[Umberto Eco]]'s edition, Arcimboldo also admitted belonging to manneristic tradition for which \"...the preference for aspiration to strange, extravagant and shapeless over expressional fine\" is peculiar.<ref>''Storia della bruttezza'' (Bompiani, 2007 \u2013 English translation: ''On Ugliness'', 2007). p.169</ref>\n\nIn the work ''Arcimboldo and archimboldesk'', F. Legrand and F. Xu tried to reconstruct philosophical views of the artist. They came to a conclusion that the views represented a kind of [[Platonism|Platonic pantheism]]. The key to reconstruction of Arcimboldo's outlook seemed to them to be in the symbolism of court celebrations staged by the artist, and in his allegorical series. According to Plato's dialogues \"[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]\", an immemorial god created the Universe from chaos by a combination of four elements \u2013 fire, water, air and the earth, as defines all-encompassing unity.<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). Arcimboldo. Ediz. Inglese. Taschen. pp. 58\u201360. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5993-3}}</ref>\nIn T. Dakosta Kauffman's works serious interpretation of heritage of Arcimboldo in the context of culture of the 16th century is carried out consistently. Kauffman in general was skeptical about attribution of works by Arcimboldo, and recognized as undoubted originals only four pictures, those with a signature of the artist. He based the interpretation on the text of the unpublished poem by J. Fonteo \"The picture ''Seasons'' and ''Four Elements'' of the imperial artist Giuseppe Arcimboldo\". According to Fonteo, the allegorical cycles of Arcimboldo transfer ideas of greatness of the emperor. The harmony in which fruits and animals are combined into images of the human head symbolizes harmony of the empire under the good board of the Habsburgs. Images of seasons and elements are always presented in profile, but thus ''Winter'' and ''Water'', ''Spring'' and ''Air'', ''Summer'' and ''Fire'', ''Fall'' and ''Earth'' are turned to each other. In each cycle symmetry is also observed: two heads look to the right, and two \u2014 to the left. Seasons alternate in an invariable order, symbolizing both constancy of the nature and eternity of board of the Habsburgs' house. The political symbolics also hints at it: at the image of ''Air'' there are Habsburg symbols \u2014 a peacock and an eagle and ''Fire'' is decorated with a chain of the Award of the Golden Fleece, a great master of which by tradition was a head of a reigning dynasty. However it is made of flints and shod steel. Guns also point to the aggressive beginning. The Habsburg symbolics is present in the picture ''Earth'', where the lion's skin designates a heraldic sign of Bohemia. Pearls and corals similar to cervine horns in ''Water'' hint at the same. {{sfn|Ferino-Pagden|2007|p=97\u2014101}}<ref>Werner Kriegeskorte (2000). ''Arcimboldo''. Ediz. Inglese.

Marine biologists Ben ([[Alex Roe]]) and Maddie (Fola Evans-Akingbola) work together to find out who and what drove this primal hunter of the deep sea to land.\n\nBy Season Two, more merpeople started appearing in Bristol Cove due to the pollution in the nearby waters and the sonic waves from the oil rig. Additionally, Elaine Pownall's paralysis is gradually being counteracted by Ryn's mermaid stem cells.\n\nIn Season Three, Ben, Maddie and Ryn contend with the mermaid Tia who plans to coerce all merpeople tribes/colonies to join her in her fight to overthrow humanity.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n*[[Alex Roe]] as Ben Pownall, a marine biologist who helps Ryn and is entranced by her melodious, irresistibly hypnotic siren song and becomes her lover. \n*[[Eline Powell]] as Ryn Fisher, a strange young adult mermaid with a dark secret.

Like Ben, Maddie is entranced by Ryn's melodious, irresistibly hypnotic siren song and becomes her lover.\n*[[Sibongile Mlambo]] as Donna (season 1), a mystical and deceptively powerful mermaid who is Ryn's older sister. She was unintentionally caught in a fishing net and taken by the military. She was killed, unintentionally, by Xander. Her spirit eventually contacts Helen from the merpeople's version of the spirit world.\n*[[Rena Owen]] as Helen Hawkins, an eccentric woman who seems to know much more about the merfolk than she claims. It is revealed that she is descended from merfolk and shares ancestry with Ben and the other Pownalls. She eventually learns that she has a long-lost relative from the Marzdan family, most of whom are known as hybrids. She discovers that her mother Daphne was one of the merpeople/human hybrids who was promised to fellow hybrid Johnathon Rooney, but had chosen Helen's human father instead. This resulted in the death of Mr. Hawkins, a few weeks before Helen was born. She is eventually contacted by the spirit of her merman love Sarge and, later, Donna's.\n*Tiffany Lonsdale as Tia (season 3),<ref name=\"TL\"/> a new mermaid from another colony/tribe of the northern seas around Bristol Cove, Washington.

Levi killed Xander's father Captain Sean McClure per Katrina's command in retribution for humans detaining and torturing Donna.\n*Aylya Marzolf as Katrina, a mermaid alpha leader who was twice defeated by Ryn in combat. She is the most fierce and independent of the colony, displaying brute force against both humans and mermaids if need be. It is later revealed that she was separated from Tia's own colony/tribe as an infant, and raised by Ryn and Donna's colony. \n*Hugo Ateo as Frank, better known as Sarge, a merman protector who becomes infatuated with Helen Hawkins and she with him.

Wanting to conceive a full-blooded merperson to ensure the survival of their colony/tribe and others, Ryn had taught him how to copulate as humans do. With aid from Helen, his sperm was taken and secretly implanted in Meredith's womb, from which his and Ryn's mermaid daughter is delivered albeit with difficulty.\n\n===Human/Merpeople Hybrids===\nWhen humans and merpeople secretly mated over the centuries, they produce children with a varied blend of bloodlines, from one-eighth, to one-quarter, to half of both species. In addition to Helen, the following characters are:\n\n*Daphne Hawkins, the late mother of Helen who had a very close kinship with John Rooney and was betrothed to him to keep the merpeople-human bloodline going. She had fallen in love with a human man, which was forbidden and considered a betrayal of the tribe. In a desperate attempt to hide, she had written to Ted Pownall's grandmother and asked if she and her husband could stay in the family cottage since she was pregnant with Helen. Unfortunately, Caleb Pownall was enraged and started a fire that killed Mr. Hawkins immediately. \n*Jonathon \"John\" Rooney, the intended of Daphne who was passed over for Mr. Hawkins.

Just like her, he has merfolk blood in him.\n*[[Caroline Cave]] as Elizabeth \"Beth\" Marzdan, a long-lost blood relative of Helen and the estranged sister of Rick who leads a community of human/merpeople hybrids.\n*[[Daniel Cudmore]] as Ryan, a human/merman hybrid, husband of Leena, and father of Meredith, who is associated with Beth and can act hostile towards the Pownalls for their connection to Charles Pownall. When Ryn comes to ask help to have a baby, Ryan arranges for her unborn child to be secretly implanted into his daughter's uterus. After some weeks Meredith suffers from great pain but Ryan refuses to move her to a hospital so, his wife Leena, asks for Ryn's help. When Ryn, along with Cami, arrives at Ryan's house, she stays with Meredith while Cami kills Ryan, when he enters in the house.\n*Kaaren de Zilva as Dr. Leena, personal physician and secretly the wife of Ryan and mother of Meredith. She secretly injected the embryo of Ryn's unborn child into her daughter in an attempt to have a full-blooded merperson grandchild of her own.\n*Kiomi Pyke as Meredith, the secret daughter of Ryan and Dr. Leena who had the embryo of Ryn's unborn child implanted into her uterus in order for her parents to have a full-blooded merperson grandchild of they own. She expressed doubts at what would happen to her carrying a child that is not hers.\n\n===Guest===\n*[[Brian Anthony Wilson]] as Sean McClure, Xander's father and captain of the fishing motorboat ''The North Star''.

Marine biologists Ben ([[Alex Roe]]) and Maddie (Fola Evans-Akingbola) work together to find out who and what drove this primal hunter of the deep sea to land.\n\nBy Season Two, more merpeople started appearing in Bristol Cove due to the pollution in the nearby waters and the sonic waves from the oil rig. Additionally, Elaine Pownall's paralysis is gradually being counteracted by Ryn's mermaid stem cells.\n\nIn Season Three, Ben, Maddie and Ryn contend with the mermaid Tia who plans to coerce all merpeople tribes/colonies to join her in her fight to overthrow humanity.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n*[[Alex Roe]] as Ben Pownall, a marine biologist who helps Ryn and is entranced by her melodious, irresistibly hypnotic siren song and becomes her lover. \n*[[Eline Powell]] as Ryn Fisher, a strange young adult mermaid with a dark secret.

She discovers that her mother Daphne was one of the merpeople/human hybrids who was promised to fellow hybrid Johnathon Rooney, but had chosen Helen's human father instead.

Ryn's older sister and Chris, a crew member and fisherman on board Bristol Cove's well-known fishing boat ''the North Star'', were captured by the military.

Tommy arranges for Maria's teenage daughter Madison to stay with her daughter Kate, as she is presently living in a hotel room after a recent divorce. Kate despises her mother for putting her career before her, but agrees to help. Tommy comes under pressure from Arturo Lopez, a powerful businessman and ally to Mayor Buddy Gray, to cover up the truth: he brought Maria into the country as a 15-year old, raped her, and that Madison is his daughter. Tommy learns that Lopez will likely get away with his crimes unless Maria testifies against him, and that because she is dependent on the money he provides her with, will almost certainly return to him and allow Madison to be victimized as well. She arranges for Maria and her child to be put into witness protection and orders Lopez's arrest. Kate asks Tommy to move in with her as her marriage is in dire straits and she wants a chance for the two to reconcile. \n |LineColor       = 5DC5FF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = There Are No Strangers Here\n |DirectedBy      = PJ Pesce\n |WrittenBy       = Tom Szentgyorgyi\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|2|13}}\n |Viewers         = 4.41<ref name=\"1.02\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-thursday-cable-originals-network-finals-2-13-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Thursday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 2.13.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=February 14, 2020|website=[[Showbuzz Daily]]|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Officer Eddie Guzman is found dead at the scene of what appears to be an ambush. Tommy insists that the case be handled delicately, angering some officers who want the LAPD to retaliate while her predecessor, Milton Leakey, attacks her in the media as soft and incompetent. Mayor Grey is informed that Lopez is willing to cut a deal with the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. attorney]] in exchange for lesser charges. He asks Blake to try and figure out what Lopez is offering. Tommy personally meets with a civilian who filed a complaint against Guzman; she also gives him her card and asks him to contact her office if another cop assaults him. Ken and Donn gather evidence suggesting Guzman was depressed, and that his father, retired cop Alex Guzman, was seen near the scene of his death. Tommy visits Alex and reveals the truth: his son killed himself and he faked the ambush to protect him from the disgrace of suicide. Leakey, embarrassed, agrees to help Tommy by raising funds to take care of Eddie's wife. Blake is informed by Ken that Lopez was murdered by his fellow inmates.

When Shaw dies from his injuries, his wife and friends put pressure on the city to have the case wrapped up quickly. Owens' lawyer goes on offense by claiming that Shaw had a history of sexual misconduct, which piques Tommy's interest. She personally sits in on an interrogation and determines that Tara is telling the truth, but is also hiding something. Mayor Grey reaches out to Blake for her advice and possibly her assistance in handling an impending separation from his wife. Tara's old boss, Walker, tells Diaz and his partner that Tara may have had a previous relationship with Shaw, but when Tommy looks into it, she discovers that he fired her after she told him that Shaw raped her. This information is turned over to the prosecution, who agree to drop all charges against Tara.

Tommy's efforts to find the bomber and thwart the attack are thrown into disarray when a mudslide strikes a major highway, Luna goes missing, and a youth program needs her to deliver remarks. On top of that, her chief tech Decker insists that Nemesis--a system that gathers private data for the detection of threats and suspects--be used to find the bomber without first getting a warrant. Tommy has academy trainees handle the mudslide, sends Diaz and Ken to find Luna, and asks Blake to address the youths. She also requests a warrant to utilize Nemesis, but when the request is denied, she decides not to use it. By setting a trap for the bomber, the LAPD is able to neutralize the bomb in time for the summit to successfully conclude. Diaz and Ken find Luna, while Decker informs Tommy he will resign as he feels she doesn't respect his concerns. Ken and Diaz find Luna, but Kate tells her mother that while's she grateful, a part of her will never forgive her putting the lives of others before family.

Tommy needs two votes on the city council to pass a measure adding new officers; she tasks Ken with obtaining the vote of Councilwoman Cordero while she works on Councilman Peet. Cordero trades her vote for a seat on the police commission, but Peet refuses to support the measure without the approval of his close friend, Leakey. Rather than give in to Leakey's exorbitant demands for the vote, Tommy lets the measure die. The gunman releases the hostages, but keeps Blake so he can kill him. Tommy intervenes by personally informing the gunman that Blake's remaining assets will be seized to pay back the people he stole from, and the gunman surrenders.

Investigators are able to trace the kidnapping to a brothel, and find a suspect. Tommy uses her intuition to determine that the suspect is Clara's real mother; her baby was taken from her and given to the couple by traffickers. Keller insults Diaz, daring him to fight back, but fails when Diaz brushes him aside. The suspect leads the police to her baby, and the couple agree to give up their parental rights and provide the financial support the child and her mother will need.

Tommy arranges for Maria's teenage daughter Madison to stay with her daughter Kate, as she is presently living in a hotel room after a recent divorce. Kate despises her mother for putting her career before her, but agrees to help. Tommy comes under pressure from Arturo Lopez, a powerful businessman and ally to Mayor Buddy Gray, to cover up the truth: he brought Maria into the country as a 15-year old, raped her, and that Madison is his daughter. Tommy learns that Lopez will likely get away with his crimes unless Maria testifies against him, and that because she is dependent on the money he provides her with, will almost certainly return to him and allow Madison to be victimized as well. She arranges for Maria and her child to be put into witness protection and orders Lopez's arrest. Kate asks Tommy to move in with her as her marriage is in dire straits and she wants a chance for the two to reconcile. \n |LineColor       = 5DC5FF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = There Are No Strangers Here\n |DirectedBy      = PJ Pesce\n |WrittenBy       = Tom Szentgyorgyi\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|2|13}}\n |Viewers         = 4.41<ref name=\"1.02\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-thursday-cable-originals-network-finals-2-13-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Thursday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 2.13.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=February 14, 2020|website=[[Showbuzz Daily]]|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Officer Eddie Guzman is found dead at the scene of what appears to be an ambush. Tommy insists that the case be handled delicately, angering some officers who want the LAPD to retaliate while her predecessor, Milton Leakey, attacks her in the media as soft and incompetent. Mayor Grey is informed that Lopez is willing to cut a deal with the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. attorney]] in exchange for lesser charges. He asks Blake to try and figure out what Lopez is offering. Tommy personally meets with a civilian who filed a complaint against Guzman; she also gives him her card and asks him to contact her office if another cop assaults him. Ken and Donn gather evidence suggesting Guzman was depressed, and that his father, retired cop Alex Guzman, was seen near the scene of his death. Tommy visits Alex and reveals the truth: his son killed himself and he faked the ambush to protect him from the disgrace of suicide. Leakey, embarrassed, agrees to help Tommy by raising funds to take care of Eddie's wife. Blake is informed by Ken that Lopez was murdered by his fellow inmates.

When Shaw dies from his injuries, his wife and friends put pressure on the city to have the case wrapped up quickly. Owens' lawyer goes on offense by claiming that Shaw had a history of sexual misconduct, which piques Tommy's interest. She personally sits in on an interrogation and determines that Tara is telling the truth, but is also hiding something. Mayor Grey reaches out to Blake for her advice and possibly her assistance in handling an impending separation from his wife. Tara's old boss, Walker, tells Diaz and his partner that Tara may have had a previous relationship with Shaw, but when Tommy looks into it, she discovers that he fired her after she told him that Shaw raped her. This information is turned over to the prosecution, who agree to drop all charges against Tara.

On top of that, her chief tech Decker insists that Nemesis--a system that gathers private data for the detection of threats and suspects--be used to find the bomber without first getting a warrant. Tommy has academy trainees handle the mudslide, sends Diaz and Ken to find Luna, and asks Blake to address the youths.

By setting a trap for the bomber, the LAPD is able to neutralize the bomb in time for the summit to successfully conclude.

Rather than give in to Leakey's exorbitant demands for the vote, Tommy lets the measure die. The gunman releases the hostages, but keeps Blake so he can kill him. Tommy intervenes by personally informing the gunman that Blake's remaining assets will be seized to pay back the people he stole from, and the gunman surrenders.

Investigators are able to trace the kidnapping to a brothel, and find a suspect. Tommy uses her intuition to determine that the suspect is Clara's real mother; her baby was taken from her and given to the couple by traffickers. Keller insults Diaz, daring him to fight back, but fails when Diaz brushes him aside.

Its [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]] extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering {{convert|9.98|e6km2|e6sqmi|2|abbr=off}}, making it the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by area|second-largest country by total area]]. Its southern [[Canada\u2013United States border|border with the United States]], stretching {{convert|8891|km|mi}}, is the world's longest bi-national land border. Canada's capital is [[Ottawa]], and its three [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|largest metropolitan areas]] are [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]], and [[Vancouver]].\n\nVarious [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada]] for thousands of years before European colonization. Beginning in the 16th century, [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of [[Military history of Canada|various armed conflicts]], France ceded nearly all of [[New France|its colonies in North America]] in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three [[British North America]]n colonies through [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], Canada was formed as a [[federalism|federal]] [[British Dominions|dominion]] of four provinces. This began an [[Territorial evolution of Canada|accretion of provinces and territories]] and a process of increasing autonomy from the [[United Kingdom]]. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the ''[[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]]'' of 1931 and culminated in the ''[[Canada Act 1982|Canada Act]]'' of 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the [[British parliament]].\n\nCanada is a [[parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] in the [[Westminster system|Westminster tradition]], with a [[Monarchy of Canada|monarch]] and a [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]] who serves as the chair of the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]] and [[Government of Canada|head of government]]. The country is a [[Commonwealth realm|realm]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a member of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophonie]] and [[Official bilingualism in Canada|officially bilingual]] at the federal level. It [[International rankings of Canada|ranks among the highest]] in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, [[economic freedom]], and education. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and [[Multiculturalism in Canada|multicultural]] nations, the product of [[Immigration to Canada|large-scale immigration]] from many other countries. Canada's [[Canada\u2013United States relations|long and complex relationship]] with the United States has had a significant impact on its [[Economy of Canada|economy]] and [[Culture of Canada|culture]].\n\nA [[developed country]], Canada has the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|seventeenth-highest nominal per-capita income globally]] as well as the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|thirteenth-highest]] ranking in the [[Human Development Index]].

Its [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]] extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering {{convert|9.98|e6km2|e6sqmi|2|abbr=off}}, making it the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by area|second-largest country by total area]]. Its southern [[Canada\u2013United States border|border with the United States]], stretching {{convert|8891|km|mi}}, is the world's longest bi-national land border. Canada's capital is [[Ottawa]], and its three [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|largest metropolitan areas]] are [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]], and [[Vancouver]].\n\nVarious [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada]] for thousands of years before European colonization. Beginning in the 16th century, [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of [[Military history of Canada|various armed conflicts]], France ceded nearly all of [[New France|its colonies in North America]] in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three [[British North America]]n colonies through [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], Canada was formed as a [[federalism|federal]] [[British Dominions|dominion]] of four provinces. This began an [[Territorial evolution of Canada|accretion of provinces and territories]] and a process of increasing autonomy from the [[United Kingdom]]. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the ''[[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]]'' of 1931 and culminated in the ''[[Canada Act 1982|Canada Act]]'' of 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the [[British parliament]].\n\nCanada is a [[parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] in the [[Westminster system|Westminster tradition]], with a [[Monarchy of Canada|monarch]] and a [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]] who serves as the chair of the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]] and [[Government of Canada|head of government]]. The country is a [[Commonwealth realm|realm]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a member of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophonie]] and [[Official bilingualism in Canada|officially bilingual]] at the federal level. It [[International rankings of Canada|ranks among the highest]] in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, [[economic freedom]], and education. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and [[Multiculturalism in Canada|multicultural]] nations, the product of [[Immigration to Canada|large-scale immigration]] from many other countries. Canada's [[Canada\u2013United States relations|long and complex relationship]] with the United States has had a significant impact on its [[Economy of Canada|economy]] and [[Culture of Canada|culture]].\n\nA [[developed country]], Canada has the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|seventeenth-highest nominal per-capita income globally]] as well as the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|thirteenth-highest]] ranking in the [[Human Development Index]]. Its advanced economy is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|tenth-largest in the world]], relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[Group of Seven|G7]], the [[Group of Ten (economics)|Group of Ten]], the [[G20]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] and the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] forum.\n\n==Etymology==\n<!--linked-->\n{{Main|Name of Canada}}<!--Please see the talk page before editing this to specify which languages produced the word Canada.
