Nonetheless, tobacco is unpalatable to many species and therefore some tobacco plants (chiefly tree tobacco, ''[[Nicotiana glauca|N. glauca]]'') have become established as [[invasive species]] in some places.\n\nIn the 19th century, young tobacco plantings came under increasing attack from [[flea beetle]]s (''[[Epitrix cucumeris]]'' and/or ''[[Epitrix pubescens]]''), causing destruction of half the United States tobacco crop in 1876. In the years afterward, many experiments were attempted and discussed to control the flea beetle. By 1880, it was discovered that covering young plants with a frame covered with thin fabric (instead of with branches, as had previously been used for frost control) would effectively protect plants from the beetle. This practice spread until it became ubiquitous in the 1890s.\n\n[[Lepidoptera]] whose [[caterpillar]]s feed on ''Nicotiana'' include:\n\n* [[Dark sword-grass]] or black cutworm, ''Agrotis ipsilon''\n* [[Turnip moth]], ''Agrotis segetum''\n* [[Mouse moth]], ''Amphipyra tragopoginis''\n* [[Nutmeg (moth)|The nutmeg]], ''Discestra trifolii''\n* ''[[Endoclita excrescens]]''\n* [[Manduca blackburni|Blackburn's sphinx moth]], ''Manduca blackburni''\n* [[Manduca sexta|Tobacco hornworm]], ''Manduca sexta''\n* [[Manduca quinquemaculata|Tomato hornworm]], ''Manduca quinquemaculata''\n* [[Cabbage moth]], ''Mamestra brassicae''\n* [[Angle shades]], ''Phlogophora meticulosa''\n* [[Setaceous Hebrew character]], ''Xestia c-nigrum''\n* [[Cabbage looper]], ''Trichoplusia ni''<ref>United States.

Nonetheless, tobacco is unpalatable to many species and therefore some tobacco plants (chiefly tree tobacco, ''[[Nicotiana glauca|N. glauca]]'') have become established as [[invasive species]] in some places.\n\nIn the 19th century, young tobacco plantings came under increasing attack from [[flea beetle]]s (''[[Epitrix cucumeris]]'' and/or ''[[Epitrix pubescens]]''), causing destruction of half the United States tobacco crop in 1876. In the years afterward, many experiments were attempted and discussed to control the flea beetle. By 1880, it was discovered that covering young plants with a frame covered with thin fabric (instead of with branches, as had previously been used for frost control) would effectively protect plants from the beetle.

The identity and whereabouts of Pearl's unseen mother have never been explained directly by the characters.

She has been featured frequently in a variety of merchandise, such as [[plush toy]]s and [[video game]]s, and at amusement park attractions.

S. Ravikumar]], and featuring [[Sivaji Ganesan]], [[Rajinikanth]], [[Ramya Krishnan]] and [[Soundarya]] in the lead roles, with [[Abbas (actor)|Abbas]], [[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]], [[Radha Ravi]] and [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] in supporting roles. The [[soundtrack album]] and [[background music|background score]] were composed by [[A. R. Rahman]].\n\nThe plot revolves around Padayappa (Rajinikanth), an engineer whose father (Sivaji Ganesan) dies of shock soon after he is defrauded and loses his property to his foster brother ([[Manivannan]]). Neelambari (Ramya Krishnan) initially loves Padayappa, but plans to take revenge on him and his love interest Vasundhara (Soundarya) after his family humiliates her father (Radha Ravi). The rest of the story deals with Padayappa climbing back to financial success and arranging his daughters' marriage while overcoming all the obstacles placed by Neelambari.\n\nPrincipal photography for the film began in October 1998. ''Padayappa'' was released on 10 April 1999 on the eve of [[Puthandu|Tamil New Year's Day]]. This was the first Tamil film to be released worldwide with 210 [[Publishing|prints]] and 700,000 audio cassettes. It became [[Tamil cinema]]'s highest-grossing film at that point. Ramya Krishnan's performance was praised, winning her a [[Filmfare Awards South|Filmfare Award]] under the [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Best Actress]] category. The film also won five [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards]].padayappa collected 58 crores in world wide\n\n== Plot ==\nPadayappa is a mechanical engineer who returns to his village after three years to attend his sister's wedding. Padayappa's family have been the richest landlords of their village and chieftains for their region. Padayappa's great grandfather had decreed all Hindu marriages in their region must take place in the Murugan temple, after the chieftain has verbally confirmed the consent from bride and groom. This tradition has been followed for 100 years and now Padayappa's father is the chieftain. Padayappa's younger sister is engaged to their maternal cousin Suryaprakash. During his stay, he comes across Vasundhara, and falls in love with her. However, shyness and fear of Neelambari whose family employs her and her mother as servants, prevents Vasundhara from initially expressing her feelings. Neelambari is Suryaprakash's spoilt US-returned sister who also loves Padayappa.\n\nUnexpectedly, Padayappa's father's foster brother demands half share in the family property, citing Padayappa's father's donations to the poor are draining the family resources and he himself has three children to take care of. Padayappa's father abruptly refuses to divide the property and instead gives the entire property to his foster brother. This forces Padayappa's family to leave their home, to a plot of land bought using Padayappa's salary. Unable to bear this shock, Padayappa's father dies at the entrance of the house. Suryaprakash silently cancels his wedding with Padayappa's sister and marries the daughter of Padayappa's father's foster brother, who now owns the property of Padayappa's father.\n\nMeanwhile, Padayappa discovers that a hill on his newly purchased property is composed of solid [[granite]], which allows him to start a granite business, from which he becomes exponentially rich. He uses the money to help the poor in his village, and provide them jobs. As his business flourishes, his family is able to once again settle down. Padayappa assumes his father's position as the village chieftain, and his sister gets married to one of the engineers who work in his company. When Neelambari learns about Padayappa's love for Vasundhara, she becomes jealous of her, and her parents beg Padayappa's widowed mother to allow Neelambari to marry Padayappa. However, to everyone's surprise, Padayappa's mother humiliates Padayappa's maternal uncle in front of the entire village when she agrees to a marriage between Padayappa and Vasundhara with Vasundhara's mother, her brother's servant. Unable to bear the humiliation, Padayappa's maternal uncle commits suicide.\n\nWhen Neelambari tries to kill Vasundhara by letting a bull loose on her, Padayappa saves her. Neelambari tries to poison Vasundhara, which fails after a snake knocks down the milk she poisons. Afterwards, Padayappa and Vasundhara marry. After the wedding, Neelambari locks herself in a room in Suryaprakash's house, thinking only about Padayappa for 18 years, during which Suryaprakash becomes the state's home minister. In between, Padayappa finds his father's foster brother in trouble financially as he was pulled out of the family house by a financier Krishnasamy Mudaliar, from whom he had borrowed money on interest. Padayappa helps his father's foster brother, who in turn becomes indebted to him and seeks Padayappa's pardon for his misdeeds; Padayappa forgives him.\n\nNeelambari plans her revenge on Padayappa, now a father of two daughters. Suryaprakash also has a son, Chandru, who studies at the same college as Padayappa's elder daughter, Anitha. Neelambari advises Chandru to make Anitha fall in love with him. At the same time, Padayappa plans to get Anitha married to his sister's son. Neelambari, having made Chandru pretend to fall in love with Anitha, plans to humiliate Padayappa by making Anitha say that she does not wish to marry a groom of her parents' choice and that she is in love with someone else. At the marriage ceremony, after Anitha does what Neelambari told her, Padayappa makes an oath to unite Anitha with her lover by the next ''[[Muhurta]]'' day, or commit suicide. Padayappa discovers that Chandru really did fall in love with Anitha even though he was only initially pretending to do so on Neelambari's advise. When Padayappa takes Chandru and Anitha to the temple to get married, Neelambari and Suryaprakash give chase to stop them. Suryaprakash is killed in a car accident during the chase.\n\nArmed with a [[machine gun]], Neelambari reaches the temple where Chandru and Anitha are married. When she tries to kill Padayappa, he saves her life by preventing a bull from attacking her, while at the same time dodging the bullets she fires at him. Rather than live with the humiliation of knowing she was unsuccessful in avenging her father's death, as well as having her life saved by her enemy, Neelambari commits suicide, promising to take revenge on Padayappa in her next birth. Padayappa prays for her soul to be at peace and eventually attain salvation.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- In order of the film's opening credits -->\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Sivaji Ganesan]] as Padayappa's father\n* [[Rajinikanth]] as Aarupadayappan (Padayappa)\n* [[Ramya Krishnan]] as Neelambari\n* [[Soundarya]] as Vasundhara\n* [[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]] as Padayappa's mother\n* [[Sithara (actress)|Sithara]] as Padayappa's sister\n* [[Radha Ravi]] as Neelambari's father\n* [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] as Suryaprakash, Neelambari's brother<!-- https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/692128 -->\n* [[Manivannan]] as Padayappa's father's foster brother\n* [[Senthil]] as Azhagesan\n* [[Abbas (actor)|Abbas]] as Chandraprakash aka Chandru\n* [[Preetha Vijayakumar|Preetha]] as Anitha\n* [[Anu Mohan (Tamil actor)|Anu Mohan]] as Chinnarasu\n* [[Ramesh Khanna]] as Murugesan\n* [[Vadivukkarasi]] as Vasundhara's mother\n* [[Sathyapriya]] as Neelambari's mother\n* [[Mansoor Ali Khan (actor)|Mansoor Ali Khan]] as Krishnasamy Mudaliar\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Subramaniam\n* [[Vasu Vikram]] as Padayappa's cousin\n* [[Raja Ravindra]] as Padayappa's cousin\n* [[Lavanya (actress)|Lavanya]] as Suryaprakash's wife\n* [[Kanal Kannan]] as a farmer told by Neelambari to kill the snake\n* [[Mohan Raman]] as the lawyer\n* [[Ravi Raghavendra]] as Ravi Chellaiah\n* [[Kovai Senthil]] as a village man<!--https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/actor-kovai-senthil-passes-away-in-coimbatore/articleshow/65749144.cms-->\n* [[K.

S. Ravikumar]], and featuring [[Sivaji Ganesan]], [[Rajinikanth]], [[Ramya Krishnan]] and [[Soundarya]] in the lead roles, with [[Abbas (actor)|Abbas]], [[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]], [[Radha Ravi]] and [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] in supporting roles. The [[soundtrack album]] and [[background music|background score]] were composed by [[A. R. Rahman]].\n\nThe plot revolves around Padayappa (Rajinikanth), an engineer whose father (Sivaji Ganesan) dies of shock soon after he is defrauded and loses his property to his foster brother ([[Manivannan]]). Neelambari (Ramya Krishnan) initially loves Padayappa, but plans to take revenge on him and his love interest Vasundhara (Soundarya) after his family humiliates her father (Radha Ravi). The rest of the story deals with Padayappa climbing back to financial success and arranging his daughters' marriage while overcoming all the obstacles placed by Neelambari.\n\nPrincipal photography for the film began in October 1998. ''Padayappa'' was released on 10 April 1999 on the eve of [[Puthandu|Tamil New Year's Day]]. This was the first Tamil film to be released worldwide with 210 [[Publishing|prints]] and 700,000 audio cassettes. It became [[Tamil cinema]]'s highest-grossing film at that point. Ramya Krishnan's performance was praised, winning her a [[Filmfare Awards South|Filmfare Award]] under the [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Best Actress]] category. The film also won five [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards]].\n\n== Plot ==\nPadayappa is a mechanical engineer who returns to his village after three years to attend his sister's wedding. Padayappa's family have been the richest landlords of their village and chieftains for their region. Padayappa's great grandfather had decreed all Hindu marriages in their region must take place in the Murugan temple, after the chieftain has verbally confirmed the consent from bride and groom. This tradition has been followed for 100 years and now Padayappa's father is the chieftain. Padayappa's younger sister is engaged to their maternal cousin Suryaprakash. During his stay, he comes across Vasundhara, and falls in love with her. However, shyness and fear of Neelambari whose family employs her and her mother as servants, prevents Vasundhara from initially expressing her feelings. Neelambari is Suryaprakash's spoilt US-returned sister who also loves Padayappa.\n\nUnexpectedly, Padayappa's father's foster brother demands half share in the family property, citing Padayappa's father's donations to the poor are draining the family resources and he himself has three children to take care of. Padayappa's father abruptly refuses to divide the property and instead gives the entire property to his foster brother. This forces Padayappa's family to leave their home, to a plot of land bought using Padayappa's salary. Unable to bear this shock, Padayappa's father dies at the entrance of the house. Suryaprakash silently cancels his wedding with Padayappa's sister and marries the daughter of Padayappa's father's foster brother, who now owns the property of Padayappa's father.\n\nMeanwhile, Padayappa discovers that a hill on his newly purchased property is composed of solid [[granite]], which allows him to start a granite business, from which he becomes exponentially rich. He uses the money to help the poor in his village, and provide them jobs. As his business flourishes, his family is able to once again settle down. Padayappa assumes his father's position as the village chieftain, and his sister gets married to one of the engineers who work in his company. When Neelambari learns about Padayappa's love for Vasundhara, she becomes jealous of her, and her parents beg Padayappa's widowed mother to allow Neelambari to marry Padayappa. However, to everyone's surprise, Padayappa's mother humiliates Padayappa's maternal uncle in front of the entire village when she agrees to a marriage between Padayappa and Vasundhara with Vasundhara's mother, her brother's servant. Unable to bear the humiliation, Padayappa's maternal uncle commits suicide.\n\nWhen Neelambari tries to kill Vasundhara by letting a bull loose on her, Padayappa saves her. Neelambari tries to poison Vasundhara, which fails after a snake knocks down the milk she poisons. Afterwards, Padayappa and Vasundhara marry. After the wedding, Neelambari locks herself in a room in Suryaprakash's house, thinking only about Padayappa for 18 years, during which Suryaprakash becomes the state's home minister. In between, Padayappa finds his father's foster brother in trouble financially as he was pulled out of the family house by a financier Krishnasamy Mudaliar, from whom he had borrowed money on interest. Padayappa helps his father's foster brother, who in turn becomes indebted to him and seeks Padayappa's pardon for his misdeeds; Padayappa forgives him.\n\nNeelambari plans her revenge on Padayappa, now a father of two daughters. Suryaprakash also has a son, Chandru, who studies at the same college as Padayappa's elder daughter, Anitha. Neelambari advises Chandru to make Anitha fall in love with him. At the same time, Padayappa plans to get Anitha married to his sister's son. Neelambari, having made Chandru pretend to fall in love with Anitha, plans to humiliate Padayappa by making Anitha say that she does not wish to marry a groom of her parents' choice and that she is in love with someone else. At the marriage ceremony, after Anitha does what Neelambari told her, Padayappa makes an oath to unite Anitha with her lover by the next ''[[Muhurta]]'' day, or commit suicide. Padayappa discovers that Chandru really did fall in love with Anitha even though he was only initially pretending to do so on Neelambari's advise. When Padayappa takes Chandru and Anitha to the temple to get married, Neelambari and Suryaprakash give chase to stop them. Suryaprakash is killed in a car accident during the chase.\n\nArmed with a [[machine gun]], Neelambari reaches the temple where Chandru and Anitha are married. When she tries to kill Padayappa, he saves her life by preventing a bull from attacking her, while at the same time dodging the bullets she fires at him. Rather than live with the humiliation of knowing she was unsuccessful in avenging her father's death, as well as having her life saved by her enemy, Neelambari commits suicide, promising to take revenge on Padayappa in her next birth. Padayappa prays for her soul to be at peace and eventually attain salvation.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- In order of the film's opening credits -->\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Sivaji Ganesan]] as Padayappa's father\n* [[Rajinikanth]] as Aarupadayappan (Padayappa)\n* [[Ramya Krishnan]] as Neelambari\n* [[Soundarya]] as Vasundhara\n* [[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]] as Padayappa's mother\n* [[Sithara (actress)|Sithara]] as Padayappa's sister\n* [[Radha Ravi]] as Neelambari's father\n* [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] as Suryaprakash, Neelambari's brother<!-- https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/692128 -->\n* [[Manivannan]] as Padayappa's father's foster brother\n* [[Senthil]] as Azhagesan\n* [[Abbas (actor)|Abbas]] as Chandraprakash aka Chandru\n* [[Preetha Vijayakumar|Preetha]] as Anitha\n* [[Anu Mohan (Tamil actor)|Anu Mohan]] as Chinnarasu\n* [[Ramesh Khanna]] as Murugesan\n* [[Vadivukkarasi]] as Vasundhara's mother\n* [[Sathyapriya]] as Neelambari's mother\n* [[Mansoor Ali Khan (actor)|Mansoor Ali Khan]] as Krishnasamy Mudaliar\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Subramaniam\n* [[Vasu Vikram]] as Padayappa's cousin\n* [[Raja Ravindra]] as Padayappa's cousin\n* [[Lavanya (actress)|Lavanya]] as Suryaprakash's wife\n* [[Kanal Kannan]] as a farmer told by Neelambari to kill the snake\n* [[Mohan Raman]] as the lawyer\n* [[Ravi Raghavendra]] as Ravi Chellaiah\n* [[Kovai Senthil]] as a village man<!--https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/actor-kovai-senthil-passes-away-in-coimbatore/articleshow/65749144.cms-->\n* [[K.

Telugu version titled ''Pandem Kodi 2'' was simultaneously released.Sandakozhi2 received highly negative reviews from both critics and audience. And became flop at box office.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe film begins 10 years later after the events which occurred in the prequel ''[[Sandakozhi]]''.\n\nVillagers of the eight village circle in Theni district plan to conduct their annual grand temple festival after failing to do so for eight years.The Grand Chieftain of 8 villages, respected Durai Ayya ([[Rajkiran]]) ensures that the festival goes on smoothly, as there could be trouble from Pechankarasi alias Pechi ([[Varalaxmi Sarathkumar]]) and her brothers. Pechi's family is a distant relative of Durai and the chieftain family of one the eight villages. A small flashback eight years ago in the previous Grand festival, is shown where Pechi\u2019s husband ([[Kabali Vishwanth]]) and his friends mistake an unfortunate accident as an insult by another village person of lower caste and later kills him. Instead, that villagers kill Pechi's husband on the same day in front of Pechi. She wants to hunt down all the males of the clan of the murderer as revenge. Everyone is killed on the same day except for 18 year Anbu (Hari Krishnan), who is accidentally saved by Durai. Pechi waits for an opportunity to kill Anbu in the next festival, while Durai's men safeguard him and pay for his education . The flashback ends there.\n\nBalakumaran alias Balu ([[Vishal (actor)|Vishal]]), the only son of Durai, returns from USA after seven years to his village and understands the situation in his village. Pechi sets the stage to kill Anbu during the temple festival, and he is constantly saved by Balu. Meanwhile, there is Sembaruthi ([[Keerthy Suresh]]), whose activities remind Balu of his ex-lover Hema ([[Meera Jasmine]]), who died unfortunately before their scheduled marriage. Despite regretting it, Balu falls for Sembaruthi, for which she reciprocates. Durai agrees to this match, but conveys it to Sembaruthi directly.\n\nAs per Durai's wishes, Anbu's UPSC attempt becomes successful, and Durai and Anbu go alone to Anbu's village to convey the result. Pechi\u2019s men waylay them and try to attack Anbu, but Durai accidentally gets stabbed in his neck. Balu rushes and saves Durai, who receives clandestine treatment in his home. Durai requests Balu to not inform the incident to villagers, as this would result in fights and would eventually spoil the temple festival. Balu promises his comatose father that he would save Anbu as well as ensure that the festival ends smoothly.\n\nFinally, Pechi and Balu meet in an open ground, where Pechi beats up Balu. Balu does not want to hurt Pechi and asks her to leave Anbu, for which she does not agree. When Pechi was about to kill Anbu with a sickle, her chain gets stuck in a trishul, and she accidentally loses control. Her sickle moves towards her only son's neck, but Balu holds the sickle and saves him. Pechi then realizes her grave error and decides to spare Anbu. She starts to cry and it starts to rain in the area after the 7-year drought. Durai and The villagers rejoice the end of their misfortunes.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vishal (actor)|Vishal]] as Balu\n* [[Varalaxmi Sarathkumar]] as Pechankarasi (Pechi)\n* [[Keerthy Suresh]] as [[Sembaruthi]]\n* [[Rajkiran]] as Durai Ayya\n* [[Hari Krishnan]] as Anbu\n* [[Ramdoss]] as Murugan\n* [[Ganja Karuppu]] as Durai's servant\n* [[Thennavan (actor)|Thennavan]] as Durai's brother-in-law\n* [[Shanmugarajan]] as Durai's brother-in-law\n* [[Hareesh Peradi]] as Karumayi\n* Ashwanth as Sembaruthi Brother\n* [[G.

Telugu version titled ''Pandem Kodi 2'' was simultaneously released.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe film begins 10 years later after the events which occurred in the prequel ''[[Sandakozhi]]''.\n\nVillagers of the eight village circle in Theni district plan to conduct their annual grand temple festival after failing to do so for eight years.The Grand Chieftain of 8 villages, respected Durai Ayya ([[Rajkiran]]) ensures that the festival goes on smoothly, as there could be trouble from Pechankarasi alias Pechi ([[Varalaxmi Sarathkumar]]) and her brothers. Pechi's family is a distant relative of Durai and the chieftain family of one the eight villages. A small flashback eight years ago in the previous Grand festival, is shown where Pechi\u2019s husband ([[Kabali Vishwanth]]) and his friends mistake an unfortunate accident as an insult by another village person of lower caste and later kills him. Instead, that villagers kill Pechi's husband on the same day in front of Pechi. She wants to hunt down all the males of the clan of the murderer as revenge. Everyone is killed on the same day except for 18 year Anbu (Hari Krishnan), who is accidentally saved by Durai. Pechi waits for an opportunity to kill Anbu in the next festival, while Durai's men safeguard him and pay for his education . The flashback ends there.\n\nBalakumaran alias Balu ([[Vishal (actor)|Vishal]]), the only son of Durai, returns from USA after seven years to his village and understands the situation in his village. Pechi sets the stage to kill Anbu during the temple festival, and he is constantly saved by Balu. Meanwhile, there is Sembaruthi ([[Keerthy Suresh]]), whose activities remind Balu of his ex-lover Hema ([[Meera Jasmine]]), who died unfortunately before their scheduled marriage. Despite regretting it, Balu falls for Sembaruthi, for which she reciprocates. Durai agrees to this match, but conveys it to Sembaruthi directly.\n\nAs per Durai's wishes, Anbu's UPSC attempt becomes successful, and Durai and Anbu go alone to Anbu's village to convey the result. Pechi\u2019s men waylay them and try to attack Anbu, but Durai accidentally gets stabbed in his neck. Balu rushes and saves Durai, who receives clandestine treatment in his home. Durai requests Balu to not inform the incident to villagers, as this would result in fights and would eventually spoil the temple festival. Balu promises his comatose father that he would save Anbu as well as ensure that the festival ends smoothly.\n\nFinally, Pechi and Balu meet in an open ground, where Pechi beats up Balu. Balu does not want to hurt Pechi and asks her to leave Anbu, for which she does not agree. When Pechi was about to kill Anbu with a sickle, her chain gets stuck in a trishul, and she accidentally loses control. Her sickle moves towards her only son's neck, but Balu holds the sickle and saves him. Pechi then realizes her grave error and decides to spare Anbu. She starts to cry and it starts to rain in the area after the 7-year drought. Durai and The villagers rejoice the end of their misfortunes.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vishal (actor)|Vishal]] as Balu\n* [[Varalaxmi Sarathkumar]] as Pechankarasi (Pechi)\n* [[Keerthy Suresh]] as [[Sembaruthi]]\n* [[Rajkiran]] as Durai Ayya\n* [[Hari Krishnan]] as Anbu\n* [[Ramdoss]] as Murugan\n* [[Ganja Karuppu]] as Durai's servant\n* [[Thennavan (actor)|Thennavan]] as Durai's brother-in-law\n* [[Shanmugarajan]] as Durai's brother-in-law\n* [[Hareesh Peradi]] as Karumayi\n* Ashwanth as Sembaruthi Brother\n* [[G.

The film was produced by [[Kalanithi Maran]] under the banner [[Sun Pictures]]. The film stars [[Rajinikanth]] in the title role. While [[Vijay Sethupathi]], [[Simran (actress)|Simran]], [[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]], [[M. Sasikumar|Sasikumar]], [[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]], [[Bobby Simha]], [[Sananth]], [[Megha Akash]], and [[Malavika Mohanan]] in supporting roles. The music was composed by [[Anirudh Ravichander]] with editing done by [[Vivek Harshan]] and cinematography by [[Tirru]]. The film was released on 10 January 2019.Petta clashed with viswassam. In pongal 2019.but Petta became blockbuster hit in box office.\n\n== Plot ==\nKaali, an elderly man, takes up the job of a boys' [[hostel]] warden at a college in [[Ooty]]. He notices that the hostel is dominated by a group of unruly final-year students, who are led by Michael, the [[spoiled child|spoiled]] son of a local leader named Gnanam. Kaali puts a stop to Michael's antics, which leads to enmity between the two. Kaali also forms a close bond with a [[Non-residential Indian|NRI]] hostelite named Anwar, who is in a relationship with Anu, the daughter of Mangalam, a [[Energy medicine|pranic]] healer. Kaali convinces Mangalam to accept her daughter's relationship with Anwar, and they end up falling in love.\n\nMichael, who lusts for Anu, is angered on hearing of her relationship with Anwar. He attempts to harass them, only to be stopped by Kaali, who ensures the suspension of Michael and his friends, with Anwar recording and sharing the humiliation of Michael and his gang. This video is noticed far away in [[Uttar Pradesh]] by a local goon named Jithu, the son of a powerful politician called Singaaram alias Singaar Singh. Singaar, on seeing Anwar in the video as well as in a photo with his mother on [[Facebook]], sends his men to Ooty to kill Anwar, for unknown reasons. At the same time, Michael, humiliated at his suspension, sends his men to beat up (but not kill) Kaali. Michael's plan backfires as he and his men are caught in the fight between Kaali and Singaar's men. Kaali subdues Singaar's men, earning Michael's and Gnanam's respect, following which Anwar learns about his past.\n\nAnwar is the son of Maalik, who was Kaali's best friend. It is also revealed that Kaali's real name is Petta Velan alias Petta and that he was a well-respected man in his village in [[Madurai district]]. 20 years ago, Maalik was in love with Petta's neighbour Poongodi, who conceived with him out of wedlock. When Petta heard of this, he and his wife Saraswathy alias Saro managed to convince Poongodi's father Rajapandi to get Poongodi married to Maalik, even though Rajapandi and Petta were sworn enemies. But Rajapandi's two sons, Devaaram and Singaar, vehemently opposed the alliance as well as the transfer of property to Poongodi. They then [[patricide|killed their father]]. Petta, on hearing about Rajapandi's murder, killed Devaaram during Rajapandi's funeral and chased Singaar out of the village. As revenge for Devaaram's killing and his forced exile, Singaar orchestrates a bomb blast during Poongodi's [[seemantham]], killing Maalik, Saro, and Petta and Saro's son Chinna. Petta, after finding that Poongodi was still alive, took her to safety. Poongodi later gave birth to a boy, who is revealed to be Anwar, and both of them left for [[Australia]] as refugees to escape from Singaar. On hearing this story, Petta and Anwar, along with Michael's henchmen, leave for Uttar Pradesh to finish off Singaar once and for all.\n\nIn Uttar Pradesh, Petta and Anwar confront Jithu, who is determined to kill them both after learning that his father and Petta are enemies. The duo manage to escape Jithu. Later, Petta meets Jithu privately and tells him that he is none other than his son Chinna, who did not die in the bomb blast, but was adopted by Singaar after finding him still alive in the wreckage of the blast. When Jithu confronts Singaar regarding his parentage, the latter sends his men to kill Jithu, who is rescued by Petta. Along with Anwar and Michael's henchmen, Petta and Jithu then barge into Singaar's mansion and kill him and his henchmen.\n\nFollowing Singaar's death, Petta has a surprise in store for Jithu. He tells him the tale  of [[Rama]] and how he defeated [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]], who had the ability to steal half the power of his opponents when they stood before him. Petta tells him that he did the same to Singaar by stealing half of his power, which was Jithu. Petta tells him the truth: he double-crossed Jithu and Jithu is not his son. The real Chinna had died in the bomb blast 20 years ago and the men sent to kill Jithu were Petta's own and not Singaar's. Petta debates whether to kill or spare Jithu. He dances for a while to the song ''Raman Aandalum'' from ''[[Mullum Malarum]]'' and then points the gun at Jithu. The screen goes black and a gunshot is heard, implying that Petta killed Jithu.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin|}}\n* [[Rajinikanth]] as Petta Velan (Kaali), an elderly man who gets hired as a hostel warden<ref>{{cite news |title=Watch: 'Marana Mass', first single from Rajini's 'Petta', reveals his name to be Kaali |url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/watch-marana-mass-first-single-rajinis-petta-reveals-his-name-be-kaali-92674 |accessdate=2 September 2019 |work=[[The News Minute]] |date=3 December 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Vijay Sethupathi]] as Jithu, a local goon who Petta convinces is his son Chinna<ref>{{cite news |title=Meet Jithu, Vijay Sethupathi's character from Rajinikanth's 'Petta' |url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/meet-jithu-vijay-sethupathis-character-rajinikanths-petta-92759 |accessdate=2 September 2019 |work=[[The News Minute]] |date=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Simran (actress)|Simran]] as Mangalam,a pranic healer ( Kaali's love interest and Anu's mother) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/tamil/petta-quick-review-rajinikanth-5531342/|title=Petta quick review: Thank you Karthik Subbaraj for bringing back the old Rajinikanth|date=10 January 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]] as Saraswathy (Saro), Petta's wife<ref>{{cite news |title=Meet Saro, Trisha's character in Rajini's next 'Petta' |url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/meet-saro-trishas-character-rajini-s-next-petta-93027 |accessdate=2 September 2019 |work=[[The News Minute]] |date=9 December 2018}}</ref>\n* [[M.

The film was produced by [[Kalanithi Maran]] under the banner [[Sun Pictures]]. The film stars [[Rajinikanth]] in the title role. While [[Vijay Sethupathi]], [[Simran (actress)|Simran]], [[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]], [[M. Sasikumar|Sasikumar]], [[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]], [[Bobby Simha]], [[Sananth]], [[Megha Akash]], and [[Malavika Mohanan]] in supporting roles. The music was composed by [[Anirudh Ravichander]] with editing done by [[Vivek Harshan]] and cinematography by [[Tirru]]. The film was released on 10 January 2019.\n\n== Plot ==\nKaali, an elderly man, takes up the job of a boys' [[hostel]] warden at a college in [[Ooty]]. He notices that the hostel is dominated by a group of unruly final-year students, who are led by Michael, the [[spoiled child|spoiled]] son of a local leader named Gnanam. Kaali puts a stop to Michael's antics, which leads to enmity between the two. Kaali also forms a close bond with a [[Non-residential Indian|NRI]] hostelite named Anwar, who is in a relationship with Anu, the daughter of Mangalam, a [[Energy medicine|pranic]] healer. Kaali convinces Mangalam to accept her daughter's relationship with Anwar, and they end up falling in love.\n\nMichael, who lusts for Anu, is angered on hearing of her relationship with Anwar. He attempts to harass them, only to be stopped by Kaali, who ensures the suspension of Michael and his friends, with Anwar recording and sharing the humiliation of Michael and his gang. This video is noticed far away in [[Uttar Pradesh]] by a local goon named Jithu, the son of a powerful politician called Singaaram alias Singaar Singh. Singaar, on seeing Anwar in the video as well as in a photo with his mother on [[Facebook]], sends his men to Ooty to kill Anwar, for unknown reasons. At the same time, Michael, humiliated at his suspension, sends his men to beat up (but not kill) Kaali. Michael's plan backfires as he and his men are caught in the fight between Kaali and Singaar's men. Kaali subdues Singaar's men, earning Michael's and Gnanam's respect, following which Anwar learns about his past.\n\nAnwar is the son of Maalik, who was Kaali's best friend. It is also revealed that Kaali's real name is Petta Velan alias Petta and that he was a well-respected man in his village in [[Madurai district]]. 20 years ago, Maalik was in love with Petta's neighbour Poongodi, who conceived with him out of wedlock. When Petta heard of this, he and his wife Saraswathy alias Saro managed to convince Poongodi's father Rajapandi to get Poongodi married to Maalik, even though Rajapandi and Petta were sworn enemies. But Rajapandi's two sons, Devaaram and Singaar, vehemently opposed the alliance as well as the transfer of property to Poongodi. They then [[patricide|killed their father]]. Petta, on hearing about Rajapandi's murder, killed Devaaram during Rajapandi's funeral and chased Singaar out of the village. As revenge for Devaaram's killing and his forced exile, Singaar orchestrates a bomb blast during Poongodi's [[seemantham]], killing Maalik, Saro, and Petta and Saro's son Chinna. Petta, after finding that Poongodi was still alive, took her to safety. Poongodi later gave birth to a boy, who is revealed to be Anwar, and both of them left for [[Australia]] as refugees to escape from Singaar. On hearing this story, Petta and Anwar, along with Michael's henchmen, leave for Uttar Pradesh to finish off Singaar once and for all.\n\nIn Uttar Pradesh, Petta and Anwar confront Jithu, who is determined to kill them both after learning that his father and Petta are enemies. The duo manage to escape Jithu. Later, Petta meets Jithu privately and tells him that he is none other than his son Chinna, who did not die in the bomb blast, but was adopted by Singaar after finding him still alive in the wreckage of the blast. When Jithu confronts Singaar regarding his parentage, the latter sends his men to kill Jithu, who is rescued by Petta. Along with Anwar and Michael's henchmen, Petta and Jithu then barge into Singaar's mansion and kill him and his henchmen.\n\nFollowing Singaar's death, Petta has a surprise in store for Jithu. He tells him the tale  of [[Rama]] and how he defeated [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]], who had the ability to steal half the power of his opponents when they stood before him. Petta tells him that he did the same to Singaar by stealing half of his power, which was Jithu. Petta tells him the truth: he double-crossed Jithu and Jithu is not his son. The real Chinna had died in the bomb blast 20 years ago and the men sent to kill Jithu were Petta's own and not Singaar's. Petta debates whether to kill or spare Jithu. He dances for a while to the song ''Raman Aandalum'' from ''[[Mullum Malarum]]'' and then points the gun at Jithu. The screen goes black and a gunshot is heard, implying that Petta killed Jithu.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin|}}\n* [[Rajinikanth]] as Petta Velan (Kaali), an elderly man who gets hired as a hostel warden<ref>{{cite news |title=Watch: 'Marana Mass', first single from Rajini's 'Petta', reveals his name to be Kaali |url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/watch-marana-mass-first-single-rajinis-petta-reveals-his-name-be-kaali-92674 |accessdate=2 September 2019 |work=[[The News Minute]] |date=3 December 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Vijay Sethupathi]] as Jithu, a local goon who Petta convinces is his son Chinna<ref>{{cite news |title=Meet Jithu, Vijay Sethupathi's character from Rajinikanth's 'Petta' |url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/meet-jithu-vijay-sethupathis-character-rajinikanths-petta-92759 |accessdate=2 September 2019 |work=[[The News Minute]] |date=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Simran (actress)|Simran]] as Mangalam,a pranic healer ( Kaali's love interest and Anu's mother) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/tamil/petta-quick-review-rajinikanth-5531342/|title=Petta quick review: Thank you Karthik Subbaraj for bringing back the old Rajinikanth|date=10 January 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]] as Saraswathy (Saro), Petta's wife<ref>{{cite news |title=Meet Saro, Trisha's character in Rajini's next 'Petta' |url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/meet-saro-trishas-character-rajini-s-next-petta-93027 |accessdate=2 September 2019 |work=[[The News Minute]] |date=9 December 2018}}</ref>\n* [[M.

Her parents split up when Mark was only 1 year old and she lived with her mother in Miami until the age of 9 when they moved to India so that her mother could study Thangka, a traditional Buddhist form of art. After 3 years living in a monastery in India, Mark and her mother moved to Berlin, and after graduating high school at the age of 18 she moved to New York to live with her godparents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edailybuzz.com/2019/03/12/amber-mark-wiki-bio-2019-age-height-net-worth-birthday-mother-boyfriend-social-media/|title=Amber Mark Wiki, Bio 2019: Age, Height, Net worth, Birthday, Mother, Boyfriend, Social Media.|date=March 12, 2019|work=edailybuzz.com|accessdate=December 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHer mother, Mia, died on 3 June 2013 at the age of 60.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj5Y_Mni-eU|title=Amber Mark - Monsoon (Official Video) ft.

When they arrived they were told that they are not allowed to go to the seating area because Amber was too young at the time. A man at a merchandise table generously gave Amber and her mother \"All Access\" passes as long as they wouldn't go backstage. They ended up seeing the concert from the VIP area and stood next to Boris Becker. Amber remembers crying after the concert was over.\n\n===2016-present:Musical career===\nMark released her debut single \"S P A C E\" to her Soundcloud in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/6wq9aq/who-the-hell-is-amber-mark|title=Who the Hell Is Amber Mark?|last=Taylor Bennett|first=Kim|date=April 25, 2016|work=Vice|accessdate=December 4, 2019}}</ref> In 2017 she released her first album \"3:33am\".

{"title_page": "Artist's statement", "text_new": "[[File:Description of Wave by Monica Bonadies Hansel.pdf|thumbnail|Artist's statement by artist Monica Bonadies]]\nAn '''artist's statement''' (or '''artist statement''') is an artist's written description of their work. The brief verbal representation is for, and in support of, their own work to give the viewer understanding. As such it aims to inform, connect with an art context, and present the basis for the work; it is, therefore, didactic, descriptive, or reflective in nature.\n\n==Description==\nThe artist's text intends to explain, justify, extend, and/or contextualize their body of work. It places, or attempts to place, the work in relationship to art history and theory, the art world and the times. Further, the statement serves to show that the artist is conscious of their intentions, aware of their practice and its position within art parameters and of the discourse surrounding it. Therefore, not only does it describe and place, but it indicates the level of the artist's own comprehension of their field and making. The artist statement serves as a \"vital link of communication between you [the artist], and the rest of the world.\" <ref>College Art Association (Producer). (2011, Jan 26). \"Developing Your Artist Statement\" [Audio Podcast]. Retrieved from http://www.collegeart.org/podcasts/</ref> Most people encounter a work of art through a reproduction first, and there are many elements that are not present within a reproduction. That is why it is imperative that the artist knows how to properly convey their work through their own words. What the artist writes in their statement may be integrated in wall text, handouts at an exhibition or a paragraph in a press release. Judgments will be made based both on the nature of the art, as well as the words that accompany it.\n\nArtists often write a short (50-100 word) and/or a long (500-1000 word) version of the same statement, and they may maintain and revise these statements throughout their careers.<ref>''Tom Palin: Artist Statements 1992-2012''. Workshop Press Leeds, 2013.</ref> They may be edited to suit the requirements of specific funding bodies, galleries or [[call-out]]s as part of the application process.\n\n==History==\nThe writing of artists' statements is a comparatively recent phenomenon beginning in the 1990s.<ref>Detterer, Gabriele. Ed.  ''Art Recollection: Artists' Interviews & Statements in the Nineties']'. Florence: Danilo Montanari, Exit, and Zona Archives Editori, 1997.</ref>  In some respects, the practice resembles the [[art manifesto]] and may derive in part from it.  However, the artist's statement generally speaks for an individual rather than a collective, and is not strongly associated with [[polemic]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}  Rather, a [[contemporary art]]ist may be required to submit the statement in order to tender for commissions or apply for schools, residencies, jobs, awards, and other forms of institutional support, in justification of their submission.\n\nIn their 2008 survey of North American art schools and university art programs, Garrett-Petts and Nash found that nearly 90% teach the writing of artist statements as part of the curriculum; in addition, they found that,\n\n<blockquote>Like prefaces, forewords, prologues, and introductions to literary works, the artist statement performs a vital if complex rhetorical role: when included in an exhibition proposal and sent to a curator, the artist statement usually provides a description of the work, some indication of the work's art historical and theoretical context, some background information about the artist and the artist's intentions, technical specifications \u2013 and, at the same time, it aims to persuade the reader of the artwork's value. When hung on a gallery wall, the statement (or \"didactic\") becomes an invitation, an explanation, and, often indirectly, an element of the installation itself.<ref>Garrett-Petts, W.F., and Rachel Nash. \"Re-Visioning the Visual: Making Artistic Inquiry Visible.\" ''Rhizomes'' 18 (Winter 2008). Spec. issue on \"Imaging Place\".</ref></blockquote>\n\n==As subject matter==\nOn at least two occasions, artist's statements have been the subject of gallery exhibitions. The first exhibition of artists' statements, ''The Art of the Artist's Statement'',  was curated by Georgia Kotretsos and Maria Pashalidou at the Hellenic Museum, [[Chicago]], in the spring of 2005. It featured the work of 14 artists invited to create artwork offering a visual commentary on the subject of artist statements. The second exhibition, ''Proximities: Artists' Statements and Their Works'', was installed in the fall of 2005 at the Kamloops Art Gallery, [[Kamloops, British Columbia]]. Co-curated by W.F. Garrett-Petts and Rachel Nash, the exhibition asked nine contributing artists to respond to the topic of artists\u2019 statements by taking one or more of their own artist's statements and working with the text(s) in a manner that documented, represented, and annotated the original work, creating a new work in the process.

The brief verbal representation is for, and in support of, their own work to give the viewer understanding. As such it aims to inform, connect with an art context, and present the basis for the work; it is, therefore, didactic, descriptive, or reflective in nature.\n\n==Description==\nThe artist's text intends to explain, justify, extend, and/or contextualize their body of work. It places, or attempts to place, the work in relationship to art history and theory, the art world and the times. Further, the statement serves to show that the artist is conscious of their intentions, aware of their practice and its position within art parameters and of the discourse surrounding it. Therefore not only does it describe and place, but it indicates the level of the artist's own comprehension of their field and making. The artist statement serves as a \"vital link of communication between you [the artist], and the rest of the world.\" <ref> College Art Association (Producer). (2011, Jan 26). \"Developing Your Artist Statement\" [Audio Podcast]. Retrieved from http://www.collegeart.org/podcasts/ </ref> Most people encounter a work of art through a reproduction first, and there are many elements that are not present within a reproduction. That is why it is imperative that the artist knows how to properly convey their work through their own words. What the artist writes in their statement may be integrated in wall text, handouts at an exhibition or a paragraph in a press release. Judgments will be made based both on the nature of the art, as well as the words that accompany it.   \n\nArtists often write a short (50-100 word) and/or a long (500-1000 word) version of the same statement, and they may maintain and revise these statements throughout their careers. <ref>''Tom Palin: Artist Statements 1992-2012''. Workshop Press Leeds, 2013.</ref>They may be edited to suit the requirements of specific funding bodies, galleries or [[call-out]]s as part of the application process.\n\n==History==\nThe writing of artists' statements is a comparatively recent phenomenon beginning in the 1990s.<ref>Detterer, Gabriele. Ed.  ''Art Recollection: Artists' Interviews & Statements in the Nineties']'. Florence: Danilo Montanari, Exit, and Zona Archives Editori, 1997.</ref>  In some respects, the practice resembles the [[art manifesto]] and may derive in part from it.  However, the artist's statement generally speaks for an individual rather than a collective, and is not strongly associated with [[polemic]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}  Rather, a [[contemporary art]]ist may be required to submit the statement in order to tender for commissions or apply for schools, residencies, jobs, awards, and other forms of institutional support, in justification of their submission.\n\nIn their 2008 survey of North American art schools and university art programs, Garrett-Petts and Nash found that nearly 90% teach the writing of artist statements as part of the curriculum; in addition, they found that, \n\n<blockquote>Like prefaces, forewords, prologues, and introductions to literary works, the artist statement performs a vital if complex rhetorical role: when included in an exhibition proposal and sent to a curator, the artist statement usually provides a description of the work, some indication of the work's art historical and theoretical context, some background information about the artist and the artist's intentions, technical specifications \u2013 and, at the same time, it aims to persuade the reader of the artwork's value. When hung on a gallery wall, the statement (or \"didactic\") becomes an invitation, an explanation, and, often indirectly, an element of the installation itself.<ref>Garrett-Petts, W.F., and Rachel Nash. \"Re-Visioning the Visual: Making Artistic Inquiry Visible.\" ''Rhizomes'' 18 (Winter 2008). Spec. issue on \"Imaging Place\".</ref></blockquote>\n\n==As subject matter==\nOn at least two occasions, artist's statements have been the subject of gallery exhibitions. The first exhibition of artists' statements, ''The Art of the Artist's Statement'',  was curated by Georgia Kotretsos and Maria Pashalidou at the Hellenic Museum, [[Chicago]], in the spring of 2005. It featured the work of 14 artists invited to create artwork offering a visual commentary on the subject of artist statements. The second exhibition, ''Proximities: Artists' Statements and Their Works'', was installed in the fall of 2005 at the Kamloops Art Gallery, [[Kamloops, British Columbia]]. Co-curated by W.F. Garrett-Petts and Rachel Nash, the exhibition asked nine contributing artists to respond to the topic of artists\u2019 statements by taking one or more of their own artist\u2019s statements and working with the text(s) in a manner that documented, represented, and annotated the original work, creating a new work in the process. In 2013, Workshop Press published a collection of 123 artist statements by British painter [[Tom Palin]]. The statements spanned a period of 21 years and came with a foreward by Michael Belshaw.\n\nArtist's statements have been the subject of a research project on the professional language of the contemporary art world by sociologist Alix Rule and artist David Levine.
