The team's colours are blue, white and red, and the ''[[Gallic rooster|coq gaulois]]'' its symbol. France are colloquially known as ''Les Bleus'' (The Blues). The French side are the reigning World Cup holders, having won the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] on 15 July 2018.\n\nFrance plays their home matches at the [[Stade de France]] in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], \u00cele-de-France, and their manager is [[Didier Deschamps]]. They have won two [[FIFA World Cup]]s, two [[UEFA European Championship]]s, two [[FIFA Confederations Cup]]s and one [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Olympic tournament]]. France experienced much of its success in four major eras: in the 1950s, 1980s, late 1990s/early 2000s, and mid/late 2010s, respectively, which resulted in numerous major honours. France was one of the four European teams that participated in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|inaugural World Cup in 1930]] and, although having been eliminated in the qualification stage six times, is one of only three teams that have entered every World Cup qualifying cycle.<ref>The other two being United States (withdrawing in 1938 without actually playing any match) and Brazil (reaching the finals tournament each time).</ref>\n\nIn 1958, the team, led by [[Raymond Kopa]] and [[Just Fontaine]], finished in third place at the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]]. In 1984, France, led by [[Ballon d'Or]] winner [[Michel Platini]], won [[UEFA Euro 1984]] and Football at the 1984 Summer Olympics.\n\nUnder the captaincy of [[Didier Deschamps]] and three-time [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] [[Zinedine Zidane]], France won the FIFA World Cup in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]]. Two years later, the team triumphed at [[UEFA Euro 2000]]. France won the [[FIFA Confederations Cup]] in [[2001 FIFA Confederations Cup|2001]] and [[2003 FIFA Confederations Cup|2003]], and reached the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], which it lost 5\u20133 on [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalties]] to [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. The team also reached the final of [[UEFA Euro 2016]], where they lost 1\u20130 to [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in extra time. France won the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], defeating [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] 4\u20132 in the final match on 15 July 2018. This was the second time they had won the tournament after winning it on home soil in 1998.\n\nFrance was the first national team to win the three most important men's titles recognized by [[FIFA]]: the World Cup, the Confederations Cup, and the Olympic tournament after victory in the Confederations Cup in 2001. The Confederations Cup started in 1992. Prior to this, Uruguay and Italy had won both the Olympic tournament and the World Cup in the 1920s and 1930s. England and Germany had also won both tournaments; albeit England competes as Great Britain in the Olympics and East Germany won the Olympic tournament in 1976. Since 2001, [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] (after the [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2004 Olympics]]) and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] (after the [[Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2016 Olympics]]) are the other two national teams that have won these three titles. They have also won their respective continental championship ([[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] for Argentina and Brazil, and [[UEFA European Championship]] for France).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/associations/association=fra/index.html |title=\u2013 France on |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=7 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/index.html |title=\u2013 Tournaments |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=7 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the France national football team}}\n[[File:French national football team - Olympic games 1920.jpg|thumb|France national team at [[1920 Summer Olympics]]]]\n\nThe France national football team was created in 1904 around the time of [[FIFA]]'s foundation on 21 May 1904 and contested [[\u00c9vence Copp\u00e9e Trophy|its first official international match]] on 1 May 1904 against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in [[Brussels]], which ended in a 3\u20133 draw.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fff.fr/servfff/historique/match_detail.php?nomatch=1|title=France v. Belgium 1904 Match Report |work=French Football Federation|accessdate=4 June 2010}}</ref> The following year, on 12 February 1905, France contested their first-ever home match against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]. The match was played at the [[Parc des Princes]] in front of 500 supporters. France won the match 1\u20130 with the only goal coming from [[Gaston Cypr\u00e8s]]. Due to disagreements between [[FIFA]] and the [[Union des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Fran\u00e7aises de Sports Athl\u00e9tiques]] (USFSA), the country's [[sports union]], France struggled to establish an identity. On 9 May 1908, the French Interfederal Committee (CFI), a rival organization to the USFSA, ruled that FIFA would now be responsible for the club's appearances in forthcoming Olympic Games and not the USFSA. In 1919, the CFI transformed themselves into the [[French Football Federation]] (FFF). In 1921, the USFSA finally merged with the FFF.\n\nIn July 1930, France appeared in the inaugural [[1930 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]], held in Uruguay. In their first-ever World Cup match, France defeated [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 4\u20131 at the [[Estadio Pocitos]] in [[Montevideo]]. [[Lucien Laurent]] became notable in the match as he scored not only France's first World Cup goal, but the first goal in World Cup history. Conversely, France also became the first team to not score in a match after losing 1\u20130 to fellow group stage opponents [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. Another loss to [[Chile national football team|Chile]] resulted in the team bowing out in the group stage. The following year saw the first selection of a [[Black skin|black]] player to the national team. [[Raoul Diagne]], who was of Senegalese descent, earned his first cap on 15 February in a 2\u20131 defeat to [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]]. Diagne later played with the team at the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup]], alongside [[Larbi Benbarek]], who was one of the first players of North African origin to play for the national team. At the [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934 World Cup]], France suffered elimination in the opening round, losing 3\u20132 to [[Austria national football team|Austria]]. On the team's return to Paris, they were greeted as heroes by a crowd of over 4,000 supporters. France hosted the 1938 World Cup and reached the quarter-finals, losing 3\u20131 to defending champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]].\n\nThe 1950s saw France handed its first [[Golden Generation]] composed of players such as [[Just Fontaine]], [[Raymond Kopa]], [[Jean Vincent (footballer)|Jean Vincent]], [[Robert Jonquet]], [[Maryan Wisnieski]], [[Thad\u00e9e Cisowski]], and [[Armand Penverne]]. At the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]], France reached the semi-finals losing to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. In the third place match, France defeated West Germany 6\u20133 with Fontaine recording four goals, which brought his goal tally in the competition to 13, a World Cup record. The record still stands today. France hosted the inaugural [[UEFA European Football Championship]] in 1960 and, for the second straight international tournament, reached the semi-finals. In the round, France faced [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] and were shocked 5\u20134 despite being up 4\u20132 heading into the 75th minute. In the third-place match, France were defeated 2\u20130 by the Czechoslovakians.\n\nThe 1960s and 70s saw France decline significantly playing under several managers and failing to qualify for numerous international tournaments. On 25 April 1964, [[Henri Gu\u00e9rin (footballer)|Henri Gu\u00e9rin]] was officially installed as the team's first manager. Under Gu\u00e9rin, France failed to qualify for the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 World Cup]] and the [[1964 European Nations' Cup]]. The team did return to major international play following qualification for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]]. The team lost in the group stage portion of the tournament. Gu\u00e9rin was fired following the World Cup. He was replaced by [[Jos\u00e9 Arribas]] and [[Jean Snella]], who worked as [[caretaker manager]]s in dual roles. The two only lasted four matches and were replaced by former international [[Just Fontaine]], who only lasted two. [[Louis Dugauguez]] succeeded Fontaine and, following his early struggles in [[1970 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification]] for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]], was fired and replaced by [[Georges Boulogne]], who could not get the team to the competition. Boulogne was later fired following his failure to qualify for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] and was replaced by the Romanian [[\u0218tefan Kov\u00e1cs]], who became the only international manager to ever manage the national team. Kov\u00e1cs also turned out to be a disappointment failing to qualify for the 1974 World Cup and [[UEFA Euro 1976]]. After two years in charge, he was sacked and replaced with [[Michel Hidalgo]].\n\n[[File:Michel Platini in Wroclaw by Klearchos Kapoutsis tight crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Michel Platini]] captained France to victory at [[UEFA Euro 1984]].]]\n\nUnder Hidalgo, France flourished, mainly due to the accolades of great players like defenders [[Marius Tr\u00e9sor]] and [[Maxime Bossis]], striker [[Dominique Rocheteau]] and midfielder [[Michel Platini]], who, alongside [[Jean Tigana]], [[Alain Giresse]] and [[Luis Fern\u00e1ndez]] formed the ''\"carr\u00e9 magique\"'' (\"Magic Square\"), which would haunt opposing defenses beginning at the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]], where France reached the semi-finals losing on penalties to rivals [[Germany national football team|West Germany]]. The semi-final match-up is considered one of the greatest matches in World Cup history and was [[History of the France national football team#1982 World Cup|marred with controversy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fff.fr/servfff/historique/match_detail.php?nomatch=419|title=France v. Germany 1982 Match Report |work=French Football Federation|accessdate=4 June 2010}}</ref> France earned their first major international honor two years later, winning [[UEFA Euro 1984|Euro 1984]], which they hosted. Under the leadership of Platini, who scored a tournament-high nine goals, France defeated [[Spain national football team|Spain]] 2\u20130 in the final. Platini and [[Bruno Bellone]] scored the goals. Following the Euro triumph, Hidalgo departed the team and was replaced by former international [[Henri Michel]]. France later completed the hat-trick when they won gold at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] [[Football at the 1984 Summer Olympics|football tournament]] and, a year later, defeated Uruguay 2\u20130 to win the [[Artemio Franchi Trophy]], an early precursor to the [[FIFA Confederations Cup]]. [[Dominique Rocheteau]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Tour\u00e9]] scored the goals. In a span of a year, France were holders of three of the four major international trophies. At the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]], France were favorites to win the competition, and, for the second consecutive World Cup, reached the semi-finals where they faced West Germany. Again, however, they lost. A 4\u20132 victory over Belgium gave France third place.\n\nIn 1988, the FFF opened the [[INF Clairefontaine|Clairefontaine]] National Football Institute. Its opening ceremony was attended by then-[[President of France]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]]. Five months after Clairefontaine's opening, manager [[Henri Michel]] was fired and was replaced by Michel Platini, who failed to get the team to the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]]. Platini did lead the team to [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 1992]] and, despite going on a 19-match unbeaten streak prior to the competition, suffered elimination in the group stage. A week after the completion of the tournament, Platini stepped down as manager and was replaced by his assistant [[G\u00e9rard Houllier]]. Under Houllier, France and its supporters experienced a heartbreaking meltdown after having qualification to the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] all but secured with two matches to go, which were against last place [[Israel national football team|Israel]] and [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]]. In the match against Israel, France were upset 3\u20132 and, in the Bulgaria match, suffered an astronomical 2\u20131 defeat. The [[History of the France national football team#1994 World Cup qualification debacle|subsequent blame and public outcry]] to the firing of Houllier and departure of several players from the national team fold. His assistant [[Aim\u00e9 Jacquet]] was given his post.\n\n{{football squad on pitch|align=right\n| GK  = [[Fabien Barthez|'''Barthez''']]\n| RB  = [[Lilian Thuram|'''Thuram''']]\n| RCB = [[Frank Leboeuf|'''Leboeuf''']]\n| LCB = [[Marcel Desailly|'''Desailly''']]\n| LB  = [[Bixente Lizarazu|'''Lizarazu''']]\n| DM = [[Didier Deschamps|'''Deschamps''']]\n| RCM = [[Christian Karembeu|'''Karembeu''']]\n| LCM  = [[Emmanuel Petit|'''Petit''']]\n| RAM  = [[Zinedine Zidane|'''Zidane''']]\n| LAM  = [[Youri Djorkaeff|'''Djorkaeff''']]\n| CF  = [[St\u00e9phane Guivarc'h|'''Guivarc'h''']]\n| caption = France starting line-up against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup Final]], a match they won 3\u20130.\n}}\nUnder Jacquet, the national team experienced its triumphant years. The squad composed of veterans that failed to reach the 1994 FIFA World Cup were joined by influential youngsters, such as [[Zinedine Zidane]]. The team started off well reaching the semi-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 1996]], where they lost 6\u20135 on penalties to the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]]. In the team's next major tournament at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] at home, Jacquet led France to glory defeating Brazil 3\u20130 in the final at the [[Stade de France]] in Paris. Jacquet stepped down after the country's World Cup triumph and was succeeded by assistant [[Roger Lemerre]] who guided them through [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]]. Led by [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] Zidane, France defeated Italy 2\u20131 in the final. [[David Trezeguet]] scored the [[golden goal]] in [[extra time]]. The victory gave the team the distinction of being the first national team to hold both the World Cup and Euro titles since West Germany did so in 1974, and it was also the first time that a reigning World Cup winner went on to capture the Euro. Following the result, the France national team was inserted to the number one spot in the [[FIFA World Rankings]].\n\n[[File:Zinedine zidane wcf 2006-edit.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Zinedine Zidane]] captaining France at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]]]\nFrance failed to maintain that pace in subsequent tournaments. Although, the team won the [[2001 FIFA Confederations Cup]], France suffered a first round elimination at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]]. One of the greatest shocks in World Cup history saw France condemned to a 1\u20130 defeat to debutantes [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] in the opening game of the tournament. France became the second nation to be eliminated in the first round while holding the World Cup crown, the first one being Brazil in 1966. After the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]], and [[2018 World Cup]]s, Italy, Spain, and Germany were also added to this list.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/worldcup/world-cup-2014-spain-and-the-world-cup-holders-who-crashed-out-at-the-group-stage-9547351.html |accessdate = 18 April 2015 |newspaper = The Independent |date=18 June 2014|last=Krishnan|first=Joe|title=World Cup 2014: Spain and the World Cup holders who crashed out at the group stage }}</ref> After France finished bottom of the group, Lemerre was dismissed and was replaced by [[Jacques Santini]]. A full strength team started out strongly at [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]], but they were upset in the quarter-finals by the eventual winners [[Greece national football team|Greece]]. Santini resigned as coach and [[Raymond Domenech]] was picked as his replacement. France struggled in the early qualifiers for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. This prompted Domenech to persuade several past members out of international retirement to help the national team qualify, which they accomplished following a convincing 4\u20130 win over [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] on the final day of qualifying. In the 2006 World Cup final stages, France finished undefeated in the group stage portion and advanced all the way to the final defeating the likes of [[Spain national football team|Spain]], Brazil and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] en route. France played Italy in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] and, in part down to [[Zidane vs. Materazzi|controversial disruptions in extra time]] that lead to captain Zinedine Zidane being sent off, failed to find a winning goal, Italy winning 5\u20133 on penalties to be crowned World Cup champions.\n[[File:France national football team 2006.JPG|thumb|The French team in front of fans in 2006.]]\nFrance started its [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group B|qualifying round]] for [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] strong and qualified for the tournament, despite two defeats to [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]].

Located in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], a Parisian suburb, the stadium has an all-seater capacity of 81,338. France's first match at the stadium was played on 28 January 1998 against Spain. France won the match 1\u20130, with Zinedine Zidane scoring the lone goal. Since that match, France has used the stadium for almost every major home game, including the [[1998 FIFA World Cup Final|1998 World Cup final]].\n\nPrior to matches, home or away, the national team trains at the [[INF Clairefontaine]] academy in [[Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines]]. Clairefontaine is the national association football centre and is among 12 \u00e9lite academies throughout the country. The centre was inaugurated in 1976 by former FFF president [[Fernand Sastre]] and opened in 1988. The center drew media spotlight following its usage as a base camp by the team that won the 1998 World Cup.\n\nIn the 20th and 23rd minute of an [[international friendly]] on 13 November 2015, against Germany, [[November 2015 Paris attacks|three groups of terrorists attempted to detonate bomb vests, at three entrances of Stade de France, and two explosions occurred]]. Play would continue, until the 94th minute, in order to keep the crowd from panicking. Consequently, the stadium was evacuated through the unaffected gates of the stadium away from the players benches. Due to the blocked exits, spectators who could not leave the stadium had to go down to the pitch and wait until it was safer.\n\n==Team image==\n===Media coverage===\nThe national team has a broadcasting agreement with [[TF1 Group]], who the Federal Council of the FFF agreed to extend its exclusive broadcasting agreement with the channel.

The team is also referred to as ''Les Tricolores'' or ''L'Equipe Tricolore'' (The Tri-color Team) due to the team's utilization of the country's national colors: blue, white, and red. During the 1980s, France earned the nickname the ''\"Brazilians of Europe\"'' mainly due to the accolades of the ''\"carr\u00e9 magique\"'' (\"Magic Square\"), who were anchored by [[Michel Platini]]. Led by coach [[Michel Hidalgo]], France exhibited an inspiring, elegant, skillful and technically advanced offensive style of football, which was strikingly similar to their [[Brazil national football team|South American counterparts]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fourfourtwo.com/interviews/one-on-one/147/article.aspx|title=One-On-One: Michel Platini |work=FourFourTwo |accessdate=4 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Representation of multi-ethnic France===\nThe France national team has long reflected the [[Cultural diversity|ethnic diversity]] of the country. Already in its first decades, there were in the France national team players that were considered of non-\"genuinely\" French origin, being descendants of immigrants of former colonies of the [[French Colonial Empire]] or of European countries neighboring France. The first black player to play in the national team was [[Raoul Diagne]] in 1931. Diagne was the son of the first African elected to the [[National Assembly of France|French National Assembly]], [[Blaise Diagne]]. Seven years later, Diagne played on the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]] team that featured [[Michel Brusseaux]], the second footballer of North African descent to play for the national team (after [[Abdelkader Ben Bouali]] who was selected to play against [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]] in 1937). At the 1958 World Cup, in which France reached the semi-finals, many sons of immigrants (such as [[Raymond Kopa]], [[Just Fontaine]], [[Roger Piantoni]], [[Maryan Wisnieski]] and Bernard Chiarelli) were integral to the team's success. The tradition has since continued, with successful French players such as [[Michel Platini]], [[Jean Tigana]], [[Manuel Amoros]], [[Eric Cantona]], [[Zinedine Zidane]], [[Patrick Vieira]], [[David Trezeguet]], [[Claude Makelele]], [[Samir Nasri]], [[Hatem Ben Arfa]], [[Karim Benzema]], and [[Kylian Mbapp\u00e9]] all having either one or both of their parents foreign-born.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the team was widely celebrated as an example of the modern [[Demographics of France|multicultural]] French ideal.<ref>{{cite news |title = Wider view of France '98 gives Emmanuel Petit opportunity to look back in anger |work=The Times |location=UK |date = 1 March 2010 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/international/article7044481.ece |accessdate=27 July 2010  | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti}}</ref> The 1998 World Cup-winning team was celebrated and praised for inspiring pride and optimism about the prospects for the \"French model\" of [[social integration]].<ref>{{cite news |title = France's multicultural World Cup-winning team (1998) achieved little for integration |publisher=United for Peace of Pierce County |date = 11 November 2005|url=http://www.ufppc.org/us-a-world-news-mainmenu-35/3626-background-frances-multicultural-world-cup-winning-team-1998-achieved-little-for-integration.html |accessdate=28 July 2010}}</ref> Of the 23 players on the team, the squad featured players who could trace their origins to Armenia, Algeria, [[Guadeloupe]], [[New Caledonia]], Argentina, Ghana, Senegal, Italy, [[French Guiana]], Portugal and [[Martinique]], with the [[patriarch]] of the team being Zinedine Zidane, who was born in [[Marseille]] to Algerian immigrants.\n[[File:France - Bi\u00e9lorussie 2017-10-10 Stade France St Denis Seine St Denis 9.jpg|thumb|left|France v Belarus at the Stade de France in October 2017.]]\nThe multiracial makeup of the team has, at times, provoked controversy. In recent years, critics on the [[Far right leagues|far right of the French political spectrum]] have taken issue with the proportional under-representation of ethnic white Frenchmen within the team. [[National Front (France)|National Front]] politician [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] protested in 1998 that the ''Black, Blanc, [[Beur]]'' team that won the World Cup did not look sufficiently French. In 2002, led by Ghanaian-born [[Marcel Desailly]], the French team unanimously and publicly appealed to the French voting public to reject the presidential candidacy of Le Pen and, instead, return President [[Jacques Chirac]] to office. In 2006, Le Pen resumed his criticism charging that coach Raymond Domenech had selected too many black players.<ref>{{cite news |title = The Sword is Mightier than Le Pen |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date = 7 July 2006 |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=373084&root=worldcup&cc=5901 |accessdate=17 August 2006}}</ref> In 2005, French-Jewish conservative writer [[Alain Finkielkraut]] caused controversy by punning to the Israeli newspaper ''Haaretz'' that despite its earlier slogan, \"the French national team is in fact black-black-black,\" and also adding that, \"France is made fun of all around Europe because of that.\" He later apologized for the comments declaring that they were not meant to be offensive.<ref>{{cite news|title=Finkielkraut sur Europe 1|work=Le Nouvel Observateur|location=France|date=25 November 2005|url=http://archquo.nouvelobs.com/cgi/articles?ad=societe/20051125.OBS6590.html&host=http://permanent.nouvelobs.com/|accessdate=25 November 2005|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312151704/http://archquo.nouvelobs.com/cgi/articles?ad=societe%2F20051125.OBS6590.html|archivedate=12 March 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:France national football team 2018.jpg|thumb|right|250px|France lining up before a friendly against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] in 2018]]\nThe socio-ethnic divide between the public and the team reached a climax during the 2010 World Cup. Once in South Africa, the team did not manage to score a goal in their first two matches, leaving almost no chance of going through save an exceptional win over hosts South Africa. Thereafter, the players went on strike because of what they saw as mismanagement of the Nicolas Anelka case. Anelka had been forced to depart after a slur that leaked to the press. Players said he was misquoted, and complained of the alleged leaker from the staff, the media, and the federation. Instead of training, coach Raymond Domenech read the players' petition live on television to the stunned journalists.\n\nThe national team's overall impact on France's efforts to integrate its minorities and come to terms with its colonial past has been mixed. In 2001, France played a friendly match at the Stade de France, the site of its 1998 World Cup triumph, against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]]. It was the country's first meeting with its former colony, with whom it had fought a [[Algerian War|war from 1954 to 1962]], and it proved controversial. France's national anthem, ''[[La Marseillaise]]'', was booed by Algerian supporters before the game, and following a French goal that made the score 4\u20131 in the second half, spectators ran onto the field of play, which caused play to be suspended. It was never resumed.\n\nIn April 2011, the French investigative website Mediapart released a story which claimed that the FFF had been attempting to secretly put in place a quota system in order to limit the number of dual-citizenship players in its national academies. Quoting a senior figure in the FFF, the organization was said to have wanted to set a cap of 30% on the number of players of dual-nationality by limiting places in the academies in the 12\u201313 age bracket.<ref>{{cite news |title = French football body to investigate 'race quota' claim |agency=[[BBC]] |date = 30 April 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13236864 |accessdate= 9 May 2011 }}</ref> The FFF responded by releasing a public statement on its website denying the report, stating, \"[N]one of its elected bodies has been validated, or even contemplated a policy of quotas for the recruitment of its training centers.\"<ref>{{cite news |title = Le DTN suspendu de ses fonctions |agency=[[French Football Federation]] |date = 30 April 2011 |url=http://www.fff.fr/presentationfff/actualite/537335.shtml |accessdate= 9 May 2011 | language = French }}</ref> The FFF also announced that it had authorized a full investigation into the matter and, as a result, suspended National Technical Director Fran\u00e7ois Blaquart pending the outcome of the investigation.<ref>{{cite news |title = Pr\u00e9cision de la FFF |agency=[[French Football Federation]] |date = 30 April 2011 |url=http://www.fff.fr/presentationfff/actualite/537336.shtml |accessdate= 9 May 2011 | language = French }}</ref> Former national team player [[Lilian Thuram]] said of the allegations, \"Initially I thought this was a joke. I'm so stunned I don't know what to say,\" while [[Patrick Vieira]] declared that comments allegedly made by manager Laurent Blanc at the meeting were \"serious and scandalous\". The [[French government]] also weighed in on the issue, as then President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] was quoted as being \"viscerally opposed to any form of quota\", while adding \"setting quotas would be the end of the Republic\".

international [[Association football|football]] and is controlled by the [[French Football Federation]], also known as FFF, or in {{lang-fr|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise de football}}.  The team's colours are blue, white and red, and the ''[[Gallic rooster|coq gaulois]]'' its symbol. France are colloquially known as ''Les Bleus'' (The Blues). The French side are the reigning World Cup holders, having won the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] on 15 July 2018.\n\nFrance play home matches at the [[Stade de France]] in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], \u00cele-de-France, and their manager is [[Didier Deschamps]]. They have won two [[FIFA World Cup]]s, two [[UEFA European Championship]]s, two [[FIFA Confederations Cup]]s and one [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Olympic tournament]]. France experienced much of its success in four major eras: in the 1950s, 1980s, late 1990s/early 2000s, and mid/late 2010s, respectively, which resulted in numerous major honours. France was one of the four European teams that participated in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|inaugural World Cup in 1930]] and, although having been eliminated in the qualification stage six times, is one of only three teams that have entered every World Cup qualifying cycle.<ref>The other two being United States (withdrawing in 1938 without actually playing any match) and Brazil (reaching the finals tournament each time).</ref>\n\nIn 1958, the team, led by [[Raymond Kopa]] and [[Just Fontaine]], finished in third place at the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]]. In 1984, France, led by [[Ballon d'Or]] winner [[Michel Platini]], won [[UEFA Euro 1984]] and Football at the 1984 Summer Olympics.\n\nUnder the captaincy of [[Didier Deschamps]] and three-time [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] [[Zinedine Zidane]], France won the FIFA World Cup in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]]. Two years later, the team triumphed at [[UEFA Euro 2000]]. France won the [[FIFA Confederations Cup]] in [[2001 FIFA Confederations Cup|2001]] and [[2003 FIFA Confederations Cup|2003]], and reached the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], which it lost 5\u20133 on [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalties]] to [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. The team also reached the final of [[UEFA Euro 2016]], where they lost 1\u20130 to [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in extra time. France won the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], defeating [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] 4\u20132 in the final match on 15 July 2018. This was the second time they had won the tournament after winning it on home soil in 1998.\n\nFrance was the first national team that has won the three most important men's titles recognized by [[FIFA]]: the World Cup, the Confederations Cup, and the Olympic tournament after victory in the Confederations Cup in 2001. The Confederations Cup started in 1997. Prior to this, Uruguay and Italy had won both the Olympic tournament and the World Cup in the 1920s and 1930s. England and Germany had also won both tournaments; albeit England competes as Great Britain in the Olympics and East Germany won the Olympic tournament in 1976. Since 2001, [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] (after the [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2004 Olympics]]) and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] (after the [[Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2016 Olympics]]) are the other two national teams that have won these three titles. They have also won their respective continental championship ([[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] for Argentina and Brazil, and [[UEFA European Championship]] for France).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/associations/association=fra/index.html |title=\u2013 France on |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=7 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/index.html |title=\u2013 Tournaments |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=7 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the France national football team}}\n[[File:French national football team - Olympic games 1920.jpg|thumb|France national team at [[1920 Summer Olympics]]]]\n\nThe France national football team was created in 1904 around the time of [[FIFA]]'s foundation on 21 May 1904 and contested [[\u00c9vence Copp\u00e9e Trophy|its first official international match]] on 1 May 1904 against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in [[Brussels]], which ended in a 3\u20133 draw.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fff.fr/servfff/historique/match_detail.php?nomatch=1|title=France v. Belgium 1904 Match Report |work=French Football Federation|accessdate=4 June 2010}}</ref> The following year, on 12 February 1905, France contested their first-ever home match against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]. The match was played at the [[Parc des Princes]] in front of 500 supporters. France won the match 1\u20130 with the only goal coming from [[Gaston Cypr\u00e8s]]. Due to disagreements between [[FIFA]] and the [[Union des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Fran\u00e7aises de Sports Athl\u00e9tiques]] (USFSA), the country's [[sports union]], France struggled to establish an identity. On 9 May 1908, the French Interfederal Committee (CFI), a rival organization to the USFSA, ruled that FIFA would now be responsible for the club's appearances in forthcoming Olympic Games and not the USFSA. In 1919, the CFI transformed themselves into the [[French Football Federation]] (FFF). In 1921, the USFSA finally merged with the FFF.\n\nIn July 1930, France appeared in the inaugural [[1930 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]], held in Uruguay. In their first-ever World Cup match, France defeated [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 4\u20131 at the [[Estadio Pocitos]] in [[Montevideo]]. [[Lucien Laurent]] became notable in the match as he scored not only France's first World Cup goal, but the first goal in World Cup history. Conversely, France also became the first team to not score in a match after losing 1\u20130 to fellow group stage opponents [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. Another loss to [[Chile national football team|Chile]] resulted in the team bowing out in the group stage. The following year saw the first selection of a [[Black skin|black]] player to the national team. [[Raoul Diagne]], who was of Senegalese descent, earned his first cap on 15 February in a 2\u20131 defeat to [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]]. Diagne later played with the team at the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup]], alongside [[Larbi Benbarek]], who was one of the first players of North African origin to play for the national team. At the [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934 World Cup]], France suffered elimination in the opening round, losing 3\u20132 to [[Austria national football team|Austria]]. On the team's return to Paris, they were greeted as heroes by a crowd of over 4,000 supporters. France hosted the 1938 World Cup and reached the quarter-finals, losing 3\u20131 to defending champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]].\n\nThe 1950s saw France handed its first [[Golden Generation]] composed of players such as [[Just Fontaine]], [[Raymond Kopa]], [[Jean Vincent (footballer)|Jean Vincent]], [[Robert Jonquet]], [[Maryan Wisnieski]], [[Thad\u00e9e Cisowski]], and [[Armand Penverne]]. At the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]], France reached the semi-finals losing to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. In the third place match, France defeated West Germany 6\u20133 with Fontaine recording four goals, which brought his goal tally in the competition to 13, a World Cup record. The record still stands today. France hosted the inaugural [[UEFA European Football Championship]] in 1960 and, for the second straight international tournament, reached the semi-finals. In the round, France faced [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] and were shocked 5\u20134 despite being up 4\u20132 heading into the 75th minute. In the third-place match, France were defeated 2\u20130 by the Czechoslovakians.\n\nThe 1960s and 70s saw France decline significantly playing under several managers and failing to qualify for numerous international tournaments. On 25 April 1964, [[Henri Gu\u00e9rin (footballer)|Henri Gu\u00e9rin]] was officially installed as the team's first manager. Under Gu\u00e9rin, France failed to qualify for the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 World Cup]] and the [[1964 European Nations' Cup]]. The team did return to major international play following qualification for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]]. The team lost in the group stage portion of the tournament. Gu\u00e9rin was fired following the World Cup. He was replaced by [[Jos\u00e9 Arribas]] and [[Jean Snella]], who worked as [[caretaker manager]]s in dual roles. The two only lasted four matches and were replaced by former international [[Just Fontaine]], who only lasted two. [[Louis Dugauguez]] succeeded Fontaine and, following his early struggles in [[1970 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification]] for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]], was fired and replaced by [[Georges Boulogne]], who could not get the team to the competition. Boulogne was later fired following his failure to qualify for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] and was replaced by the Romanian [[\u0218tefan Kov\u00e1cs]], who became the only international manager to ever manage the national team. Kov\u00e1cs also turned out to be a disappointment failing to qualify for the 1974 World Cup and [[UEFA Euro 1976]]. After two years in charge, he was sacked and replaced with [[Michel Hidalgo]].\n\n[[File:Michel Platini in Wroclaw by Klearchos Kapoutsis tight crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Michel Platini]] captained France to victory at [[UEFA Euro 1984]].]]\n\nUnder Hidalgo, France flourished, mainly due to the accolades of great players like defenders [[Marius Tr\u00e9sor]] and [[Maxime Bossis]], striker [[Dominique Rocheteau]] and midfielder [[Michel Platini]], who, alongside [[Jean Tigana]], [[Alain Giresse]] and [[Luis Fern\u00e1ndez]] formed the ''\"carr\u00e9 magique\"'' (\"Magic Square\"), which would haunt opposing defenses beginning at the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]], where France reached the semi-finals losing on penalties to rivals [[Germany national football team|West Germany]]. The semi-final match-up is considered one of the greatest matches in World Cup history and was [[History of the France national football team#1982 World Cup|marred with controversy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fff.fr/servfff/historique/match_detail.php?nomatch=419|title=France v. Germany 1982 Match Report |work=French Football Federation|accessdate=4 June 2010}}</ref> France earned their first major international honor two years later, winning [[UEFA Euro 1984|Euro 1984]], which they hosted. Under the leadership of Platini, who scored a tournament-high nine goals, France defeated [[Spain national football team|Spain]] 2\u20130 in the final. Platini and [[Bruno Bellone]] scored the goals. Following the Euro triumph, Hidalgo departed the team and was replaced by former international [[Henri Michel]]. France later completed the hat-trick when they won gold at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] [[Football at the 1984 Summer Olympics|football tournament]] and, a year later, defeated Uruguay 2\u20130 to win the [[Artemio Franchi Trophy]], an early precursor to the [[FIFA Confederations Cup]]. [[Dominique Rocheteau]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Tour\u00e9]] scored the goals. In a span of a year, France were holders of three of the four major international trophies. At the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]], France were favorites to win the competition, and, for the second consecutive World Cup, reached the semi-finals where they faced West Germany. Again, however, they lost. A 4\u20132 victory over Belgium gave France third place.\n\nIn 1988, the FFF opened the [[INF Clairefontaine|Clairefontaine]] National Football Institute. Its opening ceremony was attended by then-[[President of France]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]]. Five months after Clairefontaine's opening, manager [[Henri Michel]] was fired and was replaced by Michel Platini, who failed to get the team to the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]]. Platini did lead the team to [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 1992]] and, despite going on a 19-match unbeaten streak prior to the competition, suffered elimination in the group stage. A week after the completion of the tournament, Platini stepped down as manager and was replaced by his assistant [[G\u00e9rard Houllier]]. Under Houllier, France and its supporters experienced a heartbreaking meltdown after having qualification to the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] all but secured with two matches to go, which were against last place [[Israel national football team|Israel]] and [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]]. In the match against Israel, France were upset 3\u20132 and, in the Bulgaria match, suffered an astronomical 2\u20131 defeat. The [[History of the France national football team#1994 World Cup qualification debacle|subsequent blame and public outcry]] to the firing of Houllier and departure of several players from the national team fold. His assistant [[Aim\u00e9 Jacquet]] was given his post.\n\n{{football squad on pitch|align=right\n| GK  = [[Fabien Barthez|'''Barthez''']]\n| RB  = [[Lilian Thuram|'''Thuram''']]\n| RCB = [[Frank Leboeuf|'''Leboeuf''']]\n| LCB = [[Marcel Desailly|'''Desailly''']]\n| LB  = [[Bixente Lizarazu|'''Lizarazu''']]\n| DM = [[Didier Deschamps|'''Deschamps''']]\n| RCM = [[Christian Karembeu|'''Karembeu''']]\n| LCM  = [[Emmanuel Petit|'''Petit''']]\n| RAM  = [[Zinedine Zidane|'''Zidane''']]\n| LAM  = [[Youri Djorkaeff|'''Djorkaeff''']]\n| CF  = [[St\u00e9phane Guivarc'h|'''Guivarc'h''']]\n| caption = France starting line-up against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup Final]], a match they won 3\u20130.\n}}\nUnder Jacquet, the national team experienced its triumphant years. The squad composed of veterans that failed to reach the 1994 FIFA World Cup were joined by influential youngsters, such as [[Zinedine Zidane]]. The team started off well reaching the semi-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 1996]], where they lost 6\u20135 on penalties to the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]]. In the team's next major tournament at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] at home, Jacquet led France to glory defeating Brazil 3\u20130 in the final at the [[Stade de France]] in Paris. Jacquet stepped down after the country's World Cup triumph and was succeeded by assistant [[Roger Lemerre]] who guided them through [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]]. Led by [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] Zidane, France defeated Italy 2\u20131 in the final. [[David Trezeguet]] scored the [[golden goal]] in [[extra time]]. The victory gave the team the distinction of being the first national team to hold both the World Cup and Euro titles since West Germany did so in 1974, and it was also the first time that a reigning World Cup winner went on to capture the Euro. Following the result, the France national team was inserted to the number one spot in the [[FIFA World Rankings]].\n\n[[File:Zinedine zidane wcf 2006-edit.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Zinedine Zidane]] captaining France at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]]]\nFrance failed to maintain that pace in subsequent tournaments. Although, the team won the [[2001 FIFA Confederations Cup]], France suffered a first round elimination at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]]. One of the greatest shocks in World Cup history saw France condemned to a 1\u20130 defeat to debutantes [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] in the opening game of the tournament. France became the second nation to be eliminated in the first round while holding the World Cup crown, the first one being Brazil in 1966. After the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]], and [[2018 World Cup]]s, Italy, Spain, and Germany were also added to this list.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/worldcup/world-cup-2014-spain-and-the-world-cup-holders-who-crashed-out-at-the-group-stage-9547351.html |accessdate = 18 April 2015 |newspaper = The Independent |date=18 June 2014|last=Krishnan|first=Joe|title=World Cup 2014: Spain and the World Cup holders who crashed out at the group stage }}</ref> After France finished bottom of the group, Lemerre was dismissed and was replaced by [[Jacques Santini]]. A full strength team started out strongly at [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]], but they were upset in the quarter-finals by the eventual winners [[Greece national football team|Greece]]. Santini resigned as coach and [[Raymond Domenech]] was picked as his replacement. France struggled in the early qualifiers for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. This prompted Domenech to persuade several past members out of international retirement to help the national team qualify, which they accomplished following a convincing 4\u20130 win over [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] on the final day of qualifying. In the 2006 World Cup final stages, France finished undefeated in the group stage portion and advanced all the way to the final defeating the likes of [[Spain national football team|Spain]], Brazil and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] en route. France played Italy in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] and, in part down to [[Zidane vs. Materazzi|controversial disruptions in extra time]] that lead to captain Zinedine Zidane being sent off, failed to find a winning goal, Italy winning 5\u20133 on penalties to be crowned World Cup champions.\n[[File:France national football team 2006.JPG|thumb|The French team in front of fans in 2006.]]\nFrance started its [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group B|qualifying round]] for [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] strong and qualified for the tournament, despite two defeats to [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]].

In the first leg, France defeated the Irish 1\u20130 and in the second leg procured a 1\u20131 draw, via [[Republic of Ireland vs France (2010 FIFA World Cup Play-Off)|controversial circumstances]], to qualify for the World Cup.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hand of Henry Sends France to South Africa|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/19/sports/soccer/19france.html|work=New York Times|date=18 November 2009|accessdate=12 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2010 World Cup final stages, the team continued to perform under expectations and were eliminated in the group stage, while the negative publicity the national team received during the competition led to further repercussions back in France.

France also hosted matches at the [[Stade Pershing]], [[Stade de Paris]], and the [[V\u00e9lodrome Buffalo|Stade Buffalo]], but to a minimal degree. As the years moved forward, France began hosting matches outside the city of Paris at such venues as the [[Stade Marcel Saupin]] in [[Nantes]], the [[Stade V\u00e9lodrome]] in [[Marseille]], the [[Stade de Gerland]] in [[Lyon]], and the [[Stade de la Meinau]] in [[Strasbourg]].\n[[File:StadeFranceNationsLeague2018.jpg|thumb|[[Stade de France]]]]\nFollowing the [[renovation]] of the Parc des Princes in 1972, which gave the stadium the largest capacity in Paris, France moved into the venue permanently. The team still hosted [[Exhibition match|friendly matches]] and minor [[FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA European Football Championship]] qualification matches at other venues. Twice France have played home matches in a French overseas department&nbsp;\u2013 in 2005 against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] in [[Fort-de-France]] ([[Martinique]]) and in 2010 against [[China national football team|China]] in [[Saint-Denis, R\u00e9union|Saint Denis]] ([[R\u00e9union]]). Both matches were friendlies.\n\nIn 1998, the [[Stade de France]] was inaugurated as France's national stadium ahead of the 1998 World Cup. Located in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], a Parisian suburb, the stadium has an all-seater capacity of 81,338. France's first match at the stadium was played on 28 January 1998 against Spain. France won the match 1\u20130, with Zinedine Zidane scoring the lone goal. Since that match, France has used the stadium for almost every major home game, including the [[1998 FIFA World Cup Final|1998 World Cup final]].\n\nPrior to matches, home or away, the national team trains at the [[INF Clairefontaine]] academy in [[Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines]]. Clairefontaine is the national association football centre and is among 12 \u00e9lite academies throughout the country. The centre was inaugurated in 1976 by former FFF president [[Fernand Sastre]] and opened in 1988. The center drew media spotlight following its usage as a base camp by the team that won the 1998 World Cup.\n\nIn the 20th and 23rd minute of an [[international friendly]] on 13 November 2015, against Germany, [[November 2015 Paris attacks|three groups of terrorists attempted to detonate bomb vests, at three entrances of Stade de France, and two explosions occurred]]. Play would continue, until the 94th minute, in order to keep the crowd from panicking. Consequently, the stadium was evacuated through the unaffected gates of the stadium away from the players benches. Due to the blocked exits, spectators who could not leave the stadium had to go down to the pitch and wait until it was safer.\n\n==Team image==\n===Media coverage===\nThe national team has a broadcasting agreement with [[TF1 Group]], who the Federal Council of the FFF agreed to extend its exclusive broadcasting agreement with the channel.

In a 1978 World Cup match against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in [[Mar del Plata]], both teams arrived at [[Estadio Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Minella]] with white kits, so France played in green-and-white striped shirts borrowed from [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Kimberley]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/may/21/joy-of-six-world-cup|title=The Joy of Six: Things we miss about the World Cup|last=Murray|first=Scott|date=21 May 2010|work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=21 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Zidane-France-2006-home-shirt.jpg|thumb|left|150px|France's [[Zinedine Zidane]] number 10 home shirt, as made by [[Adidas]]]]\nBeginning in 1966, France had its shirts made by [[Le Coq Sportif]] until 1971.

The team is also referred to as ''Les Tricolores'' or ''L'Equipe Tricolore'' (The Tri-color Team) due to the team's utilization of the country's national colors: blue, white, and red. During the 1980s, France earned the nickname the ''\"Brazilians of Europe\"'' mainly due to the accolades of the ''\"carr\u00e9 magique\"'' (\"Magic Square\"), who were anchored by [[Michel Platini]]. Led by coach [[Michel Hidalgo]], France exhibited an inspiring, elegant, skillful and technically advanced offensive style of football, which was strikingly similar to their [[Brazil national football team|South American counterparts]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fourfourtwo.com/interviews/one-on-one/147/article.aspx|title=One-On-One: Michel Platini |work=FourFourTwo |accessdate=4 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Representation of multi-ethnic France===\nThe France national team has long reflected the [[Cultural diversity|ethnic diversity]] of the country. Already in its first decades, there were in the France national team players that were considered of non-\"genuinely\" French origin, being descendants of immigrants of former colonies of the [[French Colonial Empire]] or of European countries neighboring France. The first black player to play in the national team was [[Raoul Diagne]] in 1931. Diagne was the son of the first African elected to the [[National Assembly of France|French National Assembly]], [[Blaise Diagne]]. Seven years later, Diagne played on the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]] team that featured [[Michel Brusseaux]], the second footballer of North African descent to play for the national team (after [[Abdelkader Ben Bouali]] who was selected to play against [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]] in 1937). At the 1958 World Cup, in which France reached the semi-finals, many sons of immigrants (such as [[Raymond Kopa]], [[Just Fontaine]], [[Roger Piantoni]], [[Maryan Wisnieski]] and Bernard Chiarelli) were integral to the team's success. The tradition has since continued, with successful French players such as [[Michel Platini]], [[Jean Tigana]], [[Manuel Amoros]], [[Eric Cantona]], [[Zinedine Zidane]], [[Patrick Vieira]], [[David Trezeguet]], [[Claude Makelele]], [[Samir Nasri]], [[Hatem Ben Arfa]], [[Karim Benzema]], and [[Kylian Mbapp\u00e9]] all having either one or both of their parents foreign-born.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the team was widely celebrated as an example of the modern [[Demographics of France|multicultural]] French ideal.<ref>{{cite news |title = Wider view of France '98 gives Emmanuel Petit opportunity to look back in anger |work=The Times |location=UK |date = 1 March 2010 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/international/article7044481.ece |accessdate=27 July 2010  | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti}}</ref> The 1998 World Cup-winning team was celebrated and praised for inspiring pride and optimism about the prospects for the \"French model\" of [[social integration]].<ref>{{cite news |title = France's multicultural World Cup-winning team (1998) achieved little for integration |publisher=United for Peace of Pierce County |date = 11 November 2005|url=http://www.ufppc.org/us-a-world-news-mainmenu-35/3626-background-frances-multicultural-world-cup-winning-team-1998-achieved-little-for-integration.html |accessdate=28 July 2010}}</ref> Of the 23 players on the team, the squad featured players who could trace their origins to Armenia, Algeria, [[Guadeloupe]], [[New Caledonia]], Argentina, Ghana, Senegal, Italy, [[French Guiana]], Portugal and [[Martinique]], with the [[patriarch]] of the team being Zinedine Zidane, who was born in [[Marseille]] to Algerian immigrants.\n[[File:France - Bi\u00e9lorussie 2017-10-10 Stade France St Denis Seine St Denis 9.jpg|thumb|left|France v Belarus at the Stade de France in October 2017.]]\nThe multiracial makeup of the team has, at times, provoked controversy. In recent years, critics on the [[Far right leagues|far right of the French political spectrum]] have taken issue with the proportional under-representation of ethnic white Frenchmen within the team. [[National Front (France)|National Front]] politician [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] protested in 1998 that the ''Black, Blanc, [[Beur]]'' team that won the World Cup did not look sufficiently French. In 2002, led by Ghanaian-born [[Marcel Desailly]], the French team unanimously and publicly appealed to the French voting public to reject the presidential candidacy of Le Pen and, instead, return President [[Jacques Chirac]] to office. In 2006, Le Pen resumed his criticism charging that coach Raymond Domenech had selected too many black players.<ref>{{cite news |title = The Sword is Mightier than Le Pen |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date = 7 July 2006 |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=373084&root=worldcup&cc=5901 |accessdate=17 August 2006}}</ref> In 2005, French-Jewish conservative writer [[Alain Finkielkraut]] caused controversy by punning to the Israeli newspaper ''Haaretz'' that despite its earlier slogan, \"the French national team is in fact black-black-black,\" and also adding that, \"France is made fun of all around Europe because of that.\" He later apologized for the comments declaring that they were not meant to be offensive.<ref>{{cite news|title=Finkielkraut sur Europe 1|work=Le Nouvel Observateur|location=France|date=25 November 2005|url=http://archquo.nouvelobs.com/cgi/articles?ad=societe/20051125.OBS6590.html&host=http://permanent.nouvelobs.com/|accessdate=25 November 2005|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312151704/http://archquo.nouvelobs.com/cgi/articles?ad=societe%2F20051125.OBS6590.html|archivedate=12 March 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:France national football team 2018.jpg|thumb|right|250px|France lining up before a friendly against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] in 2018]]\nThe socio-ethnic divide between the public and the team reached a climax during the 2010 World Cup. Once in South Africa, the team did not manage to score a goal in their first two matches, leaving almost no chance of going through save an exceptional win over hosts South Africa. Thereafter, the players went on strike because of what they saw as mismanagement of the Nicolas Anelka case. Anelka had been forced to depart after a slur that leaked to the press. Players said he was misquoted, and complained of the alleged leaker from the staff, the media, and the federation. Instead of training, coach Raymond Domenech read the players' petition live on television to the stunned journalists.\n\nThe national team's overall impact on France's efforts to integrate its minorities and come to terms with its colonial past has been mixed. In 2001, France played a friendly match at the Stade de France, the site of its 1998 World Cup triumph, against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]]. It was the country's first meeting with its former colony, with whom it had fought a [[Algerian War|war from 1954 to 1962]], and it proved controversial. France's national anthem, ''[[La Marseillaise]]'', was booed by Algerian supporters before the game, and following a French goal that made the score 4\u20131 in the second half, spectators ran onto the field of play, which caused play to be suspended. It was never resumed.\n\nIn April 2011, the French investigative website Mediapart released a story which claimed that the FFF had been attempting to secretly put in place a quota system in order to limit the number of dual-citizenship players in its national academies. Quoting a senior figure in the FFF, the organization was said to have wanted to set a cap of 30% on the number of players of dual-nationality by limiting places in the academies in the 12\u201313 age bracket.<ref>{{cite news |title = French football body to investigate 'race quota' claim |agency=[[BBC]] |date = 30 April 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13236864 |accessdate= 9 May 2011 }}</ref> The FFF responded by releasing a public statement on its website denying the report, stating, \"[N]one of its elected bodies has been validated, or even contemplated a policy of quotas for the recruitment of its training centers.\"<ref>{{cite news |title = Le DTN suspendu de ses fonctions |agency=[[French Football Federation]] |date = 30 April 2011 |url=http://www.fff.fr/presentationfff/actualite/537335.shtml |accessdate= 9 May 2011 | language = French }}</ref> The FFF also announced that it had authorized a full investigation into the matter and, as a result, suspended National Technical Director Fran\u00e7ois Blaquart pending the outcome of the investigation.<ref>{{cite news |title = Pr\u00e9cision de la FFF |agency=[[French Football Federation]] |date = 30 April 2011 |url=http://www.fff.fr/presentationfff/actualite/537336.shtml |accessdate= 9 May 2011 | language = French }}</ref> Former national team player [[Lilian Thuram]] said of the allegations, \"Initially I thought this was a joke. I'm so stunned I don't know what to say,\" while [[Patrick Vieira]] declared that comments allegedly made by manager Laurent Blanc at the meeting were \"serious and scandalous\". The [[French government]] also weighed in on the issue, as then President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] was quoted as being \"viscerally opposed to any form of quota\", while adding \"setting quotas would be the end of the Republic\". Following the investigation, Blanc was cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\nWhen France won the 2018 World Cup, of the 23 man squad, only [[Benjamin Pavard]], [[Florian Thauvin]] and [[Hugo Lloris]] were of entirely white French backgrounds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/87-of-france-s-world-cup-winning-team-are-immigrants-or-children-of-immigrants|title=87% of France's World Cup-winning team are immigrants or children of immigrants|date=2018-07-18|website=www.sportskeeda.com|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref>\n\n==Coaching staff==\n[[File:Didier Deschamps in 2018.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Didier Deschamps]], the current coach of the French national football team.]]\n:''As of August 2019''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fff.fr/equipes-de-france/1/france-a/staff |title = Le staff des Bleus |work=[[French Football Federation]] |date=5 August 2010 |accessdate=10 June 2018 | language = French}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
