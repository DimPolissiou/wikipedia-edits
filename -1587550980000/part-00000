[[Delegate (United States Congress)|Non-voting delegates]] from the [[District of Columbia]] and four of the five inhabited [[Insular area|U.S. territories]]{{efn|Not including the [[Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico]], who serves a four-year term.}} were also elected.

In the 1980s, home cinemas typically consisted of a movie pre-recorded on a LaserDisc or VHS tape; a  [[LaserDisc]] or [[VHS]] player; and a heavy, bulky large-screen [[cathode ray tube]] TV set. In the 2000s, technological innovations in sound systems, video player equipment and TV screens and [[video projector]]s have changed the equipment used in home cinema set-ups and enabled home users to experience a higher-resolution screen image, improved sound quality and components that offer users more options (e.g., many of the more expensive [[Blu-ray]] players in 2016 can also [[streaming video|\"stream\"]] movies and TV shows over the [[Internet]] using subscription services such as [[Netflix]]). The development of Internet-based subscription services means that 2016-era home theatre users do not have to commute to a [[video rental store]] as was common in the 1980s and 1990s (nevertheless, some movie enthusiasts buy DVD or Blu-ray discs of their favourite content).\n\nIn the 2020s, a home cinema system typically uses a large projected image from a [[video projector]] or a large flat-screen high-resolution [[HDTV]] system, a [[movie]] or other video content on a [[DVD]] or high-resolution [[Blu-ray]] disc, which is played on a DVD player or Blu-ray player, with the audio augmented with a multi-channel [[power amplifier]] and anywhere from two speakers and a stereo power amp (for [[stereo sound]]) to a 5.1 channel amplifier and five or more [[surround sound]] speaker cabinets (with a surround sound system). Whether home cinema enthusiasts have a stereo set-up or a 5.1 channel surround system, they typically use at least one low-frequency [[subwoofer]] speaker cabinet to amplify low-frequency effects from movie soundtracks and reproduce the deep pitches from the musical soundtrack.\n\n==Introduction==\nIn the 1950s, playing [[home movies]] became popular in the United States with middle class and upper-class families as [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] [[8 mm film]] projector equipment became more affordable. The development of multi-channel audio systems and later [[LaserDisc]] in the 1980s created a new paradigm for [[home video]], as it enabled movie enthusiasts to add better sound and images to their setup. In the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, a typical home cinema in the United States would have a [[LaserDisc]] or [[VHS]] player playing a movie, with the signal fed to a large [[rear-projection television]] set. Some people used expensive front projectors in a darkened viewing room. During the 1990s, watching movies on VHS at home became a popular leisure activity. Beginning in the late 1990s, and continuing throughout much of the 2000s, home-theater technology progressed with the development of the [[DVD-Video]] format (higher resolution than VHS), [http://www.dolby.com/us/en/technologies/dolby-digital.html Dolby Digital 5.1-channel audio] (\"[[surround sound]]\") speaker systems, and [[high-definition television]] (HDTV), which initially included bulky, heavy [[Cathode Ray Tube]] HDTVs and flat screen TVs.  In the 2010s, affordable large [[HDTV]] flatscreen TVs, high resolution [[video projector]]s (e.g., [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]]), [[3D television]] technology and the high resolution [[Blu-ray Disc]] (1080p) have ushered in a new era of home theater.\n\n===Recent developments===\nIn the 2010s, the term \"home cinema\" encompasses a range of systems meant for movie playback at home. The most basic and economical system could be a [[DVD player]], a [[standard definition]] (SD)  [[Large-screen television technology|large-screen television]] with at least a 27-inch (69&nbsp;cm) diagonal screen size, and an inexpensive \"[[home theater in a box]]\" surround sound amplifier/speaker system with a subwoofer. A more expensive home cinema set-up might include a Blu-ray disc player, [[home theater PC]] (HTPC) computer or [[digital media receiver]] streaming devices with a [[10-foot user interface]], a [[high-definition video|high-definition]] [[video projector]] and [[projection screen]] with over {{convert|100|in|ft m|adj=on}} diagonal screen size (or a large flatscreen HDTV), and a several-hundred-watt home theater receiver with five to eleven surround-sound speakers plus one or two powerful subwoofer(s). [[3D television|3D-TV]]-enabled home theaters make use of 3D TV sets/projectors and [[Blu-ray 3D]] players in which the viewers wear 3D-glasses, enabling them to see 3D content.\n\nHome cinema designs and layouts are a personal choice and the type of home cinema a user can set up depends on her/his budget and the space which is available within the home. The minimum set of requirements for a home theater are: a large television set or good quality [[video projector]] [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] (no new models sold in U.S.), [[LCD]], [[Digital Light Processing]] (DLP), [[plasma display]], [[organic light-emitting diode]] (OLED), [[Silicon X-tal Reflective Display]] (SXRD), [[Laser TV]], rear-projection TV, [[video projector]], Standard-definition television (SDTV),  HDTV, or 3D-TV at least 27 inches (69&nbsp;cm) measured diagonally, an [[AV receiver]] or [[pre-amplifier]] (surround processor) and amplifier combination  capable of at least stereo sound but preferably 5.1 Channel Dolby Digital and [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] audio, and something that plays or broadcasts movies in at least stereo sound such as a VHS HI-FI [[VCR]], LaserDisc player (no new stand-alone models of either are available; VHS VCRs are usually bundled in combo decks with DVD players), a DVD player, a Blu-ray disc player, [[Cable television|cable]] or [[Satellite television|satellite]] receiver, video game console, etc. Finally a set of speakers, at least two, are needed but more common are anywhere from six to eight with a subwoofer for bass or low-frequency effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hometheater.about.com/od/hometheaterbasicsfaq/f/htbasicfaq8.htm|title=How Much Cash Do I Need For A Home Theater Setup?|author=|date=|website=about.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe most-expensive home cinema set-ups, which can cost over $100,000 US, and which are in the homes of executives, [[celebrity|celebrities]] and high-earning professionals, have expensive, large, high-resolution digital [[Video projector|projector]]s and projection screens, and maybe even custom-built screening rooms which include cinema-style chairs and [[audiophile]]-grade sound equipment designed to mimic (or sometimes even exceed) commercial cinema performance.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Basic Home Theatre Design Flow Diagram.svg|thumb|right|300px|This chart shows some of the design flow options for home theatre in the 2000s.]]\nIn the 2010s, many home cinema enthusiasts aim to replicate, to the degree that is possible, the \"[[movie theatre|cinema]] experience\". To do so, many home cinema buffs purchase higher quality components than used for everyday television viewing on a relatively small TV with only built-in speakers. A typical home cinema includes the following components:\n#'''Movie or other viewing content''': As the name implies, one of the key reasons for setting up a home cinema is to watch movies on a large screen, which does a more effective job at reproducing filmed images of vast landscapes or epic battle sequences. As of 2016, home cinema enthusiasts using \"Smart\" Blu-ray players may also watch DVDs of TV shows, and recorded or live sports events or music concerts. As well, with a \"Smart\" player, a user may be able to [[streaming video|\"stream\"]] movies, TV shows and other content over the [[Internet]]. Many 2016-era DVD players and Blu-ray players also have inputs which allow users to view [[digital photo]]s and other content on the big screen.\n#'''Video and audio input devices''': One or more video/audio sources. High resolution movie media formats such as Blu-ray discs are normally preferred, though DVD or video game console systems are also used. Some home theaters include a [[Home theater PC|HTPC (Home Theater PC)]] with a [[Home theater PC|media center]] software application to act as the main library for video and music content using a [[10-foot user interface]] and [[remote control]]. In 2016, some of the more-expensive [[Blu-ray]] players can [[streaming video|\"stream\"]] movies and TV shows over the [[Internet]].\n#'''Audio and video processing devices''': Input signals are processed by either a standalone [[AV receiver]] or a [[preamplifier]] and Sound Processor for complex [[surround sound]] formats such as [[Dolby Pro-Logic]]/and or [[Dolby Pro Logic#Dolby Pro Logic II|Pro-logic II]], X, and Z, Dolby Digital, DTS, [[Dolby Digital EX]], [[DTS-ES]], [[Dolby Digital Plus]], [[Dolby TrueHD]] and [[DTS-HD Master Audio]]. The user selects the input (e.g., DVD, Blu-ray player, streaming video, etc.) at this point before it is forwarded to the output stage. Some AV receivers enable the viewer to use a remote control to select which input device or source to use.\n#'''Audio output''': Systems consist of [[preamplifier]]s, [[power amplifier]]s (both of which may be integrated into a single [[AV receiver]]) and two or more [[loudspeaker]]s mounted in [[speaker enclosure]]s. The audio system requires at least a stereo [[power amplifier]] and two speakers, for [[stereo sound]]; most systems have multi-channel surround sound power amplifier and six or more speakers (a [[5.1 surround sound]] system has left and right front speakers, a centre speaker, left and right rear speakers and a low-frequency subwoofer [[speaker enclosure]]). Some users have 7.1 Surround Sound. It is possible to have up to 11 speakers with additional subwoofers.\n#'''Video output''': A large-screen display, typically an [[HDTV]]. Some users may have a [[3D TV]].  As of 2015, flatscreen HDTV is the norm. Options include [[Liquid crystal display television]] (LCD), [[plasma TV]], [[OLED]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Feldstein|first1=Justin|title=Next Generation Televisions: Beyond Conventional LED and LCD Technologies|url=http://audioden.com/blog/item/next-generation-televisions-beyond-conventional-led-and-lcd-technologies|website=Audio Den|accessdate=11 April 2015}}</ref>  Home cinema users may also use a [[video projector]] and a [[movie screen]]. If a projector is used, a portable, temporary screen may be used or a screen may be permanently mounted on a wall.\n#'''Seating and atmosphere''': Comfortable seating is often provided to improve the cinema feel. Higher-end home theaters commonly also have sound insulation to prevent noise from escaping the room and specialized wall treatment to balance the sound within the room. Some luxury home cinemas have [[movie theatre]]-style padded chairs for guests.\n\n==Component systems vs. theater-in-a-box==\n[[File:Home cinema 01.jpg|thumb|left|A mid-level home theater system consisting of large-screen [[LCD television]], a [[Digibox|Sky+ HD]] satellite TV box, and a [[DVD player]] (and a Blu-ray Disc-capable [[PlayStation 3]] [[game console]]). The equipment is on a TV stand.]]\n\nHome cinemas can either be set up by purchasing individual components one by one (e.g., buying a multichannel amp from one manufacturer, a Blu-ray player from another manufacturer, speakers from another company, etc.) or a by purchasing a [[HTIB]] (Home Theater in a Box) package which includes all of components from a single manufacturer, with the exception of a TV or projector. HTIB systems typically include a DVD or Blu-ray player, a surround sound amplifier, five surround speakers, a subwoofer cabinet, cables and a remote. The benefit of purchasing separate components one by one is that consumers can attain improved quality in video or audio and better matching between the components and the needs of a specific room, or the consumer's needs.\n\nHowever, to buy individual components, a consumer must have knowledge of sound system and video system design and electronics and she or he must do research on the specifications of each component.  For instance, some speakers perform better in smaller rooms while others perform better in larger rooms and seating location must be considered. One of the challenges with buying all the components separately is that the purchaser must understand speaker impedance, power handling, and HDMI compatibility and cabling. Given these challenges, HTIB systems are a simpler and more cost-effective solution for many families and consumers; they are also better suited to smaller living spaces in semi-detached homes or apartments/condos where noise could be an issue. As well, buying an HTIB package is often less expensive than buying separate components.\n\n==Dedicated rooms==\n[[File:Projection-screen-home2.jpg|thumb|A large [[projection screen]] in a media room.]]\n[[File:Home-theater-tysto2.jpg|thumb|This example is of home theater screening room with [[video projector]] mounted in a box on the ceiling. Built-in shelves provide a place for movie decor, DVDs, and equipment. Note the component stack on the right, where the audio receiver, DVD player, secondary monitor, and video game system are located.]]\n\nSome home cinema enthusiasts build a dedicated room in their home for the theater. These more advanced installations often include sophisticated acoustic design elements, including \"room-in-a-room\" construction that isolates sound and provides an improved listening environment and a large screen, often using a high definition projector. These installations are often designated as \"screening rooms\" to differentiate them from simpler, less-expensive installations. In some movie enthusiast's home cinemas, this idea can go as far as completely recreating an actual small-scale cinema, with a projector enclosed in its own [[projection booth]], specialized furniture, curtains in front of the [[projection screen]], movie posters, or a [[popcorn]] or [[vending machine]] with [[snack food]] and candy. More commonly, real dedicated home theaters pursue this to a lesser degree.\n\nAs of 2016, the days of the $100,000 and over home cinema system is being usurped by the rapid advances in digital audio and video technologies, which has spurred a rapid drop in prices, making a home cinema set-up more affordable than ever before. This in turn has brought the true digital home theater experience to the doorsteps of the [[do-it-yourself]]ers, often for much less than the price of a low-budget economy car. As of 2016, consumer grade A/V equipment can meet some of the standards of a small modern commercial cinema (e.g., [[THX]] sound).\n\n===Seating===\nHome cinema seating consists of chairs or sofas specifically engineered and designed for viewing movies in a home cinema. Some home cinema seats have a [[cup holder]] built into the chairs' armrests and a shared armrest between each seat. Some seating has cinema-style chairs like those seen in a cinema, which feature a flip-up seat cushion. Other seating systems have plush leather reclining lounger types, with flip-out footrests. Available features include storage compartments, snack trays, [[tactile transducer]]s for low-frequency effects that can be felt through a chair (without creating high volume levels which could disturb other family members), and electric motors to adjust the chair. Home cinema seating tends to be more comfortable than seats in a public cinema.<ref>[http://articles.org/create-your-own-home-theater/ \"Create Your Own Home Theater\"], by Stargate Sonem, Articles Organization Free Directory.</ref>\n\n==Backyard cinema==\nIn homes that have an adequately sized backyard, it is possible for people to set up a home cinema in an outdoor area. Depending on the space available, it may simply be a temporary version with foldable screen, a video projector and couple of speakers, or a permanent fixture with a huge screen and dedicated audio set-up mounted in a weather-proof cabinet. Outdoor home cinemas are popular with BBQ parties and [[swimming pool|pool]] parties. Some specialist outdoor home-cinema companies are now marketing packages with [[inflatable movie screen]]s and purpose-built AV systems. Some people have expanded the idea and constructed mobile [[drive-in theater]]s that can play movies in public open spaces. Usually, these require a powerful projector, a laptop or DVD player, outdoor speakers or an FM transmitter to broadcast the audio to other [[car audio|car radios]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1950s\u20131970s===\nIn the 1950s, home movies became popular in the United States and elsewhere as [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] [[8 mm film]] ([[Path\u00e9]] 9.5&nbsp;mm in France) and camera and projector equipment became affordable. Projected with a small, portable [[movie projector]] onto a portable screen, often without sound, this system became the first practical home theater. They were generally used to show [[home movies]] of family travels and celebrations, but they also doubled as a means of showing some commercial films, or private [[pornography|stag film]]s. Dedicated home cinemas were called ''screening rooms'' at the time and were outfitted with 16&nbsp;mm or even 35&nbsp;mm projectors for showing commercial films. These were found almost exclusively in the homes of the very wealthy, especially those in the movie industry.\n\nPortable home cinemas improved over time with colour film, Kodak [[Super 8 mm film]] cartridges, and monaural sound but remained awkward and somewhat expensive. The rise of [[home video]] in the late 1970s almost completely killed the consumer market for 8&nbsp;mm film cameras and projectors, as VCRs connected to ordinary televisions provided a simpler and more flexible substitute.\n\n===1980s===\nThe development of multi-channel audio systems and [[LaserDisc]] in the 1980s added new dimensions for home cinema. The first-known home cinema system was designed, built and installed by Steve J. LaFontaine as a sales tool at Kirshmans furniture store in Metairie, Louisiana in 1974. He built a special sound room which incorporated the earliest quadraphonic audio systems, and he modified [[Sony Trinitron]] televisions for projecting the image. Many systems were sold in the New Orleans area in the ensuing years before the first public demonstration of this integration occurred in 1982 at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, Illinois. Peter Tribeman of NAD (U.S.) organized and presented a demonstration made possible by the collaborative effort of NAD, Proton, ADS, Lucasfilm and Dolby Labs, who contributed their technologies to demonstrate what a home cinema would \"look and sound\" like.\n\nOver the course of three days, retailers, manufacturers, and members of the consumer electronics press were exposed to the first \"home-like\" experience of combining a high-quality video source with multi-channel surround sound. That one demonstration is credited with being the impetus for developing what is now a multibillion-dollar business.\n\n===1990s===\nIn the early to mid-1990s, a typical home cinema would have a LaserDisc or VHS player fed to a large screen: rear projection for the more-affordable setups, and LCD or CRT front-projection in the more-elaborate systems. In the late 1990s, a new wave of home-cinema interest was sparked by the development of [[DVD-Video]], Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1-channel audio, and high-quality front video projectors that provide a cinema experience at a price that rivals a big-screen HDTV.\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:2000s home theater, \"California Casual\".jpg|thumb|A home cinema from the late 2000s, using a [[rear projection television]].]]\nIn the 2000s, developments such as [[high-definition video]], [[Blu-ray]] disc (as well as the now-obsolete [[HD DVD]] format, which lost the [[format war]] to Blu-ray) and newer high-definition 3D display technologies enabled people to enjoy a cinematic feeling in their own home at a  more-affordable price.  Newer [[lossless audio]] from Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, [[Digital Theater System|DTS-HD High Resolution Audio]] and [[DTS-HD Master Audio]] and speaker systems with more audio channels (such as 6.1, 7.1, 9.1, 9.2, [[10.2 surround sound|10.2]], and [[22.2 surround sound|22.2]]) were also introduced for a more cinematic feeling.\n\n===2010s===\n[[File:LG\uc804\uc790, 3D \ud648\uc2dc\uc5b4\ud130\ub85c \ubd81\ubbf8 3D AV \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uacf5\ub7b5 \uac15\ud654.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A store display for a home cinema package at a [[consumer electronics]] retailer. Some stores \"bundle\" home cinema components into a package which can be purchased for a lower cost than buying each component separately.]]\nBy the mid-2010s, the Blu-ray Disc medium had become a common home media standard, and online video streaming sources such as Netflix and YouTube were offering a range of high definition content, including some [[4K resolution|4K]] content (although various compression technologies are applied to make this streamed content feasible). The first [[4K Blu-ray]] discs were released in 2016. By this point, 4K TVs and computer monitors were rapidly declining in price and increasing in prevalence, despite a lack of native 4K content. While many DSP systems existed, DTS-HD Master Audio remained the studio standard for lossless [[surround sound]] encoding on Blu-ray, with five or seven native discrete channels. High definition video projectors also continued to improve and decrease in price, relative to performance.\n\nAs a result of continuing price reductions, large (up to 80<nowiki>''</nowiki>) TVs became a financially competitive alternative to video projectors in living room or even smaller dedicated room setups.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/projectors-vs-tvs/2/|title=Is there any reason to own a projector when big TVs are so cheap?

For this application, it is a measure of a room's [[ambient noise level]] at various frequencies. For example, in order for a theater to be [[THX]] certified, it must have an ambient sound level of NC-30 or less. This helps to retain the [[dynamic range]] of the system.<ref>Wood, Mike (2002).

In the 1980s, home cinemas typically consisted of a movie pre-recorded on a LaserDisc or VHS tape; a  [[LaserDisc]] or [[VHS]] player; and a heavy, bulky large-screen [[cathode ray tube]] TV set. In the 2000s, technological innovations in sound systems, video player equipment and TV screens and [[video projector]]s have changed the equipment used in home cinema set-ups and enabled home users to experience a higher-resolution screen image, improved sound quality and components that offer users more options (e.g., many of the more expensive [[Blu-ray]] players in 2016 can also [[streaming video|\"stream\"]] movies and TV shows over the [[Internet]] using subscription services such as [[Netflix]]). The development of Internet-based subscription services means that 2016-era home theatre users do not have to commute to a [[video rental store]] as was common in the 1980s and 1990s (nevertheless, some movie enthusiasts buy DVD or Blu-ray discs of their favourite content).\n\nIn the 2020s, a home cinema system typically uses a large projected image from a [[video projector]] or a large flat-screen high-resolution [[HDTV]] system, a [[movie]] or other video content on a [[DVD]] or high-resolution [[Blu-ray]] disc, which is played on a DVD player or Blu-ray player, with the audio augmented with a multi-channel [[power amplifier]] and anywhere from two speakers and a stereo power amp (for [[stereo sound]]) to a 5.1 channel amplifier and five or more [[surround sound]] speaker cabinets (with a surround sound system). Whether home cinema enthusiasts have a stereo set-up or a 5.1 channel surround system, they typically use at least one low-frequency [[subwoofer]] speaker cabinet to amplify low-frequency effects from movie soundtracks and reproduce the deep pitches from the musical soundtrack.\n\n==Introduction==\nIn the 1950s, playing [[home movies]] became popular in the United States with middle class and upper-class families as [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] [[8 mm film]] projector equipment became more affordable. The development of multi-channel audio systems and later [[LaserDisc]] in the 1980s created a new paradigm for [[home video]], as it enabled movie enthusiasts to add better sound and images to their setup. In the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, a typical home cinema in the United States would have a [[LaserDisc]] or [[VHS]] player playing a movie, with the signal fed to a large [[rear-projection television]] set. Some people used expensive front projectors in a darkened viewing room. During the 1990s, watching movies on VHS at home became a popular leisure activity. Beginning in the late 1990s, and continuing throughout much of the 2000s, home-theater technology progressed with the development of the [[DVD-Video]] format (higher resolution than VHS), [http://www.dolby.com/us/en/technologies/dolby-digital.html Dolby Digital 5.1-channel audio] (\"[[surround sound]]\") speaker systems, and [[high-definition television]] (HDTV), which initially included bulky, heavy [[Cathode Ray Tube]] HDTVs and flat screen TVs.  In the 2010s, affordable large [[HDTV]] flatscreen TVs, high resolution [[video projector]]s (e.g., [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]]), [[3D television]] technology and the high resolution [[Blu-ray Disc]] (1080p) have ushered in a new era of home theater.\n\n===Recent developments===\nIn the 2010s, the term \"home cinema\" encompasses a range of systems meant for movie playback at home. The most basic and economical system could be a [[DVD player]], a [[standard definition]] (SD)  [[Large-screen television technology|large-screen television]] with at least a 27-inch (69&nbsp;cm) diagonal screen size, and an inexpensive \"[[home theater in a box]]\" surround sound amplifier/speaker system with a subwoofer. A more expensive home cinema set-up might include a Blu-ray disc player, [[home theater PC]] (HTPC) computer or [[digital media receiver]] streaming devices with a [[10-foot user interface]], a [[high-definition video|high-definition]] [[video projector]] and [[projection screen]] with over {{convert|100|in|ft m|adj=on}} diagonal screen size (or a large flatscreen HDTV), and a several-hundred-watt home theater receiver with five to eleven surround-sound speakers plus one or two powerful subwoofer(s). [[3D television|3D-TV]]-enabled home theaters make use of 3D TV sets/projectors and [[Blu-ray 3D]] players in which the viewers wear 3D-glasses, enabling them to see 3D content.\n\nHome cinema designs and layouts are a personal choice and the type of home cinema a user can set up depends on her/his budget and the space which is available within the home. The minimum set of requirements for a home theater are: a large television set or good quality [[video projector]] [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] (no new models sold in U.S.), [[LCD]], [[Digital Light Processing]] (DLP), [[plasma display]], [[organic light-emitting diode]] (OLED), [[Silicon X-tal Reflective Display]] (SXRD), [[Laser TV]], rear-projection TV, [[video projector]], Standard-definition television (SDTV),  HDTV, or 3D-TV at least 27 inches (69&nbsp;cm) measured diagonally, an [[AV receiver]] or [[pre-amplifier]] (surround processor) and amplifier combination  capable of at least stereo sound but preferably 5.1 Channel Dolby Digital and [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] audio, and something that plays or broadcasts movies in at least stereo sound such as a VHS HI-FI [[VCR]], LaserDisc player (no new stand-alone models of either are available; VHS VCRs are usually bundled in combo decks with DVD players), a DVD player, a Blu-ray disc player, [[Cable television|cable]] or [[Satellite television|satellite]] receiver, video game console, etc. Finally a set of speakers, at least two, are needed but more common are anywhere from six to eight with a subwoofer for bass or low-frequency effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hometheater.about.com/od/hometheaterbasicsfaq/f/htbasicfaq8.htm|title=How Much Cash Do I Need For A Home Theater Setup?|author=|date=|website=about.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe most-expensive home cinema set-ups, which can cost over $100,000 US, and which are in the homes of executives, [[celebrity|celebrities]] and high-earning professionals, have expensive, large, high-resolution digital [[Video projector|projector]]s and projection screens, and maybe even custom-built screening rooms which include cinema-style chairs and [[audiophile]]-grade sound equipment designed to mimic (or sometimes even exceed) commercial cinema performance.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Basic Home Theatre Design Flow Diagram.svg|thumb|right|300px|This chart shows some of the design flow options for home theatre in the 2000s.]]\nIn the 2010s, many home cinema enthusiasts aim to replicate, to the degree that is possible, the \"[[movie theatre|cinema]] experience\". To do so, many home cinema buffs purchase higher quality components than used for everyday television viewing on a relatively small TV with only built-in speakers. A typical home cinema includes the following components:\n#'''Movie or other viewing content''': As the name implies, one of the key reasons for setting up a home cinema is to watch movies on a large screen, which does a more effective job at reproducing filmed images of vast landscapes or epic battle sequences. As of 2016, home cinema enthusiasts using \"Smart\" Blu-ray players may also watch DVDs of TV shows, and recorded or live sports events or music concerts. As well, with a \"Smart\" player, a user may be able to [[streaming video|\"stream\"]] movies, TV shows and other content over the [[Internet]]. Many 2016-era DVD players and Blu-ray players also have inputs which allow users to view [[digital photo]]s and other content on the big screen.\n#'''Video and audio input devices''': One or more video/audio sources. High resolution movie media formats such as Blu-ray discs are normally preferred, though DVD or video game console systems are also used. Some home theaters include a [[Home theater PC|HTPC (Home Theater PC)]] with a [[Home theater PC|media center]] software application to act as the main library for video and music content using a [[10-foot user interface]] and [[remote control]]. In 2016, some of the more-expensive [[Blu-ray]] players can [[streaming video|\"stream\"]] movies and TV shows over the [[Internet]].\n#'''Audio and video processing devices''': Input signals are processed by either a standalone [[AV receiver]] or a [[preamplifier]] and Sound Processor for complex [[surround sound]] formats such as [[Dolby Pro-Logic]]/and or [[Dolby Pro Logic#Dolby Pro Logic II|Pro-logic II]], X, and Z, Dolby Digital, DTS, [[Dolby Digital EX]], [[DTS-ES]], [[Dolby Digital Plus]], [[Dolby TrueHD]] and [[DTS-HD Master Audio]]. The user selects the input (e.g., DVD, Blu-ray player, streaming video, etc.) at this point before it is forwarded to the output stage. Some AV receivers enable the viewer to use a remote control to select which input device or source to use.\n#'''Audio output''': Systems consist of [[preamplifier]]s, [[power amplifier]]s (both of which may be integrated into a single [[AV receiver]]) and two or more [[loudspeaker]]s mounted in [[speaker enclosure]]s. The audio system requires at least a stereo [[power amplifier]] and two speakers, for [[stereo sound]]; most systems have multi-channel surround sound power amplifier and six or more speakers (a [[5.1 surround sound]] system has left and right front speakers, a centre speaker, left and right rear speakers and a low-frequency subwoofer [[speaker enclosure]]). Some users have 7.1 Surround Sound. It is possible to have up to 11 speakers with additional subwoofers.\n#'''Video output''': A large-screen display, typically an [[HDTV]]. Some users may have a [[3D TV]].  As of 2015, flatscreen HDTV is the norm.

Available features include storage compartments, snack trays, [[tactile transducer]]s for low-frequency effects that can be felt through a chair (without creating high volume levels which could disturb other family members), and electric motors to adjust the chair. Home cinema seating tends to be more comfortable than seats in a public cinema.<ref>[http://articles.org/create-your-own-home-theater/ \"Create Your Own Home Theater\"], by Stargate Sonem, Articles Organization Free Directory.</ref>\n\n==Backyard cinema==\nIn homes that have an adequately sized backyard, it is possible for people to set up a home cinema in an outdoor area. Depending on the space available, it may simply be a temporary version with foldable screen, a video projector and couple of speakers, or a permanent fixture with a huge screen and dedicated audio set-up mounted in a weather-proof cabinet. Outdoor home cinemas are popular with BBQ parties and [[swimming pool|pool]] parties. Some specialist outdoor home-cinema companies are now marketing packages with [[inflatable movie screen]]s and purpose-built AV systems. Some people have expanded the idea and constructed mobile [[drive-in theater]]s that can play movies in public open spaces. Usually, these require a powerful projector, a laptop or DVD player, outdoor speakers or an FM transmitter to broadcast the audio to other [[car audio|car radios]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1950s\u20131970s===\nIn the 1950s, home movies became popular in the United States and elsewhere as [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] [[8 mm film]] ([[Path\u00e9]] 9.5&nbsp;mm in France) and camera and projector equipment became affordable. Projected with a small, portable [[movie projector]] onto a portable screen, often without sound, this system became the first practical home theater. They were generally used to show [[home movies]] of family travels and celebrations, but they also doubled as a means of showing some commercial films, or private [[pornography|stag film]]s. Dedicated home cinemas were called ''screening rooms'' at the time and were outfitted with 16&nbsp;mm or even 35&nbsp;mm projectors for showing commercial films. These were found almost exclusively in the homes of the very wealthy, especially those in the movie industry.\n\nPortable home cinemas improved over time with colour film, Kodak [[Super 8 mm film]] cartridges, and monaural sound but remained awkward and somewhat expensive. The rise of [[home video]] in the late 1970s almost completely killed the consumer market for 8&nbsp;mm film cameras and projectors, as VCRs connected to ordinary televisions provided a simpler and more flexible substitute.\n\n===1980s===\nThe development of multi-channel audio systems and [[LaserDisc]] in the 1980s added new dimensions for home cinema. The first-known home cinema system was designed, built and installed by Steve J. LaFontaine as a sales tool at Kirshmans furniture store in Metairie, Louisiana in 1974. He built a special sound room which incorporated the earliest quadraphonic audio systems, and he modified [[Sony Trinitron]] televisions for projecting the image. Many systems were sold in the New Orleans area in the ensuing years before the first public demonstration of this integration occurred in 1982 at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, Illinois. Peter Tribeman of NAD (U.S.) organized and presented a demonstration made possible by the collaborative effort of NAD, Proton, ADS, Lucasfilm and Dolby Labs, who contributed their technologies to demonstrate what a home cinema would \"look and sound\" like.\n\nOver the course of three days, retailers, manufacturers, and members of the consumer electronics press were exposed to the first \"home-like\" experience of combining a high-quality video source with multi-channel surround sound. That one demonstration is credited with being the impetus for developing what is now a multibillion-dollar business.\n\n===1990s===\nIn the early to mid-1990s, a typical home cinema would have a LaserDisc or VHS player fed to a large screen: rear projection for the more-affordable setups, and LCD or CRT front-projection in the more-elaborate systems. In the late 1990s, a new wave of home-cinema interest was sparked by the development of [[DVD-Video]], Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1-channel audio, and high-quality front video projectors that provide a cinema experience at a price that rivals a big-screen HDTV.\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:2000s home theater, \"California Casual\".jpg|thumb|A home cinema from the late 2000s, using a [[rear projection television]].]]\nIn the 2000s, developments such as [[high-definition video]], [[Blu-ray]] disc (as well as the now-obsolete [[HD DVD]] format, which lost the [[format war]] to Blu-ray) and newer high-definition 3D display technologies enabled people to enjoy a cinematic feeling in their own home at a  more-affordable price.  Newer [[lossless audio]] from Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, [[Digital Theater System|DTS-HD High Resolution Audio]] and [[DTS-HD Master Audio]] and speaker systems with more audio channels (such as 6.1, 7.1, 9.1, 9.2, [[10.2 surround sound|10.2]], and [[22.2 surround sound|22.2]]) were also introduced for a more cinematic feeling.\n\n===2010s===\n[[File:LG\uc804\uc790, 3D \ud648\uc2dc\uc5b4\ud130\ub85c \ubd81\ubbf8 3D AV \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uacf5\ub7b5 \uac15\ud654.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A store display for a home cinema package at a [[consumer electronics]] retailer. Some stores \"bundle\" home cinema components into a package which can be purchased for a lower cost than buying each component separately.]]\nBy the mid-2010s, the Blu-ray Disc medium had become a common home media standard, and online video streaming sources such as Netflix and YouTube were offering a range of high definition content, including some [[4K resolution|4K]] content (although various compression technologies are applied to make this streamed content feasible). The first [[4K Blu-ray]] discs were released in 2016. By this point, 4K TVs and computer monitors were rapidly declining in price and increasing in prevalence, despite a lack of native 4K content. While many DSP systems existed, DTS-HD Master Audio remained the studio standard for lossless [[surround sound]] encoding on Blu-ray, with five or seven native discrete channels. High definition video projectors also continued to improve and decrease in price, relative to performance.\n\nAs a result of continuing price reductions, large (up to 80<nowiki>''</nowiki>) TVs became a financially competitive alternative to video projectors in living room or even smaller dedicated room setups.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/projectors-vs-tvs/2/|title=Is there any reason to own a projector when big TVs are so cheap?

For this application, it is a measure of a room's [[ambient noise level]] at various frequencies. For example, in order for a theater to be [[THX]] certified, it must have an ambient sound level of NC-30 or less. This helps to retain the [[dynamic range]] of the system.<ref>Wood, Mike (2002).

For example, for a home cinema to be THX certified, it has to have a rating of NC 22.<ref>DeBoer, Clint (2007).[http://www.audioholics.com/news/trade-show-coverage/2004-cedia-expo/thx-certified-home-theater-program \"THX Certified Home Theater Program.\"] ''Audioholics Online A/V Magazine.''</ref>\n*NC 10: Virtually impossible noise criteria to attain; 10 decibels is associated with the sound level of calm breathing.\n\nProjectors used for home cinemas have a set of recommended criteria:\n\n*Brightness, usually at least 1800 [[lumen (unit)|lumen]]s.\n*Resolution (the number of [[pixel]]s making up the image), usually at least 1920\u00d71080, one of the [[HDTV]] standards.\n*Contrast (how well white, black and greyscales are displayed), usually a minimum of 5000:1.{{Elucidate|date=February 2016}}\n*[[HDMI]] connection sockets (Although some people use older [[Component video]],connections with three-cord sockets for the different individual colours)\n*Good quality manufacturers, although this is a subjective element which depends upon user tastes and budget.

''NY Mag''. 7 April 2017.</ref>\n\n==Background==\n===Process===\nUtah's 2018 U.S. Senate candidates had dual routes toward placement on the [[primary election]] ballot: (1) eligibility via win or second-place showings at a convention of delegates selected from party local [[caucus]]es; and/or (2) eligibility via obtaining sufficient [[petition]] signatures.\n\nTaking the traditional route, the top two candidates for the U.S. Senate at any of the [[party state convention]]s (to be held this year the latter part of April) will be placed on the June 26 primary election ballot. Also, any candidate who collects 28,000 ballot-access petition signatures will be placed on the primary ballot.\n\nIf no competitor will have achieved the above-mentioned alternate access to the primary ballot through collected signatures and a convention winner had achieved sixty-percent of delegate votes, this candidate straightaway receives his or her party's nomination solely via the older-style caucuses-convention system. Otherwise, a candidate will be nominated through receiving a plurality of votes in the primary election and thereby advance to the November general election.\n\nIncumbent [[Orrin Hatch]] did not seek reelection.<ref name=nyt-retire>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/us/politics/orrin-hatch-retiring-romney-trump.html |title= Orrin Hatch to Retire from Senate, Opening Path for Mitt Romney |first= Jonathan |last= Martin |date= January 2, 2018 |newspaper= The New York Times |accessdate= January 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Hatch to retire===\nIncumbent Republican U.S. Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] was reelected to a seventh term in 2012.

''NY Mag''. 7 April 2017.</ref>\n\n==Background==\n===Process===\nUtah's 2018 U.S. Senate candidates had dual routes toward placement on the [[primary election]] ballot: (1) eligibility via win or second-place showings at a convention of delegates selected from party local [[caucus]]es; and/or (2) eligibility via obtaining sufficient [[petition]] signatures.\n\nTaking the traditional route, the top two candidates for the U.S. Senate at any of the [[party state convention]]s (to be held this year the latter part of April) will be placed on the June 26 primary election ballot. Also, any candidate who collects 28,000 ballot-access petition signatures will be placed on the primary ballot.\n\nIf no competitor will have achieved the above-mentioned alternate access to the primary ballot through collected signatures and a convention winner had achieved sixty-percent of delegate votes, this candidate straightaway receives his or her party's nomination solely via the older-style caucuses-convention system. Otherwise, a candidate will be nominated through receiving a plurality of votes in the primary election and thereby advance to the November general election.\n\nIncumbent [[Orrin Hatch]] did not seek reelection.<ref name=nyt-retire>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/us/politics/orrin-hatch-retiring-romney-trump.html |title= Orrin Hatch to Retire from Senate, Opening Path for Mitt Romney |first= Jonathan |last= Martin |date= January 2, 2018 |newspaper= The New York Times |accessdate= January 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Hatch to retire===\nIncumbent Republican U.S. Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] was reelected to a seventh term in 2012.

This [[off-year election]] featured [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2017|gubernatorial elections]] in [[Virginia]] and [[New Jersey]], as well as [[State legislature (United States)|state legislative]] elections in both houses of the [[New Jersey Legislature]] and in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] (the [[lower house]] of the Virginia legislature). Numerous [[Initiative|citizen initiative]]s, [[mayor]]al races, and a variety of other local elections also occurred. [[Special elections]] were also held for one seat of the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], representing Alabama, and six seats of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]].\n\nThe Democrats picked up the governorship in New Jersey and the Alabama Senate seat that was up for a special election. The governorship in Virginia and the six House seats that were up for special elections did not change party hands.\n\nAnalysts such as [[Harry Enten]] of [[FiveThirtyEight]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/special-elections-so-far-point-to-a-democratic-wave-in-2018/|title=Special Elections So Far Point To A Democratic Wave In 2018|date=December 13, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}</ref> and [[Chris Cillizza]] of [[CNN]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/14/politics/big-number-house-analysis/index.html|title=This number suggests a MAJOR Democratic wave in 2018|first=Chris|last=Cillizza|publisher=|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}</ref> interpreted the 2017 election results overall as demonstrating a move toward the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. With the Democrats picking up the Senate seat in Alabama, it reduced the Republicans' majority in the Senate to 51\u201349. The analysts also noted that although none of five House seats held by a Republican switched to the other party in the 2017 special elections, in each race the Democrat received a higher percentage of votes than in recent elections for the same seat. Furthermore, Democrats made large gains in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]], and picked up 42 seats in state legislatures.\n==Federal elections==\nThe following special elections were held to replace Senators or Representatives who resigned in the [[115th United States Congress|115th U.S. Congress]]:\n\n===Senate===\n* [[United States Senate special election in Alabama, 2017|Alabama Class 2]]: incumbent [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Jeff Sessions]] was confirmed by the Senate to serve as [[United States Attorney General]] on February 8, 2017, and subsequently resigned from the Senate. [[Governor of Alabama|Governor]] [[Robert J. Bentley]] chose [[Luther Strange]], the [[Attorney General of Alabama]], to succeed Sessions, filling the seat until the special election takes place. Although he had the power to schedule an election in 2017, Bentley decided to align it with the 2018 general election. Following Bentley's resignation in April 2017, Governor [[Kay Ivey]] decided to reschedule the elections. The primary election took place on August 15 with [[Doug Jones (politician)|Doug Jones]] winning the Democratic nomination. [[Roy Moore]] was nominated as the Republican candidate on September 26.

This [[off-year election]] featured [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2017|gubernatorial elections]] in [[Virginia]] and [[New Jersey]], as well as [[State legislature (United States)|state legislative]] elections in both houses of the [[New Jersey Legislature]] and in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] (the [[lower house]] of the Virginia legislature). Numerous [[Initiative|citizen initiative]]s, [[mayor]]al races, and a variety of other local elections also occurred. [[Special elections]] were also held for one seat of the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], representing Alabama, and six seats of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]].\n\nThe Democrats picked up the governorship in New Jersey and the Alabama Senate seat that was up for a special election.

With the Democrats picking up the Senate seat in Alabama, it reduced the Republicans' majority in the Senate to 51\u201349. The analysts also noted that although none of five House seats held by a Republican switched to the other party in the 2017 special elections, in each race the Democrat received a higher percentage of votes than in recent elections for the same seat. Furthermore, Democrats made large gains in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]], and picked up 42 seats in state legislatures.\n==Federal elections==\nThe following special elections were held to replace Senators or Representatives who resigned in the [[115th United States Congress|115th U.S. Congress]]:\n\n===Senate===\n* [[United States Senate special election in Alabama, 2017|Alabama Class 2]]: incumbent [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Jeff Sessions]] was confirmed by the Senate to serve as [[United States Attorney General]] on February 8, 2017, and subsequently resigned from the Senate. [[Governor of Alabama|Governor]] [[Robert J. Bentley]] chose [[Luther Strange]], the [[Attorney General of Alabama]], to succeed Sessions, filling the seat until the special election takes place. Although he had the power to schedule an election in 2017, Bentley decided to align it with the 2018 general election. Following Bentley's resignation in April 2017, Governor [[Kay Ivey]] decided to reschedule the elections. The primary election took place on August 15 with [[Doug Jones (politician)|Doug Jones]] winning the Democratic nomination. [[Roy Moore]] was nominated as the Republican candidate on September 26. Jones won the election on December 12, 2017 after allegations of sexual misconduct towards minors against Roy Moore made the race closer than initially expected.

These were, in addition to Catalan schoolchildren who were fortunate enough to stay in their school, refugees from Madrid who had witnessed tragic events. The Brauners made a pedo-psychiatric analysis of the child's drawing, a privileged mode of graphic expression of the young child, highlighting what seems to them characteristic of the child's drawing in the war, taking notes, creating medical records and questionnaires. Drawings and writings of children of the Spanish War were the result of a contest organized by Alfred Brauner among the children of Barcelona in 1938 on three themes: \"My life Before the War\", \"What I Saw from the War\" and \"How I See My Life after the War\". <ref name=thesis/>. It was then the beginning of their work on \"children who have lived through the war.\" 4000 drawings of refugee children and numerous essays were collected in Spain, which later, along with other drawings of children in war, offered a unique testimony of the conflicts of the 20th century through the eyes of children. <ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 =Ibarz Serrat  | first1 = Virgilio  | authorlink = | title = Los dibujos infantiles de la guerra 1937-1938: el caso de la ni\u00f1a de Ballobar | doi = | journal = Diario del AltoArag\u00f3n | volume =  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2009  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref>.

These were, in addition to Catalan schoolchildren who were fortunate enough to stay in their school, refugees from Madrid who had witnessed tragic events. The Brauners made a pedo-psychiatric analysis of the child's drawing, a privileged mode of graphic expression of the young child, highlighting what seems to them characteristic of the child's drawing in the war, taking notes, creating medical records and questionnaires. Drawings and writings of children of the Spanish War were the result of a contest organized by Alfred Brauner among the children of Barcelona in 1938 on three themes: \"My life Before the War\", \"What I Saw from the War\" and \"How I See My Life after the War\". <ref name=thesis/>. It was then the beginning of their work on \"children who have lived through the war.\" 4000 drawings of refugee children and numerous essays were collected in Spain, which later, along with other drawings of children in war, offered a unique testimony of the conflicts of the 20th century through the eyes of children. <ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 =Ibarz Serrat  | first1 = Virgilio  | authorlink = | title = Los dibujos infantiles de la guerra 1937-1938: el caso de la ni\u00f1a de Ballobar | doi = | journal = Diario del AltoArag\u00f3n | volume =  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2009  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref>.
