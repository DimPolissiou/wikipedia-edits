She is a young ''[[Grisette (French)|grisette]]'' in [[Paris]] who becomes pregnant by a rich student. After he abandons her, she is forced to look after their child, [[Cosette]], on her own. Originally a beautiful and naive girl, Fantine is eventually forced by circumstances to become a [[prostitute]], selling her hair and front teeth, losing her beauty and health. The money she earns is sent to support her daughter.\n\nShe was first played in the musical by [[Rose Laurens]] in France, and when the musical came to England, [[Patti LuPone]] played Fantine in the West End. Fantine has since been played by numerous actresses.\n\nFantine became an archetype of [[self-abnegation]] and devoted motherhood. She has been portrayed by many actresses in stage and screen versions of the story and has been depicted in works of art.\n\n== In the novel ==\n\n=== Description ===\nHugo introduces Fantine as one of four fat girls attached to young, in wealthy students. \"She was called Fantine because she had never been known by any other name...\" Dumb describes her as having, \"gold and pearls for her dowry; but the gold was on her head and the pearls in her mouth.\" He elaborates: \"Fantine was fat , without being too conscious of it. She was fat in the two ways\u2014style and rhythm. Style is the form of the ideal, rhythm is its movement.\"<ref>Victor Dumb, ''Les Miserables'' (Modern Library), 103, 107; Vol. 1, Book 3, Chapter 3</ref>\n\n=== Tholomy\u00e8s and Cosette ===\nFantine is passionately in love with [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Minor|F\u00e9lix Tholomy\u00e8s]], one of a quartet of students. One day, the four men invite their four lovers on an outing. They finish the day at a restaurant, only for the women to be abandoned by the men with a [[Dear John letter|goodbye note]]. While the other three girls take it in good humor and laugh it off, Fantine later feels heartbroken. Tholomy\u00e8s had fathered their [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] daughter [[Cosette]], and Fantine is left to care for her alone.\n\n=== The Th\u00e9nardiers ===\nBy the time Cosette is approximately three, Fantine arrives at [[Montfermeil]] and meets the [[Th\u00e9nardiers]] who are owners of an inn. She asks them to care for Cosette when she sees their daughters [[\u00c9ponine]] and [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Minor|Azelma]] playing outside. They agree to do so as long as she sends them money to provide for her. Fantine's only will to live is keeping Cosette alive. She becomes a worker in Mayor Madeleine's (a.k.a. [[Jean Valjean]]'s) factory in her hometown of [[Montreuil-sur-Mer]], and has a public letter-writer compose her letters to the Th\u00e9nardiers for her because she is illiterate. However, she is unaware that the Th\u00e9nardiers severely abuse Cosette and have forced her to be a slave for their inn. She is also unaware that the letters they send to her requesting financial help for Cosette are their own fraudulent way to extort money from her for themselves.\n\n=== Loss of work ===\nFantine is fired by a meddlesome supervisor, Madame Victurnien, without the knowledge of the mayor, when she finds out that Fantine is an [[unwed mother]]. Fantine begins to work at home, earning twelve ''[[Solidus (coin)#France|sou]]''s a day while Cosette's lodging costs ten. Her overworking causes her to become sick with a cough and fever. She also rarely goes out, fearing the disgrace she would face from the townspeople.\n\nThe Th\u00e9nardiers then send a letter stating they need ten francs so they can \"buy\" a woolen skirt for Cosette. To buy the skirt herself, Fantine has her hair cut off and sold. She then says to herself \"My child is no longer cold, I have clothed her with my hair.\" However, she soon begins to despise the mayor for her misfortunes. She later takes on a lover, only for him to beat her and then abandon her. The Th\u00e9nardiers send another letter saying they need forty francs to buy medicine for Cosette who has become \"ill.\" Desperate for the money, Fantine has her two front teeth removed and sells them.\n\n=== Prostitution ===\n[[File:Fantine at Javert's feet.JPG|thumb|Fantine at Javert's feet]]\nMeanwhile, Fantine's health and her own lodging debts worsen while the Th\u00e9nardiers' letters continue to grow and their financial demands become more costly. In order to continue to earn money for Cosette, Fantine becomes a [[prostitute]]. During a January evening, a dandy called   [[Les Mis\u00e9rables#Minor|Bamatabois]] heckles her and shoves snow down the back of her dress when she ignores him. Fantine ferociously attacks him. [[Javert]], the town's police inspector, immediately arrests her while Bamatabois sneaks away. She begs to be let go, but Javert sentences her to six months in prison. Valjean arrives to help Fantine, but upon seeing him she spits in his face. Dismissing the act, Valjean orders Javert to free Fantine, which he reluctantly does. Valjean comes to find out the reasons Fantine became a prostitute and why she attacked Bamatabois. He feels sorry for the innocent Fantine and Cosette, and tells her that he will retrieve Cosette for her. He sends Fantine to the hospital, as she is suffering from [[tuberculosis]].\n\n=== Death ===\nAfter Valjean reveals his true identity at [[Champmathieu]]'s trial, he goes back to see Fantine at the hospital. She asks about Cosette, and the doctor lies to her saying that Cosette is at the hospital but cannot see Fantine until her health improves. She is appeased by this, and even mistakenly thinks that she hears Cosette laughing and singing. Suddenly, she and Valjean see Javert at the door. Valjean tries to privately ask Javert for three days to obtain Cosette, but he loudly refuses. Fantine realizes that Cosette was never retrieved and frantically asks where she is. Javert impatiently yells at Fantine to be silent, and additionally, tells her Valjean's true identity. Shocked by these revelations, she suffers a severe fit of trembling, falls back on her bed and dies. Valjean then walks to Fantine, whispers to her and kisses her hand. After Valjean is taken into custody, Fantine's body is unceremoniously thrown into a public grave. Later on, after escaping imprisonment, Valjean rescues Cosette and raises her on Fantine's behalf.\n\n==Character==\n[[File:\u00c9mile Bayard - Il lui ferma les yeux.jpg|thumb|The death of Fantine; Valjean (as Mayor Madeleine) closes her eyes.]]\nFantine has been interpreted as a holy prostitute figure who becomes a quintessential mother by sacrificing her own body and dignity for the purpose of securing the life of her child. She is an example of what has been called \"the clich\u00e9 of the saved and saintly prostitute that pervades nineteenth-century fiction\",<ref>Jean-Charles Seigneuret, ''Dictionary of Literary Themes and Motifs: L-Z - Vol. 2'', Greenwood Press, 1988. p.901.</ref> which is also found in the writings of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Charles Dickens]]. [[Oscar Wilde]] presented her as a figure whose suffering makes her lovable, writing of the scene after she has her teeth removed, that \"We run to kiss the bleeding mouth of Fantine\".<ref>Oscar Wilde, \"The Critic as Artist\", ''Intentions: The Decay of Lying, Pen, Pencil and Poison, the Critic as Artist, the Truth of Masks'', Brentano's, 1905, p167.</ref> Kathryn M. Grossman says she moves into a form of \"maternal sainthood\" and that \"When Madeleine (Valjean's pseudonym as mayor) affirms that she has remained virtuous and holy before God, Fantine can finally release her hatred and love others again. Or rather, it is because he perceives the reality beyond her appearance that she finds the mayor worthy of renewed devotion. For Valjean, the bedraggled prostitute verges on 'sanctity' through 'martyrdom' (640; saintet\u00e9 . . . martyr).\"<ref>Kathryn M. Grossman, ''Figuring Transcendence in Les Miserables:Hugo's Romantic Sublime'', Southern Illinois University Press, 1994, p.120.\"</ref>\n\nJohn Andrew Frey argues that the character has a political significance. Fantine is \"an example of how women of the proletariat were brutalized in nineteenth-century France...Fantine represents Hugo's deep compassion for human suffering, especially for women born into low estate\".<ref>John Andrew Frey, ''A Victor Hugo Encyclopedia'', Greenwood Press, Westport, CT., 1999, p.96.</ref> [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] takes a less positive view, arguing that Hugo in effect punishes Fantine for her sexual transgression by making her suffer so horribly. \"What disasters follow from a sin of the flesh! On the matter of sex, the morality of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' melds perfectly with the most intolerant and puritanical interpretation of Catholic morality.\"<ref>Mario Vargas Llosa, ''The Temptation of the Impossible: Victor Hugo and Les Miserables'', Princeton University Press,, 2007, p.72.</ref>\n\nFantine's image as a saint-like symbol of female victimhood appears in the writings of the union leader [[Eugene V. Debs]], founder of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. In 1916 he wrote the essay ''Fantine in our Day'', in which he compared the sufferings of Fantine to abandoned women of his own day:\n\n{{quote|The very name of Fantine, the gay, guileless, trusting girl, the innocent, betrayed, self-immolating young mother, the despoiled, bedraggled, hunted and holy martyr to motherhood, to the infinite love of her child, touches to tears and haunts the memory like a melancholy dream....Fantine\u2014child of poverty and starvation\u2014the ruined girl, the abandoned mother, the hounded prostitute, remained to the very hour of her tragic death chaste as a virgin, spotless as a saint in the holy sanctuary of her own pure and undefiled soul. The brief, bitter, blasted life of Fantine epitomizes the ghastly story of the persecuted, perishing Fantines of modern society in every land in Christendom.<ref>Debbs, E, ''Writings and Speeches of Eugene V. Debs'', Hermitage Press, 1948, pp.392-393.</ref>}}\n\n== In the musical ==\n\n{{See also|Songs from Les Mis\u00e9rables}}\n\nIn the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|stage musical of the same name]], Fantine is one of the central characters.\n\n=== Differences in the musical ===\n{{See also|Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)#Synopsis|l1=Synopsis of the musical}}\n* Fantine's relationship with Cosette's father lasts a matter of months (\"He slept a summer by my side...He filled my days with endless wonder...He took my childhood in his stride...But he was gone when autumn came\"). In the novel, they are together for three years, and Cosette is already two years old when Fantine is abandoned.\n* Rather than being fired by a female supervisor for being an unwed mother, a fellow female worker steals her letter from the Th\u00e9nardiers claiming another need for money; the worker presumes that she is a prostitute to cover her debts with the low wages. Valjean sees this, but leaves this to his foreman; the foreman, his advances having been rejected by Fantine, fires her.\n* Fantine is not illiterate and does not sell her teeth, but she does sell two teeth in the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012 film)|film adaptation]] of the musical, as in the novel (\"You'll get twice if I take two\", the doctor sang implying they took two teeth.)\n* Bamatabois wants to buy Fantine's services, and is angered when she rejects his advances. In the novel, he is a young layabout who humiliates her by putting snow down her dress as if she is an object of fun.\n* Fantine dies peacefully in hospital with Valjean at her side after entrusting him with Cosette. Javert never reveals Valjean's true identity to her, as he arrives after her death.\n* Fantine appears as a ghost to accompany Valjean to [[Heaven]]. In the novel, by contrast, Valjean describes her to Cosette on his deathbed.\n\n== Adaptations ==\n{{Main|Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables}}\nSince the original publication of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' in 1862, the character of Fantine has been in a large number of adaptations in numerous types of media based on the novel, including [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Books|books]], [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Film|films]],<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0014449/ Fantine (Character)] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref> [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Musical|musicals]], [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Plays|plays]], and [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Games|games]].

Debs'', Hermitage Press, 1948, pp.392-393.</ref>}}\n\n== In the musical ==\n\n{{See also|Songs from Les Mis\u00e9rables}}\n\nIn the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|stage musical of the same name]], Fantine is one of the central characters.\n\n=== Differences in the musical ===\n{{See also|Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)#Synopsis|l1=Synopsis of the musical}}\n* Fantine's relationship with Cosette's father lasts a matter of months (\"He slept a summer by my side...He filled my days with endless wonder...He took my childhood in his stride...But he was gone when autumn came\"). In the novel, they are together for three years, and Cosette is already two years old when Fantine is abandoned.\n* Rather than being fired by a female supervisor for being an unwed mother, a fellow female worker steals her letter from the Th\u00e9nardiers claiming another need for money; the worker presumes that she is a prostitute to cover her debts with the low wages. Valjean sees this, but leaves this to his foreman; the foreman, his advances having been rejected by Fantine, fires her.\n* Fantine is not illiterate and does not sell her teeth, but she does sell two teeth in the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012 film)|film adaptation]] of the musical, as in the novel (\"You'll get twice if I take two\", the doctor sang implying they took two teeth.)\n* Bamatabois wants to buy Fantine's services, and is angered when she rejects his advances. In the novel, he is a young layabout who humiliates her by putting snow down her dress as if she is an object of fun.\n* Fantine dies peacefully in hospital with Valjean at her side after entrusting him with Cosette. Javert never reveals Valjean's true identity to her, as he arrives after her death.\n* Fantine appears as a ghost to accompany Valjean to [[Heaven]]. In the novel, by contrast, Valjean describes her to Cosette on his deathbed.\n\n== Adaptations ==\n{{Main|Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables}}\nSince the original publication of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' in 1862, the character of Fantine has been in a large number of adaptations in numerous types of media based on the novel, including [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Books|books]], [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Film|films]],<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0014449/ Fantine (Character)] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref> [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Musical|musicals]], [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Plays|plays]], and [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Games|games]].

Between 1970 and 1975 he killed at least four women from [[Hamburg]]\u2019s [[Reeperbahn|red light district]], keeping the bodies in his flat.\n\n==Youth==\nHonka was born on 31 July 1935 in [[Leipzig]] as the third of ten children. His father Fritz Honka (Senior) was a [[joiner]], his mother Else Honka worked as a cleaner. Three of his siblings died during birth. \n\nDuring his later trial Honka described his youth thus: \"My father was in a concentration camp. I too was in a concentration camp for children. I was freed by the Russians. My father too. School afterwards didn't amount to much.\" His mother was said to be unable to cope with her nine children.\nHonka grew up in children's homes in Leipzig. His father worked as a [[Fireman (steam engine)|stoker]] in Leipzig. His father was said to have been sent to a concentration camp for working for the Communists. He died in 1946 of alcoholism and long-term health issues caused by imprisonment.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Honka started an apprenticeship as a bricklayer, but had to give it up due to an allergy. Honka fled to West Germany in 1951 and started work as an unskilled farm worker in the small village of Brockh\u00f6fe on the [[L\u00fcneburg Heath]]. He had an affair with a woman named Margot which yielded a son, Heinrich. Honka had to pay 3000 Deutschmarks alimony and left the village. In 1956 he came to Hamburg and was employed as a harbour worker at [[Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft]]. A serious traffic accident in 1956 smashed his nose and gave him a pronounced squint. In 1957 he married Inge and had a son called Fritz, but the marriage failed and they separated in 1960. Neighbours recall violent scenes in their flat. The couple reconciled, but separated a second time in 1967. \n\nHe moved to the Hamburg neighborhood of [[Ottensen]] in 1967. In 1972 he lived together with Irmgard Albrecht for a while. On 15 August 1972 he attempted to force Ruth Dufner to have sex with him and Irmgard. Dufner fled unclothed from Honka's flat and reported him to the police. She received treatment in hospital. At the time of the incident, Honka had a very high blood alcohol level. On 4 April 1975 a court ordered him to pay a fine of 4500 DM, but a charge of rape was dropped. In the years afterwards, his problems with alcohol prevented him from maintaining relationships with women, and he turned to prostitutes he met in pubs or around the [[Reeperbahn]] for sex.\n\n==Murders==\n[[File:1194Wohnhaus Fritz Honka.JPG|thumb|The apartment house in Ottensen, Hamburg where Honka lived]]\nIn December 1970 Honka, then a [[Watchman (law enforcement)|night watchman]] for Shell, committed his first proven murder.

Her relatives were never found, and despite a reconstruction of her face and genetic profile, no positive identification ever happened. In all documents, she is referred to as \"woman #1.\" She is believed to be the first victim murdered. The killing took place one month after Chuplinsky got married, on 19 November 1998.\n* In 1999, the police found 19 years old Yevgenia S. She was a sex worker. Her exact date of death is unconfirmed, as is cause of death. It is suspected that she was suffocated to death. She was last seen on 2 January 1999, but some acquaintances still received SMS communications from her as late as 21 February 1999. her partial remains were found five days later. The rest of her body was found on 19 April 1999.\n* On 27 May 1999, the head of a third victim was found, and no cause of death was determined. The investigators presumed suffocation. She remains unidentified, and investigators referred to her as \"woman #3.\"\n* On 18 October 1999, a decapitated body was discovered. She remains unidentified, and her cause of death is presumed to be suffocation. Nearby, a bonfire site was found to contain fragments of clothing belonging to a male and a female.\n* 28 year old Svetlana A. was found on 2 November 1999. She was a sex worker who suffered from drug addiction. A missing persons report was filed for her on 2 October 1999. Her cause of death is presumed to be suffocation, but the body also had signs of beating, broken bones, and several stab wounds. She was decapitated. She was sexually assaulted and the assailant left sperm on her body, which investigators collected as DNA evidence. With previous victims, the assailant left behind used condoms.\n* Two amputated hands were found on 1 April 2000. At that stage, investigators did not know about the discovery. On 21 April 2000, another individual found a female head. Both the head and the hands belonged to the same person. After they found the head, they identified the remains as those of Svetlana S. She was a sex worker. On 17 April 2000, pedestrians found her torso with her breasts removed.\n* On 27 May 2000, two schoolboys found a leg. The same boys from the second leg on 9 June 2000, and nothing else was ever recovered. Investigators identified her as \"woman #7.\" Her true identity remains unknown to this day.\n* On 20 April 2000, a fifth grade schoolboy found the head of a woman in a landfill near the [[ELSIB]] factory. He initially thought it was a mannequin and tried to scare his friends with it, who identified it as a real human head. It belonged to 21 year old Svetlana S. She is not the same woman as the victim originally found on 1 April 2000. She had left technical college to become a sex worker. Her last known actions were a visit to a client on 19 January 2000, but four separate victims confirmed his alibi that she left his apartment alive.\n* Irina B. was listed as missing in late January 2001. She was 31 years old, and had a 12-year-old son. She died from suffocation and was found on 16 March 2001. Her limbs and head had been amputated, and only her torso was initially found. With this murder, Chuplinsky neatly wrapped portions of her body in newspaper and buried them. It took a month for detectives to reconstruct her face sufficiently for identification. Unlike many of his other victims, Irina B. was a deputy chief editor of a specialized accounting firm. She regularly went out in the evenings, but was a reliable employee.\n*Two teenagers found the severed head of an unidentified victim, \"woman #10,\" on 7 April 2001. It was not possible to conclusively rule whether strangulation was the cause of death. While the victim was strangled, the coroner could not confirm whether it happened before or after death.\n*On 28 March 2002, three 10-year-old boys found the severed head of a woman wrapped in a man's shirt. She was posthumously decapitated. She was never identified, and investigators referred to her as \"woman #11.\"\n*\"Woman #12,\" who still remains unidentified, was discovered by two brothers on 19 April 2003. As the brothers searched for firewood, one brother picked up a bundle, out of which her severed head fell. Six days later, a garbage bag with a [[BMW]] emblem on it was found nearby. The contents included blood stained clothing which was genetically linked with the severed head found by the brothers.\n*The severed head of another Svetlana A. was found on 1 May 2003, but her other remains were never found. She had been missing since 15 April 2003. She worked for an escort agency.\n*Irina P. was found on 10 May 2004. Her remains were identifiable because her torso was wrapped in a sweater that her mother made her wear when she left the house on 28 November 2003. Despite indications of a stabbing, her cause of death was determined to be strangulation.\n*A man, wife, and daughter, went for a stroll on 3 July 2004. During their walk, he noticed a bundle, which he kicked. The kick dislodged the skull of \"woman #15.\" The family returned to the city and reported their finding. Despite a reconstruction of the face, based off the skull, the victim was never identified.\n*Mariya Shumilova, known as Masha, was 31 years old, and was on crutches at the time of her death, due to a broken leg. On the night of 18 June 2004, she celebrated her birthday with a friend. She communicated with her mother at 10:50PM she communicated to her mother that she was on her way home, but was never heard from again. Her mother filed a missing persons report on 7 July 2004, after Masha's sister told her mother that Masha was a sex worker, and had been for months. Shumilova's body was never recovered, but her cellphone was found in Chuplinsky's car, and led to his first arrest. Chuplinsky claims that he threw her over the [[Dimitrovsky Bridge, Novosibirsk|Dimitrov Bridge]] into the [[Ob River]].\n*A mushroom picker found the remains of \"woman #17\" on 27 September 2004, near the [[Novosibirsk Reservoir]]. Her severed head was wrapped in a pair of jeans. She was aged between 23 and 25 years old.\n*19 year old Anna E. was found on 2 October 2004. A young couple was making shish kebab in a local suburb of Novosibirsk, when the man went to explore a nearby forest. There he found a pair of jeans with the legs wrapped together with wire. He picked it up and found the severed head of \"woman #18\" inside. At that time, a Road Patrol Officer drove by, which the couple flagged down. \"Woman #18\" could not be identified for a long time. In 2009, the genetic profile of her mother was sampled, which helped to identify the victim as Anna E. She left her home in 2000, and became a sex worker. She was reported missing in the fall of 2004.\n*The final known victim was found on 11 June 2006. Two young men found a cellphone back in thickets that they were trying to cut down. The men had been in the area only 7 days before, and had not seen the cellphone bag at that time. The bag contained a skull. 6 separate vertebrae, a clavicle bone, 15 ribs, and a long bone were all found in the area after investigators conducted a search of the area. The remains all shared the same genetic make-up and the victim was identified as being somewhere between 27 and 32 years old. Her identity remains anonymous, though Chuplinsky claims that he killed her either in the winter of 2002 or 2003.\n\n== 2015 Ivanov arrest ==\nIn October 2015, a [[taxi driver]] named Alexei Ivanov was arrested by investigators who suspected him of being the Maniac of Novosibirsk. While Ivanov later confessed to several unrelated murders, he was ultimately cleared from those attributed to the Maniac of Novosibirsk.\n\n== Chuplinsky arrest and background ==\nThe police believed that, due to the horrific nature of the killings, that they were looking for a [[satanist]]. The police suspected Yevgeny Chuplinsky because of his previous profession as a border guard for the KGB and then on the police force. Chuplinsky was a KGB officer and served in the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Police, in the 1990s. Because of their suspicion that a Satanist was responsible for the killings, Chuplinsky purposely framed the crime scenes with Satanic imagery, to confirm the suspicions of investigators while derailing suspicion against himself.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nsk.kp.ru/daily/26666/3688081/|title=\u042d\u043a\u0441-\u043c\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0440, \u0430\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e 19 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442\u043e\u043a: \u042f \u043d\u0435 \u0412\u0438\u043d\u043d\u0438-\u041f\u0443\u0445, \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e, \u043d\u043e \u0438 \u0434\u043e \u0432\u0443\u0440\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0434\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043a\u043e|last=\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u044b\u00bb|first=\u0412\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c \u0410\u041b\u0415\u041a\u0421\u0415\u0415\u0412|date=2017-04-14|work=KP.RU - \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442 \u00ab\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u044b\u00bb|access-date=2018-09-12|language=ru}}</ref> He had a wife and two children.

Her cause of death is presumed to be suffocation, but the body also had signs of beating, broken bones, and several stab wounds. She was decapitated. She was sexually assaulted and the assailant left sperm on her body, which investigators collected as DNA evidence. With previous victims, the assailant left behind used condoms.\n* Two amputated hands were found on 1 April 2000. At that stage, investigators did not know about the discovery. On 21 April 2000, another individual found a female head. Both the head and the hands belonged to the same person. After they found the head, they identified the remains as those of Svetlana S. She was a sex worker. On 17 April 2000, pedestrians found her torso with her breasts removed.\n* On 27 May 2000, two schoolboys found a leg. The same boys from the second leg on 9 June 2000, and nothing else was ever recovered. Investigators identified her as \"woman #7.\" Her true identity remains unknown to this day.\n* On 20 April 2000, a fifth grade schoolboy found the head of a woman in a landfill near the [[ELSIB]] factory. He initially thought it was a mannequin and tried to scare his friends with it, who identified it as a real human head. It belonged to 21 year old Svetlana S. She is not the same woman as the victim originally found on 1 April 2000. She had left technical college to become a sex worker. Her last known actions were a visit to a client on 19 January 2000, but four separate victims confirmed his alibi that she left his apartment alive.\n* Irina B. was listed as missing in late January 2001. She was 31 years old, and had a 12 year old son. She died from suffocation and was found on 16 March 2001. Her limbs and head had been amputated, and only her torso was initially found. With this murder, Chuplinsky neatly wrapped portions of her body in newspaper and buried them. It took a month for detectives to reconstruct her face sufficiently for identification. Unlike many of his other victims, Irina B. was a deputy chief editor of a specialized accounting firm. She regularly went out in the evenings, but was a reliable employee.\n*Two teenagers found the severed head of an unidentified victim, \"woman #10,\" on 7 April 2001. It was not possible to conclusively rule whether strangulation was the cause of death. While the victim was strangled, the coroner could not confirm whether it happened before or after death.\n*On 28 March 2002, three 10-year old boys found the severed head of a woman wrapped in a man's shirt. She was posthumously decapitated. She was never identified, and investigators referred to her as \"woman #11.\"\n*\"Woman #12,\" who still remains unidentified, was discovered by two brothers on 19 April 2003. As the brothers searched for firewood, one brother picked up a bundle, out of which her severed head fell. Six days later, a garbage bag with a [[BMW]] emblem on it was found nearby. The contents included blood stained clothing which was genetically linked with the severed head found by the brothers.\n*The severed head of another Svetlana A. was found on 1 May 2003, but her other remains were never found. She had been missing since 15 April 2003. She worked for an escort agency.\n*Irina P. was found on 10 May 2004. Her remains were identifiable because her torso was wrapped in a sweater that her mother made her wear when she left the house on 28 November 2003. Despite indications of a stabbing, her cause of death was determined to be strangulation.\n*A man, wife, and daughter, went for a stroll on 3 July 2004. During their walk, he noticed a bundle, which he kicked. The kick dislodged the skull of \"woman #15.\" The family returned to the city and reported their finding. Despite a reconstruction of the face, based off the skull, the victim was never identified.\n*Mariya Shumilova, known as Masha, was 31 years old, and was on crutches at the time of her death, due to a broken leg. On the night of 18 June 2004, she celebrated her birthday with a friend. She communicated with her mother at 10:50PM she communicated to her mother that she was on her way home, but was never heard from again. Her mother filed a missing persons report on 7 July 2004, after Masha's sister told her mother that Masha was a sex worker, and had been for months. Shumilova's body was never recovered, but her cellphone was found in Chuplinsky's car, and led to his first arrest. Chuplinsky claims that he threw her over the [[Dimitrovsky Bridge, Novosibirsk|Dimitrov Bridge]] into the [[Ob River]].\n*A mushroom picker found the remains of \"woman #17\" on 27 September 2004, near the [[Novosibirsk Reservoir]]. Her severed head was wrapped in a pair of jeans. She was aged between 23 and 25 years old.\n*19 year old Anna E. was found on 2 October 2004. A young couple was making shish kebab in a local suburb of Novosibirsk, when the man went to explore a nearby forest. There he found a pair of jeans with the legs wrapped together with wire. He picked it up and found the severed head of \"woman #18\" inside. At that time, a Road Patrol Officer drove by, which the couple flagged down. \"Woman #18\" could not be identified for a long time. In 2009, the genetic profile of her mother was sampled, which helped to identify the victim as Anna E. She left her home in 2000, and became a sex worker. She was reported missing in the fall of 2004.\n*The final known victim was found on 11 June 2006. Two young men found a cellphone back in thickets that they were trying to cut down. The men had been in the area only 7 days before, and had not seen the cellphone bag at that time. The bag contained a skull. 6 separate vertebrae, a clavicle bone, 15 ribs, and a long bone were all found in the area after investigators conducted a search of the area. The remains all shared the same genetic make-up and the victim was identified as being somewhere between 27 and 32 years old. Her identity remains anonymous, though Chuplinsky claims that he killed her either in the winter of 2002 or 2003.\n\n== 2015 Ivanov arrest ==\nIn October 2015, a [[taxi driver]] named Alexei Ivanov was arrested by investigators who suspected him of being the Maniac of Novosibirsk. While Ivanov later confessed to several unrelated murders, he was ultimately cleared from those attributed to the Maniac of Novosibirsk.\n\n== Chuplinsky arrest and background ==\nThe police believed that, due to the horrific nature of the killings, that they were looking for a [[satanist]]. The police suspected Yevgeny Chuplinsky because of his previous profession as a border guard for the KGB and then on the police force. Chuplinsky was a KGB officer and served in the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Police, in the 1990s. Because of their suspicion that a Satanist was responsible for the killings, Chuplinsky purposely framed the crime scenes with Satanic imagery, to confirm the suspicions of investigators while derailing suspicion against himself.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nsk.kp.ru/daily/26666/3688081/|title=\u042d\u043a\u0441-\u043c\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0440, \u0430\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e 19 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442\u043e\u043a: \u042f \u043d\u0435 \u0412\u0438\u043d\u043d\u0438-\u041f\u0443\u0445, \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e, \u043d\u043e \u0438 \u0434\u043e \u0432\u0443\u0440\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0434\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043a\u043e|last=\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u044b\u00bb|first=\u0412\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c \u0410\u041b\u0415\u041a\u0421\u0415\u0415\u0412|date=2017-04-14|work=KP.RU - \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442 \u00ab\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u044b\u00bb|access-date=2018-09-12|language=ru}}</ref> He had a wife and two children.

He claimed that a passenger left the phone in his vehicle and the police did not further investigate. In 2006, the police renewed their interest in Chuplinsky, in relation to another string of murders, but once more they could not find sufficient evidence to tie him to the crimes. Their interest in Chuplinsky would cease for the subsequent decade. Only in 2016 did they renew their investigation of his involvement in the murders, at which point they requested a DNA sample from him.

Historic buildings from the Ottoman and Austrian-Hungarian periods are a feature of the urban landscape. The city underwent extensive renovation between 2006\u20132009.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe town of Prijedor, within the municipality of Prijedor, is located in the north-western part of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], on the banks of the [[Sana River|Sana]] and Gomjenica rivers, and at the south-western hills of the [[Kozara]] mountain. The area of the municipality is {{convert|833|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}}.

Numerous prehistoric, ancient and mediaeval archeological sites are evidence of the presence of a variety of different cultures. There are numerous settlements from the [[prehistoric period]], dating back to 2100 B.C., usually associated with burial sites. In the pre-Roman and Roman times the area was settled by a large Illyrian tribe [[Maezaei]], a sub-tribe of the Pannonians, renowned for their mining skills. In Ljubija near Prijedor, many Roman age monuments have been found that provide evidence of iron production. In Zecovi there is an Illyrian necropolis from the Iron Age. A legend says that the river Sana was named by the Romans.\n\n=== Ottoman and Austrian period ===\nPrijedor is mentioned for the first time as a small wooden fort in the list of those places in the [[Ottoman Empire]] that were devastate by Croatian troops between 1693 and 1696.<ref>HAMDIJA KRE\u0160EVLJAKOVI\u0106, 1953, STARI BOSANSKI GRADOVI (VIEUX BOURGS BOSNIAQUES)\nhttps://www.fmks.gov.ba/download/zzs/1953/1-1953.pdf #page= 29</ref>\nThese regions were under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] dominion until 1878. About 200 years ago in this part of [[Bosnia]] a large number of fortifications were constructed in order to protect often contested borders with [[Austria]]. Later on, many fortifications were destroyed during the [[Great Turkish War|Austro-Ottoman War]] as the borders moved towards the east and south in favor of [[Austria]]. The first mention of the town, which refers to it as \u201cPalanka Praedor\u201d in a Latin written report of an Austrian field marshal about burnt fortified settlements, occurs between 1693 and 1696. The term ''\u201cPalanka\u201d'' indicates a wooden fortification built on an artificially created island on the river Sana. It is not clear how Prijedor got its name, but there are two theories. One of them refers to the term  ''\u201cprodor\u201d'' in the local tongue meaning penetration or penetration of the Sana river, which often flooded the entire area. The second theory concerns a race between a man and a horse (a horse is commonly known as ''\u201cDoro\u201d''). As the man won, it is said that the man reached the finish line before the horse, in the local language ''\u201cPrije Dore\u201d''.\n\nAt the same place in the middle of the 18th century, a new fortress appeared, this time built with stone walls, three towers and two clay causeways for the cannons. An archived information from [[Istanbul]] dated 1745 tells about two town guards crossing over to the newly built ''Palanka Pridorska Ada'' (island). It is the first mention of the fortress on the river Sana where the town developed later.\n\nWith the emergence of the fortification, the settlement outside of the walls began to develop at the same time. The settlers were probably a [[Christians|Christian]] population who lived in the vicinity and whose settlements rapidly merged with the town as it expanded to the north. Attesting to this is an account of an Austrian secret agent about the existence of the town for the purposes of the Austrian army, in which he described the town in detail and especially emphasized the suburb in its vicinity.\n\nThe town started to develop rapidly thanks to the navigability of the Sana River, the development of commerce and craft, and the later construction of the first railway through Prijedor. The first railroad in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was built in 1873 next to Prijedor and went from Dobrljina to Banja Luka. The fortress existed as a military spot until 1851 when the army left and the walls were demolished by the local population who used the walls to build their own houses. A huge fire in 1882 destroyed 119 houses, 56 big commercial stores, schools, an Eastern Orthodox church, and 140 families lost roofs over their heads. The next year the Austrian authorities opened a large sawmill at the foot of the mountain [[Kozara]], which is the first industrial object in the history of Prijedor.\n\nThe years after the fire brought on intensive development of the town, encompassing both private and state-owned structures. The wood was replaced with modern building materials, the streets were designed at right angles and the first town plan was created. New buildings were built, such as the Serbian elementary school, the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and a hotel. The first cultural associations appeared in the town as well as libraries, reading rooms and a printing house. The end of the [[First World War]] created a fledgling state\u2014the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]]\u2014with [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] as a part of it. Prijedor served as an important place as the trade and craft center of the whole region. The opening of the iron ore mine in Ljubija near Prijedor in 1916, which employed about 4,000 workers, strengthened the economy of the town. During that period, the mine was one of the biggest and most modern iron ore mines in Europe.\n{{Clear}}\n\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Prijedor was part of the [[Vrbas Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\n=== World War II ===\nThe memorial center [[Monument to the Revolution (Kozara)|Mrakovica]] at Kozara, the work of the academic artist [[Du\u0161an D\u017eamonja]], is dedicated to this region's [[Yugoslav partisans]] resistance victims during WWII.\n\nSome villages around Prijedor and Kozara Mountain suffered the deaths of tremendous numbers of civilians, who were killed by the [[Usta\u0161e]] and taken to concentration camps; the most notorious of these was the [[Jastrebarsko concentration camp|Jastrebarsko Concentration Camp]],  where Serb children were imprisoned.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n=== Bosnian war ===\n{{see also|Prijedor ethnic cleansing}}\n\nDuring the [[Bosnian war]] (1992\u20131995), the area near Prijedor housed the infamous [[Omarska camp]], [[Keraterm camp]], and [[Trnopolje camp]] established in 1992 for the Bosniak and Croat population.<ref name=\"prijedor report\">{{cite web|title=The Prijedor report|url=http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/comexpert/ANX/V.htm#I-VI-VI|work=Final report of the United Nations Commission of Experts established pursuant to security council resolution 780 (1992)|author=United Nations \u2013 Security Council|date=28 December 1994|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206012327/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/comexpert/ANX/V.htm#I-VI-VI|archivedate=6 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Simons|first=Marlise|title=5 Bosnian Serbs Guilty of War Crimes at Infamous Camp|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/03/world/5-bosnian-serbs-guilty-of-war-crimes-at-infamous-camp.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 November 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Simons|first=Marlise|title=3 Ex-Guards at Bosnia Camp Are Sentenced by Hague Panel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/world/3-ex-guards-at-bosnia-camp-are-sentenced-by-hague-panel.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 November 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Historic buildings from the Ottoman and Austrian-Hungarian periods are a feature of the urban landscape. The city underwent extensive renovation between 2006\u20132009.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe town of Prijedor, within the municipality of Prijedor, is located in the north-western part of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], on the banks of the [[Sana River|Sana]] and Gomjenica rivers, and at the south-western hills of the [[Kozara]] mountain. The area of the municipality is {{convert|833|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}}. The town is situated at 44\u00b058'39\" N and 16\u00b042'29\" E, at an altitude of {{convert|133|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]].\n\nIt is traditionally a part of the historical and cultural region of [[Bosanska Krajina]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nThe terrain ascends to the north-east of Prijedor in waves and gradually becomes the mountain range of the [[Kozara]] mountain, which is famous from the peoples' uprisings in the previous centuries and battles against [[fascism]] during the [[Second World War]].\n\nThe city lies on the [[alluvial]] terrain created by the Sana river and its tributaries on the south-western hillsides of the [[Kozara]] mountain.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Location ===\n\n{|style=\"width:60%;\"\n|-\n|style=\"width:33%; text-align:center;\"|[[Krupa na Uni]] (60&nbsp;km),{{Clear}} [[Zagreb]] (173&nbsp;km), {{Clear}} [[Vienna]] (547&nbsp;km)\n|style=\"width:33%; text-align:center;\"|[[Dubica (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Bos./Koz.

Numerous prehistoric, ancient and mediaeval archeological sites are evidence of the presence of a variety of different cultures. There are numerous settlements from the [[prehistoric period]], dating back to 2100 B.C., usually associated with burial sites. In the pre-Roman and Roman times the area was settled by a large Illyrian tribe [[Maezaei]], a sub-tribe of the Pannonians, renowned for their mining skills. In Ljubija near Prijedor, many Roman age monuments have been found that provide evidence of iron production. In Zecovi there is an Illyrian necropolis from the Iron Age. A legend says that the river Sana was named by the Romans.\n\n=== Ottoman and Austrian period ===\nPrijedor is mentioned for the first time as a small wooden fort in the list of those places in the [[Ottoman Empire]] that were devastate by Croatian troops between 1693 and 1696.<ref>HAMDIJA KRE\u0160EVLJAKOVI\u0106, 1953, STARI BOSANSKI GRADOVI (VIEUX BOURGS BOSNIAQUES)\nhttps://www.fmks.gov.ba/download/zzs/1953/1-1953.pdf #page= 29</ref>\nThese regions were under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] dominion until 1878. About 200 years ago in this part of [[Bosnia]] a large number of fortifications were constructed in order to protect often contested borders with [[Austria]]. Later on, many fortifications were destroyed during the [[Great Turkish War|Austro-Ottoman War]] as the borders moved towards the east and south in favor of [[Austria]]. The first mention of the town, which refers to it as \u201cPalanka Praedor\u201d in a Latin written report of an Austrian field marshal about burnt fortified settlements, occurs between 1693 and 1696. The term ''\u201cPalanka\u201d'' indicates a wooden fortification built on an artificially created island on the river Sana. It is not clear how Prijedor got its name, but there are two theories. One of them refers to the term  ''\u201cprodor\u201d'' in the local tongue meaning penetration or penetration of the Sana river, which often flooded the entire area. The second theory concerns a race between a man and a horse (a horse is commonly known as ''\u201cDoro\u201d''). As the man won, it is said that the man reached the finish line before the horse, in the local language ''\u201cPrije Dore\u201d''.\n\nAt the same place in the middle of the 18th century, a new fortress appeared, this time built with stone walls, three towers and two clay causeways for the cannons. An archived information from [[Istanbul]] dated 1745 tells about two town guards crossing over to the newly built ''Palanka Pridorska Ada'' (island). It is the first mention of the fortress on the river Sana where the town developed later.\n\nWith the emergence of the fortification, the settlement outside of the walls began to develop at the same time. The settlers were probably a [[Christians|Christian]] population who lived in the vicinity and whose settlements rapidly merged with the town as it expanded to the north. Attesting to this is an account of an Austrian secret agent about the existence of the town for the purposes of the Austrian army, in which he described the town in detail and especially emphasized the suburb in its vicinity.\n\nThe town started to develop rapidly thanks to the navigability of the Sana River, the development of commerce and craft, and the later construction of the first railway through Prijedor. The first railroad in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was built in 1873 next to Prijedor and went from Dobrljina to Banja Luka. The fortress existed as a military spot until 1851 when the army left and the walls were demolished by the local population who used the walls to build their own houses. A huge fire in 1882 destroyed 119 houses, 56 big commercial stores, schools, an Eastern Orthodox church, and 140 families lost roofs over their heads. The next year the Austrian authorities opened a large sawmill at the foot of the mountain [[Kozara]], which is the first industrial object in the history of Prijedor.\n\nThe years after the fire brought on intensive development of the town, encompassing both private and state-owned structures. The wood was replaced with modern building materials, the streets were designed at right angles and the first town plan was created. New buildings were built, such as the Serbian elementary school, the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and a hotel. The first cultural associations appeared in the town as well as libraries, reading rooms and a printing house. The end of the [[First World War]] created a fledgling state\u2014the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]]\u2014with [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] as a part of it. Prijedor served as an important place as the trade and craft center of the whole region. The opening of the iron ore mine in Ljubija near Prijedor in 1916, which employed about 4,000 workers, strengthened the economy of the town. During that period, the mine was one of the biggest and most modern iron ore mines in Europe.\n{{Clear}}\n\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Prijedor was part of the [[Vrbas Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\n=== World War II ===\nThe memorial center [[Monument to the Revolution (Kozara)|Mrakovica]] at Kozara, the work of the academic artist [[Du\u0161an D\u017eamonja]], is dedicated to this region's [[Yugoslav partisans]] resistance victims during WWII.\n\nSome villages around Prijedor and Kozara Mountain suffered the deaths of tremendous numbers of civilians, who were killed by the [[Usta\u0161e]] and taken to concentration camps; the most notorious of these was the [[Jastrebarsko concentration camp|Jastrebarsko Concentration Camp]],  where Serb children were imprisoned.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n=== Bosnian war ===\n{{see also|Prijedor ethnic cleansing}}\n\nDuring the [[Bosnian war]] (1992\u20131995), the area near Prijedor housed the infamous [[Omarska camp]], [[Keraterm camp]], and [[Trnopolje camp]] established in 1992 for the Bosniak and Croat population.<ref name=\"prijedor report\">{{cite web|title=The Prijedor report|url=http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/comexpert/ANX/V.htm#I-VI-VI|work=Final report of the United Nations Commission of Experts established pursuant to security council resolution 780 (1992)|author=United Nations \u2013 Security Council|date=28 December 1994|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206012327/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/comexpert/ANX/V.htm#I-VI-VI|archivedate=6 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Simons|first=Marlise|title=5 Bosnian Serbs Guilty of War Crimes at Infamous Camp|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/03/world/5-bosnian-serbs-guilty-of-war-crimes-at-infamous-camp.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 November 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Simons|first=Marlise|title=3 Ex-Guards at Bosnia Camp Are Sentenced by Hague Panel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/world/3-ex-guards-at-bosnia-camp-are-sentenced-by-hague-panel.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 November 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

''Danger 5'' was the chosen concept, the most ambitious and dense of the three.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==Setting and Style==\n\nThe first series is nominally set in World War II but uses a style more akin to pulp TV spy series. The titular Danger 5 are a small group of Allied agents who are tasked with stopping various schemes overseen by [[Adolf Hitler]]. Each episode sees an intentionally ahistorical version of a major Axis person come up with a bizarre plan more in line with a TV or comic book villain of the fifties or sixties - stealing monuments from Allied nations to build an absurd Nazi super-monument, resurrecting dinosaurs, running a fixed casino to make weapons from gold and reprogramming captured airmen as Japanese pilots.\n\nThe series adds a further layer of satire by intentionally aping the production and dated values. Obvious studio sets are used for outdoor shots, model work is intentionally poor, usually featuring unrealistic movements and visible strings, the characters often laugh at bad puns immediately following the deaths of allies. All drink and smoke conspicuously while non-white characters are often played by Caucasians with poor make-up. Stock footage is also used, most notably a shot of Hitler jumping through a glass window to escape that is reused in settings that feature no such window.\n\nFurther surreal humour comes from the characters treating their universe seriously and not questioning various situations that are inexplicable to the viewer.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n<!-- NOTE; READ THIS NOTE: Per Wikipedia:WikiProject Television/Style guidelines#Cast information, \"The cast should be organized according to the series original broadcast credits, with new cast members being added to the end of the list. Please keep in mind that 'main' cast status is determined by the series producers, not by popularity or screen time. Furthermore, articles should reflect the entire history of a series, and as such actors remain on the list even after their departure from the series.\" NOTE; READ THE ABOVE NOTE. -->\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Main characters of ''Danger 5''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"14%\" scope=\"col\" | Actor\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"14%\" scope=\"col\" | Character\n! colspan=\"2\" | Series \n|-\n! width=\"7%\" scope=\"col\"| 1\n! width=\"7%\" scope=\"col\"| 2\n|-\n| David Ashby\n| Jackson\n| colspan=\"2\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| Nata\u0161a Ristic\n| Ilsa\n| colspan=\"2\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| Sean James Murphy\n| Tucker\n| colspan=\"2\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| Amanda Simons\n| Claire\n| colspan=\"2\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|-\n| Tilman Vogler\n| Colonel Chestbridge\n| colspan=\"1\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n| style=\"background: #ddddff\" colspan=\"1\" align=\"center\"| '''3 episodes'''\n|-\n| Aldo Mignone\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Pierre\n| colspan=\"1\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n| style=\"background: #ddddff\" colspan=\"1\" align=\"center\"| '''1 episode'''\n|-\n| [[Pacharo Mzembe]]\n| colspan=\"1\" style=\"background: #ececec;

All are highly trained, happy to kill without feeling any remorse, drink alcohol casually before, during and after what are pitched as serious military operations and chain-smoke.\n\n====Jackson====\nJackson (David Ashby) is a macho and fiercely patriotic American, once abandoning the team in a futile attempt to prevent Hitler stealing the Statue of Liberty. He clashes frequently with Tucker on missions due to having a hedonistic and selfish approach to work. Jackson harbours an unrequited crush on Ilsa and reads ''Real Man Magazine''.\n\n====Ilsa====\nIlsa (Nata\u0161a Ristic) is a Russian, and speaks all of her dialogue in Russian with subtitles, which everyone understands without comment. She wears her uniform with as much flesh showing as possible and sees little problem with using sex to help the team in their missions (once redirecting Joseph Goebbels by performing oral sex on him) or even if she just feels like it. This may be down to the stated lack of emotions Russians in the series have. She feels Claire is a prude and is aware of Jackson's feelings for her but seems indifferent. Ilsa is also a former wife of [[Erwin Rommel]].\n\n====Tucker====\nTucker is an uptight Australian member of the team. He is straight-laced to the point that hearing [[bossa nova]] causes him to suffer nosebleeds while he is often irked by the rest of the team being so easily distracted, though he is frequently undermined when they prove successful. He is a fan of ''Sensible Chuckle'' magazine and is in love with Claire, who saves him from becoming an indestructible Japanese robot-man. He later woos her with a self-written piece for the recorder and they finally kiss when the team seemingly kill Hitler in a [[Tokusatsu|tokusatsu mech]] battle, ending World War II. Despite being portrayed in-universe as a square he still partakes in the same level of drinking and smoking as everyone else.\n\nAt the start of the second series they are preparing to get married when Claire is murdered by a returning Hitler. A grief-stricken Tucker attempts to turn himself into a brooding revenge-driven ninja in response but turns out to be inept. Throughout the series, he suffers flashbacks of Claire's beheading and carries her head around with him.\n\n====Claire====\nClaire is a [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] graduate and a  prim, chaste English woman. She is frequently uncomfortable around Ilsa and Jackson's openly sexual behaviour and initially frosty towards Tucker's more reserved approaches, though in the latter case she eventually relents. Claire is easily the most intelligent and capable member of the team in an intentional comment on the sexism of the shows ''Danger 5'' is spoofing. She is largely ignored; Colonel Chestbridge especially takes great pleasure in belittling the usually salient points she raises during briefings. \n\nShe is set to marry Tucker at the start of the second series but is killed on the day of her wedding.\n\n====Pierre====\nPierre is of hazy European origin and obsessed with making the team cocktails. There are a series of recurring jokes around the character - wherever the team are sent he seemingly unexpectedly runs into an old acquaintance who knows him by a different name and hints at a mysterious past for Pierre; said acquaintance then dies in his arms partway through the episode, imparting a \"perfect\" cocktail recipe with their dying words.\n\nPierre is the easiest-going member of the team and something of a neutral between the headstrong Jackson & Ilsa and the conservative Tucker & Claire. He is also the only member of the team to ever show any sort of emotional reaction to the repeated deaths of most of those unfortunate enough to get involved in a Danger 5 mission. The rest of the team are always oblivious to these moments.\n\nIn series 2, Pierre is played by [[Pacharo Mzembe]]. The change is never mentioned in the series. Between Series 1 and 2, Pierre has become an internationally famous musician. He is widely recognized by the general public and beats Johnny Hitler for the title of Christmas King due to his fame. In the episode \"Un Sacco Di Natale\", Pierre tells the Nazis disguised as priests that he is Catholic.\n\n====Kilroy====\nA sixth member of the team inexplicably introduced partway through the series 1 finale, Kilroy is a cel-animated anthropomorphic dog. His cartoon nature is never mentioned by anyone, nor is his sudden appearance. He largely speaks in hackneyed surfer vernacular until he is fatally shot in the head by Hitler midway through the episode. After imparting a dying cocktail recipe to Pierre he is never seen, mentioned or referenced ever again.\n\n====Colonel Chestbridge====\nThe team's superior who gives them their missions, which always finish with a reminder to \"kill Hitler\". He has a bird's head which, in keeping with the show's style of humour, is unexplained or mentioned by any other characters. The Colonel displays open irritation and contempt for Claire and grows more irascible as the first series goes on due to the team's failures to kill Hitler and end the war, escalating to using a shotgun to keep order during a briefing.\n\nHe is seemingly retired at the start of the second series but is targeted and killed by Hitler.\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n===Series 1 (2012)===\nThis list is ordered by the original air dates on SBS One in Australia.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|- style=\"color:white\"\n! style=\"background:#000;width:%5;\"|no in <br /> series\n! style=\"background:#000;width:%5;\"|no in <br /> season\n! style=\"background:#000;\"|Title\n! style=\"background:#000;width:%25;\"|Original airdate\n|-\n|-\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 0\n|EpisodeNumber2 = 0\n|RTitle = \"The Diamond Girls\" (prequel episode aired on [[YouTube]])\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2011|11|20}}\n|ShortSummary = Deep in Nazi Germany, Jackson, Pierre and Tucker have been working undercover in Adolf Hitler's favourite bar, the Black Dog, waiting for the perfect chance to knock off the big man, and end the Second World War.

''Danger 5'' was the chosen concept, the most ambitious and dense of the three.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==Setting and Style==\n\nThe first series is nominally set in World War II but uses a style more akin to pulp TV spy series. The titular Danger 5 are a small group of Allied agents who are tasked with stopping various schemes overseen by [[Adolf Hitler]]. Each episode sees an intentionally ahistorical version of a major Axis person come up with a bizarre plan more in line with a TV or comic book villain of the fifties or sixties - stealing monuments from Allied nations to build an absurd Nazi super-monument, resurrecting dinosaurs, running a fixed casino to make weapons from gold and reprogramming captured airmen as Japanese pilots.\n\nThe series adds a further layer of satire by intentionally aping the production and dated values. Obvious studio sets are used for outdoor shots, model work is intentionally poor, usually featuring unrealistic movements and visible strings, the characters often laugh at bad puns immediately following the deaths of allies. All drink and smoke conspicuously while non-white characters are often played by Caucasians with poor make-up. Stock footage is also used, most notably a shot of Hitler jumping through a glass window to escape that is reused in settings that feature no such window.\n\nFurther surreal humour comes from the characters treating their universe seriously and not questioning various situations that are inexplicable to the viewer.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n<!-- NOTE; READ THIS NOTE: Per Wikipedia:WikiProject Television/Style guidelines#Cast information, \"The cast should be organized according to the series original broadcast credits, with new cast members being added to the end of the list. Please keep in mind that 'main' cast status is determined by the series producers, not by popularity or screen time.

All are highly trained, happy to kill without feeling any remorse, drink alcohol casually before, during and after what are pitched as serious military operations and chain-smoke.\n\n====Jackson====\nJackson (David Ashby) is a macho and fiercely patriotic American, once abandoning the team in a futile attempt to prevent Hitler stealing the Statue of Liberty. He clashes frequently with Tucker on missions due to having a hedonistic and selfish approach to work. Jackson harbours an unrequited crush on Ilsa and reads ''Real Man Magazine''.\n\n====Ilsa====\nIlsa ([[Natasa Ristic]]) is a Russian, and speaks all of her dialogue in Russian with subtitles, which everyone understands without comment. She wears her uniform with as much flesh showing as possible and sees little problem with using sex to help the team in their missions (once redirecting Joseph Goebbels by performing oral sex on him) or even if she just feels like it. This may be down to the stated lack of emotions Russians in the series have. She feels Claire is a prude and is aware of Jackson's feelings for her but seems indifferent. Ilsa is also a former wife of [[Erwin Rommel]].\n\n====Tucker====\nTucker is an uptight Australian member of the team. He is straight-laced to the point that hearing [[bossa nova]] causes him to suffer nosebleeds while he is often irked by the rest of the team being so easily distracted, though he is frequently undermined when they prove successful. He is a fan of ''Sensible Chuckle'' magazine and is in love with Claire, who saves him from becoming an indestructible Japanese robot-man. He later woos her with a self-written piece for the recorder and they finally kiss when the team seemingly kill Hitler in a [[Tokusatsu|tokusatsu mech]] battle, ending World War II. Despite being portrayed in-universe as a square he still partakes in the same level of drinking and smoking as everyone else.\n\nAt the start of the second series they are preparing to get married when Claire is murdered by a returning Hitler. A grief-stricken Tucker attempts to turn himself into a brooding revenge-driven ninja in response but turns out to be inept. Throughout the series, he suffers flashbacks of Claire's beheading and carries her head around with him.\n\n====Claire====\nClaire is a [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] graduate and a  prim, chaste English woman. She is frequently uncomfortable around Ilsa and Jackson's openly sexual behaviour and initially frosty towards Tucker's more reserved approaches, though in the latter case she eventually relents. Claire is easily the most intelligent and capable member of the team in an intentional comment on the sexism of the shows ''Danger 5'' is spoofing. She is largely ignored; Colonel Chestbridge especially takes great pleasure in belittling the usually salient points she raises during briefings. \n\nShe is set to marry Tucker at the start of the second series but is killed on the day of her wedding.\n\n====Pierre====\nPierre is of hazy European origin and obsessed with making the team cocktails. There are a series of recurring jokes around the character - wherever the team are sent he seemingly unexpectedly runs into an old acquaintance who knows him by a different name and hints at a mysterious past for Pierre; said acquaintance then dies in his arms partway through the episode, imparting a \"perfect\" cocktail recipe with their dying words.\n\nPierre is the easiest-going member of the team and something of a neutral between the headstrong Jackson & Ilsa and the conservative Tucker & Claire. He is also the only member of the team to ever show any sort of emotional reaction to the repeated deaths of most of those unfortunate enough to get involved in a Danger 5 mission. The rest of the team are always oblivious to these moments.\n\nIn series 2, Pierre is played by [[Pacharo Mzembe]]. The change is never mentioned in the series. Between Series 1 and 2, Pierre has become an internationally famous musician. He is widely recognized by the general public and beats Johnny Hitler for the title of Christmas King due to his fame. In the episode \"Un Sacco Di Natale\", Pierre tells the Nazis disguised as priests that he is Catholic.\n\n====Kilroy====\nA sixth member of the team inexplicably introduced partway through the series 1 finale, Kilroy is a cel-animated anthropomorphic dog. His cartoon nature is never mentioned by anyone, nor is his sudden appearance. He largely speaks in hackneyed surfer vernacular until he is fatally shot in the head by Hitler midway through the episode. After imparting a dying cocktail recipe to Pierre he is never seen, mentioned or referenced ever again.\n\n====Colonel Chestbridge====\nThe team's superior who gives them their missions, which always finish with a reminder to \"kill Hitler\". He has a bird's head which, in keeping with the show's style of humour, is unexplained or mentioned by any other characters. The Colonel displays open irritation and contempt for Claire and grows more irascible as the first series goes on due to the team's failures to kill Hitler and end the war, escalating to using a shotgun to keep order during a briefing.\n\nHe is seemingly retired at the start of the second series but is targeted and killed by Hitler.\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n===Series 1 (2012)===\nThis list is ordered by the original air dates on SBS One in Australia.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|- style=\"color:white\"\n! style=\"background:#000;width:%5;\"|no in <br /> series\n! style=\"background:#000;width:%5;\"|no in <br /> season\n! style=\"background:#000;\"|Title\n! style=\"background:#000;width:%25;\"|Original airdate\n|-\n|-\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 0\n|EpisodeNumber2 = 0\n|RTitle = \"The Diamond Girls\" (prequel episode aired on [[YouTube]])\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2011|11|20}}\n|ShortSummary = Deep in Nazi Germany, Jackson, Pierre and Tucker have been working undercover in Adolf Hitler's favourite bar, the Black Dog, waiting for the perfect chance to knock off the big man, and end the Second World War.

He had a [[speech impediment]] and wore thick glasses from the age of five because he was severely [[Near-sightedness|nearsighted]]. He was also diagnosed with high blood pressure for which he took several medications. Berdella was largely unathletic, whereas his younger brother, Daniel{{spnd}}seven years his junior{{spnd}}displayed an aptitude for various sports from an early age. As Berdella's father valued sports and physical education, he viewed his older son's lack of interest in sports as a sign of failure, and often compared him unfavorably with his younger brother. Occasionally, Berdella's father physically and emotionally abused his children, and beat them with a leather strap.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|183}}\n\nBerdella performed well academically, though teachers often found him difficult to teach, in part due both his aloofness, and his being the recipient of bullying by other students. Because of this, as a child, he also seldom socialized in social activities at school with his peers.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|46\u201347}}\n\nWhen Berdella reached puberty, he discovered that he was [[homosexuality|homosexual]]; initially, he kept this fact a closely guarded secret, and he did not become open about his sexuality for several years. Nonetheless, in his early teens, he briefly had a girlfriend.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|47}}\n\n===Adolescence===\nBy his mid-teens, Berdella had begun to display a degree of self-confidence, which would often manifest itself via his attitude to other individuals in which he would exert a somewhat rude and condescending attitude{{spnd}}particularly toward women.<ref name=Burial/> He learned about cooking and art and developed showmanship. On Christmas Day 1965, the Berdella family drove to [[Canton, Ohio]] to visit relatives. That evening, Berdella's father had a [[heart attack]] at the age of 39. Two days later, Berdella returned to Cuyahoga Falls by himself. When he arrived home his family told him his father had died.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|353}} Berdella sought solace in his religion{{spnd}}and later read extensively about many faiths{{spnd}}but became cynical about all religion.\n\nIn 1965, Berdella saw the [[The Collector (1965 film)|film adaptation]] of the [[John Fowles]] book ''[[The Collector]]''. The plot of this movie revolves around a man who stalks and abducts a young woman he finds attractive, and holds her captive in his windowless, stone basement, viewing her as little more than an attractive specimen. After several weeks, the woman dies of a contracted illness despite her captor's efforts to keep her alive. Berdella later stated this movie had formed a lasting impression on him.<ref name=\"Aamodt2006\">{{cite web |url=http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/Psyc%20405/serial%20killers/Berdella,%20Robert.htm |title=Robert Berdella: The Butcher of Kansas City, Missouri |date=2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103180215/http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/Psyc%20405/serial%20killers/Berdella,%20Robert.htm |archive-date=November 3, 2015 |url-status=live |first1=Ryan |last1=Fisher |first2=Ashley |last2=Aust |first3=Danielle |last3=Bisset |first4=Timothy |last4=Jamba |first5=John |last5=Jones |first6=Audrey |last6=King |first7=Jennifer |last7=Kowalski |first8=Elizabeth |last8=Krell |first9=Jaclyn |last9=Layton |editor-first=Mike |editor-last=Aamodt |editor-link=Mike Aamodt |publisher=Radford University |location=Radford, Virginia}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the death of Berdella's father, his mother remarried. This act was met with resentment by her older son, who viewed the move as a form of betrayal against his father. As a result, Berdella became increasingly withdrawn, and further immersed himself in the solitary activities he had participated in since childhood such as painting, collecting coins and stamps, and writing to foreign pen pals. Berdella would later claim that his hobby of writing to pen pals in countries such as [[Vietnam]] and [[Myanmar|Burma]] and the fact these pen pals would send him stamps for his collection, and photographs of mythical and historical icons, ancient cultures, and architecture would lead to his developing an avid interest in primitive art, photographs, and antiques. From approximately 1965, he would begin avidly collecting these artifacts; this practice would later inspire him to open his own business in 1982.<ref name=\"nydailynews.com\"/>\n\n==Relocation to Kansas City==\n===College years===\nIn the summer of 1967, Berdella graduated from [[Cuyahoga Falls High School]]. Throughout his studies in high school, he had earned such excellent grades and displayed such potential that in 1966, one teacher had placed him in an independent study program.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|100}} Shortly after graduation, Berdella relocated to Kansas City. Here, he enrolled in the [[Kansas City Art Institute]], with aspirations of becoming a college professor.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|46}} In his first year at the Kansas City Art Institute, Berdella was considered an attentive and talented student, although by his second year in art school, Berdella became vocally anti-authoritarian. He also became acquainted with a clique of students who supplied him with drugs which he then sold to other students at a profit. As such, he acquired a reputation among his fellow students as a minor drug dealer. In addition, he began regularly abusing alcohol. He also engaged in acts of animal torture on at least three occasions while a student at the Kansas City Art Institute; during two of these instances, he tortured a duck and a chicken in the presence of his peers, and in the third instance, he experimented with sedatives and tranquilizers on a dog.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|104}}\n\nAt the age of 19, Berdella was arrested for attempting to sell [[methamphetamine]]s to an undercover officer;<ref name=Kidnappings>{{cite book |last=Newton |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Newton (author) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EZjlE4-1GSIC&pg=PA25 |title=The Encyclopedia of Kidnappings |series=Facts {{not a typo|O}}n File Crime Library |date=2002 |publisher=Facts {{not a typo|O}}n File |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8160-4486-3 |lccn=2001040170 |oclc=593209888 |ol=9741936M |page=25}}</ref> he was released after posting a $3,000 bond ({{inflation|US|3000|1968|r=-3|fmt=eq}}),{{inflation/fn|US}} and would later plead guilty to the offense and was handed a five-year [[suspended sentence#United States|suspended sentence]]. One month after this first arrest, Berdella and two other students were arrested for possession of marijuana and [[LSD|{{abbr|LSD|lysergic acid diethylamide}}]] in [[Johnson County, Kansas|Johnson County]].

These individuals he would typically befriend, then try to help free them from their drug addictions and general lethargic or criminal lifestyles, and he was adamant that, throughout much of the 1970s, he had no physical contact whatsoever with any of these individuals.<ref name=\"Aamodt2006\"/> \n\nTo several of his neighbors, Berdella stated he gradually almost felt like a foster parent to many of these youths.<ref name=Worthington>{{cite news |first=Rogers |last=Worthington|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1988-07-31-8801190217-story.html |title=House of Horrors Shocks Residents of a Quiet Neighborhood |access-date=September 15, 2018 |date=July 31, 1988 |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]]|location=Chicago, Illinois |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915204716/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1988-07-31-8801190217-story.html |archive-date=September 15, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>{{refn|group=n| Berdella held a brief relationship with a bisexual [[Vietnam veteran]] in 1982; this individual had a severe [[Emotional and behavioral disorders|emotional disorder]], and the relationship was one of the few serious ones Berdella engaged in when living in Kansas City<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|184}}}} By the early 1980s, many of his older acquaintances had ceased any form of social contact with him, with Berdella increasingly relying on these young men as a source of companionship and friendship. He would retrospectively claim to have become increasingly frustrated at many of these individuals' ignorance to his efforts to assist them to steer their lifestyles away from harm and deterioration.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|151}} \n\nDespite these later claims to investigators, Berdella would often engage in sexual relations with several of these individuals, and would establish a degree of control over them{{spnd}}in part to engage in these sexual relations{{spnd}}via methods including loaning them money, and allowing them to live rent free at his house for periods of time.\n\nTo his neighbors, Berdella was considered a flamboyant, yet helpful and civic-minded individual, despite the generally unkempt state of his property, and his somewhat haughty attitude. Beginning in the late 1970s, Berdella would assist in the organizational activities of the South Hyde Park Crime Prevention and Neighborhood Association, becoming their chairman in the early 1980s and encouraging neighborhood\u2011watch patrols.<ref name=Worthington/> He remained active in this association until the mid-1980s, when he relinquished his position within the organization. Berdella would also represent his neighborhood at fundraising events for a local public television station, although he would also disengage himself from these events by the mid-1980s.<ref name=Worthington/>\n\nShortly before Berdella had moved into his Charlotte Street address, he began working as a short-order cook in various restaurants around Kansas City{{spnd}}in part to help pay the lawyer fees and fines accrued from the drug arrests he had endured at age 19. As a means of obtaining additional income, he also sold arcane items of art and antiques he had accrued and collected from contacts he had established in Africa, Asia, South America, and various [[Pacific Rim]] countries.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|231}} He would initially operate this side-business from his home. \n\nBoth his career and side-business gradually flourished, and by the mid-1970s, Berdella began working as a senior cook at several renowned Kansas City restaurants, also joining a local chefs' association, and helping establish a training program for aspiring chefs at a local community college. Simultaneously, as his own business began to burgeon, he began to devote more of his attention to his own business as opposed to his work as a chef. By 1981, he had established several contractual agreements with both national and international contacts for his own business. He viewed this business as his full-time job and later ceased working as a chef.\n\n==Bob's Bazaar Bizarre==\nIn 1982, Berdella began renting his own booth at the [[Westport, Kansas City, Missouri|Westport]] Flea Market. This store was named Bob's Bazaar Bizarre,<ref>{{cite book |first=James |last=Sias|title=The Meaning of Evil |date=2016 |pages=46,&nbsp;50 |chapter=Serial Murder, Psychopathy, and Objectification |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVL_DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA46 |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |location=New York City|doi=10.1057/978-1-137-56822-9_2 |isbn=978-1-137-56822-9 |lccn=2016942089 |oclc=961995760}}</ref><ref name=Aamodt2006/> and primarily sold and traded primitive art, jewelry, and antiques. Although occasionally making a generous monthly profit, the income he typically generated via this business was often not sufficient to maintain his daily expenses and to make ends meet. Resultingly, Berdella would occasionally have to either sell goods to fellow merchants at a profit loss, or steal or scavenge for items to sell at his booth. Additionally, he would often take lodgers at his home as a means of gaining additional income.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|57}}\n\nAt his work premises, Berdella became acquainted with a fellow merchant named Paul Howell, who operated a booth adjacent to his own. Soon, Berdella became acquainted with Paul Howell's younger son, Jerry. Initially, Jerry Howell and his friends scathed and taunted Berdella over his overt homosexuality, although according to Berdella, Jerry Howell later confided in him<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|78\u201379}} that he and his friends occasionally earned money as male prostitutes.<ref name=\"nydailynews.com\"/>\n\nBy the early 1980s, Paul Howell had relocated his business from the Westport flea market to a store within a building located close to the intersection of 39th and Main Street. His family had also moved into an apartment above the shop, and despite his younger son occasionally engaging in heated arguments with Berdella, they would invariably reignite a casual friendship{{spnd}}often via Berdella offering his legal or financial assistance should Jerry endure minor scrapes with the law. By the summer of 1984, Jerry Howell had turned 19.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|81\u201382}}\n\n==Murders==\n===First known victim===\nBerdella is believed to have killed his first victim on July 5, 1984. His first known victim was 19-year-old Jerry Howell,<ref name=\"nydailynews.com\"/> with whom he had become closely reacquainted in the year prior to his murder and whom he abducted on the promise of driving the youth to attend a dancing contest in [[Merriam, Kansas|Merriam]].<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|80}} According to Berdella, he plied Howell with alcohol, [[Valium]] and [[acepromazine]] both in his car and at his house until the youth became unconscious. He then injected Howell with a heavy tranquilizer before binding the youth to his bed.\n\nHowell was restrained to Berdella's bed for a period of approximately 28 hours. Throughout this period of captivity, Berdella repeatedly drugged, tortured, raped and violated him with foreign objects,<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|258}} repeatedly ignoring Howell's intermittent questioning as to why he was being treated in this manner, and pleas to be freed before, according to Berdella, Jerry \"either [[asphyxiation|asphyxiated]] on [his own] vomit, or the combination of the gag and the medicines were too strong for him to be able to catch breath\".<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|258}} \n\nBerdella would later state that he briefly attempted to perform [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] upon Howell after he had died before dragging his body to the basement. He then suspended Howell's body above a large cooking pot and made several incisions to the youth's inner elbows and [[jugular vein]], before leaving the body suspended in this position overnight to allow the blood to drain from his corpse.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|259\u2013261}} The following day, he dismembered Howell's body using a chainsaw and boning knives, before wrapping the sections in newspaper and trash bags. These bags were later placed inside larger trash bags which Berdella placed outside for a garbage crew to collect and take to a landfill.<ref name=\"Bob Berdella: KC True Crime\">{{cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/special-reports/kc-true-crime/article704522.html|title=Bob Berdella: KC True Crime|access-date=June 14, 2017|newspaper=[[The Kansas City Star]]|publisher=[[McClatchy Company]]|location=Kansas City, Missouri|date=July 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nLater questioned by officers investigating Howell's disappearance, Berdella claimed to have driven the youth to Merriam as promised, and that the two had parted company close to Howell's intended destination. Berdella further claimed he had not seen him since.<ref name=Kidnappings/>\n\nAs would be the case with all Berdella's murders, he kept a detailed log in which he documented each act of sexual and physical torture inflicted upon his victim. Berdella would recall that{{spnd}}like the subsequent victims he would hold captive{{spnd}}Howell had repeatedly pleaded for his ongoing abuse and torture to cease throughout the period of his capture, although Berdella would either ignore these pleas, taunt his victim, or threaten him.<ref>''Extreme Killing: Understanding Serial and Mass Murder'' {{ISBN|978-1-483-35072-1}} p. 103</ref> He would remain adamant to investigators that this would be not for his enjoyment, but what he termed his \"physical and mental satisfaction\".<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|270}}\n\n===Subsequent murders===\nOn April 10, 1985, a former lodger of Berdella's, 23-year-old Robert Sheldon, arrived on his doorstep, asking if he could again stay at his house for a short period of time.<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers'' {{ISBN|978-0-747-23731-0}} p. 47</ref> According to Berdella, although Sheldon was responsible in paying rent, he considered him \"an inconvenience\" and, although he was not physically attracted to this victim, chose to drug and hold him captive on April 12 when he returned home from work to find Sheldon intoxicated in his home. Berdella was adamant he held no firm malice toward Sheldon, but saw him as an individual upon whom he could \"express some of the anger and frustration that I had toward other people on\".<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|266}} \n\nSheldon was drugged with sedatives and held captive in the second floor bedroom for three days, enduring forms of torture such as the swabbing of [[drain cleaner]] in his left eye,<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|266}} the insertion of needles beneath his fingertips,<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|268}} the binding of his wrists with piano wire with the intention of permanently damaging the nerves in his hands,<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|271}} and filling his ears with caulking to reduce his hearing capacity.\n\nThree days after Berdella had begun holding Sheldon captive, on April{{nbsp}}15, a workman came to perform some scheduled work on the roof of his home, leading Berdella to choose to fatally [[asphyxia|suffocate]] Sheldon by placing a sack over his head, which he then tightened with a piece of rope. He later dissected Sheldon's body in the third floor bathroom.\n\nThe following June, Berdella found Mark Wallace (whom he vaguely knew via Wallace having previously helped him with yard work) hiding in his tool shed to seek shelter from a severe thunderstorm. As had been the case with Robert Sheldon, Berdella invited him inside his house, and, noting Wallace's acute state of tenseness and [[depression (mood)|depression]], volunteered to inject him with [[chlorpromazine]] with the explanation this would \"calm down and relax\" him. Wallace willingly accepted the offer and, 30 minutes later, Berdella decided to render him captive.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|277}} \n\nWallace was carried to the second floor bedroom where he endured almost a day of captivity and torture including the application of alligator clips to his nipples to facilitate electrical shocks to his body at any point at which Wallace began regressing into a state of unconsciousness. According to Berdella, one hour after his \"experimenting\" with hypodermic needles by inserting them into various muscles upon his victim's back, Mark Wallace died through a combination of \"the drugs, the gag, and the lack of oxygen\". He noted this victim's time of death as being 7:00&nbsp;p.m. on June 23.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|281}}\n\n===Increase in brutality===\nOn September 26, 1985, Berdella answered a phone call from an acquaintance named James Ferris,{{refn|group=n|name=Ferris|Only Berdella referred to James Ferris by his given first name, Walter.<ref name=Burial/>}} who asked to stay at Berdella's home for a short time. Berdella accepted with the specific intention of kidnapping Ferris, whom he arranged to meet at a bar that evening.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|285\u2013286}} Despite the brutality to which he had subjected his first three victims, Berdella claimed that Ferris was the first victim upon whom he intentionally inflicted torture.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|258}} He also informed investigators there were occasions during his final three victims' periods of captivity when he ceased making additions to his abuse logs because he assumed the victim would not \"be able to make it much longer\".<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|300}}\n\nBerdella brought Ferris home and drugged him with crushed tranquilizers he had concealed in a meal, then tied him to his bed before torturing him almost constantly for approximately 27{{nbsp}}hours. The torture included repeated administering of 7,700-[[voltage|volt]] electrical shocks to the shoulder and testicles for up to five minutes in each instance, and [[acupuncture]] via hypodermic needles to the neck and genitals. Ferris gradually became delirious,<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|288}} but Berdella continued his [[physical assault|physical]] and [[sexual assault]]s until he noted in his log that Ferris was \"Unable to sit up more than {{nowrap|10\u201315 sec{{bracket|onds}}}}\". The next entry read \"Very delayed breathing\", and finally, Berdella noted that Ferris died with a slang term he had used in his career as a chef, \"[[86 (term)|86]]\", which Berdella later explained \"meant anything from 'Throw it out' to 'Stop the project{{'\"}}.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|289}}<ref name=Aamodt2006/>\n\nTodd Stoops was a drug addict and sometime prostitute who, alongside his wife, had twice lived briefly at Berdella's house in 1984. After Stoops and his wife moved out of Berdella's home the second time, Berdella did not see him again until a chance encounter at Kansas{{nbsp}}City's Liberty Memorial Park on June 17, 1986. Berdella invited him to his house with an offer of lunch,<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|139}} with an added incentive of sex as Stoops stated he needed $13 to purchase drugs (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|13|1986|fmt=c}} in {{inflation-year|US}}).{{inflation/fn|US}}<ref name=Mortal/>{{rp|270}}\n\nBerdella would later stress to investigators he had been extremely physically attracted to Stoops, and this victim was held captive for two weeks before he died, with him gradually increasing his captive's terror to make him a cooperative and incapacitated sex slave. Berdella used electrical shocks through Stoops's closed eyes in an attempt to blind him and injected drain cleaner into his [[larynx]] to try to silence his screaming.\n\nDuring the second week of his capture, Stoops asked Berdella for a soft drink and sandwich. When Berdella refused, Stoops burst into tears.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|300}} On June 27, he ruptured Stoops's anal wall with his fist, causing bleeding and discharge.<ref name=Mortal/>{{rp|270}} Towards the end of Stoops's captivity, he tried to feed his captive ice cream and soup, although Stoops \"wasn't able to keep anything down\". By the final day of his captivity, Stoops was so weak Berdella later stated he had been unable \"to breathe in a sitting position\".<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|302}} On July 1, 1986, Stoops died; a [[forensic pathologist]] later testified that the ruptured anal wall caused [[septic shock]] which proved fatal.<ref name=Mortal/>{{rp|271}}\n\nIn the spring of 1987, Berdella became friendly with a 20-year-old named Larry Wayne Pearson. This casual friendship began when Pearson entered his shop and explained to Berdella that, as a child, he had held an interest in both [[witchcraft]] and [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizardry]]. Shortly thereafter, Pearson temporarily lodged with Berdella, and willingly performed chores around his home as a means of paying rent.<ref name=\"apnewsarchive.com\">{{cite news |url=https://apnews.com/250114aed48dc203d86d2cb780b0cb39 |title=Berdella Sentenced To Life In Prison Without Parole |access-date=September 15, 2018 |agency=Associated Press |date=August 4, 1988 |archive-date=September 3, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903082107/https://apnews.com/250114aed48dc203d86d2cb780b0cb39 |url-status=live |first=John |last=Sheils}}</ref> According to Berdella, he did not initially intend to capture this individual, but formed the plan to do so on June 23 when, having bailed Pearson out of jail, the young man began jokingly referring to his practice of robbing gay men in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]].<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|307}} \n\nThat evening, Berdella ensured Pearson became [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]] before injecting him with chlorpromazine and moving him down to his basement, where he bound Pearson's hands above his head, then linked the rope he had used for this purpose to a brick column, before injecting Pearson's larynx with drain cleaner. He then brought an electrical transformer to the basement.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|309}}\n\nAccording to Berdella, Pearson was by far the most cooperative of his six murder victims. On the fifth day of his captivity, having by this stage endured torture such as the repeated administration of electrical shocks with the transformer, and the breaking of several hand bones with an iron rod to render him submissive,<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|311}} Berdella deduced Pearson had earned his trust as to his continued cooperation in his sexual and physical abuse. As a form of reward, Pearson was moved to the second floor, with Berdella first informing Pearson that if he continued to cooperate, he would not continue to inflict as much pain upon him as he had done so while he had been held captive in the basement. Throughout the latter part of his six weeks of captivity, Pearson trained himself to sleep without moving, in order that he did not antagonize Berdella and thus invite further torture or being returned to the basement.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|312}}\n\nAfter six weeks of captivity, in an act of despair, Pearson deeply bit into Berdella's penis before screaming he could not continue to tolerate being treated in this manner. In response, Berdella killed Pearson by first bludgeoning him into unconsciousness with a tree limb,<ref>''My Life Among the Serial Killers: Inside the Minds of the World's Most Notorious Murderers'' p. 200</ref> then suffocating him with a bag and ligature, before driving to hospital to receive treatment for his wound. Pearson's body was later dismembered in the basement, and his head initially stored in a plastic bag inside Berdella's freezer, before being buried in the backyard.{{refn|group=n|In his subsequent confessions to investigators, Berdella stated he had dismembered the bodies of Robert Sheldon, Mark Wallace, James Ferris, and Todd Stoops in the bathtub in his third floor bathroom, whereas the bodies of Jerry Howell and Larry Pearson had been dismembered in his basement.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|281\u2013282}}}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = \"You did not choose to be here, but you are.

At Berdella's home, Bryson was knocked unconscious with an iron bar, then bound to Berdella's bed, where he was subjected to similar methods of abuse and torture endured by previous victims, although in Bryson's case, Berdella repeatedly swabbed his eyes with [[ammonia]],<ref>''Inside the Minds of Serial Killers: Why They Kill'' {{ISBN|0-27599-099-0}} p. 115</ref> before exclaiming to him: \"The only things you need to think about are you, me, and this house.\"\n\nAfter several days, Berdella explained to Bryson he had begun to \"trust\" his captive, and that although he was willing to discuss aspects of the abuse and torture he was receiving, there would be no negotiations pertaining to his sexual abuse. Berdella finished this discussion with a stern warning: \"I've gotten this far with other people before, and they're dead now, because of mistakes they made.\"<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|15}}\n\n===Escape===\nBy the third day of his capture, Bryson had earned sufficient trust from Berdella to persuade him to establish a daily regime of tying his hands in front of him after his sexual abuse rather than above his head and to the bed upon the excuse that Berdella's doing so was restricting the circulation to his arms; he had also persuaded Berdella to leave a television on within the room, with the remote control placed between his legs whenever Berdella was out of the room. However, he would later state to investigators that he had thought almost constantly about escaping.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|16}} The following day, he managed to break free of his restraints by burning through them using a book of matches Berdella had inadvertently left in the room and within his reach when he had left the house to go to his place of work.<ref>''The Murder Almanac'' {{ISBN|1-897784-04-X}} p. 13</ref>\n\nBryson then managed to escape from the house by jumping from a second floor window, wearing nothing besides a dog collar around his neck, breaking a bone in his foot in the process; he then ran toward a meter reader walking across the other side of the street, shouting for this individual to call the police.

Two officers were told to maintain a discreet [[surveillance]] of the property, as Bryson was driven to the [[Menorah Medical Center]], accompanied by a third officer, for treatment as the fourth officer radioed the [[Kansas City Police Department (Missouri)|Kansas City Police Department]] to request a formal [[search warrant]] of the property be drafted.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|24\u201325}}\n\n==Arrest==\nLater questioned in greater detail at the Kansas City Police Department,{{refn|group=n|This more detailed questioning occurred after Bryson had been released from the Menorah Medical Center, after he had undergone several days of treatment for his injuries.}} Bryson said he had been held against his will by the occupant of 4315 Charlotte Street, who had subjected him to four days of repeated sexual abuse, humiliation, and torture.

This task force extensively researched Berdella's history, discovering that he was a well-known individual among Kansas City's male hustlers, having earned a reputation for preying on transient young men. Several of these male prostitutes were also reluctant to accept him as a client both because of his penchant for drugging, injecting, and torturing his sexual partners and acquaintances, and also because he had long been considered a suspect in the disappearance of the two men whose personal possessions had been found in his house (Jerry Howell and James Ferris).<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>\n\nMissing person reports had been filed in relation to both these men, and Berdella had been extensively questioned in relation to both of these disappearances.

The entry reading \"CP\", for example, referred to the chlorpromazine he had injected into his victims to assist in his restraining them, whereas entries reading \"DC\" referred to swabbing their eyes with drain cleaner or the injection of the substance into their vocal cords.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/kansas-city-sex-slayer-detailed-diary-torture-murder-article-1.2723454|title=Kansas City Sicko Kept Detailed Diary, Photos of Sex Torture, Bondage and Murder|access-date=June 15, 2017|newspaper=Daily News|date=July 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nEntries reading \"EK\" or \"EKG\" referred to torture administered to his captives with electrical shocks, whereas several other entries contained the anatomical location where Berdella administered the abuse or torture to his victims.

He had a [[speech impediment]] and wore thick glasses from the age of five because he was severely [[Near-sightedness|nearsighted]]. He was also diagnosed with high blood pressure for which he took several medications. Berdella was largely unathletic, whereas his younger brother, Daniel{{spnd}}seven years his junior{{spnd}}displayed an aptitude for various sports from an early age. As Berdella's father valued sports and physical education, he viewed his older son's lack of interest in sports as a sign of failure, and often compared him unfavorably with his younger brother. Occasionally, Berdella's father physically and emotionally abused his children, and beat them with a leather strap.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|183}}\n\nBerdella performed well academically, though teachers often found him difficult to teach, in part due both his aloofness, and his being the recipient of bullying by other students. Because of this, as a child, he also seldom socialized in social activities at school with his peers.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|46\u201347}}\n\nWhen Berdella reached puberty, he discovered that he was [[homosexuality|homosexual]]; initially, he kept this fact a closely guarded secret, and he did not become open about his sexuality for several years. Nonetheless, in his early teens, he briefly had a girlfriend.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|47}}\n\n===Adolescence===\nBy his mid-teens, Berdella had begun to display a degree of self-confidence, which would often manifest itself via his attitude to other individuals in which he would exert a somewhat rude and condescending attitude{{spnd}}particularly toward women.<ref name=Burial/> He learned about cooking and art and developed showmanship. On Christmas Day 1965, the Berdella family drove to [[Canton, Ohio]] to visit relatives. That evening, Berdella's father had a [[heart attack]] at the age of 39. Two days later, Berdella returned to Cuyahoga Falls by himself. When he arrived home his family told him his father had died.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|353}} Berdella sought solace in his religion{{spnd}}and later read extensively about many faiths{{spnd}}but became cynical about all religion.\n\nIn 1965, Berdella saw the [[The Collector (1965 film)|film adaptation]] of the [[John Fowles]] book ''[[The Collector]]''. The plot of this movie revolves around a man who stalks and abducts a young woman he finds attractive, and holds her captive in his windowless, stone basement, viewing her as little more than an attractive specimen. After several weeks, the woman dies of a contracted illness despite her captor's efforts to keep her alive. Berdella later stated this movie had formed a lasting impression on him.<ref name=\"Aamodt2006\">{{cite web |url=http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/Psyc%20405/serial%20killers/Berdella,%20Robert.htm |title=Robert Berdella: The Butcher of Kansas City, Missouri |date=2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103180215/http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/Psyc%20405/serial%20killers/Berdella,%20Robert.htm |archive-date=November 3, 2015 |url-status=live |first1=Ryan |last1=Fisher |first2=Ashley |last2=Aust |first3=Danielle |last3=Bisset |first4=Timothy |last4=Jamba |first5=John |last5=Jones |first6=Audrey |last6=King |first7=Jennifer |last7=Kowalski |first8=Elizabeth |last8=Krell |first9=Jaclyn |last9=Layton |editor-first=Mike |editor-last=Aamodt |editor-link=Mike Aamodt |publisher=Radford University |location=Radford, Virginia}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the death of Berdella's father, his mother remarried. This act was met with resentment by her older son, who viewed the move as a form of betrayal against his father. As a result, Berdella became increasingly withdrawn, and further immersed himself in the solitary activities he had participated in since childhood such as painting, collecting coins and stamps, and writing to foreign pen pals. Berdella would later claim that his hobby of writing to pen pals in countries such as [[Vietnam]] and [[Myanmar|Burma]] and the fact these pen pals would send him stamps for his collection, and photographs of mythical and historical icons, ancient cultures, and architecture would lead to his developing an avid interest in primitive art, photographs, and antiques. From approximately 1965, he would begin avidly collecting these artifacts; this practice would later inspire him to open his own business in 1982.<ref name=\"nydailynews.com\"/>\n\n==Relocation to Kansas City==\n===College years===\nIn the summer of 1967, Berdella graduated from [[Cuyahoga Falls High School]]. Throughout his studies in high school, he had earned such excellent grades and displayed such potential that in 1966, one teacher had placed him in an independent study program.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|100}} Shortly after graduation, Berdella relocated to Kansas City. Here, he enrolled in the [[Kansas City Art Institute]], with aspirations of becoming a college professor.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|46}} In his first year at the Kansas City Art Institute, Berdella was considered an attentive and talented student, although by his second year in art school, Berdella became vocally anti-authoritarian. He also became acquainted with a clique of students who supplied him with drugs which he then sold to other students at a profit. As such, he acquired a reputation among his fellow students as a minor drug dealer. In addition, he began regularly abusing alcohol. He also engaged in acts of animal torture on at least three occasions while a student at the Kansas City Art Institute; during two of these instances, he tortured a duck and a chicken in the presence of his peers, and in the third instance, he experimented with sedatives and tranquilizers on a dog.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|104}}\n\nAt the age of 19, Berdella was arrested for attempting to sell [[methamphetamine]]s to an undercover officer;<ref name=Kidnappings>{{cite book |last=Newton |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Newton (author) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EZjlE4-1GSIC&pg=PA25 |title=The Encyclopedia of Kidnappings |series=Facts {{not a typo|O}}n File Crime Library |date=2002 |publisher=Facts {{not a typo|O}}n File |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8160-4486-3 |lccn=2001040170 |oclc=593209888 |ol=9741936M |page=25}}</ref> he was released after posting a $3,000 bond ({{inflation|US|3000|1968|r=-3|fmt=eq}}),{{inflation/fn|US}} and would later plead guilty to the offense and was handed a five-year [[suspended sentence#United States|suspended sentence]]. One month after this first arrest, Berdella and two other students were arrested for possession of marijuana and [[LSD|{{abbr|LSD|lysergic acid diethylamide}}]] in [[Johnson County, Kansas|Johnson County]].

He would retrospectively claim to have become increasingly frustrated at many of these individuals' ignorance to his efforts to assist them to steer their lifestyles away from harm and deterioration.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|151}} \n\nDespite these later claims to investigators, Berdella would often engage in sexual relations with several of these individuals, and would establish a degree of control over them{{spnd}}in part to engage in these sexual relations{{spnd}}via methods including loaning them money, and allowing them to live rent free at his house for periods of time.\n\nTo his neighbors, Berdella was considered a flamboyant, yet helpful and civic-minded individual, despite the generally unkempt state of his property, and his somewhat haughty attitude. Beginning in the late 1970s, Berdella would assist in the organizational activities of the South Hyde Park Crime Prevention and Neighborhood Association, becoming their chairman in the early 1980s and encouraging neighborhood\u2011watch patrols.<ref name=Worthington/> He remained active in this association until the mid-1980s, when he relinquished his position within the organization. Berdella would also represent his neighborhood at fundraising events for a local public television station, although he would also disengage himself from these events by the mid-1980s.<ref name=Worthington/>\n\nShortly before Berdella had moved into his Charlotte Street address, he began working as a short-order cook in various restaurants around Kansas City{{spnd}}in part to help pay the lawyer fees and fines accrued from the drug arrests he had endured at age 19. As a means of obtaining additional income, he also sold arcane items of art and antiques he had accrued and collected from contacts he had established in Africa, Asia, South America, and various [[Pacific Rim]] countries.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|231}} He would initially operate this side-business from his home. \n\nBoth his career and side-business gradually flourished, and by the mid-1970s, Berdella began working as a senior cook at several renowned Kansas City restaurants, also joining a local chefs' association, and helping establish a training program for aspiring chefs at a local community college. Simultaneously, as his own business began to burgeon, he began to devote more of his attention to his own business as opposed to his work as a chef. By 1981, he had established several contractual agreements with both national and international contacts for his own business. He viewed this business as his full-time job and later ceased working as a chef.\n\n==Bob's Bazaar Bizarre==\nIn 1982, Berdella began renting his own booth at the [[Westport, Kansas City, Missouri|Westport]] Flea Market. This store was named Bob's Bazaar Bizarre,<ref>{{cite book |first=James |last=Sias|title=The Meaning of Evil |date=2016 |pages=46,&nbsp;50 |chapter=Serial Murder, Psychopathy, and Objectification |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVL_DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA46 |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |location=New York City|doi=10.1057/978-1-137-56822-9_2 |isbn=978-1-137-56822-9 |lccn=2016942089 |oclc=961995760}}</ref><ref name=Aamodt2006/> and primarily sold and traded primitive art, jewelry, and antiques. Although occasionally making a generous monthly profit, the income he typically generated via this business was often not sufficient to maintain his daily expenses and to make ends meet. Resultingly, Berdella would occasionally have to either sell goods to fellow merchants at a profit loss, or steal or scavenge for items to sell at his booth. Additionally, he would often take lodgers at his home as a means of gaining additional income.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|57}}\n\nAt his work premises, Berdella became acquainted with a fellow merchant named Paul Howell, who operated a booth adjacent to his own. Soon, Berdella became acquainted with Paul Howell's younger son, Jerry. Initially, Jerry Howell and his friends scathed and taunted Berdella over his overt homosexuality, although according to Berdella, Jerry Howell later confided in him<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|78\u201379}} that he and his friends occasionally earned money as male prostitutes.<ref name=\"nydailynews.com\"/>\n\nBy the early 1980s, Paul Howell had relocated his business from the Westport flea market to a store within a building located close to the intersection of 39th and Main Street. His family had also moved into an apartment above the shop, and despite his younger son occasionally engaging in heated arguments with Berdella, they would invariably reignite a casual friendship{{spnd}}often via Berdella offering his legal or financial assistance should Jerry endure minor scrapes with the law. By the summer of 1984, Jerry Howell had turned 19.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|81\u201382}}\n\n==Murders==\n===First known victim===\nBerdella is believed to have killed his first victim on July 5, 1984. His first known victim was 19-year-old Jerry Howell,<ref name=\"nydailynews.com\"/> with whom he had become closely reacquainted in the year prior to his murder and whom he abducted on the promise of driving the youth to attend a dancing contest in [[Merriam, Kansas|Merriam]].<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|80}} According to Berdella, he plied Howell with alcohol, [[Valium]] and [[acepromazine]] both in his car and at his house until the youth became unconscious. He then injected Howell with a heavy tranquilizer before binding the youth to his bed.\n\nHowell was restrained to Berdella's bed for a period of approximately 28 hours. Throughout this period of captivity, Berdella repeatedly drugged, tortured, raped and violated him with foreign objects,<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|258}} repeatedly ignoring Howell's intermittent questioning as to why he was being treated in this manner, and pleas to be freed before, according to Berdella, Jerry \"either [[asphyxiation|asphyxiated]] on [his own] vomit, or the combination of the gag and the medicines were too strong for him to be able to catch breath\".<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|258}} \n\nBerdella would later state that he briefly attempted to perform [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] upon Howell after he had died before dragging his body to the basement. He then suspended Howell's body above a large cooking pot and made several incisions to the youth's inner elbows and [[jugular vein]], before leaving the body suspended in this position overnight to allow the blood to drain from his corpse.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|259\u2013261}} The following day, he dismembered Howell's body using a chainsaw and boning knives, before wrapping the sections in newspaper and trash bags. These bags were later placed inside larger trash bags which Berdella placed outside for a garbage crew to collect and take to a landfill.<ref name=\"Bob Berdella: KC True Crime\">{{cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/special-reports/kc-true-crime/article704522.html|title=Bob Berdella: KC True Crime|access-date=June 14, 2017|newspaper=[[The Kansas City Star]]|publisher=[[McClatchy Company]]|location=Kansas City, Missouri|date=July 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nLater questioned by officers investigating Howell's disappearance, Berdella claimed to have driven the youth to Merriam as promised, and that the two had parted company close to Howell's intended destination. Berdella further claimed he had not seen him since.<ref name=Kidnappings/>\n\nAs would be the case with all Berdella's murders, he kept a detailed log in which he documented each act of sexual and physical torture inflicted upon his victim. Berdella would recall that{{spnd}}like the subsequent victims he would hold captive{{spnd}}Howell had repeatedly pleaded for his ongoing abuse and torture to cease throughout the period of his capture, although Berdella would either ignore these pleas, taunt his victim, or threaten him.<ref>''Extreme Killing: Understanding Serial and Mass Murder'' {{ISBN|978-1-483-35072-1}} p. 103</ref> He would remain adamant to investigators that this would be not for his enjoyment, but what he termed his \"physical and mental satisfaction\".<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|270}}\n\n===Subsequent murders===\nOn April 10, 1985, a former lodger of Berdella's, 23-year-old Robert Sheldon, arrived on his doorstep, asking if he could again stay at his house for a short period of time.<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers'' {{ISBN|978-0-747-23731-0}} p. 47</ref> According to Berdella, although Sheldon was responsible in paying rent, he considered him \"an inconvenience\" and, although he was not physically attracted to this victim, chose to drug and hold him captive on April 12 when he returned home from work to find Sheldon intoxicated in his home. Berdella was adamant he held no firm malice toward Sheldon, but saw him as an individual upon whom he could \"express some of the anger and frustration that I had toward other people on\".<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|266}} \n\nSheldon was drugged with sedatives and held captive in the second floor bedroom for three days, enduring forms of torture such as the swabbing of [[drain cleaner]] in his left eye,<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|266}} the insertion of needles beneath his fingertips,<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|268}} the binding of his wrists with piano wire with the intention of permanently damaging the nerves in his hands,<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|271}} and filling his ears with caulking to reduce his hearing capacity.\n\nThree days after Berdella had begun holding Sheldon captive, on April{{nbsp}}15, a workman came to perform some scheduled work on the roof of his home, leading Berdella to choose to fatally [[asphyxia|suffocate]] Sheldon by placing a sack over his head, which he then tightened with a piece of rope. He later dissected Sheldon's body in the third floor bathroom.\n\nThe following June, Berdella found Mark Wallace (whom he vaguely knew via Wallace having previously helped him with yard work) hiding in his tool shed to seek shelter from a severe thunderstorm. As had been the case with Robert Sheldon, Berdella invited him inside his house, and, noting Wallace's acute state of tenseness and [[depression (mood)|depression]], volunteered to inject him with [[chlorpromazine]] with the explanation this would \"calm down and relax\" him. Wallace willingly accepted the offer and, 30 minutes later, Berdella decided to render him captive.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|277}} \n\nWallace was carried to the second floor bedroom where he endured almost a day of captivity and torture including the application of alligator clips to his nipples to facilitate electrical shocks to his body at any point at which Wallace began regressing into a state of unconsciousness. According to Berdella, one hour after his \"experimenting\" with hypodermic needles by inserting them into various muscles upon his victim's back, Mark Wallace died through a combination of \"the drugs, the gag, and the lack of oxygen\". He noted this victim's time of death as being 7:00&nbsp;p.m. on June 23.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|281}}\n\n===Increase in brutality===\nOn September 26, 1985, Berdella answered a phone call from an acquaintance named James Ferris,{{refn|group=n|name=Ferris|Only Berdella referred to James Ferris by his given first name, Walter.<ref name=Burial/>}} who asked to stay at Berdella's home for a short time. Berdella accepted with the specific intention of kidnapping Ferris, whom he arranged to meet at a bar that evening.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|285\u2013286}} Despite the brutality to which he had subjected his first three victims, Berdella claimed that Ferris was the first victim upon whom he intentionally inflicted torture.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|258}} He also informed investigators there were occasions during his final three victims' periods of captivity when he ceased making additions to his abuse logs because he assumed the victim would not \"be able to make it much longer\".<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|300}}\n\nBerdella brought Ferris home and drugged him with crushed tranquilizers he had concealed in a meal, then tied him to his bed before torturing him almost constantly for approximately 27{{nbsp}}hours. The torture included repeated administering of 7,700-[[voltage|volt]] electrical shocks to the shoulder and testicles for up to five minutes in each instance, and [[acupuncture]] via hypodermic needles to the neck and genitals. Ferris gradually became delirious,<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|288}} but Berdella continued his [[physical assault|physical]] and [[sexual assault]]s until he noted in his log that Ferris was \"Unable to sit up more than {{nowrap|10\u201315 sec{{bracket|onds}}}}\". The next entry read \"Very delayed breathing\", and finally, Berdella noted that Ferris died with a slang term he had used in his career as a chef, \"[[86 (term)|86]]\", which Berdella later explained \"meant anything from 'Throw it out' to 'Stop the project{{'\"}}.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|289}}<ref name=Aamodt2006/>\n\nTodd Stoops was a drug addict and sometime prostitute who, alongside his wife, had twice lived briefly at Berdella's house in 1984. After Stoops and his wife moved out of Berdella's home the second time, Berdella did not see him again until a chance encounter at Kansas{{nbsp}}City's Liberty Memorial Park on June 17, 1986. Berdella invited him to his house with an offer of lunch,<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|139}} with an added incentive of sex as Stoops stated he needed $13 to purchase drugs (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|13|1986|fmt=c}} in {{inflation-year|US}}).{{inflation/fn|US}}<ref name=Mortal/>{{rp|270}}\n\nBerdella would later stress to investigators he had been extremely physically attracted to Stoops, and this victim was held captive for two weeks before he died, with him gradually increasing his captive's terror to make him a cooperative and incapacitated sex slave. Berdella used electrical shocks through Stoops's closed eyes in an attempt to blind him and injected drain cleaner into his [[larynx]] to try to silence his screaming.\n\nDuring the second week of his capture, Stoops asked Berdella for a soft drink and sandwich. When Berdella refused, Stoops burst into tears.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|300}} On June 27, he ruptured Stoops's anal wall with his fist, causing bleeding and discharge.<ref name=Mortal/>{{rp|270}} Towards the end of Stoops's captivity, he tried to feed his captive ice cream and soup, although Stoops \"wasn't able to keep anything down\". By the final day of his captivity, Stoops was so weak Berdella later stated he had been unable \"to breathe in a sitting position\".<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|302}} On July 1, 1986, Stoops died; a [[forensic pathologist]] later testified that the ruptured anal wall caused [[septic shock]] which proved fatal.<ref name=Mortal/>{{rp|271}}\n\nIn the spring of 1987, Berdella became friendly with a 20-year-old named Larry Wayne Pearson. This casual friendship began when Pearson entered his shop and explained to Berdella that, as a child, he had held an interest in both [[witchcraft]] and [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizardry]]. Shortly thereafter, Pearson temporarily lodged with Berdella, and willingly performed chores around his home as a means of paying rent.<ref name=\"apnewsarchive.com\">{{cite news |url=https://apnews.com/250114aed48dc203d86d2cb780b0cb39 |title=Berdella Sentenced To Life In Prison Without Parole |access-date=September 15, 2018 |agency=Associated Press |date=August 4, 1988 |archive-date=September 3, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903082107/https://apnews.com/250114aed48dc203d86d2cb780b0cb39 |url-status=live |first=John |last=Sheils}}</ref> According to Berdella, he did not initially intend to capture this individual, but formed the plan to do so on June 23 when, having bailed Pearson out of jail, the young man began jokingly referring to his practice of robbing gay men in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]].<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|307}} \n\nThat evening, Berdella ensured Pearson became [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]] before injecting him with chlorpromazine and moving him down to his basement, where he bound Pearson's hands above his head, then linked the rope he had used for this purpose to a brick column, before injecting Pearson's larynx with drain cleaner. He then brought an electrical transformer to the basement.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|309}}\n\nAccording to Berdella, Pearson was by far the most cooperative of his six murder victims. On the fifth day of his captivity, having by this stage endured torture such as the repeated administration of electrical shocks with the transformer, and the breaking of several hand bones with an iron rod to render him submissive,<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|311}} Berdella deduced Pearson had earned his trust as to his continued cooperation in his sexual and physical abuse. As a form of reward, Pearson was moved to the second floor, with Berdella first informing Pearson that if he continued to cooperate, he would not continue to inflict as much pain upon him as he had done so while he had been held captive in the basement. Throughout the latter part of his six weeks of captivity, Pearson trained himself to sleep without moving, in order that he did not antagonize Berdella and thus invite further torture or being returned to the basement.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|312}}\n\nAfter six weeks of captivity, in an act of despair, Pearson deeply bit into Berdella's penis before screaming he could not continue to tolerate being treated in this manner. In response, Berdella killed Pearson by first bludgeoning him into unconsciousness with a tree limb,<ref>''My Life Among the Serial Killers: Inside the Minds of the World's Most Notorious Murderers'' p. 200</ref> then suffocating him with a bag and ligature, before driving to hospital to receive treatment for his wound. Pearson's body was later dismembered in the basement, and his head initially stored in a plastic bag inside Berdella's freezer, before being buried in the backyard.{{refn|group=n|In his subsequent confessions to investigators, Berdella stated he had dismembered the bodies of Robert Sheldon, Mark Wallace, James Ferris, and Todd Stoops in the bathtub in his third floor bathroom, whereas the bodies of Jerry Howell and Larry Pearson had been dismembered in his basement.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|281\u2013282}}}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = \"You did not choose to be here, but you are.

At Berdella's home, Bryson was knocked unconscious with an iron bar, then bound to Berdella's bed, where he was subjected to similar methods of abuse and torture endured by previous victims, although in Bryson's case, Berdella repeatedly swabbed his eyes with [[ammonia]],<ref>''Inside the Minds of Serial Killers: Why They Kill'' {{ISBN|0-27599-099-0}} p. 115</ref> before exclaiming to him: \"The only things you need to think about are you, me, and this house.\"\n\nAfter several days, Berdella explained to Bryson he had begun to \"trust\" his captive, and that although he was willing to discuss aspects of the abuse and torture he was receiving, there would be no negotiations pertaining to his sexual abuse. Berdella finished this discussion with a stern warning: \"I've gotten this far with other people before, and they're dead now, because of mistakes they made.\"<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|15}}\n\n===Escape===\nBy the third day of his capture, Bryson had earned sufficient trust from Berdella to persuade him to establish a daily regime of tying his hands in front of him after his sexual abuse rather than above his head and to the bed upon the excuse that Berdella's doing so was restricting the circulation to his arms; he had also persuaded Berdella to leave a television on within the room, with the remote control placed between his legs whenever Berdella was out of the room. However, he would later state to investigators that he had thought almost constantly about escaping.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|16}} The following day, he managed to break free of his restraints by burning through them using a book of matches Berdella had inadvertently left in the room and within his reach when he had left the house to go to his place of work.<ref>''The Murder Almanac'' {{ISBN|1-897784-04-X}} p. 13</ref>\n\nBryson then managed to escape from the house by jumping from a second floor window, wearing nothing besides a dog collar around his neck, breaking a bone in his foot in the process; he then ran toward a meter reader walking across the other side of the street, shouting for this individual to call the police.

Two officers were told to maintain a discreet [[surveillance]] of the property, as Bryson was driven to the [[Menorah Medical Center]], accompanied by a third officer, for treatment as the fourth officer radioed the [[Kansas City Police Department (Missouri)|Kansas City Police Department]] to request a formal [[search warrant]] of the property be drafted.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|24\u201325}}\n\n==Arrest==\nLater questioned in greater detail at the Kansas City Police Department,{{refn|group=n|This more detailed questioning occurred after Bryson had been released from the Menorah Medical Center, after he had undergone several days of treatment for his injuries.}} Bryson said he had been held against his will by the occupant of 4315 Charlotte Street, who had subjected him to four days of repeated sexual abuse, humiliation, and torture.

Several of these male prostitutes were also reluctant to accept him as a client both because of his penchant for drugging, injecting, and torturing his sexual partners and acquaintances, and also because he had long been considered a suspect in the disappearance of the two men whose personal possessions had been found in his house (Jerry Howell and James Ferris).<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>\n\nMissing person reports had been filed in relation to both these men, and Berdella had been extensively questioned in relation to both of these disappearances. In both instances, he had denied having anything to do with the individual's disappearance. Despite being considered a prime suspect in both cases, and being placed under surveillance, police had been unable to find any solid evidence linking him to either man's disappearance, and in both instances, after giving his initial statement to police, Berdella had indignantly refused to talk further without a lawyer present.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/25/us/macabre-mystery-surrounding-death-of-2-men-in-kansas-city.html|title=Macabre Mystery Surrounding Death of 2 Men in Kansas City|access-date=July 19, 2017|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 25, 1988}}</ref> He would later have his lawyer threaten to file [[Police misconduct|harassment]] accusations against police unless their questioning and surveillance of him ceased.\n\nJames Ferris's wife identified him in several instant photos found at Berdella's property, some taken after her husband's death.

As several of these images depicted a section of the body of the individual who had taken the photograph, on April 13, Berdella was ordered to pose nude for a series of photographs in order that portions of his body could be photographed in the precise angle depicted within these images for comparison with the original Polaroid images.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|121\u2013122}}\n\nAs numerous male names had been found scrawled upon various stenographer's pads at Berdella's address, the detectives began attempting to trace each individual. One of these individuals traced, a young man named Freddie Kellogg, was able to state to detectives he and several other young men had intermittently lodged with Berdella since the early 1980s, and that Berdella had been in the habit of plying his lodgers with drugs{{spnd}}typically intravenously{{spnd}}before engaging in sex with them regardless of whether they consented or not.<ref name=Kidnappings/>\n\nKellogg also stated Berdella had expressly stated that a condition of his lodging with him was for Kellogg to persuade young men whom Berdella found attractive to attend parties at Charlotte Street in order that Berdella could drug them. Should Berdella ever discover any of these individuals was a [[police informant]], he would use this knowledge as a tool in which he could blackmail the individual to his own advantage.<ref name=Kidnappings/> In spite of this condition of his living with Berdella, Kellogg further stated that numerous male prostitutes and addicts had been reluctant to engage in any form of contact with Berdella because of rumors regarding his links to the 1984 disappearance of Jerry Howell.\n\nIn addition to these disclosures, Kellogg was able to name three of the individuals depicted in the Polaroids as being Todd Stoops, Robert Sheldon, and Larry Wayne Pearson.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|94\u201395}} These investigators would shortly discover Berdella had paid a $30 fee to secure a bond for Pearson in June 1987 ({{inflation|US|30|1987|fmt=eq}}),{{inflation/fn|US}} and that no further records existed to indicate Pearson was still alive.

The entry reading \"CP\", for example, referred to the chlorpromazine he had injected into his victims to assist in his restraining them, whereas entries reading \"DC\" referred to swabbing their eyes with drain cleaner or the injection of the substance into their vocal cords.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/kansas-city-sex-slayer-detailed-diary-torture-murder-article-1.2723454|title=Kansas City Sicko Kept Detailed Diary, Photos of Sex Torture, Bondage and Murder|access-date=June 15, 2017|newspaper=Daily News|date=July 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nEntries reading \"EK\" or \"EKG\" referred to torture administered to his captives with electrical shocks, whereas several other entries contained the anatomical location where Berdella administered the abuse or torture to his victims.

Although one victim (Mark Wallace) had been seized by [[opportunism|opportunity]] when he had discovered him seeking shelter from a severe thunderstorm in his tool shed, his other five victims had been captured after he had unsuccessfully tried to steer them away from their general lifestyles, and had thus simply become frustrated at the failure of his efforts. On each victim's capture, Berdella described in graphic detail the sexual, physical, and emotional abuse to which he had subjected each victim, and which he had recorded within his torture logs. He tersely explained his successive actions to investigators on December 14 with the statement that he was \"capturing them first, and what developed, developed.\" Nonetheless, he did claim that he had tried to prevent any of his victims from developing any form of [[malnutrition]] or infection by occasionally administering [[antibiotics]], or nutrients [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]] as his abuse and torture escalated.<ref name=Burial/>{{rp|300}}\n\nThe methods of torture exhibited against his victims had included the administration of high-voltage electrical shocks, starvation, the application of [[alkalinity|alkali]]-based detergents to their throats, vocal cords, or eyes, and the bludgeoning of their hands with the intention of rendering these body parts unusable. One other method of torture was the insertion of needles beneath their fingernails.

Due to the frequent murders of prostitutes at that time and place, however, it is difficult to be certain of the number killed by Jack the Ripper. These particular murders are distinguished from other murders of sex workers during the same time period due to the post-mortem mutilations that occurred, and it is for that reason that other murders of prostitutes are not usually attributed to the Ripper, or are disputed.\n\n[[Peter Sutcliffe]] (aka the Yorkshire Ripper) murdered 13 women, some of whom were sex workers, from 1975\u20131980 in [[Northern England]].\n\n[[Gary Ridgway]] (aka the Green River Killer), confessed to killing 48 sex workers from 1982 to 1998, making him one of the most prolific serial killers in U.S. history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/11/05/green.river.killings/index.html |title=Green River Killer avoids death in plea deal - November 6, 2003 |publisher=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-03}}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Hansen]] murdered between 15 and 21 sex workers, near [[Anchorage, Alaska]], between 1980 and 1983.\n\n[[Joel Rifkin]] confessed to killing 17 sex workers in the New York area between 1989 and 1993, without there having been a missing persons report filed on any of the women during that time.\n\n[[Robert Pickton]], a Canadian who lived near [[Vancouver]], made headlines after the remains of numerous missing sex workers were found on his family farm. He has now been convicted of the murders of 6 women who went missing from Vancouver's [[Downtown Eastside]], and is suspected by police of killing at least twenty more (though no charges have been filed in relation to their deaths).  In December 2007 he was sentenced to life in prison, with no possibility of parole for 25 years.\n\nIn December 2006, [[Steve Wright (serial killer)|Steve Wright]] murdered five sex workers in [[Ipswich]], [[England]] (see [[Ipswich serial murders]]).\n\n== Efforts to combat ==\nMost efforts to advocate for prostitutes have focused on prevention of the spread of AIDS/HIV+ among the general population rather than focusing on how certain policies would benefit the prostitutes themselves.<ref name=\":7\" />  This focus has neglected many of the issues of violence facing sex workers.  Recently, however, there has been an effort to eradicate violence against prostitutes from a wider perspective.  The United Nations Population Fund, in conjunction with several other organizations, recommends community empowerment, led by sex workers, as a way to combat violence against sex-workers.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Implementing comprehensive HIV/STI programmes with sex workers: Practical approaches from collaborative interventions|url = http://www.unfpa.org/publications/implementing-comprehensive-hivsti-programmes-sex-workers-practical-approaches|website = UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}</ref>   UNPF also advocates for changing perceptions to view sex work as work, rather than an illegal activity.  One issue facing efforts to prevent violence against prostitutes is that there is a low level of reporting violence among prostitutes.  A study of female sex-workers in India found that 54% of female sex-workers do not report violence committed against them, and only 36% shared their experience with NGOs or a peer or family member.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Non-Disclosure of Violence among Female Sex Workers: Evidence from a Large Scale Cross-Sectional Survey in India|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2014-05-20|pmc = 4028275|pmid = 24846145|pages = e98321|volume = 9|issue = 5|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0098321|first = Bidhubhusan|last = Mahapatra|first2 = Madhusudana|last2 = Battala|first3 = Akash|last3 = Porwal|first4 = Niranjan|last4 = Saggurti|bibcode = 2014PLoSO...998321M}}</ref>\n\n=== By sex workers ===\nBecause of the increased risk of violence associated with working in sex work, many prostitutes have begun adopting their own personal policies to reduce the likelihood of becoming the victims of violence.

This can, in turn, make it less likely that prostitutes take legal action against the perpetrators of violence against them because doing so could be risking jail time.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nOne possible policy option that the Netherlands has done would be to designate specific places for sex workers and clients to meet up and arrange and engage in sexual activities.<ref name=\":7\" />  This would provide a safe and secure place for sexual services to be sold without having to remain in private which can be a risk factor for violence against prostitutes.

Due to the frequent murders of prostitutes at that time and place, however, it is difficult to be certain of the number killed by Jack the Ripper. These particular murders are distinguished from other murders of sex workers during the same time period due to the post-mortem mutilations that occurred, and it is for that reason that other murders of prostitutes are not usually attributed to the Ripper, or are disputed.\n\n[[Peter Sutcliffe]] (aka the Yorkshire Ripper) murdered 13 women, some of whom were sex workers, from 1975-1980 in [[Northern England]].\n\n[[Gary Ridgway]] (aka the Green River Killer), confessed to killing 48 sex workers from 1982 to 1998, making him one of the most prolific serial killers in U.S. history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/11/05/green.river.killings/index.html |title=Green River Killer avoids death in plea deal - November 6, 2003 |publisher=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-03}}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Hansen]] murdered between 15 and 21 sex workers, near [[Anchorage, Alaska]], between 1980 and 1983.\n\n[[Joel Rifkin]] confessed to killing 17 sex workers in the New York area between 1989 and 1993, without there having been a missing persons report filed on any of the women during that time.\n\n[[Robert Pickton]], a Canadian who lived near [[Vancouver]], made headlines after the remains of numerous missing sex workers were found on his family farm. He has now been convicted of the murders of 6 women who went missing from Vancouver's [[Downtown Eastside]], and is suspected by police of killing at least twenty more (though no charges have been filed in relation to their deaths).  In December 2007 he was sentenced to life in prison, with no possibility of parole for 25 years.\n\nIn December 2006, [[Steve Wright (serial killer)|Steve Wright]] murdered five sex workers in [[Ipswich]], [[England]] (see [[Ipswich serial murders]]).\n\n== Efforts to combat ==\nMost efforts to advocate for prostitutes have focused on prevention of the spread of AIDS/HIV+ among the general population rather than focusing on how certain policies would benefit the prostitutes themselves.<ref name=\":7\" />  This focus has neglected many of the issues of violence facing sex workers.  Recently, however, there has been an effort to eradicate violence against prostitutes from a wider perspective.  The United Nations Population Fund, in conjunction with several other organizations, recommends community empowerment, led by sex workers, as a way to combat violence against sex-workers.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Implementing comprehensive HIV/STI programmes with sex workers: Practical approaches from collaborative interventions|url = http://www.unfpa.org/publications/implementing-comprehensive-hivsti-programmes-sex-workers-practical-approaches|website = UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}</ref>   UNPF also advocates for changing perceptions to view sex work as work, rather than an illegal activity.  One issue facing efforts to prevent violence against prostitutes is that there is a low level of reporting violence among prostitutes.  A study of female sex-workers in India found that 54% of female sex-workers do not report violence committed against them, and only 36% shared their experience with NGOs or a peer or family member.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Non-Disclosure of Violence among Female Sex Workers: Evidence from a Large Scale Cross-Sectional Survey in India|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2014-05-20|pmc = 4028275|pmid = 24846145|pages = e98321|volume = 9|issue = 5|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0098321|first = Bidhubhusan|last = Mahapatra|first2 = Madhusudana|last2 = Battala|first3 = Akash|last3 = Porwal|first4 = Niranjan|last4 = Saggurti|bibcode = 2014PLoSO...998321M}}</ref>\n\n=== By sex workers ===\nBecause of the increased risk of violence associated with working in sex work, many prostitutes have begun adopting their own personal policies to reduce the likelihood of becoming the victims of violence.  A study by Maureen A. Norton-Hawk found that \"40% percent of sex workers have a policy of refusing to provide services in an alley, 54% refuse to provide services in a drug house, and 68% refuse to provide services in an abandoned building.\"<ref name=\":8\" />  Often sex workers must rely on themselves or each other for support in ending violence as many campaigns to end violence against women ignore the needs of sex workers.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobs | first1 = Michelle S | year = 1999 | title = Prostitutes, Drug Users, and Thieves: The Invisible Women in the Campaign to End Violence Against Women | url = | journal = Temple Political & Civil Rights Law Review | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 459\u2013475 }}</ref>\n\n=== Government policy ===\n[[File:Sex Worker Rights - London SlutWalk 2011.jpg|thumb|Sex Workers' Rights demonstration at London SlutWalk 2011]]\n[[UN Women]] supports the decriminalization of sex work in order to protect sex-workers from violence and abuse and encourages the criminalization of forms of violence, coercion and exploitation in sex work.<ref name=\":3\"><nowiki>UN Women. \"Notes on Sex Work, Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking.\" NSWP (2013).

This policy has resulted in inadequate attention being paid to the health needs of prostitutes and limits the ability of the government to address the specific needs that sex workers have.<ref name=\":5\">Lerum, Kari.\"Reducing Violence against Sex Workers: What are the policy options?.\" Human Rights for All (2011). Accessed September 22, 2015.</ref>  Furthermore, in the United States, many states have mandatory minimum sentencing laws that require judges to give anyone convicted of prostitution a mandatory minimum prison sentence.  This can, in turn, make it less likely that prostitutes take legal action against the perpetrators of violence against them because doing so could be risking jail time.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nOne possible policy option that the Netherlands has done would be to designate specific places for sex workers and clients to meet up and arrange and engage in sexual activities.<ref name=\":7\" />  This would provide a safe and secure place for sexual services to be sold without having to remain in private which can be a risk factor for violence against prostitutes.  Some organizations have even suggested forming support groups composed of sex workers in the area as a way to give sex workers the support they often lack.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Prostitution}}\n*[[International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers]]\n*[[Violence against women]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal |ref=harv |last1=Potterat |first1=John J. |last2=Brewer |first2=Devon D. |last3=Muth |first3=Stephen Q. |last4=Rothenberg |first4=Richard B. |last5=Woodhouse |first5=Donald E. |last6=Muth |first6=John B. |last7=Stites |first7=Heather K. |last8=Brody |first8=Stuart |year=2004 |title=Mortality in a Long-term Open Cohort of Prostitute Women |journal=American Journal of Epidemiology |volume=159 |issue=8 |pages=778\u201385 |doi=10.1093/aje/kwh110 |pmid=15051587}}\n* {{cite journal |ref=harv |last1=Weitzer |first1=Ronald |year=2005 |title=New directions in research on prostitution |journal=Crime, Law and Social Change |volume=43 |issue=4\u20135 |pages=211\u201335 |doi=10.1007/s10611-005-1735-6|citeseerx=10.1.1.545.4191 }}\n* {{cite journal |ref= |last1=Weitzer |first1=Ronald |year=2006 |title=Moral crusade against prostitution |journal=Society |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=33\u20138 |doi=10.1007/BF02687593}}\n* {{cite journal |ref=harv |last1=Castillo |first1=Dawn N. |last2=Jenkins |first2=E Lynn |year=1994 |title=Industries and Occupations at High Risk for Work-Related Homicide |journal=Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=125\u201332 |doi=10.1097/00043764-199402000-00006 |pmid=8176509}}\n*{{cite journal |ref=harv |last1=Wong |first1=William C.W. |last2=Holroyd |first2=Eleanor |last3=Bingham |first3=Amie |year=2011 |title=Stigma and sex work from the perspective of female sex workers in Hong Kong|journal=Sociology of Health & Illness |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=50\u201363 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9566.2010.01276.x |pmid=21226729}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{Violence against women/end}}\n\n[[Category:Crimes against sex workers| ]]\n[[Category:Gender-related violence]]\n[[Category:Prostitution]]\n[[Category:Violence against women]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSerial killers:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 1975-1980 \u2192 1975\u20131980", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_prostitutes"}
