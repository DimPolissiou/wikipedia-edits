Due to constant criticism from critics about not being a \"credible group\" in contrast to other established music acts, as well as expectations to beat their [[No Strings Attached (NSYNC album)|previous album's]] first week sales of 2.4 million copies, NSYNC began experimenting with different sounds for the album, such as [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[electronica]], [[2-step garage|two-step]], and [[new jack swing]]. Similar to ''No Strings Attached'', a wide range of producers contributed to the album, including [[BT (musician)|BT]], [[Rodney Jerkins]], [[Brian McKnight]], [[PAJAM]], and [[The Neptunes]]. [[Justin Timberlake]] and [[JC Chasez]] were also more hands-on with production, co-writing ten of thirteen tracks, in an effort to find the album's unique tone.\n\nAfter suffering from two delays due to unfinished recording sessions, ''Celebrity'' was released to generally positive reception by critics. The album was the band's second to debut at number-one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with first-week sales of 1,879,495 copies, the second best debut-week sales in the country at the time until the release of [[Adele]]'s ''[[25 (Adele album)|25]]'' in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|title=Adele's '25' Is the 20th Album to Sell a Million Copies in a Week: See the Full List|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6770482/adele-25-other-million-selling-albums|website=Billboard|access-date=January 5, 2016}}</ref> They embarked on two tours to promote the album's release; [[PopOdyssey]] and the [[Celebrity Tour]]. Initially, the release date of ''Celebrity'' was meant to coincide with PopOdyssey, however, constant delays meant that NSYNC performed the majority of the songs on tour before the album was released.\n\n==Background==\nAt the 2000 [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]] on December 5, NSYNC announced that they would begin \"experimenting with new music\" for their third studio album in January\u2013February 2001, at a recording studio in Florida.<ref name=\"MTVStudio\"/> [[Justin Timberlake]] revealed that they planned to spend two months there to come up with ideas, while [[Joey Fatone]] stated that the group may leave the state as the album progresses.

Due to constant criticism from critics about not being a \"credible group\" in contrast to other established music acts, as well as expectations to beat their [[No Strings Attached (NSYNC album)|previous album's]] first week sales of 2.4 million copies, NSYNC began experimenting with different sounds for the album, such as [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[electronica]], [[2-step garage|two-step]], and [[new jack swing]]. Similar to ''No Strings Attached'', a wide range of producers contributed to the album, including [[BT (musician)|BT]], [[Rodney Jerkins]], [[Brian McKnight]], [[PAJAM]], and [[The Neptunes]]. [[Justin Timberlake]] and [[JC Chasez]] were also more hands-on with production, co-writing ten of thirteen tracks, in an effort to find the album's unique tone.\n\nAfter suffering from two delays due to unfinished recording sessions, ''Celebrity'' was released to generally positive reception by critics. The album was the band's second to debut at number-one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with first-week sales of 1,879,495 copies, the second best debut-week sales in the country at the time until the release of [[Adele]]'s ''[[25 (Adele album)|25]]'' in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|title=Adele's '25' Is the 20th Album to Sell a Million Copies in a Week: See the Full List|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6770482/adele-25-other-million-selling-albums|website=Billboard|access-date=January 5, 2016}}</ref> They embarked on two tours to promote the album's release; [[PopOdyssey]] and the [[Celebrity Tour]]. Initially, the release date of ''Celebrity'' was meant to coincide with PopOdyssey, however, constant delays meant that NSYNC performed the majority of the songs on tour before the album was released.\n\n==Background==\nAt the 2000 [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]] on December 5, NSYNC announced that they would begin \"experimenting with new music\" for their third studio album in January\u2013February 2001, at a recording studio in Florida.<ref name=\"MTVStudio\"/> [[Justin Timberlake]] revealed that they planned to spend two months there to come up with ideas, while [[Joey Fatone]] stated that the group may leave the state as the album progresses. NSYNC revealed that they wanted to work with [[Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs]] and [[Richard Marx]], who they had collaborated with on their second studio album, ''[[No Strings Attached (NSYNC album)|No Strings Attached]]''.<ref name=\"MTVStudio\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1375008/nsync-to-hit-studio-in-january/|title= 'NSYNC to Hit Studio in January|first=Teri|last=Vanhorn|publisher=[[MTV News]]|date=December 7, 2000|access-date=February 15, 2016}}</ref>\n{{multiple image|align=right\n|total_width=250\n|image1=JC Chasez (cropped).jpg\n|image2=Justin Timberlake - Justified World Tour - Earls Court - 6 (cropped).jpg\n|footer=[[JC Chasez]] and [[Justin Timberlake]] co-wrote ten of thirteen songs on the album and produced the majority of the tracklist in an effort to experiment with different sounds and genres.<ref name=\"MTVSeek\"/>\n}}\nAlthough ''No Strings Attached'' sold 14 million copies worldwide, including 2.4 million in the US during its opening week, the group were constantly ridiculed by critics, as they did not fit their preconceptions as a \"credible group\" and weren't considered \"artistic\".<ref name=\"CelebrityBillboard\"/><ref name=\"RSPop\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/n-sync-true-tales-of-the-pop-life-236982/|title='N Sync: True Tales of the Pop Life|author=Tour\u00e9|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=August 16, 2001|access-date=March 29, 2020}}</ref> In response, they decided to be more involved in production, co-writing ten of the album's thirteen tracks. [[JC Chasez]] discussed the album's recording process in an interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'':<ref name=\"CelebrityBillboard\"/><blockquote>Our objective was not to be self-conscious and try to make another hit record. Instead, we set out to make a record that was more reflective of what turns us on musically. We also wanted to prove that pop music comes in a lot of different flavors.

He finally agreed when Timberlake was willing to work with the sound used in \"The Hip Hop Phenomenon\", taken from the UK version of his 1999 album ''[[Movement in Still Life]]'', stating \"If you wanna do something that [[Punk rock|punk-rock]], I'll do it\".<ref name=\"MTVSeek\"/><ref name=\"BT\"/> During production, BT used special equipment usually used in movie sound effects, and constantly yelled out [[Michael Jackson]]'s name towards Timberlake.<ref name=\"BT\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1444712/bt-earns-king-of-dirty-pop-title-with-nsync-britney-tracks/|title=BT Earns 'King Of Dirty Pop' Title With 'NSYNC, Britney Tracks|last=Moss|first=Corey|website=[[MTV News]]|date=June 22, 2001|access-date=March 6, 2020}}</ref> He wanted to ensure that the song transitioned from \"[[Contemporary R&B|new-school R&B]], [[Timbaland]]-style beats, to [[progressive house]]\".<ref name=\"BT\"/>\n\nThe album's second single \"[[Gone (NSYNC song)|Gone]]\" was initially written as a duet between Timberlake and Michael Jackson, but was declined by the latter.<ref name=\"GoneUpcoming\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6084534/justin-timberlake-duet-michael-jackson-gone-oprah|title=Justin Timberlake Nearly Had Duet With Michael Jackson a Decade Ago|last=Payne|first=Chris|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=May 8, 2014|access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref> Timberlake brought the song up to the band's A&R team, where it was eventually recorded by the group.

At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an [[Weighted mean|average]] score of 65 based on 11 reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>\n\nUpon the album's release, ''[[AllMusic]]'' senior editor [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] wrote that ''Celebrity'' is NSYNC's \"most varied album yet, but the emergence of Timberlake and Chasez as credible soulful singers and, yes, songwriters makes it their best album yet, and one of the best of the teen pop boom of 1999\u20132001\".<ref name=\"ErlewineAllRev\"/> J.D. Considine of ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' felt that the album \"shines brightest when the group matures enough to forget about its image and focus on the tunes\", stating that songs such as \"Up Against the Wall\" and \"Celebrity\" aren't as satisfying as the gently melodic \"Something Like You.\"<ref name=\"Blender\"/> In ''[[Robert Christgau#Consumer Guide|Christgau's Consumer Guide]]'', [[Robert Christgau]] gave the album a one-star honorable mention, writing that \"they survive writing their own songs\", giving examples of \"Selfish\" and \"Do Your Thing\".<ref name=\"ConsumerGuide\"/> David Browne of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated that the album was \"the consummate teen-pop experience\", praising their diversification of genres ranging from R&B, ballads, self-expression and Europop.<ref name=\"EW\"/>\n\nAlex Needham of ''[[NME]]'' gave the album an 8/10 score, writing that although NSYNC shows discontent in the album, they \"have the tunes to make up for it\".<ref name=\"NME\"/> In a review from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Barry Walters highlighted how the anxiety in their vocals have allowed them to \"pave a new high road for teen pop\u2019s future\".<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\"/> Writing for ''[[Slant Magazine|Slant]]'', Sal Cinquemani criticized the album's experimental approach, writing that it was \"unfortunate that the group couldn\u2019t completely discard the classic hit-making formula in favor of the more experimental pop that seems so inherent in this and their last album, ''No Strings Attached''.\" However, he was optimistic that the band could become \"[[The Beatles]] of their generation\" if they survive the growing pains and their aging demographic.<ref name=\"SlantMagazine\"/>\n\n==Commercial performance==\nIn the United States, ''Celebrity'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

Several prominent mills closed down, leaving between 40,000 and 50,000 people without a source of income, and many moved into informal settlements in the city center. The [[Amdavad Municipal Corporation|Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation]] (AMC), the governing and administrative body of the city, simultaneously lost much of its tax base and saw an increased demand for services. In the 1990s, newly emerging pharmaceutical, chemical, and automobile manufacturing industries required skilled labor, so many migrants seeking work ended up in the informal sector and settled in slums.<ref name=\":0\">Bhatkal, Tanvi, William Avis, and Susan Nicolai. \"A Cautionary Tale of Progress in Ahmedabad,\" n.d., 48.</ref>\n\nAhmedabad has been relatively successful in its efforts to reduce poverty and improve the living conditions of poor residents. The urban poverty rate has declined from 28% in 1993\u20131994 to 10% in 2011\u20132012.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is partly due to the strengthening of the AMC and its partnership with several civil society organizations (CSOs) representing poor residents. Through several projects and programs (see below), the AMC has provided utilities and basic services to slums. However, there are challenges that remain, and there are still many residents who lack access to sanitation, improved water, and electricity. Riots, often rooted in religious tensions, threaten the stability of neighborhoods and have caused spatial segregation across religious and caste lines. Finally, the conception of pro-poor, inclusive development is being overshadowed by a national initiative promoting the creation of 'global cities' of capital investment and technological innovation. This has shifted priorities towards constructing new housing and attracting private development rather than servicing the urban poor.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Informal Housing/Slums ====\nAs of 2011, about 66% of the population lives in formal housing. The other 34% lives in slums or ''chawls'', which are tenements for industrial workers. There are approximately 700 slum settlements in Ahmedabad, and 11% of the total housing stock is public housing. The population of Ahmedabad has increased while the housing stock has remained basically constant, and this has led to densification of both formal and informal housing and a more economical use of existing space. The Indian census estimates that the Ahmedabad slum population was 25.6% of the total population in 1991 and decreased to 4.5% in 2011, but these numbers are contested and local entities maintain that the census underestimates informal populations. There is a consensus that there has been a reduction in the percentage of the population who lives in slum settlements, and a general improvement in living conditions for slum residents.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Slum Networking Project ====\nIn the 1990s, the AMC faced increased slum populations. They found that residents were willing and able to pay for legal connections to water, sewage, and electricity, but because of tenure issues they were paying higher prices for low-quality, informal connections. To address this, beginning in 1995, the AMC partnered with civil society organizations to create the Slum Networking Project (SNP) to improve basic services in 60 slums, benefitting approximately 13,000 households.<ref name=\":0\" /> This project, also known as ''Parivartan (Change)'', involved [[participatory planning]] in which slum residents were partners alongside AMC, private institutions, microfinance lenders, and local NGOs. The goal of the program was to provide both physical infrastructure (including water supply, sewers, individual toilets, paved roads, storm drainage, and tree planting) and community development (i.e. the formation of resident associations, women's groups, community health interventions, and vocational training).<ref name=\":1\">World Bank. 2007.

The project cost a total of Rs. 4350 million. Community members and the private sector each contributed Rs. 600 million, NGOs provided Rs. 90 million, and the AMC paid for the rest of the project.<ref name=\":1\" /> Each slum household was responsible for no more than 12% of the cost of upgrading their home.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis project has generally been regarded as a success. Having access to basic services increased the residents' working hours, since most worked out of their homes. It also reduced the incidence of illness, particularly water-borne illness, and increased children's rates of school attendance.<ref>SEWA Academy (2002) ''Parivartan and its impact: A Partnership Programme of Infrastructure Development in Slums of Ahmedabad City.''

Several prominent mills closed down, leaving between 40,000 and 50,000 people without a source of income, and many moved into informal settlements in the city center. The [[Amdavad Municipal Corporation|Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation]] (AMC), the governing and administrative body of the city, simultaneously lost much of its tax base and saw an increased demand for services. In the 1990s, newly emerging pharmaceutical, chemical, and automobile manufacturing industries required skilled labor, so many migrants seeking work ended up in the informal sector and settled in slums.<ref name=\":0\">Bhatkal, Tanvi, William Avis, and Susan Nicolai. \"A Cautionary Tale of Progress in Ahmedabad,\" n.d., 48.</ref>\n\nAhmedabad has been relatively successful in its efforts to reduce poverty and improve the living conditions of poor residents. The urban poverty rate has declined from 28% in 1993\u20131994 to 10% in 2011\u20132012.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is partly due to the strengthening of the AMC and its partnership with several civil society organizations (CSOs) representing poor residents. Through several projects and programs (see below), the AMC has provided utilities and basic services to slums. However, there are challenges that remain, and there are still many residents who lack access to sanitation, improved water, and electricity. Riots, often rooted in religious tensions, threaten the stability of neighborhoods and have caused spatial segregation across religious and caste lines. Finally, the conception of pro-poor, inclusive development is being overshadowed by a national initiative promoting the creation of 'global cities' of capital investment and technological innovation. This has shifted priorities towards constructing new housing and attracting private development rather than servicing the urban poor.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Informal Housing/Slums ====\nAs of 2011, about 66% of the population lives in formal housing. The other 34% lives in slums or ''chawls'', which are tenements for industrial workers. There are approximately 700 slum settlements in Ahmedabad, and 11% of the total housing stock is public housing. The population of Ahmedabad has increased while the housing stock has remained basically constant, and this has led to densification of both formal and informal housing and a more economical use of existing space. The Indian census estimates that the Ahmedabad slum population was 25.6% of the total population in 1991 and decreased to 4.5% in 2011, but these numbers are contested and local entities maintain that the census underestimates informal populations. There is a consensus that there has been a reduction in the percentage of the population who lives in slum settlements, and a general improvement in living conditions for slum residents.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Slum Networking Project ====\nIn the 1990s, the AMC faced increased slum populations. They found that residents were willing and able to pay for legal connections to water, sewage, and electricity, but because of tenure issues they were paying higher prices for low-quality, informal connections. To address this, beginning in 1995, the AMC partnered with civil society organizations to create the Slum Networking Project (SNP) to improve basic services in 60 slums, benefitting approximately 13,000 households.<ref name=\":0\" /> This project, also known as ''Parivartan (Change)'', involved [[participatory planning]] in which slum residents were partners alongside AMC, private institutions, microfinance lenders, and local NGOs. The goal of the program was to provide both physical infrastructure (including water supply, sewers, individual toilets, paved roads, storm drainage, and tree planting) and community development (i.e. the formation of resident associations, women's groups, community health interventions, and vocational training).<ref name=\":1\">World Bank. 2007.

The project cost a total of Rs. 4350 million. Community members and the private sector each contributed Rs. 600 million, NGOs provided Rs. 90 million, and the AMC paid for the rest of the project.<ref name=\":1\" /> Each slum household was responsible for no more than 12% of the cost of upgrading their home.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis project has generally been regarded as a success. Having access to basic services increased the residents' working hours, since most worked out of their homes. It also reduced the incidence of illness, particularly water-borne illness, and increased children's rates of school attendance.<ref>SEWA Academy (2002) ''Parivartan and its impact: A Partnership Programme of Infrastructure Development in Slums of Ahmedabad City.''

Later, after weakening and disintegration (after the Kamarupa-Palas), the Kamarupa tradition was extended to c. 1255 AD by the Lunar I (c. 1120\u20131185 AD) and Lunar II (c. 1155\u20131255 AD) dynasties.<ref name=\"HKBarpujariCHOA\" />\n\n=== Medieval era ===\n{{further|Kamata kingdom|Ahom kingdom|Chutiya kingdom|Kachari kingdom|Baro-Bhuyan}}\nFour later dynasties were the [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutiya]], [[Dimasa kingdom|Dimasa]], the [[Ahom Dynasty|Ahoms]] and the [[Koch dynasty|Koch]].\n\nThe Ahoms, a [[Tai peoples|Tai]] group, ruled [[Upper Assam]]<ref>Banikanta Kakati, ''Assamese:Its formation and development''</ref> The Shans built their kingdom and consolidated their power in Eastern Assam with the modern town of [[Sibsagar]] as their capital. Until the early 1500s, the Ahoms ruled a small kingdom in [[Sibsagar district]] and suddenly expanded during King Suhungmung's rule taking advantage of weakening rule of Chutia and Dimasa kingdoms. By 1681, the whole track down to the border of the modern district of Goalpara came permanently under their sway. Ahoms ruled for nearly 600 years (1228\u20131826 AD) with major expansions in the early 16th century at the cost of [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutia]] and [[Kachari kingdom|Dimasa Kachari]] kingdoms. Since c. the 13th century AD, the nerve centre of Ahom polity was upper Assam; the kingdom was gradually extended to the [[Karatoya River]] in the 17th or 18th century. It was at its zenith during the reign of [[Sukhrungphaa]] or Sworgodeu Rudra Sinha (c. 1696\u20131714 AD).\n\nThe Chutiya rulers (1187\u20131673 AD), a [[Bodo-Kachari people|Bodo-Kachari]] group by origin, held the regions on both the banks of Brahmaputra with its domain in the area eastwards from [[Biswanath Chariali|Vishwanath]] (north bank) and [[Dihing River|Buridihing]] (south bank), in [[Upper Assam]] and in the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. It was partially annexed in the early 1500s by the Ahoms, finally getting absorbed in 1673 AD. The rivalry between the Chutiyas and Ahoms for the supremacy of eastern Assam led to a series of battles between them from the early 16th century until the start of the 17th century, which saw great loss of men and money.\n\nThe Koch, another [[Bodo-Kachari people|Bodo-Kachari]] dynasty, established sovereignty in c. 1510 AD. The Koch kingdom in Western Assam and present-day [[North Bengal]] was at its zenith in the early reign of [[Nara Narayan]] (c. 1540\u20131587 AD). It split into two in c. 1581 CE, the western part as a [[Moghul]] vassal and the eastern as an Ahom satellite state. Later, in 1682, [[Koch Hajo]] was entirely annexed by the Ahoms.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Kamarupa Kingdom.png|Kamarupa Kingdom\nFile:Ahom-kingdom-c1826p.png|The [[Ahom Kingdom]], c. 1826\nFile:Ahom insignia plain.svg|Insignia of Ahom Kingdom\nFile:Gargaon'r Kareng Ghor Side View.JPG|[[Kareng ghar]], the palace of the Ahom kings in their former capital [[Garhgaon]]\nFile:Sutiyakingdom.jpg|Chutia kingdom: Coat of Arms\nFile:Bhismaknagar ruins.jpg|Chutia Royal Palace [[Bhismaknagar]] ruins\nFile:Drapeau Cooch Behar.png|Koch kingdom: Coat of Arms\nFile:Coochbehar palace.jpg|Koch Royal Palace\nFile:Kachari Palace.JPG|Dimasa palace ruins\nFile:Kamakhya Guwahati.JPG|Kamakhya Temple rebuilt by Koch King\n</gallery>\nAmong other dynasties, the [[Kachari Kingdom|Dimasa]], another [[Bodo-Kachari people|Bodo-Kachari]] dynasty, (13th century-1854 AD) ruled from Dikhow River to central and southern Assam and had their capital at [[Dimapur]]. With the expansion of Ahom kingdom, by the early 17th century, the Chutiya areas were annexed and since c. 1536 AD the Kacharis remained only in [[Cachar]] and [[North Cachar]], and more as an Ahom ally than a competing force.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Sukapha.jpg|First [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom]] king [[Sukapha|Chao-lung Siu-ka-phaa]]\nFile:Portrait of Queen Sadhani.jpg|The last Chutia queen [[Sati Sadhani|Sadhani]]\nFile:Maharaja-Jagaddipendra-Narayan.jpg|The Statue of Koch king Jagadipendra Narayan\nFile:Raja Govinda Chandra Hasnu.jpg|Last Dimasa King, Govindra Chandra Hasnu\n</gallery>\n\nDespite numerous invasions, mostly by the Muslim rulers, no western power ruled Assam until the arrival of the British. Though the [[Mughal empire|Mughals]] made seventeen attempts to invade, they were never successful. The most successful invader [[Mir Jumla II|Mir Jumla]], a governor of [[Aurangzeb]], briefly occupied [[Garhgaon]] (c. 1662\u201363 AD), the then capital, but found it difficult to prevent [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] attacks on his forces, forcing them to leave. The decisive victory of the Assamese led by general [[Lachit Borphukan]] on the Mughals, then under command of Raja Ram Singha, at [[Saraighat]] in 1671 almost ended Mughal ambitions in this region. The Mughals were finally expelled from Lower Assam during the reign of [[Supaatphaa|Gadadhar Singha]] in 1682 AD.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n=== Colonial era ===\n[[File:Bengal gazetteer 1907-9.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|<center>Map of [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]] during 1907\u20131909</center>]]\n[[File:British Indian Empire 1909 Imperial Gazetteer of India.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|<center>A map of the [[British Raj|British Indian Empire]] in 1909 during the partition of Bengal (1905\u20131911), showing British India in two shades of pink ([[Coral pink|coral]] and pale) and the [[princely state]]s in yellow.

Although the number of speakers is growing, the percentage of Assam's population who have it as a mother tongue has fallen slightly. The various Bengali dialects and closely related languages are spoken by around 9 million people in Assam, and the portion of the population that speaks these languages has grown slightly. Hindi is the third most-spoken language.\n\nTraditionally, Assamese was the language of the common folk in the ancient [[Kamarupa kingdom]] and in the medieval kingdoms of [[Kachari kingdom|Dimasa Kachari]], [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutiya Kachari]], Borahi Kachari, [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom]] and [[Koch kingdom|Koch Kachari Kingdom of Kamatapur]]. Traces of the language are found in many poems by Luipa, Sarahapa, and others, in [[Charyapada]] (c. 7th\u20138th century AD). Modern dialects such as Kamrupi and [[Goalpariya dialect|Goalpariya]] are remnants of this language. Moreover, Assamese in its traditional form was used by the ethno-cultural groups in the region as lingua-franca, which spread during the stronger kingdoms and was required for economic integration. Localised forms of the language still exist in Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nLinguistically modern Assamese traces its roots to the version developed by the American Missionaries based on the local form used near [[Sivasagar]] (Xiw\u00f4xag\u00f4r) district. Assamese (''\u00d4x\u00f4miya'') is a rich language due to its hybrid nature and unique characteristics of pronunciation and softness. The presence of [[Voiceless velar fricative]] in Assamese makes it a unique among other similar [[Indo-Aryan languages]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Das|first=Ankur|last2=Deka|first2=Tusmita|title=The Allophonic Variation of the Assamese voiceless velar fricative /x/|url=https://www.academia.edu/35777293}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.languagesgulper.com/eng/Assamese.html|title=Assamese|website=www.languagesgulper.com|access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nBodo is an ancient language of Assam. Spatial distribution patterns of the ethno-cultural groups, cultural traits and the phenomenon of naming all the major rivers in the [[North-East India|North East Region]] with Bodo-Kachari words (e.g. [[Dihing]], Dibru, [[Dihong]], D/[[Teesta River|Tista]], and Dikrai) reveal that it was the most important language in ancient times. Bodo is now spoken largely in the Western Assam (BTAD). After years of neglect, now Bodo language is getting attention and its literature is developing. Other native languages of Tibeto-Burman origin and related to Bodo-Kachari are [[Deori language|Deori]], [[Mising language|Mising]], [[Karbi language|Karbi]], [[Rabha language|Rabha]], and [[Tiwa (Lalung)|Tiwa]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThere are approximately 564,000 [[Nepali language|Nepali]] speakers spread all over the state forming about 2.12% of Assam's total population according to 2001 census.\n\nThere are speakers of [[Tai languages]] in Assam.

The Vaishanava Movement, the 15th century religio-cultural movement under the leadership of [[Srimanta Sankardeva]] (Sonkordeu) and his disciples have provided another dimension to Assamese culture. A renewed Hinduisation in local forms took place, which was initially greatly supported by the Koch and later by the Ahom Kingdoms. The resultant social institutions such as ''[[namghar]]'' and ''[[sattra]]'' (the Vaishnav Monasteries) have become part of the Assamese way of life. The movement contributed greatly towards language, literature, and performing and fine arts.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe modern culture has been influenced by events in the British and the post-British era. The language was standardised by American [[Baptist]] [[Missionary|Missionaries]] such as [[Nathan Brown (missionary)|Nathan Brown]], [[Miles Bronson and the Noctes|Dr. Miles Bronson]] and local pundits such as [[Hemchandra Barua]] with the form available in the [[Sibsagar]] (''Sivasagar'') District (the ex-nerve centre of the Ahom Kingdom).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIncreasing efforts of standardisation in the 20th century alienated the localised forms present in different areas and with the less-assimilated [[Ethnic groups|ethno-cultural groups]] (many source-cultures). However, Assamese culture in its hybrid form and nature is one of the richest, still developing and in true sense is a '[[cultural system]]' with sub-systems. Many source-cultures of the Assamese cultural-system are still surviving either as sub-systems or as sister entities, e.g. the; [[Bodo people|Bodo]] or [[Karbi people|Karbi]] or [[Mising people|Mishing]]. It is important to keep the broader system closer to its roots and at the same time focus on development of the sub-systems.\n\nSome of the common and unique cultural traits in the region are peoples' respect towards [[Betel nut|areca-nut]] and [[betel]] leaves, symbolic ([[gamosa]], arnai, etc.), [[Assam silk|traditional silk]] garments (e.g. [[mekhela chador]], traditional dress of Assamese women) and towards forefathers and elderly. Moreover, great hospitality and bamboo culture are common.\n\n=== Symbols ===\n{{See also|List of Assam state symbols|Jaapi}}\n[[File:Bihu Assam.jpg|thumb|upright|<center>Girl in traditional [[Mekhela chador]] dress with a[[Dhol]] wrapped with Gamosa</center>]]\n[[File:Jaapi with Gamosa.jpg|thumb|upright|<center>A decorative Assamese ''[[Jaapi]]'' laid over a Gamosa</center>]]\nSymbolism is an ancient cultural practice in Assam and is still a very important part of the Assamese way of life. Various elements are used to represent beliefs, feelings, pride, identity, etc. ''Tamulpan'', ''[[Xorai]]'' and ''Gamosa'' are three important symbolic elements in Assamese culture. ''Tamulpan'' (the areca nut and betel leaves) or ''guapan'' (gua from ''kwa'') are considered along with the Gamosa (a typical woven cotton or silk cloth with embroidery) as the offers of devotion, respect and friendship. The Tamulpan-tradition is an ancient one and is being followed since time-immemorial with roots in the aboriginal Austric culture. ''[[Xorai]]'' is a traditionally manufactured bell-metal article of great respect and is used as a container-medium while performing respectful offers. Moreover, symbolically many ethno-cultural groups use specific clothes to portray respect and pride.\n\nThere were many other symbolic elements and designs, but are now only found in literature, art, sculpture, architecture, etc. or in use today for only religious purposes. The typical designs of ''Assamese-lion'', ''dragon'', and ''flying-lion'' were used for symbolising various purposes and occasions. The archaeological sites such as the Madan Kamdev (c. 9th\u201310th centuries AD) exhibits mass-scale use of lions, dragon-lions and many other figures of demons to show case power and prosperity. The Vaishnava monasteries and many other architectural sites of the late medieval period display the use of lions and dragons for symbolic effects.\n\n=== Festivals and traditions ===\n{{Main|List of festivals in Assam}}\n{{See also|Domahi|Bohag Bihu|Magh Bihu|Bwisagu}}\n[[File:Assamese Jaapi .jpg|thumb|upright|A beautifully adorned [[Jaapi]]]]\n[[File:Bihu dancer with a horn.jpg|thumb|upright|left|<center>A [[Bihu]] dancer blowing a ''[[pepa (musical instrument)|pepa]]'' (horn)</center>]]\n[[File:Ali-ai-ligang.jpg|thumb|''Tribal'' \u2013 Mising girls dancing during Ali Ai Ligang (Spring Festival)]]\nThere are diversified important traditional festivals in Assam. Bihu is the most important and common and celebrated all over Assam. It is the Assamese new year celebrated in April of the Gregorian calendar. [[Christmas]] is observed with great merriment by [[Christians]] of various denominations, including [[Catholics]] and [[Protestants]], throughout Assam. [[Durga Puja]], a festival introduced and popularised by [[Bengalis]], is widely celebrated across the state. Muslims celebrate two Eids ([[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid al-Adha]]) with much eagerness all over Assam.[[File:Sattriya by Dancer Meenakshi Medhi.JPG|thumb|[[Sattriya|Sattriya Dance]] ]]\n\n[[Bihu]] is a series of three prominent festivals. Primarily a non-religious festival celebrated to mark the seasons and the significant points of a cultivator's life over a yearly cycle. Three Bihus, ''rongali'' or ''bohag'', celebrated with the coming of spring and the beginning of the sowing season; ''kongali'' or ''kati'', the barren bihu when the fields are lush but the barns are empty; and the ''[[Bhogali Bihu|bhogali]]'' or ''magh'', the thanksgiving when the crops have been harvested and the barns are full. Bihu songs and Bihu dance are associated to ''rongali'' bihu. The day before the each bihu is known as 'uruka'. The first day of 'rongali bihu' is called 'Goru bihu' (the bihu of the cows), when the cows are taken to the nearby rivers or ponds to be bathed with special care. In recent times the form and nature of celebration has changed with the growth of urban centres.\n\n[[Bwisagu]] is one of the popular seasonal festivals of the [[Bodo people|Bodos]]. Bwisagu start of the new year or age. Baisagu is a Boro word which originated from the word \"Baisa\" which means year or age, ang \"Agu\" that means starting or start.\n\nBeshoma is a festival of Deshi people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nenow.in/north-east-news/bihu-myriad-colours.html|title=Bihu \u2013 Its Myriad Colours|website=NORTHEAST NOW|language=en-US|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref> It is a celebration of sowing crop.

This festival is celebrated during the end of January. Officially 27 January has been declared as the day of Bushu Dima festival. The Dimasa people celebrate their festival by playing musical instruments- khram (a type of drum), muri (a kind of huge long flute). The people dances to the different tunes called \"murithai\" and each dance has got its name, the prominent being the \"Baidima\" There are three types of Bushu celebrated among the Dimasas Jidap, Surem and Hangsou.\n\nChavang Kut is a post harvesting festival of the [[Kuki people|Kuki]] people. The festival is celebrated on the first day of November every year. Hence, this particular day has been officially declared as a Restricted Holiday by the Assam government. In the past, the celebration was primarily important in the religio-cultural sense. The rhythmic movements of the dances in the festival were inspired by animals, agricultural techniques and showed their relationship with ecology. Today, the celebration witnesses the shifting of stages and is revamped to suit new contexts and interpretations. The traditional dances which form the core of the festival is now performed in out-of-village settings and are staged in a secular public sphere. In Assam, the Kukis mainly reside in the two autonomous districts of Dima Hasao and Karbi Anglong.\n\nMoreover, there are other important traditional festivals being celebrated every year on different occasions at different places. Many of these are celebrated by different ethno-cultural groups (sub and sister cultures). Some of these are:\n{{columns | width = 180px | gap = 5px\n| col1 =\n* [[Me-Dam-Me-Phi]]\n* [[Ali Ai Ligang|Ali-Aye-Ligang]]\n* [[Rongker]]\n* Kherai\n* Garja\n* Bisu ([[Deori people|Deori]])\n| col2 =\n* Awnkham Gwrlwi Janai\n* Chojun/Swarak\n* Deusi Bhailo ( Traditional Nepalese songs that are sung during the festival of light \" Dipavali '' and also called \"Tihar\" )\n* Sokk-erroi\n* Hacha-kekan\n* Hapsa Hatarnai\n| col3 =\n* [[Porag]]\n* [[Bathow]]\n* [[Wangala]]\n* [[Bohuwa dance]]\n}}\n\nOther few yearly celebrations are Doul Utsav of Barpeta, [[Brahmaputra Beach Festival]], Guwahati, [[Kaziranga Elephant Festival]], Kaziranga and [[Dehing Patkai Festival]], Lekhapani, Karbi Youth Festival of Diphu and International Jatinga Festival, [[Jatinga]] can not be forgotten.

is a state in northeastern [[India]], situated south of the eastern [[Himalayas]] along the [[Brahmaputra Valley|Brahmaputra]] and [[Barak River]] valleys. Assam covers an area of {{convert|78438|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. The state is bordered by [[Bhutan]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] to the north; [[Nagaland]] and [[Manipur]] to the east; [[Meghalaya]], [[Tripura]], [[Mizoram]] and [[Bangladesh]] to the south; and [[West Bengal]] to the west via the [[Siliguri Corridor]], a {{convert|22|km}} strip of land that connects the state to the rest of India.\n\nAssam is known for [[Assam tea]] and [[Assam silk]].

The Assamese economy is aided by [[wildlife tourism]] to [[Kaziranga National Park]] and [[Manas National Park]], which are [[World Heritage Site]]s. [[Shorea robusta|Sal tree]] forests are found in the state which, as a result of abundant rainfall, look green all year round. Assam receives more rainfall than most parts of India; this rain feeds the [[Brahmaputra River]], whose tributaries and [[oxbow lake]]s provide the region with a hydro-[[geomorphic]] environment.\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{Main|Etymology of Assam}}\nThe precise etymology of the modern anglicised word \"Assam\" is ambiguous. In the classical period and up to the 12th century the region east of the [[Karatoya river]], largely congruent to present-day Assam, was called [[Kamarupa]], and alternatively, [[Pragjyotisha]].<ref>\"Prior to the thirteenth century the present region was called K\u0101mar\u016bpa or, alternatively, Pr\u0101gjyoti\u1e63apur\", Lahiri, Nayanjot., ''Pre-Ahom Assam'' (Delhi 1991) p. 14</ref> In medieval times the Mughals used ''Asham'' (eastern Assam) and Kamrup (western Assam),<ref>Sukalpa Bhattacharjee, C Joshua Thomas,2013,''Society, Representation and Textuality:The Critical Interface'' It deals with the expansion of the Mughal Empire in Bengal, Kamrup and Assam.</ref><ref>Satish Chandra (2005), ''Medieval India:Fro Sultanate to the Mughals Part \u2013 II'' They had support of many Hindu Rajas of Jessore, Kamrup (Western Assam), Cachar, Tippera, etc.</ref><ref>Peter Jackson,2003,''The Delhi Sultanate: A Political and Military History'', P. 141, into the region of Assam the Muslims called Kamrup or Kamrud</ref> and during the British colonial era, the British used Assam. Though many authors have associated the name with the 13th century Shan invaders<ref>\"The word 'Assamese' is an English one based on the anglicised form 'Assam' from the native word \"Asam\", which in its turn is connected with the Shans who invaded the Brahmaputra Valley in the 13th century.\" Kakati, Banikanta, ''Aspects of Early Assamese Literature'' (Gauhati University Press, 1953) p1; \"Assam is the English form of 'Asama' (i.e. peerless) which is apparently a Sanskritised form of the tribal name Ahom\", DC Sircar, ''Pragjyotisha-Kamarupa'' in ''The Comprehensive History of Assam'' Vol I (Guwahati, 1991) p59 cf1; Satyendra Nath Sharma, ''Assamese Literature'' (Wiesbaden : Harrassowitz, 1976) p1; \"The term 'Assam' is, relatively speaking, of recent origin and traces back to the tradition of the Ahoms who entered the Brahmaputra valley in the thirteenth century\", Nayanjot Lahir, ''Pre-Ahom Assam'' (Delhi 1991, based on PhD Thesis) p14; \"These references show that the term 'Axom or Asom' was earlier used to mean the Shan community...Subsequently, the term came to be used to mean also the territory they ruled\", M Taher, ''Geography of Assam'' (Delhi, 2001) pp. 2\u20133</ref> the precise origin of the name is not clear.  It was suggested by some that the Sanskrit word ''Asama'' (\"unequalled\", \"peerless\", etc.) was the root, which has been rejected by Kakati,<ref>\"...but most probably ''Asama'' meaning peerless or unequalled is a latter-day Sanskritisation of some earlier form like ''\u0100ch\u0101m'', Banikanta Kakati, ''Early Aspects of Assamese Literature'' (Gauhati, 1953) p. 2</ref> and more recent authors have concurred that it is a latter-day Sanskritization of a native name.<ref>Satyendra Nath Sharma, ''Assamese Literature'' (Wiesbaden : Harrassowitz, 1976) p. 1</ref> Among possible origins are Tai (''A-Cham'')<ref>\"In Tai the root ''cham'' means \"to be undefeated\".

Until the early 1500s, the Ahoms ruled a small kingdom in [[Sibsagar district]] and suddenly expanded during King Suhungmung's rule taking advantage of weakening rule of Chutia and Dimasa kingdoms. By 1681, the whole track down to the border of the modern district of Goalpara came permanently under their sway. Ahoms ruled for nearly 600 years (1228\u20131826 AD) with major expansions in the early 16th century at the cost of [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutia]] and [[Kachari kingdom|Dimasa Kachari]] kingdoms. Since c. the 13th century AD, the nerve centre of Ahom polity was upper Assam; the kingdom was gradually extended to the [[Karatoya River]] in the 17th or 18th century. It was at its zenith during the reign of [[Sukhrungphaa]] or Sworgodeu Rudra Sinha (c. 1696\u20131714 AD).\n\nThe Chutiya rulers (1187\u20131673 AD), a [[Bodo-Kachari people|Bodo-Kachari]] group by origin, held the regions on both the banks of Brahmaputra with its domain in the area eastwards from [[Biswanath Chariali|Vishwanath]] (north bank) and [[Dihing River|Buridihing]] (south bank), in [[Upper Assam]] and in the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. It was partially annexed in the early 1500s by the Ahoms, finally getting absorbed in 1673 AD. The rivalry between the Chutiyas and Ahoms for the supremacy of eastern Assam led to a series of battles between them from the early 16th century until the start of the 17th century, which saw great loss of men and money.\n\nThe Koch, another [[Bodo-Kachari people|Bodo-Kachari]] dynasty, established sovereignty in c. 1510 AD. The Koch kingdom in Western Assam and present-day [[North Bengal]] was at its zenith in the early reign of [[Nara Narayan]] (c. 1540\u20131587 AD). It split into two in c. 1581 CE, the western part as a [[Moghul]] vassal and the eastern as an Ahom satellite state.

Though the [[Mughal empire|Mughals]] made seventeen attempts to invade, they were never successful. The most successful invader [[Mir Jumla II|Mir Jumla]], a governor of [[Aurangzeb]], briefly occupied [[Garhgaon]] (c. 1662\u201363 AD), the then capital, but found it difficult to prevent [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] attacks on his forces, forcing them to leave. The decisive victory of the Assamese led by general [[Lachit Borphukan]] on the Mughals, then under command of Raja Ram Singha, at [[Saraighat]] in 1671 almost ended Mughal ambitions in this region.

As the Brahmaputra flows in Assam the climate here is cold and there is rainfall most of the month. Geomorphic studies conclude that the Brahmaputra, the life-line of Assam, is an antecedent river older than the Himalayas. The river with steep [[Canyon|gorges]] and rapids in Arunachal Pradesh entering Assam, becomes a [[braided river]] (at times 10&nbsp;mi/16&nbsp;km wide) and with tributaries, creates a flood plain (Brahmaputra Valley: 50\u201360&nbsp;mi/80\u2013100&nbsp;km wide, 600&nbsp;mi/1000&nbsp;km long).<ref name=\"RLSinghIndia\">{{Citation\n| first = R.

Although the number of speakers is growing, the percentage of Assam's population who have it as a mother tongue has fallen slightly. The various Bengali dialects and closely related languages are spoken by around 9 million people in Assam, and the portion of the population that speaks these languages has grown slightly. Hindi is the third most-spoken language.\n\nTraditionally, Assamese was the language of the common folk in the ancient [[Kamarupa kingdom]] and in the medieval kingdoms of [[Kachari kingdom|Dimasa Kachari]], [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutiya Kachari]], Borahi Kachari, [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom]] and [[Koch kingdom|Koch Kachari Kingdom of Kamatapur]]. Traces of the language are found in many poems by Luipa, Sarahapa, and others, in [[Charyapada]] (c. 7th\u20138th century AD). Modern dialects such as Kamrupi and [[Goalpariya dialect|Goalpariya]] are remnants of this language. Moreover, Assamese in its traditional form was used by the ethno-cultural groups in the region as lingua-franca, which spread during the stronger kingdoms and was required for economic integration. Localised forms of the language still exist in Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nLinguistically modern Assamese traces its roots to the version developed by the American Missionaries based on the local form used near [[Sivasagar]] (Xiw\u00f4xag\u00f4r) district. Assamese (''\u00d4x\u00f4miya'') is a rich language due to its hybrid nature and unique characteristics of pronunciation and softness. The presence of [[Voiceless velar fricative]] in Assamese makes it a unique among other similar [[Indo-Aryan languages]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Das|first=Ankur|last2=Deka|first2=Tusmita|title=The Allophonic Variation of the Assamese voiceless velar fricative /x/|url=https://www.academia.edu/35777293}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.languagesgulper.com/eng/Assamese.html|title=Assamese|website=www.languagesgulper.com|access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nBodo is an ancient language of Assam. Spatial distribution patterns of the ethno-cultural groups, cultural traits and the phenomenon of naming all the major rivers in the [[North-East India|North East Region]] with Bodo-Kachari words (e.g. [[Dihing]], Dibru, [[Dihong]], D/[[Teesta River|Tista]], and Dikrai) reveal that it was the most important language in ancient times. Bodo is now spoken largely in the Western Assam (BTAD). After years of neglect, now Bodo language is getting attention and its literature is developing. Other native languages of Tibeto-Burman origin and related to Bodo-Kachari are [[Deori language|Deori]], [[Mising language|Mising]], [[Karbi language|Karbi]], [[Rabha language|Rabha]], and [[Tiwa (Lalung)|Tiwa]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThere are approximately 564,000 [[Nepali language|Nepali]] speakers spread all over the state forming about 2.12% of Assam's total population according to 2001 census.\n\nThere are speakers of [[Tai languages]] in Assam.

A renewed Hinduisation in local forms took place, which was initially greatly supported by the Koch and later by the Ahom Kingdoms. The resultant social institutions such as ''[[namghar]]'' and ''[[sattra]]'' (the Vaishnav Monasteries) have become part of the Assamese way of life. The movement contributed greatly towards language, literature, and performing and fine arts.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe modern culture has been influenced by events in the British and the post-British era. The language was standardised by American [[Baptist]] [[Missionary|Missionaries]] such as [[Nathan Brown (missionary)|Nathan Brown]], [[Miles Bronson and the Noctes|Dr. Miles Bronson]] and local pundits such as [[Hemchandra Barua]] with the form available in the [[Sibsagar]] (''Sivasagar'') District (the ex-nerve centre of the Ahom Kingdom).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIncreasing efforts of standardisation in the 20th century alienated the localised forms present in different areas and with the less-assimilated [[Ethnic groups|ethno-cultural groups]] (many source-cultures). However, Assamese culture in its hybrid form and nature is one of the richest, still developing and in true sense is a '[[cultural system]]' with sub-systems. Many source-cultures of the Assamese cultural-system are still surviving either as sub-systems or as sister entities, e.g. the; [[Bodo people|Bodo]] or [[Karbi people|Karbi]] or [[Mising people|Mishing]]. It is important to keep the broader system closer to its roots and at the same time focus on development of the sub-systems.\n\nSome of the common and unique cultural traits in the region are peoples' respect towards [[Betel nut|areca-nut]] and [[betel]] leaves, symbolic ([[gamosa]], arnai, etc.), [[Assam silk|traditional silk]] garments (e.g. [[mekhela chador]], traditional dress of Assamese women) and towards forefathers and elderly.

Various elements are used to represent beliefs, feelings, pride, identity, etc. ''Tamulpan'', ''[[Xorai]]'' and ''Gamosa'' are three important symbolic elements in Assamese culture. ''Tamulpan'' (the areca nut and betel leaves) or ''guapan'' (gua from ''kwa'') are considered along with the Gamosa (a typical woven cotton or silk cloth with embroidery) as the offers of devotion, respect and friendship. The Tamulpan-tradition is an ancient one and is being followed since time-immemorial with roots in the aboriginal Austric culture. ''[[Xorai]]'' is a traditionally manufactured bell-metal article of great respect and is used as a container-medium while performing respectful offers. Moreover, symbolically many ethno-cultural groups use specific clothes to portray respect and pride.\n\nThere were many other symbolic elements and designs, but are now only found in literature, art, sculpture, architecture, etc. or in use today for only religious purposes. The typical designs of ''Assamese-lion'', ''dragon'', and ''flying-lion'' were used for symbolising various purposes and occasions. The archaeological sites such as the Madan Kamdev (c. 9th\u201310th centuries AD) exhibits mass-scale use of lions, dragon-lions and many other figures of demons to show case power and prosperity. The Vaishnava monasteries and many other architectural sites of the late medieval period display the use of lions and dragons for symbolic effects.\n\n=== Festivals and traditions ===\n{{Main|List of festivals in Assam}}\n{{See also|Domahi|Bohag Bihu|Magh Bihu|Bwisagu}}\n[[File:Assamese Jaapi .jpg|thumb|upright|A beautifully adorned [[Jaapi]]]]\n[[File:Bihu dancer with a horn.jpg|thumb|upright|left|<center>A [[Bihu]] dancer blowing a ''[[pepa (musical instrument)|pepa]]'' (horn)</center>]]\n[[File:Ali-ai-ligang.jpg|thumb|''Tribal'' \u2013 Mising girls dancing during Ali Ai Ligang (Spring Festival)]]\nThere are diversified important traditional festivals in Assam. Bihu is the most important and common and celebrated all over Assam. It is the Assamese new year celebrated in April of the Gregorian calendar. [[Christmas]] is observed with great merriment by [[Christians]] of various denominations, including [[Catholics]] and [[Protestants]], throughout Assam. [[Durga Puja]], a festival introduced and popularised by [[Bengalis]], is widely celebrated across the state. Muslims celebrate two Eids ([[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid al-Adha]]) with much eagerness all over Assam.[[File:Sattriya by Dancer Meenakshi Medhi.JPG|thumb|[[Sattriya|Sattriya Dance]] ]]\n\n[[Bihu]] is a series of three prominent festivals. Primarily a non-religious festival celebrated to mark the seasons and the significant points of a cultivator's life over a yearly cycle. Three Bihus, ''rongali'' or ''bohag'', celebrated with the coming of spring and the beginning of the sowing season; ''kongali'' or ''kati'', the barren bihu when the fields are lush but the barns are empty; and the ''[[Bhogali Bihu|bhogali]]'' or ''magh'', the thanksgiving when the crops have been harvested and the barns are full. Bihu songs and Bihu dance are associated to ''rongali'' bihu. The day before the each bihu is known as 'uruka'. The first day of 'rongali bihu' is called 'Goru bihu' (the bihu of the cows), when the cows are taken to the nearby rivers or ponds to be bathed with special care. In recent times the form and nature of celebration has changed with the growth of urban centres.\n\n[[Bwisagu]] is one of the popular seasonal festivals of the [[Bodo people|Bodos]]. Bwisagu start of the new year or age. Baisagu is a Boro word which originated from the word \"Baisa\" which means year or age, ang \"Agu\" that means starting or start.\n\nBeshoma is a festival of Deshi people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nenow.in/north-east-news/bihu-myriad-colours.html|title=Bihu \u2013 Its Myriad Colours|website=NORTHEAST NOW|language=en-US|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref> It is a celebration of sowing crop. The Beshoma starts on the last day of Chaitra and goes on till the sixth of Baisakh.

This festival is celebrated during the end of January. Officially 27 January has been declared as the day of Bushu Dima festival. The Dimasa people celebrate their festival by playing musical instruments- khram (a type of drum), muri (a kind of huge long flute). The people dances to the different tunes called \"murithai\" and each dance has got its name, the prominent being the \"Baidima\" There are three types of Bushu celebrated among the Dimasas Jidap, Surem and Hangsou.\n\nChavang Kut is a post harvesting festival of the [[Kuki people|Kuki]] people. The festival is celebrated on the first day of November every year. Hence, this particular day has been officially declared as a Restricted Holiday by the Assam government. In the past, the celebration was primarily important in the religio-cultural sense. The rhythmic movements of the dances in the festival were inspired by animals, agricultural techniques and showed their relationship with ecology. Today, the celebration witnesses the shifting of stages and is revamped to suit new contexts and interpretations. The traditional dances which form the core of the festival is now performed in out-of-village settings and are staged in a secular public sphere. In Assam, the Kukis mainly reside in the two autonomous districts of Dima Hasao and Karbi Anglong.\n\nMoreover, there are other important traditional festivals being celebrated every year on different occasions at different places. Many of these are celebrated by different ethno-cultural groups (sub and sister cultures).
