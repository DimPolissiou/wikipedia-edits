In 1974, P&O purchased them for their Princess division, and they served as ''[[MV Discovery|Island Princess]]'' and ''[[MS Pacific|Pacific Princess]]'' respectively.\n\nA part-time addition to the Princess fleet was the former Swedish transatlantic liner ''Kungsholm'', purchased by P&O from Flagship Cruises in 1978, and then restyled and rebuilt in Bremen as ''[[MS Veronica|Sea Princess]]''. She was initially based in [[Australia]] as a P&O ship until 1981 when her role there was taken over by [[SS Oriana (1959)|''Oriana'']]. After that, she alternated between P&O and Princess colours as she moved between fleets. ''Sea Princess'' returned to the P&O UK fleet permanently and in 1995 and was renamed MV ''Victoria'' to allow a then-new Princess ship to be named ''[[Sea Princess]]''.\n\nIn 1981, Princess began calling at the cruise line's first private Caribbean destination, [[Palm Island, Grenadines|Palm Island]] in the [[Grenadines]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe first P&O Princess Cruises purpose-built cruise ship was ''Royal Princess'' in 1984, the largest new British passenger ship in a decade, and one of the first, if not the first, ships to completely dispense with interior cabins.<ref name=\":5\" /> The ship served in [[P&O Cruises]] fleet as ''[[MV Artania|Artemis]]'' until 2011.\n\nIn 1986, P&O Princess Cruises acquired Tour Alaska, which operated on the [[Alaska Railroad]].

(A Club newsletter, also including song transcriptions, etc., had already started in 1955). While Meredith and his colleagues had [[Australian Communist Party]] affiliations, in reality this manifested itself as a general predisposition to sympathy to the concerns of the Australian working class and not to specific furtherance of official Communist Party objectives, although the American folklorist [[John Greenway (folklorist)|John Greenway]], reviewing \"Singabout\" in 1958, lamented that \"folksong collecting and publishing [in Australia] today is in the hands of the Communists\".<ref name = \"Greenway_1958\">Greenway, John. 1958. \"Folklore in Australia: Speewa (etc.).\" ''The Journal of American Folklore'', 71: 183-185. {{doi|10.2307/537710}}</ref>{{efn|Such a connection was not, of course, without precedent: both the British [[Workers' Music Association]] and the U.S. [[People's Songs]] had similar interests, that is, the overt use of songs as a vehicle for social change, allied strongly with the labour movement.}} Meredith's involvement as an office bearer with the club lasted until at least 1968, where he is listed as assistant editor, having previously been president for 1961 and vice president for 1966.<ref name = \"bushmusicblog_2018_10\" />\n\nLife members included the Australian traditional singers [[Sally Sloane]] and [[Duke Tritton]]; the latter assisted Meredith with his song collecting and also served as club vice president for several terms. Other persons awarded life membership included founder members and original Bushwhackers John Meredith, Jack Barrie, Alan Scott, Brian Loughlin and Harry Kay, resident topical/humorous songwriter [[John Dengate]], and more (refer board illustrated at right).\n\nA selection of performers from the Club, including Meredith and several other of the original Bushwhackers in the early years, performed at festivals and public gatherings as the \"Bush Music Club Concert Party\" and made a number of appearances on record between the mid 1950s and 1960s (see \"Recordings\" section); for David Jones \"Wool Week\" in 1959 they also appeared as \"The Shearer's Band\". Members of these bands, who tended to vary, were amateur performers who performed for the love of the music, with proceeds of performances going back to support the Club and its other activities. From the 1970s and onwards, many performers who had received their \"apprenticeships\" with the Concert Party went on to form bands of their own, examples being \"The Rouseabouts\", \"Ryebuck\", \"Pinchgut\", \"Selectors\", \"Southern Cross\", \"Sydney Coves\", \"Currawong\" and \"Barangaroo\".<ref name= \"bmc_concertparty\">Bush Music Club Inc.: [https://www.bushmusic.org.au/bmc_concertparty.shtml Concert Party]</ref>\n\nThe Club rode out the downturn in popular interest in folk music in the 1980s and 1990s; a 1987 review noted that the Club at that time had over 400 members.<ref name = \"Folklife_1997\">Anderson, Hugh, et al., 1987.

We will provide the words and music of our songs and show you how we sing them.\n\nThe inaugural meeting and first rehearsal of the BUSH MUSIC CLUB will take place at the Realist Theatrette, 1st Floor, 188 George Street, on Thursday October 14th, at 7 p.m. sharp.\n\nFurther details may be had from John Meredith, 5 Henry Street, Lewisham, or from any of the \"Bushwhackers\".<ref>Reproduced at [https://blog.bushmusic.org.au/2017/01/minutes-of-bush-music-club-14th-october.html https://blog.bushmusic.org.au/2017/01/minutes-of-bush-music-club-14th-october.html]</ref></blockquote>\n\nInitial office bearers (all members of the original Bushwhackers band) were Brian Loughlin as chair,  Alan Scott as secretary/treasurer, Harry Kay as master of ceremonies and Meredith as \"publicity officer\" and future editor of the club's planned publications.<ref name = \"bushmusicblog_2018_10\">Bush Music Club: [https://blog.bushmusic.org.au/2018/10/history-of-bush-music-club-committee.html History of the Bush Music Club - The Committee, the first 25 years.]</ref>\n\n[[File:BMC-alex-nov14-detail.jpg|thumb|List of Life Members of the Bush Music Club as at 2014 (detail of Alex Hood photograph above)]]\nWith Meredith's interest in collecting Australian folksongs, the club's journal \"Singabout\" was started in 1956 as a route to publish and promote a selection of these songs for singing by others, in addition to being an outlet for newly composed songs on Australian themes. (A Club newsletter, also including song transcriptions, etc., had already started in 1955). While Meredith and his colleagues had [[Australian Communist Party]] affiliations, in reality this manifested itself as a general predisposition to sympathy to the concerns of the Australian working class and not to specific furtherance of official Communist Party objectives, although the American folklorist [[John Greenway (folklorist)|John Greenway]], reviewing \"Singabout\" in 1958, lamented that \"folksong collecting and publishing [in Australia] today is in the hands of the Communists\".<ref name = \"Greenway_1958\">Greenway, John. 1958. \"Folklore in Australia: Speewa (etc.).\" ''The Journal of American Folklore'', 71: 183-185. {{doi|10.2307/537710}}</ref>{{efn|Such a connection was not, of course, without precedent: both the British [[Workers' Music Association]] and the U.S. [[People's Songs]] had similar interests, that is, the overt use of songs as a vehicle for social change, allied strongly with the labour movement.}} Meredith's involvement as an office bearer with the club lasted until at least 1968, where he is listed as assistant editor, having previously been president for 1961 and vice president for 1966.<ref name = \"bushmusicblog_2018_10\" />\n\nLife members included the Australian traditional singers [[Sally Sloane]] and [[Duke Tritton]]; the latter assisted Meredith with his song collecting and also served as club vice president for several terms. Other persons awarded life membership included founder members and original Bushwhackers John Meredith, Jack Barrie, Alan Scott, Brian Loughlin and Harry Kay, resident topical/humorous songwriter [[John Dengate]], and more (refer board illustrated at right).\n\nA selection of performers from the Club, including Meredith and several other of the original Bushwhackers in the early years, performed at festivals and public gatherings as the \"Bush Music Club Concert Party\" and made a number of appearances on record between the mid 1950s and 1960s (see \"Recordings\" section); for David Jones \"Wool Week\" in 1959 they also appeared as \"The Shearer's Band\". Members of these bands, who tended to vary, were amateur performers who performed for the love of the music, with proceeds of performances going back to support the Club and its other activities. From the 1970s and onwards, many performers who had received their \"apprenticeships\" with the Concert Party went on to form bands of their own, examples being \"The Rouseabouts\", \"Ryebuck\", \"Pinchgut\", \"Selectors\", \"Southern Cross\", \"Sydney Coves\", \"Currawong\" and \"Barangaroo\".<ref name= \"bmc_concertparty\">Bush Music Club Inc.: [https://www.bushmusic.org.au/bmc_concertparty.shtml Concert Party]</ref>\n\nThe Club rode out the downturn in popular interest in folk music in the 1980s and 1990s; a 1987 review noted that the Club at that time had over 400 members.<ref name = \"Folklife_1997\">Anderson, Hugh, et al., 1987.
