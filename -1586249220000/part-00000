The condition may also make [[sexual intercourse]] painful and/or difficult, though it is unclear whether some men report satisfactory or unsatisfactory intercourse in spite of the disorder.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} It can affect men of any race and age. The disorder is confined to the penis, although a substantial number of men with Peyronie's exhibit concurrent [[connective tissue disorders]] in the hand, and to a lesser degree, in the feet. About 30 percent of men with Peyronie's disease develop [[fibrosis]] in other elastic tissues of the body, such as on the hand or foot, including [[Dupuytren's contracture]] of the hand.

Due to associated calcifications, the imaging of patients with Peyronie's disease shows acoustic shadowing, as illustrated in figures below. Less common findings, attributed to earlier stages of the disease (still mild fibrosis), are hypoechoic lesions with focal thickening of the paracavernous tissues, echoic focal thickening of the tunica without posterior acoustic shadowing, retractile isoechoic lesions with posterior attenuation of the beam, and focal loss of the continuity of the tunica albuginea.. In the Doppler study, increased flow around the plaques can suggest inflammatory activity and the absence of flow can suggest disease stability. Ultrasound is useful for the identification of lesions and to determine their relationship with the neurovascular bundle. Individuals with Peyronie's disease can present with erectile dysfunction, often related to venous leakage, due to insufficient drainage at the site of the plaque. Although plaques are more common on the dorsum of the penis, they can also be seen on the ventral face, lateral face, or septum.<ref name=\"FernandesSouza2018\">Originally copied from:<br>{{cite journal|last1=Fernandes|first1=Mait\u00ea Aline Vieira|last2=Souza|first2=Luis Ronan Marquez Ferreira de|last3=Cartafina|first3=Luciano Pousa|title=Ultrasound evaluation of the penis|journal=Radiologia Brasileira|volume=51|issue=4|year=2018|pages=257\u2013261|issn=1678-7099|doi=10.1590/0100-3984.2016.0152|pmid=30202130|pmc=6124582}}<br>[[Creative Commons|CC-BY]] license</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Ultrasonography of orpus cavernosum calcification.jpg|Transverse ultrasound of the penis, in a ventral view, in the middle portion of the penis.

The condition may also make [[sexual intercourse]] painful and/or difficult, though it is unclear whether some men report satisfactory or unsatisfactory intercourse in spite of the disorder.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} It can affect men of any race and age. The disorder is confined to the penis, although a substantial number of men with Peyronie's exhibit concurrent [[connective tissue disorders]] in the hand, and to a lesser degree, in the feet. About 30 percent of men with Peyronie's disease develop [[fibrosis]] in other elastic tissues of the body, such as on the hand or foot, including [[Dupuytren's contracture]] of the hand. An increased incidence in genetically related males suggests a genetic component.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Carrieri MP, Serraino D, Palmiotto F, Nucci G, Sasso F |title=A case-control study on risk factors for Peyronie's disease |journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=511\u20135 |date=June 1998  |pmid=9636000 |doi=10.1016/S0895-4356(98)00015-8}}</ref>\n===Psychosocial===\nPeyronie's disease can also have psychological effects.

Due to associated calcifications, the imaging of patients with Peyronie's disease shows acoustic shadowing, as illustrated in figures below. Less common findings, attributed to earlier stages of the disease (still mild fibrosis), are hypoechoic lesions with focal thickening of the paracavernous tissues, echoic focal thickening of the tunica without posterior acoustic shadowing, retractile isoechoic lesions with posterior attenuation of the beam, and focal loss of the continuity of the tunica albuginea.. In the Doppler study, increased flow around the plaques can suggest inflammatory activity and the absence of flow can suggest disease stability. Ultrasound is useful for the identification of lesions and to determine their relationship with the neurovascular bundle. Individuals with Peyronie's disease can present with erectile dysfunction, often related to venous leakage, due to insufficient drainage at the site of the plaque. Although plaques are more common on the dorsum of the penis, they can also be seen on the ventral face, lateral face, or septum.<ref name=\"FernandesSouza2018\">Originally copied from:<br>{{cite journal|last1=Fernandes|first1=Mait\u00ea Aline Vieira|last2=Souza|first2=Luis Ronan Marquez Ferreira de|last3=Cartafina|first3=Luciano Pousa|title=Ultrasound evaluation of the penis|journal=Radiologia Brasileira|volume=51|issue=4|year=2018|pages=257\u2013261|issn=1678-7099|doi=10.1590/0100-3984.2016.0152|pmid=30202130|pmc=6124582}}<br>[[Creative Commons|CC-BY]] license</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Ultrasonography of orpus cavernosum calcification.jpg|Transverse ultrasound of the penis, in a ventral view, in the middle portion of the penis.

However, the Dash closed sections to seat only 7,000 spectators per game in 2014, and in 2015, the Breakers moved to the smaller [[Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium]] (now named Jordan Field). This made the 21,144-capacity Providence Park the largest stadium by NWSL-specific capacity until the opening of 25,500-capacity [[Orlando City Stadium]] in 2017.

However, the Dash closed sections to seat only 7,000 spectators per game in 2014, and in 2015, the Breakers moved to the smaller [[Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium]] (now named Jordan Field). This made the 21,144-capacity Providence Park the largest stadium by NWSL-specific capacity until the opening of 25,500-capacity [[Orlando City Stadium]] in 2017.
