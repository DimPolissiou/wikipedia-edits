Recorded at [[EastWest Studios]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]] with co-producer [[Greg Fidelman]] (who previously produced the band's 2014 album ''[[.5: The Gray Chapter]]''), it was released on August 9, 2019 by [[Roadrunner Records]]. The title is taken from a lyric in the song \"[[All Out Life]]\", which was released as a standalone single in 2018 and features as a bonus track on the Japanese edition of the album. ''We Are Not Your Kind'' is the first Slipknot album to be recorded as an eight-member band, as their former percussionist [[Chris Fehn]] departed the band in March 2019 after suing the group for alleged unpaid royalties. \n\nAfter the conclusion of the touring cycle for ''.5: The Gray Chapter'', Slipknot guitarist [[Jim Root]] and percussionist [[Shawn Crahan|Shawn \"Clown\" Crahan]] began writing and demoing material for the band's follow-up album in early 2017. According to Crahan, the group wrote and recorded a total of 22 songs and 26 interludes, with the plan initially being to produce the band's first [[double album]]. Recording began in November 2018, shortly after the release of the standalone single \"[[All Out Life]]\". The album was completed by April 2019 and \"[[Unsainted]]\" was released as the lead single the next month. This was followed by \"[[Solway Firth (song)|Solway Firth]]\" in July, \"[[Birth of the Cruel]]\" in August and \"[[Nero Forte]]\" in December.\n\n''We Are Not Your Kind'' received critical acclaim; numerous commentators hailed the album as one of the best releases of Slipknot's career, praising the level of experimentation displayed on several key songs. Others highlighted it as a modern landmark release in the heavy metal genre. \"Unsainted\" reached number 10 on the US ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] chart, while \"Solway Firth\" also reached the [[UK Rock & Metal Singles and Albums Charts|UK Rock & Metal Singles Chart]] top ten. ''We Are Not Your Kind'' debuted at number 1 on both the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and the [[UK Albums Chart]], as well as several other charts around the world.\n\n==Background and writing==\nWork on Slipknot's sixth studio album began in February 2017, when the band's guitarist [[Jim Root]] and percussionist [[Shawn Crahan|Shawn \"Clown\" Crahan]] started writing new material together. Speaking to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in November 2016, Crahan simply stated that \"we want to write\", but that a recording timeline would remain unconfirmed for the time being.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/slipknots-shawn-clown-crahan-on-bloody-directorial-debut-126375/ |title=Slipknot's Shawn 'Clown' Crahan on Bloody Directorial Debut |last=Grow |first=Kory |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=November 22, 2016 |accessdate=August 14, 2019 }}</ref> He later elaborated on this plan by claiming that the group's members wanted to take their time working on new songs, rather than producing it within a set timeframe as they had done before.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metalinsider.net/interviews/shawn-clown-crahan-talks-officer-downe-next-slipknot-album |title=Shawn \"Clown\" Crahan talks 'Officer Downe,' next Slipknot album |last=Teitelman |first=Bram |work=Metal Insider |date=November 23, 2016 |accessdate=August 14, 2019 }}</ref> Plans for the direction of the album had been touted by the percussionist as early as the summer of 2015, when he claimed that he wanted to write an \"[[Concept album|art record]]\" in the vein of ''[[The Wall]]'' by [[Pink Floyd]] or ''[[Sgt.

Recorded at [[EastWest Studios]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]] with co-producer [[Greg Fidelman]] (who previously produced the band's 2014 album ''[[.5: The Gray Chapter]]''), it was released on August 9, 2019 by [[Roadrunner Records]]. The title is taken from a lyric in the song \"[[All Out Life]]\", which was released as a standalone single in 2018 and features as a bonus track on the Japanese edition of the album. ''We Are Not Your Kind'' is the first Slipknot album to be recorded as an eight-member band, as their former percussionist [[Chris Fehn]] departed the band in March 2019 after suing the group for alleged unpaid royalties. \n\nAfter the conclusion of the touring cycle for ''.5: The Gray Chapter'', Slipknot guitarist [[Jim Root]] and percussionist [[Shawn Crahan|Shawn \"Clown\" Crahan]] began writing and demoing material for the band's follow-up album in early 2017. According to Crahan, the group wrote and recorded a total of 22 songs and 26 interludes, with the plan initially being to produce the band's first [[double album]]. Recording began in November 2018, shortly after the release of the standalone single \"[[All Out Life]]\". The album was completed by April 2019 and \"[[Unsainted]]\" was released as the lead single the next month. This was followed by \"[[Solway Firth (song)|Solway Firth]]\" in July, \"[[Birth of the Cruel]]\" in August and \"[[Nero Forte]]\" in December.\n\n''We Are Not Your Kind'' received critical acclaim; numerous commentators hailed the album as one of the best releases of Slipknot's career, praising the level of experimentation displayed on several key songs. Others highlighted it as a modern landmark release in the heavy metal genre. \"Unsainted\" reached number 10 on the US ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] chart, while \"Solway Firth\" also reached the [[UK Rock & Metal Singles and Albums Charts|UK Rock & Metal Singles Chart]] top ten. ''We Are Not Your Kind'' debuted at number 1 on both the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and the [[UK Albums Chart]], as well as several other charts around the world.\n\n==Background and writing==\nWork on Slipknot's sixth studio album began in February 2017, when the band's guitarist [[Jim Root]] and percussionist [[Shawn Crahan|Shawn \"Clown\" Crahan]] started writing new material together. Speaking to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in November 2016, Crahan simply stated that \"we want to write\", but that a recording timeline would remain unconfirmed for the time being.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/slipknots-shawn-clown-crahan-on-bloody-directorial-debut-126375/ |title=Slipknot's Shawn 'Clown' Crahan on Bloody Directorial Debut |last=Grow |first=Kory |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=November 22, 2016 |accessdate=August 14, 2019 }}</ref> He later elaborated on this plan by claiming that the group's members wanted to take their time working on new songs, rather than producing it within a set timeframe as they had done before.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metalinsider.net/interviews/shawn-clown-crahan-talks-officer-downe-next-slipknot-album |title=Shawn \"Clown\" Crahan talks 'Officer Downe,' next Slipknot album |last=Teitelman |first=Bram |work=Metal Insider |date=November 23, 2016 |accessdate=August 14, 2019 }}</ref> Plans for the direction of the album had been touted by the percussionist as early as the summer of 2015, when he claimed that he wanted to write an \"[[Concept album|art record]]\" in the vein of ''[[The Wall]]'' by [[Pink Floyd]] or ''[[Sgt.

It was envisioned by [[Satish Ranjan Das]], a [[Kolkata]] lawyer, who prevised a school modelled on the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], but conscious of Indian ambitions and desires. Although he died in 1928, he is considered the founder of the school. The school's first [[Head teacher|headmaster]] was [[Arthur Foot|Arthur E.

He was the fourth British headmaster in Doon's history and a member of [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]], [[UK]].\n\nThe school houses roughly 500 pupils aged 12 to 18, and admission is based on a competitive entrance examination, a group discussion and an interview with the headmaster. Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can choose between [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum. Doon remains a boys-only school despite continued pressure from political leaders, including former [[President of India|President]] [[Pratibha Patil]], to become [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]]. [[Old boy network|Old boys]] of the school are known as 'Doscos'. \n\nDoon has been consistently ranked the best all-boys residential school in [[India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/state-editions/17-schools-from-u---khand-secure-top-10-positions-in-ewisr.html|title=17 schools from U\u2019khand secure Top 10 positions in EWISR|first=The|last=Pioneer|website=The Pioneer}}</ref> Although the school has often been cited as 'Eton of India' by media outlets such as the [[BBC]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02c3zgq|title=BBC World Service - Witness, India's Eton|website=BBC}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'',<ref>{{cite news|author=STEVEN R.

He was the fourth British headmaster in Doon's history and a member of [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]], [[UK]].\n\nThe school houses roughly 500 pupils aged 12 to 18, and admission is based on a competitive entrance examination, a group discussion and an interview with the headmaster. Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can choose between [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum. Doon remains a boys-only school despite continued pressure from political leaders, including former [[President of India|President]] [[Pratibha Patil]], to become [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]]. [[Old boy network|Old boys]] of the school are known as 'Doscos'. \n\nDoon has been consistently ranked the best all-boys residential school in [[India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/state-editions/17-schools-from-u---khand-secure-top-10-positions-in-ewisr.html|title=17 schools from U\u2019khand secure Top 10 positions in EWISR|first=The|last=Pioneer|website=The Pioneer}}</ref> Although the school has often been cited as 'Eton of India' by media outlets such as the [[BBC]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02c3zgq|title=BBC World Service - Witness, India's Eton|website=BBC}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'',<ref>{{cite news|author=STEVEN R.

{"title_page": "Non-linear editing system", "text_new": "{{short description|Form of audio, video, or image editing}}\n\n[[File:Videowisconsinstudio.tif|thumb|alt=An example of a video editing studio|Example of a non-linear video editing studio ]]\n\n'''Non-linear editing''' is a form of [[offline editing]] for [[Audio editing|audio]], [[Video editing|video]], and [[image editing]]. In offline editing, the original content is not modified in the course of editing. In non-linear editing, edits are specified and modified by specialized software. A pointer-based playlist, effectively an [[edit decision list]] (EDL), for video or a [[directed acyclic graph]] for still images is used to keep track of edits. Each time the edited audio, video, or image is rendered, played back, or accessed, it is reconstructed from the original source and the specified editing steps.  Although this process is more computationally intensive than directly modifying the original content, changing the edits themselves can be almost instantaneous, and it prevents further [[generation loss]] as the audio, video, or image is edited.\n\nA '''non-linear editing system''' ('''NLE''') is a video (NLVE) or audio editing (NLAE) [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) system that performs non-destructive editing on source material.  The name is in contrast to 20th century methods of [[linear video editing]] and [[film editing]].\n\n== Basic techniques ==\nA non-linear editing approach may be used when all assets are available as files on [[video server]]s or [[hard disk]]s, rather than recordings on reels or tapes. While linear editing is tied to the need to sequentially view film or hear tape, non-linear editing enables direct access to any [[video frame]] in a digital [[video clip]], without having to play or [[Scrubbing (audio)|scrub/shuttle]] through adjacent [[footage]] to reach it, as is necessary with [[video tape]] linear editing systems.\n\nWhen ingesting audio or video feeds, [[metadata]] are attached to the clip. Those metadata can be attached automatically ([[timecode]], localization, take number, name of the clip) or manually (players names, characters, in sports: [[red card (sports)|red card]], goal...). It is then possible to access any frame by entering directly the timecode or the descriptive metadata. An editor can, for example at the end of the day in the [[Olympic Games]], easily retrieve all the clips related to the players who received a gold medal.\n\nThe non-linear editing method is similar in concept to the [[Cut, copy, and paste|cut and paste]] techniques used in [[Information technology|IT]]. However, with the use of non-linear editing systems, the destructive act of cutting of film negatives is eliminated. It can also be viewed as the audio/video equivalent of [[word processing]], which is why it is called [[desktop video]] editing in the consumer space.<ref>{{cite book|author=Evans, Russell|title=Practical DV Filmmaking|publisher=Focal Press|date=2005|isbn=0-240-80738-3|page=14}}</ref>\n\n== Broadcast workflows and advantages ==\nIn [[broadcasting]] applications, video and audio data are first captured to hard disk-based systems or other digital storage devices.  The data are then imported into servers employing any necessary [[transcoding]], [[digitizing]] or [[Transfer (computing)|transfer]]). Once imported, the source material can be edited on a computer using any of a wide range of [[video editing software]].\n\nEditing software records the editor's decisions in an [[edit decision list]] (EDL) that is exportable to other editing tools. Many generations and variations of the EDL can exist without storing many different copies, allowing for very flexible editing.  It also makes it easy to change cuts and undo previous decisions simply by editing the EDL (without having to have the actual film data duplicated). [[Generation loss]] is also controlled, due to not having to repeatedly re-encode the data when different effects are applied.\n\nCompared to the linear method of tape-to-tape editing, non-linear editing offers the flexibility of film editing, with random access and easy project organization. In non-linear editing, the original source files are not lost or modified during editing. This is one of the biggest advantages of non-linear editing compared to linear editing. With the EDLs, the editor can work on low-resolution copies of the video. This makes it possible to edit both standard-definition broadcast quality and [[High-definition video|high definition]] broadcast quality very quickly on desktop computers that may not have the power to process huge full-quality high-resolution data in real-time.\n\nThe costs of editing systems have dropped such that non-linear editing tools are now within the reach of home users. Some editing software can now be accessed free as [[web application]]s; some, like [[Cinelerra]] (focused on the professional market) and [[Blender (software)|Blender]], can be downloaded as [[free software]]; and some, like [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Movie Maker]] or [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iMovie]], come included with the appropriate operating system.\n\n== Accessing the material ==\nThe non-linear editing retrieves video media for editing. Because these media exist on the video server or other mass storage that stores the video feeds in a given [[codec]], the editing system can use several methods to access the material:\n\n;Direct access\n:The video server records feeds with a codec readable by the editing system, has network connection to the editor and allows direct editing. The editor previews material directly on the server (which it sees as remote storage) and edits directly on the server without [[transcoding]] or [[Transfer (computing)|transfer]].\n;[[Shared resource|Shared storage]]\n:The video server transfers feeds to and from shared storage that is accessible by all editors. Media in the appropriate codec on the server need only transferred. If recorded with a different codec, media must be transcoded during transfer. In some cases (depending on material), files on shared storage can be edited even before the transfer is finished.\n;Importing\n:The editor downloads the material and edits it locally. This method can be used with the previous methods.\n\n== Editor brands ==\n{{multiple image\n | header            = Blackmagic DaVinci Resolve non-linear editing system panel\n | image1            =\n | caption1          = Screenshot\n | image2            = Da Vinci Impresario.jpg\n | caption2          = Advanced panel, with 4 trackballs and rotating rings, designed for color grading\n}}\nAs of January 2019 due to fetures and relaiblity, [[DaVinci Resolve|Davinci Resolve]] had a user base of more than 2 million using the free version alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/small-business/the-aussie-tech-company-behind-the-oscar-nominees-20190124-p50tg1.html|title=The Aussie tech company behind the Oscar nominees|last=Waters|first=Cara|date=2019-01-27|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2019-09-21}}</ref> This is a comparable user base to [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[Final Cut Pro X]], which also had 2 million users as of April 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsshooter.com/2018/06/21/the-seven-year-itch-fcpx-zero-to-hero/|title=The Seven Year Itch \u2013 FCP X, Zero to Hero?|date=2018-06-20|website=Newsshooter|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-21}}</ref>.

Various editing tasks could then be performed on the imported video before export to another [[Recording medium|medium]], or [[MPEG]] [[Code|encode]]d for transfer to a [[DVD]].\n\nModern web-based editing systems can take video directly from a camera phone over a [[GPRS]] or [[3G]] mobile connection, and editing can take place through a web browser interface, so, strictly speaking, a computer for video editing does not require any installed hardware or software beyond a [[web browser]] and an [[internet]] connection.\n\n== History ==\n{{cleanup rewrite|section|date=May 2012}}\n\nWhen [[videotape]]s were first developed in the 1950s, the only way to edit was to physically cut the tape with a razor blade and splice segments together.  While the footage excised in this process was not technically destroyed, continuity was lost and the footage was generally discarded. In 1963, with the introduction of the [[Ampex]] Editec, video tape could be edited electronically with a process known as [[linear video editing]] by selectively copying the original footage to another tape called a ''master''.  The original recordings are not destroyed or altered in this process. However since the final product is a copy of the original, there is a generation loss of quality.\n\n=== First non-linear editor ===\nThe first truly non-linear editor, the [[CMX 600]], was introduced in 1971 by [[CMX Systems]], a joint venture between [[CBS]] and [[Memorex]].<ref>{{citation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410092334/http://sundialmedia.com/sait/articles/found_a/heat_f.htm |archive-date=2013-04-10 |url=http://sundialmedia.com/sait/articles/found_a/heat_f.htm |title=The History of Digital Nonlinear Editing |work=Facer Ezine}}</ref><ref>{{citation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021231834/http://nonlinear.info/N4.history.pdf |archive-date=2007-10-21 |url=http://nonlinear.info/N4.history.pdf |title=A Brief History Of Electronic Editing |work=Non Linear}}</ref>  It recorded and played back black-and-white analog video recorded in \"[[skip-field]]\" mode on modified [[disk pack]] drives the size of washing machines.  These were commonly used to store about half an hour of data digitally on mainframe computers of the time.  The 600 had a console with two monitors built in.  The right monitor, which played the preview video, was used by the editor to make cuts and edit decisions using a [[light pen]].  The editor selected from options superimposed as text over the preview video. The left monitor was used to display the edited video.  A DEC [[PDP-11]] computer served as a controller for the whole system.  Because the video edited on the 600 was in low-resolution black and white, the 600 was suitable only for offline editing.\n\n=== The 1980s ===\nNon-linear editing systems were built in the 1980s using computers coordinating multiple [[LaserDisc]]s or banks of VCRs.  One example of these tape and disc-based systems was Lucasfilm's [[EditDroid]], which used several LaserDiscs of the same raw footage to simulate random-access editing.{{efn|A compatible system called [[SoundDroid]] was developed for sound post-production.

Ediflex was introduced in 1983 on the Universal series \"[[Still the Beaver]]\". By 1985 it was used on over 80% of filmed network programs.

A custom circuit board was added to each deck that enabled frame-accurate switching and playback using vertical interval timecode. Intelligent positioning and sequencing of the source decks provided a simulation of random-access playback of a lengthy edited sequence without any rerecording. The theory was that with so many copies of the rushes, there could always be one machine cued up to replay the next shot in real time. Changing the EDL could be done easily, and the results seen immediately.\n\nThe first feature edited on the Montage was Sidney Lumet's ''[[Power (1986 film)|Power]]''.  Notably, Francis Coppola edited ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' on the system, and Stanley Kubrick used it for ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]''.  It was used on several episodic TV shows (''[[Knots Landing]]'', for one) and on hundreds of commercials and music videos.\n\nThe original Montage system won an Academy Award for Technical Achievement in 1988.{{cn|reason=Doesn't appear in list at [[Academy Scientific and Technical Award]]|date=September 2019}} Montage was reincarnated as Montage II in 1987, and Montage III appeared at NAB in 1991, using digital disk technology, which should prove to be considerably less cumbersome than the Betamax system.\n\nAll of these original systems were slow, cumbersome, and had problems with the limited computer horsepower of the time, but the mid-to-late-1980s saw a trend towards non-linear editing, moving away from film editing on [[Moviola]]s and the linear videotape method using [[U-matic]] VCRs. Computer processing advanced sufficiently by the end of the '80s to enable true digital imagery, and has progressed today to provide this capability in personal desktop computers. \n\nAn example of computing power progressing to make non-linear editing possible was demonstrated in the first all-digital non-linear editing system, the \"Harry\" effects compositing system manufactured by [[Quantel]] in 1985.  Although it was more of a video effects system, it had some non-linear editing capabilities. Most importantly, it could record (and apply effects to) 80 seconds (due to hard disk space limitations) of broadcast-quality uncompressed digital video encoded in 8-bit [[CCIR 601]] format on its built-in hard disk array.\n\n=== The 1990s ===\nThe term ''nonlinear editing'' was formalized in 1991 with the publication of Michael Rubin's ''Nonlinear: A Guide to Digital Film and Video Editing'' (Triad, 1991)\u2014which popularized this terminology over other language common at the time, including ''real time'' editing, ''random-access'' or ''RA'' editing, ''virtual'' editing, ''electronic film'' editing, and so on.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nNon-linear editing with computers as it is known today was first introduced by [[Editing Machines Corp.]] in 1989 with the EMC2 editor, a PC-based non-linear off-line editing system that utilized magneto-optical disks for storage and playback of video, using half-screen-resolution video at 15 frames per second. A couple of weeks later that same year, [[Avid Technology|Avid]] introduced the Avid/1, the first in the line of their [[Media Composer]] systems. It was based on the [[Apple Macintosh]] computer platform ([[Macintosh II]] systems were used) with special hardware and software developed and installed by Avid.\n\nThe video quality of the Avid/1 (and later [[Media Composer]] systems from the late 1980s) was somewhat low (about VHS quality), due to the use of a very early version of a [[Motion JPEG]] (M-JPEG) [[codec]].  It was sufficient, however, to provide a versatile system for offline editing.  ''[[Lost in Yonkers (film)|Lost in Yonkers]]'' (1993) was the first film edited with Avid Media Composer, and the first long-form documentary so edited was the HBO program ''Earth and the American Dream'', which won a National Primetime Emmy Award for Editing in 1993.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\nThe [[NewTek]] [[Video Toaster#Video Toaster Flyer|Video Toaster Flyer]] for the [[Amiga]] included non-linear editing capabilities in addition to processing live video signals.  The Flyer used [[hard drive]]s to store video clips and audio, and supported complex scripted playback. The Flyer provided simultaneous dual-channel playback, which let the Toaster's [[Video switcher]] perform transitions and other effects on [[Video clip]]s without additional [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]].  The Flyer portion of the Video Toaster/Flyer combination was a complete computer of its own, having its own [[microprocessor]] and [[embedded software]]. Its hardware included three embedded [[SCSI]] controllers. Two of these SCSI buses were used to store video data, and the third to store audio.  The Flyer used a proprietary [[Wavelet compression]] algorithm known as [[VTASC]], which was well regarded at the time for offering better visual quality than comparable [[Motion JPEG]] based non-linear editing systems.\n\nUntil 1993, the Avid Media Composer was most often used for editing commercials or other small content/high value projects. This was primarily because the purchase cost of the system was very high, especially in comparison to the offline tape-based systems that were then in general use. Hard disk storage was also expensive enough to be a limiting factor on the quality of footage that most editors could work with and/or the amount of material that could be held digitised at any one time. In editing facilities rented by the hour or the day, a production's digitised rushes would usually be deleted at the end of the hire, so that the full amount of hard disk storage was available to the next client. Nonetheless, as all editing was being done at an offline video quality, it was possible to edit broadcast documentaries on as little as 3 gigabytes of hard drive storage. The end product of the offline non-linear editing process was a frame-accurate EDL that was output to a floppy disk and taken, together with the source tapes (aka 'the rushes'), to an online quality tape editing suite. The EDL was then read into an edit controller and used to 'auto-conform' a replica of the offline edit, playing portions of the source tapes back at full video quality and recording them to a master tape as per the exact edit points of the EDL.\n\nUp until 1992, the Apple Macintosh computers could access only 50 [[gigabytes]] of storage at once.  In 1992, this limitation was overcome by a group of industry experts led by [[Rick Eye]] a Digital Video R&D team at the [[Disney Channel]]. By February 1993, this team had integrated a long-form system that let the Avid Media Composer Apple Macintosh access over seven [[terabytes]] of digital video data. With instant access to the shot footage of an entire [[movie]], long form non-linear editing (Motion Picture Editing) was now possible. The system made its debut at the [[National Association of Broadcasters|NAB]] conference in 1993, in the booths of the three primary sub-system manufacturers, Avid, [[Silicon Graphics]] and [[Sony]].  Within a year, thousands of these systems, using Avid's Film Composer software (which handled the complex conversions between the offline video frame rates and the 24 fps of film), or the ever more sophisticated Media Composer, had replaced a century of [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] editing equipment in major motion picture studios and TV stations worldwide, making Avid the undisputed leader in \"off-line\" non-linear editing systems for over a decade.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k9KkIsSb5x0C&pg=PA137&dq=media+100+editing+suite+history&cd=7#v=onepage&q=media+100+editing+suite+history&f=false|title=Producing Video Podcasts: A Guide for Media Professionals|first1=Richard|last1=Harrington|first2=Mark|last2=Weiser|first3=RHED|last3=Pixel|date=12 February 2019|publisher=Taylor & Francis|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nAlthough M-JPEG became the standard codec for NLE during the early 1990s, it had drawbacks. Its high computational requirements ruled out software implementations, leading to the extra cost and complexity of hardware compression/playback cards. More importantly, the traditional tape [[workflow]] had involved editing from tape, often in a rented facility. When the editor left the edit suite, they could take their confidential video tapes with them. But the M-JPEG data rate was too high for systems like Avid on the [[Apple Macintosh|Mac]] and [[Lightworks]] on PC to store the video on removable storage, so these used fixed hard disks instead. The tape paradigm of keeping your (confidential) content with you was not possible with these fixed disks. Editing machines were often rented from facilities houses on a per-hour basis, and some productions chose to delete their material after each edit session, and then recapture it the next day to guarantee security of their content.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In addition, each NLE system had storage limited by its hard disk capacity.\n\nThese issues were addressed by a small UK company, [[Eidos Interactive]]. Eidos chose the new [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based computers from the UK and implemented an editing system, launched in Europe in 1990 at the [[International Broadcasting Convention]]. Because it implemented its own compression software designed specifically for non-linear editing, the Eidos system had no requirement for JPEG hardware and was cheap to produce. The software could decode multiple video and audio streams at once for real-time effects at no extra cost. But most significantly, for the first time, it supported unlimited cheap removable storage. The Eidos Edit 1, Edit 2, and later Optima systems let the editor use ''any'' Eidos system, rather than being tied down to a particular one, and still keep his data secure. The Optima software editing system was closely tied to [[Acorn Computers Ltd|Acorn]] hardware, so when Acorn stopped manufacturing the [[Risc PC]] in the late 1990s, Eidos discontinued the Optima system.\n\nIn the early 1990s, a small American company called Data Translation took what it knew about coding and decoding pictures for the US military and large corporate clients and spent $12 million developing a desktop editor based on its proprietary compression algorithms and off-the-shelf parts. Their aim was to 'democratize' the desktop and take some of Avid's market. In August 1993, [[Media 100]] entered the market, providing would-be editors with a low-cost, high-quality platform.\n\nAround the same period, two other competitors provided non-linear systems that required special hardware\u2014typically cards added to the computer system. Fast Video Machine was a PC-based system that first came out as an offline system, and later became more [[online editing]] capable. Immix Video Cube was also a contender for media production companies. The Immix Video Cube had a control surface with faders to allow mixing and shuttle controls without the purchase of third-party controllers. Data Translation's Media 100 came with three different JPEG codecs for different types of graphics of video and many resolutions. The Media 100 system kept increasing its maximum video resolution via software upgrades rather than hardware. This was because the Media 100 cards had enough processing power support resolutions as high as Avid systems at the upper end of the Avid product line. Cards at the time had embedded dedicated CPUs (for example a Motorola 68000 processor), which were as powerful as the processors inside the Macintosh systems that hosted the application. These other companies caused tremendous downward market pressure on Avid. Avid was forced to continually offer lower-priced systems to compete with the Media 100 and other systems.\n\nInspired by the success of Media 100, members of the [[Adobe Premiere Pro|Premiere]] development team left Adobe to start a project called \"Keygrip\" for Macromedia.  Difficulty raising support and money for development led the team to take their non-linear editor to the [[National Association of Broadcasters|NAB]] conference. After various companies made offers, Keygrip was purchased by Apple as Steve Jobs wanted a product to compete with Adobe Premiere in the desktop video market. At around the same time, Avid\u2014now with Windows versions of its editing software\u2014was considering abandoning the Macintosh platform. Apple released [[Final Cut Pro]] in 1999, and despite not being taken seriously at first by professionals, it has evolved into a serious competitor to entry level's Avid's systems.\n\n=== DV ===\nAnother leap came in the late 1990s with the launch of [[DV|DV-based]] video formats for consumer and professional use. With DV came [[FireWire|IEEE 1394]] (FireWire/iLink), a simple and inexpensive way of getting video into and out of computers. Users no longer had to convert video from [[analog signal|analog]] to digital\u2014it was recorded as digital to start with\u2014and FireWire offered a straightforward way to transfer video data without additional hardware or compression. With this innovation, editing became a more realistic proposition for standard computers with software-only packages. It enabled real desktop editing producing high-quality results at a fraction of the cost of other systems.\n\n=== HD ===\nIn early 2000, the introduction of highly compressed HD formats such as [[HDV]] has continued this trend, making it possible to edit HD material on a standard computer running a software-only editing application.\n\n[[Avid Technology|Avid]] is still considered the industry standard, with the majority of major feature films, television programs, and commercials created with its NLE systems.<ref name=\"Nonlinear-editors\">{{cite magazine|date=September 1, 2011|title=Nonlinear editors|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/multiformat/0112/nonlinear-editors/242232|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104191436/http://www.tvtechnology.com/multiformat/0112/nonlinear-editors/242232|archive-date=2018-01-04|work=Broadcast engineering}}</ref> Final Cut Pro received a [[Technology & Engineering Emmy Award#2001 Awards|Technology & Engineering Emmy Award]] in 2002 and continues to develop a following.\n\nAvid has held on to its market-leading position in the advent of cheaper software packages, notably [[Adobe Premiere]] in 1992 and [[Final Cut Pro]] in 1999. These three competing products by [[Avid Technology|Avid]], [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], and [[Apple Computer|Apple]] are the foremost NLEs, often referred to as the A-Team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pro.sony/en_GB/change-country-region-language?originalUrl=%2F|title=Change Country|website=pro.sony}}</ref> With advances in raw computer processing power, new products have appeared including [[NewTek]]'s software application [[SpeedEdit]].\n\nSince 2000, many personal computers include basic non-linear video editing software free of charge. This is the case of Apple [[iMovie]] for the Macintosh platform, various open source programs like [[Kdenlive]], [[Cinelerra-GG Infinity]] and [[PiTiVi]] for the Linux platform, and [[Windows Movie Maker]] for the Windows platform. This phenomenon has brought low-cost non-linear editing to consumers.\n\n=== The Cloud ===\nThe demands of video editing in terms of the volumes of data involved means the proximity of the footage (being edited) to that of the NLE system doing the editing is governed partly by the capacity of the data connection between the two. The increasing availability of broadband internet combined with the use of lower resolution copies of original material (video proxies) provided an opportunity to not just review and edit material remotely but also (since it is a public network) open up access to far more people to the same content at the same time.  In 2004 the first [[cloud-based video editor]], known as [[Blackbird_(software)|Blackbird]] and based on technology invented by [[Stephen_B._Streater|Stephen Streater]], was demonstrated at [[International_Broadcasting_Convention|IBC]] and recognised by the [[Royal_Television_Society|RTS]] the following year.  Since this time a number of other cloud-based editors have become available including systems from [[Avid_Technology|Avid]], [[WeVideo]] and [[Grabyo]]. Despite their reliance on a network connection, the need to ingest material before editing can take place and the use of \u2018video proxies\u2019, their adoption has grown. Their popularity has been driven largely by time savings (such as the speed with which material can be shared, for example, by no longer needing to physically transport media), efficiencies arising from opportunities for greater collaboration and the potential for cost savings derived from using a shared platform, or hiring rather than buying infrastructure, as well as the use of conventional IT equipment over hardware specifically design for video editing.\n\n=== 4K ===\nAs of 2014, [[4K resolution|4K Video]] in NLE is fairly new, but it is being used in the creation of many movies throughout the world, due to the increased use of advanced 4K cameras such as the [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|Red Camera]]. Examples of software for this task are [[Avid Technology|Avid]] [[Media Composer]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[Final Cut Pro X]], [[Sony Vegas]], [[Adobe Premiere]], [[DaVinci Resolve]], [[Edius]], and [[Cinelerra-GG Infinity]] for Linux.\n\n=== 8K ===\n{{asof|2019}} [[8K resolution|8K video]] is relatively new and 8K video editing requires advanced hardware and software capable of handling 8K video.\n\n===Image editing===\nFor imaging software, early works such as [[Kai Krause|HSC Software]]'s Live Picture<ref>http://www.pixiq.com/article/live-picture</ref> brought non-destructive editing to the professional market and current efforts such as [[GEGL]] provide an implementation being used in open source image editing software.\n\n== Quality ==\nAt one time, a primary concern with non-linear editing had been picture and sound quality.  Storage limitations at the time required that all material undergo [[lossy compression]] techniques to reduce the amount of memory occupied.\n\nImprovements in compression techniques and disk storage capacity have mitigated these concerns, and the migration to High Definition video and audio has virtually removed this concern completely.  Most professional NLEs are also able to edit uncompressed video with the appropriate hardware.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Hard disk recorder]]\n*[[List of video topics]]\n*[[Version control]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://archive.org/details/desktopvideo A link to a downloadable episode of the TV show \"The Computer Chronicles\" from 1990, which includes a feature on the first Avid Media Composer]\n\n{{Film editing}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Non-Linear Editing System}}\n[[Category:Film and video technology]]\n[[Category:Film editing]]\n[[Category:Digital audio]]\n[[Category:Video editing software]]\n[[Category:Filmmaking]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Form of audio, video, or image editing}}\n\n[[File:Videowisconsinstudio.tif|thumb|alt=An example of a video editing studio|Example of a non-linear video editing studio ]]\n\n'''Non-linear editing''' is a form of [[offline editing]] for [[Audio editing|audio]], [[Video editing|video]], and [[image editing]]. In offline editing, the original content is not modified in the course of editing. In non-linear editing, edits are specified and modified by specialized software. A pointer-based playlist, effectively an [[edit decision list]] (EDL), for video or a [[directed acyclic graph]] for still images is used to keep track of edits. Each time the edited audio, video, or image is rendered, played back, or accessed, it is reconstructed from the original source and the specified editing steps.  Although this process is more computationally intensive than directly modifying the original content, changing the edits themselves can be almost instantaneous, and it prevents further [[generation loss]] as the audio, video, or image is edited.\n\nA '''non-linear editing system''' ('''NLE''') is a video (NLVE) or audio editing (NLAE) [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) system that performs non-destructive editing on source material.  The name is in contrast to 20th century methods of [[linear video editing]] and [[film editing]].\n\n== Basic techniques ==\nA non-linear editing approach may be used when all assets are available as files on [[video server]]s or [[hard disk]]s, rather than recordings on reels or tapes. While linear editing is tied to the need to sequentially view film or hear tape, non-linear editing enables direct access to any [[video frame]] in a digital [[video clip]], without having to play or [[Scrubbing (audio)|scrub/shuttle]] through adjacent [[footage]] to reach it, as is necessary with [[video tape]] linear editing systems.\n\nWhen ingesting audio or video feeds, [[metadata]] are attached to the clip. Those metadata can be attached automatically ([[timecode]], localization, take number, name of the clip) or manually (players names, characters, in sports: [[red card (sports)|red card]], goal...). It is then possible to access any frame by entering directly the timecode or the descriptive metadata. An editor can, for example at the end of the day in the [[Olympic Games]], easily retrieve all the clips related to the players who received a gold medal.\n\nThe non-linear editing method is similar in concept to the [[Cut, copy, and paste|cut and paste]] techniques used in [[Information technology|IT]]. However, with the use of non-linear editing systems, the destructive act of cutting of film negatives is eliminated. It can also be viewed as the audio/video equivalent of [[word processing]], which is why it is called [[desktop video]] editing in the consumer space.<ref>{{cite book|author=Evans, Russell|title=Practical DV Filmmaking|publisher=Focal Press|date=2005|isbn=0-240-80738-3|page=14}}</ref>\n\n== Broadcast workflows and advantages ==\nIn [[broadcasting]] applications, video and audio data are first captured to hard disk-based systems or other digital storage devices.  The data are then imported into servers employing any necessary [[transcoding]], [[digitizing]] or [[Transfer (computing)|transfer]]). Once imported, the source material can be edited on a computer using any of a wide range of [[video editing software]].\n\nEditing software records the editor's decisions in an [[edit decision list]] (EDL) that is exportable to other editing tools. Many generations and variations of the EDL can exist without storing many different copies, allowing for very flexible editing.  It also makes it easy to change cuts and undo previous decisions simply by editing the EDL (without having to have the actual film data duplicated). [[Generation loss]] is also controlled, due to not having to repeatedly re-encode the data when different effects are applied.\n\nCompared to the linear method of tape-to-tape editing, non-linear editing offers the flexibility of film editing, with random access and easy project organization. In non-linear editing, the original source files are not lost or modified during editing. This is one of the biggest advantages of non-linear editing compared to linear editing. With the EDLs, the editor can work on low-resolution copies of the video. This makes it possible to edit both standard-definition broadcast quality and [[High-definition video|high definition]] broadcast quality very quickly on desktop computers that may not have the power to process huge full-quality high-resolution data in real-time.\n\nThe costs of editing systems have dropped such that non-linear editing tools are now within the reach of home users. Some editing software can now be accessed free as [[web application]]s; some, like [[Cinelerra]] (focused on the professional market) and [[Blender (software)|Blender]], can be downloaded as [[free software]]; and some, like [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Movie Maker]] or [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iMovie]], come included with the appropriate operating system.\n\n== Accessing the material ==\nThe non-linear editing retrieves video media for editing. Because these media exist on the video server or other mass storage that stores the video feeds in a given [[codec]], the editing system can use several methods to access the material:\n\n;Direct access\n:The video server records feeds with a codec readable by the editing system, has network connection to the editor and allows direct editing. The editor previews material directly on the server (which it sees as remote storage) and edits directly on the server without [[transcoding]] or [[Transfer (computing)|transfer]].\n;[[Shared resource|Shared storage]]\n:The video server transfers feeds to and from shared storage that is accessible by all editors. Media in the appropriate codec on the server need only transferred. If recorded with a different codec, media must be transcoded during transfer. In some cases (depending on material), files on shared storage can be edited even before the transfer is finished.\n;Importing\n:The editor downloads the material and edits it locally.

Various editing tasks could then be performed on the imported video before export to another [[Recording medium|medium]], or [[MPEG]] [[Code|encode]]d for transfer to a [[DVD]].\n\nModern web-based editing systems can take video directly from a camera phone over a [[GPRS]] or [[3G]] mobile connection, and editing can take place through a web browser interface, so, strictly speaking, a computer for video editing does not require any installed hardware or software beyond a [[web browser]] and an [[internet]] connection.\n\n== History ==\n{{cleanup rewrite|section|date=May 2012}}\n\nWhen [[videotape]]s were first developed in the 1950s, the only way to edit was to physically cut the tape with a razor blade and splice segments together.  While the footage excised in this process was not technically destroyed, continuity was lost and the footage was generally discarded. In 1963, with the introduction of the [[Ampex]] Editec, video tape could be edited electronically with a process known as [[linear video editing]] by selectively copying the original footage to another tape called a ''master''.  The original recordings are not destroyed or altered in this process. However since the final product is a copy of the original, there is a generation loss of quality.\n\n=== First non-linear editor ===\nThe first truly non-linear editor, the [[CMX 600]], was introduced in 1971 by [[CMX Systems]], a joint venture between [[CBS]] and [[Memorex]].<ref>{{citation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410092334/http://sundialmedia.com/sait/articles/found_a/heat_f.htm |archive-date=2013-04-10 |url=http://sundialmedia.com/sait/articles/found_a/heat_f.htm |title=The History of Digital Nonlinear Editing |work=Facer Ezine}}</ref><ref>{{citation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021231834/http://nonlinear.info/N4.history.pdf |archive-date=2007-10-21 |url=http://nonlinear.info/N4.history.pdf |title=A Brief History Of Electronic Editing |work=Non Linear}}</ref>  It recorded and played back black-and-white analog video recorded in \"[[skip-field]]\" mode on modified [[disk pack]] drives the size of washing machines.  These were commonly used to store about half an hour of data digitally on mainframe computers of the time.  The 600 had a console with two monitors built in.  The right monitor, which played the preview video, was used by the editor to make cuts and edit decisions using a [[light pen]].  The editor selected from options superimposed as text over the preview video. The left monitor was used to display the edited video.  A DEC [[PDP-11]] computer served as a controller for the whole system.  Because the video edited on the 600 was in low-resolution black and white, the 600 was suitable only for offline editing.\n\n=== The 1980s ===\nNon-linear editing systems were built in the 1980s using computers coordinating multiple [[LaserDisc]]s or banks of VCRs.  One example of these tape and disc-based systems was Lucasfilm's [[EditDroid]], which used several LaserDiscs of the same raw footage to simulate random-access editing.{{efn|A compatible system called [[SoundDroid]] was developed for sound post-production.

Ediflex was introduced in 1983 on the Universal series \"[[Still the Beaver]]\". By 1985 it was used on over 80% of filmed network programs.

A custom circuit board was added to each deck that enabled frame-accurate switching and playback using vertical interval timecode. Intelligent positioning and sequencing of the source decks provided a simulation of random-access playback of a lengthy edited sequence without any rerecording. The theory was that with so many copies of the rushes, there could always be one machine cued up to replay the next shot in real time. Changing the EDL could be done easily, and the results seen immediately.\n\nThe first feature edited on the Montage was Sidney Lumet's ''[[Power (1986 film)|Power]]''.  Notably, Francis Coppola edited ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' on the system, and Stanley Kubrick used it for ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]''.  It was used on several episodic TV shows (''[[Knots Landing]]'', for one) and on hundreds of commercials and music videos.\n\nThe original Montage system won an Academy Award for Technical Achievement in 1988.{{cn|reason=Doesn't appear in list at [[Academy Scientific and Technical Award]]|date=September 2019}} Montage was reincarnated as Montage II in 1987, and Montage III appeared at NAB in 1991, using digital disk technology, which should prove to be considerably less cumbersome than the Betamax system.\n\nAll of these original systems were slow, cumbersome, and had problems with the limited computer horsepower of the time, but the mid-to-late-1980s saw a trend towards non-linear editing, moving away from film editing on [[Moviola]]s and the linear videotape method using [[U-matic]] VCRs. Computer processing advanced sufficiently by the end of the '80s to enable true digital imagery, and has progressed today to provide this capability in personal desktop computers. \n\nAn example of computing power progressing to make non-linear editing possible was demonstrated in the first all-digital non-linear editing system, the \"Harry\" effects compositing system manufactured by [[Quantel]] in 1985.  Although it was more of a video effects system, it had some non-linear editing capabilities. Most importantly, it could record (and apply effects to) 80 seconds (due to hard disk space limitations) of broadcast-quality uncompressed digital video encoded in 8-bit [[CCIR 601]] format on its built-in hard disk array.\n\n=== The 1990s ===\nThe term ''nonlinear editing'' was formalized in 1991 with the publication of Michael Rubin's ''Nonlinear: A Guide to Digital Film and Video Editing'' (Triad, 1991)\u2014which popularized this terminology over other language common at the time, including ''real time'' editing, ''random-access'' or ''RA'' editing, ''virtual'' editing, ''electronic film'' editing, and so on.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nNon-linear editing with computers as it is known today was first introduced by [[Editing Machines Corp.]] in 1989 with the EMC2 editor, a PC-based non-linear off-line editing system that utilized magneto-optical disks for storage and playback of video, using half-screen-resolution video at 15 frames per second. A couple of weeks later that same year, [[Avid Technology|Avid]] introduced the Avid/1, the first in the line of their [[Media Composer]] systems. It was based on the [[Apple Macintosh]] computer platform ([[Macintosh II]] systems were used) with special hardware and software developed and installed by Avid.\n\nThe video quality of the Avid/1 (and later [[Media Composer]] systems from the late 1980s) was somewhat low (about VHS quality), due to the use of a very early version of a [[Motion JPEG]] (M-JPEG) [[codec]].  It was sufficient, however, to provide a versatile system for offline editing.  ''[[Lost in Yonkers (film)|Lost in Yonkers]]'' (1993) was the first film edited with Avid Media Composer, and the first long-form documentary so edited was the HBO program ''Earth and the American Dream'', which won a National Primetime Emmy Award for Editing in 1993.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\nThe [[NewTek]] [[Video Toaster#Video Toaster Flyer|Video Toaster Flyer]] for the [[Amiga]] included non-linear editing capabilities in addition to processing live video signals.  The Flyer used [[hard drive]]s to store video clips and audio, and supported complex scripted playback. The Flyer provided simultaneous dual-channel playback, which let the Toaster's [[Video switcher]] perform transitions and other effects on [[Video clip]]s without additional [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]].  The Flyer portion of the Video Toaster/Flyer combination was a complete computer of its own, having its own [[microprocessor]] and [[embedded software]]. Its hardware included three embedded [[SCSI]] controllers. Two of these SCSI buses were used to store video data, and the third to store audio.  The Flyer used a proprietary [[Wavelet compression]] algorithm known as [[VTASC]], which was well regarded at the time for offering better visual quality than comparable [[Motion JPEG]] based non-linear editing systems.\n\nUntil 1993, the Avid Media Composer was most often used for editing commercials or other small content/high value projects. This was primarily because the purchase cost of the system was very high, especially in comparison to the offline tape-based systems that were then in general use. Hard disk storage was also expensive enough to be a limiting factor on the quality of footage that most editors could work with and/or the amount of material that could be held digitised at any one time. In editing facilities rented by the hour or the day, a production's digitised rushes would usually be deleted at the end of the hire, so that the full amount of hard disk storage was available to the next client. Nonetheless, as all editing was being done at an offline video quality, it was possible to edit broadcast documentaries on as little as 3 gigabytes of hard drive storage. The end product of the offline non-linear editing process was a frame-accurate EDL that was output to a floppy disk and taken, together with the source tapes (aka 'the rushes'), to an online quality tape editing suite. The EDL was then read into an edit controller and used to 'auto-conform' a replica of the offline edit, playing portions of the source tapes back at full video quality and recording them to a master tape as per the exact edit points of the EDL.\n\nUp until 1992, the Apple Macintosh computers could access only 50 [[gigabytes]] of storage at once.  In 1992, this limitation was overcome by a group of industry experts led by [[Rick Eye]] a Digital Video R&D team at the [[Disney Channel]]. By February 1993, this team had integrated a long-form system that let the Avid Media Composer Apple Macintosh access over seven [[terabytes]] of digital video data. With instant access to the shot footage of an entire [[movie]], long form non-linear editing (Motion Picture Editing) was now possible. The system made its debut at the [[National Association of Broadcasters|NAB]] conference in 1993, in the booths of the three primary sub-system manufacturers, Avid, [[Silicon Graphics]] and [[Sony]].  Within a year, thousands of these systems, using Avid's Film Composer software (which handled the complex conversions between the offline video frame rates and the 24 fps of film), or the ever more sophisticated Media Composer, had replaced a century of [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] editing equipment in major motion picture studios and TV stations worldwide, making Avid the undisputed leader in \"off-line\" non-linear editing systems for over a decade.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k9KkIsSb5x0C&pg=PA137&dq=media+100+editing+suite+history&cd=7#v=onepage&q=media+100+editing+suite+history&f=false|title=Producing Video Podcasts: A Guide for Media Professionals|first1=Richard|last1=Harrington|first2=Mark|last2=Weiser|first3=RHED|last3=Pixel|date=12 February 2019|publisher=Taylor & Francis|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nAlthough M-JPEG became the standard codec for NLE during the early 1990s, it had drawbacks. Its high computational requirements ruled out software implementations, leading to the extra cost and complexity of hardware compression/playback cards. More importantly, the traditional tape [[workflow]] had involved editing from tape, often in a rented facility. When the editor left the edit suite, they could take their confidential video tapes with them. But the M-JPEG data rate was too high for systems like Avid on the [[Apple Macintosh|Mac]] and [[Lightworks]] on PC to store the video on removable storage, so these used fixed hard disks instead. The tape paradigm of keeping your (confidential) content with you was not possible with these fixed disks. Editing machines were often rented from facilities houses on a per-hour basis, and some productions chose to delete their material after each edit session, and then recapture it the next day to guarantee security of their content.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In addition, each NLE system had storage limited by its hard disk capacity.\n\nThese issues were addressed by a small UK company, [[Eidos Interactive]]. Eidos chose the new [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based computers from the UK and implemented an editing system, launched in Europe in 1990 at the [[International Broadcasting Convention]]. Because it implemented its own compression software designed specifically for non-linear editing, the Eidos system had no requirement for JPEG hardware and was cheap to produce. The software could decode multiple video and audio streams at once for real-time effects at no extra cost. But most significantly, for the first time, it supported unlimited cheap removable storage. The Eidos Edit 1, Edit 2, and later Optima systems let the editor use ''any'' Eidos system, rather than being tied down to a particular one, and still keep his data secure. The Optima software editing system was closely tied to [[Acorn Computers Ltd|Acorn]] hardware, so when Acorn stopped manufacturing the [[Risc PC]] in the late 1990s, Eidos discontinued the Optima system.\n\nIn the early 1990s, a small American company called Data Translation took what it knew about coding and decoding pictures for the US military and large corporate clients and spent $12 million developing a desktop editor based on its proprietary compression algorithms and off-the-shelf parts. Their aim was to 'democratize' the desktop and take some of Avid's market. In August 1993, [[Media 100]] entered the market, providing would-be editors with a low-cost, high-quality platform.\n\nAround the same period, two other competitors provided non-linear systems that required special hardware\u2014typically cards added to the computer system. Fast Video Machine was a PC-based system that first came out as an offline system, and later became more [[online editing]] capable. Immix Video Cube was also a contender for media production companies. The Immix Video Cube had a control surface with faders to allow mixing and shuttle controls without the purchase of third-party controllers. Data Translation's Media 100 came with three different JPEG codecs for different types of graphics of video and many resolutions. The Media 100 system kept increasing its maximum video resolution via software upgrades rather than hardware. This was because the Media 100 cards had enough processing power support resolutions as high as Avid systems at the upper end of the Avid product line. Cards at the time had embedded dedicated CPUs (for example a Motorola 68000 processor), which were as powerful as the processors inside the Macintosh systems that hosted the application. These other companies caused tremendous downward market pressure on Avid. Avid was forced to continually offer lower-priced systems to compete with the Media 100 and other systems.\n\nInspired by the success of Media 100, members of the [[Adobe Premiere Pro|Premiere]] development team left Adobe to start a project called \"Keygrip\" for Macromedia.  Difficulty raising support and money for development led the team to take their non-linear editor to the [[National Association of Broadcasters|NAB]] conference. After various companies made offers, Keygrip was purchased by Apple as Steve Jobs wanted a product to compete with Adobe Premiere in the desktop video market. At around the same time, Avid\u2014now with Windows versions of its editing software\u2014was considering abandoning the Macintosh platform. Apple released [[Final Cut Pro]] in 1999, and despite not being taken seriously at first by professionals, it has evolved into a serious competitor to entry level's Avid's systems.\n\n=== DV ===\nAnother leap came in the late 1990s with the launch of [[DV|DV-based]] video formats for consumer and professional use. With DV came [[FireWire|IEEE 1394]] (FireWire/iLink), a simple and inexpensive way of getting video into and out of computers. Users no longer had to convert video from [[analog signal|analog]] to digital\u2014it was recorded as digital to start with\u2014and FireWire offered a straightforward way to transfer video data without additional hardware or compression. With this innovation, editing became a more realistic proposition for standard computers with software-only packages. It enabled real desktop editing producing high-quality results at a fraction of the cost of other systems.\n\n=== HD ===\nIn early 2000, the introduction of highly compressed HD formats such as [[HDV]] has continued this trend, making it possible to edit HD material on a standard computer running a software-only editing application.\n\n[[Avid Technology|Avid]] is still considered the industry standard, with the majority of major feature films, television programs, and commercials created with its NLE systems.<ref name=\"Nonlinear-editors\">{{cite magazine|date=September 1, 2011|title=Nonlinear editors|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/multiformat/0112/nonlinear-editors/242232|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104191436/http://www.tvtechnology.com/multiformat/0112/nonlinear-editors/242232|archive-date=2018-01-04|work=Broadcast engineering}}</ref> Final Cut Pro received a [[Technology & Engineering Emmy Award#2001 Awards|Technology & Engineering Emmy Award]] in 2002 and continues to develop a following.\n\nAvid has held on to its market-leading position in the advent of cheaper software packages, notably [[Adobe Premiere]] in 1992 and [[Final Cut Pro]] in 1999. These three competing products by [[Avid Technology|Avid]], [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], and [[Apple Computer|Apple]] are the foremost NLEs, often referred to as the A-Team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pro.sony/en_GB/change-country-region-language?originalUrl=%2F|title=Change Country|website=pro.sony}}</ref> With advances in raw computer processing power, new products have appeared including [[NewTek]]'s software application [[SpeedEdit]].\n\nSince 2000, many personal computers include basic non-linear video editing software free of charge. This is the case of Apple [[iMovie]] for the Macintosh platform, various open source programs like [[Kdenlive]], [[Cinelerra-GG Infinity]] and [[PiTiVi]] for the Linux platform, and [[Windows Movie Maker]] for the Windows platform. This phenomenon has brought low-cost non-linear editing to consumers.\n\n=== The Cloud ===\nThe demands of video editing in terms of the volumes of data involved means the proximity of the footage (being edited) to that of the NLE system doing the editing is governed partly by the capacity of the data connection between the two. The increasing availability of broadband internet combined with the use of lower resolution copies of original material (video proxies) provided an opportunity to not just review and edit material remotely but also (since it is a public network) open up access to far more people to the same content at the same time.  In 2004 the first [[cloud-based video editor]], known as [[Blackbird_(software)|Blackbird]] and based on technology invented by [[Stephen_B._Streater|Stephen Streater]], was demonstrated at [[International_Broadcasting_Convention|IBC]] and recognised by the [[Royal_Television_Society|RTS]] the following year.  Since this time a number of other cloud-based editors have become available including systems from [[Avid_Technology|Avid]], [[WeVideo]] and [[Grabyo]]. Despite their reliance on a network connection, the need to ingest material before editing can take place and the use of \u2018video proxies\u2019, their adoption has grown. Their popularity has been driven largely by time savings (such as the speed with which material can be shared, for example, by no longer needing to physically transport media), efficiencies arising from opportunities for greater collaboration and the potential for cost savings derived from using a shared platform, or hiring rather than buying infrastructure, as well as the use of conventional IT equipment over hardware specifically design for video editing.\n\n=== 4K ===\nAs of 2014, [[4K resolution|4K Video]] in NLE is fairly new, but it is being used in the creation of many movies throughout the world, due to the increased use of advanced 4K cameras such as the [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|Red Camera]]. Examples of software for this task are [[Avid Technology|Avid]] [[Media Composer]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[Final Cut Pro X]], [[Sony Vegas]], [[Adobe Premiere]], [[DaVinci Resolve]], [[Edius]], and [[Cinelerra-GG Infinity]] for Linux.\n\n=== 8K ===\n{{asof|2019}} [[8K resolution|8K video]] is relatively new and 8K video editing requires advanced hardware and software capable of handling 8K video.\n\n===Image editing===\nFor imaging software, early works such as [[Kai Krause|HSC Software]]'s Live Picture<ref>http://www.pixiq.com/article/live-picture</ref> brought non-destructive editing to the professional market and current efforts such as [[GEGL]] provide an implementation being used in open source image editing software.\n\n== Quality ==\nAt one time, a primary concern with non-linear editing had been picture and sound quality.  Storage limitations at the time required that all material undergo [[lossy compression]] techniques to reduce the amount of memory occupied.\n\nImprovements in compression techniques and disk storage capacity have mitigated these concerns, and the migration to High Definition video and audio has virtually removed this concern completely.  Most professional NLEs are also able to edit uncompressed video with the appropriate hardware.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Hard disk recorder]]\n*[[List of video topics]]\n*[[Version control]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://archive.org/details/desktopvideo A link to a downloadable episode of the TV show \"The Computer Chronicles\" from 1990, which includes a feature on the first Avid Media Composer]\n\n{{Film editing}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Non-Linear Editing System}}\n[[Category:Film and video technology]]\n[[Category:Film editing]]\n[[Category:Digital audio]]\n[[Category:Video editing software]]\n[[Category:Filmmaking]]\n", "name_user": "Harry munday", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-linear_editing_system"}

(Not shown is the simultaneous process where the top wire makes a magnetic field which results in a force on the bottom wire.)]]\n\nIn [[magnetostatics]], the force of attraction or repulsion between two current-carrying wires (see first figure below) is often called '''Amp\u00e8re's force law'''. The physical origin of this force is that each wire generates a magnetic field, following the [[Biot\u2013Savart law]], and the other wire experiences a magnetic force as a consequence, following the [[Lorentz force law]].\n\n==Equation==\n\n===Special case: Two straight parallel wires===\n\nThe best-known and simplest example of Amp\u00e8re's force law, which underlies the definition of the [[ampere]], the [[SI]] unit of current, states that the force per unit length between two straight parallel conductors is\n\n::<math>  \\frac {F_m} {L} = 2 k_A \\frac {I_1 I_2 } {r}</math>,\n\nwhere ''k''<sub>A</sub> is the magnetic force constant from the [[Biot\u2013Savart law]], ''F<sub>m</sub>/L'' is the total force on either wire per unit length of the shorter (the longer is approximated as infinitely long relative to the shorter), ''r'' is the distance between the two wires, and ''I''<sub>1</sub>, ''I''<sub>2</sub> are the [[direct current]]s carried by the wires.\n\nThis is a good approximation if one wire is sufficiently longer than the other, so that it can be approximated as infinitely long, and if the distance between the wires is small compared to their lengths (so that the one infinite-wire approximation holds), but large compared to their diameters (so that they may also be approximated as infinitely thin lines). The value of ''k''<sub>A</sub> depends upon the system of units chosen, and the value of ''k''<sub>A</sub> decides how large the unit of current will be.

Through differentiation, it can be shown that:\n\n:<math>  \\frac{\\cos(xds) \\cos(rds')} {r^2} = -\\cos(rx) \\frac{(\\cos\\epsilon - 3 \\cos\\phi \\cos\\phi')} {r^2} </math>.\n\nand also the identity:\n\n:<math>  \\frac{\\cos(rx) \\cos(dsds')} {r^2} = \\frac{\\cos(rx) \\cos\\epsilon} {r^2} </math>.\n\nWith these expressions, Amp\u00e8re's force law can be expressed as:\n\n:<math>  dF_x = k I I' ds'\\int ds' \\cos(rx) \\frac{2\\cos\\epsilon - 3\\cos\\phi \\cos\\phi'} {r^2} </math>.\n\nUsing the identities:\n\n:<math>  \\frac{\\partial r} {\\partial s} = \\cos\\phi,  \\frac{\\partial r} {\\partial s'} = -\\cos\\phi'    </math>.\n\nand\n\n:<math>  \\frac{\\partial^2 r} {\\partial s \\partial s'} = \\frac{-\\cos\\epsilon + \\cos\\phi \\cos\\phi'} {r} </math>.\n\nAmp\u00e8re's results can be expressed in the form:\n\n:<math>  d^2 F = \\frac{k I I' ds ds'} {r^2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial s} \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial s'} - 2r \\frac{\\partial^2 r}{\\partial s \\partial s'}\\right)  </math>.\n\nAs Maxwell noted, terms can be added to this expression, which are derivatives of a function Q(r) and, when integrated, cancel each other out. Thus, Maxwell gave \"the most general form consistent with the experimental facts\" for the force on ds arising from the action of ds':<ref>{{cite book|last=Maxwell|first=James Clerk|title=Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism|year=1904|publisher=Oxford|pages=173}}</ref>\n\n:<math>  d^2 F_x = k I I' ds ds'\\frac{1} {r^2} \\left[ \\left( \\left( \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial s} \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial s'} - 2r \\frac{\\partial^2 r}{\\partial s \\partial s'}\\right) + r \\frac{\\partial^2 Q}{\\partial s \\partial s'}\\right) \\cos(rx) + \\frac{\\partial Q} {\\partial s'} \\cos(xds) - \\frac{\\partial Q} {\\partial s} \\cos(xds') \\right]   </math>.\n\nQ is a function of r, according to Maxwell, which \"cannot be determined, without assumptions of some kind, from experiments in which the active current forms a closed circuit.\" Taking the function Q(r) to be of the form:\n\n:<math>  Q = - \\frac{(1+k)} {2r} </math>\n\nWe obtain the general expression for the force exerted on ds by ds:\n\n:<math>  \\mathbf{d^2F} = -\\frac{k I I'} {2r^2} \\left[ (3-k)\\hat{\\mathbf{r_1}} (\\mathbf{dsds'}) - 3(1-k) \\hat{\\mathbf{r_1}} (\\mathbf{\\hat{r_1} ds}) (\\mathbf{\\hat{r_1} ds'}) - (1+k)\\mathbf{ds} (\\mathbf{\\hat{r_1} ds'})-(1+k) \\mathbf{d's} (\\mathbf{\\hat{r_1} ds}) \\right] </math>.\n\nIntegrating around s' eliminates k and the original expression given by Amp\u00e8re and Gauss is obtained. Thus, as far as the original Amp\u00e8re experiments are concerned, the value of k has no significance. Amp\u00e8re took k=-1; Gauss took k=+1, as did Grassmann and Clausius, although Clausius omitted the S component. In the non-ethereal electron theories, Weber took k=-1 and Riemann took k=+1. Ritz left k undetermined in his theory. If we take k = -1, we obtain the Amp\u00e8re expression:\n\n:<math>  \\mathbf{d^2F} = -\\frac{k I I'} {r^3} \\left[ 2 \\mathbf{r} (\\mathbf{dsds'}) - 3\\mathbf{r} (\\mathbf{r ds}) (\\mathbf{r ds'}) \\right] </math>\n\nIf we take k=+1, we obtain\n\n:<math>  \\mathbf{d^2F} = -\\frac{k I I'} {r^3} \\left[ \\mathbf{r} (\\mathbf{dsds'}) - \\mathbf{ds (r ds')} -\\mathbf{ds'(r ds)} \\right] </math>\n\nUsing the vector identity for the triple cross product, we may express this result as\n\n:<math>  \\mathbf{d^2F} = \\frac{k I I'} {r^3} \\left[ \\left(\\mathbf{ds}\\times\\mathbf{ds'}\\times\\mathbf{r}\\right)+ \\mathbf{ds'(r ds)} \\right] </math>\n\nWhen integrated around ds' the second term is zero, and thus we find the form of Amp\u00e8re's force law given by Maxwell:\n\n:<math>  \\mathbf{F} = k I I' \\int \\int \\frac{\\mathbf{ds}\\times(\\mathbf{ds'}\\times\\mathbf{r})} {|r|^3} </math>\n\n==Derivation of parallel straight wire case from general formula==\n\nStart from the general formula:\n:<math>  \\vec{F}_{12} = \\frac {\\mu_0} {4 \\pi} \\int_{L_1} \\int_{L_2} \\frac {I_1 d \\vec{\\ell}_1\\ \\mathbf{ \\times} \\ (I_2 d  \\vec{\\ell}_2 \\ \\mathbf{ \\times } \\ \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{21} )} {|r|^2}</math>,\nAssume wire 2 is along the x-axis, and wire 1 is at y=D, z=0, parallel to the x-axis. Let <math>x_1,x_2</math> be the x-coordinate of the differential element of wire 1 and wire 2, respectively. In other words, the differential element of wire 1 is at <math>(x_1,D,0)</math> and the differential element of wire 2 is at <math>(x_2,0,0)</math>. By properties of line integrals, <math>d\\vec{\\ell}_1=(dx_1,0,0)</math> and <math>d\\vec{\\ell}_2=(dx_2,0,0)</math>.

In fact, what we really want to know is the attractive force ''per unit length'' of wire 1. Therefore, assume wire 1 has a large but finite length <math>L_1</math>. Then the force vector felt by wire 1 is:\n:<math>  \\vec{F}_{12} = \\frac {\\mu_0 I_1 I_2} {4 \\pi}\\frac{2}{D}(0,-1,0) L_1 </math>.\nAs expected, the force that the wire feels is proportional to its length. The force per unit length is:\n:<math>  \\frac{\\vec{F}_{12}}{L_1} = \\frac {\\mu_0 I_1 I_2} {2 \\pi D}(0,-1,0) </math>.\nThe direction of the force is along the y-axis, representing wire 1 getting pulled towards wire 2 if the currents are parallel, as expected. The magnitude of the force per unit length agrees with the expression for <math>\\frac {F_m} {L}</math> shown above.\n\n==Notable derivations of Amp\u00e8re's force law==\nChronologically ordered:\n*Amp\u00e8re's original 1823 derivation:\n**{{Cite book| publisher = Apeiron| isbn = 978-1-987980-03-5| last1 = Assis| first1 = Andr\u00e9 Koch Torres| last2 = Chaib| first2 = J.

The physical origin of this force is that each wire generates a magnetic field, following the [[Biot\u2013Savart law]], and the other wire experiences a magnetic force as a consequence, following the [[Lorentz force law]].\n\n==Equation==\n\n===Special case: Two straight parallel wires===\n\nThe best-known and simplest example of Amp\u00e8re's force law, which underlies the definition of the [[ampere]], the [[SI]] unit of current, states that the force per unit length between two straight parallel conductors is\n\n::<math>  \\frac {F_m} {L} = 2 k_A \\frac {I_1 I_2 } {r}</math>,\n\nwhere ''k''<sub>A</sub> is the magnetic force constant from the [[Biot\u2013Savart law]], ''F<sub>m</sub>/L'' is the total force on either wire per unit length of the shorter (the longer is approximated as infinitely long relative to the shorter), ''r'' is the distance between the two wires, and ''I''<sub>1</sub>, ''I''<sub>2</sub> are the [[direct current]]s carried by the wires.\n\nThis is a good approximation if one wire is sufficiently longer than the other, so that it can be approximated as infinitely long, and if the distance between the wires is small compared to their lengths (so that the one infinite-wire approximation holds), but large compared to their diameters (so that they may also be approximated as infinitely thin lines). The value of ''k''<sub>A</sub> depends upon the system of units chosen, and the value of ''k''<sub>A</sub> decides how large the unit of current will be.

Through differentiation, it can be shown that:\n\n:<math>  \\frac{\\cos(xds) \\cos(rds')} {r^2} = -\\cos(rx) \\frac{(\\cos\\epsilon - 3 \\cos\\phi \\cos\\phi')} {r^2} </math>.\n\nand also the identity:\n\n:<math>  \\frac{\\cos(rx) \\cos(dsds')} {r^2} = \\frac{\\cos(rx) \\cos\\epsilon} {r^2} </math>.\n\nWith these expressions, Amp\u00e8re's force law can be expressed as:\n\n:<math>  dF_x = k I I' ds'\\int ds' \\cos(rx) \\frac{2\\cos\\epsilon - 3\\cos\\phi \\cos\\phi'} {r^2} </math>.\n\nUsing the identities:\n\n:<math>  \\frac{\\partial r} {\\partial s} = \\cos\\phi,  \\frac{\\partial r} {\\partial s'} = -\\cos\\phi'    </math>.\n\nand\n\n:<math>  \\frac{\\partial^2 r} {\\partial s \\partial s'} = \\frac{-\\cos\\epsilon + \\cos\\phi \\cos\\phi'} {r} </math>.\n\nAmp\u00e8re's results can be expressed in the form:\n\n:<math>  d^2 F = \\frac{k I I' ds ds'} {r^2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial s} \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial s'} - 2r \\frac{\\partial^2 r}{\\partial s \\partial s'}\\right)  </math>.\n\nAs Maxwell noted, terms can be added to this expression, which are derivatives of a function Q(r) and, when integrated, cancel each other out. Thus, Maxwell gave \"the most general form consistent with the experimental facts\" for the force on ds arising from the action of ds':<ref>{{cite book|last=Maxwell|first=James Clerk|title=Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism|year=1904|publisher=Oxford|pages=173}}</ref>\n\n:<math>  d^2 F_x = k I I' ds ds'\\frac{1} {r^2} \\left[ \\left( \\left( \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial s} \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial s'} - 2r \\frac{\\partial^2 r}{\\partial s \\partial s'}\\right) + r \\frac{\\partial^2 Q}{\\partial s \\partial s'}\\right) \\cos(rx) + \\frac{\\partial Q} {\\partial s'} \\cos(xds) - \\frac{\\partial Q} {\\partial s} \\cos(xds') \\right]   </math>.\n\nQ is a function of r, according to Maxwell, which \"cannot be determined, without assumptions of some kind, from experiments in which the active current forms a closed circuit.\" Taking the function Q(r) to be of the form:\n\n:<math>  Q = - \\frac{(1+k)} {2r} </math>\n\nWe obtain the general expression for the force exerted on ds by ds:\n\n:<math>  \\mathbf{d^2F} = -\\frac{k I I'} {2r^2} \\left[ (3-k)\\hat{\\mathbf{r_1}} (\\mathbf{dsds'}) - 3(1-k) \\hat{\\mathbf{r_1}} (\\mathbf{\\hat{r_1} ds}) (\\mathbf{\\hat{r_1} ds'}) - (1+k)\\mathbf{ds} (\\mathbf{\\hat{r_1} ds'})-(1+k) \\mathbf{d's} (\\mathbf{\\hat{r_1} ds}) \\right] </math>.\n\nIntegrating around s' eliminates k and the original expression given by Amp\u00e8re and Gauss is obtained. Thus, as far as the original Amp\u00e8re experiments are concerned, the value of k has no significance. Amp\u00e8re took k=-1; Gauss took k=+1, as did Grassmann and Clausius, although Clausius omitted the S component. In the non-ethereal electron theories, Weber took k=-1 and Riemann took k=+1. Ritz left k undetermined in his theory. If we take k = -1, we obtain the Amp\u00e8re expression:\n\n:<math>  \\mathbf{d^2F} = -\\frac{k I I'} {r^3} \\left[ 2 \\mathbf{r} (\\mathbf{dsds'}) - 3\\mathbf{r} (\\mathbf{r ds}) (\\mathbf{r ds'}) \\right] </math>\n\nIf we take k=+1, we obtain\n\n:<math>  \\mathbf{d^2F} = -\\frac{k I I'} {r^3} \\left[ \\mathbf{r} (\\mathbf{dsds'}) - \\mathbf{ds (r ds')} -\\mathbf{ds'(r ds)} \\right] </math>\n\nUsing the vector identity for the triple cross product, we may express this result as\n\n:<math>  \\mathbf{d^2F} = \\frac{k I I'} {r^3} \\left[ \\left(\\mathbf{ds}\\times\\mathbf{ds'}\\times\\mathbf{r}\\right)+ \\mathbf{ds'(r ds)} \\right] </math>\n\nWhen integrated around ds' the second term is zero, and thus we find the form of Amp\u00e8re's force law given by Maxwell:\n\n:<math>  \\mathbf{F} = k I I' \\int \\int \\frac{\\mathbf{ds}\\times(\\mathbf{ds'}\\times\\mathbf{r})} {|r|^3} </math>\n\n==Derivation of parallel straight wire case from general formula==\n\nStart from the general formula:\n:<math>  \\vec{F}_{12} = \\frac {\\mu_0} {4 \\pi} \\int_{L_1} \\int_{L_2} \\frac {I_1 d \\vec{\\ell}_1\\ \\mathbf{ \\times} \\ (I_2 d  \\vec{\\ell}_2 \\ \\mathbf{ \\times } \\ \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{21} )} {|r|^2}</math>,\nAssume wire 2 is along the x-axis, and wire 1 is at y=D, z=0, parallel to the x-axis. Let <math>x_1,x_2</math> be the x-coordinate of the differential element of wire 1 and wire 2, respectively. In other words, the differential element of wire 1 is at <math>(x_1,D,0)</math> and the differential element of wire 2 is at <math>(x_2,0,0)</math>. By properties of line integrals, <math>d\\vec{\\ell}_1=(dx_1,0,0)</math> and <math>d\\vec{\\ell}_2=(dx_2,0,0)</math>. Also,\n:<math> \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{21} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+D^2}}(x_1-x_2,D,0)</math>\nand\n:<math> |r| = \\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+D^2}</math>\nTherefore, the integral is\n:<math>  \\vec{F}_{12} = \\frac {\\mu_0 I_1 I_2} {4 \\pi} \\int_{L_1} \\int_{L_2} \\frac {(dx_1,0,0)\\ \\mathbf{ \\times} \\ \\left[ (dx_2,0,0) \\ \\mathbf{ \\times } \\ (x_1-x_2,D,0) \\right ] } {|(x_1-x_2)^2+D^2|^{3/2}}</math>.\nEvaluating the cross-product:\n:<math>  \\vec{F}_{12} = \\frac {\\mu_0 I_1 I_2} {4 \\pi} \\int_{L_1} \\int_{L_2} dx_1 dx_2 \\frac {(0,-D,0)} {|(x_1-x_2)^2+D^2|^{3/2}}</math>.\nNext, we integrate <math>x_2</math> from <math>-\\infty</math> to <math>+\\infty</math>:\n:<math>  \\vec{F}_{12} = \\frac {\\mu_0 I_1 I_2} {4 \\pi}\\frac{2}{D}(0,-1,0) \\int_{L_1} dx_1 </math>.\nIf wire 1 is also infinite, the integral diverges, because the ''total'' attractive force between two infinite parallel wires is infinity. In fact, what we really want to know is the attractive force ''per unit length'' of wire 1. Therefore, assume wire 1 has a large but finite length <math>L_1</math>. Then the force vector felt by wire 1 is:\n:<math>  \\vec{F}_{12} = \\frac {\\mu_0 I_1 I_2} {4 \\pi}\\frac{2}{D}(0,-1,0) L_1 </math>.\nAs expected, the force that the wire feels is proportional to its length. The force per unit length is:\n:<math>  \\frac{\\vec{F}_{12}}{L_1} = \\frac {\\mu_0 I_1 I_2} {2 \\pi D}(0,-1,0) </math>.\nThe direction of the force is along the y-axis, representing wire 1 getting pulled towards wire 2 if the currents are parallel, as expected. The magnitude of the force per unit length agrees with the expression for <math>\\frac {F_m} {L}</math> shown above.\n\n==Notable derivations of Amp\u00e8re's force law==\nChronologically ordered:\n*Amp\u00e8re's original 1823 derivation:\n**{{Cite book| publisher = Apeiron| isbn = 978-1-987980-03-5| last1 = Assis| first1 = Andr\u00e9 Koch Torres| last2 = Chaib| first2 = J.

However, towards the end of 1989, Ice Cube found himself at odds with the group's manager, [[Jerry Heller]], after rejecting Heller's proposed contract terms.<ref name=\"Ice Cube 2002\"/>\n\nIce Cube wrote the lyrics to approximately half of both ''Straight Outta Compton'', and Eazy-E's solo album, ''[[Eazy-Duz-It]]'', but he was only paid $32,000 and his contract did not confirm that he was an official member of N.W.A.<ref name=\"Attitude70\">''Ice Cube: Attitude'', Joel McIver, p.70, Foruli Classics, 2012</ref>  This led Ice Cube to leave the group and bring a private lawsuit against Jerry Heller, which was later settled out of court.<ref name=\"Attitude70\"/> In response, the remaining N.W.A members attacked him on the EP ''[[100 Miles and Runnin']]'', and on their next and final album, ''[[Niggaz4Life]]''.\n\n===1989\u2013present: Solo career===\nIn early 1990, Ice Cube recorded his debut solo album, ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'', in New York with [[the Bomb Squad]] ([[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]'s production team). It was released in May 1990 and was an instant hit, riding and contributing to the rising tide of rap's popularity in mainstream society. The album was charged with controversy, and he was accused of misogyny and racism. Subsequently, Ice Cube appointed rapper [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]] (who appeared on ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'') to the head of his own record label and helped produce her debut album, ''[[Make Way for the Motherlode]]''. This was followed by a critically acclaimed role as Doughboy in [[John Singleton]]'s violent crime drama, ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]''. In the same year as ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'', Ice Cube released the acclaimed [[Extended Play|EP]], ''[[Kill At Will]]'' which sold well, becoming the first hip hop EP to go [[Platinum album|Platinum]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\nHis second album ''[[Death Certificate (album)|Death Certificate]]'' was released in 1991. The album was regarded as more focused, yet even more controversial, and critics accused him again of being anti-white, misogynist, and antisemitic. The album is thematically divided into two sides: the 'Death Side' (\"a vision of where we are today\") and the 'Life Side' (\"a vision of where we need to go\"). It features \"[[No Vaseline]]\", a scathing response to N.W.A<nowiki>'s ''100 Miles and Runnin''</nowiki> as well as \"Black Korea,\" a track regarded by some as prophetic of the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], but also interpreted as racist by many.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> Ice Cube toured with [[Lollapalooza]] in 1992, which widened his fan base.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{Cite news|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,4120,140252,00.html|title= Chillin' with Cube|accessdate=June 14, 2007|date=February 25, 2000|work=The Guardian |location=UK }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob at the Ranch Bowl 1993-02-10 (ticket).jpg|thumb|right|A ticket from a 1993 Ice Cube concert in Omaha, Nebraska.]]\nIce Cube released his third album, ''[[The Predator (1992 album)|The Predator]]'', in November 1992. Referring specifically to that year's [[1992 Los Angeles riots|Los Angeles riots]], in the first single, \"[[Wicked (Ice Cube song)|Wicked]]\", he rapped \"April 29 was power to the people, and we might just see a sequel\". ''The Predator'' debuted at number one on both the pop and R&B charts, the first album in history to do so. Singles from ''The Predator'' included \"[[It Was a Good Day]]\" and \"[[Check Yo Self]]\", and the songs had a two-part music video. The album was generally well received by critics and remains his most successful release commercially, with over three million copies sold in the US. However, after ''The Predator'', Ice Cube's rap audience diminished. Cube's fourth album ''[[Lethal Injection (album)|Lethal Injection]]'', which was released at the end of 1993 and represented Ice Cube's first attempt at imitating the [[G-Funk]] sound of Dr. Dre's ''[[The Chronic]]'', was not well received by critics. He had more successful hits from ''Lethal Injection'', including \"[[Really Doe (song)|Really Doe]]\", \"[[Bop Gun (One Nation)]]\", \"[[You Know How We Do It]]\" & \"What Can I Do?\". After 1994, he took a hiatus from music and concentrated on film work and developing the careers of other rap musicians, [[Mack 10]], [[Mr. Short Khop]], [[Kausion]], and [[Da Lench Mob]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\nIn 1994, Ice Cube had reunited with former N.W.A member [[Dr. Dre]], who was now part of [[Death Row Records]], in their duet \"Natural Born Killaz\".<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> In 1998, he released his long-awaited fifth solo album, ''[[War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc)]]''.

Some of the album was used to engage in the [[East Coast\u2013West Coast hip hop rivalry]] of the 1990s. The album's eponymous single reached number 21 on the singles charts, and the album itself was certified [[RIAA Certification|Platinum]] by the end of 1996. With ''Bow Down'', Westside Connection brought their own agenda to the hip hop scene. Ice Cube, Mack 10 and WC had grown tired of being overlooked by most East Coast media outlets; the album was designed to instil a sense of pride in West Coast hip hop fans and to start a larger movement that some people who felt underappreciated might identify with. Songs like \"Bow Down\" and \"Gangstas Make the World Go 'Round\" make reference to this. Ice Cube would also eventually make amends with [[Eazy-E]] shortly before his death in March 1995.\n\nAfter a seven-year hiatus, Westside Connection returned with their second effort ''[[Terrorist Threats]]'' in 2003. The album fared well critically, but its sales fell short of ''Bow Down''. \"Gangsta Nation\" was the only single released from the album, which was produced by [[Fredwreck]] and featured [[Nate Dogg]]; it was a radio hit. After a rift between Ice Cube and Mack 10 about Ice Cube's commitments to film work rather than touring with the group, Westside Connection disbanded.\n\n===1992\u2013present: Collaborations===\nIn 1992, Ice Cube assisted on debut albums from [[Del the Funky Homosapien]] (''[[I Wish My Brother George Was Here]]''), [[Da Lench Mob]] (''[[Guerillas in tha Mist]]'', 1992) and [[Kam (rapper)|Kam]] (''Neva Again'', 1993), all of which enjoyed critical acclaim and some moderate commercial success. He handled most of the production on ''Guerillas in tha Mist''.\n\nIn 1993, Lench Mob member, J-Dee, was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted murder, and Ice Cube did not produce their next album, ''Planet of tha Apes''. Around this time in 1993, he also worked with [[Tupac Shakur]] on his album ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.]],'' appearing on the track \"Last Wordz\" with [[Ice-T]]. He also did a song with Dr. Dre for the first time since he left N.W.A: \"[[Natural Born Killaz]]\", for the ''[[Murder Was The Case]]'' soundtrack, and also contributed to the ''[[Office Space]]'' [[Office Space soundtrack|soundtrack]]. He also featured on Kool G Rap's song \"Two To The Head\" from the Kool G Rap & DJ Polo album \"Live And Let Die\". He also collaborated with [[David Bowie]] and [[Trent Reznor]] from [[Nine Inch Nails]] for a remix of Bowie's \"[[I'm Afraid of Americans]]\". Ice Cube appeared on the song \"[[Children of the Korn]]\" by the band [[Korn]], joining them on the [[Family Values Tour 1998]], and they also collaborated on 'Fuck Dying' from [[War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc)|Cube's fifth album]]. He also lent his voice to British DJ [[Paul Oakenfold]]'s solo debut album, ''[[Bunkka]]'', on the track \"Get Em Up\". Ice Cube appeared in several songs in [[WC (rapper)|WC]] [[Guilty by Affiliation]] like \"Keep it 100\", \"80's babies\" and \"Jack and the bean stalk\". Ice Cube also appeared in [[D.A.Z.

He received beats from West coast veteran producers such as [[DJ Quik]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[E-A-Ski]], and [[Sir Jinx]], not having worked on a solo album with the latter in nearly 20 years. The album was released independently under his label [[Lench Mob Records|Lench Mob]]. Ice Cube has stated that \"being independent is beautiful because we can do things 'out the box'.\" He also signed an upcoming recording artist named 7Tre The Ghost, that record companies would usually frown at. \"Instead of working from a ready-made cookie-cutter marketing plan, we can tailor make a marketing plan specifically for me.\"\n\nIn November 2011, Ice Cube stated via Twitter that he was seven songs into the current album he's recording.

Ice Cube wrote Dr. Dre's and Eazy-E's rhymes for the group's landmark album, ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', released in 1988. However, towards the end of 1989, Ice Cube found himself at odds with the group's manager, [[Jerry Heller]], after rejecting Heller's proposed contract terms.<ref name=\"Ice Cube 2002\"/>\n\nIce Cube wrote the lyrics to approximately half of both ''Straight Outta Compton'', and Eazy-E's solo album, ''[[Eazy-Duz-It]]'', but he was only paid $32,000 and his contract did not confirm that he was an official member of N.W.A.<ref name=\"Attitude70\">''Ice Cube: Attitude'', Joel McIver, p.70, Foruli Classics, 2012</ref>  This led Ice Cube to leave the group and bring a private lawsuit against Jerry Heller, which was later settled out of court.<ref name=\"Attitude70\"/> In response, the remaining N.W.A members attacked him on the EP ''[[100 Miles and Runnin']]'', and on their next and final album, ''[[Niggaz4Life]]''.\n\n===1989\u2013present: Solo career===\nIn early 1990, Ice Cube recorded his debut solo album, ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'', in New York with [[the Bomb Squad]] ([[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]'s production team). It was released in May 1990 and was an instant hit, riding and contributing to the rising tide of rap's popularity in mainstream society. The album was charged with controversy, and he was accused of misogyny and racism. Subsequently, Ice Cube appointed rapper [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]] (who appeared on ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'') to the head of his own record label and helped produce her debut album, ''[[Make Way for the Motherlode]]''. This was followed by a critically acclaimed role as Doughboy in [[John Singleton]]'s violent crime drama, ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]''. In the same year as ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'', Ice Cube released the acclaimed [[Extended Play|EP]], ''[[Kill At Will]]'' which sold well, becoming the first hip hop EP to go [[Platinum album|Platinum]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\nHis second album ''[[Death Certificate (album)|Death Certificate]]'' was released in 1991. The album was regarded as more focused, yet even more controversial, and critics accused him again of being anti-white, misogynist, and antisemitic. The album is thematically divided into two sides: the 'Death Side' (\"a vision of where we are today\") and the 'Life Side' (\"a vision of where we need to go\"). It features \"[[No Vaseline]]\", a scathing response to N.W.A<nowiki>'s ''100 Miles and Runnin''</nowiki> as well as \"Black Korea,\" a track regarded by some as prophetic of the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], but also interpreted as racist by many.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> Ice Cube toured with [[Lollapalooza]] in 1992, which widened his fan base.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{Cite news|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,4120,140252,00.html|title= Chillin' with Cube|accessdate=June 14, 2007|date=February 25, 2000|work=The Guardian |location=UK }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob at the Ranch Bowl 1993-02-10 (ticket).jpg|thumb|right|A ticket from a 1993 Ice Cube concert in Omaha, Nebraska.]]\nIce Cube released his third album, ''[[The Predator (1992 album)|The Predator]]'', in November 1992. Referring specifically to that year's [[1992 Los Angeles riots|Los Angeles riots]], in the first single, \"[[Wicked (Ice Cube song)|Wicked]]\", he rapped \"April 29 was power to the people, and we might just see a sequel\". ''The Predator'' debuted at number one on both the pop and R&B charts, the first album in history to do so. Singles from ''The Predator'' included \"[[It Was a Good Day]]\" and \"[[Check Yo Self]]\", and the songs had a two-part music video. The album was generally well received by critics and remains his most successful release commercially, with over three million copies sold in the US. However, after ''The Predator'', Ice Cube's rap audience diminished. Cube's fourth album ''[[Lethal Injection (album)|Lethal Injection]]'', which was released at the end of 1993 and represented Ice Cube's first attempt at imitating the [[G-Funk]] sound of Dr. Dre's ''[[The Chronic]]'', was not well received by critics. He had more successful hits from ''Lethal Injection'', including \"[[Really Doe (song)|Really Doe]]\", \"[[Bop Gun (One Nation)]]\", \"[[You Know How We Do It]]\" & \"What Can I Do?\". After 1994, he took a hiatus from music and concentrated on film work and developing the careers of other rap musicians, [[Mack 10]], [[Mr. Short Khop]], [[Kausion]], and [[Da Lench Mob]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\nIn 1994, Ice Cube had reunited with former N.W.A member [[Dr. Dre]], who was now part of [[Death Row Records]], in their duet \"Natural Born Killaz\".<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> In 1998, he released his long-awaited fifth solo album, ''[[War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc)]]''.

Some of the album was used to engage in the [[East Coast\u2013West Coast hip hop rivalry]] of the 1990s. The album's eponymous single reached number 21 on the singles charts, and the album itself was certified [[RIAA Certification|Platinum]] by the end of 1996. With ''Bow Down'', Westside Connection brought their own agenda to the hip hop scene. Ice Cube, Mack 10 and WC had grown tired of being overlooked by most East Coast media outlets; the album was designed to instil a sense of pride in West Coast hip hop fans and to start a larger movement that some people who felt underappreciated might identify with. Songs like \"Bow Down\" and \"Gangstas Make the World Go 'Round\" make reference to this. Ice Cube would also eventually make amends with [[Eazy-E]] shortly before his death in March 1995.\n\nAfter a seven-year hiatus, Westside Connection returned with their second effort ''[[Terrorist Threats]]'' in 2003. The album fared well critically, but its sales fell short of ''Bow Down''. \"Gangsta Nation\" was the only single released from the album, which was produced by [[Fredwreck]] and featured [[Nate Dogg]]; it was a radio hit. After a rift between Ice Cube and Mack 10 about Ice Cube's commitments to film work rather than touring with the group, Westside Connection disbanded.\n\n===1992\u2013present: Collaborations===\nIn 1992, Ice Cube assisted on debut albums from [[Del the Funky Homosapien]] (''[[I Wish My Brother George Was Here]]''), [[Da Lench Mob]] (''[[Guerillas in tha Mist]]'', 1992) and [[Kam (rapper)|Kam]] (''Neva Again'', 1993), all of which enjoyed critical acclaim and some moderate commercial success. He handled most of the production on ''Guerillas in tha Mist''.\n\nIn 1993, Lench Mob member, J-Dee, was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted murder, and Ice Cube did not produce their next album, ''Planet of tha Apes''. Around this time in 1993, he also worked with [[Tupac Shakur]] on his album ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.]],'' appearing on the track \"Last Wordz\" with [[Ice-T]]. He also did a song with Dr. Dre for the first time since he left N.W.A: \"[[Natural Born Killaz]]\", for the ''[[Murder Was The Case]]'' soundtrack, and also contributed to the ''[[Office Space]]'' [[Office Space soundtrack|soundtrack]]. He also featured on Kool G Rap's song \"Two To The Head\" from the Kool G Rap & DJ Polo album \"Live And Let Die\". He also collaborated with [[David Bowie]] and [[Trent Reznor]] from [[Nine Inch Nails]] for a remix of Bowie's \"[[I'm Afraid of Americans]]\". Ice Cube appeared on the song \"[[Children of the Korn]]\" by the band [[Korn]], joining them on the [[Family Values Tour 1998]], and they also collaborated on 'Fuck Dying' from [[War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc)|Cube's fifth album]]. He also lent his voice to British DJ [[Paul Oakenfold]]'s solo debut album, ''[[Bunkka]]'', on the track \"Get Em Up\". Ice Cube appeared in several songs in [[WC (rapper)|WC]] [[Guilty by Affiliation]] like \"Keep it 100\", \"80's babies\" and \"Jack and the bean stalk\". Ice Cube also appeared in [[D.A.Z. (album)|D.A.Z.]] in the song \"Iz You Ready to die\" and in [[DJ Quik]] in the song \"Boogie Till You Conk Out\" in 2011.\n\n===2004\u20132012===\n[[File:Ice cube c.jpg|thumb|right|Ice Cube performing live in Metro City Concert Club on October 29, 2010.]]\nIn 2004, he appeared in the [[Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz]] song, \"[[Real Nigga Roll Call]]\".\nIn late 2005, Ice Cube and [[R.

After launching that comeback album, Ice Cube toured across the world to promote it. The tour is known as \"Straight Outta Compton Tour\", and accompanying him is his friend and fellow rapper WC from the Westside Connection. Some places he has recently performed include the Paradiso in [[Amsterdam]] and various venues in England. After touring the U.S. and Europe, he performed all around Australia, from Sydney's [[Enmore Theatre]] to The Forum Arena in Melbourne, before heading to Japan.\n\nIce Cube collaborated with [[Tech N9ne]] on the song \"Blackboy\" that appears on Tech N9ne's July 2008 album ''[[Killer (Tech N9ne album)|Killer]]''.

Ice Cube has stated this album has a different direction than any one of his other albums. He received beats from West coast veteran producers such as [[DJ Quik]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[E-A-Ski]], and [[Sir Jinx]], not having worked on a solo album with the latter in nearly 20 years. The album was released independently under his label [[Lench Mob Records|Lench Mob]]. Ice Cube has stated that \"being independent is beautiful because we can do things 'out the box'.\" He also signed an upcoming recording artist named 7Tre The Ghost, that record companies would usually frown at. \"Instead of working from a ready-made cookie-cutter marketing plan, we can tailor make a marketing plan specifically for me.\"\n\nIn November 2011, Ice Cube stated via Twitter that he was seven songs into the current album he's recording. He also stated he \"always got an album coming out\" which suggests that he isn't thinking of rap retirement to focus on acting in the near future.\n\n===2012\u2013present: ''Everythang's Corrupt''===\nIn 2012, Ice Cube recorded a verse for a remix of the [[Insane Clown Posse]] song \"[[Chris Benoit (song)|Chris Benoit]]\", from ICP's ''[[The Mighty Death Pop!]]'' album, appearing on the album ''[[Mike E.

The poets included: [[Leslie Scalapino]], [[Stephen Rodefer]], [[Bruce Andrews]], [[Charles Bernstein]], [[Ron Silliman]], [[Barrett Watten]], [[Lyn Hejinian]], [[Tom Mandel (poet)|Tom Mandel]], [[Bob Perelman]], [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Alan Davies (poet)|Alan Davies]], [[Carla Harryman]], [[Clark Coolidge]], [[Hannah Weiner]], [[Susan Howe]], and [[Tina Darragh]].\n\nLanguage poetry emphasizes the reader's role in bringing meaning out of a work. It plays down expression, seeing the poem as a construction in and of language itself. In more theoretical terms, it challenges the \"[[nature|natural]]\" presence of a speaker behind the text; and emphasizes the [[disjunction]] and the [[Substance theory|materiality]] of the [[Sign (linguistics)|signifier]].<ref name=\"Kaoirala\">Saroj Koirala (2016), \"[https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/TUJ/article/view/25968 Linking Words with the World: The Language Poetry Mission]\", ''Tribhuvan University Journal'', vol. 29, no. 1, pp. 175-190; here: p. 179. {{doi|10.3126/tuj.v29i1.25968}}. Retrieved 2020-04-11.</ref> These poets favor [[prose poetry]], especially in longer and non-[[narrative]] forms.<ref name=\"Kaoirala\"/>\n\nIn developing their [[poetics]], members of the Language school took as their starting point the emphasis on method evident in the [[modernist poetry|modernist]] tradition, particularly as represented by [[Gertrude Stein]], [[William Carlos Williams]], and [[Louis Zukofsky]]. Language poetry is an example of poetic [[postmodernism]]. Its immediate postmodern precursors were the [[The New American Poetry 1945-1960|New American poets]], a term including the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], the [[Objectivist poets]], the [[Black Mountain poets|Black Mountain School]], the [[Beat generation|Beat]] poets, and the [[San Francisco Renaissance]].\n\nLanguage poetry has been a [[controversy|controversial topic]] in American [[Literature|letters]] from the 1970s to the present. Even the name has been controversial: while a number of poets and critics have used the name of the journal to refer to the group, many others have chosen to use the term, when they used it at all, without the [[equals sign]]s. The terms \"language writing\" and \"language-centered writing\" are also commonly used, and are perhaps the most generic terms. None of the poets associated with the tendency has used the equal signs when referring to the writing collectively. Its use in some critical articles can be taken as an indicator of the author's outsider status.<ref>Michael Greer (Winter/Spring 1989). \"Ideology and Theory in Recent Experimental Writing or, the Naming of 'Language Poetry'\", ''boundary 2'', vol. 16, no. 2/3, pp. 335\u2013355. See also: [[Bob Perelman]], ''The Marginalization of Poetry;'' [[Lyn Hejinian]], ''The Language of Inquiry;'' [[Barrett Watten]], ''The Constructivist Moment;'' [[Ron Silliman]], ''The New Sentence''; and [[Charles Bernstein]], ''My Way: Speeches and Poems.''</ref> There is also debate about whether or not a writer can be called a language poet without being part of that specific coterie; is it a style or is it a group of people?\n\nOnline writing samples of many language poets can be found on internet sites, including blogs and sites maintained by authors and through gateways such as the [[Electronic Poetry Center]], [[PennSound]], and [[UbuWeb]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe movement has been highly decentralized. On the West Coast, an early seed of language poetry was the launch of ''[[This (magazine)|This]]'' magazine, edited by [[Robert Grenier (poet)|Robert Grenier]] and Watten, in 1971. ''[[L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E (magazine)|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E]]'', edited by [[Bruce Andrews]] and [[Charles Bernstein]], ran from 1978 to 1982, and was published in New York. It featured poetics, forums on writers in the movement, and themes such as \"The Politics of Poetry\" and \"Reading Stein\". [[Ron Silliman]]'s poetry newsletter ''Tottel's'' (1970\u201381),<ref>Available online at the ''Eclipse'' archive: [http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/projects/TOTTELS/ ''Tottel's Magazine''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807171904/http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/projects/TOTTELS/ |date=2007-08-07 }}.</ref> [[Bruce Andrews]]'s selections in a special issue of ''Toopick'' (1973), as well as [[Lyn Hejinian]]'s editing of Tuumba Press, and James Sherry's editing of ROOF magazine also contributed to the development of ideas in language poetry. The first significant collection of language-centered poetics was the article, \"The Politics of the Referent,\" edited by [[Steve McCaffery]] for the Toronto-based publication, ''Open Letter'' (1977).\n\nIn an essay from the first issue of ''This'', Grenier declared: \"I HATE SPEECH\". Grenier's ironic statement (itself a speech act), and a questioning attitude to the referentiality of language, became central to language poets. Ron Silliman, in the introduction to his anthology ''In the American Tree,'' appealed to a number of young U.S. poets who were dissatisfied with the work of the [[Black Mountain poets|Black Mountain]] and [[Beat generation|Beat]] poets.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 90%; background:#CC9966; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | \n\"I HATE SPEECH\" \u2014 '''Robert Grenier'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" | \n: \"Thus capitalized, these words in an essay entitled \"On Speech,\" the second of five short critical pieces by Robert Grenier in the first issue of ''This'', the magazine he cofounded with Barrett Watten in winter, 1971, announced a breach \u2013 and a new moment in American writing.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" | '''Ron Silliman'''<ref>\"Introduction: Language, Realism, Poetry,\" ''In The American Tree'' (See below \"Further reading: Anthologies\")</ref>\n|}\n\nThe range of poetry published that focused on \"[[Philosophy of language|language]]\" in ''This,'' ''Tottel's,'' ''L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E'', and also in several other key publications and essays of the time, established the field of discussion that would emerge as Language (or L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E) poetry.\n\nDuring the 1970s, a number of magazines published poets who would become associated with the Language movement. These included ''A Hundred Posters'' (edited by [[Alan Davies (poet)|Alan Davies]]), ''Big Deal,'' ''Dog City,'' ''Hills,'' ''L\u00e0 Bas,'' ''MIAM,'' ''Oculist Witnesses,'' ''QU,'' and ''Roof.'' ''[[Poetics Journal]],'' which published writings in poetics and was edited by [[Lyn Hejinian]] and [[Barrett Watten]], appeared from 1982 to 1998. Significant early gatherings of Language writing included Bruce Andrews's selection in ''Toopick'' (1973); Silliman's selection \"The Dwelling Place: 9 Poets\" in ''Alcheringa,'' (1975), and Charles Bernstein's \"A Language Sampler,\" in ''The Paris Review'' (1982).\n\nCertain poetry reading series, especially in New York, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco, were important venues for the performance of this new work, and for the development of dialogue and collaboration among poets. Most important were Ear Inn reading series in New York, founded in 1978 by Ted Greenwald and Charles Bernstein and later organized through James Sherry's Segue Foundation and curated by Mitch Highfill, Jeanne Lance, Andrew Levy, Rob Fitterman, Laynie Brown, Alan Davies, and [[The Poetry Society of New York]]; Folio Books in Washington, D.C., founded by Doug Lang; and the Grand Piano reading series in San Francisco, which was curated by [[Barrett Watten]], [[Ron Silliman]], [[Tom Mandel (poet)|Tom Mandel]], [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Ted Pearson]], [[Carla Harryman]], and [[Steve Benson (poet)|Steve Benson]] at various times.\n\nPoets, some of whom have been mentioned above, who were associated with the first wave of Language poetry include: [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Stephen Rodefer]] (1940\u20132015), [[Steve Benson (poet)|Steve Benson]], [[Abigail Child]], [[Clark Coolidge]], [[Tina Darragh]], [[Alan Davies (poet)|Alan Davies]], [[Carla Harryman]], [[P. Inman]], [[Lynne Dryer]], [[Madeline Gins]], [[Michael Gottlieb (poet)|Michael Gottlieb]], [[Fanny Howe]], [[Susan Howe]], [[Jackson Mac Low]] (1922\u20132004), [[Tom Mandel (poet)|Tom Mandel]], [[Bernadette Mayer]], [[Steve McCaffery]], [[Michael Palmer (poet)|Michael Palmer]], [[Ted Pearson]], [[Bob Perelman]], [[Nick Piombino]], [[Peter Seaton]] (1942\u20132010), [[Joan Retallack]], [[Erica Hunt]], [[James Sherry (poet)|James Sherry]], [[Jean Day]], [[Kit Robinson]], [[Ted Greenwald]], [[Leslie Scalapino]] (1944\u20132010), [[Diane Ward]], [[Rosmarie Waldrop]], and [[Hannah Weiner]] (1928\u20131997). This list accurately reflects the high proportion of [[List of women poets|female poets]] across the spectrum of the Language writing movement.<ref>{{citation|author=Ann Vickery|title=Leaving Lines of Gender: A Feminist Genealogy of Language Writing|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|year=2000}}</ref> [[African-American literature|African-American poets]] associated with the movement include Hunt, [[Nathaniel Mackey]], and [[Harryette Mullen]].\n\n==Poetics of language writing: theory and practice==\nLanguage poetry emphasizes the reader's role in bringing meaning out of a work. It developed in part in response to what poets considered the uncritical use of expressive lyric sentiment among earlier poetry movements. In the 1950s and 1960s, certain groups of poets had followed [[William Carlos Williams]] in his use of [[idiomatic]] American English rather than what they considered the 'heightened', or overtly poetic language favored by the [[New Criticism]] movement. [[New York School (art)|New York School]] poets like [[Frank O'Hara]] and [[Black Mountain poets|the Black Mountain group]] emphasized both speech and everyday language in their poetry and poetics.\n\nIn contrast, some of the Language poets emphasized [[metonymy]], [[synecdoche]] and extreme instances of [[parataxis|paratactical]] structures in their compositions, which, even when employing everyday speech, created a far different texture. The result is often alien and difficult to understand at first glance, which is what Language poetry intends: for the reader to participate in creating the meaning of the poem.<ref>See, for example, [[Ronald Johnson (poet)|Ronald Johnson]]'s ''RADI OS'' in  [http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/projects/LANGUAGEn1/pictures/007.shtml L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, volume 1].</ref>\n\nWatten's & Grenier's magazine '''[[This (magazine)|This]]''' (and '''[[This Press]]''' which Watten edited), along with the magazine ''L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E'', published work by notable [[Black Mountain poets]] such as [[Robert Creeley]] and [[Larry Eigner]]. Silliman considers Language poetry to be a continuation (albeit incorporating a critique) of the earlier movements. Watten has emphasized the discontinuity between the [[The New American Poetry 1945-1960|New American poets]], whose writing, he argues, privileged self-expression, and the Language poets, who see the poem as a construction in and of language itself. In contrast, Bernstein has emphasized the expressive possibilities of working with constructed, and even found, language.\n\n[[Gertrude Stein]], particularly in her writing after ''Tender Buttons,'' and [[Louis Zukofsky]], in his book-length poem ''A,'' are the modernist poets who most influenced the Language school. In the postwar period, [[John Cage]], [[Jackson Mac Low]], and poets of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] ([[John Ashbery]], [[Frank O'Hara]], [[Ted Berrigan]]) and [[Black Mountain poets|Black Mountain School]] ([[Robert Creeley]], [[Charles Olson]], and [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]]) are most recognizable as precursors to the Language poets. Many of these poets used procedural methods based on mathematical sequences and other logical organising devices to structure their poetry. This practice proved highly useful to the language group. The application of process, especially at the level of the [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], was to become the basic tenet of language [[Praxis (process)|praxis]]. Stein's influence was related to her own frequent use of language divorced from reference in her own writings. The language poets also drew on the philosophical works of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], especially the concepts of [[language-game]]s, meaning as use, and [[family resemblance]] among different uses, as the solution to the [[Problem of universals]].\n\n===Language poetry in the early 21st century===\nIn many ways, what Language poetry is <!-- not a mistake-->is still being determined. Most of the poets whose work falls within the bounds of the Language school are still alive and still active contributors. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Language poetry was widely received as a significant movement in innovative poetry in the U.S., a trend accentuated by the fact that some of its leading proponents took up academic posts in the [[Poetics]], [[Creative Writing]] and [[English Literature]] departments in prominent universities ([[University of Pennsylvania]], [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|SUNY Buffalo]], [[Wayne State University]], [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[University of California, San Diego]], [[University of Maine]], the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]]).\n\nLanguage poetry also developed affiliations with literary scenes outside the States, notably England, Canada (through the [[Kootenay school of writing]] in Vancouver), [[French literature|France]], the [[USSR]], [[Brazil]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Australia]]. It had a particularly interesting relation to the UK ''[[avant-garde]]'': in the 1970s and 1980s there were extensive contacts between American Language poets and veteran UK writers like [[Tom Raworth]] and [[Allen Fisher]], or younger figures such as [[Caroline Bergvall]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[cris cheek]], and [[Ken Edwards]] (whose magazine ''Reality Studios'' was instrumental in the transatlantic dialogue between American and UK ''avant-garde''s). Other writers, such as [[J.H. Prynne]] and those associated with the so-called [[British Poetry Revival#Cambridge|\"Cambridge\" poetry scene]] ([[Rod Mengham]], [[Douglas Oliver]], [[Peter Riley]]) were perhaps more skeptical about language poetry and its associated [[polemics]] and theoretical documents, though Geoff Ward wrote a book about the phenomena.\n\nA second generation of poets influenced by the Language poets includes [[Eric Selland]] (also a noted translator of modern Japanese poetry), [[Lisa Robertson (poet)|Lisa Robertson]], [[Juliana Spahr]], the [[Kootenay School]] poets, [[conceptual writing]], [[Flarf]] collectives, and many others.\n\nA significant number of women poets, and magazines and anthologies of innovative women's poetry, have been associated with language poetry on both sides of the Atlantic. They often represent a distinct set of concerns. Among the poets are [[Leslie Scalapino]], [[Madeline Gins]], [[Susan Howe]], [[Lyn Hejinian]], [[Carla Harryman]], [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Jean Day]], [[Hannah Weiner]], [[Tina Darragh]], [[Erica Hunt]], [[Lynne Dreyer]], [[Harryette Mullen]], [[Beverly Dahlen]], [[Johanna Drucker]], [[Abigail Child]], and [[Karen Mac Cormack]]; among the magazines [[HOW/ever]], later the e-based journal [[HOW2]]; and among the anthologies ''[[Out of Everywhere: Linguistically Innovative Poetry by Women in North America & the UK]],'' edited by Maggie O'Sullivan for Reality Street Editions in London (1996) and Mary Margaret Sloan's ''[[Moving Borders: Three Decades of Innovative Writing by Women]]'' (Jersey City: Talisman Publishers, 1998).\n\nTen of the Language poets, each of whom at one time curated the reading series at the San Francisco coffee house of that name, collaborated to write ''The Grand Piano'', \"an experiment in collective autobiography\" published in ten small volumes. Editing and communication for the collaboration was accomplished over email. Authors of The Grand Piano were [[Lyn Hejinian]], [[Carla Harryman]], [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Tom Mandel (poet) |Tom Mandel]], [[Ron Silliman]], [[Barrett Watten]], [[Steve Benson (poet) |Steve Benson]], [[Bob Perelman]], [[Ted Pearson]], and [[Kit Robinson]]. An eleventh member of the project, [[Alan Bernheimer]], served as an archivist and contributed one essay on the filmmaker [[Warren Sonbert]]. The authors of The Grand Piano sought to reconnect their writing practices and to \"recall and contextualize events from the period of the late 1970s.\"<ref>Barrett Watten, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070630065810/http://www.english.wayne.edu/fac_pages/ewatten/posts/post34.html \"How ''The Grand Piano'' Is Being Written\"], archived from the [http://www.english.wayne.edu/fac_pages/ewatten/posts/post34.html original] on 2007-06-30.

Finkelstein, in a discussion with Mark Scroggins about ''The Grand Piano'', points to a \"risk\" when previously marginalized poets try to write their own literary histories, \"not the least of which is a self-regard bordering on narcissism\".<ref>Mark Scroggin (April 2007), [http://kulturindustrie.blogspot.com/2007/04/toy-piano.html \"The Toy Piano\"], ''Culture Industry'' blog, with commentary by Norman Finkelstein.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of poetry groups and movements]]\n* [[List of literary movements]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n==Further reading==\n\n===Anthologies===\n*[[Donald Allen|Allen, Donald]], ed.

On the West Coast, an early seed of language poetry was the launch of ''[[This (magazine)|This]]'' magazine, edited by [[Robert Grenier (poet)|Robert Grenier]] and Watten, in 1971. ''[[L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E (magazine)|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E]]'', edited by [[Bruce Andrews]] and [[Charles Bernstein]], ran from 1978 to 1982, and was published in New York. It featured poetics, forums on writers in the movement, and themes such as \"The Politics of Poetry\" and \"Reading Stein\". [[Ron Silliman]]'s poetry newsletter ''Tottel's'' (1970\u201381),<ref>Available online at the ''Eclipse'' archive: [http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/projects/TOTTELS/ ''Tottel's Magazine''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807171904/http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/projects/TOTTELS/ |date=2007-08-07 }}.</ref> [[Bruce Andrews]]'s selections in a special issue of ''Toopick'' (1973), as well as [[Lyn Hejinian]]'s editing of Tuumba Press, and James Sherry's editing of ROOF magazine also contributed to the development of ideas in language poetry. The first significant collection of language-centered poetics was the article, \"The Politics of the Referent,\" edited by [[Steve McCaffery]] for the Toronto-based publication, ''Open Letter'' (1977).\n\nIn an essay from the first issue of ''This'', Grenier declared: \"I HATE SPEECH\". Grenier's ironic statement (itself a speech act), and a questioning attitude to the referentiality of language, became central to language poets. Ron Silliman, in the introduction to his anthology ''In the American Tree,'' appealed to a number of young U.S. poets who were dissatisfied with the work of the [[Black Mountain poets|Black Mountain]] and [[Beat generation|Beat]] poets.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 90%; background:#CC9966; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | \n\"I HATE SPEECH\" \u2014 '''Robert Grenier'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" | \n: \"Thus capitalized, these words in an essay entitled \"On Speech,\" the second of five short critical pieces by Robert Grenier in the first issue of ''This'', the magazine he cofounded with Barrett Watten in winter, 1971, announced a breach \u2013 and a new moment in American writing.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" | '''Ron Silliman'''<ref>\"Introduction: Language, Realism, Poetry,\" ''In The American Tree'' (See below \"Further reading: Anthologies\")</ref>\n|}\n\nThe range of poetry published that focused on \"[[Philosophy of language|language]]\" in ''This,'' ''Tottel's,'' ''L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E'', and also in several other key publications and essays of the time, established the field of discussion that would emerge as Language (or L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E) poetry.\n\nDuring the 1970s, a number of magazines published poets who would become associated with the Language movement. These included ''A Hundred Posters'' (edited by [[Alan Davies (poet)|Alan Davies]]), ''Big Deal,'' ''Dog City,'' ''Hills,'' ''L\u00e0 Bas,'' ''MIAM,'' ''Oculist Witnesses,'' ''QU,'' and ''Roof.'' ''[[Poetics Journal]],'' which published writings in poetics and was edited by [[Lyn Hejinian]] and [[Barrett Watten]], appeared from 1982 to 1998. Significant early gatherings of Language writing included Bruce Andrews's selection in ''Toopick'' (1973); Silliman's selection \"The Dwelling Place: 9 Poets\" in ''Alcheringa,'' (1975), and Charles Bernstein's \"A Language Sampler,\" in ''The Paris Review'' (1982).\n\nCertain poetry reading series, especially in New York, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco, were important venues for the performance of this new work, and for the development of dialogue and collaboration among poets. Most important were Ear Inn reading series in New York, founded in 1978 by Ted Greenwald and Charles Bernstein and later organized through James Sherry's Segue Foundation and curated by Mitch Highfill, Jeanne Lance, Andrew Levy, Rob Fitterman, Laynie Brown, Alan Davies, and [[The Poetry Society of New York]]; Folio Books in Washington, D.C., founded by Doug Lang; and the Grand Piano reading series in San Francisco, which was curated by [[Barrett Watten]], [[Ron Silliman]], [[Tom Mandel (poet)|Tom Mandel]], [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Ted Pearson]], [[Carla Harryman]], and [[Steve Benson (poet)|Steve Benson]] at various times.\n\nPoets, some of whom have been mentioned above, who were associated with the first wave of Language poetry include: [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Stephen Rodefer]] (1940\u20132015), [[Steve Benson (poet)|Steve Benson]], [[Abigail Child]], [[Clark Coolidge]], [[Tina Darragh]], [[Alan Davies (poet)|Alan Davies]], [[Carla Harryman]], [[P. Inman]], [[Lynne Dryer]], [[Madeline Gins]], [[Michael Gottlieb (poet)|Michael Gottlieb]], [[Fanny Howe]], [[Susan Howe]], [[Jackson Mac Low]] (1922\u20132004), [[Tom Mandel (poet)|Tom Mandel]], [[Bernadette Mayer]], [[Steve McCaffery]], [[Michael Palmer (poet)|Michael Palmer]], [[Ted Pearson]], [[Bob Perelman]], [[Nick Piombino]], [[Peter Seaton]] (1942\u20132010), [[Joan Retallack]], [[Erica Hunt]], [[James Sherry (poet)|James Sherry]], [[Jean Day]], [[Kit Robinson]], [[Ted Greenwald]], [[Leslie Scalapino]] (1944\u20132010), [[Diane Ward]], [[Rosmarie Waldrop]], and [[Hannah Weiner]] (1928\u20131997). This list accurately reflects the high proportion of [[List of women poets|female poets]] across the spectrum of the Language writing movement.<ref>{{citation|author=Ann Vickery|title=Leaving Lines of Gender: A Feminist Genealogy of Language Writing|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|year=2000}}</ref> [[African-American literature|African-American poets]] associated with the movement include Hunt, [[Nathaniel Mackey]], and [[Harryette Mullen]].\n\n==Poetics of language writing: theory and practice==\nLanguage poetry emphasizes the reader's role in bringing meaning out of a work. It developed in part in response to what poets considered the uncritical use of expressive lyric sentiment among earlier poetry movements. In the 1950s and 1960s, certain groups of poets had followed [[William Carlos Williams]] in his use of [[idiomatic]] American English rather than what they considered the 'heightened', or overtly poetic language favored by the [[New Criticism]] movement. [[New York School (art)|New York School]] poets like [[Frank O'Hara]] and [[Black Mountain poets|the Black Mountain group]] emphasized both speech and everyday language in their poetry and poetics.\n\nIn contrast, some of the Language poets emphasized [[metonymy]], [[synecdoche]] and extreme instances of [[parataxis|paratactical]] structures in their compositions, which, even when employing everyday speech, created a far different texture. The result is often alien and difficult to understand at first glance, which is what Language poetry intends: for the reader to participate in creating the meaning of the poem.<ref>See, for example, [[Ronald Johnson (poet)|Ronald Johnson]]'s ''RADI OS'' in  [http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/projects/LANGUAGEn1/pictures/007.shtml L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, volume 1].</ref>\n\nWatten's & Grenier's magazine '''[[This (magazine)|This]]''' (and '''[[This Press]]''' which Watten edited), along with the magazine ''L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E'', published work by notable [[Black Mountain poets]] such as [[Robert Creeley]] and [[Larry Eigner]]. Silliman considers Language poetry to be a continuation (albeit incorporating a critique) of the earlier movements. Watten has emphasized the discontinuity between the [[The New American Poetry 1945-1960|New American poets]], whose writing, he argues, privileged self-expression, and the Language poets, who see the poem as a construction in and of language itself. In contrast, Bernstein has emphasized the expressive possibilities of working with constructed, and even found, language.\n\n[[Gertrude Stein]], particularly in her writing after ''Tender Buttons,'' and [[Louis Zukofsky]], in his book-length poem ''A,'' are the modernist poets who most influenced the Language school. In the postwar period, [[John Cage]], [[Jackson Mac Low]], and poets of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] ([[John Ashbery]], [[Frank O'Hara]], [[Ted Berrigan]]) and [[Black Mountain poets|Black Mountain School]] ([[Robert Creeley]], [[Charles Olson]], and [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]]) are most recognizable as precursors to the Language poets. Many of these poets used procedural methods based on mathematical sequences and other logical organising devices to structure their poetry. This practice proved highly useful to the language group. The application of process, especially at the level of the [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], was to become the basic tenet of language [[Praxis (process)|praxis]]. Stein's influence was related to her own frequent use of language divorced from reference in her own writings. The language poets also drew on the philosophical works of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], especially the concepts of [[language-game]]s, meaning as use, and [[family resemblance]] among different uses, as the solution to the [[Problem of universals]].\n\n===Language poetry in the early 21st century===\nIn many ways, what Language poetry is <!-- not a mistake-->is still being determined. Most of the poets whose work falls within the bounds of the Language school are still alive and still active contributors. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Language poetry was widely received as a significant movement in innovative poetry in the U.S., a trend accentuated by the fact that some of its leading proponents took up academic posts in the [[Poetics]], [[Creative Writing]] and [[English Literature]] departments in prominent universities ([[University of Pennsylvania]], [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|SUNY Buffalo]], [[Wayne State University]], [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[University of California, San Diego]], [[University of Maine]], the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]]).\n\nLanguage poetry also developed affiliations with literary scenes outside the States, notably England, Canada (through the [[Kootenay school of writing]] in Vancouver), [[French literature|France]], the [[USSR]], [[Brazil]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Australia]]. It had a particularly interesting relation to the UK ''[[avant-garde]]'': in the 1970s and 1980s there were extensive contacts between American Language poets and veteran UK writers like [[Tom Raworth]] and [[Allen Fisher]], or younger figures such as [[Caroline Bergvall]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[cris cheek]], and [[Ken Edwards]] (whose magazine ''Reality Studios'' was instrumental in the transatlantic dialogue between American and UK ''avant-garde''s). Other writers, such as [[J.H. Prynne]] and those associated with the so-called [[British Poetry Revival#Cambridge|\"Cambridge\" poetry scene]] ([[Rod Mengham]], [[Douglas Oliver]], [[Peter Riley]]) were perhaps more skeptical about language poetry and its associated [[polemics]] and theoretical documents, though Geoff Ward wrote a book about the phenomena.\n\nA second generation of poets influenced by the Language poets includes [[Eric Selland]] (also a noted translator of modern Japanese poetry), [[Lisa Robertson (poet)|Lisa Robertson]], [[Juliana Spahr]], the [[Kootenay School]] poets, [[conceptual writing]], [[Flarf]] collectives, and many others.\n\nA significant number of women poets, and magazines and anthologies of innovative women's poetry, have been associated with language poetry on both sides of the Atlantic. They often represent a distinct set of concerns. Among the poets are [[Leslie Scalapino]], [[Madeline Gins]], [[Susan Howe]], [[Lyn Hejinian]], [[Carla Harryman]], [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Jean Day]], [[Hannah Weiner]], [[Tina Darragh]], [[Erica Hunt]], [[Lynne Dreyer]], [[Harryette Mullen]], [[Beverly Dahlen]], [[Johanna Drucker]], [[Abigail Child]], and [[Karen Mac Cormack]]; among the magazines [[HOW/ever]], later the e-based journal [[HOW2]]; and among the anthologies ''[[Out of Everywhere: Linguistically Innovative Poetry by Women in North America & the UK]],'' edited by Maggie O'Sullivan for Reality Street Editions in London (1996) and Mary Margaret Sloan's ''[[Moving Borders: Three Decades of Innovative Writing by Women]]'' (Jersey City: Talisman Publishers, 1998).\n\nTen of the Language poets, each of whom at one time curated the reading series at the San Francisco coffee house of that name, collaborated to write ''The Grand Piano'', \"an experiment in collective autobiography\" published in ten small volumes. Editing and communication for the collaboration was accomplished over email. Authors of The Grand Piano were [[Lyn Hejinian]], [[Carla Harryman]], [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Tom Mandel (poet) |Tom Mandel]], [[Ron Silliman]], [[Barrett Watten]], [[Steve Benson (poet) |Steve Benson]], [[Bob Perelman]], [[Ted Pearson]], and [[Kit Robinson]]. An eleventh member of the project, [[Alan Bernheimer]], served as an archivist and contributed one essay on the filmmaker [[Warren Sonbert]]. The authors of The Grand Piano sought to reconnect their writing practices and to \"recall and contextualize events from the period of the late 1970s.\"<ref>Barrett Watten, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070630065810/http://www.english.wayne.edu/fac_pages/ewatten/posts/post34.html \"How ''The Grand Piano'' Is Being Written\"], archived from the [http://www.english.wayne.edu/fac_pages/ewatten/posts/post34.html original] on 2007-06-30.

Retrieved 2020-04-12.</ref> Each volume of ''The Grand Piano'' features essays by all ten authors in different sequence; often responding to prompts and problems arising from one another's essays in the series.\n\nSome poets, such as [[Norman Finkelstein (poet)|Norman Finkelstein]], have stressed their own ambiguous relationship to \"Language poetry\", even after decades of fruitful engagement. Finkelstein, in a discussion with Mark Scroggins about ''The Grand Piano'', points to a \"risk\" when previously marginalized poets try to write their own literary histories, \"not the least of which is a self-regard bordering on narcissism\".<ref>Mark Scroggin (April 2007), [http://kulturindustrie.blogspot.com/2007/04/toy-piano.html \"The Toy Piano\"], ''Culture Industry'' blog, with commentary by Norman Finkelstein.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of poetry groups and movements]]\n* [[List of literary movements]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n==Further reading==\n\n===Anthologies===\n*[[Donald Allen|Allen, Donald]], ed.
