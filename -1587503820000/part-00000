Although it is also suggested Lord Derby did not give the land away - he didn't own it in the first place.\n\nThe area called Norris Green was a farming estate; it stretched as far as Stone Bridge House to the north and Norris Green Farm (opposite the junction of Hornspit Lane and Almonds Green) to the south. The sale boundary in the 1920s consisted of the railway, Carr Lane, Dwerryhouse Lane and Hornspit Lane. It was bought by the council for the sum of \u00a365,000 from the estate of Leyland & Naylor.\n\n==Geography==\nThe area is defined by a number of major thoroughfares. These are: the [[A580 road|A580 East Lancashire Road]] and a small portion of Walton Hall Avenue to the north; Lowerhouse Lane and Dwerryhouse Lane to the east; Muirhead Avenue and [[Queens Drive]] to the south and Townsend Avenue back to Walton Hall Avenue to the west.\n\nThe area is bordered by [[Walton, Merseyside|Walton]] to the west, [[Fazakerley]] to the north, [[Croxteth]] to the north east and east, [[West Derby]] to the south and [[Clubmoor]] to the south-west\n\nNorris Green's district centre is known locally as \"Broadway\", consisting of mainly shops found around Broadway and Broad Lane (though this is actually located in neighbouring Clubmoor ward). The former [[North Liverpool Extension Line]] runs past this area and includes Broadway Bridge.\n\nThere are no actual pubs in the main residential area, but a small number of public houses do exist particularly around the vicinity of Broadway shops.\n\n==Housing==\nHomes on the periphery of the estate and on the main routes through the area are largely brick and well-built, with those on minor routes and residential roads made of concrete. It is this concrete group of housing that is considered defective.\n\nThe estate was subject to large-scale upgrading and renovation in the early 1970s, when it was still almost entirely under local authority ownership. This was several years before the introduction of the [[right to buy scheme]], which gave council tenants the right to buy their homes from local authorities.\n\nA number of new homes are planned to be constructed on derelict land cleared following the demolition of defective houses on the \"[[Boot house|Boot Estate]]\". Most of these demolitions took place around 2000.\n\n[[File:Broadway , Norris Green - geograph.org.uk - 37438.jpg|thumb|right|Broadway, Norris Green]]\n\n==Landmarks==\nThe most notable landmark when approaching Norris Green from the north or west is the large former Cheshire Lines railway bridge, on the former Loop Line, crossing the junction of Utting Avenue and Townsend Avenue from north to south. A 1930s [[art deco]] public library is also widely recognised. The exterior and interior of Norris Green Youth Centre have been refurbished; this 2011 refurbishment, supported by the annual charity event ''[[Children in Need]]'', was featured on [[BBC Television]]'s ''[[DIY SOS]]''.\n\n==Transport==\nThere are a number of frequent bus services to and from Liverpool city centre via Norris Green and the Broadway area. The No.14 (will accept both Arriva or Stagecoach bus tickets or passes) bus is the main bus route running from the city centre to Willow Way, Croxteth. A major cross city bus route, the 61 [[Aigburth]] to [[Seaforth, Merseyside|Seaforth]] bus service also passes through the area. \nA project to provide a tram service, [[Merseytram]], was abandoned due to a lack of funds.\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Peter Byrne (philosopher)]] \n* [[Steve Coppell]], former [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] football player and former manager of [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], was born here.\n* [[Shaun Duggan]], writer, was born and grew up in the area.\n*[[Howard Gayle]], footballer\n* Actor [[Geoffrey Hughes]], who found fame in ''[[Coronation Street]]'', and later ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]'' and ''[[Keeping Up Appearances]]'', was born in Norris Green.\n* [[Holly Johnson]] and other members of [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]].\n*[[Chris Lawler]], footballer for [[Liverpool FC]] \n* [[Ian McCulloch (singer)|Ian McCulloch]], lead singer of the prominent Liverpool band [[Echo & the Bunnymen]] grew up on Parthenon Drive in Norris Green.

This was several years before the introduction of the [[right to buy scheme]], which gave council tenants the right to buy their homes from local authorities.\n\nA number of new homes are planned to be constructed on derelict land cleared following the demolition of defective houses on the \"[[Boot house|Boot Estate]]\". Most of these demolitions took place around 2000.\n\n[[File:Broadway , Norris Green - geograph.org.uk - 37438.jpg|thumb|right|Broadway, Norris Green]]\n\n==Landmarks==\nThe most notable landmark when approaching Norris Green from the north or west is the large former Cheshire Lines railway bridge, on the former Loop Line, crossing the junction of Utting Avenue and Townsend Avenue from north to south. A 1930s [[art deco]] public library is also widely recognised. The exterior and interior of Norris Green Youth Centre have been refurbished; this 2011 refurbishment, supported by the annual charity event ''[[Children in Need]]'', was featured on [[BBC Television]]'s ''[[DIY SOS]]''.\n\n==Transport==\nThere are a number of frequent bus services to and from Liverpool city centre via Norris Green and the Broadway area. The No.14 (will accept both Arriva or Stagecoach bus tickets or passes) bus is the main bus route running from the city centre to Willow Way, Croxteth. A major cross city bus route, the 61 [[Aigburth]] to [[Seaforth, Merseyside|Seaforth]] bus service also passes through the area. \nA project to provide a tram service, [[Merseytram]], was abandoned due to a lack of funds.\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Peter Byrne (philosopher)]] \n* [[Steve Coppell]], former [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] football player and former manager of [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], was born here.\n* [[Shaun Duggan]], writer, was born and grew up in the area.\n*[[Howard Gayle]], footballer\n* Actor [[Geoffrey Hughes]], who found fame in ''[[Coronation Street]]'', and later ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]'' and ''[[Keeping Up Appearances]]'', was born in Norris Green.\n* [[Holly Johnson]] and other members of [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]].\n*[[Chris Lawler]], footballer for [[Liverpool FC]] \n* [[Ian McCulloch (singer)|Ian McCulloch]], lead singer of the prominent Liverpool band [[Echo & the Bunnymen]] grew up on Parthenon Drive in Norris Green.

One is called the \"On-Off-On\" model.<ref name=\":13\" /> When naive T cells are activated by [[T-cell receptor|T cell receptor]] (TCR) binding to antigen and its downstream signaling pathway, they actively proliferate and form a large clone of effector cells. Effector cells undergo active [[cytokine]] secretion and other effector activities.<ref name=\":05\" /> After [[antigen]] clearance, some of these effector cells form memory T cells, either in a randomly determined manner or are selected based on their superior specificity.<ref name=\":05\" /> These cells would reverse from the active effector role to a state more similar to naive T cells and would be \"turned on\" again upon the next antigen exposure.<ref name=\":22\" /> This model predicts that effector T cells can transit into memory T cells and survive, retaining the ability to proliferate.<ref name=\":05\" /> It also predicts that certain gene expression profile would follow the on-off-on pattern during naive, effector and memory stages.<ref name=\":22\" /> Evidence supporting this model includes the finding of genes related to survival and homing that follow the on-off-on expression pattern, including interleukin-7 receptor alpha (IL-7R\u03b1), Bcl-2, CD26L and others.<ref name=\":22\" />\n[[File:A picture for the developmental differentiation model for memory T cell lineage.png|thumb|\"Developmental differentiation model\"In this model, memory T cells generate effector T cells, not the other way around.]]\nThe other model is the developmental differentiation model.<ref name=\":13\" /> This model argues that effector cells produced by the highly activated naive T cells would all undergo apoptosis after antigen clearance.<ref name=\":05\" /> Memory T cells are instead produced by naive T cells that are activated, but never entered with full-strength into the effector stage.<ref name=\":05\" /> The progeny of memory T cells are not fully activated because they are not as specific to the antigen as the expanding effector T cells. Studies looking at cell division history found that the length of telomere and activity of telomerase were reduced in effector T cells comparing to memory T cells, which suggests that memory T cells did not undergo as much cell division as effector T cells, which is inconsistent with the \"On-Off-On\" model.<ref name=\":05\" /> Repeated or chronic antigenic stimulation of T cells, like [[HIV/AIDS|HIV infection]], would induce elevated effector functions but reduce memory.<ref name=\":13\" /> It was also found that massively proliferated T cells are more likely to generate short-lived effector cells, while minimally proliferated T cells would form more long-lived cells.<ref name=\":05\" />\n== Epigenetic modifications ==\nPart of what allows memory T cells to mount a faster and stronger immune response are [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] modifications on their genome that make them different from native T cells.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmidl C, Delacher M, Huehn J, Feuerer M | title = Epigenetic mechanisms regulating T-cell responses | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 142 | issue = 3 | pages = 728\u2013743 | date = September 2018 | pmid = 30195378 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2018.07.014 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Epigenetic modifications are modifications on the DNA or chromatin proteins without changing the DNA sequence itself.

Since memory T cells have shorter half-lives than naive T cells do, continuous replication and replacement of old cells is likely involved in the maintenance process.<ref name=\"Farber_2014\"> Currently, the mechanism behind memory T cell maintenance is not fully understood. Activation through T cell receptor may play a role.<ref name=\"Farber_2014\" /> It is found that memory T cells can sometimes react to novel antigens, potentially caused by intrinsic diversity and breadth of the T cell receptor binding targets.<ref name=\"Farber_2014\" /> These T cells could cross-react to environmental or resident antigens in our bodies (like bacteria in our gut) and proliferated. These events would help maintain the memory T cell population.<ref name=\"Farber_2014\" /> The cross-reactivity mechanism may be important for memory T cells at the mucosal tissues since these sites have higher antigen density.<ref name=\"Farber_2014\" /> For those resident in blood, bone marrow, lymphoid tissues and spleen, homeostatic cytokines (including [[IL 17 family|IL-17]] and [[Interleukin-15 receptor|IL-15]]) or [[Major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ alpha 1|major histocompatibility complex II]] (MHCII) signaling may be more important.<ref name=\"Farber_2014\" />\n\n== Lifetime overview ==\nMemory T cells undergo different changes and play different roles in different life stages for humans. At birth and early childhood, T cells in the peripheral blood are mainly naive T cells.<ref name=\"Kumar_2018\" /> Through frequent antigen exposure, the population of memory T cells accumulates.

{"title_page": "Autonomous detection system", "text_new": "'''Autonomous Detection Systems (ADS)''', also called biohazard detection systems, or autonomous pathogen detection systems are designed to monitor air in an environment and to detect the presence of airborne [[Chemical|chemicals]], [[Toxin|toxins]], [[Pathogen|pathogens]], or other [[Biological agent|biological agents]] capable of causing human illness or death. These systems monitor the air continuously and send [[Real-time data|real-time]] alerts to appropriate authorities in the event of an act of [[bioterrorism]] or [[biological warfare]].\n<br />[[File:Autonomous Pathogen Detection System.jpg|thumb|Autonomous Pathogen Detection System by [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]]]\n\n== History ==\nIn the [[United States]], an ADS system (BDS) was developed for the [[U.S. Postal Service]] following the [[anthrax]] scare of 2001. The first detection systems in U.S Postal services were installed in 2006.To counter such problems in the future, United States Federal Govt set up a program called [[BioWatch]] which operates in more than 21 cities in the US. In 2001 the United States experienced the effects of bioterrorism for the first time when envelopes containing anthrax spores were sent through the U.S. Postal Service to several recipients, including two U.S. senators. In addition to the 5 deaths and 17 cases of anthrax infection that resulted, there were substantial economic costs and significant operational challenges in public health and health care, from the federal level down to the community level. [2] \n\n=== BioWatch ===\nThe BioWatch program is funded and supervised by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The BioWatch program has three main components: sampling, analysis, and response, each of this component is handled by three different agencies. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) handles the sampling component \u2014\u00a0 the sensors that collect airborne particles. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) coordinates the analysis and laboratory testing of the samples. Local authorities are responsible for the public health response to positive findings. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is designated as the lead agency for the law enforcement response if a bioterrorism event is detected. (Shea and Lister, 2003)\n<br />\n\n== Structure ==\nShaped like a mailbox on wheels.[3]\n<br />\n\n== Mechanism ==\nAPDS monitors the air for the three types of biological threat agents: bacteria, viruses, and toxins. The autonomous detection is capable of (1) rapidly processing and accurately analyzing aerosol samples with a high level of confidence; (2) automating and \n\nintegrating the major system functions into the detector, including aerosol sample collection, preparation, analysis, and analytical results reporting; (3) operating in its intended indoor and outdoor environments; and (4) disseminating and archiving analysis results and system operational data via the C3 network, known as the BioWatch Gen-3 Operations Support Service.\n\nAPDS operates continuously, the system can detect low concentrations of [[Biological agent|bioagents]] that might go undetected by a system that is triggered only when the overall number of particles in the air is high. APDS collects samples, prepares them for analysis, and tests for multiple biological agents. This automation reduces the cost and staffing that would be required to manually analyze samples.\n\nAs APDS collects air samples, it first runs them through an [[immunoassay]] detector. If that detector returns a positive result, APDS performs a second assay based on [[Nucleic acid|nucleic-acid]] amplification and detection. Having two different assay systems increases system reliability and minimizes the possibility of false positives.\n\nThe immunoassay detector incorporates liquid arrays, a multiplexed assay that uses small-diameter polystyrene beads (microbeads) coated with thousands of [[Antibody|antibodie]]<nowiki/>s. Each microbead is colored with a unique combination of red- and orange-emitting dyes. The number of agents that can be detected in a sample is limited only by the number of colored bead sets. When the sample is exposed to the beads, a [[Biological agent|bioagent]], if present, binds to the bead with the appropriate antibody. A second fluorescently labeled antibody is then added to the sample, resulting in a highly fluorescent target for flow analysis. Preparing the sample and performing this first analysis takes less than 30 minutes.\n\nNucleic acid assays require amplification of one or more target sequences of nucleic acid. Short strands of single-stranded DNA are synthesized in known sequences and attached to spots in the array in a predetermined way[5] Detection of these spots that contain hybridized target DNA allows one to the sequence of DNA in the unknown target. RNA readily hybridizes to form double-stranded structures to its complementary sequence (A-T, C-G, G-C, U-A). Thus, arrays of single-stranded DNA can be used to detect RNA via hybridization.\n\nTABLE 1.1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Prioritized List of Biological Threat Agents''<sup>a</sup>''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Disease (Organism)\n|Agent Type''<sup>b</sup>''\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Category A''<sup>c</sup>''\n|-\n|Anthrax (Bacillus anthracis)\n|B\n|-\n|Botulism (Clostridium botulinum toxin)\n|T\n|-\n|[[Yersinia pestis|Plague (Yersinia pestis)]]\n|B\n|-\n|[[Smallpox|Smallpox (variola major)]]\n|V\n|-\n|Tularemia (Francisella tularensis)\n|B\n|-\n|[[Viral hemorrhagic fever|Viral hemorrhagic fevers]] (filoviruses\u2014e.g., Ebola and Marburg\u2014and arenaviruses\u2014e.g., Lassa and Machupo)\n|V\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Category B''<sup>d</sup>''\n|-\n|Brucellosis (Brucella species)\n|B\n|-\n|Epsilon toxin (from Clostridium perfringens)\n|T\n|-\n|Food safety threats (e.g., Salmonella species, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shigella)\n|B\n|-\n|[[Glanders]] (Burkholderia mallei)\n|B\n|-\n|[[Melioidosis]] (Burkholderia pseudomallei)\n|B\n|-\n|Psittacosis (Chlamydia psittaci)\n|B\n|-\n|Q fever (Coxiella burnetii)\n|B\n|-\n|[[Ricin|Ricin toxin]] (from Ricinus communis\u2014castor beans)\n|T\n|-\n|Staphylococcal enterotoxin B\n|T\n|-\n|[[Typhus|Typhus fever]] (Rickettsia prowazekii)\n|B\n|-\n|Viral encephalitis (alphaviruses such as [[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus|Venezuelan equine]] encephalitis, eastern equine encephalitis, western equine encephalitis)\n|V\n|-\n|Water safety threats (e.g., Vibrio cholerae, Cryptosporidium parvum)\n|B\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Category C''<sup>e</sup>''\n|-\n|Emerging infectious diseases such as [[Nipah virus infection|Nipah virus]] and hantavirus\n|V\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |''<sup>a</sup>'' Available at <nowiki>http://www.cdc.gov</nowiki>.

ASAP II gives real time detection of bio-warfare agents, chemical agents and toxic industrial chemicals, explosives in particulate and vapor form and nuclear materials. The system can be customised according to the need of the mailroom.\n\nASAP II is an automated chemical, biological and nuclear detection and identification system. The system can detect and identify from four(RAPTOR module) to eight (BioHawk module) bio-agents in real time. Periodically or on demand, a concentrated sample is sent to the modules and within fifteen minutes these systems will identify the presence of any bioagents and notify the operator if a hazardous agent is detected.\n\nThe systems need to be in a negative pressure room on a downward draft table, they are able to handle thousands of pieces of mail per hour. An air sampling module within the systems draws air into the downward draft table for analysis. Sampling is continuous until the batch of mail is complete, it may be a few minutes of hours or days.[4]\n<br />\n\n== Application ==\nThe system can be adapted for situations where environmental or clinical pathogens require monitoring. For example, APDS could test for [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] or [[Fungus|fungal]] spores in buildings or for the airborne spread of contagious materials in hospitals. It also could identify disease outbreaks in livestock transport centers or feedlots.\n\n=== Automated Mailroom Detection Systems ===\n\n==== BioAlert System ====\nResearch International produces and sells the TacBio particle detection system. The system samples the air continuously and monitors for\u00a0 aerosol particle or bio-particle levels\n\nIt does not identify the type of bio- particle detected but will notify the mailroom attendant if either excess particles or bio-particles are present. This is an early warning system that gives the mailroom supervisor enough time to notice a potential threat and to test for biological agents or\u00a0 airborne threats before mail is delivered to a recipient.\n\n==== Hand Held and Stand Alone Systems ====\nChemPRO 100 Chemical Detection System is a handheld chemical detector for field detection and classification of Chemical Warfare Agents. If mail arrives with an unidentified substance, this hand held detector can be used to immediately identify the chemical.\n\nHardened Mobile Trace Explosive Particle tests for a wide range of explosives and narcotics in seconds. The system will identify explosives in packages or envelopes that are often undetectable by x-ray machines. This handheld detector expands the range of target explosives you can identify in a single sample for faster more comprehensive screening. As noted, this system also detects a wide range of narcotics. The system tests for explosives and narcotics simultaneously in a single sample, for faster, more comprehensive screening.

These systems monitor the air continuously and send [[Real-time data|real-time]] alerts to appropriate authorities in the event of an act of [[bioterrorism]] or [[biological warfare]].\n<br />[[File:Autonomous Pathogen Detection System.jpg|thumb|Autonomous Pathogen Detection System by [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]]]\n\n== History ==\nIn the [[United States]], an ADS system (BDS) was developed for the [[U.S. Postal Service]] following the [[anthrax]] scare of 2001. The first detection systems in U.S Postal services were installed in 2006.To counter such problems in the future, United States Federal Govt set up a program called [[BioWatch]] which operates in more than 21 cities in the US. In 2001 the United States experienced the effects of bioterrorism for the first time when envelopes containing anthrax spores were sent through the U.S. Postal Service to several recipients, including two U.S. senators. In addition to the 5 deaths and 17 cases of anthrax infection that resulted, there were substantial economic costs and significant operational challenges in public health and health care, from the federal level down to the community level. [2] \n\n=== BioWatch ===\nThe BioWatch program is funded and supervised by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The BioWatch program has three main components: sampling, analysis, and response, each of this component is handled by three different agencies. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) handles the sampling component \u2014\u00a0 the sensors that collect airborne particles. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) coordinates the analysis and laboratory testing of the samples. Local authorities are responsible for the public health response to positive findings. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is designated as the lead agency for the law enforcement response if a bioterrorism event is detected. (Shea and Lister, 2003)\n<br />\n\n== Structure ==\nShaped like a mailbox on wheels.[3]\n<br />\n\n== Mechanism ==\nAPDS monitors the air for the three types of biological threat agents: bacteria, viruses, and toxins. The autonomous detection is capable of (1) rapidly processing and accurately analyzing aerosol samples with a high level of confidence; (2) automating and \n\nintegrating the major system functions into the detector, including aerosol sample collection, preparation, analysis, and analytical results reporting; (3) operating in its intended indoor and outdoor environments; and (4) disseminating and archiving analysis results and system operational data via the C3 network, known as the BioWatch Gen-3 Operations Support Service.\n\nAPDS operates continuously, the system can detect low concentrations of [[Biological agent|bioagents]] that might go undetected by a system that is triggered only when the overall number of particles in the air is high. APDS collects samples, prepares them for analysis, and tests for multiple biological agents. This automation reduces the cost and staffing that would be required to manually analyze samples.\n\nAs APDS collects air samples, it first runs them through an [[immunoassay]] detector. If that detector returns a positive result, APDS performs a second assay based on [[Nucleic acid|nucleic-acid]] amplification and detection. Having two different assay systems increases system reliability and minimizes the possibility of false positives.\n\nThe immunoassay detector incorporates liquid arrays, a multiplexed assay that uses small-diameter polystyrene beads (microbeads) coated with thousands of [[Antibody|antibodie]]<nowiki/>s. Each microbead is colored with a unique combination of red- and orange-emitting dyes. The number of agents that can be detected in a sample is limited only by the number of colored bead sets. When the sample is exposed to the beads, a [[Biological agent|bioagent]], if present, binds to the bead with the appropriate antibody. A second fluorescently labeled antibody is then added to the sample, resulting in a highly fluorescent target for flow analysis. Preparing the sample and performing this first analysis takes less than 30 minutes.\n\nNucleic acid assays require amplification of one or more target sequences of nucleic acid. Short strands of single-stranded DNA are synthesized in known sequences and attached to spots in the array in a predetermined way[5] Detection of these spots that contain hybridized target DNA allows one to the sequence of DNA in the unknown target. RNA readily hybridizes to form double-stranded structures to its complementary sequence (A-T, C-G, G-C, U-A). Thus, arrays of single-stranded DNA can be used to detect RNA via hybridization.\n\nTABLE 1.1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Prioritized List of Biological Threat Agents''<sup>a</sup>''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Disease (Organism)\n|Agent Type''<sup>b</sup>''\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Category A''<sup>c</sup>''\n|-\n|Anthrax (Bacillus anthracis)\n|B\n|-\n|Botulism (Clostridium botulinum toxin)\n|T\n|-\n|[[Yersinia pestis|Plague (Yersinia pestis)]]\n|B\n|-\n|[[Smallpox|Smallpox (variola major)]]\n|V\n|-\n|Tularemia (Francisella tularensis)\n|B\n|-\n|[[Viral hemorrhagic fever|Viral hemorrhagic fevers]] (filoviruses\u2014e.g., Ebola and Marburg\u2014and arenaviruses\u2014e.g., Lassa and Machupo)\n|V\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Category B''<sup>d</sup>''\n|-\n|Brucellosis (Brucella species)\n|B\n|-\n|Epsilon toxin (from Clostridium perfringens)\n|T\n|-\n|Food safety threats (e.g., Salmonella species, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shigella)\n|B\n|-\n|[[Glanders]] (Burkholderia mallei)\n|B\n|-\n|[[Melioidosis]] (Burkholderia pseudomallei)\n|B\n|-\n|Psittacosis (Chlamydia psittaci)\n|B\n|-\n|Q fever (Coxiella burnetii)\n|B\n|-\n|[[Ricin|Ricin toxin]] (from Ricinus communis\u2014castor beans)\n|T\n|-\n|Staphylococcal enterotoxin B\n|T\n|-\n|[[Typhus|Typhus fever]] (Rickettsia prowazekii)\n|B\n|-\n|Viral encephalitis (alphaviruses such as [[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus|Venezuelan equine]] encephalitis, eastern equine encephalitis, western equine encephalitis)\n|V\n|-\n|Water safety threats (e.g., Vibrio cholerae, Cryptosporidium parvum)\n|B\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Category C''<sup>e</sup>''\n|-\n|Emerging infectious diseases such as [[Nipah virus infection|Nipah virus]] and hantavirus\n|V\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |''<sup>a</sup>'' Available at <nowiki>http://www.cdc.gov</nowiki>.
