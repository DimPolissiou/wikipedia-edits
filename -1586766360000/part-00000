He was a leading exponent of [[Poland|Polish]] origin of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] movement in [[France]]. \n\nWith [[\u00c9douard Dujardin]] he created ''[[La Revue wagn\u00e9rienne]]'' in 1885. In 1901, he founded the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Mozart with [[Adolphe Boschot]] and [[Georges de Saint-Foix]]. He frequently contributed articles on European literature and music to the ''[[Revue des deux mondes]]'' and ''[[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]]'', among many other periodicals. His translation of [[Jacobus de Voragine]]'s ''[[Golden Legend]]'' into modern French made it available to a wide audience once more. \n\nWyzewa made his name with brilliant analyses of poems by [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9]]. In ''[[La Revue wagn\u00e9rienne]]'' he  put forward the idea of [[Wagnerian Art]] which heralded [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]]. He is also famous for his for his idea of the \"work of art of the future\", which, according to him, should have been a novel describing only the inner life of its author during a period no longer than a day. The idea, transferred by example of the novel ''[[Les lauriers sont coup\u00e9s]]'' by  Wyzewa's friend [[\u00c9douard Dujardin]], was fully realized by [[James Joyce]] in ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''. Wyzewa was critical of Dujardin's novel though.\n\nHe was married to [[Marguerite Terlinden]], the daughter of Belgian painter [[F\u00e9lix Terlinden]] and the sister-in-law of the art critic and historian [[Pierre Francastel]].\nIn Ninove (Belgium) there is a field chapel (Ruysbroeck kapel / Ruybroeck kapel) in remembrance of Theodor the Wyzewa's wife , Margareta Ter Linden (1873-1901) and her grand-parents Albrecht Ter Linden (1793-1851) and his wife Isabella Govaert (1801-1875). \n[[File:Kapel ter ruysbroeck|thumb]]\n==References==\n* France, Peter (Ed.)
