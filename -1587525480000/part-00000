The measure has had the effect of almost doubling the numbers of newspapers and magazines since 1996.\n\nThe first [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese-language]] newspaper was the French-sponsored ''Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh Bao'', established in Saigon in 1869. In the years that followed, both the nationalistic and the colonial sides relied on newspapers as a propaganda tool. During the final period of French colonialism many reporters were arrested and imprisoned and several newspaper offices closed by the authorities.\n\nFor Ho Chi Minh's revolutionary side, Vietnamese journalists covered the [[First Indochina War]]. After the war, presses were set up in Hanoi and the basis for the country's newspaper industry as it exists today was formed, with the main [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]] organ, ''[[Nhan Dan]]'' (''The People''), established in 1951.\n\nCurrent large Vietnamese-language newspapers include ''[[Tuoi Tre]]'' (''Youth'', published in [[Ho Chi Minh City]], described as a \"reformist\" newspaper), ''[[Thanh Nien]]'' (''Youth''), ''[[Ng\u01b0\u1eddi Lao \u0110\u1ed9ng]]'' (''Labour'' or ''The Worker''), ''[[Tien Phong (newspaper)|Tien Phong]]'' (''Vanguard''), ''[[Sai Gon Giai Phong]]'' (''Liberated Saigon''), and ''[[H\u00e0n\u1ed9im\u1edbi]]'' (''New Hanoi''). Prominent French language newspapers included ''Saigon Eco'', the only that currently is published is ''[[Le Courrier du Vietnam]]''. There are other, smaller provincial newspapers such as the ''[[Ba Ria Vung Tau Daily Newspaper]]''.\n\nThe largest online newspapers are [[Zing.vn]], [[VnExpress]], [[VietNamNet]], [[Tu\u1ed5i Tr\u1ebb]], [[Thanh Ni\u00ean]], [[D\u00e2n Tr\u00ed]], [[Vietnam Multimedia Corporation|VTC News]], and [[Vietnam News Agency|VietnamPlus]].

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from Ong's father to free his son. A ransom of $20,000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 24 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep8/367512|title=True Files S3|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

While Nyu was guarding the victims, Sek decided to murder all five victims by escorting them one-by-one out of the bedroom in a bid to erase witnesses. Sek proceeded to struck Tay and his wife with a chair and strangled them. Sek also strangled their maid. In all, Sek murdered 3 people. Nyu discovered Sek's murder intentions only when he caught him in the act in another room. Fearing that Tay's daughter and her tutor would be next, Nyu carried the rifle with him and locked the bedroom door upon dashing in.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's 35-year-old school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh Laye Koh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. At the end of Oh's re-trial on 3 May 1994, Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words, he said to Oh in his verdict, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, JC Singh found Oh guilty and sentenced him to death for the murder of Liang Shan Shan. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was hanged on 19 May 1995. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s2/ep10/367437|title=True Files S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep6/379405|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1991===\n* 4 May 1991: Filipino domestic worker [[Flor Contemplacion]] murdered another Filipino domestic worker, Della Maga, and Nicholas Huang, the four-year-old son of Maga's employer.

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck and that he did not die in the fire. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and charged in January 1993, claimed at the trial that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence and he himself was forced to help dispose the corpse out of fear. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. However, the judge rejected their defences and stated that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and decided that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore both of the men were convicted as charged and sentenced to death. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 December 1995.

Earlier on that day itself, the two men, who were acquaintances, went to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview when they both spotted the Japanese tour group which Fujii and Takishita were with, and seeing this, the two men decided to rob the Japanese tourists. Both men robbed and assaulted the two women; Takishita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint to escape further injury. When Abdul Nasir attempted to escape after severely assaulting and robbing Fujii, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face as he held onto the wall to try to steady himself, causing a facial fracture which obstructed her breathing and caused her death. 2 years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and murder a taxi driver, and his fingerprints were found to match those found in Fujii and Takishita's room.

Both men were charged with murder; however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. At Abdul Nasir's murder trial, the presiding judge, Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck accepted Abdul Nasir's defence that he accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face while he rejected the prosecution's arguement that Abdul Nasir intentionally stamped onto Fujii's face to kill her. For this, Abdul Nasir was acquitted of murder, and he was instead sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane for robbery with hurt. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal. However by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. That did not mark an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed during the time of his remand. At the time of his remand, Abdul Nasir, together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being subdued by the police. Abdul Nasir was later found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on 3 March 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial for kidnapping, ordered the life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term Abdul Nasir received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir will be serving a total of 38 years in prison (at that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir appealed for the two jail terms to run concurrently, but the appeal was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How also ruled that life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of a jail term of 20 years. This amendment will apply to future cases after 20 August 1997. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment, so his life term was still a jail term of 20 years, and thus he would still be jailed for 38 years.<ref> {{cite web|title=oriental_hotel_murder|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1804_2011-04-04.html}} </ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|title=Former detective Richard Lim Beng Gee, 65, dies: 5 high-profile cases he helped crack / ASSAULT ON TWO JAPANESE TOURISTS IN 5-STAR HOTEL|last=Lee|first=Min Kok|date=2016-01-19|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012154609/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|archive-date=2019-10-12|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep9/367513|title=True Files S3|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n===1995===\n\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

Their vicious robberies led to the death of one of their victims, 35-year-old security guard Loh Ee Hui. On 23 August, Fabian used a wooden stick to smack at Loh's head three times and stomped on his chest, while Ellarry acted as a lookout. Loh died in hospital from skull fractures. On 7 September that year, Fabian was arrested, followed by Ellarry the next day. In September 2011, Fabian was found guilty of murder and given the mandatory death sentence. However, in 2012, the mandatory death penalty law was revised. It reduces the sentence of death, for those convicted of drug trafficking or murder, to life imprisonment if conditions were met.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/murderer-fails-to-escape-the-gallows-6-other-cases-involving-the-revised|title=Murderer fails to escape the gallows: 6 other cases involving the revised death penalty laws|last=Abu Baker|first=Jalelah|date=16 January 2015|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321155910/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/murderer-fails-to-escape-the-gallows-6-other-cases-involving-the-revised|archive-date=21 March 2018|access-date=24 November 2019}}</ref> This enabled Fabian to undergo a retrial and on 17 July 2013, he became the first person to have his death sentence commuted to life imprisonment under the revised death penalty.

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from Ong's father to free his son. A ransom of $20,000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 24 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep8/367512|title=True Files S3|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's 35-year-old school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh Laye Koh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. At the end of Oh's re-trial on 3 May 1994, Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words, he said to Oh in his verdict, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, JC Singh found Oh guilty and sentenced him to death for the murder of Liang Shan Shan. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was hanged on 19 May 1995. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s2/ep10/367437|title=True Files S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep6/379405|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1991===\n* 4 May 1991: Filipino domestic worker [[Flor Contemplacion]] murdered another Filipino domestic worker, Della Maga, and Nicholas Huang, the four-year-old son of Maga's employer.

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck and that he did not die in the fire. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and charged in January 1993, claimed at the trial that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence and he himself was forced to help dispose the corpse out of fear. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. However, the judge rejected their defences and stated that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and decided that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore both of the men were convicted as charged and sentenced to death. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 December 1995. This case was re-enacted in \"Whispers Of The Dead\", a Singaporean crime show which features the notable cases solved by Professor Chao, though some aspects of the case, as well as the identities of those involved were changed for dramatic purposes. <ref> {{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep5/377256|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}} </ref> <ref>{{cite news|title=Two murderers hanged|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/issue/straitstimes19950909-1&ved=2ahUKEwj3ur7H8PnoAhVCWX0KHbD-DtcQFjAAegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw1Q8UplYrrw-kIoFuel_4Uf|newspaper=The Straits Times|}}</ref>\n\n===1994===\n\n* 6 June 1994: Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad barged into the room shared by two Japanese tourists - Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56. Earlier on that day itself, the two men, who were acquaintances, went to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview when they both spotted the Japanese tour group which Fujii and Takishita were with, and seeing this, the two men decided to rob the Japanese tourists. Both men robbed and assaulted the two women; Takishita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint to escape further injury. When Abdul Nasir attempted to escape after severely assaulting and robbing Fujii, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face, causing a facial fracture which obstructed her breathing and caused her death. 2 years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and murder a taxi driver, and his fingerprints were found to match those found in Fujii and Takishita's room. Abdul Nasir confessed that he was involved in the robbery, and Abdul Rahman was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft. Both men were charged with murder; however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. At Abdul Nasir's murder trial, the presiding judge, Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck accepted Abdul Nasir's defence that he accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face while he rejected the prosecution's arguement that Abdul Nasir intentionally stamped onto Fujii's face to kill her. For this, Abdul Nasir was acquitted of murder, and he was instead sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane for robbery with hurt. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal. However by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. That did not mark an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed during the time of his remand. At the time of his remand, Abdul Nasir, together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being subdued by the police. Abdul Nasir was later found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on 3 March 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial for kidnapping, ordered the life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term Abdul Nasir received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir will be serving a total of 38 years in prison (at that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir appealed for the two jail terms to run concurrently, but the appeal was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How also ruled that life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of a jail term of 20 years. This amendment will apply to future cases after 20 August 1997. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment, so his life term was still a jail term of 20 years, and thus he would still be jailed for 38 years.<ref> {{cite web|title=oriental_hotel_murder|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1804_2011-04-04.html}} </ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|title=Former detective Richard Lim Beng Gee, 65, dies: 5 high-profile cases he helped crack / ASSAULT ON TWO JAPANESE TOURISTS IN 5-STAR HOTEL|last=Lee|first=Min Kok|date=2016-01-19|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012154609/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|archive-date=2019-10-12|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep9/367513|title=True Files S3|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n===1995===\n\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

[[Henri Frenay]], leader of Combat, claimed command of the new structure, but faced opposition from [[Emmanuel d'Astier de La Vigerie]], leader of Liberation-Sud and [[:fr:Jean-Pierre L\u00e9vy (r\u00e9sistant)|Jean-Pierre Levy]], head of the Franc-Tireurs. [[Jean Moulin]] insisted that the post should go to someone who with no affiliation to one of these groups, so Frenay proposed [[Charles Delestraint]], a general recalled from his retirement during the [[Battle of France]], who admired De Gaulle and detested Vichy. He was the only general officer who had been promoted despite that defeat; the proposal was unanimously accepted.\n\nJean Moulin and General Delestraint first met on August 28, 1942 in Lyon. At the end of the interview, Jean Moulin ordered the three regional chiefs of the paramilitary formations of the great movements made available to Delestraint, for him to choose the best suited to the regional direction of the Secret Army. To this position, eminently clandestine and dangerous, the general named Captain {{ILL|Claudius Billon|fr}}. As early as September, Billon appointed each of the AS departmental heads for R1, with the exception of the AS chief for [[Ain]], named by Delestraint himself.\n\nIn October, Delestraint was appointed (officially) by [[General de Gaulle]]. [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny|General de Lattre]] had also been approached for this post, but had refused. Delestraint took command on November 11, 1942. His secretary was {{ILL|Francois-Yves Guillin|fr}}; the head of the 2nd AS office was {{ILL|Joseph Gastaldo|fr}}. [[Andr\u00e9 Lassagne]] was the deputy of Gastaldo, before becoming Delestraint, and the information was entrusted to Albert Lacaze (4th office). Its chief of staff was {{ILL|Fran\u00e7ois Morin-Forestier|fr}}, from Combat, staff in which is also integrated [[Raymond Aubrac]].{{what|date=May 2019}}\n \nOn November 27, 1942 in [[Collonges-au-Mont-d'Or]], the constituent meeting of the Southern Zone Coordination Committee was held and the head of the Secret Army was presented by Jean Moulin. This committee intended to unite the three major resistance movements.\n\nIn December, Delestraint, inexperienced in the constraints of illegal life, crossed the demarcation line to make contact with the major movements in the northern zone: Liberation, the Civil and Military Organization (CMO) National, Lib\u00e9ration-Nord. Then, back in the free zone, he took part in the creation of the United Movements of the Resistance (MUR) on January 26, 1943 in Miribel, in Ain.\n\nAt the beginning of February 1943, {{ILL|Hugo Geissler|fr}}, Kommandeur of the [[Sicherheitspolizei|Sipo]]-[[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] in Vichy, decapitated the Secret Army of the R1 region. On February 1 in Lyon's Place du Pont, he arrested Billon, head of the AS in R1 (eleven departments), along with his deputy Pierre Lavergne. On February 3, at 31, rue Basse-des-Rives in Saint-\u00c9tienne, during a secret meeting of the headquarters of the departmental AS, he also arrested the head of AS Loire, Lieutenant Vidiani, and his companions. On February 10, in [[Le Puy-en-Velay]], they continued to dismantle the AS in R1 with the arrest of the chief of AS in Haute-Loire Alfred Salvatelli and his companions at his home. After the February 10 arrest, the Haute-Loire resistance joined region R6 (Auvergne). On 27 May 1943, these three arrests, orchestrated by Geissler, featured prominently at the beginning of the [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]]'s report addressed to [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], Minister of Foreign Affairs for the Reich.\n\nDelestraint then fought against the advice of Frenay (who had been provisionally delegated general of the Secret Army) to put the Army under the tutelage of the MUR. Frenay, on the one hand the No. 2 of the Secret Army and on the other a member of the Coordination Committee of the same army, then wished the recall of Delestraint and his own appointment as head of the Secret Army, which were rejected by the other members of the Coordinating Committee, Moulin, d'Astier and Levy.\n\nIn London in February 1943 to meet Allied authorities, Delestraint was asked to make his troop the \"nucleus of the future French army\", estimated at 150,000 men. Unfortunately, Francois Morin-Forestier was arrested in March with Raymond Aubrac, [[Maurice Kriegel-Vallimont]] and {{ILL|Serge Ravanel|fr}} of the MUR, and only  released in May, thanks to the action of his former co-detainee Raymond Aubrac. His release did not allow his return to the staff: too exposed, he was ex-filtered to London. In April, Delestraint returned to Paris, arriving April 11. By the June 4 report, Moulin deplores the risks that Delestraint was taking, working alone when he would do better if assisted.\n\nOn June 9, 1943, Delestraint, Gastaldo and their deputy Jean-Louis Th\u00e9obald were arrested in Paris. On June 21, a staff meeting was held to find a successor to Delestraint in [[Caluire-et-Cuire]]. L\u00e9onard \u00c9mile Schwarzfeld, candidate to replace Delestraint, Aubrac, candidate for the leadership in the northern zone, and Lassagne for the southern zone, as well as other leaders of the Resistance such as Moulin, [[Henri Aubry]], [[Ren\u00e9 Hardy]], {{ILL|Albert Lacaze|fr}} and {{ILL|Bruno Larat|fr}} were taken prisoner. In July 1943, Colonel [[Pierre Dejussieu-Pontcarral]] was appointed chief of staff of a Secret Army now without an official leader. The Chief of Staff of the Southern Zone was General Jouffrault, until he was also arrested in August 1943.\n\nOn February 1, 1944, the Gaullist Secret Army merged with the [[French Forces of the Interior]] (FFI), with the Army Resistance Organization (ORA) and the French Francs-tireurs et partisans (FTPF, communists, not to be confused with the Franc-Tireur movement).\n\nThis structure was mainly found in the southern half of France: [[Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]] (R1) and [[Auvergne]] (R6), but also [[Limousin]] (R5), South-East and the Southwest (R4). It corresponded to the organizational structure used by Combat.\n\nUniting the regions of the free zone took only a few weeks, the various chiefs being chosen from among the regional chiefs in office. In Region A, the workforce was almost entirely composed of members of the CMO.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Regions==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable centre\" style=\"text-align:center; width=80%;\"\n|+ Layout of Resistance forces\n!width=\"25%\" | Region || Departement || Leader || Others\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''B''' || '''Region''' || General [[Louis-Eug\u00e8ne Faucher]] ||\n|-\n| [[Deux-S\u00e8vres]] || {{Interlanguage link multi|Edmond Proust|fr}} ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\" | '''M''' || '''Region''' || General {{Interlanguage link multi|Louis-Alexandre Audibert|fr}} ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | '''M2''' || '''Region''' || General {{Interlanguage link multi|Marcel Allard|fr}} ||\n|-\n| [[Finist\u00e8re]] || {{Interlanguage link multi|Mathieu Donnart|fr}}<br/>{{Interlanguage link multi|Roger Bourri\u00e8res|fr}} ||\n|-\n| [[Morbihan]] || {{Interlanguage link multi|Maurice Guillaudot|fr}}<br/>[[Paul Chenailler]] ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"8\" | '''R1 - Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes''' || '''Region''' || Captain {{Interlanguage link multi|Claudius Billon|fr}}<br/><br/>Capt. {{Interlanguage link multi|Albert Chambonnet|fr}}<br/>|| {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre Lavergne|fr}} (Maquis)<br/><br/>{{Interlanguage link multi|Andr\u00e9 Vansteenberghe|fr}} (intelligence)\n|-\n| [[Ain (d\u00e9partement)|Ain]] || Andr\u00e9 ''Bob'' Fornier<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maquisdelain.org/index.php?r=personnage&id=60 |language=French |title=Maquis de l'Ain et du Haut-Jura |trans-title=Maquis of the Ain and Haut-Jura |access-date=2015-07-07}}</ref><br/>Capt.

By the June 4 report, Moulin deplores the risks that Delestraint was taking, working alone when he would do better if assisted.\n\nOn June 9, 1943, Delestraint, Gastaldo and their deputy Jean-Louis Th\u00e9obald were arrested in Paris. On June 21, a staff meeting was held to find a successor to Delestraint in [[Caluire-et-Cuire]]. L\u00e9onard \u00c9mile Schwarzfeld, candidate to replace Delestraint, Aubrac, candidate for the leadership in the northern zone, and Lassagne for the southern zone, as well as other leaders of the Resistance such as Moulin, [[Henri Aubry]], [[Ren\u00e9 Hardy]], {{ILL|Albert Lacaze|fr}} and {{ILL|Bruno Larat|fr}} were taken prisoner. In July 1943, Colonel [[Pierre Dejussieu-Pontcarral]] was appointed chief of staff of a Secret Army now without an official leader. The Chief of Staff of the Southern Zone was General Jouffrault, until he was also arrested in August 1943.\n\nOn February 1, 1944, the Gaullist Secret Army merged with the [[French Forces of the Interior]] (FFI), with the Army Resistance Organization (ORA) and the French Francs-tireurs et partisans (FTPF, communists, not to be confused with the Franc-Tireur movement).\n\nThis structure was mainly found in the southern half of France: [[Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]] (R1) and [[Auvergne]] (R6), but also [[Limousin]] (R5), South-East and the Southwest (R4). It corresponded to the organizational structure used by Combat.\n\nUniting the regions of the free zone took only a few weeks, the various chiefs being chosen from among the regional chiefs in office. In Region A, the workforce was almost entirely composed of members of the CMO.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Regions==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable centre\" style=\"text-align:center; width=80%;\"\n|+ Layout of Resistance forces\n!width=\"25%\" | Region || Departement || Leader || Others\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''B''' || '''Region''' || General [[Louis-Eug\u00e8ne Faucher]] ||\n|-\n| [[Deux-S\u00e8vres]] || {{Interlanguage link multi|Edmond Proust|fr}} ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\" | '''M''' || '''Region''' || General {{Interlanguage link multi|Louis-Alexandre Audibert|fr}} ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | '''M2''' || '''Region''' || General {{Interlanguage link multi|Marcel Allard|fr}} ||\n|-\n| [[Finist\u00e8re]] || {{Interlanguage link multi|Mathieu Donnart|fr}}<br/>{{Interlanguage link multi|Roger Bourri\u00e8res|fr}} ||\n|-\n| [[Morbihan]] || {{Interlanguage link multi|Maurice Guillaudot|fr}}<br/>[[Paul Chenailler]] ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"8\" | '''R1 - Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes''' || '''Region''' || Captain {{Interlanguage link multi|Claudius Billon|fr}}<br/><br/>Capt. {{Interlanguage link multi|Albert Chambonnet|fr}}<br/>|| {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre Lavergne|fr}} (Maquis)<br/><br/>{{Interlanguage link multi|Andr\u00e9 Vansteenberghe|fr}} (intelligence)\n|-\n| [[Ain (d\u00e9partement)|Ain]] || Andr\u00e9 ''Bob'' Fornier<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maquisdelain.org/index.php?r=personnage&id=60 |language=French |title=Maquis de l'Ain et du Haut-Jura |trans-title=Maquis of the Ain and Haut-Jura |access-date=2015-07-07}}</ref><br/>Capt.

The picture stars [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[William Holden]]. This was Wilder's last film released by [[Paramount Pictures]], ending a 12-year business relationship with Wilder and the company. The film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0301/films2.html|title=Films Selected for the National Film Registry in 2002 (January 2003) - Library of Congress Information Bulletin|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Holden-Hepburn-Sabrina.jpg|thumb|left|Hepburn and Holden]]\nSabrina Fairchild is the young daughter of the Larrabee family's [[chauffeur]], Thomas, and has been in love with David Larrabee all her life. David is a three-times-married playboy who has never paid attention to Sabrina because to him she was still a child. Eavesdropping on a party at the Larrabee mansion, as she has often done before, Sabrina notices David enticing yet another woman. Distraught, she leaves her father a suicide note and starts every car in the garage so as to kill herself. Instead she is interrupted by David's older brother Linus, who escorts her back to her quarters above the garage. \n\nSabrina had been on the point of sailing for France, where she is to attend [[Le Cordon Bleu]], the leading [[culinary school]] in [[Paris]]. After two years there, she returns home as an attractive and sophisticated woman. When her father is delayed from picking her up at the station, David offers her a lift instead without even knowing it is Sabrina. \n\nOnce David realizes who she is, he is quickly drawn to Sabrina and invites her to join him at a party at the mansion. When Linus sees this, he fears that David's imminent marriage to Elizabeth Tyson may be endangered. If the engagement is broken, it would ruin a profitable opportunity for a great corporate merger between Larrabee Industries and Elizabeth's very wealthy father's business. Instead of confronting David about his irresponsibility, Linus pretends to sympathise with him and in a moment of inattention David sits down on champagne glasses he has placed in his pockets, so that he is incapacitated for a few days.  \n\nLinus now takes David\u2019s place with Sabrina on the pretext that \u201cit\u2019s all in the family\u201d until both fall in love, although neither will admit it. In fact Linus\u2019 plan is to pretend to be accompanying Sabrina back to Paris but not to join her on the liner. However, when he reveals his intention to Sabrina instead, she agrees to leave the next day and never come back. \n\nThe following morning, Linus has second thoughts and decides to send David to Paris with Sabrina. This means calling off David's wedding with Elizabeth and the big Tyson deal, and he schedules a meeting of the Larrabee board to announce this. However, David enters the room at the last minute and declares that he has decided to marry Elizabeth after all. David helps Linus recognize his own feelings for Sabrina and assists him in rushing off to join Sabrina's ship before it leaves the harbor. Linus and Sabrina meet on board and sail away together.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Sabrina5.jpg|thumb|285px|Holden and Bogart]]\n[[File:Sabrina8.jpg|thumb|285px|Bogart and Hepburn]]\n* [[Humphrey Bogart]] as Linus Larrabee\n* [[Audrey Hepburn]] as Sabrina Fairchild\n* [[William Holden]] as David Larrabee\n* [[John Williams (actor)|John Williams]] as Thomas Fairchild, Sabrina's father\n* [[Walter Hampden]] as Oliver Larrabee, Linus and David's father\n* [[Nella Walker]] as Maude Larrabee, Linus and David's mother\n* [[Martha Hyer]] as Elizabeth Tyson, David's fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Marcel Dalio]] as Baron St. Fontanel\n* [[Marcel Hillaire]] as The Professor, Sabrina's culinary instructor\n* [[Ellen Corby]] as Miss McCardle, Linus' secretary\n* [[Francis X.

Best known for playing tough detectives and adventurers, Bogart was cast against type as a smart businessman gradually transformed into a romantic lead.\n\nDuring production of the film, Hepburn and Holden entered into a brief but passionate and much-publicized love affair. Bogart had originally wanted his wife [[Lauren Bacall]] to be cast as Sabrina. He complained that Hepburn required too many takes to get her dialogue right and pointed out her inexperience.<ref name=\"auto\">Ben Mankiewicz of Turner Classic Movies.</ref> \n\nBogart was very unhappy during the filming, convinced that he was totally wrong for this kind of film, mad at not being Wilder's first choice, and not liking Holden or Wilder.  But Wilder's offbeat casting produced a performance that critics generally considered successful. Bogart later apologized to Wilder for his behavior on set, citing problems in his personal life. {{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nWilder began shooting before the script was finished, and Lehman was writing all day to complete it.

Shortly after arriving, the group split into a righteous faction called the [[Nephites]] and a wicked faction called the [[Lamanites]].  To distinguish between the two, God cursed the Lamanites, causing \"a skin of blackness\" so they would \"not be enticing\".<ref>Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 5:21, 23  online at: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5?lang=eng</ref>\n\nAround 92BC, four sons of the [[King Mosiah II|Nephite King]], named [[Ammon (Book of Mormon)#Ammon\u00b2|Ammon]], [[Aaron (Nephite)|Aaron]], [[Omner]], and [[Himni]], leave on a mission with a small group of others to the Lamanites to convert them to [[Christianity]].  A significant number of Lamanites convert to [[Christianity]], band together and take the name Anti-Nephi-Lehies, rejecting the name Lamanite.  The king of the newly formed people dies, and his son becomes king, changing his name to Anti-Nephi-Lehi.  Fearful of returning to their past sins and as a sign to their covenant with God, they gather their weapons and bury them into the ground, and commit to being pacifists, and friendly with the Nephites.  God then lifts their curse of dark skin.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 23 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/23?lang=eng</ref>\n\nThe wicked portion of the Lamanites attack them, but the Anti-Nephi-Lehies do not attack back, instead allowing themselves to be killed while prostrate in prayer.  After 1,005 have been killed, the Lamanites feel guilty and stop attacking.  Many of the Lamanites then join the Anti-Nephi-Lehies.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 24 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/24?lang=eng</ref>  Others are rallied by dissident Nephites to attack the Nephites but are repelled. To avoid further attacks on them, God commands Ammon to lead the group to join the Nephites, and they change their name to the [[Ammonites (Book of Mormon)|People of Ammon]] or Ammonites.  They are given the Land of Jershon by the Nephites.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 25 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/25?lang=eng</ref>\n\nWhen an anti-christ named [[Korihor]] tries to teach atheism to the Ammonites, they bind him and take him to the high priest.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 30:21-29 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng</ref>\n\n===Stripling Warriors===\nIn a subsequent war between the Nephites and Lamanites, when the Ammonites saw how the Nephite army suffered in defending them, they considered breaking their oath to lay down their weapons and defend themselves; a Nephite prophet named [[Helaman (Book of Mormon)|Helaman]] persuaded them not to break their oath. Two thousand of their sons (who had been too young at the time to have made the pacifist covenant) volunteered to fight for the defense of the Nephites and the Ammonites.<ref name=\"Alma 53:18\">{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=53|verse=18}}</ref> The young men asked Helaman to be their commander. The young stripling warriors fought alongside the Nephite army and were one of the Nephites' most effective military units. Though every soldier was wounded at one time or another, there were no fatalities among the warriors. Helaman attributed this to the upbringing provided by their mothers and the great [[faith]] they exhibited.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 53 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/56?lang=eng</ref>  The original 2,000 \"sons of Helaman\"<ref name=\"Alma 56:46\">{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=56|verse=46}}</ref> were later joined by sixty more, making a total of 2,060.<ref name=\"Alma 57:6\">{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=57|verse=6}}</ref>\n\nThe last time the people of Ammon are mentioned in the Book of Mormon, a large portion of them migrate to the \"land northward\" sometime between 49 and 39 BC.<ref>Book of Mormon Helaman 3:12 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/25?lang=eng</ref>\n\n==Significance to the Latter Day Saint Movement==\nThe Anti-Nephi-Lehies are a well known and popular example of faith within the Latter Day Saint tradition, particlularly the story of the Stripling Warriors, which has become iconic, celebrated in Latter Day Saint artwork, toys, song, and literature.<ref name=Pulsipher2017 /><ref>Stripling Warriors are marketed to Latter-day Saint children. https://deseretbook.com/p/stripling-warrior-latter-day-designs-47472?variant_id=55823</ref> .<ref name=Patterson2002>Patterson, Robert. \u201cHelaman's Stripling Warriors and the Principles of Hypovolemic Shock.\u201d Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, vol. 35, no. 4, 2002, pp. 135\u2013141.

The Nephites on the other hand justified their defense of their\nfamilies and liberties on the ground that it was the will of God that these things be preserved. However the readers of these lessons might feel on this subject, it seems clear that if war has any justification at all in the eyes of God, it must be a war of defense, not aggression\u2014a war where the right to worship, and to live in family units, and in safety are being fought for.\"<ref>Deseret Sunday School Union, The Quorum Bulletin and Gospel Doctrine Sunday School Quarterly 6/1 (January\u2013March 1939): 11\u201313.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter the beginning of World War II church manuals commended Anti-Nephi-Lehies for their righteousness, but did not imply pacifism as being superior, instead using the story as part of the definition for what constitute a just war.<ref name=Pulsipher2017 />  \n\nIn 1950, Professor William E. Berrett wrote a critique of the Anti-Nephi-Lehies as part of his study of the Book of Mormon that would become a dominant narrative for the next several decades, calling their pacifist actions, \"an interesting experiment in non-resistance\" but ultimately not effective. \"Although the Anti-Nephi-Lehies received a short respite it was not long before it became apparent that to save their lives they must flee to the land of the Nephites and be protected by Nephite arms.\"<ref>William E.

A textual clue occurs in Alma 23:5 which says the name was taken to be \"distinguished from their brethren [the Lamanites]\". There are several speculations as to the meaning of the name:\n\n* A common interpretation is that \"Anti\" means \"Not\" instead of \"against\", rendering the name to mean \"Not descendants of Nephi, but of Lehi\".<ref>Kent P. Jackson and Darrell L. Matthews, \"The Lamanite Converts Firm in the Faith,\" in Studies in Scripture: Book of Mormon, Part 1, pp. 337-339</ref>\n* Historian [[Dan Vogel]] notes that in the Book of Mormon, the land of [[Lehi-Nephi]] was a region where Limhi's people had been kept captive before rebelling and escaping.  Thus adopting the name Anti-Nephi-Lehi was a way of symbolizing their own rebellion against traditional Lamanite ways, or becoming anti-Lamanite.<ref>Vogel, D. (2004).

Thus, rather than having the sense \"against\", it may have the meaning \"the one of Nephi and Lehi\".<ref>Hugh Nibley, Quoted in Eldin Ricks, Book of Mormon Study Guide, p. 63. as cited in Ludlow, A Companion to Your Study of the Book of Mormon, 209-210</ref>\n* [[Hugh Nibley]] further suggested that it could have semitic origins and mean \"Nephi brought face to face with other descendents of Lehi\".<ref>Hugh W.

Shortly after arriving, the group split into a righteous faction called the [[Nephites]] and a wicked faction called the [[Lamanites]].  To distinguish between the two, God cursed the Lamanites, causing \"a skin of blackness\" so they would \"not be enticing\".<ref>Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 5:21, 23  online at: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5?lang=eng</ref>\n\nAround 92BC, four sons of the [[King Mosiah II|Nephite King]], named [[Ammon (Book of Mormon)#Ammon\u00b2|Ammon]], [[Aaron (Nephite)|Aaron]], [[Omner]], and [[Himni]], leave on a mission with a small group of others to the Lamanites to convert them to [[Christianity]].  A significant number of Lamanites convert to [[Christianity]], band together and take the name Anti-Nephi-Lehies, rejecting the name Lamanite.  The king of the newly formed people dies, and his son becomes king, changing his name to Anti-Nephi-Lehi.  Fearful of returning to their past sins and as a sign to their covenant with God, they gather their weapons and bury them into the ground, and commit to being pacifists, and friendly with the Nephites.  God then lifts their curse of dark skin.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 23 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/23?lang=eng</ref>\n\nThe wicked portion of the Lamanites attack them, but the Anti-Nephi-Lehies do not attack back, instead allowing themselves to be killed while prostrate in prayer.  After 1,005 have been killed, the Lamanites feel guilty and stop attacking.  Many of the Lamanites then join the Anti-Nephi-Lehies.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 24 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/24?lang=eng</ref>  Others are rallied by dissident Nephites to attack the Nephites but are repelled.

The Nephites on the other hand justified their defense of their\nfamilies and liberties on the ground that it was the will of God that these things be preserved. However the readers of these lessons might feel on this subject, it seems clear that if war has any justification at all in the eyes of God, it must be a war of defense, not aggression\u2014a war where the right to worship, and to live in family units, and in safety are being fought for.\"<ref>Deseret Sunday School Union, The Quorum Bulletin and Gospel Doctrine Sunday School Quarterly 6/1 (January\u2013March 1939): 11\u201313.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter the beginning of World War II church manuals commended Anti-Nephi-Lehies for their righteousness, but did not imply pacifism as being superior, instead using the story as part of the definition for what constitute a just war.<ref name=Pulsipher2017 />  \n\nIn 1950, Professor William E.

New York: Oxford University Press.</ref>  \n\nThe language that is used when the Lord commands the Anti-Nephi-Lehies to leave the Lamanite lands and go to the Nephite lands is identical in parts to an earlier section in the Book of Mormon where a prophet [[Alma the Elder|Alma]] is commanded to take his group of Nephite slaves out of the Lamanite lands.  In both, the commandment reads, \"Get this people out of this land, ... therefore, get thee out of this land.\"<ref name=Hardy2010 />\n\nThe attack on the Nephites that is sparked by the attack on the Anti-Nephi-Lehies is described in two different narrative strands, once in Alma 16:6-9 and the other time in Alma 25:3, and 27:1.  There is an inconsistency between the two accounts; in the first account the Lamanites are driven back after one great battle, while in the second there there are \"many battles\".<ref name=Hardy2010 />  Of the discrepancy, LDS Church Book of Mormon Scholar [[Grant Hardy]] writes that this might be an example of the narrator \"trying not to unduly burden his narrative with unnecessary details,\" and that one version is presented for historical reasons while the other is to promote a spiritual message.<ref name=Hardy2010 />\n\nThe text of the Book of Mormon notes that hundreds of the stripling warriors \"fainted because of blood\".<ref>Book of Mormon Chapter 57 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/57?lang=eng</ref> Surgeon Robert Patterson observed of the miracle that \"the epic tale of the stripling warriors and their miraculous recovery from life-threatening trauma would appear, to the rational mind, highly unlikely or even outright impossible. Hundreds of people, even fit young males, simply do not get up and walk away after experiencing Class 4 [[hypovolemic shock]].  Perhaps even [[Joseph Smith]], uneducated as he was, did not appreciate the improbability of Helaman's narrative.\"<ref name=Patterson2002 />\n\n===Criticism===\nA major theme and stated purpose of the Book of Mormon, is the conversion the modern day Lamanite descendants to Christianity.<ref name=McBride2016>McBride, M.
