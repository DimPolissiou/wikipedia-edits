The geography of the region is diverse with two mountain ranges - the [[Western Ghats|Western]] and [[Eastern Ghats]], bordering the [[plateau]] heartland. [[Godavari River|Godavari]], [[Krishna River|Krishna]], [[Kaveri River|Kaveri]], [[Tungabhadra River|Tungabhadra]] and [[Vaigai River|Vaigai]] rivers are important non-[[Perennial stream|perennial]] sources of water. [[Bangalore]], [[Chennai]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Kochi]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Visakhapatnam]], [[Coimbatore]], [[Mysore]], [[Kozhikode]], [[Madurai]], [[Mangalore]], [[Tiruchirappalli]], [[Warangal]] are some of the major cities.\n\nThe majority of the people in South India speak one of the four major [[Dravidian languages]]: [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Kannada]] and [[Malayalam]]. During its [[History of South India|history]], a number of dynastic kingdoms ruled over parts of South India whose invasions across [[South Asia|southern]] and [[Southeast Asia|southeastern]] Asia impacted the history and culture in those regions. Major dynasties that were established in South India include the [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]], [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyas]], [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]], [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahanas]], [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]], [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakutas]] and [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]]. European countries entered India through Kerala and the region was [[colonialism|colonised]] by [[British East India|Britain]] and other Western European countries.\n\nAfter experiencing fluctuations in the decades immediately after [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]], the economies of South Indian states have registered higher than national average growth over the past three decades. While South Indian states have improved in some [[socio-economics|socio-economic]] metrics, poverty continues to affect the region much like the rest of the country, although it has considerably decreased over the years. [[Human Development Index|HDI]] in the southern states is high and the economy has undergone growth at a faster rate than most northern states. [[Literacy in India|Literacy rates]] in the southern states are higher than the national average with approximately 81% of the population capable of reading and writing. The [[fertility rate]] in South India is 1.9, the lowest of all regions in India.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Dravida nadu.jpg|thumb|South India]]\nSouth India, also known as Peninsular India, has been known by several other names.

Covering the southern part of the [[peninsula]]r [[Deccan Plateau]], South India is bounded by the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the east, the [[Arabian Sea]] in the west and the [[Indian Ocean]] in the south. The geography of the region is diverse with two mountain ranges - the [[Western Ghats|Western]] and [[Eastern Ghats]], bordering the [[plateau]] heartland. [[Godavari River|Godavari]], [[Krishna River|Krishna]], [[Kaveri River|Kaveri]], [[Tungabhadra River|Tungabhadra]] and [[Vaigai River|Vaigai]] rivers are important non-[[Perennial stream|perennial]] sources of water. [[Bangalore]], [[Chennai]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Kochi]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Visakhapatnam]], [[Coimbatore]], [[Mysore]], [[Kozhikode]], [[Madurai]], [[Mangalore]], [[Tiruchirappalli]], [[Warangal]] are some of the major cities.\n\nThe majority of the people in South India speak one of the four major [[Dravidian languages]]: [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Kannada]] and [[Malayalam]]. During its [[History of South India|history]], a number of dynastic kingdoms ruled over parts of South India whose invasions across [[South Asia|southern]] and [[Southeast Asia|southeastern]] Asia impacted the history and culture in those regions. Major dynasties that were established in South India include the [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]], [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyas]], [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]], [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahanas]], [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]], [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakutas]] and [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]]. European countries entered India through Kerala and the region was [[colonialism|colonised]] by [[British East India|Britain]] and other Western European countries.\n\nAfter experiencing fluctuations in the decades immediately after [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]], the economies of South Indian states have registered higher than national average growth over the past three decades. While South Indian states have improved in some [[socio-economics|socio-economic]] metrics, poverty continues to affect the region much like the rest of the country, although it has considerably decreased over the years. [[Human Development Index|HDI]] in the southern states is high and the economy has undergone growth at a faster rate than most northern states. [[Literacy in India|Literacy rates]] in the southern states are higher than the national average with approximately 81% of the population capable of reading and writing. The [[fertility rate]] in South India is 1.9, the lowest of all regions in India.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Dravida nadu.jpg|thumb|South India]]\nSouth India, also known as Peninsular India, has been known by several other names.
