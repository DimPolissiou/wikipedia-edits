The [[Hugo Awards]] have been described as \"a fine showcase for speculative fiction\" and \"the best known literary award for science fiction writing\".<ref name=\"GuardianHugo\"/><ref name=\"LitroHugo\"/>\n\nThe inaugural 1953 Hugo awards recognized \"Best Interior Illustrator\" and \"Best Cover Artist\" categories, awarded to [[Virgil Finlay]] and a tie between [[Hannes Bok]] and [[Ed Emshwiller]], respectively. The Best Professional Artist award was simply named \"Best Artist\" in 1955 and 1956, was not awarded in 1957, and was named \"Outstanding Artist\" in 1958, finally changing to its current name the following year.<ref name=locusCategory/> Beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or \"Retro Hugos\", have been available to be awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years prior in which no awards were given.<ref name=\"thafaq\"/> To date, Retro Hugo awards have been awarded for 1939, 1941, 1943\u20141946, 1951, and 1954, and in each case an award for professional artist was given.<ref name=\"LocusRetroHugoinfo\"/> \n\nDuring the 73 nomination years, 88 artists have been nominated; 24 of these have won, including co-winners and Retro Hugos. [[Michael Whelan]] has received the most awards, with 13 wins out of 24 nominations. [[Frank Kelly Freas]] has 11 wins and 28 nominations, the most nominations of any artist. Other artists with large numbers of wins or nominations include [[Bob Eggleton]] with 8 wins out of 23 nominations, [[Virgil Finlay]] with 5 out of 14, [[Ed Emshwiller]] with 4 out of 9, and [[Don Maitz]] with 2 out of 17. [[David A. Cherry]] and [[Thomas Canty (illustrator)|Thomas Canty]] are tied for the most nominations without an award at 10 each.\n\n==Selection==\nHugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]], or Worldcon, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as [[instant-runoff voting]] with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The works on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated.<ref name=\"thafaq\"/> The awards in 1955 and 1958 did not include any recognition of runner-up artists, but since 1959 all six candidates have been recorded.<ref name=\"thafaq\"/> Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held.<ref name=\"thaabout\"/> Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations.<ref name=\"2017change\"/> Worldcons are generally held near [[Labor Day]], and in a different city around the world each year.<ref name=locusAbout/><ref name=\"worldcon\"/>\n\n== Winners and nominees ==\nIn the following tables, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony. Artists are eligible based on their work of the previous calendar year. Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the artist's name have won the award; those with a white background are the nominees on the short-list.\n\n<span style=\"margin:0px; padding-bottom:1px; font-size:90%; display:block;\"><span style=\"border:#aaa solid 1px; background-color:#B0C4DE;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;Winners</span>\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" width=\"65%\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! width=\"15%\" scope=\"col\"|Year\n! width=\"70%\" scope=\"col\"|Artist(s)\n! width=\"15%\" scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref.\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\"| 1955\n| {{sortname|Frank Kelly|Freas}}*\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo55\"/>\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" rowspan=6| 1956\n| {{sortname|Frank Kelly|Freas}}*\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Chesley|Bonestell}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Ed|Emshwiller}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Virgil|Finlay}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Mel|Hunter}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Edward|Valigursky}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\"| 1958\n| {{sortname|Frank Kelly|Freas}}*\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo58\"/>\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" rowspan=\"5\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\"| 1959\n| {{sortname|Frank Kelly|Freas}}*\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo59\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Ed|Emshwiller}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo59\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Virgil|Finlay}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo59\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|H.

'''Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist'''  is given each year for artists of works related to science fiction or fantasy released in the previous calendar year.<ref name=\"HugoConst71\"/> The award has been given annually under several names since 1955, with the exception of 1957. The [[Hugo Awards]] have been described as \"a fine showcase for speculative fiction\" and \"the best known literary award for science fiction writing\".<ref name=\"GuardianHugo\"/><ref name=\"LitroHugo\"/>\n\nThe inaugural 1953 Hugo awards recognized \"Best Interior Illustrator\" and \"Best Cover Artist\" categories, awarded to [[Virgil Finlay]] and a tie between [[Hannes Bok]] and [[Ed Emshwiller]], respectively. The Best Professional Artist award was simply named \"Best Artist\" in 1955 and 1956, was not awarded in 1957, and was named \"Outstanding Artist\" in 1958, finally changing to its current name the following year.<ref name=locusCategory/> Beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or \"Retro Hugos\", have been available to be awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years prior in which no awards were given.<ref name=\"thafaq\"/> To date, Retro Hugo awards have been awarded for 1939, 1941, 1943, 1944, 1946, 1951, and 1954, and in each case an award for professional artist was given.<ref name=\"LocusRetroHugoinfo\"/> \n\nDuring the 73 nomination years, 88 artists have been nominated; 24 of these have won, including co-winners and Retro Hugos. [[Michael Whelan]] has received the most awards, with 13 wins out of 24 nominations. [[Frank Kelly Freas]] has 11 wins and 28 nominations, the most nominations of any artist. Other artists with large numbers of wins or nominations include [[Bob Eggleton]] with 8 wins out of 23 nominations, [[Virgil Finlay]] with 5 out of 14, [[Ed Emshwiller]] with 4 out of 9, and [[Don Maitz]] with 2 out of 17. [[David A. Cherry]] and [[Thomas Canty (illustrator)|Thomas Canty]] are tied for the most nominations without an award at 10 each.\n\n==Selection==\nHugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]], or Worldcon, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as [[instant-runoff voting]] with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The works on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated.<ref name=\"thafaq\"/> The awards in 1955 and 1958 did not include any recognition of runner-up artists, but since 1959 all six candidates have been recorded.<ref name=\"thafaq\"/> Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held.<ref name=\"thaabout\"/> Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations.<ref name=\"2017change\"/> Worldcons are generally held near [[Labor Day]], and in a different city around the world each year.<ref name=locusAbout/><ref name=\"worldcon\"/>\n\n== Winners and nominees ==\nIn the following tables, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony. Artists are eligible based on their work of the previous calendar year. Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the artist's name have won the award; those with a white background are the nominees on the short-list.\n\n<span style=\"margin:0px; padding-bottom:1px; font-size:90%; display:block;\"><span style=\"border:#aaa solid 1px; background-color:#B0C4DE;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;Winners</span>\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" width=\"65%\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! width=\"15%\" scope=\"col\"|Year\n! width=\"70%\" scope=\"col\"|Artist(s)\n! width=\"15%\" scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref.\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\"| 1955\n| {{sortname|Frank Kelly|Freas}}*\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo55\"/>\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" rowspan=6| 1956\n| {{sortname|Frank Kelly|Freas}}*\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Chesley|Bonestell}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Ed|Emshwiller}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Virgil|Finlay}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Mel|Hunter}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Edward|Valigursky}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\"| 1958\n| {{sortname|Frank Kelly|Freas}}*\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo58\"/>\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" rowspan=\"5\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\"| 1959\n| {{sortname|Frank Kelly|Freas}}*\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo59\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Ed|Emshwiller}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo59\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Virgil|Finlay}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo59\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|H.

In subsequent decades up to the 1960s, many expeditions were funded by major organizations like the [[Joint Himalayan Committee]] and launched in a \"siege\" style with large climbing parties; although the [[1935 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition|1935]] and [[1938 British Mount Everest expedition|1938 expeditions]] were small and low-cost as preferred by [[Eric Shipton]] and [[Bill Tilman]].\n\nThese early campaigns helped overcome the relatively remote nature and uncharted territory of Everest. These journeys also paved the way for the \"lightweight\"-style small expeditions that followed. A prime example is the successful [[Timeline of Mount Everest expeditions#1978|1978]] ascent by [[Reinhold Messner]] and [[Peter Habeler]], the first without [[Bottled oxygen (climbing)|bottled oxygen]], and followed by a [[Timeline of Mount Everest expeditions#1980|1980]] solo ascent (also without bottled oxygen) by Messner.\n\nThe 80s and 90s saw the emergence and rise in the commercialization of the ascent to Everest's summit. These commercial expeditions range from logistics only (i.e. a permit and some basic base camp supplies) to expensive, professionally guided expeditions promising even laypeople an increased chance of successfully reaching the summit. The increased access now afforded to scaling the [[world's tallest mountain]], while leading to more people successfully reaching the summit than ever before, has also seen a concomitant and exponential rise in casualties.

In subsequent decades up to the 1960s, many expeditions were funded by major organizations like the [[Joint Himalayan Committee]] and launched in a \"siege\" style with large climbing parties; although the [[1935 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition|1935]] and [[1938 British Mount Everest expedition|1938 expeditions]] were small and low-cost as preferred by [[Eric Shipton]] and [[Bill Tilman]].\n\nThese early campaigns helped overcome the relatively remote nature and uncharted territory of Everest. These journeys also paved the way for the \"lightweight\"-style small expeditions that followed. A prime example is the successful [[Timeline of Mount Everest expeditions#1978|1978]] ascent by [[Reinhold Messner]] and [[Peter Habeler]], the first without [[Bottled oxygen (climbing)|bottled oxygen]], and followed by a [[Timeline of Mount Everest expeditions#1980|1980]] solo ascent (also without bottled oxygen) by Messner.\n\nThe 80s and 90s saw the emergence and rise in the commercialization of the ascent to Everest's summit. These commercial expeditions range from logistics only (i.e. a permit and some basic base camp supplies) to expensive, professionally guided expeditions promising even laypeople an increased chance of successfully reaching the summit. The increased access now afforded to scaling the [[world's tallest mountain]], while leading to more people successfully reaching the summit than ever before, has also seen a concomitant and exponential rise in casualties. There can be delays of two hours or more in the queue to reach the top (in the ''[[Death Zone]]''), with a photo taken on May 22, 2019, showing a queue of about 220 climbers headed there. \n<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/themes/adventure/92200443/mount-everest-is-so-crowded-this-year-there-is-a-risk-of-traffic-jams?rm=m |title= Mount Everest is so crowded this year there is a risk of traffic jams |publisher= Stuff (Fairfax) |date= 5 May 2019}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/asia/112981863/two-climbers-die-waiting-in-queue-to-reach-mount-everests-summit |title= Two climbers die waiting in queue to reach Mount Everest's summit |publisher= Stuff (Fairfax) |date= 24 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Died\n!Date\n!Notes / Ref\n|-\n|18\u201322\n|2015\n|[[2015 Mount Everest avalanches]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/Avalanche-triggered-by-quake-kills-18-on-Mount-Everest/articleshow/47055195.cms |title=Avalanche triggered by quake kills 18 on Mount Everest |accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n|16\n|2014\n|[[2014 Mount Everest avalanche]]<ref name=NYr>{{cite news|last=Krakauer|first=Jon|title=Death and Anger on Everest|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2014/04/everest-sherpas-death-and-anger.html|accessdate=22 April 2014|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=21 April 2014|quote=Of the twenty-five men hit by the falling ice, sixteen were killed, all of them Nepalis working for guided climbing teams.}}</ref>\n|-\n|8\u201312\n|1996\n|[[1996 Mount Everest disaster]]\n|-\n|6\n|1974\n|[[1974 French Mount Everest expedition|1974 French Mount Everest expedition avalanche]]<ref name=WestRidge1>{{cite web|title=The West Ridge Direct|url=http://www.everesthistory.com/climbers/stremfeli.htm|publisher=everesthistory.com|accessdate=9 June 2011}}</ref>\n|-\n|6\n|1970\n|[[1970 Mount Everest disaster]]\n|}\nAnother very deadly event was in 1995, when 42 died near Everest in a large avalanche.<ref name=\"bt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/news-asia/2014/04/19/12-guides-killed-worst-ever-mt-everest-accident|title=12 guides killed in worst ever Mt Everest accident &#124; The Brunei Times|publisher=bt.com.bn|accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"reuters\">{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3115818 |title=FACTBOX - World's deadliest mountaineering disasters 2008 |author=Reuters Editorial|publisher=reuters.com|accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Deaths by nationality ==\n\n''*with at least two deaths''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Nationality\n!Count\n|-\n|  {{flagcountry|NEP}}\n|111\n|-\n|{{flagcountry|India}}\n|19\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|Japan}}\n|19\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|United Kingdom}}\n|17\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|United States}}\n|15\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|China}}\n|12\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|South Korea}}\n|11\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|Australia}}\n|7\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|Germany}}\n|7\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|Poland}}\n|7\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|Russia}}\n|7\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|Canada}}\n|6\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|France}}\n|6\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|Czechoslovakia}}\n|5\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|Spain}}\n|4\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|Bulgaria}}\n|3\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|Ireland}}\n|3\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|Italy}}\n|3\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|New Zealand}}\n|3\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|Switzerland}}\n|3\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|Austria}}\n|2\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|Czech Republic}}\n|2\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|Denmark}}\n|2\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|Hungary}}\n|2\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|Slovenia}}\n|2\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|Taiwan}}\n|2\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|Yugoslavia}}/{{flagcountry|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia}}\n|2\n|-\n| Other/Unknown\n|13\n|}\n\n== Cause of death ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Cause\n!Count\n|-\n|[[Avalanche]]\n|68\n|-\n|[[Falling (accident)|Fall]]\n|67\n|-\n|Exposure\n|27\n|-\n|[[Altitude sickness]]\n|21\n|-\n|[[Cardiac arrest]]\n|11\n|-\n|Exhaustion and/or exposure\n|8\n|-\n|[[Fatigue (medical)|Exhaustion]]\n|7\n|-\n|[[Serac]]\n|6\n|-\n|[[Cerebral edema|Cerebral oedema]]\n|7\n|-\n|[[Stroke]]\n|2\n|-\n|[[Frostbite]]\n|1\n|-\n|'''''Other'''''\n|15\n|-\n|'''''Unknown cause'''''\n|52\n|}\n\n==Astronaut fatality==\n[[File:Henize.jpg|thumb|Henize had been in space (see [[STS-51-F]] space mission) and co-authored many science papers]]\nOne of the people claimed by Everest mountaineering was the U.S. astronaut [[Karl Gordon Henize]].
