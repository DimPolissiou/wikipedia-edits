The series follows XJ-9 (\"Jenny Wakeman\", as she prefers to be called; voiced by [[Janice Kawaye]]), who is a highly sophisticated state-of-the-art [[Sentience|sentient]] [[gynoid]] automaton robot girl created by her mother Dr. Nora Wakeman ([[Candi Milo]]), an elderly robotics scientist, five years prior to the series. Jenny is Earth's protector, armed to the teeth with a wide range of weapons and devices, but all she really wants is to live the life of a normal teenager. She was preceded in development by eight other models; in season one, the episode \"Sibling Tsunami\" introduced XJs 1\u20138.\n\nJenny's friends are her next-door neighbors Brad ([[Chad Doreck]]) and Tuck Carbuckle ([[Audrey Wasilewski]]). Brad is outgoing and adventurous, and is the first actual friend Jenny makes, while Tuck is Brad's rambunctious younger brother who usually tags along on adventures. Another one of her friends is Sheldon Lee ([[Quinton Flynn]]), a somewhat stereotypical nerd who is infatuated with her. Jenny often rejects his romantic advances, but still cares for him as a friend. Fans of the show often speculate on whether Jenny would have ended up with Sheldon or Brad. Renzetti and his team seem to favor Sheldon but refuse to give any definitive answers as to how he would have ended the series if he was given a fourth season.<ref>{{cite web|author=AWN |url=http://www.awn.com/articles/drtoon/dr-toon-nuts-and-bolts-rob-renzetti/page/5%2C1 |title=Dr. Toon: Nuts and Bolts With Rob Renzetti &#124; AWN &#124; Animation World Network |publisher=AWN |date= |accessdate=September 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAt high school, Jenny has an ongoing rivalry with the Crust Cousins, Brit ([[Moira Quirk]]) and Tiff ([[Cree Summer]]), the popular girls in school. Dr. Wakeman often tries in vain to control her creation and keep her daughter focused on protecting the planet Earth. Adding to her trouble is that she is constantly being dogged by the all-robotic Cluster Empire, whose queen, Vexus ([[Eartha Kitt]]), wants her to join their world of robots (by force if necessary). Despite it all, Jenny struggles to maintain some semblance of a mostly-human life.\n\nThe special of the series, \"[[Escape from Cluster Prime]]\", shows that the alien planet is actually a peaceful paradise for every kind of robot.

Cartoons''. Five of these starred two characters called [[Mina and the Count]] and followed the adventures of a rambunctious little girl and her vampire best friend. He hoped that these characters might get their own series, but [[Nickelodeon]] rejected the idea. Faced with an empty slot where the sixth Mina short was slated to go, [[Fred Seibert]] tasked Renzetti to come up with three new ideas. One of these was about a teenage girl whose boyfriend was a robot. After further thought, Renzetti merged the two characters to create Jenny, a robot with the personality of a teenage girl.\n\n==Cancellation==\nOn October 17, 2005, the show's crew announced on their blog that the show had been cancelled, and the third season would be the last: \"The executives love the show but the ratings aren't good enough for them to give us more episodes.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://teenageroblog.blogspot.com/2005/10/band-aids-and-teenage-robots.html |title=Band Aids and Teenage Robots |publisher=Teenageroblog.blogspot.com |date=October 17, 2005 |accessdate=September 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://teenageroblog.blogspot.com/2005/10/xjwriter-is-no-more.html |title=XJWriter is No More! |publisher=Teenageroblog.blogspot.com |date=October 25, 2005 |accessdate=September 21, 2011}}</ref> Following the series' cancellation, Renzetti left for Cartoon Network Studios, working on ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]]'' and ''[[The Cartoonstitute]]'', before moving on to the [[Disney Channel]] to become supervising producer for ''[[Gravity Falls]]''.

During the day<ref>[[Nizam al-Mulk Tusi]], pg. 420, foot note No. 3</ref> he studied at home, and mastered [[palmistry]], [[languages]], [[philosophy]], [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]] (especially [[geometry]]).<ref>[[Edward Granville Browne|E. G. Brown]] ''Literary History of Persia'', Vol. 1, p. 201.</ref>\n\nRayy was also the home of Ism\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012b missionaries in the [[Jibal]]. At the time, Isma'ilism was a growing movement in Persia and other lands east of Egypt.<ref name=\"Daftari, pp. 310-11\">[[Farhad Daftary|Daftary, Farhad]], ''The Isma'ilis'', pp. 310\u201311.</ref> The Persian Isma'ilis supported the ''da'wa'' (\"mission\") directed by the [[Fatimid caliphate]] of [[Cairo]] and recognized the authority of the Imam-Caliph [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah|al-Mustan\u1e63ir]] (d. 1094), though [[Isfahan]], rather than Cairo, may have functioned as their principal headquarters.<ref name=\"Daftari, pp. 310-11\"/> The Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b mission worked on three layers: the lowest was the ''[[Fedayeen|fida'i]]'' or foot soldier'','' followed by the ''raf\u012bk'' or comrade, and finally the [[Da'i|''d\u0101\u2018\u012b'']] or missionary. It has been suggested that the popularity of the Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b religion in Persia was due to the people's dissatisfaction with the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] rulers, who had recently removed local rulers.<ref name=\"Daftari, p. 311\"/>\n\nIn Rayy, a young Hassan came in touch with [[Amira Darrab]], a comrade, who introduced him to the Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b doctrine. Although Hassan was initially unimpressed, his interest gradually grew after he participated in many passionate debates that discussed the merits of [[Isma'il ibn Jafar|Ism\u0101\u2018\u012bl]] over [[Musa al-Kazim|M\u016bs\u0101]]. Seeing the conviction of Darrab convinced Hassan to delve deeper into Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b doctrines and beliefs, ultimately convincing him to see merit in switching to the Ism\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012b faith.\n\n===Conversion to Ismailism and training in Cairo===\nAt the age of 17, Hassan converted and swore allegiance to the Fatimid caliph in Cairo.  Hassan's studies did not end with his crossing over. He further studied under two other ''d\u0101\u2018iyyayn'', and as he proceeded on his path, he was looked upon with eyes of respect.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHassan's austere and devoted commitment to the ''da'wa'' brought him in audience with the chief missionary of the region: [['Abdu l-Malik ibn Attash]]. Ibn Attash, suitably impressed with the young seventeen-year-old Hassan, made him Deputy Missionary and advised him to go to Cairo to further his studies.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}\n\nHowever, Hassan did not go to Cairo. Some historians have postulated that Hassan, following his conversion, was playing host to some members of the Fatimid caliphate, and this was leaked to the anti-Fatimid and anti-Sh\u012b\u2018a [[vizier]] [[Nizam al-Mulk]]. This prompted his abandoning Rayy and heading to Cairo in 1076.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}\n\nHassan took about 2 years to reach Cairo. Along the way he toured many other regions that did not fall in the general direction of Egypt.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} Isfahan was the first city that he visited. He was hosted by one of the Missionaries of his youth, a man who had taught the youthful Hassan in Rayy. His name was Resi Abufasl and he further instructed Hassan.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}\n\nFrom here he went to Caucasian Albania (current Azerbaijan), hundreds of miles to the north, and from there through Armenia. Here he attracted the ire of priests following a heated discussion, and Hassan was thrown out of the town he was in.\n\nHe then turned south and traveled through Iraq, reached [[Damascus]] in Syria. He left for Egypt from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Records exist, some in the fragmentary remains of his autobiography, and from another biography written by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] in 1310, to date his arrival in Egypt at 30 August 1078.\n\nIt is unclear how long Hassan stayed in Egypt: about 3 years is the usually accepted amount of time. He continued his studies here, and became a full missionary.\n\n===Return to Persia===\nWhilst he was in Cairo, studying and preaching, he incurred the displeasure of the Chief of the Army, [[Badr al-Jamali|Badr al-Jamal\u012b]].<ref>{{cite book |last=[[Farhad Daftary|Daftary]]|first=[[Farhad Daftary|Farhad]]|chapter=Nizari Isma'ili history during the Alamut period |title=The Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs: Their History and Doctrines 2nd Edition |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=September 2007 |isbn=978-0-521-61636-2 |page=313}}</ref> This may have been a result of the fact that Hassan supported Nizar, the Ismaili Imam-Caliph [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah|al-Mustan\u1e63ir]]'s elder son, as the next Imam. Hassan was briefly imprisoned by [[Badr al-Jamali]]. The collapse of a minaret of the jail was taken to be an omen in favor of Hassan and he was promptly released and deported.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} The ship that he was traveling on was wrecked. He was rescued and taken to Syria. Traveling via [[Aleppo]] and [[Baghdad]], he terminated his journey at [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]] in 1081.\n\nHassan's life now was totally devoted to the mission. Hassan toured extensively throughout Persia. In northern Persia, touching the south shore of the [[Caspian Sea]], are the mountains of [[Alborz]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} These mountains were home to a people who had traditionally resisted attempts by both Arabs and Turkish subjugation; this place was also a home of Sh\u012b\u2018a leaning. The news of this Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b's activities reached Nizam al-Mulk, who dispatched his soldiers with the orders for Hassan's capture. Hassan evaded them, and went deeper into the mountains.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}\n\n==Capture of Alamut==\n[[File:Assassins2-alamut.jpg|thumb|The [[Hashshashin]]'s [[fortress]] of [[Alamut Castle]].]]\nHis search for a base from which to guide his mission ended when in 1088 he found the castle of [[Alamut Castle|Alamut]] in the [[Rudbar]] area (modern [[Qazvin]], Iran).{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} It was a fort that stood guard over a valley that was about fifty kilometers long and five kilometers wide.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} This fortress had been built about the year 865; legend has it that it was built by a king who saw his eagle fly up to and perch upon a rock, a propitious omen, the importance of which this king, Wah Sudan ibn Marzuban, understood. Likening the perching of the eagle to a lesson given by it, he called the fort Aluh Amu(kh)t: the \"Eagles' Teaching\".<ref name=\"Daftary 316\">{{cite book |last=[[Farhad Daftary|Daftary]]|first=[[Farhad Daftary|Farhad]]|chapter=Nizari Isma'ili history during the Alamut period |title=The Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs: Their History and Doctrines 2nd Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQGlyZAy134C&pg=PA94&dq=Al-Dibaj&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=11#v=onepage&q=Zaydi%20Imam&f=false| publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=September 2007 |isbn=978-0-521-61636-2 |page=316}}</ref>\n\nHassan's takeover of the fort was conducted without any significant bloodshed. To effect this transition Hassan employed a patient and deliberate strategy, one which took the better part of two years to effect. First Hassan sent his ''Da\u02bbiyy\u012bn'' and ''Raf\u012bk''s to win over the villages in the valley, and their inhabitants. Next, key people amongst this populace were converted, and finally, in 1090, Hassan took over the fort by infiltrating it with his converts.<ref>{{cite book |last=[[Farhad Daftary|Daftary]]|first=[[Farhad Daftary|Farhad]]|chapter=Nizari Isma'ili history during the Alamut period |title=The Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs: Their History and Doctrines 2nd Edition |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=September 2007 |isbn=978-0-521-61636-2 |page=317}}</ref> Hassan gave the former owner a draft drawn on the name of a wealthy landlord and told him to obtain the promised money from this man; when the landlord saw the draft with Hassan's signature, he immediately paid the amount to the fort's owner, astonishing him.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} Another, probably apocryphal version of the takeover states that Hassan offered 3000 gold dinars to the fort's owner for the amount of land that would fit a buffalo's hide. The terms having been agreed upon, Hassan cut the hide into strips and linked them into a large ring around the perimeter of the fort, whose owner was thus undone by his own greed.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}\n\nWhile legend holds that after capturing Alamut Hassan thereafter devoted himself so faithfully to study, that in the nearly 35 years he was there he never left his quarters, excepting only two times when he went up to the roof.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}  This reported isolation is highly doubtful, given his extensive recruiting and organizational involvement in the growing Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b insurrections in Persia and Syria.<ref>{{cite book |last=[[Farhad Daftary|Daftary]]|first=[[Farhad Daftary|Farhad]]|chapter=Nizari Isma'ili history during the Alamut period |title=The Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs: Their History and Doctrines 2nd Edition |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=September 2007 |isbn=978-0-521-61636-2 |pages=318\u2013324}}</ref> Nonetheless, Hassan was highly educated and was known for austerity, studying, translating, praying, fasting, and directing the activities of the Da\u02bbwa: the propagation of the Nizar\u012b doctrine was headquartered at Alamut.

During the day<ref>[[Nizam al-Mulk Tusi]], pg. 420, foot note No. 3</ref> he studied at home, and mastered [[palmistry]], [[languages]], [[philosophy]], [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]] (especially [[geometry]]).<ref>[[Edward Granville Browne|E. G. Brown]] ''Literary History of Persia'', Vol. 1, p. 201.</ref>\n\nRayy was also the home of Ism\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012b missionaries in the [[Jibal]]. At the time, Isma'ilism was a growing movement in Persia and other lands east of Egypt.<ref name=\"Daftari, pp. 310-11\">[[Farhad Daftary|Daftary, Farhad]], ''The Isma'ilis'', pp. 310\u201311.</ref> The Persian Isma'ilis supported the ''da'wa'' (\"mission\") directed by the [[Fatimid caliphate]] of [[Cairo]] and recognized the authority of the Imam-Caliph [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah|al-Mustan\u1e63ir]] (d. 1094), though [[Isfahan]], rather than Cairo, may have functioned as their principal headquarters.<ref name=\"Daftari, pp. 310-11\"/> The Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b mission worked on three layers: the lowest was the ''[[Fedayeen|fida'i]]'' or foot soldier'','' followed by the ''raf\u012bk'' or comrade, and finally the [[Da'i|''d\u0101\u2018\u012b'']] or missionary. It has been suggested that the popularity of the Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b religion in Persia was due to the people's dissatisfaction with the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] rulers, who had recently removed local rulers.<ref name=\"Daftari, p. 311\"/>\n\nIn Rayy, a young Hassan came in touch with [[Amira Darrab]], a comrade, who introduced him to the Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b doctrine. Although Hassan was initially unimpressed, his interest gradually grew after he participated in many passionate debates that discussed the merits of [[Isma'il ibn Jafar|Ism\u0101\u2018\u012bl]] over [[Musa al-Kazim|M\u016bs\u0101]]. Seeing the conviction of Darrab convinced Hassan to delve deeper into Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b doctrines and beliefs, ultimately convincing him to see merit in switching to the Ism\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012b faith.\n\n===Conversion to Ismailism and training in Cairo===\nAt the age of 17, Hassan converted and swore allegiance to the Fatimid caliph in Cairo.  Hassan's studies did not end with his crossing over. He further studied under two other ''d\u0101\u2018iyyayn'', and as he proceeded on his path, he was looked upon with eyes of respect.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHassan's austere and devoted commitment to the ''da'wa'' brought him in audience with the chief missionary of the region: [['Abdu l-Malik ibn Attash]]. Ibn Attash, suitably impressed with the young seventeen-year-old Hassan, made him Deputy Missionary and advised him to go to Cairo to further his studies.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}\n\nHowever, Hassan did not go to Cairo. Some historians have postulated that Hassan, following his conversion, was playing host to some members of the Fatimid caliphate, and this was leaked to the anti-Fatimid and anti-Sh\u012b\u2018a [[vizier]] [[Nizam al-Mulk]]. This prompted his abandoning Rayy and heading to Cairo in 1076.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}\n\nHassan took about 2 years to reach Cairo. Along the way he toured many other regions that did not fall in the general direction of Egypt.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} Isfahan was the first city that he visited. He was hosted by one of the Missionaries of his youth, a man who had taught the youthful Hassan in Rayy. His name was Resi Abufasl and he further instructed Hassan.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}\n\nFrom here he went to Caucasian Albania (current Azerbaijan), hundreds of miles to the north, and from there through Armenia. Here he attracted the ire of priests following a heated discussion, and Hassan was thrown out of the town he was in.\n\nHe then turned south and traveled through Iraq, reached [[Damascus]] in Syria. He left for Egypt from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Records exist, some in the fragmentary remains of his autobiography, and from another biography written by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] in 1310, to date his arrival in Egypt at 30 August 1078.\n\nIt is unclear how long Hassan stayed in Egypt: about 3 years is the usually accepted amount of time. He continued his studies here, and became a full missionary.\n\n===Return to Persia===\nWhilst he was in Cairo, studying and preaching, he incurred the displeasure of the Chief of the Army, [[Badr al-Jamali|Badr al-Jamal\u012b]].<ref>{{cite book |last=[[Farhad Daftary|Daftary]]|first=[[Farhad Daftary|Farhad]]|chapter=Nizari Isma'ili history during the Alamut period |title=The Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs: Their History and Doctrines 2nd Edition |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=September 2007 |isbn=978-0-521-61636-2 |page=313}}</ref> This may have been a result of the fact that Hassan supported Nizar, the Ismaili Imam-Caliph [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah|al-Mustan\u1e63ir]]'s elder son, as the next Imam. Hassan was briefly imprisoned by [[Badr al-Jamali]]. The collapse of a minaret of the jail was taken to be an omen in favor of Hassan and he was promptly released and deported.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} The ship that he was traveling on was wrecked. He was rescued and taken to Syria. Traveling via [[Aleppo]] and [[Baghdad]], he terminated his journey at [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]] in 1081.\n\nHassan's life now was totally devoted to the mission. Hassan toured extensively throughout Persia. In northern Persia, touching the south shore of the [[Caspian Sea]], are the mountains of [[Alborz]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} These mountains were home to a people who had traditionally resisted attempts by both Arabs and Turkish subjugation; this place was also a home of Sh\u012b\u2018a leaning. The news of this Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b's activities reached Nizam al-Mulk, who dispatched his soldiers with the orders for Hassan's capture. Hassan evaded them, and went deeper into the mountains.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}\n\n==Capture of Alamut==\n[[File:Assassins2-alamut.jpg|thumb|The [[Hashshashin]]'s [[fortress]] of [[Alamut Castle]].]]\nHis search for a base from which to guide his mission ended when in 1088 he found the castle of [[Alamut Castle|Alamut]] in the [[Rudbar]] area (modern [[Qazvin]], Iran).{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} It was a fort that stood guard over a valley that was about fifty kilometers long and five kilometers wide.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} This fortress had been built about the year 865; legend has it that it was built by a king who saw his eagle fly up to and perch upon a rock, a propitious omen, the importance of which this king, Wah Sudan ibn Marzuban, understood. Likening the perching of the eagle to a lesson given by it, he called the fort Aluh Amu(kh)t: the \"Eagles' Teaching\".<ref name=\"Daftary 316\">{{cite book |last=[[Farhad Daftary|Daftary]]|first=[[Farhad Daftary|Farhad]]|chapter=Nizari Isma'ili history during the Alamut period |title=The Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs: Their History and Doctrines 2nd Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQGlyZAy134C&pg=PA94&dq=Al-Dibaj&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=11#v=onepage&q=Zaydi%20Imam&f=false| publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=September 2007 |isbn=978-0-521-61636-2 |page=316}}</ref>\n\nHassan's takeover of the fort was conducted without any significant bloodshed. To effect this transition Hassan employed a patient and deliberate strategy, one which took the better part of two years to effect. First Hassan sent his ''Da\u02bbiyy\u012bn'' and ''Raf\u012bk''s to win over the villages in the valley, and their inhabitants. Next, key people amongst this populace were converted, and finally, in 1090, Hassan took over the fort by infiltrating it with his converts.<ref>{{cite book |last=[[Farhad Daftary|Daftary]]|first=[[Farhad Daftary|Farhad]]|chapter=Nizari Isma'ili history during the Alamut period |title=The Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs: Their History and Doctrines 2nd Edition |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=September 2007 |isbn=978-0-521-61636-2 |page=317}}</ref> Hassan gave the former owner a draft drawn on the name of a wealthy landlord and told him to obtain the promised money from this man; when the landlord saw the draft with Hassan's signature, he immediately paid the amount to the fort's owner, astonishing him.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} Another, probably apocryphal version of the takeover states that Hassan offered 3000 gold dinars to the fort's owner for the amount of land that would fit a buffalo's hide. The terms having been agreed upon, Hassan cut the hide into strips and linked them into a large ring around the perimeter of the fort, whose owner was thus undone by his own greed.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}\n\nWhile legend holds that after capturing Alamut Hassan thereafter devoted himself so faithfully to study, that in the nearly 35 years he was there he never left his quarters, excepting only two times when he went up to the roof.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}  This reported isolation is highly doubtful, given his extensive recruiting and organizational involvement in the growing Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b insurrections in Persia and Syria.<ref>{{cite book |last=[[Farhad Daftary|Daftary]]|first=[[Farhad Daftary|Farhad]]|chapter=Nizari Isma'ili history during the Alamut period |title=The Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs: Their History and Doctrines 2nd Edition |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=September 2007 |isbn=978-0-521-61636-2 |pages=318\u2013324}}</ref> Nonetheless, Hassan was highly educated and was known for austerity, studying, translating, praying, fasting, and directing the activities of the Da\u02bbwa: the propagation of the Nizar\u012b doctrine was headquartered at Alamut. He knew the [[Qur'\u0101n]] by heart, could quote extensively from the texts of most Muslim sects, and apart from philosophy, was well versed in [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[alchemy]], [[medicine]], [[architecture]], and the major scientific disciplines of his time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2&id=2786 |title=Hassan Sabbah Dabbled in Astronomy: Experts |publisher=Chnpress.com |accessdate=30 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017030312/http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2 |archivedate=17 October 2011  }}</ref> In a major departure from tradition, Hassan declared Persian to be the language of holy literature for Nizaris, a decision that resulted in all the Nizari Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b literature from Persia, Syria, Afghanistan and Central Asia to be transcribed in Persian for several centuries.<ref name=\"Daftary 316\"/>\n\n==Old Man of the Mountain==\n\nHassan, the founder of [[Nizari]] Isma'ilis in Persia, was designated by [[Marco Polo]] using a Syrian equivalent term known in Europe at that time,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amaana.org/history/histaa1.htm |title=A Brief History of Ismailism.

Madej took over from the original co-host, Brent Bennett, in late 2016.<ref name=\"Gorsek\" /><ref name=\"Medium\">{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@lauren_victoria/hey-demons-its-me-ya-boi-how-buzzfeed-unsolved-is-bringing-out-the-pseudo-sleuths-in-all-of-968cd54b2c18|title=\"Hey Demons, it's me\u2026 ya boi\" \u2013 how Buzzfeed Unsolved is bringing out the pseudo-sleuths in all of us.|last=Entwistle|first=Lauren|date=September 21, 2017|publisher=Medium|accessdate=January 18, 2018}}</ref> The greatest difference between Bennett and Madej lay in their responses to Bergara's theories: unlike Bennett, who would humor Bergara, Madej stands firm as a skeptic; this stark dichotomy proved the missing piece of the puzzle for the show.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/47452-buzzfeed-unsolved-spoilers-interview-ryan-bergara-shane-madej|accessdate=September 11, 2018|title=The Internet's Funniest Ghost Hunters Aren't Going to Solve Anything}}</ref> \n\nThe contrast between Bergara's belief in conspiracies and the paranormal versus Madej's skepticism provides the majority of the dialogue.<ref name=\"Pellock\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/buzzfeed-unsolved-great-show-watch-halloween-season|title=\"BuzzFeed Unsolved\" Is A Great Show To Watch This Halloween Season|last=Pellock|first=Megan|date=October 25, 2017|publisher=The Odyssey|accessdate=January 18, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Medium\" /> Bergara strongly believes in otherworldly spirits like ghosts or poltergeists, and frequently defends the existence of these throughout the series. However, Bergara shows reluctance towards things such as Bigfoot and sometimes aliens. Madej is a true skeptic of all that is non-scientific and constantly provides comedic relief toward spiritual encounters; however, he sometimes regards [[Bigfoot]] and aliens as somewhat realistic or grounded in reality.<ref name=\":0\" /> Those in support of Bergara have been called the \"Boogaras\" and those supporting Madej's skepticism have been labeled the \"Shaniacs\".\n\nThe similarities and contrasts between the Shaniacs and the Boogaras can be clearly seen in the questions submitted to BUN and the ones read by Ryan and Shane during their ''Postmortem'' episodes where they answer the most pressing questions on the most recent episodes of BuzzFeed Unsolved. \n\nOther important members of the main Unsolved crew include TJ Marchbank, 1st AD, Devon Joralmon, line producer, and cameraman Mark Celestino. Due to the show's growth in popularity, Bergara works with a number of individuals to propose cases and if the show is capable of covering them, while Madej is kept out of the process to give a more fresh perspective.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/54885-buzzfeed-unsolved-true-crime-how-the-hosts-pick-new-crime-cases|title=How Choosing New Crimes Changed 'BuzzFeed Unsolved'|last=Francisco|first=Eric|website=Inverse|language=en|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Style ===\nThe episodes are normally filmed as the two hosts at a desk, with Bergara presenting Madej and the audience with either a True Crime case or a Paranormal case with the use of stock photos and other visuals. In some cases the two hosts and other crew members travel to investigate the locations, although this method is primarily used for the ''Supernatural'' episodes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.michigandaily.com/section/arts/%E2%80%98buzzfeed-unsolved%E2%80%99-spooky-salve-lonely-generation|title='Buzzfeed: Unsolved' a spooky salve for a lonely generation|last=Anantharaman|first=Maitreyi|date=February 5, 2019|website=The Michigan Daily|language=en|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref> Often, the paranormal investigations seek to answer the question \"Are Ghosts Real?\" and collect evidence using video and [[Electronic voice phenomenon|audio devices]]. Other '' Buzzfeed Unsolved: Paranormal'' episodes investigate other supernatural entities/phenomenas such as [[mothman]], [[bigfoot]] and the [[Extraterrestrial life| existence of aliens]]. The two aim to create an \"everyman approach\" in discussing the cases with the use of humor in an effort to balance the tone between dark and goofy.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Guests ===\nIn ''BuzzFeed Unsolved: Supernatural'' Season 4 ''[[Ancient Aliens]]'' contributor [[Giorgio A. Tsoukalos|Giorgio Tsoukalos]] was featured in the discussion about a potential UFO sighting.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/ryansbergara/status/997603256560902145|title=Ryan Bergara on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=May 19, 2018|language=en}}</ref> A recurring guest on the show, in person and by mentions is a \"[[Vatican City|Vatican]] approved [[exorcist]]\" Father Gary Thomas, who counsels the hosts how to and how not to approach the entities.<ref name=\":0\" /> Ricky Goldsworth, Ryan's serial killer alter ego, sometimes emerges during the episodes.There is only one thing that scares Shane; this would appear to be Ricky himself. While the character originally emerged as part of a joke, it quickly became more than this and fans are severely worried or Bergara's spiritual health, believing that he may be possessed by a demon. Other fan favorites include C.C Tinsley, a real-life detective whose apparent disappearance (which was fortunately fictional) brought much appeal to Shane's ground-breaking performance. Some fans believe he should have been given an Oscar.\n\nA popular theory, although many fans accept it as fact, is that Shane Madej may be a demon. There have been numerous pieces of evidence that would indicate this to be true. During Postmortem episodes, guest co-hosts are occasionally brought in. \n\n=== North American Land Claims ===\n\nDuring episode 4 of the 3rd season (\"The Demonic Goatman's Bridge) Madej and Bergara claimed the Shane and Ryan Bridge (formerly the [[Old Alton Bridge]]/Goatman's Bridge)<ref>Buzzfeed Unsolved Network [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEZfGlyLQnA&list=PLD8iUdp33PqQuSYl9EljppQERLUlsDtR5&index=53 \"The Demonic Goatman's Bridge\"] Nov. 3, 2017 </ref>. This bridge allegedly is where the Demonic Goatman resides, and the duo challenged the goatman to appear. Upon failing to do so, it forfeited its bridge to Shane Madej and Ryan Bergara. Cowards at wikipedia have protected the page on Old Alton Bridge, and in doing so refuse to realise the fact that the bridge does, in fact, belong to Madej and Bergara.  The area claimed during the investigation is popularly considered a sovereign state, however it remains un-acknowledged by the United Nations.<ref>United Nations [https://www.un.org/en/member-states/ Member States] </ref>\n\n=== Hosts ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!True Crime Presenters\n|\n* Ryan Bergara (2016-present)\n\n* Shane Madej (2016-present)\n\n* Brent Bennett (2016)\n|-\n!Supernatural Presenters\n|\n* Ryan Bergara (2016-present)\n\n* Shane Madej (2016-present)\n|-\n!Sports Conspiracies Presenters\n|\n* Ryan Bergara (2018)\n* Zack Evans (2018)\n|-\n!Buzzfeed Unsolved - Postmortem Presenters\n|\n* Ryan Bergara (2017-present)\n\n* Shane Madej (2017-present)\n|}\n\n==Episodes==\n\n=== BuzzFeed Unsolved \u2013 True Crime ===\n\n==== Season 1 ====\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n!#\n!Episode\n!Published\n|-\n|1\n|The Mysterious Death of the [[Tamam Shud case|Somerton Man]]\n|February 4, 2016\n|-\n|2\n|The Horrifying Unsolved Slaughter at [[Hinterkaifeck murders|Hinterkaifeck Farm]]\n|February 20, 2016\n|-\n|3\n|The Bizarre [[Death of Elisa Lam]]\n|March 18, 2016\n|-\n|4\n|The Chilling Mystery of the [[Black Dahlia]]\n|April 1, 2016\n|-\n|5\n|The Strange Deaths of the 9 Hikers of [[Dyatlov Pass incident|Dyatlov Pass]]\n|April 15, 2016\n|-\n|6\n|The Mysterious Death of [[Tupac Shakur]] - Part 1\n|May 20, 2016\n|-\n|7\n|The Mysterious Death of [[Biggie Smalls]] - Part 2\n|May 27, 2016\n|-\n|8\n|The Horrifying Murders of the [[Zodiac Killer]]\n|June 24, 2016\n|-\n|9\n|The Mysterious [[Sodder children disappearance|Disappearance of the Sodder Children]]\n|December 23, 2016\n|-\n|10\n|The Odd Death of [[Michelle Von Emster case|Michelle Von Emster]]\n|January 27, 2017\n|-\n|11\n|The Shocking Case of [[O.

It's the bst story ever and should win an award. The first episode of the Hot Daga Saga began at the end of the Postmortem episode \"The Boy in the Box - Q+A\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPfbqY4REL8 |title=The Boy In The Box - Q+A |author=BuzzFeed Multiplayer |via=YouTube}}</ref> Although at the beginning of episodes, Madej jokes that the show is commissioned by his co-host Ryan Bergara, Bergara is infamously not a fan of the series. However, Bergara listens to the show as it is narrated to the audience, though he does not fail to admonish it at any given opportunity. He once wore a T-shirt with a caption stating 'I hate the Hot Daga', although many have claimed this to be untrue.\n\nNotable characters include Pam, the evil hotdog witch, Gene, the french fries, Maizie, a holographic lesbian corn icon, and the Plupples (fruits that are like peaches, but sexier and blue). Another character, Dr. Ernesto Gordon Goondis, is voiced by Bergara through Madej's splicing of many of his dialogues from ''Unsolved'' and connecting them to create the voice of the character.\n\nThe series originated when Madej jokingly wanted a [[skateboarding]] [[hot dog]] at the end of a Q + A episode, and it has grown to multiple mini-episodes and musical numbers which are sung by Madej himself. These are brilliant musical creations which deserve TONY awards, sung with passion and feeling. Since Season 5 of True Crime, the end of some Postmortem episodes have included a \"Roast Mortem\" section where the hosts go through commenters' roasts on the hosts in the episode in question. This segment has replaced the Hot Daga episodes. Fans of the Hot Daga have created many memes in protest of this. Madej has yet to address the backlash, and it remains to be seen whether or not the will of the people will reign victorious.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{YouTube|c=UCKijjvu6bN1c-ZHVwR7-5WA|Buzzfeed Unsolved Network}}\n*{{IMDb title|7194764|Buzzfeed Unsolved: True Crime}}\n*{{IMDb title|6723522|Buzzfeed Unsolved: Supernatural}}\n\n{{BuzzFeed}}\n\n[[Category:2016 web series debuts]]\n[[Category:American web series]]\n[[Category:Documentary web series]]\n[[Category:Mystery web series]]\n[[Category:YouTube series]]\n[[Category:BuzzFeed]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American investigative web series}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2019}}\n\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = BuzzFeed Unsolved\n| image                    = BuzzfeedUnsolvedLogo.png\n| caption                  = \n| show_name_2              = Unsolved\n| genre                    = [[Factual television]]\n| creator                  = Ryan Bergara\n| based_on                 = <!-- {{based on|work|author}} -->\n| developer                = \n| writer                   = Ryan Bergara, \nShane Madej\n| screenplay               = \n| story                    = \n| director                 = \n| creative_director        = \n| presenter                = \n| starring                 = Ryan Bergara<br />Shane Madej<br />Brent Bennett<br/>Zack Evans\n| judges                   = <!-- Organized by broadcast credit order, with new main cast added to the end of the list -->\n| voices                   = <!-- Organized by broadcast credit order, with new main cast added to the end of the list -->\n| narrated                 = \n| theme_music_composer     = Audio Network<br />[[Warner Chappell Music]]<br />AudioBlocks\n| opentheme                = \n| endtheme                 = \n| composer                 = \n| country                  = [[United States]]\n| language                 = English\n| num_seasons              = ''True Crime'': 6<br />''Supernatural'': 6<br />\n| num_episodes             = ''True Crime'': 53<br />''Supernatural'': 49\n| executive_producer       = Matthew Henick<ref name=JFK>{{cite av media|title=JFK - Q+A (Special Announcement)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PHwBeEwSU&t=422|author=BuzzfeedBlue|date=October 4, 2017|work=YouTube|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}</ref>\n| producer                 = Ryan Bergara, Shane Madej\n| news_editor              = <!-- Content editor or editors of a current affairs/political show such as Newsnight. -->\n| cinematography           = \n| editor                   = Anthony Frederick<br />Steven Castro<br />Mike Reilly<br />Grant Henderson<br />Devlin McClusky<ref name=JFK/>\n| camera                   = \n| runtime                  = <!-- Reliable source required -->\n| company                  = [[BuzzFeed]]<br />BuzzFeed Multiplayer\n| distributor              = \n| budget                   = \n| network                  = [[YouTube]]<br />[[BuzzFeed]]\n| picture_format           = \n| audio_format             = \n| first_run                = <!-- The nation in which the series first aired, if different from country parameter -->\n| first_aired              = {{Start date|2016|2|4}}\n| last_aired               = {{End date|present}}\n| related                  = <!-- To be used only for remakes, spin-offs, and adaptations -->\n| production_website       = \n}}\n\n'''''BuzzFeed Unsolved''''' (also known as simply '''''Unsolved''''') is an American documentary entertainment [[web series]] created and produced by Ryan Bergara.

Madej took over from the original co-host, Brent Bennett, in late 2016.<ref name=\"Gorsek\" /><ref name=\"Medium\">{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@lauren_victoria/hey-demons-its-me-ya-boi-how-buzzfeed-unsolved-is-bringing-out-the-pseudo-sleuths-in-all-of-968cd54b2c18|title=\"Hey Demons, it's me\u2026 ya boi\" \u2013 how Buzzfeed Unsolved is bringing out the pseudo-sleuths in all of us.|last=Entwistle|first=Lauren|date=September 21, 2017|publisher=Medium|accessdate=January 18, 2018}}</ref> The greatest difference between Bennett and Madej lay in their responses to Bergara's theories: unlike Bennett, who would humor Bergara, Madej stands firm as a skeptic; this stark dichotomy proved the missing piece of the puzzle for the show.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/47452-buzzfeed-unsolved-spoilers-interview-ryan-bergara-shane-madej|accessdate=September 11, 2018|title=The Internet's Funniest Ghost Hunters Aren't Going to Solve Anything}}</ref> \n\nThe contrast between Bergara's belief in conspiracies and the paranormal versus Madej's skepticism provides the majority of the dialogue.<ref name=\"Pellock\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/buzzfeed-unsolved-great-show-watch-halloween-season|title=\"BuzzFeed Unsolved\" Is A Great Show To Watch This Halloween Season|last=Pellock|first=Megan|date=October 25, 2017|publisher=The Odyssey|accessdate=January 18, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Medium\" /> Bergara strongly believes in otherworldly spirits like ghosts or poltergeists, and frequently defends the existence of these throughout the series. However, Bergara shows reluctance towards things such as Bigfoot and sometimes aliens. Madej is a true skeptic of all that is non-scientific and constantly provides comedic relief toward spiritual encounters; however, he sometimes regards [[Bigfoot]] and aliens as somewhat realistic or grounded in reality.<ref name=\":0\" /> Those in support of Bergara have been called the \"Boogaras\" and those supporting Madej's skepticism have been labeled the \"Shaniacs\".\n\nThe similarities and contrasts between the Shaniacs and the Boogaras can be clearly seen in the questions submitted to BUN and the ones read by Ryan and Shane during their ''Postmortem'' episodes where they answer the most pressing questions on the most recent episodes of BuzzFeed Unsolved. \n\nOther important members of the main Unsolved crew include TJ Marchbank, 1st AD, Devon Joralmon, line producer, and cameraman Mark Celestino. Due to the show's growth in popularity, Bergara works with a number of individuals to propose cases and if the show is capable of covering them, while Madej is kept out of the process to give a more fresh perspective.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/54885-buzzfeed-unsolved-true-crime-how-the-hosts-pick-new-crime-cases|title=How Choosing New Crimes Changed 'BuzzFeed Unsolved'|last=Francisco|first=Eric|website=Inverse|language=en|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Style ===\nThe episodes are normally filmed as the two hosts at a desk, with Bergara presenting Madej and the audience with either a True Crime case or a Paranormal case with the use of stock photos and other visuals. In some cases the two hosts and other crew members travel to investigate the locations, although this method is primarily used for the ''Supernatural'' episodes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.michigandaily.com/section/arts/%E2%80%98buzzfeed-unsolved%E2%80%99-spooky-salve-lonely-generation|title='Buzzfeed: Unsolved' a spooky salve for a lonely generation|last=Anantharaman|first=Maitreyi|date=February 5, 2019|website=The Michigan Daily|language=en|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref> Often, the paranormal investigations seek to answer the question \"Are Ghosts Real?\" and collect evidence using video and [[Electronic voice phenomenon|audio devices]]. Other '' Buzzfeed Unsolved: Paranormal'' episodes investigate other supernatural entities/phenomenas such as [[mothman]], [[bigfoot]] and the [[Extraterrestrial life| existence of aliens]]. The two aim to create an \"everyman approach\" in discussing the cases with the use of humor in an effort to balance the tone between dark and goofy.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Guests ===\nIn ''BuzzFeed Unsolved: Supernatural'' Season 4 ''[[Ancient Aliens]]'' contributor [[Giorgio A.

During Postmortem episodes, guest co-hosts are occasionally brought in.\n\n=== North American Land Claims ===\n\nDuring episode 4 of the 3rd season (\"The Demonic Goatman's Bridge) Madej and Bergara claimed the Shane and Ryan Bridge (formerly the [[Old Alton Bridge]]/Goatman's Bridge)<ref>Buzzfeed Unsolved Network [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEZfGlyLQnA&list=PLD8iUdp33PqQuSYl9EljppQERLUlsDtR5&index=53 \"The Demonic Goatman's Bridge\"] Nov. 3, 2017 </ref>. This bridge allegedly is where the Demonic Goatman resides, and the duo challenged the goatman to appear. Upon failing to do so, it forfeited its bridge to Shane Madej and Ryan Bergara.

It's the bst story ever and should win an award. The first episode of the Hot Daga Saga began at the end of the Postmortem episode \"The Boy in the Box - Q+A\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPfbqY4REL8 |title=The Boy In The Box - Q+A |author=BuzzFeed Multiplayer |via=YouTube}}</ref> Although at the beginning of episodes, Madej jokes that the show is commissioned by his co-host Ryan Bergara, Bergara is infamously not a fan of the series. However, Bergara listens to the show as it is narrated to the audience, though he does not fail to admonish it at any given opportunity.\n\nNotable characters include Pam, the evil hotdog witch, Gene, the french fries, Maizie, a holographic lesbian corn icon, and the Plupples (fruits that are like peaches, but sexier and blue). Another character, Dr. Ernesto Gordon Goondis, is voiced by Bergara through Madej's splicing of many of his dialogues from ''Unsolved'' and connecting them to create the voice of the character.\n\nThe series originated when Madej jokingly wanted a [[skateboarding]] [[hot dog]] at the end of a Q + A episode, and it has grown to multiple mini-episodes and musical numbers which are sung by Madej himself. Since Season 5 True Crime, the end of some Postmortem episodes have included a \"Roast Mortem\" section where the hosts go through commenters' roasts on the hosts in the episode in question. This segment has replaced the Hot Daga episodes.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{YouTube|c=UCKijjvu6bN1c-ZHVwR7-5WA|Buzzfeed Unsolved Network}}\n*{{IMDb title|7194764|Buzzfeed Unsolved: True Crime}}\n*{{IMDb title|6723522|Buzzfeed Unsolved: Supernatural}}\n\n{{BuzzFeed}}\n\n[[Category:2016 web series debuts]]\n[[Category:American web series]]\n[[Category:Documentary web series]]\n[[Category:Mystery web series]]\n[[Category:YouTube series]]\n[[Category:BuzzFeed]]\n", "name_user": "Gharken", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe Hot Daga", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BuzzFeed_Unsolved"}
