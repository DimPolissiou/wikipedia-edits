Guerrilla marketing focuses on taking the consumer by surprise to make a big impression about the product or brand.<ref>What is Guerrilla Marketing, 2015</ref> This in turn creates [[Marketing buzz|buzz]] about the product being marketed. It is a way of advertising that increases consumers' engagement with the product or service, and is designed to create a memorable experience. By creating a memorable experience, it also increases the likelihood that a consumer, or someone who interacted with the campaign, will tell their friends about the product. Thus, via [[Word-of-mouth marketing|word of mouth]], the product or service being advertised reaches more people than initially anticipated.\n\nGuerrilla marketing is relatively inexpensive, and focuses more on reach rather than frequency.{{cn|reason=the next paragraph contradicts this|date=March 2019}} For guerrilla campaigns to be successful, companies don't need to spend large amounts, they just need to have imagination, energy and time.<ref>Bourn, 2009</ref> Therefore, it has the potential to be effective for small businesses, especially if they are competing against bigger companies.\n\nThe message to consumers is often designed to be clear and concise. This type of marketing also works on the [[unconscious mind]],{{cn|date=March 2019}} as purchasing decisions are often made by the unconscious mind. To keep the product or service in the unconscious mind requires repetition, so if a buzz is created around a product, and it is shared amongst friends, it enables repetition.<ref>Bourn, 2009</ref>\n\n==Etymology and origin==\nThe term \"guerrilla marketing\" is traced to [[guerrilla warfare]], which employs atypical tactics to achieve an objective. In 1984, the term guerrilla marketing was introduced by [[Leo Burnett Worldwide|Leo Burnett]]'s creative director [[Jay Conrad Levinson]] in his book ''Guerrilla Marketing''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The 25 Most Influential Business Management Books|journal=Time|author=Josh Sanburn|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2086680_2086683_2087674,00.html|accessdate=April 12, 2016|date=2011-08-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JLgrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OeYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3455,2835554&dq=guerilla-marketing+levinson&hl=en | newspaper = Lawrence Journal-World | date = March 12, 1989 | accessdate = June 5, 2017 | title = 'Guerrilla marketing' gives small firms the edge | author = Linda S.

(magazine)|Inc.]]|accessdate=26 June 2015|location=[[New York City]]|date=August 1995}}</ref> The term itself was from the inspiration of guerrilla warfare which was unconventional [[war]]fare using different techniques from usual and small tactic strategies used by armed civilians. It involves high imagination and energy to execute a guerrilla marketing campaign. This kind of marketing is purely focusing on taking the consumer by surprise, creating a greater impression and eventually leading to buzz through word-of-mouth or social media platforms. Guerrilla marketing is perfect for any small or medium size businesses to bring their product or services to its consumers without investing more money on advertisements. This has also been used by large companies to show the difference from its competitors and to make use of [[Social media marketing|social media campaigns]]. Lately, individuals use unconventional methods of job hunting or to work more.<ref>Marcel Bernard Cova & Marcel Saucet, \"The Secret Lives of Unconventional Campaigns: Street Marketing on the Fringe\", Journal of Marketing Communications, 2014</ref> As a result, the concept of street marketing was born. It has evolved from being only the application of activities on the streets, to be the development of innovative practices of promotion.<ref name=\"Jay Conrad Levinson, 1984\">Jay Conrad Levinson, 1984</ref> For example, one method used by many enterprises to promote their products or services on the streets is the distribution of fliers. This activity does not focus on creativity, but on making publicity on the streets. However, with the passage of time, companies have developed more unconventional techniques to catch the attention of the clients.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Types==\n===Ambient marketing===\n{{Main|Ambient awareness}}\nAmbient communication is advertising presented on elements of the environment, including nearly every available physical surface.<ref name=\"Rossella Gambetti\">{{cite web|title=Ambient Communication: How to Engage Consumers in Urban Touch-Points|author=Rossella Gambetti|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259729300|publisher=ResearchGate|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}</ref> It is a compilation of intelligence, flexibility, and effective use of the atmosphere.

(2008). Marketing, Real People, Real Choices. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, United States of America: Pearson Education.</ref>\n\n===Ambush marketing===\n{{Main|Ambush marketing}}\n[[Ambush marketing]] is a form of associative marketing, used by an organization to capitalize upon the awareness, attention, goodwill, and other benefits, generated by having an association with an event or property, without that organization having an official or direct connection to that event or property.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ambushed!|author=Simon Chadwick And Nicholas Burton|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204731804574391102699362862|newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt is typically seen at major events where rivals of official sponsors attempt to build an association with the event and increase awareness for their brands, sometimes covertly. For example, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] during the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Olympics]] created 'find your Greatness' spots where they featured athletes from several locations called London (but without showing the real London or referring to the Olympic games) which was intended to build a strong association between London Olympics and Nike.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Nathan Sorrell, Nike's Fat Jogger, Vows to Get Thin|author=Rebecca Cullers|url=http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/nathan-sorrell-nikes-fat-jogger-vows-get-thin-142543|magazine=AdWeek|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Stealth marketing===\n{{Main|Stealth marketing}}\n[[Stealth marketing]] is a deliberate act of entering, operating in, or exiting a market in a furtive, secretive or imperceptible manner, or an attempt to do so.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Keeping up with The Joneses: Stealth, secrets, and duplicity in marketing relationships|author1=Ekin Pehlivana |author2=Pierre Berthonb |author3=Mine \u00dc\u00e7ok Hughesc |author4=Jean-Paul Berthond |doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2015.06.002 |volume=58 |issue=6 |journal=Business Horizons |pages=591\u2013598|year=2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Viral/buzz marketing===\n{{Main|Viral marketing}}\n[[Viral marketing]] describes any strategy that encourages individuals to pass on a marketing message to others, creating the potential for exponential growth in the message's exposure and influence. Like viruses, such strategies take advantage of rapid multiplication to explode the message to thousands, to millions. Off the Internet, viral marketing has been referred to as \"word-of-mouth\", \"creating a buzz\", \"leveraging the media\", \"network marketing\", But on the Internet, for better or worse, it's called \"viral marketing\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webmarketingtoday.com/articles/viral-principles/ |title=Practical Ecommerce &#124; Insights for Online Merchants |website=Webmarketingtoday.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-01}}</ref>\n\n{{Main|Buzz marketing}}\n\nSimilarly, [[marketing buzz|buzz marketing]] uses high-profile media to encourage the public to discuss the brand or product.<ref name=\"Solomon, M. 2008\"/> Buzz marketing works best when consumer's responses to a product or service and subsequent endorsements are genuine, without the company paying them. Buzz generated from buzz marketing campaigns is referred to as \"amplified WOM\" (word-of-mouth), and \"organic WOM\" is when buzz occurs naturally by the consumer.<ref name=\"Solomon, M. 2008\"/>\n\n===Grassroots marketing===\n{{Main|Grassroots}}\n[[Grassroots|Grassroots campaigns]] aim to win customers over on an individual basis. A successful grassroots campaign is not about the dissemination of the marketing message in the hope that possible consumers are paying attention, but rather highlights a personal connection between the consumer and the brand and builds a lasting relationship with the brand.<ref>Baker, M. & Hart, S. (2008). The Marketing Book. (6th ed.). Oxford, England: Butterworth-Heinemann.</ref>\n\n===Astroturfing===\n{{Main|Astroturfing}}\n[[Astroturfing]] is among the most controversial guerrilla marketing strategies, and has a high risk factor for the company marketing the product or service.<ref name=\"Jacobs, J. 2012\">Jacobs, J. (2012). Faking it \u2013 how to kill a business through astroturfing on social media. Professional Updates Management, 64(9), 567-570.</ref> Astroturfing derives from artificial \u201c[[Sod|turf]]\u201d, often used in stadiums or tennis courts \u2013 also known as fake grass. Hence, fake endorsements, testimonials and recommendations are all products of Astroturfing in the public relations sector.<ref name=\"Jacobs, J. 2012\"/> Astroturfing involves generating an artificial hype around a particular product or company through a review or discussion on online blogs or forums by an individual who is paid to convey a positive view. This can have a negative and detrimental effect on a company, should the consumer suspect that the review or opinion is not authentic, damaging the company's reputation or even worse, resulting in litigation.<ref name=\"Jacobs, J. 2012\"/>\n\n===Street marketing===\n{{Main|Street marketing}}\n{{See|Tissue-pack marketing}}\n[[Street marketing]] uses unconventional means of advertising or promoting products and brands in public areas. The main goal is to encourage consumers to remember and recall the brand or product marketed. As a division of guerrilla marketing, street marketing is specific to all marketing activities carried out in streets and public areas such as parks, streets, events etc. Street marketing also encompasses advertising outdoors, such as on [[Shopping cart|shopping trolleys]] (shopping carts, in the US), public toilets, sides of cars or public transport, manhole covers, footpaths, rubbish bins, etc.<ref>Berman M. (c2007). Street-Smart Advertising: How to Win the Battle of the Buzz. Plymouth, United Kingdom: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.</ref>\n\nStreet marketing isn't confined to fixed advertisements. It is common practice for organisations to use brand ambassadors who distribute product samples or discount vouchers, and answer queries about the product while emphasizing the brand. The brand ambassadors may be accompanied by a kiosk which contains the product samples or demonstration materials, or they may be wearing a \"walking billboard\". The physical interaction with consumers has a greater influencing power than traditional passive advertising.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketing-schools.org/types-of-marketing/street-marketing.html |title=Street Marketing &#124; What is Street Marketing? |website=Marketing-schools.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-01}}</ref>\n\nStreet marketing is understood as mobilizing not only the space of the streets but also the imagination of the street: that of street culture and street art.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">{{cite journal | last1 = Borghini | first1 = Stefania | last2 = Visconti | first2 = Luca M. | last3 = Anderson | first3 = Laurel | last4 = Sherry Jr | first4 = John F. | year = 2010 | title = Symbiotic postures of commercial advertising and street art: Implications for creativity | url = | journal = Journal of Advertising | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 115\u201328 | doi=10.2753/joa0091-3367390308}}</ref> The [[Y-generation]] broadly consisting of young urbanites (15 \u2013 30 years old), is often put forth as the most susceptible target for the campaigns due to its associations with the culture of the street.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Black | last2 = Neville | year = 2009 | title = Fly-Posting: An Exploration of a 'Controversial' Medium | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing Communications | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 209\u2013226 | doi=10.1080/13527260802091022}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Marcel Saucet and Bernard Cova,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Bernard Cova & Marcel Saucet, \"The Secret Lives of Unconventional Campaigns: Street Marketing on the Fringe\", Journal of Marketing Communications, 2014</ref> street marketing can be used as a general term encompassing six principal types of activities:\n* '''Distribution of flyers or products'''\nThis activity is more traditional and is the most common form of street marketing employed by brands.\n* '''Product animations'''\nThis consists of personalizing a high-traffic space using brand imagery. The idea is to create a micro-universe in order to promote a new product or service.\n* '''Human animations'''\nThe goal of such actions is to create a space in which the brand's message is communicated through human activity.\n* '''Road shows'''\nThis form of mobile presentation is based on the development of means of transport: Taxi, bike, Segway, etc.\n* '''Uncovered actions'''\nThese activities involve the customization of street elements.\n* '''Event actions'''\nThese activities take the form of spectacles, such as [[flash mob]]s or contests. The idea is to promote a product, service or brand value through organization of a public event.\n\n==Typical procedure==\nFirst, enterprises identify the public places where the campaign can be developed such as beaches, cultural events, close to schools, sporting events and recreation areas for children.<ref>Marcel Saucet & Bernard Cova, 2014</ref> Next, companies have to develop a plan to get close to different media and the target market.<ref name=\"Rossella Gambetti\"/> In order to attract attention, street marketing events not only involve unusual activities, but use technology as part of the events. The purpose is to increase the value of the campaigns and get potential consumers' attention.<ref>{{cite journal|ssrn=2411026 |title=The Secret Lives of Unconventional Campaigns: Street Marketing on the Fringe by Bernard Cova, Marcel Saucet :: SSRN |url=http://Papers.ssrn.com |date= 2014-03-18|accessdate=2017-03-01|last1=Saucet |first1=Marcel |last2=Cova |first2=Bernard }}</ref>\n\nBesides, the plans that companies develop take into account that guerrilla or street marketing involves global communication and interaction not only with the customers or the media.<ref name=\"Goldberg\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=48201%20|title=Taryn Rose Launches Dresr: Street Marketing a Luxury Brand - Case - Harvard Business School|last=Goldberg|first=Lena G.|date=2014-11-06|website=Hbs.edu|accessdate=2017-03-01}}</ref> They are also developed to identify opportunities and collect enough information about products, markets and competitors. For example, for business it is important that customers stay with them, instead of choosing the competitors\u2019 offers. They implement innovative strategies with which they will not lose position in the market, and they consider supplementation with other advertisement through other mediums, such as radio and television, when using street marketing.<ref>Jay Conrad Levinson, 1984;Marcel Saucet & Bernard Cova, 2014</ref>{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThere are various examples of strategies that are used in guerrilla marketing. One of them is to provide offers to increase sales. In many cases, businesses do not only supply their products or services to be recognized, but they also offer other things for free. Another instance is to present a fundraiser offer. The point of this strategy is to help other organizations, such as schools, by offering them money. Most companies implement this method not only to increase their sales, but to improve their reputation and image among the community. Finally, there is a strategy called \"team selling\" that consists of conforming groups of people, the majority of them young, who go knocking the doors of different houses in a neighborhood. They do this in order to help companies promoting and selling their products or services.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nWhen doing guerrilla marketing or street marketing, organizations also consider focusing on the psychological approach. For many companies, this implies if they are having success or not. Street marketing focuses on some psychological aspects to know customers' behavior and preferences. For example, certain psychological areas study how people's brains are divided: 45% of people are left-brained, 45% are right brained, and 10% are balanced. Left-brained persons tend to be logical, right-brained ones tend to be emotional, and the rest combine the two. Then, according to the product or service that enterprises provide, and also the kind of customer, businesses decides the way they are going to manage their street marketing campaigns. Besides, almost all the enterprises base their street marketing campaigns on repeating the messages they spread among their customers. Repetition is related to the unconscious part of the mind. This is the one in charge of making decisions. It lets people know what they are going to choose, as well as what they are going to buy. Businesses follow the principle that establishes that, the more people paying attention to the campaign, the more possibilities that campaign has for being remembered.\n\nWhen a company decides to do a guerrilla marketing campaign which could be anything out of viral, ambient, ambush, street or stealth, the focus for them is to meet the objectives. The main objectives for them are:\n* To create enough buzz to serve in word-of-mouth, helping the brand to establish well with its products.\n* To touch most of the five sensory identities of the customer/consumer enhancing personal experience with the brand and building good reputation.\n* To reach the target successfully by taking the brand to them in their daily routine.\nThrough the experience and the ephemeral feelings shared between the company and the target, advertisers and agencies generate a feeling of intimacy that resonates beyond the encounter. This feeling of nearness becomes all the more lasting as the affected individuals relive this encounter on the internet through social media.<ref>Bernard Cova and Marcel Saucet, Unconventional Marketing: from Guerrilla to Consumer Made,\" in Routledge Companion on The Future of Marketing, Routledge, September 2013.</ref>\n\n==Strategy==\nThe guerrilla marketing promotion strategy was first identified by [[Jay Conrad Levinson]] in his book ''Guerrilla Marketing'' (1984).The book describes hundreds of \"guerrilla marketing weapons\" in use at the time. Guerrilla marketers need to be creative in devising unconventional methods of promotion to maintain the public's interest in a product or service. Levinson writes that when implementing guerrilla marketing tactics, smaller organizations and [[entrepreneurs]] are actually at an advantage. Ultimately, however, guerrilla marketers must \"deliver the goods.\" In ''The Guerrilla Marketing Handbook'', the authors write: \"...in order to sell a product or a service, a company must establish a relationship with the customer. It must build trust and support the customer's needs, and it must provide a product that delivers the promised benefits...\"<ref name=\"handbook\">''The Guerrilla Marketing Handbook''; Levinson, Jay Conrad; Godin, Seth; Mariner Books; November 1994; {{ISBN|0395700132}}; accessed March 2014.</ref>\n\n==Online guerilla marketing==\nThe web is rife with examples of guerrilla marketing, to the extent that many of us don't notice its presence - until a particularly successful campaign arises. The desire for instant gratification of internet users provides an avenue for guerrilla marketing by allowing businesses to combine [[wait marketing]] with guerrilla tactics. Simple examples consist of using 'loading' pages or image alt texts to display an entertaining or informative message to users waiting to access the content they were trying to get to. As users dislike waiting with no occupation on the web, it is essential, and easy, to capture their attention this way. Other website methods include interesting web features such as engaging landing pages.\n\nMany online marketing strategies also use social media such as [[Facebook]] and [[LinkedIn]] to begin campaigns, share-able features and event host events. Other companies run competitions or discounts based on encouraging users to share or create content related to their product. Viral videos are an incredibly popular form of guerrilla marketing in which companies film entertaining or surprising videos that internet users are likely to share and enjoy, that subtly advertise their service or product. Some companies such as [[Google]] even create interactive elements like the themed Google logo games to spark interest and engagement. These dynamic guerrilla marketing tactics can become news globally and give businesses considerable publicity.\n\n==Examples==\nThere are various organizations who have implemented the guerrilla and street marketing strategies. The majority of them are small companies, but there are also big companies that have involved in the guerrilla and street marketing environment.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Bernard Cova and Marcel Saucet, Unconventional Marketing: from Guerrilla to Consumer Made,\" in Routledge Companion on The Future of Marketing, Routledge, September 2013</ref> Most of the examples of the strategies that both small and big enterprises have put into action include costumed persons, the distribution of tickets, people providing samples, among others.\nAs stated before, one guerrilla marketing conventional method that is used by many businesses is to provide fliers. The goal is to create awareness on the customers about what the enterprise is doing. One example of this took place in [[Montpelier, Vermont]], where the [[New England Culinary Institute]] (NECI) sent a group of students to a movie theatre to hand out 400 fliers. Those fliers had coupons in which NECI was inviting people to go to its monthly Theme Dinners. Another company, Boston's Kung-Fu Tai Chi Club, chose the option of disseminating fliers instead of placing its advertisements on the newspapers. The purpose of the fliers was to promote the company's self-defence classes for women.\n\nOther businesses apply the technique of sending disguised people to promote things on the streets. For example, [[match.com]] organized a street marketing activity in the \u201cFeria del Libro\u201d (\u201cBook Fair\u201d) in Madrid. It consisted of a man dressed like a prince who was walking among the crowd looking for his \u201creal love\u201d. He had a glass slipper and even got to try the shoe on some people. A woman behind him was giving bookmarks to the people which contained messages such as \u201cTimes have changed; the way to find love, too\u201d or \u201cYou have been reading love stories all your life; experience yours on Match.com\u201d. Also, in Madrid and Barcelona, Nokia developed a campaign called \u201cAvestruz\u201d (\u201cOstrich\u201d) to promote the 5500 and 5700 mobiles. In the campaign, a group of real-size ostrich puppets tried to interact with young people in order to let them know these mobiles provide a high-quality MP3 playback. The puppets were holding their own telephones and listening to the music. When a young person appeared, the puppet tried to catch his/her attention to show him/her the quality of the mobile. The reason why Nokia decided to use ostriches was that they are big animals, so people could easily look at them.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThere are enterprises that disseminate passes or tickets to different events. For example, Sony invests on joining promoters and tells them that they have to infiltrate in public meetings. What they have to do is to distribute free tickets to concerts and other musical events sponsored by the company . Another instance is the Spanish company Clickair (an extension of Iberia airlines), that developed a campaign in which a group of five people had to walk through Barcelona streets dressed as Euros. The group was supplying approximately 3,000 tickets to promote different Clickair destinations. The people who first sent a text message with the required information would get free tickets to go on a trip. In the end, the company received a total of 3,390 messages.\nAlong with these examples, there are other street marketing techniques that are even more unusual. Lee Jeans, a French company dedicated to the selling of jeans, promoted the opening of their new store in rue des Rosiers in Paris. The method they applied consisted of distributing denims, as well as denim accessories, on the different streets of the neighborhood. Furthermore, in Italy, the members of the company Nintendo put into action a campaign in which they used post-it's to promote the Wii console. They pasted several post-it with the shapes of some characters from different video games. Those images were placed as if they were billboards on the streets. \u201cWii not forget\u201d, the name of the campaign, and a brief explanation of it, were the words written on the post-its.\nIn some cases, some street marketing may incite the ire of local authorities; such was the case in Houston, Texas, when BMW's ad agency (Street Factory Media in Minneapolis)attached a replication, made from Styrofoam, of a Mini-Cooper to the side of a downtown building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.actu-cci.com/videos/293-street-marketing-by-marcel-saucet |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502075919/http://en.actu-cci.com/videos/293-street-marketing-by-marcel-saucet |archivedate=2014-05-02 }}</ref> For the cost of a small city-issued fine, the company received front page advertising on the Houston Chronicle.\n\n[[Sony Ericsson]] used an undercover campaign in 2002 when they hired 60 actors in ten major cities and had them accost strangers and ask them: \"Would you mind taking my picture?\" The actor then handed the target a brand new picture phone while talking about how cool the new device was. \"And thus an act of civility was converted into a branding event.<ref>''The Hidden (In Plain Sight) Persuaders''; Walker, Rob;  \"[[The New York Times Magazine]];\" December 5, 2004; pg. 68</ref>\n\nGuerrilla marketing is not just exclusive to small companies. For big companies it is a high risk, high reward strategy. When successful it can capture even more market share, but if it fails it can damage the company\u2019s brand image. One successful guerrilla marketing campaign is the Coca-Cola \u2018Happiness Machine\u201d. In January 2010, [[Coca-Cola]], with the help of [[Definition 6]], filmed a reaction video of a Coke vending machine dispensing \u2018doses\u2019 of happiness to unsuspecting students in [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]]. A seemingly normal vending machine surprised students by dispensing items that were more than they bargained for. The students received goodies ranging from extra coke, pizza, flowers, to even a twelve-foot hero sub. \u201cCoke\u2019s goal to inspire consumers through small, surprise moments of happiness\u201d said Paul Iannacchino Jr., Creative Director, Definition 6. With a budget of only $60,000, the video generated 500,000 views in the first week. It now has over 7 million views to date. The campaign was so popular that a 30-second edit of the footage was featured during [[American Idol]]'s season finale.{{Which|date=May 2019}} The Coca-Cola \u201cHappiness Machine\u201d also went on to receive the CLIO's prestigious Gold Interactive Award at the 51st annual awards dinner held in New York City. After the campaign's success, Coca-Cola decided to continue with the \u2018Happiness\u2019 theme and has released similar videos since then.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://adage.com/article/special-report-small-agency-2010/small-agency-campaign-definition-6-s-happiness-machine/145066/|title = Small Agency of the Year, Campaign of the Year: Definition 6's 'Happiness Machine'|website = adage.com|access-date = 2016-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==Strategic risk==\nBecause of the nature of guerrilla marketing, the message and objective must be clearly defined in order to avoid being misunderstood. Misinterpretation by the targeted audience of the message intended to be promoted is a risk. Word-of-mouth advertising does not always stay focused enough to present the intended message. The rumor-like spread of word-of-mouth marketing is uncontrollable once released, and can result in a misrepresentation of the message or confusion about a brand.\n\nAnother risk involves wrongly timed (or wrongly placed) events, which may actually be perceived to be against the interests of the consumer. For instance, in an ill-conceived promotion which took place on [[2007 Boston bomb scare|January 31, 2007]], several magnetic circuit boards\u2014each with an flashing [[LED]] cartoon figure\u2014were attached to metal surfaces in and around [[Boston, Massachusetts]] to promote the animated series, ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]''. The circuit boards were mistakenly taken for [[explosive devices]]. Several subway stations; bridges; and a portion of [[Interstate 93]] were closed as police examined, removed, and (in some cases) destroyed the devices.<ref>[http://articles.cnn.com/2007-01-31/us/boston.bombscare_1_bomb-scares-charlestown-district-court-peter-berdovsky?_s=PM:US ''Boston Bomb Scare''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827205607/http://articles.cnn.com/2007-01-31/us/boston.bombscare_1_bomb-scares-charlestown-district-court-peter-berdovsky?_s=PM:US |date=2012-08-27 }}; article; [[CNN News]] online; retrieved March 2014.</ref>\n\nSome guerrilla marketing may incite the ire of local authorities. Then risks are assessed and may still be considered worthwhile. Such was the case in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], when [[BMW|BMW Auto]]'s ad agency, Street Factory Media, attached a replica of a [[Mini]]-Cooper (made of [[Styrofoam]]), to the side of a downtown building in January 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwblog.com/2013/01/10/houston-issues-ticket-to-a-mini-cooper-parked-on-a-wall/ |title=Houston Issues Ticket To A MINI Cooper Parked On A Wall |website=Bmwblog.com |date= 2013-01-10|accessdate=2017-03-01}}</ref> For the small cost of a city-issued fine, the company received front page advertising in the [[Houston Chronicle]].\n\nAnother problem presents itself if marketers fail to properly execute an undercover campaign. They run considerable risk of backlash. An example of this can be found in [[Sony Entertainment]]'s on-line debacle with Zipatoni. The company attempted to promote Zipatoni through a stealth marketing campaign, which was quickly detected by the internet community, resulting in Sony immediately experiencing a backlash from video game enthusiasts.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/games/archives/2006/12/11/new_sony_viral_marketing_ploy_angers_consumers.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=New Sony viral marketing ploy angers consumers | first=Aleks | last=Krotoski | date=2006-12-11 | accessdate=2010-05-26}}</ref>\n\nStreet art is thus a subversive activity, hijacking public places and inventing rather paradoxical forms of expression that reformulate ways of communicating,<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> all of which inform street marketing practices. Thus marketing in the street, given that it is inspired by the work of such artists, brings with it constraints and statutory risks for which agencies and advertisers are generally not prepared.<ref>Douglas West, John Ford, (2001), Advertising agency philosophies and employee risk taking, Journal of Advertising 30, no. 1: 77\u201391</ref> The main problem is that, by definition, street mobilization campaigns require the use of public space, and that use must be authorized by government authorities to be legal. This is just as true for simple operations like distributing flyers as it is for mobilizing products or people and, of course, for a disguised campaign.<ref>{{cite news|author=Mark Sweney |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/31/dr-dre-beats-olympic-brand-police |title=Dr Dre beats Olympic brand police by sending headphones to Team GB &#124; Media |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2017-03-01}}</ref>\n\nThe authorizations necessary to carry out such a campaign are often very difficult to obtain within the time allotted for bringing the plan to fruition. Numerous potential operations have failed to obtain authorization for safety reasons, and in certain urban areas it is even expressly forbidden to undertake a guerrilla marketing campaign. In such cases, many agencies and advertisers will simply go ahead with the operation, meaning that they choose to act without authorization.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> How is such a choice reached, and on what bases? How is it justified? What impact does this choice have on the performance and costs of the operation? What transformations does this choice bring to the agency\u2013advertiser relationship? These are the main questions posed in the development of street marketing operations today.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n== Inexpensive costs ==\nIn a declining economy, guerrilla marketing is an increasing solution to giving companies the comparative edge over others. During times where companies are downsizing and cutting costs, companies look to guerrilla marketing as a cheaper strategy than conventional marketing. Instead of investing money in the marketing process, guerrillas invest energy, time and creativity.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/206202|title = How to Pull Off a Guerrilla Marketing Campaign|website = Entrepreneur|access-date = 2016-03-31|date = 2010-04-19}}</ref> If done successfully, companies will be able to reach conventional goals for profits and growth with a smaller marketing budget. One such example is the ''[[Blair Witch Project]]''. A group of film students filmed an amateur horror movie. By setting up an internet campaign devoted to spreading rumors about the fictitious 'Blair Witch', it created a lot of interest for the film. With a budget of $50,000, the movie grossed $250 million worldwide.\n\nAccording to Jay Levinson, guerrilla marketing emphasizes strongly on customer follow-up rather than ignoring customers after their purchase. Focusing on customer follow-up is a cheaper strategy because the cost of selling to a new customer is six times higher than selling to an existing customer. During a tough economy, it is important to focus on building relationships rather than sales, and aiming at individuals instead of groups. This promotes repeat sales, referrals and increased size of purchase. The use of telephone as a follow-up tool is helpful in improving customer relationships. Email is also another inexpensive tool for maintaining relationships. Emails can be used to direct people to the company website. The site can be then used to provide information and to advance sales.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/65486|title = Guerrilla Marketing in a Tough Economy|last = Levinson|first = Jay Conrad|website = Entrepreneur|access-date = 2016-03-31|date = 2003-11-17}}</ref>\n\nHonesty is an important attribute when marketing to customers during tough times. When companies show that they are fully aware of the economic situation and why they have priced their products accordingly, this earns the customer's respect. Explaining the current situation and the risks and the steps the company is taking to the customers will give the customers assurance and also maintains their trust. One example is the Las Vegas tourism board. During the [[Great Recession|2008 recession]], Las Vegas was one of the cities hit the hardest. They released an ad campaign showing people they were fully aware of the recession, yet, in a dramatic way, showing 'that regular people are coming here and having a blast'. This piqued a lot of interest which led to an increase of tourism in Las Vegas during the recession.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://abcnews.go.com/Business/Economy/story?id=7586371&page=1|title = Too Far?

Guerrilla marketing focuses on taking the consumer by surprise to make a big impression about the product or brand.<ref>What is Guerrilla Marketing, 2015</ref> This in turn creates [[Marketing buzz|buzz]] about the product being marketed. It is a way of advertising that increases consumers' engagement with the product or service, and is designed to create a memorable experience. By creating a memorable experience, it also increases the likelihood that a consumer, or someone who interacted with the campaign, will tell their friends about the product. Thus, via [[Word-of-mouth marketing|word of mouth]], the product or service being advertised reaches more people than initially anticipated.\n\nGuerrilla marketing is relatively inexpensive, and focuses more on reach rather than frequency.{{cn|reason=the next paragraph contradicts this|date=March 2019}} For guerrilla campaigns to be successful, companies don't need to spend large amounts, they just need to have imagination, energy and time.<ref>Bourn, 2009</ref> Therefore, it has the potential to be effective for small businesses, especially if they are competing against bigger companies.\n\nThe message to consumers is often designed to be clear and concise. This type of marketing also works on the [[unconscious mind]],{{cn|date=March 2019}} as purchasing decisions are often made by the unconscious mind. To keep the product or service in the unconscious mind requires repetition, so if a buzz is created around a product, and it is shared amongst friends, it enables repetition.<ref>Bourn, 2009</ref>\n\n==Etymology and origin==\nThe term \"guerrilla marketing\" is traced to [[guerrilla warfare]], which employs atypical tactics to achieve an objective. In 1984, the term guerrilla marketing was introduced by [[Leo Burnett Worldwide|Leo Burnett]]'s creative director [[Jay Conrad Levinson]] in his book ''Guerrilla Marketing''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The 25 Most Influential Business Management Books|journal=Time|author=Josh Sanburn|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2086680_2086683_2087674,00.html|accessdate=April 12, 2016|date=2011-08-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JLgrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OeYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3455,2835554&dq=guerilla-marketing+levinson&hl=en | newspaper = Lawrence Journal-World | date = March 12, 1989 | accessdate = June 5, 2017 | title = 'Guerrilla marketing' gives small firms the edge | author = Linda S.

It involves high imagination and energy to execute a guerrilla marketing campaign. This kind of marketing is purely focusing on taking the consumer by surprise, creating a greater impression and eventually leading to buzz through word-of-mouth or social media platforms. Guerrilla marketing is perfect for any small or medium size businesses to bring their product or services to its consumers without investing more money on advertisements. This has also been used by large companies to show the difference from its competitors and to make use of [[Social media marketing|social media campaigns]]. Lately, individuals use unconventional methods of job hunting or to work more.<ref>Marcel Bernard Cova & Marcel Saucet, \"The Secret Lives of Unconventional Campaigns: Street Marketing on the Fringe\", Journal of Marketing Communications, 2014</ref> As a result, the concept of street marketing was born. It has evolved from being only the application of activities on the streets, to be the development of innovative practices of promotion.<ref name=\"Jay Conrad Levinson, 1984\">Jay Conrad Levinson, 1984</ref> For example, one method used by many enterprises to promote their products or services on the streets is the distribution of fliers. This activity does not focus on creativity, but on making publicity on the streets. However, with the passage of time, companies have developed more unconventional techniques to catch the attention of the clients.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Types==\n===Ambient marketing===\n{{Main|Ambient awareness}}\nAmbient communication is advertising presented on elements of the environment, including nearly every available physical surface.<ref name=\"Rossella Gambetti\">{{cite web|title=Ambient Communication: How to Engage Consumers in Urban Touch-Points|author=Rossella Gambetti|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259729300|publisher=ResearchGate|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}</ref> It is a compilation of intelligence, flexibility, and effective use of the atmosphere.

For example, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] during the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Olympics]] created 'find your Greatness' spots where they featured athletes from several locations called London (but without showing the real London or referring to the Olympic games) which was intended to build a strong association between London Olympics and Nike.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Nathan Sorrell, Nike's Fat Jogger, Vows to Get Thin|author=Rebecca Cullers|url=http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/nathan-sorrell-nikes-fat-jogger-vows-get-thin-142543|magazine=AdWeek|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Stealth marketing===\n{{Main|Stealth marketing}}\n[[Stealth marketing]] is a deliberate act of entering, operating in, or exiting a market in a furtive, secretive or imperceptible manner, or an attempt to do so.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Keeping up with The Joneses: Stealth, secrets, and duplicity in marketing relationships|author1=Ekin Pehlivana |author2=Pierre Berthonb |author3=Mine \u00dc\u00e7ok Hughesc |author4=Jean-Paul Berthond |doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2015.06.002 |volume=58 |issue=6 |journal=Business Horizons |pages=591\u2013598|year=2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Viral/buzz marketing===\n{{Main|Viral marketing}}\n[[Viral marketing]] describes any strategy that encourages individuals to pass on a marketing message to others, creating the potential for exponential growth in the message's exposure and influence. Like viruses, such strategies take advantage of rapid multiplication to explode the message to thousands, to millions. Off the Internet, viral marketing has been referred to as \"word-of-mouth\", \"creating a buzz\", \"leveraging the media\", \"network marketing\", But on the Internet, for better or worse, it's called \"viral marketing\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webmarketingtoday.com/articles/viral-principles/ |title=Practical Ecommerce &#124; Insights for Online Merchants |website=Webmarketingtoday.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-01}}</ref>\n\n{{Main|Buzz marketing}}\n\nSimilarly, [[marketing buzz|buzz marketing]] uses high-profile media to encourage the public to discuss the brand or product.<ref name=\"Solomon, M. 2008\"/> Buzz marketing works best when consumer's responses to a product or service and subsequent endorsements are genuine, without the company paying them. Buzz generated from buzz marketing campaigns is referred to as \"amplified WOM\" (word-of-mouth), and \"organic WOM\" is when buzz occurs naturally by the consumer.<ref name=\"Solomon, M. 2008\"/>\n\n===Grassroots marketing===\n{{Main|Grassroots}}\n[[Grassroots|Grassroots campaigns]] aim to win customers over on an individual basis. A successful grassroots campaign is not about the dissemination of the marketing message in the hope that possible consumers are paying attention, but rather highlights a personal connection between the consumer and the brand and builds a lasting relationship with the brand.<ref>Baker, M. & Hart, S. (2008). The Marketing Book. (6th ed.). Oxford, England: Butterworth-Heinemann.</ref>\n\n===Astroturfing===\n{{Main|Astroturfing}}\n[[Astroturfing]] is among the most controversial guerrilla marketing strategies, and has a high risk factor for the company marketing the product or service.<ref name=\"Jacobs, J. 2012\">Jacobs, J. (2012). Faking it \u2013 how to kill a business through astroturfing on social media.

Hence, fake endorsements, testimonials and recommendations are all products of Astroturfing in the public relations sector.<ref name=\"Jacobs, J. 2012\"/> Astroturfing involves generating an artificial hype around a particular product or company through a review or discussion on online blogs or forums by an individual who is paid to convey a positive view. This can have a negative and detrimental effect on a company, should the consumer suspect that the review or opinion is not authentic, damaging the company's reputation or even worse, resulting in litigation.<ref name=\"Jacobs, J. 2012\"/>\n\n===Street marketing===\n{{Main|Street marketing}}\n{{See|Tissue-pack marketing}}\n[[Street marketing]] uses unconventional means of advertising or promoting products and brands in public areas. The main goal is to encourage consumers to remember and recall the brand or product marketed. As a division of guerrilla marketing, street marketing is specific to all marketing activities carried out in streets and public areas such as parks, streets, events etc. Street marketing also encompasses advertising outdoors, such as on [[Shopping cart|shopping trolleys]] (shopping carts, in the US), public toilets, sides of cars or public transport, manhole covers, footpaths, rubbish bins, etc.<ref>Berman M. (c2007). Street-Smart Advertising: How to Win the Battle of the Buzz. Plymouth, United Kingdom: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.</ref>\n\nStreet marketing isn't confined to fixed advertisements. It is common practice for organisations to use brand ambassadors who distribute product samples or discount vouchers, and answer queries about the product while emphasizing the brand. The brand ambassadors may be accompanied by a kiosk which contains the product samples or demonstration materials, or they may be wearing a \"walking billboard\". The physical interaction with consumers has a greater influencing power than traditional passive advertising.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketing-schools.org/types-of-marketing/street-marketing.html |title=Street Marketing &#124; What is Street Marketing? |website=Marketing-schools.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-01}}</ref>\n\nStreet marketing is understood as mobilizing not only the space of the streets but also the imagination of the street: that of street culture and street art.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">{{cite journal | last1 = Borghini | first1 = Stefania | last2 = Visconti | first2 = Luca M. | last3 = Anderson | first3 = Laurel | last4 = Sherry Jr | first4 = John F. | year = 2010 | title = Symbiotic postures of commercial advertising and street art: Implications for creativity | url = | journal = Journal of Advertising | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 115\u201328 | doi=10.2753/joa0091-3367390308}}</ref> The [[Y-generation]] broadly consisting of young urbanites (15 \u2013 30 years old), is often put forth as the most susceptible target for the campaigns due to its associations with the culture of the street.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Black | last2 = Neville | year = 2009 | title = Fly-Posting: An Exploration of a 'Controversial' Medium | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing Communications | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 209\u2013226 | doi=10.1080/13527260802091022}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Marcel Saucet and Bernard Cova,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Bernard Cova & Marcel Saucet, \"The Secret Lives of Unconventional Campaigns: Street Marketing on the Fringe\", Journal of Marketing Communications, 2014</ref> street marketing can be used as a general term encompassing six principal types of activities:\n* '''Distribution of flyers or products'''\nThis activity is more traditional and is the most common form of street marketing employed by brands.\n* '''Product animations'''\nThis consists of personalizing a high-traffic space using brand imagery. The idea is to create a micro-universe in order to promote a new product or service.\n* '''Human animations'''\nThe goal of such actions is to create a space in which the brand's message is communicated through human activity.\n* '''Road shows'''\nThis form of mobile presentation is based on the development of means of transport: Taxi, bike, Segway, etc.\n* '''Uncovered actions'''\nThese activities involve the customization of street elements.\n* '''Event actions'''\nThese activities take the form of spectacles, such as [[flash mob]]s or contests. The idea is to promote a product, service or brand value through organization of a public event.\n\n==Typical procedure==\nFirst, enterprises identify the public places where the campaign can be developed such as beaches, cultural events, close to schools, sporting events and recreation areas for children.<ref>Marcel Saucet & Bernard Cova, 2014</ref> Next, companies have to develop a plan to get close to different media and the target market.<ref name=\"Rossella Gambetti\"/> In order to attract attention, street marketing events not only involve unusual activities, but use technology as part of the events. The purpose is to increase the value of the campaigns and get potential consumers' attention.<ref>{{cite journal|ssrn=2411026 |title=The Secret Lives of Unconventional Campaigns: Street Marketing on the Fringe by Bernard Cova, Marcel Saucet :: SSRN |url=http://Papers.ssrn.com |date= 2014-03-18|accessdate=2017-03-01|last1=Saucet |first1=Marcel |last2=Cova |first2=Bernard }}</ref>\n\nBesides, the plans that companies develop take into account that guerrilla or street marketing involves global communication and interaction not only with the customers or the media.<ref name=\"Goldberg\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=48201%20|title=Taryn Rose Launches Dresr: Street Marketing a Luxury Brand - Case - Harvard Business School|last=Goldberg|first=Lena G.|date=2014-11-06|website=Hbs.edu|accessdate=2017-03-01}}</ref> They are also developed to identify opportunities and collect enough information about products, markets and competitors. For example, for business it is important that customers stay with them, instead of choosing the competitors\u2019 offers. They implement innovative strategies with which they will not lose position in the market, and they consider supplementation with other advertisement through other mediums, such as radio and television, when using street marketing.<ref>Jay Conrad Levinson, 1984;Marcel Saucet & Bernard Cova, 2014</ref>{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThere are various examples of strategies that are used in guerrilla marketing. One of them is to provide offers to increase sales. In many cases, businesses do not only supply their products or services to be recognized, but they also offer other things for free. Another instance is to present a fundraiser offer. The point of this strategy is to help other organizations, such as schools, by offering them money. Most companies implement this method not only to increase their sales, but to improve their reputation and image among the community. Finally, there is a strategy called \"team selling\" that consists of conforming groups of people, the majority of them young, who go knocking the doors of different houses in a neighborhood. They do this in order to help companies promoting and selling their products or services.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nWhen doing guerrilla marketing or street marketing, organizations also consider focusing on the psychological approach. For many companies, this implies if they are having success or not. Street marketing focuses on some psychological aspects to know customers' behavior and preferences. For example, certain psychological areas study how people's brains are divided: 45% of people are left-brained, 45% are right brained, and 10% are balanced. Left-brained persons tend to be logical, right-brained ones tend to be emotional, and the rest combine the two. Then, according to the product or service that enterprises provide, and also the kind of customer, businesses decides the way they are going to manage their street marketing campaigns. Besides, almost all the enterprises base their street marketing campaigns on repeating the messages they spread among their customers. Repetition is related to the unconscious part of the mind. This is the one in charge of making decisions. It lets people know what they are going to choose, as well as what they are going to buy. Businesses follow the principle that establishes that, the more people paying attention to the campaign, the more possibilities that campaign has for being remembered.\n\nWhen a company decides to do a guerrilla marketing campaign which could be anything out of viral, ambient, ambush, street or stealth, the focus for them is to meet the objectives. The main objectives for them are:\n* To create enough buzz to serve in word-of-mouth, helping the brand to establish well with its products.\n* To touch most of the five sensory identities of the customer/consumer enhancing personal experience with the brand and building good reputation.\n* To reach the target successfully by taking the brand to them in their daily routine.\nThrough the experience and the ephemeral feelings shared between the company and the target, advertisers and agencies generate a feeling of intimacy that resonates beyond the encounter. This feeling of nearness becomes all the more lasting as the affected individuals relive this encounter on the internet through social media.<ref>Bernard Cova and Marcel Saucet, Unconventional Marketing: from Guerrilla to Consumer Made,\" in Routledge Companion on The Future of Marketing, Routledge, September 2013.</ref>\n\n==Strategy==\nThe guerrilla marketing promotion strategy was first identified by [[Jay Conrad Levinson]] in his book ''Guerrilla Marketing'' (1984).The book describes hundreds of \"guerrilla marketing weapons\" in use at the time. Guerrilla marketers need to be creative in devising unconventional methods of promotion to maintain the public's interest in a product or service. Levinson writes that when implementing guerrilla marketing tactics, smaller organizations and [[entrepreneurs]] are actually at an advantage. Ultimately, however, guerrilla marketers must \"deliver the goods.\" In ''The Guerrilla Marketing Handbook'', the authors write: \"...in order to sell a product or a service, a company must establish a relationship with the customer. It must build trust and support the customer's needs, and it must provide a product that delivers the promised benefits...\"<ref name=\"handbook\">''The Guerrilla Marketing Handbook''; Levinson, Jay Conrad; Godin, Seth; Mariner Books; November 1994; {{ISBN|0395700132}}; accessed March 2014.</ref>\n\n==Online guerilla marketing==\nThe web is rife with examples of guerrilla marketing, to the extent that many of us don't notice its presence - until a particularly successful campaign arises. The desire for instant gratification of internet users provides an avenue for guerrilla marketing by allowing businesses to combine wait marketing with guerrilla tactics. Simple examples consist of using 'loading' pages or image alt texts to display an entertaining or informative message to users waiting to access the content they were trying to get to. As users dislike waiting with no occupation on the web, it is essential, and easy, to capture their attention this way. Other website methods include interesting web features such as engaging landing pages.\n\nMany online marketing strategies also use social media such as [[Facebook]] and [[LinkedIn]] to begin campaigns, share-able features and event host events. Other companies run competitions or discounts based on encouraging users to share or create content related to their product. Viral videos are an incredibly popular form of guerrilla marketing in which companies film entertaining or surprising videos that internet users are likely to share and enjoy, that subtly advertise their service or product. Some companies such as [[Google]] even create interactive elements like the themed Google logo games to spark interest and engagement. These dynamic guerrilla marketing tactics can become news globally and give businesses considerable publicity.\n\n==Examples==\nThere are various organizations who have implemented the guerrilla and street marketing strategies. The majority of them are small companies, but there are also big companies that have involved in the guerrilla and street marketing environment.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Bernard Cova and Marcel Saucet, Unconventional Marketing: from Guerrilla to Consumer Made,\" in Routledge Companion on The Future of Marketing, Routledge, September 2013</ref> Most of the examples of the strategies that both small and big enterprises have put into action include costumed persons, the distribution of tickets, people providing samples, among others.\nAs stated before, one guerrilla marketing conventional method that is used by many businesses is to provide fliers. The goal is to create awareness on the customers about what the enterprise is doing. One example of this took place in [[Montpelier, Vermont]], where the [[New England Culinary Institute]] (NECI) sent a group of students to a movie theatre to hand out 400 fliers. Those fliers had coupons in which NECI was inviting people to go to its monthly Theme Dinners. Another company, Boston's Kung-Fu Tai Chi Club, chose the option of disseminating fliers instead of placing its advertisements on the newspapers. The purpose of the fliers was to promote the company's self-defence classes for women.\n\nOther businesses apply the technique of sending disguised people to promote things on the streets. For example, [[match.com]] organized a street marketing activity in the \u201cFeria del Libro\u201d (\u201cBook Fair\u201d) in Madrid. It consisted of a man dressed like a prince who was walking among the crowd looking for his \u201creal love\u201d. He had a glass slipper and even got to try the shoe on some people. A woman behind him was giving bookmarks to the people which contained messages such as \u201cTimes have changed; the way to find love, too\u201d or \u201cYou have been reading love stories all your life; experience yours on Match.com\u201d. Also, in Madrid and Barcelona, Nokia developed a campaign called \u201cAvestruz\u201d (\u201cOstrich\u201d) to promote the 5500 and 5700 mobiles. In the campaign, a group of real-size ostrich puppets tried to interact with young people in order to let them know these mobiles provide a high-quality MP3 playback. The puppets were holding their own telephones and listening to the music. When a young person appeared, the puppet tried to catch his/her attention to show him/her the quality of the mobile. The reason why Nokia decided to use ostriches was that they are big animals, so people could easily look at them.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThere are enterprises that disseminate passes or tickets to different events. For example, Sony invests on joining promoters and tells them that they have to infiltrate in public meetings. What they have to do is to distribute free tickets to concerts and other musical events sponsored by the company . Another instance is the Spanish company Clickair (an extension of Iberia airlines), that developed a campaign in which a group of five people had to walk through Barcelona streets dressed as Euros. The group was supplying approximately 3,000 tickets to promote different Clickair destinations. The people who first sent a text message with the required information would get free tickets to go on a trip. In the end, the company received a total of 3,390 messages.\nAlong with these examples, there are other street marketing techniques that are even more unusual. Lee Jeans, a French company dedicated to the selling of jeans, promoted the opening of their new store in rue des Rosiers in Paris. The method they applied consisted of distributing denims, as well as denim accessories, on the different streets of the neighborhood. Furthermore, in Italy, the members of the company Nintendo put into action a campaign in which they used post-it's to promote the Wii console. They pasted several post-it with the shapes of some characters from different video games. Those images were placed as if they were billboards on the streets. \u201cWii not forget\u201d, the name of the campaign, and a brief explanation of it, were the words written on the post-its.\nIn some cases, some street marketing may incite the ire of local authorities; such was the case in Houston, Texas, when BMW's ad agency (Street Factory Media in Minneapolis)attached a replication, made from Styrofoam, of a Mini-Cooper to the side of a downtown building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.actu-cci.com/videos/293-street-marketing-by-marcel-saucet |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502075919/http://en.actu-cci.com/videos/293-street-marketing-by-marcel-saucet |archivedate=2014-05-02 }}</ref> For the cost of a small city-issued fine, the company received front page advertising on the Houston Chronicle.\n\n[[Sony Ericsson]] used an undercover campaign in 2002 when they hired 60 actors in ten major cities and had them accost strangers and ask them: \"Would you mind taking my picture?\" The actor then handed the target a brand new picture phone while talking about how cool the new device was. \"And thus an act of civility was converted into a branding event.<ref>''The Hidden (In Plain Sight) Persuaders''; Walker, Rob;  \"[[The New York Times Magazine]];\" December 5, 2004; pg. 68</ref>\n\nGuerrilla marketing is not just exclusive to small companies. For big companies it is a high risk, high reward strategy. When successful it can capture even more market share, but if it fails it can damage the company\u2019s brand image. One successful guerrilla marketing campaign is the Coca-Cola \u2018Happiness Machine\u201d. In January 2010, [[Coca-Cola]], with the help of [[Definition 6]], filmed a reaction video of a Coke vending machine dispensing \u2018doses\u2019 of happiness to unsuspecting students in [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]]. A seemingly normal vending machine surprised students by dispensing items that were more than they bargained for. The students received goodies ranging from extra coke, pizza, flowers, to even a twelve-foot hero sub. \u201cCoke\u2019s goal to inspire consumers through small, surprise moments of happiness\u201d said Paul Iannacchino Jr., Creative Director, Definition 6. With a budget of only $60,000, the video generated 500,000 views in the first week. It now has over 7 million views to date. The campaign was so popular that a 30-second edit of the footage was featured during [[American Idol]]'s season finale.{{Which|date=May 2019}} The Coca-Cola \u201cHappiness Machine\u201d also went on to receive the CLIO's prestigious Gold Interactive Award at the 51st annual awards dinner held in New York City. After the campaign's success, Coca-Cola decided to continue with the \u2018Happiness\u2019 theme and has released similar videos since then.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://adage.com/article/special-report-small-agency-2010/small-agency-campaign-definition-6-s-happiness-machine/145066/|title = Small Agency of the Year, Campaign of the Year: Definition 6's 'Happiness Machine'|website = adage.com|access-date = 2016-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==Strategic risk==\nBecause of the nature of guerrilla marketing, the message and objective must be clearly defined in order to avoid being misunderstood. Misinterpretation by the targeted audience of the message intended to be promoted is a risk. Word-of-mouth advertising does not always stay focused enough to present the intended message. The rumor-like spread of word-of-mouth marketing is uncontrollable once released, and can result in a misrepresentation of the message or confusion about a brand.\n\nAnother risk involves wrongly timed (or wrongly placed) events, which may actually be perceived to be against the interests of the consumer. For instance, in an ill-conceived promotion which took place on [[2007 Boston bomb scare|January 31, 2007]], several magnetic circuit boards\u2014each with an flashing [[LED]] cartoon figure\u2014were attached to metal surfaces in and around [[Boston, Massachusetts]] to promote the animated series, ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]''. The circuit boards were mistakenly taken for [[explosive devices]]. Several subway stations; bridges; and a portion of [[Interstate 93]] were closed as police examined, removed, and (in some cases) destroyed the devices.<ref>[http://articles.cnn.com/2007-01-31/us/boston.bombscare_1_bomb-scares-charlestown-district-court-peter-berdovsky?_s=PM:US ''Boston Bomb Scare''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827205607/http://articles.cnn.com/2007-01-31/us/boston.bombscare_1_bomb-scares-charlestown-district-court-peter-berdovsky?_s=PM:US |date=2012-08-27 }}; article; [[CNN News]] online; retrieved March 2014.</ref>\n\nSome guerrilla marketing may incite the ire of local authorities. Then risks are assessed and may still be considered worthwhile. Such was the case in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], when [[BMW|BMW Auto]]'s ad agency, Street Factory Media, attached a replica of a [[Mini]]-Cooper (made of [[Styrofoam]]), to the side of a downtown building in January 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwblog.com/2013/01/10/houston-issues-ticket-to-a-mini-cooper-parked-on-a-wall/ |title=Houston Issues Ticket To A MINI Cooper Parked On A Wall |website=Bmwblog.com |date= 2013-01-10|accessdate=2017-03-01}}</ref> For the small cost of a city-issued fine, the company received front page advertising in the [[Houston Chronicle]].\n\nAnother problem presents itself if marketers fail to properly execute an undercover campaign. They run considerable risk of backlash. An example of this can be found in [[Sony Entertainment]]'s on-line debacle with Zipatoni. The company attempted to promote Zipatoni through a stealth marketing campaign, which was quickly detected by the internet community, resulting in Sony immediately experiencing a backlash from video game enthusiasts.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/games/archives/2006/12/11/new_sony_viral_marketing_ploy_angers_consumers.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=New Sony viral marketing ploy angers consumers | first=Aleks | last=Krotoski | date=2006-12-11 | accessdate=2010-05-26}}</ref>\n\nStreet art is thus a subversive activity, hijacking public places and inventing rather paradoxical forms of expression that reformulate ways of communicating,<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> all of which inform street marketing practices. Thus marketing in the street, given that it is inspired by the work of such artists, brings with it constraints and statutory risks for which agencies and advertisers are generally not prepared.<ref>Douglas West, John Ford, (2001), Advertising agency philosophies and employee risk taking, Journal of Advertising 30, no. 1: 77\u201391</ref> The main problem is that, by definition, street mobilization campaigns require the use of public space, and that use must be authorized by government authorities to be legal. This is just as true for simple operations like distributing flyers as it is for mobilizing products or people and, of course, for a disguised campaign.<ref>{{cite news|author=Mark Sweney |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/31/dr-dre-beats-olympic-brand-police |title=Dr Dre beats Olympic brand police by sending headphones to Team GB &#124; Media |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2017-03-01}}</ref>\n\nThe authorizations necessary to carry out such a campaign are often very difficult to obtain within the time allotted for bringing the plan to fruition. Numerous potential operations have failed to obtain authorization for safety reasons, and in certain urban areas it is even expressly forbidden to undertake a guerrilla marketing campaign. In such cases, many agencies and advertisers will simply go ahead with the operation, meaning that they choose to act without authorization.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> How is such a choice reached, and on what bases? How is it justified? What impact does this choice have on the performance and costs of the operation? What transformations does this choice bring to the agency\u2013advertiser relationship? These are the main questions posed in the development of street marketing operations today.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n== Inexpensive costs ==\nIn a declining economy, guerrilla marketing is an increasing solution to giving companies the comparative edge over others. During times where companies are downsizing and cutting costs, companies look to guerrilla marketing as a cheaper strategy than conventional marketing. Instead of investing money in the marketing process, guerrillas invest energy, time and creativity.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/206202|title = How to Pull Off a Guerrilla Marketing Campaign|website = Entrepreneur|access-date = 2016-03-31|date = 2010-04-19}}</ref> If done successfully, companies will be able to reach conventional goals for profits and growth with a smaller marketing budget. One such example is the ''[[Blair Witch Project]]''. A group of film students filmed an amateur horror movie. By setting up an internet campaign devoted to spreading rumors about the fictitious 'Blair Witch', it created a lot of interest for the film. With a budget of $50,000, the movie grossed $250 million worldwide.\n\nAccording to Jay Levinson, guerrilla marketing emphasizes strongly on customer follow-up rather than ignoring customers after their purchase. Focusing on customer follow-up is a cheaper strategy because the cost of selling to a new customer is six times higher than selling to an existing customer. During a tough economy, it is important to focus on building relationships rather than sales, and aiming at individuals instead of groups. This promotes repeat sales, referrals and increased size of purchase. The use of telephone as a follow-up tool is helpful in improving customer relationships. Email is also another inexpensive tool for maintaining relationships. Emails can be used to direct people to the company website. The site can be then used to provide information and to advance sales.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/65486|title = Guerrilla Marketing in a Tough Economy|last = Levinson|first = Jay Conrad|website = Entrepreneur|access-date = 2016-03-31|date = 2003-11-17}}</ref>\n\nHonesty is an important attribute when marketing to customers during tough times. When companies show that they are fully aware of the economic situation and why they have priced their products accordingly, this earns the customer's respect. Explaining the current situation and the risks and the steps the company is taking to the customers will give the customers assurance and also maintains their trust. One example is the Las Vegas tourism board. During the [[Great Recession|2008 recession]], Las Vegas was one of the cities hit the hardest. They released an ad campaign showing people they were fully aware of the recession, yet, in a dramatic way, showing 'that regular people are coming here and having a blast'. This piqued a lot of interest which led to an increase of tourism in Las Vegas during the recession.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://abcnews.go.com/Business/Economy/story?id=7586371&page=1|title = Too Far?

French Communist Party member and public intellectual [[Louis Althusser]] popularized his structuralist influenced interpretation of false consciousness, [[Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses|The Ideological State Apparatus]].
