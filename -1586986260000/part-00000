The \"alternative\" comedy scene also began to evolve. Some of the earliest successes came from [[folk club]]s, where performers such as [[Billy Connolly]], [[Mike Harding]] and [[Jasper Carrott]] started as relatively straight musical acts whose between-song banter developed into complete comedy routines. The 1960s had also seen the satire boom, including the creation of the club, [[The Establishment (club)|the Establishment]], which, amongst other things, gave British audiences their first taste of extreme American stand-up comedy from [[Lenny Bruce]].<ref>\"So Farewell Then: The Untold Life of Peter Cook\" Cook, Wendy E. {{ISBN|0-00-722893-7}}, p. 139-144</ref> [[Victoria Wood]] launched her stand-up career in the early 1980s, which included observational conversation mixed with comedy songs.

In 1983, young drama teacher Maria Kempinska created [[Jongleurs]] Comedy Clubs, now the largest stand-up comedy chain in Europe.

The first generalized relationship with this comic genre occurred in 1999 with the creation of the [[Comedy Central Spain|Paramount Comedy]] channel, which included the ''New Comics'' program as one of its flagship programs, where monologuists such as [[\u00c1ngel Mart\u00edn]], Jos\u00e9 Juan Vaquero, [[David Broncano]], and [[Joaqu\u00edn Reyes (actor)|Joaqu\u00edn Reyes]] stood out.\nAlso, in 1999 began the journey of the program [[The club of comedy]], an open adaptation of the popular comic format. In its first stage (1999-2005), it underwent several chain changes and released comedians like [[Luis Piedrahita]], [[Alexis Valdes]] or [[:es:Goyo Jim\u00e9nez|Goyo Jim\u00e9nez]].

The presenter, [[Andreu Buenafuente]], made an initial monologue of about 9 to 11 minutes where he links current issues with everyday humorous situations.

Jokes were generally broad and material was widely shared, or in some cases, stolen. Industrialized American audiences sought entertainment as a way to escape and confront city living.\n\nThe founders of modern American stand-up comedy include [[Moms Mabley]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Bob Hope]], [[George Burns]], [[Fred Allen]], [[Milton Berle]] and [[Frank Fay (American actor)|Frank Fay]], all of whom came from vaudeville or the [[Chitlin' Circuit]].<ref>\"'Whoopi Goldberg Presents Moms Mabley'\" ZAP 2 IT: http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/11/whoopi-goldberg-presents-moms-mabley-eddie-murphy-bill-cosby-and-arsenio-hall-all-owe-a-debt.html</ref> They spoke directly to the audience as themselves, in front of the curtain, known as performing \"in one\".

Acts such as [[Alan King (comedian)|Alan King]], [[Danny Thomas]], [[Martin and Lewis]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Joan Rivers]] and [[Jack E.

Some [[African American|Black American]] comedians such as [[Redd Foxx]], [[George Kirby]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Dick Gregory]] began to cross over to white audiences during this time.\n\nIn the 1970s, several entertainers became major stars based on stand-up comedy performances. [[Richard Pryor]] and George Carlin followed Lenny Bruce's acerbic style to become icons. Stand-up expanded from clubs, resorts, and coffee houses into major concerts in sports arenas and amphitheaters. [[Steve Martin]] and Bill Cosby had levels of success with gentler comic routines. The older style of stand-up comedy (no social satire) was kept alive by [[Rodney Dangerfield]] and [[Buddy Hackett]], who enjoyed revived careers late in life. [[Don Rickles]], whose legendary style of relentless merciless attacks on both fellow performers and audience members alike kept him a fixture on TV and in Vegas from the 1960s all the way to the 2000s, when he appeared in the wildly popular [[Pixar]] ''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]'' films as [[Mr Potato Head]], who just happened to share Don's grouchy onstage mannerisms. Television programs such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' helped publicize the careers of other stand-up comedians, including [[Janeane Garofalo]], [[Bill Maher]] and [[Jay Leno]].\n\nFrom the 1970s to the '90s, different styles of comedy began to emerge, from the madcap stylings of [[Robin Williams]], to the odd observations of [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and [[Ellen DeGeneres]], the ironic musings of [[Steven Wright]], to the mimicry of [[Whoopi Goldberg]], and [[Eddie Murphy]]. These comedians would serve to influence the next generation of comedians.\n\n===Mexico===\n\nIn terms of [[:es:Comedia en vivo#M\u00e9xico|live comedy in Mexico]], the predecessors of this comic style are:\n* [[:es:Los Tepichines|The Tepichines]] are a comic duo who were predecessors of a style consisting of parodies and double senses with creativity\n* [[Miguel Galv\u00e1n]] (1957-2008) Originally from Juan Aldama, Zacatecas.

Later they created the first collective of comedy in Monterrey called For Laughter Standup Comedy. Luiki Wiki has participated in programs such as Es de Noche and I already arrived with Ren\u00e9 Franco and as with [[Adal Ramones]] in the 3rd season of the STANDparados program aired by Comedy District.\n* [[:es:Franco Escamilla|Franco Escamilla]] (1981-) Comedian, musician, radio announcer and founder of \"La Diablo Squad\".

Taking a step closer to the North American format, Chico Anysio and J\u00f4 Soares maintained the format - specially in their live nation-wide talks shows, and generally, in the opening monologues - bringing to Brazil a genre more similar to what we currently know as Stand-up.\n\nStand-up began to be interesting news in 2005 in ''S\u00e3o Paulo'', when the first club was created, called ''Clube de Com\u00e9dia Stand-Up:'' composed of Marcelo Mansfield, Rafinha Bastos, Oscar Filho, Marcela Leal and M\u00e1rcio Ribeiro. In S\u00e3o Paulo the comedy club would present in Beverly Hills, the traditional comedy venue in Moema. Shortly afterwards it migrated to Mr. Blues and Bleeker Street, in ''Vila Madalena''. In ''Rio de Janeiro'', ''Com\u00e9dia em P\u00e9, (''Comedy Standing Up): composed of Cl\u00e1udio Torres Gonzaga, F\u00e1bio Porch\u00e1t, Fernando Caruso and Paulo Carvalho, had its debue at the venue ''Rio Design Leblon''. These were the first stand-up performances in the country.\n\nIn 2006, the comic J\u00f4 Soares watched ''Clube de Com\u00e9dia'' in S\u00e3o Paulo and invited the comic Diogo Portugal for an interview in his talk show. That was a definitive moment to call attention towards the genre. He mentioned many different shows that he was a part of and attracted the public attention and media coverage to the bars that held these presentations. In Curitiba, with this momentum, many other stand-up nights began opening up. In S\u00e3o Paulo, Danilo Gentili, that had just become a part of ''Clube da Com\u00e9dia,'' invited M\u00e1rio Ribeiro and gathered other young comics that were frequent spectators at the club, to create ''Com\u00e9dia Ao Vivo'' (Live Comedy): composed of Dani Calabresa, Luiz Fran\u00e7a, F\u00e1bio Rabin.\n\nWith the show CQC - ''Custe o Que Custar'', on the channel Band, a nation-wide tv outlet, in 2008, the genre took gained its permanent spot on the national stage. With bug names like Danilo Gentili, Rafinha Bastos and Oscar Filho, the curiosity grew exponentially. \n\nFollowing CQC's example many channels and tv shows on Brazil's national television invested in Stand-up comedy. After this many other groups gained recognition in the clubs and live performances around the two biggest cities of Brazil.\n\n== History of stand-up in Asia ==\n===India===\n[[File:Kapil sharma.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Kapil Sharma (comedian)|Kapil Sharma]] an Indian stand up comedian, known for comedy nights with Kapil]]\nModern stand-up comedy in India is a young art form, however [[Chakyar koothu]] was prominent in [[Trivandrum]] and southern [[Kerala]] during the 16th and 17th centuries.

At the same time, a few more youngsters got inspired and started taking plunge into stand-up comedy.\n\nSince 2011, the stand-up comedy has been getting substantial appreciation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} The Comedy Store from London opened an outlet in Mumbai's Palladium Mall where people would regularly enjoy comedians from UK. The Comedy Story also supported local comedians and helped them grow. This outlet eventually become Canvas Laugh Club in Mumbai.\n\nAround 2011, people started organizing different comedy open mic events in Mumbai, Delhi (and Gurgaon), Bangalore. All of this happened in association with growth of a counterculture in Indian cities which catered to the appetite of younger generations for live events for comedy, poetry, storytelling, and music. Various stand up events were covered by popular news channels such NDTV / Aajtak etc. and were appreciated by millions of viewers.\n\nAs a result of these developments, plus the increasing penetration of [[YouTube]] (along with [[Internet]]/[[World Wide Web]]), Indian stand up comedy started reaching further masses.

They often opened their programs with topical monologues, characterized by [[ad-lib]]s and discussions about anything from the latest films to a missed birthday. Each program tended to be divided into the opening monologue, musical number, followed by a [[sketch comedy|skit]] or story routine. A \"feud\" between [[Fred Allen]] and [[Jack Benny]] was used as comic material for nearly a decade.\n\n[[Home Box Office|HBO]] presented comedians uncensored for the first time, beginning with [[Robert Klein]] in 1975, and was instrumental in reaching larger audiences. George Carlin was a perennial favorite, who appeared in 14 HBO comedy specials.\n\nContinuing that tradition, most modern stand-up comedians use television or motion pictures to reach a level of success and recognition unattainable in the comedy-club circuit alone.\n\nLate-night talk shows and award show ceremonies are commonly hosted by comedians, delivering monologues similar to stand-up.\n\nSince the mid-2000s, online video-sharing sites such as [[YouTube]] have also provided a venue for stand-up comedians, and many comedians' performances can be viewed online.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailybits.com/watch-stand-up-comedians-on-youtube/|title=Watch Stand Up Comedians on YouTube|accessdate=2008-09-27 |work= Daniel Scocco |publisher=Dailybits.com |date=2008-09-23}}</ref>\n\nAn Amazon TV show, ''[[The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel]]'', depicts the fictional life of a woman comedian, set in the late 1950s.

Industrialized American audiences sought entertainment as a way to escape and confront city living.\n\nThe founders of modern American stand-up comedy include [[Moms Mabley]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Bob Hope]], [[George Burns]], [[Fred Allen]], [[Milton Berle]] and [[Frank Fay (American actor)|Frank Fay]], all of whom came from vaudeville or the [[Chitlin' Circuit]].<ref>\"'Whoopi Goldberg Presents Moms Mabley'\" ZAP 2 IT: http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/11/whoopi-goldberg-presents-moms-mabley-eddie-murphy-bill-cosby-and-arsenio-hall-all-owe-a-debt.html</ref> They spoke directly to the audience as themselves, in front of the curtain, known as performing \"in one\". Frank Fay gained acclaim as a \"[[master of ceremonies]]\" at New York's [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|Palace Theater]]. Vaudevillian [[Charlie Case|Charlie Case (also spelled Charley Case)]] is often credited with the first form of stand-up comedy, performing humorous monologues without props or costumes. This had not been done before during a vaudeville show.\n\nNightclubs and resorts became the new breeding ground for stand-ups. Acts such as [[Alan King (comedian)|Alan King]], [[Danny Thomas]], [[Martin and Lewis]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Joan Rivers]] and [[Jack E. Leonard]] flourished in these venues.\n\nIn the 1950s and into the 1960s, stand-ups such as [[Mort Sahl]] began developing their acts in small folk clubs like San Francisco's [[hungry i]] (owned by impresario [[Enrico Banducci]] and origin of the ubiquitous \"brick wall\" behind comedians)<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/16/local/me-banducci16|title=Enrico Banducci, 85; owned hungry i nightclub|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|date=2007-10-16|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-05-23}}</ref> or New York's [[The Bitter End|Bitter End]]. These comedians added an element of social satire and expanded both the language and boundaries of stand-up, venturing into politics, [[race relations]], and [[off-color humor|sexual humor]]. [[Lenny Bruce]] became known as 'the' obscene comic when he used language that usually led to his arrest.<ref>''Make Em Laugh: The Funny Business of America'' Maslon, Laurence E. {{ISBN|978-0-446-50531-4}}, p.340 \u2013 p.341</ref> After Lenny Bruce, arrests for obscene language on stage nearly disappeared until [[George Carlin]] was arrested on 21 July 1972 at [[Milwaukee]]'s [[Summerfest]] after performing the routine \"[[Seven dirty words|Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television]]\"<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=626471\n|title=Carlin's naughty words still ring in officer's ears\n|author=Jim Stingl\n|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]\n|date=June 30, 2007\n|accessdate=2008-03-23\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929124942/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=626471 |archivedate = September 29, 2007}}</ref> (the case against Carlin was eventually dismissed).\n\nOther notable comics from this era include [[Woody Allen]], [[Shelley Berman]], [[Phyllis Diller]], and [[Bob Newhart]]. Some [[African American|Black American]] comedians such as [[Redd Foxx]], [[George Kirby]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Dick Gregory]] began to cross over to white audiences during this time.\n\nIn the 1970s, several entertainers became major stars based on stand-up comedy performances. [[Richard Pryor]] and George Carlin followed Lenny Bruce's acerbic style to become icons. Stand-up expanded from clubs, resorts, and coffee houses into major concerts in sports arenas and amphitheaters. [[Steve Martin]] and Bill Cosby had levels of success with gentler comic routines. The older style of stand-up comedy (no social satire) was kept alive by [[Rodney Dangerfield]] and [[Buddy Hackett]], who enjoyed revived careers late in life. [[Don Rickles]], whose legendary style of relentless merciless attacks on both fellow performers and audience members alike kept him a fixture on TV and in Vegas from the 1960s all the way to the 2000s, when he appeared in the wildly popular [[Pixar]] ''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]'' films as [[Mr Potato Head]], who just happened to share Don's grouchy onstage mannerisms. Television programs such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' helped publicize the careers of other stand-up comedians, including [[Janeane Garofalo]], [[Bill Maher]] and [[Jay Leno]].\n\nFrom the 1970s to the '90s, different styles of comedy began to emerge, from the madcap stylings of [[Robin Williams]], to the odd observations of [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and [[Ellen DeGeneres]], the ironic musings of [[Steven Wright]], to the mimicry of [[Whoopi Goldberg]], and [[Eddie Murphy]]. These comedians would serve to influence the next generation of comedians.\n\n===Mexico===\n\nIn terms of [[:es:Comedia en vivo#M\u00e9xico|live comedy in Mexico]], the predecessors of this comic style are:\n* [[:es:Los Tepichines|The Tepichines]] are a comic duo who were predecessors of a style consisting of parodies and double senses with creativity\n* [[Miguel Galv\u00e1n]] (1957-2008) Originally from Juan Aldama, Zacatecas. He dropped out of architecture at the Universidad del Valle de M\u00e9xico to take theater classes at the \"Dimitrio Sarr\u00e1s Actors Studio\" for three years.\n* Mara Escalante, is an actress, comedian and Mexican singer. She is known for the television series Mar\u00eda de Todos los \u00c1ngeles, in which she has two characters, including the protagonist. She began her career in the mid-1990s.\n* [[Polo Polo]] (1944-), whose routines are characterized by a high content of sexual references, with a touch of misogyny, relayed as a personal anecdote.\n* [[Adal Ramones]] (1961-) was one of the first to transport the genre to Mexico from his nocturnal program, using the comic monologue.\n* [[Evelio Arias Ramos|Evelio with V Chica]] (Evelio Arias Ramos, 1966-2008).\n* [[Eugenio Derbez]]\n\nThe new generation of comedians decided to use their own lives as the theme of their comedy, imitating the American style:\n\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Su\u00e1rez Gom\u00eds]], son of Mexican comedian [[H\u00e9ctor Su\u00e1rez]], is currently the host of the Latin American version of the comedy program Stand Up Comedy Central Presents, broadcast by Comedy Central from 2011 until 2014.\n* [[Adal Ramones]] since 2013 leads the program called [[:es:STANDparados|STANDparados]] broadcast by [[:es:Distrito Comedia|Comedy District]] before [[Classic TV]].\n* Kikis, (1980) comedian since late 2011, openly lesbian, has participated in [[Comedy Central Latin America]] as well as with [[Adal Ramones]] in STANDparados Comedy District.\n* Luiki Wiki (1985-) began making comedy in January 2013 in Mexico City and later moved to Monterrey NL to start the first Open Mic in Monterrey (an event in which comedians can participate to try out new material with a real audience) together with other comedians of the genre. Later they created the first collective of comedy in Monterrey called For Laughter Standup Comedy. Luiki Wiki has participated in programs such as Es de Noche and I already arrived with Ren\u00e9 Franco and as with [[Adal Ramones]] in the 3rd season of the STANDparados program aired by Comedy District.\n* [[:es:Franco Escamilla|Franco Escamilla]] (1981-) Comedian, musician, radio announcer and founder of \"La Diablo Squad\". He is mainly known for his comedy shows, has performed throughout the Mexican Republic and Latin America, even starting his own \"World Tour\", arriving to have confirmed performances in Europe and the United States, including trips to Japan and Australia. Currently known as the largest representative of Stand up Comedy in this country.\n* Hugo \"El Cojo Fel\u00edz\" (1988-), is a comedian, radio announcer, part of the devil Squad, has the radio program \"La Hora Fel\u00edz\" with the \"Uncle Rober\" and is considered the best pen in Mexico.\n* Roberto Andrade Cer\u00f3n the \"Uncle Rober\" (1979-) is a comedian, writer, radio announcer and has \"La Cojo Feliz\" the radio program \"La Hora Fel\u00edz\".\n*Daniel Sosa \n*Alex Fernandez\n\n=== Brazil ===\nThe one-man-show genre, which is similar, but allows other approaches (enacting characters, songs and scenes) was introduced in Brazil by Jos\u00e9 Vasconcellos in the 60's. Taking a step closer to the North American format, Chico Anysio and J\u00f4 Soares maintained the format - specially in their live nation-wide talks shows, and generally, in the opening monologues - bringing to Brazil a genre more similar to what we currently know as Stand-up.\n\nStand-up began to be interesting news in 2005 in ''S\u00e3o Paulo'', when the first club was created, called ''Clube de Com\u00e9dia Stand-Up:'' composed of Marcelo Mansfield, Rafinha Bastos, Oscar Filho, Marcela Leal and M\u00e1rcio Ribeiro. In S\u00e3o Paulo the comedy club would present in Beverly Hills, the traditional comedy venue in Moema. Shortly afterwards it migrated to Mr. Blues and Bleeker Street, in ''Vila Madalena''. In ''Rio de Janeiro'', ''Com\u00e9dia em P\u00e9, (''Comedy Standing Up): composed of Cl\u00e1udio Torres Gonzaga, F\u00e1bio Porch\u00e1t, Fernando Caruso and Paulo Carvalho, had its debue at the venue ''Rio Design Leblon''. These were the first stand-up performances in the country.\n\nIn 2006, the comic J\u00f4 Soares watched ''Clube de Com\u00e9dia'' in S\u00e3o Paulo and invited the comic Diogo Portugal for an interview in his talk show. That was a definitive moment to call attention towards the genre. He mentioned many different shows that he was a part of and attracted the public attention and media coverage to the bars that held these presentations. In Curitiba, with this momentum, many other stand-up nights began opening up. In S\u00e3o Paulo, Danilo Gentili, that had just become a part of ''Clube da Com\u00e9dia,'' invited M\u00e1rio Ribeiro and gathered other young comics that were frequent spectators at the club, to create ''Com\u00e9dia Ao Vivo'' (Live Comedy): composed of Dani Calabresa, Luiz Fran\u00e7a, F\u00e1bio Rabin.\n\nWith the show CQC - ''Custe o Que Custar'', on the channel Band, a nation-wide tv outlet, in 2008, the genre took gained its permanent spot on the national stage. With bug names like Danilo Gentili, Rafinha Bastos and Oscar Filho, the curiosity grew exponentially. \n\nFollowing CQC's example many channels and tv shows on Brazil's national television invested in Stand-up comedy. After this many other groups gained recognition in the clubs and live performances around the two biggest cities of Brazil.\n\n== History of stand-up in Asia ==\n===India===\n[[File:Kapil sharma.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Kapil Sharma (comedian)|Kapil Sharma]] an Indian stand up comedian, known for comedy nights with Kapil]]\nModern stand-up comedy in India is a young art form, however [[Chakyar koothu]] was prominent in [[Trivandrum]] and southern [[Kerala]] during the 16th and 17th centuries.

Thus, a lot more comedians became popular and started performing various live and TV shows. The demand for comedy content continues to increase. Some popular comedians around 2005-2008 include Raju Srivastav, Kapil Sharma, Sunil Pal etc. Most of them performed their acts in Hindi.\n\n[[File:Raju-Srivastav.jpg|right|thumb|160px|right|thumb|150px|New generation stand up comedian [[Raju Srivastav]]]]\n[[Raju Srivastav]] first appeared on the comedy talent show ''[[The Great Indian Laughter Challenge]]''.

Both of them were exposed to UK and US comedy routines and they performed mostly in English. At the same time, a few more youngsters got inspired and started taking plunge into stand-up comedy.\n\nSince 2011, the stand-up comedy has been getting substantial appreciation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} The Comedy Store from London opened an outlet in Mumbai's Palladium Mall where people would regularly enjoy comedians from UK. The Comedy Story also supported local comedians and helped them grow. This outlet eventually become Canvas Laugh Club in Mumbai.\n\nAround 2011, people started organizing different comedy open mic events in Mumbai, Delhi (and Gurgaon), Bangalore. All of this happened in association with growth of a counterculture in Indian cities which catered to the appetite of younger generations for live events for comedy, poetry, storytelling, and music. Various stand up events were covered by popular news channels such NDTV / Aajtak etc. and were appreciated by millions of viewers.\n\nAs a result of these developments, plus the increasing penetration of [[YouTube]] (along with [[Internet]]/[[World Wide Web]]), Indian stand up comedy started reaching further masses. While the established comedians such as Vir Das, Papa CJ were independently growing through various corporate / international performances, other comedians such as [[Vipul Goyal]], [[Biswa Kalyan Rath]], [[Kenny Sebastian]], [[Kanan Gill]] grew popular through YouTube videos.\n\nThe industry, still in its early stages, now sees a lot more influx of aspiring comedians as it transforms the ecosystem around it.\n\n==Training and improvisation==\n\n[[Mark Twain]] and [[Jerry Seinfeld]],  both American masters of stand-up comedy, believe in practice and rehearsal.

They often opened their programs with topical monologues, characterized by [[ad-lib]]s and discussions about anything from the latest films to a missed birthday. Each program tended to be divided into the opening monologue, musical number, followed by a [[sketch comedy|skit]] or story routine. A \"feud\" between [[Fred Allen]] and [[Jack Benny]] was used as comic material for nearly a decade.\n\n[[Home Box Office|HBO]] presented comedians uncensored for the first time, beginning with [[Robert Klein]] in 1975, and was instrumental in reaching larger audiences. George Carlin was a perennial favorite, who appeared in 14 HBO comedy specials.\n\nContinuing that tradition, most modern stand-up comedians use television or motion pictures to reach a level of success and recognition unattainable in the comedy-club circuit alone.\n\nLate-night talk shows and award show ceremonies are commonly hosted by comedians, delivering monologues similar to stand-up.\n\nSince the mid-2000s, online video-sharing sites such as [[YouTube]] have also provided a venue for stand-up comedians, and many comedians' performances can be viewed online.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailybits.com/watch-stand-up-comedians-on-youtube/|title=Watch Stand Up Comedians on YouTube|accessdate=2008-09-27 |work= Daniel Scocco |publisher=Dailybits.com |date=2008-09-23}}</ref>\n\nAn Amazon TV show, ''[[The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel]]'', depicts the fictional life of a woman comedian, set in the late 1950s.
