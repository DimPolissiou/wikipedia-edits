In his tweets, Nav shared his thoughts that had ranged \"from angry and bitter to motivational and inspirational\". After his tweets and release of the single, Nav decided to step it up a notch by sending shots at the outlet's editor-in-chief Vanessa Satten through now deleted Instagram posts and further continued to diss the outlet.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://hiphopwired.com/747419/nav-blasts-xxls-editor-in-chief-says-freshmen-list-website-is-trash/ | title=Nav Blasts XXL's Editor-In-Chief, Says Freshmen List & Website is Trash| date=2018-03-20}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, Nav and Lil Uzi Vert were accused by Kid Buu of stealing his flow for their hit single, \"Wanted You\" which had charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. However, he was confronted a few months later by Cash, Nav's manager, and admitted that he was lying in an attempt to stir up controversy and gain attention.\n\nIn August 2018, Nav featured on Travis Scott's third studio album, ''[[Astroworld (album)|Astroworld]]'', on the song \"[[Yosemite (song)|Yosemite]]\" alongside fellow rapper [[Gunna (rapper)|Gunna]].

Scott and producer [[Mike Dean (record producer)|Mike Dean]] later confirmed this was an error, and re-mixed and re-released the track on streaming services with the updated vocal mix a week after the release of the song and album.\n\nIn March 2019 during an interview with Pitchfork, Nav expressed his frustration stating that \"Fame is something I want, it's a good problem to have. I'm still not there, because when I walk out of fucking Delilah in L.A. and [[TMZ]] will be standing out there with cameras and not even take a picture of me, I get sick.

Scott and producer [[Mike Dean (record producer)|Mike Dean]] later confirmed this was an error, and re-mixed and re-released the track on streaming services with the updated vocal mix a week after the release of the song and album.\n\nIn March 2019 during an interview with Pitchfork, Nav expressed his frustration stating that \"Fame is something I want, it's a good problem to have.

The film became a major blockbuster at the box office and received mostly positive reviews from critics.

The film starred [[Amitabh Bachchan]] as an egotistical rich industrialist, [[Jaya Bachchan]] as his compassionate wife, and Shah Rukh Khan and [[Hrithik Roshan]] as their two sons. It also featured Kajol and [[Kareena Kapoor]] as sisters from a lower-class family who become the love interests of Khan and Roshan respectively. The film became Johar's second major blockbuster at the box office and received mostly positive reviews from critics. Critic Taran Adarsh commented that Johar \"confirms the fact that he is the brightest in film firmament.

The film was a major success in India and an even larger success overseas. It received mostly positive reviews from critics who praised Johar's departure from the directorial style of his first two films. Rajeev Masand wrote, \"Few writers have such solid control over their screenplay as Karan Johar does. Few understand the intricacies of narrative as well as he does.
