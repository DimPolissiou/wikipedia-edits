It stands on its pads and is not usually heavy-footed. Ideally, they have an even and graceful [[gait]]. Traditionally, the ears are [[Cropping (animal)|cropped]] and posted and the tail is [[docking (dog)|docked]]. However, in some countries, these are now illegal. Dobermanns have markings on the chest, paws/legs, muzzle, above the eyes, and underneath the tail.\n\nDobermanns are known to be intelligent, alert, and tenaciously loyal companions and [[guard dog]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/15/opinion/l-dobermans-suffer-from-a-bad-press-003793.html|title=Dobermans Suffer From a Bad Press|publisher=|accessdate=20 August 2018}}</ref> Personality varies a great deal between each individual but, if taken care of and trained properly, they are generally considered to be loving and devoted companions. The Dobermann is driven, strong, and sometimes stubborn. With a consistent approach, they can be easy to train and will learn very quickly.\n\n== Appearance ==\nWorld [[Breed standard]]s are published by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale]], or FCI (World Canine Organisation), on the advice of the IDC (International Dobermann Club), which is the Dobermann breed's governing council and has 36 countries in its member list. To become a world champion, dogs are judged to FCI standards. The AKC has its own standards, as do some other countries, although most still adhere to FCI standards. The breed standard describes the Dobermann as a dog of medium size that is also strong and muscularly built. In order to be eligible to meet these standards, the body of the Dobermann should appear to be almost square.\nIt should also appear elegant and noble.\n\nThe dog was originally intended as a guard dog,<ref name=\"akc\">{{cite web\n|publisher=American Kennel Club\n|url = http://www.akc.org/breeds/doberman_pinscher/index.cfm\n|title= American Kennel Club: Doberman Pinscher breed standard.\n|accessdate = 4 February 2009\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\"ckc\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.ckc.ca/en/Files/Forms/Shows-Trials/Breed-Standards/Group-3-Working/DBP-Doberman-Pinscher\n|title=Canadian Kennel Club: Doberman Pinscher breed standard.\n|quote=Size: \"Males, decidedly masculine, without coarseness.

This has led some to argue that Dobermanns and Doberman Pinschers should be considered and evaluated differently.<ref name=\"akc\"/>\n\n=== Size and proportions ===\nAlthough the breed standards vary among kennel and breed clubs, most follow the standard set by the FCI, which describes the size of male dogs as {{convert|68|to|72|cm|in}} at the [[withers]];<ref name=\"FCI\" /> [[The Kennel Club]] in the UK quotes {{convert|69|cm|in}} as being ideal.<ref name=\"ukc\" /> The size of female dogs, according to the same standards, is {{convert|63|to|68|cm|in}},<ref name=FCI/> with {{convert|65|cm|in}} being ideal.<ref name=\"ukc\">{{cite web\n|publisher=The Kennel Club (UK)\n|url = http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/services/public/breed/display.aspx?id=5121\n|title= UK Kennel Club: Dobermann breed standard.\n|accessdate = 6 February 2009\n}}</ref> The Dobermann has a square frame; its length should equal its height to the withers and the length of its head, neck, and legs should be in proportion to its body.<ref name=\"akc\"/>\n\nThe standards for the weight of the Dobermann are also described by the FCI. The ideal dog must be of a sufficient size for an optimal combination of strength, endurance and agility.<ref name=\"ukc\"/> The ideal weight of male dogs is described as {{convert|40|-|45|kg|lb}}<ref name=FCI/> and the ideal weight of female dogs is described to be {{convert|32|-|35|kg|lb}}.<ref name=FCI/>\n\n=== Color ===\nTwo different color genes exist in the Dobermann: one for ''black'' (B) and one for ''color dilution'' (D). There are nine possible combinations of these [[allele]]s, which can result in four different color [[phenotypes]]: black, blue, red, and [[Fawn (colour)|fawn]] (Isabella).<ref name=\"DPCA-color\">{{cite web\n|url=http://dpca.org/breed/breed_color.htm\n|publisher= Doberman Pinscher Club of America\n|title= Color Chart\n|accessdate=23 March 2007\n}}</ref> The traditional and most common color occurs when both the color and dilution genes have at least one [[Dominant gene|dominant]] allele (i.e., BBDD, BBDd, BbDD or BbDd) and is commonly referred to as ''black'', ''black and rust,'' or ''black and tan''. The ''red'', ''red rust,'' or ''brown'' coloration occurs when the black gene has two [[Recessive gene|recessive]] alleles but the dilution gene has at least one dominant allele (i.e., bbDD, bbDd). The ''blue'' Dobermann has the color gene with at least one dominant allele and the dilution gene with both recessive alleles (i.e., BBdd or Bbdd). The ''fawn'' coloration is the least common, occurring only when both the color and dilution genes have two recessive alleles (i.e., bbdd). Thus, the blue color is a diluted black, and the fawn color is a diluted red.\n\nExpression of the color dilution gene is a disorder called [[Canine follicular dysplasia|Color Dilution Alopecia]], a kind of canine follicular dysplasia. Although not life-threatening, these dogs can develop skin problems.<ref name=\"dilution\">{{cite journal\n|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3164.1990.tb00089.x\n|title=Colour Dilution Alopecia in Doberman Pinschers with Blue or Fawn Coat Colours: A Study on the Incidence and Histopathology of this Disorder\n|author=WILLIAM H.

This tight inbreeding continued for some time to allow the breeders to \"fix\" the mutation. White Dobermanns are a cream color with white markings and blue eyes.

These traits served the dog well in its role as a [[Guard dog|personal defense dog]], [[police dog]], or [[Dogs in warfare|war dog]], but were not ideally adapted to a companionship role. The Dobermann's aggression has been toned down by modern breeders over the years, however. Today's Dobermanns are known to have a much more even and good-natured temperament, as well as extreme loyalty, high intelligence, and great trainability.  The modern Dobermann is known to be energetic, watchful, fearless, and obedient.<ref name=\"Get to Know the Doberman Pinscher\"/>\n[[File:Dobermannwurf.jpg|thumb|right|Doberman Pinscher puppies]]\nThey can easily learn to respect and protect their owners and are therefore considered by many to be excellent guard dogs. Given that they are properly socialized from a young age, they are generally sociable toward familiar humans and can also be sociable with other dogs. However, Dobermanns do rank among the more-likely breeds to show aggressive behaviour toward strangers and other dogs, though they are not among the ''most'' likely to do so. They are highly unlikely to show aggressive behaviour toward their owners.\n\nThere is some evidence that Doberman Pinschers in North America have a calmer and more even temperament than their European counterparts because of the breeding strategies employed by American breeders.<ref name=\"coren\">{{cite book\n| title=Why does my dog act that way?\n| author=Stanley Coren\n| publisher=Simon & Schuster\n| year=2006\n| isbn=978-0-7432-7706-8\n| url=https://archive.org/details/whydoesmydogactt00core\n}}</ref> Because of these differences in breeding strategies, different lines of Doberman Pinschers have developed different traits. Although many contemporary Doberman Pinschers in North America are gentle and friendly to strangers, some lines are bred more true to the original personality standard.<ref name=\"dcpa-temp\">{{cite web\n|url=http://dpca.org/breed/breed_temperament.htm\n|title=A candid look at Doberman temperament\n|accessdate=9 February 2009\n|publisher=The Doberman Pinscher Club of America\n}}</ref>\n\nThe personality of the Doberman Pinscher is known to be unique. There is a great deal of scientific evidence that Doberman Pinschers have a number of stable psychological traits, such as certain personality factors and intelligence. As early as 1965, studies have shown that there are several broad behavioral traits that significantly predict behavior and are genetically determined.<ref name=\"scott\">{{cite book\n|author1=Scott, J.P.\n|author2=Fuller, J.L.\n|year=1966\n|title=Genetics and the Social Behavior of the Dog\n|publisher=University of Chicago Press\n|isbn=978-0-226-74338-7\n|url=https://archive.org/details/dogbehaviorgenet00scot\n}}</ref> Subsequently, there have been numerous scientific attempts to quantify canine [[Personality psychology|personality]] or temperament by using [[factor Analysis|statistical]] techniques for assessing personality traits in humans. These studies often vary in terms of the personality factors they focus on and in terms of ranking breeds differently along these dimensions. One such study found that Doberman Pinschers, compared to other breeds, rank high in playfulness, average in curiosity/fearlessness, low on aggressiveness, and low on sociability.<ref>{{cite journal\n|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science\n|title=Breed-typical behaviour in dogs\u2014Historical remnants or recent constructs?\n|author=Kenth Svartberg\n|year=2006\n|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2005.06.014\n|volume=96\n|issue=3\u20134\n|pages=293\u2013313\n|citeseerx=10.1.1.515.7023\n}}</ref> Another such study ranked Doberman Pinschers low on reactivity/surgence and high on aggression/disagreeableness and openness/trainability.<ref name=\"draper\">\n{{citation\n|author=Thomas Draper\n|year=1995\n|title=Canine analogs of human personality factors\n|journal=Journal of General Psychology\n|volume=122\n|issue=3\n|doi=10.1080/00221309.1995.9921236\n|pmid=7650520\n|pages=241\u2013252\n}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the studies of canine personality, there has been some research to determine whether there are breed differences in aggression.

The Doberman Pinscher ranked as average on dog-directed aggression and dog rivalry. Looking only at bites and attempted bites, Doberman Pinschers rank as far less aggressive towards humans and show less aggression than many breeds without a reputation (e.g., [[Cocker Spaniel]], Dalmatian, and [[Great Dane]]). This study concluded that aggression has a genetic basis, that the Dobermann shows a distinctive pattern of aggression depending on the situation and that contemporary Doberman Pinschers are not an aggressive breed overall.<ref name=\"duffy2008\"/> In regards to Dobermanns attacking owners, it is rare and usually in the case of overdiscipline. Dobermanns accept physical punishment to an extent. However, when they consider it to no longer be punishment, but an attack on themselves, they will defend themselves.\n\nAccording to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], between 1979 and 1998, the Doberman Pinscher was involved in attacks on humans resulting in fatalities less frequently than several other dog breeds such as [[German Shepherd|German Shepherd Dogs]], [[Rottweiler]]s, [[Husky]]-type dogs, [[Wolfdog|wolf-dog hybrid]]s and [[Alaskan Malamute]]s.<ref name=\"CDC\">[https://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/duip/dogbreeds.pdf US Centers for Disease Control: Breeds of dogs involved in fatal human attacks in the United States between 1979 and 1998].

With access to dogs of many breeds, he got the idea to create a breed that would be ideal for protecting him. He set out to breed a new type of dog that would exhibit impressive stamina, strength, and intelligence. Five years after his death, Otto Goeller, one of the earliest breeders, created the National Doberman Pinscher Club and is considered to have perfected the breed, breeding and refining them in the 1890s.<ref>{{Cite book| title= Doberman Pinschers| last= Donnelly| first= Kerry| publisher= T.F.H.

The exact ratios of mixing, and even the exact breeds that were used, remain uncertain, although many experts believe that the Dobermann Pinscher is a combination of several breeds including the [[Beauceron]], [[German Pinscher]], [[Rottweiler]] and [[Weimaraner]].<ref name=\"Breeds\">{{cite web |url= http://www.dpca.org/breed/breed_history.htm |title=Breed history |publisher= Dobermann Pinscher Club of America |accessdate= 24 August 2016}}</ref> The single exception is the documented crossing with the [[Greyhound]] and [[Manchester Terrier]]. It is also widely believed that the old German Shepherd was the single largest contributor to the Dobermann breed. Philip Greunig's ''The Dobermann Pinscher'' (1939) describes the breed's early development by Otto Goeller, who helped to establish the breed. The [[American Kennel Club]] believes the breeds utilized to develop the Dobermann Pinscher may have included the old shorthaired shepherd, Rottweiler, Black and Tan Terrier and the German Pinscher.<ref name=\"Get to Know the Doberman Pinscher\"/>\n\nAfter Dobermann's death in 1894, the Germans named the breed Dobermann-pinscher in his honor, but a half century later dropped the word 'pinscher' on the grounds that this German word for 'terrier' was no longer appropriate. The British did the same a few years later; now the US and Canada are the only countries who continue to use Pinscher and have dropped an \"n\" from Dobermann's surname.<ref name=\"Breeds\" />\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the [[United States Marine Corps]] adopted the Doberman Pinscher as its official [[war dog]], although the Corps did not exclusively use this breed in the role.\n\nIn the United States, the [[American Kennel Club]] ranked the Doberman Pinscher as the 12th most popular dog breed in 2012 and 2013.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm |title= AKC Dog Registration Statistics| publisher= American Kennel Club| website= AKC.org| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070716173939/http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm |archivedate= 16 July 2007| access-date= 6 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Popularity==\nThe Dobermann became very popular over a short period of time.

They starred in the 1972 American film ''[[The Doberman Gang]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Doberman Gang, The |journal=Monthly Film Bulletin |date=January 1974 |volume=41 |issue=480 |page=174}}</ref> Dobermanns also became popular after winning four Westminster Kennel Club Dog Shows in 1939, 1952, 1953 and 1989. The Dobermann was recognised (as the Doberman Pinscher) by the American Kennel Club in 1908 and since then they have been one of the most popular dog breeds due to their intelligence and agility. Even today, the numbers of Dobermann dog registrations are increasing.<ref>{{cite web|title= Doberman Dog Breed Information|author=Dogspot|url=https://www.dogspot.in/dobermann/}}</ref> They are also featured in the music video \"[[What's My Name?

To become a world champion, dogs are judged to FCI standards. The AKC has its own standards, as do some other countries, although most still adhere to FCI standards.

The ''red'', ''red rust,'' or ''brown'' coloration occurs when the black gene has two [[Recessive gene|recessive]] alleles but the dilution gene has at least one dominant allele (i.e., bbDD, bbDd). The ''blue'' Dobermann has the color gene with at least one dominant allele and the dilution gene with both recessive alleles (i.e., BBdd or Bbdd).

These traits served the dog well in its role as a [[Guard dog|personal defense dog]], [[police dog]], or [[Dogs in warfare|war dog]], but were not ideally adapted to a companionship role. The Dobermann's aggression has been toned down by modern breeders over the years, however. Today's Dobermanns are known to have a much more even and good-natured temperament, as well as extreme loyalty, high intelligence, and great trainability.  The modern Dobermann is known to be energetic, watchful, fearless, and obedient.<ref name=\"Get to Know the Doberman Pinscher\"/>\n[[File:Dobermannwurf.jpg|thumb|right|Doberman Pinscher puppies]]\nThey can easily learn to respect and protect their owners and are therefore considered by many to be excellent guard dogs. Given that they are properly socialized from a young age, they are generally sociable toward familiar humans and can also be sociable with other dogs. However, Dobermanns do rank among the more-likely breeds to show aggressive behaviour toward strangers and other dogs, though they are not among the ''most'' likely to do so. They are highly unlikely to show aggressive behaviour toward their owners.\n\nThere is some evidence that Doberman Pinschers in North America have a calmer and more even temperament than their European counterparts because of the breeding strategies employed by American breeders.<ref name=\"coren\">{{cite book\n| title=Why does my dog act that way?\n| author=Stanley Coren\n| publisher=Simon & Schuster\n| year=2006\n| isbn=978-0-7432-7706-8\n| url=https://archive.org/details/whydoesmydogactt00core\n}}</ref> Because of these differences in breeding strategies, different lines of Doberman Pinschers have developed different traits.

There is a great deal of scientific evidence that Doberman Pinschers have a number of stable psychological traits, such as certain personality factors and intelligence.

The Doberman Pinscher ranked as average on dog-directed aggression and dog rivalry. Looking only at bites and attempted bites, Doberman Pinschers rank as far less aggressive towards humans and show less aggression than many breeds without a reputation (e.g., [[Cocker Spaniel]], Dalmatian, and [[Great Dane]]). This study concluded that aggression has a genetic basis, that the Dobermann shows a distinctive pattern of aggression depending on the situation and that contemporary Doberman Pinschers are not an aggressive breed overall.<ref name=\"duffy2008\"/> In regards to Dobermanns attacking owners, it is rare and usually in the case of overdiscipline. Dobermanns accept physical punishment to an extent. However, when they consider it to no longer be punishment, but an attack on themselves, they will defend themselves.\n\nAccording to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], between 1979 and 1998, the Doberman Pinscher was involved in attacks on humans resulting in fatalities less frequently than several other dog breeds such as [[German Shepherd|German Shepherd Dogs]], [[Rottweiler]]s, [[Husky]]-type dogs, [[Wolfdog|wolf-dog hybrid]]s and [[Alaskan Malamute]]s.<ref name=\"CDC\">[https://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/duip/dogbreeds.pdf US Centers for Disease Control: Breeds of dogs involved in fatal human attacks in the United States between 1979 and 1998].

With access to dogs of many breeds, he got the idea to create a breed that would be ideal for protecting him. He set out to breed a new type of dog that would exhibit impressive stamina, strength, and intelligence. Five years after his death, Otto Goeller, one of the earliest breeders, created the National Doberman Pinscher Club and is considered to have perfected the breed, breeding and refining them in the 1890s.<ref>{{Cite book| title= Doberman Pinschers| last= Donnelly| first= Kerry| publisher= T.F.H.

The exact ratios of mixing, and even the exact breeds that were used, remain uncertain, although many experts believe that the Dobermann Pinscher is a combination of several breeds including the [[Beauceron]], [[German Pinscher]], [[Rottweiler]] and [[Weimaraner]].<ref name=\"Breeds\">{{cite web |url= http://www.dpca.org/breed/breed_history.htm |title=Breed history |publisher= Dobermann Pinscher Club of America |accessdate= 24 August 2016}}</ref> The single exception is the documented crossing with the [[Greyhound]] and [[Manchester Terrier]]. It is also widely believed that the old German Shepherd was the single largest contributor to the Dobermann breed. Philip Greunig's ''The Dobermann Pinscher'' (1939) describes the breed's early development by Otto Goeller, who helped to establish the breed. The [[American Kennel Club]] believes the breeds utilized to develop the Dobermann Pinscher may have included the old shorthaired shepherd, Rottweiler, Black and Tan Terrier and the German Pinscher.<ref name=\"Get to Know the Doberman Pinscher\"/>\n\nAfter Dobermann's death in 1894, the Germans named the breed Dobermann-pinscher in his honor, but a half century later dropped the word 'pinscher' on the grounds that this German word for 'terrier' was no longer appropriate. The British did the same a few years later; now the US and Canada are the only countries who continue to use Pinscher and have dropped an \"n\" from Dobermann's surname.<ref name=\"Breeds\" />\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the [[United States Marine Corps]] adopted the Doberman Pinscher as its official [[war dog]], although the Corps did not exclusively use this breed in the role.\n\nIn the United States, the [[American Kennel Club]] ranked the Doberman Pinscher as the 12th most popular dog breed in 2012 and 2013.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm |title= AKC Dog Registration Statistics| publisher= American Kennel Club| website= AKC.org| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070716173939/http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm |archivedate= 16 July 2007| access-date= 6 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Popularity==\nThe Dobermann became very popular over a short period of time. It is a relatively new breed, less than 150 years old. According to the latest ranking in 2017 by the American Kennel Club,<ref>{{cite web|title=Most Popular Dog Breeds|url=http://www.akc.org/expert-advice/news/most-popular-dog-breeds-full-ranking-list/}}</ref> Dobermanns are the 16th most popular dog breed. Dobermanns started to become popular when they were used in World War II as guard dogs. In the 1970s, Dobermanns had their fair share in movies. They starred in the 1972 American film ''[[The Doberman Gang]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Doberman Gang, The |journal=Monthly Film Bulletin |date=January 1974 |volume=41 |issue=480 |page=174}}</ref> Dobermanns also became popular after winning four Westminster Kennel Club Dog Shows in 1939, 1952, 1953 and 1989. The Dobermann was recognised (as the Doberman Pinscher) by the American Kennel Club in 1908 and since then they have been one of the most popular dog breeds due to their intelligence and agility. Even today, the numbers of Dobermann dog registrations are increasing.<ref>{{cite web|title= Doberman Dog Breed Information|author=Dogspot|url=https://www.dogspot.in/dobermann/}}</ref> They are also featured in the music video \"[[What's My Name?

A relative of Yan, Liang rose rapidly through Shanxi's power structure, founding and leading a number of organizations dedicated to combating both internal and external threats to Yan's rule. At first radically socialist and later radically anti-communist, Liang's life illustrates the rapid and dramatic career changes that were not uncommon in the chaotic age in which he lived. Liang is best known for the way that he died, committing suicide in a spectacular fashion as a final act of defiance against Shanxi's Communist invaders.\n\nLike many Chinese men before 1949, Liang had more than one name. In contemporary Chinese sources he is more commonly known as \"Liang Dunhou\" (\u6881\u6566\u539a).\n\n==Early career==\n[[File:Yan Xishan, Liang Huazhi and Yan Huiqing.jpg|thumb|Before [[Yan Xishan]] (right) left Taiyuan by plane in 1949, Liang Huazhi (left) and [[Yan Huiqing]] (middle) saw off at the airport]]\nLiang's political career began in 1932, at the age of 26, when he was named a member of the Kuomintang Shanxi Provincial Governing Committee.<ref Name=\"Schemmel\">Schemmel</ref> Liang was Yan Xishan's nephew, and rapidly gained power within Yan's government in the environment created by Yan's radical economic policies (modeled on those of the Soviet Union) in the early 1930s. The opposition that Yan's socialist economic policies aroused among Shanxi's traditional elites made Yan favour the service of young, progressive followers with modern educations. From the start, Liang's influence on his uncle Yan was profound. By the 1930s Liang was the leader of the group of young bureaucrats in Shanxi who admired the industrial accomplishments of the [[Soviet Union]], and who were determined to see a similar degree of economic progress achieved in modern China. Liang's enthusiasm for realizing Soviet accomplishments were so well known that, before the Second Sino-Japanese War, a Japanese writer accused Liang of being a Communist.<ref>Gillin 173</ref> Liang worked as Yan's secret representative to the [[Chinese Communist Party]] in 1936, and he succeeded in negotiating an anti-Japanese \"united front\" agreement between Yan and the Communists in October 1936.<ref>Feng and Goodman 157</ref>\n\n==Second Sino-Japanese War==\nIn September 1936, on the eve of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Yan created the \"Patriotic Sacrifice League\", a semi-independent organization composed primarily of students and recent graduates for the purpose of encouraging the resistance against the Japanese invasion of China that Yan believed was imminent. Liang, who by 1936 was serving as Yan's personal secretary and enjoyed Yan's complete confidence, became one of the main leaders of the Sacrifice League.<ref>Gillin 231-232</ref>  In 1937 the Japanese finally invaded and occupied the northern half of Shanxi, suffering over 50,000 casualties.<ref>Gillin 273-274</ref> After the Japanese invasion Liang served as the Director of the Political Department of the Second War Zone,<ref Name=\"Schemmel\" /> which included Shanxi, [[Suiyuan]], [[Chahar Province|Chahar]], and northern [[Shaanxi]]. In order to help defeat the Japanese Yan enlisted the assistance of the Communists, who entered Shanxi and initially cooperated with Yan in order to defeat the Japanese.<ref>Gillin 263</ref>\n\nIn July 1937, shortly after the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]], Liang's Sacrifice League led efforts to arrest, and promote awareness about the dangers of, Japanese spies and ''[[hanjian]]''.<ref>Gillin 257</ref>  After the Japanese began to seriously  threaten Yan's capital of Taiyuan, Yan authorized the expansion of the Sacrifice League's \"Dare-to-Die Corps\" to a force of 15,000 men. This branch of the Sacrifice League became known as the \"New Army\", was composed mostly of young students,<ref>Gillin 262</ref> and became known for its fanatical resistance against the Japanese and for the pro-Communist views of its membership.<ref>Gillin 278</ref> During 1937 and 1938 Yan actively replaced his own magistrates with members of the Sacrifice League, who he believed were less selfish, more enthusiastic, and thus better qualified to lead an organized resistance against Japan.<ref>Gillin 274</ref> After withdrawing to southern Shanxi and waging a guerilla war against the Japanese, Yan owed much of his ability to work with and mobilize the local people to the efforts of Liang's Sacrifice League, whose members placed a high priority on their cooperation with the common people.<ref>Gillin 277</ref>\n\nBy 1939 Yan's relationship with the Communists had become very poor. Because the Sacrifice League was suspected of being pro-Communist, Yan actively suppressed it, arresting many of its members and attempting to disarm its Dare-to-Die Corps. Those who escaped fled to join the Communists. Liang remained loyal to Yan; and, by the early 1940s, was known as being fanatically anti-Communist. After the destruction of the Sacrifice League, Liang became the commander of Yan's police force, responsible for investigating and arresting citizens suspected of being Communists in the area that Yan controlled. Liang's rapid intellectual change, from radical support to radical opposition of Communists and communism, illustrates the dramatic shifts of allegiance that often took place within the minds of individual Chinese between 1937 and 1945.<ref>Gillin 278, 282</ref>\n\n==Civil War==\nHostilities continued between the Communists and Yan's forces shortly after the surrender of the Japanese in 1945. These hostilities continued until 1949, when the Communists took control of most of Shanxi, completely surrounding Yan's capital, Taiyuan, and cutting it off from all sources of military and logistical supply.<ref>Gillin 288</ref> In 1949, shortly before his death, Liang was named the Chairman of the Government of Shanxi.<ref Name=\"Schemmel\" />\n\nThe fall of Taiyuan was one of the few examples in the [[Chinese Civil War]] in which Nationalist forces echoed the defeated Ming loyalists who had, in the 17th century, brought entire cities to ruins resisting the invading Manchus.  Many Nationalist officers were reported to have committed suicide when the city fell. Liang Huazhi fought for years against the Communists in Shanxi until he was finally trapped in the massively fortified city of Taiyuan.  For six months Liang led a savage resistance, leading both Yan's remaining forces and those of the warlord's thousands of Japanese mercenaries.  When Communist troops finally broke into the city and began to occupy large sections of it, Liang barricaded himself inside a large, fortified prison complex filled with Communist prisoners.  In a final act of self-sacrifice, Liang set fire to the prison and committed suicide as the entire compound burned to the ground.<ref>Spence 488</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|18em}}\n\n==References==\n* Feng Chongyi and Goodman, David S.

{"title_page": "Internet Scrabble Club", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=January 2011}}\n\nThe '''Internet Scrabble Club''' ('''ISC''') is a website that allows players around the world to play [[Scrabble]]. Players can join the ISC by registering a username, then downloading WordBiz, free software that allows the player to view the interface.\n\n==Using ISC==\n\nPlayers start games either by sending or accepting a \"seek,\" or sending or accepting a match request. A seek is a request for a game with certain parameters, including the time limit (between 3 and 60 whole minutes), the type of [[challenge (Scrabble)|challenge]] (SINGLE, DOUBLE, 5-POINTS, or VOID), and the minimum and maximum ratings criteria that the other player must meet.\n\n==Organisation and management==\n\nThe ISC was created and is run by the player known as Carol (real name Florin Gheorghe), who lives in [[Romania]], hence the URL www.isc.ro. The other administrator is Herve, who is the 2005 [[Francophone Scrabble|French matchplay national champion]], [[Herv\u00e9 Bohbot]].\n\nThe administrators invite certain players to be moderators, also known as helpers. There is a command, 'ASK', whereby players may ask questions of the helpers; if a helper answers a question, the question and the answer will appear on channel 0. Some helpers are given the power to restrict the activities of players who have violated the rules of the site, e.g. by using inappropriate language.  The primary function of the moderators, who are only intermittently present, is to answer questions about the site and to moderate the language and content of the discussions in order to make the site pleasant for most players.\n\nThe players are split into two categories\u2014members and contributory members. The ISC is a free service; no member needs to pay to use the site's facilities. But there are benefits for contributory or support players, who pay an annual fee.  These benefits include the right to play against computer players, to save games in a library, to use an examiner program that suggests solutions for game positions, and many others. A full list of benefits can be found at the ISC website linked below.\n\n== Bots ==\nThere are about 35 robots that are playable on ISC. On the server, which is hosted in the US, the list of bots is accessed using \"who C\". Contributory members have priority over non-contributory members when requesting to play against these robots. The bots have different skill levels. Bamse, Adela, and Myrrhs are novices; Keres, Automat, and Dogberry are intermediates; Waxberry, Alehin, and Woland are experts. It is advised that the initial time be set relatively high, because the bots take no time to make their moves.  On the ISC seek graph, bots are denoted by a square instead of a dot. The bots also have C next to their names. Finally, players who intend to use an anagram program on ISC must inform Carol or Herve, the administrators, so \"C labels\" can be assigned to them.\n\n== Other languages on the ISC ==\nThe ISC does its best to use official word lists\u2014those used in club and tournament competition in various countries. It uses two English-language word sets: TWL15, which is used in the U.S., Canada, Thailand and Israel, and [[SOWPODS]], which is used for the rest of the world. But the ISC caters to multiple languages. It uses ODS 5 for French, LOC v.4 for Romanian, ZINGA for Italian and SWL for Dutch. There is also the \"Multi\" dictionary, which consists of English, French, and Romanian words, and has proved popular for online tournaments.\n\nThere is also the option of playing [[Clabbers]].

Players can join the ISC by registering a username, then downloading WordBiz, free software that allows the player to view the interface.\n\n==Using ISC==\n\nPlayers start games either by sending or accepting a \"seek,\" or sending or accepting a match request. A seek is a request for a game with certain parameters, including the time limit (between 3 and 60 whole minutes), the type of [[challenge (Scrabble)|challenge]] (SINGLE, DOUBLE, 5-POINTS, or VOID), and the minimum and maximum ratings criteria that the other player must meet.\n\n==Organisation and management==\n\nThe ISC was created and is run by the player known as Carol (real name Florin Gheorghe), who lives in [[Romania]], hence the URL www.isc.ro. The other administrator is Herve, who is the 2005 [[Francophone Scrabble|French matchplay national champion]], [[Herv\u00e9 Bohbot]].\n\nThe administrators invite certain players to be moderators, also known as helpers. There is a command, 'ASK', whereby players may ask questions of the helpers; if a helper answers a question, the question and the answer will appear on channel 0. Some helpers are given the power to restrict the activities of players who have violated the rules of the site, e.g. by using inappropriate language.  The primary function of the moderators, who are only intermittently present, is to answer questions about the site and to moderate the language and content of the discussions in order to make the site pleasant for most players.\n\nThe players are split into two categories\u2014members and contributory members. The ISC is a free service; no member needs to pay to use the site's facilities. But there are benefits for contributory or support players, who pay an annual fee.  These benefits include the right to play against computer players, to save games in a library, to use an examiner program that suggests solutions for game positions, and many others. A full list of benefits can be found at the ISC website linked below.\n\n== Bots ==\nThere are about 35 robots that are playable on ISC. On the server, which is hosted in the US, the list of bots is accessed using \"who C\". Contributory members have priority over non-contributory members when requesting to play against these robots. The bots have different skill levels. Bamse, Adela, and Myrrhs are novices; Keres, Automat, and Dogberry are intermediates; Waxberry, Alehin, and Woland are experts. It is advised that the initial time be set relatively high, because the bots take no time to make their moves.  On the ISC seek graph, bots are denoted by a square instead of a dot. The bots also have C next to their names. Finally, players who intend to use an anagram program on ISC must inform Carol or Herve, the administrators, so \"C labels\" can be assigned to them.\n\n== Other languages on the ISC ==\nThe ISC does its best to use official word lists\u2014those used in club and tournament competition in various countries. It uses two English-language word sets: TWL15, which is used in the U.S., Canada, Thailand and Israel, and [[SOWPODS]], which is used for the rest of the world. But the ISC caters to multiple languages. It uses ODS 5 for French, LOC v.4 for Romanian, ZINGA for Italian and SWL for Dutch. There is also the \"Multi\" dictionary, which consists of English, French, and Romanian words, and has proved popular for online tournaments.\n\nThere is also the option of playing [[Clabbers]].

[[Demography]] is a [[social science]] which entails the statistical study of populations. \nPopulation, in simpler terms, is the number of people in a city or town, region, country or world; population is usually determined by a process called census (a process of collecting, analyzing, compiling and publishing data).\n\n== Population genetics (ecology) ==\nIn [[population genetics]] a sexual population is a set of organisms in which any pair of members can [[Breeding in the wild|breed]] together. This means that they can regularly exchange gametes to produce normally-fertile offspring, and such a breeding group is also known therefore as a ''Gamo deme''. This also implies that all members belong to the same species.<ref>{{cite book | last=Hartl | first=Daniel | title=Principles of Population Genetics | publisher=[[Sinauer Associates]] | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-87893-308-2 | page=95}}</ref>\nIf the Gamo deme is very large (theoretically, approaching infinity), and all gene alleles are uniformly distributed by the gametes within it, the Gamo deme is said to be panmictic. Under this state, [[allele]] ([[gamete]]) frequencies can be converted to genotype ([[zygote]]) frequencies by expanding an appropriate [[quadratic equation]], as shown by Sir [[Ronald Fisher]] in his establishment of quantitative genetics.<ref>{{cite book | last=Fisher | first=R. A. | title=The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-19-850440-5}}</ref>\n\nThis seldom occurs in nature: localization of gamete exchange \u2013 through dispersal limitations, preferential mating, cataclysm, or other cause \u2013 may lead to small actual Gamo demes which exchange gametes reasonably uniformly within themselves but are virtually separated from their neighboring Gamo demes. However, there may be low frequencies of exchange with these neighbors. This may be viewed as the breaking up of a large sexual population (panmictic) into smaller overlapping sexual populations. This failure of [[panmixia]] leads to two important changes in overall population structure: (1) the component Gamo demos vary (through gamete sampling) in their allele frequencies when compared with each other and with the theoretical panmictic original (this is known as dispersion, and its details can be estimated using expansion of an appropriate [[binomial equation]]); and (2) the level of homozygosity rises in the entire collection of Gamo demes. The overall rise in homozygosity is quantified by the inbreeding coefficient (''f'' or ''\u03c6''). Note that all homozygotes are increased in frequency \u2013 both the deleterious and the desirable. The mean phenotype of the Gamo demes collection is lower than that of the panmictic original \u2013 which is known as inbreeding depression. It is most important to note, however, that some dispersion lines will be superior to the panmictic original, while some will be about the same, and some will be inferior. The probabilities of each can be estimated from those binomial equations. In [[plant breeding|plant]] and [[animal breeding]], procedures have been developed which deliberately utilize the effects of dispersion (such as line breeding, pure-line breeding, backcrossing). It can be shown that dispersion-assisted selection leads to the greatest genetic advance (''\u0394G''=change in the phenotypic mean), and is much more powerful than selection acting without attendant dispersion.

Historically, human population control has been implemented with the goal of decreasing the rate of population growth. In the period from the 1950s to the 1980s, concerns about global population growth and its effects on poverty, [[environmental degradation]], and political stability led to efforts to reduce population growth rates. While population control can involve measures that improve people's lives by giving them greater control of their reproduction, a few programs, most notably the Chinese government's one-child per family policy, have resorted to coercive measures.\n\nIn the 1978s, tension grew between population control advocates and women's health activists who advanced women's [[reproductive rights]] as part of a [[human rights]]-based approach.<ref>{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/reproductiverigh0000knud/page/2 2] |url=https://archive.org/details/reproductiverigh0000knud |url-access=registration |quote=reproductive rights. }}</ref> Growing opposition to the narrow population control focus led to a significant change in population control policies in the early 1980s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/reproductiverigh0000knud/page/4 4]\u20135 |url=https://archive.org/details/reproductiverigh0000knud |url-access=registration |quote=reproductive rights. }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Community (ecology)]]\n* [[List of countries by population]]\n* [[Lists of organisms by population]]\n* [[Human overpopulation]]\n* [[Population geography]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.unfpa.org/ UNFPA, The United Nations Population Fund]\n* [https://www.un.org/esa/population/unpop.htm United Nations Population Division]\n* [http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Publications/IndexPublications.htm CICRED homepage] a platform for interaction between research centres and international organizations, such as the United Nations Population Division, [[UNFPA]], [[WHO]] and [[FAO]].\n* [http://www.prb.org/ Population Reference Bureau] analyzes demographic data and research providing objective, accurate, and up-to-date population information in accessible formats.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080205020959/http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/popclockworld.html Current World Population]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070301130913/http://www.necsp.org/ NECSP HomePage]\n* [http://www.overpopulation.info/ Overpopulation]\n* [http://www.populationworld.com/ Population World: Population of World].

The 3-inch trench mortar is a smooth-bore, muzzle-loading weapon for high angles of fire. Although it is called a 3-inch mortar, its bore is actually 3.2 inches or 81&nbsp;mm.<ref name=\"War Dept. Technical Manual TM9-2005\"/>\n\n==Design==\n\nFrederick Wilfred Scott Stokes \u2013 who later became Sir Wilfred Stokes KBE \u2013 designed the mortar in January 1915. The British Army was at the time trying to develop a weapon that would be a match for the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army's]] [[Minenwerfer]] mortar, which was in use on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].\n\nStokes's design was initially rejected in June 1915 because it was unable to use existing stocks of British mortar ammunition, and it took the intervention of [[David Lloyd George]] (at that time [[Minister of Munitions]]) and Lieutenant-Colonel [[J. C. Matheson]] of the [[Trench Warfare Supply Department]] (who reported to Lloyd George) to expedite manufacture of the Stokes mortar.\n\nThe Stokes mortar was a simple weapon, consisting of a [[smoothbore]] metal tube fixed to a base plate (to absorb recoil) with a lightweight [[bipod]] mount. When a mortar bomb was dropped into the tube, an impact sensitive [[Percussion cap#Primers|primer]] in the base of the bomb would make contact with a firing pin at the base of the tube, and ignite the propellant charge in the base, launching the bomb towards the target. The warhead itself was detonated by an impact fuse on reaching the target. \n\nThe barrel is a seamless drawn-steel tube necked down at the breech or base end. To the breech end is fitted a base cap, within which is secured a firing pin protruding into the barrel. The caps at each end of the bomb cylinder were 81&nbsp;mm diameter. The bomb was fitted with a modified [[hand grenade]] [[fuze]] on the front, with a perforated tube containing a propellant charge and an impact-sensitive cap at the rear.\n\nRange was determined by the amount of propellant charge used and the angle of the barrel. A basic propellant cartridge was used for all firing, and covered short ranges. Up to four additional \"rings\" of propellant were used for incrementally greater ranges. The four rings were supplied with the cartridge and gunners discarded the rings that were not needed.\n\nOne potential problem was the recoil, which was \"exceptionally severe, because the barrel is only about 3 times the weight of the projectile, instead of about one hundred times the weight as in artillery. Unless the legs are properly set up they are liable to injury\".<ref>Stokes's Trench Howitzer 3\" Mark I, page 15</ref>\n\nA modified version of the mortar, which fired a modern fin-stabilised streamlined projectile and had a booster charge for longer range, was developed after World War I;{{sfn|Ruffell}} this was in effect a new weapon.\n\n==History==\n\nThe mortar was in no sense a new weapon, although it had fallen out of general usage since the [[Napoleonic era]]. In fact, while the British and French worked on developing new mortars, they resorted to issuing century-old mortars for use in action.\n\nThe Stokes mortar remained in service into the Second World War, when it was superseded by the [[Ordnance ML 3 inch mortar]], and some remained in use by New Zealand forces until after the [[Second World War]].\n\nAs well as receiving a [[knighthood]]<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=30250 |supp=y| date=24 August 1917|page=8795}}</ref> for inventing the modern mortar, Stokes was given several forms of monetary reward by the [[Ministry of Munitions]] for his invention.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe French developed an improved version of the Stokes mortar as the [[Brandt Mle 27/31|Brandt Mle 27]], further refined as the [[Brandt Mle 27/31|Brandt Mle 31]]; this design was widely copied with and without license.<ref name=\"Bishop2002\">{{cite book|author=Chris Bishop|title=The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MuGsf0psjvcC&pg=PA202 |year=2002 |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-58663-762-0|page=202}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=483|title=Brandt mle 27 (Mortier Brandt de 81mm modele 27) Infantry Mortar - France|publisher=}}</ref> Despite their indigenous production, out of 8,000 81&nbsp;mm mortars in service with the French in 1939, 2,000 were of the original Mk.

The 3-inch trench mortar is a smooth-bore, muzzle-loading weapon for high angles of fire. Although it is called a 3-inch mortar, its bore is actually 3.2 inches or 81&nbsp;mm.<ref name=\"War Dept. Technical Manual TM9-2005\"/>\n\n==Design==\n\nFrederick Wilfred Scott Stokes \u2013 who later became Sir Wilfred Stokes KBE \u2013 designed the mortar in January 1915. The British Army was at the time trying to develop a weapon that would be a match for the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army's]] [[Minenwerfer]] mortar, which was in use on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].\n\nStokes's design was initially rejected in June 1915 because it was unable to use existing stocks of British mortar ammunition, and it took the intervention of [[David Lloyd George]] (at that time [[Minister of Munitions]]) and Lieutenant-Colonel [[J. C. Matheson]] of the [[Trench Warfare Supply Department]] (who reported to Lloyd George) to expedite manufacture of the Stokes mortar.\n\nThe Stokes mortar was a simple weapon, consisting of a [[smoothbore]] metal tube fixed to a base plate (to absorb recoil) with a lightweight [[bipod]] mount. When a mortar bomb was dropped into the tube, an impact sensitive [[Percussion cap#Primers|primer]] in the base of the bomb would make contact with a firing pin at the base of the tube, and ignite the propellant charge in the base, launching the bomb towards the target. The warhead itself was detonated by an impact fuse on reaching the target. \n\nThe barrel is a seamless drawn-steel tube necked down at the breech or base end. To the breech end is fitted a base cap, within which is secured a firing pin protruding into the barrel. The caps at each end of the bomb cylinder were 81&nbsp;mm diameter. The bomb was fitted with a modified [[hand grenade]] [[fuze]] on the front, with a perforated tube containing a propellant charge and an impact-sensitive cap at the rear.\n\nRange was determined by the amount of propellant charge used and the angle of the barrel. A basic propellant cartridge was used for all firing, and covered short ranges. Up to four additional \"rings\" of propellant were used for incrementally greater ranges. The four rings were supplied with the cartridge and gunners discarded the rings that were not needed.\n\nOne potential problem was the recoil, which was \"exceptionally severe, because the barrel is only about 3 times the weight of the projectile, instead of about one hundred times the weight as in artillery. Unless the legs are properly set up they are liable to injury\".<ref>Stokes's Trench Howitzer 3\" Mark I, page 15</ref>\n\nA modified version of the mortar, which fired a modern fin-stabilised streamlined projectile and had a booster charge for longer range, was developed after World War I;{{sfn|Ruffell}} this was in effect a new weapon.\n\n==History==\n\nThe mortar was in no sense a new weapon, although it had fallen out of general usage since the [[Napoleonic era]]. In fact, while the British and French worked on developing new mortars, they resorted to issuing century-old mortars for use in action.\n\nThe Stokes mortar remained in service into the Second World War, when it was superseded by the [[Ordnance ML 3 inch mortar]], and some remained in use by New Zealand forces until after the [[Second World War]].\n\nAs well as receiving a [[knighthood]]<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=30250 |supp=y| date=24 August 1917|page=8795}}</ref> for inventing the modern mortar, Stokes was given several forms of monetary reward by the [[Ministry of Munitions]] for his invention.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe French developed an improved version of the Stokes mortar as the [[Brandt Mle 27/31|Brandt Mle 27]], further refined as the [[Brandt Mle 27/31|Brandt Mle 31]]; this design was widely copied with and without license.<ref name=\"Bishop2002\">{{cite book|author=Chris Bishop|title=The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MuGsf0psjvcC&pg=PA202 |year=2002 |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-58663-762-0|page=202}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=483|title=Brandt mle 27 (Mortier Brandt de 81mm modele 27) Infantry Mortar - France|publisher=}}</ref> Despite their indigenous production, out of 8,000 81&nbsp;mm mortars in service with the French in 1939, 2,000 were of the original Mk.
