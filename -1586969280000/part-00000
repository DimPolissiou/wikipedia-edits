In the reign of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabel II]] (1843\u20131868) regulation was introduced, firstly in cities, the ''Disposiciones de Zaragoza'' (1845) and  the ''Reglamento para la represi\u00f3n de los excesos de la prostituci\u00f3n en Madrid'' (1847), followed by the 1848 Penal Code. \n(Guerena 2003, 2008)\n  \nIn 1935 during the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]] (1931\u201336) prostitution was prohibited. Once the [[Francoist Spain|Dictatorship]] (1939\u201375) was established, this law was repealed (1941). Spain became officially ''abolitionist'' on 18 June 1962, when the [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others|1949 United Nations (UN) Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]] was ratified by Spain, and the Decree 168 of 24 January 1963 modified the Penal Code (''C\u00f3digo Penal'') according to the Convention. In theory, this policy, in accordance with the Convention,  regarded sex workers (''trabajadores sexuales'') as victims of sexual exploitation and advocated punishment of their exploiters rather than the workers themselves, and refused to distinguish between voluntary and coerced sex work.<ref>Carracedo Bullido, Rosario (2001).

In practice however, prostitution was quietly ignored and tolerated.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/spain-the-world-capital-of-prostitution-2151581.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Alasdair | last=Fotheringham | title=Spain, the world capital of prostitution? | date=5 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nAlthough [[History of Spain (1975\u2013present)|democracy was restored in 1975]], it was not till the Penal Code revisions of 1995<ref>Peter Pierson.

In the reign of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabel II]] (1843\u20131868) regulation was introduced, firstly in cities, the ''Disposiciones de Zaragoza'' (1845) and  the ''Reglamento para la represi\u00f3n de los excesos de la prostituci\u00f3n en Madrid'' (1847), followed by the 1848 Penal Code. \n(Guerena 2003, 2008)\n  \nIn 1935 during the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]] (1931\u20136) prostitution was prohibited. Once the [[Francoist Spain|Dictatorship]] (1939\u201375) was established, this law was repealed (1941). Spain became officially ''abolitionist'' on 18 June 1962, when the [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others|1949 United Nations (UN) Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]] was ratified by Spain, and the Decree 168 of 24 January 1963 modified the Penal Code (''C\u00f3digo Penal'') according to the Convention. In theory, this policy, in accordance with the Convention,  regarded sex workers (''trabajadores sexuales'') as victims of sexual exploitation and advocated punishment of their exploiters rather than the workers themselves, and refused to distinguish between voluntary and coerced sex work.<ref>Carracedo Bullido, Rosario (2001).

Along with [[Sayyid Husayn Badkuba'i]], he was a student of two of the most famous masters of the time, Sayyid Abu'l-Hasan Jilwah and Aqa 'Ali Mudarris Zunuzi.\n\nIn his later years he would often hold study sessions with [[Henry Corbin]] and [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], in which not only the classical texts of divine wisdom and [[gnosis]] were discussed, but also a whole cycle of what Nasr calls ''comparative gnosis'', in which in each session the sacred texts of one of the major religions, containing mystical and gnostic teachings, such as the [[Upanishads]], [[Tao Te Ching]], the [[Gospel of John]], were discussed and compared with [[Sufism]] and Islamic gnostic doctrines in general.\n\nTabataba'i, was a philosopher, a prolific writer, and an inspiring teacher to his students who devoted much of his life to Islamic studies. Many of his students were among the ideological founders of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]], namely [[Murtaza Motahhari|Morteza Motahhari]], [[Muhammad Beheshti]], and [[Mohammad Mofatteh]]. Others like [[Hossein Nasr]] and [[Hassan Hassanzadeh Amoli]] remained and continued their studies in the intellectual non-political sphere.\n\n==Published works==\n\nIt was in Najaf where Tabataba'i developed his major contributions in the fields of ''Tafsir'' (interpretation), philosophy, and history of the Shi'a faith. In philosophy the most important of his works is ''Usul-i falsafeh va ravesh-e-realism'' (The Principles of Philosophy and the Method of Realism), which has been published in five volumes with explanatory notes and the commentary of [[Morteza Motahhari]]. If [[Abdul Karim Haeri Yazdi|Ayatollah Haeri]] is considered the reviver of Qom's [[hawza]] in an organizational sense, Tabataba'i's contributions to the field of [[tafsir]], philosophy and mysticism represent the intellectual revitalization of the [[hawza]] with lasting implications for the curriculum.<ref name=\"scholar.google.com\"/>\n\nHis other major philosophical work is a voluminous commentary of ''Asf\u0101r al-'arba'eh'', the magnum opus of [[Mulla Sadra]] who was the last of the great Persian (Iranian) Muslim thinkers of the medieval age. Apart from these he also wrote extensively on philosophical topics. His humanist approach is underlined by his three books on: the nature of man - before the world, in this world, and after this world. His philosophy is focused upon the sociological treatment of human problems. His two other works, ''Bid\u0101yat al-hikmah'' and ''Nih\u0101yat al-hikmah'', are considered among works of high order in Islamic philosophy.\n\nSeveral treatises on the doctrines and history of the [[Shi'a]] remain from him as well.<ref name=\"scholar.google.com\"/> One of these comprises his clarifications and expositions about Shi'a faith in reply to the questions posed by the famous French orientalist [[Henry Corbin]]. Another of his books on this topic ''Shi'ah dar Islam'' was translated into English by [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] under the title ''[[Shi'a Islam (Book)|Shi'a Islam]]'', with the help of [[William Chittick]] as a project of [[Colgate University]].<ref name=\"scholar.google.com\"/> These books are claimed to serve as an excellent conduit by which popular misconceptions about the Shi'a faith may be removed further paving the way for a better ecumenical understanding amongst the various Muslim schools of thought.\n\nHis written books number forty-four titles overall; three of which are collections of his articles on various aspects of Islam and the Qur'an.\n\n===List of publications<ref name=\"scholar.google.com\"/>===\n*[[Shi'a Islam (Book)|Shi'a Islam]] ({{lang-fa|Shi\u2019ah dar Islam}})\n*[[The Principles of Philosophy and the Method of Realism]] ({{lang-fa|\u0627\u0635\u0648\u0644 \u0641\u0644\u0633\u0641\u0647 \u0648 \u0631\u0648\u0634 \u0631\u0626\u0627\u0644\u06cc\u0633\u0645}} ''Usul-i falsafeh va ravesh-i ri'alism'') in five volumes, with the commentary of [[Morteza Motahhari|Murtada Mutahhari]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tabataba'I|first1=Sayyid Muhammad Husayn|title=The Return to Being: A Translation of Risalat al-Walayah|date=2010|publisher=ICAS Press|isbn=9781904063360|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=98dheEvpv14C&lpg=PR7&pg=PR7|language=en}}</ref>\n* [[Glosses al-kifayah (book)|Glosses al-kifayah]] ({{lang-fa|Hashiyahi kifayah}}).

Others like [[Hossein Nasr]] and Hasanzadeh Amuli remained and continued their studies in the intellectual non-political sphere.\n\n==Published works==\n\nIt was in Najaf where Tabataba'i developed his major contributions in the fields of ''Tafsir'' (interpretation), philosophy, and history of the Shi'a faith. In philosophy the most important of his works is ''Usul-i falsafeh va ravesh-e-realism'' (The Principles of Philosophy and the Method of Realism), which has been published in five volumes with explanatory notes and the commentary of [[Morteza Motahhari]]. If [[Abdul Karim Haeri Yazdi|Ayatollah Haeri]] is considered the reviver of Qom's [[hawza]] in an organizational sense, Tabataba'i's contributions to the field of [[tafsir]], philosophy and mysticism represent the intellectual revitalization of the [[hawza]] with lasting implications for the curriculum.<ref name=\"scholar.google.com\"/>\n\nHis other major philosophical work is a voluminous commentary of ''Asf\u0101r al-'arba'eh'', the magnum opus of [[Mulla Sadra]] who was the last of the great Persian (Iranian) Muslim thinkers of the medieval age. Apart from these he also wrote extensively on philosophical topics. His humanist approach is underlined by his three books on: the nature of man - before the world, in this world, and after this world. His philosophy is focused upon the sociological treatment of human problems. His two other works, ''Bid\u0101yat al-hikmah'' and ''Nih\u0101yat al-hikmah'', are considered among works of high order in Islamic philosophy.\n\nSeveral treatises on the doctrines and history of the [[Shi'a]] remain from him as well.<ref name=\"scholar.google.com\"/> One of these comprises his clarifications and expositions about Shi'a faith in reply to the questions posed by the famous French orientalist [[Henry Corbin]]. Another of his books on this topic ''Shi'ah dar Islam'' was translated into English by [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] under the title ''[[Shi'a Islam (Book)|Shi'a Islam]]'', with the help of [[William Chittick]] as a project of [[Colgate University]].<ref name=\"scholar.google.com\"/> These books are claimed to serve as an excellent conduit by which popular misconceptions about the Shi'a faith may be removed further paving the way for a better ecumenical understanding amongst the various Muslim schools of thought.\n\nHis written books number forty-four titles overall; three of which are collections of his articles on various aspects of Islam and the Qur'an.\n\n===List of publications<ref name=\"scholar.google.com\"/>===\n*[[Shi'a Islam (Book)|Shi'a Islam]] ({{lang-fa|Shi\u2019ah dar Islam}})\n*[[The Principles of Philosophy and the Method of Realism]] ({{lang-fa|\u0627\u0635\u0648\u0644 \u0641\u0644\u0633\u0641\u0647 \u0648 \u0631\u0648\u0634 \u0631\u0626\u0627\u0644\u06cc\u0633\u0645}} ''Usul-i falsafeh va ravesh-i ri'alism'') in five volumes, with the commentary of [[Morteza Motahhari|Murtada Mutahhari]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tabataba'I|first1=Sayyid Muhammad Husayn|title=The Return to Being: A Translation of Risalat al-Walayah|date=2010|publisher=ICAS Press|isbn=9781904063360|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=98dheEvpv14C&lpg=PR7&pg=PR7|language=en}}</ref>\n* [[Glosses al-kifayah (book)|Glosses al-kifayah]] ({{lang-fa|Hashiyahi kifayah}}).

(His brother Rich became president of an industrial laundry and his brother Bill was a newspaper reporter for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and later for the ''Chicago Sun''.)\n\nHe began taking classes at the Art Institute of Chicago when he was eleven, and adopted the \"Herblock\" signature in high school.\n\nAfter graduating in 1927, he attended [[Lake Forest College]] for almost two years.\n\nLate in his second year there he was hired{{mdashb}}after submitting some cartoons he had done in high school and college for the ''Evanston News-Index''{{mdashb}}to replace the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]{{'}}'' departing editorial cartoonist. He never returned to school.\n\nBlock moved to Cleveland in 1933 to become the staff cartoonist for [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]], which distributed his cartoons nationally.\n\nHe won his first [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1942, then spent two years in the Army doing cartoons and press releases.\nUpon discharge Block became chief editorial cartoonist for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', where he worked until his death 55 years later.<ref name=\"harvey\" />\n\nBlock's cartoons were syndicated to newspapers around the world by [[Creators Syndicate]] from 1987 until his death in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|title = About Creators Syndicate|url = http://www.creators.com/about-creators.html|website = www.creators.com|accessdate = 2015-11-11|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151109034120/http://www.creators.com/about-creators.html|archive-date = 2015-11-09|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nHe never married, and, in the ''Post'''s employee index, his address was listed as simply \"''The Washington Post'' \".\n\n==Cartoons==\nHis first cartoon for the ''Chicago Daily News'' (April{{nbsp}}24, 1929)\nadvocated conservation of America's forests.\nHerblock said that his family was conservative and that his father voted for [[Herbert Hoover]] in 1928.\nBut with the onset of the Great Depression, he became a supporter of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the [[New Deal]].\nHe pointed out the dangers of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] aggression, the growing Nazi menace, and opposed American [[America First Committee|isolationists]].<ref name=\"harvey\" />\nWhile he criticized Stalin and other Communist figures, he also believed that the United States was overreacting to the danger of communism.\n\n[[File:Herblock1950.jpg|thumb|Herblock coined the term \"McCarthyism\" in this March{{nbsp}}29, 1950 cartoon.]]\nIn the early 1950s, Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] was a recurring target of Herblock's cartoons, one of which introduced the term ''[[McCarthyism]]''.\nHe won a second Pulitzer Prize in 1954.<ref name=\"harvey\" />\n''The Washington Post'' officially endorsed Eisenhower in the 1952 presidential election.\nBecause Herblock supported Adlai Stevenson, the ''Post'' pulled his cartoons, but restored them after a week.\nHe always insisted on total editorial independence, regardless of whether or not his cartoons agreed with the ''Post'''s stance on political issues.\nHe focused most of his attacks on those public figures in power, often on Republican figures, but Democrats who displeased him were not immune from criticism.\nAs an example&mdash;despite being an ardent admirer of Franklin Roosevelt&mdash;he found it necessary to attack the president's 1937 court-packing scheme.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Herblock criticized Eisenhower mainly for insufficient action on civil rights and for not curbing the abuses of Senator McCarthy.\nIn the following decade, he attacked the US war effort in Vietnam, causing President Johnson to drop his plans of awarding the cartoonist with a Presidential Medal of Freedom.\nThe cartoonist would eventually be awarded this honor by Bill Clinton in 1994.\n\n[[File:Sportsmen! Kids! Maniacs!.jpg|thumb|\"SPORTSMEN! KIDS! MANIACS!\" Cartoon about [[Gun ownership|gun ownership]] by Herblock]]\nSome of Herblock's finest cartoons were those attacking the [[Richard M. Nixon|Nixon Administration]] during the Watergate Scandal, winning him his third Pulitzer Prize in 1979.\nNixon canceled his subscription to the ''Post'' after Herblock drew him crawling out of an open sewer in 1954.\nHe had once used the same motif for Senator McCarthy.<ref name=\"harvey\" />\nHe also ended up on the president's infamous [[Nixon's Enemies List|enemies list]].\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, he satirized and criticized Presidents Reagan, George H.{{nbsp}}W. Bush, and Clinton in addition to taking on the issues of the day: Gun control; abortion; the influence of fundamentalist Christian groups on public policy; and the Dot Com bubble.\nThe tobacco industry was a favorite target of Herblock, who had smoked at one time.\nHe gave it up and had criticized cigarette companies even before that.\n\nStating that he never got tired of his work, Herblock continued as the 21st century began by lampooning newly elected president George W. Bush.\nHe died on October{{nbsp}}7, 2001, after a protracted bout of pneumonia six days short of what would have been his 92nd birthday.\nHis final cartoon appeared in ''The Washington Post'' on August{{nbsp}}26.\n\n==Honors==\nHerblock won three [[Pulitzer Prize]]s for editorial cartooning ([[1942 Pulitzer Prize|1942]], [[1954 Pulitzer Prize|1954]], [[1979 Pulitzer Prize|1979]]), shared a fourth Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for Public Service on Watergate, the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1994), the [[National Cartoonist Society]] Editorial Cartoon Award in 1957 and 1960, the [[Reuben Award]] in 1956, and the Gold Key Award (the National Cartoonists Society Hall of Fame) in 1979.\nIn 1986 he received the [[Elijah P.

He created the [[Seeds for Peace to the World Foundation]]. He has also created the concept of ''Urban Plastic-Aesthetic Interventions'' applied to monumental public sculptures.\n\n== Artistic biography ==\n\n=== Beginnings ===\n[[File:Terrracota.jpg|thumb|left|high relief murals clay baked at {{convert|1832|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in a gas. Popular arquitecture texture n\u00ba28]]\nFrom his very beginning (1987\u20131990) San Jos\u00e9 set off with the sole idea of working with light and shadows and also with textures. This idea lead him work exclusively with the yellowish clay of Castilla (center Spain) for years and to undertake high relief murals following a hyperrealist technique of great impact. The clay is baked at {{convert|1832|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in a gas oven with the carbonation technique.\n\nThe imprint of this earth can be noticed with all its characteristics in the work named ''Textures'', based on popular architectural elements, a subject that, being the foundation of his work. He becomes an expert in this field and that allows him to give lectures on the subject and to write a book commissioned by the Popular University of San Sebastian de los Reyes, [[Madrid]], titled: ''Strolling through The Community of Madrid. Popular Architecture''.\n\nThis book was unique in this field of literature because it drew attention to what elements, aesthetically speaking, were noteworthy for each type of place. The book gave some routes that allow the reader to explore and recognize these important samples of a village or region\u00b4s specific traditional culture, those aspects that for centuries have defined its peculiar urban appearance. This book sold out years ago.\n\n=== Evolution ===\n[[File:Tensiones02.jpg|thumb|Tree branches and strings sculpture]]\nA trip to [[Hamburg]] and Berlin in the beginning of the 90s marked a definite change in his work as he had the chance of meeting directly with works by [[Jean Arp]], [[Henry Moore]] and [[Alexander Calder|Calder]] which together with the impact of [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] watercolors, transformed in a drastic way his sculptures. He abandoned hyperrealism which was a characteristic of his work, to move to total abstraction. However, he kept his personal use of very elementary elements such as tree branches that have been pruned or very simple strings made of natural materials. This series was called the ''Tensions''. This took a decade to complete but surprisingly it was never exhibited to the public as most of the pieces were burnt in an unfortunate accident.\n\n=== Internacionalization ===\n[[File:Velero19.jpg|thumb|left|Carved wood, bamboo and raw pigments fabric sculpture.]]\n\nTwo major events in the artist's life took place in the year 2000.\nAn exhibition in [[Denia]], [[Alicante]] (Spain) of work done there, where he has been living for the last ten years. In this exhibition the ''M.Y.S. series, Movement and Solidity'', made completely in steel where color appears for the first time, together with the series ''Woman'' and ''Tensions'' made in carved wood and bronze or with tree branches and natural strings.\n\nAlso in this exhibition in an exclusive way, he showed the ''Picto'' series which are volumes, paintings made with a technique based on using colors as a solid material like pigments or other pastes. This creates micro-volumes where the pigment or color can appear to come from inside the picture, in its middle coats or at the surface generating millions of textures and volumes.\nIn the same year he was selected to take part in the International [[Biennial Exhibition of Contemporary Art]] in [[Florence]] where he showed his most avant-garde work.\n\nThe international reviews specialized in art was highly impress by his sculptures ''The Cloth Sailing Ships'' and reviews are written about his work in international art press, together with an invitation to represent Spain at the [[Triennial Exhibition of Contemporary Art]] in Paris. He is the sole Spanish artist to take part in it.\nHis sculptures are shown at the [[Great Arch of the Defense]] in Paris, (France).\n\n=== Recognition ===\n[[File:Pajarodefuego01.jpg|thumb|left|Steel color sculpture. 6.5&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3 x 2&nbsp;foot]]\nOur artist's life went through a change in the year 2006 when he was selected to take part in the ''Summer Exhibition'' of the [[Royal Academy]] in London where his works were shown side by side to [[Antoni Tapies]]. His sculpture ''Fire Bird'' had such an effect that the exhibition jury chose it as one of the event's most significant pieces and a special documentary was made of this exhibit by [[BBC]] London.\n\nFrom then on his work has been recognized in the United Kingdom. First he was chosen as a member of the [[Royal British Society of Sculptors]] in London and later, this prestigious institution, awarded him with the prize [[Sculpture Forecour]], he is the first Spaniard to receive it. From then on his works was exhibited all through ''United Kingdom'' In the year 2009 he was selected by the [[Spanish Embassy]] in London to represent Spain at the [[International Biennial of Architecture]] of London\n\nAt present he combines his production of big size sculptures with his activities in the [[Seeds for Peace to the World Foundation]]. One of his last works is the 40-foot-tall high sculpture ''Serenity Portal'' made in steel and placed in the city of [[Quer\u00e9taro]] in Mexico.\n\n[[File:Velerodefuego33.jpg|thumb|Colored Steel Sculpture de 6.5 x 6.5 x 5.25&nbsp;foot]]\n\n== International events ==\n* [[Biennial Exhibition of Contemporary Art]] in [[Florence]].

(he has been doing so for more than 25 years). He is the founder and teacher during 14 years at the Sculpture workshop run by Denia Council, Alicante, Spain. Based in this experience and his own anxiety he develops the Clay Healing Technique which allows the healing of human ailment that tend to accumulate inside us as \"Actives Memories\". This technique that basically works with the unconscious, has help him, after having use successfully it for two school terms at a Spanish state school, to create a programme to eradicate bullying at the schools. This programme is called \u201cSeeds for Peace\u201d and very quickly goes over the Atlantic ocean and is applied and known in Mexico where he begins the \"Seeds for Peace for the World\" foundation with the aim of to spread and popularize this programme all over the world through workshops, talks, seminars, taking part in Congress, etc.\n\nIn 2012 the first edition of the book \u201cSeeds for Peace\u201d was published.\nThe Art Healing Technique that allows you to pass from fear to curiosity.\nFrom violence to peace.\n\nThis book is the basic tool for the development of this programme. Nowadays a second edition is on sale.\nThe Foundation \"Seeds for Peace\" aims to teach for free teachers and artist this method so that can be used at schools and also through talks to help and teach the parents.

He created the [[Seeds for Peace to the World Foundation]]. He has also created the concept of ''Urban Plastic-Aesthetic Interventions'' applied to monumental public sculptures.\n\n== Artistic biography ==\n\n=== Beginnings ===\n[[File:Terrracota.jpg|thumb|left|high relief murals clay baked at {{convert|1832|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in a gas. Popular arquitecture texture n\u00ba28]]\nFrom his very beginning (1987\u20131990) San Jos\u00e9 set off with the sole idea of working with light and shadows and also with textures. This idea lead him work exclusively with the yellowish clay of Castilla (center Spain) for years and to undertake high relief murals following a hyperrealist technique of great impact. The clay is baked at {{convert|1832|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in a gas oven with the carbonation technique.\n\nThe imprint of this earth can be noticed with all its characteristics in the work named ''Textures'', based on popular architectural elements, a subject that, being the foundation of his work. He becomes an expert in this field and that allows him to give lectures on the subject and to write a book commissioned by the Popular University of San Sebastian de los Reyes, [[Madrid]], titled: ''Strolling through The Community of Madrid. Popular Architecture''.\n\nThis book was unique in this field of literature because it drew attention to what elements, aesthetically speaking, were noteworthy for each type of place. The book gave some routes that allow the reader to explore and recognize these important samples of a village or region\u00b4s specific traditional culture, those aspects that for centuries have defined its peculiar urban appearance. This book sold out years ago.\n\n=== Evolution ===\n[[File:Tensiones02.jpg|thumb|Tree branches and strings sculpture]]\nA trip to [[Hamburg]] and Berlin in the beginning of the 90s marked a definite change in his work as he had the chance of meeting directly with works by [[Jean Arp]], [[Henry Moore]] and [[Alexander Calder|Calder]] which together with the impact of [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] watercolors, transformed in a drastic way his sculptures. He abandoned hyperrealism which was a characteristic of his work, to move to total abstraction. However, he kept his personal use of very elementary elements such as tree branches that have been pruned or very simple strings made of natural materials. This series was called the ''Tensions''. This took a decade to complete but surprisingly it was never exhibited to the public as most of the pieces were burnt in an unfortunate accident.\n\n=== Internacionalization ===\n[[File:Velero19.jpg|thumb|left|Carved wood, bamboo and raw pigments fabric sculpture.]]\n\nTwo major events in the artist's life took place in the year 2000.\nAn exhibition in [[Denia]], [[Alicante]] (Spain) of work done there, where he has been living for the last ten years. In this exhibition the ''M.Y.S. series, Movement and Solidity'', made completely in steel where color appears for the first time, together with the series ''Woman'' and ''Tensions'' made in carved wood and bronze or with tree branches and natural strings.\n\nAlso in this exhibition in an exclusive way, he showed the ''Picto'' series which are volumes, paintings made with a technique based on using colors as a solid material like pigments or other pastes. This creates micro-volumes where the pigment or color can appear to come from inside the picture, in its middle coats or at the surface generating millions of textures and volumes.\nIn the same year he was selected to take part in the International [[Biennial Exhibition of Contemporary Art]] in [[Florence]] where he showed his most avant-garde work.\n\nThe international reviews specialized in art was highly impress by his sculptures ''The Cloth Sailing Ships'' and reviews are written about his work in international art press, together with an invitation to represent Spain at the [[Triennial Exhibition of Contemporary Art]] in Paris. He is the sole Spanish artist to take part in it.\nHis sculptures are shown at the [[Great Arch of the Defense]] in Paris, (France).\n\n=== Recognition ===\n[[File:Pajarodefuego01.jpg|thumb|left|Steel color sculpture. 6.5&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3 x 2&nbsp;foot]]\nOur artist's life went through a change in the year 2006 when he was selected to take part in the ''Summer Exhibition'' of the [[Royal Academy]] in London where his works were shown side by side to [[Antoni Tapies]]. His sculpture ''Fire Bird'' had such an effect that the exhibition jury chose it as one of the event's most significant pieces and a special documentary was made of this exhibit by [[BBC]] London.\n\nFrom then on his work has been recognized in the United Kingdom. First he was chosen as a member of the [[Royal British Society of Sculptors]] in London and later, this prestigious institution, awarded him with the prize [[Sculpture Forecour]], he is the first Spaniard to receive it. From then on his works was exhibited all through ''United Kingdom'' In the year 2009 he was selected by the [[Spanish Embassy]] in London to represent Spain at the [[International Biennial of Architecture]] of London\n\nAt present he combines his production of big size sculptures with his activities in the [[Seeds for Peace to the World Foundation]]. One of his last works is the 40-foot-tall high sculpture ''Serenity Portal'' made in steel and placed in the city of [[Quer\u00e9taro]] in Mexico.\n\n[[File:Velerodefuego33.jpg|thumb|Colored Steel Sculpture de 6.5 x 6.5 x 5.25&nbsp;foot]]\n\n== International events ==\n* [[Biennial Exhibition of Contemporary Art]] in [[Florence]].

(he has been doing so for more than 25 years). He is the founder and teacher during 14 years at the Sculpture workshop run by Denia Council, Alicante, Spain. Based in this experience and his own anxiety he develops the Clay Healing Technique which allows the healing of human ailment that tend to accumulate inside us as \"Actives Memories\". This technique that basically works with the unconscious, has help him, after having use successfully it for two school terms at a Spanish state school, to create a programme to eradicate bullying at the schools. This programme is called \u201cSeeds for Peace\u201d and very quickly goes over the Atlantic ocean and is applied and known in Mexico where he begins the \"Seeds for Peace for the World\" foundation with the aim of to spread and popularize this programme all over the world through workshops, talks, seminars, taking part in Congress, etc.\n\nIn 2012 the first edition of the book \u201cSeeds for Peace\u201d was published.\nThe Art Healing Technique that allows you to pass from fear to curiosity.\nFrom violence to peace.\n\nThis book is the basic tool for the development of this programme. Nowadays a second edition is on sale.\nThe Foundation \"Seeds for Peace\" aims to teach for free teachers and artist this method so that can be used at schools and also through talks to help and teach the parents. This method has proved to be very successful and efficient to eradicate this type of violence (bullying).\n\n== Published books ==\n* ''Paseando por la Comunidad de Madrid.

The southeastern suburbs are situated on the [[Selwyn fault]] which transects [[Mount Martha, Victoria|Mount Martha]] and [[Cranbourne, Victoria|Cranbourne]].\n\nMelbourne extends along the [[Yarra River]] towards the [[Yarra Valley]] and the [[Dandenong Ranges]] to the east.

In the west, it extends along the [[Maribyrnong River]] and its tributaries north towards [[Sunbury, Victoria|Sunbury]] and the foothills of the [[Shire of Macedon Ranges|Macedon Ranges]], and along the flat volcanic plain country towards [[Melton, Victoria|Melton]] in the west, [[Werribee]] at the foothills of the [[You Yangs]] [[granite]] ridge south west of the CBD.

This temperature differential is most pronounced in the spring and summer months and can cause strong [[cold front]]s to form. These cold fronts can be responsible for varied forms of severe weather from [[gale]]s to [[thunderstorm]]s and [[hail]], large temperature drops and heavy rain. Winters, however, are usually very stable, but rather damp and often cloudy.\n\nPort Phillip is often warmer than the surrounding oceans and/or the land mass, particularly in spring and autumn; this can set up a \"bay effect\" similar to the \"[[lake-effect snow|lake effect]]\" seen in colder climates where showers are intensified leeward of the bay. Relatively narrow streams of heavy showers can often affect the same places (usually the eastern suburbs) for an extended period, while the rest of Melbourne and surrounds stays dry. Overall, Melbourne is, owing to the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Otway Ranges]], nonetheless drier than average for southern Victoria. Within the city and surrounds, rainfall varies widely, from around {{convert|425|mm|in|0}} at [[Little River, Victoria|Little River]] to {{convert|1250|mm|in|0}} on the eastern fringe at [[Gembrook, Victoria|Gembrook]]. Melbourne receives 48.6 clear days annually.

These showers are often heavy and can include hail, squalls, and significant drops in temperature, but they often pass through very quickly with a rapid clearing trend to sunny and relatively calm weather and the temperature rising back to what it was before the shower. This can occur in the space of minutes and can be repeated many times a day, giving Melbourne a reputation for having \"four seasons in one day\",<ref name=autogenerated1>{{BoM Aust stats|site_ref=cw_086071|site_name=Melbourne Regional Office|accessdate=9 November 2010}}</ref> a phrase that is part of local [[popular culture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=269&pg=2325 |title=Welcome to Melbourne |publisher=City of Melbourne |accessdate=18 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719171215/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=269&pg=2325 |archivedate=19 July 2008 |df= }}</ref> The lowest temperature on record is {{convert|-2.8|C|F}}, on 21 July 1869.<ref name=\"snow\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/cdio/weatherData/av?p_nccObsCode=123&p_display_type=dailyDataFile&p_startYear=1869&p_c=-1481637067&p_stn_num=86071 |title=Bureau of Meteorology \u2013 Climate Data Online |accessdate=6 January 2015 }}</ref> The highest temperature recorded in Melbourne city was {{convert|46.4|C|F}}, on [[Black Saturday bushfires|7 February 2009]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_086071_All.shtml |title = Monthly climate statistics | publisher= Bureau of Meteorology | accessdate = 30 March 2012}}</ref> While snow is occasionally seen at higher elevations in the outskirts of the city, it has not been recorded in the Central Business District since 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp4.html|archive-url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp4.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 March 2009|title=BOM -

Geologically, it is built on the confluence of [[Quaternary]] lava flows to the west, [[Silurian]] [[mudstone]]s to the east, and [[Holocene]] sand accumulation to the southeast along [[Port Phillip]]. The southeastern suburbs are situated on the [[Selwyn fault]] which transects [[Mount Martha, Victoria|Mount Martha]] and [[Cranbourne, Victoria|Cranbourne]].\n\nMelbourne extends along the [[Yarra River]] towards the [[Yarra Valley]] and the [[Dandenong Ranges]] to the east. It extends northward through the undulating bushland valleys of the Yarra's tributaries\u2014[[Moonee Ponds Creek]] (toward Tullamarine Airport), [[Merri Creek]], [[Darebin Creek]] and [[Plenty River]]\u2014to the outer suburban growth corridors of [[Craigieburn, Victoria|Craigieburn]] and [[Whittlesea, Victoria|Whittlesea]].\n\nThe city reaches southeast through [[Dandenong, Victoria|Dandenong]] to the growth corridor of [[Pakenham, Victoria|Pakenham]] towards [[West Gippsland]], and southward through the [[Dandenong Creek]] valley and the city of [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]]. In the west, it extends along the [[Maribyrnong River]] and its tributaries north towards [[Sunbury, Victoria|Sunbury]] and the foothills of the [[Shire of Macedon Ranges|Macedon Ranges]], and along the flat volcanic plain country towards [[Melton, Victoria|Melton]] in the west, [[Werribee]] at the foothills of the [[You Yangs]] [[granite]] ridge south west of the CBD. The Little River, and the township of the same name, marks the border between Melbourne and neighbouring Geelong city.\n\nMelbourne's major bayside beaches are in the various suburbs along the shores of Port Phillip Bay, in areas like [[Port Melbourne]], [[Albert Park, Victoria|Albert Park]], [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]], [[Elwood, Victoria|Elwood]], [[Brighton, Victoria|Brighton]], [[Sandringham, Victoria|Sandringham]], [[Mentone, Victoria|Mentone]], [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]], [[Altona, Victoria|Altona]], [[Williamstown, Victoria|Williamstown]] and Werribee South.

This temperature differential is most pronounced in the spring and summer months and can cause strong [[cold front]]s to form. These cold fronts can be responsible for varied forms of severe weather from [[gale]]s to [[thunderstorm]]s and [[hail]], large temperature drops and heavy rain. Winters, however, are usually very stable, but rather damp and often cloudy.\n\nPort Phillip is often warmer than the surrounding oceans and/or the land mass, particularly in spring and autumn; this can set up a \"bay effect\" similar to the \"[[lake-effect snow|lake effect]]\" seen in colder climates where showers are intensified leeward of the bay. Relatively narrow streams of heavy showers can often affect the same places (usually the eastern suburbs) for an extended period, while the rest of Melbourne and surrounds stays dry. Overall, Melbourne is, owing to the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Otway Ranges]], nonetheless drier than average for southern Victoria. Within the city and surrounds, rainfall varies widely, from around {{convert|425|mm|in|0}} at [[Little River, Victoria|Little River]] to {{convert|1250|mm|in|0}} on the eastern fringe at [[Gembrook, Victoria|Gembrook]]. Melbourne receives 48.6 clear days annually.

These showers are often heavy and can include hail, squalls, and significant drops in temperature, but they often pass through very quickly with a rapid clearing trend to sunny and relatively calm weather and the temperature rising back to what it was before the shower. This can occur in the space of minutes and can be repeated many times a day, giving Melbourne a reputation for having \"four seasons in one day\",<ref name=autogenerated1>{{BoM Aust stats|site_ref=cw_086071|site_name=Melbourne Regional Office|accessdate=9 November 2010}}</ref> a phrase that is part of local [[popular culture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=269&pg=2325 |title=Welcome to Melbourne |publisher=City of Melbourne |accessdate=18 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719171215/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=269&pg=2325 |archivedate=19 July 2008 |df= }}</ref> The lowest temperature on record is {{convert|-2.8|C|F}}, on 21 July 1869.<ref name=\"snow\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/cdio/weatherData/av?p_nccObsCode=123&p_display_type=dailyDataFile&p_startYear=1869&p_c=-1481637067&p_stn_num=86071 |title=Bureau of Meteorology \u2013 Climate Data Online |accessdate=6 January 2015 }}</ref> The highest temperature recorded in Melbourne city was {{convert|46.4|C|F}}, on [[Black Saturday bushfires|7 February 2009]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_086071_All.shtml |title = Monthly climate statistics | publisher= Bureau of Meteorology | accessdate = 30 March 2012}}</ref> While snow is occasionally seen at higher elevations in the outskirts of the city, it has not been recorded in the Central Business District since 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp4.html|archive-url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp4.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 March 2009|title=BOM -

Kennedy has stated that tales of racial oppression and racial resistance were staples of conversation in his household. His father often spoke of watching [[Thurgood Marshall]] argue ''Rice vs. Elmore'', the case that invalidated the rule permitting only whites to vote in South Carolina's [[Democratic primary]].

Masvidal's early years were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar with [[Carlos Molina (guitarist)|Carlos Molina]], and in college, with jazz musician, Dave Weissbrot who inspired his love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to [[Buddhist philosophy]]. Masvidal developed an interest in mysticism and esoteric topics from a young age, becoming an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and eventually a practitioner of [[Buddhist meditation]] by his late 20s. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] In Miami, where the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups, Crypha and Seaweed. Masvidal's eclectic musical tastes ranging from classical to rock, jazz, fusion, and metal along with a innate passion for mysticism came to inform much of his work with Cynic and other projects. Masvidal wrote in detail about early life experiences in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Cynic (1988 - 1995, first hiatus) ===\n{{Main articles|Cynic (band)}}[[File:Cynic, Focus (1993).jpg|thumb|150x150px|Cynic, ''Focus'' (1993)|alt=]]\nMasvidal co-founded Cynic with drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in the late 80\u2019s, having released four demos from 1988-1991 that circulated in the underground tape trading community. Masvidal developed a reputation in the South Florida music scene for his musicianship and attention began to grow quickly around the band. In 1989, while still in high school, Masvidal toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]], but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular act, but Masvidal persevered with Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990. In 1991, Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert were recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''.

Masvidal's early years were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar with [[Carlos Molina (guitarist)|Carlos Molina]], and in college, with jazz musician, Dave Weissbrot who inspired his love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to [[Buddhist philosophy]]. Masvidal developed an interest in mysticism and esoteric topics from a young age, becoming an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and eventually a practitioner of [[Buddhist meditation]] by his late 20s. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] In Miami, where the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups, Crypha and Seaweed. Masvidal's eclectic musical tastes ranging from classical to rock, jazz, fusion, and metal along with a innate passion for mysticism came to inform much of his work with Cynic and other projects. Masvidal wrote in detail about early life experiences in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Cynic (1988 - 1995, first hiatus) ===\n{{Main articles|Cynic (band)}}[[File:Cynic, Focus (1993).jpg|thumb|150x150px|Cynic, ''Focus'' (1993)|alt=]]\nMasvidal co-founded Cynic with drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in the late 80\u2019s, having released four demos from 1988-1991 that circulated in the underground tape trading community. Masvidal developed a reputation in the South Florida music scene for his musicianship and attention began to grow quickly around the band. In 1989, while still in high school, Masvidal toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]], but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular act, but Masvidal persevered with Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990. In 1991, Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert were recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''.
