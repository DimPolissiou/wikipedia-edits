Brought up by single parent mother (Lilian Elizabeth) in war-damaged London Borough of Bermondsey. He won a state scholarship to [[Addey and Stanhope School|Addey and Stanhope Grammar School]], Deptford, London, where to-be drummers Trevor Tomkins and Jon Hiseman also studied. Music tuition, however, was limited to singing and general classical music appreciation. Enrolled in the Boy Scouts Association (19th Bermondsey Troop) to join marching band. As a teenager began to get involved with the emerging youth culture music; skiffle, before being introduced to a big jazz record collection of a school friend with rich parents. With a bonus from the florist, for whom Pr\u00e9vost worked part-time after school, purchased his first snare drum from the famed Len Hunt drum shop in Archer Street (part of London's theatre land).\n\nAfter leaving school at sixteen Pr\u00e9vost was employed in various clerical positions whilst continuing his musical interests. Although, by now immersed in the music of bebop, his playing technique was insufficient for purpose. New Orleans style jazz ('trad') offered scope for his growing musical prowess. He played in various bands mostly in the East End of London.\nIt was during a tenure with one of these bands he met trumpeter David Ware, who also shared a passion for the hard-bop jazz music. In their early twenties they later formed a modern jazz quintet which ultimately included Lou Gare, who had recently moved to London from Rugby and was a student at Ealing College of Art and a member of the Mike Westbrook Jazz Orchestra.\n\n==AMM==\n[[AMM (group)|AMM]] was co-founded in 1965 by Lou Gare, Eddie Pr\u00e9vost and [[Keith Rowe]]. They were shortly joined by Lawrence Sheaff. All had a jazz background. They were, however, soon augmented by composer [[Cornelius Cardew]]. Thereafter, Cardew, Gare, Pr\u00e9vost and Rowe remained as basis of the ensemble until the group fractured in 1972. Other more formally trained musicians were to enter the ranks of AMM after Cardew's departure. Those to make significant contributions were cellist Rohan de Saram and, in particular, pianist John Tilbury. The latter was a friend and early associate of Cardew and later became his biographer.\n\n===AMM philosophy===\nIn contrast to many other improvising ensembles, the core aesthetic of the ensemble is one of enquiry. There was no attempt to create a spontaneous music reflecting, or emulating, other forms. The AMM sound-world emerged from what Cardew referred to as \"searching for sounds\". For Pr\u00e9vost, the following would become the core formulation which he would explore during his subsequent musical career and explain and develop in various writings (see bibliography) and workshop activities.<ref>Cornelius Cardew, 'Towards an Ethic of Improvisation', Cornelius Cardew A Reader, (2006) p.127</ref>\n\n{{quote|We are \"searching\" for sounds and for the responses that attach to them, rather than thinking them up, preparing them and producing them.}}\n\nIn the 1980s, in response to various workshops and lectures, Pr\u00e9vost first formulated the twin analytical propositions of ''heurism'' and ''dialogue'' as defining concepts for an emergent musical philosophy, whilst acknowledging Cardew's construction (above). This line was explored and constantly redefined much through the London workshop experience, as his articles and his books show. (see below: The London Workshop). His 2011 book \u2014 ''The First Concert: an Adaptive Appraisal of a Meta Music'' \u2014 is described as a view \"mediated through the developing critical discourse of adaptionism; a perspective grounded in Darwinian conceptions of human nature. Music herein is examined for its cognitive and generative qualities to see how our evolved biological and emergent cultural legacy reflects our needs and dreams. This survey visits ethnomusicology, folk music, jazz, contemporary music and \"world music\" as well as focusing upon various forms of improvisation \u2014 observing their effect upon human relations and aspirations. However, there are also analytical and ultimately positive suggestions towards future metamusical practices. These mirror and potentially meet the aspirations of a growing community who wish to engage with the world \u2014 with all its history and chance conditionals \u2014 by applying a free-will in making music that is creative and collegiate.\" (back cover of ''First Concert'')\n\n===History with AMM===\nWhen, in the early 1970s, Cardew and Rowe began to devote their time and energy to espousing the political doctrine of an English Maoist party a fracture occurred in the ensemble leaving the rump of Lou Gare and Eddie Pr\u00e9vost, who continued in a duo form making various concerts and festival appearances and leaving a legacy of two recordings. At the end of the decade a rapprochement was attempted and for a short while the quartet began playing together again. It did not last. Lou Gare departed and moved from London to Devon. While Cardew's commitment to politics made his complete withdrawal inevitable. It was during this period Pr\u00e9vost took an Honours Degree at Hatfield Polytechnic, exploring and developing his interests in history (especially East Asian) and philosophy. Musically, this left Rowe and Pr\u00e9vost playing together. Their recording for German ECM label \"It had been an ordinary enough day in Pueblo, Colorado\" is the single example of their duet period. By the late 1970s a reawakened association with John Tilbury was cemented into his permanent place in AMM. He is featured on all subsequent AMM performances and recordings (as is Pr\u00e9vost). In 2002 a more lasting schism occurred leading to Rowe departing from AMM and leaving Tilbury to continue with Pr\u00e9vost.\n\n===Percussion===\nThe investigative dynamic of AMM leads a musician to seek out new material. It is the fabric and constitution of stuff that is considered as more important than any historical or cultural heritage. It is Pr\u00e9vost's constant exploration's that has produced the range of sounds associated with his work, particularly within AMM and its extension to the many workshop ensembles. This philosophy leads to what Seymour Wright has so aptly described as the \"awkward wealth\" of investigation.(citation) It is a position of constant examination and artistic redress.\n\n===Drumming===\nDrumming with AMM was principally replaced by discreet percussion work which by and large relied on sound and texture rather than rhythm. At the time of the Gare/Pr\u00e9vost period this position was reviewed. However, it was plain the AMM aesthetic, characteristic of the early formative period, was to have its effect. The \"searching\" method prevailed. And, whereas a saxophone and drums duet led to a more jazz-like expectation (amplified by Gare's reversion to a more rolling and modal post-Rollins kind of approach). Pr\u00e9vost's playing was noted to have acquired some unusual qualities. This lead one reviewer (Melody Maker) to remark in 1972: \"His free drumming flows superbly making use of his formidable technique. It's as though there has never been an Elvin Jones or Max Roach.\"\n\nDrumming however, was to take a back seat in Pr\u00e9vost's musical output as AMM developed and began to acquire and enhance its innovative reputation. And, apart from rare musical outings he did not commit himself, more fully, to the jazz drum kit again until 2007/08. Although, continuing to play percussion, a jazz-inflected project with Seymour Wright and Ross Lambert in an ensemble called SUM was the precursor of a period more devoted to drumming. Apart from various ad hoc ensembles, this led to various recordings including a series a CDs entitled ''Meetings with Remarkable Saxophonists''. At date this consists of four volumes featuring Evan Parker, John Butcher, Jason Yarde and Bertrand Denzler respectively.\n\n==The London workshop==\nOver the years Pr\u00e9vost has conducted many improvised music workshops. However, as a result of a seminar he conducted at The Guelph Jazz Festival, Canada in 1999, Pr\u00e9vost began to formulate a framework for a workshop based upon a more thorough working of AMM principles and practice. He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I had, of course, already had long previous experience of improvisation and \texperimental music mostly through my participation in AMM and working closely with the composers Cornelius Cardew and Christian Wolff. From this experience I had begun a working hypothesis in my book 'No Sound is Innocent'. However, there is always more to discover. On my long flight across the Atlantic, I intuited more could be found out. Not through introspective, if rational, thought alone but, through discovery or experimentation: praxis. It can, of course, be very discomforting to watch a proposition die in practise. No theory is worth its salt unless it is fully tested. The best ideas \u2013 this experience suggests \u2013 emerge through activity. Hence, the working premise of the improvisation workshop had to be based upon an emergent set of criteria constantly tested within the cauldron of experience. \n<br /><br />\nIn November 1999 I made it known that a free improvisation workshop would start weekly in a room at London\u2019s Community Music Centre, near London Bridge. Originally, under the auspices of the London Musicians\u2019 Collective, [...] these premises were found and minimal lines of communication to possible interested parties were \topened. The first Friday evening (not thought to be an \tauspicious evening of the week because people \u2018went out\u2019 to have a good time) duly arrived. The room was available precisely because no one ever hired it on a Friday! I waited. \nEdwin Pr\u00e9vost, The First Concert: an Adaptive Appraisal of a Meta Music, (2011)  p.115/6\n</blockquote>\n\nSince then the workshop has continued weekly. It has a strong collegiate atmosphere. Those who participate are themselves formulating and refining a programme of enquiry and empathy. The working premise is one of 'searching for sounds' (Cardew). The emphasis is upon discovery and not on presentation. It is a place to risk failure and develop an open and continuing processive relationship with the materials at hand and other people. As hoped and anticipated, Pr\u00e9vost's continual presence is no longer required. In his occasional absences senior colleagues (in particular Seymour Wright and Ross Lambert) more than adequately move the project along. To date there have been over five hundred people who have attended the weekly workshop in London, representing over twenty different nationalities. This activity is further augmented by occasional forums for discussion and London's Cafe OTO programmes ensembles drawn from the London workshop every month. There have also been occasional extended periods of collective workshop musical experimentation. And, in 2010 there was a residential workshop held in Mwnci Studios on the Dolwillym Estate, west Wales. (see various other texts: including Philip Clark's Wire piece)] There are now workshops based upon this general premise functioning in Hungary, Greece, Slovenia, Japan, Brazil and Mexico. Mostly started by alumni of the original workshop in London.\n\n==Intermediate and experimental compositions==\nCardew's 'Treatise' etc. Cardew's introduction to AMM in 1966 owes something to his search for musicians to perform his (then unfinished)193 pages long graphic score, 'Treatise'. The AMM musicians (at the time Lou Gare, Eddie Pr\u00e9vost, Keith Rowe and Lawrence Sheaff) seemed perfect candidates to embrace this bold work of imagination. And, with others (including later AMM member John Tilbury) all participated in the premier performance at the Commonwealth Institute on 8 April 1966 (check year!). But the initial impact of Cardew's induction into AMM was to bring a halt to his compositional aspirations. However, over the years since, AMM has had a long relationship with particular indeterminate and experimental works particularly those of Cardew \u2014 especially after his death in 1983. Most prominently 'Treatise'. Other favourites were 'Solo with Accompaniment',  'Autumn '60', Schooltime Compositions' and the text piece Cardew wrote particularly for AMM, 'The Tiger's Mind.' These pieces (which for a long time had been neglected within 'new' musical schedules), and occasionally others by Christian Wolff and John Cage, were sometimes played in conjunction with an AMM improvisation. Some concert promoters were, it seems, more interested in these pieces being played than the principal musical output of AMM. Hence, Pr\u00e9vost's ambivalence about the inclusion of such material in concert programmes. The creative search for primary performance material was diverted, in such works, in keeping with the demands of the notation or compositional scheme. This inevitably prevented the musician from (to use Cardew's own words) \"being at the heart of the experiment\". (Cardew, 'Towards an Ethic of Improvisation; CC R p.&nbsp;127).\n\n==Matchless Recordings and Publishing==\nIn 1979 Pr\u00e9vost began the recording imprint of Matchless Recordings and Publishing. Although there had been some interest by commercial labels to take on the new improvising music of the late 1960s onwards, it proved not to be satisfactory or long-lasting. Together with a number of similar initiatives, e.g. Incus Records in Britain and ICP (?) in the Netherlands, Pr\u00e9vost sought to take control of their own work. In the early years this was slow and painstaking work. Some years little was produced and few small sales accrued. Gradually however, Matchless recordings began to be the documenting and disseminating base for a developing body of work. Most of the AMM output is featured on Matchless and this has diversified (more so in recent years) to include other associated artists and ensembles.[see matchlessrecordings.com]\nIn 1995, following the same principal for internal control over the output, production and dissemination of material, the publishing imprint Copula was inaugurated. The first publication was Prevost's ''No Sound is Innocent''. Later followed by ''Minute Particulars'' in 2004. \n2006 saw the publication of ''Cornelius Cardew: A Reader'' (edited by Pr\u00e9vost) which was a collection of Cardew's published writings accompanied by commentaries by a number of musicians associated and inspired by Cardew. This volume was an essential companion to John Tilbury's comprehensive biography ''Cornelius Cardew: a life unfinished'' which was also published by Copula in 2008. The most recent book to appear on this imprint is Pr\u00e9vost's ''The First Concert: An Adaptive Appraisal of a Meta Music'' (2011).\n\nEddie Pr\u00e9vost is the cousin of the ex-docker shop-steward and left-wing political activist also named Eddie Prevost.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n==Discography==\n===As leader===\n* ''Now Here This Then'' (Spotlite, 1977)\n* ''Live Vol. 1'' (Matchless, 1978)\n* ''Live Vol. 2'' (Matchless, 1978)\n* ''Continuum'' (Matchless, 1985)\n* ''Flayed/Crux'' (Silent, 1987)\n* ''Premonitions'' with Free Jazz Quartet (Matchless, 1989)\n* ''Loci of Change'' (Matchless, 1996)\n* ''Touch'' (Matchless, 1997)\n* ''Concert'' with [[Veryan Weston]] (Matchless, 1999)\n* ''Material Consequences'' (Matchless, 2001)\n* ''The Virtue in If'' (Matchless, 2001)\n* ''Silver Pyramid'' with Music Now Ensemble (Matchless, 2001)\n* ''A Bright Nowhere'' with Conditions (Matchless, 2003)\n* ''The Blackbird's Whistle'' (Matchless, 2004)\n* ''So Are We, So Are We'' with Alan Wilkinson (Matchless, 2006)\n* ''Entelechy'' (Matchless, 2006)\n* ''Memories for the Future'' with Free Jazz Quartet (Matchless, 2009)\n* ''Penumbrae'' with Jennifer Allum (Matchless, 2011)\n* ''Visionary Fantasies'' with John Butcher (Matchless, 2018)\n* ''Matching Mix'' (Earshots!, 2019)\n\n'''With [[AMM (group)|AMM]]'''\n* ''Ammmusic'' (Elektra, 1967)\n* ''Live Electronic Music Improvised'' (Mainstream, 1970)\n* ''At the Roundhouse'' (Incus, 1972)\n* ''To Hear and Back Again'' (Matchless, 1978)\n* ''It Had Been An Ordinary Enough Day in Pueblo Colorado'' (Japo, 1980)\n* ''The Crypt'' (Matchless, 1981)\n* ''Generative Themes'' (Matchless, 1983)\n* ''The Inexhaustible Document'' (Matchless, 1987)\n* ''The Nameless Uncarved Block'' (Matchless, 1991)\n* ''Newfoundland'' (Matchless, 1993)\n* ''Laminal'' (Matchless, 1996)\n* ''From a Strange Place'' (P.S.F., 1996)\n* ''Live in Allentown USA'' (Matchless, 1996)\n* ''Before Driving to the Chapel We Took Coffee with Rick and Jennifer Reed'' (Matchless, 1997)\n* ''Combine and Laminates'' (Pogus, 1990)\n* ''Norwich'' (Matchless, 2005)\n* ''Apogee'' (Matchless, 2005)\n* ''Tunes without Measure or End'' (Matchless, 2001)\n* ''Fine'' (Matchless, 2001)\n* ''Formanex AMM Formanex'' (Fibrr, 2003)\n* ''Trinity'' (Matchless, 2008)\n* ''Uncovered Correspondence'' (Matchless, 2010)\n* ''Sounding Music'' (Matchless, 2010)\n* ''Two London Concerts'' (Matchless, 2012)\n* ''Place Sub.

Brought up by single parent mother (Lilian Elizabeth) in war-damaged London Borough of Bermondsey. He won a state scholarship to [[Addey and Stanhope School|Addey and Stanhope Grammar School]], Deptford, London, where to-be drummers Trevor Tomkins and Jon Hiseman also studied. Music tuition, however, was limited to singing and general classical music appreciation. Enrolled in the Boy Scouts Association (19th Bermondsey Troop) to join marching band. As a teenager began to get involved with the emerging youth culture music; skiffle, before being introduced to a big jazz record collection of a school friend with rich parents. With a bonus from the florist, for whom Pr\u00e9vost worked part-time after school, purchased his first snare drum from the famed Len Hunt drum shop in Archer Street (part of London's theatre land).\n\nAfter leaving school at sixteen Pr\u00e9vost was employed in various clerical positions whilst continuing his musical interests. Although, by now immersed in the music of bebop, his playing technique was insufficient for purpose. New Orleans style jazz ('trad') offered scope for his growing musical prowess. He played in various bands mostly in the East End of London.\nIt was during a tenure with one of these bands he met trumpeter David Ware, who also shared a passion for the hard-bop jazz music. In their early twenties they later formed a modern jazz quintet which ultimately included Lou Gare, who had recently moved to London from Rugby and was a student at Ealing College of Art and a member of the Mike Westbrook Jazz Orchestra.\n\n==AMM==\n[[AMM (group)|AMM]] was co-founded in 1965 by Lou Gare, Eddie Pr\u00e9vost and [[Keith Rowe]]. They were shortly joined by Lawrence Sheaff. All had a jazz background. They were, however, soon augmented by composer [[Cornelius Cardew]]. Thereafter, Cardew, Gare, Pr\u00e9vost and Rowe remained as basis of the ensemble until the group fractured in 1972. Other more formally trained musicians were to enter the ranks of AMM after Cardew's departure. Those to make significant contributions were cellist Rohan de Saram and, in particular, pianist John Tilbury. The latter was a friend and early associate of Cardew and later became his biographer.\n\n===AMM philosophy===\nIn contrast to many other improvising ensembles, the core aesthetic of the ensemble is one of enquiry. There was no attempt to create a spontaneous music reflecting, or emulating, other forms. The AMM sound-world emerged from what Cardew referred to as \"searching for sounds\". For Pr\u00e9vost, the following would become the core formulation which he would explore during his subsequent musical career and explain and develop in various writings (see bibliography) and workshop activities.<ref>Cornelius Cardew, 'Towards an Ethic of Improvisation', Cornelius Cardew A Reader, (2006) p.127</ref>\n\n{{quote|We are \"searching\" for sounds and for the responses that attach to them, rather than thinking them up, preparing them and producing them.}}\n\nIn the 1980s, in response to various workshops and lectures, Pr\u00e9vost first formulated the twin analytical propositions of ''heurism'' and ''dialogue'' as defining concepts for an emergent musical philosophy, whilst acknowledging Cardew's construction (above). This line was explored and constantly redefined much through the London workshop experience, as his articles and his books show. (see below: The London Workshop). His 2011 book \u2014 ''The First Concert: an Adaptive Appraisal of a Meta Music'' \u2014 is described as a view \"mediated through the developing critical discourse of adaptionism; a perspective grounded in Darwinian conceptions of human nature. Music herein is examined for its cognitive and generative qualities to see how our evolved biological and emergent cultural legacy reflects our needs and dreams. This survey visits ethnomusicology, folk music, jazz, contemporary music and \"world music\" as well as focusing upon various forms of improvisation \u2014 observing their effect upon human relations and aspirations. However, there are also analytical and ultimately positive suggestions towards future metamusical practices. These mirror and potentially meet the aspirations of a growing community who wish to engage with the world \u2014 with all its history and chance conditionals \u2014 by applying a free-will in making music that is creative and collegiate.\" (back cover of ''First Concert'')\n\n===History with AMM===\nWhen, in the early 1970s, Cardew and Rowe began to devote their time and energy to espousing the political doctrine of an English Maoist party a fracture occurred in the ensemble leaving the rump of Lou Gare and Eddie Pr\u00e9vost, who continued in a duo form making various concerts and festival appearances and leaving a legacy of two recordings. At the end of the decade a rapprochement was attempted and for a short while the quartet began playing together again. It did not last. Lou Gare departed and moved from London to Devon. While Cardew's commitment to politics made his complete withdrawal inevitable. It was during this period Pr\u00e9vost took an Honours Degree at Hatfield Polytechnic, exploring and developing his interests in history (especially East Asian) and philosophy. Musically, this left Rowe and Pr\u00e9vost playing together. Their recording for German ECM label \"It had been an ordinary enough day in Pueblo, Colorado\" is the single example of their duet period. By the late 1970s a reawakened association with John Tilbury was cemented into his permanent place in AMM. He is featured on all subsequent AMM performances and recordings (as is Pr\u00e9vost). In 2002 a more lasting schism occurred leading to Rowe departing from AMM and leaving Tilbury to continue with Pr\u00e9vost.\n\n===Percussion===\nThe investigative dynamic of AMM leads a musician to seek out new material. It is the fabric and constitution of stuff that is considered as more important than any historical or cultural heritage. It is Pr\u00e9vost's constant exploration's that has produced the range of sounds associated with his work, particularly within AMM and its extension to the many workshop ensembles. This philosophy leads to what Seymour Wright has so aptly described as the \"awkward wealth\" of investigation.(citation) It is a position of constant examination and artistic redress.\n\n===Drumming===\nDrumming with AMM was principally replaced by discreet percussion work which by and large relied on sound and texture rather than rhythm. At the time of the Gare/Pr\u00e9vost period this position was reviewed. However, it was plain the AMM aesthetic, characteristic of the early formative period, was to have its effect. The \"searching\" method prevailed. And, whereas a saxophone and drums duet led to a more jazz-like expectation (amplified by Gare's reversion to a more rolling and modal post-Rollins kind of approach). Pr\u00e9vost's playing was noted to have acquired some unusual qualities. This lead one reviewer (Melody Maker) to remark in 1972: \"His free drumming flows superbly making use of his formidable technique. It's as though there has never been an Elvin Jones or Max Roach.\"\n\nDrumming however, was to take a back seat in Pr\u00e9vost's musical output as AMM developed and began to acquire and enhance its innovative reputation. And, apart from rare musical outings he did not commit himself, more fully, to the jazz drum kit again until 2007/08. Although, continuing to play percussion, a jazz-inflected project with Seymour Wright and Ross Lambert in an ensemble called SUM was the precursor of a period more devoted to drumming. Apart from various ad hoc ensembles, this led to various recordings including a series a CDs entitled ''Meetings with Remarkable Saxophonists''. At date this consists of four volumes featuring Evan Parker, John Butcher, Jason Yarde and Bertrand Denzler respectively.\n\n==The London workshop==\nOver the years Pr\u00e9vost has conducted many improvised music workshops. However, as a result of a seminar he conducted at The Guelph Jazz Festival, Canada in 1999, Pr\u00e9vost began to formulate a framework for a workshop based upon a more thorough working of AMM principles and practice. He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I had, of course, already had long previous experience of improvisation and \texperimental music mostly through my participation in AMM and working closely with the composers Cornelius Cardew and Christian Wolff. From this experience I had begun a working hypothesis in my book 'No Sound is Innocent'. However, there is always more to discover. On my long flight across the Atlantic, I intuited more could be found out. Not through introspective, if rational, thought alone but, through discovery or experimentation: praxis. It can, of course, be very discomforting to watch a proposition die in practise. No theory is worth its salt unless it is fully tested. The best ideas \u2013 this experience suggests \u2013 emerge through activity. Hence, the working premise of the improvisation workshop had to be based upon an emergent set of criteria constantly tested within the cauldron of experience. \n<br /><br />\nIn November 1999 I made it known that a free improvisation workshop would start weekly in a room at London\u2019s Community Music Centre, near London Bridge. Originally, under the auspices of the London Musicians\u2019 Collective, [...] these premises were found and minimal lines of communication to possible interested parties were \topened. The first Friday evening (not thought to be an \tauspicious evening of the week because people \u2018went out\u2019 to have a good time) duly arrived. The room was available precisely because no one ever hired it on a Friday! I waited. \nEdwin Pr\u00e9vost, The First Concert: an Adaptive Appraisal of a Meta Music, (2011)  p.115/6\n</blockquote>\n\nSince then the workshop has continued weekly. It has a strong collegiate atmosphere. Those who participate are themselves formulating and refining a programme of enquiry and empathy. The working premise is one of 'searching for sounds' (Cardew). The emphasis is upon discovery and not on presentation. It is a place to risk failure and develop an open and continuing processive relationship with the materials at hand and other people. As hoped and anticipated, Pr\u00e9vost's continual presence is no longer required. In his occasional absences senior colleagues (in particular Seymour Wright and Ross Lambert) more than adequately move the project along. To date there have been over five hundred people who have attended the weekly workshop in London, representing over twenty different nationalities. This activity is further augmented by occasional forums for discussion and London's Cafe OTO programmes ensembles drawn from the London workshop every month. There have also been occasional extended periods of collective workshop musical experimentation. And, in 2010 there was a residential workshop held in Mwnci Studios on the Dolwillym Estate, west Wales. (see various other texts: including Philip Clark's Wire piece)] There are now workshops based upon this general premise functioning in Hungary, Greece, Slovenia, Japan, Brazil and Mexico. Mostly started by alumni of the original workshop in London.\n\n==Intermediate and experimental compositions==\nCardew's 'Treatise' etc. Cardew's introduction to AMM in 1966 owes something to his search for musicians to perform his (then unfinished)193 pages long graphic score, 'Treatise'. The AMM musicians (at the time Lou Gare, Eddie Pr\u00e9vost, Keith Rowe and Lawrence Sheaff) seemed perfect candidates to embrace this bold work of imagination. And, with others (including later AMM member John Tilbury) all participated in the premier performance at the Commonwealth Institute on 8 April 1966 (check year!). But the initial impact of Cardew's induction into AMM was to bring a halt to his compositional aspirations. However, over the years since, AMM has had a long relationship with particular indeterminate and experimental works particularly those of Cardew \u2014 especially after his death in 1983. Most prominently 'Treatise'. Other favourites were 'Solo with Accompaniment',  'Autumn '60', Schooltime Compositions' and the text piece Cardew wrote particularly for AMM, 'The Tiger's Mind.' These pieces (which for a long time had been neglected within 'new' musical schedules), and occasionally others by Christian Wolff and John Cage, were sometimes played in conjunction with an AMM improvisation. Some concert promoters were, it seems, more interested in these pieces being played than the principal musical output of AMM. Hence, Pr\u00e9vost's ambivalence about the inclusion of such material in concert programmes. The creative search for primary performance material was diverted, in such works, in keeping with the demands of the notation or compositional scheme. This inevitably prevented the musician from (to use Cardew's own words) \"being at the heart of the experiment\". (Cardew, 'Towards an Ethic of Improvisation; CC R p.&nbsp;127).\n\n==Matchless Recordings and Publishing==\nIn 1979 Pr\u00e9vost began the recording imprint of Matchless Recordings and Publishing. Although there had been some interest by commercial labels to take on the new improvising music of the late 1960s onwards, it proved not to be satisfactory or long-lasting. Together with a number of similar initiatives, e.g. Incus Records in Britain and ICP (?) in the Netherlands, Pr\u00e9vost sought to take control of their own work. In the early years this was slow and painstaking work. Some years little was produced and few small sales accrued. Gradually however, Matchless recordings began to be the documenting and disseminating base for a developing body of work. Most of the AMM output is featured on Matchless and this has diversified (more so in recent years) to include other associated artists and ensembles.[see matchlessrecordings.com]\nIn 1995, following the same principal for internal control over the output, production and dissemination of material, the publishing imprint Copula was inaugurated. The first publication was Prevost's ''No Sound is Innocent''. Later followed by ''Minute Particulars'' in 2004. \n2006 saw the publication of ''Cornelius Cardew: A Reader'' (edited by Pr\u00e9vost) which was a collection of Cardew's published writings accompanied by commentaries by a number of musicians associated and inspired by Cardew. This volume was an essential companion to John Tilbury's comprehensive biography ''Cornelius Cardew: a life unfinished'' which was also published by Copula in 2008. The most recent book to appear on this imprint is Pr\u00e9vost's ''The First Concert: An Adaptive Appraisal of a Meta Music'' (2011).\n\nEddie Pr\u00e9vost is the cousin of the ex-docker shop-steward and left-wing political activist also named Eddie Prevost.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n==Discography==\n===As leader===\n* ''Now Here This Then'' (Spotlite, 1977)\n* ''Live Vol. 1'' (Matchless, 1978)\n* ''Live Vol. 2'' (Matchless, 1978)\n* ''Continuum'' (Matchless, 1985)\n* ''Flayed/Crux'' (Silent, 1987)\n* ''Premonitions'' with Free Jazz Quartet (Matchless, 1989)\n* ''Loci of Change'' (Matchless, 1996)\n* ''Touch'' (Matchless, 1997)\n* ''Concert'' with [[Veryan Weston]] (Matchless, 1999)\n* ''Material Consequences'' (Matchless, 2001)\n* ''The Virtue in If'' (Matchless, 2001)\n* ''Silver Pyramid'' with Music Now Ensemble (Matchless, 2001)\n* ''A Bright Nowhere'' with Conditions (Matchless, 2003)\n* ''The Blackbird's Whistle'' (Matchless, 2004)\n* ''So Are We, So Are We'' with Alan Wilkinson (Matchless, 2006)\n* ''Entelechy'' (Matchless, 2006)\n* ''Memories for the Future'' with Free Jazz Quartet (Matchless, 2009)\n* ''Penumbrae'' with Jennifer Allum (Matchless, 2011)\n* ''Visionary Fantasies'' with John Butcher (Matchless, 2018)\n* ''Matching Mix'' (Earshots!, 2019)\n\n'''With [[AMM (group)|AMM]]'''\n* ''Ammmusic'' (Elektra, 1967)\n* ''Live Electronic Music Improvised'' (Mainstream, 1970)\n* ''At the Roundhouse'' (Incus, 1972)\n* ''To Hear and Back Again'' (Matchless, 1978)\n* ''It Had Been An Ordinary Enough Day in Pueblo Colorado'' (Japo, 1980)\n* ''The Crypt'' (Matchless, 1981)\n* ''Generative Themes'' (Matchless, 1983)\n* ''The Inexhaustible Document'' (Matchless, 1987)\n* ''The Nameless Uncarved Block'' (Matchless, 1991)\n* ''Newfoundland'' (Matchless, 1993)\n* ''Laminal'' (Matchless, 1996)\n* ''From a Strange Place'' (P.S.F., 1996)\n* ''Live in Allentown USA'' (Matchless, 1996)\n* ''Before Driving to the Chapel We Took Coffee with Rick and Jennifer Reed'' (Matchless, 1997)\n* ''Combine and Laminates'' (Pogus, 1990)\n* ''Norwich'' (Matchless, 2005)\n* ''Apogee'' (Matchless, 2005)\n* ''Tunes without Measure or End'' (Matchless, 2001)\n* ''Fine'' (Matchless, 2001)\n* ''Formanex AMM Formanex'' (Fibrr, 2003)\n* ''Trinity'' (Matchless, 2008)\n* ''Uncovered Correspondence'' (Matchless, 2010)\n* ''Sounding Music'' (Matchless, 2010)\n* ''Two London Concerts'' (Matchless, 2012)\n* ''Place Sub.

That same year he starred with [[Richard Burton]] in the film adaptation of ''[[Equus (film)|Equus]]''. The film was only a moderate box-office success, but earned Firth a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] and a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] award in the same category. Further film work quickly followed, most notably [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Tess (1979 film)|Tess]]'' (1979).\n\nIn May 1981, he appeared on Broadway again in [[Peter Shaffer]]'s ''[[Amadeus (play)|Amadeus]]'' as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], replacing [[Tim Curry]].

He starred in two [[Science fiction on television|science-fiction]] episodes of the BBC's ''[[Play for Today]]'' anthology series as the eponymous time-traveller in the romantic ''[[The Flipside of Dominick Hide]]'' (1980), and its sequel, ''Another Flip for Dominick'' (1982).

The DSA has its roots in the [[Socialist Party of America]] (SPA), whose most prominent leaders included [[Eugene V. Debs]], [[Norman Thomas]] and [[Michael Harrington]].<ref name=\"WNlTR\" /> In 1973, Harrington, the leader of a minority faction that had opposed the SPA's rightward shift and transformation into the [[Social Democrats, USA]] (SDUSA) during the party's 1972 national convention, formed the [[Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee]] (DSOC). The other faction that split following that convention was the [[Socialist Party USA]] (SPUSA), which remains an independent democratic socialist political party. The DSOC, in Harrington's words \"the remnant of a remnant\", soon became the largest democratic socialist group in the United States. In 1982, it merged with the [[New American Movement]] (NAM), a coalition of intellectuals with roots in the [[New Left]] movements of the 1960s and former members of socialist and communist parties of the [[Old Left]].<ref name=\"NYTimes\" />\n\nInitially, the organization consisted of approximately 5,000 ex-DSOC members and 1,000 ex-NAM members. Upon the founding of the DSA, Harrington and the [[Socialist feminism|socialist feminist]] author [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] were elected as co-chairs of the organization. The DSA does not run candidates on its own ballot line in elections, but instead \"fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.\" The organization has at times endorsed [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] electoral candidates\u2014notably [[Walter Mondale]], [[Jesse Jackson]], [[John Kerry]], [[Barack Obama]] and [[Bernie Sanders]]\u2014and the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] candidate [[Ralph Nader]].\n\n[[File:DSA Atlas.png|thumb|263x263px|[http://www.dsatlas.org/ Map of DSA chapters] as of January 2019]]\nThe DSA is the largest socialist organization in the United States in over a century.<ref name=\"north-texas-size-twitter\" /><ref name=\"the-kids-are-all-red\" /> As of September 2018, membership stood at 50,000<ref name=\"50k-members-twitter\" /> and the number of local chapters was 181.<ref name=\"embracing-label-nytimes\" /> {{as of|2017|December|}}, the median age of its membership was 33, compared to 68 in 2013.<ref name=\"Median age as of 2017\" /> In the [[2017 United States elections|2017 election]], fifteen candidates who were members of the DSA were elected to office in thirteen states, most notably [[Lee J. Carter]] in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]], adding to the twenty members already holding elected office nationwide.<ref name=\"MDV9Z\" /> In November 2018, two DSA members, [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]] and [[Rashida Tlaib]], were elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

At its start, the DSOC had 840 members, of whom 2% had served on its national board\u2014approximately 200 of whom previously held membership in the SDUSA or its predecessors (the [[Socialist Party of America#Max Shachtman, civil rights movement and the War on Poverty|Socialist Party\u2013Social Democratic Federation]], formerly part of the SPA) in 1973, when the SDUSA stated its membership at 1,800 according to a 1973 profile of Harrington.<ref name=\"Rbdbs\" />\n\n[[File:Democratic Socialists of America hand logo.svg|thumb|left|upright|Earlier iteration of the DSA logo]]\nThe red [[Rose (symbolism)|rose]] is part of the official logo of the DSA,<ref name=\"fjAuR\" /> having traditionally been a symbol of [[socialism]]<ref name=\"rose-emoji-mashable\" /> since the 1886 [[Haymarket Affair]] and the resulting [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] marches from the 19th century to the current day.<ref name=\"rose-and-fist-blog\" /> It was drawn from the logo of the DSOC, its precursor organization, and previously of the Socialist International, which shows a stylized fist clenching a red rose, the fist being substituted with a bi-racial [[handshake]] pertaining to the DSA's staunch anti-racism.<ref name=\"r8YTz\" /><ref name=\"where-we-stand-dsa\" />{{failed verification|date=April 2020}} The fist and rose logo had been originally designed by [[Didier Motchane]] and others for the new [[Socialist Party (France)|French Socialist Party]] founded in 1971<ref name=\"C4RUY\" /> and was later shared by socialist and labor political organizations worldwide.\n\nIn electoral politics, the DSA was very strongly associated with [[Michael Harrington]]'s position that \"the left wing of realism is found today in the Democratic Party\". In its early years, the DSA opposed [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidates by giving critical support to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nominees like [[Walter Mondale]] in 1984.<ref name=\"Davis\" /> In 1988, the DSA enthusiastically supported [[Jesse Jackson]]'s second presidential campaign.<ref name=\"JwDxg\" /> Since 1995, the DSA's position on [[Elections in the United States|American electoral politics]] has been that \"democratic socialists reject an either-or approach to electoral coalition building, focused solely on a new party or on realignment within the Democratic Party\".<ref name=\"sAAjr\" /> During the 1990s, the DSA gave the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]] an overall rating of C-, \"less than satisfactory\".<ref name=\"b8INp\" />\n\nThe DSA's elected leadership has often seen working within the Democratic Party as necessary rather than forming or support [[Third party (United States)|third parties]]. That said, the DSA is very critical of the corporate-funded Democratic Party leadership.<ref name=\"7z4rZ\" /> The organization has stated:<ref name=\"4RKOt\" /> {{quote|Much of progressive, independent political action will continue to occur in Democratic Party primaries in support of candidates who represent a broad progressive coalition. In such instances, democratic socialists will support coalitional campaigns based on labor, women, people of color and other potentially anti-corporate elements.\n\nElectoral tactics are only a means for democratic socialists; the building of a powerful anti-corporate coalition is the end.}}\n\n=== Electoral positions ===\nIn 2000, the DSA took no official position on the [[2000 United States presidential election|presidential election]], with several prominent DSA members backing [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]] while others supported [[Socialist Party USA]] candidate [[David McReynolds]] and others voting for Democratic nominee [[Al Gore]].<ref name=\"Elteren2011\" /> In 2004, the organization backed [[John Kerry]] after he won the Democratic nomination. In its official magazine, the DSA's [[Political Action Committee]] declared:<ref name=\"zx1N8\" /> <blockquote>While we have no illusions about how a Kerry administration would govern \u2014 absent mass pressure from below \u2014 and are not impressed with his delayed criticism of the war and his earlier commitments in favor of 'free trade,' we also realize that the Bush administration is as reactionary as Reagan's. A Kerry defeat would be taken not as a defeat of the US political center, which Kerry represents, but of the mainstream Left. As a result, it would embolden the Right and demoralize the Left (as well as trade unionists and people of color) as much as [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]'s 1984 defeat of [[Walter Mondale|Mondale]] did. On the other hand, a Kerry victory will let us press onward, with progressives aggressively pressuring an administration that owed its victory to democratic mobilization from below.</blockquote>\n\nThe only resolution on upcoming elections at the DSA's 2005 convention focused on [[Bernie Sanders]]'s independent campaign for the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in [[Vermont]].<ref name=\"caZng\" /> The organization's 2007 convention in Atlanta featured record-breaking attendance and more participation by the organization's youth wing. Sanders gave the keynote address.<ref name=\"UN5Dq\" />\n\nIn 2008, the DSA supported Democratic presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] in his race against Republican candidate [[John McCain]]. In an article written in the March 24 edition of ''[[The Nation]]'', senior DSA strategists [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] and Bill Fletcher Jr., along with [[Tom Hayden]] and [[Danny Glover]], announced the formation of Progressives for Obama.<ref name=\"k;;;abv\" /> In the article, the four issued a joint statement arguing that Obama was the most progressive viable Democratic presidential candidate since [[Robert F. Kennedy]] in 1968.<ref name=\"k;;;abv\" />\n\nFollowing Obama's election, many on the [[Right-wing politics|political right]]<ref name=\"yK8li\" /> began to allege that his administration's policies were \"socialistic\", a claim rejected by the DSA and the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] alike. The widespread use of the word \"socialism\" as a political [[epithet]] against the Obama administration by its opponents caused National Director [[Frank Llewellyn]] to declare that \"over the past 12 months, the Democratic Socialists of America has received more media attention than it has over the past 12 years\".<ref name=\"ui32s\" />\n\nFor the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]], the DSA endorsed Sanders as the favored presidential candidate. Sanders' candidacy prompted a surge in DSA membership among young voters.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Paz|first=Isabella Grull\u00f3n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/us/politics/young-democratic-socialists.html|title=Why Some Young Voters Are Choosing Democratic Socialism Over the Democratic Party|date=2019-10-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-21|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> While making it clear that Sanders' [[New Deal]]-inspired program did not fulfill the socialist aim of establishing social ownership of the economy, the DSA considered his campaign as a positive development in the context of contemporary American politics.<ref name=\"S1NCy\" /> The DSA noted the importance of his candidacy as a self-identified democratic socialist candidate as well as \"a lifelong champion of the public programs and democratic rights that empower working class people\".<ref name=\"dsausa.org\" /> The DSA managed the #WeNeedBernie campaign, an internally focused initiative directed towards mobilizing DSA supporters for Sanders.<ref name=\"dsausa.org\" /> After Sanders' defeat in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 Democratic primaries]], the DSA called for the defeat of Donald Trump, but it did not officially endorse Democratic nominee [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref name=\"1uCFu\" />\n\n=== 2017 off-year election gains ===\nIn the [[2017 United States elections|United States elections of 2017]], the DSA endorsed fifteen candidates for office, with the highest position gained being that of [[Lee Carter (politician)|Lee Carter]] in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]].<ref name=\"zRzXV\" /> DSA members won 15 electoral offices in thirteen states, bringing the total to thirty-five (the DSA, having changed its electoral strategy at its national convention, had anticipated picking up approximately five seats): [[city council]] seats in [[Pleasant Hill, Iowa]] ([[Ross Grooters]]), [[Billings, Montana]] ([[Denise Joy]]), [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] ([[Seema Singh Perez]]), [[Duluth, Minnesota]] ([[Joel Sipress]]) and [[Somerville, Massachusetts]] ([[JT Scott]] and [[Ben Ewen-Campen]]); and the seat in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] contested by Carter, among other offices.<ref name=\"The Democratic Socialists Scored Some Big Wins.

At least two of these are constitutionally required to be women and at least one a \"person of color\", with the National Director and the Youth Section Organizer also participating as ''ex officio'' members. This Steering Committee meets bi-monthly, either in person or by conference call.<ref name=\"ridvF\" />\n\n=== Party media ===\nThe DSA publishes ''Democratic Left'', a quarterly magazine of news and analysis. This publication continues in an uninterrupted run from the original ''Newsletter of the Democratic Left'' published by the DSOC (the DSA forerunner) since its establishment in 1973. In 2008, DSA members active in the American labor movement founded Talking Union, a blog that focuses on labor politics, working-class struggles and strategies.<ref name=\"TjltD\" />\n\nLeft-wing quarterly magazine ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' is also considered to be very close to the party, as its editor [[Bhaskar Sunkara]] is a DSA member; however, there is no official affiliations between the magazine and DSA.<ref name=\"mvO1A\" />\n\n=== Student section ===\n[[File:YDS logo.svg|thumb|upright|[[Young Democratic Socialists of America]] logo]]\nThe [[Young Democratic Socialists of America]] (YDSA) is the official student section of the DSA. The YDSA chapters and members are encouraged to pursue and promote a democratic socialist political education and participate in social justice activism, often taking part in anti-war, labor and student-issue marches and rallies. The YDSA publishes a newsletter called ''The Red Letter''<ref name=\"cwInh\" /> and until recently also a blog titled The Activist.<ref name=\"ajr3F\" /> The organization's national activities revolve around supporting the DSA campaigns and initiatives and organizing various student conferences, usually held in New York City. The YDSA is a full member of the [[International Union of Socialist Youth]] (IUSY).<ref name=\"BcHa0\" />\n\n=== National conventions ===\nThe highest decision-making authority of the organization is the organization's national conventions which are held biennially. DSA holds conventions every two years, with the last occurring in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]\n\n::\n\nA student and young adult outreach conference hosted by the YDSA took place on February 13\u201315, 2015 in [[Manhattan]].<ref name=\"tEwuX\" />\n\n== Political ideas of Michael Harrington ==\n{{American socialism|Active parties}}\nHarrington embraced a democratic interpretation of the writings of [[Karl Marx]] while rejecting the \"[[Actually existing socialism|actually existing]]\" systems of the [[Soviet Union]], [[China]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]]. In the 1980s, Harrington said:<ref name=\"michael-harrington-obit-nytimes\" /> <blockquote>Put it this way. Marx was a democrat with a small \"d\". The Democratic Socialists envision a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning [...] and racial equality. I share an immediate program with liberals in this country because the best liberalism leads toward socialism. [...] I want to be on the left wing of the possible.</blockquote>\n\nHarrington made it clear that even if the traditional [[Marxism|Marxist]] vision of a marketless, stateless society was not possible, he did not understand why this needed to \"result in the social consequence of some people eating while others starve\".<ref name=\"eWu4O\" />\n\nBefore the collapse of the Soviet Union, the DSA voiced opposition to that nation's bureaucratically managed economy and control over its [[satellite state]]s.<ref name=\"perestroika-nytimes\" /> The DSA welcomed [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reforms in the Soviet Union. Sociologist [[Bogdan Denitch]] wrote in the DSA's ''Democratic Left'' (quoted in 1989):<ref name=\"perestroika-nytimes\" /> <blockquote>The aim of democrats and socialists should be [...] to help the chances of successful reform in the Soviet bloc. [...] While supporting liberalization and economic reforms from above, socialists should be particularly active in contacting and encouraging the tender shoots of democracy from below.</blockquote>\n\nHarrington voiced admiration for [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social Democratic]] Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]'s ''[[Ostpolitik]]'', which sought to reduce antagonism between Western Europe and Soviet states.<ref name=\"the-other-american\" /> As co-chairman of the DSA, Michael Harrington wrote: <blockquote>[Willy Brandt] launched his famous ostpolitik (Eastern policy), and moved toward [[detente]] with the Soviets and Eastern Europeans\u2014a strategy that was to win him the Nobel Peace Prize. Disaster came in 1974. There was a spy scandal\u2014a member of Brandt's inner circle turned out to be an East German agent\u2014and the chancellor resigned his office.<ref name=\"willy-brandt-latimes\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== Social democracy and welfare ===\nOne older leaflet detailing the group's official ideas, \"What is Democratic Socialism? Questions and Answers from the Democratic Socialists of America\", states that \"no country has fully instituted democratic socialism\". Nonetheless, according to the DSA there are lessons to be learned from \"the [[Nordic model|comprehensive welfare state]] maintained by the Swedes, from Canada's [[Medicare (Canada)|national healthcare system]], France's [[Child care#France|nationwide childcare program]], and Nicaragua's [[Nicaraguan Literacy Campaign|literacy programs]]\".<ref name=\"whatis\" /> The \"tremendous prosperity and relative economic equality\" established by the social democratic parties of the countries of [[Scandinavia]] and parts of [[Western Europe]] are lauded.<ref name=\"whatis\" />\n\n== Policy and ideology ==\nDSA members have views ranging from [[eco-socialism]],<ref name=\"climate-caucus-dsa\" /> [[democratic socialism]],<ref name=\"What is Democratic Socialism?\" /> [[libertarian socialism]],<ref name=\"libsoc-caucus-dsa\" /> and [[communism]].<ref name=\"communist-caucus-dsa\" />\n\nThe DSA regards the abolition of capitalism and the realization of socialism as a gradual long-term goal, therefore the organization focuses its immediate political energies on reforms within capitalism that empower working people while decreasing the power of corporations:<ref name=\"about-dsa\" /><ref name=\"socialist-vs-demsoc-insider\" /><ref name=\"9-questions-vox\" /><ref name=\"rise-of-dsa-the-week\" /> \n\nA member of the [[Socialist International]] (SI) from its founding in 1982, the DSA voted to leave the SI in August 2017 over its acceptance of what the DSA perceived as [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic policies.<ref name=\"l456B\" />\n\n=== Socialism ===\nThe DSA characterizes its vision of socialism as an economic system based on maximum decentralization that can be supportive of a range of models for [[social ownership]], including [[Public enterprise|publicly owned enterprises]] and [[Cooperative|worker-owned cooperatives]]. The DSA rejects centralized economic planning in favor of a combination of democratic planning and market mechanisms:<ref name=\"government-own-everything-socialism\" /> Because the DSA does not believe capitalism and private corporations can be immediately replaced with socialism, it is favorable to using government regulations and organized labor to make private businesses more accountable to the public interest:<ref name=\"corporations-socialism\" /> \n=== Internationalism ===\nAt the 2017 DSA Convention, the group announced its withdrawal from the [[Socialist International]] (SI). The resolution passed states that the DSA will \"[build] direct relationships with socialist and left parties and social movements around the world that we can learn from and which share our values. [...] Our affiliation with the Socialist International hinders our ability to develop stronger relationships with parties and social movements that share our values and which, in many cases, are bitterly opposed to their country's SI affiliate(s)\".<ref name=\"d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net\" /><ref name=\"leftvoice.org\" /> It also passed a resolution which solidified the DSA's solidarity with the cause of the [[Palestinians|Palestinian people]] and with the movement of [[Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions]]: \"Democratic Socialists of America condemns all efforts to deny the right of Palestinians in the United States and their allies to free speech, assembly, and academic freedom\".<ref name=\"d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net\" /> The resolution further condemned [[Israel]]i actions, comparing those actions to [[apartheid]].<ref name=\"leftvoice.org\" />\n\nThe DSA has shown its solidarity with [[Ahed Tamimi]]. The organization called for immediate release from detention. The statement also reiterated the DSA's support for the liberation of the [[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] people.<ref name=\"ahed-tamimi\" />\n\nIn 2016, the DSA issued a statement of solidarity with [[Venezuela]]. The statement called the [[United States embargoes|sanctions placed on Venezuela]] by the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] unjust and illegal. It called for the United States to cease its interference in Venezuelan affairs, saying: \"We call on the President and Congress to reverse these actions and stop seeking to undermine the Venezuelan people and their legitimate, democratically elected government\".<ref name=\"ven\" />\n\nThe DSA opposes [[International military intervention against ISIL|United States intervention]] in the [[Syrian Civil War]]. A statement issued in April 2017 called the intervention by the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] both a violation of domestic and international law. In the same statement, the DSA called for protests of Trump's actions and for the lobbying of [[United States Congress|Congress]] to halt any further intervention.<ref name=\"syria-bombing\" />\n\nAt the 2019 DSA Convention, the group announced its support for [[open borders]].<ref name=\"deZI5\" />\n\n=== Anti-fascism ===\nThe DSA maintains itself as an [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organization.<ref name=\"giZwO\" /> Members have been present at various anti-fascist marches and protests, including counterprotests against the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville]], [[Virginia]], the [[Boston Free Speech Rally]] and many other right-wing rallies surrounding the [[removal of Confederate monuments and memorials]]. The DSA positions itself with other left-wing groups who fight fascism in the United States, including the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] and groups involved in the [[Antifa (United States)|antifa movement]].<ref name=\"dsausa.org1\" /> The organization also criticizes the [[police in the United States]] for their handling of anti-fascist activities and activities of such groups as [[Black Lives Matter]].<ref name=\"dsausa.org1\" />\n\nThe DSA connects this fight against fascist groups to its broader struggle against capitalism, saying on its website: \"We believe that the terror unleashed on our comrades can be defeated. We also believe that the wider system of racist oppression can be defeated, but only with the ending of the capitalist system which birthed it\".<ref name=\"dsausa.org1\" /> The organization believes in defending communities from [[neofascist]] violence and building a multi-racial working-class movement.<ref name=\"charlottesville-organizing\" /> This involves [[deplatforming]] [[reactionary]] and racist groups and events, believing that a [[united front]] of left-wing organizations needs to confront these forces wherever they appear.<ref name=\"Z9Prs\" />\n\n=== Labor movement and workers' rights ===\nThe DSA has long been a supporter and defender of the [[Labor history of the United States|labor movement in the United States]] and has also argued for the increase of international worker solidarity.<ref name=\"dsausa.org22\" /> The DSA believes in a livable [[minimum wage]] for all workers, but it notes that this fight only goes so far and is only the first step in building a more humane economic system: \"Ultimately the minimum wage only works for those lucky enough to find a job \u2013 even a low paying one \u2013 and it doesn't really \"work\" for them, because it doesn't come with health benefits, adequate schools, or enough money to set aside for retirement\".<ref name=\"0Utxz\" /> The DSA members have been supporters and active participants in fights to increase the minimum wage across the country, including the [[Fight for $15]] protests.<ref name=\"fast-food-wages\" /><ref name=\"Bup8i\" />\n\nThe DSA opposes [[right to work laws]], which are seen as an attack on the rights of workers and the historic advances or the labor movement.<ref name=\"dsausa.org4\" /> It is argued that the enactment of these laws reduces the efficacy of collective bargaining agreements, putting workers at a disadvantage.<ref name=\"dsausa.org4\" /> In a statement released in 2014, the organization said: \"Such \"right to work\" laws consciously aim to weaken union strength; they are the main reason why the \"right to work\" is, as Martin Luther King, Jr. put it, \"the right to work for less\".<ref name=\"dsausa.org4\" />\n\nThe DSA argues that financial elites have consciously fought to destroy union power in an effort to solidify the hegemony of markets and corporate power.<ref name=\"dsausa.org2\" /> The organization believes that for an equitable and sustainable economic system that the production of wealth should be under the democratic control of those [[Proletariat|who produce it]].<ref name=\"dsausa.org2\" /> The DSA also emphasizes the role played by immigrants, women, disabled workers, LGBTQIA+ and workers of color in the broader [[labor movement]], believing that all barriers between working people must be broken in order to help create and maintain a broad and unified labor movement.<ref name=\"dsausa.org3\" />\n\n=== LGBT rights ===\nThe DSA is committed to the rights of the [[LGBT]] community, connecting anti-gay prejudice to capitalist exploitation. This includes pushes for equal rights and protections for all those who identify as LGBTQIA+ as well as rights to housing, jobs, education, public accommodations and healthcare. The DSA recognizes that those who are most discriminated against based on identity are disproportionately women and people of color. The organization also seeks to ensure public schools are safe places for LGBTQIA+ students and that students should have total access to facilities that reflect their gender. The DSA supports the protection of [[same-sex marriages]], but it \"views marriage as only a first step in recognizing the diversity of human relationships\".<ref name=\"dsausa.org5\" />\n\n=== Socialist feminism ===\nThe DSA aligns itself with the [[Socialist feminism|socialist-feminist]] movement. The organization holds that capitalism is built on [[white supremacy]] as well as [[patriarchy|male supremacy]]. The DSA maintains that reproductive rights are central to the [[feminist movement]]. Connecting democratic socialism and socialist feminism, the DSA says \"that birth control and safe abortion should be provided as part of a comprehensive single-payer healthcare program\". Believing that electoral politics can only take socialist feminism so far, the organization also says that the emphasis must be on community-based grassroots movements. The DSA further says that socialist feminism must include the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community.<ref name=\"dsausa.org6\" />\n\n=== Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict ===\n{{POV section|talk=No_criticism,_bad_sources|date=April 2020}}\n{{see also|Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict}}\nThe DSA is opposed to [[Zionism]] and the current form of the [[State of Israel]]. Members view them as [[imperialist]] and a form of [[ethnostate]].<ref name=\"alternet_2017-08-09\" /><ref name=\"dailybeast_2018-12-02\" /> The DSA formerly supported Israel throughout much of its history, including socialist and progressive individuals and movements inside the state. In 2018 Jo-Ann Mort, former vice-chair of DSA, described the group as formerly having been \"the place to go on the left if you were a socialist and you were pro-Israel\".<ref name=\"dailybeast_2018-12-02\" /> ''[[Alternet]]'' noted that this has been a dividing issue, with older members \"tried to reconcile socialism with Zionism\" while younger members recognize the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] movement as a \"time-tested means of nonviolent protest\" and \"the most powerful force to combat Israeli apartheid in the 21st century\".<ref name=\"alternet_2017-08-09\" />\n\nOn August 5, 2017, members of the organization voted almost unanimously, by 90%, to pass a motion to formally endorse the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.<ref name=\"alternet_2017-08-09\" /><ref name=\"dailybeast_2018-12-02\" /> Jewish Solidarity Caucus, a subgroup formed by Jewish DSA members prior to the motion, stated in their founding declaration that \"Zionism cannot vanquish antisemitism\" and \"as socialists we detest all exclusivist nationalisms\".<ref name=\"dailybeast_2018-12-02\" /> At a convention in Chicago, a number of DSA members were recorded in a video posted to social media chanting \"[[From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free]]\", a [[Palestinian-nationalistic]] slogan interpreted as variously calling for the elimination of Israel within 1967 lines or for the end of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/democratic-socialists-of-america-launch-into-anti-israel-chant-at-convention/|title=Democratic Socialists of America launch into anti-Israel chant at convention|last=staff|first=T.

The DSA has its roots in the [[Socialist Party of America]] (SPA), whose most prominent leaders included [[Eugene V. Debs]], [[Norman Thomas]] and [[Michael Harrington]].<ref name=\"WNlTR\" /> In 1973, Harrington, the leader of a minority faction that had opposed the SPA's rightward shift and transformation into the [[Social Democrats, USA]] (SDUSA) during the party's 1972 national convention, formed the [[Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee]] (DSOC). The other faction that split following that convention was the [[Socialist Party USA]] (SPUSA), which remains an independent democratic socialist political party. The DSOC, in Harrington's words \"the remnant of a remnant\", soon became the largest democratic socialist group in the United States. In 1982, it merged with the [[New American Movement]] (NAM), a coalition of intellectuals with roots in the [[New Left]] movements of the 1960s and former members of socialist and communist parties of the [[Old Left]].<ref name=\"NYTimes\" />\n\nInitially, the organization consisted of approximately 5,000 ex-DSOC members and 1,000 ex-NAM members. Upon the founding of the DSA, Harrington and the [[Socialist feminism|socialist feminist]] author [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] were elected as co-chairs of the organization. The DSA does not run candidates on its own ballot line in elections, but instead \"fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.\" The organization has at times endorsed [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] electoral candidates\u2014notably [[Walter Mondale]], [[Jesse Jackson]], [[John Kerry]], [[Barack Obama]] and [[Bernie Sanders]]\u2014and the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] candidate [[Ralph Nader]].\n\n[[File:DSA Atlas.png|thumb|263x263px|[http://www.dsatlas.org/ Map of DSA chapters] as of January 2019]]\nThe DSA is the largest socialist organization in the United States in over a century.<ref name=\"north-texas-size-twitter\" /><ref name=\"the-kids-are-all-red\" /> As of September 2018, membership stood at 50,000<ref name=\"50k-members-twitter\" /> and the number of local chapters was 181.<ref name=\"embracing-label-nytimes\" /> {{as of|2017|December|}}, the median age of its membership was 33, compared to 68 in 2013.<ref name=\"Median age as of 2017\" /> In the [[2017 United States elections|2017 election]], fifteen candidates who were members of the DSA were elected to office in thirteen states, most notably [[Lee J. Carter]] in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]], adding to the twenty members already holding elected office nationwide.<ref name=\"MDV9Z\" /> In November 2018, two DSA members, [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]] and [[Rashida Tlaib]], were elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

At its start, the DSOC had 840 members, of whom 2% had served on its national board\u2014approximately 200 of whom previously held membership in the SDUSA or its predecessors (the [[Socialist Party of America#Max Shachtman, civil rights movement and the War on Poverty|Socialist Party\u2013Social Democratic Federation]], formerly part of the SPA) in 1973, when the SDUSA stated its membership at 1,800 according to a 1973 profile of Harrington.<ref name=\"Rbdbs\" />\n\n[[File:Democratic Socialists of America hand logo.svg|thumb|left|upright|Earlier iteration of the DSA logo]]\nThe red [[Rose (symbolism)|rose]] is part of the official logo of the DSA,<ref name=\"fjAuR\" /> having traditionally been a symbol of [[socialism]]<ref name=\"rose-emoji-mashable\" /> since the 1886 [[Haymarket Affair]] and the resulting [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] marches from the 19th century to the current day.<ref name=\"rose-and-fist-blog\" /> It was drawn from the logo of the DSOC, its precursor organization, and previously of the Socialist International, which shows a stylized fist clenching a red rose, the fist being substituted with a bi-racial [[handshake]] pertaining to the DSA's staunch anti-racism.<ref name=\"r8YTz\" /><ref name=\"where-we-stand-dsa\" />{{failed verification|date=April 2020}} The fist and rose logo had been originally designed by [[Didier Motchane]] and others for the new [[Socialist Party (France)|French Socialist Party]] founded in 1971<ref name=\"C4RUY\" /> and was later shared by socialist and labor political organizations worldwide.\n\nIn electoral politics, the DSA was very strongly associated with [[Michael Harrington]]'s position that \"the left wing of realism is found today in the Democratic Party\". In its early years, the DSA opposed [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidates by giving critical support to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nominees like [[Walter Mondale]] in 1984.<ref name=\"Davis\" /> In 1988, the DSA enthusiastically supported [[Jesse Jackson]]'s second presidential campaign.<ref name=\"JwDxg\" /> Since 1995, the DSA's position on [[Elections in the United States|American electoral politics]] has been that \"democratic socialists reject an either-or approach to electoral coalition building, focused solely on a new party or on realignment within the Democratic Party\".<ref name=\"sAAjr\" /> During the 1990s, the DSA gave the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]] an overall rating of C-, \"less than satisfactory\".<ref name=\"b8INp\" />\n\nThe DSA's elected leadership has often seen working within the Democratic Party as necessary rather than forming or support [[Third party (United States)|third parties]]. That said, the DSA is very critical of the corporate-funded Democratic Party leadership.<ref name=\"7z4rZ\" /> The organization has stated:<ref name=\"4RKOt\" /> {{quote|Much of progressive, independent political action will continue to occur in Democratic Party primaries in support of candidates who represent a broad progressive coalition. In such instances, democratic socialists will support coalitional campaigns based on labor, women, people of color and other potentially anti-corporate elements.\n\nElectoral tactics are only a means for democratic socialists; the building of a powerful anti-corporate coalition is the end.}}\n\n=== Electoral positions ===\nIn 2000, the DSA took no official position on the [[2000 United States presidential election|presidential election]], with several prominent DSA members backing [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]] while others supported [[Socialist Party USA]] candidate [[David McReynolds]] and others voting for Democratic nominee [[Al Gore]].<ref name=\"Elteren2011\" /> In 2004, the organization backed [[John Kerry]] after he won the Democratic nomination. In its official magazine, the DSA's [[Political Action Committee]] declared:<ref name=\"zx1N8\" /> <blockquote>While we have no illusions about how a Kerry administration would govern \u2014 absent mass pressure from below \u2014 and are not impressed with his delayed criticism of the war and his earlier commitments in favor of 'free trade,' we also realize that the Bush administration is as reactionary as Reagan's. A Kerry defeat would be taken not as a defeat of the US political center, which Kerry represents, but of the mainstream Left. As a result, it would embolden the Right and demoralize the Left (as well as trade unionists and people of color) as much as [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]'s 1984 defeat of [[Walter Mondale|Mondale]] did. On the other hand, a Kerry victory will let us press onward, with progressives aggressively pressuring an administration that owed its victory to democratic mobilization from below.</blockquote>\n\nThe only resolution on upcoming elections at the DSA's 2005 convention focused on [[Bernie Sanders]]'s independent campaign for the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in [[Vermont]].<ref name=\"caZng\" /> The organization's 2007 convention in Atlanta featured record-breaking attendance and more participation by the organization's youth wing. Sanders gave the keynote address.<ref name=\"UN5Dq\" />\n\nIn 2008, the DSA supported Democratic presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] in his race against Republican candidate [[John McCain]]. In an article written in the March 24 edition of ''[[The Nation]]'', senior DSA strategists [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] and Bill Fletcher Jr., along with [[Tom Hayden]] and [[Danny Glover]], announced the formation of Progressives for Obama.<ref name=\"k;;;abv\" /> In the article, the four issued a joint statement arguing that Obama was the most progressive viable Democratic presidential candidate since [[Robert F. Kennedy]] in 1968.<ref name=\"k;;;abv\" />\n\nFollowing Obama's election, many on the [[Right-wing politics|political right]]<ref name=\"yK8li\" /> began to allege that his administration's policies were \"socialistic\", a claim rejected by the DSA and the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] alike. The widespread use of the word \"socialism\" as a political [[epithet]] against the Obama administration by its opponents caused National Director [[Frank Llewellyn]] to declare that \"over the past 12 months, the Democratic Socialists of America has received more media attention than it has over the past 12 years\".<ref name=\"ui32s\" />\n\nFor the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]], the DSA endorsed Sanders as the favored presidential candidate.

In 2017, the organization passed a resolution calling for the national office to provide the group's paid members with a copy of a financial report in non-convention years. A first such report covering the whole of 2017 and the first half of 2018 was published in August 2018.<ref name=\"2017Report\" /> As of June 2018, the organization claims over 40,000 members.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gstalter |first1=Morgan |title=Democratic Socialists of America see membership spike after Ocasio-Cortez win |url=https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/394679-democratic-socialists-of-america-see-membership-spike-after |website=The Hill |accessdate=April 19, 2020 |date=June 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\nThe DSA is organized at the local level and works with [[Trade union|labor unions]], community organizations and campus activists on issues of common interest. Nationwide campaigns are coordinated by the organization's national office in [[New York City]]. {{As of|2017}}, the DSA website listed 85 local chapters, two statewide chapters, 29 Young Democratic Socialist chapters and 63 organizing committees.<ref name=\"TD7nV\" /> {{as of|2018|April|}}, 181 chapters were extant.<ref name=\"embracing-label-nytimes\" />\n\nGovernance of the DSA is by the group's National Political Committee (NPC), which since 2001 has been a 16-person body.<ref name=\"iv7gF\" /> The DSA's constitution states that at least eight of the NPC's members shall be women and at least four members of \"racial or national\" minority groups.<ref name=\"INLAg\" /> A 17th vote is cast by the representative of the DSA's youth affiliate who elects one male and one female delegate who split the vote. The NPC meets four times a year.<ref name=\"E0HnO\" />\n\nThe NPC elects an inner committee of six, including five of its own members and one representative of the youth section, called the Steering Committee. At least two of these are constitutionally required to be women and at least one a \"person of color\", with the National Director and the Youth Section Organizer also participating as ''ex officio'' members. This Steering Committee meets bi-monthly, either in person or by conference call.<ref name=\"ridvF\" />\n\n=== Party media ===\nThe DSA publishes ''Democratic Left'', a quarterly magazine of news and analysis. This publication continues in an uninterrupted run from the original ''Newsletter of the Democratic Left'' published by the DSOC (the DSA forerunner) since its establishment in 1973. In 2008, DSA members active in the American labor movement founded Talking Union, a blog that focuses on labor politics, working-class struggles and strategies.<ref name=\"TjltD\" />\n\nLeft-wing quarterly magazine ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' is also considered to be very close to the party, as its editor [[Bhaskar Sunkara]] is a DSA member; however, there is no official affiliations between the magazine and DSA.<ref name=\"mvO1A\" />\n\n=== Student section ===\n[[File:YDS logo.svg|thumb|upright|[[Young Democratic Socialists of America]] logo]]\nThe [[Young Democratic Socialists of America]] (YDSA) is the official student section of the DSA. The YDSA chapters and members are encouraged to pursue and promote a democratic socialist political education and participate in social justice activism, often taking part in anti-war, labor and student-issue marches and rallies. The YDSA publishes a newsletter called ''The Red Letter''<ref name=\"cwInh\" /> and until recently also a blog titled The Activist.<ref name=\"ajr3F\" /> The organization's national activities revolve around supporting the DSA campaigns and initiatives and organizing various student conferences, usually held in New York City. The YDSA is a full member of the [[International Union of Socialist Youth]] (IUSY).<ref name=\"BcHa0\" />\n\n=== National conventions ===\nThe highest decision-making authority of the organization is the organization's national conventions which are held biennially. DSA holds conventions every two years, with the last occurring in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]\n\n::\n\nA student and young adult outreach conference hosted by the YDSA took place on February 13\u201315, 2015 in [[Manhattan]].<ref name=\"tEwuX\" />\n\n== Political ideas of Michael Harrington ==\n{{American socialism|Active parties}}\nHarrington embraced a democratic interpretation of the writings of [[Karl Marx]] while rejecting the \"[[Actually existing socialism|actually existing]]\" systems of the [[Soviet Union]], [[China]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]]. In the 1980s, Harrington said:<ref name=\"michael-harrington-obit-nytimes\" /> <blockquote>Put it this way. Marx was a democrat with a small \"d\". The Democratic Socialists envision a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning [...] and racial equality. I share an immediate program with liberals in this country because the best liberalism leads toward socialism. [...] I want to be on the left wing of the possible.</blockquote>\n\nHarrington made it clear that even if the traditional [[Marxism|Marxist]] vision of a marketless, stateless society was not possible, he did not understand why this needed to \"result in the social consequence of some people eating while others starve\".<ref name=\"eWu4O\" />\n\nBefore the collapse of the Soviet Union, the DSA voiced opposition to that nation's bureaucratically managed economy and control over its [[satellite state]]s.<ref name=\"perestroika-nytimes\" /> The DSA welcomed [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reforms in the Soviet Union. Sociologist [[Bogdan Denitch]] wrote in the DSA's ''Democratic Left'' (quoted in 1989):<ref name=\"perestroika-nytimes\" /> <blockquote>The aim of democrats and socialists should be [...] to help the chances of successful reform in the Soviet bloc. [...] While supporting liberalization and economic reforms from above, socialists should be particularly active in contacting and encouraging the tender shoots of democracy from below.</blockquote>\n\nHarrington voiced admiration for [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social Democratic]] Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]'s ''[[Ostpolitik]]'', which sought to reduce antagonism between Western Europe and Soviet states.<ref name=\"the-other-american\" /> As co-chairman of the DSA, Michael Harrington wrote: <blockquote>[Willy Brandt] launched his famous ostpolitik (Eastern policy), and moved toward [[detente]] with the Soviets and Eastern Europeans\u2014a strategy that was to win him the Nobel Peace Prize. Disaster came in 1974. There was a spy scandal\u2014a member of Brandt's inner circle turned out to be an East German agent\u2014and the chancellor resigned his office.<ref name=\"willy-brandt-latimes\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== Social democracy and welfare ===\nOne older leaflet detailing the group's official ideas, \"What is Democratic Socialism? Questions and Answers from the Democratic Socialists of America\", states that \"no country has fully instituted democratic socialism\". Nonetheless, according to the DSA there are lessons to be learned from \"the [[Nordic model|comprehensive welfare state]] maintained by the Swedes, from Canada's [[Medicare (Canada)|national healthcare system]], France's [[Child care#France|nationwide childcare program]], and Nicaragua's [[Nicaraguan Literacy Campaign|literacy programs]]\".<ref name=\"whatis\" /> The \"tremendous prosperity and relative economic equality\" established by the social democratic parties of the countries of [[Scandinavia]] and parts of [[Western Europe]] are lauded.<ref name=\"whatis\" />\n\n== Policy and ideology ==\nDSA members have views ranging from [[eco-socialism]],<ref name=\"climate-caucus-dsa\" /> [[democratic socialism]],<ref name=\"What is Democratic Socialism?\" /> [[libertarian socialism]],<ref name=\"libsoc-caucus-dsa\" /> and [[communism]].<ref name=\"communist-caucus-dsa\" />\n\nThe DSA regards the abolition of capitalism and the realization of socialism as a gradual long-term goal, therefore the organization focuses its immediate political energies on reforms within capitalism that empower working people while decreasing the power of corporations:<ref name=\"about-dsa\" /><ref name=\"socialist-vs-demsoc-insider\" /><ref name=\"9-questions-vox\" /><ref name=\"rise-of-dsa-the-week\" /> \n\nA member of the [[Socialist International]] (SI) from its founding in 1982, the DSA voted to leave the SI in August 2017 over its acceptance of what the DSA perceived as [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic policies.<ref name=\"l456B\" />\n\n=== Socialism ===\nThe DSA characterizes its vision of socialism as an economic system based on maximum decentralization that can be supportive of a range of models for [[social ownership]], including [[Public enterprise|publicly owned enterprises]] and [[Cooperative|worker-owned cooperatives]]. The DSA rejects centralized economic planning in favor of a combination of democratic planning and market mechanisms:<ref name=\"government-own-everything-socialism\" /> Because the DSA does not believe capitalism and private corporations can be immediately replaced with socialism, it is favorable to using government regulations and organized labor to make private businesses more accountable to the public interest:<ref name=\"corporations-socialism\" /> \n=== Internationalism ===\nAt the 2017 DSA Convention, the group announced its withdrawal from the [[Socialist International]] (SI). The resolution passed states that the DSA will \"[build] direct relationships with socialist and left parties and social movements around the world that we can learn from and which share our values. [...] Our affiliation with the Socialist International hinders our ability to develop stronger relationships with parties and social movements that share our values and which, in many cases, are bitterly opposed to their country's SI affiliate(s)\".<ref name=\"d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net\" /><ref name=\"leftvoice.org\" /> It also passed a resolution which solidified the DSA's solidarity with the cause of the [[Palestinians|Palestinian people]] and with the movement of [[Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions]]: \"Democratic Socialists of America condemns all efforts to deny the right of Palestinians in the United States and their allies to free speech, assembly, and academic freedom\".<ref name=\"d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net\" /> The resolution further condemned [[Israel]]i actions, comparing those actions to [[apartheid]].<ref name=\"leftvoice.org\" />\n\nThe DSA has shown its solidarity with [[Ahed Tamimi]]. The organization called for immediate release from detention. The statement also reiterated the DSA's support for the liberation of the [[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] people.<ref name=\"ahed-tamimi\" />\n\nIn 2016, the DSA issued a statement of solidarity with [[Venezuela]]. The statement called the [[United States embargoes|sanctions placed on Venezuela]] by the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] unjust and illegal. It called for the United States to cease its interference in Venezuelan affairs, saying: \"We call on the President and Congress to reverse these actions and stop seeking to undermine the Venezuelan people and their legitimate, democratically elected government\".<ref name=\"ven\" />\n\nThe DSA opposes [[International military intervention against ISIL|United States intervention]] in the [[Syrian Civil War]]. A statement issued in April 2017 called the intervention by the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] both a violation of domestic and international law. In the same statement, the DSA called for protests of Trump's actions and for the lobbying of [[United States Congress|Congress]] to halt any further intervention.<ref name=\"syria-bombing\" />\n\nAt the 2019 DSA Convention, the group announced its support for [[open borders]].<ref name=\"deZI5\" />\n\n=== Anti-fascism ===\nThe DSA maintains itself as an [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organization.<ref name=\"giZwO\" /> Members have been present at various anti-fascist marches and protests, including counterprotests against the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville]], [[Virginia]], the [[Boston Free Speech Rally]] and many other right-wing rallies surrounding the [[removal of Confederate monuments and memorials]]. The DSA positions itself with other left-wing groups who fight fascism in the United States, including the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] and groups involved in the [[Antifa (United States)|antifa movement]].<ref name=\"dsausa.org1\" /> The organization also criticizes the [[police in the United States]] for their handling of anti-fascist activities and activities of such groups as [[Black Lives Matter]].<ref name=\"dsausa.org1\" />\n\nThe DSA connects this fight against fascist groups to its broader struggle against capitalism, saying on its website: \"We believe that the terror unleashed on our comrades can be defeated. We also believe that the wider system of racist oppression can be defeated, but only with the ending of the capitalist system which birthed it\".<ref name=\"dsausa.org1\" /> The organization believes in defending communities from [[neofascist]] violence and building a multi-racial working-class movement.<ref name=\"charlottesville-organizing\" /> This involves [[deplatforming]] [[reactionary]] and racist groups and events, believing that a [[united front]] of left-wing organizations needs to confront these forces wherever they appear.<ref name=\"Z9Prs\" />\n\n=== Labor movement and workers' rights ===\nThe DSA has long been a supporter and defender of the [[Labor history of the United States|labor movement in the United States]] and has also argued for the increase of international worker solidarity.<ref name=\"dsausa.org22\" /> The DSA believes in a livable [[minimum wage]] for all workers, but it notes that this fight only goes so far and is only the first step in building a more humane economic system: \"Ultimately the minimum wage only works for those lucky enough to find a job \u2013 even a low paying one \u2013 and it doesn't really \"work\" for them, because it doesn't come with health benefits, adequate schools, or enough money to set aside for retirement\".<ref name=\"0Utxz\" /> The DSA members have been supporters and active participants in fights to increase the minimum wage across the country, including the [[Fight for $15]] protests.<ref name=\"fast-food-wages\" /><ref name=\"Bup8i\" />\n\nThe DSA opposes [[right to work laws]], which are seen as an attack on the rights of workers and the historic advances or the labor movement.<ref name=\"dsausa.org4\" /> It is argued that the enactment of these laws reduces the efficacy of collective bargaining agreements, putting workers at a disadvantage.<ref name=\"dsausa.org4\" /> In a statement released in 2014, the organization said: \"Such \"right to work\" laws consciously aim to weaken union strength; they are the main reason why the \"right to work\" is, as Martin Luther King, Jr. put it, \"the right to work for less\".<ref name=\"dsausa.org4\" />\n\nThe DSA argues that financial elites have consciously fought to destroy union power in an effort to solidify the hegemony of markets and corporate power.<ref name=\"dsausa.org2\" /> The organization believes that for an equitable and sustainable economic system that the production of wealth should be under the democratic control of those [[Proletariat|who produce it]].<ref name=\"dsausa.org2\" /> The DSA also emphasizes the role played by immigrants, women, disabled workers, LGBTQIA+ and workers of color in the broader [[labor movement]], believing that all barriers between working people must be broken in order to help create and maintain a broad and unified labor movement.<ref name=\"dsausa.org3\" />\n\n=== LGBT rights ===\nThe DSA is committed to the rights of the [[LGBT]] community, connecting anti-gay prejudice to capitalist exploitation. This includes pushes for equal rights and protections for all those who identify as LGBTQIA+ as well as rights to housing, jobs, education, public accommodations and healthcare. The DSA recognizes that those who are most discriminated against based on identity are disproportionately women and people of color. The organization also seeks to ensure public schools are safe places for LGBTQIA+ students and that students should have total access to facilities that reflect their gender. The DSA supports the protection of [[same-sex marriages]], but it \"views marriage as only a first step in recognizing the diversity of human relationships\".<ref name=\"dsausa.org5\" />\n\n=== Socialist feminism ===\nThe DSA aligns itself with the [[Socialist feminism|socialist-feminist]] movement. The organization holds that capitalism is built on [[white supremacy]] as well as [[patriarchy|male supremacy]]. The DSA maintains that reproductive rights are central to the [[feminist movement]]. Connecting democratic socialism and socialist feminism, the DSA says \"that birth control and safe abortion should be provided as part of a comprehensive single-payer healthcare program\". Believing that electoral politics can only take socialist feminism so far, the organization also says that the emphasis must be on community-based grassroots movements. The DSA further says that socialist feminism must include the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community.<ref name=\"dsausa.org6\" />\n\n=== Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict ===\n{{POV section|talk=No_criticism,_bad_sources|date=April 2020}}\n{{see also|Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict}}\nThe DSA is opposed to [[Zionism]] and the current form of the [[State of Israel]]. Members view them as [[imperialist]] and a form of [[ethnostate]].<ref name=\"alternet_2017-08-09\" /><ref name=\"dailybeast_2018-12-02\" /> The DSA formerly supported Israel throughout much of its history, including socialist and progressive individuals and movements inside the state. In 2018 Jo-Ann Mort, former vice-chair of DSA, described the group as formerly having been \"the place to go on the left if you were a socialist and you were pro-Israel\".<ref name=\"dailybeast_2018-12-02\" /> ''[[Alternet]]'' noted that this has been a dividing issue, with older members \"tried to reconcile socialism with Zionism\" while younger members recognize the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] movement as a \"time-tested means of nonviolent protest\" and \"the most powerful force to combat Israeli apartheid in the 21st century\".<ref name=\"alternet_2017-08-09\" />\n\nOn August 5, 2017, members of the organization voted almost unanimously, by 90%, to pass a motion to formally endorse the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.<ref name=\"alternet_2017-08-09\" /><ref name=\"dailybeast_2018-12-02\" /> Jewish Solidarity Caucus, a subgroup formed by Jewish DSA members prior to the motion, stated in their founding declaration that \"Zionism cannot vanquish antisemitism\" and \"as socialists we detest all exclusivist nationalisms\".<ref name=\"dailybeast_2018-12-02\" /> At a convention in Chicago, a number of DSA members were recorded in a video posted to social media chanting \u201c[[Palestinian nationalism|from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free]],\" a Palestinian-nationalistic slogan interpreted as variously calling for the elimination of Israel within 1967 lines or for the end of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/democratic-socialists-of-america-launch-into-anti-israel-chant-at-convention/|title=Democratic Socialists of America launch into anti-Israel chant at convention|last=staff|first=T.
