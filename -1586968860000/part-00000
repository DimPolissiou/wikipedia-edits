It involves any and all actions devoted to the prevention, [[mitigation]], or reversal of the processes of [[deterioration]] that affect such glass works and subsequently inhibit individuals' ability to access and appreciate them, as part of the world's collective cultural heritage.  It functions as a part of the larger practices of cultural heritage conservation ([[conservation-restoration]]) and [[architectural conservation]].\n\nStained glass is lauded as one of the most beautiful and compelling forms of architectural decoration; however, it is also one of the most vulnerable (Brown et al. 2002, xi).  The fabric of the glass itself, the paint or stain used to decorate it, and even the metal framework used to hold the design together are all at risk for deterioration, and will likely require conservation work to ensure their long-term survival. Historic [[glazing (window)|glazing]] is subject to damage caused by continued exposure to [[pollution]] and the elements, on top of that resulting from inherent problems, such as the innate fragility of glass and any potential chemical instability of the materials involved (Brown et al. 2002, xi; Rauch 2004).  Deterioration does not always occur gradually and may also occur suddenly and catastrophically, as the result of [[natural disasters]] (e.g. fire, extreme weather), accidents (e.g. improper handling, removal or treatment), or malicious damage (e.g. vandalism) (Brown et al. 2002, xi; Vogel et al. 2007).\n\nOwing to the delicate nature of the materials, and the incalculable historic and [[aesthetic]] value of stained glass work, any and all treatments should be planned and performed by professional conservators and craftspeople, who have been specially trained in the peculiarities of the medium.  While preservation is the shared responsibility of all involved, including visitors, caretakers, and other stakeholders, it is imperative that professionals are consulted to ensure the continued integrity of the physical materials and their associated significance.  For this reason, all projects should begin with a conservation plan that incorporates research in such topics as the history of the windows or building, the materials involved, and past alterations, as a key element of all conservation decisions.  The type of conservation treatment employed should reflect this research, as well as the needs of the building as a whole, and should ''always'' be documented for reference in the future (CVMA 2004).\n\nFor information on the creation, construction, and history of stained glass windows see [[Stained glass]].\n\n==Deterioration of stained glass==\n\nThe primary aim of conservation is to slow the rate of deterioration, caused by various factors, to the point where the loss of significance, such as historic information and/or aesthetic value can be kept to a minimum (Pye 2001, Ch. 5).  However, in the case of stained glass, these efforts are complicated by the nature of the medium itself.  This is because a stained-glass window is a 'complex object' in that it is made from more than one component material, each with its own inherent risks and conservation needs (Pye 2001, 80).  In addition to the most obvious component, glass, all windows will typically involve some sort paint or stain as decoration, metal strips, or 'cames' used to join the pieces of glass together, waterproofing materials, and fixing systems or frameworks used for additional support (Brown et al. 2002; Vogel et al. 2007). The condition of each component is important for the overall preservation of the window, as deterioration within one material can affect the others with varying degrees of severity.\n\n===Causes===\n\nThe vast majority of stained glass was originally created to function as part of the building envelope, separating the interior of the structure from exterior environmental conditions.  As a result, most historic glazing that has been left in situ is subjected to a constant onslaught of harmful conditions including (but not limited to): UV light from sunlight, extreme weather conditions, indoor and outdoor man-made pollution, and biological damage caused by pests such as pigeons, bats, and various [[micro-organisms]] (Rauch 2004, 3).  As a result, panels often become encrusted with thick layers of dirt that eventually become quite firmly affixed, and can even begin to intermingle with the underlying, corroded layers of paint (Rauch 2004, 3).  Environmental influences also play a role in the continuing deterioration of metal cames and frameworks, which can cause significant structural damage. In addition to these environmental stressors, further deterioration can also result from the myriad of other factors that influence the materials out of which the window is constructed, such as vibration from building use and the remains of previous treatments and repairs that have since deteriorated and increased the corrosion processes of other materials (Rauch 2004, 3).\n\n===Deterioration of the glass===\n[[File:Glass trinity church.JPG|thumb|200px|Figure 2 \u2013 Faded faces on a panel form Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon, UK.]]\nAlthough glass as a material is known for its chemical stability resistance to natural deterioration, impurities, and variations in glass composition can cause considerable chemical instability that may further destructive processes (Vogel et al. 2007, 7).  Glass is also susceptible to atmospheric pollution, and high levels of humidity or moisture over long periods of time, both of which can speed up the corrosion rate of chemically unstable glass.  Over time, corrosion, marked by pitting or pocking of the glass, can deepen and spread until the surface layer itself breaks apart, uncovering the vulnerable, damaged core, until it becomes opaque (Rauch 2004, 3).  This opacification occurs as water seeps through the subsequent cracks, causing the formation of opaque syngenite and gypsum crystals that block light from filtering through the previously translucent glass (Rauch 2004, 3).  As these crystals continue to grow, they pose an even greater danger to the glass, eventually breaking through the surface and dislodging the delicate paint layer, or even causing cracks (Rauch 2004, 4).  Glass plates can also darken or cloud as the result of the oxidisation of certain metals, such as manganese, which was a common addition to late medieval glass (Rauch 2004, 4).\n\n===Breakdown of paints, enamels, stains===\n\nAs previously mentioned, the paint/stain layer may suffer as the result of deterioration within the fabric of the glass itself; however, this fragile layer is at risk for other types of damage as well.  Painted surfaces that would have been applied to glass cold and fired on, are especially vulnerable to damage from condensation or weathering if they were fired improperly during the production process (Vogel 2007, 7).  This is often the case with the fading or disappearance of fine detail, such as faces, in figural stained glass art (fig. 2). Over time, enamels can begin to flake off of glass panels, and certain types or colours of stains can discolour with continued UV exposure, all of which significantly alters the aesthetic impact of the work as a whole (Brown et al. 2002, 18\u201319; Vogel et al. 2007, 7).\n\n===Structural deformation and deterioration===\n[[File:Clerestory trinity church.JPG|thumb|200px|Figure 3 \u2013 The leaded clerestory windows of Holy Trinity Church have been weakened by time and the elements.]]\nThe breakdown of the skeletal structure that holds the glass in place, such as damage to tracery and the corrosion of metal cames and fixing systems, often poses the greatest, imminent risk to stained glass work (Vogel et al. 2007, 7).  Although stone elements are not prone to excessive change due to environmental conditions, this is not the case with metals, which are much more likely to deteriorate from prolonged exposure to the elements.  For example, the cames that make up the matrix of a stained-glass window, for which lead and zinc were most commonly used, undergo quite a bit of thermal expansion and contraction, eventually resulting in metal fatigue, which in turn weakens the joints between the plates, causing whole panels to deform or simply fall apart (Vogel et al. 2007, 8).  Additionally, metal matrixes and frames may weaken with stress, such as that which has occurred at Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon, UK, where years of wind buffeting the leaded clerestory windows has endangered the structural integrity of not only the glazing but also, the upper portion of building itself (fig. 3) (Friends of Shakespeare's Church 2009).\n\n==Creating a conservation plan==\n\nIn many ways, proper conservation is as much about research and documentation as it is about 'hands-on' conservation treatments and restoration (Sloan 1993, 27).  The conservator must be familiar with not only the general materials with which he or she is working but also the details specific to the project at hand, in order to understand and address the needs of a particular window or building.  Using this knowledge, conservators can develop a conservation plan that can be used throughout the project, to ensure that all decisions are made with the aims of the project and the needs of the object in mind (CVMA 2004).\n\n===Basic conservation philosophy===\n\nIn J. Sloan's discussion of stained glass conservation in the United States, the author gives the following list of ethical and philosophical criteria to be applied to the conservation of stained glass (Sloan 1993, 13):\n<blockquote>\n# All materials and procedures should be reversible without affecting the piece ... .\n# All intervention must be the least required to achieve the desired end.\n# Original materials should be retained so far as is possible.\n# All conditions, procedures, materials and processes must be recorded.\n# The hand or style of the conservator should not be visible to the casual observer on the object.  However, all restoration should be discernable to future conservators.\n# The conservator is ethically bound to provide the highest quality restoration within his [or her] power without regard for his [or her] personal opinion of the value ... of the object.\n</blockquote>\n\nWhile this list is not exhaustive, it does illustrate the basic foundations upon which responsible conservation decisions should be made.  Of utmost importance in this list are the fundamental ideas of minimal intervention and reversibility of treatment, both of which are necessary to ensure that the overall integrity of the windows, as historic and artistically valuable objects, is not compromised.\n\n===Research===\n\nOwing to the incredible amount of chemical and methodological variability to be found when dealing with stained glass, research into the general production habits of pertinent regions or eras may provide clues that can help conservators understand the overall significance of the piece, anticipate what to expect from the materials, and determine how to proceed (Sloan 1993, 28; Vogel 2007, 5).  For example, a conservator working on a set of windows in the United States, will want to ascertain whether the glass was produced before, during, or after the mid-19th century, as changes to general glass composition were made during this time that could influence the types of impurities\u2014and subsequently, some of the deterioration\u2014to be expected (Vogel et al. 2007, 7).  This research phase should also include a full condition report on the current condition of the stained glass that includes a record of any and all evidence of past intervention or repair (CVMA 2004).\n\n===Decision making and implementation===\n\nDecisions should be made using the information gathered during research, and implemented by experienced conservators.  Caretakers and project managers should be responsible for screening conservators/studios effectively, while the conservators themselves are responsible for advocating on behalf of the stained glass during any negotiations.  As much as possible, benefit to the historic glazing should come before all other considerations (Vogel et al. 2007, 1).  At all stages, steps should be taken to ensure that the actions taken are in keeping with the aims of the conservation plan.\n\n===Documentation===\n\nProper documentation plays an extremely important role throughout this entire process and should be considered obligatory.  All aspects of this process including preliminary research, condition surveys, conservation plans, and all the methods and materials used throughout treatment should be duly recorded, and the documents be preserved and made accessible in the long-term for future reference (CVMA 2004).\n\n==Types of treatments==\n\nIn general it is best to keep interventive treatments at a minimum: minor signs of age are an integral part of the character of the structure and its history (Pye 2001, 96; Vogel et al. 2007, 9).  However, more serious damage that either detracts from the aesthetic or practical functions of the glass, or indicates active deterioration may require more extensive treatment.\n[[File:Glass notre dame paris.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Figure 4 \u2013 The linear shadow from a protective grill on a panel at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France.]]\n\n===Cleaning===\n\nCareful cleaning of stained glass can be a very effective means of improving its overall condition, because its appearance and function are so heavily dependent on its ability to transmit light.  Unfortunately, owing to the fragility of corroded glass, nearly all cleaning treatments can cause changes in the surface of the glass that can expedite corrosion rates, or damage delicate paint layers (Romich et al. 2000).  Thus, cleaning efforts should not necessarily be concerned with the complete removal of all encrustrations, but rather the careful thinning of these layers to a point where light can be transmitted through the glass at an acceptable level (Rauch 2004, 5).  The simplest cleaning can be performed using carefully applied deionised water, although other mechanical or chemical means are often necessary, and must always be done slowly, in a controlled and focused manner (Rauch 2004, 5\u20136; Vogel et al. 2007, 9\u201310).  Scalpels or a micro-jet process* can be used to gradually, mechanically thin out these encrustations layer by layer, in the lab.  Conversely, poultices or gel pads steeped in a non-ionic detergent or EDTA can be applied to the surface of the glass for long periods of time for \u201cdeep, focused cleaning\u201d (Rauch 2004, 6).  With any of these methods, care must be taken to ensure the stability of painted layers, before treatment can take place.  In the event that these layers appear particularly friable, it is necessary to clean the glass delicately with cotton swabs, and in more extreme cases, manually affix the original paint lines to the surface, under a microscope, by applying small tiny drops of resin at specific points (Rauch 2004, 6; Vogel et al. 2007, 10).  Care should be taken not to remove any later over-painting without due consideration, as such layers may have historic value, in their own right (Rauch 2004, 7).\n\n===Repairs and replacements===\n\nWithin conservation, repairs are meant to last, but should also be as reversible as possible, in keeping with the general ethical guidelines of modern conservation practice (Sloane 1993, 13).  In the context of stained glass, repairs can involve treatment of the glass itself, treatment of missing areas, or structural consolidation of the matrix or surrounding architectural fabric.\n\nBroken glass is typically repaired in one of three ways: copper foiling (thin copper tape that is applied to both sides of the break and then soldered); epoxy edge-gluing; and silicone edge-gluing.  Each of these has its own inherent benefits and problems.  For instance, copper foiling produces a strong, reversible, attractive repair, but is unsuitable for use with unstable glass because of the heat involved in the application process.  Epoxy edge-gluing on the other hand is strong and nearly invisible, but deteriorates in direct sunlight, while silicone edge-gluing dries clear and is easily reversible, but unfortunately refracts light differently from glass, making such repairs more readily apparent (Vogel et al. 2007, 12).\n\nMissing areas can be filled or replaced but should be done so with caution.  All additions must be marked as such, and documented.  Ultimately, \u201cit is nearly always better to use an imperfect original piece of glass than to replace it\u201d (Vogel et al. 2007, 12).  Modern replacement of glass with \u201cexact\u201d replicas is virtually impossible, and goes against conservation philosophy by potentially clouding viewers' perception of the original.  Instead it is preferable to use similarly coloured, but clearly differentiated glass in order to preserve the aesthetic effect of the stained glass without sacrificing the integrity of the original (Rauch 2004, 7; Vogel et al. 2007, 11).\n\nStructurally speaking it is most important to keep the frame intact and in good condition, to ensure the overall safety of the window (Vogel et al. 2007, 10).  That being said, the original materials that make up this matrix are also integral aspects of the historic value and artistic design of the panel and should be preserved.  Steps should always be taken to ensure that panels retain their current matrix whenever possible, rather than opting for replacement (CVMA 2004).\n\n===Protective glazing===\n\n[[File:Protective grill.JPG|thumb|200px|Figure 5 \u2013 A protective grill on the gothic-style windows of a chapel in London, UK.]]\nProtective glazing is one of the few ways conservators can attempt to preventively conserve stained glass in situ.  While this practice can offer many benefits, as with most other treatments, it is not without drawbacks.  Ideally, the installation of protective glazing can \u201crelieve the stained glass of its function as a weather shield [\u2026], protect it against mechanical and atmospheric damage, and [\u2026] prevent condensation on the surface of the stained glass,\u201d thus minimising the need for interventive conservation (CVMA 2004). Unfortunately, in practice this is not always the case, and it is well known that unsuitable, or improperly ventilated protective glazing can actually create an overly hot or humid microclimate around the historic glass that increases the rate of deterioration (Vogel et al. 2007, 13).  Alternatively, protective screens or grills can be installed on the exterior of windows to prevent mechanical damage like vandalism, however this can have a significant, negative impact on the aesthetic value of the windows from both the exterior and interior (figs. 4\u20135).\n\n==Other options and considerations==\n[[File:Conservation yorkminster.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Figure 6 \u2013 A view of the conservation-related scaffolding around the east end of York Minster, York, UK.]]\nIn some cases, a project may be so extensive that it requires the complete removal of a panel, or set of panels from public view, which in turn raises other considerations concerning public access.  An excellent example of such a case is the current, on-going project to conserve York Minster funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF), which raises the question: how do conservators accommodate the needs of the living, functioning Minster, without compromising conservation goals (fig. 6) (Rosewell 2008a)?  [[File:Windowreplica yorkminster.JPG|thumb|150px|Figure 7 \u2013 A digitally produced replica of the Great East Window of York Minster.]] For instance, upon the removal of the Great East Window from public view (for up to ten years), a solution was needed to combat the sudden gloom of the Minster's interior.  Ultimately, a remarkable life-sized, digital replica was produced to brighten the \u201cvisual 'black hole' that remains\u201d while conservation work is taking place, thus facilitating the aims of conservators by minimising the detrimental effects of losing the visual impact window on the interior (fig. 7) (Rosewell 2008b).  This is not the first time that York Minster has employed a variety of methods to maintain and increase public access while also facilitating the conservation of its stained glass legacy.  Currently, conserved sections of panels that have been permanently removed from their original context due to conservation concerns can be viewed on display near the choir (fig. 8).  Although it is rare that a perfect solution to these concerns can be found, it is a necessary part of conservation planning to take public interest and access into consideration.

Glass is also susceptible to atmospheric pollution, and high levels of humidity or moisture over long periods of time, both of which can speed up the corrosion rate of chemically unstable glass.

Glass plates can also darken or cloud as the result of the oxidisation of certain metals, such as manganese, which was a common addition to late medieval glass (Rauch 2004, 4).\n\n===Breakdown of paints, enamels, stains===\n\nAs previously mentioned, the paint/stain layer may suffer as the result of deterioration within the fabric of the glass itself; however, this fragile layer is at risk for other types of damage as well.  Painted surfaces that would have been applied to glass cold and fired on, are especially vulnerable to damage from condensation or weathering if they were fired improperly during the production process (Vogel 2007, 7).  This is often the case with the fading or disappearance of fine detail, such as faces, in figural stained glass art (fig. 2). Over time, enamels can begin to flake off of glass panels, and certain types or colours of stains can discolour with continued UV exposure, all of which significantly alters the aesthetic impact of the work as a whole (Brown et al. 2002, 18\u201319; Vogel et al. 2007, 7).\n\n===Structural deformation and deterioration===\n[[File:Clerestory trinity church.JPG|thumb|200px|Figure 3 \u2013 The leaded clerestory windows of Holy Trinity Church have been weakened by time and the elements.]]\nThe breakdown of the skeletal structure that holds the glass in place, such as damage to tracery and the corrosion of metal cames and fixing systems, often poses the greatest, imminent risk to stained glass work (Vogel et al. 2007, 7).  Although stone elements are not prone to excessive change due to environmental conditions, this is not the case with metals, which are much more likely to deteriorate from prolonged exposure to the elements.  For example, the cames that make up the matrix of a stained-glass window, for which lead and zinc were most commonly used, undergo quite a bit of thermal expansion and contraction, eventually resulting in metal fatigue, which in turn weakens the joints between the plates, causing whole panels to deform or simply fall apart (Vogel et al. 2007, 8).  Additionally, metal matrixes and frames may weaken with stress, such as that which has occurred at Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon, UK, where years of wind buffeting the leaded clerestory windows has endangered the structural integrity of not only the glazing, but also, the upper portion of building itself (fig. 3) (Friends of Shakespeare's Church 2009).\n\n==Creating a conservation plan==\n\nIn many ways, proper conservation is as much about research and documentation as it is about 'hands-on' conservation treatments and restoration (Sloan 1993, 27).  The conservator must be familiar with not only the general materials with which he or she is working, but also the details specific to the project at hand, in order to understand and address the needs of a particular window or building.  Using this knowledge, conservators can develop a conservation plan that can be used throughout the project, to ensure that all decisions are made with the aims of the project and the needs of the object in mind (CVMA 2004).\n\n===Basic conservation philosophy===\n\nIn J. Sloan's discussion of stained glass conservation in the United States, the author gives the following list of ethical and philosophical criteria to be applied to the conservation of stained glass (Sloan 1993, 13):\n<blockquote>\n# All materials and procedures should be reversible without affecting the piece ... .\n# All intervention must be the least required to achieve the desired end.\n# Original materials should be retained so far as is possible.\n# All conditions, procedures, materials and processes must be recorded.\n# The hand or style of the conservator should not be visible to the casual observer on the object.  However, all restoration should be discernable to future conservators.\n# The conservator is ethically bound to provide the highest quality restoration within his [or her] power without regard for his [or her] personal opinion of the value ... of the object.\n</blockquote>\n\nWhile this list is not exhaustive, it does illustrate the basic foundations upon which responsible conservation decisions should be made.  Of utmost importance in this list are the fundamental ideas of minimal intervention and reversibility of treatment, both of which are necessary to ensure that the overall integrity of the windows, as historic and artistically valuable objects, is not compromised.\n\n===Research===\n\nOwing to the incredible amount of chemical and methodological variability to be found when dealing with stained glass, research into the general production habits of pertinent regions or eras may provide clues that can help conservators understand the overall significance of the piece, anticipate what to expect from the materials, and determine how to proceed (Sloan 1993, 28; Vogel 2007, 5).  For example, a conservator working on a set of windows in the United States, will want to ascertain whether the glass was produced before, during, or after the mid-19th century, as changes to general glass composition were made during this time that could influence the types of impurities\u2014and subsequently, some of the deterioration\u2014to be expected (Vogel et al. 2007, 7).  This research phase should also include a full condition report on the current condition of the stained glass that includes a record of any and all evidence of past intervention or repair (CVMA 2004).\n\n===Decision making and implementation===\n\nDecisions should be made using the information gathered during research, and implemented by experienced conservators.  Caretakers and project managers should be responsible for screening conservators/studios effectively, while the conservators themselves are responsible for advocating on behalf of the stained glass during any negotiations.  As much as possible, benefit to the historic glazing should come before all other considerations (Vogel et al. 2007, 1).  At all stages, steps should be taken to ensure that the actions taken are in keeping with the aims of the conservation plan.\n\n===Documentation===\n\nProper documentation plays an extremely important role throughout this entire process and should be considered obligatory.  All aspects of this process including preliminary research, condition surveys, conservation plans, and all the methods and materials used throughout treatment should be duly recorded, and the documents be preserved and made accessible in the long-term for future reference (CVMA 2004).\n\n==Types of treatments==\n\nIn general it is best to keep interventive treatments at a minimum: minor signs of age are an integral part of the character of the structure and its history (Pye 2001, 96; Vogel et al. 2007, 9).  However, more serious damage that either detracts from the aesthetic or practical functions of the glass, or indicates active deterioration may require more extensive treatment.\n[[File:Glass notre dame paris.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Figure 4 \u2013 The linear shadow from a protective grill on a panel at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France.]]\n\n===Cleaning===\n\nCareful cleaning of stained glass can be a very effective means of improving its overall condition, because its appearance and function are so heavily dependent on its ability to transmit light.  Unfortunately, owing to the fragility of corroded glass, nearly all cleaning treatments can cause changes in the surface of the glass that can expedite corrosion rates, or damage delicate paint layers (Romich et al. 2000).  Thus, cleaning efforts should not necessarily be concerned with the complete removal of all encrustrations, but rather the careful thinning of these layers to a point where light can be transmitted through the glass at an acceptable level (Rauch 2004, 5).  The simplest cleaning can be performed using carefully applied deionised water, although other mechanical or chemical means are often necessary, and must always be done slowly, in a controlled and focused manner (Rauch 2004, 5\u20136; Vogel et al. 2007, 9\u201310).  Scalpels or a micro-jet process* can be used to gradually, mechanically thin out these encrustations layer by layer, in the lab.  Conversely, poultices or gel pads steeped in a non-ionic detergent or EDTA can be applied to the surface of the glass for long periods of time for \u201cdeep, focused cleaning\u201d (Rauch 2004, 6).  With any of these methods, care must be taken to ensure the stability of painted layers, before treatment can take place.  In the event that these layers appear particularly friable, it is necessary to clean the glass delicately with cotton swabs, and in more extreme cases, manually affix the original paint lines to the surface, under a microscope, by applying small tiny drops of resin at specific points (Rauch 2004, 6; Vogel et al. 2007, 10).  Care should be taken not to remove any later over-painting without due consideration, as such layers may have historic value, in their own right (Rauch 2004, 7).\n\n===Repairs and replacements===\n\nWithin conservation, repairs are meant to last, but should also be as reversible as possible, in keeping with the general ethical guidelines of modern conservation practice (Sloane 1993, 13).  In the context of stained glass, repairs can involve treatment of the glass itself, treatment of missing areas, or structural consolidation of the matrix or surrounding architectural fabric.\n\nBroken glass is typically repaired in one of three ways: copper foiling (thin copper tape that is applied to both sides of the break and then soldered); epoxy edge-gluing; and silicone edge-gluing.  Each of these has its own inherent benefits and problems.  For instance, copper foiling produces a strong, reversible, attractive repair, but is unsuitable for use with unstable glass because of the heat involved in the application process.  Epoxy edge-gluing on the other hand is strong and nearly invisible, but deteriorates in direct sunlight, while silicone edge-gluing dries clear and is easily reversible, but unfortunately refracts light differently from glass, making such repairs more readily apparent (Vogel et al. 2007, 12).\n\nMissing areas can be filled or replaced but should be done so with caution.  All additions must be marked as such, and documented.  Ultimately, \u201cit is nearly always better to use an imperfect original piece of glass than to replace it\u201d (Vogel et al. 2007, 12).  Modern replacement of glass with \u201cexact\u201d replicas is virtually impossible, and goes against conservation philosophy by potentially clouding viewers' perception of the original.  Instead it is preferable to use similarly coloured, but clearly differentiated glass in order to preserve the aesthetic effect of the stained glass without sacrificing the integrity of the original (Rauch 2004, 7; Vogel et al. 2007, 11).\n\nStructurally speaking it is most important to keep the frame intact and in good condition, to ensure the overall safety of the window (Vogel et al. 2007, 10).  That being said, the original materials that make up this matrix are also integral aspects of the historic value and artistic design of the panel and should be preserved.  Steps should always be taken to ensure that panels retain their current matrix whenever possible, rather than opting for replacement (CVMA 2004).\n\n===Protective glazing===\n\n[[File:Protective grill.JPG|thumb|200px|Figure 5 \u2013 A protective grill on the gothic-style windows of a chapel in London, UK.]]\nProtective glazing is one of the few ways conservators can attempt to preventively conserve stained glass in situ.  While this practice can offer many benefits, as with most other treatments, it is not without drawbacks.  Ideally, the installation of protective glazing can \u201crelieve the stained glass of its function as a weather shield [\u2026], protect it against mechanical and atmospheric damage, and [\u2026] prevent condensation on the surface of the stained glass,\u201d thus minimising the need for interventive conservation (CVMA 2004). Unfortunately, in practice this is not always the case, and it is well known that unsuitable, or improperly ventilated protective glazing can actually create an overly hot or humid microclimate around the historic glass that increases the rate of deterioration (Vogel et al. 2007, 13).  Alternatively, protective screens or grills can be installed on the exterior of windows to prevent mechanical damage like vandalism, however this can have a significant, negative impact on the aesthetic value of the windows from both the exterior and interior (figs. 4\u20135).\n\n==Other options and considerations==\n[[File:Conservation yorkminster.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Figure 6 \u2013 A view of the conservation-related scaffolding around the east end of York Minster, York, UK.]]\nIn some cases, a project may be so extensive that it requires the complete removal of a panel, or set of panels from public view, which in turn raises other considerations concerning public access.  An excellent example of such a case is the current, on-going project to conserve York Minster funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF), which raises the question: how do conservators accommodate the needs of the living, functioning Minster, without compromising conservation goals (fig. 6) (Rosewell 2008a)?  [[File:Windowreplica yorkminster.JPG|thumb|150px|Figure 7 \u2013 A digitally produced replica of the Great East Window of York Minster.]] For instance, upon the removal of the Great East Window from public view (for up to ten years), a solution was needed to combat the sudden gloom of the Minster's interior.  Ultimately, a remarkable life-sized, digital replica was produced to brighten the \u201cvisual 'black hole' that remains\u201d while conservation work is taking place, thus facilitating the aims of conservators by minimising the detrimental effects of losing the visual impact window on the interior (fig. 7) (Rosewell 2008b).  This is not the first time that York Minster has employed a variety of methods to maintain and increase public access while also facilitating the conservation of its stained glass legacy.  Currently, conserved sections of panels that have been permanently removed from their original context due to conservation concerns can be viewed on display near the choir (fig. 8).  Although it is rare that a perfect solution to these concerns can be found, it is a necessary part of conservation planning to take public interest and access into consideration.

This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic.

This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences.

The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13.

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28.

Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

He is founder of the French journal ''Les Cahiers antisp\u00e9cistes'' ({{Translation|''Antispeciesist Notebooks''}}), the annual event [[Veggie Pride]] and of the annual meeting ''Les Estivales de la question animal'' ({{Translation|''The Summers of the Animal Question''}})''.'' Olivier is also the creator of the term \"[[veggiephobia]]\" and of numerous articles and conferences. He is an advocate of [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] and [[Antinaturalism (politics)|antinatauralist]] ethics, and defines himself politically as a [[Progressivism|progressive]].\n\n== Early life ==\nIn 1956, Olivier was born in London, to a French-teaching father and an American painter mother.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://david.olivier.name/fr/david-olivier|title=Qui je suis|last=|first=|date=|website=david.olivier.name|language=fr-FR|trans-title=Who I Am|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> From childhood, he objected to the killing of animals for consumption.<ref>{{Cite interview|last=Olivier|first=David|interviewer=Martin Gibert|title=Refonder le progressisme|url=https://www.veganesmagazine.com/refonder-le-progressisme/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821211435/https://www.veganesmagazine.com/refonder-le-progressisme/|archive-date=2017-08-21|work=Veganes Magazine|date=2015-10-22}}</ref> In adolescence, he was drawn to [[ecology]], then to [[anarchist movement]]s; devoting himself mainly to [[Anti sexist|anti-sexist]] and [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] struggles. In Lyon, he worked for the French [[family planning]] and [[gay liberation]] movements. His focus on the importance of the \"animal question\" grew from the mid-1980s, as he moved away from anarchist and [[Marxism|Marxist]] intellectual influences.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Antispeciesist activism ==\nAuthor of a leaflet initially distributed in [[Lyonnais]] libertarian circles from 1985, Olivier is considered one of the founding figures of the French antispeciesist movement.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dubreuil|first=Catherine-Marie|date=2009|title=L'antisp\u00e9cisme, un mouvement de lib\u00e9ration animale|trans-title=Antispeciesism, an Animal Liberation Movement|url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-ethnologie-francaise-2009-1-page-117.htm|journal=Ethnologie Fran\u00e7aise|language=fr-FR|volume=39|pages=117\u2013122|via=Cairn.info}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.biens-symboliques.net/246|title=Politicizing Activist Discontent: A Social History of \"Vegephobia\" in the French Animal Rights Movement|last=Carri\u00e9|first=Fabien|date=2018-04-12|website=Biens symboliques|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> His meeting with Yves Bonnardel in 1986, made him aware of the existence of an active [[animal liberation movement]] in the [[English-speaking world]]. With Bonnardel, Fran\u00e7oise Blanchon, also present in Lyon squat circles, and two other activists, he produced the pamphlet ''Nous ne mangeons pas de viande pour ne pas tuer d'animaux'' ({{Translation|We don't eat meat so we don't kill animals}}). Being bilingual, Olivier was able to create some of the first translations of [[Peter Singer|Peter Singer's]] works into French; introducing Singer to his fellow activists.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe concept of focusing the fight for animal rights around the ethical concept of antispeciesism lead Olivier, in 1989, soon joined by Fran\u00e7oise Blanchon and Yves Bonnardel, to found the journal ''Les Cahiers antisp\u00e9cistes''. The journal remained, for a long period, the essential media supporting the antispeciesist movement in France. Oliver himself authored many of the journal's articles, in addition to creating French translations of the texts of Peter Singer, [[Tom Regan]], [[Paola Cavalieri]], [[James Rachels]] and [[Steve F. Sapontzis]]. He and the other co-founders of the journal were a decisive influence on S\u00e9bastien Arsac and Brigitte Gothi\u00e8re, future founders of the animal protection organization [[L214]].<ref>{{Cite

Olivier is also the creator of the term \"[[veggiephobia]]\" and of numerous articles and conferences. He is an advocate of [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] and [[Antinaturalism (politics)|antinatauralist]] ethics, and defines himself politically as a [[Progressivism|progressive]].\n\n== Early life ==\nIn 1956, Olivier was born in London, to a French-teaching father and an American painter mother.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://david.olivier.name/fr/david-olivier|title=Qui je suis|last=|first=|date=|website=david.olivier.name|language=fr-FR|trans-title=Who I Am|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> From childhood, he objected to the killing of animals for consumption.<ref>{{Cite interview|last=Olivier|first=David|interviewer=Martin Gibert|title=Refonder le progressisme|url=https://www.veganesmagazine.com/refonder-le-progressisme/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821211435/https://www.veganesmagazine.com/refonder-le-progressisme/|archive-date=2017-08-21|work=Veganes Magazine|date=2015-10-22}}</ref> In adolescence, he was drawn to [[ecology]], then to [[anarchist movement]]s; devoting himself mainly to [[Anti sexist|anti-sexist]] and [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] struggles. In Lyon, he worked for the French [[family planning]] and [[gay liberation]] movements. His focus on the importance of the \"animal question\" grew from the mid-1980s, as he moved away from anarchist and [[Marxism|Marxist]] intellectual influences.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Antispeciesist activism ==\nAuthor of a leaflet initially distributed in [[Lyonnais]] libertarian circles from 1985, Olivier is considered one of the founding figures of the French antispeciesist movement.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dubreuil|first=Catherine-Marie|date=2009|title=L'antisp\u00e9cisme, un mouvement de lib\u00e9ration animale|trans-title=Antispeciesism, an Animal Liberation Movement|url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-ethnologie-francaise-2009-1-page-117.htm|journal=Ethnologie Fran\u00e7aise|language=fr-FR|volume=39|pages=117\u2013122|via=Cairn.info}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.biens-symboliques.net/246|title=Politicizing Activist Discontent: A Social History of \"Vegephobia\" in the French Animal Rights Movement|last=Carri\u00e9|first=Fabien|date=2018-04-12|website=Biens symboliques|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> His meeting with Yves Bonnardel in 1986, made him aware of the existence of an active [[animal liberation movement]] in the [[English-speaking world]]. With Bonnardel, Fran\u00e7oise Blanchon, also present in Lyon squat circles, and two other activists, he produced the pamphlet ''Nous ne mangeons pas de viande pour ne pas tuer d'animaux'' ({{Translation|We don't eat meat so we don't kill animals}}). Being bilingual, Olivier was able to create some of the first translations of [[Peter Singer|Peter Singer's]] works into French; introducing Singer to his fellow activists.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe concept of focusing the fight for animal rights around the ethical concept of antispeciesism lead Olivier, in 1989, soon joined by Fran\u00e7oise Blanchon and Yves Bonnardel, to found the journal ''Les Cahiers antisp\u00e9cistes''. The journal remained, for a long period, the essential media supporting the antispeciesist movement in France. Oliver himself authored many of the journal's articles, in addition to creating French translations of the texts of Peter Singer, [[Tom Regan]], [[Paola Cavalieri]], [[James Rachels]] and [[Steve F. Sapontzis]]. He and the other co-founders of the journal were a decisive influence on S\u00e9bastien Arsac and Brigitte Gothi\u00e8re, future founders of the animal protection organization [[L214]].<ref>{{Cite

It is the highest degree of environmental protection for the assigned areas, which are strictly protected and with access by the public restricted.\n\n==Overview==\nThe literal English translation of ''zapovednik'' is \"nature sanctuary\" (like [[animal sanctuary]]); however, in practice zapovediks sometimes have to do with the protection of things other than nature and can incorporate historical\u2013cultural, historical\u2013archaeological, and other types of cultural or natural heritage. They also function as important sites for historical research and education and so are comparable to the [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] as found in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Site of Special Scientific Interest (Hong Kong)|Hong Kong]].\n\nThe term ''zapovednik'', which refers to the reserve, staff and infrastructure, was used in the former Soviet Union and is still in use in the Russian Federation and in some of the other former Soviet republics. Many reserves have areas with different degrees of protection; sometimes [[grazing]] is permitted to a certain extent.\n\nOther types of protected areas include [[national park|national nature park]]s, ''[[zakaznik]]s'' (referring to \"state game reserve\"  because a limited amount of hunting is allowed there), [[nature monument]]s (often individual trees, geological exposures, or other small areas), etc. Some zapovedniks are recognized as [[biosphere reserve]]s (or sanctuaries).\n\nIn [[Russia]] there are 101 zapovedniks covering about {{convert|330000|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, or about 1.4% of the country's total area. They include everything from isolated patches of steppe to large tracts of [[Siberia]] and the [[Arctic]], and range in size from Galich'ya Gora at 2.31&nbsp;km\u00b2 (570 acres) to the [[Great Arctic State Nature Reserve]] at {{convert|41692|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. The Russian Ministry of Natural Resources oversees 99 of the zapovedniks. The exception is Il'menskiy, which is administered by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], and Galich'ya Gora, administered by [[Voronezh State University]].<ref>Tsentr dickoy prirody</ref>\n\n==Theory of ''zapovednost'''==\nThe theoretical justification for the zapovedniks is known as ''zapovednost''' (\u0437\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c)&nbsp;\u2013 meaning \"the state of being protected in a ''zapovednik''\". It was developed in the 1890s and early 20th century, principally by the soil biologist V.&nbsp;V. [[Dokuchaev]].\n\nThe fundamental idea of ''zapovednost''' is the exclusion of people and the prohibition of economic activity, the only exceptions being non-intrusive access allowed to scientists and rangers.<ref>Shtilmark (2003) p.2.</ref> Zapovedniks are intended to be parcels of untouched natural ecosystems that can be studied as standards with which to compare managed ecosystems, such as are created in agriculture and forestry.<ref>Weiner (2000), p.91.</ref> To this end, zapovedniks need to be large enough to be self-sufficient, with a complete range of [[trophic level]]s up to the top predators.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), pp.12-13.</ref>\n\nIn 1910 the theory of ''zapovednost''' was taken a step forward by I.&nbsp;P. Borodin, who argued that zapovedniks should not be established piecemeal, but as a planned system of reserves including samples of all the main natural regions in the country.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), pp.17-18.</ref>\n\nIn the 1940s [[Aldo Leopold]] understood the need for zapovednik-type reserves: \"While even the largest wilderness areas become partially deranged, it required only a few wild acres for J.&nbsp;E. Weaver to discover why the prairie flora is more drought-resistant than the agronomic flora which has supplanted it.\" The answer was that the wild prairie had a much more complex, and more efficient, root system, and this could only have been discovered by studying the undisturbed natural ecosystem.<ref>Leopold (1968), pp.196-7.</ref>\n\nOf course it would be difficult, if not impossible, to establish a 'perfect' zapovednik today, entirely natural and self-sufficient, especially in view of downstream effects involving pollution and greenhouse gases. Nevertheless, many Russian zapovedniks are a good approximation to the ideal and have been operating as scientific institutions for many decades.\n\n==History==\n\nThe first zapovedniks were set up in the steppe region of the Russian Empire in the 1890s. Some were equipped with research stations. Dokuchaev was the guiding spirit behind these early zapovedniks. Areas of steppe were chosen for the first zapovedniks because of the rapid disappearance of virgin steppe as it was ploughed up, and because it was thought that ploughing might be exacerbating the effects of drought; clearly, research was needed in order to understand the steppe and how it could be best exploited.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), pp.10-13;Weiner (2000), p.12.</ref>\n\nThe applied-science motivation for setting up zapovedniks was continued in the first state-organized zapovednik. [[Barguzin Nature Reserve]] was established by the tsarist government in 1916 on the eastern shore of [[Lake Baikal]]. Its purpose was to protect and study a population of [[sable]]&nbsp;\u2013 a valuable fur species that was declining due to over-hunting.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), p.25.</ref> Other zapovedniks appear to have been set up at about the same time but either lapsed (e.g. Sayan) or did not receive formal recognition until later.<ref>[http://www.wild-russia.org/bioregion13/13_KEDROVAYA-PAD/2_kedro.htm Kedrovaya Pad']</ref><ref>Shtilmark (2003), pp.24-25.</ref>\n\n[[Lenin]]'s nationalization of the land in 1917 and 1918 created a legally favourable environment for the Soviet zapovednik system since securing areas of land for this purpose from private owners was no longer a problem.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), p.29.</ref> Lenin may have had an interest in nature protection because permission was granted promptly for the creation in 1919 of <ref>[http://www.wild-russia.org/bioregion3/astrakhan/3_astrakhan.htm Astrakhan Zapovednik]</ref> in the [[Volga Delta]] on the north-western shore of the Caspian Sea.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), p.30; Weiner (2000), p.27.</ref>\n\nThe recognition of zapovedniks was put on a firm legal footing by a measure \"On the Protection of Nature Monuments, Gardens and Parks\", signed into law by Lenin in 1921.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), p.34; Weiner (2000), p.28.</ref> The creation of zapovedniks continued, but the measure also allowed for the establishment of national parks, though none were set up in the Soviet Union for another half century{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}.\n\nBy 1933 there were 15 state zapovedniks in Russia,<ref>Weiner (2000), p.251.</ref> and by 1995, there were 115. The average area of new zapovedniks declined from 780&nbsp;km\u00b2 in 1916\u201325 to 110&nbsp;km\u00b2 in 1936\u201345, and then rose to 5,060&nbsp;km\u00b2 in 1986\u201395.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), p.206.</ref> In 2007 there were 101 operating zapovedniks, reflecting a small number of new ones opened since 1995, but also two periods of closures and contraction of the system. The first of these was planned by [[Aleksandr Malinovskii]]; it was carried out in 1951 with a view to turning the zapovedniks into \"commercial-and-research\" institutions as well as releasing substantial areas of protected forest for commercial exploitation.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), p.118; Weiner (1999), p.102.</ref> Over the next 10 years the zapovednik system recovered somewhat, but in 1961 [[Nikita Khrushchev]] criticized it, famously referring to a film about them <ref>[http://www.wild-russia.org/bioregion9/9-altai.htm Altay Zapovednik]</ref> in which a scientist was shown watching a squirrel gnawing a nut.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), p.135; Weiner (1999), p.296.</ref> Six zapovedniks were closed and others were amalgamated or reduced in area.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), p.137.</ref>\n\nAlthough in theory a zapovednik is an extensive area of unspoilt natural ecosystems used for scientific research with a residential staff of scientists and rangers, the history of many zapovedniks has in fact been rather different, sometimes involving closure, exploitation (including the felling of forest), and eventual reopening. Even so, some zapovedniks have had an almost unblemished history and most retain the original vision of being scientific research institutions not open to public recreation.\n\n== Environments protected ==\n[[Image:Zapsmap.jpg|thumb|right|430px|Map of zapovedniks in Russia]]\n\nIt is not easy to summarize the coverage of ecosystems protected by zapovedniks, but a rough idea can be gained by counting the number of reserves in the main natural-vegetation zones. On the map these are, from north to south:\n*'''Arctic desert''' (treeless; no continuous vegetation cover) and '''tundra''' (treeless; small shrubs, sedges, mosses)\n*'''taiga''' (coniferous boreal forest with admixture of birch and other deciduous trees)\n*'''deciduous forest''' (discontinuous zone dominated by oak and other deciduous species)\n*'''steppe''' (treeless, dominated by [[forb]]s in the north and grasses in the south).\nThis is a highly simplistic classification. Each major zone is divided into subzones, and there are transitional vegetation types. Moreover, many zapovedniks, especially if in a transitional zone or covering a range of altitudes, will contain examples of several vegetation types.\n\nWith those qualifications, the numbers of zapovednik sites (some zapovedniks occupy widely dispersed sites, some of which are here counted separately) in the different zones are as follows: Arctic desert and tundra&nbsp;\u2013 c.15; taiga&nbsp;\u2013 c.40; deciduous forest&nbsp;\u2013 c.13; steppe&nbsp;\u2013 c.30. About half a dozen are predominantly [[Montane ecology|montane]], especially in the Caucasus. [[Komandorsky Zapovednik|Komandorsky]] and [[Wrangel Island]] are remote islands. A few are mainly [[wetland]]s.\n\n==Management and uses==\nAlthough the principle of ''zapovednost''' stipulates no economic use, in practice zapovedniks have often been required to contribute to the national economy. Voronezh Zapovednik, for instance, bred European beavers for reintroduction to other areas in support of the fur industry.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), p.71.</ref> Several zapovedniks have also been regarded as a breeding ground for other commercially valuable fur-bearing animals, such as sable and [[desman]], allowing them to spread into neighboring unprotected areas to support commercial trapping.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), p.67.</ref>\n\nNon-intervention management is difficult to practise in steppe zapovedniks, which are often far too small to support a self-sustaining ecosystem including wild herbivores (such as saiga) that may have been migratory. Resort is sometimes made to various mowing regimes, which however cannot satisfactorily replace natural processes insofar as it does not recycle nutrients and organic matter through the herbivore and carnivore food chain, and cannot replicate trampling effects.\n\nAn important activity in all zapovedniks is regular monitoring of seasonal events ([[phenology]]). This is now standardized in a programme of observations known as the Chronicle of Nature (\u041b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0434\u044b). The name was suggested by [[Aleksandr Formozov]] in 1937 although a monitoring programme was being developed by V.N.Sukachev in 1914 and [[Grigorii Kozhevnikov]] in 1928.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), pp.67, 84, 96; Volkov (1996), p.9.</ref> Instructions for conducting the Chronicle of Nature are periodically updated.<ref>Filonov & Nukhimovskaya (1990).</ref>\n\nUnder the pressure to become self-financing, some zapovedniks have tried at various times to develop ecological tourism - usually in the reserve's buffer zone, so avoiding infringement of the principle of ''zapovednost'''. In some cases tourism does however become a serious problem on account of the proximity of recreation centres, e.g. at [[Teberdinsky Zapovednik]] in the [[Caucasus]]. The Dombai recreation center, long a favorite Russian [[alpine skiing]] destination, is located near the center of the zapovednik, and the impact of tourism in the area as more Russians and foreigners come to visit has created pressure on the preserved ecosystems around it.\n\n==International significance of the zapovednik system==\nThe [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic impact on the environment]] - due to pollution, climate change and ultimately human population growth - is generating increasingly serious problems, the solution of which will depend on a better understanding of the biosphere than we already have. To provide conditions in which such an understanding can be developed, it is essential to preserve as far as possible intact examples of natural ecosystems, and the zapovedniks are the only large system of protected areas created primarily for this purpose. In the case of soil erosion, for example, it is only by comparing soil formation and loss rates from intact steppe or prairie and from the same kind of land under intensive agriculture that we can appreciate how destructive of natural capital the latter often is.<ref>Montgomery (2007), pp.150-8, 172-4.</ref>\n\nRegular long-term monitoring of natural phenomena in zapovedniks has also provided a baseline set of data which is now valuable for assessing how anthropogenic pressure, primarily through climate change, is affecting natural ecosystems. Since the latter perform essential functions such as carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling, it is obviously important to know how these ecosystem services are being affected by anthropogenic pressure.<ref>Kokorin et al.</ref> There is an argument for establishing a well funded global network of zapovedniks in order to increase our understanding of anthropogenic pressures on all the natural ecosystems of the world.\n\n{{Anchor|List of Russian Nature Reserves}}\n\n==List of Nature Reserves (\"Zapovedniks\") in Russia==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:98%\"\n!scope=\"col\" |Name\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Photo\n!scope=\"col\" |Location\n!scope=\"col\" |Website\n!scope=\"col\" |Area\n!scope=\"col\" |Year\n!scope=\"col\" |Description\n\n|-\n!scope='row' | [[Altai Nature Reserve|Altai]]\n| [[File:Chulyshman reka 01.jpg|150px|alt=Altai Zapovednik]]\n| [[Altai Republic]] <br/><small>{{coord|52|52|0|N|88|57|0 |E|name=Altai|type:landmark}}</small><br/>\n| Park:<br/>[http://www.altzapovednik.ru/ \u0410\u043b\u0442\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439]\n| {{convert|881238|ha|sqmi|1|sortable=on|abbr=on}}\n| 1932\n| [[Altai Mountains]] of south central Russia.

It is the highest degree of environmental protection for the assigned areas, which are strictly protected and with access by the public restricted.\n\n==Overview==\nThe literal English translation of ''zapovednik'' is \"nature sanctuary\" (like [[animal sanctuary]]); however, in practice zapovediks sometimes have to do with the protection of things other than nature and can incorporate historical\u2013cultural, historical\u2013archaeological, and other types of cultural or natural heritage. They also function as important sites for historical research and education and so are comparable to the [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] as found in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Site of Special Scientific Interest (Hong Kong)|Hong Kong]].\n\nThe term ''zapovednik'', which refers to the reserve, staff and infrastructure, was used in the former Soviet Union and is still in use in the Russian Federation and in some of the other former Soviet republics. Many reserves have areas with different degrees of protection; sometimes [[grazing]] is permitted to a certain extent.\n\nOther types of protected areas include [[national park|national nature park]]s, ''[[zakaznik]]s'' (referring to \"state game reserve\"  because a limited amount of hunting is allowed there), [[nature monument]]s (often individual trees, geological exposures, or other small areas), etc. Some zapovedniks are recognized as [[biosphere reserve]]s (or sanctuaries).\n\nIn [[Russia]] there are 101 zapovedniks covering about {{convert|330000|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, or about 1.4% of the country's total area. They include everything from isolated patches of steppe to large tracts of [[Siberia]] and the [[Arctic]], and range in size from Galich'ya Gora at 2.31&nbsp;km\u00b2 (570 acres) to the [[Great Arctic State Nature Reserve]] at {{convert|41692|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. The Russian Ministry of Natural Resources oversees 99 of the zapovedniks. The exception is Il'menskiy, which is administered by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], and Galich'ya Gora, administered by [[Voronezh State University]].<ref>Tsentr dickoy prirody</ref>\n\n==Theory of ''zapovednost'''==\nThe theoretical justification for the zapovedniks is known as ''zapovednost''' (\u0437\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c)&nbsp;\u2013 meaning \"the state of being protected in a ''zapovednik''\". It was developed in the 1890s and early 20th century, principally by the soil biologist V.&nbsp;V. [[Dokuchaev]].\n\nThe fundamental idea of ''zapovednost''' is the exclusion of people and the prohibition of economic activity, the only exceptions being non-intrusive access allowed to scientists and rangers.<ref>Shtilmark (2003) p.2.</ref> Zapovedniks are intended to be parcels of untouched natural ecosystems that can be studied as standards with which to compare managed ecosystems, such as are created in agriculture and forestry.<ref>Weiner (2000), p.91.</ref> To this end, zapovedniks need to be large enough to be self-sufficient, with a complete range of [[trophic level]]s up to the top predators.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), pp.12-13.</ref>\n\nIn 1910 the theory of ''zapovednost''' was taken a step forward by I.&nbsp;P. Borodin, who argued that zapovedniks should not be established piecemeal, but as a planned system of reserves including samples of all the main natural regions in the country.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), pp.17-18.</ref>\n\nIn the 1940s [[Aldo Leopold]] understood the need for zapovednik-type reserves: \"While even the largest wilderness areas become partially deranged, it required only a few wild acres for J.&nbsp;E. Weaver to discover why the prairie flora is more drought-resistant than the agronomic flora which has supplanted it.\" The answer was that the wild prairie had a much more complex, and more efficient, root system, and this could only have been discovered by studying the undisturbed natural ecosystem.<ref>Leopold (1968), pp.196-7.</ref>\n\nOf course it would be difficult, if not impossible, to establish a 'perfect' zapovednik today, entirely natural and self-sufficient, especially in view of downstream effects involving pollution and greenhouse gases. Nevertheless, many Russian zapovedniks are a good approximation to the ideal and have been operating as scientific institutions for many decades.\n\n==History==\n\nThe first zapovedniks were set up in the steppe region of the Russian Empire in the 1890s. Some were equipped with research stations. Dokuchaev was the guiding spirit behind these early zapovedniks. Areas of steppe were chosen for the first zapovedniks because of the rapid disappearance of virgin steppe as it was ploughed up, and because it was thought that ploughing might be exacerbating the effects of drought; clearly, research was needed in order to understand the steppe and how it could be best exploited.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), pp.10-13;Weiner (2000), p.12.</ref>\n\nThe applied-science motivation for setting up zapovedniks was continued in the first state-organized zapovednik. [[Barguzin Nature Reserve]] was established by the tsarist government in 1916 on the eastern shore of [[Lake Baikal]]. Its purpose was to protect and study a population of [[sable]]&nbsp;\u2013 a valuable fur species that was declining due to over-hunting.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), p.25.</ref> Other zapovedniks appear to have been set up at about the same time but either lapsed (e.g. Sayan) or did not receive formal recognition until later.<ref>[http://www.wild-russia.org/bioregion13/13_KEDROVAYA-PAD/2_kedro.htm Kedrovaya Pad']</ref><ref>Shtilmark (2003), pp.24-25.</ref>\n\n[[Lenin]]'s nationalization of the land in 1917 and 1918 created a legally favourable environment for the Soviet zapovednik system since securing areas of land for this purpose from private owners was no longer a problem.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), p.29.</ref> Lenin may have had an interest in nature protection because permission was granted promptly for the creation in 1919 of <ref>[http://www.wild-russia.org/bioregion3/astrakhan/3_astrakhan.htm Astrakhan Zapovednik]</ref> in the [[Volga Delta]] on the north-western shore of the Caspian Sea.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), p.30; Weiner (2000), p.27.</ref>\n\nThe recognition of zapovedniks was put on a firm legal footing by a measure \"On the Protection of Nature Monuments, Gardens and Parks\", signed into law by Lenin in 1921.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), p.34; Weiner (2000), p.28.</ref> The creation of zapovedniks continued, but the measure also allowed for the establishment of national parks, though none were set up in the Soviet Union for another half century{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}.\n\nBy 1933 there were 15 state zapovedniks in Russia,<ref>Weiner (2000), p.251.</ref> and by 1995, there were 115. The average area of new zapovedniks declined from 780&nbsp;km\u00b2 in 1916\u201325 to 110&nbsp;km\u00b2 in 1936\u201345, and then rose to 5,060&nbsp;km\u00b2 in 1986\u201395.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), p.206.</ref> In 2007 there were 101 operating zapovedniks, reflecting a small number of new ones opened since 1995, but also two periods of closures and contraction of the system. The first of these was planned by [[Aleksandr Malinovskii]]; it was carried out in 1951 with a view to turning the zapovedniks into \"commercial-and-research\" institutions as well as releasing substantial areas of protected forest for commercial exploitation.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), p.118; Weiner (1999), p.102.</ref> Over the next 10 years the zapovednik system recovered somewhat, but in 1961 [[Nikita Khrushchev]] criticized it, famously referring to a film about them <ref>[http://www.wild-russia.org/bioregion9/9-altai.htm Altay Zapovednik]</ref> in which a scientist was shown watching a squirrel gnawing a nut.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), p.135; Weiner (1999), p.296.</ref> Six zapovedniks were closed and others were amalgamated or reduced in area.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), p.137.</ref>\n\nAlthough in theory a zapovednik is an extensive area of unspoilt natural ecosystems used for scientific research with a residential staff of scientists and rangers, the history of many zapovedniks has in fact been rather different, sometimes involving closure, exploitation (including the felling of forest), and eventual reopening. Even so, some zapovedniks have had an almost unblemished history and most retain the original vision of being scientific research institutions not open to public recreation.\n\n== Environments protected ==\n[[Image:Zapsmap.jpg|thumb|right|430px|Map of zapovedniks in Russia]]\n\nIt is not easy to summarize the coverage of ecosystems protected by zapovedniks, but a rough idea can be gained by counting the number of reserves in the main natural-vegetation zones. On the map these are, from north to south:\n*'''Arctic desert''' (treeless; no continuous vegetation cover) and '''tundra''' (treeless; small shrubs, sedges, mosses)\n*'''taiga''' (coniferous boreal forest with admixture of birch and other deciduous trees)\n*'''deciduous forest''' (discontinuous zone dominated by oak and other deciduous species)\n*'''steppe''' (treeless, dominated by [[forb]]s in the north and grasses in the south).\nThis is a highly simplistic classification. Each major zone is divided into subzones, and there are transitional vegetation types. Moreover, many zapovedniks, especially if in a transitional zone or covering a range of altitudes, will contain examples of several vegetation types.\n\nWith those qualifications, the numbers of zapovednik sites (some zapovedniks occupy widely dispersed sites, some of which are here counted separately) in the different zones are as follows: Arctic desert and tundra&nbsp;\u2013 c.15; taiga&nbsp;\u2013 c.40; deciduous forest&nbsp;\u2013 c.13; steppe&nbsp;\u2013 c.30. About half a dozen are predominantly [[Montane ecology|montane]], especially in the Caucasus. [[Komandorsky Zapovednik|Komandorsky]] and [[Wrangel Island]] are remote islands. A few are mainly [[wetland]]s.\n\n==Management and uses==\nAlthough the principle of ''zapovednost''' stipulates no economic use, in practice zapovedniks have often been required to contribute to the national economy. Voronezh Zapovednik, for instance, bred European beavers for reintroduction to other areas in support of the fur industry.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), p.71.</ref> Several zapovedniks have also been regarded as a breeding ground for other commercially valuable fur-bearing animals, such as sable and [[desman]], allowing them to spread into neighboring unprotected areas to support commercial trapping.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), p.67.</ref>\n\nNon-intervention management is difficult to practise in steppe zapovedniks, which are often far too small to support a self-sustaining ecosystem including wild herbivores (such as saiga) that may have been migratory. Resort is sometimes made to various mowing regimes, which however cannot satisfactorily replace natural processes insofar as it does not recycle nutrients and organic matter through the herbivore and carnivore food chain, and cannot replicate trampling effects.\n\nAn important activity in all zapovedniks is regular monitoring of seasonal events ([[phenology]]). This is now standardized in a programme of observations known as the Chronicle of Nature (\u041b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0434\u044b). The name was suggested by [[Aleksandr Formozov]] in 1937 although a monitoring programme was being developed by V.N.Sukachev in 1914 and [[Grigorii Kozhevnikov]] in 1928.<ref>Shtilmark (2003), pp.67, 84, 96; Volkov (1996), p.9.</ref> Instructions for conducting the Chronicle of Nature are periodically updated.<ref>Filonov & Nukhimovskaya (1990).</ref>\n\nUnder the pressure to become self-financing, some zapovedniks have tried at various times to develop ecological tourism - usually in the reserve's buffer zone, so avoiding infringement of the principle of ''zapovednost'''. In some cases tourism does however become a serious problem on account of the proximity of recreation centres, e.g. at [[Teberdinsky Zapovednik]] in the [[Caucasus]]. The Dombai recreation center, long a favorite Russian [[alpine skiing]] destination, is located near the center of the zapovednik, and the impact of tourism in the area as more Russians and foreigners come to visit has created pressure on the preserved ecosystems around it.\n\n==International significance of the zapovednik system==\nThe [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic impact on the environment]] - due to pollution, climate change and ultimately human population growth - is generating increasingly serious problems, the solution of which will depend on a better understanding of the biosphere than we already have. To provide conditions in which such an understanding can be developed, it is essential to preserve as far as possible intact examples of natural ecosystems, and the zapovedniks are the only large system of protected areas created primarily for this purpose. In the case of soil erosion, for example, it is only by comparing soil formation and loss rates from intact steppe or prairie and from the same kind of land under intensive agriculture that we can appreciate how destructive of natural capital the latter often is.<ref>Montgomery (2007), pp.150-8, 172-4.</ref>\n\nRegular long-term monitoring of natural phenomena in zapovedniks has also provided a baseline set of data which is now valuable for assessing how anthropogenic pressure, primarily through climate change, is affecting natural ecosystems. Since the latter perform essential functions such as carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling, it is obviously important to know how these ecosystem services are being affected by anthropogenic pressure.<ref>Kokorin et al.</ref> There is an argument for establishing a well funded global network of zapovedniks in order to increase our understanding of anthropogenic pressures on all the natural ecosystems of the world.\n\n{{Anchor|List of Russian Nature Reserves}}\n\n==List of Nature Reserves (\"Zapovedniks\") in Russia==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:98%\"\n!scope=\"col\" |Name\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Photo\n!scope=\"col\" |Location\n!scope=\"col\" |Website\n!scope=\"col\" |Area\n!scope=\"col\" |Year\n!scope=\"col\" |Description\n\n|-\n!scope='row' | [[Altai Nature Reserve|Altai]]\n| [[File:Chulyshman reka 01.jpg|150px|alt=Altai Zapovednik]]\n| [[Altai Republic]] <br/><small>{{coord|52|52|0|N|88|57|0 |E|name=Altai|type:landmark}}</small><br/>\n| Park:<br/>[http://www.altzapovednik.ru/ \u0410\u043b\u0442\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439]\n| {{convert|881238|ha|sqmi|1|sortable=on|abbr=on}}\n| 1932\n| [[Altai Mountains]] of south central Russia.

It was later adapted into an [[anime]]<ref name=\"Mahoujin Guru Guru\">[http://www.anime-planet.com/anime/mahoujin-guru-guru Mahoujin Guru Guru]</ref> series on October 13, 1994. A second manga series was serialized in ''[[Gangan Online]]'' in 2012.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-10-04/magical-circle-guru-guru-2-manga-to-launch-next-month|title=Magical Circle Guru Guru 2 Manga to Launch Next Month|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en}}</ref>\n\n''Mah\u014djin Guru Guru'' is a light-hearted series aimed at older children; it contains occasional toilet gags and some innuendo that might startle western parents. It also is a parody of early [[role-playing video game]]s (RPGs), particularly turn-based games such as the [[Dragon Quest]] games. The narrator speaks in place of the dialog in such games, and this is one of the comedy elements of the show. Often role-playing videogame-style information boxes are displayed on screen with accompanying narration in the traditional RPG style. The overall goal of the main characters, Nike and Kukuri, is to defeat Giri, the ruler of the darkness. Since the anime is based on an RPG, several side quests need to be completed before they are able to locate him.\n\nA new series based on the manga animated by [[Production I.G]] aired from July to December, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-01-10/mahojin-guru-guru-gag-fantasy-manga-gets-new-tv-anime/.110834|title=Mah\u014djin Guru Guru Gag Fantasy Manga Gets New TV Anime|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=10 January 2017|accessdate=10 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-03-24/katsuyuki-konishi-yo-taichi-join-magical-circle-guru-guru-anime-cast/.113911|title=Katsuyuki Konishi, Y\u014d Taichi Join Magical Circle Guru Guru|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=March 25, 2017| accessdate=March 25, 2017}}</ref> [[Crunchyroll]] streamed the anime, marking the first anime from the Mahoujin Guru Guru franchise to receive an official English release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-07-11/crunchyroll-adds-magical-circle-guru-guru-anime/.118706|title=Crunchyroll Adds Magical Circle Guru-Guru Anime|website=Anime News Network|date=July 11, 2017|accessdate=July 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n;{{nihongo|Nike|\u30cb\u30b1}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Fujiko Takimoto]] (1994-1996), [[Omi Minami]] (2000), [[Shizuka Ishigami]] (2017)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-01-21/new-mahojin-guru-guru-tv-anime-casts-shizuka-ishigami-konomi-kohara/.111310|title=New Mah\u014djin Guru Guru TV Anime Casts Shizuka Ishigami, Konomi Kohara|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=21 January 2017|accessdate=9 February 2017}}</ref>}}\n:Nike (pronounced Nee-kay) is the [[protagonist]]. Nike's father Bado had always wished to be a [[Hero]] but, due to the lack of any great evil to fight against, he had to give his dream up. Still, he made his son undergo hard training as a child in hopes that one day a great evil would arise and Nike could fight it. Because of this Nike is a competent, although cowardly, fighter; like Kukuri he is initially immature and inexperienced. Nike is from Jimina Mura (which translates to Plain Old Village). Initially Nike wants to be a [[Wizard (character class)|Wizard]] as he finds the thought of casting a fireball \"cool\", though his parents convince him to choose the Hero. He initially thinks that he is of the Hero class, as do others. It is later revealed that he is a [[Thief (character class)|Thief]]. Despite this he can use all the abilities of the Hero class, including Gallant Pose, which only a Hero can do.\n\n:;{{nihongo|Bado|\u30d0\u30c9}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroshi Masuoka (voice actor)|Hiroshi Masuoka]] (1994-96)}}\n::Bado is Nike's father. He received a critical hit in the form of a punch the first time he held the infant Nike. After that he trained Nike to be a Hero. Right before the departs for Kodai castle he offers him his old helmet. The helmet is cracked, but Nike suggests he will wear it by tilting it to the side. Bado kicks Nike into the air and keeps the helmet saying that he looks like a gang leader.\n\n:;{{nihongo|Rena|\u30ec\u30ca}}\n::Rena is Nike's mother.

She has grown under the care of Jimuna Town's old witch, who received her when she was a baby from a wandering stranger, supposedly the last member of the Migu Migu Tribe. Being the last remaining member of the Migu Migu, Kukuri learns the dark summoning magic only the Migu Migu can use known as Guru Guru; it consists of drawing circles on the ground with a staff. She is eager and shows great affection towards Nike, almost always calling him \"Mr. Hero\" (''Yusha'' in Japanese). She is extremely lucky or good in several sports and games such as [[rock-paper-scissors]] and [[cricket]]. She becomes very angry when someone says anything about her appearance: When she was steaming nervously, she got very angry when Nike called her a steamed octopus; she almost killed a monster who called her fat when she was dressed up like a Meke Meke.\n\n:'''Old Witch'''\n::An old woman who raised Kukuri.

He believes that this was the result of a curse as they had commercialized the dance. His dance is often regarded as creepy and disgusting by the other characters. He usually follows the duo of Nike and Kukuri around. He wears a [[hula]] dress and usually finds some excuse to perform his Kita Kita dance, much to Nike and Kukuri's dismay. Apparently he wants to pass on the Kita Kita dance to the next generation and is looking for trainees. In \"Doki Doki Legend\" it is learned he developed muscles from all the dancing and is able to defeat monsters in one punch by accident.

''Light'' magic, ''Dark'' magic and ''Guru Guru'' which is considered to be Dark magic at first but later revealed to be ''Free'' magic. Nike tells old witch that at first he thought that Guru Guru was something [[Ecchi]]. Guru Guru has random effects when a spell fails. Light magic has to do with controlling natural forces, Dark magic with controlling unnatural forces and creatures and Guru Guru mostly has to do with summoning. The spells cast by Kukuri gain power-ups in effects and certain changes in appearance as she increases her level and knowledge of Guru Guru.\n*Manifest gas,\n\n===Guru Guru===\n*'''Lizard's tail'''\nRequires Fire circle symbol called Tora (Kukuri mistakes it for Taura when the first time she tries to show magic to Nike and creates a strange but harmless monster). The spell attacks by conjuring a geyser of fire in the shape of a lizard's head.\n*'''Underground Viper'''\nRequires Fire circle symbol called Tora. The spell attacks monsters in the vicinity by burrowing under the earth and surrounding them in flame much like a fireball even if the caster is not aware of them or their location. \n*'''Long Winded Meow'''\nSummons a large toy with the head of a cat that meows, dispels magical powers and stuns most monsters and characters. This includes Kukuri.\n*'''Bemu Bemu Guardian'''\nAn extremely powerful 15 level attack spell that summons a [[demon]] from hell with many eyes that shoots lightning bolts. The spell was hidden in Kita Kita Oyaji's dance making its acquisition a painful feat for Kukuri that even made a confusion fairy appear. The spell protects the caster from attacks - even before the demon has appeared - with an invisible dome.\n*'''Summon nothingness fairy'''\nA level two spell that summons nothingness fairies. Everything the target attempts fails and his words make no sense. The spell also provides a dome of protection prior to the arrival of the fairies in the same way as ''Bemu Bemu Guardian'' dome does.\n*'''Smiling Giant (minor spell)'''\nSummons a giant to stand on the horizon.  He will smile at the enemy in battle.  The spell lasts 3 days.\n*'''Special Power-Up (minor spell)'''\nThis spell will power-up an ally standing in the circle.

The commemorative tenth failed spell summons Octo-Tim, who transforms Kukuri into Devil-Kukuri.\n*'''Seal Magic Circle (minor spell)'''\nAlso called one-minute seal, this level three spell causes a large bandage to fall from the sky and immobilize the enemy.  Depending on the level of the caster, the seal lasts from one minute to three hundred years, and gives the caster the chance to escape.\n\n===Light Magic===\n*'''Gallant Pose''' This can only be done by someone of the Hero class(although Nike has been able to use it even though he is a  Thief).  This spell freezes the opponent in their tracks, as they gaze at the hero.\n*'''Zam Dien''' Zaza's grandfather's name. The spell is useless, though it draws the attention of Kasegi gold to Zaza and gives time to Kukuri and Nike to counterattack.\n*'''Fireball''' or Firebolt\n*'''Light Shield''' A shield made by Light energy. Its color varies according to the user. The user can fly and is protected from attacks.\n*'''Kira Kira sword''' A magic sword that has a large amount of strength and can shoot energy slashes. You have to be careful when forming it though, because its blade turns into whatever its energy touches. Most blades are useless; however, some are useful, like the Kira Kira Old Man Sword and the Kira Kira School Cuckoo Sword.\n*'''Wind sword'''\n*'''Fire sword'''\n*'''Earth sword'''\n*'''Water sword'''\n*'''Kira Kira Old man sword''' This was an accident created when Nike was trying to form the Kira Kira sword. Kita Kita Oyaji fell on Nike's hand when he was forming the sword, resulting in the Old man's energy being mixed with the sword's and the sword's tip being Old man's head. Whoever is hit by the sword is forced to dance the Kita Kita Dance.\n\n===Dark Magic===\n*'''Golden Hammer'''\n==Media==\n===First anime series===\nThe first series<ref name=\"Mahoujin Guru Guru\"/> \"Mahoujin Guru Guru\" (produced by Nippon Animation) has 45 episodes.

It was later adapted into an [[anime]]<ref name=\"Mahoujin Guru Guru\">[http://www.anime-planet.com/anime/mahoujin-guru-guru Mahoujin Guru Guru]</ref> series on October 13, 1994. A second manga series was serialized in ''[[Gangan Online]]'' in 2012.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-10-04/magical-circle-guru-guru-2-manga-to-launch-next-month|title=Magical Circle Guru Guru 2 Manga to Launch Next Month|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en}}</ref>\n\n''Mah\u014djin Guru Guru'' is a light-hearted series aimed at older children; it contains occasional toilet gags and some innuendo that might startle western parents. It also is a parody of early [[role-playing video game]]s (RPGs), particularly turn-based games such as the [[Dragon Quest]] games. The narrator speaks in place of the dialog in such games, and this is one of the comedy elements of the show. Often role-playing videogame-style information boxes are displayed on screen with accompanying narration in the traditional RPG style. The overall goal of the main characters, Nike and Kukuri, is to defeat Giri, the ruler of the darkness. Since the anime is based on an RPG, several side quests need to be completed before they are able to locate him.\n\nA new series based on the manga animated by [[Production I.G]] aired from July to December, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-01-10/mahojin-guru-guru-gag-fantasy-manga-gets-new-tv-anime/.110834|title=Mah\u014djin Guru Guru Gag Fantasy Manga Gets New TV Anime|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=10 January 2017|accessdate=10 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-03-24/katsuyuki-konishi-yo-taichi-join-magical-circle-guru-guru-anime-cast/.113911|title=Katsuyuki Konishi, Y\u014d Taichi Join Magical Circle Guru Guru|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=March 25, 2017| accessdate=March 25, 2017}}</ref> [[Crunchyroll]] streamed the anime, marking the first anime from the Mahoujin Guru Guru franchise to receive an official English release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-07-11/crunchyroll-adds-magical-circle-guru-guru-anime/.118706|title=Crunchyroll Adds Magical Circle Guru-Guru Anime|website=Anime News Network|date=July 11, 2017|accessdate=July 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n;{{nihongo|Nike|\u30cb\u30b1}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Fujiko Takimoto]] (1994-1996), [[Omi Minami]] (2000), [[Shizuka Ishigami]] (2017)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-01-21/new-mahojin-guru-guru-tv-anime-casts-shizuka-ishigami-konomi-kohara/.111310|title=New Mah\u014djin Guru Guru TV Anime Casts Shizuka Ishigami, Konomi Kohara|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=21 January 2017|accessdate=9 February 2017}}</ref>}}\n:Nike (pronounced Nee-kay) is the [[protagonist]]. Nike's father Bado had always wished to be a [[Hero]] but, due to the lack of any great evil to fight against, he had to give his dream up. Still, he made his son undergo hard training as a child in hopes that one day a great evil would arise and Nike could fight it. Because of this Nike is a competent, although cowardly, fighter; like Kukuri he is initially immature and inexperienced. Nike is from Jimina Mura (which translates to Plain Old Village). Initially Nike wants to be a [[Wizard (character class)|Wizard]] as he finds the thought of casting a fireball \"cool\", though his parents convince him to choose the Hero. He initially thinks that he is of the Hero class, as do others. It is later revealed that he is a [[Thief (character class)|Thief]]. Despite this he can use all the abilities of the Hero class, including Gallant Pose, which only a Hero can do.\n\n:;{{nihongo|Bado|\u30d0\u30c9}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroshi Masuoka (voice actor)|Hiroshi Masuoka]] (1994-96)}}\n::Bado is Nike's father.

She has grown under the care of Jimuna Town's old witch, who received her when she was a baby from a wandering stranger, supposedly the last member of the Migu Migu Tribe. Being the last remaining member of the Migu Migu, Kukuri learns the dark summoning magic only the Migu Migu can use known as Guru Guru; it consists of drawing circles on the ground with a staff. She is eager and shows great affection towards Nike, almost always calling him \"Mr. Hero\" (''Yusha'' in Japanese). She is extremely lucky or good in several sports and games such as [[rock-paper-scissors]] and [[cricket]]. She becomes very angry when someone says anything about her appearance: When she was steaming nervously, she got very angry when Nike called her a steamed octopus; she almost killed a monster who called her fat when she was dressed up like a Meke Meke.\n\n:'''Old Witch'''\n::An old woman who raised Kukuri.

When the town's [[Hula|traditional dance]] Kita Kita could no longer be performed because no more girls were born, he started dancing it himself. He believes that this was the result of a curse as they had commercialized the dance. His dance is often regarded as creepy and disgusting by the other characters. He usually follows the duo of Nike and Kukuri around. He wears a [[hula]] dress and usually finds some excuse to perform his Kita Kita dance, much to Nike and Kukuri's dismay. Apparently he wants to pass on the Kita Kita dance to the next generation and is looking for trainees. In \"Doki Doki Legend\" it is learned he developed muscles from all the dancing and is able to defeat monsters in one punch by accident. He has enormous [[Health (gaming)|Hit Points]] (a staggering 1650 in the \"Pickle of Happiness\") that makes him nearly immortal and capable to sustain extreme levels of abuse (that is inflicted upon him all the time).\n\n;Toma\n:Voiced by [[Yukiyo Fujii]] (2017)<ref name=\"MoreCast\"/> \n:He joins the party and meets Nike and Kukuri in North village where he pretends to be of the Priest class.

It can create earthquakes and its power can be used to create blue energy beams that travel along the ground. Given to Nike at the Shugi Ruins. Was taken away when JuJu used it along with the Magic Bracelet of Heaven to break the third seal.\n*''Magic Bracelet of Heaven'', one of the two magic bracelets of Shugi Village. It is golden. It can create wings of light that can allow the user to fly. Was given to Kukuri when she leveled up at the Training Tower. Was taken away when JuJu used it along with the Magic Bracelet of Earth to break the third seal.\n\n==Spells==\nThere are three kinds of magic in the show. ''Light'' magic, ''Dark'' magic and ''Guru Guru'' which is considered to be Dark magic at first but later revealed to be ''Free'' magic. Nike tells old witch that at first he thought that Guru Guru was something [[Ecchi]]. Guru Guru has random effects when a spell fails. Light magic has to do with controlling natural forces, Dark magic with controlling unnatural forces and creatures and Guru Guru mostly has to do with summoning. The spells cast by Kukuri gain power-ups in effects and certain changes in appearance as she increases her level and knowledge of Guru Guru.\n*Manifest gas,\n\n===Guru Guru===\n*'''Lizard's tail'''\nRequires Fire circle symbol called Tora (Kukuri mistakes it for Taura when the first time she tries to show magic to Nike and creates a strange but harmless monster). The spell attacks by conjuring a geyser of fire in the shape of a lizard's head.\n*'''Underground Viper'''\nRequires Fire circle symbol called Tora. The spell attacks monsters in the vicinity by burrowing under the earth and surrounding them in flame much like a fireball even if the caster is not aware of them or their location. \n*'''Long Winded Meow'''\nSummons a large toy with the head of a cat that meows, dispels magical powers and stuns most monsters and characters. This includes Kukuri.\n*'''Bemu Bemu Guardian'''\nAn extremely powerful 15 level attack spell that summons a [[demon]] from hell with many eyes that shoots lightning bolts. The spell was hidden in Kita Kita Oyaji's dance making its acquisition a painful feat for Kukuri that even made a confusion fairy appear. The spell protects the caster from attacks - even before the demon has appeared - with an invisible dome.\n*'''Summon nothingness fairy'''\nA level two spell that summons nothingness fairies. Everything the target attempts fails and his words make no sense. The spell also provides a dome of protection prior to the arrival of the fairies in the same way as ''Bemu Bemu Guardian'' dome does.\n*'''Smiling Giant (minor spell)'''\nSummons a giant to stand on the horizon.  He will smile at the enemy in battle.  The spell lasts 3 days.\n*'''Special Power-Up (minor spell)'''\nThis spell will power-up an ally standing in the circle.  It will affect him or her randomly in one of three ways: by increasing the level of the target, increasing speed by 10, or by increasing charisma.  The effects last for 3 minutes.\n*'''Failed Spell (any unsuccessful spell)'''\nSummons random creatures.  The commemorative tenth failed spell summons Octo-Tim, who transforms Kukuri into Devil-Kukuri.\n*'''Seal Magic Circle (minor spell)'''\nAlso called one-minute seal, this level three spell causes a large bandage to fall from the sky and immobilize the enemy.  Depending on the level of the caster, the seal lasts from one minute to three hundred years, and gives the caster the chance to escape.\n\n===Light Magic===\n*'''Gallant Pose''' This can only be done by someone of the Hero class(although Nike has been able to use it even though he is a  Thief).  This spell freezes the opponent in their tracks, as they gaze at the hero.\n*'''Zam Dien''' Zaza's grandfather's name. The spell is useless, though it draws the attention of Kasegi gold to Zaza and gives time to Kukuri and Nike to counterattack.\n*'''Fireball''' or Firebolt\n*'''Light Shield''' A shield made by Light energy. Its color varies according to the user. The user can fly and is protected from attacks.\n*'''Kira Kira sword''' A magic sword that has a large amount of strength and can shoot energy slashes. You have to be careful when forming it though, because its blade turns into whatever its energy touches. Most blades are useless; however, some are useful, like the Kira Kira Old Man Sword and the Kira Kira School Cuckoo Sword.\n*'''Wind sword'''\n*'''Fire sword'''\n*'''Earth sword'''\n*'''Water sword'''\n*'''Kira Kira Old man sword''' This was an accident created when Nike was trying to form the Kira Kira sword. Kita Kita Oyaji fell on Nike's hand when he was forming the sword, resulting in the Old man's energy being mixed with the sword's and the sword's tip being Old man's head. Whoever is hit by the sword is forced to dance the Kita Kita Dance.\n\n===Dark Magic===\n*'''Golden Hammer'''\n==Media==\n===First anime series===\nThe first series<ref name=\"Mahoujin Guru Guru\"/> \"Mahoujin Guru Guru\" (produced by Nippon Animation) has 45 episodes.

The film stars [[Rajesh Khanna]] and [[Sharmila Tagore]] in lead roles. The film was produced by Sharmila Tagore's secretary, N.S. Kabir, and was co-produced by Sharmila Tagore. Rajesh Khanna's real-life secretary Gurnam Singh played the side kick Bansi to Khanna's character Chetan in this film. The film was critically acclaimed and given four stars by critics upon its release in Bollywood Guide Collections. It was the last film to release with the music director as [[S.D. Burman]]. This film was not commercially successful at the time of its release. However, over the years this film has gained a cult following and appreciation from audiences in its screening on television.<ref>http://archive.indianexpress.com/Picture-Gallery/fans-remember-rajesh-khanna-on-his-first-death-anniversary/3076-6.html</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe story begins in the Central Jail, where a prisoner (Raza Murad) being hanged in the morning is desperately bewailing his fate. His fears are soothed somewhat by another inmate named Chetan (Rajesh Khanna) who tells him that he is not dying but starting a new life elsewhere in a body free from sin. The concept comforts the prisoner and the jail inmate becomes happy. Chetan has served a 10-year-long sentence for murder and is about to be released early for good behavior. The Jailor (Murad) is curious as to how such an obviously empathetic and honest man such as Chetan has proved to be a murderer as well, and he asks Chetan to explain. Initially, Chetan refuses gently but then starts disclosing his past.\n\nChetan is a penniless poet while Sunita is the daughter of a wealthy man (Kamal Kapoor). Both are very much in love. Chetan's close friend Bansi (Gurnam Singh) thinks Chetan should use his education to get a job to keep the creditors from his door, but Chetan wants to continue writing books and develop his habit of writing stories with Sunita's full support. Sunita fears to talk before her father. Her rich father has the reason for being a stubborn father too and that is that he was a poor man and his wife had died because he could not afford proper medical facilities for her only because he could not afford them and this has made him more ambitious in life. So Sunita's father has throughout his life concentrated more on building his house and earning more money for a secure future, but all this at the cost of a complete disconnect personally between him and Sunita.\n\nSunita's father decides to marry her to Gopal (Dheeraj Kumar), a doctor. Gopal and his mother (Sulochana Latkar) meet Sunita in her house for the first time and they like her. Her dad decides to announce their engagement at the birthday party. Meanwhile, Sunita urges Chetan to ask her hand from her father on her birthday and she invites him for that party. At the party her father is rude to Chetan and then announces her engagement to Gopal\u2014she swallows her anger in order to maintain a good front before the guests, but later goes in search of Chetan at his home.\n\nSunita tells Chetan that they should elope and go far away from her parents and live in a separate world of their own. Chetan asks why should they elope, instead they should go together to her father and tell him that they want to marry and that Chetan will take care of Sunita. Sunita does agree with him, but tells Chetan that this idea of his won't help as her father may attack or kill Chetan. To this, Chetan replies that its completely unethical to run away from problems and in this case, from her father as it would bring dishonour to Sunita and even to their own love story. Chetan promises that were her father to refuse to give his permission, they would marry anyway. So Chetan advises her to go back home and that Chetan would marry her after trying to convince her father. Chetan points out that society will disapprove and she might regret it someday. To this, Sunita declares that Chetan is cowardly and selfish and does not want to share a bit of sorrow that her parents did not approve of their relation and wouldn't take a risk by running away and starting a life together, when she left her wealth and family and came to him. Sunita says she did not think of anything except her love for Chetan and came running with her belongings to Chetan's house. That shows she is selfless in this love affair. So by this logic, she tells Chetan that she would now marry Gopal only as Chetan has belittled their love and her ability to make a choice.\n\nSunita marries Gopal and they live happily, but one day, she discloses to her husband that she was in love with a person in her college days. Gopal gets angry and hurt so starts drinking wine and confides his problem to a friend in the Mahinder bar and goes off to England for years to further his medical studies, abandoning Sunita to bring up their son Munna (Master Tito) and take care of his mother.\n\nChetan, meanwhile, channels his despair into writing and becomes critically renowned and popular; one of his biggest fans is Sunita's mother-in-law. His greatest work is a novel called ''Tyaag''\u2014the story of his romance with Sunita. Five years pass after Sunita's marriage and Gopal decides to return to India as he by now realises that Sunita is a good mother and a good daughter-in-law and so decides to mend their married life.\n\nSunit's child then runs away from home in search of his father and boards a train. There, he meets a passenger and he turns out to be Chetan. Chetan realises that the child is innocent and decides to lodge a police complaint. On this, the child being smart and hyperactive, decides to run away from him. But Chetan catches him and promises to him to take him to England. Munna agrees to go home now, provided that Chetan takes him home.\n\nSunita gets angry on seeing Chetan. She tries her best to throw him out of her life. The rest of the story is about the dilemma which Sunita faces. Will Chetan avenge his failed love affair with her in the past by destroying her present married life? Will Chetan avail of the opportunity of Gopal's absence to molest her? Is Chetan really in love with her child? What will happen to her life when her husband returns?\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Rajesh Khanna]] as Chetan\n* [[Sharmila Tagore]] as Sunita\n* [[Prem Chopra]] as Mahinder\n* [[Kamal Kapoor]] as Sharmila's father\n* [[Dheeraj Kumar]] as Gopal\n* [[Sulochana Latkar]] as Gopal's mother\n* [[Mukri]] as Mangal Dada\n* [[Murad (actor)|Murad]] as Police officer\n* [[Raza Murad]] as Jail inmate\n* [[Asit Sen (actor)|Asit Sen]]\n* [[Bindu (actress)|Bindu]] as Dancer\n* [[Tito Khatri (Master tito)]] as adolescent Pappu and later big one is Satyajeet Puri\n\n== Tracks list ==\n\n#  \"Hum Tum Tum Hum Hum Tum\" : [[Kishore Kumar]], [[Lata Mangeshkar]]\n#  \"Kore Kagaz Pe Likhvawe\" : [[Kishore Kumar]], [[Asha Bhosle]]\n#  \"Ek Raja Ka Ek Beta Tha\" : [[Kishore Kumar]]\n#  \"Mann Pukare\" : [[Kishore Kumar]], [[Lata Mangeshkar]]\n#  \"Tujhe Pyaas Hai Mere Paas Hai\" : [[Asha Bhosle]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* {{IMDb title|id=0275748}}\n\n[[Category:1977 films]]\n[[Category:Indian films]]\n[[Category:Indian family films]]\n[[Category:Indian drama films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by S.
