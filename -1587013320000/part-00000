{"title_page": "Postmodern picture book", "text_new": "{{Essay-like|date=December 2009}}\n{{Postmodernism}}\n'''Postmodern picture books''' are a specific [[genre]] of [[picture books]].  Characteristics of this unique type of book include [[Nonlinear (arts)|non-linear]] narrative forms in storybooks, books that are \"aware\" of themselves as books and include self-referential elements, and what is known as [[metafiction]].\n\nA classic example of this genre is [[David Macaulay]]'s award-winning ''[[Black and White (picture book)|Black and White]]'' (1990). This book consists of four \"separate\" sub-plots which are related, but the reader must decide in what way the story becomes meaningful.  The inside front cover of this book, awarded the Caldecott Medal in 1990, states: \"WARNING: This book appears to contain a number of stories that do not necessarily occur at the same time. But it may contain only one story. Then again, there may be four stories. Or four parts of a story. Careful inspection of both words and pictures is recommended.\"\n\nExamples of postmodern picture books include David Wiesner's ''The Three Pigs'', Anthony Browne's ''Voices in the Park'', and Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith's ''The Stinky Cheese Man''. Some books have unusual pictures that don't always mesh with the traditional, linear text (that often matches the pictures). An example would be ''Bamboozled'' by David Legge.\n\nFrank Serafini (2004) has created lesson plans that lead students to discuss how text interacts with illustrations. Three sets of texts could be discussed: books that have corresponding text and pictures, books where the illustrations enhance the texts, and books where the illustrations contradict the text (''Bamboozled'' is an example of contradictory text). Another lesson that Serafini describes that incorporates PM picture books could be having students read books that are ambiguous and allow for multiple interpretations. Student are encouraged to record their thinking in a journal called a \"walking notebook\". Books that are especially open to interpretation include: Browne's ''Voices in the Park'', Wiesner's ''The Three Pigs'', and David Macauley's ''Black and White''.\n\nThese books could be thought of as multi-modal texts that defy the usual, linear organization of storybooks. In postmodern, meta-fictive books, the reader is intentionally made aware of the way that the book calls attention to itself. For example, in Wiesner's ''The Three Pigs'', the main characters decide to climb outside the text; pictures depicting the pigs climbing outside the story are prominent.  In ''The Stinky Cheese Man'', Scieszka and Lane purposely use [[intertextual]] references, or references to many other well-known fables, to create tongue-in-cheek, satirical stories and spin-offs of classic fairy tales. Widely varying size fonts and pictures combine to create a post-modern picture book.\n\nAccording to Anstey (2002), characteristics of postmodern picture books include:\n\n# Non-traditional plot structure\n# Using the pictures or text to position the reader to read the text in a particular way, for example, through a character's eyes or point of view.\n# The reader's involvement with constructing the meaning of the text.\n# [[Intertextual]] references, which requires the reader to make connections to other books or knowledge, in order to better understand the text.\n# Varied design layout and a variety of styles of illustration.\n\nRyan & Anstey (2003) suggest that post-modern picture books may allow students to increase their \"self-knowledge about reading\" and that students might be able to use this knowledge in strategic ways as they read. In their study, Ryan and Anstey looked at how sixth graders responded to a PM picture book, which was selected because it was open to many interpretations, titled ''The Rabbits'' by [[John Marsden (writer)|John Marsden]] and [[Shaun Tan]]. They discovered that the reading of such texts allow students to draw upon their resources as readers. The reading of such books supports a [[multiliteracies]] perspective. Accordingly, such books may be useful in allowing teachers to use texts that encourage students to draw upon their own identity and use this knowledge to read strategically.\n\n==References==\n*Anstey, M.

Along with ''[[Zootopia]]'', it marked the first time since 2002 that Walt Disney Animation Studios released two feature films in the same year. It received two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations at the [[89th Academy Awards]]: one for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] and another for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] (\"[[How Far I'll Go]]\").<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/2017-oscar-nominations-academy-awards-nominees-1201968107/|title=Oscar Nominations: Complete List|date=January 24, 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Variety Media|location=Los Angeles|accessdate=January 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 and 700 words. Please do not add more material to this summary; instead, adjust what is already here. -->\nOn the [[Polynesia]]n island of Motunui, the inhabitants worship the goddess Te Fiti, who brought life to the ocean using a [[pounamu]] stone as her heart and the source of her power. [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|Maui]], the shape-shifting demigod and master of sailing, steals the heart to give humanity the power of creation. However, Te Fiti disintegrates, and Maui is attacked by another who seeks the heart: Te K\u0101, a volcanic demon. Maui is blasted out of the sky, losing both his magical giant [[fishhook]] and the heart to the depths of the sea.\n\nA millennium later, the ocean chooses Moana, daughter of Motunui's chief Tui, to return the heart to Te Fiti. Tui takes Moana away, causing her to lose the heart. Tui and Sina, Moana's mother, try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare her for ascension as the island's chief. Sixteen years later, a [[blight]] strikes the island, killing vegetation and shrinking the fish catch. Moana suggests going beyond the island's reef to find more fish and figure out what is happening, but Tui forbids it. Moana tries conquering the reef but is overpowered by the tides and shipwrecked back to Motunui with Pua the pig.\n\nMoana's grandmother, Tala, shows her a secret cave of ships, revealing that their people were voyagers until Maui stole Te Fiti's heart; the ocean was no longer safe without it. Tala explains that Te K\u0101's darkness is poisoning the island, but can be cured if Moana finds Maui and makes him restore the heart of Te Fiti, which she gives to Moana. Tala falls ill and, on her death bed, tells Moana that she must depart to find Maui.\n\nSetting sail on a [[camakau]] from the cavern, Moana is caught in a typhoon and shipwrecked on an island where she finds Maui, who boasts about his achievements. She demands that Maui return the heart, but he refuses and traps her in a cave. She escapes and confronts Maui, who reluctantly lets her on the camakau. They are attacked by Kakamora\u2014small, coconut-armored pirates\u2014who seek the heart, but Moana and Maui outwit them. Moana realizes Maui is no longer a hero since he stole the heart and cursed the world, and convinces him to redeem himself by returning the heart. Maui first needs to retrieve his magical [[fishhook]] in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, from Tamatoa, a giant [[coconut crab]]. While Moana distracts Tamatoa, Maui retrieves his hook but discovers he can no longer control his shape-shifting. He is overpowered by Tamatoa, but Moana's quick thinking allows them to escape with the hook. Maui reveals that his first tattoo was earned when his mortal parents rejected him. After reassurance from Moana, Maui teaches her the art of sailing, regaining control of his powers, and the two grow closer.\n\nThey arrive at Te Fiti's island, only to be attacked by Te K\u0101. Moana refuses to turn back, resulting in Maui's hook being badly damaged. Unwilling to lose his hook in another confrontation with Te K\u0101, Maui abandons Moana, who tearfully asks the ocean to find someone else to restore the heart. The ocean obliges and takes the heart, but Tala's spirit appears, inspiring Moana to find her true calling. She retrieves the heart and sails back to confront Te K\u0101. Maui returns, having had a change of heart, and buys Moana time to reach Te Fiti by fighting Te K\u0101, destroying his hook in the process. Moana discovers Te Fiti is missing, and realizes Te K\u0101 is Te Fiti, corrupted without her heart. Moana tells the ocean to clear a path, allowing her to return Te Fiti's heart, and the restored goddess heals the ocean and islands of the blight. Maui apologizes to Te Fiti, who restores his hook and gives Moana a new boat before falling into a deep sleep and becoming a mountain.\n\nMoana bids farewell to Maui, returning home where she reunites with her parents. She takes up her role as chief and [[Polynesian navigation|wayfinder]], leading her people as they resume voyaging.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Auli'i Cravalho December 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] at the film's premiere in [[Samoa]] in December 2016]]\n* [[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] as Moana of Motunui, the curious daughter of village chief Tui and his wife Sina, who is chosen by the ocean to restore the heart of Te Fiti\n** Cravalho reprised her role in the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian-language]] version of the movie.<ref name=\"instagram\">{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BbAOujigpkd/|title=Auli'i on Instagram: 'Aloha nui k\u0101kou!

animation|computer-animated]] [[Musical film|musical]] [[adventure film]] produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. It is the 56th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]]. Directed by [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]], co-directed by [[Don Hall (filmmaker)|Don Hall]] and [[Chris Williams (director)|Chris Williams]], the film introduces [[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] as Moana and features the voices of [[Dwayne Johnson]], [[Rachel House (actress)|Rachel House]], [[Temuera Morrison]], [[Jemaine Clement]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Alan Tudyk]]. The film features songs written by [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]], [[Te Vaka|Opetaia Foa'i]] and [[Mark Mancina]], and an orchestral score also composed by Mancina.\n\nThe film tells the story of [[Moana (Disney character)|Moana]], the strong-willed daughter of a chief of a [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] village, who is chosen by the ocean itself to reunite a mystical relic with the goddess Te Fiti. When a [[blight]] strikes her island, Moana sets sail in search of [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|Maui]], a legendary [[demigod]], in the hope of returning the relic to Te Fiti and saving her people.\n\n''Moana'' was released theatrically in the United States on November 23, 2016 to positive reviews from critics, with particular praise going towards its animation, music, and vocal performances. The film went on to gross over $690&nbsp;million worldwide. Along with ''[[Zootopia]]'', it marked the first time since 2002 that Walt Disney Animation Studios released two feature films in the same year. It received two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations at the [[89th Academy Awards]]: one for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] and another for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] (\"[[How Far I'll Go]]\").<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/2017-oscar-nominations-academy-awards-nominees-1201968107/|title=Oscar Nominations: Complete List|date=January 24, 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Variety Media|location=Los Angeles|accessdate=January 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 and 700 words. Please do not add more material to this summary; instead, adjust what is already here. -->\nOn the [[Polynesia]]n island of Motunui, the inhabitants worship the goddess Te Fiti, who brought life to the ocean using a [[pounamu]] stone as her heart and the source of her power. [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|Maui]], the shape-shifting demigod and master of sailing, steals the heart to give humanity the power of creation. However, Te Fiti disintegrates, and Maui is attacked by another who seeks the heart: Te K\u0101, a volcanic demon. Maui is blasted out of the sky, losing both his magical giant [[fishhook]] and the heart to the depths of the sea.\n\nA millennium later, the ocean chooses Moana, daughter of Motunui's chief Tui, to return the heart to Te Fiti. Tui takes Moana away, causing her to lose the heart. Tui and Sina, Moana's mother, try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare her for ascension as the island's chief. Sixteen years later, a [[blight]] strikes the island, killing vegetation and shrinking the fish catch. Moana suggests going beyond the island's reef to find more fish and figure out what is happening, but Tui forbids it. Moana tries conquering the reef but is overpowered by the tides and shipwrecked back to Motunui with Pua the pig.\n\nMoana's grandmother, Tala, shows her a secret cave of ships, revealing that their people were voyagers until Maui stole Te Fiti's heart; the ocean was no longer safe without it. Tala explains that Te K\u0101's darkness is poisoning the island, but can be cured if Moana finds Maui and makes him restore the heart of Te Fiti, which she gives to Moana. Tala falls ill and, on her death bed, tells Moana that she must depart to find Maui.\n\nSetting sail on a [[camakau]] from the cavern, Moana is caught in a typhoon and shipwrecked on an island where she finds Maui, who boasts about his achievements. She demands that Maui return the heart, but he refuses and traps her in a cave. She escapes and confronts Maui, who reluctantly lets her on the camakau. They are attacked by Kakamora\u2014small, coconut-armored pirates\u2014who seek the heart, but Moana and Maui outwit them. Moana realizes Maui is no longer a hero since he stole the heart and cursed the world, and convinces him to redeem himself by returning the heart. Maui first needs to retrieve his magical [[fishhook]] in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, from Tamatoa, a giant [[coconut crab]]. While Moana distracts Tamatoa, Maui retrieves his hook but discovers he can no longer control his shape-shifting. He is overpowered by Tamatoa, but Moana's quick thinking allows them to escape with the hook. Maui reveals that his first tattoo was earned when his mortal parents rejected him. After reassurance from Moana, Maui teaches her the art of sailing, regaining control of his powers, and the two grow closer.\n\nThey arrive at Te Fiti's island, only to be attacked by Te K\u0101. Moana refuses to turn back, resulting in Maui's hook being badly damaged. Unwilling to lose his hook in another confrontation with Te K\u0101, Maui abandons Moana, who tearfully asks the ocean to find someone else to restore the heart. The ocean obliges and takes the heart, but Tala's spirit appears, inspiring Moana to find her true calling. She retrieves the heart and sails back to confront Te K\u0101. Maui returns, having had a change of heart, and buys Moana time to reach Te Fiti by fighting Te K\u0101, destroying his hook in the process. Moana discovers Te Fiti is missing, and realizes Te K\u0101 is Te Fiti, corrupted without her heart. Moana tells the ocean to clear a path, allowing her to return Te Fiti's heart, and the restored goddess heals the ocean and islands of the blight. Maui apologizes to Te Fiti, who restores his hook and gives Moana a new boat before falling into a deep sleep and becoming a mountain.\n\nMoana bids farewell to Maui, returning home where she reunites with her parents. She takes up her role as chief and [[Polynesian navigation|wayfinder]], leading her people as they resume voyaging.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Auli'i Cravalho December 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] at the film's premiere in [[Samoa]] in December 2016]]\n* [[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] as Moana, the curious daughter of village chief Tui and his wife Sina, who is chosen by the ocean to restore the heart of Te Fiti\n** Cravalho reprised her role in the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian-language]] version of the movie.<ref name=\"instagram\">{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BbAOujigpkd/|title=Auli'i on Instagram: 'Aloha nui k\u0101kou!

The black eschar often shows up as a large, painless, [[necrotic]] ulcer (beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a black dot, somewhat resembling bread mold) at the site of infection. In general, cutaneous infections form within the site of spore penetration between two and five days after exposure. Unlike [[bruise]]s or most other lesions, cutaneous anthrax infections normally do not cause pain. Nearby lymph nodes may become infected, reddened, swollen, and painful. A scab forms over the lesion soon, and falls off in a few weeks.

The etiology of anthrax, based on the ontogenesis of ''Bacillus anthracis''], Cohns</ref> The bacterium normally rests in spore form in the soil, and can survive for decades in this state. Herbivores are often infected while grazing, especially when eating rough, irritant, or spiky vegetation; the vegetation has been hypothesized to cause wounds within the GI tract, permitting entry of the bacterial spores into the tissues, though this has not been proven. Once ingested or placed in an open wound, the bacteria begin multiplying inside the animal or human and typically kill the host within a few days or weeks. The spores germinate at the site of entry into the tissues and then spread by the circulation to the lymphatics, where the bacteria multiply.\n\nThe production of two powerful exotoxins and lethal toxin by the bacteria causes death. Veterinarians can often tell a possible anthrax-induced death by its sudden occurrence, and by the dark, nonclotting blood that oozes from the body orifices. Most anthrax bacteria inside the body after death are outcompeted and destroyed by anaerobic bacteria within minutes to hours ''post mortem''. However, anthrax vegetative bacteria that escape the body via oozing blood or through the opening of the carcass may form hardy spores. These vegetative bacteria are not contagious.<ref name=Liu>{{cite journal |title=Formation and Composition of the ''Bacillus anthracis'' Endospore |author1=Hongbin Liu |author2=Nicholas H.

The triggers for spore formation are not yet known, though oxygen tension and lack of nutrients may play roles. Once formed, these spores are very hard to eradicate.\n\nThe infection of herbivores (and occasionally humans) by the inhalational route normally proceeds as: Once the spores are inhaled, they are transported through the air passages into the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. The spores are then picked up by scavenger cells ([[macrophage]]s) in the lungs and are transported through small vessels ([[lymphatic system|lymphatics]]) to the [[lymph nodes]] in the central chest cavity ([[mediastinum]]). Damage caused by the anthrax spores and bacilli to the central chest cavity can cause chest pain and difficulty in breathing. Once in the lymph nodes, the spores germinate into active bacilli that multiply and eventually burst the macrophages, releasing many more bacilli into the bloodstream to be transferred to the entire body. Once in the blood stream, these bacilli release three proteins named [[Anthrax lethal factor endopeptidase|lethal factor]], edema factor, and protective antigen. The three are not toxic by themselves, but their combination is incredibly lethal to humans.<ref name=Pimental04>{{cite journal |last=Pimental |first=RA |last2=Christensen |first2=KA |last3=Krantz |first3=BA |last4=Collier |first4=RJ |title=Anthrax toxin complexes: heptameric protective antigen can bind lethal factor and edema factor simultaneously |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=322 |issue=1 |pages=258\u201362 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15313199 |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.07.105}}</ref> Protective antigen combines with these other two factors to form lethal toxin and edema toxin, respectively.

Anthrax toxin is a mixture of three [[proteins|protein]] components: protective [[antigen]] (PA), [[edema]] factor (EF), and lethal factor (LF).<ref name=toxin>{{cite web |url=http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/anthrax/ |title=Molecular Basis for Anthrax Intoxication |author=Mu Gao |date=27 April 2006 |publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |accessdate=26 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226202812/http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/anthrax/ |archivedate=26 December 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> PA plus LF produces lethal toxin, and PA plus EF produces edema toxin. These toxins cause death and tissue swelling ([[edema]]), respectively.\n\nTo enter the cells, the edema and lethal factors use another protein produced by ''B. anthracis'' called protective antigen, which binds to two surface receptors on the host cell. A cell [[protease]] then cleaves PA into two fragments: PA<sub>20</sub> and PA<sub>63</sub>. PA<sub>20</sub> dissociates into the extracellular medium, playing no further role in the toxic cycle. PA<sub>63</sub> then oligomerizes with six other PA<sub>63</sub> fragments forming a heptameric ring-shaped structure named a prepore. Once in this shape, the complex can competitively bind up to three EFs or LFs, forming a resistant complex.<ref name=\"Pimental04\"/> Receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs next, providing the newly formed toxic complex access to the interior of the host cell. The acidified environment within the endosome triggers the heptamer to release the LF and/or EF into the cytosol.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chvyrkova |first=I |last2=Zhang |first2=XC |last3=Terzyan |first3=S |title=Lethal Factor of Anthrax Toxin Binds Monomeric Form of Protective Antigen |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=360 |issue=3 |pages=690\u20135 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17617379 |pmc=1986636 |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.06.124}}</ref> It is unknown how exactly the complex results in the death of the cell.\n\nEdema factor is a [[calmodulin]]-dependent [[adenylate cyclase]]. Adenylate cyclase catalyzes the conversion of ATP into [[cyclic AMP]] (cAMP) and [[pyrophosphate]]. The complexation of adenylate cyclase with [[calmodulin]] removes calmodulin from stimulating calcium-triggered signaling, thus inhibiting the immune response.<ref name=\"Pimental04\"/> To be specific, LF inactivates [[neutrophil]]s (a type of phagocytic cell) by the process just described so they cannot phagocytose bacteria. Throughout history, lethal factor was presumed to cause macrophages to make [[TNF-alpha]] and [[IL1B|interleukin 1, beta]] (IL1B). TNF-alpha is a [[cytokine]] whose primary role is to regulate immune cells, as well as to induce inflammation and [[apoptosis]] or programmed cell death. Interleukin 1, beta is another cytokine that also regulates inflammation and apoptosis. The overproduction of TNF-alpha and IL1B ultimately leads to [[septic shock]] and death. However, recent evidence indicates anthrax also targets endothelial cells that line serous cavities such as the [[pericardial cavity]], [[pleural cavity]], and [[peritoneal cavity]], lymph vessels, and blood vessels, causing vascular leakage of fluid and cells, and ultimately [[hypovolemic shock]] and septic shock.\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nVarious techniques may be used for the direct identification of ''B. anthracis'' in clinical material. Firstly, specimens may be [[Gram stain]]ed. ''Bacillus'' spp. are quite large in size (3 to 4&nbsp;\u03bcm long), they may grow in long chains, and they stain Gram-positive. To confirm the organism is ''B. anthracis'', rapid diagnostic techniques such as [[polymerase chain reaction]]-based assays and [[Immunofluorescence|immunofluorescence microscopy]] may be used.<ref>{{cite book |last=Levinson |first=W. |title=Review of Medical Microbiology and Immunology |year=2010 |edition=11th}}</ref>\n\nAll ''Bacillus'' species grow well on 5% sheep blood agar and other routine culture media. Polymyxin-lysozyme-EDTA-thallous acetate can be used to isolate ''B. anthracis'' from contaminated specimens, and bicarbonate agar is used as an identification method to induce capsule formation. ''Bacillus'' spp. usually grow within 24 hours of incubation at 35&nbsp;\u00b0C, in ambient air (room temperature) or in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. If bicarbonate agar is used for identification, then the medium must be incubated in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. ''B. anthracis'' colonies are medium-large, gray, flat, and irregular with swirling projections, often referred to as having a \"[[Medusa|medusa head]]\" appearance, and are not hemolytic on 5% sheep blood agar. The bacteria are not motile, susceptible to penicillin, and produce a wide zone of lecithinase on egg yolk agar. Confirmatory testing to identify ''B. anthracis'' includes gamma bacteriophage testing, indirect hemagglutination, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect antibodies.<ref>{{cite book |last=Forbes |first=B.

In a groundbreaking series of experiments, he uncovered the lifecycle and means of transmission of anthrax. His experiments not only helped create an understanding of anthrax, but also helped elucidate the role of microbes in causing illness at a time when debates still took place over [[spontaneous generation#Spontaneous generation|spontaneous generation]] versus [[cell theory]]. Koch went on to study the mechanisms of other diseases and won the 1905 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his discovery of the bacterium causing tuberculosis.\n\nAlthough Koch arguably made the greatest theoretical contribution to understanding anthrax, other researchers were more concerned with the practical questions of how to prevent the disease. In Britain, where anthrax affected workers in the wool, [[worsted]], [[hide (skin)|hide]]s, and [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] industries, it was viewed with fear. [[John Henry Bell]], a doctor based in [[Bradford]], first made the link between the mysterious and deadly \"woolsorter's disease\" and anthrax, showing in 1878 that they were one and the same.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=M|first1=J|title=John Henry Bell, M.D., M.R.C.S|journal=British Medical Journal|date=22 September 1906|pages=735\u20136|pmc=2382239|volume=2|issue=2386|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.2386.735}}</ref> In the early 20th century, [[Friederich Wilhelm Eurich]], the [[Germans|German]] [[bacteriology|bacteriologist]] who settled in Bradford with his family as a child, carried out important research for the local Anthrax Investigation Board.

He prepared two groups of 25 [[sheep]], one [[goat]], and several [[cow|cattle]]. The animals of one group were injected with an anthrax vaccine prepared by Pasteur twice, at an interval of 15 days; the control group was left unvaccinated.

Carcasses may also be buried, though the burying of large animals deeply enough to prevent resurfacing of spores requires much manpower and expensive tools. Carcasses have been soaked in formaldehyde to kill spores, though this has environmental contamination issues. Block burning of vegetation in large areas enclosing an anthrax outbreak has been tried; this, while environmentally destructive, causes healthy animals to move away from an area with carcasses in search of fresh grass. Some wildlife workers have experimented with covering fresh anthrax carcasses with shadecloth and heavy objects. This prevents some scavengers from opening the carcasses, thus allowing the putrefactive bacteria within the carcass to kill the vegetative ''B. anthracis'' cells and preventing sporulation. This method also has drawbacks, as scavengers such as hyenas are capable of infiltrating almost any exclosure.\n\nThe experimental site at [[Gruinard Island]] is said to have been decontaminated with a mixture of formaldehyde and seawater by the Ministry of Defence.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/scotland/1457035.stm |title=Britain's 'Anthrax Island' |date=25 July 2001 |newspaper=BBC News |accessdate=26 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226205629/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/scotland/1457035.stm |archivedate=26 December 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> It is not clear whether similar treatments had been applied to US test sites.\n\n=== Biological warfare ===\n[[File:Powell-anthrax-vial.jpg|thumb|[[Colin Powell]] giving a presentation to the [[United Nations Security Council]], holding a model vial of anthrax]]\nAnthrax spores have been used as a [[biological warfare]] weapon.

The etiology of anthrax, based on the ontogenesis of ''Bacillus anthracis''], Cohns</ref> The bacterium normally rests in spore form in the soil, and can survive for decades in this state. Herbivores are often infected whilst grazing, especially when eating rough, irritant, or spiky vegetation; the vegetation has been hypothesized to cause wounds within the GI tract, permitting entry of the bacterial spores into the tissues, though this has not been proven. Once ingested or placed in an open wound, the bacteria begin multiplying inside the animal or human and typically kill the host within a few days or weeks. The spores germinate at the site of entry into the tissues and then spread by the circulation to the lymphatics, where the bacteria multiply.\n\nThe production of two powerful exotoxins and lethal toxin by the bacteria causes death. Veterinarians can often tell a possible anthrax-induced death by its sudden occurrence, and by the dark, nonclotting blood that oozes from the body orifices. Most anthrax bacteria inside the body after death are outcompeted and destroyed by anaerobic bacteria within minutes to hours ''post mortem''. However, anthrax vegetative bacteria that escape the body via oozing blood or through the opening of the carcass may form hardy spores. These vegetative bacteria are not contagious.<ref name=Liu>{{cite journal |title=Formation and Composition of the ''Bacillus anthracis'' Endospore |author1=Hongbin Liu |author2=Nicholas H.

The triggers for spore formation are not yet known, though oxygen tension and lack of nutrients may play roles. Once formed, these spores are very hard to eradicate.\n\nThe infection of herbivores (and occasionally humans) by the inhalational route normally proceeds as: Once the spores are inhaled, they are transported through the air passages into the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. The spores are then picked up by scavenger cells ([[macrophage]]s) in the lungs and are transported through small vessels ([[lymphatic system|lymphatics]]) to the [[lymph nodes]] in the central chest cavity ([[mediastinum]]). Damage caused by the anthrax spores and bacilli to the central chest cavity can cause chest pain and difficulty in breathing. Once in the lymph nodes, the spores germinate into active bacilli that multiply and eventually burst the macrophages, releasing many more bacilli into the bloodstream to be transferred to the entire body. Once in the blood stream, these bacilli release three proteins named [[Anthrax lethal factor endopeptidase|lethal factor]], edema factor, and protective antigen. The three are not toxic by themselves, but their combination is incredibly lethal to humans.<ref name=Pimental04>{{cite journal |last=Pimental |first=RA |last2=Christensen |first2=KA |last3=Krantz |first3=BA |last4=Collier |first4=RJ |title=Anthrax toxin complexes: heptameric protective antigen can bind lethal factor and edema factor simultaneously |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=322 |issue=1 |pages=258\u201362 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15313199 |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.07.105}}</ref> Protective antigen combines with these other two factors to form lethal toxin and edema toxin, respectively.

A cell [[protease]] then cleaves PA into two fragments: PA<sub>20</sub> and PA<sub>63</sub>. PA<sub>20</sub> dissociates into the extracellular medium, playing no further role in the toxic cycle.

Adenylate cyclase catalyzes the conversion of ATP into [[cyclic AMP]] (cAMP) and [[pyrophosphate]]. The complexation of adenylate cyclase with [[calmodulin]] removes calmodulin from stimulating calcium-triggered signaling, thus inhibiting the immune response.<ref name=\"Pimental04\"/> To be specific, LF inactivates [[neutrophil]]s (a type of phagocytic cell) by the process just described so they cannot phagocytose bacteria. Throughout history, lethal factor was presumed to cause macrophages to make [[TNF-alpha]] and [[IL1B|interleukin 1, beta]] (IL1B). TNF-alpha is a [[cytokine]] whose primary role is to regulate immune cells, as well as to induce inflammation and [[apoptosis]] or programmed cell death. Interleukin 1, beta is another cytokine that also regulates inflammation and apoptosis. The overproduction of TNF-alpha and IL1B ultimately leads to [[septic shock]] and death. However, recent evidence indicates anthrax also targets endothelial cells that line serous cavities such as the [[pericardial cavity]], [[pleural cavity]], and [[peritoneal cavity]], lymph vessels, and blood vessels, causing vascular leakage of fluid and cells, and ultimately [[hypovolemic shock]] and septic shock.\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nVarious techniques may be used for the direct identification of ''B. anthracis'' in clinical material. Firstly, specimens may be [[Gram stain]]ed. ''Bacillus'' spp. are quite large in size (3 to 4&nbsp;\u03bcm long), they may grow in long chains, and they stain Gram-positive. To confirm the organism is ''B. anthracis'', rapid diagnostic techniques such as [[polymerase chain reaction]]-based assays and [[Immunofluorescence|immunofluorescence microscopy]] may be used.<ref>{{cite book |last=Levinson |first=W. |title=Review of Medical Microbiology and Immunology |year=2010 |edition=11th}}</ref>\n\nAll ''Bacillus'' species grow well on 5% sheep blood agar and other routine culture media. Polymyxin-lysozyme-EDTA-thallous acetate can be used to isolate ''B. anthracis'' from contaminated specimens, and bicarbonate agar is used as an identification method to induce capsule formation. ''Bacillus'' spp. usually grow within 24 hours of incubation at 35&nbsp;\u00b0C, in ambient air (room temperature) or in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. If bicarbonate agar is used for identification, then the medium must be incubated in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. ''B. anthracis'' colonies are medium-large, gray, flat, and irregular with swirling projections, often referred to as having a \"[[Medusa|medusa head]]\" appearance, and are not hemolytic on 5% sheep blood agar. The bacteria are not motile, susceptible to penicillin, and produce a wide zone of lecithinase on egg yolk agar. Confirmatory testing to identify ''B. anthracis'' includes gamma bacteriophage testing, indirect hemagglutination, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect antibodies.<ref>{{cite book |last=Forbes |first=B.

In response to the anthrax attacks of October 2001, the [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) installed biodetection systems (BDSs) in their large-scale mail processing facilities. BDS response plans were formulated by the USPS in conjunction with local responders including fire, police, hospitals, and public health. Employees of these facilities have been educated about anthrax, response actions, and [[prophylaxis|prophylactic]] medication.

In a groundbreaking series of experiments, he uncovered the lifecycle and means of transmission of anthrax.

Koch went on to study the mechanisms of other diseases and won the 1905 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his discovery of the bacterium causing tuberculosis.\n\nAlthough Koch arguably made the greatest theoretical contribution to understanding anthrax, other researchers were more concerned with the practical questions of how to prevent the disease.

Carcasses may also be buried, though the burying of large animals deeply enough to prevent resurfacing of spores requires much manpower and expensive tools. Carcasses have been soaked in formaldehyde to kill spores, though this has environmental contamination issues. Block burning of vegetation in large areas enclosing an anthrax outbreak has been tried; this, while environmentally destructive, causes healthy animals to move away from an area with carcasses in search of fresh grass. Some wildlife workers have experimented with covering fresh anthrax carcasses with shadecloth and heavy objects. This prevents some scavengers from opening the carcasses, thus allowing the putrefactive bacteria within the carcass to kill the vegetative ''B. anthracis'' cells and preventing sporulation.
