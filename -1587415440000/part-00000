After moving to New York City in 1908, she made her Broadway debut the same year in ''The Devil''.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n==Career==\nMost of Bara's early films were shot along the East Coast, where the film industry was centered at that time, primarily at the [[Fox Studios]] in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fort Lee: Birthplace of the Motion Picture Industry|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ViR3b72xkK0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fort+Lee:+Birthplace+of+the+Motion+Picture+Industry#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=978-0-7385-4501-1}}</ref>\n\nBara lived with her family in New York City during this time. The rise of Hollywood as the center of the American film industry forced her to relocate to Los Angeles to film the epic ''[[Cleopatra (1917 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1917), which became one of Bara's biggest hits.

Her final Fox film was ''The Lure of Ambition'' (1919). In 1920, she turned briefly to the stage, appearing on Broadway in ''[[The Blue Flame (play)|The Blue Flame]]''.

In promoting the 1917 film ''[[Cleopatra (1917 film)|Cleopatra]]'', Fox Studio publicists noted that the name was an anagram of ''Arab death'', and her press agents, to enhance her exotic appeal to moviegoers, falsely promoted the young Ohio native as \"the daughter of an Arab sheik and a French woman, born in the [[Sahara]].\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/87424/Cleopatra/overview|title=Cleopatra (1917)|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=May 29, 2011}} Film review.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qYEtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WZkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=7227,1426917&dq=arab-death+theda-bara&hl=en|title=Famous Silent Screen Vamp Theda Bara Dies Of Cancer|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=April 8, 1955|access-date=May 29, 2011}}</ref> In 1917, the Goodman family legally changed its surname to Bara.<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\n==Persona==\nBara was known for wearing very revealing costumes in her films. Such outfits were banned from Hollywood films after the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]] (a.k.a. the Hays Code) started in 1930, and then was more strongly enforced in 1934. It was popular at that time to promote an actress as mysterious, with an exotic background. The studios promoted Bara with a massive publicity campaign, billing her as the Egyptian-born daughter of a French actress and an Italian sculptor. They claimed she had spent her early years in the Sahara desert under the shadow of the [[Sphinx]], then moved to France to become a stage actress. (In fact, Bara never had been to Egypt, and her time in France amounted to just a few months.) They called her the \"Serpent of the Nile\" and encouraged her to discuss mysticism and the occult in interviews. Some film historians point to this as the birth of two Hollywood phenomena: the studio publicity department and the press agent (later evolving into the public relations person).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nA 2016 book by Joan Craig with Beverly F.

Such outfits were banned from Hollywood films after the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]] (a.k.a. the Hays Code) started in 1930, and then was more strongly enforced in 1934. It was popular at that time to promote an actress as mysterious, with an exotic background. The studios promoted Bara with a massive publicity campaign, billing her as the Egyptian-born daughter of a French actress and an Italian sculptor. They claimed she had spent her early years in the Sahara desert under the shadow of the [[Sphinx]], then moved to France to become a stage actress. (In fact, Bara never had been to Egypt, and her time in France amounted to just a few months.) They called her the \"Serpent of the Nile\" and encouraged her to discuss mysticism and the occult in interviews. Some film historians point to this as the birth of two Hollywood phenomena: the studio publicity department and the press agent (later evolving into the public relations person).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nA 2016 book, by Joan Craig with Beverly F.

He is supposed to have become a bandit after the death of his parents, which he attributed to their poverty. During Malverde\u2019s youth, railroads arrived. He witnessed his community undergo rapid socioeconomic transformation.  The profits of hacienda agriculture were enjoyed by the few elite, while the vast majority of the population, the peasantry, faced even greater economic strain. Jes\u00fas Malverde is said to have been a carpenter, tailor or railway worker.<ref> Kingsbury, Kate and Chesnut, R.

His nickname Malverde (evil-green) was given by his wealthy victims, deriving from an association between green and misfortune.<ref name = \"dry\"/> \n\nAccording to the mythology of Malverde's life, Ca\u00f1edo derisively offered Malverde a pardon if he could steal the governor's sword (or in some versions his daughter). The bandit succeeded, but this only pushed Ca\u00f1edo into hunting him down. He is supposed to have died in Sinaloa on May 3rd 1909. Accounts of his death vary. In some versions he was betrayed and killed by a friend. In others he was shot or hanged by local police.<ref name = \"dry\"/> His body was supposed to have been denied proper burial, being left to rot in public as an example.\n\nWriter [[Sam Quinones]] says that there is no evidence that the Malverde of the legend ever lived, and that the story probably emerged by mixing material from the lives of two documented Sinaloan bandits, [[Heraclio Bernal]] (1855\u20131888) and [[Felipe Bachomo]] (1883\u20131916).<ref name = \"qw\">Quinones, Sam, ''True Tales from Another Mexico: The Lynch Mob, the Popsicle Kings, Chalino, and the Bronx'', UNM Press, 2001, p.227</ref> Bernal was a thief from southern Sinaloa who later became an anti-government rebel. Ca\u00f1edo offered a reward for his capture, and he was betrayed and killed by former colleagues. Bachomo was an indigenous Indian rebel from northern Sinaloa who was captured and executed.\n\n==Cult==\n[[File:Jes\u00fas Malverde.JPG|thumb|Jes\u00fas Malverde culture.]]\nSince Malverde's supposed death, he has earned a [[Robin Hood]]-type image, making him popular among [[Sinaloa]]'s poor highland residents. His bones were said to have been unofficially buried by local people, who threw stones onto them, creating a [[cairn]].

He is supposed to have become a bandit after the death of his parents, which he attributed to their poverty. During Malverde\u2019s youth, railroads arrived. He witnessed his community undergo rapid socioeconomic transformation.  The profits of hacienda agriculture were enjoyed by the few elite, while the vast majority of the population, the peasantry, faced even greater economic strain. Jes\u00fas Malverde is said to have been a carpenter, tailor or railway worker <ref> Kingsbury, Kate and Chesnut, R. Andrew 2019, \u2018Narcosaint\u2019 Jes\u00fas Malverde Miraculously Materializes at Trial of El Chapo Guzman by Kingsbury and Chesnut, Global Catholic Review </ref>. It was not until his parents died of either hunger or a curable disease (depending on the version of the story) that Jes\u00fas Malverde turned to a life of banditry. His nickname Malverde (evil-green) was given by his wealthy victims, deriving from an association between green and misfortune.<ref name = \"dry\"/> \n\nAccording to the mythology of Malverde's life, Ca\u00f1edo derisively offered Malverde a pardon if he could steal the governor's sword (or in some versions his daughter). The bandit succeeded, but this only pushed Ca\u00f1edo into hunting him down. He is supposed to have died in Sinaloa on May 3rd 1909. Accounts of his death vary. In some versions he was betrayed and killed by a friend. In others he was shot or hanged by local police.<ref name = \"dry\"/> His body was supposed to have been denied proper burial, being left to rot in public as an example.\n\nWriter [[Sam Quinones]] says that there is no evidence that the Malverde of the legend ever lived, and that the story probably emerged by mixing material from the lives of two documented Sinaloan bandits, [[Heraclio Bernal]] (1855\u20131888) and [[Felipe Bachomo]] (1883\u20131916).<ref name = \"qw\">Quinones, Sam, ''True Tales from Another Mexico: The Lynch Mob, the Popsicle Kings, Chalino, and the Bronx'', UNM Press, 2001, p.227</ref> Bernal was a thief from southern Sinaloa who later became an anti-government rebel. Ca\u00f1edo offered a reward for his capture, and he was betrayed and killed by former colleagues. Bachomo was an indigenous Indian rebel from northern Sinaloa who was captured and executed.\n\n==Cult==\n[[File:Jes\u00fas Malverde.JPG|thumb|Jes\u00fas Malverde culture.]]\nSince Malverde's supposed death, he has earned a [[Robin Hood]]-type image, making him popular among [[Sinaloa]]'s poor highland residents.

Hailing from [[uptown New Orleans]], the group was noted for their intricate harmonies and rhythmic experimentation. They attained national prominence in the United States in the 1930s during the twilight years of the [[Jazz Age]] and the onset of the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=297}} \n\nWhen the trio formally split in 1936, Connie continued as a solo vocalist in [[radio]], [[film]], and later [[television]] for an additional quarter of a century.{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=297}} The trio's \"unique singing style and ground-breaking arrangements fused 'blackness' and 'whiteness' in music,\" and their collaborations with \"the preeminent white swing musicians of their day\u2014the [[Dorsey Brothers]], [[Glenn Miller]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Artie Shaw]]\u2014had a profound effect on the development of the big band sound in the 1930s.\"{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=297}} When assessing their legacy, scholars claim the Boswell Sisters \"made 'real' jazz commercially viable, destigmatizing the music and opening its appreciation to the wider American public.\"{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=298}}\n\n== Early life and education ==\n[[Image:UptownCampStBoswellSistersHouse.jpg|left|thumb|House on Camp Street in [[uptown New Orleans]] where the Boswell Sisters grew up.]]\nMartha and Connie{{efn|name=Connee}} were born in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. Helvetia was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. Born to a former vaudevillian, Clyde \"A. C.\" Boswell,{{sfn|Titus|2014|pp=22\u201323}} and his music-loving wife, Meldania, the sisters\u2014along with their 14-year-old brother Clyde Jr. (\"Clydie\")\u2014landed in New Orleans as children, in 1914.{{sfn|Titus|2014|p=32}} The sisters were raised in a middle-class family at 3937 Camp Street in [[uptown New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].{{sfn|Titus|2014|p=33}} \n\nMartha, Connie, and Vet studied classical piano, cello, and violin, respectively, under the tutelage of [[Tulane University]] professor Otto Finck.{{sfn|Register|1918}}{{sfn|Titus|2014|p=40}} They performed their classical repertoire in local recitals, often as a trio, but the city's jazz scene swiftly won them over, personally and professionally. \"We studied classical music . . . and were being prepared for the stage and a concert tour throughout the United States, but the saxophone got us,\" Martha said in a 1925 interview with the ''Shreveport Times''.{{sfn|Shreveport Times|1925}}\n\nIn addition to providing the young Boswells with formal, classical musical education, Meldania Boswell took her children regularly to see the leading African\u2013American performers of the day at the [[Lyric Theatre (Kansas City, Missouri)|Lyric Theatre]].{{sfn|Titus|2014|p=47}} There, young Connie heard [[Mamie Smith]], whose \"[[Crazy Blues]]\" (1920), the first blues record performed by an African American, was a hit. Connie would later imitate Smith's style on the Boswells' first record, \"I'm Gonna Cry (Cryin' Blues),\" before settling into her own vocal style.{{sfn|Manilla|2006}}{{sfn|Sampson|1980|p=1431}} In interviews, the sisters recalled driving around New Orleans listening for new and interesting sounds, which they often found outside African\u2013American churches and barrooms.\n\nAs their older brother Clydie began breaking away from classical music to study jazz, he introduced his sisters to the new syncopated style and to many of the young jazz players in New Orleans.{{sfn|Titus|2014|p=47}} [[Leon Roppolo]] (clarinet, guitar), [[Monk Hazel]] (drums, cornet), Pinky Vidacovich (clarinet, saxophone), [[Nappy Lamare]] (guitar, banjo), [[Ray Bauduc]] (tuba, vocals), Dan LeBlanc (tuba), [[Leon Prima]] (trumpet), [[Louis Prima]] (trumpet, vocals), [[Wingy Manone]] (trumpet, vocals), [[Al Gallodoro]] (clarinet, saxophone), [[Chink Martin]] (bass, tuba, guitar), [[Santo Pecora]] (trombone), [[Raymond Burke (clarinetist)|Raymond Burke]] (clarinet, saxophone), and [[Tony Parenti]] (clarinet, saxophone) were regular guests at the Boswell home. The sisters were particularly influenced by the cornetist [[Emmett Hardy|Emmett Louis Hardy]], another friend of Clydie's, whose well-documented talent and skill helped shape the sisters' knowledge of jazz harmony, syncopation, and improvisation. Hardy and Clydie both died young and unrecorded, Hardy of [[tuberculosis]] at age 22 and Clydie of [[flu]]-related complications at 18.\n\nAfter becoming interested in jazz, Vet took up the banjo and Connie the saxophone. Martha continued playing the piano but focused on the rhythms and idioms of [[ragtime]] and [[Dixieland|hot jazz]].\n\n== Career ==\n=== New Orleans ===\n[[Image:Boswell Sisters 1932.jpg|thumb|right|The Boswell Sisters in March 1932.

This arrangement served to disguise Connie's inability to walk, a condition whose source has never been fully confirmed. A childhood bout with [[polio]]{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=318}} and a go-cart accident are the two main hypotheses, and Connie backed up both of them in various media sources. One theory holds that Meldania crafted the go-cart accident story in order to spare her daughter the stigma attached to the disease.{{sfn|Vitty|2012}}\n\n=== West Coast ===\nIn 1925 they made their first record for the [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor Records]]. After touring with a vaudeville company through [[Arkansas]], [[Texas]], and [[Oklahoma]], the sisters arrived in [[Los Angeles]] in October 1929, mere weeks after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash]] which marked the beginning of the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=301}} They appeared on radio programs, recorded music for films, and undertook several recordings for [[OKeh Records]], recorded in Los Angeles in 1930. However, the unique approach of the trio to reworking melodies and their improvisational style did not garner universal acclamation.{{sfn|Stras|2009|pp=301\u2013302}} \n\nIn their inaugural year of radio broadcasting in California, \"station employers received letters of opprobrium from outraged listeners voicing disapproval of the sisters' new and unusual arranging and singing styles.{{sfn|Stras|2009|pp=301\u2013302}} One letter stated: \"Why don't you choke those Boswell Sisters? How wonderful it would be if they sang just one song like it was written. Really when they get through murdering it, one can never recognize the original.\"{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=301}} Another outraged letter from an angry listener read: \"Please get those terrible Boswell Sisters off the station! You can't follow the melody and the beat is going too rapidly. And to me they sound like savage chanters!\"{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=320}}\n\n=== East Coast ===\nAfter relocating to [[New York City]] in 1930, the Boswell Sisters soon attained national attention and began making national radio broadcasts. The trio had a program on [[CBS]] from 1931 to 1933.{{sfn|Dunning|1998|p=110}} They soon signed a contract with [[Brunswick Records]] and made recordings from 1931 to 1935 under the aegis of producer [[Jack Kapp]].{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=302}} These Brunswick recordings are widely regarded as milestone recordings of vocal jazz.{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=302}} For their Brunswick recordings, \"the Boswells took greater liberties, regularly changing style, tempi, modality, lyrics, time signatures and voicings (both instrumental and vocal) to create unexpected textures and effects.\"{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=302}} \n\nConnee's reworkings of the melodies and rhythms of popular songs, together with [[Glenn Miller]]'s arrangements and New York jazz musicians (including the [[The Dorsey Brothers|Dorsey Brothers]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Bunny Berigan]], [[Fulton McGrath]], [[Joe Venuti]], [[Arthur Schutt]], [[Eddie Lang]], [[Joe Tarto]], [[Mannie Klein]], [[Dick McDonough]], and [[Carl Kress]]), made these recordings unlike any others. Melodies were rearranged and slowed down, major keys were changed to minor keys (sometimes in mid-song), and unexpected rhythmic changes were par for the course. They were among the few performers who were allowed to make changes to current popular tunes since, during this era, music publishers and record companies pressured performers not to alter current popular song arrangements.{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=302}} Connee also recorded a series of more conventional solo records for Brunswick during the same period.\n\n=== Popular success ===\nThe Boswell Sisters soon appeared in films during this time. They sang the lively \"Shout, Sister, Shout\" (1931), written by [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]], in the 1932 film ''[[The Big Broadcast]]'', which featured [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Cab Calloway]].{{efn|name=Boardwalk Empire|The song was also featured in the television show ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'', Season 5 Episode 5.}} The song\u2014one of the sisters' signature tunes\u2014was described in a November 2011 issue of the music magazine ''Mojo'' as \"by no means as archaic as its age.\" They sang their 1934 song \"Rock and Roll\" in the film ''[[Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round]]'', bringing with them an early use of the phrase ''rock 'n' roll'', referring in the song to \"the rolling rocking rhythm of the sea\". \n\nThe Boswell Sisters chalked up 20 hits during the 1930s, including the number-one record \"The Object of My Affection\" (1935). (Of special note is their involvement in a handful of 12\" medley/concert recordings made by [[Red Nichols]], [[Victor Young]] and [[Don Redman]] and their 1934 recording of \"[[Darktown Strutters' Ball]]\", which was issued only in Australia.) They also completed two successful tours of Europe, appeared on the inaugural television broadcast of [[CBS]], and performed on ''Hello, Europe'', the first internationally broadcast radio program.\n\nThe Boswell Sisters were among radio's earliest stars, making them one of the first hit acts of the mass-entertainment age. In 1934, the Sisters appeared 13 times on the [[Bing Crosby Entertains]] radio show on CBS. They were featured in fan magazines, and their likenesses were used in advertisements for beauty and household products.{{sfn|Cave|Titus|2014}} During the early 1930s the Boswell Sisters, [[Three X Sisters]], and [[Pickens Sisters]] were the talk of early radio female harmonizing. The [[Andrews Sisters]] started out as imitators of the Boswell Sisters.{{sfn|Berkvist|2013}} Young [[Ella Fitzgerald]] loved the Boswell Sisters and in particular idolized Connee, after whose singing style she patterned her own.{{sfn|Nicholson|2014|pp=10\u201312}}\n\nIn 1936, the group signed to Decca, but after just three records they broke up. The last recording was February 12, 1936. Approximately one month earlier, Martha Boswell had married Major [[George Lloyd (RAF officer)|George L. Lloyd]] of Britain's [[Royal Air Force]]. Connie served as her sister's only attendant at the wedding and [[Harold J. Warner]] served as their best man.{{sfn|New York Times|1936}} Lloyd was the managing director of the Aero Insurance Underwriters in New York.{{sfn|New York Times|1936}} He was a [[Company rule in Rhodesia|Rhodesian]]-born flying ace of [[the Great War]], credited with [[List of World War I aces credited with 8 victories|eight aerial victories]].{{sfn|Aerodrome|2016}} Connie Boswell continued to have a successful solo career as a singer for Decca. She changed{{efn|name=Connee|{{harvnb|Stras|2009|p=318}}: \"Connie changed the spelling of her name to 'Connee' a few years after embarking on her solo career; various reasons have been put forward for this change, including that she found it difficult and tiring to dot the 'i' when signing autographs, as her right hand and arm were weakened by [[polio]]. Family sources maintain that her sister Martha persuaded her to make the change 'for good luck'.\"}} the spelling of her name from Connie to Connee in the 1940s, reputedly because it made it easier to sign autographs.{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=318}} When she tried to become involved with the overseas [[USO]] tours during [[World War II]], she was not granted permission to travel overseas because of her disability.\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[Image:The Boswell Sisters - What's On the Air, January 1931.jpg|thumb|right|The trio in 1931.]]\nLater groups such as the Pfister Sisters, the [[the Stolen Sweets|Stolen Sweets]], Boswellmania, the [[Puppini Sisters]], YazooZazz, the Spanish group O Sister!, the Italian trio [[Sorelle Marinetti]], and the Israeli band the Hazelnuts, imitated the sisters' recordings. Canada's Company B Jazz Band includes many Boswell Sisters arrangements in its repertoire and even created a set saluting the Boswells' appearance in ''Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round'' for the cover of their second album, ''Rock & Roll''. [[The Ditty Bops]] have covered Boswell Sisters songs in concert. Caffeine Trio from Brazil also claims to have been influenced by them. There is also an Australian group, the Boswell Project, based in [[Adelaide, South Australia]]. A London harmony trio, The Haywood Sisters, have also recorded some Boswell Sisters hits and are greatly influenced by their style.\n\nIn 2001, ''The Boswell Sisters'', a major musical based on their lives, was produced at the Old Globe Theatre in [[San Diego, California]]. The play starred Michelle Duffy, Elizabeth Ward Land, and [[Amy Pietz]] and was produced by the same team that produced ''[[Forever Plaid]]''.  The show was a hit with audiences and a critical success, but failed to be picked up for a much hoped-for Broadway run.\n\nThe Boswell Sisters were inducted into the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] in 1998. At a ceremony covered by the Pfister Sisters, the Boswells were inducted into the [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]] in 2008.\n\nIn 2014, Vet's daughter and granddaughter published ''The Boswell Legacy'', the first comprehensive book on the life and times of the influential trio.{{sfn|Titus|2014|p=33}}\n\n== Hit singles ==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Year\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Single\n!colspan=\"1\"|Chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n!width=\"25\"|[[Billboard Hot 100|US]]{{sfn|Whitburn|1986}}{{efn|name=Chart Note|[[Joel Whitburn]]'s methodology for recreating pre-1940s chart positions has been\ncriticized by scholars.

an American [[close harmony]] singing trio of the [[jazz]] and [[Swing music|swing]] eras, consisting of three sisters: '''[[Martha Boswell]]''' (June 9, 1905 \u2013 July 2, 1958), '''[[Connee Boswell]]''' (original name Connie, December 3, 1907 \u2013 October 11, 1976), and '''[[Helvetia \"Vet\" Boswell]]''' (May 20, 1911 \u2013 November 12, 1988). Hailing from [[uptown New Orleans]], the group was noted for their intricate harmonies and rhythmic experimentation. They attained national prominence in the United States in the 1930s during the twilight years of the [[Jazz Age]] and the onset of the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=297}} \n\nWhen the trio formally split in 1936, Connie continued as a solo vocalist in [[radio]], [[film]], and later [[television]] for an additional quarter of a century.{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=297}} The trio's \"unique singing style and ground-breaking arrangements fused 'blackness' and 'whiteness' in music,\" and their collaborations with \"the preeminent white swing musicians of their day\u2014the [[Dorsey Brothers]], [[Glenn Miller]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Artie Shaw]]\u2014had a profound effect on the development of the big band sound in the 1930s.\"{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=297}} When assessing their legacy, scholars claim the Boswell Sisters \"made 'real' jazz commercially viable, destigmatizing the music and opening its appreciation to the wider American public.\"{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=298}}\n\n== Early life and education ==\n[[Image:UptownCampStBoswellSistersHouse.jpg|left|thumb|House on Camp Street in [[uptown New Orleans]] where the Boswell Sisters grew up.]]\nMartha and Connie{{efn|name=Connee}} were born in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. Helvetia was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. Born to a former vaudevillian, Clyde \"A.

Connie would later imitate Smith's style on the Boswells' first record, \"I'm Gonna Cry (Cryin' Blues),\" before settling into her own vocal style.{{sfn|Manilla|2006}}{{sfn|Sampson|1980|p=1431}} In interviews, the sisters recalled driving around New Orleans listening for new and interesting sounds, which they often found outside African\u2013American churches and barrooms.\n\nAs their older brother Clydie began breaking away from classical music to study jazz, he introduced his sisters to the new syncopated style and to many of the young jazz players in New Orleans.{{sfn|Titus|2014|p=47}} [[Leon Roppolo]] (clarinet, guitar), [[Monk Hazel]] (drums, cornet), Pinky Vidacovich (clarinet, saxophone), [[Nappy Lamare]] (guitar, banjo), [[Ray Bauduc]] (tuba, vocals), Dan LeBlanc (tuba), [[Leon Prima]] (trumpet), [[Louis Prima]] (trumpet, vocals), [[Wingy Manone]] (trumpet, vocals), [[Al Gallodoro]] (clarinet, saxophone), [[Chink Martin]] (bass, tuba, guitar), [[Santo Pecora]] (trombone), [[Raymond Burke (clarinetist)|Raymond Burke]] (clarinet, saxophone), and [[Tony Parenti]] (clarinet, saxophone) were regular guests at the Boswell home. The sisters were particularly influenced by the cornetist [[Emmett Hardy|Emmett Louis Hardy]], another friend of Clydie's, whose well-documented talent and skill helped shape the sisters' knowledge of jazz harmony, syncopation, and improvisation. Hardy and Clydie both died young and unrecorded, Hardy of [[tuberculosis]] at age 22 and Clydie of [[flu]]-related complications at 18.\n\nAfter becoming interested in jazz, Vet took up the banjo and Connie the saxophone. Martha continued playing the piano but focused on the rhythms and idioms of [[ragtime]] and [[Dixieland|hot jazz]].\n\n== Career ==\n=== New Orleans ===\n[[Image:Boswell Sisters 1932.jpg|thumb|right|The Boswell Sisters in March 1932.

Really when they get through murdering it, one can never recognize the original.\"{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=301}} Another outraged letter from an angry listener read: \"Please get those terrible Boswell Sisters off the station! You can't follow the melody and the beat is going too rapidly. And to me they sound like savage chanters!\"{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=320}}\n\n=== East Coast ===\nAfter relocating to [[New York City]] in 1930, the Boswell Sisters soon attained national attention and began making national radio broadcasts. The trio had a program on [[CBS]] from 1931 to 1933.{{sfn|Dunning|1998|p=110}} They soon signed a contract with [[Brunswick Records]] and made recordings from 1931 to 1935 under the aegis of producer [[Jack Kapp]].{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=302}} These Brunswick recordings are widely regarded as milestone recordings of vocal jazz.{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=302}} For their Brunswick recordings, \"the Boswells took greater liberties, regularly changing style, tempi, modality, lyrics, time signatures and voicings (both instrumental and vocal) to create unexpected textures and effects.\"{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=302}} \n\nConnee's reworkings of the melodies and rhythms of popular songs, together with [[Glenn Miller]]'s arrangements and New York jazz musicians (including the [[The Dorsey Brothers|Dorsey Brothers]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Bunny Berigan]], [[Fulton McGrath]], [[Joe Venuti]], [[Arthur Schutt]], [[Eddie Lang]], [[Joe Tarto]], [[Mannie Klein]], [[Dick McDonough]], and [[Carl Kress]]), made these recordings unlike any others. Melodies were rearranged and slowed down, major keys were changed to minor keys (sometimes in mid-song), and unexpected rhythmic changes were par for the course. They were among the few performers who were allowed to make changes to current popular tunes since, during this era, music publishers and record companies pressured performers not to alter current popular song arrangements.{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=302}} Connee also recorded a series of more conventional solo records for Brunswick during the same period.\n\n=== Popular success ===\nThe Boswell Sisters soon appeared in films during this time. They sang the lively \"Shout, Sister, Shout\" (1931), written by [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]], in the 1932 film ''[[The Big Broadcast]]'', which featured [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Cab Calloway]].{{efn|name=Boardwalk Empire|The song was also featured in the television show ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'', Season 5 Episode 5.}} The song\u2014one of the sisters' signature tunes\u2014was described in a November 2011 issue of the music magazine ''Mojo'' as \"by no means as archaic as its age.\" They sang their 1934 song \"Rock and Roll\" in the film ''[[Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round]]'', bringing with them an early use of the phrase ''rock 'n' roll'', referring in the song to \"the rolling rocking rhythm of the sea\". \n\nThe Boswell Sisters chalked up 20 hits during the 1930s, including the number-one record \"The Object of My Affection\" (1935). (Of special note is their involvement in a handful of 12\" medley/concert recordings made by [[Red Nichols]], [[Victor Young]] and [[Don Redman]] and their 1934 recording of \"[[Darktown Strutters' Ball]]\", which was issued only in Australia.) They also completed two successful tours of Europe, appeared on the inaugural television broadcast of [[CBS]], and performed on ''Hello, Europe'', the first internationally broadcast radio program.\n\nThe Boswell Sisters were among radio's earliest stars, making them one of the first hit acts of the mass-entertainment age. In 1934, the Sisters appeared 13 times on the [[Bing Crosby Entertains]] radio show on CBS. They were featured in fan magazines, and their likenesses were used in advertisements for beauty and household products.{{sfn|Cave|Titus|2014}} During the early 1930s the Boswell Sisters, [[Three X Sisters]], and [[Pickens Sisters]] were the talk of early radio female harmonizing. The [[Andrews Sisters]] started out as imitators of the Boswell Sisters.{{sfn|Berkvist|2013}} Young [[Ella Fitzgerald]] loved the Boswell Sisters and in particular idolized Connee, after whose singing style she patterned her own.{{sfn|Nicholson|2014|pp=10\u201312}}\n\nIn 1936, the group signed to Decca, but after just three records they broke up. The last recording was February 12, 1936. Approximately one month earlier, Martha Boswell had married Major [[George Lloyd (RAF officer)|George L. Lloyd]] of Britain's [[Royal Air Force]]. Connie served as her sister's only attendant at the wedding and [[Harold J. Warner]] served as their best man.{{sfn|New York Times|1936}} Lloyd was the managing director of the Aero Insurance Underwriters in New York.{{sfn|New York Times|1936}} He was a [[Company rule in Rhodesia|Rhodesian]]-born flying ace of [[the Great War]], credited with [[List of World War I aces credited with 8 victories|eight aerial victories]].{{sfn|Aerodrome|2016}} Connie Boswell continued to have a successful solo career as a singer for Decca. She changed{{efn|name=Connee|{{harvnb|Stras|2009|p=318}}: \"Connie changed the spelling of her name to 'Connee' a few years after embarking on her solo career; various reasons have been put forward for this change, including that she found it difficult and tiring to dot the 'i' when signing autographs, as her right hand and arm were weakened by [[polio]]. Family sources maintain that her sister Martha persuaded her to make the change 'for good luck'.\"}} the spelling of her name from Connie to Connee in the 1940s, reputedly because it made it easier to sign autographs.{{sfn|Stras|2009|p=318}} When she tried to become involved with the overseas [[USO]] tours during [[World War II]], she was not granted permission to travel overseas because of her disability.\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[Image:The Boswell Sisters - What's On the Air, January 1931.jpg|thumb|right|The trio in 1931.]]\nLater groups such as the Pfister Sisters, the [[the Stolen Sweets|Stolen Sweets]], Boswellmania, the [[Puppini Sisters]], YazooZazz, the Spanish group O Sister!, the Italian trio [[Sorelle Marinetti]], and the Israeli band the Hazelnuts, imitated the sisters' recordings. Canada's Company B Jazz Band includes many Boswell Sisters arrangements in its repertoire and even created a set saluting the Boswells' appearance in ''Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round'' for the cover of their second album, ''Rock & Roll''. [[The Ditty Bops]] have covered Boswell Sisters songs in concert. Caffeine Trio from Brazil also claims to have been influenced by them. There is also an Australian group, the Boswell Project, based in [[Adelaide, South Australia]]. A London harmony trio, The Haywood Sisters, have also recorded some Boswell Sisters hits and are greatly influenced by their style.\n\nIn 2001, ''The Boswell Sisters'', a major musical based on their lives, was produced at the Old Globe Theatre in [[San Diego, California]]. The play starred Michelle Duffy, Elizabeth Ward Land, and [[Amy Pietz]] and was produced by the same team that produced ''[[Forever Plaid]]''.  The show was a hit with audiences and a critical success, but failed to be picked up for a much hoped-for Broadway run.\n\nThe Boswell Sisters were inducted into the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] in 1998. At a ceremony covered by the Pfister Sisters, the Boswells were inducted into the [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]] in 2008.\n\nIn 2014, Vet's daughter and granddaughter published ''The Boswell Legacy'', the first comprehensive book on the life and times of the influential trio.{{sfn|Titus|2014|p=33}}\n\n== Hit singles ==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Year\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Single\n!colspan=\"1\"|Chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n!width=\"25\"|[[Billboard Hot 100|US]]{{sfn|Whitburn|1986}}{{efn|name=Chart Note|[[Joel Whitburn]]'s methodology for recreating pre-1940s chart positions has been\ncriticized by scholars.
