Their construction and maintenance have neutral impacts on the Earth. Often, if necessary, they are close in proximity to essential services such as grocery stores, schools, daycares, work, or public transit making it possible to commit to sustainable transportation choices.<ref>Jeffery, Yvonne, Michael Grosvenor, and Liz Barclay. ''Green Living for Dummies.'' Indianapolis, IN: Wiley Pub., 2008.

Additionally, sustainable homes may be connected to a grid, but generate their own electricity through renewable means and sell any excess to a utility. There are two common methods to approaching this option: net metering and double metering.<ref name=\"McDilda, Diane Gow 2007\">McDilda, Diane Gow.

Power companies can quickly purchase the power that is put back into the grid, as it is being produced. Double metering involves installing two meters: one measuring electricity consumed, the other measuring electricity created. Additionally, or in place of selling their renewable energy, sustainable home owners may choose to bank their excess energy by using it to charge batteries. This gives them the option to use the power later during less favorable power-generating times (i.e.: night-time, when there has been no wind, etc.), and to be completely independent of the [[electrical grid]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">McDilda, Diane Gow.

Well insulated walls and lofts using green materials are a must as it reduces or, in combination with a house that is well designed, eliminates the need for heating and cooling altogether. Installation of insulation varies according to the type of insulation being used. Typically, lofts are insulated by strips of insulating material laid between rafters. Walls with cavities are done in much the same manner. For walls that do not have cavities behind them, solid-wall insulation may be necessary which can decrease internal space and can be expensive to install.<ref name=\"Hamilton, Andy 2009\"/> Energy-efficient windows are another important factor in insulation. Simply assuring that windows (and doors) are well sealed greatly reduces energy loss in a home.<ref name=\"McDilda, Diane Gow 2007\"/>  Double or Triple glazed windows are the typical method to insulating windows, trapping gas or creating a vacuum between two or three panes of glass allowing heat to be trapped inside or out.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> [[Low-emissivity]] or Low-E glass is another option for window insulation. It is a coating on windowpanes of a thin, transparent layer of metal oxide and works by reflecting heat back to its source, keeping the interior warm during the winter and cool during the summer. Simply hanging heavy-backed curtains in front of windows may also help their insulation.<ref name=\"Hamilton, Andy 2009\"/> \u201cSuperwindows,\u201d mentioned in [[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]], became available in the 1980s and use a combination of many available technologies, including two to three transparent low-e coatings, multiple panes of glass, and a heavy gas filling. Although more expensive, they are said to be able to insulate four and a half times better than a typical double-glazed windows.<ref>Hawken, Paul, Amory B. Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins.

[[Green roofs]] or \u201cliving roofs\u201d are a popular choice for thermally insulating a building. They are also popular for their ability to catch storm-water runoff and, when in the broader picture of a community, reduce the heat island effect (see [[urban heat island]]) thereby reducing energy costs of the entire area. It is arguable that they are able to replace the physical \u201cfootprint\u201d that the building creates, helping reduce the adverse environmental impacts of the building's presence.<ref>Cutlip, Jamie.

Purchasing sustainable energy, however, may simply not be possible in some locations due to its limited availability. 6 out of the 50 states in the US do not offer green energy, for example. For those that do, its consumers typically buy a fixed amount or a percentage of their monthly consumption from a company of their choice and the bought green energy is fed into the entire national grid. Technically, in this case, the green energy is not being fed directly to the household that buys it.<ref>[http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/home-garden/news/2007/07/buy-green-power-and-electricity-to-help-the-environment/overview/0707_buying_green_power_ov.htm Buy Green Power and Electricity to Help the Environment].

This may or may not depend on the amount being purchased. The purpose of buying green electricity is to support their utility's effort in producing sustainable energy.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Hamilton, Andy, and Dave Hamilton.

In some special cases, producing households may be paid up to four times the standard electricity rate, but this is not common.<ref>Galbraith, Kate.

One of the most common ways that this method is used by households is through [[solar water heating]]. In a broad perspective, these systems involve well insulated tanks for storage and collectors, are either passive or active systems (active systems have pumps that continuously circulate water through the collectors and storage tank) and, in active systems, involve either directly heating the water that will be used or heating a non-freezing heat-transfer fluid that then heats the water that will be used. Passive systems are cheaper than active systems since they do not require a pumping system (instead, they take advantage of the natural movement of hot water rising above cold water to cycle the water being used through the collector and storage tank).<ref>[http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=12850 Energy Savers: Solar Water Heaters].

Web. 28 October 2010.</ref>\n\nOther methods of harnessing solar power are [[Solar combisystem|solar space heating]] (for heating internal building spaces), solar drying (for drying wood chips, fruits, grains, etc.), [[solar cookers]], [[Solar distillation|solar distillers]], and other [[passive solar]] technologies (simply, harnessing sunlight without any mechanical means).\n\nWind power is harnessed through turbines, set on tall towers (typically 20\u2019 or 6m with 10\u2018 or 3m diameter blades for an individual household's needs) that power a generator that creates electricity.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/> They typically require an average of wind speed of 9&nbsp;mi/hr (14&nbsp;km/hr) to be worth their investment (as prescribed by the US Department of Energy), and are capable of paying for themselves within their lifetimes. Wind turbines in urban areas usually need to be mounted at least 30\u2019 (10m) in the air to receive enough wind and to be void of nearby obstructions (such as neighboring buildings). Mounting a wind turbine may also require permission from authorities. Wind turbines have been criticized for the noise they produce, their appearance, and the argument that they can affect the migratory patterns of birds (their blades obstruct passage in the sky). Wind turbines are much more feasible for those living in rural areas<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> and are one of the most cost-effective forms of renewable energy per kilowatt, approaching the cost of fossil fuels, and have quick paybacks.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>\n\nFor those that have a body of water flowing at an adequate speed (or falling from an adequate height) on their property, [[hydroelectricity]] may be an option. On a large scale, hydroelectricity, in the form of dams, has adverse environmental and social impacts. When on a small scale, however, in the form of single turbines, hydroelectricity is very sustainable. Single water turbines or even a group of single turbines are not environmentally or socially disruptive. On an individual household basis, single turbines are the probably the only economically feasible route (but can have high paybacks and is one of the most efficient methods of renewable energy production). It is more common for an eco-village to use this method rather than a singular household.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nGeothermal energy production involves harnessing the hot water or steam below the earth's surface, in reservoirs, to produce energy. Because the hot water or steam that is used is reinjected back into the reservoir, this source is considered sustainable. However, those that plan on getting their electricity from this source should be aware that there is controversy over the lifespan of each geothermal reservoir as some believe that their lifespans are naturally limited (they cool down over time, making geothermal energy production there eventually impossible). This method is often large scale as the system required to harness geothermal energy can be complex and requires deep drilling equipment. There do exist small individual scale geothermal operations, however, which harness reservoirs very close to the Earth's surface, avoiding the need for extensive drilling and sometimes even taking advantage of lakes or ponds where there is already a depression. In this case, the heat is captured and sent to a [[geothermal heat pump]] system located inside the shelter or facility that needs it (often, this heat is used directly to warm a greenhouse during the colder months).<ref name=\"Jeffery, Yvonne 2008\"/> Although geothermal energy is available everywhere on Earth, practicality and cost-effectiveness varies, directly related to the depth required to reach reservoirs. Places such as the Philippines, Hawaii,  Alaska, Iceland, California, and Nevada have geothermal reservoirs closer to the Earth's surface, making its production cost-effective.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>\n\nBiomass power is created when any biological matter is burned as fuel. As with the case of using green materials in a household, it is best to use as much locally available material as possible so as to reduce the carbon footprint created by transportation. Although burning biomass for fuel releases [[carbon dioxide]], sulfur compounds, and nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere, a major concern in a sustainable lifestyle, the amount that is released is sustainable (it will not contribute to a rise in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere). This is because the biological matter that is being burned releases the same amount of carbon dioxide that it consumed during its lifetime.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/> However, burning [[biodiesel]] and bioethanol (see [[biofuel]]) when created from virgin material, is increasingly controversial and may or may not be considered sustainable because it inadvertently increases global poverty, the clearing of more land for new agriculture fields (the source of the biofuel is also the same source of food), and may use unsustainable growing methods (such as the use of environmentally harmful pesticides and fertilizers).<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/><ref>Brown, Lester Russell.

Materials such as waste sludge can be digested to release methane gas that can then be burnt to produce electricity. Methane gas is also a natural by-product of landfills, full of decomposing waste, and can be harnessed here to produce electricity as well. The advantage in burning methane gas is that is prevents the methane from being released into the atmosphere, exacerbating the greenhouse effect. Although this method of biomass energy production is typically large scale (done in landfills), it can be done on a smaller individual or community scale as well.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>\n\n==Food==\nGlobally, food accounts for 48% and 70% of household environmental impacts on land and water resources respectively, with consumption of meat, dairy and processed food rising quickly with income<sup><ref name=\"Ivanova\"/></sup>.\n\n===Environmental impacts of industrial agriculture===\n\n[[Industrial agriculture|Industrial agricultural production]] is highly resource and energy intensive.  Industrial agriculture systems typically require heavy [[irrigation]], extensive [[Pesticide application|pesticide]] and [[Fertilizer|fertilizer application]], intensive [[tillage]], concentrated [[monoculture]] production, and other continual inputs. As a result of these industrial farming conditions, today's mounting environmental stresses are further exacerbated. These stresses include: declining [[water table]]s, chemical [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], chemical [[Surface runoff|runoff]], [[soil erosion]], [[land degradation]], loss in [[biodiversity]], and other ecological concerns.<ref>Brown, Lester R. ''Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization''. W.W. Norton, 2009.</ref>\n\n===Conventional food distribution and long distance transport===\n\n[[Conventional]] food distribution and long distance transport are additionally [[resource]] and [[energy]] exhaustive.  Substantial climate-disrupting [[carbon emissions]], boosted by the transport of food over long distances, are of growing concern as the world faces such [[global crisis]] as [[natural resource]] depletion, [[peak oil]] and [[climate change]].<ref>Heinberg, Richard.

''Depletion and Abundance: Life on the New Home Front''. Canada: New Society Publishers,  2008.</ref>\n\n===Local and seasonal foods===\n\nA more sustainable means of acquiring food is to purchase locally and seasonally. Buying food from local farmers reduces [[carbon output]], caused by long-distance food transport, and stimulates the local economy.<ref name=\"Astyk, Sharon 2008\"/> Local, small-scale farming operations also typically utilize more sustainable methods of agriculture than conventional industrial farming systems such as decreased tillage, [[nutrient cycling]], fostered biodiversity and reduced chemical pesticide and fertilizer applications.<ref name=\"Shiva, Vandana 2000\">Shiva, Vandana. ''Stolen Harvest: The Hijacking of the Global Food Supply''. Cambridge, MA: South End Press, 2000.</ref> Adapting a more regional, seasonally based diet is more sustainable as it entails purchasing less energy and resource demanding produce that naturally grow within a local area and require no long-distance transport. These vegetables and fruits are also grown and harvested within their suitable [[growing season]]. Thus, [[seasonal food]] farming does not require energy intensive [[greenhouse]] production, extensive irrigation, plastic packaging and long-distance transport from importing non-regional foods, and other environmental stressors.<ref name=\"Seymour, John 2003\">Seymour, John. ''The Self-Sufficient Life and How to Live It''. London: DK Publishing, 2003.</ref> Local, seasonal produce is typically fresher, unprocessed and argued to be more nutritious. Local produce also contains less to no chemical residues from applications required for long-distance shipping and handling.<ref>Princen, Thomas. ''The Logic of Sufficiency''. New York: MIT Press, 2005.</ref> [[Farmers' market]]s, public events where local small-scale farmers gather and sell their produce, are a good source for obtaining local food and knowledge about local farming productions.  As well as promoting localization of food, farmers markets are a central gathering place for community interaction.<ref name=\"Todd, J 1994\">Todd, J. and N. J. Todd. ''From Eco-Cities to Living Machines: Principles of Ecological Design''. Berkeley, CA:  North Atlantic Books, 1994.</ref>  Another way to become involved in regional food distribution is by joining a local [[community-supported agriculture]] (CSA). A CSA consists of a community of growers and consumers who pledge to support a farming operation while equally sharing the risks and benefits of food production. CSA's usually involve a system of weekly pick-ups of locally farmed vegetables and fruits, sometimes including dairy products, meat and special food items such as baked goods.<ref>Nabhan, Gary. ''Coming Home to Eat''. Berkeley, CA: W.W. Norton, 2002.</ref> Considering the previously noted rising environmental crisis, the United States and much of the world is facing immense vulnerability to famine. Local food production ensures food security if potential transportation disruptions and climatic, economical, and sociopolitical disasters were to occur.<ref name=\"Astyk, Sharon 2008\"/>\n\n===Reducing meat consumption===\n\nIndustrial meat production also involves high environmental costs such as [[land degradation]], [[soil erosion]] and depletion of [[natural resource]]s, especially pertaining to water and food.<ref name=\"Seymour, John 2003\"/> Mass meat production increase the amount of [[Atmospheric methane|methane in the atmosphere]].  For more information on the [[environmental impact of meat production]] and consumption, see the [[ethics of eating meat]]. Reducing meat consumption, perhaps to a few meals a week, or adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet, alleviates the demand for environmentally damaging industrial meat production. Buying and consuming organically raised, [[free range]] or [[Grass fed|grass fed meat]] is another alternative towards more sustainable meat consumption.<ref name=\"Shiva, Vandana 2000\"/>\n\n===Organic farming===\n\nPurchasing and supporting organic products is another fundamental contribution to sustainable living. [[Organic farming]] is a rapidly emerging trend in the food industry and in the web of sustainability. According to the [[USDA]] [[National Organic Standards Board]] (NOSB), [[organic agriculture]] is defined as \"an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity. It is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore, maintain, or enhance ecological harmony. The primary goal of organic agriculture is to optimize the health and productivity of interdependent communities of soil life, plants, animals and people.\" Upon sustaining these goals, organic agriculture uses techniques such as [[crop rotation]], [[permaculture]], [[compost]], [[green manure]] and [[biological pest control]]. In addition, organic farming prohibits or strictly limits the use of manufactured fertilizers and pesticides, [[plant growth regulators]] such as [[hormones]], livestock [[antibiotics]], [[food additives]] and [[genetically modified organisms]].<ref>[http://extension.agron.iastate.edu/organicag/whatis.html Organic Agriculture - What is Organic Agriculture?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018130008/http://extension.agron.iastate.edu/organicag/whatis.html |date=18 October 2010 }} Iowa State University. 2008.

[[Qixia District]], [[Nanjing]], China]]\nIn addition to local, small-scale farms, there has been a recent emergence in [[urban agriculture]] expanding from [[community gardens]] to private [[Residential garden|home gardens]]. With this trend, both farmers and ordinary people are becoming involved in [[food production]]. A network of urban farming systems helps to further ensure regional food security and encourages self-sufficiency and cooperative interdependence within communities.<ref>Flores, H.C. ''Food Not Lawns: How to Turn Your Yard into a Garden and Your Neighborhood into a Community''. New York: Chelsea Green, 2006.</ref> With every bite of food raised from urban gardens, negative environmental impacts are reduced in numerous ways. For instance, vegetables and fruits raised within small-scale gardens and farms are not grown with tremendous applications of [[nitrogen fertilizer]] required for industrial agricultural operations. The nitrogen fertilizers cause toxic chemical leaching and runoff that enters our water tables. Nitrogen fertilizer also produces [[nitrous oxide]], a more damaging [[greenhouse gas]] than [[carbon dioxide]]. Local, community-grown food also requires no imported, long-distance transport which further depletes our [[fossil fuel]] reserves.<ref>Nyerges, Christopher. ''Urban Wilderness: a guidebook to resourceful city living''. Culver, CA: Peace Press, 1979.</ref> In developing more efficiency per land acre, urban gardens can be started in a wide variety of areas: in vacant lots, public parks, private yards, church and school yards, on roof tops ([[roof-top garden]]s), and many other places.  Communities can work together in changing zoning limitations in order for public and private gardens to be permissible.<ref>Hemenway, Toby. ''Gaia\u2019s Garden''. New York: Chelsea Green, 2000.</ref> Aesthetically pleasing [[edible landscaping]] plants can also be incorporated into city landscaping such as blueberry bushes, grapevines trained on an arbor, pecan trees, etc.<ref name=\"Todd, J 1994\"/> With as small a scale as home or community farming, sustainable and organic farming methods can easily be utilized. Such sustainable, organic farming techniques include: [[composting]], [[biological pest control]], [[crop rotation]], [[mulching]], [[drip irrigation]], [[nutrient cycling]] and [[permaculture]].<ref>Warde, Jon, ed.

Home-grown foods can be preserved and stored outside of their growing season and continually consumed throughout the year, enhancing self-sufficiency and independence from the supermarket. Food can be preserved and saved by [[Dehydration (food)|dehydration]], [[Freezing (food)|freezing]], [[vacuum packing]], [[canning]], [[bottling]], [[pickling]] and jellying.<ref>Ciperthwaite, Wm.

Revisions of [[Public transport|urban transport]] systems that foster mobility, low-cost transportation and healthier urban environments are needed. Such urban transport systems should consist of a combination of [[rail transport]], [[bus transport]], [[bicycle]] pathways and [[pedestrian]] [[walkways]]. Public transport systems such as underground rail systems and bus transit systems shift huge numbers of people away from reliance on car [[mobilization]] and dramatically reduce the rate of carbon emissions caused by automobile transport.<ref name=\"Brown, Lester R. 2009\">Brown, Lester R.

Electric bikes are similar to [[plug-in hybrid]] vehicles in that they are battery powered and can be plugged into the provincial [[electric grid]] for recharging as needed. In contrast to plug-in hybrid cars, electric bikes do not directly use any [[fossil fuels]].  Adequate sustainable urban transportation is dependent upon proper city [[infrastructure]] and planning that incorporates efficient public transit along with bicycle and pedestrian-friendly pathways.<ref name=\"Brown, Lester R. 2009\" />  Patrick Maria Johnson was the founder of this.\n\n==Water==\n{{Contradicts other|date=December 2013|1=Water efficiency}}\n{{main|Water efficiency}}\nA major factor of sustainable living involves that which no human can live without, [[water]]. Unsustainable water use has far reaching implications for humankind.  Currently, humans use one-fourth of the Earth's total fresh water in natural circulation, and over half the accessible [[Surface runoff|runoff]].<ref name=\"Hawken, Paul 1999\">Hawken, Paul, Amory Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins. ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution''. New York City: Little, Brown and Company, 1999. Print.</ref> Additionally, [[population growth]] and water demand is ever increasing. Thus, it is necessary to use available water more efficiently. In sustainable living, one can use water more sustainably through a series of simple, everyday measures.  These measures involve considering indoor [[home appliance]] efficiency, outdoor water use, and daily water use awareness.\n\n===Indoor home appliances===\n\nHousing and [[commercial buildings]] account for 12 percent of America's freshwater withdrawals.<ref name=\"Hawken, Paul 1999\"/>  A typical American single family home uses about {{convert|70|USgal|L}} per person per day indoors.<ref name=\"Hawken, Paul 1999\"/> This use can be reduced by simple alterations in behavior and upgrades to [[Home appliance|appliance]] quality.\n\n====Toilets====\n\n[[Toilets]] accounted for almost 30% of residential indoor water use in the United States in 1999.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.epa.gov/watersense/pubs/indoor.html Indoor Water Use in the United States] WaterSense: An EPA Partnership Program.

Hunter Lovins. ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution.'' New York City: Little, Brown and Company, 1999. Print.</ref>\nA home's toilet water sustainability can be improved in one of two ways: improving the current toilet or installing a more efficient toilet.  To improve the current toilet, one possible method is to put weighted plastic bottles in the toilet tank.  Also, there are inexpensive tank banks or float booster available for purchase.  A tank bank is a plastic bag to be filled with water and hung in the toilet tank. A [http://www.floatbooster.com/Product.html float booster] attaches underneath the float ball of pre-1986 three and a half gallon capacity toilets.  It allows these toilets to operate at the same valve and float setting but significantly reduces their water level, saving between one and one and a third gallons of water per flush.  A major waste of water in existing toilets is leaks.  A slow toilet leak is undetectable to the eye, but can waste hundreds of gallons each month.  One way to check this is to put food dye in the tank, and to see if the water in the toilet bowl turns the same color.  In the event of a leaky flapper, one can replace it with an adjustable toilet flapper, which allows self-adjustment of the amount of water per flush.\n\nIn installing a new toilet there are a number of options to obtain the most water efficient model. A [[low flush toilet]] uses one to two gallons per flush.  Traditionally, toilets use three to five gallons per flush. If an eighteen-liter per flush toilet is removed and a six-liter per flush toilet is put in its place, 70% of the water flushed will be saved while the overall indoor water use by will be reduced by 30%.<ref>[http://urbanbuildersnyc.com/Green_Building.html Green Building Health and Environmental Considerations in Building and Renovating Today] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130194906/http://urbanbuildersnyc.com/Green_Building.html |date=30 November 2010 }} Urban Builders Group. Urban Builders Group LTD. Web. 10 November 2010.</ref> It is possible to have a toilet that uses no water.  A [[composting toilet]] treats human waste through [[composting]] and [[dehydration]], producing a valuable soil additive.<ref>[http://compostingtoilet.org/compost_toilets_explained/what_is_a_composting_toilet/index.php What is a Composting Toilet?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120223832/http://compostingtoilet.org/compost_toilets_explained/what_is_a_composting_toilet/index.php |date=20 November 2010 }} Composting Toilet World. Envirolet. 2010. Web. 10 November 2010.</ref>  These toilets feature a two-compartment bowl to separate urine from feces.  The urine can be collected or sold as fertilizer.  The feces can be dried and bagged or composted.  These toilets cost scarcely more than regularly installed toilets and do not require a sewer hookup.  In addition to providing valuable fertilizer, these toilets are highly sustainable because they save sewage collection and treatment, as well as lessen agricultural costs and improve [[topsoil]].\n\nAdditionally, one can reduce toilet water sustainability by limiting total toilet flushing. For instance, instead of flushing small wastes, such as tissues, one can dispose of these items in the trash or compost.\n\n====Showers====\n\nOn average, showers were 18% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999, at {{convert|6|-|8|USgal|L}} per minute traditionally in America.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> A simple method to reduce this use is to switch to low-flow, high-performance showerheads.  These showerheads use only 1.0-1.5 gpm or less. An alternative to replacing the showerhead is to install a converter. This device arrests a running shower upon reaching the desired temperature. [[Solar water heater]]s can be used to obtain optimal water temperature, and are more sustainable because they reduce dependence on fossil fuels. To lessen excess water use, water pipes can be insulated with pre-slit foam pipe insulation. This insulation decreases hot water generation time. A simple, straightforward method to conserve water when showering is to take shorter showers. One method to accomplish this is to turn off the water when it is not necessary (such as while lathering) and resuming the shower when water is necessary.  This can be facilitated when the plumbing or showerhead allow turning off the water without disrupting the desired temperature setting (common in the UK but not the United States).\n\n====Dishwashers and sinks====\n\nOn average, sinks were 15% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> There are, however, easy methods to rectify excessive water loss. Available for purchase is a screw-on aerator. This device works by combining water with air thus generating a frothy substance with greater perceived volume, reducing water use by half. Additionally, there is a flip-valve available that allows flow to be turned off and back on at the previously reached temperature. Finally, a [[laminar flow]] device creates a 1.5-2.4 gpm stream of water that reduces water use by half, but can be turned to normal water level when optimal.\n\nIn addition to buying the above devices, one can live more sustainably by checking sinks for leaks, and fixing these links if they exist. According to the EPA, \"A small drip from a worn faucet washer can waste 20 gallons of water per day, while larger leaks can waste hundreds of gallons\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> When washing dishes by hand, it is not necessary to leave the water running for rinsing, and it is more efficient to rinse dishes simultaneously.\n\nOn average, dishwashing consumes 1% of indoor water use.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> When using a [[dishwasher]], water can be conserved by only running the machine when it is full.  Some have a \"low flow\" setting to use less water per wash cycle. Enzymatic [[detergents]] clean dishes more efficiently and more successfully with a smaller amount of water at a lower temperature.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n====Washing machines====\n\nOn average, 23% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999 was due to clothes washing.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In contrast to other machines, American [[washing machines]] have changed little to become more sustainable. A typical washing machine has a vertical-axis design, in which clothes are agitated in a tubful of water. Horizontal-axis machines, in contrast, put less water into the bottom of the rub and rotate clothes through it. These machines are more efficient in terms of soap use and clothing stability.\n\n===Outdoor water use===\n\nThere are a number of ways one can incorporate a personal [[yard]], [[roof]], and [[garden]] in more sustainable living. While conserving water is a major element of sustainability, so is sequestering water.\n\n====Conserving water====\n\nIn planning a yard and garden space, it is most sustainable to consider the plants, soil, and available water.  Drought resistant shrubs, plants, and grasses require a smaller amount of water in comparison to more traditional species.  Additionally, native plants (as opposed to herbaceous perennials) will use a smaller supply of water and have a heightened resistance to plant diseases of the area. [[Xeriscaping]] is a technique that selects drought-tolerant plants and accounts for endemic features such as [[slope]], [[soil type]], and [[native plant]] range.  It can reduce landscape water use by 50 \u2013 70%, while providing [[habitat]] space for wildlife.  Plants on slopes help reduce [[Surface runoff|runoff]] by slowing and absorbing accumulated rainfall.  Grouping plants by watering needs further reduces water waste.\n\nAfter planting, placing a circumference of [[mulch]] surrounding plants functions to lessen [[evaporation]].  To do this, firmly press two to four inches of organic matter along the plant's dripline. This prevents [[water runoff]]. When watering, consider the range of sprinklers; watering paved areas is unnecessary.  Additionally, to conserve the maximum amount of water, watering should be carried out during early mornings on non-windy days to reduce water loss to evaporation.  Drip-irrigation systems and soaker hoses are a more sustainable alternative to the traditional sprinkler system.  Drip-irrigation systems employ small gaps at standard distances in a hose, leading to the slow trickle of water droplets which percolate the soil over a protracted period.  These systems use 30 \u2013 50% less water than conventional methods.<ref>Pinkham, R. and Dyer, J., 1993: \"Linking Water and Energy Savings in Irrigation,\" Rocky Mountain Institute Publication #A94-4.</ref> Soaker hoses help to reduce water use by up to 90%.<ref>[http://www.savingwater.org/docs/successwithsoakerhoses.pdf Soaker Hoses: Good for your Garden, Your Wallet, and Our Environment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011035501/http://www.savingwater.org/docs/successwithsoakerhoses.pdf |date=11 October 2010 }} Saving Water Partnership. Seattle and Participating Area Water Utilities. 2005. Web. 10 November 2010.</ref>  They connect to a garden hose and lay along the row of plants under a layer of mulch.  A layer of [[organic material]] added to the soil helps to increase its absorption and water retention; previously planted areas can be covered with [[compost]].\n\nIn caring for a lawn, there are a number of measures that can increase the sustainability of lawn maintenance techniques.  A primary aspect of lawn care is watering.  To conserve water, it is important to only water when necessary, and to deep soak when watering.  Additionally, a lawn may be left to go dormant, renewing after a dry spell to its original vitality.\n\n====Sequestering water====\n\nA common method of water sequestrations is [[rainwater harvesting]], which incorporates the collection and storage of rain.  Primarily, the rain is obtained from a roof, and stored on the ground in catchment tanks.  Water sequestration varies based on extent, cost, and complexity. A simple method involves a single barrel at the bottom of a downspout, while a more complex method involves multiple tanks.  It is highly sustainable to use stored water in place of purified water for activities such as irrigation and flushing toilets.  Additionally, using stored rainwater reduces the amount of runoff [[pollution]], picked up from roofs and pavements that would normally enter streams through storm drains.  The following equation can be used to estimate annual water supply:\n\nCollection area (square feet) \u00d7 Rainfall (inch/year) / 12 (inch/foot) = Cubic Feet of Water/Year\n\nCubic Feet/Year \u00d7 7.43 (Gallons/Cubic Foot) = Gallons/year\n\nNote, however, this calculation does not account for losses such as evaporation or leakage.<ref>[http://www.portlandonline.com/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=182095 How to Manage Stormwater: Rain Barrels]. Stormwater Management for Clean Rivers. Environmental Services.

Greywater can be reused in [[irrigation]] and toilet flushing.  There are two types of greywater systems: gravity fed manual systems and package systems.<ref name=\"greenbuildingsupply1\">[http://www.greenbuildingsupply.com/Public/Energy-WaterConservation/GreywaterSystems/index.cfm Greywater Systems: Reusing Bath, Laundry, and Sink Water to Conserve Fresh Water].

In America alone, over the course of a decade, 500 trillion pounds of American resources will have been transformed into nonproductive wastes and gases.<ref name=\"HawkenPaul\" /> Thus, a crucial component of sustainable living is being waste conscious.  One can do this by reducing waste, reusing commodities, and recycling.\n\nThere are a number of ways to reduce waste in sustainable living.  Two methods to reduce paper waste are canceling junk mail like [https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t credit card and insurance offers] and [http://www.dmachoice.org/ direct mail marketing] and changing monthly paper statements to paperless emails.  Junk mail alone accounted for 1.72 million tons of landfill waste in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.catalogchoice.org/environmental-facts|title=CatalogChoice Mail Preference Service - Put an end to junk mail, catalogs, and phone books.|website=CatalogChoice Mail Preference Service|accessdate=11 May 2018}}</ref> Another method to reduce waste is to buy in bulk, reducing packaging materials. Preventing food waste can limit the amount of organic waste sent to landfills producing the powerful greenhouse gas methane.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://earthwormtechnologies.com/about-us/|title=Our Story|first=Earthworm|last=Technologies\u00ae|accessdate=11 May 2018}}</ref> Another example of waste reduction involves being cognizant of purchasing excessive amounts when buying materials with limited use like cans of paint. Non-hazardous or less hazardous alternatives can also limit the toxicity of waste.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/recycle.htm Reduce] United States Environmental Protection Agency. 5 May 2010. Web 10 November 2010</ref>\n\nBy reusing materials, one lives more sustainably by not contributing to the addition of waste to landfills. Reusing saves [[natural resources]] by decreasing the necessity of [[raw material]] extraction. For example, reusable bags can reduce the amount of waste created by grocery shopping eliminating the need to create and ship plastic bags and the need to manage their disposal and recycling or polluting effects.\n\n[[Recycling]], a process that breaks down used items into raw materials to make new materials, is a particularly useful means of contributing to the renewal of goods.  Recycling incorporates three primary processes; collection and processing, manufacturing, and purchasing recycled products.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/recycle.htm Wastes \u2013 Resource Conservation \u2013 Reduce, Reuse, Recycle] United States Environmental Protection Agency.  5 May 2010. Web 10 November 2010</ref>  A natural example of recycling involves using food waste as compost to enrich the quality of soil, which can be carried out at home or locally with community [[composting]]. An offshoot of recycling, [[upcycling]], strives to convert material into something of similar or greater value in its second life.<ref>[http://www.sustainabilitydictionary.com/u/upcycle.php UpCycle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112170212/http://www.sustainabilitydictionary.com/u/upcycle.php |date=12 November 2010 }} Sustainability Management.

Additionally, sustainable homes may be connected to a grid, but generate their own electricity through renewable means and sell any excess to a utility. There are two common methods to approaching this option: net metering and double metering.<ref name=\"McDilda, Diane Gow 2007\">McDilda, Diane Gow.

Power companies can quickly purchase the power that is put back into the grid, as it is being produced. Double metering involves installing two meters: one measuring electricity consumed, the other measuring electricity created. Additionally, or in place of selling their renewable energy, sustainable home owners may choose to bank their excess energy by using it to charge batteries. This gives them the option to use the power later during less favorable power-generating times (i.e.: night-time, when there has been no wind, etc.), and to be completely independent of the [[electrical grid]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">McDilda, Diane Gow.

Well insulated walls and lofts using green materials are a must as it reduces or, in combination with a house that is well designed, eliminates the need for heating and cooling altogether. Installation of insulation varies according to the type of insulation being used. Typically, lofts are insulated by strips of insulating material laid between rafters. Walls with cavities are done in much the same manner. For walls that do not have cavities behind them, solid-wall insulation may be necessary which can decrease internal space and can be expensive to install.<ref name=\"Hamilton, Andy 2009\"/> Energy-efficient windows are another important factor in insulation. Simply assuring that windows (and doors) are well sealed greatly reduces energy loss in a home.<ref name=\"McDilda, Diane Gow 2007\"/>  Double or Triple glazed windows are the typical method to insulating windows, trapping gas or creating a vacuum between two or three panes of glass allowing heat to be trapped inside or out.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> [[Low-emissivity]] or Low-E glass is another option for window insulation.

They are also popular for their ability to catch storm-water runoff and, when in the broader picture of a community, reduce the heat island effect (see [[urban heat island]]) thereby reducing energy costs of the entire area.

Purchasing sustainable energy, however, may simply not be possible in some locations due to its limited availability. 6 out of the 50 states in the US do not offer green energy, for example. For those that do, its consumers typically buy a fixed amount or a percentage of their monthly consumption from a company of their choice and the bought green energy is fed into the entire national grid. Technically, in this case, the green energy is not being fed directly to the household that buys it.<ref>[http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/home-garden/news/2007/07/buy-green-power-and-electricity-to-help-the-environment/overview/0707_buying_green_power_ov.htm Buy Green Power and Electricity to Help the Environment].

Web. 28 October 2010.</ref> In this case, it is possible that the amount of green electricity that the buying household receives is a small fraction of their total incoming electricity. This may or may not depend on the amount being purchased. The purpose of buying green electricity is to support their utility's effort in producing sustainable energy.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Hamilton, Andy, and Dave Hamilton.

In some special cases, producing households may be paid up to four times the standard electricity rate, but this is not common.<ref>Galbraith, Kate.

Two typical methods for converting solar energy into electricity are [[Solar cells|photo-voltaic cells]] that are organized into panels and [[concentrated solar power]], which uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight to either heat a fluid that runs an [[electrical generator]] via a [[steam turbine]] or [[heat engine]], or to simply cast onto photo-voltaic cells.<ref>[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/csp_program.html Solar Energy Technologies Program: Concentrating Solar Power].

The Everything Green Living Book: Easy Ways to Conserve Energy, Protect Your Family's Health, and Help save the Environment. Avon, MA: Adams Media, 2007. Print.</ref> The energy created by photo-voltaic cells is a [[direct current]] and has to be converted to [[alternating current]] before it can be used in a household. At this point, users can choose to either store this direct current in batteries for later use, or use an AC/DC inverter for immediate use. To get the best out of a solar panel, the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] of the sun should be between 20 and 50 degrees. Solar power via photo-voltaic cells are usually the most expensive method to harnessing renewable energy, but is falling in price as technology advances and public interest increases. It has the advantages of being portable, easy to use on an individual basis, readily available for government grants and incentives, and being flexible regarding location (though it is most efficient when used in hot, arid areas since they tend to be the most sunny).<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/> For those that are lucky, affordable rental schemes may be found.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Concentrated solar power plants are typically used on more of a community scale rather than an individual household scale, because of the amount of energy they are able to harness but can be done on an individual scale with a [[parabolic reflector]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/><ref name=\"Jeffery, Yvonne 2008\">Jeffery, Yvonne, Michael Grosvenor, and Liz Barclay. Green Living for Dummies. Indianapolis, IN: Wiley Pub., 2008. Print.</ref>\n\n[[Solar thermal energy]] is harnessed by collecting direct heat from the sun. One of the most common ways that this method is used by households is through [[solar water heating]]. In a broad perspective, these systems involve well insulated tanks for storage and collectors, are either passive or active systems (active systems have pumps that continuously circulate water through the collectors and storage tank) and, in active systems, involve either directly heating the water that will be used or heating a non-freezing heat-transfer fluid that then heats the water that will be used. Passive systems are cheaper than active systems since they do not require a pumping system (instead, they take advantage of the natural movement of hot water rising above cold water to cycle the water being used through the collector and storage tank).<ref>[http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=12850 Energy Savers: Solar Water Heaters]. Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy. US Department of Energy, 20 October 2010. Web. 28 October 2010.</ref>\n\nOther methods of harnessing solar power are [[Solar combisystem|solar space heating]] (for heating internal building spaces), solar drying (for drying wood chips, fruits, grains, etc.), [[solar cookers]], [[Solar distillation|solar distillers]], and other [[passive solar]] technologies (simply, harnessing sunlight without any mechanical means).\n\nWind power is harnessed through turbines, set on tall towers (typically 20\u2019 or 6m with 10\u2018 or 3m diameter blades for an individual household's needs) that power a generator that creates electricity.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/> They typically require an average of wind speed of 9&nbsp;mi/hr (14&nbsp;km/hr) to be worth their investment (as prescribed by the US Department of Energy), and are capable of paying for themselves within their lifetimes. Wind turbines in urban areas usually need to be mounted at least 30\u2019 (10m) in the air to receive enough wind and to be void of nearby obstructions (such as neighboring buildings). Mounting a wind turbine may also require permission from authorities. Wind turbines have been criticized for the noise they produce, their appearance, and the argument that they can affect the migratory patterns of birds (their blades obstruct passage in the sky). Wind turbines are much more feasible for those living in rural areas<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> and are one of the most cost-effective forms of renewable energy per kilowatt, approaching the cost of fossil fuels, and have quick paybacks.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>\n\nFor those that have a body of water flowing at an adequate speed (or falling from an adequate height) on their property, [[hydroelectricity]] may be an option. On a large scale, hydroelectricity, in the form of dams, has adverse environmental and social impacts. When on a small scale, however, in the form of single turbines, hydroelectricity is very sustainable. Single water turbines or even a group of single turbines are not environmentally or socially disruptive. On an individual household basis, single turbines are the probably the only economically feasible route (but can have high paybacks and is one of the most efficient methods of renewable energy production). It is more common for an eco-village to use this method rather than a singular household.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nGeothermal energy production involves harnessing the hot water or steam below the earth's surface, in reservoirs, to produce energy. Because the hot water or steam that is used is reinjected back into the reservoir, this source is considered sustainable. However, those that plan on getting their electricity from this source should be aware that there is controversy over the lifespan of each geothermal reservoir as some believe that their lifespans are naturally limited (they cool down over time, making geothermal energy production there eventually impossible). This method is often large scale as the system required to harness geothermal energy can be complex and requires deep drilling equipment. There do exist small individual scale geothermal operations, however, which harness reservoirs very close to the Earth's surface, avoiding the need for extensive drilling and sometimes even taking advantage of lakes or ponds where there is already a depression. In this case, the heat is captured and sent to a [[geothermal heat pump]] system located inside the shelter or facility that needs it (often, this heat is used directly to warm a greenhouse during the colder months).<ref name=\"Jeffery, Yvonne 2008\"/> Although geothermal energy is available everywhere on Earth, practicality and cost-effectiveness varies, directly related to the depth required to reach reservoirs. Places such as the Philippines, Hawaii,  Alaska, Iceland, California, and Nevada have geothermal reservoirs closer to the Earth's surface, making its production cost-effective.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>\n\nBiomass power is created when any biological matter is burned as fuel. As with the case of using green materials in a household, it is best to use as much locally available material as possible so as to reduce the carbon footprint created by transportation. Although burning biomass for fuel releases [[carbon dioxide]], sulfur compounds, and nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere, a major concern in a sustainable lifestyle, the amount that is released is sustainable (it will not contribute to a rise in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere). This is because the biological matter that is being burned releases the same amount of carbon dioxide that it consumed during its lifetime.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/> However, burning [[biodiesel]] and bioethanol (see [[biofuel]]) when created from virgin material, is increasingly controversial and may or may not be considered sustainable because it inadvertently increases global poverty, the clearing of more land for new agriculture fields (the source of the biofuel is also the same source of food), and may use unsustainable growing methods (such as the use of environmentally harmful pesticides and fertilizers).<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/><ref>Brown, Lester Russell.

Materials such as waste sludge can be digested to release methane gas that can then be burnt to produce electricity. Methane gas is also a natural by-product of landfills, full of decomposing waste, and can be harnessed here to produce electricity as well. The advantage in burning methane gas is that is prevents the methane from being released into the atmosphere, exacerbating the greenhouse effect. Although this method of biomass energy production is typically large scale (done in landfills), it can be done on a smaller individual or community scale as well.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>\n\n==Food==\nGlobally, food accounts for 48% and 70% of household environmental impacts on land and water resources respectively, with consumption of meat, dairy and processed food rising quickly with income<sup><ref name=\"Ivanova\"/></sup>.\n\n===Environmental impacts of industrial agriculture===\n\n[[Industrial agriculture|Industrial agricultural production]] is highly resource and energy intensive.  Industrial agriculture systems typically require heavy [[irrigation]], extensive [[Pesticide application|pesticide]] and [[Fertilizer|fertilizer application]], intensive [[tillage]], concentrated [[monoculture]] production, and other continual inputs. As a result of these industrial farming conditions, today's mounting environmental stresses are further exacerbated. These stresses include: declining [[water table]]s, chemical [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], chemical [[Surface runoff|runoff]], [[soil erosion]], [[land degradation]], loss in [[biodiversity]], and other ecological concerns.<ref>Brown, Lester R.

Norton, 2009.</ref>\n\n===Conventional food distribution and long distance transport===\n\n[[Conventional]] food distribution and long distance transport are additionally [[resource]] and [[energy]] exhaustive.  Substantial climate-disrupting [[carbon emissions]], boosted by the transport of food over long distances, are of growing concern as the world faces such [[global crisis]] as [[natural resource]] depletion, [[peak oil]] and [[climate change]].<ref>Heinberg, Richard.

''Depletion and Abundance: Life on the New Home Front''. Canada: New Society Publishers,  2008.</ref>\n\n===Local and seasonal foods===\n\nA more sustainable means of acquiring food is to purchase locally and seasonally. Buying food from local farmers reduces [[carbon output]], caused by long-distance food transport, and stimulates the local economy.<ref name=\"Astyk, Sharon 2008\"/> Local, small-scale farming operations also typically utilize more sustainable methods of agriculture than conventional industrial farming systems such as decreased tillage, [[nutrient cycling]], fostered biodiversity and reduced chemical pesticide and fertilizer applications.<ref name=\"Shiva, Vandana 2000\">Shiva, Vandana. ''Stolen Harvest: The Hijacking of the Global Food Supply''. Cambridge, MA: South End Press, 2000.</ref> Adapting a more regional, seasonally based diet is more sustainable as it entails purchasing less energy and resource demanding produce that naturally grow within a local area and require no long-distance transport. These vegetables and fruits are also grown and harvested within their suitable [[growing season]]. Thus, [[seasonal food]] farming does not require energy intensive [[greenhouse]] production, extensive irrigation, plastic packaging and long-distance transport from importing non-regional foods, and other environmental stressors.<ref name=\"Seymour, John 2003\">Seymour, John. ''The Self-Sufficient Life and How to Live It''. London: DK Publishing, 2003.</ref> Local, seasonal produce is typically fresher, unprocessed and argued to be more nutritious. Local produce also contains less to no chemical residues from applications required for long-distance shipping and handling.<ref>Princen, Thomas. ''The Logic of Sufficiency''. New York: MIT Press, 2005.</ref> [[Farmers' market]]s, public events where local small-scale farmers gather and sell their produce, are a good source for obtaining local food and knowledge about local farming productions.  As well as promoting localization of food, farmers markets are a central gathering place for community interaction.<ref name=\"Todd, J 1994\">Todd, J. and N. J. Todd. ''From Eco-Cities to Living Machines: Principles of Ecological Design''. Berkeley, CA:  North Atlantic Books, 1994.</ref>  Another way to become involved in regional food distribution is by joining a local [[community-supported agriculture]] (CSA). A CSA consists of a community of growers and consumers who pledge to support a farming operation while equally sharing the risks and benefits of food production. CSA's usually involve a system of weekly pick-ups of locally farmed vegetables and fruits, sometimes including dairy products, meat and special food items such as baked goods.<ref>Nabhan, Gary. ''Coming Home to Eat''. Berkeley, CA: W.W. Norton, 2002.</ref> Considering the previously noted rising environmental crisis, the United States and much of the world is facing immense vulnerability to famine. Local food production ensures food security if potential transportation disruptions and climatic, economical, and sociopolitical disasters were to occur.<ref name=\"Astyk, Sharon 2008\"/>\n\n===Reducing meat consumption===\n\nIndustrial meat production also involves high environmental costs such as [[land degradation]], [[soil erosion]] and depletion of [[natural resource]]s, especially pertaining to water and food.<ref name=\"Seymour, John 2003\"/> Mass meat production increase the amount of [[Atmospheric methane|methane in the atmosphere]].  For more information on the [[environmental impact of meat production]] and consumption, see the [[ethics of eating meat]]. Reducing meat consumption, perhaps to a few meals a week, or adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet, alleviates the demand for environmentally damaging industrial meat production. Buying and consuming organically raised, [[free range]] or [[Grass fed|grass fed meat]] is another alternative towards more sustainable meat consumption.<ref name=\"Shiva, Vandana 2000\"/>\n\n===Organic farming===\n\nPurchasing and supporting organic products is another fundamental contribution to sustainable living. [[Organic farming]] is a rapidly emerging trend in the food industry and in the web of sustainability. According to the [[USDA]] [[National Organic Standards Board]] (NOSB), [[organic agriculture]] is defined as \"an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity. It is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore, maintain, or enhance ecological harmony. The primary goal of organic agriculture is to optimize the health and productivity of interdependent communities of soil life, plants, animals and people.\" Upon sustaining these goals, organic agriculture uses techniques such as [[crop rotation]], [[permaculture]], [[compost]], [[green manure]] and [[biological pest control]]. In addition, organic farming prohibits or strictly limits the use of manufactured fertilizers and pesticides, [[plant growth regulators]] such as [[hormones]], livestock [[antibiotics]], [[food additives]] and [[genetically modified organisms]].<ref>[http://extension.agron.iastate.edu/organicag/whatis.html Organic Agriculture - What is Organic Agriculture?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018130008/http://extension.agron.iastate.edu/organicag/whatis.html |date=18 October 2010 }} Iowa State University. 2008.

[[Qixia District]], [[Nanjing]], China]]\nIn addition to local, small-scale farms, there has been a recent emergence in [[urban agriculture]] expanding from [[community gardens]] to private [[Residential garden|home gardens]]. With this trend, both farmers and ordinary people are becoming involved in [[food production]]. A network of urban farming systems helps to further ensure regional food security and encourages self-sufficiency and cooperative interdependence within communities.<ref>Flores, H.C. ''Food Not Lawns: How to Turn Your Yard into a Garden and Your Neighborhood into a Community''. New York: Chelsea Green, 2006.</ref> With every bite of food raised from urban gardens, negative environmental impacts are reduced in numerous ways. For instance, vegetables and fruits raised within small-scale gardens and farms are not grown with tremendous applications of [[nitrogen fertilizer]] required for industrial agricultural operations. The nitrogen fertilizers cause toxic chemical leaching and runoff that enters our water tables. Nitrogen fertilizer also produces [[nitrous oxide]], a more damaging [[greenhouse gas]] than [[carbon dioxide]]. Local, community-grown food also requires no imported, long-distance transport which further depletes our [[fossil fuel]] reserves.<ref>Nyerges, Christopher. ''Urban Wilderness: a guidebook to resourceful city living''. Culver, CA: Peace Press, 1979.</ref> In developing more efficiency per land acre, urban gardens can be started in a wide variety of areas: in vacant lots, public parks, private yards, church and school yards, on roof tops ([[roof-top garden]]s), and many other places.  Communities can work together in changing zoning limitations in order for public and private gardens to be permissible.<ref>Hemenway, Toby. ''Gaia\u2019s Garden''.

Home-grown foods can be preserved and stored outside of their growing season and continually consumed throughout the year, enhancing self-sufficiency and independence from the supermarket. Food can be preserved and saved by [[Dehydration (food)|dehydration]], [[Freezing (food)|freezing]], [[vacuum packing]], [[canning]], [[bottling]], [[pickling]] and jellying.<ref>Ciperthwaite, Wm.

To improve the current toilet, one possible method is to put weighted plastic bottles in the toilet tank.  Also, there are inexpensive tank banks or float booster available for purchase.  A tank bank is a plastic bag to be filled with water and hung in the toilet tank. A [http://www.floatbooster.com/Product.html float booster] attaches underneath the float ball of pre-1986 three and a half gallon capacity toilets.  It allows these toilets to operate at the same valve and float setting but significantly reduces their water level, saving between one and one and a third gallons of water per flush.  A major waste of water in existing toilets is leaks.  A slow toilet leak is undetectable to the eye, but can waste hundreds of gallons each month.  One way to check this is to put food dye in the tank, and to see if the water in the toilet bowl turns the same color.  In the event of a leaky flapper, one can replace it with an adjustable toilet flapper, which allows self-adjustment of the amount of water per flush.\n\nIn installing a new toilet there are a number of options to obtain the most water efficient model. A [[low flush toilet]] uses one to two gallons per flush.  Traditionally, toilets use three to five gallons per flush. If an eighteen-liter per flush toilet is removed and a six-liter per flush toilet is put in its place, 70% of the water flushed will be saved while the overall indoor water use by will be reduced by 30%.<ref>[http://urbanbuildersnyc.com/Green_Building.html Green Building Health and Environmental Considerations in Building and Renovating Today] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130194906/http://urbanbuildersnyc.com/Green_Building.html |date=30 November 2010 }} Urban Builders Group. Urban Builders Group LTD. Web. 10 November 2010.</ref> It is possible to have a toilet that uses no water.  A [[composting toilet]] treats human waste through [[composting]] and [[dehydration]], producing a valuable soil additive.<ref>[http://compostingtoilet.org/compost_toilets_explained/what_is_a_composting_toilet/index.php What is a Composting Toilet?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120223832/http://compostingtoilet.org/compost_toilets_explained/what_is_a_composting_toilet/index.php |date=20 November 2010 }} Composting Toilet World. Envirolet. 2010. Web. 10 November 2010.</ref>  These toilets feature a two-compartment bowl to separate urine from feces.  The urine can be collected or sold as fertilizer.  The feces can be dried and bagged or composted.  These toilets cost scarcely more than regularly installed toilets and do not require a sewer hookup.  In addition to providing valuable fertilizer, these toilets are highly sustainable because they save sewage collection and treatment, as well as lessen agricultural costs and improve [[topsoil]].\n\nAdditionally, one can reduce toilet water sustainability by limiting total toilet flushing. For instance, instead of flushing small wastes, such as tissues, one can dispose of these items in the trash or compost.\n\n====Showers====\n\nOn average, showers were 18% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999, at {{convert|6|-|8|USgal|L}} per minute traditionally in America.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> A simple method to reduce this use is to switch to low-flow, high-performance showerheads.  These showerheads use only 1.0-1.5 gpm or less. An alternative to replacing the showerhead is to install a converter. This device arrests a running shower upon reaching the desired temperature. [[Solar water heater]]s can be used to obtain optimal water temperature, and are more sustainable because they reduce dependence on fossil fuels. To lessen excess water use, water pipes can be insulated with pre-slit foam pipe insulation. This insulation decreases hot water generation time. A simple, straightforward method to conserve water when showering is to take shorter showers. One method to accomplish this is to turn off the water when it is not necessary (such as while lathering) and resuming the shower when water is necessary.  This can be facilitated when the plumbing or showerhead allow turning off the water without disrupting the desired temperature setting (common in the UK but not the United States).\n\n====Dishwashers and sinks====\n\nOn average, sinks were 15% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> There are, however, easy methods to rectify excessive water loss. Available for purchase is a screw-on aerator. This device works by combining water with air thus generating a frothy substance with greater perceived volume, reducing water use by half. Additionally, there is a flip-valve available that allows flow to be turned off and back on at the previously reached temperature. Finally, a [[laminar flow]] device creates a 1.5-2.4 gpm stream of water that reduces water use by half, but can be turned to normal water level when optimal.\n\nIn addition to buying the above devices, one can live more sustainably by checking sinks for leaks, and fixing these links if they exist. According to the EPA, \"A small drip from a worn faucet washer can waste 20 gallons of water per day, while larger leaks can waste hundreds of gallons\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> When washing dishes by hand, it is not necessary to leave the water running for rinsing, and it is more efficient to rinse dishes simultaneously.\n\nOn average, dishwashing consumes 1% of indoor water use.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> When using a [[dishwasher]], water can be conserved by only running the machine when it is full.  Some have a \"low flow\" setting to use less water per wash cycle. Enzymatic [[detergents]] clean dishes more efficiently and more successfully with a smaller amount of water at a lower temperature.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n====Washing machines====\n\nOn average, 23% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999 was due to clothes washing.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In contrast to other machines, American [[washing machines]] have changed little to become more sustainable. A typical washing machine has a vertical-axis design, in which clothes are agitated in a tubful of water. Horizontal-axis machines, in contrast, put less water into the bottom of the rub and rotate clothes through it. These machines are more efficient in terms of soap use and clothing stability.\n\n===Outdoor water use===\n\nThere are a number of ways one can incorporate a personal [[yard]], [[roof]], and [[garden]] in more sustainable living. While conserving water is a major element of sustainability, so is sequestering water.\n\n====Conserving water====\n\nIn planning a yard and garden space, it is most sustainable to consider the plants, soil, and available water.  Drought resistant shrubs, plants, and grasses require a smaller amount of water in comparison to more traditional species.  Additionally, native plants (as opposed to herbaceous perennials) will use a smaller supply of water and have a heightened resistance to plant diseases of the area. [[Xeriscaping]] is a technique that selects drought-tolerant plants and accounts for endemic features such as [[slope]], [[soil type]], and [[native plant]] range.  It can reduce landscape water use by 50 \u2013 70%, while providing [[habitat]] space for wildlife.  Plants on slopes help reduce [[Surface runoff|runoff]] by slowing and absorbing accumulated rainfall.  Grouping plants by watering needs further reduces water waste.\n\nAfter planting, placing a circumference of [[mulch]] surrounding plants functions to lessen [[evaporation]].  To do this, firmly press two to four inches of organic matter along the plant's dripline. This prevents [[water runoff]]. When watering, consider the range of sprinklers; watering paved areas is unnecessary.  Additionally, to conserve the maximum amount of water, watering should be carried out during early mornings on non-windy days to reduce water loss to evaporation.  Drip-irrigation systems and soaker hoses are a more sustainable alternative to the traditional sprinkler system.  Drip-irrigation systems employ small gaps at standard distances in a hose, leading to the slow trickle of water droplets which percolate the soil over a protracted period.  These systems use 30 \u2013 50% less water than conventional methods.<ref>Pinkham, R. and Dyer, J., 1993: \"Linking Water and Energy Savings in Irrigation,\" Rocky Mountain Institute Publication #A94-4.</ref> Soaker hoses help to reduce water use by up to 90%.<ref>[http://www.savingwater.org/docs/successwithsoakerhoses.pdf Soaker Hoses: Good for your Garden, Your Wallet, and Our Environment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011035501/http://www.savingwater.org/docs/successwithsoakerhoses.pdf |date=11 October 2010 }} Saving Water Partnership. Seattle and Participating Area Water Utilities. 2005. Web. 10 November 2010.</ref>  They connect to a garden hose and lay along the row of plants under a layer of mulch.  A layer of [[organic material]] added to the soil helps to increase its absorption and water retention; previously planted areas can be covered with [[compost]].\n\nIn caring for a lawn, there are a number of measures that can increase the sustainability of lawn maintenance techniques.  A primary aspect of lawn care is watering.  To conserve water, it is important to only water when necessary, and to deep soak when watering.  Additionally, a lawn may be left to go dormant, renewing after a dry spell to its original vitality.\n\n====Sequestering water====\n\nA common method of water sequestrations is [[rainwater harvesting]], which incorporates the collection and storage of rain.  Primarily, the rain is obtained from a roof, and stored on the ground in catchment tanks.  Water sequestration varies based on extent, cost, and complexity. A simple method involves a single barrel at the bottom of a downspout, while a more complex method involves multiple tanks.  It is highly sustainable to use stored water in place of purified water for activities such as irrigation and flushing toilets.  Additionally, using stored rainwater reduces the amount of runoff [[pollution]], picked up from roofs and pavements that would normally enter streams through storm drains.  The following equation can be used to estimate annual water supply:\n\nCollection area (square feet) \u00d7 Rainfall (inch/year) / 12 (inch/foot) = Cubic Feet of Water/Year\n\nCubic Feet/Year \u00d7 7.43 (Gallons/Cubic Foot) = Gallons/year\n\nNote, however, this calculation does not account for losses such as evaporation or leakage.<ref>[http://www.portlandonline.com/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=182095 How to Manage Stormwater: Rain Barrels]. Stormwater Management for Clean Rivers. Environmental Services. Web. 10 November 2010</ref>\n\n[[Greywater]] systems function in sequestering used indoor water, such as laundry, bath and sink water, and filtering it for reuse.  Greywater can be reused in [[irrigation]] and toilet flushing.  There are two types of greywater systems: gravity fed manual systems and package systems.<ref name=\"greenbuildingsupply1\">[http://www.greenbuildingsupply.com/Public/Energy-WaterConservation/GreywaterSystems/index.cfm Greywater Systems: Reusing Bath, Laundry, and Sink Water to Conserve Fresh Water]. Green Building Supply. 2010. Web. 10 November 2010.</ref>  The manual systems do not require electricity but may require a larger yard space.<ref name=\"greenbuildingsupply1\"/>  The package systems require electricity but are self-contained and can be installed indoors.<ref name=\"greenbuildingsupply1\"/>\n\n==Waste==\n\nAs populations and resource demands climb, waste production contributes to [[Greenhouse gas#Greenhouse gas emissions|emissions]] of [[carbon dioxide]], leaching of hazardous materials into the soil and waterways, and [[methane emissions]].  In America alone, over the course of a decade, 500 trillion pounds of American resources will have been transformed into nonproductive wastes and gases.<ref name=\"HawkenPaul\" /> Thus, a crucial component of sustainable living is being waste conscious.  One can do this by reducing waste, reusing commodities, and recycling.\n\nThere are a number of ways to reduce waste in sustainable living.  Two methods to reduce paper waste are canceling junk mail like [https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t credit card and insurance offers] and [http://www.dmachoice.org/ direct mail marketing] and changing monthly paper statements to paperless emails.  Junk mail alone accounted for 1.72 million tons of landfill waste in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.catalogchoice.org/environmental-facts|title=CatalogChoice Mail Preference Service - Put an end to junk mail, catalogs, and phone books.|website=CatalogChoice Mail Preference Service|accessdate=11 May 2018}}</ref> Another method to reduce waste is to buy in bulk, reducing packaging materials. Preventing food waste can limit the amount of organic waste sent to landfills producing the powerful greenhouse gas methane.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://earthwormtechnologies.com/about-us/|title=Our Story|first=Earthworm|last=Technologies\u00ae|accessdate=11 May 2018}}</ref> Another example of waste reduction involves being cognizant of purchasing excessive amounts when buying materials with limited use like cans of paint. Non-hazardous or less hazardous alternatives can also limit the toxicity of waste.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/recycle.htm Reduce] United States Environmental Protection Agency. 5 May 2010. Web 10 November 2010</ref>\n\nBy reusing materials, one lives more sustainably by not contributing to the addition of waste to landfills. Reusing saves [[natural resources]] by decreasing the necessity of [[raw material]] extraction. For example, reusable bags can reduce the amount of waste created by grocery shopping eliminating the need to create and ship plastic bags and the need to manage their disposal and recycling or polluting effects.\n\n[[Recycling]], a process that breaks down used items into raw materials to make new materials, is a particularly useful means of contributing to the renewal of goods.  Recycling incorporates three primary processes; collection and processing, manufacturing, and purchasing recycled products.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/recycle.htm Wastes \u2013 Resource Conservation \u2013 Reduce, Reuse, Recycle] United States Environmental Protection Agency.  5 May 2010. Web 10 November 2010</ref>  A natural example of recycling involves using food waste as compost to enrich the quality of soil, which can be carried out at home or locally with community [[composting]]. An offshoot of recycling, [[upcycling]], strives to convert material into something of similar or greater value in its second life.<ref>[http://www.sustainabilitydictionary.com/u/upcycle.php UpCycle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112170212/http://www.sustainabilitydictionary.com/u/upcycle.php |date=12 November 2010 }} Sustainability Management. Presidio Graduate School. Web. 10 November 2010</ref> By integrating measures of reusing, reducing, and recycling one can effectively reduce personal waste and use materials in a more sustainable manner.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Environment|Earth sciences|Ecology|Renewable Energy|Energy}}\n{{div col}}\n*[[Circles of Sustainability]]\n* [[Citizen science#Plastics and pollution|Citizen Science]], cleanup projects that people can take part in.\n*[[Cradle-to-cradle design]]\n*[[Circular economy]]\n*[[Climate-friendly gardening]]\n*[[Downshifting (lifestyle)|Downshifting]]\n*[[Eco-communalism]]\n*[[Ecodesign]]\n*[[Ecological economics]]\n*[[Ethical consumerism]]\n*[[Foodscaping]]\n*[[Frugality]]\n*[[Simple living]]\n*[[Sustainability]]\n*[[Sustainable architecture]]\n*[[Sustainable design]]\n*[[Sustainable development]]\n*[[Sustainable event management]]\n*[[Sustainable landscaping]]\n*[[Sustainable House Day]] (in Australia)\n*[[Permaculture]]\n*[[The Venus Project]]\n*[[Transition Towns]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://inherit.eu/ INHERIT Project], a [[Horizon 2020]] Project to identify ways of living, moving and consuming that protect the environment and promote health and health equity.\n<!-- This is not a section to advertise a website, product, event or forum related to sustainable living.

The U.S. position before the Paris conference favored, like the British and French, a separation along ethnographic lines, i.e., a border along the river [[Drava]] (German: ''Drau''), which would have split the economic and geographic region of the [[Klagenfurt]] basin. The Yugoslavs also favored this solution. Miles became instrumental in reversing this position.\n\nIn his field travels, he learned that many of the Slovene speakers in the region actually preferred to belong to Austria and had closer economic ties to the Klagenfurt area than to Slovenia. He proposed, instead, a border along the [[Karawanks]] further south. Through his reports, he was able to convince his superiors that the best way to settle the question was through self-determination. The U.S. team eventually convinced the British and French delegations in Paris, and finally it was decided that the area should remain undivided, and that the question of whether it should henceforth belong to Austria or to Yugoslavia was to be decided by a vote among the population of the area.

The U.S. position before the Paris conference favored, like the British and French, a separation along ethnographic lines, i.e., a border along the river [[Drava]] (German: ''Drau''), which would have split the economic and geographic region of the [[Klagenfurt]] basin. The Yugoslavs also favored this solution. Miles became instrumental in reversing this position.\n\nIn his field travels, he learned that many of the Slovene speakers in the region actually preferred to belong to Austria and had closer economic ties to the Klagenfurt area than to Slovenia. He proposed, instead, a border along the [[Karawanks]] further south. Through his reports, he was able to convince his superiors that the best way to settle the question was through self-determination. The U.S. team eventually convinced the British and French delegations in Paris, and finally it was decided that the area should remain undivided, and that the question of whether it should henceforth belong to Austria or to Yugoslavia was to be decided by a vote among the population of the area. In the [[Carinthian Plebiscite|plebiscite held on October 10, 1920]], the population voted for Miles' border proposal.<ref name=\"ehrfeld\">Fr\u00e4ss-Ehrfeld, Claudia: \"[https://digital.lib.washington.edu/ojs/index.php/ssj/article/viewFile/3612/3025 The Role of the United States of America and the Carinthian Question, 1918-1920]\", ''Slovene Studies '''8'''/1 (1986)'', pp.&nbsp;7&ndash;13.

FauntLeRoy as cinematographer.\n\n== Plot ==\n\n===Book I: ''North and South''===\n* '''Episode 1''' (summer 1842 \u2013 summer 1844) \u2013 Young Southerner Orry Main, the firstborn son of a wealthy South Carolina plantation owner, decides to go to [[United States Military Academy|West Point]].  On his way to the train station, he rescues and falls in love with the beautiful [[French people|French]]-[[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] southern belle from New Orleans, Madeline Fabray. In New York City, Orry meets Northerner George Hazard, the second son of a wealthy Pennsylvania steel-factory owner, who is also on his way to West Point. They quickly become close friends. At the Academy, they meet classmates [[George Pickett]], [[George McClellan]], [[Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson]] and a senior student named [[Ulysses Grant]]. They also meet the amoral egomaniac Elkanah Bent, a fellow cadet from Georgia.   Bent is a handsome, smooth-talking man who hides his evil, twisted nature beneath his charm and good looks. He takes an instant dislike to Orry and George and uses his status as their drillmaster to constantly harass them. Orry constantly writes letters to Madeline, although it seems that she has not been responding to him.  After two years of training, the men return home for a summer leave. George's sister, Virgilia, is a passionate abolitionist and immediately takes a dislike to Orry when she finds out that his family keeps slaves. While at home, Orry is devastated to learn that Madeline is marrying his cruel neighbor, plantation owner Justin LaMotte. Orry has an argument with his father over the hiring of the brutal and [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] Salem Jones as the plantation's overseer. Orry stops Jones from using a bullwhip to \"punish\" one of the slaves, sparking a tense relationship between the two. After Orry witnesses Madeline's marriage, they privately speak to each other afterwards and find out that Madeline's father has been hiding Orry's letters to ensure that she would marry Justin. That night, Justin hits and rapes Madeline, leaving her broken.\n\n* '''Episode 2''' (autumn 1844 \u2013 spring 1848) \u2013 Bent continues his cruelty towards George, Orry, and their friends. The men, with some help from other cadets, arrange for Bent to be caught with a prostitute and he is forced to leave the Academy. When Bent learns that Orry and George were involved, he vows revenge. George and Orry graduate from West Point. They leave to fight in the [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican War]]. During the [[Battle of Churubusco]], Bent, who has blackmailed his father (Bent is an illegitimate son of a US senator) in order to obtain a superior rank, orders George and Orry to lead a suicidal charge against the Mexican forces. Both men survive, but Orry is shot in his left leg and permanently crippled. Meanwhile, George meets Constance Flynn, the Irish Catholic daughter of an Army surgeon, and falls in love. They plan to marry. Orry drowns his sorrows in alcoholism. With the Mexican War over, George quits the army, finds Bent, and beats him, threatening to kill him if he ever tries to harm him or Orry again. Traumatized by his injuries, Orry temporarily becomes a recluse. When Madeline helps Priam, one of Orry's slaves, escape, one of the other slaves gets whipped for helping Priam.\n\n* '''Episode 3''' (spring 1848 \u2013 summer 1854) George gets married to Constance and Orry is his best man. Orry and Madeline become secret lovers. A terrible fire erupts at Hazard Iron and kills many of the workers due to George's older brother, Stanley, making a greedy decision. All authority over Hazard Iron is handed to George, greatly displeasing Stanley and his wife, Isabel. Orry's father dies, leaving Orry to inherit the family plantation. His first act is to fire the brutal Salem Jones as overseer. Jones vows revenge. Orry's cousin Charles, who does not have good relations with the Main family, is challenged to a pistol duel in a dispute over an engaged woman. Orry, as Charles' second, begrudgingly helps Charles to survive the duel and they become close. The Mains visit the Hazards in Pennsylvania. Billy and Charles plan to attend West Point together, just as Orry and George did. Orry's sister Ashton purposely courts George's younger brother Billy, whom Brett has come to fancy. Orry and George begin a partnership cotton mill at Orry's plantation in South Carolina; they do so on George's condition that Orry not use slave labor in the mill. Virgilia is furious that her family has allowed slave owners into their house and tries to humiliate them, angering the rest of her family.\n\n* '''Episode 4''' (summer 1854 \u2013 autumn 1856) \u2013 The Hazards visit the Mains in South Carolina. Billy discovers how selfish and seductive Ashton can be and falls in love with Ashton's younger and kinder sister, Brett, much to Ashton's jealousy. George's sister Virgilia enters a passionate relationship with Grady, the proud and aggressive coachman of James Huntoon, an ambitious but easily manipulated South Carolina politician, who is also a strong suitor of Ashton, and helps Grady escape from slavery. Ashton, however, becomes aware of Virgilia's involvement and informs James, as well as announcing it in the Hazard family's presence. On his deathbed, Madeline's father tells her that her maternal great-grandmother was black. Billy and Charles graduate from West Point, and both families attend the graduation. Ashton sleeps with many of Billy's friends, still bitter over his rejection and attraction to Brett, which Charles is furious to discover, but keeps secret for the family's sake. Ashton gets pregnant and begs Madeline for help, who takes her to a local midwife to perform a secret abortion. When Madeline lies to Justin about where she was when she was away helping Ashton, he beats Madeline, locks her in a spare bedroom to starve, and kills Maum Sally for trying to help Madeline escape.\n\n* '''Episode 5''' (spring 1857 \u2013 November 1860) \u2013 Madeline is drugged by Justin into becoming robotic and submissive and disappears from society, even forgetting her love for Orry. Ashton marries James Huntoon, though she doesn't plan on being a committed wife. Elkanah Bent befriends James Huntoon, and subtly interrogates him at a brothel about the people in his wedding picture, including Orry, Ashton, and Madeline. Bent recognizes the resemblance between Madeline and the painting of a former popular prostitute that worked there. Orry visits George, but Virgilia's views cause a serious argument to ensue over the issue of slavery. Orry does not want Brett to marry Billy because of the growing tensions between the North and South. Virgilia and Grady both join abolitionist leader [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]. In 1859, Brown makes his famous raid on Harper's Ferry, Virginia, to arm and free the slaves there. The U.S. Army stops the raid, Virgilia's husband Grady and Priam are killed, and Brown is captured. Virgilia escapes, but is more bitter than ever towards Southerners.  [[Abraham Lincoln]] is elected president; several Southern states make plans to secede from the U.S. and establish themselves as a separate nation.\n\n* '''Episode 6''' (November 6, 1860 \u2013 April 1861) \u2013 Having argued with Orry, now a bitter drunk, Brett has fled to Ashton's house in Charleston and runs into Billy, who is stationed at Fort Sumter. Ashton, however, still holds a grudge against Billy and conspires with Justin's nephew and her lover, Forbes LaMotte, to harm them both. George visits Orry and the two apologize to each other after years of estrangement. Orry gives Brett his blessing to marry Billy. South Carolina secedes from the Union, infuriating Orry. Ashton schemes to have Billy killed, partly out of jealousy, and partly because Billy is now a \"Yankee\" enemy in the eyes of the South. She fails, however, due to a drugged Madeline, who overhears Justin and Forbes discussing it. Her memories come back and she runs to inform Orry after fending off Justin.  After stopping Billy and Brett on their way to the train station, Forbes provokes Billy into a rigged pistol duel, which turns into a full-fledged fight after Charles arrives, resulting in Forbes' death. Orry is enraged at Ashton and disowns her, with her vowing revenge. Justin comes looking for Madeline, as she has taken refuge with Orry at Mont Royal, but is forced to leave with a warning. Now off the drugs and with her memories returned, Madeline plans to divorce Justin and marry Orry. Orry visits the Hazard mansion near Philadelphia to give George his part of their cotton mill money. When he arrives, Orry discovers that George and Constance now have a baby girl named Hope. Virgilia finds out that Orry is present and tries to have him killed by forming a lynch mob which threatens the Hazard estate; the mob's leaders demand that George hand Orry over to them, leaving little doubt that their intentions are to kill him.  George and Orry face off against the mob with shotguns and Orry boards a train to return to South Carolina. The two friends part, unsure if they will ever see each other again. The Civil War begins.\n\n===Book II: ''Love and War''===\n* '''Episode 1''' (June 1861 \u2013 July 21, 1861) \u2013 Orry and Charles, now officers in the [[Confederate Army]], leave the Main family plantation for the war in Virginia. Orry, despite having been against secession, becomes a general and military aide to Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] in the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. Meanwhile, George and Billy are in [[Washington, D.C.]], where they are officers in the U.S. Army. Billy joins the U.S. Sharpshooters regiment, while George becomes a military aide to U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Charles, a Confederate cavalry officer, meets Augusta Barclay, a Virginia belle who smuggles medicine for the southern soldiers. Virgilia wants to work as a nurse at a Washington, D.C. military hospital and asks Congressman Sam Greene, a fellow abolitionist, for help. Orry's cruel and manipulative sister Ashton meets her match in Elkanah Bent, who sees the Civil War as a great way to get rich by smuggling forbidden luxury goods through the U.S. Navy blockade of the South. Bent and Ashton quickly become lovers, while Ashton's politician husband, James Huntoon, is unaware of his wife's adultery. With Orry and Charles gone to war, Justin kidnaps Madeline from the Main family plantation and burns the cotton barn; Orry's mother is injured trying to stop the fire. The [[First Battle of Bull Run]] takes place with George and Constance getting caught up in the panicked aftermath as they reluctantly watch from a distance. The South is the winner.\n\n* '''Episode 2''' (July 1861 \u2013 summer 1862) \u2013 Hearing about her mother's injury, Brett and one of the Main household servants, Semiramis, make the dangerous trip from Washington, D.C. to the Main plantation in South Carolina. Along the way, Semiramis is captured by Union soldiers, but rescued by Brett. Orry leaves Richmond and returns to South Carolina as well; he finds Madeline at Justin's plantation and kills Justin in a fight. Orry and Madeline finally get married. Orry discovers Bent's illegal smuggling enterprise and stops it by capturing Bent's blockade runners, arresting his men, and destroying most of his merchandise. Bent and Ashton vow revenge. Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, George's older brother Stanley takes over the family's steel factories. His greedy wife Isabel talks him into profiteering from the war by using cheap, low-grade iron to make cannons for the U.S. Army; the cannons often explode and kill Northern soldiers. They forge George's name on the documents, in case the cannons are traced back to Hazard Iron.\n\n* '''Episode 3''' (September 17, 1862 \u2013 spring 1864) \u2013 At the bloody battle of [[Antietam]], Charles and Billy nearly kill each other, but each allows the other to escape. Charles's friend Ambrose is killed in the battle by one of the poor-quality cannons made by Hazard Iron. Afterwards, President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Emancipation Proclamation]] frees the slaves in the rebel Southern states. Most of the slaves leave the Main plantation in South Carolina, but a few remain. Ashton visits her family's plantation, supposedly to see her recovering mother and sister Brett, but in reality to carry out Bent's revenge against Orry. Ashton tells Madeline that she knows that Madeline's mother was a high-priced, [[Quadroon|part-black]] prostitute in New Orleans, and that, unless Madeline leaves Orry with no explanation, she will reveal this secret and ruin Orry's public reputation. Madeline flees to Charleston where she is befriended by a suave gambler Rafe Baudeen and begins working for the city's poor and orphans who are suffering from the war. Following the Union victory at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], Billy, sick of not having seen his wife Brett for nearly two years, goes [[AWOL]] from the U.S. Army and makes his way to South Carolina, where he and Brett spend some time together. Ashton discovers Billy's presence and goes to tell the local authorities, but Billy is saved when Brett threatens her sister with a pitchfork long enough for Billy to escape.\n\n* '''Episode 4''' (May 1864 \u2013 late autumn 1864) \u2013 When Billy returns to his regiment, his commanding officer threatens to court-martial and execute him if he ever leaves again. Billy is also placed in harm's way by being put in charge of the regiment's skirmishers. George is captured in a raid by Southern forces and taken to the dreaded [[Libby Prison]] in Richmond, where he is tortured by Captain Turner, the prison's psychotic commandant. Orry is shot and taken to the hospital where Virgilia works; despite her hatred of Southerners, she helps him recover and looks the other way, allowing him to escape. Later, Virgilia is accused of allowing a wounded Southern soldier to die and is fired from the hospital. In a fit of rage, Virgilia pushes the elderly chief nurse Mrs. Neal, causing her to lose her balance and tumble to the floor. Believing Mrs. Neal to be dead, Virgilia panics and flees the hospital. Desperate for money and a hiding place, she goes to Congressman Greene for help. He gives her money and protection in exchange for sex. Charles saves Augusta from being raped by Northern soldiers at her farm in Virginia, and the two become lovers.\n\n* '''Episode 5''' (December 1864 \u2013 February 1865) \u2013 The war has turned against the South. Orry and Charles save George from Libby Prison, kill Turner in a fight, and allow George to return to the North. Madeline helps starving people in Charleston. Returning home, George learns of his brother and sister-in-law's illegal business schemes to use cheap iron to build cannon, and forces Stanley and Isabel to admit guilt. Bent tries to kill Madeline in Charleston, but she is rescued by her gambler friend Rafe, who saves Madeline but is fatally shot by Bent. Bent enlists James Huntoon for help in his plot to overthrow the Confederate government. Although he is still oblivious to Bent's and Ashton's affair, Huntoon acts as a double agent gathering intelligence on the planned [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and reporting the activities to [[Jefferson Davis]]. The Confederate President orders Orry to squash the planned revolution. In a final fight, Orry and Huntoon attack Bent's hideout near Richmond. Bent is (apparently) killed when the ammunition he was hiding in a barn explodes. Ashton confesses her affair to James, conspiring to have Billy killed, her past abortion, and tells Orry that she helped Bent drive Madeline away. Orry once more disowns Ashton in fury for her secrets and actions against both the Main and Hazard families, and tells Huntoon that he never wants to see his sister again. Ashton begs Huntoon's forgiveness, but he tells her that it is too late, hinting that he, also in anger for her betrayal of their marriage, never wants to see her again as well.\n\n* '''Episode 6''' (March 1865 \u2013 April 1865) \u2013 The fighting ends with a Northern victory. Orry and George lead troops against each other in the last major battle at [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg]]; Orry is wounded. Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]] surrenders the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] to U.S. Army General [[Ulysses Grant]], negotiating the terms of surrender at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]]. With the war over, Charles goes to Augusta's farm and finds that she has died giving birth to his child, a son. He goes to Charleston and gets his child from Augusta's uncle's wife. Billy also quits the army and reunites with Brett at her family's plantation. Congressman Greene ends his affair with Virgilia, which he thinks detrimental to his political career. Virgilia learns that Greene had been lying to her about the seriousness of the charges and using Virgilia's dependence for his own gratification; she murders the congressman and is sentenced to death by hanging. She and George have a tearful farewell before her execution. George learns that Orry is wounded and searches for him, finally finding him in a Union hospital. Their reunion is spoiled when both learn that President Lincoln [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|has been shot]]. George helps Orry find Madeline, who reveals that Orry is now the father of their son. Orry, Madeline, their baby, and George all set out for the Main plantation. Salem Jones, the cruel former overseer of the Main plantation, joins with one of the Main's former slaves, Cuffey, in an attack on the Main plantation; they burn the mansion before being killed or driven off by Charles, Billy, and Ezra, a former slave who is engaged to marry Semiramis. Orry, George, and Madeline arrive, with the former two helping to fend off the last of the attackers. \u039frry's mother is killed in the attack by Cuffey while trying to prevent Semiramis' rape, but Cuffey is shot dead by Charles, while Salem Jones is shot dead by Brett when he is about to shoot Billy. Orry and George pledge to renew their family's friendship, and George agrees to help Orry rebuild his plantation home by reopening the cotton mill and letting Orry take the profits. The two families depart the burned out and collapsed remains of Mont Royal to prepare for the future.\n\n===Book III: ''Heaven and Hell''===\n* '''Episode 1''' (summer 1865 \u2013 autumn 1865) \u2013 Elkanah Bent, having survived the explosion of his hidden ammunition depot near Richmond, becomes obsessed with getting his \"final revenge\" on Orry and George, whom he blames for his failures in life.

When Bent goes as far as telling her he has no intention of renewing their former partnership and had only been using her for his own personal goals, furious, Ashton tries unsuccessfully to kill Bent and avenge Orry, despite the bad blood between the two siblings; she then moves to the West to start a new life. Heartbroken at Orry's death, Madeline tries to rebuild the Main family mansion at Mont Royal and helps local freed slaves, to the disapproval of most of her white neighbors.

FauntLeRoy as cinematographer.\n\n== Plot ==\n\n===Book I: ''North and South''===\n* '''Episode 1''' (summer 1842 \u2013 summer 1844) \u2013 Young Southerner Orry Main, the firstborn son of a wealthy South Carolina plantation owner, decides to go to [[United States Military Academy|West Point]].  On his way to the train station, he rescues and falls in love with the beautiful [[French people|French]]-[[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] southern belle from New Orleans, Madeline Fabray. In New York City, Orry meets Northerner George Hazard, the second son of a wealthy Pennsylvania steel-factory owner, who is also on his way to West Point. They quickly become close friends. At the Academy, they meet classmates [[George Pickett]], [[George McClellan]], [[Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson]] and a senior student named [[Ulysses Grant]]. They also meet the amoral egomaniac Elkanah Bent, a fellow cadet from Georgia.   Bent is a handsome, smooth-talking man who hides his evil, twisted nature beneath his charm and good looks. He takes an instant dislike to Orry and George and uses his status as their drillmaster to constantly harass them. Orry constantly writes letters to Madeline, although it seems that she has not been responding to him.  After two years of training, the men return home for a summer leave. George's sister, Virgilia, is a passionate abolitionist and immediately takes a dislike to Orry when she finds out that his family keeps slaves. While at home, Orry is devastated to learn that Madeline is marrying his cruel neighbor, plantation owner Justin LaMotte. Orry has an argument with his father over the hiring of the brutal and [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] Salem Jones as the plantation's overseer. Orry stops Jones from using a bullwhip to \"punish\" one of the slaves, sparking a tense relationship between the two. After Orry witnesses Madeline's marriage, they privately speak to each other afterwards and find out that Madeline's father has been hiding Orry's letters to ensure that she would marry Justin. That night, Justin hits and rapes Madeline, leaving her broken.\n\n* '''Episode 2''' (autumn 1844 \u2013 spring 1848) \u2013 Bent continues his cruelty towards George, Orry, and their friends. The men, with some help from other cadets, arrange for Bent to be caught with a prostitute and he is forced to leave the Academy. When Bent learns that Orry and George were involved, he vows revenge. George and Orry graduate from West Point. They leave to fight in the [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican War]]. During the [[Battle of Churubusco]], Bent, who has blackmailed his father (Bent is an illegitimate son of a US senator) in order to obtain a superior rank, orders George and Orry to lead a suicidal charge against the Mexican forces. Both men survive, but Orry is shot in his left leg and permanently crippled. Meanwhile, George meets Constance Flynn, the Irish Catholic daughter of an Army surgeon, and falls in love. They plan to marry. Orry drowns his sorrows in alcoholism. With the Mexican War over, George quits the army, finds Bent, and beats him, threatening to kill him if he ever tries to harm him or Orry again. Traumatized by his injuries, Orry temporarily becomes a recluse. When Madeline helps Priam, one of Orry's slaves, escape, one of the other slaves gets whipped for helping Priam.\n\n* '''Episode 3''' (spring 1848 \u2013 summer 1854) George gets married to Constance and Orry is his best man. Orry and Madeline become secret lovers. A terrible fire erupts at Hazard Iron and kills many of the workers due to George's older brother, Stanley, making a greedy decision. All authority over Hazard Iron is handed to George, greatly displeasing Stanley and his wife, Isabel. Orry's father dies, leaving Orry to inherit the family plantation. His first act is to fire the brutal Salem Jones as overseer. Jones vows revenge. Orry's cousin Charles, who does not have good relations with the Main family, is challenged to a pistol duel in a dispute over an engaged woman. Orry, as Charles' second, begrudgingly helps Charles to survive the duel and they become close. The Mains visit the Hazards in Pennsylvania. Billy and Charles plan to attend West Point together, just as Orry and George did. Orry's sister Ashton purposely courts George's younger brother Billy, whom Brett has come to fancy. Orry and George begin a partnership cotton mill at Orry's plantation in South Carolina; they do so on George's condition that Orry not use slave labor in the mill. Virgilia is furious that her family has allowed slave owners into their house and tries to humiliate them, angering the rest of her family.\n\n* '''Episode 4''' (summer 1854 \u2013 autumn 1856) \u2013 The Hazards visit the Mains in South Carolina. Billy discovers how selfish and seductive Ashton can be and falls in love with Ashton's younger and kinder sister, Brett, much to Ashton's jealousy. George's sister Virgilia enters a passionate relationship with Grady, the proud and aggressive coachman of James Huntoon, an ambitious but easily manipulated South Carolina politician, who is also a strong suitor of Ashton, and helps Grady escape from slavery. Ashton, however, becomes aware of Virgilia's involvement and informs James, as well as announcing it in the Hazard family's presence. On his deathbed, Madeline's father tells her that her maternal great-grandmother was black. Billy and Charles graduate from West Point, and both families attend the graduation. Ashton sleeps with many of Billy's friends, still bitter over his rejection and attraction to Brett, which Charles is furious to discover, but keeps secret for the family's sake. Ashton gets pregnant and begs Madeline for help, who takes her to a local midwife to perform a secret abortion. When Madeline lies to Justin about where she was when she was away helping Ashton, he beats Madeline, locks her in a spare bedroom to starve, and kills Maum Sally for trying to help Madeline escape.\n\n* '''Episode 5''' (spring 1857 \u2013 November 1860) \u2013 Madeline is drugged by Justin into becoming robotic and submissive and disappears from society, even forgetting her love for Orry. Ashton marries James Huntoon, though she doesn't plan on being a committed wife. Elkanah Bent befriends James Huntoon, and subtly interrogates him at a brothel about the people in his wedding picture, including Orry, Ashton, and Madeline. Bent recognizes the resemblance between Madeline and the painting of a former popular prostitute that worked there. Orry visits George, but Virgilia's views cause a serious argument to ensue over the issue of slavery. Orry does not want Brett to marry Billy because of the growing tensions between the North and South. Virgilia and Grady both join abolitionist leader [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]. In 1859, Brown makes his famous raid on Harper's Ferry, Virginia, to arm and free the slaves there. The U.S. Army stops the raid, Virgilia's husband Grady and Priam are killed, and Brown is captured. Virgilia escapes, but is more bitter than ever towards Southerners.  [[Abraham Lincoln]] is elected president; several Southern states make plans to secede from the U.S. and establish themselves as a separate nation.\n\n* '''Episode 6''' (November 6, 1860 \u2013 April 1861) \u2013 Having argued with Orry, now a bitter drunk, Brett has fled to Ashton's house in Charleston and runs into Billy, who is stationed at Fort Sumter. Ashton, however, still holds a grudge against Billy and conspires with Justin's nephew and her lover, Forbes LaMotte, to harm them both. George visits Orry and the two apologize to each other after years of estrangement. Orry gives Brett his blessing to marry Billy. South Carolina secedes from the Union, infuriating Orry. Ashton schemes to have Billy killed, partly out of jealousy, and partly because Billy is now a \"Yankee\" enemy in the eyes of the South. She fails, however, due to a drugged Madeline, who overhears Justin and Forbes discussing it. Her memories come back and she runs to inform Orry after fending off Justin.  After stopping Billy and Brett on their way to the train station, Forbes provokes Billy into a rigged pistol duel, which turns into a full-fledged fight after Charles arrives, resulting in Forbes' death. Orry is enraged at Ashton and disowns her, with her vowing revenge. Justin comes looking for Madeline, as she has taken refuge with Orry at Mont Royal, but is forced to leave with a warning. Now off the drugs and with her memories returned, Madeline plans to divorce Justin and marry Orry. Orry visits the Hazard mansion near Philadelphia to give George his part of their cotton mill money. When he arrives, Orry discovers that George and Constance now have a baby girl named Hope. Virgilia finds out that Orry is present and tries to have him killed by forming a lynch mob which threatens the Hazard estate; the mob's leaders demand that George hand Orry over to them, leaving little doubt that their intentions are to kill him.  George and Orry face off against the mob with shotguns and Orry boards a train to return to South Carolina. The two friends part, unsure if they will ever see each other again. The Civil War begins.\n\n===Book II: ''Love and War''===\n* '''Episode 1''' (June 1861 \u2013 July 21, 1861) \u2013 Orry and Charles, now officers in the [[Confederate Army]], leave the Main family plantation for the war in Virginia. Orry, despite having been against secession, becomes a general and military aide to Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] in the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. Meanwhile, George and Billy are in [[Washington, D.C.]], where they are officers in the U.S. Army. Billy joins the U.S. Sharpshooters regiment, while George becomes a military aide to U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Charles, a Confederate cavalry officer, meets Augusta Barclay, a Virginia belle who smuggles medicine for the southern soldiers. Virgilia wants to work as a nurse at a Washington, D.C. military hospital and asks Congressman Sam Greene, a fellow abolitionist, for help. Orry's cruel and manipulative sister Ashton meets her match in Elkanah Bent, who sees the Civil War as a great way to get rich by smuggling forbidden luxury goods through the U.S. Navy blockade of the South. Bent and Ashton quickly become lovers, while Ashton's politician husband, James Huntoon, is unaware of his wife's adultery. With Orry and Charles gone to war, Justin kidnaps Madeline from the Main family plantation and burns the cotton barn; Orry's mother is injured trying to stop the fire. The [[First Battle of Bull Run]] takes place with George and Constance getting caught up in the panicked aftermath as they reluctantly watch from a distance. The South is the winner.\n\n* '''Episode 2''' (July 1861 \u2013 summer 1862) \u2013 Hearing about her mother's injury, Brett and one of the Main household servants, Semiramis, make the dangerous trip from Washington, D.C. to the Main plantation in South Carolina. Along the way, Semiramis is captured by Union soldiers, but rescued by Brett. Orry leaves Richmond and returns to South Carolina as well; he finds Madeline at Justin's plantation and kills Justin in a fight. Orry and Madeline finally get married. Orry discovers Bent's illegal smuggling enterprise and stops it by capturing Bent's blockade runners, arresting his men, and destroying most of his merchandise. Bent and Ashton vow revenge. Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, George's older brother Stanley takes over the family's steel factories. His greedy wife Isabel talks him into profiteering from the war by using cheap, low-grade iron to make cannons for the U.S. Army; the cannons often explode and kill Northern soldiers. They forge George's name on the documents, in case the cannons are traced back to Hazard Iron.\n\n* '''Episode 3''' (September 17, 1862 \u2013 spring 1864) \u2013 At the bloody battle of [[Antietam]], Charles and Billy nearly kill each other, but each allows the other to escape. Charles's friend Ambrose is killed in the battle by one of the poor-quality cannons made by Hazard Iron. Afterwards, President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Emancipation Proclamation]] frees the slaves in the rebel Southern states. Most of the slaves leave the Main plantation in South Carolina, but a few remain. Ashton visits her family's plantation, supposedly to see her recovering mother and sister Brett, but in reality to carry out Bent's revenge against Orry. Ashton tells Madeline that she knows that Madeline's mother was a high-priced, [[Quadroon|part-black]] prostitute in New Orleans, and that, unless Madeline leaves Orry with no explanation, she will reveal this secret and ruin Orry's public reputation. Madeline flees to Charleston where she is befriended by a suave gambler Rafe Baudeen and begins working for the city's poor and orphans who are suffering from the war. Following the Union victory at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], Billy, sick of not having seen his wife Brett for nearly two years, goes [[AWOL]] from the U.S. Army and makes his way to South Carolina, where he and Brett spend some time together. Ashton discovers Billy's presence and goes to tell the local authorities, but Billy is saved when Brett threatens her sister with a pitchfork long enough for Billy to escape.\n\n* '''Episode 4''' (May 1864 \u2013 late autumn 1864) \u2013 When Billy returns to his regiment, his commanding officer threatens to court-martial and execute him if he ever leaves again. Billy is also placed in harm's way by being put in charge of the regiment's skirmishers. George is captured in a raid by Southern forces and taken to the dreaded [[Libby Prison]] in Richmond, where he is tortured by Captain Turner, the prison's psychotic commandant. Orry is shot and taken to the hospital where Virgilia works; despite her hatred of Southerners, she helps him recover and looks the other way, allowing him to escape. Later, Virgilia is accused of allowing a wounded Southern soldier to die and is fired from the hospital. In a fit of rage, Virgilia pushes the elderly chief nurse Mrs. Neal, causing her to lose her balance and tumble to the floor. Believing Mrs. Neal to be dead, Virgilia panics and flees the hospital. Desperate for money and a hiding place, she goes to Congressman Greene for help. He gives her money and protection in exchange for sex. Charles saves Augusta from being raped by Northern soldiers at her farm in Virginia, and the two become lovers.\n\n* '''Episode 5''' (December 1864 \u2013 February 1865) \u2013 The war has turned against the South. Orry and Charles save George from Libby Prison, kill Turner in a fight, and allow George to return to the North. Madeline helps starving people in Charleston. Returning home, George learns of his brother and sister-in-law's illegal business schemes to use cheap iron to build cannon, and forces Stanley and Isabel to admit guilt. Bent tries to kill Madeline in Charleston, but she is rescued by her gambler friend Rafe, who saves Madeline but is fatally shot by Bent. Bent enlists James Huntoon for help in his plot to overthrow the Confederate government. Although he is still oblivious to Bent's and Ashton's affair, Huntoon acts as a double agent gathering intelligence on the planned [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and reporting the activities to [[Jefferson Davis]]. The Confederate President orders Orry to squash the planned revolution. In a final fight, Orry and Huntoon attack Bent's hideout near Richmond. Bent is (apparently) killed when the ammunition he was hiding in a barn explodes. Ashton confesses her affair to James, conspiring to have Billy killed, her past abortion, and tells Orry that she helped Bent drive Madeline away. Orry once more disowns Ashton in fury for her secrets and actions against both the Main and Hazard families, and tells Huntoon that he never wants to see his sister again. Ashton begs Huntoon's forgiveness, but he tells her that it is too late, hinting that he, also in anger for her betrayal of their marriage, never wants to see her again as well.\n\n* '''Episode 6''' (March 1865 \u2013 April 1865) \u2013 The fighting ends with a Northern victory. Orry and George lead troops against each other in the last major battle at [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg]]; Orry is wounded. Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]] surrenders the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] to U.S. Army General [[Ulysses Grant]], negotiating the terms of surrender at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]]. With the war over, Charles goes to Augusta's farm and finds that she has died giving birth to his child, a son. He goes to Charleston and gets his child from Augusta's uncle's wife. Billy also quits the army and reunites with Brett at her family's plantation. Congressman Greene ends his affair with Virgilia, which he thinks detrimental to his political career. Virgilia learns that Greene had been lying to her about the seriousness of the charges and using Virgilia's dependence for his own gratification; she murders the congressman and is sentenced to death by hanging. She and George have a tearful farewell before her execution. George learns that Orry is wounded and searches for him, finally finding him in a Union hospital. Their reunion is spoiled when both learn that President Lincoln [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|has been shot]]. George helps Orry find Madeline, who reveals that Orry is now the father of their son. Orry, Madeline, their baby, and George all set out for the Main plantation. Salem Jones, the cruel former overseer of the Main plantation, joins with one of the Main's former slaves, Cuffey, in an attack on the Main plantation; they burn the mansion before being killed or driven off by Charles, Billy, and Ezra, a former slave who is engaged to marry Semiramis. Orry, George, and Madeline arrive, with the former two helping to fend off the last of the attackers. \u039frry's mother is killed in the attack by Cuffey while trying to prevent Semiramis' rape, but Cuffey is shot dead by Charles, while Salem Jones is shot dead by Brett when he is about to shoot Billy. Orry and George pledge to renew their family's friendship, and George agrees to help Orry rebuild his plantation home by reopening the cotton mill and letting Orry take the profits. The two families depart the burned out and collapsed remains of Mont Royal to prepare for the future.\n\n===Book III: ''Heaven and Hell''===\n* '''Episode 1''' (summer 1865 \u2013 autumn 1865) \u2013 Elkanah Bent, having survived the explosion of his hidden ammunition depot near Richmond, becomes obsessed with getting his \"final revenge\" on Orry and George, whom he blames for his failures in life. He begins his revenge by going to Richmond and murdering Orry Main with a single stab wound, which Ashton discovers shortly after visiting Madeline, horrified that Bent killed her own brother. When Bent goes as far as telling her he has no intention of renewing their former partnership and had only been using her for his own personal goals, furious, Ashton tries unsuccessfully to kill Bent and avenge Orry, despite the bad blood between the two siblings; she then moves to the West to start a new life. Heartbroken at Orry's death, Madeline tries to rebuild the Main family mansion at Mont Royal and helps local freed slaves, to the disapproval of most of her white neighbors. After learning of Orry's death, George goes to Mont Royal and helps Madeline. Charles Main, now a corporal in the U.S. Cavalry in the Old West, meets and romances Willa Parker. Ashton begins working as a [[prostitute]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]; her goal is to earn enough money to buy Mont Royal. Carrying out the next part of his plan of revenge, Bent goes to the Hazard mansion near Philadelphia and murders George's wife Constance.\n\n* '''Episode 2''' (autumn 1865 \u2013 spring 1866) \u2013 Devastated by news of his wife's murder, George begins searching for Bent to exact justice. Cooper Main, Orry's older brother, becomes a member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and begins working to undermine his sister-in-law Madeline's efforts to help local blacks. Isabel, George's greedy sister-in-law, wants to buy Mont Royal and evict the Main family. Charles continues to work as a cavalryman in the Old West, and continues to romance Willa. Realizing that she cannot stand against Cooper and Isabel alone, Madeline asks George for help. Charles helps to form a unit of [[buffalo soldier]]s. Cavalrymen massacre a [[Cheyenne]] village.\n\n* '''Episode 3''' (spring 1866 \u2013 spring/summer 1866) \u2013 George arrives at Mont Royal to help Madeline, and they fall in love. Carrying out the final part of his revenge, Bent kidnaps Charles and Augusta's son Gus. When George learns of this, he goes West and finds Charles. Together the two men rescue Gus, hunt down Bent, and hang him. The hanging ends the personal war between Bent and the Main and Hazard families, avenging the deaths of Orry and Constance. When Ashton finally gets home, she weeps when she sees that Mont Royal has been destroyed. George and Charles return to Mont Royal to help Madeline and the freed slaves defeat the Ku Klux Klan. Cooper takes Madeline during the fight, and George rides after to save her. When Cooper is told by Gettys to kill both Madeline and George, he refuses. Gettys LaMotte shoots Cooper, and George kills Gettys. Charles says his goodbyes before returning to Willa and Gus, while George and Madeline plan for their future together.\n\n==Awards and nominations==\nThe ''North and South'' miniseries were nominated and/or awarded with many different awards around the world, among which the most significant are :\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It has the chemical formula MgC{{sub|2}}O{{sub|4}}.  Magnesium oxalate is a white solid that comes in two forms: an [[anhydrous]] form and a [[dihydrate]] form where two water molecules are complexed with the structure.  Both forms are practically insoluble in water and are insoluble in organic solutions.\n\n== Natural occurrence ==\nSome oxalates can be found in nature and the most known naturally occurring oxalates are whewellite and weddellite, which are calcium oxalates.  Magnesium oxalate has been found naturally near Mill of Johnston which is located close to Insch in northeast Scotland.  The naturally occurring magnesium oxalate is called glushinskite.  The magnesium oxalate was found  at the lichen and rock interface on serpentinite.  It was found in a creamy white layer which was mixed in with the lichen fungus.  A scanning electron micrograph of samples taken showed that the crystals had a pyramidal structure with both curved and striated faces.  The size of these crystals ranged from  2 to 5 \u03bcm.<ref name=\"Source4\">{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=M |author2=D. Jones |author3=D.J.

Magnesium oxide is important because it is used as a catalyst, refractory materials, adsorbents, superconductors, and ferroelectric materials.  Nano sized particles of magnesium oxide are optimal for some of these uses because of the larger surface area to volume ratio as compared with larger particles.  Most common syntheses of magnesium oxide produce fairly large particles, however, the sol-gel synthesis using magnesium oxalate produces highly stable nano sized particles of magnesium oxide.  The sol-gel synthesis involves combining a magnesium salt, or in this case magnesium oxalate, with a gelating agent.  This process effectively produces nano sized particles of magnesium oxide.<ref name=\"Source6\">{{cite journal|last=Mastuli|first=Mohd|author2=Roshidah Rusdi |author3=Annie Mahat |author4=Norazira Saat |author5=Norlida Kamarulzaman  |title=Sol-Gel Synthesis of Highly Stable Nano Sized MgO from Magnesium Oxalate Dihydrate|journal=Advanced Materials Research|year=2012|volume=545|pages=137\u2013142 |doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.545.137}}</ref>\n\n== Health and safety ==\nMagnesium oxalate is a skin and eye irritant.  If inhaled, it will irritate the lungs and [[mucous membrane]]s.  Magnesium oxalate has no known chronic effects nor any carcinogenic effects.  If magnesium oxalate does come in contact with skin or eyes, flush with water for at least 15 minutes and call a physician if irritation occurs.  If inhaled, go to fresh air and call  a physician.  If swallowed, call a physician immediately.  If a spill occurs wash with water and make sure that no dust is released into the air.  Dispose of the wash water accordingly.  Whenever working with magnesium oxalate, safety goggles, boots, and a lab apron should be worn.  If there is dust in the air, a respirator should be worn also.  Magnesium oxalate is non-flammable and stable, but in fire conditions it will give off toxic fumes.  According to OSHA, magnesium oxalate is considered to be hazardous.<ref name=\"Source7\">{{cite web|url=http://ull.chemistry.uakron.edu/erd/Chemicals/28000/26173.html|title=Magnesium

is an [[inorganic compound]] comprising a [[magnesium]] [[cation]] with a 2+ charge bonded to an [[oxalate]] [[anion]].  It has the chemical formula MgC{{sub|2}}O{{sub|4}}.  Magnesium oxalate is a white solid that comes in two forms: an [[anhydrous]] form and a [[dihydrate]] form where two water molecules are complexed with the structure.  Both forms are practically insoluble in water and are insoluble in organic solutions.\n\n== Natural occurrence ==\nSome oxalates can be found in nature and the most known naturally occurring oxalates are whewellite and weddellite, which are calcium oxalates.  Magnesium oxalate has been found naturally near Mill of Johnston which is located close to Insch in northeast Scotland.  The naturally occurring magnesium oxalate is called glushinskite.  The magnesium oxalate was found  at the lichen and rock interface on serpentinite.  It was found in a creamy white layer which was mixed in with the lichen fungus.  A scanning electron micrograph of samples taken showed that the crystals had a pyramidal structure with both curved and striated faces.  The size of these crystals ranged from  2 to 5 \u03bcm.<ref name=\"Source4\">{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=M |author2=D. Jones |author3=D.J.

Magnesium oxide is important because it is used as a catalyst, refractory materials, adsorbents, superconductors, and ferroelectric materials.  Nano sized particles of magnesium oxide are optimal for some of these uses because of the larger surface area to volume ratio as compared with larger particles.  Most common syntheses of magnesium oxide produce fairly large particles, however, the sol-gel synthesis using magnesium oxalate produces highly stable nano sized particles of magnesium oxide.  The sol-gel synthesis involves combining a magnesium salt, or in this case magnesium oxalate, with a gelating agent.  This process effectively produces nano sized particles of magnesium oxide.<ref name=\"Source6\">{{cite journal|last=Mastuli|first=Mohd|author2=Roshidah Rusdi |author3=Annie Mahat |author4=Norazira Saat |author5=Norlida Kamarulzaman  |title=Sol-Gel Synthesis of Highly Stable Nano Sized MgO from Magnesium Oxalate Dihydrate|journal=Advanced Materials Research|year=2012|volume=545|pages=137\u2013142 |doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.545.137}}</ref>\n\n== Health and safety ==\nMagnesium oxalate is a skin and eye irritant.  If inhaled, it will irritate the lungs and [[mucous membrane]]s.  Magnesium oxalate has no known chronic effects nor any carcinogenic effects.  If magnesium oxalate does come in contact with skin or eyes, flush with water for at least 15 minutes and call a physician if irritation occurs.  If inhaled, go to fresh air and call  a physician.  If swallowed, call a physician immediately.  If a spill occurs wash with water and make sure that no dust is released into the air.  Dispose of the wash water accordingly.  Whenever working with magnesium oxalate, safety goggles, boots, and a lab apron should be worn.  If there is dust in the air, a respirator should be worn also.  Magnesium oxalate is non-flammable and stable, but in fire conditions it will give off toxic fumes.  According to OSHA, magnesium oxalate is considered to be hazardous.<ref name=\"Source7\">{{cite web|url=http://ull.chemistry.uakron.edu/erd/Chemicals/28000/26173.html|title=Magnesium Oxalate|accessdate=16 November 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140220114258/http://ull.chemistry.uakron.edu/erd/Chemicals/28000/26173.html|archive-date=20 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Source8\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hummelcroton.com/msds/msdsp/mgox_p.html|title= Material Safety Data Sheet Magnesium Oxalate|accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Oxalic acid]]\n\n{{Magnesium compounds}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Magnesium oxalate}}\n[[Category:Oxalates]]\n[[Category:Magnesium compounds]]\n", "name_user": "MorgandProsser", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed paragraph error.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_oxalate"}
