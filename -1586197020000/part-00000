He never claimed the title, however, and committed suicide in his twenty-third year. He lived in complete seclusion, refusing the visits even of the members of his own family. He was a young man of fine attainments, a profound scholar, and a musician of rare ability. His figure was remarkable for its grace, and his face&nbsp;\u2013 that is to say, his natural face&nbsp;\u2013 was that of an [[Antinous]]. But upon the back of his head was another face, that of a beautiful girl, \"lovely as a dream, hideous as a devil.\" The female face was a mere mask, \"occupying only a small portion of the posterior part of the skull, yet exhibiting every sign of intelligence, of a malignant sort, however.\" It would be seen to smile and sneer while Mordake was weeping. The eyes would follow the movements of the spectator, and the lips \"would gibber without ceasing.\" No voice was audible, but Mordake avers that he was kept from his rest at night by the hateful whispers of his \"devil twin\", as he called it, \"which never sleeps, but talks to me forever of such things as they only speak of in Hell. No imagination can conceive the dreadful temptations it sets before me. For some unforgiven wickedness of my forefathers I am knit to this fiend&nbsp;\u2013 for a fiend it surely is.

In 1970, he was killed in a helicopter crash during a combat mission in the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n==Early life==\nWilliam Leftwich was born on April 28, 1931 in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] to William G. Leftwich, Sr. and Mattie Howard Scrape Leftwich.  His father was a graduate of Sewanee, University of the South, a World War One veteran, and a stockbroker.  Both his mother and father were from Aberdeen, Mississippi. A graduate of Central High School, he achieved the distinction of serving simultaneously as Class President, Governor of Boys State, Co-Captain of the football team, and commander of the JROTC unit. He was commissioned a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] on June 5, 1953 upon graduation from the [[United States Naval Academy]]. As Brigade Commander in his senior year at the Naval Academy, he was specially commended at graduation for exemplary officer-like qualities, which contributed \"to the development of naval spirit and loyalty within the Brigade.\"\n\n==Military career==\nUpon entering the Marine Corps, Leftwich completed [[The Basic School]] at [[Marine Corps Base Quantico]] in [[Virginia]] in January 1954, and later served as a rifle platoon commander with the [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd Marine Division]] at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune|Camp Lejeune]] in [[North Carolina]]. During 1955\u201356, he served with the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]] on [[Okinawa]]. On his return to the United States, he was stationed at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]] in [[California]], where he was promoted to [[Captain (United States)|captain]] in July 1957. He then began a three-year assignment at the Naval Academy, serving as a company officer. An athlete himself, he also voluntarily performed collateral duty as assistant [[varsity team|varsity]] [[tennis]] coach and battalion [[American football|football]] coach.\n\nIn 1960, Leftwich rejoined the 2nd Marine Division, serving as a company commander until 1962 when he was named [[aide-de-camp]] to the Commanding General. In June 1963, he was assigned as aide to the Commander of [[United States Marine Corps Training and Education Command|Marine Corps Schools]]. He was promoted to [[Major (United States)|major]] in July 1964. He later completed a course of study in the [[Vietnamese language]] prior to reporting for duty in [[Vietnam]] in January 1965 as Assistant Senior Advisor to the [[Republic of Vietnam Marine Division|Vietnamese Marine Brigade]].\n\nJoining [[Task Force Alfa]], Leftwich participated in 27 major operations against the [[Viet Cong]] in the central highlands of Vietnam, and spent more than 300 days in the field. He was wounded in the Battle of Hoai An on March 9, 1965 and awarded the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]] and [[Purple Heart]] for extraordinary heroism. According to his citation, he \"\u2026played a major part in all phases of the successful relief of the village of [[Hoai An]], which was under heavy enemy attack by two Viet Cong [[battalion]]s\u2026 By his own personal example\u2026, he led the attack\u2026 Despite injuries by enemy machine-gun bullets in the back, cheek and nose, he went to the aid of a mortally wounded comrade \u2026 and delayed his own evacuation until he could call for additional [[Airstrike|air strikes]] and brief the task force commander of the situation.\"\n\nLeftwich returned to the United States in January 1966, served as an instructor at The Basic School, then completed the [[Command and Staff College]] in June 1967 and was named to the Schools Honor List. Assigned to [[Headquarters Marine Corps]], he was promoted to [[lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in November 1967 while serving as a systems analyst with the Manpower Management Information Branch, [[Staff (military)|G-1 Division]]. He later became head of the Systems Analysis Section. In 1968, he was selected by the [[Under Secretary of the Navy]] to be his Special Assistant and Marine Corps Aide. He served in this capacity under [[Charles F. Baird]] and [[John W. Warner]].\n\nIn April 1970, Leftwich began his second tour of duty in Vietnam, serving initially as the commander of [[2nd Battalion 1st Marines]]. On September 13, he assumed duty as Commanding Officer of [[1st Reconnaissance Battalion]], [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]].\n\n==Death==\nOn November 18, 1970, during [[Operation Imperial Lake]] Leftwich was killed in a crash of an [[VMM-263#Vietnam War|HMM-263]] [[Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight|CH-46D]] helicopter during an emergency extraction of one of his reconnaissance teams. In accordance with his practice of accompanying every emergency extraction called for by his teams, he was serving as senior \"extract officer\" for such a mission on the day of his death.

In 1970, he was killed in a helicopter crash during a combat mission in the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n==Early life==\nWilliam Leftwich was born on April 28, 1931 in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] to William G. Leftwich, Sr. and Mattie Howard Scrape Leftwich.  His father was a graduate of Sewanee, University of the South, a World War One veteran, and a stockbroker.  Both his mother and father were from Aberdeen, Mississippi. A graduate of Central High School, he achieved the distinction of serving simultaneously as Class President, Governor of Boys State, Co-Captain of the football team, and commander of the JROTC unit. He was commissioned a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] on June 5, 1953 upon graduation from the [[United States Naval Academy]]. As Brigade Commander in his senior year at the Naval Academy, he was specially commended at graduation for exemplary officer-like qualities, which contributed \"to the development of naval spirit and loyalty within the Brigade.\"\n\n==Military career==\nUpon entering the Marine Corps, Leftwich completed [[The Basic School]] at [[Marine Corps Base Quantico]] in [[Virginia]] in January 1954, and later served as a rifle platoon commander with the [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd Marine Division]] at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune|Camp Lejeune]] in [[North Carolina]]. During 1955\u201356, he served with the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]] on [[Okinawa]]. On his return to the United States, he was stationed at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]] in [[California]], where he was promoted to [[Captain (United States)|captain]] in July 1957. He then began a three-year assignment at the Naval Academy, serving as a company officer. An athlete himself, he also voluntarily performed collateral duty as assistant [[varsity team|varsity]] [[tennis]] coach and battalion [[American football|football]] coach.\n\nIn 1960, Leftwich rejoined the 2nd Marine Division, serving as a company commander until 1962 when he was named [[aide-de-camp]] to the Commanding General. In June 1963, he was assigned as aide to the Commander of [[United States Marine Corps Training and Education Command|Marine Corps Schools]]. He was promoted to [[Major (United States)|major]] in July 1964. He later completed a course of study in the [[Vietnamese language]] prior to reporting for duty in [[Vietnam]] in January 1965 as Assistant Senior Advisor to the [[Republic of Vietnam Marine Division|Vietnamese Marine Brigade]].\n\nJoining [[Task Force Alfa]], Leftwich participated in 27 major operations against the [[Viet Cong]] in the central highlands of Vietnam, and spent more than 300 days in the field. He was wounded in the Battle of Hoai An on March 9, 1965 and awarded the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]] and [[Purple Heart]] for extraordinary heroism. According to his citation, he \"\u2026played a major part in all phases of the successful relief of the village of [[Hoai An]], which was under heavy enemy attack by two Viet Cong [[battalion]]s\u2026 By his own personal example\u2026, he led the attack\u2026 Despite injuries by enemy machine-gun bullets in the back, cheek and nose, he went to the aid of a mortally wounded comrade \u2026 and delayed his own evacuation until he could call for additional [[Airstrike|air strikes]] and brief the task force commander of the situation.\"\n\nLeftwich returned to the United States in January 1966, served as an instructor at The Basic School, then completed the [[Command and Staff College]] in June 1967 and was named to the Schools Honor List. Assigned to [[Headquarters Marine Corps]], he was promoted to [[lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in November 1967 while serving as a systems analyst with the Manpower Management Information Branch, [[Staff (military)|G-1 Division]]. He later became head of the Systems Analysis Section. In 1968, he was selected by the [[Under Secretary of the Navy]] to be his Special Assistant and Marine Corps Aide. He served in this capacity under [[Charles F. Baird]] and [[John W. Warner]].\n\nIn April 1970, Leftwich began his second tour of duty in Vietnam, serving initially as the commander of [[2nd Battalion 1st Marines]]. On September 13, he assumed duty as Commanding Officer of [[1st Reconnaissance Battalion]], [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]].\n\n==Death==\nOn November 18, 1970, during [[Operation Imperial Lake]] Leftwich was killed in a crash of an [[VMM-263#Vietnam War|HMM-263]] [[Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight|CH-46D]] helicopter during an emergency extraction of one of his reconnaissance teams. In accordance with his practice of accompanying every emergency extraction called for by his teams, he was serving as senior \"extract officer\" for such a mission on the day of his death. The team had incurred casualties and requested an emergency extraction from enemy-infested territory, in an area beginning to be enveloped by dense fog.

The family later moved to the [[Burnage]] area of Manchester. Gallagher was physically abused by his father as a child, although not to the extent that his older brothers Paul and [[Noel Gallagher|Noel]] were. He has said that the abuse affected him deeply and inspired him to become an artist.<ref name=\"abuseartist\">{{cite news|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/gallagher%20abuse%20made%20me%20a%20better%20artist_1051199|title=Gallagher: 'Abuse Made Me a Better Artist'|work=[[Contact Music]]|accessdate=15 December 2007|date=23 November 2007}}</ref> When he was 10, his mother took him and his brothers and moved away from her husband, whom she divorced in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stopcryingyourheartoutnews.blogspot.com.au/2006/07/liam-noels-secret-oa-sis.html |title=Liam & Noel's Secret Oa-sis |accessdate=25 March 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406194410/http://stopcryingyourheartoutnews.blogspot.com.au/2006/07/liam-noels-secret-oa-sis.html |archivedate=6 April 2016  }}</ref> Although Liam maintained sporadic contact with his father throughout his teens, he has said that their issues remain unresolved. Noel has often contended that even from a young age, Liam went out of his way to antagonise people, especially Noel, with whom he shared a bedroom. The Gallagher brothers were troubled, especially in their mid-teens; Liam often shoplifted bicycles from local shops. He attended St. Bernard's RC Primary School until age 11, then [[The Barlow Roman Catholic High School]]. Despite common reports that he was expelled at age 16 for fighting, Liam was actually suspended for three months. He then returned to school, where he completed his last term in 1990,<ref name=\"brothers\">Gallagher, Paul & Terry Christian. Brothers: From Childhood to Oasis.

He credits his change in attitude towards music to a blow to the head by a hammer he received from a student from a rival school. After this incident, he became infatuated with the idea of joining a band. Noel has said that Liam showed little interest in music until his late teens, was better looking than him, a better singer, had better clothes, and could wear a [[parka]] jacket with more style.<ref name=\"behind\"/> Gallagher became confident in his ability to sing and began listening to bands like [[the Beatles]], [[the Stone Roses]], [[the Who]], [[the Kinks]], [[the Jam]], and [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]]. In the process, he became obsessed with the Beatles' [[John Lennon]], and would later sarcastically claim to be Lennon reincarnated despite being born eight years prior to [[Death of John Lennon|Lennon's death]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Mad for it|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,11913,738195,00.html|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=16 June 2002|accessdate=15 December 2007|first=Ted|last=Kessler|location=London}}</ref> Liam would also help Noel with his job as a roadie for [[Inspiral Carpets]] and worked as a watchman for British Gas.<ref>https://www.xsmanchester.co.uk/humans-xs-manchester/special-episode-liam-gallagher/</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Oasis (1991\u20132009)===\n{{main|Oasis (band)}}\n[[File:Oasis Noel and Liam WF.jpg|thumb|right|The Gallagher brothers performing at an Oasis concert in 2005]]\nWhen school friend [[Paul McGuigan (musician)|Paul \"Guigsy\" McGuigan]] invited Gallagher to join his band The Rain as a vocalist, he agreed. Liam was the band's co-songwriter, along with guitarist [[Paul Arthurs|Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs]]. Noel has since openly mocked this writing partnership, describing them as being \"just awful\", and Liam later admitted that they were \"shit\".<ref name=\"behind\"/> The band only rehearsed once a week and did not get many gigs. It was after one of their rare shows in 1991 at the Manchester Boardwalk that Noel, having recently returned from touring internationally as a [[roadie]] with [[Inspiral Carpets]], saw them perform.\n\nIn 1993, Oasis played a four-song setlist at Glasgow's famous [[King Tut's Wah Wah Hut]], where [[Alan McGee]] of [[Creation Records]] discovered them and signed them on for a six-record deal. In late 1993 and 1994, the band recorded their debut album ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'', which released on 28 August 1994, and went on to become the fastest-selling British debut album ever. Liam was praised for his vocal contributions to the album, and his presence made Oasis a popular live act. Critics cited influences from [[the Beatles]] and [[Sex Pistols]]. Liam's attitude garnered attention from the British [[tabloid press]], which often ran stories concerning his alleged drug use and behaviour.\n\nIn 1997, ''Definitely Maybe'' was named the 14th greatest album of all time in a \"Music of the Millennium\" poll conducted by [[HMV]], [[Channel 4]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', and [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]].<ref>\"[http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/channel4.htm Channel 4/HMV best music of this millennium]\".

The family later moved to the [[Burnage]] area of Manchester. Gallagher was physically abused by his father as a child, although not to the extent that his older brothers Paul and [[Noel Gallagher|Noel]] were. He has said that the abuse affected him deeply and inspired him to become an artist.<ref name=\"abuseartist\">{{cite news|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/gallagher%20abuse%20made%20me%20a%20better%20artist_1051199|title=Gallagher: 'Abuse Made Me a Better Artist'|work=[[Contact Music]]|accessdate=15 December 2007|date=23 November 2007}}</ref> When he was 10, his mother took him and his brothers and moved away from her husband, whom she divorced in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stopcryingyourheartoutnews.blogspot.com.au/2006/07/liam-noels-secret-oa-sis.html |title=Liam & Noel's Secret Oa-sis |accessdate=25 March 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406194410/http://stopcryingyourheartoutnews.blogspot.com.au/2006/07/liam-noels-secret-oa-sis.html |archivedate=6 April 2016  }}</ref> Although Liam maintained sporadic contact with his father throughout his teens, he has said that their issues remain unresolved. Noel has often contended that even from a young age, Liam went out of his way to antagonise people, especially Noel, with whom he shared a bedroom. The Gallagher brothers were troubled, especially in their mid-teens; Liam often shoplifted bicycles from local shops. He attended St. Bernard's RC Primary School until age 11, then [[The Barlow Roman Catholic High School]]. Despite common reports that he was expelled at age 16 for fighting, Liam was actually suspended for three months. He then returned to school, where he completed his last term in 1990,<ref name=\"brothers\">Gallagher, Paul & Terry Christian. Brothers: From Childhood to Oasis. Virgin Books, 1996. pp. 17, 33. {{ISBN|1-85227-671-1}}</ref> later famously stating on [[VH1]]'s ''Behind the Music'' in 2000 that he is \"not daft\" because he gained four [[GCSEs]].<ref name=\"behind\">VH1 Behind the Music, [[VH1]], 2000</ref>\n\nLiam had no interest in music at a young age, preferring sports. He credits his change in attitude towards music to a blow to the head by a hammer he received from a student from a rival school. After this incident, he became infatuated with the idea of joining a band. Noel has said that Liam showed little interest in music until his late teens, was better looking than him, a better singer, had better clothes, and could wear a [[parka]] jacket with more style.<ref name=\"behind\"/> Gallagher became confident in his ability to sing and began listening to bands like [[the Beatles]], [[the Stone Roses]], [[the Who]], [[the Kinks]], [[the Jam]], and [[T. Rex (band)|T.Rex]]. In the process, he became obsessed with the Beatles' [[John Lennon]], and would later sarcastically claim to be Lennon reincarnated despite being born eight years prior to [[Death of John Lennon|Lennon's death]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Mad for it|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,11913,738195,00.html|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=16 June 2002|accessdate=15 December 2007|first=Ted|last=Kessler|location=London}}</ref> Liam would also help Noel with his job as a roadie for [[Inspiral Carpets]] and worked as a watchman for British Gas.<ref>https://www.xsmanchester.co.uk/humans-xs-manchester/special-episode-liam-gallagher/</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Oasis (1991\u20132009)===\n{{main|Oasis (band)}}\n[[File:Oasis Noel and Liam WF.jpg|thumb|right|The Gallagher brothers performing at an Oasis concert in 2005]]\nWhen school friend [[Paul McGuigan (musician)|Paul \"Guigsy\" McGuigan]] invited Gallagher to join his band The Rain as a vocalist, he agreed. Liam was the band's co-songwriter, along with guitarist [[Paul Arthurs|Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs]]. Noel has since openly mocked this writing partnership, describing them as being \"just awful\", and Liam later admitted that they were \"shit\".<ref name=\"behind\"/> The band only rehearsed once a week and did not get many gigs. It was after one of their rare shows in 1991 at the Manchester Boardwalk that Noel, having recently returned from touring internationally as a [[roadie]] with [[Inspiral Carpets]], saw them perform.\n\nIn 1993, Oasis played a four-song setlist at Glasgow's famous [[King Tut's Wah Wah Hut]], where [[Alan McGee]] of [[Creation Records]] discovered them and signed them on for a six-record deal. In late 1993 and 1994, the band recorded their debut album ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'', which released on 28 August 1994, and went on to become the fastest-selling British debut album ever. Liam was praised for his vocal contributions to the album, and his presence made Oasis a popular live act. Critics cited influences from [[the Beatles]] and [[Sex Pistols]]. Liam's attitude garnered attention from the British [[tabloid press]], which often ran stories concerning his alleged drug use and behaviour.\n\nIn 1997, ''Definitely Maybe'' was named the 14th greatest album of all time in a \"Music of the Millennium\" poll conducted by [[HMV]], [[Channel 4]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', and [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]].<ref>\"[http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/channel4.htm Channel 4/HMV best music of this millennium]\".

On an early US tour, Gallagher regularly made derisive remarks about Americans, as well as his brother Noel, which led to an ultimatum from the guitarist, who briefly left the band in 1994. When addressing their muted reception in the States (especially in comparison with the UK), Gallagher said: \"Americans want grungy people, stabbing themselves in the head on stage.

A confrontation after one show led to a chair being thrown and a brawl; Noel subsequently left the tour. During the 1995 recording sessions for the second Oasis album, ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'', the brothers had a fight when Liam invited everyone from a local pub back to the studio while Noel was trying to work, culminating in Noel hitting Liam with a cricket bat.<ref>''Definitely Maybe'' DVD Interview.</ref>\n\nIn August 1996, after a record-breaking, two-night stand at [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]], tension mounted between the Gallaghers when Liam backed out of Oasis's ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' set minutes before it was due to start. Noel was forced to fill in at the last minute. Liam said that he had been struck down with a \"sore throat\" and that he does not like performing acoustically, though Noel has claimed he was [[Hangover|hungover]].<ref>Noel Interview on ''MTV Unplugged \u2013 Behind The Scenes''</ref> Noel was further angered when Liam proceeded to heckle him from the balcony while the band performed. Four days later, Noel was again forced to fill in for Liam on the first show of their American tour, when Liam refused to travel to America with the rest of the band, claiming he needed time to buy a house. He was back on stage with Oasis for their next show three days later, in Detroit but tension between Noel and the rest of the band mounted and Noel left the tour, causing several media outlets to question the future of the band.\n\nWhile on tour in [[Barcelona]] in May 2000, Oasis were forced to cancel a show when drummer Alan White's arm seized up; the band spent the night drinking instead. During the night Liam made a derogatory comment about Noel's wife, Meg Mathews (apparently questioning the legitimacy of Noel's baby daughter Anais), leading to a fight.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/30/oasis-split-liam-noel-gallagher/|title=Born to feud: how years of animosity finally split Oasis boys|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=30 August 2009|accessdate=28 November 2011|location=London|first=Gareth|last=Grundy}}</ref> Following this, a press release was put out declaring that Noel had decided to quit overseas touring with Oasis.
