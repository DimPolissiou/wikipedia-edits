According to an interview with Nintendo game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the concept involved focusing on a new form of player interaction. \"The consensus was that power isn't everything for a console. Too many powerful consoles can't coexist. It's like having only ferocious [[dinosaur]]s. They might fight and hasten their own extinction.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/nov2006/tc20061116_750580.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201013947/http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/nov2006/tc20061116_750580.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 1, 2006|title=The Big Ideas Behind Nintendo's Wii|date=December 1, 2006|access-date=August 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, game [[game engine|engineers]] and [[Game designer|designers]] were brought together to develop the concept further. By 2005 the controller interface had taken form, but a public showing at that year's [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) was canceled. Miyamoto stated that the company \"had some troubleshooting to do. So we decided not to reveal the controller and instead we displayed just the console.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> Nintendo president [[Satoru Iwata]] later unveiled and demonstrated the [[Wii Remote]] at the September [[Tokyo Game Show]].<ref name=\"TGSspeech\" />\n\nSome initial features included a built-in [[DVD player]] as well as a [[Food delivery|food delivery service]] seen in early files. The DVD player was never used unless if it was hacked<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/157099/hack-how-to-play-dvd-movies-on-your-nintendo-wii.html|title=Hack: How to play DVD movies on your Nintendo Wii|date=2009-01-14|website=PCWorld|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>, but the Food Delivery Channel was a Japanese exclusive which let you order foods like pizza.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Food_Delivery_Channel|title=Food Delivery Channel|website=Nintendo|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> The DVD usage was never used because Nintendo encoded the games onto discs rather differently.\n\nThe [[Nintendo DS]] is said to have influenced the Wii's design. Designer Ken'ichiro Ashida noted, \"We had the DS on our minds as we worked on the Wii. We thought about copying the DS's touch-panel interface and even came up with a prototype.\" The idea was eventually rejected because of the notion that the two gaming systems would be identical. Miyamoto also stated, \"if the DS had flopped, we might have taken the Wii back to the drawing board.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> In June 2011 Nintendo unveiled the prototype of its successor to the Wii, to be known as the [[Wii U]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/08/arts/video-games/nintendo-unveils-its-video-game-successor-to-the-wii.html?_r=1&ref=technology |title=Nintendo Unveils Successor to the Wii |author= Seth Schiesel |date=June 7, 2011 |work=The New York Times |publisher= |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Name===\nThe console was known by the code name \"Revolution\" from May 11, 2004 when its codename was announced at Nintendo's 2004 pre-Electronics Entertainment Expo press conference in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] until April 27, 2006, immediately before [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]].

Third-party developers often skipped the Wii instead of making games for all three consoles simultaneously (\"blockbusters like the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' franchise either never arrive on Nintendo hardware or show up in neutered form\"). ''Forbes'' observed that of the most successful games of 2011 (''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]], [[Mass Effect 3]], [[Portal 2]], [[L.A. Noire]], [[Battlefield 3]], [[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]]''), although all were released for PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, only ''Modern Warfare 3'' received a Wii version which was also the least positively received port of the game. The lack of third-party games may be exacerbated in the future, as Nintendo faces the \"dilemma of having fallen out of sync with its rivals in the console cycle\"; Microsoft and Sony would design their consoles to be more powerful than the [[Wii U]]. Strong third-party titles are seen as a key sign of a gaming console's health.<ref name=\"theglobeandmail\">{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/video-games/controller-freak/whats-wrong-with-nintendo/article2219854/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=What's wrong with Nintendo? | date=October 31, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2012/04/26/nintendo-reports-461-2m-in-losses-is-selling-3ds-below-cost/ | title=Nintendo Reports $461.2M in Losses | work=Forbes | first=Paul | last=Tassi | date=April 26, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2012/05/10/sony-posts-record-losses-as-playstation-sales-drop/ | title=Cardiac Arrests At Sony, Nintendo As Consoles Show Their Age | work=Forbes | first=Paul | last=Tassi}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', in suggesting why Nintendo posted a record loss of $926&nbsp;million for the initial six months of its 2011\u20132012 fiscal year, blamed the Wii's design for being \"short-sighted\". The Wii initially enjoyed phenomenal success because it was inexpensive (due to its being less sophisticated than its competitors) and introduced a \"gaming gimmick\". However, this approach meant that the Wii's hardware soon became outdated and could not keep up long-term (in contrast to more-advanced rivals such as Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, which were expected to continue doing well in 2012\u20132013) \"as both user desires and surrounding technologies evolved\" later in the [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|generation]]. Furthermore, price cuts and the introduction of motion-sensor controllers for the Xbox 360 and PS3 nullified advantages once held by the Wii. ''The Globe'' suggested that there were other reasons for Nintendo's poor financial performance, including a strong yen and a tepid reception to the Nintendo 3DS handheld as mobile gaming became popular on smartphones and tablets, such as the [[iPad]].<ref name=\"theglobeandmail\" />\n\n==={{anchor|System Sales}}Sales=== <!-- see [[WP:MSH]] about section names -->\n<!-- This section is linked from this article's infobox -->\n<!-- Do not change these numbers without a reference -->\n<!-- VGCHARTZ.COM and NEXGENWARS.COM are ''not'' reliable sources -->\n{{Main|Wii sales}}\n[[File:Wii sold out.jpg|thumb|right|The Wii sold out at an [[HMV]] on [[Oxford Street]]]]\n{{As of|2019|09|30|df=US}}, the Wii has sold 101.63&nbsp;million consoles worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/sales/hard_soft/|title=IR Information : Sales Data - Hardware and Software Sales Units|work=Nintendo Co., Ltd.}}</ref>\n\nSince its launch, monthly sales numbers of the console were generally higher than its competitors around the globe.

Too many powerful consoles can't coexist. It's like having only ferocious [[dinosaur]]s. They might fight and hasten their own extinction.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/nov2006/tc20061116_750580.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201013947/http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/nov2006/tc20061116_750580.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 1, 2006|title=The Big Ideas Behind Nintendo's Wii|date=December 1, 2006|access-date=August 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, game [[game engine|engineers]] and [[Game designer|designers]] were brought together to develop the concept further. By 2005 the controller interface had taken form, but a public showing at that year's [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) was canceled. Miyamoto stated that the company \"had some troubleshooting to do.

Designer Ken'ichiro Ashida noted, \"We had the DS on our minds as we worked on the Wii. We thought about copying the DS's touch-panel interface and even came up with a prototype.\" The idea was eventually rejected because of the notion that the two gaming systems would be identical.

Parental controls may also restrict Internet access, which blocks the [[Internet Channel]] and system-update features. Since the console is restricted to [[GameCube]] functionality when playing GameCube Game Discs, GameCube software is unaffected by Wii parental-control settings.<ref name=CNETParent>{{cite magazine|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-9880634-1.html|title=Super-Easy Game Play - Nintendo Wii Reviewi|magazine=PC Magazine|first=Will|last=Greenwald|date=February 29, 2008|accessdate=September 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\nEuropean units primarily use the [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]] rating system,<ref name=\"par_pegi\">{{cite news|url= http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/newsArt.cfm?artid=10948|title=Revolution To Feature Parental Controls|publisher=Nintendo World Report|date=November 16, 2005 |accessdate=September 25, 2008}}</ref> while North American units use the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] rating system.<ref name=\"par_esrb\">{{cite press release|url=https://www.nintendo.com/newsarticle?articleid=z5UnNGZpQKWULzG0z8R501PA5IHoNPr2|title=Nintendo Announces Play Control System For Next Hardware|publisher= Nintendo|date=November 16, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213012428/http://www.nintendo.com/newsarticle?articleid=z5UnNGZpQKWULzG0z8R501PA5IHoNPr2|archivedate=February 13, 2007}}</ref> The Wii supports the rating systems of many countries, including [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization|CERO]] in Japan, the [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle|USK]] in Germany, the [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]] and [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]] in the United Kingdom, the [[Australian Classification Board|ACB]] in Australia and the [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (New Zealand)|OFLC]] in New Zealand.

''Forbes'' observed that of the most successful games of 2011 (''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]], [[Mass Effect 3]], [[Portal 2]], [[L.A.

The Wii initially enjoyed phenomenal success because it was inexpensive (due to its being less sophisticated than its competitors) and introduced a \"gaming gimmick\". However, this approach meant that the Wii's hardware soon became outdated and could not keep up long-term (in contrast to more-advanced rivals such as Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, which were expected to continue doing well in 2012\u20132013) \"as both user desires and surrounding technologies evolved\" later in the [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|generation]].

They caught plentiful [[salmon]] and [[shad]]. Indigenous peoples had fished at the falls and inhabited the area for thousands of years before European arrival.

The original canal was  22 feet wide and four feet deep, and had 9 [[lock (water transport)|lock]]s, each 75 feet long and 20 feet wide, which allowed shipping to go around the Great Falls in the [[Connecticut River]] by being lifted 52 feet (16 m) around the [[Canyon|gorge]]. River traffic declined after railroads were built to the [[Connecticut Valley]] in 1849, and by 1858 the canal had become used almost exclusively for water power to run the [[paper mill]]s which became established there.  In 1874 the canal was enlarged to 75 feet wide and 17 feet deep.  By 1908 it was delivering 15,000 [[horsepower]] to the mills.  When the mills replaced water power with electrical power, the canal was widened again in 1927-28 to 100 feet, and the water was used to power [[turbine]]s to generate electricity.  The canal's bottom was lined with concrete, and the sides secured with rip-rap set in concrete. A [[fish ladder]] allows [[salmon]] to continue upstream at times when the bulk of the river's flow is diverted to the canal.  The canal is now part of the Bellows Falls Downtown Historic District.<ref name=heritage>[http://www.crjc.org/heritage/V06-3.htm \"Bellows Falls Downtown Historic District\"]</ref><ref>Historic marker on site at Bridge Street, Bellows Falls</ref><ref>[http://www.danaxtell.com/bf/bfcanal.html \"Bellows Falls Canal\"]</ref>\n\nIn 1802, entrepreneurs built the first [[paper mill]] in Windham County.  Two [[railroad]]s converged in 1849 at Bellows Falls, helping it develop into a major [[mill town]].

They caught plentiful [[salmon]] and [[shad]]. Indigenous peoples had fished at the falls and inhabited the area for thousands of years before European arrival.

The original canal was  22 feet wide and four feet deep, and had 9 [[lock (water transport)|lock]]s, each 75 feet long and 20 feet wide, which allowed shipping to go around the Great Falls in the [[Connecticut River]] by being lifted 52 feet (16 m) around the [[Canyon|gorge]]. River traffic declined after railroads were built to the [[Connecticut Valley]] in 1849, and by 1858 the canal had become used almost exclusively for water power to run the [[paper mill]]s which became established there.  In 1874 the canal was enlarged to 75 feet wide and 17 feet deep.  By 1908 it was delivering 15,000 [[horsepower]] to the mills.  When the mills replaced water power with electrical power, the canal was widened again in 1927-28 to 100 feet, and the water was used to power [[turbine]]s to generate electricity.  The canal's bottom was lined with concrete, and the sides secured with rip-rap set in concrete. A [[fish ladder]] allows [[salmon]] to continue upstream at times when the bulk of the river's flow is diverted to the canal.  The canal is now part of the Bellows Falls Downtown Historic District.<ref name=heritage>[http://www.crjc.org/heritage/V06-3.htm \"Bellows Falls Downtown Historic District\"]</ref><ref>Historic marker on site at Bridge Street, Bellows Falls</ref><ref>[http://www.danaxtell.com/bf/bfcanal.html \"Bellows Falls Canal\"]</ref>\n\nIn 1802, entrepreneurs built the first [[paper mill]] in Windham County.  Two [[railroad]]s converged in 1849 at Bellows Falls, helping it develop into a major [[mill town]]. By 1859, a woolen [[textile]] mill was operating, in addition to factories that produced furniture, [[marble]], [[window sash|sashes]] and [[window shutter|blinds]], [[iron]] castings, [[carriage]]s, cabinetware, rifles, [[horse harness|harness]], shoe pegs and [[pipe organ|organ]]s.<ref>Coolidge, A.

However, the Spanish presence only began to express with [[evangelization]], began at the end of the 17th century, and its dominance began to take shape in the 18th century.\n\n=== After 16th century ===\nThe conscious discovery of Palau came a century later in 1697 when a group of Palauans were shipwrecked on the Philippine island of [[Samar Island|Samar]] to the northwest. They were interviewed by the [[Czechs|Czech]] missionary [[Pablo Clain|Paul Klein]] on 28 December 1696. Klein was able to draw the first map of Palau based on the Palauans' representation of their home islands that they made with an arrangement of 87 pebbles on the beach. Klein reported his findings to the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Superior General in a letter sent in June 1697,<ref>{{cite book|author=Serrano, Andres |title=Los siete principes de los Angeles: validos del Rey del cielo.

Another letter written by Fr. Andr\u00e9s Serrano was sent to Europe in 1705, essentially copying the information given by Klein. The letters resulted in three unsuccessful Jesuit attempts to travel to Palau from [[Spanish Philippines]] in 1700, 1708 and 1709. The islands were first visited by the Jesuit expedition led by Francisco Padilla on 30 November 1710. The expedition ended with the stranding of the two priests, Jacques Du Beron and Joseph Cortyl, on the coast of Sonsorol, because the mother ship ''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'' was driven to [[Mindanao]] by a storm. Another ship was sent from [[Guam]] in 1711 to save them only to capsize, causing the death of three more Jesuit priests. The failure of these missions gave Palau the original Spanish name ''Islas Encantadas'' (Enchanted Islands).<ref>[http://micsem.org/pubs/articles/religion/frames/cathmissionsfr.htm Francis X.

Its most populous [[island]]s are [[Angaur]], [[Babeldaob]], [[Koror]] and [[Peleliu]]. The latter three lie together within the same [[Coral reef|barrier reef]], while Angaur is an oceanic island several miles to the south. About two-thirds of the [[population]] lives on Koror.\n\nThe [[coral]] [[atoll]] of [[Kayangel]] is north of these islands, while the uninhabited [[Rock Islands (Palau)|Rock Islands]] (about 200) are west of the main island group. A remote group of six islands, known as the [[Southwest Islands (Palau)|Southwest Islands]], some {{convert|375|mi|km}} from the main islands, make up the states of Hatohobei and Sonsorol.\n\n===Climate===\n\nPalau has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] with an annual [[arithmetic mean|mean]] [[temperature]] of {{convert|28|C|abbr=on}}. [[Rainfall]] is heavy throughout the [[year]], averaging {{convert|3800|mm|abbr=on}}. The average [[humidity]] is 82% and, although rain falls more frequently between July and October, there is still much [[sunlight|sunshine]].\n\n[[Tropical cyclone|Typhoons]] are rare, as Palau lies outside the main typhoon zone. The strongest typhoon that struck Palau since reliable records was [[Typhoon Haiyan]] in [[2013 Pacific typhoon season|2013]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kitamoto|first1=Asanobu|title=Histogram of Typhoons Within 1 Degree of Koror|url=http://agora.ex.nii.ac.jp/cgi-bin/dt/view_hist.pl?lang=en&cmd=nn_pressure&basin=wnp&gid=40c8f127cdf990173254578948ac8291&lat=7.36&min=870&lon=134.48&quant=10|publisher=Digital Typhoon|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> A mandatory [[emergency evacuation]] was issued for [[Kayangel]].

As with other Pacific island nations, [[sea-level rise|rising sea level]] presents a major environmental threat. Inundation of low-lying areas threatens coastal [[vegetation]], [[agriculture]], and an already insufficient [[water supply]]. [[Wastewater treatment]] is a problem, along with the handling of [[toxic waste]] from [[fertilizer]]s and [[biocide]]s.\n\n[[Saltwater crocodile]]s are also indigenous to Palau and occur in varying numbers throughout the various [[mangrove]]s and in parts of the rock islands. Although this [[species]] is generally considered extremely dangerous, there has only been one fatal human attack in Palau within modern history, and that was in the 1960s. In Palau, the largest crocodile measured in at {{convert|4.5|m|ft|sp=us}}.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nThe nation is also vulnerable to [[earthquake]]s, [[volcano|volcanic activity]], and [[tropical cyclone|tropical storms]]. Palau already has a problem with inadequate [[water supply]] and limited [[agricultural land|agricultural areas]] to support its [[population]].\n\nOn 5 November 2005, President Tommy E. Remengesau, Jr. took the lead on a regional environmental initiative called the [[Micronesia challenge]], which would conserve 30% of near-shore coastal waters and 20% of [[forest|forest land]] by 2020. Following Palau, the initiative was joined by the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], the [[Marshall Islands]], and the [[United States|U.S.]] [[territory (geographic region)|territories]] of [[Guam]] and [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. Together, this combined region represents nearly 5% of the marine area of the [[Pacific Ocean]] and 7% of its [[coastline]].\n\n===Sanctuary===\nOn 25 September 2009, Palau announced that it would create the world's first [[shark sanctuary]].<ref name=\"Palau creates world's first shark haven\">{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=508795&publicationSubCategoryId=200|title=Palau creates world's first shark haven|date=26 September 2009|accessdate=28 September 2009|work=[[The Philippine Star]]|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130104125625/http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=508795&publicationSubCategoryId=200|archive-date=4 January 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Palau banned all commercial [[shark]] [[fishing]] within the waters of its [[exclusive economic zone|exclusive economic zone (EEZ)]].

Mr. Toribiong said, \"The fund for the payout came from the balance of Palau government's loan from [[Taiwan]].\" From a total of US$1 million, which originally was for assisting Palau's development, US$955,000 was left at the time of bankruptcy.

Germans sent Roman Catholic and Protestant, Japanese sent Shinto and Buddhist, and Spaniards sent Roman Catholic missionaries as they controlled Palau. Three quarters of the population are [[Christians]] (mainly [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and [[Protestants]]), while [[Modekngei]] (a combination of Christianity, traditional Palauan religion and fortune telling) and the ancient Palauan religion are commonly observed. Japanese rule brought [[Mahayana Buddhism]] and [[Shinto]] to Palau, which were the majority religions among Japanese settlers. However, following Japan's World War II defeat, the remaining Japanese largely converted to Christianity, while the remainder continued to observe Buddhism, but stopped practicing Shinto rites.<ref>Brigham Young University\u2014Hawaii Campus (1981), p. 36</ref> There are also approximately 400 Bengali Muslims in Palau, and recently a few [[Uyghurs]] detained in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] were allowed to settle in the island nation.\n\n==Culture==\n{{See also|Music of Palau|Palauan language}}\n\n[[File:A traditional Palauan hut, 2012.jpg|thumb|A traditional Palauan house]]\nPalauan society follows a very strict [[matrilineal]] system. Matrilineal practices are seen in nearly every aspect of Palauan traditions, especially in funeral, marriage, inheritance and the passing of traditional titles. The system probably had its origins from the Philippine archipelago, which had a similar system until the archipelago was colonized by Spain.\n\nThe cuisine includes local foods such as [[cassava]], [[taro]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[potato]], [[fish]] and [[pork]]. [[Western cuisine]] is favored among young Palauans and the locals are joined by foreign tourists. The rest of Micronesia is similar with much less tourism, leading to fewer restaurants. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Tourists eat mainly at their hotels on such islands. Some local foods include an alcoholic drink made from coconut on the tree; the drink made from the roots of the [[kava]]; and the chewing of [[betel nut]]s.\n\nThe traditional government system still influences the nation's affairs, leading the federal government to repeatedly attempt to limit its power. Many of these attempts took the form of amendments to the constitution that were supported by the corporate sector to protect what they deemed should be free economic zones. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} One such example occurred in early 2010, where the Idid clan, the ruling clan of the Southern Federation, under the leadership of Bilung, the Southern Federation's queen, raised a civil suit against the Koror State Public Lands Authority (KSPLA). The Idid clan laid claim over Malakal Island, a major economic zone and Palau's most important port, citing documents from the German Era. The verdict held that the Island belonged to the KSPLA.\n\n===Traditional government===\nThe present-day \"traditional\" government of Palau is a continuation of its ancestor, composed of practices that span thousands of years.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Traditionally, Palau was hierarchically organized. The lowest level is the village or hamlet, then the chiefdom (now politically referred to as a state) and finally alliances of chiefdoms. In ancient times, numerous federations divided power, but upon the 17th century introduction of firearms by the British, an imbalance of power occurred.\n\nPalau became divided into northern and southern federations. The Northern Federation is headed by the high chief and chiefess of the ruling clan Uudes of Melekeok state, the Reklai and Ebilreklai. They are commonly referred to as the king and queen of the Northern Federation. This northern federation comprises the states of Kayangel, Ngerchelong, Ngardmau, Ngiwal, Ngaraard, Ngatpang, Ngeremlengui, Melekok, Aimeliik, Ngchesar and Airai. The Southern Federation is likewise represented by the high chief and chiefess of the ruling Idid of Koror state.\n\nThe Southern Federation comprises the states of Koror, Peleliu and Angaur. However, fewer and fewer Palauans have knowledge of the concept of federations, and the term is slowly dying out. Federations were established as a way of safeguarding states and hamlets who shared economic, social, and political interests, but with the advent a federal government, safeguards are less meaningful. However, in international relations, the king of Palau is synonymous with the Ibedul of Koror. This is because Koror is the industrial capital of the nation, elevating his position over the Reklai of Melekeok.\n\nIt is a misconception that the king and queen of Palau, or any chief and his female counterpart for that matter, are married. Traditional leaders and their female counterparts have always been related and unmarried (marrying relatives was a traditional taboo). Usually, a chief and his female counterpart are brother and sister, or close cousins, and have their own spouses.\n\n===Sports===\n{{See also|Baseball in Palau}}\n\n[[Baseball]] is a popular sport in Palau after its introduction by the Japanese in the 1920s. The [[Palau national baseball team]] won the gold medal at the [[1990 Micronesian Games|1990]], [[1998 Micronesian Games|1998]] and [[2010 Micronesian Games]], as well as at the [[2007 Pacific Games]].\n\nPalau also has a [[Palau national football team|national football team]], organized by the [[Palau Football Association]], but is not a member of [[FIFA]]. The Association also organizes the [[Palau Soccer League]].\n\n===Education===\nPrimary education is required until the age of 16. Schools include both public and private institutions as well as some fields of study available at [[Palau Community College]]. For further undergraduate, graduate and professional programs, students travel abroad to attend tertiary institutions. Popular choices among Palauan scholars include the [[San Diego State University]], [[University of the Philippines]], [[Mindanao State University]], and the [[University of the South Pacific]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classbase.com/countries/Palau/Education-System|title=Palau Education System|website=www.classbase.com|access-date=21 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{See also|List of Oceanian cuisines}}\nPalau has its own cuisine, for instance, a dessert called ''tama''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ayearcookingtheworld.com/tag/tama/|title=Tama \u2013 A Year Cooking the World|website=ayearcookingtheworld.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-24}}</ref> Palauan cuisine includes local foods such as [[cassava]], [[taro]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[potato]], [[fish]] and [[pork]].

However, the Spanish presence only began to express with [[evangelization]], began at the end of the 17th century, and its dominance began to take shape in the 18th century.\n\n=== After 16th century ===\nThe conscious discovery of Palau came a century later in 1697 when a group of Palauans were shipwrecked on the Philippine island of [[Samar Island|Samar]] to the northwest. They were interviewed by the [[Czechs|Czech]] missionary [[Pablo Clain|Paul Klein]] on 28 December 1696. Klein was able to draw the first map of Palau based on the Palauans' representation of their home islands that they made with an arrangement of 87 pebbles on the beach. Klein reported his findings to the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Superior General in a letter sent in June 1697,<ref>{{cite book|author=Serrano, Andres |title=Los siete principes de los Angeles: validos del Rey del cielo.

Another letter written by Fr. Andr\u00e9s Serrano was sent to Europe in 1705, essentially copying the information given by Klein. The letters resulted in three unsuccessful Jesuit attempts to travel to Palau from [[Spanish Philippines]] in 1700, 1708 and 1709. The islands were first visited by the Jesuit expedition led by Francisco Padilla on 30 November 1710. The expedition ended with the stranding of the two priests, Jacques Du Beron and Joseph Cortyl, on the coast of Sonsorol, because the mother ship ''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'' was driven to [[Mindanao]] by a storm. Another ship was sent from [[Guam]] in 1711 to save them only to capsize, causing the death of three more Jesuit priests. The failure of these missions gave Palau the original Spanish name ''Islas Encantadas'' (Enchanted Islands).<ref>[http://micsem.org/pubs/articles/religion/frames/cathmissionsfr.htm Francis X.

Its most populous [[island]]s are [[Angaur]], [[Babeldaob]], [[Koror]] and [[Peleliu]]. The latter three lie together within the same [[Coral reef|barrier reef]], while Angaur is an oceanic island several miles to the south. About two-thirds of the [[population]] lives on Koror.\n\nThe [[coral]] [[atoll]] of [[Kayangel]] is north of these islands, while the uninhabited [[Rock Islands (Palau)|Rock Islands]] (about 200) are west of the main island group. A remote group of six islands, known as the [[Southwest Islands (Palau)|Southwest Islands]], some {{convert|375|mi|km}} from the main islands, make up the states of Hatohobei and Sonsorol.\n\n===Climate===\n\nPalau has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] with an annual [[arithmetic mean|mean]] [[temperature]] of {{convert|28|C|abbr=on}}. [[Rainfall]] is heavy throughout the [[year]], averaging {{convert|3800|mm|abbr=on}}. The average [[humidity]] is 82% and, although rain falls more frequently between July and October, there is still much [[sunlight|sunshine]].\n\n[[Tropical cyclone|Typhoons]] are rare, as Palau lies outside the main typhoon zone. The strongest typhoon that struck Palau since reliable records was [[Typhoon Haiyan]] in [[2013 Pacific typhoon season|2013]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kitamoto|first1=Asanobu|title=Histogram of Typhoons Within 1 Degree of Koror|url=http://agora.ex.nii.ac.jp/cgi-bin/dt/view_hist.pl?lang=en&cmd=nn_pressure&basin=wnp&gid=40c8f127cdf990173254578948ac8291&lat=7.36&min=870&lon=134.48&quant=10|publisher=Digital Typhoon|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> A mandatory [[emergency evacuation]] was issued for [[Kayangel]].

As with other Pacific island nations, [[sea-level rise|rising sea level]] presents a major environmental threat. Inundation of low-lying areas threatens coastal [[vegetation]], [[agriculture]], and an already insufficient [[water supply]]. [[Wastewater treatment]] is a problem, along with the handling of [[toxic waste]] from [[fertilizer]]s and [[biocide]]s.\n\n[[Saltwater crocodile]]s are also indigenous to Palau and occur in varying numbers throughout the various [[mangrove]]s and in parts of the rock islands. Although this [[species]] is generally considered extremely dangerous, there has only been one fatal human attack in Palau within modern history, and that was in the 1960s. In Palau, the largest crocodile measured in at {{convert|4.5|m|ft|sp=us}}.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nThe nation is also vulnerable to [[earthquake]]s, [[volcano|volcanic activity]], and [[tropical cyclone|tropical storms]]. Palau already has a problem with inadequate [[water supply]] and limited [[agricultural land|agricultural areas]] to support its [[population]].\n\nOn 5 November 2005, President Tommy E. Remengesau, Jr. took the lead on a regional environmental initiative called the [[Micronesia challenge]], which would conserve 30% of near-shore coastal waters and 20% of [[forest|forest land]] by 2020. Following Palau, the initiative was joined by the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], the [[Marshall Islands]], and the [[United States|U.S.]] [[territory (geographic region)|territories]] of [[Guam]] and [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. Together, this combined region represents nearly 5% of the marine area of the [[Pacific Ocean]] and 7% of its [[coastline]].\n\n===Sanctuary===\nOn 25 September 2009, Palau announced that it would create the world's first [[shark sanctuary]].<ref name=\"Palau creates world's first shark haven\">{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=508795&publicationSubCategoryId=200|title=Palau creates world's first shark haven|date=26 September 2009|accessdate=28 September 2009|work=[[The Philippine Star]]|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130104125625/http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=508795&publicationSubCategoryId=200|archive-date=4 January 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Palau banned all commercial [[shark]] [[fishing]] within the waters of its [[exclusive economic zone|exclusive economic zone (EEZ)]].

Mr. Toribiong said, \"The fund for the payout came from the balance of Palau government's loan from [[Taiwan]].\" From a total of US$1 million, which originally was for assisting Palau's development, US$955,000 was left at the time of bankruptcy.

Germans sent Roman Catholic and Protestant, Japanese sent Shinto and Buddhist, and Spaniards sent Roman Catholic missionaries as they controlled Palau. Three quarters of the population are [[Christians]] (mainly [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and [[Protestants]]), while [[Modekngei]] (a combination of Christianity, traditional Palauan religion and fortune telling) and the ancient Palauan religion are commonly observed. Japanese rule brought [[Mahayana Buddhism]] and [[Shinto]] to Palau, which were the majority religions among Japanese settlers. However, following Japan's World War II defeat, the remaining Japanese largely converted to Christianity, while the remainder continued to observe Buddhism, but stopped practicing Shinto rites.<ref>Brigham Young University\u2014Hawaii Campus (1981), p. 36</ref> There are also approximately 400 Bengali Muslims in Palau, and recently a few [[Uyghurs]] detained in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] were allowed to settle in the island nation.\n\n==Culture==\n{{See also|Music of Palau|Palauan language}}\n\n[[File:A traditional Palauan hut, 2012.jpg|thumb|A traditional Palauan house]]\nPalauan society follows a very strict [[matrilineal]] system. Matrilineal practices are seen in nearly every aspect of Palauan traditions, especially in funeral, marriage, inheritance and the passing of traditional titles. The system probably had its origins from the Philippine archipelago, which had a similar system until the archipelago was colonized by Spain.\n\nThe cuisine includes local foods such as [[cassava]], [[taro]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[potato]], [[fish]] and [[pork]]. [[Western cuisine]] is favored among young Palauans and the locals are joined by foreign tourists. The rest of Micronesia is similar with much less tourism, leading to fewer restaurants. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Tourists eat mainly at their hotels on such islands. Some local foods include an alcoholic drink made from coconut on the tree; the drink made from the roots of the [[kava]]; and the chewing of [[betel nut]]s.\n\nThe traditional government system still influences the nation's affairs, leading the federal government to repeatedly attempt to limit its power. Many of these attempts took the form of amendments to the constitution that were supported by the corporate sector to protect what they deemed should be free economic zones. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} One such example occurred in early 2010, where the Idid clan, the ruling clan of the Southern Federation, under the leadership of Bilung, the Southern Federation's queen, raised a civil suit against the Koror State Public Lands Authority (KSPLA). The Idid clan laid claim over Malakal Island, a major economic zone and Palau's most important port, citing documents from the German Era. The verdict held that the Island belonged to the KSPLA.\n\n===Traditional government===\nThe present-day \"traditional\" government of Palau is a continuation of its ancestor, composed of practices that span thousands of years.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Traditionally, Palau was hierarchically organized. The lowest level is the village or hamlet, then the chiefdom (now politically referred to as a state) and finally alliances of chiefdoms. In ancient times, numerous federations divided power, but upon the 17th century introduction of firearms by the British, an imbalance of power occurred.\n\nPalau became divided into northern and southern federations. The Northern Federation is headed by the high chief and chiefess of the ruling clan Uudes of Melekeok state, the Reklai and Ebilreklai. They are commonly referred to as the king and queen of the Northern Federation. This northern federation comprises the states of Kayangel, Ngerchelong, Ngardmau, Ngiwal, Ngaraard, Ngatpang, Ngeremlengui, Melekok, Aimeliik, Ngchesar and Airai. The Southern Federation is likewise represented by the high chief and chiefess of the ruling Idid of Koror state.\n\nThe Southern Federation comprises the states of Koror, Peleliu and Angaur. However, fewer and fewer Palauans have knowledge of the concept of federations, and the term is slowly dying out. Federations were established as a way of safeguarding states and hamlets who shared economic, social, and political interests, but with the advent a federal government, safeguards are less meaningful. However, in international relations, the king of Palau is synonymous with the Ibedul of Koror. This is because Koror is the industrial capital of the nation, elevating his position over the Reklai of Melekeok.\n\nIt is a misconception that the king and queen of Palau, or any chief and his female counterpart for that matter, are married. Traditional leaders and their female counterparts have always been related and unmarried (marrying relatives was a traditional taboo). Usually, a chief and his female counterpart are brother and sister, or close cousins, and have their own spouses.\n\n===Sports===\n{{See also|Baseball in Palau}}\n\n[[Baseball]] is a popular sport in Palau after its introduction by the Japanese in the 1920s. The [[Palau national baseball team]] won the gold medal at the [[1990 Micronesian Games|1990]], [[1998 Micronesian Games|1998]] and [[2010 Micronesian Games]], as well as at the [[2007 Pacific Games]].\n\nPalau also has a [[Palau national football team|national football team]], organized by the [[Palau Football Association]], but is not a member of [[FIFA]]. The Association also organizes the [[Palau Soccer League]].\n\n===Education===\nPrimary education is required until the age of 16. Schools include both public and private institutions as well as some fields of study available at [[Palau Community College]]. For further undergraduate, graduate and professional programs, students travel abroad to attend tertiary institutions. Popular choices among Palauan scholars include the [[San Diego State University]], [[University of the Philippines]], [[Mindanao State University]], and the [[University of the South Pacific]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classbase.com/countries/Palau/Education-System|title=Palau Education System|website=www.classbase.com|access-date=21 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{See also|List of Oceanian cuisines}}\nPalau has its own cuisine, for instance, a dessert called ''tama''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ayearcookingtheworld.com/tag/tama/|title=Tama \u2013 A Year Cooking the World|website=ayearcookingtheworld.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-24}}</ref> Palauan cuisine includes local foods such as [[cassava]], [[taro]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[potato]], [[fish]] and [[pork]].

That dramatic defeat was also the last appearance in his playing career for team captain [[Antonino Asta]], who seriously injured during the match and did not manage to recover; he was part of the first team squad in the season 2003-04, without however making a single appearance. Following the events, Palermo made a number of prominent signings in the summer market, such as [[Eugenio Corini]], [[Andrea Gasbarroni]] and [[Luca Toni]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2004/giugno/13/ultima_notte_Toni_ga_10_0406135443.shtml|publisher=gazzetta.it|title= The last night of Toni|language=Italian}}</ref>; in addition, Palermo-born star [[Gaetano Vasari]] agreed to join the ''rosanero'' with a salary based on the number of appearances he would have made in the season. [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed as new boss to replace [[Nedo Sonetti]]. Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots. However, following a surprising 3-1 home defeat to [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] that brought Palermo down to third place, Baldini heavily criticized club chairman [[Maurizio Zamparini]] who consequently fired him and appointed [[Francesco Guidolin]] at his place. On the last day of the January transfer market, three new notable signings were made: [[Antonio Filippini]], [[Emanuele Filippini]] and [[Fabio Grosso]]. Palermo later returned to top the table and eventually won the league, ending with the same points than Cagliari, but being crowned as Serie B champions due to head-to-head matches.\n\n==2003-04 squad==\n{{Efs start|[[Serie B 2003-04|Serie B]]|[[Coppa Italia 2003-04|Coppa Italia]]}}\n{{Efs player|no=1|nat=Italy|name=[[Gianluca Berti]]|pos=GK|42|-35|1|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=12|nat=Italy|name=[[Nicola Santoni]]|pos=GK|4|-4|4|-6}}\n{{Efs player|no=84|nat=Italy|name=[[Paolo Comi]]|pos=GK|0|0|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=4|nat=Italy|name=[[Gianluca Atzori]]|pos=DF|17|0|1|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=6|nat=Italy|name=[[Christian Terlizzi]]|pos=DF|12|0|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=13|nat=Italy|name=[[Pietro Accardi]]|pos=DF|32|0|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=18|nat=Italy|name=[[Fabio Grosso]]|pos=DF|21|1|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=21|nat=Italy|name=[[Giuseppe Biava]]|pos=DF|19|3|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=25|nat=Sierra Leone|name=[[Kewullay Conteh]]|pos=DF|32|0|2|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=29|nat=Romania|name=[[Valentin N\u0103stase]]|pos=DF|16|1|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=81|nat=Italy|name=[[Michele Ferri]]|pos=DF|36|1|3|1}}\n{{Efs player|no=5|nat=Italy|name=[[Eugenio Corini]]|pos=MF|40|12|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=7|nat=Italy|name=[[Gaetano Vasari]]|pos=MF|26|1|4|1}}\n{{Efs player|no=8|nat=Italy|name=[[Daniele Di Donato]]|pos=MF|39|3|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=10|nat=Italy|name=[[Lamberto Zauli]]|pos=MF|21|4|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=11|nat=Italy|name=[[Salvatore Masiello]]|pos=MF|18|0|4|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=17|nat=Italy|name=[[Antonino Asta]]|pos=MF|0|0|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=22|nat=Italy|name=[[Massimo Mutarelli]]|pos=MF|41|2|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=23|nat=Italy|name=[[Emanuele Filippini]]|pos=MF|20|4|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=26|nat=Italy|name=[[Antonio Filippini]]|pos=MF|21|2|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=46|nat=Italy|name=[[Andrea Gasbarroni]]|pos=MF|39|6|2|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=79|nat=Italy|name=[[Evans Soligo]]|pos=MF|9|0|4|1}}\n{{Efs player|no=82|nat=Italy|name=[[Nicola Milano]]|pos=MF|0|0|1|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=9|nat=Italy|name=[[Luca Toni]]|pos=FW|45|30|2|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=20|nat=Italy|name=[[Simone Pepe]]|pos=FW|19|1|5|2}}\n{{Efs player|no=24|nat=Nigeria|name=[[John Otuagomah Olufemi]]|pos=FW|0|0|1|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=30|nat=Brazil|name=[[Jedaias Capucho Neves|Jeda]]|pos=FW|17|3|0|0}}\n|-\n|colspan=\"10\"|''Players sold or loaned out during the January transfer market:''\n{{Efs player|no=3|nat=Italy|name=[[Francesco Modesto]]|pos=DF|1|0|5|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=18|nat=Italy|name=[[Franco Brienza]]|pos=MF|18|1|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=21|nat=Romania|name=[[Paul Codrea]]|pos=MF|8|0|4|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=23|nat=Italy|name=[[Ighli Vannucchi]]|pos=MF|8|0|3|2}}\n|}\n\n===January transfer market bids===\n;'''In'''\n{|\n{{Football squad player|no=18|nat=Italy|name=[[Fabio Grosso]]|pos=DF|other=from [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]]}}\n{{Football squad player|no=21|nat=Italy|name=[[Giuseppe Biava]]|pos=DF|other=from [[U.C.

The ''rosanero'' ended the season in first place, being crowned Serie B champions and promoted to [[Serie A]] after 31 years in the lower divisions.\n\n==Review and events==\nAmbitious Palermo failed to gain promotion to [[Serie A]] in the previous season following a 3-0 away defeat in the final match against [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]], which were promoted at Palermo's place. That dramatic defeat was also the last appearance in his playing career for team captain [[Antonino Asta]], who seriously injured during the match and did not manage to recover; he was part of the first team squad in the season 2003-04, without however making a single appearance. Following the events, Palermo made a number of prominent signings in the summer market, such as [[Eugenio Corini]], [[Andrea Gasbarroni]] and [[Luca Toni]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2004/giugno/13/ultima_notte_Toni_ga_10_0406135443.shtml|publisher=gazzetta.it|title= The last night of Toni|language=Italian}}</ref>; in addition, Palermo-born star [[Gaetano Vasari]] agreed to join the ''rosanero'' with a salary based on the number of appearances he would have made in the season. [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed as new boss to replace [[Nedo Sonetti]]. Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots. However, following a surprising 3-1 home defeat to [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] that brought Palermo down to third place, Baldini heavily criticized club chairman [[Maurizio Zamparini]] who consequently fired him and appointed [[Francesco Guidolin]] at his place. On the last day of the January transfer market, three new notable signings were made: [[Antonio Filippini]], [[Emanuele Filippini]] and [[Fabio Grosso]]. Palermo later returned to top the table and eventually won the league, ending with the same points than Cagliari, but being crowned as Serie B champions due to head-to-head matches.\n\n==2003-04 squad==\n{{Efs start|[[Serie B 2003-04|Serie B]]|[[Coppa Italia 2003-04|Coppa Italia]]}}\n{{Efs player|no=1|nat=Italy|name=[[Gianluca Berti]]|pos=GK|42|-35|1|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=12|nat=Italy|name=[[Nicola Santoni]]|pos=GK|4|-4|4|-6}}\n{{Efs player|no=84|nat=Italy|name=[[Paolo Comi]]|pos=GK|0|0|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=4|nat=Italy|name=[[Gianluca Atzori]]|pos=DF|17|0|1|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=6|nat=Italy|name=[[Christian Terlizzi]]|pos=DF|12|0|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=13|nat=Italy|name=[[Pietro Accardi]]|pos=DF|32|0|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=18|nat=Italy|name=[[Fabio Grosso]]|pos=DF|21|1|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=21|nat=Italy|name=[[Giuseppe Biava]]|pos=DF|19|3|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=25|nat=Sierra Leone|name=[[Kewullay Conteh]]|pos=DF|32|0|2|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=29|nat=Romania|name=[[Valentin N\u0103stase]]|pos=DF|16|1|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=81|nat=Italy|name=[[Michele Ferri]]|pos=DF|36|1|3|1}}\n{{Efs player|no=5|nat=Italy|name=[[Eugenio Corini]]|pos=MF|40|12|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=7|nat=Italy|name=[[Gaetano Vasari]]|pos=MF|26|1|4|1}}\n{{Efs player|no=8|nat=Italy|name=[[Daniele Di Donato]]|pos=MF|39|3|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=10|nat=Italy|name=[[Lamberto Zauli]]|pos=MF|21|4|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=11|nat=Italy|name=[[Salvatore Masiello]]|pos=MF|18|0|4|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=17|nat=Italy|name=[[Antonino Asta]]|pos=MF|0|0|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=22|nat=Italy|name=[[Massimo Mutarelli]]|pos=MF|41|2|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=23|nat=Italy|name=[[Emanuele Filippini]]|pos=MF|20|4|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=26|nat=Italy|name=[[Antonio Filippini]]|pos=MF|21|2|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=46|nat=Italy|name=[[Andrea Gasbarroni]]|pos=MF|39|6|2|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=79|nat=Italy|name=[[Evans Soligo]]|pos=MF|9|0|4|1}}\n{{Efs player|no=82|nat=Italy|name=[[Nicola Milano]]|pos=MF|0|0|1|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=9|nat=Italy|name=[[Luca Toni]]|pos=FW|45|30|2|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=20|nat=Italy|name=[[Simone Pepe]]|pos=FW|19|1|5|2}}\n{{Efs player|no=24|nat=Nigeria|name=[[John Otuagomah Olufemi]]|pos=FW|0|0|1|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=30|nat=Brazil|name=[[Jedaias Capucho Neves|Jeda]]|pos=FW|17|3|0|0}}\n|-\n|colspan=\"10\"|''Players sold or loaned out during the January transfer market:''\n{{Efs player|no=3|nat=Italy|name=[[Francesco Modesto]]|pos=DF|1|0|5|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=18|nat=Italy|name=[[Franco Brienza]]|pos=MF|18|1|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=21|nat=Romania|name=[[Paul Codrea]]|pos=MF|8|0|4|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=23|nat=Italy|name=[[Ighli Vannucchi]]|pos=MF|8|0|3|2}}\n|}\n\n===January transfer market bids===\n;'''In'''\n{|\n{{Football squad player|no=18|nat=Italy|name=[[Fabio Grosso]]|pos=DF|other=from [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]]}}\n{{Football squad player|no=21|nat=Italy|name=[[Giuseppe Biava]]|pos=DF|other=from [[U.C.
