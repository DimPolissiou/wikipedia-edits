incidents==\n* On 26 March 1991, [[Singapore Airlines Flight 117]], operated by an [[Airbus A310]], was hijacked by four Pakistani terrorists. The flight landed in Changi Airport at 22:15. The [[Special Operations Force (Singapore)|Singapore Special Operations Force]] stormed the plane, on the morning of 27 March. All four hijackers were killed, with no fatalities among the 123 passengers and crew that were held hostage for more than eight hours.\n* On 4 November 2010, [[Qantas Flight 32]], operated by an [[Airbus A380-800]], suffered an [[Turbine engine failure|uncontained engine failure]] and made an [[emergency landing]] in Changi Airport. Upon landing, one of the engines could not be shut down due to ruptured control cables and had to be doused for three hours by airport firefighters to forcefully shut it down. There were no crew or passenger injuries, and all 469 people on board survived this incident.\n* On 27 June 2016, [[Singapore Airlines Flight 368]], operated by a [[Boeing 777-300ER]], suffered an engine problem while flying from Singapore to Milan. During the diversionary landing in Singapore, the right engine and wing caught fire. The fire was quickly extinguished by airport fire services. There were no injuries among the 241 people on board.\n*On 20 April 2017, an Australian, Jason Peter Darragh, was involved in an altercation with two [[Singapore Police Force|police]] officers in the early hours in an intoxicated state. He was jailed for six and half months at a resulting court hearing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/australian-man-jailed-for-assaulting-policemen-at-changi-airport-9173332|title=Australian man jailed for assaulting policemen at Changi Airport|website=CNA|language=en|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n* On 16 May 2017, a fire broke out at the departure hall in Terminal 2.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/small-fire-at-changi-airport-t2-sparks-evacuation-flight-delays-8854078 |title='Small fire' at Changi Airport T2 sparks evacuation, flight delays |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |access-date=16 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519050018/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/small-fire-at-changi-airport-t2-sparks-evacuation-flight-delays-8854078 |archive-date=19 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> The fire caused 40 flights at Terminal 2 to be delayed and diverted to Terminal 3.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/changi-airport-fire-about-40-flights-affected-by-terminal-2-8854800?cid=fbcna |title=Changi Airport fire: About 40 flights affected by Terminal 2 closure |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |access-date=17 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519081305/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/changi-airport-fire-about-40-flights-affected-by-terminal-2-8854800?cid=FBcna |archive-date=19 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> Terminal 2 was closed from 17:30 to 22:45.\n* On 29 November 2017, a tow truck towing a Singapore Airlines [[Boeing 777-200]] caught fire, covering the aircraft in black soot.

At a distance of about {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}}, the expressway was built almost entirely on reclaimed land, thus minimising disruptions to the existing road network in Singapore's East Coast.\n\nDespite the four main passenger terminal buildings being relatively close to each other, the [[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore|CAAS]] (Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore) decided to build the [[Changi Airport Skytrain]] people-mover system to facilitate quicker and more convenient transfers between the terminals for travellers. The system was upgraded in 2007 with new technologies supplied by Mitsubishi, connecting to Terminal 3 and separating checked-in passengers from the general public on distinct tracks.\n\n===Inter-terminal transportation===\n[[File:Changi Airport Skytrain Crystal Mover.JPG|thumb|Changi Airport Skytrain]]\n\n[[File:Changi Airport MRT Station (EWL - Changi Branch) - Platform A.jpg|thumb|[[Changi Airport MRT station]] platforms]]\n{{main|Changi Airport Skytrain}}\n\nTerminals 1, 2 and 3 are connected by the free [[Changi Airport Skytrain|Skytrain]] service, which operates from 05:00 to 02:30. During non-operational hours, travellers in the transit areas may transfer within the terminals by foot via the inter-terminal travellators. For travellers in the public areas, a free shuttle bus service will connect the three terminals.<ref>\n{{cite web|title=Transfer Between Terminals|url=http://www.changiairport.com/en/transport/transfer-between-terminals.html?anchor=skytrain|website=changiairport.com|publisher=Skytrain|access-date=3 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504011029/http://www.changiairport.com/en/transport/transfer-between-terminals.html?anchor=skytrain|archive-date=4 May 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}\n</ref>\n\nA complimentary 24-hour Airport Shuttle Bus service plies between Terminal 2 and Terminal 4 in both the public and transit areas.

incidents==\n* On 26 March 1991, [[Singapore Airlines Flight 117]], operated by an [[Airbus A310]], was hijacked by four Pakistani terrorists. The flight landed in Changi Airport at 22:15. The [[Special Operations Force (Singapore)|Singapore Special Operations Force]] stormed the plane, on the morning of 27 March. All four hijackers were killed, with no fatalities among the 123 passengers and crew that were held hostage for more than eight hours.\n* On 4 November 2010, [[Qantas Flight 32]], operated by an [[Airbus A380-800]], suffered an [[Turbine engine failure|uncontained engine failure]] and made an [[emergency landing]] in Changi Airport. Upon landing, one of the engines could not be shut down due to ruptured control cables and had to be doused for three hours by airport firefighters to forcefully shut it down. There were no crew or passenger injuries, and all 469 people on board survived this incident.\n* On 27 June 2016, [[Singapore Airlines Flight 368]], operated by a [[Boeing 777-300ER]], suffered an engine problem while flying from Singapore to Milan. During the diversionary landing in Singapore, the right engine and wing caught fire. The fire was quickly extinguished by airport fire services. There were no injuries among the 241 people on board.\n*On 20 April 2017, an Australian, Jason Peter Darragh, was involved in an altercation with 2 [[Singapore Police Force|Singapore police force officers]] in the early hours in an intoxicated state. He was jailed for six and half months at a resulting court hearing. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/australian-man-jailed-for-assaulting-policemen-at-changi-airport-9173332|title=Australian man jailed for assaulting policemen at Changi Airport|website=CNA|language=en|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n* On 16 May 2017, a fire broke out at the departure hall in Terminal 2.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/small-fire-at-changi-airport-t2-sparks-evacuation-flight-delays-8854078 |title='Small fire' at Changi Airport T2 sparks evacuation, flight delays |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |access-date=16 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519050018/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/small-fire-at-changi-airport-t2-sparks-evacuation-flight-delays-8854078 |archive-date=19 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> The fire caused 40 flights at Terminal 2 to be delayed and diverted to Terminal 3.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/changi-airport-fire-about-40-flights-affected-by-terminal-2-8854800?cid=fbcna |title=Changi Airport fire: About 40 flights affected by Terminal 2 closure |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |access-date=17 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519081305/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/changi-airport-fire-about-40-flights-affected-by-terminal-2-8854800?cid=FBcna |archive-date=19 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> Terminal 2 was closed from 17:30 to 22:45.\n* On 29 November 2017, a tow truck towing a Singapore Airlines [[Boeing 777-200]] caught fire, covering the aircraft in black soot.

At a distance of about {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}}, the expressway was built almost entirely on reclaimed land, thus minimising disruptions to the existing road network in Singapore's East Coast.\n\nDespite the four main passenger terminal buildings being relatively close to each other, the [[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore|CAAS]] (Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore) decided to build the [[Changi Airport Skytrain]] people-mover system to facilitate quicker and more convenient transfers between the terminals for travellers. The system was upgraded in 2007 with new technologies supplied by Mitsubishi, connecting to Terminal 3 and separating checked-in passengers from the general public on distinct tracks.\n\n===Inter-terminal transportation===\n[[File:Changi Airport Skytrain Crystal Mover.JPG|thumb|Changi Airport Skytrain]]\n\n[[File:Changi Airport MRT Station (EWL - Changi Branch) - Platform A.jpg|thumb|[[Changi Airport MRT station]] platforms]]\n{{main|Changi Airport Skytrain}}\n\nTerminals 1, 2 and 3 are connected by the free [[Changi Airport Skytrain|Skytrain]] service, which operates from 05:00 to 02:30.

On March 26, 1976, Bracken Library was formally dedicated; Stephen K. Bailey, vice president of the [[American Council on Education]], gave the principal address at the ceremony.  Ball State University Special Collections and the [[John Steinbeck]] Collection were also dedicated on that day in a special ceremony attended by [[Elaine Steinbeck]], widow of John Steinbeck, and [[McIntosh & Otis|Elizabeth R. Otis]], Steinbeck's literary agent.\n\nOn May 14, 1977, the Friends of the Alexander M. Bracken Library was organized to generate financial support and goodwill for Ball State University Libraries.\n\nIn 1987, Bracken Library patrons first gained access to the University's automated card catalog and circulation system.\n\nIn 2001, films and videos on DVD first became available for checking to Bracken Library patrons, and in 2003, laptops, projectors, and digital cameras became available for borrowing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ball State University Libraries Timeline|url=https://cms.bsu.edu/academics/libraries/collectionsanddept/archives/collections/universityarchives/exhibits/bracken/timeline|website=Ball State University Libraries|accessdate=9 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Helen B. and Martin D.

In 1948, three years after her retirement, Miss Booth turned the first shovel full of earth to begin the construction of Booth Library.\n\nThe $2.1 million building was dedicated in 1950.  Spread across four floors, {{convert|37500|sqft|m2}} of space was available with seating for 500 people and shelf space for 150,000 volumes.  By 1965, the collection had grown to 114,000 volumes.  Construction began for an annex in 1967, which extended shelving capacity to 475,000 volumes and expanded seating areas to hold 1,300 people.  The annex opened to the public in 1968.\n\n=== The Renovation ===\nIn 1999, work began on a  $22.5 million renovation and expansion project.  Total available space was increased to {{convert|165000|sqft|m2}} and shelving capacity was expanded to 1,500,000 volumes.  The Chicago-based firm [[Holabird & Roche|Holabird & Root]] worked closely with people from the library, the University, and the Illinois Capital Development Board to ensure that the renovated building would preserve the best features of the original architecture while improving the 1968 annex and unifying the original building, annex, and new addition to the south end of the building.  The original 1948 south facade was exposed, restored, and now makes up one wall of the atrium connecting the north and south portions of the building.  The 30-month renovation project was completed in 2002.\n\n== Visiting the Library ==\nBooth Library is open to the public and residents of the state of Illinois may apply for a library card to check out materials.  Metered parking is available in the lot at the south end of the building.\n\nThe library collection consists of more than 978,209 cataloged volumes, approximately 1.2 million microtexts, as well as maps, music scores, and pamphlets selected to support the University's educational mission. The government documents collection includes United States and Illinois State publications. Booth Library is also home to the Ballenger Teachers Center housing K-12 curriculum materials, an extensive juvenile collection, and a variety of non-print materials related to teachers and teaching. Leisure reading interests are served through materials from the general book, serial, and newspaper collections, as well as the latest best sellers, films, and popular materials. The general book collection and the periodicals collection are arranged according to the Library of Congress classification scheme.\n\nBooth Library's public catalog is part of I-Share, the statewide network of 76 Illinois academic and research libraries. Additional electronic systems provide online access to a variety of periodical and subject databases. For the university community, interlibrary loan services supplement Booth Library's resources by making available materials that are owned by other libraries. I-Share and the EIU Online Catalog may be accessed from the library's website.\n\nReference Services provides professional help to students and faculty in their use of the library and its resources. The Reference department provides individualized assistance, instructional materials, orientation tours, and (by appointment) specialized research clinics. Web, phone, and fax access may be used to contact Reference staff.\n\nLibrary Technology Services provides students with non-print media materials, open computer labs, and technology training workshops. The department makes available non-print materials such as sound recordings, CDs, DVDs, and videos. Study carrels equipped for independent viewing and listening are provided in the area, as well as rooms for group studying. The open computer labs have many computers for patron use, equipped with a variety of software packages and Internet applications. Library Technology Services provides the university community with computer training and technology workshops in its E-Classroom.\n\nCirculation Services will assist you in charging out and returning materials to Booth Library or other libraries in Illinois. Library materials must be returned when due to avoid fines. All library fines and charges must be paid promptly. Failure to do so could result in the loss of borrowing privileges throughout the statewide library system, and an unclear academic record may result.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* [http://www.library.eiu.edu/pubs/commemorativeprogram.pdf Booth Library Renovation Commemorative Program.
