Most modern chronologies are based on the work of [[E. K. Chambers|E.K. Chambers]] in \"The Problem of Chronology\" (1930), published in his book ''William Shakespeare: A Study of Facts and Problems, Vol. I''.\n\n== Introduction ==\nSince the surviving evidence is fragmentary, there is not, neither can there be a definitive or precise chronology. Performance history is often of limited use, as the first recorded performance of many plays was not necessarily when that play was first performed. For example, the first recorded performance of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' was not until 1662, yet we know the play was performed in Shakespeare's lifetime.<ref name=\"Levinson 70-71\">{{cite book | editor-last=Levenson| editor-first=Jill L. | title=Romeo and Juliet | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2000 | pages=70\u201371 | isbn=978-0-19-953589-7}}</ref> Thus,  performance history reveals little about the date of composition.\n\nSimilarly, dates of first publication are often relatively useless in determining a chronology, as roughly half the plays were not published until seven years after Shakespeare's death, in the ''[[First Folio]]'' (1623), prepared by [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]], and published by [[Edward Blount]], [[William Jaggard]] and Isaac Jaggard. Performance dates and publication dates are also problematic insofar as many of the plays were performed several years before they were published. For example, ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' was performed in 1592, but not published until 1594, ''[[Othello]]'' was performed in 1604 but not published until 1622, ''[[King Lear]]'' was performed in 1606 but not published until 1608. Performance and publication dates can thus be used only to determine terminal dates of composition, with the initial dates often remaining so much more speculative.<ref>{{cite book | last=Chambers | first=E.K. | authorlink=E.

A notable scholar to do so is [[E. A. J. Honigmann]], who has attempted to push back the beginning of Shakespeare's career four or five years to the mid-1580s, with his \"early start\" theory. Honigmann argues that Shakespeare began his career with ''Titus Andronicus'' in 1586 (the conventional school of thought is that Shakespeare began writing plays upon arriving in London ''c.''1590).<ref>{{cite book | last=Honigmann | first=E.A.J. | authorlink=E.

This dramatic improvement in his writing is attributed to his absorbing the lessons of [[Senecan tragedy]] when composing ''Titus'', which he was then able to incorporate into ''Richard''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Mincoff | first=Marco | authorlink=Marco Mincoff | title=Shakespeare: The First Steps | location=Sofia | publisher=Bulgarian Academy of Sciences | year=1976 | pages=110\u2013137}}</ref> Additionally, in his 2000 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare, John Jowett argues that the play may originally have been written for [[Lord Strange's Men]], but Shakespeare added some new material after it had passed to [[Pembroke's Men]], a company which formed in mid-1592 and disbanded in September 1593. The patron of Strange's Men was [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby]], a direct descent of [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby]], a major character in the play. However Shakespeare altered much of his source material (Sir [[Thomas More]]'s ''History of King Richard III'') regarding this character, presenting him as far more heroic and honourable than does More. For example, Shakespeare has Thomas lead a battalion against Richard at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]], when it was in fact his brother [[William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)|William]] who led them. This suggests Shakespeare was writing with Ferdinando in mind, knowingly praising the ancestor of the company's patron. However, the play also takes the time to praise the ancestors of the patron of Pembroke's Men, [[Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]]. Prior to the Battle of Bosworth, a list of names of lords who have joined [[Henry VII of England|Richmond]]'s cause is read aloud, two of whom are \"Sir Walter Herbert, a renown'd soldier\" (4.5.9) and \"redoubted [[William Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]]\" (4.5.11). This passage is completely extraneous to the rest of the plot, is almost always cut in performance and has been argued to be an addition to the original composition. Pembroke is later mentioned by Richmond, who asks for him to be sent to his tent to consult on the eve of battle (5.4.5-8), a request never mentioned again. Additionally, in Q1, Richmond is flanked by \"three lords\" in 5.2, but in F1, the lords are all named, one of whom is the previously mentioned Walter Herbert. Both the request for Pembroke, which is subsequently forgotten, and the change of the anonymous lord to a specific historical individual suggest addition after initial composition. Jowett argues that coupled with the narratively vital praise of Stanley's ancestor, the less integrated references to Herbert and Pembroke create something of a hypothetical internal chronology of composition in which Shakespeare initially writes the play for Strange's Men, but, perhaps due to the closing of the theatres in June 1592, the play passes to Pembroke's Men for a regional tour, at which point he adds the lines praising the ancestors of the new company in whose hands the play has now found itself.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Jowett | editor-first=John | editor-link=John Jowett | title=The Tragedy of King Richard III | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2000 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/tragedyofkingric0000shak_p5i3/page/5 5\u20137] | isbn=978-0-19-953588-0 | url=https://archive.org/details/tragedyofkingric0000shak_p5i3/page/5 }}</ref>\n\n=== ''[[Edward III (play)|Edward III]]'' (1592\u20131593) ===\n[[File:Edward the third title page.jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|1596 quarto of ''Edward III'']]\n:'''''First official record''''': entered into the Stationers' Register by Cuthbert Burby on 1 December 1595 as \"a booke intituled Edward the Third and the blacke prince their warres w{{sup|th}} kinge Iohn of Fraunce.\"\n:'''''First published''''': published in quarto in 1596 as ''The Raigne Of King Edvvard the third'' (printed anonymously for Burby).

Giorgio Melchiori believes the connection to Pembroke's Men can help date the play. All of the Shakespearean plays performed by Pembroke's Men are pre-plague; ''Taming of the Shrew'', ''The Contention'', ''True Tragedy'', ''Titus'' and ''Richard III''. These plays all feature relatively large casts, with an emphasis on platforms, at least two doors and an upper stage. ''Edward III'', however, needs only ten adult actors and one boy (the most cast intensive scene is 5.1). Battle scenes are also muted, especially when compared to ''True Tragedy'' or ''Richard III'', and the siege scene (4.2) requires no doors or upper stage. The conclusion reached by Melchiori regarding this evidence is that the writer(s) of the play were unsure where it was going to be staged, and therefore wrote it in such a way that it could be adequately staged by a small company performing on a basic stage. This would suggest it was written during the closure of the theatres, which places the date of composition sometime between mid-1592 and late 1593.<ref>{{cite book | last=Slater | first=Eliot | title=The Problem of The Reign of King Edward III: A Statistical Approach | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1988 | pages=80\u2013101 | isbn=978-0-521-12348-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Melchiori | editor-first=Giorgio | editor-link=Giorgio Melchiori | title=King Edward III | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=1998 | pages=6\u20139 | isbn=978-0-521-59673-2}}</ref>\n\n=== ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'' (1594) ===\n:'''''First official record''''': Francis Meres' ''Palladis Tamia'' (1598), referred to as \"''Errors''.\"\n:'''''First published''''': ''First Folio'' (1623).\n:'''''First recorded performance''''': probably on [[Massacre of the Innocents|Innocents Day]], 28 December 1594, at [[Gray's Inn]] (one of the four London [[Inns of Court]]).

These four plays are argued to represent a phase of Shakespeare's career when he was experimenting with rhyming [[iambic pentameter]] as an alternative form to standard blank verse; ''Richard II'' has more rhymed verse than any other history play (19.1%), ''Romeo and Juliet'' more than any other tragedy (16.6%) and ''Love's Labour's'' and ''Midsummer Night'' more than any other comedy (43.1% and 45.5% respectively).<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Harbage | editor-first=Alfred | editor-link=Alfred Harbage | title=Love's Labour's Lost | location=London | publisher=Penguin | year=1973 | edition=Revised | series=The Pelican Shakespeare | origyear=1963 | page=31}}</ref> All four tend to be dated to the period 1594\u20131595.<ref name=\"Woudhuysen 60\">{{cite book | editor-last=Woudhuysen | editor-first=H.R. | title=Love's Labour's Lost | location=London | publisher=Thomas Nelson | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=1998 | page=60 | isbn=978-1-904271-10-9}}</ref> In support of this, [[Ants Oras]]' pause test places the play after ''Richard III'', which is usually dated 1592.

One is in Meres' ''Palladis Tamia'', the other is a fragment of [[Christopher Hunt]]'s inventory, listing sixteen \"ludes and tragedyes\" sold from 9 to 17 August 1603. The list includes four Shakespearean plays; ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', ''The Taming of a Shrew'', ''Love's Labour's Lost'', and ''Love's Labour's Won''. Up until 1953, only Meres' reference was known, until Hunt's two pages of handwriting were discovered in the backing of a copy of [[Thomas Gataker]]'s ''Certaine Sermones''. The discovery was handed over to T.W. Baldwin, who published his findings in 1957 in ''Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Won''. Baldwin argues that the title of the play suggests it was a sequel to ''Love's Labour's Lost'', which is partially supported by the unusually open-ended nature of that play (the main characters all vow to meet again in a year's time). However, whether the play ever existed has been debated, with some critics speculating that it is simply another name for one of Shakespeare's known plays, a situation similar to ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'', which was originally performed with the title ''All is True''. As Meres refers to ''The Two Gentlemen of Verona'', ''The Comedy of Errors'' and ''The Merchant of Venice'', prior to the discovery of the Hunt reference, a common suggestion was ''The Taming of the Shrew'', but as Hunt mentions this play, it could not be ''Love's Labour's Won''. ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', ''[[As You Like It]]'', ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' and ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' have also been cited as possibilities, with ''All's Well'' the most favoured. However, these plays all tend to be dated later than 1598 (although the argument is that ''Love's Labour's Won'' is an early draft). As there are no other pre-1598 Shakespearean comedies with which to equate it, it seems certain that the play did exist, that it was performed and published, but that it has since been lost.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Hibbard | editor-first=G.R. | title=Love's Labour's Lost | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1990 | pages=81\u201383 | isbn=978-0-19-953681-8}}</ref>\n:'''''Evidence''''': the play's position in the chronology is based purely on the speculation that it was a sequel to ''Love's Labour's Lost''.<ref name=\"Taylor 117\" />\n\n=== ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' (1595) ===\n[[File:Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|''[[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]]'', by [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]] (1596).

This is thought to refer to the ''San Andr\u00e9s'', a Spanish [[galleon]] that ran aground in [[C\u00e1diz]] in June 1596 after a surprise attack under the command of Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex. The ship was subsequently captured, renamed the ''St. Andrew'' and incorporated into the [[Royal Navy]]. However, she remained in the news throughout 1596. Upon arriving in England, she nearly ran aground on the [[Thames Estuary]]. In August, she served as a [[troopship]] during the [[Islands Voyage]], and upon returning to a stormy England in October, Essex refused to allow her to sail past the [[Goodwin Sands]], a location also referred to by Salarino (3.1.4-5).

''1 Henry IV'' was definitely written by early 1597. ''Henry V'' was completed by September 1599. ''2 Henry IV'' was written at some point between these two. Exactly where ''Merry Wives'' fits into the sequence is unknown, but attempts to date the composition of the play by locating the plot within the overall ''Henriad'' have proved fruitless. The plot of ''Merry Wives'' does not fit into the plot of the ''Henriad'' in any chronological or logical sense; there are continuity problems no matter where in the sequence one locates the play. For example, Falstaff and [[Mistress Quickly]] don't know one another at the start of ''Merry Wives'', whereas in ''1 Henry IV'', they have known one another for over thirty years.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Craik | editor-first=T.W. | title=The Merry Wives of Windsor | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1990 | pages=11\u201312 | isbn=978-0-19-953682-5}}</ref> John Jowett, editor of the play for the ''Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works'', argues it is not supposed to fit into the ''Henriad'' at all, it is \"essentially an [[Shakespearean comedy|Elizabethan comedy]], the only one that Shakespeare set firmly in England.

Hotson believes the play was commissioned for the Feast by George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon, who had recently succeeded his father as patron of Shakespeare's Lord Chamberlain's Men and was to be one of the newly elected knights.

There is some tentative evidence to narrow the date further, however. For example, the fact that Falstaff seems to have been called Falstaff from the very inception of ''2 Henry IV'' would suggest the play was written after the censoring of ''1 Henry IV'' in 1596/1597.<ref name=\"Richard James\" /> The fact that the 25 February 1598 Stationers' Register entry for ''1 Henry IV'' does not identity it as the first part of a two-part play has led some scholars to speculate that ''2 Henry IV'' could not have been completed by that date.<ref name=\"Taylor 120\" /> There is also a reference to the character of Justice Shallow in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Every Man out of His Humour]]'', which was first acted in 1599, indicating the play was well enough known by then for an audience to understand the allusion. All of this seems to place the date of composition as somewhere in late 1597/early 1598.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Melchiori | editor-first=Giorgio | editor-link=Giorgio Melchiori | title=The Second Part of King Henry IV | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2007 | edition=Revised | origyear=1989 | page=3 | isbn=978-0-521-68950-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Weis | editor-first=Ren\u00e9 | title=Henry IV, Part 2 | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1997 | pages=8\u201316 | isbn=978-0-19-953713-6}}</ref>\n\n=== ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' (1598\u20131599) ===\n:'''''First official record''''': mentioned in the Stationers' Register on a [[Book design#Front cover, spine, and back cover of the dust-jacket|flyleaf]] dated 4 August 1600 as \"The c\u014dmedie of muche A doo about nothinge.\" Grouped with ''Henry V'', ''As You Like It'' and Ben Jonson's ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' under the heading \"to be staied.\" Who wrote the note, the exact nature of the grouping of plays, and the meaning of \"to be staied\" is unknown, but is thought to have been an attempt by the Lord Chamberlain's Men to prevent unauthorised printing of the plays listed.<ref name=\"McEachern\">{{cite book | editor-last=McEachern | editor-first=Claire | title=Much Ado About Nothing | location=London | publisher=Thompson Learning | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=2006 | pages=125\u2013126 | isbn=978-1-903436-83-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Mares 41-42\">{{cite book | editor-last=Mares | editor-first=F.H. | title=Much Ado About Nothing | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2003 | edition=Revised | origyear=1988 | pages=41\u201342 | isbn=978-0-521-53250-1}}</ref> The play was formally entered into the Register by Andrew Wise and William Aspley on 23 August as \"Muche a Doo about nothing.\" Jointly entered with ''2 Henry IV''.<ref name=\"Humphries xi\" />\n:'''''First published''''': published in quarto in 1600 as ''Much adoe about Nothing'' (printed by Valentine Simmes for Andrew Wise and William Aspley).\n:'''''First recorded performance''''': on or around 14 February 1613, when the play was performed at court as part of the celebrations for the marriage of Princess Elzabeth to Frederick V, Elector Palatine.<ref name=\"Mares 10\">{{cite book | editor-last=Mares | editor-first=F.H. | title=Much Ado About Nothing | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2003 | edition=Revised | origyear=1988 | page=10 | isbn=978-0-521-53250-1}}</ref>\n:'''''Evidence''''': the play is not mentioned in Meres' ''Palladis Tamia'', which tentatively suggests it had not been performed by September 1598.

The first definite performance of the play took place on a ship called the ''[[Red Dragon (1595)|Red Dragon]]'', anchored off the coast of Africa, on 5 September 1607. The evidence for this comes from Thomas Rundall's ''Narratives of Voyages Towards the North-East: 1496\u20131631'' (1849). Rundall includes extracts from the journal of Captain [[William Keeling]], who was in charge of three ships sponsored by the [[East India Company]] that left England for India in March 1607, but were almost immediately separated. The ''Red Dragon'', Keeling's flagship, was beset by storms and anchored off what is now Sierra Leone for six weeks. According to Keeling, the crew performed ''Hamlet'' on the nights of 5 September and \"31 September\" (presumably 1 October), and ''Richard II'' on the night of 30 September. There has been some argument as to the authenticity of Keeling's journal entry. Prior to Rundall's book, Keeling's journal had been published in 1625, but the references to ''Hamlet'' and ''Richard II'' were not included by the editor, [[Samuel Purchas]]. In his 1898 book, ''Life of Shakespeare'', [[Sidney Lee]] claimed the entire ''Red Dragon'' episode was probably a forgery by [[John Payne Collier]], and in 1950, Sydney Race revealed that the relevant pages were missing from the original journal and argued that a ship's crew would be incapable of mastering two of Shakespeare's most difficult plays. However, [[William Foster (historiographer)|William Foster]] pointed out that the entire journal had been missing since at least 1900, not just the relevant pages, and he countered Race by arguing that the crew probably performed truncated and edited versions of each play.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last=Thompson | editor1-first=Ann | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Neil | title=Hamlet | location=London | publisher=Thompson Learning | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=2006 | pages=53\u201355 | isbn=978-1-904271-33-8}}</ref> The general feeling amongst scholars today is that the record is genuine.<ref>{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=Gary | authorlink=Gary Taylor (scholar) | chapter=The Red Dragon in Sierra Leone | editor1-last=Kamps | editor1-first=Ivo | editor2-last=Singh | editor2-first=Jyotsna | title=Travel Knowledge: European \"Discoveries\" in the Early Modern Period | location=Basingstoke | publisher=Palgrave | pages=211\u2013222 | isbn=978-0-312-22299-4}}</ref> The earliest recorded performance of the play in England took place at court over Christmas 1619.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last=Thompson | editor1-first=Ann | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Neil | title=Hamlet | location=London | publisher=Thompson Learning | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=2006 | page=97 | isbn=978-1-904271-33-8}}</ref>\n[[File:Hamlet Q1 Frontispiece 1603.jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|1603 quarto of ''Hamlet'']]\n:'''''Evidence''''': because the three versions of ''Hamlet'' which appeared in 1603, 1604/1605 and 1623 differ so much from one another, dating the play is exceptionally difficult.

For example, he cites the substitution of the name \"Montano\" for \"Reynaldo.\" Montano occurs in no other play except ''Othello'', and Honigmann believes the actor who worked on ''Hamlet'' Q1 played Reynaldo, but had played Montano in an earlier production of ''Othello'', and unconsciously mixed up the names.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Honigmann | first=E.A.J. | authorlink=E.

Often cited as immature were Helen's discussion about virginity in 1.1 and the [[Couplet|rhyming couplets]] in 2.1 and 2.2.

The publication of ''Leir'' in 1605 is often taken as evidence that Shakespeare's ''Lear'' was on stage by 1605. ''Leir'' was entered into the Stationers' Register on 14 May 1594, but had already been staged, and is usually dated to ''c.''1590. There is no evidence it was ever published prior to 1605, and its sudden appearance in print over ten years after its composition could represent evidence of an attempt to capitalise on the success of Shakespeare's newly released play.<ref name=\"Halio 1-2\">{{cite book | editor-last=Halio | editor-first=Jay L. | title=The Tragedy of King Lear | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2005 | edition=Revised | origyear=1992 | pages=1\u20132 | isbn=978-0-521-61263-0}}</ref> On the other hand, in his 1997 edition of the play for the third series of the Arden Shakespeare, [[R. A. Foakes|R.A. Foakes]] argues the 1605 publication of ''Leir'' inspired Shakespeare to write his own version of the story. There is little doubt that Shakespeare used ''Leir'' as a source, and Foakes' believes that some of the parallels are too specific to represent Shakespeare's remembrance of a performance, rather he must have been working with a printed copy. Foakes also argues that the title page of Q1 specifically recalls the title page of the 1605 ''Leir'' to \"alert\" readers to the fact that Shakespeare's version is based on the older version, but is much improved. For example, this explains the reference to Edgar and Gloucester on the title page. These characters are not in ''Leir'', and their inclusion in the title of Q1 serves as an advertisement that Shakespeare's version of the story is more complex than ''Leir''.

In 1603, Annesley's eldest daughter, Grace, tried to have him declared a lunatic so she would be placed in charge of his estate. She seems to have been supported in this by her husband (Sir John Wildgose), her sister (Christian) and her brother-in-law (William Sandys). However, Annesley's youngest daughter, Cordell, wrote to Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury for help, and successfully blocked Grace's plan. Annesley died in July 1604, and most of his estate was left to Cordell. Whether or not Shakespeare knew about the case is unknown, but if he did, it provides more evidence for a date of composition in the period 1604\u20131606.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Foakes | editor-first=R.A. | editor-link=R.

A possible ''terminus ante quem'' is 1608. In his 2004 edition for the Oxford Shakespeare, John Jowett argues the lack of act divisions in the ''Folio'' text is an important factor in determining a date. The King's Men only began to use act divisions in their scripts when they occupied the indoor Blackfriars Theatre in August 1608 as their winter playhouse. ''Timon'' is notoriously difficult to divide into acts, suggesting to Jowett that it was written at a time when act divisions were of no concern to the writer, hence it must have been written prior to August 1608.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Jowett | editor-first=John | editor-link=John Jowett | title=The Life of Timon of Athens | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2004 | page=4 | isbn=978-0-19-953744-0}}</ref> A ''terminus post quem'' may come from a possible topical allusion to the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of November 1605; \"those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire\" (Sc.7.32-33<ref>John Jowett's 2004 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare does not divide the play into acts.

Although the collaboration theory dates back to at least 1709 (Nicholas Rowe's ''The Works of Mr. William Shakespeare''), the theory of Wilkins' involvement originated in 1868, suggested by [[Nicolaus Delius]].<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Warren | editor-first=Roger | title=A Reconstructed Text of Pericles, Prince of Tyre | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2003 | page=62 | isbn=978-0-19-953683-2}}</ref> Wilkins status as co-author is generally accepted by modern scholars, and Delius' original breakdown of scenes remains the most widely agreed upon; Wilkins worked on scenes 1-9 and Shakespeare on scenes 10-22.<ref name=\"Taylor 130\" /> However, because the 1609 quarto is so badly corrupted and generally regarded as a poorly constructed memorial reconstruction,<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last=Wells | editor1-first=Stanley | editor1-link=Stanley Wells | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Gary | editor2-link=Gary Taylor (scholar) | editor3-last=Jowett | editor3-first=John | editor3-link=John Jowett | editor4-last=Montgomery | editor4-first=William | title=The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2005 | edition=2nd | origyear=1986 | page=[https://archive.org/details/completeworks0000shak_f0m2/page/1059 1059] | isbn=978-0-19-926718-7 | url=https://archive.org/details/completeworks0000shak_f0m2/page/1059 }}</ref> there is no complete agreement as to the motives or mechanism of the collaboration, with some scholars arguing for Shakespeare as sole author. For example, in their 1998 edition of the play for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Doreen Delvecchio and Anthony Hammond reject the theory of co-authorship, arguing that the problems inherent in the text arise not because of collaborative writing, but because of especially poor memorial reconstruction.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last=Delvecchio | editor1-first=Doreen | editor2-last=Hammond | editor2-first=Anthony | title=Pericles, Prince of Type | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=1998 | pages=197\u2013210 | isbn=978-0-521-29710-3}}</ref> On the other hand, in his 2002 book ''Shakespeare, Co-Author'', Brian Vickers is highly critical of Delvecchio and Hammond's analysis, arguing that co-authorship of the play is a virtual certainty.<ref>{{cite book | last=Vickers | first=Brian | authorlink=Brian Vickers | title=Shakespeare, Co-Author: A Historical Study of Five Collaborative Plays | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2002 | pages=291\u2013332 | isbn=978-0-19-926916-7}}</ref> Similarly, in 2003 book, ''Defining Shakespeare'', MacDonald P.

In fact, some scholars consider Wilkins' prose version to be a more accurate record of the original script than the 1609 quarto, and several modern editors have incorporated passages from Wilkins' prose into the play text, such as Roger Warren's 2003 edition for the Oxford Shakespeare, based on a text prepared by Gary Taylor and MacDonald P. Jackson, or the version in the 2nd edition of the ''Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works'' (2005), edited by Taylor. Stylistic analysis places the play in the period of 1607\u20131608. A rare word test of scenes 10-22 place them closest to ''The Tempest'', whereas a rare word test of scenes 1-9 place them closest to ''1 Henry IV''. If Shakespeare wrote 10-22, the proximity to ''The Tempest'' makes sense. If Wilkins wrote 1-9, Gary Taylor has suggested that due to the immense popularity of ''1 Henry IV'', Wilkins may have read it during composition in an effort to write in a Shakespearean manner. Ants Oras' pause test places scenes 10-22 closest to ''Macbeth'' and ''Antony and Cleopatra''.<ref name=\"Taylor 130\" /> Taken together, the stylistic evidence, the 1608 Stationers' Register entry, Wilkins' 1608 prose version, the 1608 performance seen by Giustinian, and the 1609 quarto, all serve to suggest a date of composition of 1607 or very early 1608.<ref>{{cite book | last=Barroll | first=J.

''Philaster'' and ''Cymbeline'' have strong verbal and tonal parallels, and both feature a broadly similar plot. Scholars are in general agreement that the plays were written around the same period, and that one influenced the other. The direction of influence, however, is not certain. If Beaumont and Fletcher were influenced by ''Cymbeline'', they must have seen it in performance. However, the theatres were closed until at least December 1609, meaning the play could not have been staged until early 1610. ''Philaster'' was read in MS by John Davies in October 1610, so if ''Philaster'' was influenced by ''Cymbeline'', it must have been written in the first half of 1610.<ref name=\"Taylor 132\">{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=Gary | authorlink=Gary Taylor (scholar) | chapter=The Canon and Chronology of Shakespeare's Plays | editor1-last=Wells | editor1-first=Stanley | editor1-link=Stanley Wells | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Gary | editor2-link=Gary Taylor (scholar) | title=William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1997 | edition=Revised | origyear=1987 | page=132 | isbn=978-0-393-31667-4}}</ref> However, this contradicts Andrew Gurr's evidence that ''Philaster'' was written in late 1609.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Gurr | editor-first=Andrew | editor-link=Andrew Gurr | title=Philaster Or, Love Lies a-Bleeding | location=Manchester | publisher=Manchester University Press | series=The Revels Plays | year=2003 | origyear=1969 | edition=Revised | page=xxvi-xxix | isbn=978-0-7190-6485-2}}</ref> On the other hand, Shakespeare would have had access to the ''Philaster'' MS, making it more likely that ''Philaster'' preceded ''Cymbeline''.

As Heywood commonly borrowed from Shakespeare's work, the likely explanation here is that ''Cymbeline'' preceded ''Golden Age''. However, the date of ''Golden Age'' is uncertain. It was published in 1611, but there is some evidence it may have been written in late 1610.

Warren argues that the play was performed at court during the [[investiture]] of James' eldest son [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry]] as [[Prince of Wales]], which ran from 31 May to 6 June. Central to the celebrations was Samuel Daniels' ''Tethys' Festival'', which foregrounded [[Milford Haven]] as the \"port of union\" where Henry's ancestor Henry Tudor had landed to face Richard III. Milford is similarly foregrounded in ''Cymbeline'', which also deals with the iconography and cultural significance of Welshness, providing a correlation between the geography of the play and the politics of the period.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Warren | editor-first=Roger | title=Cymbeline | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1998 | pages=64\u201365 | isbn=978-0-19-953650-4}}</ref> In his 2005 edition for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Martin Butler, citing much of the same evidence as Warren (although he is unconvinced by the connection with ''Golden Age''), agrees with a date of mid-1610.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Butler | editor-first=Martin | title=Cymbeline | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2012 | edition=Revised | origyear=2005 | page=5 | isbn=978-0-521-29694-6}}</ref>\n\n=== ''[[The Tempest]]'' (1610\u20131611) ===\n:'''''First official record''''': an entry in the Revels Account Book records a performance on 1 November 1611.\n:'''''First published''''': ''First Folio'' (1623).\n:'''''First recorded performance''''': in the banqueting hall at Whitehall Palace on 1 November 1611, performed by the King's Men.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Tempest | url=https://archive.org/details/tempest00will | url-access=registration | editor-last=Orgel | editor-first=Stephen | editor-link=Stephen Orgel | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1987 | page=[https://archive.org/details/tempest00will/page/62 62] | isbn=978-0-19-812917-2}}</ref>\n:'''''Evidence''''': the date of ''The Tempest'' can be securely fixed between September 1610 and October 1611. Obviously, to have been on stage on 1 November, it must have been completed before November, and it is unlikely that the Whitehall performance was the first performance (plays were rarely performed at court without previously appearing on the public stage). The ''terminus post quem'' of September 1610 can be fixed by Shakespeare's use of a real incident as source material. In May 1609 a fleet of nine ships set sail from Plymouth, heading for [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], carrying five hundred colonists. On 29 July, the flagship, the ''[[Sea Venture]]'', was driven off course by a storm and wrecked on the coast of Bermuda.

Most modern chronologies are based on the work of [[E. K. Chambers|E.K. Chambers]] in \"The Problem of Chronology\" (1930), published in his book ''William Shakespeare: A Study of Facts and Problems, Vol. I''.\n\n== Introduction ==\nSince the surviving evidence is fragmentary, there is not, neither can there be a definitive or precise chronology. Performance history is often of limited use, as the first recorded performance of many plays was not necessarily when that play was first performed. For example, the first recorded performance of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' was not until 1662, yet we know the play was performed in Shakespeare's lifetime.<ref name=\"Levinson 70-71\">{{cite book | editor-last=Levenson| editor-first=Jill L. | title=Romeo and Juliet | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2000 | pages=70\u201371 | isbn=978-0-19-953589-7}}</ref> Thus,  performance history reveals little about the date of composition.\n\nSimilarly, dates of first publication are often relatively useless in determining a chronology, as roughly half the plays were not published until seven years after Shakespeare's death, in the ''[[First Folio]]'' (1623), prepared by [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]], and published by [[Edward Blount]], [[William Jaggard]] and Isaac Jaggard. Performance dates and publication dates are also problematic insofar as many of the plays were performed several years before they were published. For example, ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' was performed in 1592, but not published until 1594, ''[[Othello]]'' was performed in 1604 but not published until 1622, ''[[King Lear]]'' was performed in 1606 but not published until 1608. Performance and publication dates can thus be used only to determine terminal dates of composition, with the initial dates often remaining so much more speculative.<ref>{{cite book | last=Chambers | first=E.K. | authorlink=E.

A notable scholar to do so is [[E. A. J. Honigmann]], who has attempted to push back the beginning of Shakespeare's career four or five years to the mid-1580s, with his \"early start\" theory. Honigmann argues that Shakespeare began his career with ''Titus Andronicus'' in 1586 (the conventional school of thought is that Shakespeare began writing plays upon arriving in London ''c.''1590).<ref>{{cite book | last=Honigmann | first=E.A.J. | authorlink=E.

This dramatic improvement in his writing is attributed to his absorbing the lessons of [[Senecan tragedy]] when composing ''Titus'', which he was then able to incorporate into ''Richard''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Mincoff | first=Marco | authorlink=Marco Mincoff | title=Shakespeare: The First Steps | location=Sofia | publisher=Bulgarian Academy of Sciences | year=1976 | pages=110\u2013137}}</ref> Additionally, in his 2000 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare, John Jowett argues that the play may originally have been written for [[Lord Strange's Men]], but Shakespeare added some new material after it had passed to [[Pembroke's Men]], a company which formed in mid-1592 and disbanded in September 1593. The patron of Strange's Men was [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby]], a direct descent of [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby]], a major character in the play. However Shakespeare altered much of his source material (Sir [[Thomas More]]'s ''History of King Richard III'') regarding this character, presenting him as far more heroic and honourable than does More. For example, Shakespeare has Thomas lead a battalion against Richard at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]], when it was in fact his brother [[William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)|William]] who led them. This suggests Shakespeare was writing with Ferdinando in mind, knowingly praising the ancestor of the company's patron. However, the play also takes the time to praise the ancestors of the patron of Pembroke's Men, [[Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]]. Prior to the Battle of Bosworth, a list of names of lords who have joined [[Henry VII of England|Richmond]]'s cause is read aloud, two of whom are \"Sir Walter Herbert, a renown'd soldier\" (4.5.9) and \"redoubted [[William Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]]\" (4.5.11). This passage is completely extraneous to the rest of the plot, is almost always cut in performance and has been argued to be an addition to the original composition. Pembroke is later mentioned by Richmond, who asks for him to be sent to his tent to consult on the eve of battle (5.4.5-8), a request never mentioned again. Additionally, in Q1, Richmond is flanked by \"three lords\" in 5.2, but in F1, the lords are all named, one of whom is the previously mentioned Walter Herbert. Both the request for Pembroke, which is subsequently forgotten, and the change of the anonymous lord to a specific historical individual suggest addition after initial composition. Jowett argues that coupled with the narratively vital praise of Stanley's ancestor, the less integrated references to Herbert and Pembroke create something of a hypothetical internal chronology of composition in which Shakespeare initially writes the play for Strange's Men, but, perhaps due to the closing of the theatres in June 1592, the play passes to Pembroke's Men for a regional tour, at which point he adds the lines praising the ancestors of the new company in whose hands the play has now found itself.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Jowett | editor-first=John | editor-link=John Jowett | title=The Tragedy of King Richard III | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2000 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/tragedyofkingric0000shak_p5i3/page/5 5\u20137] | isbn=978-0-19-953588-0 | url=https://archive.org/details/tragedyofkingric0000shak_p5i3/page/5 }}</ref>\n\n=== ''[[Edward III (play)|Edward III]]'' (1592\u20131593) ===\n[[File:Edward the third title page.jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|1596 quarto of ''Edward III'']]\n:'''''First official record''''': entered into the Stationers' Register by Cuthbert Burby on 1 December 1595 as \"a booke intituled Edward the Third and the blacke prince their warres w{{sup|th}} kinge Iohn of Fraunce.\"\n:'''''First published''''': published in quarto in 1596 as ''The Raigne Of King Edvvard the third'' (printed anonymously for Burby).

Giorgio Melchiori believes the connection to Pembroke's Men can help date the play. All of the Shakespearean plays performed by Pembroke's Men are pre-plague; ''Taming of the Shrew'', ''The Contention'', ''True Tragedy'', ''Titus'' and ''Richard III''. These plays all feature relatively large casts, with an emphasis on platforms, at least two doors and an upper stage. ''Edward III'', however, needs only ten adult actors and one boy (the most cast intensive scene is 5.1). Battle scenes are also muted, especially when compared to ''True Tragedy'' or ''Richard III'', and the siege scene (4.2) requires no doors or upper stage. The conclusion reached by Melchiori regarding this evidence is that the writer(s) of the play were unsure where it was going to be staged, and therefore wrote it in such a way that it could be adequately staged by a small company performing on a basic stage. This would suggest it was written during the closure of the theatres, which places the date of composition sometime between mid-1592 and late 1593.<ref>{{cite book | last=Slater | first=Eliot | title=The Problem of The Reign of King Edward III: A Statistical Approach | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1988 | pages=80\u2013101 | isbn=978-0-521-12348-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Melchiori | editor-first=Giorgio | editor-link=Giorgio Melchiori | title=King Edward III | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=1998 | pages=6\u20139 | isbn=978-0-521-59673-2}}</ref>\n\n=== ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'' (1594) ===\n:'''''First official record''''': Francis Meres' ''Palladis Tamia'' (1598), referred to as \"''Errors''.\"\n:'''''First published''''': ''First Folio'' (1623).\n:'''''First recorded performance''''': probably on [[Massacre of the Innocents|Innocents Day]], 28 December 1594, at [[Gray's Inn]] (one of the four London [[Inns of Court]]).

These four plays are argued to represent a phase of Shakespeare's career when he was experimenting with rhyming [[iambic pentameter]] as an alternative form to standard blank verse; ''Richard II'' has more rhymed verse than any other history play (19.1%), ''Romeo and Juliet'' more than any other tragedy (16.6%) and ''Love's Labour's'' and ''Midsummer Night'' more than any other comedy (43.1% and 45.5% respectively).<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Harbage | editor-first=Alfred | editor-link=Alfred Harbage | title=Love's Labour's Lost | location=London | publisher=Penguin | year=1973 | edition=Revised | series=The Pelican Shakespeare | origyear=1963 | page=31}}</ref> All four tend to be dated to the period 1594\u20131595.<ref name=\"Woudhuysen 60\">{{cite book | editor-last=Woudhuysen | editor-first=H.R. | title=Love's Labour's Lost | location=London | publisher=Thomas Nelson | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=1998 | page=60 | isbn=978-1-904271-10-9}}</ref> In support of this, [[Ants Oras]]' pause test places the play after ''Richard III'', which is usually dated 1592.

One is in Meres' ''Palladis Tamia'', the other is a fragment of [[Christopher Hunt]]'s inventory, listing sixteen \"ludes and tragedyes\" sold from 9 to 17 August 1603. The list includes four Shakespearean plays; ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', ''The Taming of a Shrew'', ''Love's Labour's Lost'', and ''Love's Labour's Won''. Up until 1953, only Meres' reference was known, until Hunt's two pages of handwriting were discovered in the backing of a copy of [[Thomas Gataker]]'s ''Certaine Sermones''. The discovery was handed over to T.W. Baldwin, who published his findings in 1957 in ''Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Won''. Baldwin argues that the title of the play suggests it was a sequel to ''Love's Labour's Lost'', which is partially supported by the unusually open-ended nature of that play (the main characters all vow to meet again in a year's time). However, whether the play ever existed has been debated, with some critics speculating that it is simply another name for one of Shakespeare's known plays, a situation similar to ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'', which was originally performed with the title ''All is True''. As Meres refers to ''The Two Gentlemen of Verona'', ''The Comedy of Errors'' and ''The Merchant of Venice'', prior to the discovery of the Hunt reference, a common suggestion was ''The Taming of the Shrew'', but as Hunt mentions this play, it could not be ''Love's Labour's Won''. ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', ''[[As You Like It]]'', ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' and ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' have also been cited as possibilities, with ''All's Well'' the most favoured. However, these plays all tend to be dated later than 1598 (although the argument is that ''Love's Labour's Won'' is an early draft). As there are no other pre-1598 Shakespearean comedies with which to equate it, it seems certain that the play did exist, that it was performed and published, but that it has since been lost.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Hibbard | editor-first=G.R. | title=Love's Labour's Lost | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1990 | pages=81\u201383 | isbn=978-0-19-953681-8}}</ref>\n:'''''Evidence''''': the play's position in the chronology is based purely on the speculation that it was a sequel to ''Love's Labour's Lost''.<ref name=\"Taylor 117\" />\n\n=== ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' (1595) ===\n[[File:Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|''[[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]]'', by [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]] (1596).

This is thought to refer to the ''San Andr\u00e9s'', a Spanish [[galleon]] that ran aground in [[C\u00e1diz]] in June 1596 after a surprise attack under the command of Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex. The ship was subsequently captured, renamed the ''St. Andrew'' and incorporated into the [[Royal Navy]]. However, she remained in the news throughout 1596. Upon arriving in England, she nearly ran aground on the [[Thames Estuary]]. In August, she served as a [[troopship]] during the [[Islands Voyage]], and upon returning to a stormy England in October, Essex refused to allow her to sail past the [[Goodwin Sands]], a location also referred to by Salarino (3.1.4-5).

''1 Henry IV'' was definitely written by early 1597. ''Henry V'' was completed by September 1599. ''2 Henry IV'' was written at some point between these two. Exactly where ''Merry Wives'' fits into the sequence is unknown, but attempts to date the composition of the play by locating the plot within the overall ''Henriad'' have proved fruitless. The plot of ''Merry Wives'' does not fit into the plot of the ''Henriad'' in any chronological or logical sense; there are continuity problems no matter where in the sequence one locates the play. For example, Falstaff and [[Mistress Quickly]] don't know one another at the start of ''Merry Wives'', whereas in ''1 Henry IV'', they have known one another for over thirty years.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Craik | editor-first=T.W. | title=The Merry Wives of Windsor | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1990 | pages=11\u201312 | isbn=978-0-19-953682-5}}</ref> John Jowett, editor of the play for the ''Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works'', argues it is not supposed to fit into the ''Henriad'' at all, it is \"essentially an [[Shakespearean comedy|Elizabethan comedy]], the only one that Shakespeare set firmly in England.

Hotson believes the play was commissioned for the Feast by George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon, who had recently succeeded his father as patron of Shakespeare's Lord Chamberlain's Men and was to be one of the newly elected knights.

There is some tentative evidence to narrow the date further, however. For example, the fact that Falstaff seems to have been called Falstaff from the very inception of ''2 Henry IV'' would suggest the play was written after the censoring of ''1 Henry IV'' in 1596/1597.<ref name=\"Richard James\" /> The fact that the 25 February 1598 Stationers' Register entry for ''1 Henry IV'' does not identity it as the first part of a two-part play has led some scholars to speculate that ''2 Henry IV'' could not have been completed by that date.<ref name=\"Taylor 120\" /> There is also a reference to the character of Justice Shallow in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Every Man out of His Humour]]'', which was first acted in 1599, indicating the play was well enough known by then for an audience to understand the allusion. All of this seems to place the date of composition as somewhere in late 1597/early 1598.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Melchiori | editor-first=Giorgio | editor-link=Giorgio Melchiori | title=The Second Part of King Henry IV | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2007 | edition=Revised | origyear=1989 | page=3 | isbn=978-0-521-68950-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Weis | editor-first=Ren\u00e9 | title=Henry IV, Part 2 | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1997 | pages=8\u201316 | isbn=978-0-19-953713-6}}</ref>\n\n=== ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' (1598\u20131599) ===\n:'''''First official record''''': mentioned in the Stationers' Register on a [[Book design#Front cover, spine, and back cover of the dust-jacket|flyleaf]] dated 4 August 1600 as \"The c\u014dmedie of muche A doo about nothinge.\" Grouped with ''Henry V'', ''As You Like It'' and Ben Jonson's ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' under the heading \"to be staied.\" Who wrote the note, the exact nature of the grouping of plays, and the meaning of \"to be staied\" is unknown, but is thought to have been an attempt by the Lord Chamberlain's Men to prevent unauthorised printing of the plays listed.<ref name=\"McEachern\">{{cite book | editor-last=McEachern | editor-first=Claire | title=Much Ado About Nothing | location=London | publisher=Thompson Learning | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=2006 | pages=125\u2013126 | isbn=978-1-903436-83-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Mares 41-42\">{{cite book | editor-last=Mares | editor-first=F.H. | title=Much Ado About Nothing | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2003 | edition=Revised | origyear=1988 | pages=41\u201342 | isbn=978-0-521-53250-1}}</ref> The play was formally entered into the Register by Andrew Wise and William Aspley on 23 August as \"Muche a Doo about nothing.\" Jointly entered with ''2 Henry IV''.<ref name=\"Humphries xi\" />\n:'''''First published''''': published in quarto in 1600 as ''Much adoe about Nothing'' (printed by Valentine Simmes for Andrew Wise and William Aspley).\n:'''''First recorded performance''''': on or around 14 February 1613, when the play was performed at court as part of the celebrations for the marriage of Princess Elzabeth to Frederick V, Elector Palatine.<ref name=\"Mares 10\">{{cite book | editor-last=Mares | editor-first=F.H. | title=Much Ado About Nothing | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2003 | edition=Revised | origyear=1988 | page=10 | isbn=978-0-521-53250-1}}</ref>\n:'''''Evidence''''': the play is not mentioned in Meres' ''Palladis Tamia'', which tentatively suggests it had not been performed by September 1598.

The first definite performance of the play took place on a ship called the ''[[Red Dragon (1595)|Red Dragon]]'', anchored off the coast of Africa, on 5 September 1607. The evidence for this comes from Thomas Rundall's ''Narratives of Voyages Towards the North-East: 1496\u20131631'' (1849). Rundall includes extracts from the journal of Captain [[William Keeling]], who was in charge of three ships sponsored by the [[East India Company]] that left England for India in March 1607, but were almost immediately separated. The ''Red Dragon'', Keeling's flagship, was beset by storms and anchored off what is now Sierra Leone for six weeks. According to Keeling, the crew performed ''Hamlet'' on the nights of 5 September and \"31 September\" (presumably 1 October), and ''Richard II'' on the night of 30 September. There has been some argument as to the authenticity of Keeling's journal entry. Prior to Rundall's book, Keeling's journal had been published in 1625, but the references to ''Hamlet'' and ''Richard II'' were not included by the editor, [[Samuel Purchas]]. In his 1898 book, ''Life of Shakespeare'', [[Sidney Lee]] claimed the entire ''Red Dragon'' episode was probably a forgery by [[John Payne Collier]], and in 1950, Sydney Race revealed that the relevant pages were missing from the original journal and argued that a ship's crew would be incapable of mastering two of Shakespeare's most difficult plays. However, [[William Foster (historiographer)|William Foster]] pointed out that the entire journal had been missing since at least 1900, not just the relevant pages, and he countered Race by arguing that the crew probably performed truncated and edited versions of each play.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last=Thompson | editor1-first=Ann | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Neil | title=Hamlet | location=London | publisher=Thompson Learning | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=2006 | pages=53\u201355 | isbn=978-1-904271-33-8}}</ref> The general feeling amongst scholars today is that the record is genuine.<ref>{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=Gary | authorlink=Gary Taylor (scholar) | chapter=The Red Dragon in Sierra Leone | editor1-last=Kamps | editor1-first=Ivo | editor2-last=Singh | editor2-first=Jyotsna | title=Travel Knowledge: European \"Discoveries\" in the Early Modern Period | location=Basingstoke | publisher=Palgrave | pages=211\u2013222 | isbn=978-0-312-22299-4}}</ref> The earliest recorded performance of the play in England took place at court over Christmas 1619.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last=Thompson | editor1-first=Ann | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Neil | title=Hamlet | location=London | publisher=Thompson Learning | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=2006 | page=97 | isbn=978-1-904271-33-8}}</ref>\n[[File:Hamlet Q1 Frontispiece 1603.jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|1603 quarto of ''Hamlet'']]\n:'''''Evidence''''': because the three versions of ''Hamlet'' which appeared in 1603, 1604/1605 and 1623 differ so much from one another, dating the play is exceptionally difficult.

For example, he cites the substitution of the name \"Montano\" for \"Reynaldo.\" Montano occurs in no other play except ''Othello'', and Honigmann believes the actor who worked on ''Hamlet'' Q1 played Reynaldo, but had played Montano in an earlier production of ''Othello'', and unconsciously mixed up the names.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Honigmann | first=E.A.J. | authorlink=E.

Often cited as immature were Helen's discussion about virginity in 1.1 and the [[Couplet|rhyming couplets]] in 2.1 and 2.2.

The publication of ''Leir'' in 1605 is often taken as evidence that Shakespeare's ''Lear'' was on stage by 1605. ''Leir'' was entered into the Stationers' Register on 14 May 1594, but had already been staged, and is usually dated to ''c.''1590. There is no evidence it was ever published prior to 1605, and its sudden appearance in print over ten years after its composition could represent evidence of an attempt to capitalise on the success of Shakespeare's newly released play.<ref name=\"Halio 1-2\">{{cite book | editor-last=Halio | editor-first=Jay L. | title=The Tragedy of King Lear | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2005 | edition=Revised | origyear=1992 | pages=1\u20132 | isbn=978-0-521-61263-0}}</ref> On the other hand, in his 1997 edition of the play for the third series of the Arden Shakespeare, [[R. A. Foakes|R.A. Foakes]] argues the 1605 publication of ''Leir'' inspired Shakespeare to write his own version of the story. There is little doubt that Shakespeare used ''Leir'' as a source, and Foakes' believes that some of the parallels are too specific to represent Shakespeare's remembrance of a performance, rather he must have been working with a printed copy. Foakes also argues that the title page of Q1 specifically recalls the title page of the 1605 ''Leir'' to \"alert\" readers to the fact that Shakespeare's version is based on the older version, but is much improved. For example, this explains the reference to Edgar and Gloucester on the title page. These characters are not in ''Leir'', and their inclusion in the title of Q1 serves as an advertisement that Shakespeare's version of the story is more complex than ''Leir''.

In 1603, Annesley's eldest daughter, Grace, tried to have him declared a lunatic so she would be placed in charge of his estate. She seems to have been supported in this by her husband (Sir John Wildgose), her sister (Christian) and her brother-in-law (William Sandys). However, Annesley's youngest daughter, Cordell, wrote to Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury for help, and successfully blocked Grace's plan. Annesley died in July 1604, and most of his estate was left to Cordell. Whether or not Shakespeare knew about the case is unknown, but if he did, it provides more evidence for a date of composition in the period 1604\u20131606.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Foakes | editor-first=R.A. | editor-link=R.

A possible ''terminus ante quem'' is 1608. In his 2004 edition for the Oxford Shakespeare, John Jowett argues the lack of act divisions in the ''Folio'' text is an important factor in determining a date. The King's Men only began to use act divisions in their scripts when they occupied the indoor Blackfriars Theatre in August 1608 as their winter playhouse. ''Timon'' is notoriously difficult to divide into acts, suggesting to Jowett that it was written at a time when act divisions were of no concern to the writer, hence it must have been written prior to August 1608.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Jowett | editor-first=John | editor-link=John Jowett | title=The Life of Timon of Athens | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2004 | page=4 | isbn=978-0-19-953744-0}}</ref> A ''terminus post quem'' may come from a possible topical allusion to the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of November 1605; \"those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire\" (Sc.7.32-33<ref>John Jowett's 2004 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare does not divide the play into acts.

Although the collaboration theory dates back to at least 1709 (Nicholas Rowe's ''The Works of Mr. William Shakespeare''), the theory of Wilkins' involvement originated in 1868, suggested by [[Nicolaus Delius]].<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Warren | editor-first=Roger | title=A Reconstructed Text of Pericles, Prince of Tyre | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2003 | page=62 | isbn=978-0-19-953683-2}}</ref> Wilkins status as co-author is generally accepted by modern scholars, and Delius' original breakdown of scenes remains the most widely agreed upon; Wilkins worked on scenes 1-9 and Shakespeare on scenes 10-22.<ref name=\"Taylor 130\" /> However, because the 1609 quarto is so badly corrupted and generally regarded as a poorly constructed memorial reconstruction,<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last=Wells | editor1-first=Stanley | editor1-link=Stanley Wells | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Gary | editor2-link=Gary Taylor (scholar) | editor3-last=Jowett | editor3-first=John | editor3-link=John Jowett | editor4-last=Montgomery | editor4-first=William | title=The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2005 | edition=2nd | origyear=1986 | page=[https://archive.org/details/completeworks0000shak_f0m2/page/1059 1059] | isbn=978-0-19-926718-7 | url=https://archive.org/details/completeworks0000shak_f0m2/page/1059 }}</ref> there is no complete agreement as to the motives or mechanism of the collaboration, with some scholars arguing for Shakespeare as sole author. For example, in their 1998 edition of the play for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Doreen Delvecchio and Anthony Hammond reject the theory of co-authorship, arguing that the problems inherent in the text arise not because of collaborative writing, but because of especially poor memorial reconstruction.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last=Delvecchio | editor1-first=Doreen | editor2-last=Hammond | editor2-first=Anthony | title=Pericles, Prince of Type | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=1998 | pages=197\u2013210 | isbn=978-0-521-29710-3}}</ref> On the other hand, in his 2002 book ''Shakespeare, Co-Author'', Brian Vickers is highly critical of Delvecchio and Hammond's analysis, arguing that co-authorship of the play is a virtual certainty.<ref>{{cite book | last=Vickers | first=Brian | authorlink=Brian Vickers | title=Shakespeare, Co-Author: A Historical Study of Five Collaborative Plays | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2002 | pages=291\u2013332 | isbn=978-0-19-926916-7}}</ref> Similarly, in 2003 book, ''Defining Shakespeare'', MacDonald P.

In fact, some scholars consider Wilkins' prose version to be a more accurate record of the original script than the 1609 quarto, and several modern editors have incorporated passages from Wilkins' prose into the play text, such as Roger Warren's 2003 edition for the Oxford Shakespeare, based on a text prepared by Gary Taylor and MacDonald P. Jackson, or the version in the 2nd edition of the ''Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works'' (2005), edited by Taylor. Stylistic analysis places the play in the period of 1607\u20131608. A rare word test of scenes 10-22 place them closest to ''The Tempest'', whereas a rare word test of scenes 1-9 place them closest to ''1 Henry IV''. If Shakespeare wrote 10-22, the proximity to ''The Tempest'' makes sense. If Wilkins wrote 1-9, Gary Taylor has suggested that due to the immense popularity of ''1 Henry IV'', Wilkins may have read it during composition in an effort to write in a Shakespearean manner. Ants Oras' pause test places scenes 10-22 closest to ''Macbeth'' and ''Antony and Cleopatra''.<ref name=\"Taylor 130\" /> Taken together, the stylistic evidence, the 1608 Stationers' Register entry, Wilkins' 1608 prose version, the 1608 performance seen by Giustinian, and the 1609 quarto, all serve to suggest a date of composition of 1607 or very early 1608.<ref>{{cite book | last=Barroll | first=J.

''Philaster'' and ''Cymbeline'' have strong verbal and tonal parallels, and both feature a broadly similar plot. Scholars are in general agreement that the plays were written around the same period, and that one influenced the other. The direction of influence, however, is not certain. If Beaumont and Fletcher were influenced by ''Cymbeline'', they must have seen it in performance. However, the theatres were closed until at least December 1609, meaning the play could not have been staged until early 1610. ''Philaster'' was read in MS by John Davies in October 1610, so if ''Philaster'' was influenced by ''Cymbeline'', it must have been written in the first half of 1610.<ref name=\"Taylor 132\">{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=Gary | authorlink=Gary Taylor (scholar) | chapter=The Canon and Chronology of Shakespeare's Plays | editor1-last=Wells | editor1-first=Stanley | editor1-link=Stanley Wells | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Gary | editor2-link=Gary Taylor (scholar) | title=William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1997 | edition=Revised | origyear=1987 | page=132 | isbn=978-0-393-31667-4}}</ref> However, this contradicts Andrew Gurr's evidence that ''Philaster'' was written in late 1609.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Gurr | editor-first=Andrew | editor-link=Andrew Gurr | title=Philaster Or, Love Lies a-Bleeding | location=Manchester | publisher=Manchester University Press | series=The Revels Plays | year=2003 | origyear=1969 | edition=Revised | page=xxvi-xxix | isbn=978-0-7190-6485-2}}</ref> On the other hand, Shakespeare would have had access to the ''Philaster'' MS, making it more likely that ''Philaster'' preceded ''Cymbeline''.

As Heywood commonly borrowed from Shakespeare's work, the likely explanation here is that ''Cymbeline'' preceded ''Golden Age''. However, the date of ''Golden Age'' is uncertain. It was published in 1611, but there is some evidence it may have been written in late 1610.

Warren argues that the play was performed at court during the [[investiture]] of James' eldest son [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry]] as [[Prince of Wales]], which ran from 31 May to 6 June. Central to the celebrations was Samuel Daniels' ''Tethys' Festival'', which foregrounded [[Milford Haven]] as the \"port of union\" where Henry's ancestor Henry Tudor had landed to face Richard III. Milford is similarly foregrounded in ''Cymbeline'', which also deals with the iconography and cultural significance of Welshness, providing a correlation between the geography of the play and the politics of the period.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Warren | editor-first=Roger | title=Cymbeline | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1998 | pages=64\u201365 | isbn=978-0-19-953650-4}}</ref> In his 2005 edition for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Martin Butler, citing much of the same evidence as Warren (although he is unconvinced by the connection with ''Golden Age''), agrees with a date of mid-1610.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Butler | editor-first=Martin | title=Cymbeline | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2012 | edition=Revised | origyear=2005 | page=5 | isbn=978-0-521-29694-6}}</ref>\n\n=== ''[[The Tempest]]'' (1610\u20131611) ===\n:'''''First official record''''': an entry in the Revels Account Book records a performance on 1 November 1611.\n:'''''First published''''': ''First Folio'' (1623).\n:'''''First recorded performance''''': in the banqueting hall at Whitehall Palace on 1 November 1611, performed by the King's Men.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Tempest | url=https://archive.org/details/tempest00will | url-access=registration | editor-last=Orgel | editor-first=Stephen | editor-link=Stephen Orgel | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1987 | page=[https://archive.org/details/tempest00will/page/62 62] | isbn=978-0-19-812917-2}}</ref>\n:'''''Evidence''''': the date of ''The Tempest'' can be securely fixed between September 1610 and October 1611. Obviously, to have been on stage on 1 November, it must have been completed before November, and it is unlikely that the Whitehall performance was the first performance (plays were rarely performed at court without previously appearing on the public stage). The ''terminus post quem'' of September 1610 can be fixed by Shakespeare's use of a real incident as source material. In May 1609 a fleet of nine ships set sail from Plymouth, heading for [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], carrying five hundred colonists. On 29 July, the flagship, the ''[[Sea Venture]]'', was driven off course by a storm and wrecked on the coast of Bermuda.

In most cases, the association, especially when formalised by local government, is known as \"[[town twinning]]\" (though other terms, such as \"partner towns\" or \"sister cities\" are sometimes used instead), and while most of the places included are towns, the list also comprises villages, cities, districts, counties, etc. with similar links.\n\n{{compact ToC| side=yes | name=Index | nobreak=yes

{"title_page": "Relics of Sariputta and Moggallana", "text_new": "[[Image:Moggallana - paranibbana.jpg|thumb|A depiction of Mahamoggallana's death.]]\nThe '''relics of Sariputta and Moggallana''' refers to the cremated remains of [[Sariputta]] ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: ''\u015a\u0101riputra''; [[Pali]]: ''S\u0101riputta'') and [[Moggallana]] ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: ''Maudgaly\u0101yana''; Pali: ''Moggall\u0101na''), the two chief disciples of [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]]. After a period, the relics were lost to civilization.\n\n== Sariputta and Moggallana ==\nSariputta and Moggallana were considered to have been the two chief disciples of the Buddha. Sariputta was considered the disciple who was foremost in [[Praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|wisdom]] and Moggallana was considered the disciple who was foremost in [[Iddhi|psychic powers]].{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=67}} Buddhist texts relate that Sariputta and Moggallana were childhood friends who became spiritual wanderers in their youth.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=411}} After having searched for spiritual truth under different contemporary masters, they came into contact with the teachings of the Buddha and ordained as monks under him, after which the Buddha declared the friends his two chief disciples, together described in the ''Mah\u0101pad\u0101na Sutta,'' as \"the chief pair of disciples, the excellent pair\" (Pali: ''s\u0101vakayuga\u1e41 agga\u1e41 bhaddayuga\u1e41'').{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=65}}{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=31-32,57}}{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=104}}{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=1903}} Texts describe that the two friends played a key leadership role in the Buddha's ministry and were tasked with the training of the Buddha's other disciples.{{sfn|Malalasekera|1937|p=}}{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=68-69}}\n\nAccording to Buddhist texts, Sariputta and Moggallana both died a few months before the Buddha. Accounts of Sariputta's death state that he died peacefully in his hometown and was cremated in the city of [[Rajagaha|R\u0101jagaha]]. Sariputta's assistant, Cunda, then brought his relics to the Buddha in [[Savatthi]], where they were enshrined in a ''stupa'' at [[Jetavana]] monastery.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=414-415}} Accounts of Moggallana's death state that he died violently, dying after being beaten by a group of bandits in a cave near R\u0101jagaha.{{sfn|Malalasekera|1937}}{{sfn|Rhys Davids|1908|p=769}} Buddhist texts state that Moggallana's relics were then collected and enshrined in the Ve\u1e37uvana monastery near R\u0101jagaha.{{sfn|Malalasekera|1937}}{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=275}} Over the succeeding centuries reports from Chinese pilgrims such as [[Xuanzang]] indicated that the relics could be found in the Indian city of [[Mathura]] in stupas built by Emperor [[Asoka]].{{sfn|Higham|2004|p=215}} However, as of 1999, no archaeological reports had confirmed such findings at the sites mentioned by either Chinese pilgrims or Buddhist texts.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=104-105}} Scholars have theorized that the relics were enshrined in ''stupas'' near Rajagaha after the disciples' deaths until the time of Emperor Asoka, who then redistributed them in ''stupas'' throughout India, and that a [[Shunga Empire|Sunga]] king may have also done a similar redistribution of the relics and built his own ''stupas'' to enshrine them.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=105-106}}{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=275}}    \n\n==Excavation==\n[[File:Sanchi Stupa No 3 relics.jpg|thumb|Relics of Sariputra and Mahamoggallana at [[Sanchi]] , Stupa No3.<ref name=\"AC\"/>]]\nIn 1851, the [[British people|British]] [[archaeologist]] Sir [[Alexander Cunningham]] was excavating at the [[Asoka]]n Buddhist complex in [[Sanchi]], near [[Bhopal]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] in [[India]], which dated to the 3rd century BCE. In the famous Third Stupa, he uncovered the bodily relics of Sariputra and Mahammoggallana. At approximately the same time, more relics of the two [[arahant]]s were found in a [[stupa]] at [[Satadhara]], about ten kilometres from Sanchi.\n\nAfter sinking a shaft in the centre of the stupa on Sanchi Hill, Cunningham unearthed a large stone slab, more than five feet in length, lying in a north-south axis. Beneath the slab were two boxes of gray [[sandstone]], each with a brief inscription in [[Br\u0101hm\u012b script|Br\u0101hm\u012b]] characters on the lid. The box at the southern end was inscribed \"Sariputtasa\" meaning \"(Relics) of Sariputra,\" while that to the north bore the inscription \"Maha-Mogalanasa.\" \"(Relics) of Maha Moggallana\".<ref name=\"AC\">The Bhilsa topes; or, Buddhist monuments of central India: 1854, by Cunningham, Alexander, Sir, 1814-1893 [https://archive.org/details/bhilsatopesorbud00cunn], Plate XXII</ref>\n\n==Contents of the relics==\nSariputra's box contained a large flat casket of white [[steatite]], more than six inches wide and three inches in height. The surface was polished and hard, and the box, which is believed to have been turned on a [[lathe]], was an elaborate piece of workmanship. Surrounding the casket were some fragments of [[sandalwood]] believed to have been from the [[funeral pyre]], while inside it, in addition to the relics, were various precious stones. The casket also contained a single bone relic of Sariputra, shorter than one inch in length.\n\nMahamoggallana's stone box enclosed another steatite casket, similar to that of Sariputra but slightly smaller and with a softer surface. Inside it were two bone relics of Mahamoggallana, smaller than those of Sariputra, the larger of them being less than half an inch long.\n\nEach of the caskets had a single ink letter inscribed on the inner surface of the lid: \"Sa\" for Sariputra on the southern and \"Ma\" for Mahamoggallana on that to the north. Cunningham analysed the situation thus: \"Sariputra and Mahamoggallana were the principal followers of the Buddha, and were usually styled his right and left hand disciples. Their ashes thus preserved after death the same positions to the right and left of Buddha which they had themselves occupied in life.\" This is explained by the fact that Gautama Buddha customarily sat facing east, and thus Sariputta and Mahamoggallana were aligned south and north respectively.\n\nIn the Satadhara stupa, one of a group which Cunningham noted was locally referred to as \"Buddha Bhita\" or \"Buddha Monuments,\" he discovered two caskets of pale mottled steatite. These were inscribed, like those at Sanchi, \"Sariputtasa\" and \"Maha Mogallanasa\". This stupa showed signs of tampering by burglars, but the bone relics appeared to have been undisturbed. Cunningham, left a detailed account of everything his excavations brought to light in these and other stupas, and the authenticity of the relics was established among scholarly ranks.\n\n==Display==\n{{Buddhism}}\nThe relics from both locations were taken to [[England]] and placed in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], but some discrepancies between Cunningham's description of the caskets and the actual boxes in which the relics were deposited led to speculation that someone transferred the relics from Sanchi to the caskets discovered at Satadhara, and thus what became of the Sanchi steatite caskets is not concretely known.\n\nThe Sacred Relics were preserved there until 1939, when the [[Maha Bodhi Society]] approached the [[British government]] to request their return to India. The request was granted, but the implementation was delayed due to the [[World War II|Second World War]]. As a result, the actual transfer did not occur until 24 February 1947, to ensure safe passage.\n\n==Subcontinent tour==\nBefore returning to India, the relics were taken to [[Sri Lanka]], where they were received with fanfare. For two and a half months in 1947, they were displayed for public viewing at the [[Colombo Museum]], where it was estimated that more than two million people of all faiths paid homage to them. The relics were then taken to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], where they were displayed for public viewing at the [Dharmarajika Vihara],headquarters of the Maha Bodhi Society of India. Long queues existed for the two weeks of display, and although most of the pilgrims were [[Hinduism|Hindus]], but there was also a large number of [[Islam|Muslims]] among them.\n\nThis was followed by a tour of [[Myanmar|Burma]]. In order that a wide cross section of Burmese society had an opportunity to view the relics, a marine tour along the [[Ayeyarwady River|Irrawaddy]] from [[Mandalay]] to [[Rangoon]] was commissioned, drawing vast crowds of people from the adjacent villages to hear sermons and the recitation of [[sutra]]s which accompanied the tour. This was followed be tours of [[Nepal]] and [[Ladakh]].\n\n==Interment==\nAfter the end of the international tour, the relics were returned to India. However the Burmese government requested a portion of the relics should be given to Burma. The Maha Bodhi Society of India agreed to this, and the then [[Prime Minister of Burma]] went in person to Calcutta to receive them.

In the famous Third Stupa, he uncovered the bodily relics of Sariputra and Mahammoggallana. At approximately the same time, more relics of the two [[arahant]]s were found in a [[stupa]] at [[Satadhara]], about ten kilometres from Sanchi.\n\nAfter sinking a shaft in the centre of the stupa on Sanchi Hill, Cunningham unearthed a large stone slab, more than five feet in length, lying in a north-south axis. Beneath the slab were two boxes of gray [[sandstone]], each with a brief inscription in [[Br\u0101hm\u012b script|Br\u0101hm\u012b]] characters on the lid. The box at the southern end was inscribed \"Sariputtasa\" meaning \"(Relics) of Sariputra,\" while that to the north bore the inscription \"Maha-Mogalanasa.\" \"(Relics) of Maha Moggallana\".<ref name=\"AC\">The Bhilsa topes; or, Buddhist monuments of central India: 1854, by Cunningham, Alexander, Sir, 1814-1893 [https://archive.org/details/bhilsatopesorbud00cunn], Plate XXII</ref>\n\n==Contents of the relics==\nSariputra's box contained a large flat casket of white [[steatite]], more than six inches wide and three inches in height. The surface was polished and hard, and the box, which is believed to have been turned on a [[lathe]], was an elaborate piece of workmanship. Surrounding the casket were some fragments of [[sandalwood]] believed to have been from the [[funeral pyre]], while inside it, in addition to the relics, were various precious stones. The casket also contained a single bone relic of Sariputra, shorter than one inch in length.\n\nMahamoggallana's stone box enclosed another steatite casket, similar to that of Sariputra but slightly smaller and with a softer surface. Inside it were two bone relics of Mahamoggallana, smaller than those of Sariputra, the larger of them being less than half an inch long.\n\nEach of the caskets had a single ink letter inscribed on the inner surface of the lid: \"Sa\" for Sariputra on the southern and \"Ma\" for Mahamoggallana on that to the north. Cunningham analysed the situation thus: \"Sariputra and Mahamoggallana were the principal followers of the Buddha, and were usually styled his right and left hand disciples. Their ashes thus preserved after death the same positions to the right and left of Buddha which they had themselves occupied in life.\" This is explained by the fact that Gautama Buddha customarily sat facing east, and thus Sariputta and Mahamoggallana were aligned south and north respectively.\n\nIn the Satadhara stupa, one of a group which Cunningham noted was locally referred to as \"Buddha Bhita\" or \"Buddha Monuments,\" he discovered two caskets of pale mottled steatite. These were inscribed, like those at Sanchi, \"Sariputtasa\" and \"Maha Mogallanasa\". This stupa showed signs of tampering by burglars, but the bone relics appeared to have been undisturbed. Cunningham, left a detailed account of everything his excavations brought to light in these and other stupas, and the authenticity of the relics was established among scholarly ranks.\n\n==Display==\n{{Buddhism}}\nThe relics from both locations were taken to [[England]] and placed in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], but some discrepancies between Cunningham's description of the caskets and the actual boxes in which the relics were deposited led to speculation that someone transferred the relics from Sanchi to the caskets discovered at Satadhara, and thus what became of the Sanchi steatite caskets is not concretely known.\n\nThe Sacred Relics were preserved there until 1939, when the [[Maha Bodhi Society]] approached the [[British government]] to request their return to India. The request was granted, but the implementation was delayed due to the [[World War II|Second World War]]. As a result, the actual transfer did not occur until 24 February 1947, to ensure safe passage.\n\n==Subcontinent tour==\nBefore returning to India, the relics were taken to [[Sri Lanka]], where they were received with fanfare. For two and a half months in 1947, they were displayed for public viewing at the [[Colombo Museum]], where it was estimated that more than two million people of all faiths paid homage to them. The relics were then taken to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], where they were displayed for public viewing at the [Dharmarajika Vihara],headquarters of the Maha Bodhi Society of India. Long queues existed for the two weeks of display, and although most of the pilgrims were [[Hinduism|Hindus]], but there was also a large number of [[Islam|Muslims]] among them.\n\nThis was followed by a tour of [[Myanmar|Burma]]. In order that a wide cross section of Burmese society had an opportunity to view the relics, a marine tour along the [[Ayeyarwady River|Irrawaddy]] from [[Mandalay]] to [[Rangoon]] was commissioned, drawing vast crowds of people from the adjacent villages to hear sermons and the recitation of [[sutra]]s which accompanied the tour. This was followed be tours of [[Nepal]] and [[Ladakh]].\n\n==Interment==\nAfter the end of the international tour, the relics were returned to India. However the Burmese government requested a portion of the relics should be given to Burma. The Maha Bodhi Society of India agreed to this, and the then [[Prime Minister of Burma]] went in person to Calcutta to receive them. The Burmese portion was ceremonially transferred to him in October 1950, and was later enshrined in the [[Kaba Aye Pagoda]] (World Peace Pagoda), built on the site of the Sixth Buddhist Council, close to Rangoon. Extensive ceremonies connected with the crowning of the pagoda and the installation of the relics lasted from the 5th to 11 March 1952.\n\nAnother portion was given to Sri Lanka to be enshrined in a new stupa built by the Maha Bodhi Society of Sri Lanka to receive them. They are currently housed in the temple of the Maha Bodhi Society, [[Colombo]], awaiting the completion of the building.\n\nOn 30 November 1952, the remaining relics were enshrined at Sanchi on completion of the new [[Chetiyagiri Vihara]] built to store them.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin |30em}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Ainsworth |first1=William Harrison |title=Ainsworth's Magazine: A Miscellany of Romance, General Literature, & Art |date=1854 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Ainsworth_s_Magazine/5j0FAAAAQAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0 |accessdate=19 April 2020 |language=en}}\n* {{Citation|last=Brekke|first=Torkel|date=2007-01-01|title=Bones of Contention: Buddhist Relics, Nationalism and the Politics of Archaeology|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/nu/54/3/article-p270_2.xml|journal=Numen|language=en|volume=54|issue=3|pages=270\u2013303|doi=10.1163/156852707X211564|issn=1568-5276}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Buswell|first1=Robert E.
